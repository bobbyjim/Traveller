		The Blade Combat skill cascade indicates a familiarity with the use of
edged weapons: Knife (which includes all short bladed weapons), and Sword

armed fighting, and the individual knows how to handle swords and knives in
combat situations. Within the skill cascade, the individual is skilled in a
specific type of blade weapon, and has a somewhat lower skill in the other
weapons.
	Blade Combat can be one of the most important skills an interstellar
traveller learns. The skill serves well on primitive worlds, where native
life forms tend to bring combat up close and personal. It is also of use on
civilized worlds, where firearms are often prohibited. When combat occurs
within a starship (where firearms might breach the hull or destroy delicate
electronics), Blade Combat is the accepted form of fighting.
	Knife. Knife skill involves the use of short blade weapons: dagger, bowies,
hunting knives, bayonets, stilettos, and trench knives.
	Sword. Sword skill involves the use of long blade weapons: swords, sabers,
and cutlasses.

weapon: the cutlass. A Marine prefers to state his or her skill as Cutlass.
Sword and Cutlass are identical skills.

	I think it would be nice to have a skill for swimming. Also, one for
jumping could be good, although I think athletics currently covers this.
But I think most fairly fit people are far more capable of jumping than
doing athletics!

	Also, how about breaking some of the survival skills down a bit? Or is
this a bad idea? Some could be fishing, build shelter, locate water,
recognise edible food from the surrounding flora and fauna, etc.

This seems to imply that Tokamaks do not use magnetic confinement, they do.
Ohmic heating is the process of heating  the plasma by running a current
through it.  The current also produces a "poloidal field" (magnetic field
running along the axis of the plasma; i.e. through the center of the
\'doughnut\' or torus.  Not being a science type, I\'ll relate the text of one
of our PR works ;

"In the stellerator, the role of the current in the plasma is replaced by
external magnetic coils, which may make steady state operation easier."

So, the stellarator (I have not encountered the term "Wendelstein") heats
by magnetism.

The Stellarator was named, incidentially, for the character in "Streetcar
Named Desire"("Stella!").  [just kidding]

No tokamak, as far as I know, produces *any* electricity at all.  They are
all experimental devices which study (for the moment) *Plasma* behavior and
characteristics.  This will be very important for future experimental and
production fusion reactors.  Although possibilities for harnessing the heat
and other energies emitted are explored and tested, no tokamak is really
being harnessed for energy output.  In fact, you should see our electricity
bills! (which comes to my job; paying the bills!).  If the fusion reaction
can be made to be self-sustaining, the magical \'breakpoint\' will be reached
where energy output exceeds energy input.  In the community, it is hoped
that the ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) will reach
this point (after several further years of experimentation).  Of course, if
the U.S. Congress decides its silly to build a fusion reactor in another
country they may take away funding for the project (many countries are
contributing to the project, including Japan).

Experts in the field still can\'t say conclusively that one shape is better
than onother.  ITER will, however, be a Tokamak, and that is the best
studied shape.  All the shapes represent tradeoffs of one kind or another,
so it may be that they are all realtively likely to be the "right" shape
for a fusion reactor.

That\'s pretty good, except that you have a massive computer and a $11
million grant to try for it, which will just about pay for the plane.

Fortunately we only have to maintain stable plasmas at temperature for 3-4
seconds at a time.

Southern China and India is due to the climate (hot and wet), crowding and
the presence of phenomenal numbers of large, domestic herbivores (we create
a filthy disease ridden environment by not allowing them to move at will, by
the sheer mass of fecal matter large herbivores produce). Some other areas

Hi Andy,
I think your post points out the "feature" <g> of the TML to scream loud
and long about products, without really understanding the point of why
it does it. The above paragraph about "ridiculously short" play-testing
times and development cycles pretty much sums up the "opportunities"
people are beginning to feel once again from IG. It gives us the *impres-
sion* that IG feels it can shovel any half-cooked shit our way in the 
interest of staying "on schedule" and as long as they slap T4 somewhere
on the cover we\'ll eat it up and not notice. That was one of their major
"challenges" in the first, Starships, Era of IG, and something that they
repeatedly stated they were going to fix, Quality Control. The books have
gotten an order of magnitude better than Starships (with the dismal excep-
tion of First Survey), and yet they are still plagued by very blatant problems
like the <-> problem in FFS2. The List asks incredulously "Didn\'t anyone
playtest or proofread this thing before it was printed?" and we *consistently*
get back the answer "We were under such a tight deadline and so rushed
in order to meet a schedule...." This is not a slam against you 
and the other authors; given the circumstances y\'all have done an incred-
ible job and it is truly astounding that things work as well as they do. It\'s
just when things like *obvious* typos (DISCLAIMER: I have not yet seen
FFS2, but from the description on the list I think I can safely say that 
equations replacing multiplication symbols with "<->" is an *obvious*
typo to anyone who tries to use the damn thing ONCE before it gets 
printed.) and missing tables get explained away with "So rushed trying to
get it out by such-and-such" that the List screams enough is enough and is
just about ready to tell IG what they can do with their sacred schedule.
With the constantly rewriting of past history that is going on in the T4
books, I sometimes get the feeling that the only thing IG feels is Canon
is the Blessed Release Schedule.

Speaking of past history revisionism, did whoever it was who asked MM
about whether the "canon typos" (David? Sam?) ever get back an answer?

P.S. I apologize for the grumpy tone of the above message, but in defense
would like to point out that I got to run Traveller for my group last night
for the first time in literally *months* and that\'s put me in a great mood, so
I\'m not nearly as grumpy as I would be <g>

    'body' => 'I haven\'t seen anything on the digest about this product since it\'s been
released, so here\'s my two cents worth....

I went down yesterday to take a look at it, & spent about five minutes
leafing through it -- not a comprehensive overview, but long enough to
determine that (like the original) I\'d never make heads nor tails of it.
That isn\'t what annoyed me. What annoyed me was that I was looking
specifically at the missile-building section... I LOVE missiles, and the
bigger & more of them the better; they\'re cheap and hard-hitting and
leave picturesque corkscrew contrails all over the place when you shoot
a whole batch of \'em.... nobody who was a member of the Anime Junkie
Underground in the early-mid 1980\'s could help but love missile
launchers....

....and I saw that you have to (a) buy enough fuel to get the missile to
the target, as opposed to buying a Generic Missile Booster with perhaps
the cost and bulk determined by TL, and that (b) this is expressed in
G-hours.

Now this presumes (unless I\'m way off base) that your ships -- the
targets you are trying to hit -- ALSO have their thrust expressed in
G-hours.... but they aren\'t (they are expressed, of course, in terms of
ACCELERATION, from 1-6 G\'s). There were plenty of examples of things
that aren\'t addressed in the main rule system (that is just the one I
happen to recall).... just as there was in the SSDS, where there were
row upon row of abstract figures and values that STILL haven\'t been
explained or addressed (light-seconds, having to convert damage from
obsolete TNE measures to T4, etc., with zero explanation of what these
numbers meant, where they came from, or were intended to be used for).

I was willing to give it a fair shot -- it is certainly much better
illustrated and laid out than any of its predecessors, which pleased me
since most all the T4 books look as though they were laid out by a
student intern -- but my overwhelming initial impression was that the
content has nothing to do with T4 at all. It looks as though it was
simply a cleaned-up and improved version of the old FF&S, and makes
numerous assumptions tha the reader is familiar with & conversant with
the TNE rules set -- now obsolete and out of print for several years. 

In other words, it looks as though it were produced Of, By, and For the
Traveller Mailing List, and is about as useful to anybody NOT being a
math whiz and and NOT having all the old books memorized and NOT having
been along for the ride for the past ten-fifteen-odd years as teats on a
boar hog. What IS a G-hour? WHERE is this mentioned in the T4 rulebook?
HOW does one build a QSDS or even SSDS ship and then build an FF&S2
missile to shoot at it? How, for Christ\'s sake, do you determine who
hits what?

I am now convinced that with such a bizarre, retrograde design backbone
for their game system -- hardware design being central to the hard-SF
genre -- that IG will falter and die off within two or three years.
Which is a drastic assumption to make after five minutes of skimming
through one book, and I openly welcome testimony to the contrary. I rode
the bus for half an hour to Gamescape because I was willing to look at
it and be convinced, and I still am. If you can convince me that it
ain\'t that bad and is relevant to existing material, then I will try to
swallow all those formulae. For example: is there an updated combat
system in FF&S2 that makes use of G-hours, and moreover will convert
existing ship designs whose thrust is expressed in G\'s of acceleration
to G-hour-stats... and I skimmed over it? Let\'s see some reviews &
feedback, please.

In the meantime, I\'d encourage anybody putting together an Excel
spreadsheet for FF&S2 to limit themselves to creating one spreadsheet
for each component type, instead of super-gigantic, all-encompassing
monsters to design a whole ship by. If you can put something together to
let mere mortals like myself create their own spinal mount or capital
missile launcher or sensor suite, then have a column at the bottom
expressing the result in T4 stats so we can plug it into our SSDS/QSDS
creations, that would be the greatest of services to the T4 gaming
community at large. If IG has two active brain cells to rub together at
this point, they\'ll put them on a CD-ROM and start bundling them with
the rulebook.... and eliminate all that pointless, unexplained crap
about \'microseconds\' and \'G-hours.\'

I think I\'m in the minimalist camp. I\'d prefer to have more "generic"
skills, instead of a large number of definitive skills. The biggest thing
I\'ve had a hard time with in terms of "skills" is that undefinable quality
that lets you scan the surroundings for a hint of danger or something out
of place.

I respectfully disagree with you.  The difference is the Vilani are 300,000
years removed from Terran organisms. They won\'t have developed *any* kind
of immunities to earthly diseases.  The infection rate would be *much*
higher than in the a general population here (even an isolated one) and the
effects on those infected would be much worse.

Oh, I don\'t know, Unilever is pretty well known over here.  How about

True; Jump "space" is canonical "fact"; interpration thereof is subject to
each instantitation of the game by a group. That I interpret the Jump effect
to twist off a tiny pocket of space time from the rest of universe and
reconnect it at a different location rather than assert that this thing
called Jump Space exists separate and distinct from normal space time is my
interpretation; one that I find fits several pieces of Traveller together
nicely: Jump, Gravitics & Thruster plates; plus the borrow from 2300,
Stutter Warp.

A magnetically confined plasma is a good analogy to what I view Jump effect
to like. Electron tunnelling, however, is a particle effect, not an atom
level effect. If you want to use a particle effect to move a ship, you would
have to induce all of the particles to co ordinate the same effect in the
same direction at the same time. Our old friend Heisenberg is back. I have
not heard of proton, neutron or atom tunnelling. A magnetic bottle, like a
gravitational bottle, bounds a space, and effects all objects within that
space equally. The same as I view the effect of an active Jump Drive. So the
analogy for Stutter Warp is electron tunnelling, the implementation is
different. Like flying; birds fly, 747s fly (generally), implementation is
vastly different.

This gives me a comfortable feel in explaining how Jump works; others may be
able to percieve the standalone, existant space concept better. In fact, the
recent thread on Jump Space being an Ancient Artifact fits rather well with
my idea of Jump Effect being derived from gravity\'s ability to create pocket
universes. This Ancient Artifact Jump Space would be various Pocket
Universes, like the one in Secret of the Ancients, created to shorten
distance between two points in real space. Lhyd fuel expended is actually to
feed the power system maintaing the pocket universe the ship traversing, the
different Jump distances, 1 thru 6,  represent progressively smaller pocket
universes. The 2d maps are due to the fact that actual position in real
space has no relationship to where the system intersects the pocket
universe. Gives Han Solo\'s claim \'to having made the Kessel run in less than
6 parsecs\' a different meaning: he found a pocket universe path to Kessel
that was shorter that the normal 6 parsec path.

I haven\'t chucked out the published history of Traveller; just giving it my
own reading that makes it easier for me to work with.

Actually, my version is heavily influenced by an "age of sail" bias too,
although, "colonial age" may be more apropos.  ;-> 

I picture things more like:  

Vilani=Aztec Empire/Imperial China  and  Solomani=Europeans

Anyway, here\'s my version of the Interstellar War era...all opinion and
(you know me) nothing to do with the "c" word.  ;->

Terrans weren\'t a Confederation until 30 years after contact with the
Vilani.  During the first war and for 20+ years after it ended it was
individual nations and corporations that were dealing with the Vilani. Even
after the Confederation formed, we don\'t know just how much control it had
over the actions of it\'s constituent members...I suggest it had very
little, at least for the first 40 to 50 years.

During this First Colonial Period, the subsector and eventually the entire
sector is colonized by national and corporate Terran groups.  The fact that
the Vilani are already there matters as little as the fact that the
Americans, Africa, India and China were already occupied when the Europeans
arrived.  Certainly, the Vilani are more equally matched with the Terran
colonizers, but disease and a much more dynamic culture (socially,
economically, and technically) gives the Terrans a big advantage.  The
first few "Interstellar Wars" are more sporatic skirmishes between Terran
National forces and local Vilani forces than set-to wars.

The second half of the period begins when the Vilani Sector Governor
finally decides to "pacify" his new Terran subjects, now occupying huge
sections of the sector.  The Terrans resist, call on their home
countries/corporations for support, and while that always worked before it
doesn\'t work too well now with entire Vilani fleet elements being committed
for the first time.  The colonies\' parents appeal to the Confederation and
for the first time the whole of the Solomani population is mobilized
against the Vilani.

You wouldn\'t think the Solomani would be a match for the 10,000 worlds of
the Vilani, but once the Terran fleets began to move they didn\'t stop until
they had sweep across the entire Imperium.  How they were able to do it has
been debated ever since, but in large part it was because the Ziru Sirka
was an empty shell.  The Vilani had never run into a race with fleets of
warships.  They had expanded across charted space for thousands of years
virtually unopposed.  They simply didn\'t have the huge fleets they *could*
have built, they had never really needed them.

There were a few "pacification" fleets scattered throughout the Imperium to
keep the various minor races under control.  There were also a few "mobile"
fleets to deal with external threats, but they were almost all tied down
keeping the Vargr under control on another front entirely. There simply
wasn\'t anything to shift to the Terran front, and once the Terran fleets
jumped past the Vilani forces near their border they ran free all the way
across the Ziru Sirka.

Vilani civilization was founded on acceptance of authority and when a
sector Governor surrendered, the entire sector more or less surrendered at
the same time.  The minor races didn\'t have a reason to support the Vilani,
and had never been allowed to create strong forces anyway, so they just
went along with the general trend.  Within a few years the entire Ziru
Sirka had simply surrendered to the Terrans and the Solomani were in
charge.  The *story* is that the Ziru Sirka was rotten, but that\'s not
really true, it just wasn\'t organized to defend against an opponent with
fleets of warships, and it never understood what it was facing until it was
too late to do anything about it...except surrender and avoid the
destruction of their planets.

It turns out that the Solomani couldn\'t *govern* the entire Imperium, but
that\'s another story.

What about morale? Aids certainly as made major changes in society; The
Black Plague panicked people to abandon towns and cities, shut down
businesses and industries. Everything I have see on Vilani Culture to date
indicates that they do not react well to sudden changes or surprises.

	Well, I think you\'re a bit cooler than NYC in August, but man, I\'d
just give the garbage workers what they want... it can get awfully smelly
in a humid environment like Vancouver..and it\'s astonishing how much
garbage is generated daily in large urban areas.

upheaval is the time to do it. Particularly if the national guard is busy
picking up, which is what they ended up doing in New York, IIRC. The
Guardies were _not_ pleased ;-)

Thanks for the clarification...(the term \'Wendelstein\' is referring to a
particular test reactor that one of the members of the list has claimed is
going to be producing power in the next couple of years...since I can\'t
read German, I\'m kinda stuck out of the details he\'s posted)

school, over 20 years ago...it was \'just around the corner...\' Sigh.

In the US Navy, *all* helo pilots start with fixed wing. Only after getting
their wings for fixed wing aircraft do they start helo school.

I\'m not sure, but I think the US Army doesn\'t give their helo pilots any
fixed wing training at all.  They are the only branch to train enlisted as
helicopter pilots. The Navy and Air Force only train Officers as pilots.

Marc,

One skill from th CT days that is not present in T4 is the Steward
skill. While I admit that it was a weak skill, "care and feeding of
passengers", I think that it has some potential if expanded. One
expansion I have used in the past is to include cargo handling duties
under this skill. That is the ability to determine the "most efficient
way to store AND SECURE cargo", to explain I point to the most efficient
way to store cargo, obviously last in first out, but if it\'s screwed up
a lot of time and labor could be wasted moving it. As far as secureing
the cargo, well who wants tons of crates floating around while running
from that pirate at multiple gees! Then there is live cargo and it\'s
requirements. I have also concidered adding life support to the
steward\'s responsibility, although this can easily be covered by
Engineering or simple mechanics, but we needd something for these
pest... crewmen to do to earn their pay, if we continue to require them
on passenger carrying ships.

Anyway, just some food for thought,
Mike Peters

It\'s called \'Perception\', but of course it\'s modified by the particulars
of your career, IMO.

This brings up a refinement of the \'skills\' concept that isn\'t very well
defined. There are two kinds of skills: specific knowledge on subjects,
specific muscle training in certain tasks, and skills that in themselves
are unfocused, but enhance other ones. All right THREE kinds, but the last
is harder to define as a specific skill. As a ferinstance, a character I\'m
running right now has Perception 4, and was a police detective in a former
life.  As I run that character, she\'ll be good at picking out the subtle
hints and clues that enable a detective to do their job, which are
different from the subtle hints and clues that enable a scout to do their
job, or the subtle hints and clues that enable a cryptologist to do thier
job, but someone with Perception X will be equally good at all of them.

A quick perusal of the skills list actually puts only the infamous JOT,
Athletics, Perception, and perhaps, Carousing in the last class of
\'skill-enhancing\' skills. 

I have no clue how to deal with this, or even whether they need dealing
with, but they\'re potenially as abusable as JOT, except by modifying the
task descriptions to include the specific skill needed for the general
one, perhaps a Perception (Investigation) task.

Other than that, I\'m with Joe in the minimalist camp.

Up until the Canuk-Yank war of late July (?)/early August \'97, I had

the suggestion that balkanization was a trait of human society.  With
that understanding, I launch a proposed scenario for the E21 milieu
under recent discussion on the TML.


E21 Scenario Motivation
- ----

The Barnard assignment was one of rotating a number of ships on routine
patrol to maintain a presence given the last decade\'s discovery of a
new (Vilani) human race on the near worlds of the stars close to Terra.

It just so happened that one Commander Howard Hall, in command of the
American Frigate "Columbus", started the first instance of exchange of
starship fire (combat) by telling the Vilani, "The _Terran_ Way may not
be perfect, but it is superior to your Vilani established traditions."
It is not certain who actually fired the first shot as some recorders
were damaged on the Terran Frigate.

Thus began the First Interstellar War.  The outcome is left to the referee
to determine.

I have just completed 15 semester hours of Summer session courses.  Needless
to say, I feel relieved.  I have stayed in touch via quick reading my
digests over the past weeks, and have selected a number of notes to get some
more discussion going here. :)  I am also revisiting some past discussion
items that I now have time to give proper attention to.

I am posting as much as I have written, though I admit that the process of
doing the following posts justice, I have managed to stay about as many
digests behind as when I started catching up.  Please bear in mind that I
am about a dozen (at least) behind now.

Some fun things have transpired recently, including getting YAFF&S (Yet
Another FF&S) and Gateway just today, courtesy of an ongoing labor dispute. :)

The list may have been a little hasty in asking the abrupt Canuk-Yank war
(an exaggeration) to go offline.  As Harold pointed out, it was relevant
to the E21 milieu under discussion, though I would put the percentage at
about 30 or 40. B-)  The question of Quebec is an interesting one.  As a
Yank, biased by my media, one would think that Quebec will be independent
some day soon.

While this has always been a "fun" topic to imagine (just from the stand
point of change in the world), I have always deeply suspected that, like
Tianenmen Square, we westerners have been led astray by the headlining
media and those who know how to manipulate it, and in fact Quebec\'s
secession will always be just a decade away, unless the media succeeds in
making it happen.  (Canada, watch out if Connie Chung heads your way. :)

I look forward to your replies as always.  It has been an interesting
respite, and I expect to be able to follow things more, despite two
systems outages planned for next week that will interrupt some of my
access.  I will, however, persist, as always. B-)

Actually, the FIW ends at -2400 and starts at -2408. [5]

I\'m not surprised really.  As someone pointed out before, MT was rather
errata prone.

I don\'t consider the debate between one source meaning synaptic and one
source saying AI.  Either source is just as likely to be error-prone.  The
AI does fit in with a higher tech RoM, however.

There was no 9th Interstellar War.  It was after the 8th that the Terrans
discovered J-3 drives (JumpTech 12, Common Terran Tech 15).  This would have
been a short time before the start of the Nth Interstellar War.

Again, assuming that JumpTech is the Common Tech of the Vilani Imperium and
the Rule of Man.

A third way of looking at these "facts" from the perspective of Milieux is
close to the second way.

Consider.  A budding Third Imperium has more to gain from focusing on the
truth about the past Imperia, and thus in M:0, the knowledge is common.

Later, in M:1100, there is an established Third Imperium, that has existed
for 1700 years (counting Sylean Federation beginnings) and is more focused
on the present, rather than the past.  For perhaps easy to see reasons,
like the second option above, the TI lets common misperception lie with
respect to what the Rule of Man had _actually_ achieved.  Afterall, Jump
Tech is an easy failing of those who judge history by the achievement of
the Jump drive.

I like the Jump Tech argument better.  It provides for more understanding
of the Traveller Universe on a grand scale, especially if certain additional
assumptions are made.

And, the absence of J-4 drives allows the inferior (-3 level) Jump Tech

Andrew,

   Right on both accounts.  The S&A set things at TL15, while Alien Module 6
had a max tech level for the Solomani Confederation being TL14.

   However, since both of these references deal with generating worlds for
M1100 or M1120, they have little bearing on the Tech Level of Terra, Three
Thousand, Five Hundred years Earlier!

I like the idea of this Milieu.  It reminds me of Triplanetary, and that is
good.  If the Solar System were too frontier-ish, it would make for a boring
campaign.  If the timeline properly extrapolated several tech levels of
growth in the next century (99 years to jump drive everyone!) then I see a
lot of potential for before and after contact with the Vilani.

Consider, we started at TL5 (1900AD) and reached TL8 (minus a few things)
today.  Given the remarkable growth of the last half-century, it is easy to
extrapolate reaching TL12/13 by the time we invent Jump drive, especially
when you consider rates at which our sciences are growing, and our robots
are exploring the Solar System.

Also, some elements of Traveller: 2300 (2300AD) could be incorporated.

Volker,

    Now that finals are over, I can get back to this issue.

    I think that if your memory were correct, Grandfather would not have
had the need for all those robots he built from general dissatisfaction of
the poor performance of the myriad human species that they had "built" and
the general disregard for Grandfather\'s ways by his children and
grandchildren.

    I\'m sorry, but I feel that the _Anomalies_ has put things in as good
a perspective of the past Traveller (Classic) references, hence the change
of the topic I\'ve posted this under.

<JOKE>
    T4 _is_ Traveller.  Period.  End of Story.  There, I\'ve saved the whole
    Droyne race! :)  Next nail-biting concern?

Doug, I have been getting caught up on the digests that came my way while
I hermitized myself for finals.  I saw that you will be away for awhile.
I hope you have the chance to respond to this note, but take your time--
there is no rush.

Thanks for mentioning the above two sources--I really had fun rereading
through my Invasion: Earth game, and it is always a pleasure to pull out
my Supplement 5: Lightning Class Cruisers.

Just to set the record straight, there is absolutely no mention of Terra
being TL13 when invaded by the Imperium, or that it reached TL15 under
Imperial Military rule.  In fact the only UPP given for Terra in the game\'s
references is 15!  This is consistent with the fact that the MT Referee\'s
Companion states that the Third Imperium was TL15 at the time also.  Since
Terra had been a member of the TI up until 871, it is no surprise that
Terra would be the Imperium\'s maximum tech as well.

The only reference to Terra in the Azhanti High Lightning game that I can
find is the fact that two ships in Scout Service are running a special
dispatch service from Core to Terra.  Yes, the Azhantis were built at TL14,
but there is absolutely no mention of them even having been procured at
Terra.  The only rim system that I recognize in the book is Gashidda.

It is possible that I have missed something in these sources, but I do
consider it highly unlikely.  However, if you would be good enough to provide
page numbers and/or specific quotes from those sources, I would be extremely
interested.

I hope you were not counting on my not owning these rather hard to find
pieces of Classic Traveller collectibles. B-)

I have two of each--one for keeping in Mint condition, the other for use
when playing Traveller. <G>

Nearly the same amount of time before today\'s date, people were saying
that rockets would never fly as well.  I think you underestimate the
amount of growth we have already gone through, and will be able to go
through in as short a period of time.

I nevertheless appreciate it, whether I agree with you or not.

I certainly give a _lot_ of weight to Marc Miller, the most common name
among all of the sources below, whose credits list who did what.  I don\'t
see how any accounting of Traveller "canon" can ommit this basic reality.

Well, if you are trying to make a comparison to the low point of TNE, the
H&I (as you mentioned above and I heartily agree, especially being a fan
of Hivers and such), I think that has gone a little too far.  At the same
time, I would argue that there are some realities of gaming in the \'90s
that we fans of gaming in the \'70s to \'80s have to realize.

Chris,

Thanks for that excellent setup line! B-)

I find it ironic that I have been planning phase II of the Great RoM Tech
Level discussion, and interestingly enough, I had decided to pick the
Interstellar Wars for my starting point.  Then, here comes the thread. B-)

The RoM Tech Level discussion (from my perspective) has only dealt with the
"raw facts" that I had suggested were around to support the T4 system\'s
claim of a higher than (TML) believed tech level.  I had always stated that
there was scant information about the Rule of Man, the Interstellar Wars,
and that general period of Traveller history.  This view has been reinforced
by the simple fact that there are only six UPPs that have been published for
Terra in the mainstream of Traveller, and three are debatable as to their
"canonality" and/or relevance.

Some have suggested that I had a motive in proving that the RoM was a
higher tech level.  That is not the case.  My motive was proving that
the RoM _could_ have been as T4 has suggested.  Having listened to all
of the "evidence", both for and against, I am left with two points of
view.  I am doing my best to state both views below.  Afterwards, my
conclusions follow.


I now take the POV of those who argued that the RoM was merely a TL12 entity,
whose primary support is drawn from the Jump-Tech Level tables that were
printed in the MT Referee\'s Companion, pg. 34.

TL 12 RULE OF MAN (Maximum TL at anytime in the Rule of Man was 12)

This view\'s assertion is primarily based upon tables that were prefaced by
the words "tech levels achieved by the major interstellar powers."  (BTW,
I view _this_ Vilani Imperium, as decadent, if not more, than the Chanestin
Kingdom of M:0.)

Terra had invented the Jump drive just a mere 23 years before the start of
the First Interstellar Wars.  They didn\'t even know they had an interstellar
drive for nearly half of that 23 years.  Using their Jump fuel caches, they
reached Barnard, Prometheus, and Agidda to find that there were already
Vilani in these systems.  War begins, and luckily, the Terrans had built
up large caches of Jump fuel, to last the eight years of the First
Interstellar War.  Luckily, captured Vilani technology gave the Terrans
an even keel in Tech Level against the Vilani--both are TL 11 by the time
the Second Interstellar War begins.

The Vilani Empire was so decadent, that these little frontier rebellions
(Interstellar Wars) are prosecuted by the Terrans for seven or so wars,
until the decadent Empire finally mobilizes in 150 years, all of its
rimward frontier might, but it is too late.  Terra has captured two whole
subsectors, has begun colonizing a third and it is too much for 12,000 world
Imperium to handle when the Terrans make that startling breakthrough--Jump 3
drives.  With the startling advantage of TL12 technology, this little three
subsector tech level 12 state continues to use the advantage of 50% greater
jump capabilities, and through this "capture the flag" scenario, the Terrans
conquer the decadent empire of the Vilani.

By the time the Vland fleet catches up to the Terran fleet, they have seized
the Empire, the homeworld, and the Vilani have nothing left to do but to
surrender unconditionally.

Or ...


A HIGHER TECH RULE OF MAN (Maximum TL agrees with T4, i.e. 15 or more)

The Terrans had a firm biotech of 14 by -2400 (when the Dolphins et al
ere modified) and just happened to lag behind in jump tech by 3 tech levels.
Afterall, they didn\'t even know they had jump drive for over a decade after
it had been invented, so being behind in the arena of jump tech is no
surprise.

Since Terran manufacturing was well ahead of the Vilani (themselves at TL13),
it was fortunate for the Terrans that they had a one TL advantage over the
Vilani to compensate for the Terran backwardness with respect to jump tech.
The impetuous Terrans didn\'t know how lucky they were fighting the First
Interstellar War what with a decadent Imperial structure on the rimward end
of the Grand Imperium.  Had they known just what they were undertaking, they
may have just fled to as far rimward as their ships would carry them.

Just learning of the fact that there were jump drives in the universe which
were capable of more than a parsec range, the Terrans quickly revisited the
jump technology that they were now dependent upon for their very lives, and
by the end of the FIW, had successfully duplicated known Vilani J-2 capacity.

The turning point, again luckily for the Terrans, was the Terran invention
of the J-3 drive, again, luck in the sense that the Vilani had mobilized vast
resources to pound these frontier upstarts.  The combined fact of Terran TL15
weapons systems, and spacecraft systems (the jump tech lag was still 3) and
somewhat superior jump technology (compared to the Vilani J-2 maximum) gave
the Terrans decisive advantage entering the period of the Nth Interstellar
War (a collective name for several important battles to which no one could
be properly called an Interstellar War in past consecutive fashion).

A single tech level of advantage in Jump, and two tech level advantage in
general tech capabilities gave the Terrans an Empire to Rule.  While the
Terrans had reached a TL16 science of Terraforming, the emphasis on terra-
forming new worlds was reduced with the whole frontier of the Vilani worlds
of the Grand Imperium.  Later, isolated cases of applied Terran science for
terraforming would be used, but these would be exceptions, not the rule.

Note: this latter view is entirely consistent with all of the information
presented in June and July to this list: CT, MT, TNE, and T4.


CONCLUSIONS

Awhile back, a couple of people here on TML told me (on the HIWG list) that
Traveller is 95% game mechanics and other things, with background being only
5%.  While my knowledge of Traveller is richer for all of the discussion
here, I don\'t think their estimates were anywhere close, given the response
I have generally seen here to the over all discussion of the Rule of Man\'s
Tech Level.

I am not contending that TL15+ was the average TL of RoM, just the maximum,
and I said a long time ago, that it was skewed toward the Terran Rim, and
nowhere even near the average consistent tech level of the Third Imperium.
This _is_ consistent with the T4 quote that I previously provided.  (For
those not familiar with the TI\'s worlds, tech ranges from typically seven
to 16, averaging somewhere in between.)  Perhaps the average Vilani tech
would contribute to a higher mean due to the age of their empire, but
it would probably still fall below the TI (M1100) mean tech level.  Afterall,
the Terran sphere was not very big upon consolidation of the Vilani Imperium.

I am sorry, but trying to persuade me that the Terrans had to resort to
stealing Vilani Tech to make further progress, after reaching TL14 by the
time of the FIW\'s end, just does not do anything for me.  Especially, when
you consider that the rapid progress along the Tech Level lines right up to
the Interstellar Wars period, is in _perfect_ harmony with what Terra started
to accomplish after the world\'s Great Depression of the 1930\'s.

A high Tech Terra, all the way through the Interstellar Wars, through the
entire period of the Rule of Man, through the Long Night, through the early
Dawn, and later joining the Third Imperium _is_ consistent with what has
been published.  And I can see this for either a Terra of TL15 or TL16 as
a common Tech.

I have developed an opinion that MT did Traveller a disservice by fogging
the Tech Level tables with WBH and doing the Tech Level dilineation that
it did.  At the same time, the very nature of minor alien/human races by
definition break the idea of standard Tech Level rules, the most extreme
case being the Sabmiqys (TL17, but STL travel, no FTL) of Antares sector.

Whether the facts and view of RoM as I have presented them here were by
design (as is my view of what Marc Miller intended) or a grand mistake
that somehow conspired to so consistently warp the reality of Traveller
(that of most people\'s view of the universe), the table is set and there
is a _reality_ that _is_ plausible to anyone who has not yet managed to
run a Traveller campaign set in the RoM era.  It is those people who have
nothing to loose by enriching their universe in this fashion.

A light-second is the distance light travels in one second viz 300 000km.

A G is an acceleration of 10 meters per second squared. A G-hour is
an accleration of one gee sustained for one hour. If a missile has
four gee-hours worth of fuel, it could accelerate at rour gees for
one hour, one gee for four hours, one tenth of a gee for forty hours
and so on (assuming of course it\'s maneuvering system can produce
enough thrust to accelerate at those rates).

A g-hour rating is needed, becasue lets say I have a missile that can pull
fifty gees. Can it hit your one-gee freighter ? Maybe. Who knows. Cant tell 
... until I know how long the missile (and the freighter for that matter)
can *sustain* that acceleration. Is it better to have a fifty-gee engine
with enough fuel for three minutes thrust, or a ten gee engine that can
keep the thrust up for an hour ? I dont know ... thats a design decision.

Also, if you check most designs for ships that use HEPLAR, they do have
acceleration listsed in gee-hours (eg "enough fuel for twenty hours 
operation at two gees).

You know the ships acceleration out of QSDS/SSDS. Now build your
missile, and give it a conservative fuel allowance of thirty minutes
maximum thrust. Done.

And I\'d say TTA is a product built by and for gearheads, rather than by
and for TML list people.

TTA is for people who *dont* want to design things by plugging pre-designed
components into pre-designed hulls. It\'s a product by and for gearheads,
for people who want to get deep into the guts of the design system, and
try out things like solar-powered particle accelerators on a hull made of
fibreglass - things that existing rules and designs dont cover.

(hmmm ... the fibreglass hull could spoof densitometers, and since we arent
using fission or fusion then a lot of the other sensors will have problems
as well ... we\'ll need a little combat maneuverability, so lets add some
solid-fuel boosters ... say three gee-seconds worth, so we can get off a 
second shot when fighting at a lightsecond or so ... hmmmmm).

A microsecond is an SI unit for one thousandth of a second. 

The point about T4 stats is well made - the problem is that the TTA
designers got told to build the new design system now, and other people
will build the new combat system later.

Part of the problem with putting the rules on CD-ROM is that people
would copy them onto floppies, and IG would have trouble with piracy.

With temps in the mid 20s to low 30s (Celsius - we\'re not _that_ far 
north :), things are ripening nicely. :/

I really don\'t see China and Russia coorperating in any way. They have
both traditions for establising empires and are likly to clash soemtime in
the future as there economies are resurected and there vision of glorious
empires return.

EU is today faced with a long line of problems as more and more right
ekstrimist groups get power in their country (France for example),
strenghtening the nationalistic movements. I have a strong feeling that
the UK is going to withdraw from the European Union sometime in the
beginning of the next century, as well as Sweden and Denmark.
Egypt is never going to be a member of the EU, but the palistinian might
if they are accepted into the Commonwealth. Isreal is also a much more
natural candidate than Egypt, IMHO.

Keep Brazil independent of the others, IMO.

I have a problem with giving coorporations to much power as regulations
become more and more complex and strict. Take a look at EU and all its law
and regulations on monopoly and to large marketshares. Consumerrights are
important and it will always be the nations or unions of nations that take
care this.

That is a very interesting idea. Very in character for Terrans.

    'body' => '	Just ran the seventh session of my latest campaign, titled
Traveller: Beyond The Pale.  Here\'s the post-game summary:

The Cast:

Amr Santayema: a young and sneaky merchant, played by the TML\'s own Ross
Coburn, who\'s giving their (highly corrupt) lawyer a hard run for the
Biggest Crook On Board Prize.

Lt Kehaaarl: An Aslan ex-marine.  Big, bad, furry.  Played by the TML\'s
Jason Jones.

Sir Loreni Vilash: Vilani merchant from a poor family whose trading acumen
led him to a knighthood.

Perlis Dalal: a muscular female ex-scout, who strangely enough wound up
being the major shareholder.  Played by the TML\'s Glenn Grant.

Elo Lezaar, a highly geeky Vilani ex-Navy sensors and electronics tech.  He
mumbles, collects meditation rugs and gravitationally abuses bees, and is
played by TML\'er Sebastien Normandin.

Lt. Kurek: A tall, blond, shades-wearing former Navy gunner who\'ll be
manning the nuke damper and serving margaritas to the passengers.



	Last week, things finally came to head on Mishegaan III, but they
nevertheless managed to get to jump point with a cargo (after Sir Loreni
made a daring high-G escape).


	As Sir Loreni, suffering from bloodshot eyes, extreme fatigue,
ruptured capilliaries, and other G-induced symptoms, watched, Perlis fired
up the jump drive and dropped the Versailles and its crew of tired,
injured, and stressed-out merchants into jumpspace.  After entry had taken
place nominally, various crewmembers wandered off to their quarters to
unwind, which in Kehaaarl\'s case involved inventorying, stripping, and
cleaning the contents of the weapons locker.

	Amr, however, had other plans.  After ensuring that they were
alone, he broached the subject of the jettisonable programmable transponder
he had stolen from the FSY Moonshine RI/ESS that Sir Loreni had made his
escape in, breaking his leg in the process.  He proposed that he sell the
extremely valuable and highly illegal device to the company in return for
15% of the company\'s shares.    The deal he proposed was non-optimal;
however, Perlis, not being a businessperson, didn\'t quite realize this.

	At that point, however, he was interrupted by a comm ping from Elo.
Elo, acting on a complaint from a passenger that there was an unpleasant
smell in their stateroom, had investigated.  After determining that the
smell appeared to be emanating from the ventilation duct, he\'d sent a small
waldobot into the ventilation ducts to see what was the problem.  After
exploring the ducts, he\'d come across a decomposing human head in one of
them.

	Startled by his disgusting find, he called Amr and proceeded to use
the waldobot to drag the head down to a point where it could be removed.
With Kehaaarl, as chief of security, supervising, they bagged the head and
brought it up to the sickbay.  As their passenger included a doctor fleeing
the insurection on Mishegaan III, they asked him for his assistance.  The
doctor, after taking numerous tissue samples and running various forensics
tests, determined that the head had been decomposing for approximately two
weeks, and that sometime at or around the time of death had been
deep-frozen.

	After some discussion, it was decided to put the head in a bag and
blow it out an airlock upon their emergence from jumpspace.  Kehaaarl,
meanwhile, proceeded to investigate.  He discovered that the head had
belonged to a member of the Versailles\' former crew, a gunner, who had
apparently jumped ship on the Versailles\' last stop prior to jumping into
Mishegaan, where it had been repossessed.  A search of the ship revealed
nothing save a case of alcoholic beverages stored in a low berth and some
packets of a blue crystalline powder that turned out to be a highly illegal
drug tucked into the same area of the vents as the head had been.

	Meanwhile, Amr continued pestering Perlis, who finally agreed to
put the deal before a shareholders\' meeting.  As all the shareholders (with
the exception of the late Dame Iliana, whose estate was in any case
represented by her manager, Onyas Sedducha) were on board, this went
forwards, with a slight delay due to the fact that Mr. Sedducha was found
in a drug-induced torpor in his quarters, much to the amusement of some of
his fellow passengers.

	The meeting, however, was something of a bust, as the extreme
dislike between Amr and Liontzel Huutzaa, whom Amr accused of having
cheated him out of several million credits (if you recall, Huutzaa had
prevented Amr from swindling Sir Loreni, or at least partially prevented
him from doing so, at the beginning of the campaign).  Huutzaa raised
several cogent objections to the deal, Amr threatened to shoot Huutzaa, Sir
Loreni had to pull a gun in order to calm everyone down, and the whole
thing fell apart in considerable acrimony.

	Shortly thereafter, Huutzaa pinged Perlis and suggested an
alternative deal to her, one which would allow the company to acquire the
transponder, her to keep her majority, and Amr to obtain an increase of 15%
in his shareholdings (the transponder being of course an extremely valuable
item to anybody wishing to operate outside the law).  This was eventually
agreed upon, although the minority shareholders, who were somewhat hosed by
the deal, were not entirely pleased.

	The rest of the jump proceeded relatively uneventfully; tensions
were high down in the passenger quarters, as the two former Ling Security
lieutenants  cut their former commander dead at every opportunity, the
doctor and his family avoided the lot of them, and Huutzaa was snidely
above it all.  Mr. Sedducha kept more or less to his stateroom, regularly
dosing himself into insensibility.  The week was passed with the Ling
lieutenants gambling continuously and discussing their former boss\'s
personal hygiene habits in front of him as if he wasn\'t there.

	At emergence minus three hours, all crew were at their stations,
their light banter tempered by the usual expectancy.  Right on schedule,
the ship emerged from jumpspace, and the bridge crew discovered that the
old dictum "In space nobody can hear you scream" was not entirely true:

	Rather than the usual starscape, what appeared before them was a
vast, dazzlingly brilliant surface several kilometers across that was
triggering their anti-collision alarms and which they were closing with at
the rate of about 500 meters a second on an unavoidable collision
trajectory, with impact in five seconds.  To compound the horror of their
situation, their attack alarms also began screaming, indicating that the
ship was being illuminated by a strong coherent light source.  Panic ensued.

	However, five seconds later the Versailles simply punched right
through what proved to be a large light sail.  Some investigation proved
that it was hauling what appeared to be an unmanned cargo pod and was being
pushed by large lasers located on the system\'s second planet.  Over the
next fifteen minutes, sensor scans indicated a fair amount of TL-9
activity; several orbiting habitats, some NERVA fission drive ships,
numerous artificial satellites, some solar sail craft, ground-to-space
spaceplanes, and so forth.  They decided to head for a large double-toroid
geosynchronous habitat.

	Shortly thereafter, they began picking up a broadcast directed
towards them; Elo put it on speakers.  It sounded like an odd mixture of
Mandarin and Vilani with considerable linguistic drift thrown in.  After
some discussion, they decided to respond with the following message in High
Vilani"This is the Imperial merchant vessel Versailles, Sir Loreni Vilash
commanding.  We come in peace, with intent to trade".

	Approximately half an hour after that, they began recieving a
broadcast in High Vilani; the locals had roused the head of the Vilani
department at a university out of his bed and put him in front of a mike
and camera.  Dialogue was begun; the professor was thrilled not only at the
news of the reformation of the Imperium, but also at the fact that after 40
years of teaching a dead language, he was all of a sudden getting some
serious respect.  Cultural and linguistic data were exchanged.  After a
while the professor handed them off to a graduate student as he was to
board a spaceplane to rendezvous with them at the geosynchronous habitat.
And we ended with them arriving at the habitat and discovering that
incompatible docking hardware was going to make an EVA transfer a
neccessity.



	Next game will probably be in a couple of weeks.  I start bar
school and a job at a nice firm downtown pretty soon, and so I\'m not sure
when or how often we\'ll be able to play again.  However, if and when we
continue, I\'ll post the summaries.

Executive Summary, Sociological Report, Maaliikaa:
Huutash Guudaagash, IISS, IY60.

	Although originally first explored by Vilani scouts during the
first Human exploration of the Shugilli cluster a few centuries after the
founding of the Ziru Sirkaa, its distance (3 parsecs from the Mishegaan
system, itself 2 parsecs from the nearest Main) out into the Great Rift was
a deterrent to its settlement for millenia; it was only after the Vilani
developed Jump-2 that settlement of the Shugilli cluster began.  Even then,
the extended travel times to the rest of the Ziru Sirkaa, three weeks and
two jumps, one to a deep space refuelling depot between Mishegaan and the
cluster, were an impediment to its rapid development.

	As well, Mishegaan\'s climate was rather marginal for a human
colony.  A high surface gravity of 1.15 G\'s, an atmospheric pressure of 2.7
Imperial norm, pronounced greenhouse conditions, a high average
temperature, and absence of large landmasses (Maaliikaa\'s surface is over
97% water) combined to make it a mere refuelling stop for some time.

	However, Maaliikaa was host to a wide variety of aquatic life
forms, the most important from the human point of view being numerous
species of mammoth marine plants.  Collectively called "Jumigaash" by the
Vilani settlers, rooted forms grew in vast beds wherever the ocean
shallowed out to 80 meters or less.  Other variants formed free-drifting
pelagic beds, some reaching sizes of tens of thousands of kilometers
across.  Their photosynthetic processes geared more towards the infrared
end of the spectrum, giving them a dark-brown to black colour, these plants
and their ancestors had been thriving in Maaliikaa\'s warm and fertile seas
for hundreds of millions of years.

	So aside from providing a variety of ecological niches for
thousands of forms of marine life forms, and useful organic raw materials
for human industry, they had also provided Maaliikaa with mammoth reserves
of fossil hydrocarbons (enough to support moderate extraction rates for
millenia), which although long obsolete as a fuel for the technologically
advanced Ziru Sirkaa, was still valuable for several industrial purposes
such as the manufacture of some plastics and food synthesis.  Thus, oil
extraction became the driving force behind the Ziru Sirkaa\'s colonization
of Maaliikaa during the last century prior to contact with the Terrans; it
became the bread and plastics basket of the cluster.  Aquatic towns based
on clusters of large, mobile oil drilling platforms began their
peregrinations about the planet, and spaceports were constructed on the two
islands large enough to support them.

	This role it continued to fill during the Second Imperium.
However, the Long Night came early to the Shugilli cluster; the last Rule
Of Man starship to depart Maaliikaa downport did so in IY -1760.  By then,
however, the social changes that were to preserve Maaliikaan society in a
stable form throughout the Long Night were well under way.

	In IY -1802 one Deng Kwan Tung had succeeded to the office of
System Governor under the Rule Of Man.  A Solomani of Chinese extraction,
he was extremely well-versed in the classics of Chinese philosophy;
Confucius\'s Analects, Emperor Mao\'s Little Red Book, Li Shung Li\'s
Reunificationist Essays, to name but a few.  A Sinologist and sociologist
of no mean standing, he found himself ruling a system whose population
consisted largely of Vilani and more recently arrived Chinese; the Terran
nation China it will be recalled was the source of a remarkably large
percentage of Terran expatriates during the Solomani expansion.

	Tung naturally began to study Vilani culture and mores.  By all
accounts an open-minded individual, he discovered not only the well-known
similarities between traditional Chinese culture and the Vilani Way, he
also found much of the Vilani Way greatly admirable.  A rather daring
indivdual, with ambitions on a rather grander scale than most
administrators, he began to concieve of a culture that was a synthesis of
all that was best in both the Chinese and Vilani cultures.

	It has been said of the Second Imperium that it had much the effect
on the Vilani as a sword slicing through a pool of still water; it caused a
few ripples which subsided after the blade had passed, leaving only still
water in its wake.  What Tung put into action was rather like adding sea
water to the pool; an admixture occurred, initially causing ripples,
ripples that eventually subsided into a clear pool.  However, the still,
stable waters of Maaliikaan society were now somewhat different; elements
of Confucianist values, Imperial Chinese governmental structures and
traditional Sino-capitalism had been added to the Vilani caste system,
collectivist social values, and conservatism.  Public ritual elements from
both cultures were fused.  Stringent anti-discrimination and ethnic quota
systems were put in place to ensure that neither group was frozen out of
power.  Regulations encouraging exogamy between the two groups and
sanctioning endogamy were put in place, with the result that within a
half-dozen generations one oculd speak no more of Vilani and Chinese, but
only of Maaliikaani.  The result was a society that seems to have remained
stable throughout the Long Night, and maintained a respectably high tech
level in the process.

	However, the result, while possibly appealing to extreme Chinese or
Vilani conservative social thinkers, was also a somewhat rigid, patriarchal
and authoritarian society.  Maaliikani government and justice are hardly
libertarian; government is headed by a figurehead First Official, and
administered by a hierarchy of fifteen ranks of Officials.  The First
Official is a hereditary and ceremonial post; the Fifteenth Rank of
Officials are neighbourhood-level headsmen.  Justice is administered by
specially assigned Twelfth Rank officials sitting as extremely powerful
judges/chiefs of police, and law enforcement is the responsibility of a
constabulary formed of Officials of the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Rank.
Accession and promotion to Office is done by a complex system based on
caste and examinations which remains to be studied.

	Within the extended family unit, the basic element of Maaliikaani
society, authority is likewise hiearchified, with authority descending from
the parents down to the children in order of birth.  Thus,
great-grandparents are greatly revered, while younger children have little
or no influence over household matters.

	Geographically, Maaliikaa is a water world.  Most human settlement
has taken place in the southern hemisphere, where several large shallow
areas, which would be mountain ranges and high plateaus were they not
submerged, and several small islands (the largest being 450 km^2) have
permitted the construction of several large permanent anchored structures
and large cities.  The islands are completely urbanized, with the exception
of one smaller one near the seat of government which serves as a Class F
spaceport.  20 large agglomerations of anchored and floating structures,
called stilt cities, constructed around ancient Vilani permanent anchored
oil extraction platforms, are dotted around the south pole within a circle
of approximately 30 degrees of latitude.  As well, numerous free-floating
habitats of various sizes and structures roam the oceans, and there are
numerous fishing and oil extraction stations dotted about the more
temperate regions of both hemispheres.

	Currently, Maaliikaa appears to have remained at TL-9 for some
centuries, with the exception of gravitics, which are rare if non-extant.
Several other planetary bodies in the Shugilli system are colonized, with
interplanetary travel based on fusion rocket and solar sail technology.
Ground-to-space travel from Maaliikaa is generally based on TL-9 AZHRAE
spaceplane transit.  Numerous types of transport aircraft, watercraft, and
submersibles are in use on the planet surface; Lift-Activator Disk
rotary-winged aircraft are particularly favoured, as they function
extremely well in Maaliikaa\'s dense atmosphere.  Given the planet\'s massive
hydrocarbon reserves, much propulsion technology is based on these fuels.
However, there are many relic and locally constructed fusion plants extant,
which reduce Maaliikaani consumption of their fossil fuel reserves.

	Militarily, Maaliikaa is relatively weak in terms of surface
forces; a small navy serves search-and-rescue and anti-piracy roles, and
the constabulary seems to serve as a reserve force supplementing the small
army.  It has been decades since any greater disturbance than minor rioting
has occurred.  Survey team reports have indicated the presence of what
appear to be TL-9 SDBs in the system, but their numbers and combat
effectiveness remain unknown.

Maalikaani Technology Sampler

Vehicles:


	The following represents a selection of vehicles which covert Scout
teams were able to examine closely.  It should be noted that aside from
these vehicles, a wide range of water craft (generally either multihulled
SWATH configurations or submersibles) is in use.  Vehicle manufacturing is
largely unregulated, and numerous models and variants of all common types
of TL-9 vehicles (with the notable exception of grav vehicles, which appear
to be unknown on Maaliikaa) are in service.


Shenduughash Ka Shing Aerial Conveyances Ruby Bird LAD

	The Ruby Bird is built by the aerospace manufacturer Shenduughash
Ka Shing Aerial Conveyances (SKSAC).  Its streamlined 140 displacement ton
slab-shaped hull is slung between 4 Lift Activator Disks mounted fore and
aft on either side of the hull, hung from short airfoil cross-section
reverse gull-winged wings.  The bulbous, glass-encased cockpit is slung low
and slightly forward, giving it a rather droopnosed appearance; aft the
hull tapers backward towards a Y-configuration vertical stabilizer.

	Twin passenger entry doors, mounted at mid-hull and opening onto
the back of the passenger compartment, allow access to the passenger
compartment.  The passenger areas are slightly roomier than is the norm for
comparable aircraft.  Emergency exit hatches are placed in the ceilings of
the cockpit and passenger compartments in case of ditching at sea (98.2% of
Maliikaa\'s surface is water).  A 16 m^3 cargo compartment, accessed by a
side-opening small cargo hatch, is emplaced aft of the passenger
compartment.  4 3.625 Mw MHD power plants are emplaced in the hull at the
base of the wing roots; fuel storage is along the underside of the hull.
Landing gear consist of 4 short retractable landing legs with sturdy pads.

Rampant Phoenix HTOHL AZHRAE Orbiter.

	Built by AgnaashKa Li, another aerospace manufacturer, the Rampant
Pheonix is a typical tri-mode (turbojet/ramjet/rocket) AZHRAE spaceplane of
a configuration found across the Imperium at similar tech levels.  However,
its payload and passenger capacity is somewhat lower than the norm due to
Maaliikaa\'s dense atmosphere and high gravity.  These factors also force an
inflight refuelling prior to switching into ramjet mode.

Shenduughash Ka Shing Aerial Conveyances Silver Cloud Transport Airship

	The Silver Cloud is quite possibly the largest lighter-than-air
craft ever built on a human-occupied world.  A truly gigantic
airfoil-envelope, turbofan propelled airship, it has a wingspan of 700
meters, and its gondola, running the length of the craft\'s keel, is 110
meters long. It derives 5,000 tons of lift from the envelope; its airfoil
configuration permits it to lift 9,000 tons at a takeoff speed of 40 kph.
Propulsion consists of 40 turbofans rated at 5.8 tons of thrust apiece,
slung along the underside of the envelope.  Gimballed mountings permit VTOL
takeoff even when loaded over its envelope lift capability.

	It has fuel capacity for 60 hours flight at full consumption,
giving it a range of 13,500 kilometers.  It carries a flight deck crew of
12 (sitting in 8-hour watches in the 4 flight deck crewstations), 595
passengers, and 50 stewards.  It is able to deadlift 1,770 tons of cargo,
5,770 in airfoil mode.  Aside from the 300 small staterooms and 50 large
staterooms, it also has 200 displacement tons dedicated to lounges, dining
rooms, and recreation facilities.  It also has a 10-workstation engineering
space and is significantly overpowered, rendering it more easily piloted in
the high winds frequently encountered on Maaliikaa.

	It is generally used as a bulk cargo and passenger hauler
(all-passenger versions are in service) for connecting far-flung outposts
with greater speed than by submersible.  Its range can be significantly
extended by exploiting favourable winds; as Maaliikaa has a singularly deep
atmosphere, with rather complex, multilayered wind dynamics, in some
circumstances when operating in deadlift mode pilots are able to fly
unpowered for great distances.

Diguushuda Wan Tai Submersibles Muukaash-class submersible rover

	Named after a local species of bottom feeder, the Muukash is a
rather unusual aquatic rover, designed for operations in conditions where
surface or submersible operations are rendered difficult by heavy
concetrations Juumigash, or around the bases of stilt cities.  Apparently,
several variants are in service.  A boxy 10td tracked submersible vehicle,
it has cramped accomodations for 8 passengers in the form of eight folding
bunks, four passenger seats, four seats in the control compartment,
extremely compact kitchen and sanitary facilities, and 12 cubic meters of
lving space, variously configured.  15 cubic meters are provided for lab or
survey equipment.  It has two airlocks and 34 cubic meters of cargo space.
Provision is made for the mounting of remote controlled manipulator arms.
It is powered by a small TL-8 10Mw fission power plant.  Its tracks can
propel it at speeds of up to 99 kph on land (underwater performance specs
are unknown but estimated to be in the neighbourhood of 30 kph) and a set
of propellors serves as a secondary propulsion system capable of moving it
at 15 kph.  It has an armour rating of 9 throughout.  Price is 8.47 local
credits.




Weapons:

	Maaliikaani firearms design philosophy is unusual in that it tends
largely towards flechette ammuntion.  Whether this is for cultural reasons
or due to local reasons (such as dangerous life forms particularly
vulnerable to flechette rounds) is unknown.  However, the Maaliikaani Armed
Forces seem to be turning towards conventional slug rounds.  Despite their
previous ACR-equivalent\'s (a flechette carbine; see below) arguable
superiority over their current ACR, it has been replaced by a rather
unusual, and extremely heavy slug thrower/grenade launcher.  As well, their
current service sidearm is likewise a heavy semiautomatic slugthrower,
quite unlike the light, auto/burst fire police flechette sidearm.  Whether
this trend is due to a paradigm shift in weapons design, response to an as
of yet unknown threat, or simply due to corrupt procurement practices is as
of yet unknown.

	As Maaliikaa\'s Law Level is extremely high, and private possession
of armaments is highly illegal, it is unlikely that a significant number of
other weapons are being produced on-planet.

First problem... Unless the fabric is transparent, it\'ll absorb most of
the light that hits it. So you\'ll be heating the fabric. And possibly
damaging it.

Second problem. The air *is* transparent, and thus will absorb very,
very little heat from the focussed light.

So the problem is that to heat something with focused sunlight, it has
to be opaque, and preferrably dark colored. And it\'ll have to transfer
the heat to the air by conduction and radiation.

Specifically, the angular resolution of the sensors is poor. You can
detect the pulse at long ranges, but can\'t determine the direction it
came from closer than a few seconds of arc. Since the ship jumping in
(or out) only creates a single pulse, there\'s no chance to refine the
reading. You have to attempt to triangulate based on the readings from
sensors spread across the system. 

And with any reasonable amount of traffic, triangulation won\'t always
be easy. Does pulse 18458 at station AXC match up with pulse 16759 or
16760 at station BCD?

Ships that jump in at odd locations will be easier to spot, but harder
to localize. Ones that jump in never the 100 diameter limit can get
lost in the noise.

Nope. A single station can only report: Gravity pulse of magnitude XXX
at bearing YYY by ZZZ. Time hack TTT.TTTTT. Remember, the pulse obeys
the inverse square law. So a 100 ton ship at 1 AU gives the same pulse
strength as a 400 ton at 2 AU.

You have to take the readings from all the stations and try to match up
the vectors. Which includes allowing for lightspeed lag due to
differing distances from the source.

It\'s one thousand miles per *hour* (24,000 mile equatorial
circumference divided by 24 hours) or 450 m/sec. The boost from
launching with the earth\'s *orbital* velocity around the sun is about
30 km/sec.

At 1 g it takes 46 seconds to reach 450 m/sec. It takes 51 minutes to
reach 30 km/sec.

The equator is also useful for Launch Loops, and various rotating
tether designs. Once built, these will stay economical. It\'s still
going to be cheaper to pay for the electricity used in a launch loop
than for the fuel used in a 1 g drive. And the tethers don\'t use power
at all!

Well, G.Harry Stine did some figuring based on where the space(land)
and resources were, as well as where likely destinations for
fractional-orbit shuttles would be ("Great Circles and Spaceships, or,
Where is the Center of the World", Analog, May 1995). And the American
Southwest is a strong candidate.

For space launches that can use the advantages of being near the
equator, Hawaii isn\'t bad. And the US *does* own islnds (like Palmyra
atoll) that are even closer to the equator.

The US was stupid enough to sign that one. Space enthusiasts managed to
keep us from repeating the mistake with the treaty about the Moon and
planets. 

The big roadblock with the Law of the Sea treaty is that you cannot
*own* a chunk of seabed. So is you find a rich deposit, somebody else
can walk right in and start mining. Also, the language in the treaty
that says the resources on the seafloor belong to *all* nations just
about guarantees that your seafloor production could get severely
"taxed" for the benefit of third world countries.

   True enough.  Some of the Spanish missionaries accompanying the
expeditions across the Americas reported the disappearance of whole
communities of Native-Americans due to disease.  Total casualty rates
from the pandemic for the Americas as a whole vary from 25% to 33%.  How
many billion people would 1 in 4 Vilani be at the time of the
Interstellar Wars?

   Should the Terrans engage in biological warfare, I\'m sure the Vilani
would be able respond in kind.  Bugs that have DNA structures we can\'t
begin to figure out that like to wreak havoc on humans just as well as
alien life forms.  While bio agents would be tempting for the Terrans to
use, the retaliation they would suffer won\'t be worth it.

   Probably one of the most Traveller-like (especially TNE) series ever
made.  I kept expecting to see Hivers in a scene, but none appeared
(which of course means nothing when you are talking about Hivers, since
they are masters of hiding behind the scenes...).

   If I were writing the material, there would be a discussion of what
the \'PTB\' really know in the Referee\'s Section, and eventually a
campaign (a set of three scenarios) in which the PCs stumble upon the
truth.  At that point they have to decide whether to keep it quiet, or
go public, knowing that if they do so they stand a chance of not being
believed and being subjected to imprisionment or institutionalization

Actually, some of the Inca subjects who were in less densely populated
areas suffered less, but in the main Inca areas the death rate was 11 out
of 12 people after 70 years.  Of course, much of this was due to lowered
disease resistance and out-right murder by the Spanish.  One interesting
fact is that the Inca empire was actually inherently much more stable than
the Aztecs.  The few Spanish who invaded would not normally have been able
to conquer them.  However, a few years before the Spanish arrived there
smallpox and other diseases had been brought down from the north, and
almost 50% of the Inca population was already dead by the time the Spanish
arrived.  At this point the resulting social chaos made a Spanish victory
easy. 

I\'d imagine that the Solomani victory would be similar.  In many cases, a
Solomani fleet jumps in expecting a battle with the fleet of a populous
industrial world and find a world with 50%+ mortality who desperately need
medical supplies and will happily surrender to anyone with doctors. 

That would be a pretty grim era to game...

Actually I\'ve seen articles on solar powered balloons in Popular Science
Magazine.  They work and the they exist, no mirrors needed.  The most
efficient design uses a double balloon envelope, the outer one is
transparent, the inner one is black and there is a good deal of space
between them.  The other design is tetrahedral (flat face upward) and all
black.  The second is simpler but less efficient.  Both work, but both
need 1.5 (for the first) to 2 (for the second) as much balloon volume per
kilogram lifted.  These designs have actually been built and used.

My previous explanation was too brief.  Using mirrors or lenses will allow you to 
concentrate the sunlight energy onto a small area, but does not increase the 
total energy at all.  A balloon 15 m in diameter will absorb a lot of sunlight 
energy ... similar to that collected by a 15 m diameter mirror.  The mirror 
allows you to focus the energy onto a small region (and so allow you to cook a 
steak or ten in that small region).  Focussing sunlight into the balloon will not 
give you the effect you want - only a very small region is heated up, and this 
hot air will quickly mix with the rest of the air in the balloon.  Now, if you 
had a volcanoe-crater sized mirror, you could fly the balloon, but how are you 
going to keep this mirror pointed at the baloon when it flies 500 m away?

So, the laws of physics tell me that simple mirror-heating will not lift the 
balloon.  To take another analogy, using a magnifying glass you can burn a tiny 
spot on your hand (foolish, I know), but it does not cause your entire body to 
burn up!  Using mirrors to focus sunlight will heat up a tiny portion of the 
balloon - but far too little to lift the balloon.  On the other hand, if I had a 
large solar furnace (with a veritable farm of mirrors stetched over the desert), 
I can focus them into a spot that will neatly melt a block of metal (or burn a 
man) ... this was used in some film or other (a James Bond movie?).


I do not know what resources the characters have, so I cannot come up with a 
solution to their dilema.  One thing that came to mind was filling the ballon 
with 100\'s of sheeps stomachs filled with hydrogen (from the life raft fuel or 
from electolysis of water using the power from the life raft\'s juty-rigged power 
plant).  Of course, the hydrogen will be slowly leaking out, so they had better 
find some friendlier natives PDQ.

I looked through the counters of Invasion:Earth, The Solomani have ground forces 
ranging from TL-14 to 11, the Imperials from TL-14 to 13, so it would be reasonable 
to assume that Terra, as capital of the Confederation would have been at TL-14 - 15 
at the time of the attack.

As a side note, one of the Solomani Army counters is labeled \'Ihathi\' (sp?) - Aslan 
fighting for Solomani - amazing what those furballs will do for land!

2300AD canon has established that you can get atoms to tunnel, and that the only
reason why this was not discovered by earlier physicists was that the effect is
adversely affected by gravitational fields. In other words, we had to break free
of the Earth and get into space in order to discover the Jerome effect.

The (a) part may be unnecessary - the holes may simply be big enough in the
absence of a gravitational field. =

I can coordinate many particles inside a magnetic field to align and move=

simultaneously, and I have not violated Heisenberg to do so. I can force
many electrons to flow down a copper wire at the same time without
violating Heisenberg. Both of these are particle effects on the macroscop=

Same with Stutterwarp in 2300AD. There you can induce a whole ship to
move when placed in a field. I suspect that Heisenberg doesn\'t matter the=
re
either - I align the "holes" in space time by placing them in a strong

field, and the ship then "topples" through the holes to the destination.

In real life, you are correct. However, just like J-space =

is accepted Traveller canon, atom tunnelling is accepted
2300AD canon. Dr. Jerome, the inventor of the stutterwarp =

drive, managed to induce a hydrogen atom to jump. This =

understanding of physics.

Actually, a magnetic ( or any other field ) does not affect everything
equally. Sure,
there are equipotential contours within the field, but the field itself
varies with distance
from the source.

It\'s not the analogy, it\'s the explanation. Stutterwarp uses the electron=

But the laws that govern flight are universal. Both the bird and the 747

implementation is actually not that different - both have aerofoils, both=

are streamlined to minimize drag, both have tailplanes to provide better

This whole pocket universe thing is flawed in my opinion. To create a

the

I seriously doubt that Yaskoydray would have had the ability to create ma=

pocket universes, and in any case he certainly would not have had the
ability
to do so to start with. Also, Traveller Canon suggests that he created on=
ly
two or so =

pocket universes - one in the Regina system, and one elsewhere about the
Droyne homeworld. The sheer energy required to achieve this effect must
have
been incredible, and I doubt that Grandfather would have had the resource=
s
to build a pocket universe to order for every single jump route in known
space.
Also, would this mean that jump drives only work in areas visited by the
Ancients ?
If so, one would expect Jump Drives to fail once beyond the borders of th=
e
old Ancient domain. The Zhodani Core Expeditions may have been a non
starter if they had not followed the Ancient routes to the Core, if this
was the case.

A pocket universe depends on the small power output from a Jump Drive ? S=

Hmm. I admit that I do not like the 2D maps of Traveller, but then it\'s
a necessary abstraction of reality to make the game playable, rather
than to fit in with some theory of Jump Drive.

The "Kessel run" quote is simply a classic example of sci-fi getting =

by George Lucas as a unit of speed. There are other examples
of such things in Star Wars ( X-Wings perform tight acrobatic

There\'s nothing wrong with that. Everyone interprets Traveller as they
see it, and there\'s no reason why my view of FTL travel should be any
more correct than anyone elses, including yours. FTL is science fiction,
not science fact, and so the discussion is largely moot anyhow.

Well, actually, no. The people who suffered from the Black Death did
*not* have a good understanding of the germ theory of disease. I don\'t
know whether its in "Plagues & Peoples" or not, but evidently the germ
theory really didn\'t become accepted until well after the development
of the microscope! People saw all the little "animalicules" and never
made the connection ... and for a lot of diseases, the obvious
quarantine method of isolation for a specified period of time do not
work ... as the incubation period varies a lot, and for many diseases
the person can be a carrier (infectious) all the time and yet never
get sick.

As I recall, the final "proof" of the connection between dirt, filth,
germs and disease was basically statistical ... surveys of Choler
outbreaks in London and Germany that were plotted on maps according to
where the water was drawn.

Given that the Vilani have computers, there seems some likelihood that
they would be able to figure things out reasonably quickly.

And the problem here is, again, the rate of infection, not the rate of
death (or, indeed, the percentage exposed who actually get sick). Even
something like Bubonic plague is not 100% transmissible ... Influenza
and Pnuemonic Plague, both transmitted by aerosol means, would be
widely transmitted ... but the statistical methods above mean that the
Vilani would soon pick up on this ... seeing how it was transmitted in
a sealed environment.

And the Vilani have *some* germs ... even if only the e coli and the
like in their gut. Some of those -- and the other "minor" human races
they contacted in the times before First Contact with the would have
certainly (on a statistical basis) have found *something*
objectionable about each other\'s germs ... so they should have some
experience in the AAB at least, to fall back on.

Interesting thought ... what about "prions" ... the little beasties
that cause Creutzfeld-Jakob disease (aka "Mad Cow Disease" or
"Scrapie"). As I understand it, they aren\'t even really a disease ...
just some protein molecules that do the damage. It seems reasonably
likely that there would eventually be some sort of crossover in Vilani
herd beasts ... and, in any case, Vilani economics surely mean that
they would have developed the Germ Theory of disease for their herd
beasts -- that is, keeping them alive when some of their native
diseases hit *them* even if they did not affect the Vilani.

So it seems that they would have the idea of quarantine at least.

Perhaps. Perhaps not. I don\'t think its as certain as you think -- it
is just as likely, for example, that the Vilani will be different
enough from Terran stock to prove most unpalatable to Terran diseases
.... in other words, it seems just as likely that the Vilani would be
immune.

If *I\'m* making assumptions (and I admit I am), please recognise the
ones that are being made by those on "your" side as well! Fair\'s fair.

Then, of course, the reverse is true. Even the "benign" e coli in a
Vilani gut *could* be lethal to a Terran.

I vaguely recall reading (many years back) that it appeared that the
instabilities in the early "magnetic mirror" and toroidal reactors
would be controllable *if* we could afford to build them big enough (I
recall a figure along the lines of 10 or 12 km for the magnetic mirror,
and something similarly oversized for the toroid). Anybody know if this
is just a science writer misunderstanding, or if it\'s actually based on
real projections?

I\'ve played around with the idea of a planet coming out of the Long
Night and re-inventing fusion this way. They build an asteroid hulled
ship around the magnetic mirror reactor (all 12 km long by a good
fraction of a km wide). Waste plasma is used as a fusion rocket drive.
It can also generate some pretty hellacious particle beams. It was
originally built to process asteroids by cutting them up into
"manageable" chunks (ie a few hundred meters on a side) and feeding the
chunks into a side reactor where they get turned into plasma and the
elements seperated in what amounts to an overgrown mass spectrograph.

Picture the Imperials encountering *that* system. Or a Pocket Empire
deciding to raid the "low tech" culture. :-)

Australia already *has* space capability. They havde launched

Brazil is a major industrial country, and growing fast.

They can already do launches to geosynch orbit.

India has launched their own satellites on their own boosters. (Note,

that can launch a satellite will work as an ICBM with merely some

I don\'t know a lot about Inonesia, but as far as industrial capacity

Japan has a space program, with a fair number of satellite launches and
eventual plans for manned launches. They are even working on a scaled

because the military insisted).

South Korea is another up and coming industrial nation.

There were attempts to set up a commercial launch site in Zaire back in
the 70s & 80s, and it\'s speculated that the Cuban forces invading the
country were mostly to stop it. (Russia wasn\'t fond of the idea of a
German owned launch site...)

Nigeria isn\'t any sillier than the ESA launch site in Guyana(sp?).

Chile is awfully poor. And the terrain is the pits for transport.
Remember, a spaceport needs good transportation links.

G-hours are a measure of how much velocity change the missile can do. A
10 G hour missile can do 10 g for 1 hour (assuming the engine can give
that much thrust), 1 g for 10 hours, 2 g for 5 hours, etc. 

The ships are likewise limited in how much fuel they have, unless they
are using thruster plates.

Anybody playing an SF game that doesn\'t know what a light second is had
better diversify their reading a bit. A light-second is the distance
light travels in one second. It\'s fairly useful for measuring distances
on the scale needed.

A lot of those assumptions are more likely that the reader is familiar
with science and technology, not TNE.

FF&S2 is *not* combat rules. In fact, one of the major handicaps in
working on it was that IG couldn\'t give us a combat system. That meant
that we couldn\'t give ranges, distances, times and damage in "game"
terms, but had to either give them in real world terms (like G hour and
light second) or stick with the old TNE values (like armor value) that
they said would be usable in the new combat system (whenever they get
it written).

Sorry, but if you want "hard SF" then you are stuck with formulas and
calculators. SSDS and QSDS are *simplified* versions of FF&S.
Simplified so that you only need to add and do a little multiplying.

Again, there is no combat system in FF&S2. The values like G-hours are
there so people can use the designs with whatever combat system they
have currently and so that when IG *does* come out with a combat
system, it\'ll be relatively simple to convert them to it.

Microseconds are a real unit of time. G-hours is simply a
*self-explanitory* term for how much accel for how long. Mind you, IG
said that they\'d explain terminology, and it appears that they didn\'t
bother. <sigh> In any case FF&S2 is *supposed* to be for the "techy"
types. If you want a system that follows reality (which is what the
term "hard sf" *means*) then it *has* to be complex, simply because
reality is complex.

Don\'t blame the book for not being what you want whernm what you want
isn\'t what the book is supposed to be. If you want simple, then use
SSDS or QSDS. If you want to get "down and dirty" with the nitty-gritty
details, then you have to be prepared to learn how to use the system.

    How are you planning to handle the differences in Tech Levels?  TL2-3
Armorer is going to know how to craft chain and plate mail from scratch, swords
and perhaps up to flintlock firearms.  However I seriously doubt he\'s going to
have a CLUE as to how to handle Battle Dress.  And the situation is reversed, a
TL13 Armorer is going to look at a suit of plate mail and go "Huh?!?"
    IMHO this is a bit too broad for the TL spread, it needs to account for it
in some way shape or form.

    How are you planning to handle the styles of use of these various blade
weapons?  FoEx; a Japanese Katana and a 18th Century Naval Cutlass are
functionally similar weapons but how they are welded in the hands of an
experienced swordsman makes all difference in the world!  Also you have to deal
with the theory and practice of HOW to use the blade and that varies widely by
culture and even region here on Earth.
    In Asia the tendency it to present the full body, bringing all the weight
and power to bear in order to kill the opponent and move on to the next target.
The Europe however the tendancy is to present a side profile, minimizing target
area and thus dragging out the combat.  This effects what types of bladed
weapons are used.  Again in Asia because of the tendancy for full body exposure
the weapons tend less towards the point and more on the heavy slash for swift
killing and crippling strokes.  Whereas in Europe the preference for side
profile led to the development of the Rapier, a point weapon designed for reach
and penitration to vital organs.
    These are generalizations OC, but they do tend to make my point.  Not all
swords are created equal or used in the same manner for the same purposes.

	That long? I came to this conclusion ages ago. I feel very ripped-off
after having bought Starships and First Survey, and it doesn\'t seem as if
things have improved as much as they ought to. I only bought Pocket Empires
because a few said it was that good, and after buying and reading it, I
have to agree, despite a few minor bugs that I can work around.

	However, I can not make myself spend any more money on IG products unless
I see at least three or four people say that a particular product is really
excellent. The stuff that Andy Lilly\'s Bits / Core group produces is most
worthy, and I have no hesitation in buying from them.

	Take "The Long Way Home".
	The diagrams are very good, compared to say Starships, which were appalling.
	The sequential nuggets of each adventure gives everything a structure that
makes it easy to find what you want. Although "Anomalies" is fine, why
wasn\'t this structure used in part here by IG?
	The tables are where they should be, with the main text that they pertain
to. They are not hidden in among a wealth of other tables, where you have
to flick backwards and forwards each time to find them.
	There are no major glaring omissions, like the Jump Drive table in T4, or
the Starship deckplan in M0.
	Plus too many other nice touches to mention.

	Why can\'t all Traveller things be this good!

	Fair enough, I take your point. What skill would you roll against here?
Wouldn\'t Perception help with the above example? (And maybe Recon too) I
don\'t think you could break Perception down, because by definition that
skill is generic in that you are looking for you don\'t know what, so you
can\'t be too specific in its general application anyway, not even in real
life (whatever that is ;-) )

I was reading some old CT stuff last night, and I came across Annic Nova...a
ship that does not require jump fuel. Instead, it has to charge up it\'s
accumulators for 1D6 weeks before jumping.

On the list, some people came up with the rather cool (I thought) "Hydrogen
Bubble" theory about jump fuel - but if you consider Annic Nova canon, it
appears that this cannot be the case. Does anyone know if the Ancient ship
in Secret of the Ancients requires H2?

I\'m trying to come up with a pseudo-technical description of J-drives,
including a description of the necessity of H2 and the size limit of
jump-capable vessels (the 100std limit).

Any ideas?

    'body' => 'Well, lots of ideas have been thrown out and I for one have had to take time
to pause and think. Just how vulnerable would the Vilani have been to Terran
diseases? How capable would they have been to responding to a biowar attack?
Could they have retaliated? Would the Terrans have used such weapons?

I\'m going to try to answer these one by one.

How vulnerable were the Vilani?
I think the answer is very. There are reference in V&V to the Plague of Duskir
which was basically just Terran diseases meeting Vilani in the normal course
of events. So one can start with the premis that Terran diseases are largely
compatable with the Vilani. The Vilani are seperated by 300,000 years from the
Terrans. This gives them all the immunities developed up till that point. But
as I understand it 300,000 years ago humans had not really moved out of Africa.
So the Vilani have not been in contact with the organisms from outside of
humanities cradle and those they have been in contact with have evolved more
than a little since then. So I think its fair to say that if left unchecked
Terran diseases would have a field day with the Vilani.

How capable were they of responding?
Probably a lot better than I originally thought. The Vilani do have some
diseases native to Vland (only a handful, but they would have a few); they
have animals who are vulnerable to native Vlandian pathogens; they would have
some pathogens of Terran origin on vland (if only the symbiotic organisms that
use them as host they brought from Terra); they have contacted other human
races who likely have a few diseases; they have contacted other non-humans who
are in their native environment. So I\'d say the Vilani know the basics. They
would know about quarantene, they would probaby know about antibiotics,
they possibly know about vaccination. Were the Vilani would fall down is in
identifing and rapidly responding to disease. There are big holes in Vilani
biological theory neccessitated by streaching to fit themselves into the
theories. They don\'t know about sterile operating proceadure, they don\'t have
any human antibiotics or vaccines. They probably don\'t know how to deal with
pandemics. So all up, I\'d say if a disease got a hold on a Vilani world, their
response would be limited to quarantene, hope and call for the veterinarians.
Vilani medicine is basically limited to trauma care.

Could they retaliate?
Well the Vilani doubtless have some nasty pathogens which would put a crimp in
a Terran\'s day. but they don\'t have many and they don\'t have the capacity to
geneer them. Also these diseases are likely to be effective against Vilani as
well and their own lack of medical technology would make it hard to develop
protective measures from their own bioweapons. What they do have is a whole
range of allergic biotoxins (the very food they eat is essentially toxic to
humans) and the have the normal range of common or garden chemical and nuclear
weapons. So while the Vilani can\'t respond in kind too well, they can respond.

Would the Terrans use the weapons?
The Terrans undoubtedly would develop bioweapons against the Vilani. They are
just too useful to ignore. However would they have actually used them? The
answer is probably a highly qualified yes. In the early wars the Vilani
capacity to retaliate with chemical and nuclear weapons is great. I\'d say that
the Terrans would hold off initially. If the Vilani used nukes against
civilian targets then the Terrans would probably have responded with bio
attacks to drive home the point that this was not a good idea. However when the
Terrans develop more advanced non-lethal bioagents, then I could see the
Terrans employing non-lethal bioagents against military targets.


So to wrap it all up, I\'ll give my take on the history of biowar during the
Interstellar Wars.

The Terrans first developed biowar agents during the later years of the First
Interstellar War. Intially these were not employed for fear of the Vilani
response. The first actual use of biowar agents came during the Third
Interstellar War. During the later stages of the war, the Vilani governor
launched a nuclear strike against the Terran colonies on Prometheus. In
response the Terrans launched a biowar attack on the Vilani world of
Mashaddun (deliberately chosen for its location deep in Vilani territory), and
made it clear that futher nuclear attacks would result in esculation. As a
result of this an informal deterance developed that was to last until the
8th War.

By the time of the 6th War the Terrans had developed effective non-lethal
agents. However again the fear of the Vilani response prevented their
deployment. These weapons were not deployed until the later stages of the 8th
War. By this time the Vilani capacity to respond was judged to be acceptable
and to speed up an end to the war the Terrans utilised these non-lethal agents
against military targets. Naturally the Vilani did attempt to retaliate with
nuclear weapons, but by this stage the collapse of effective resistance and the
Terran development of nuclear dampers made this much less of a threat than it
had once been. These non-lethal agents were again used during the 9th and Nth
Wars. During the Nth Wars there were also a few incidences of their employment
against civilian targets as the Vilani capacity to retaliate had simple ceased.

It should be noted that the Terran biowar program attracted particularly
vocal opposition from within the Confederation through out the Interstellar
Wars period.

I also believe that Harrier pilots (fixed wing VTOL) are required to
qualify on helos *and* jets before getting into the seat of the jump-jet.
When they tried to train pilots who were fixed-wing only their casualty
rates (human and equipment) jump to unacceptable levels.

I would suggest that \'aircraft\' skill is perfectly sufficient for game
purposes, and that modelling the varieties of required training is more
than the system needs to do.

Agreed!  In fact, since you know how hard fighting the Solomani were, it is
also reasonable to assume that both Imperial and Solomani TL15 regulars were
left out of the fight because they were heavily casualty prone from recent
fighting.  Remember that the seige of Earth is one of the _last_ events of
the war.  The Solomani units are probably just home guard reserves that they
had to drum up to defend Earth.

FWIW, the few times I ran things on the Solomani Rim, I used the zaibatsu

I tend to add a subskill defining the type of terrain the survival skill is
useful in (forest, desert, low-pressure, etc..)  I\'ve considered using the

My solution is to have the players put the TL they learned the skill at
after the skill name  (Armorer(TL3)-4, for example).  That way I can
penalize players who are using wildly different TL equipment.  Alsdo, it
can dilute skills down a bit, since a player might wish to have a PC who,
while being from a TL13 world, might have a hobby of racing TL7 ground
vehicles.

You can do this for most of the technical skills, and even skills like
Research and some of the other sciences.

The difference being that the church then raised or placed these girls, who
grew up and married.  In the areas under discussion, femal children are
being killed off.  What is goijg to happen in about 20 years when there is
a huge varience in the normal 54-46 female/male distrubution?  My biggest
fear is the social disruption as the hordes of men go looking for wives,
and the find that they have to fight over them.

Just about every war is followed by a surge in population growth, so war
isn\'t really an effective form of population control.  The only reason that
more men die in warfare is the fact that 90% of human cultures restrict
fighting to their men folk (which actually makes us the expendible ones.)

Anyway, we aren\'t talking about the sudden, random deaths caused by bombing
or shelling, the problem is the deliberate pre- or post partum elimination
of females due to a percieved uselessness of girls.

But the panic factor has to be accounted for.  The Vilani might be facing a
real epidemic for the first time in their history!  Something as simple as
chicken pox could devastate a world where no one has immunity.

Just so you know, chicken pox is actually a very nasty disease.. in adults
it can kill or cause sterility, and there is a form of it called shingels
which causes *exceedingly painful* nerve damage (I know this personally).
A palnet full of pox\'d Vilani would be in dire straights indeed, while the
immune Terrans would be almost powerless to help.

This might have been one of the real causes behind the quick exit of the
Rule of Man.  As epidemic after epidemic ravages through Vilani space, fear
of contact with outsiders and palnetary die backs would erode economic
development.  Finally, many worlds would either refuse any contact or just
go silent.. it could be that that fateful refusual to honor a monetary
issue came not from economic concerns, but fear of a pathogen on the currency!

After the Long Night, the die-back would be over and the surviving Vilani
would have most of the resitences that Solomani have, but it would have
easily assited in bringing down the RoM.

Others have commented on the e.coli situation, so I\'ll just pose a question
here.. what about genetic diseases?  My cancer is genetic in nature (a
result of bad coding for the lymphatic system), and I wonder if Yaskodray
might have fixed the DNA of the moved humans, or if they have the same
percentages of events like HD, Down\'s Syndrome, MD and the host of other
problems that come from bad genetic expression.

There are a few other milieux I would like to see first.  I would rather
see a revised M0, and then something like the M(several hundred) in which
the various emperors of the flag were scurrying about.  Less expansion,
more nobles running about being Napoleonic.

One I might find interesting is a milieu outside the 3I, like a Solomani
expansion to rimward, or a way way lost colony outside the Ziru Sirka\'s
influence.  This would change the patterns a bit to be more colonizing
empty worlds, rather than recontacting old ones.

Question for you, Marc--if the new task system is to be Stat + Skill 
lvl, and skill levels are increased to a range of 1-15, then how is 
a Difficult task going to be obtained with 2.5D?

With skill ranging from 1-15, your target numbers are going to be so 
high that 2.5D will be nothing.

These target numbers (the ones in your new system), on average, are 
about the same as used in my system, KBv2.0.  I have solved the 
problem with these high target numbers by using a series of whole 
dice.  You may consider changing your difficulty codes to 2, 3, 4, 5, 
6, and 7 dice like I have done in my system.  This will bring success 
rates into an acceptible range.

Or, maybe I\'m reading something wrong.  If so, can you explain it to 
me?

Thanks,

Kenneth.

I seem to recall that it did not.

At a certain tech level, you become capable of gating things into and out
of jump space via pocket universe technology.  For a brief period,
technologically, you can only gate in H2, as the strong nuclear force is
disrupted crossing the JS boundary.  (handwave handwave)

Even after interstellar teleportation becomes possible and easy, it still
requires a large pocket universe, and some hard to build hardware fairly
nearby, so if this remote fueling technology is feasible, it might be
useful over a larger distance.

The ancient ship and the Annic Nova both used this technology.  The AN did
used solar power, as then it did not need any outside sources, aside from a
teleporter dropped into a gas giant somewhere.

>I\'m trying to come up with a pseudo-technical description of J-drives,

The size thing I explained with space curvature.  Even if the vessel were
smaller, it would require a grid sized for a 100t ship and at least 10t of
hydrogen fuel.  The H2 is used to build an unstable pocket universe inside
jump space.

FWIW, I have stable pocket universes in jump space as a technology akin to
creating a more normal pocket universe, and thus not usually worth doing.
If Grandfather wanted, he could make a jump ship that needed no fuel, but
he has no need to.

If you do, and if others respond, PLEASE do not change the subject line.
During the last debate, I was annoyed enough to unsubscribe from the list.
By making the elements of the debate have a common subject, I can just
killfile this one discussion, rather than the participants.  Or the entire
list.  Many of the participants have useful to say on other subjects, but I
do not have the energy to go through another Great RoM Debate.  

(My annoyance last time was not about the challenge to generally held
beliefs, as that happens all the time.  It derived from the lack of debate
courtesy on the part of some participants.  Several people on both sides
were guilty of it, and it made the list very unpleasant.  Much like the
rashes of Marc-badgering that take place every now and then.  Pretty damn
childish.)

In my mind, after reading all of the references available, save S&A, I have
drawn my conclusions, and I would be utterly astonished if someone had any
new information to add.  You summarized two points of view, and I feel the
evidence best supports one of them.  Others may fall elsewhere, but I
suspect all has been said that needs to, and if the subject will not die,
then I am hoping that a mail filter will take me out of it.

Face it folks, this is not archeology, where there are new sources drawn
from the same information.  There is a finite, known set of Traveller
material, and by this point, I expect it has all been unearthed.  Anyone
can write something new which contradicts the past, but unlike archaeology,
such an action is likely a failure on the part of the author, rather than a
discovery.  Creativity comes in generating new information that does not
invalidate old information and previous games.  House rules are fine, as
long as they do not creep into published materials.

So? Lead/superdense line (& maybe polystyrene line) or even nuclear damp
the tunnel. It can\'t be *that* bad or they wouldn\'t allow operation on
planetary surfaces. In Traveller, the ship tean handle large solar flares
(I assume!) so it isn\'t necessarily a problem.

Leroy,

I would reverse the two proportions - Traveller is 95% background, else it

A bit like the cargo masters in the Norton Solar Queen books. (NB the

Hmm. Almost like stumbling on the fact that the Aslan aren\'t a major

Maybe in *your* church, Michael, but not in *my* church. Keep in mind there
are a lot of different demoninations of Christians, and although they have
some things in common they aren\'t all alike..especially when it comes to
*social* (as opposed to religious) beliefs.

While you are right that war is a kind of population control, it isn\'t war
that made societies give more worth to male children than female children.
Most people think it is based on the fact that males can produce more food
working in the fields than females, and therefore having another son (up to
a point) increased the food available for everyone, while having another
girl reduced the food available for everyone.  This might or might not have
been *true*, but it was the perception, belief (and probably observed fact)
of most traditional agricultural societies. Without any other
considerations would have been enough to cause families to favor boys over
girls.  This belief is outdated (in most societies) today, but it has
become ingrained in the social structure of most societies, and such
beliefs take time to die out.

 	Fair enough, I take your point. What skill would you roll against here?

Wouldn\'t Perception help with the above example? (And maybe Recon too) I
 don\'t think you could break Perception down, because by definition that
 skill is generic in that you are looking for you don\'t know what, so you
 can\'t be too specific in its general application anyway, not even in real
 life (whatever that is ;-) )
  >>

I would first think through what task is being performed...  say. Fishing.

Now I scan the list of skills and find Hunting. I also find Biology. Bow
Combat (spear fishing?). Recon? Stealth. Survival. Throwing.

Of those, Bow Combat, Survival, and Throwing are all default skills so anyone
can use them.

If I have to, I\'ll tell the players that for fishing, they don\'t have line or
hooks. I might suggest what skills they have on hand. They should then come
up with a scheme to go fishing.

It will but...  The air temperature inside will be higher, therefor air
*pressure* will be higher... colder air will be forced out of the bottom
of the balloon (when the flap on top is closed).  The flap can let hot
air out (kinda like a few people I know) to drop altitude... to gain
altitude, continue heating the rock and close the flap.  That\'s pretty
much it.  Since hot air rises (also...this is how some people get
promoted) you don\'t have to worry about losing it unless the flap is
open, the convection current gets closed off.

	Let me try to inject a little information into this discussion.  
I actually read a paper about this phenomenon a few years ago.  It was 
(IIRC) written by none other than Amartya Sen, a very well regarded (and 
feminist) Harvard professor.  Sen found that while the difference in the 
gender ratio was, overall, statistically significant, it was by no means 
overwhelming.  Furthermore, since the data was drawn from kindergarten 
records, there was some question about whether the change resulted from 
improvements in the male infant mortality rate.  Apparently male babies 
suffered disproportionately from certain causes of death, and 
improvements in living standards might have ameliorated them.  Whatever 
the case, the gender ratio was _not_ radically skewed.
	This means it is unlikely that we will face hordes of horny 
Chinese men streaming out into the world in search of brides.  Or that 
horny Chinese men will overthrow their gov\'t, or any other such silliness.

	If you are looking for some catastrophe to spice up your future 
history, how about a massive internet flame/spam-war started by some 
moron in Singapore that escalates so badly that it crashes the global 
network and takes the financial system with it. :-P

I think FUDGE handles this well, with broad or narrow skill definition
depending on preference.  People can do something similar with the 
Traveller skills by using optional cascades; so Bruce could treat
Survival as a cascade for his campaign, someone else could do the same
for Medical, and so on.  Once you get to this level of detail, though,
people have all sorts of different ideas as to what the individual
skills should be, so T4 should probably stay fairly minimalist.

Meanwhile, Michael D. Peters <Letterworks@Comten.com> wrote,

I think this is an example of what I would call a "Professional" or
"Specialist" skill - one useful for a particular job, but not likely to
be used much in adventuring situations.  Note I don\'t say "never" -
keeping passengers from panicking is important in a crisis, and you
mentioned the cargo packing situation.  Also, a good steward would have
other skills - Psychology, Medical-1, and some sort of performance
skill, for instance.

I wonder if it\'s worth having an "open" skill (called, maybe, Specialist
to contrast with JoT)?  Maybe allow one skill per term after the first
to be taken as Specialist provided the character story allows it (GM
decides)?  Leave it up to the GM to decide when use of the skill is
appropriate.

This could be indicated on the character sheet as

    Specialist (Steward)-2
    Specialist (Chef)-3
    Specialist ("Seamstress")-6

	I guess the best thing to be said about the subject is that it
definately opens a real can of worms.  Any possible future could be argued
ad infanitum without coming to a consensus.  Here is a suggestion: make
the history of the next 50 years as vague as possible (letting each Ref.
fill in the details as they see fit); afterall, the historical aspect
could be turned upside down next year.  Recall that 20 years ago the idea
of the Soviets collapsing without major bloodshed (meaning millions dead) 
or WWIII was so laughable that no game of the time even hinted at the
idea; however, since it did happen, any attempt at trying to project
details for the next 50 years will be vulnerable to these sudden and
surprising events.  If being vague about the next 50 years is a tollerable
solution, what key events should be mentioned happening between now and
2047?

	Here are a few suggestions:

	Invention of fusion 
	Established Lunar Colonies
	At least a manned mars landing, maybe gearing up for colonization.
	Expanding 3rd world economies. 
	Corporate expansion into space based industries.
	UN space organization formed, though little way to enforce rules.
	Development of at least .001G constant acceleration drives.

With this in place, a global social-political-economic structure can be
determined, allowing some room for unexpected global players (don\'t worry 
how they got into the game, just that they are in).  Then a detailed
history can be written from that point to the invention of J-drive and
Contact with the Vilani.

Notes:

..001G drives are a must.  It brings all the solar system within reach but
still leaves the feeling of isolation in the outer-solar system.

The expansion of the 3rd world economies is because of fusion (avoiding
some of the difficulties with industrialization).  

I think that at least intitialy, the nation states should have little
control over the major Corportations.  Perhaps a major event c.2050 can
change that situation, giving UN some authority over the corporations.

The next 10 years probably should represent a major expansion of activity
throughout the solar system, with colonies and bases springing up all
over.

Assuming average Characteristic and Skill-2, then there is a 57% chance of

Jesus H. God-dancing CHRIST, Leonard! Did you read ANY of my post? I
mean really READ it? I can FIGURE OUT what the flying #$%^% a
light-second is in real life, and so can anybody: BUT HOW THE FLYING
FRACK DOES THIS IMPACT ON THE GAME SYSTEM???!!!????

Are you wholly impervious to logic? IG should have done this and IG
should have explained that and IG should have done some other damned
thing.... AM I THE ONLY ONE HERE WHO IS INFURIATED AT THE FUNDAMENTAL
TIME & MONEY-WASTING ABSURDITY OF A GAME SYSTEM THAT HAS BEEN AROUND FOR
BETTER THAN A YEAR AND HAS SPAWNED THREE SHIP DESIGN SYSTEMS TWO OF
WHICH CONTAIN INFORMATION THAT ARE FOUND NOWHERE ELSE AND IS UTTERLY
USELESS & NONSENSICAL?

What am I to make of the weapons charts in the back of Starships? What
are all those light-seconds columns with the little numbers under them?
Why must I generate a very large number for hull armor or weapons damage
using SSDS and then convert it to a smaller number using a chart in the
back of the book -- why not simply generate the stats in T4 terminology
to begin with? 

If a G-hour is what you use to push a missile, how do I measure
acceleration in a missile using G-hours? That is OK for figuring fuel
CONSUMPTION, goddammit, but HOW DO I CATCH A SHIP WITH IT?????? That IS
the idea behind a missile, isn\'t it? Where oh where in the $100+ worth
of book that I have do I find out how to do this using G-hours?

Oh, it will all be made right in the NEXT frigging book, will it? I
should just keep buying their shit and cross my fingers and hope that
the NEXT book will make it all make sense while the gearheads on the
digest keep condescendingly telling me that it is IG\'s responsibility --
not the gearheads writing and editing the books -- to conform to what
the GEARHEAD AUTHORS come up with? And mine, as well, to comprehend
their pages full of incomprehensibel formulae IF I WANT TO DO ANYTHING
BEYOND PRODUCE A TL12 SHIP AT 5000 TONS MAX?

Since what we have is simply recycled TNE -- at the militant insistance
of the gearheads on this digest, mind you -- and since IG is now going
to have to resurrect some God-awfully complex space combat system to
conform to it, and since TNE was stillborn on the market as soon as it
came out and doomed the company that produced it to a premature
bankruptcy, DID IT OCCUR TO YOU THAT THIS MIGHT INFLICT THE SAME FATE ON
IMPERIUM GAMES?

Do you expect anybody to buy a game system that is not only unplayable,
but gets MORE unplayable with every publication? FUCK technology in the
real world -- how about a playable GAME SYSTEM???!??

Marc Miller... Jesus Christ, guy... if you are reading this, then you
have GOT to understand that you have got to quit slavishly adhering to
what the people on this digest are telling you. They have led you up the
primrose path. T4 is fucked, broken, and incomprehensible to anyone NOT
on the digest. Under their expert ministrations, you have produced a
game system which will drive your up-&-coming market of gamers in their
late teens away in droves. If you want IG to see another Christmas past
this one, you must do three things and you must do them immediately:

1) Make Wildstar\'s QSDS the standard ship-building system. Extend it on
either end tonnage-wise so that you can build anything from grav bikes
to dreadnaughts, just as you could in MegaTraveller. Also extend it from
TL\'s 9 to 15, so that you can build 90% of the hardware in the Traveller
universe without being forced into using a hellishly complex design
system -- that should be OPTIONAL. Right now it is MANDATORY. That is
RETARDED.

2) Revamp FF&S 2 so that all the results are presented in QSDS stats
WITHOUT any lame-assed \'conversions\' and use terminology throughout
which is NOT absent in the other supplements or contradictory to the
language used in them. (Do you need a professional tech editor with some
gaming experience? I\'M available....)

3) Offer the techies on this digest a small royalty to produce Excel
spreadsheets for both PC & Macs so that ordinary folks can design
individual FF&S 2 components, then plug them into QSDS. Put the
spreadsheets on a CD-ROM and bundle it with the book. Do not charge more
than $30 for the results. If you have to eat a bit of a loss to do it,
tough cookies. IG is about where Apple is... the best product around
mismanaged straight into the ground... and it desperately needs some
triage.

In the event that you can\'t tell, I\'ve pretty much given up on T4. FF&S
2 was to be the magic bullet tht would make everything OK, and I\'ve been
waiting for it for six months. Now I am being told that not only is it
filled with high-tech meaningless slang that is inapplicable anywhere
else within the game system, I am being told it\'s YOUR fault for not
explaining this gearhead drivel and MY fault for not learning how to use
it properly....

I\'ve got my entire Trav gaming group from high school waiting in the
wings, waiting to hear when my military-oriented campaign is going to
start up. I\'ve got to tell them it ain\'t gonna happen, because I can\'t
build anything and don\'t have an all-inclusive combat system to use it
even if I did. You haven\'t lost one customer. You\'ve lost five. Christ
only knows how many time this scene is being repeated all over the U.S.

The original Traveller came in thin, floppy, user-friendly booklets that
were inexpensive to buy and easy to read for your average-bright teen on
an allowance. It would have been great to go back to that level of
simplicity, with a more complex design/combat system hovering in the
background for those who wanted to make use of it. Instead, we\'ve got
what we have... which is precisely zero. I don\'t understand how to build
things using either of the custom ship design systems we have and no
combat system to make use of the data they present. This is assinine and
a blatant waste of time and money.

I\'ll get flamed out of the water for daring to air my myriad
exasperations on this digest, but I literally no longer care..... I did,
as recently as a few days ago.... You can do what you want and listen to
who you want. It\'s your game and your company and your legacy to the
role-playing community that is going up in a cloud of frustration and
failure. I quit.

I concur.  Were Traveller mostly game mechanics, we couldn\'t say
that we are still playing it. The CT rules were THAT Traveller.

Traveller is the IMPERIUM.  It is every idea we have read, heard, or
spoken conceived around Cleon\'s dream.  Sol has significance against
the larger tapestry of Sylea, and while other fictional backgrounds
may mimic aspects of Traveller, it is the Imperium and its surrounds
that seem to fire our imaginations.  Why else would we argue so
fervently about individual details of what is "canonical" or not.

The mechanics may come and go, but the Imperium remains.

Sounds much like Texas in the early 1800s. Already settled, though sparsely,
by the Spanish for nearly 200 years, government invites the new kids on the
block (the Americans) to settle where there is room; then when the cultural
differences between the Old World Spanish (now Mexican) goverment style and
the American perception of government begins to create problems, the
settlers reject government authority (an American Tradition), the Mexican
government sends in the troops to restore order and we have the Alamo. The
rest is canon,er,history.

Now, would the 1st Interstellar War have an Alamo? Where would it be?

DGP\'s World Builder\'s Handbook is an updated version of these two

than looking for these two books separately.

The last issue of MegaTraveller Journal was issue #4 (which is

The description on page 28 of Secret of the Ancients for the drives reads:

"DRIVES: The hull also contains the ship\'s drives (power plant, jump and
maneuver drives).  These drives are inaccessible from the capsules, and are
integral with the hull structure.  There are no fuel tanks, fuel being fed
through teleportation portals from the ship\'s pocket universe as needed."

I have always imagined the jump drives using about 45% of their jump fuel
to initially open the rift to jump space, about 10% to prime and maintain
the jump grid before and during jump and the remaining 45% to open the rift
back into normal space.

I also think that within the jump grid, the ship functions normally as
opposed to the accelerated movement rates (and who knows what other
effects) within the 36 known levels of jump space (or universes).  Since
the portals will work to transport you from one universe to another
(albeit, its own pocket universe), it should have no trouble working while
in jump space.  Obviously the portals do work in jump space on the ancients
ship, since the power plant is still getting fuel to run and there is no
mention that you cannot travel between capsules while in jump space.

2300AD canon, yes. But what I am doing is adding a Stutter Warp technology
to a Traveller universe, therefore extrapolating two DIFFERENT
implementations of the same underlying theory. Standard Jump technology is
the MACRO implementation of the Gravitically Induced Space Time Displacement
Effect, Stutter Warp is the MICRO implementation of that same principle.

This approach sounds rather more like the Keyhole drives from FF&S1, only
instead of wormholes light years long, lots of little ones exist that ships
can drop thru under the proper conditions. Handly explains why some deep
system probes have simply disappeared enroute to Mars and beyond.

Fields that induce all electrons in the human body to all head in the same

Again, this sounds closer to Keyhole drives.

True; basic principle is Gravitically Induced Space Time Displacement;
implementation, Macro version, is Jump, implementation, Micro version is
Stutter Warp. Just like aerodynamics, same rules, different implementation
methods.

Scecrets of the Ancients did not say that Grandfather had created Black
Holes, but that he expended huge quantities of energy to \'pinch\' off section
of space time for his teleportation networks and STARSHIPS (page 31,
Adventure 12). My opinon is that Jump Drives, Stutter Warp Drives, Gravitic
based Thruster Plates and such depend on finding a means and a material that
will create a ARTIFICAL gravitational signiture such that space time is
distorted in a controlled way, AS IF a mass existed, to produce the effects
for which each of these devices is noted.

Not one for every jump route; a single one that radically distorts space
time so that all stars within the Milky Way are reachable, if the path and
technique are known. The core of the Milky Way is now presumed to be a
massive Black Hole, Yaskoydray could have exploited the natural distortion
effect of this to create a pinched off pocket universe that touches every
star system but which has distances between any two points radically reduced.

See the above; his efforts may have resulted in an effect over a much larger
area that was intended when he started.

Not depends on it; the pocket universe has it\'s own energy to run on; but
each ship passing thru, by design, must inject additional fuel into the
power system.

Not just the Long Night, but the dark period between the end of the War of
the Ancients and the rise of the Vilani may have caused some of the pocket
universe to collapse. Or perhaps they expanded as the pinch effect weakens.
Perhaps that is why the maximum jump is now 6; the underlying pocket
universe is so starved for energy that any links greater than 6 have
expanded and broken. If the current intelligent races do not realized what
is happening, every every Jump drive may cease to work. Perhaps that is why
the Zhodani are trying to reac the Galactic Core. They have realized that
underlaying pocket universe is not be maintained in a stable manner and must
be repaired.

Ah, but by comming up with an explanation for the 2d maps that peacefully co
exists with the FTL travel mechanism for the game, I avoid having to explain
that 3d maps aren\'t used because it is too much trouble. A good handwave
doesn\'t just fix the current rough spot, but should smooth the way for
several spots to come.

Again, a good handwave has covered (or recovered) from less than accurate
writing. Based on this pocket universe theory, Han\'s statement still retains
the meaning of distance, instead of speed. He had found a shorter way thru
the pocket universe to Kessel, effectively making the run in less that the
standard distance.

The truest of statements yet; however, for those who are newer to Traveller,
or who just want different ideas to work from, exchanges like this between
people who have differenting interpretations may help them develop their own
ideas. It can also help us refine our own ideas a little bit more.

I had not tracked closely on the Jump Space as an Ancient Artifact thread,
skimming it because I my pet theory did not contain a Jump \'Space\'; however,
after our exchange, the idea of Jump \'Space\' being a massive pocket universe
created by Grandfather, has intrigued me enough to put a to do on my list
for reveiwing the digests containing this thread. 

As I comtemplate our exchange, I may even find parts of it that will lead to
refinements in Professor Davros\' Theory of Jump Effect.

Am I the only GM that uses the Steward skill as a DM when determining how
many passengers you can book onto the ship?  I\'ve never used Admin or
Carousing for that purpose.  Stewards are in charge of making sure the
life-support systems are equiped and in good working order.  They are in
charge of food preperation, waste disposal, crew and passenger
service/entertainment, cargo loading/unloading, and ship security. Whether
Marc includes Steward into T4.1 or not, I\'ll be continuing to have it in
the games I run.

About detailed/general skills, I guess I lean toward detailed but I
understand the advantages of having a few general skills that cover broad
areas of operation.  For example, we have an Engineering skill, we don\'t
have Engineering Cascade:  Jump Drive, Maneuver Drive, Power Plant Cascade: 
Fusion, Fission, Internal Combustion.  

In that vane, though, why don\'t we have a Bridge skill?  In instead we have
Pilot, Astrogator, Sensors, Communications...these are all starship Bridge
skills and in most *realistic* services a Bridge Officer would get some
training in all of them.

Of course, once upon a time the Gunnery Skill *was* a cascade..you had to
choose Laser, Particle, Meson, Sandcaster, etc as a specific skill whenever
you got Gunnery.

I think it might be worth considering looking at Professions, in addition
to Careers.  A Professional Spaceman would have certain skills (Vacc Suit,
Survival:  Zero-G & Vacuum, & a Specialty Profession (Bridge, Engineer,
Steward, Technician, Gunner) that have a number of skills) *all* at some
minimum level.  A Professional Merchant would have Trader, Broker, Bribery,
Admin, Streetwise, & Carousing.  I think we could define a number of
Professions all with certain required skills. This wouldn\'t take the place
of running a character through the career process, but it might be a good
shortcut method of generating specific types of characters, and at least
good guidelines for what skills a player should get for their characters.

Just some thoughts,

Eris

Well this answers some questions that I have had, FFS2=Crap put that one
down at the bottom of the list for purchase. This is the only review of
FFS2 that anyone has posted. It has been what two weeks and no other
reviews, despite the various and sundry excuses ie UPS is holding it back,
Gencon delayed people getting it.

So far it *suposed* to be in *future* re release of book *what ever*. The
meshing of the three plus ship/vehicle systems.

Question: If CSC/VDS is supposed to superseded by FFS2 why are they still
publishing and selling CSC/VDS? ?And who will try and explain to someone
that just bought CSC/VDS that it has been superceded by another product he
will have to buy? From what I have been told the tow systems are alien to
each other totally.

But have to realize something Jay, Mark does not run anything, he is just a
figurehead, he sold his rights to Traveller for the duration of IG\'s reign.
He does not "Call The Ball" as IG\'s propaganda has cranked out. Ask him if
he ever stopped a POS product from rolling off the publishing lines, if he
really "called the ball" he could have stopped the FFS2 before it was sent
to the publishers, but he did not because he does not "call the ball" at
all, he is just paid lackey of IG.

I am going to have to start up a MT type of game their are few things that
I can import but not enough to keep me interested in Traveller.

Hey did someone not say that Steve Jackson Games is going to make a GURPS
Traveller? Could have possibilities if IG can keep their hands out of it.

Hey I have a MT excel spreadsheet are you interested in a copy?
I also recommend GGG3 for personal weapons design, and it has spreadsheet
available too.

	For T4.1 I would advise to drop half die (its not playable !)
	I would also advice to drop staggering. I would tell them that
	there are 4 ways to resolve tasks, and that its up to the refree
	to decide how the dice should become rolled. 

	To place some limits: max skill level (for humans) = 6
	                      max DMs applied +/-5

	----

	MT Way : 2d6 -	3+ simple    now called	easy
			7+ routine	"	average
			11+ difficult	"	difficult
			15+ formidable	"	formidable
			19+ imposible	"	imposible

	Usage: Player rolls 2d6 and add (characteristic / 5)+skill+DM,
	       refree compares to UTP difficulty and decides.

	Advantages: Skills have a higher value than characteristic

	----

	GDW Way: 1d20   =<asset*4+dm routine   now called	easy
			=<asset*2+dm average	"	average
			=<asset*1+dm difficult	"	difficult
			=<asset/2+dm formidable	"	formidable
			=<asset/4+dm imposible	"	imposible

	Usage: Refree calles for an asset.  Player adds
	       characteristic+skill, rolls 1d20 and tells
	       difficulty level he matched. Refree deceides
	       if its enough to solve the task.

	Advantage: fast resolution if prepared.
	Disadvantage: needs d20, multiplication and division.

	----

	T4.1 Way: 5d6   first easy
			second average
			third difficult
			forth formidable
			fifths imposible

	Usage: Refree calles for an asset. Player adds
	       characteristic+skill+DM, and rolls 5 dice
	       adding them loud.

	Advantage: no multiplication, no d20.
	Disadvantage: high stat JoATs have good chance even in
	              imposible situations.

   You\'re right about one thing here Leroy--anyone saying that Marc
Miller\'s Traveller is *Traveller* shouldn\'t be taken seriously.  They
are two seperate games.  No amount of hand waving will make them one and
the same.

   Anyone who thinks that there will be a level of international
cooperation enough within the next 12 years to establish UNSCA isn\'t
living on the same Earth I am.  Same for the establishment of Archimedes
settlement (from a writeup that is 13 years old).  Far too optimistic
given the current status of Earth\'s various space programs.

   Assuming that everyone can get serious about Mars and not just talk
about it, getting there by 2014 will take international cooperation.  I
see *that* cooperation eventually leading to the establishment of UNSCA.

   I\'m saying that we are going to be lucky to get back to the Moon at
all by 2009, let alone establish a permanent base.  Correct me if I\'m
wrong, but not even the Americans have a plan to go there before that
date.

   About 10 years ago, I did a paper for a history class in which I
discussed the some of the major cultural changes that had occurred in
the latter 20th century.  While doing my research, I stumbled across a
1963 article in which the leading figures of the science-fiction
community (Asimov, et al) were asked what they thought the future held
for humanity in space.  To a man, they agreed that by now (1997) we
would certainly have permanent bases on the Moon and Mars, and would
have sent manned expeditions to all the planets of the inner system.  I
also could point out Arthur C. Clarke\'s _2001_, which had us travelling
to Jupiter only a 4 years from now (we don\'t even have the partially
completed space station Clarke mentions started, nor have we established
a single permanent base from which we can search for monoliths).

   I was born in 1963.  Some of my first memories are of Apollo 8, and I
can remember the exact moment with perfect clarity when Neil Armstrong
stepped on the Moon.  I also watched as during the 1970s the U.S.
basically dismantled a large portion of its space program and left all
the optimistic predictions of the sci-fi writers unfulfilled.  While I
am not a total pessimist when it comes to manned space travel, I am a
realist.  A revision of some of the dates for Terran exploration and
"conquest" of the Solar system are badly needed in light of a more
modest space tech development schedule and more realistic budgetary
projections.

   On my own personal Earth history timeline, we are about to enter a
time of troubles that will make Bosnia look like a modest warm up
excercise.  The good news is that technological development will for the
most part continue, though at a slower pace.  As the time of troubles
ends in the 2030s, revolutionary technological change will occur,
eventually pushing Earth to the Traveller equivalent of TL 9, and then
TL 10 by the end of the century.

>We could use 3D star maps too. <G>

   Not in our lifetime.  I don\'t relish the prospect of having to
conduct my Traveller scenarios down at the local planetarium.  :-)

   Don\'t be so dismissive.  There is other evidence that is just as
convincing in other sources.

   An important point you\'ve missed is that this is a classic
Vietnam/Afghanistan scenario.  The Terrans are fighting a *total* war,
where as the Vilani are barely treating this like a minor border
skirmish.  It wasn\'t until the Terrans have a superior navy (in terms of
technology if not in size) that the Vilani start to take the whole thing
as a serious conflict.

   The major advantages of the Terrans can be summed up as follows:

   1) Better jump capability (by the 8th IW)

   2) Better use of automated systems (including TL 12 robots which
allow for a reduction in the number of crew required to run a ship)

   3) Better armament in the form of the meson gun (by the 8th IW)

   4) Better leadership (command structure of the Terran Navy much less
bureaucratic)

   5) Better concept of the nature of the conflict (Terrans knew that
this would be a fight to the death)

   These advantages alone would be sufficent for the Terrans to have the
capability to defeat the Vilani without having to resort to TL 13+ magic
trick explanations.

<snip>

>Note: this latter view is entirely consistent with all of the information

    Sorry, it simply doesn\'t hold water.  While through some handwaving
you can make it work for MMT, it doesn\'t work with CT, MT, or TNE unless
you ignore the accumulated evidence to the contrary, which is
considerable.

   DGP did Traveller both a great service and disservice with their
products.  While on balance their contribution was positive, there are
some situations where it was apparent that the writer of a particular
piece wasn\'t completely versed in Traveller canon or chose to ignore it.

   Another point on TL: the tech level rating system is for the use of
***referees*** and ***players*** to give them something to gauge what is
being described to them in terms of a world\'s (or society\'s) overall
technology in relation to others.  It is a number that exists *outside*
the context of the Traveller universe.  No character, not even
Grandfather would know that they are TL 10 or 15 or whatever.  Yes, I am
aware that some Traveller and MMT publications list \'laser rifle-13\' and
\'handcomputer-11\' but those numbers are for *your* reference--in the
eyes of your character, they would just be a laser rifle and
handcomputer.  While they would be aware that the laser rifle
incorporates more advanced technology than the hand computer, they would
not make statements like, "yeah, the rifle is two tech levels higher
than the computer".

   Yours is yet another example of why it would be better if _Marc
Miller\'s Traveller_ and _Traveller_ (CT, MT, TNE) were treated as
completely seperate games.  In that way it would be easier to justify
the points you bring up.

Harold

  From what I understand, this is effectively impossible given what
we know - they diverged moderately after 300 K-a back , don\'t appear
to have been extensively geneered, and were still Solomani interfertile.

  A good point - perhaps contributors (I won\'t say "sides") could indicate?
About the colonic bacteria thing - wouldn\'t exported lab monkeys have been
candidates for their gut bugs being modified to minimize or eliminate the
threat of harmful mutant variants (this is Grandfather-tech, after all)?

  The only "side" I take in this is that I have concluded that BW agents
were not decisively/extensively used prior to the effective collapse of
the Vilani, if then (though it would explain a great deal at that point).

  For a well-developed economy the little isalnds and atolls are

  Actually, Chile has a coastline, which even if a particular site

a rocky outcropping in the middle of SFA. Chile is also probably
richer than a number of other countries being bandied about.

  Hmm, how to improve a port near a Chilean site? They\'re not

So don\'t use it.  Very simple.  I don\'t use the parts of the game I
dislike, and nobody held a gun to your head to force you to buy or use FFS2.

As a "gearhead game geek" (I am offended by that by the way), let me make

Everything I design goes up here or on my pages or gets pitched to JTAS..

I read your post, and you asked quite directly what these terms meant.
Sorry if I misunderstood you. 

FFS2 was never intended to include game rules, just design sequences; I had
thought this was quite clearly stated.

Funny how we have an active ship design contest that attracts entries using
all three of those design systems...  I use FFS/SSDS.. others prefer QSDS.
Perhaps you want everyone to lower themselves to the level you are
comfortable with?  Sorry, I find FFS2 to be a very interesting project, and
am just starting to really get into it.

Take my Terrapin-class exploratory merchant.  Designed using FFS, you could
do much the same thing using QSDS.  The same components, the same rules.
In fact, I\'ll probably go back over the Terrapin for the design of the
Ramble-On Rose to take advantage of the new systems in FFS2.

It was stated a very long time ago that FFS2 would not contain game rules.

A space combat missle is expalined on pg 48.  You design the thrust agency
on pg 65.  Each G of acceleration requires 1 G-hour per hour of acceleration.

One more time, NO RULES IN THIS BOOK.  Did you read the blurb on the back

Since we\'re the ones writing the books.  If you have such a damn problem,
write something.  QSDS can be extended out easily beyond 5000dt and TL12.

I am really getting sick of the "militant gearhead" line.  We enjoy using
the design sequences, and freely share what we build.  I am a high-school
dropout who has a real problem with math beyond very simple algerbra; yet I
have managed to learn enough to build enjoyable and useful equipment and
ships.  Forgive me if I fail to cry in my beer for you.

For the last time, this book is not about the game system!  Marc Miller is
rewriting the game system, and from what I\'ve seen it is very playable.
What FFS2 and us *evil* gearheads are trying to do is provide a consistent
technological base to use.  This is important to avoid the problems of
other SF games where technical items were pretty much used as magical
gifts, with no real rhyme or reason to their design.  In Traveller, we are
at least making the attempt to make a realistic, coherent, and logical
backround.

You want easy magic techno-toys, I\'m sure there are copies of Star
Frontiers sitting in the used bin at your FLGS.

The day Marc listens to me is the day I stop treatment, \'cause then I will

QSDS is a perfectly useful design sequence, several THUDDD entrants use it
to the exclusion of anything else.  Now that FFS2 is out, I\'m sure that it
will be extended to cover ships from TL6 to TL21.  All QSDS is is a set of
prebuilt modules that you stick together.. those modules were designed
using FFS!  So, all you are doing is getting the hard work done for you.

Unacceptable, since I don\'t use QSDS.  Evidently, you seem to expect the
Traveller community to cater to your whims.  Sorry.

How magnaminous of you to volunteer IG to take a loss.  You seem to expect
a lot of people to do a lot of work for you.  There are several excellent
spreadsheets avalible right now for ship design.. If you like, I could send
you the one that I use.

FFS2 is difficult, no arguement, but the results are well worth the effort.

If you need weapons, try

If you want ships or vehicles, mail me and we\'ll work something out.  As
for the system, Marc is working on that, and doing it right this time, or
would you prefer that he rush out a jobber like last summer?

...and I remember when High Guard came out and we spent hours at the game
store designing ships, awed at the new possibilities.  From the beginning,
traveller has had a strong gearhead streak, your personal problems with
that will not change the fact that a good percentage of us enjoy building
things.

I\'m not flaming you for your opinions.. I have very strong feelings on IG
and it\'s direction myself; but on your insulting manner.  You seem to feel
that you are helpless before the tide of gearheads, did anyone ever say you
needed anything other than QSDS?  No, all the other systems are optional.
Want vehicles?  The system in CSC is usable.  Or, since you are of the
opinion that nobody can possibly b.s. out the future of technology
reliably, why not just make it up?  It\'s your game, I\'m not going to stop
you.  But please don\'t insult me and my players who enjoy using systems
like FFS2 and 3G3 to create a living world.

You quit?  Fine, that seems to be the easiest path, which you seem to prefer.

As an aside, I am working on a review of FFS2, but due to multiple doctor
appointments its been hard to find time to sit down and really go through
the book.  My first impression is that it is very complete, though poorly
formatted, and could have used a few examples of the design sequnces.

[a lot of harsh truths]

I\'m sad to say that Jay is right on a great many things.  The survival
of Traveller as a desirable product is threatened.  The game system is
over-designed, under-explained, and much harder than it has to be.  I
still don\'t really understand either of the Ship Design Systems.  We
have tables that aren\'t explained and explanations without tables.
Recipe for disaster.  Several game store owners I have talked to about
T4 have said tings like "It\'s like welcoming back an old friend . . .
but incomprehensible to those not familiar with CT or the rest.  Two are
so upset about the First Survey/Mileu 0 deal that they are drastically
cutting their orders of all IG products, not that its selling
particularly well in the first place.

The ONLY two things Traveller has going for it is the enthusiasm and
energy of veterans such as those on this mail list and the great core
ideas that make the heart of Traveller.  But there is too much shit that
isn\'t working.

Mr. Miller\'s obviously working hard to correct the problem to the extent
that he can.  His work with this list and willingness to expose his
ideas and writings to open criticism is commendable and exemplary.  I\'m
worried that IG isn\'t behind him and behind Traveller as much as they
should be.  I\'m also worried that even if a miracle cure is achieved,
the market has been burned and dried up.  T4.0 looks to be in ruins.
Game dealers are burned on IG.  TSR\'s got their new system for
futuristic campaign\'s rolling out in the fall (Alternity is the name,
and the first campaign setting looks to be similar to an Traveller a bit
- - but its been a while since I talked to the game designers over there).

I hope that Traveller can survive, but I\'m not very optimistic.  I\'m not
quitting on Traveller.  Not yet anyway.  But I have to leave the
maillist for other reasons (I\'ll be travelling ;)  Maybe I\'ll talk to
you all in the future.  Maybe not.

Good travells.

Electron "tunneling" is *because* of the Heisenberg principle. It\'s
just a case of the uncertainty in position shifting the "most probable"
location from one side of a potential barrier to the other.

Also, *any* size object can "tunnel". It\'s just that the probability
for a macroscopic object is infinitesmal.

It\'s all quantum mechanical wave functions, anyway.

Now for the science fiction...

Now as to "jump space" existing, consider that canon is that the space
*already exists*. The drive just gets the ship into it, along with a
"bubble" of normal space. 

Think of a ship in a 2d universe moving into another 2d universe and
taking a small (circular or oval?) piece of the original space with it.
Or it could be in a 3d universe, but that\'s another matter.

Here\'s *my* take on the way the jumpspace bubble works.

I rather suspect that the "bubble" around a ship in jump space would
*not* have a boundary, rather it\'d wrap back around itself (picture the
2d ship on the surface of a small sphere). Of course, to make the
conditions in the ship normal, the spacetime around the ship would be
"flat" (the sphere is flattened into a lens shape so the ship is on a
more or less plane surface). This drastically increases the curvature
elsewhere. Since curvature of space is the same thing as gravity, this
explains what happens if you get too far from the surface of the ship.
The tidal forces from the excessive curvature tear you apart and the
fragments leak back into normal space.

The "lens" shape is "necessary" *because* things that hit the "edge"
leak back into normal space. This allows a small bubble. Otherwise you\'d
need a bubble big enough to let the heat radiated by the ship disperse
greatly without frying the ship. 

Also a "spherical" (actually hyperspherical) bubble would be *really*
weird for the ship using it. You\'d see your ship in all directions. Sort
of like turning it inside out and blowing it up to the size of the
bubble.

This also answers the questions about starting a second jump drive
while in jump. Trying to build another "bubble" inside the first one
will distort both of them and tear everything apart. Bye-bye ship!

I hate to tell you this, but *most* of the technology in FF&S (just
about everything except contra gravity, thruster plates, jump drives
and meson guns) is well understood *now*. And thus the rules are based
on this. And it *is* complicated, because changing one parameter
usually requires changes in others.

Did *you* read *my* post? I pointed out that we had to use real units
because IG didn\'t tell us what the "game" units would be.

That depends on the combat system that IG didn\'t give us.

Using the vector movement system...

You have to figure out what acceleration the missile is moving at in a
"turn" (whatever length that is). Then you plot the movement of both
the ship and the missile for that turn. Next turn the missile\'s
guidance system may decide that a higher or lower acceleration is
better. The ship may change its accel as well. At some point either the
missile hits the ship, or one or the other runs out of fuel. If one
runs out of fuel, it continues in a straight line at a constant
velocity. It may still be able to get away (if it\'s the ship) or to hit
(if it\'s the missile), but it\'s unlikely.

The missile has a maximum acceleration, given by the type of drive it
has. But it can run slower and often this is a good idea. Run at low
accel until you get "close" (and fool the ship into thinking that you
are too slow to worry about). Then kick in full power for the final
run.

<sigh>

The complex system is for the folks who *want* a complex system. Now
that we have FF&S2, it\'s possible to *extend* SSDS and QSDS. But the
idea is to have *several* levels of complexity, so that more people can
be satisfied.

Then you weren\'t paying attention. It was stated from the *start* that
FF&S would be "gearhead" level! That\'s why I\'m ragging on you so much.
You were told *in advance* what to expect, and then get mad when that\'s
what you get.

And where did you get the idea that FF&S would *be* a combat system?
Not from the list!

I can understand that you are upset. But I can also see that many of
your complaints amount to complaining that FF&S is not something that
no one ever *claimed* it would be!

The lack of definitions sucks. But as has been said elsewhere, we were
on a tight schedule and assured that the definitions would be added.
What were we supposed to do? Waste time doing something that we weren\'t
*supposed* to do?

But nobody is going to apologize for the "techy" level of the product.
Not when it was specifically *stated* that it was going to be a
gearhead product!

Nor is anyone going to apologize for there not being a combat system,
not when that wasn\'t supposed to be in there either. We\'d have *loved*
to have had IG come up with a combat system. It would have let us
simplify a lot things... Since we didn\'t know things like turn lengths,
and got conflicting info about ranges, we had to use things like light
seconds, kilometers, and so forth. And we couldn\'t round off a lot of stuff.

Alas, it is no more "available" than the others....I\'ve searched long
and hard for WBH.  Nobody ever seems to be willing to part with it (and
rightly so when one observes how useful it is via all the discussion of
world building on the TML)  Maybe someday archeologists will dig up a
long lost cache of 100 WBHs so those of us not forunate enough to own it
can snap them up.  Until then Scott, myself, and many others can only
dream.......

Not very useful.....but hey its late.  Maybe I should go to sleep
instead of read TML....

   Not bad enough to stop the Americans from taking that detour for

   Well there were some things that could have been explained better,

   Seriously, by now if the Vilani *really* existed, they would know
that there is a TL 8 world here, based upon the transmissions we
routinely throw out into space.  They would also know therefore that we
are balkanized and have only began a rudimentary exploration of our star
system.  Undoubtedly, some Vilani bureaucrat is responsible for
monitoring intercepted Earth transmissions and compiling reports based
on analysis of those transmissions to higher headquarters.  These
reports are filed appropriately--and forgotten.  This would explain why
the Vilani mistake the crew of the Starleaper for some minor race humans
from another part of the empire (or maybe that was the cover used by the
Terrans courtesy of their own intelligence people, who\'s reports on the
Vilani weren\'t lost in the bureaucrat shuffle...).

   Problem: if the "aliens from Roswell" are Vilani scouts, then why

we can meet and stop their friends before they get to Earth with

	Wow! I thought I only missed one episode (the last one!).

	No, don\'t think it\'s sour grapes, most of the people know watched

showcase of how _not_ to  make a successful SF series. Ok, the

me, though) are far more popular in Finland than S:AAB ever was.

    'body' => '	I have not posted an FF&S2 review before now because I am not 
really done digesting the wealth of information in this book, but given 
the concerns expressed by some, I thought I should post earlier rather 
than later.

Overview
	This is the best book yet produced for T4.  Let me say that again,
THIS IS THE BEST BOOK YET PRODUCED FOR T4.  The other contenders have
their good points, but simply cannot compare.  The T4 main rules book had
some definite problems, as its current revision indicates.  CSC has a
great feel to it but introduced the various canon conflicts we are all
familiar with and used a design system which was not only inconsistent
with the starship system, but was not really internally consistent either. 
Milieu Zero is a very popular and very rich campaign supplement, but was
not supported by proper maps and, at least for my taste, took too
pessimistic a view of the early Imperium.  Not only does FF&S2 avoid many
of the pitfalls that plagued earlier books, but it fixes a number of the
problems earlier books created. 
	Perhaps the most important fix is that starship and personal 
combat now uses the same system of ratings.  The damage and armor system 
described in the main T4 book is still fully in place and "canon."  The 
starship system has been converted through use of a simple multiplier into 
the personal combat stats.  No longer will you have to flip through 
various charts to figure out whether a plasma gun can penetrate the 
ship\'s hull, or whether the laser turret can hurt the APC.  Its all there.
	The books useability extends beyond the gearhead to the 
role-player.  Useful information about j-drives, the roles of various 
crew members, the kinds of food and comforts available on starships, and 
the workings of all sorts of technology are revealed in FF&S2.
	As an FF&S2 compatible QSDS system is in the works, soon everyone 
will be able to plug-n-play FF&S2 components.
	Much to my delight, the internal art is also very good.  There 
are _great_ drawings of battledress troops firing plasma weapons while a 
smoking former comrade lies next to them; a hot-shot strapped into his 
grav bike; grav tanks with point defense lasers crashing through an urban 
landscape and stomping infantry; some explorers atop their ATV on an 
alien world; etc.  Even the Chris Foss cover art is appropriate, as it 
shows a starship taking a number of laser hits.

Introduction
	The book begins with a discussion of the design process, 
technology assumptions, and an intuitive discussion of the units used in 
the book targeted at non-gearheads.  The differences between weight and 
mass, energy and power, speed and acceleration, are all explained.  
People looking for additional design resources are pointed to the IG web 
site with the statement that things like spreadsheets may be available in 
the future.

Section I
	The first section of the book presents a complete overview of 
everything that is necessary to design any of the vehicles discussed in 
the book.  These design sequences are detailed enough to be useful, but 
do not get bogged down in component technologies and whatnot.

1: Vehicle Design
   STARSHIPS
	The section on hulls contains two _great_ improvements.  First,
the return of asteroid hulls to Traveller!  Hazzah!  Second, the
Streamlining and Airframe rules are now fully integrated with the vehicle
and aircraft section.  Now if your CG goes out and you\'re trying to bring
in the Fat Trader on its airframe you\'ll know exactly how well it handles
compared to the TL-6 fighter on its tail! 
	Drives covers how much thrust you need and how to determine 
performance.  It also covers the "realistic" thrust equations so that 
low-tech designs with rocket boosters get a fair shake.  It also 
introduces explicit surface area requirements for the jump grid and 
includes a discussion of the "physics" of jump.  The need for hard 
numbers for jump grid has come up more than once on the TML when players 
want to know about disabling a ship\'s jump grid, or putting a j-drive in a 
previously non-jump ship that lacks a grid.
	Weapon mounts brings in a long overdue explanation of how 
turrets, bays, fixed mounts, and spinals work and how they differ.  It 
explains the arcs of fire and the volume required for pointing machinery 
for each of these types of weapon mounts.
	Miscellaneous Components is chock full of Role-Playing-Relevant 
material.  Descriptions of hangars, docking rings, and jettison bays are 
all provided so that refs can describe them and their capabilities to 
players.  The "Grapple Problem" described on this list has also been 
solved with "specialized" and "universal" grapples.  Specialized grapples 
only work on ships of the same configuration and displacement as the ship 
they were designed to carry.  Universal grapples can secure any ship of 
the max displacment or less.  Launch rates are covered and tasks for 
pilots and launch control officers allow emergency maneuvers.  The game 
effects of machine shops, electronics shops, and sick bays are covered.  
A cool description of a docking umbilical is included with a variety of 
hatch, cargo, cargo handling, and fuel tankage options.

*All of the above info is provided in just the first 17 pages.

	Next comes gravitic craft, lighter-than-air craft, aircraft, and 
ground vehicles.  The mechanics here are really simple and 
straightforward.  It takes just a couple of pages for each of these types 
of vehicles.
	
    GRAV VEHICLES
	Some changes have been made to how CG creates lift and thrust to 
limit the creation of 25G atomic pogo sticks and things of the sort 
(sorry Famille Spofulum) because they were really holes in the design 
system.

    LIGHTER THAN AIR VEHICLES
	The Ref who has players using a hot air baloon should look at 
these rules to get some better details.

    AIRCRAFT
	This is the vehicle type that I believe got the most attention.  
It is no longer the case that you can\'t design a Huey or F-16.  These 
design rules seem to work quite nicely. Maneuver points have also been 
introduced for things like dogfights.  Now a real measure of 
maneuverability quantifies the differences between the Red Baron and the 
F-22.

    GROUND VEHICLES
	I like the simple way these kinds of vehicles are designed.  I 
also like the fact that hover vehicles are now truly practical.  What I 
*don\'t* like is the fact that I can\'t find any mention of maximum ground 
pressure.  Unless this is fixed, its still possible to build 200-tonne 
tanks that would, in reality, sink into the dirt under their own weight.


2. Weapon Design

    SMALL ARMS
	Believe it or not I haven\'t designed any small arms yet.  I\'ve 
seen some designs posted to the list, perhaps their creator can comment?  
One thing I did notice is that it\'s now possible to create receivers with 
advanced materials like crystal iron to reduce weight and increase 
performance.

    GAUSS WEAPONS
    WARHEADS
    CANNON
    MASS DRIVERS
    HIGH-ENERGY WEAPONS
    MISSILES
    	I haven\'t designed any battlefield (tac) missiles, but I\'ve made 
a number of space missiles.  What I found is that you have to build them 
like little ships with their own power plants and heplar thrusters.  When 
I get the catalog complete I\'ll post them so that people can use them 
without designing them themselves.
    LASERS
    PAWS
	Two changes have been made here.  First, a design loop-hole was 
closed so that hi-tech PAW spinal mounts don\'t come out to be 100m long 
drinking straws.  Second, Circular PAWs have been introduced that allow 
smaller ships to carry big PAW guns if they are willing to pay the price 
in MCr and MW.  Circular PAWs also ressurect the CT bay PAW idea by 
allowing sub-spinal sized PAWs to have decent range.
    MESON GUNS

3: Defense Design

    ELECTROSTATIC ARMOR
    FORCE FIELDS
    MESON SCREENS
    NUCLEAR DAMPERS
	Yeah!  Damper screens are back!  The Damper turrets are still 
around for det-lasers, but contact nukes can be easily neutralized with 
the damper screen.
    REACTIVE ARMOR
    SAND CASTERS
	A _fantastic_ description of the physics of sandcaster sand.
    TRACTORS AND REPULSORS

Section II:  Components
4: Weapon Accessories

5: Hulls and Streamlining
	This section provides new materials, and new rules for making any 
size hull you like -- even 101.25 Tons.  It also covers the very cool new 
rules for stealth and hull coatings.

6: Thrust Agencies
	Everything\'s here -- heplar, t-plates, contragrav, solid rockets,
liquid rockets, hybrid rockets, Nuclear Thermal Rockets, Gas-Core Nuclear
Thermal Rockets, fusion rockets, ion drives, solar sails, ramscoops,
propellers, jets, AZH, and helicopter rotors.  The speed, acceleration,
glide ratio, and take-off/landing rolls can all be determined.
	These rules provide enormous flexibility and will be useful to 
_any_ Milieu.  The Interstellar Wars Milieu thats been discussed will 
benefit enormously from the ability to design effective but low-tech 
drives.  Imagine a Gas-Core Nuclear Thermal SDB going up against a 
t-plate equipped Vilani destroyer.

7: Electronics
	Another greatly improved section of the rules.  Remember how 
computers used to be a one-size-fits-all piece of equipment?  Now you can 
design a computer of any power rating for any TL.  Best of all, you can 
use the Computer Power stat to maintain compatibility with the excellent 
computer rules in CSC!
	Ever wonder what the difference between Dynamic Linked and 
Synaptic Linked controls was?  Now you know!  I think this provides just 
the right kind of detail for referees to add to the "look and feel" of 
the players\' interaction with the starship.
	Communicators have been fixed so that directional and tight-beam 
radios can be created.

*******	By far the best thing about this section and, indeed, the entire 
*book is Bruce Macintosh\'s sensor rules.  These are not only realistic, 
*they are very playable.  Furthermore, the provide lots more ways for 
*players to become involved in spacecraft operations by managing their 
*sensor scan strategy, using the terrain of space to hide in, and 
*controlling their emmisions to stay hidden until just the right moment 
*to strike.  You\'ve all seen these rules as posted to the TML, so I won\'t 
*repeat them.

8: Life Support and Accomodations

    CREW AND PASSENGERS
	Another section with tremendous role-playing resources.  A 
thorough description of crew duties, passenger requirements, 
workstations, and accomodations.  It also covers the best description of 
low berths and their operation that Traveller has had since JTAS and 
Travellers Digest covered them.

    LIFE SUPPORT
	Provides detailed information about what the various levels of 
life support mean in vivid enough terms to make it relevant to players.  
It also covers how far players can stretch the LS system on their ship 
and how they can make themselves more comfortable with additional galleys 
and everything from emergency rations to gourmet meals.  Food storage is 
explicitly added to ship design so that cautious players who want to 
horde food know how much space it takes up and how long it stays good.

    ARTIFICIAL GRAVITY
	In addition to standard g-comp we get spun hulls, spin capsules, 
and g-tanks for those pesky Terrans.

9: Power Systems
	The big news here is Scale Efficiences.  Now as PPs get bigger 
they also get more efficient (just like the RealWorld(tm)).  Its 
implemented in such a way as to not be a real feature rather than a 
headache.
	The only problem in this section is changing the fuel type of 
Fusion+ from water to heavy water.  This seems to me to be a needless and 
restrictive change.  Yes, it\'s more realistic, but Fusion+ is already so 
far off that it seems like no more than a cosmetic change.

DRAWBACKS
	There are very few things wrong with FF&S2.  It doesn\'t include 
water craft or robots for lack of space.  And, of course, it has errata.  
Every other book ever published for Trav had errata, and this one is no 
different.  Fortunately, the worst errata, the poorly formatted 
equations, is merely cosmetically annoying and does not affect the 
usefulness of the product.
	Yes, FF&S2 is complicated and likely will take a while to learn 
for new players and refs.  However, it does provide quite a bit of 
roleplaying-relevant information.  Even more importantly, it lays the 
firm technical foundation under which can be built much more simplified 
systems such as QSDS and the Roleplaying Space Combat System.

SUMMARY
	I REALLY CAN\'T SAY ENOUGH GOOD THINGS ABOUT THIS SUPPLEMENT.  IT 
IS BETTER THOUGHT OUT, BETTER EXECUTED, AND OF HIGHER QUALITY THAN 
ANYTHING ELSE PRODUCED FOR T4.  IF YOU WANT TO ADD A RICH TECHNICAL 
BACKGROUND TO TRAVELLER\'S RICH HISTORICAL BACKGROUND, FF&S2 IS AN 
INVALUABLE BOOK.

   As a gearhead game-geek loaded down with old TNE supplements, I\'d
like to say that complexity and reality are good things in a game,
however, if things aren\'t presented in a consistent fashion (as was done
in TNE) and done so in a way so that they are comprehensible to the
average gamer (TNE didn\'t always do the best job at this), the game and
the game system are nothing but a tremendous waste of paper.  Those of
us who are hard-core TNEers recognised this fact and were working on
ways to make the TNE system more "approachable" (creating plug in
modules, "TNE Light") before GDW collapsed.

   G-hour = 2 G turns

   As I recall the design sequence and without looking in the book...

   Were you using TNE, you would figure out how much volume of manuever
fuel you wanted to carry, calculate your fuel consumption rate in
kl/G-hour and divide.  Multiply the resulting number by 2 and that would
give you the number of G-turns of fuel you carry.  *Now*, if you have a
ship capable of 3G manuever, that means you can burn off up to 3 G-turns
of fuel per combat turn (30 minutes).  Once you burn off all your fuel,
you can do nothing but coast.

   Hope that helps a little...

   Well it **is** the responsibility of IG to turn out a product that
people will like and understand, not the "gearhead authors".  If a
"gearhead author" tries to explain something he/she wrote in response to
your question, he/she does so as a courtesy, not necessarily out of
obligation.  IG is the one with the obligation to provide an
explanation.

   I only wish that MMT was simply recycled TNE--it would have saved IG
many months of development time.  As for TNE being "stillborn" and all
the rest, bullshit.  TNE is/was an award winning product that has since
had many of its features stolen/borrowed/serve as inspiration for many
other game systems.  TNE sold well for the early part of its run, only
to fall victim to the ills that killed GDW (ills that had nothing to do
with TNE).

   I would argue that what\'s wrong with MMT in its current incarnation
is a result of IG *not* listening to the people on this list.  True,
there is a lot of fluff and hot air around here, but there are also some
damn good ideas as well.

>1) Make Wildstar\'s QSDS the standard ship-building system. 

   Already proposed by somebody from this list.

>2) Revamp FF&S 2 so that all the results are presented in QSDS stats

   Probably someone who belongs to this list working on it.

>3) Offer the techies on this digest a small royalty to produce Excel
spreadsheets for both PC & Macs so that ordinary folks can design
individual FF&S 2 components, then plug them into QSDS.

   Already done by members of this list.

   Gee, if the members of this list are such screw ups, why is it that
they have already acted on most of your suggestions?

   Then you put *way* too much faith in something that wasn\'t really
intended for people like you to start with.

   It sounds to me like you would be much happier buying a copy of High
Guard (the revised edition) and Trillion Credit Squadron.  I would also
recommend Fighting Ships of the Imperium for design examples.  These
provided me with many hours of fun back in the mid-80s.

   Once you find that High Guard bores you, or you figure out where all
the design flaws are (sorry, I\'m not telling  :-) ), you\'ll probably
want to move up to the basic Brilliant Lances system (this does not
require FF&S).  Assuming that you are willing to give MMT another chance
some day, download the latest version of QSDS from the Internet, find a
combat system that makes sense to you (one published by IG, or one
presented here) and have at it.

   Amen.

   Not at all.  This forum is labelled "venting allowed".  Just watch
the TNE bashing.

>I quit.

   Then you have learned nothing.  Hopefully something drew you to
Traveller besides a neat looking cover and the promises of IG.  Find the
version that fits with your gaming style and the desires of your players
and have at it.  It doesn\'t have to be any particular version or any
particular setting.  The point is that it has to work for you or you get
so frustrated you end up posting stuff to a mailing list and not caring
who you offend...

Eris,You have capture the exact thing I was trying to say. I also
include most of the sub-skills you mention under the steward banner.
That\'s why I brought it up. Earlier on (weeks ago) the list some one was
asking about minor adventures to use during jumps. I use tasks and
accidents around the JOBS preformed by crew members for this type of
filler.

I could go either way with this. The more a skill is cascaded (is that a
real word?) the more complex Character Gen becomes. After a while we
wind up with GURPS. While it\'s not a bad system and has a number of good
points when it comes to maknig up a "complete" character, it\'s
cumbersome.

I have noticed this as well and have started using a skill I\'ve called
"Watch Standing". I "issue" this as a default skill, 1/2 level per year
served aboard ship..."Refelects a general knowledge of ship bouard
operations. Typically a PC on watch can handle routine operation and
adjustments to ALL of the ship\'s systems and has the training to
recognize variations that require more skilled attention."...
Task: Stand Watch (time variable by schedule)
(Int+Watch Standing)+/- (mods) < Difficulty
a miss on the roll MIGHT NOT mean anything, or, the life support system
could be fouling. If it is then can the PC fix it themself or do they
need to call on the greater expertise of the STEWARD. (like how I fit
that in?)

    While I\'m not a feminist by any means, this is completely new situation in
Human history.  We\'ve _never before_ had the kinds of societal imbalances in
the gender ratios that are in the inescapable future for these cultures.
Throughout human history we\'ve been able to kill women without thought for the
consiquence because there were always more.  This is one of the reasons these
cultures are doing what they\'re doing.  They value boys and men more then girls
and women.  But it\'s from women that you get your next generation of
population!  So in a few years you\'re going to have militant countries filled
with desperate men surrounded by countries with more women then they have.
It\'s going to start wars like you wouldn\'t believe.  Or do you think armies of
100,000,000 men are all that easy to stop?

    You\'re very wrong, especially in modern warfare where cities filled with
civilians become targets of opportunity.  Look at the behavior of Iraq once
they\'d occupied Kuwait.  In some places the soldiers started shooting women and
children at random for the "entertainment value" of watching them die.  And War
is not population control, if anything it\'s a population booster. ;)

work the way that it *seems* to be assumed on this list.

=46irst of all, you need to understand the difference between an
epidemic and an endemic disease. Endemic diseases are generally those
that are not killers (or are not *normally* killers) -- though they
may start out that way. Think most of the childhood diseases --
measles, mumps, chicken pox etc. They have, in a sense, reached an
accommodation with their human hosts by not being *too* lethal. Thus
they are generally present in a human society at all times (though,
for example, with {AFAIR} Measles {maybe Mumps} they need a minimum
size population to be endemic ... 100k for Measles/Mumps, for
example).

Epidemic diseases are those (generally) that are lethal -- at least in
their initial appearance.

Think of them as being an ecological system -- the "successful"
diseases are the ones that do not kill off their hosts, do not make
them too ill to survive, and generally are not likely to cause major
numbers of deaths. In other words, they either mutate into less lethal
forms (which happens in some cases) or their human hosts develop
resistance which is inheritable to some degree (which happens in
others).

However, and this is an important point to note, the *really* lethal
diseases act too quickly for any immunity to evidence. Most such
diseases (from what I\'ve read, *all* of them, but others may have more
accurate medical knowledge to refute this) are animal diseases that
cross the species barrier and there are several possibilities as a
result --=20

1) They appear, cause an indeterminate amount of deaths -- usually so
quickly that they kill off all of the population they can reach before
they spread -- and then disappear, having been, in a sense,
unsuccessful by being too lethal! (Such as O\'nyong nyong fever -- seen
once in Africa in the 1970\'s and then disappeared, and there are other
examples as well, undoubtedly)

2) As per (1), but they return to their host animal population where
they regularly return to affect human populations when the conditions
become ripe.This is the case with diseases such as Bubonic plague.

3) They are *initially* relatively lethal, but immunity develops in
the host population *or* the only strain that "survives" is a not
normally lethal one.

This has important implications. The best diseases for Biowar are
therefore those that *no* human population has any immunity to. but
even those diseases are not hugely lethal --

Take two pandemics that we know of --

The Bubonic Plague of the 1300\'s -- it took repeated outbreaks over a
century to reduce the population of Europe by 1/3rd. Part of the
reason is that the fleas that carry the disease prefer Rats rather
than humans and only under the overcrowded and unsanitary conditions
of medieval europe did it have any real chance to spread. The recent
outbreak scare (1996?) in India was a joke to anyone who knew this --
it could have made inroads in India, but in the west? The general
standards of cleanliness and public health would have made it a
non-event. Of course, if it had mutated (as it does tend to) into the
*Pneumonic* version, which is spread by aerosol (from sneezing
"atishoo, atishoo, all fall down" has a much darker *real* meaning)
means, it is so lethal that it kills all (well, 96%+) within 24 hours,
that even with Jet airline travel it would not spread quickly enough
and widely enough (you have to be pretty close) to do any real damage.
Perhaps another 20 million deaths? Perhaps 100 million worldwide?
Probably not even close -- and most would be in the backward areas of
the world.

The Spanish Flu of 1918-19. This is *the* single most lethal Plague in
recorded history, and killed no more than 1-1.5% of world population
in around a year before dying out as quickly as it appeared. However,
the death rate was, in a sense, artificially inflated by a number of
factors that are not normally known -- for example, did you know that
the US Government made a *deliberate* decision to continue to ship
troops to Europe *even though they KNEW that the close conditions of
troopships would result in large numbers of deaths*. They did so to
send a message to their allies (as well as to their enemies) that they
were *serious* about fighting the war, *regardless of the casualties*.
Many more died in the trenches where they were kept in conditions that
would have relatively easily been avoided in civilian life.

=46or example, my father remembers the Flu epidemic (he was about five
or six) and remembers an aunt an uncle becoming ill, and then dying,
within 24 hours of first symptoms. He also remembers the precautions
that were mandated by the authorities locally to restrict the outbreak
- -- everyone had to wear a gauze mask in public; schools, churches,
picture theatres and other public places were closed; travel between
towns was restricted to those who had passes from the Police. It seems
to have worked, by and large.

Using diseases such as these as bioweapons, apart from the moral
considerations (and the Terrans were operating under UN auspices,
remember, which means that they have accepted that bioweapons are a
no-no -- all sorts of UN conventions say so!), is fraught with as much
danger to the users as to the targets.

The Plague of Duskir

Well, this is a real furphy -- the Plague is almost certainly the
Vilani "stab in the back" theory, I guess. There is no reason to
believe that the Vilani did not have enough medical knowledge of
diseases to have an idea of how to handle them (for reasons I\'ll
suggest below). It is *much* more likely that the social chaos
resulting from the collapse of the Ziru Sirka was the reason for any
die-back. By the way, it is my understanding that the die-back in
mesoamerica was due more to this factor than to disease *per se* --
those people were living so close to the bone that any disruption in
their normal economic patterns (mainly subsistence farmers) would
result in massive population losses -- lets look at the Roman Empire,
for example, the plagues that decimated the empire in the third
century are now thought to not have been as lethal as their results
would suggest. It has been suggested, and there is some evidence that
supports this, that Christianity received a great boost in this period
for the simple reason that Christians were the ones who, by and
large, provided simple aid to the sick -- preparing meals, providing
clean water, making sure they were warm and the like -- which
increased the survival rate greatly. Why? Well the Christains with
their idea of a pleasant afterlife, rewards therein (or actually
gaining entry thereto) for "charity" and the like meant they were
prepared to take risks that pagans were not ... the upshot is that
even simple help can increase survival rates markedly for even
epidemic diseases.

Now, the argument is that the Vilani were somehow more susceptible to
Terran diseases because of environmental factors -- to whit, having
been dumped on a planet with nothing biologically related to them.

OK, sounds reasonable? But, wait a minute! What about the Zhodani? The
Vargr? The other "minor" human races? Is there any evidence that any
of them suffered from anything like the "Plague of Duskir"? Or that
the Vilani were in any way affected by the diseases that they
inevitably carried -- even if it was a foreign strain of e coli! There
is no suggestion that Biowar (or even normal Terran diseases) has had
any effect on them. Yet they would, if the Vilani accounts are true --
and not exaggerations -- have been badly affected either then (or
later). There is no evidence of this, is there? Ergo, it seems, as I
suggested, that the "Plague" of Duskir was, as I said, the Vilani
version of Hitler\'s "Stab in the Back" ... their excuse for losing to
those "perfidious Terrans" ... rather than admitting that it was
superior Terran technolgy, tactics, industry and all the rest.

Well, that\'s my two cents worth anyway!

Marc,

Please consider expanding this skill to cover the cargo operations. It
would be extremely nice to get the Norton \'Cargo Master\' type character.
Looking at a CT type A2 for example, there are three mandatory crew
(Pilot/Nav, Engineer, and Steward/Medic). It would make sense for the
steward to be in charge of the cargo ops when pre-flighting the ship (IMO
of course!)

I would like to see a product at a similar level of simplicity to High
Guard that allows construction from TL9 through TL16, and up to 1 million
displacement tonnes. It is what I expected from the SSDS when I happily
bought starships.   <Sigh.>

Whatever goes in T4.1 needs to cover TL9 through TL15, not unlike the old
book 2. (I\'d prefer a MT type system, but I don\'t think that will happen...)

On the design system notes - when the copies of EA and CSC sell out (which
I would think they would being good products) why not reissue them as a
hardback, and cut out VDS if its compatibility is in question? An you could
add pictures for CSC ;-)

At the moment, although I own starships and VDS and QSDS I still use High
Guard and convert with Rob Flammang\'s excellent system.

All the characters I\'ve run through the T4.1 draft that Marc put out had
skill levels of 4 or less. There were at most 1 or 2 at skill-4, and a
couple of twos. Now, these characters were pseudo-random in generation (I
picked a few skills to slant them a certain way). I think that skills >5
will be rare, unless you allow players to powergame their generation. Which
I wouldn\'t as a GM.

One other thing:

Marc, the task statement is still mathematically incorrect. It should read

skill + stat > difficulty

to be correct.

Hear! Hear! That\'s exactly what *I* believe -- and 100% of the local
Traveller Gamers I know ... we\'re at the point where we genuinely
don\'t care when a new Traveller product comes out, look it over
carefully and then reject it as too flawed to use.

Its the reason I gave up doing Dark Star -- I had high hopes that T4
would go back to Trav\'s roots -- *Classic* Trave -- and forget the
abortions that were MTrav and TNE.

Even QSDS is too complex in many ways, but I can (barely) live with it

ignoring most of it.

This is a *MUST*. The game system is too effing complex to be usable
as is, even QSDS. I\'d be prepared to pay for such -- I\'ve got Greg
Porter\'s 3G3 Spreadsheet ... and it was well worth it. It turned 3G3
from a product that I admired but refrained from using due to
complexity to one that I will actually get around to using one of
these days when I get on with weapons tech for my current project!

Haven\'t seen FF&S2, don\'t know that I\'ll bother to buy it based on the
problems it seems to have. And I don\'t know of anyone who is really
expecting it to solve any problems at all, or who is really rushing
out to pre-order it locally.

This problem should resolve itself due to basic economics.  As the
quantity supplied of an item [brides] is reduced while the demand for
the product [brides] remains constant the market clearing price for this
item will rise. I.E. if there are fewer women to marry those that are
there will command higher bride prices, this will alter the perceived
value of female children, and the market for female babies will regain
equilibrium.

Of course in real life it could take a while, and some social changes,
for this equilibria to be reached.

No offense Leonard ( UPS is holding back the book from arriving at my FLGS

 If there are no game rules, then what exactly is the point of it?

Why would Yaskodray have bothered to fix the coding, this seems like too
much work to bother to do for slaves (even given that he understands
this code quite well).  If any of his human helpers/slaves got cancer he
could fix them easily with medicine of his TL.  Why bother to trim out
the chance of diseases you can fix with one miracle shot ?

In addition we know that minor races do not have better aging saves than
Solomani.  If they had had genetic problems snipped out they should
either receive a + to aging rolls, a + to their Endurance stats, or
both.

On the other hand maybe the Ancients did improve the genes of some
humans in some ways.  Perhaps this is why the Vilani have longer
lifespans.  If each servant lives longer your training cost per servant
per year is reduced since thay won\'t die off as rapidly requireing you

Harold it was always my impression that charecters in Traveller _did_
use the TL reference. IIRC in CT many adventures said thing like "the
library date on the planet Y says it had a UPP of B 686834-C".  I know I
have seen references in Traveller to charecters using the UPP
_which_includes_TL_.  How would the TL mean anything to the charecters
if TL was not standard terminology?

IIRC the Scout Service was the agency that used TL\'s. I think TNE\'s
Regency Sourcebook said that Scouts interdict planets with TL\'s less
than 5.  If the Scout Service did not use TL\'s how could this statement
have any meaning ?

to Marc how wonderful KB v.2 is, and Jay has probably triggered an entirely
new flamewar involving IG quality, freedom from gearhead oppression, and so
forth.  Good thing I\'m going on vacation; it looks like armageddon is just
around the corner.

	My opinions, FWIW, on all of the above:

1) I don\'t care about ROM TL.

2) I like KB v.2 and use it.  It\'s an improvement over T4, that\'s for sure.

3) I like the complexity of FF&S1 and FF&S2 (although with the latter I\'m
working with an incomplete playtester\'s draft so I can\'t fully exploit it).
Complexity permits me to maintain enough illusion of realism to keep my
inner hard-SF geek happy, and also add a great deal of flavour to my
campaign.  My players don\'t have to review my calculations when I describe
a 625,000 displacement ton airfoil airship drifting overhead like God\'s own
hang glider; hopefully, if I\'m in a good descriptive narration groove they
can just sit back and go "Wow!  This puppy\'s going to make the Hindenburg
look like a fizzled squib!".

4) IG and IG\'s future:  Well, early management IG bit, second-gen
management are still kinda clueless in a lot of ways, and things still
aren\'t perfect or properly integrated.  I\'m running a campaign using KB v.2
augumented with a lot of my own combat rules, set in Milieu 0, using gear
designed in SSDS, VDS, FF&S1 and FF&S2.  I routinely refer to some old MT
supplements Ross has.  Our group has bought several copies of the rulebook,
won Starships in a design contest, and bought Milieu 0, Emperor\'s Arsenal,
and CSC.  Players read M:0 for flavour, I use CSC and EA a lot, and
Starships we periodically look at and diss.  The main book we use for
chargen and the odd rule now and again when rules become strictly necessary.

	So basically, my game is a confused mish-mash of various systems
flying in close formation, and I\'m loving every second of it.  However, a
nice integrated, bug-fixed, proofread system would IMHO be preferable.  So,
my take on T4 (as opposed to RDETMMHBRKBM:0T [RDE\'s Totally Mish-Mashed
Home-Brewed Really Kit-Bashed Milieu:0 Traveller]) is that I\'m going to
wait for T4.1.  I\'m satisfied with the Frankensteinian rules set that I\'ve
thrown together in the short term.  However, I\'m going to take a close,
very close look at T4.1 when it comes out.  If it looks good, I\'m going to
buy it and use it.  And then I\'ll have a look at the other IG supplements
as they appear: second run of FF&S2 with the typos fixed, whatever the
combat system is published in, and so forth.  If they work, good.  If not,
I won\'t buy them.  I will still be able to get by.


	And I won\'t lose any sleep over IG.  Traveller (and RPG\'s in
general) are games; pleasant diversions.  I\'m very glad that Marc one day
got inspired to start writing Traveller; a lot of good times for a lot of
people, including myself, have ensued (thanks, Marc!).  However, it\'s still
just a game, and one which I\'m quite certain that I won\'t have nearly
enough time for in the future as I have a life, and one that\'s going to get
very busy in two weeks.  While I\'ll gladly stay up late to design the
latest Famille Spofulam crime against humanity, good sense, and good taste,
I can\'t really summon the mental energy to really get worked up enough to
seriosly flame people over Trav, or lose any sleep over the future of the
game.  If IG folds, my group and I will still have enough material for me
to work up another campaign, and we\'ll still be able to play it.  If we
take good care of the books (or scan them when they start dying), and are
still around 60 years from now in the same retirement home, we\'ll still be
able to play ( what with technical developments I think that Glenn and I
will have kitbashed significant changes to systems, design systems, maps,
and background though:)).  However, it\'d be nice for IG to still be around
churning stuff out; it\'d be useful.

	So that\'s my two cents.

	In the meantime, however, I\'m going on vacation for a week in this
nice little cottage up on the Ile d\'Orleans, down on the water.  Many fires
on the beach with my girlfriend snuggled up to me are in my immediate
future.  I will be back, although possibly via another ISP account as my
McGill student account is about to expire.  So have fun, play nice, and
chill out the lot of you :).

Population as at 1996 was 17.9 million, and growing at 1.2% per annum.
Expect growth rates to drop as migration and natural increase rates drop.
By 2100, at a wild guess, and discounting any major upheavals, I\'d put the
population at around 35-40 million.  Australia is also the world\'s most
urbanised nation, with almost 92% of the population living in urban areas.

I do have to disagree with having a \'space infrastructure\' rating of 1
(below Argentina?  sheesh!).  Granted, we don\'t have a huge infrastructure,
but some work goes on (work is going on at Woomera in conjunction with the
Japanese).  Given a leap of faith and some admittedly uncharacteristic will
by our typically spineless leadership, a large scale laaunch facility built
with the Japanese is not out of the question by 2100.  As a launch site,
northern Oz has some advantages:  reasonably close to the equator (10
degrees south at the tip of Cape York), lack of populated areas around if
things go wrong, one of the world\'s most stable political climates
(although that can change - who knows what\'ll happen), a technological
infrastructure in place already and (maybe someday) a robust and
diversified economy.  Well, I can live in hope can\'t I?

ObTrav:  in E21, Cape York may well be the site of an international launch

interesting setting, if espionage, double dealing an dcorporate

	It wasn\'t really first contact, we could not prove absolutely that the
Russians might not disguise their most advanced test craft as an alien ship
(with Sumerian type writing inside).  After all, the Vilani just can\'t walk
up and ask for their ship back without raising BIG questions.  In addition
the Russians won\'t admit to sending a spy craft over the U.S..

	At best the ship would be disected for study, and the \'human\' occupants
would be placed in cold storage.  After about five years of deliberation
the comittee(sp?) in charge of black projects would finally agree to
funding the construction and testing of both the engines and power supply.
The control systems would be beyond their understanding, but their studies
would reveal the basics: the devices are made of silicon, and switch
voltages on and off. (Assume they discover this by disecting a 50Amp Field
Effect Transistor in an SOT-23 package, which is beyond our own TL even now).

	I\'m assuming that the Vilani vessel wasn\'t jump capable.  In which case,
the U.S. would have both a working, low output fusion plant and a low
thrust Heplar (or T Plate) drive.  The T Plate option could explain the
hyper-velocity vehicle\'s that fly over the LA area (usually on thursdays),
since there isn\'t a contrail seen in either case.  Hmm, maybe it could
explain what that IR camera on the shutle saw few years ago (you know:
maneuvering space ice)?  Say that it was Earth ships fending off Vilani
smugglers or Vargr raiders.  Hmm, isn\'t there an Ancients site on Mars?

	Well at any rate, the Roswell incident makes for great speculation in
Traveller.

   The epsiode in question was the two-parter that featured the "Super

   I\'m afraid that S:AAB would have been much better off had it been
syndicated and never saw network TV (shown here on the Fox network). 
Star Trek taught that lesson years ago.  There are just too many
pressures associated with dealing with network broadcast here (mostly
involving money) for a worthwhile sci-fi TV series to be made for a TV
network.

   BTW, before anyone chimes in, \'X Files\' is *not* sci-fi.  You might
make a case that some episodes are sci-fi horror, but that is not the
overall theme.

   I will admit that initially, S:AAB was rather dark (perhaps too much
so, which may be why it didn\'t catch on in Finland) and grittier than
most people were used to (ditto--too much Dr. Who brainwashing).  If you
stuck around for the entire run, subtle changes were made to the story
that "lightened" it up a bit and made it more optimistic (it appeared
that the humans might just be able to prevail in the end).

>        Anyways, Star Trek (in all of its multi-tentacled, horrifying 
>incarnations) and Babylon 5, and even Earth 2 (way too new age for 
>me, though) are far more popular in Finland than S:AAB ever was.

   Babylon 5, Star Trek: DS 9 and ST: Voyager are syndicated here in the
U.S. (yes, Voyager appears on the UPN network, but few people get that
on cable, and UPN was launched in part to feature Voyager, not vice
versa).  There are plans to take Bab 5 to a network (TNT) here in the
States--I predict dire consequences when that happens, unless the deal
is similar to the one Voyager has now (small network w/syndication). 
Earth 2 was featured on network TV here and died the usual sci-fi series
death (I heard rumors of possible syndication, but nothing came of it as
far as I know).

   The Roddenbury Rule still applies: If you want to do sci-fi on TV, do
it in syndication.

Again, with the " conspiracy theory " theme, maybe we have and the public
just isnt finding out.  < and no, I dont really believe this is happening,
but I believe it has potential for being an interesting game background >. 


Maybe we could only salvage parts for computers and cds .......

In the campaign I\'ve been running for years, the Roswell crash was a Vilani
scout ship and everything possible from it was then reproduced in the hope
that the vessel could be reproduced.  It could not.  However, the tech
drawings and so forth survive until the Terrans could build a jump drive
based on the Vilani ship.  I always used this as an explanation as to why
the Terrans used jump for interplantary use at first and not intersolar.

I know its a bit difficult to justify, but it is fun and thats what counts
right?

I\'ve always had it this way in the campaign I\'m running  ( as well as the
Tunguska blast being yet another downed vessel ).  I realize that it is far
fetched, but sometimes those ideas make the best backgrounds.

Well, first of all, that was me you quoted, not Leonard.

The point of FFS2 is to be able to design all sorts of ships, vehicles, and
gadgets for your Traveller campaign.  That\'s it.  The original FFS copy
read something like "other games give you a catalog, we give you the factory."

FFS2 is not an easy product to use, but if you perservere you end up with
amazing results.  Probably the best thing about the whole concept is that
you get away from generic "autopistols" and "Free Traders".. You can have a
GT CombatMaster in your holster as you pilot your CBW "Roland" class Far
Trader.

FFS is a tool to allow a greater variety in your game.

I would hazard a guess that this is the role that QSDS fills..  a simple
yet fulfiling design sequence for those who don\'t enjoy number crunching
with FFS.

While I have great memories of HG, I strongly prefer the less generic feel
of the modern design sequences.

I think that the latest revision of QSDS needs to go in, with as many
packages as possible.  Perhaps some of us gearheads could write up QSDS
articles for the Journal?

The important thing is that whichever system is used, the end result ship
stays the same.. No matter how it was designed, the stats all read in the
standard format.

I\'d like to see something like that happen next summer, to be honest, I\'m
getting a little tired of having to re-buy product.

It seems obvious that the US will not make it to Mars anytime sooner than
2018.  This is due to political and fiscal considerations.  Popular support
for planetary exploration doesn\'t exist on the level required for Congress
to fund it.  The US government is currently interested in balancing the
budget to ensure we don\'t dig ourselves deeper into debt or bankrupt the
nation.  (At least the USG is interested in making it seem like they\'re 
trying to do so.)  Sadly, this is not the climate for expenditures on space 
exploration.

Does canon then require that we adhere to a badly dated timeline?  I believe
that for the sake of continuity, canon should be adhered to to avoid 
invalidating previous materials, but I don\'t want to play in a SF game that
is fantasy.  I\'ll play Rolemaster instead.  That\'s why I don\'t even think 
about playing Twilight 2000 anymore (now Armor 21 would have been a 
different matter).  For Traveller to remain "HARD SF," its future history
must be plausible.  UNSCA isn\'t going to happen soon and I believe that 
a new future history, suitably vague for the next 25 years ("wars and wars 
and rumours of wars") should be constructed.  UNSCA should/could be there
but should be deemphasized.  Once real money is on the table, the US
can be counted on to ignore anything the US says.  I\'m not proud of that
fact, but I perceive it to be the reality of the situation (and I\'m a Yank).

There are other areas in Traveller that MUST be refined in order to keep
the game apace with current technology.  Future technologies (for example,
6MW/m3 TL15 fusion Rx) won\'t be affected, as within reason, we can tweak 
the future efficiencies to make them consistent with previous pubs.  

But current tech should match current capabilities.

I don\'t agree that TL is merely a Referee tool.  I used too, but after
years of reading Traveller stuff, especially Regency Sourcebook, I
concluded that the Imperium does numerically gage local TLs.  I believe 
that the Vilani imposed the first system of this type, much along the 
lines of the Major/Minor Race thing.  An artificial construct designed 
to socially supress other races by subordinating their technological 
developments to the one technology the Vilani reigned supreme in, Jump 
Tech. It was in the interests of the RoM to perpetuate this system, 
and in the interests of the 3I to do so as well.

Like many such numerical measures (e.g. GNP, Unemployment%), these
are tools designed to reflect certain data.  Humans measure things
when it benefits them.  

A better measure of TL is closely coordinated with energy production,
but all regimes of techology should be measured.  From these figures,
a composite or "figure of merit" TL can be developed.

This was something I had to give some thought to when planning an 
adventure where the players discover an derelict Vilani warship. 

In the good old days of yore, ie Book 5 High Guard, there was a 
tech level limit on the size of computer you could install in a 
ship, which in turn imposed a limit on the hull size (I know this 
must all sound unbearably primitive to all you FF&S fans, but such 
were conditions then). At tech level 11, that of the First 
Imperium Vilani, the maximum displacement was 50,000 tons, so a 
1st Imperium dreadnought would be the size of a 3rd Imperium 
strike cruiser. 

Things were even worse for the Earthmen. At tech level 10, as they 
were at the start of the Interstellar Wars (recapping briefly for 
all those who have chosen not to wade through the sixty thousand 
lines of text devoted to Solomani tech levels that have been 
posted to the TML) the maximum ship size was 10,000 tons -- those 
Vilani must have laughed when they saw the pride of Earth\'s 
\'\'national squadrons under a tenuous fleet control by UNSCA\'\' 
coming for them, forgetting that it\'s not how big it is that\'s 
important, but how you use it.

In this case, I\'ll just keep using KBv2.0, with Marc\'s new T4.1

I was hoping with T4.1 that I could use it as is, without beefing up

I see.  So, you are not really changing the skill/task system that T4 
currently has?  I thought that you had indicated that you were doing 
this--increasing the value of skills.

The system in T4.1 will be the same we have now, except for your 
changes to the difficulty codes?

I would not say "NO RULES", rather, I would say "Design sequences only - NO
RULES to use the resulting products in combat."  It is a very useful book,
as it gives the sequences and the assumptions behind them for a number of
common traveller technologies, which lets people like me design exactly the
ship I want, or the tank I want.  As people do this, they often post the
resulting designs, which then can be codified in a table for people who do
not want this.  There are a lot of useful pieces of data hiding in here,
but it is not a book on starship combat.  It does include a very good
section on how to design such a thing in general, which points out that you
do need to know the mission of the vessel and your resources.

I read FF&S2, liked it, and thought it was one of the most useful books I
could have had added to my game.  One of my players agrees, as she also
designs ships, etc., for fun.  Another player wants background material,
and finds ti a useless supplement.  Different strokes.

In the game two weeks ago, one of my players had a hydroponics as a hobby.
The player wanted to grab a whole lot of gear for their scout vessel.  This
turned out to be fortuitous, as they are playing the Long Way Home, in
which they might face a two+ year voyage home.  With FF&S2, I can tell the
player exactly what the hydroponics gear they bought can do.

This is not minor, BTW, I have issues like that come up all the time in the
game.  (How powerful a computer can I put in my suitcase?  Can I create a
claymore made of superdense?  Will the plasma jet from the grav car go
through my armor?)  This is a book that lets me, the DM answer the
questions in a consistent way.

Note: I find that most SF game\'s equipment lists look exactly like the
magic items list in the DMs guide, without a single helpful chart for items
that runs from the tech level the players are at to the tech level the
world they are on is at.  How in the hell am I supposed to handle "Magic
Physics" when my players are as smart as I am.  I can make stuff up, but
then I run into consistency problems later.  I would rather have the
underlying system fairly well laid out, which FF&S does, and then add in my
interpretations as need be.

Not all groups have players as clever and inventive in technology as mine,
from the response to this book, but it seems that many do.  I have seen
half a dozen different groups, and every group had at least one person who
could tweak a system to their benefit, and who did it in character.  This
is the kind of book that lets you stay ahead.  They can still tweak, but
then you and they are at least working with the same rules.

Now, it is the case, that one of my players likes table driven starship
design - QSDS is just about perfect, but he would like something perhaps
even a bit simpler.  I created such a thing - QSDS tables for ships from
100 to 2000 tons with 1, 2, and 3 jump, and 1,2, 3, and 4 G TL 11 and 12
drives in them.  I also added special power plants and crew quarters to
each weapons, so he can assemble a ship literally as a small collection of
black boxes, as long as it is in one of the twenty sizes and uses one of
the standard armaments packages.

I suspect there are others who want to go this way, and I also suspect that
QSDS will be updated where need to take into account the new rules.  From
what I have seen, there will not be major tweaks needed, but there will be
minor ones.

I do not think this is yet another IG foul up.  I do think the overly short
playtest and the typesetting problems are.  The typesetting detracts form
the book, but I have not found any major flaws in the copy.

If you ever design ships, or have techie players, this one is worth a read.
It may not form the core of your use, as it just screams out for the
equivalent of Starship Assembly Line (a most useful Java program, written
by James Dempsey), that implements it, but it is still fun.

An interesting post.  What is the source for the 50 Amp FET in the SOT-23 
package?  (BTW, I\'m not familiar with the acronynm "SOT." What does it stand 
for?)

Just because the US may have "black project" vehicles doesn\'t imply we
received the tech from offworld. Quantum mechanics established the 
theoretical framework for semiconductors a long time before 1947.  Why
do so many people want to assume that humans can\'t figure anything out
themselves?  Todays tech can be clearly traced back over 300 years, 
all the way back to Watt, Newton, Leibnitz and others. Is there objective
evidence to the contrary or are people just so ignorant of science and
technology that they want magical hand-me-downs instead?

Anyone who knows any different, plese e-mail me privately as this is
falling off-topic.

DRAT! DRAT! I for one won\'t be using the d3. Having a single half die in
the middle of a d6 progression is jarring and (for me) unacceptable. Ok,
call me weird, d10\'s, d20\'s, even dF\'s I\'ll use, but not d3\'s.

The number of skills and the levels of those skill is going to be too low
for me.  That\'s OK though, I\'m going to have to rewrite the entire
character generation sequence anyway to get the effects I\'m looking for.

>All the characters I\'ve run through the T4.1 draft that Marc put out had

Same here, *too* few skills and levels *too* low unless you keep that
abomination (d3) at difficult.

>One other thing:

>Marc, the task statement is still mathematically incorrect. It should read

>to be correct.


Numbers in parenthese used as examples:

Task succeeds if...Difficulty(3d6) <= Stat(7) + Skill(3)

That\'s now I\'m going to write it, but

Task succeeds if...Stat(7) + Skill(3) >= Difficult(3d6)

works too.

<FNORD> If you want the conspiracy to end all conspiracies, then the
"aliens from Roswell" were Vilani scouts, and the push to develop missile
technology during the late 40\'s and early 50\'s *was* in response to the
possible arrival of "their friends" with warships.

Then in the late 57 they arrived.  Not with warships, but with ship loads
of "Sociological Adjustment Agents" who infiltrated the infrastructure of
the major nations with the goal of "preparing Earth for eventual
integration into the Imperium."  

By the late 60\'s, they had toned down the space-race by convincing the
"powers that be" that it was just too hard, too expensive, too politically
difficult to continue to push into space.  They were behind the development
of Star Trek and it\'s, "friendly human looking" aliens. They moved us from
"War of the Worlds" to "My Favorate Martian" in just a few years.

In the middle 70\'s a team of deep cover agents (lead by Marc Miiler)
working in Normal, IL, produced a roleplaying game called Traveller that
appealed to the brightest and most creative young of the minor race on
Terra.  It\'s goal was prepare the next generation of young Terrans for what
was to come.

After 30 years of direct manipulation, they have effectively delayed the
solomani "breakout" into the solar system, so as to make us accept our role
as a "minor race" in their Empire.  They have broken up one major nuclear
power and softened the other, to make it less likely that we will resist
*too* much.  They have firmly planted the idea of "human looking
alien=good", "buggish looking alien=evil" (I wonder why *that* is) in the
minds of the solomani.

How much longer before we are fully prepared for integration?  <FNORD>

BTW, it\'s safe to tell you all this, because you won\'t believe..now.
However, you will remember, and when the time comes will accept and embrace
your future.

	Sorry, this isn\'t in FF&S2.  Hopefully, there will be an FF&S3, 
or at least a series of JTAS articles, that cover this and other topics

   It was always my impression that TL started out in CT as something
that was intented as a referee/player tool, and that if any handwaving
attempts were made later to make it into something else, they were not
what was originally intended.

   When you think about it, how in the heck would a Vilani/Terran/Sylean
committee be able to determine something was TL 13+, when other than a
few mysterious devices left behind by the Ancients, there are no points
of reference to gauge TL?  So you say that TL was thought up by scouts
of the Third Imperium.  OK, how do they gauge what TL is appropriate for
the invention of the Relativity Rifle?  Is it TL 17 or 25 (the correct
answer according to MT\'s RC is 21)?

   My point is that a TL scale that assigns a number to a world works
fine from the *character\'s* perspective so long as you are looking
backward technologically speaking, but would fall apart rapidly if you
are trying to project forward.  That\'s why the TL scale is better
thought of as a referee/player tool--it works both forwards and
backwards.

You should read "The Gatekeepers" by Daniel Graham, Jr. (ISBN 0-671-87716-x).
It\'s a great book that portrays a disguised MacDonal Douglas as building and
operating their Delta Clipper launch vehicles in blatant disregard of the 
US government.  The US declines to pay for the ship(s) and MD decides to
launch from Cape York.

It\'s a good story and I like the Delta Clipper concept. (I\'ve heard all the 
arguments why it won\'t work, but it appears that LM X33 is going to be an
operational nightmare (IMNSHO).  LM only got the X33 contract because their
ship already exists in a black program).

Fair point. I like the CT/T4 minimalist descriptions, because combined with

I agree, and if you could put in design tips like those in some of the
TD/MTJ and in Imperiallines 1 it would be very helpful.

Yes. This is where T4 is falling down. One way around it would be to kill
Starships off by putting the construction rules in the Naval Architect\'s
Handbook (Eg tips on deckplans, the design sequence *and* something like
the SOpM in a nice hardback book ;-) not that this will ever happen!)

That\'s the crux I think, as FF&S2 is at a different level to SSDS, QSDS. Me
- - I own FF&S1 and I really liked it as a product, and from the review I
will look at FF&S2 and buy it if it matches the same standard. I use HG as
I know  can build a ship in 30 min and be happy with it, and convert it to
T4. As I\'m rerunning CT stuff with a T4/MT/CT hybrid (and, horror of
horrors I allow ships designed under all three...) it fits in just nice.

of some import.  On page 105 the rocket tables seem to be incorrect: 

Table 166 lists liquid fuel rockets as having Fuel Rates of around 1
m^3/hr/kN for normal rockets and around 7 m^3/hr/kN for Liquid Hydrogen
rockets. 

Then in table 167 (Nuclear Rockets) the Fuel Rate for nuclear rockets is
84 m^3/hr/kN for ordinary nuclear rockets around 60 m^3/hr/kN for advanced
nuclear rockets and 1.43 m^3/hr/kN for gas core nuclear rockets

Now, I know for a fact that nuclear rockets, are notably more fuel
efficient than liquid fuel rockets and that gas core nuclear rockets are a
whole hell of a lot more fuel efficient than ordinary liquid fuel rockets. 

Even allowing for the fact that LOX+LH (listed here as HRF) rocket fuel is
4.3 times a dense as pure liquid hydrogen, the discrepancy between Fuel
rates of 84 and 7 seems unlikely. Even if you convert and go purely by
kg/hr/kN solid core nuclear rockets have a fuel rate 2.7 times that of
liquid fuel rocket of the same TL.  This is clearly impossible. 

My guess is that the fuel rates for all the fission rockets are marked up
by a factor of 10, but I have no way of knowing for sure. many of the
folks who worked on this book are on this list.  Could anyone post the
correct figures?

This is an interesting and useful game mechanic, but I need just a bit more
explanation. Does this mean the character cannot contribute to the task
roll for a character with a Soc outside +/- 2 of his or her own Soc? Does
it mean that the character is personally uncomfortable dealing with someone

I would like a definitive answer on whether the chargen rules are designed
to produce \'typical\' characters one meets every day or \'heroic\' characters
with abilities beyond that of the average person. I can run a campaign
either way, but in either case there should be guidelines for creating the
other type of character. If player characters have only their goals and
personal drive that make them different there should be rules for making a
naturally gifted or powerful character. If the players are supposed to be
the cream of humaniti there should be rules for creating ordinary employees
and opponents.

I use this idea too, but only in cases where the character has trained in
the skill off their home world. Otherwise, all skills are learned at the
tech level of the character\'s home world, which is written on the character
sheet.

There should also be rules for using skills at different tech levels than
what one has trained at. I posted my rules for such situations to the TML a
while ago, but in general an armorer would get a -1 DM for each tech level
below his or her training the task is, or an additional task die for each
tech level above his or her training. The complete rules define a "degree
of separation" to determine the actual modifier, but this would be a
typical ruling assuming the character was otherwise familiar with the task
to be done.

    Ah come on Marc, that\'s weak and you know it!  Traveller is VERY
Eurocentric in terms of cultural bias.  Where are all the Indian colonies?
Given their population pressures you have to KNOW they tried to ship some of
them off to the stars.  And all the ones who went would not have been speaking
the Queen\'s English!
    What about China?  Indonesia?  Africa?  South America?  Where in Traveller
Canon is the mention of the doubtlessly MASSIVE contribution they made?  I\'m

Combined they only make 3/4 of the Human population. ;)

Darrians book that Darrian women are the object of no little envy because their
genetics don\'t dictate the subcutanious storage of fat as Solomani genes do!
Also don\'t discount the survival pressures of those new worlds, Vland was not a
forgiving world to early humans after all and that might have weeded out
whatever bad genetic expressions that did pop up.
    Makes you wonder at the reaction of the Vilani and other humans, used to
fairly homogenious races when they run into the staggering diversity of the
Solomani.  And then they find out about all these weird genetic problems???

The problem in India currently being that the price if a bride is negative
(ie, the groom requires a dowry... a refrigerator and a motor cycle for
example). Since that tradition has been going on for centuries, it will be a
while before dowry turns into a bride price.

I\'ve always thought the Terrans might have avoided deliberate bio-war for
both military and social reasons.  First off, as soon as they realize the
full extent of the Ziru Sirka ("What do you _mean_, Dingir is just a
provincial capital?!"), the strategists will realize that, to have any
chance of success, they\'ve got to harness the industrial power of captured
Vilani worlds, meaning they need to keep the workers alive.  (S&A implies
they were already vat-cloning as many pre-fab colonies as possible, but
those needed time to develop infrastructure).  Furthermore, the Terrans
have to seem humane and "better" than the Vilani if they\'re to, first,
hold on to captured Vilani populations and, second, win over other Vilani
subject races.  So bio-war is a big loser on both the military and public-
relations/diplomatic fronts.

Why can\'t you have both?  I\'d think it quite likely that, as trade and
economic issues start to get handled by multinational alliances (NAFTA,
EU, ASEAN, whatever), many of the existing (economic) reasons for a
nation-state would wither away -- but instead of having a state subverted
to the larger unit, you\'d have a profusion of smaller cultural or ethnic
regions.

My own E;21 notes, from when I tinkered with the concept a year or so ago,
have Europe split between the European Union (Eire, Scandinavian nations,
and the German-dominated states of central and Eastern Europe)  and the
Union d\'Gibraltar (Spain, Euskardi, Catalunya, Galicia, Portugal, France,
Bretagne, Burgundy, Corse, a few Italian states, Hellas, and a whole mess
of former French African colonies -- oh, and Quebec way across the sea, to
match England, Scotland, and Wales in the Atlantic Free Trade Alliance --
period newspapers describe these as "spies in each camp").

	In India you have to give money (quite a lot) to marry a girl.
	India is still using "sudden child dead" as Femicide. 

	Back to Traveller :

	At a given techlevel any population will increase until it
	has reached a limit where agra production can feed people.
	The lower the techlevel the low those people per sqare mile
	limit. Under a certain TL (6-) war is typical kind of population
	control, the lower the tech level the less deadly is the war,
	as its not the intension of war to destroy everything but to
	conquer area. Even in TL1 cultures, where war seldom killed,
	warriors have a high value. Humans still are domesticated
	apes (some say geneered ;-) and males stronger than females
	tend to suppress the later. When the maximum population level
	is reached wars increased, the value of warriors increased,
	so the value of man over women increased - femicide is used
	to have a higher value in the clan ( you can only feed 5
	children, 4 of them should be warriors ) and rape of woman
	from other clans who didnt use femicide one generation ago.
	Lowtech war always mean "murder, conquer, rape" ! Even at
	medium techlevels 6-9 rape is often the follower of murder
	and conquer.  At higher techlevels rape is becoming unusual
	as the goal of war changed to fast destruction of production
	capacities.

	Femicide is common practice on many overpopulated low tech
	planets during the Long Night and the Colapse. I think
	Femicide should be a culture shock for any M0 character
	leaving warm and clean Sylea to explore the wilds.

No, they used magic reaction drives that let fighter sized ships launch
from earth and rendevous with a task force at Jupiter without
refueling. And do so in only a few hours (*nobody* can fly a fighter
longer than that, between fatigue and the lack of a bathroom...)

They also had the Trojan asteroids within sight of Jupiter. And aliens
heading for Earth going past the task force at velocities so low that
several minutes of combat at visual ranges were possible...

Sorry, but the science in S:AAB *sucked*.

The *concept* had potential. The implementation destroyed all hope of

have the Library Data in the MT set.  I\'d like to know a little more about
them, biologically, and would appreciate if anyone could help me out.  I\'m
not really looking for references to long out of print books (I\'m trying to
get as much old Traveller stuff as possible, but its difficult), just a
little background...

     I also started re-reading the Regency sourcebook (Among other books) to
get a feel for the psychology of the Imperium (especially where crime is
concerned), and I came across the data on Project Longbow and the Empress

FFS2 was stated to be the no-math-barred gearhead design system.  A
developer\'s tool as it were.  It was never, ever, pitched or talked
about as anything else (here or on the beta list).

I think that you miss the point. Think of a detailed design system
like FFS/FFS2 as a traveller _developer_\'s document.  Use software
developement as an analogy.  All of us have played Doom, or
Marathon, or Quake, but only some "gearhead geeks" among us could
(or have) actually made a Doom or Quake out of the ether.

In this analogy FFS2 is a programming language.  QSDS is a "level
editor" to follow the analogy, FFS2 is C++.  The rest of us
users will see final designs.  If you don\'t want complications, use
SSDS or QSDS.  Somebody with a spreadsheet will knock out extended
hull tables and weapons for ships above 5000 dtons (BTW, there is
already such a hull table for QSDS posted).

> Oh, it will all be made right in the NEXT frigging book, will it? I

SSDS and QSDS were made with FFS (with modifications), period.  It
sounds like if either of these systems had more plug-ins your
complaints wouldn\'t exist.  Given that a "secret" fixed FFS version
is the basis of the later, easy to use design systems, it makes
sense to print the damn thing so that others with the desire can
make more plug-ins.

FFS2 was made from the ground up as what it was, the underlying
system for designing stuff.  Real units were used wherever possible
so that regardless of what combat system that gets used, they can
all convert from a set of units that doesn\'t end up being "hit
points" or some such crap.  There would have been a final stat
within a design sequence had the combat system (*any* combat system)
existed.

BS.  There is no requirement for a complex combat system at all.
The idea was that the underlying techy rules should be made
available to people that wanted to make plug-ns for the other system
that were consistant.  If you don\'t want to do the math, wait for
plug-ins----the plug-in developers now have the tools to make them
for you, sheesh.

It *is* the design system.  All the sub-parts were made with FFS
(you know, that TNE abomination).  By your logic QSDS should be
tossed because it is tainted with math under the surface where you
can\'t see it. The whole point of something like FFS2 is that if you
make stuff for QSDS it is consistant.

No, it\'s not mandatory.  USE QSDS.  I notice that in MT you were
stuck using the systems printed, no?  I guess if you found out that
there was a guideline for making up these systems for MT you\'d be
pissed that they wrote it down.

The arguement above is like saying that since the Ramayana is
printed in sanscrit, you aren\'t allowed to read a translation to
english (or hindi for that matter).

Having a converter to QSDS would\'ve been great at the end of FFS2.
These hated gearheads you talk about did the damn thing with no
chance to really put it together they way they might have liked,
and it would have been _really_ nice if any of us had had the
slightest idea what the combat systems would be like in advance
(note that the T4 combat system was _supposed_ to look like HG, and so
QSDS was designed to produce numbers that would work in this
system----then we get the combat system that isn\'t in the same
ballpark *sigh*.

Funny that you\'ve been waiting for it for 6 months... so you knew
about it before a few days ago, hmmm.  If you read about it on the
net you shouldn\'t be surprised.  It\'s been publicly stated any time
it\'s come up that it was gonna be at least as complicated as FFS (on
 formula level).  The idea was to reoreder it so it was easier to
use even though it uses formulas instead of plug-in tables.

You have been flamed, true.  It is because you chose this product as
the focus of your rant.  It is actually what it claims to be,
with a some errata, but pretty good.  The lack of a combat system to
*use* it with, is a major flaw.  The fact that SSDS and QSDS were
built with FFS, and not FFS2 is another problem.  There (had it been
put in the proper order) you are right to some extent.

It should have been FFS2 (even if unprinted first), then QSDS, along
with a combat system to use it (which should\'ve been in beta when
FFS2 was being worked on).

Since someone appears to be working on the background for the Interstellar
Wars I\'d like to take the opportunity to suggest an idea that I had some
time ago: That many of the Vilani planets at that time were medium-population 
planets rather than high-pop. Not all of them, of course; Vland itself and
propably many homeworlds of minor races would be high-pop. But most planets
that had been colonized by the careful, methodical Vilani would have a
population in the 10s or at most 100s of millions. This is a big enough
population to run a high-tech society and low enough that ressources are
not strained. Population control would be a matter of course.

As a result, the Vilani Empire, while still vastly larger than the Terran
Confederation, would at least be one or perhaps two orders of magnitude
smaller than one would expect if Year 1100 population figures were used.

I believe you misremember. As far as I recall the subject was never mentioned
anywhere. What was mentioned, however, was that Yaskodray had 20 children
(actually, clones, since they were exact duplicates of him) himself and that
each of the kids had "about 20" childern themselves. So the kids, at the
very least, was capable of cloning themselves.

Of course, you can always establish that Grandpop had all his kids and
gramdkids brainwashed into never thinking about reproducing themselves,
but if he did that, why didn\'t he just introduce a generic "obey me"
order? As I see it neither he, nor any of the children ever considered
the possibility that he and they would one day be at odds. Hence the
2000 year long period of warfare when it finally happened.

Fine, but change \'melee\' to something like \'martial arts\' or \'unarmed 
combat\'.

I brought up these points *ages* ago, but never got an answer I liked. 
One way of dealing with it is to say that \'real\' gravity passes through 
but \'artificial\' gravity doesn\'t.

I\'m ready! I\'ve always wondered what happened to the Mars probe previous
to 
the current lander (as a member of the Planetary Society, my name was
actually on it, dang it!). It get a little too close to the ol\' Survey
ship there, Marc? :)

Kinda interesting that one of the early DGP TravDigests had an adventure
centering around a _very_ old holocrystal documenting a scouting mission
to
the world of a minor race. In trying to promote the development of a
world
government, the scouts accidently set off a world war which ended with
the
use of nuclear weapons. Seems the locals didn\'t having too high an
opinion
of themselves, calling their world "Dirt" or somesuch...look in the
issue
entitled "Vland", I think.

My take.  Trying to interact with folks from outside your peer group wouild
be more difficult.

I\'m a middle class blue collar worker (say about Soc 6); I know how to
interact with my peers in my enviroment, and I\'m a fairly fun guy at
parties, so lets say that I have Carousing-1.

If I were to attend a large society function, I\'d be lost.  I\'d have no
reference point on what was acceptable behavoir.  In a similar vein, if I
were to go to a rave done in the Excelesior district, I\'d also have a
difficult time interacting.

For a PC, apply additional difficulty to any Carousing task when the
average SOC of the group is more than +/-2 different from the character\'s SOC.

Of course, it could be a (humorous) cooperative task, with the one SOC C pc
leading his compatriots through a series of misadventures at the Duke\'s Ball...

The problem, is that in the places we\'re talking about, you still have to
_pay_ the groom to get your daughter married. Women are considered
liabilities from the moment they\'re born...it will take a LOT of upheaval
before people actually _pay_ the fathers of the bride to get married.

After all, killing your wife because she didn\'t bring in enough dowry is
still relatively common in rural India. You keep what she brought in, and
_hey_ you\'re single again! Try again!

Also, this is a deeply engrained human behavior, dowries or their
equivalent, persist in nearly all culture to this day. Why do you think
it\'s traditional for the _brides_ family to pay for the (often lavish)
wedding?

Talk about Traveller looking!!  This pic looked great, and it had a 
lot of Traveller technology.  It\'s nice to have a high budget movie 
like this so that I can point to it and say to my players, "this is 
what it normally looks like."

The only real big deviation from Traveller were the Grav-tanks.  
Evidently, the ships in the movie don\'t have inertial compensators, 
so the crew gets into these water tanks which somehow protects them 
from the 30 Gs put on by their main drive.

The movie\'s tech was a little low--I\'d say about TL10.  They don\'t 
have (or, actually, just got) FTL drives;  their space suits are 
pretty bulky (I saw a show about the film on cable which said that 
the costumes for the space suits weighed 70 lbs!--which is about the 
same as a Traveller TL9 suit, BTW).

It looks like they\'ve got their M-Drives up to Traveller standard, 
though.  It took some 72 hours for the ship to reach Neptune from 
Earth.

The look of the film is incredible--one of the best sci-fi looking 
movies I\'ve seen in a long time.  It\'s done in the tradition of 
Alien, Blade Runner, and Outland, so everything looks dirty, 
functional, and real.

There\'s a scene where a man goes into space without a suit, and I\'ll 
be derned if they didn\'t get that right--according to the NASA web 
site info that I read from a source right here on the TML.  It was 
good for my players to see that seen because they all had pictures of 
Outland\'s head explosions in their minds.

All in all, it is a decent flick.  This movie could have been 
incredible though.  It\'s got a lot of build up, some very scary 
scenes, and a lot of unanswered questions at the end.

I personnally felt that the ending was too weak for all the suspense 
and build up, but another friend who went with me liked all of the 
unanswered questions because it made him think about it after the 
movie was over.

For those of you who don\'t know, the plot is this:  seven years ago, 
Earth\'s first FTL ship was launched, and after it did, it was never 
heard from again.

Until now.

There it is, in a decaying orbit around Neptune.  The scientist who 
designed the ship is dispatched with a rescue crew to see what 
happened.

When they get there, their minds start playing tricks on them.  They 
start seeing physical incarnations of their sins and objects of 
their insecurities (a la Flatliners).  But, it becomes clear real 
fast that the ship didn\'t just jump to another galaxy--it jumped into 
hell and came back.

This film has a lot of religious overtones.  The look of the film is 
also reminicent of religious structures.  The ship itself is shaped 
like a cross.  I understand the production crew went to several 
famous European churches and scanned in pictures of archways and 
walls into the computer, manipulated them, and used these layouts for 
the sets of the interior of the ship.  You can see large, round 
archways on the ship, but instead of blocks, there are metal plates.

Also the gravity drive, which is supposed to be the core of the FTL 
system, is very ornamented like an old Catholic Church.

All in all, I\'d say go see this movie.  There\'s a lot of scares and 
chills.  It\'s definitely worth seeing, and I\'d describe it as Aliens 
meets Hellraiser meets the Exorcist.

There were several times in the movie that I said, "Oh!!! This is 
getting good!", but it never would pay off.  Like I said, I felt the 
flim is a lot of build up with little climax.

I\'d rate it as a fair to good movie, and a 2 or 3 on a scale of 1-5.

******** No prior editing done ***********************
God knows I\'ve been a fanatical player of Traveller and a supporter of 
the new system, but responsibility IS required as well as ACTION.

As much as I deplore Jay\'s colorful language on this list, I can 
understand and in many ways agree with him.  Though I don\'t regularly 
contribute on the list, I read it daily, often deleting the subjects of 
little or no interest to me or my gaming friends.  As Jay so 
vociferously points out, there is much unnecessary tediousness to the 
systems, especially where Traveller Architecture & Design are concerned.  
Even though we as Traveller players are advocates of real science and 
hard/sci-fi, we are first and foremost PLAYERS!
I think the TML, with its core of dedicated systems specialists, have 
not always kept this in the forefront of their minds.
     In this first year, products have been full of inconsistencies, 
limitations, and errata.  For a system that is supposed to be adaptable 
to all settings, T4 arbitrarily limited the scope of technology and 
design to the M:0 setting.  This not only disappoints those who wish to 
strike it out on their own, a la the spirit of Classic Traveller before 
the reams of background data for the Third Imperium, but it disappoints 
those loyalists like myself who have been signed on since CT, MT, and 
TNE.  Some of us don\'t want to wait and adventure in the past history of 
the Imperium, at least not if a current history isn\'t supported.
    I don\'t know who is responsible for quality control of these 
products.  Though Marc remains the driving force of the system, he may 
be "too familiar" with the system, allowing jargon from Traveller 
incarnations of the past to slip through.  I don\'t know what the 
solution is, but certainly, it is NOT leaving the quality control and 
thus the future of T4 with members of the TML (for similar reasons).
   Though this may be shocking news to you, I think I can speak for a 
majority of the casual Traveller players and fans (though I am quite 
dedicated), as well as game store managers:

   Traveller, as it stands right now, is gravelly injured.

Get it in your minds, this is the reality out there.  Do you ever wonder 
why CCGs, Star Wars RPG, and GURPS do so well?  Think about it.
Traveller can only bank on its reputation for so long, and with the next 
generation of Sci-Fi RPGs coming soon (Aeon, Babylon 5, Alternity), we 
better repair T4 now or it will never rise again.

Then again, even if T4 went down, I\'m sure the list will survive to 
debate some picuyane point til Sol goes nova.

This reincarnation of the rules, T4.1, MUST be done right, just like the 
old GDW standards.  It must be LOGICAL (no 3D max damage rules that will 
end up having so many excpetions to the rule or so many different 
interpetations by referees), CLEAR (like close to errata free, hey if 
T$R could do it...), and well- presented (well-placed charts, no 
omissions, consistent terminology).

This is really your last chance with the non-TML gamers, if it isn\'t a 
harbinger of a new attitude towards consistent rules/quality product, 
your target audience (new gamers NOT the handful in TML) will go 
away.... and so will T4.

Perhaps we better start thinking about T5?

F.Y.I.
There was another 1000-ton merchie blown to vapors by the ImpNavy on
022-1098. A Levianthan-class was destroyed off Zaibon in the Lunion
subsector by a Kokirrak-class dreadnought (ouch!) due to a 
"communications failure". Only 15 crew (out of 56, not counting
passengers)
survived.

I\'d like to see the skill Mountaineering as an addition to the overall
skill
list. This would allow the use of technical climbing equipment and
techniques
(i.e. rappeling, ice climbing, etc.), the ability to select the least
strenuous/dangerous route up a mountain, and the ability to recognize
potential
conditions (avalanche, strong winds).

This skill was first introduced in the Gamelords supplement "The
Mountain
Environment" so I don\'t know if there would be any copyright issues.

I\'d assumed that over the millenia the Solomani race had blended its cultures
into a more homogeneous one, partly due to the development of a world-wide
community and partly due to the breakup/creation effects of the Long Night on
static cultures (effects like language drift, etc.). However, in terms of
ethnic physical appearance, the Vilani are supposed to be dark skinned
(see Cogs and Dogs) as are the Answerin.

Keep in mind that the Vilani don\'t speak "Eurocentric" english or any other
Solomani language. Indeed, I envision the Regency of the 1200s had already
begun blending cultural aspects of the Vilani, Aslan, Vargr, _and_ Zhodani.

Now if you\'re talking about an M0 campaign, the same would apply. The Long
Night would have been the beginning of the breakdown of the 
_Solomani-centric_ cultures you\'ve described on any colony worlds with the
word "breakdown" representing movement away from the statistical norm. This
would include both a loss of culture _and_, in some cases, an almost
fanatic adherence to some cultural aspects.

I\'d had heard that the MIR\'s life cycle was supposed to be 5 years and
it\'s now been, what, 11 years? If this is true, no wonder it\'s having

Great idea but not everyone has access to a computer, let alone one
with a decent printer. Nice to see Pentium 120s with a 1.6 Gig
harddrive, 16x CD, and monitor going for $999 locally, though. Can\'t
wait for a Pentium 200 laptop to drop to $1200. Then I won\'t even
have to print it!

I calculated the energy density:

	capacitor:	100Farads @ 2.5V

	Energy:
	Ecap = (C * V^2) / 2

	Ecap = (100F * 2.5^2) / 2 = 312.5J = .0003125MJ

	Volume:

	Vcap = (3.1415926 * 0.75cm^2 * 3.5cm) = 6.18cm^3 = .00000618m^3

	Now to find the energy density (m^3/MJ):

	Edensity = Vcap / Ecap = .00000618m^3 / .0003125MJ = 0.01979m^3/MJ

A TL18 accumulator has an energy density of .02m^3/MJ, so that\'s what 
SDI research was for!  Daniel Graham Sr\'s SDI program has jumped us from
TL8 to TL18 in only 10-15 years!  Gee, let\'s see, that\'s (300yrs/TL at 
ten TL\'s) 3000 years worth of advancement!!

Hmm, this company is also planning on releasing the 5volt version shortly
as well, in the same size package.  That\'s an energy density of 
0.005m^3/MJ, TL21!  Cool, maybe they weren\'t just pumping propaganda down
our throats about space technologies benefiting the commercial sector.

As do we all.  Most of the E21 thread has no interest to me, so I don\'t
follow it.  I believe that we all do much the same.

Really?  Other than the discussions of the development of T4.1 (which
started when Marc asked us our opinions to avoid a repeat of last year.)
there haven\'t been overly many gearhead discussions on the TML.  We have
our own two lists (GDW-Beta and ISBA) to really hash things out in detail.
  
>Even though we as Traveller players are advocates of real science and

Which I cannot do while I am reading email.  I don\'t come to the TML for a
Traveller game, I ame originally to contact other Travelelr enthusiasts,
and now for contact with friends and an ever expanding wealth of
information for my campaign.

>I think the TML, with its core of dedicated systems specialists, have

Hmm.. and what should we be discussing?  By your own words, you are not a
reguluar contributor, whereas I am one of the top five.  Tell me what you
would like to see on the TML.  We\'ve had people post campaign logs (not my
cup of tea, most of the time,)  discussions/flames over background
material, notices of net.resources, product reviews, personal
announcements, alternate game mechanics, hard science topics, and a
plethora of other topics.  The only time the gearheads really take center
stage is the THUDDD voting.

This seems to me to be a good balance.

I\'m working on a T4.1 campaign set in the Classic Era.  Milieu:0 was just
the first setting published.  FFS2 works out to TL 21 if you are so
inclined, EA includes TL 16 weapons...  The artificial "M:0 only" view of
T4 is a false one, as any number of people can attest.  I know of one group
that is playing in the first century of the Long Night, trying to keep
their world alive.

So don\'t.  If you wish to adventure in the classic era, there are enough
resources avalible *right now* to make that possible.  Galactic 2.3 has
reams of data for the Classic/TNE Referee.  Most of the DGP sectors are
avalible.  If you are an old timer, you probably still have a number of the
old products, use them!

Or strike out on your own.  The aforementioned Galactic will design entire
sectors for you in a few minutes, you provide the details.  Make use of the
Jungleblut Subsector from the Sky Raiders Triology, or do something
completely original.

Consider that the best recieved products for T4 thus far have been written
by TMLers (PE, PI, FFS2, M:0) and you might want to reconsider that statement.

The fact is that we know Traveller, play it, love it.  I have found the
chance to contribute to the T4.1 project to be very fulfilling, and having
my adventure published by JTAS one of the better things I\'ve had happen
recently.  The simple truth is that we are the ones who have volunteered to
roll up our sleeves and get dirty.  Dislike the direction Traveller is
taking?  Write something for JTAS or Traveller Chronicle or Freelance
Traveller or any of the other pro- and fanzines out there.

For some reason, I always doubt anyone who tells me that he can speak for a
majority of anybody.  Nothing personal, but somehow I doubt it.  Of course,
I don\'t claim to be able to speak for anybody but myself either.

I\'m on very good terms with my local game store folks, and they assure mwe
that Traveller seels well.  Comparing with CCGs, Star Wars and GURPs is
really fair, since they are (in order) a different type of game, one of the
most recognized names on the planet, and a generic system.

Compare Traveller to Star Frontiers, Buck Rodgers XXCv, Space Opera, Fading
Suns, or any other SF-RPG.  That\'s more of a comparison.

Having seen the B5 RPG, I can safely say that Traveller isn\'t really
threatened.  Aeon is sinking fast, and Alternity has been panned by the
playtesters I\'ve spoken with.

Sol won\'t go nova, not enough mass, and.. whoops, sorry, bit of gearheadism.

Which is the whole point of the mechanics discussions.  If I may, consider
your computer\'s OS.  The important thing to you is that it runs smoothly.
to the programmers, that meant endless hashing out the little details of
how to make it work properly.  Welcome to a list full of Traveller
Engineers.  Right now, we are helping Marc do exactly what you ask for by
going over T4.1 piece by piece, and carefully disecting ever move.  It\'s
helping.  The same thing with all the gearhead/planetology discussions; the
end result is to produce products that are well written and enjoyable.

I will admit to chuckling over the "old GDW standards" comment.  I owned a
copy of the fiirst printing of Mega Errata.

If IG rolls out T4.1 with the appropriate amount of fanfare, and gets their
act in gear vis-a-vis letting writers have more than a week to proof their
stuff, T4 will survive nicely.

I just saw it last night. It was ok and I rate it that low for several
reasons:


1) It was supposed to be a horror flick, but other than the abrupt loud
noises, it failed in that regard.

2) As a space type flick it presented great ideas as far as tech went, but
it failed to deliver more than just the "sentient ship" bit and the
gravity drive itself.


I think they could have done way more with the film. I would have rated it
a 2... but that is only my opinion =)

   There is a OLD game by GDW called "EnGuard !" that was role-
playing in 14th century france. < Three Musketteers, etc... >
This had a fairly nice dueling format for sword use,  accounting
for different weapon types < two-handed vs. rapier > and
tactics < lunge vs. slash vs. run-away vs. charge >.
   It also has some nifty rules on social standing and social
climbing. < This was the age of \'brown noseing\' with an artistic

a given social level.   Some, (most ??), of these actions could
lead to duels.  Also, these actions cost money, which tended to
keep the players always short of cash.
   If something like this was incorperated in to traveller, it
would encourage the \'space monopoly type\' to get out there and
mix it up with the locals.

If skill levels are supposed to represent roughly 1 year of experience in a
skill, then I would think a graduate student in chemistry would have
considerably more than a skill of 2. Sure, a grad student who spent time
studying Research, Carousing, or Instruction instead of his or her major
may have low skill levels, but I think a typical grad student would have a
skill level of 4 or 5 in his or her major.

Couldn\'t grav-plates use gravitic dipoles? IIRC, dipole effects drop off as
an inverse-cube,
so an inertial compensator that uses a gravitic dipole could be strong
enough to hold characters and cargo to the deckplates of a G-maneuvering
ship without affecting the ship superstructure or objects outside the ship
significantly.

"Instruction" skill.

My suggestion is to require Instruction skill to allow untrained characters
to perform a task with another\'s skill level (as mentioned in the T4
Instruction skill rules) and to teach characters a skill at level 1. Once a
character has reached level 1, he or she can increase the skill level
through instruction or experience, but a character cannot learn a skill at
level 1 without a teacher using Instruction skill. Alternatively, we may
give books or training materials an Instruction skill level for purposes of
initial skill training. The task roll to learn a skill should be against
the instructor\'s Instruction skill and the student\'s controlling
characteristic. Each student rolls separately, and if successful gets level
1 in the taught skill. There should be limitations on the number of
students which can be successfully taught at the same time.

I don\'t think this is very playable, or even accurate. In my campaign how
competent characters look depends on their role-playing, not on a skill
roll. If I was to use a skill roll for how competent a man looks "in the
eyes of his superiors" I would use Carousing and Social Standing, not
Administration. In my mind, Administration is the skill of actually knowing
rules & regs, and in completing paperwork quickly and correctly. Anyone who
has worked in an office knows this has little to do with how much respect
you get from superiors.

The cohesive group (all with Soc more or less in the same ballpark)

On the other hand, there is no requirement that the largest group dominate.
Maybe Prince Charles is the host, has high Carousing (is the only one

anyone takes issue with these proposals, open debate

In part, I think IG needs to commit to good, eye-catching art, 
especially on the covers, to sell the game.  IMO, the game system 
should be definitive and statistically sound.  

It should be a clear task based system that is easy to learn and 
remember.  It should have a character generation system capable of 
generating very detailed characters (as with Mercenary and High Guard)
if you are willing to go to the trouble or adequate characters if 
you aren\'t so willing.

IMO, It should be firmly based in statistics (but this doesn\'t 
have to show). You can still keep the trappings of a pseudoHexidecimal 
system, but these should indicate standard deviations from the 
societal norm.

Here\'s how...

If the average (statistical mean) is 8 then +/-8 give a range of 0 
to G. Thus, by using the standard 2D6 method and adding one, you 
get a range of 3-13 statistically centered on the mean.  How does 
this reflect reality? Well, for example, the highest IQ on 
record, 220 (Guinness book of wolrd records, Marilyn Vos Savant) 
equates to (220-100)/15 = +8 (i.e +8 standard deviations from 
norm = 16 = G!  In other words, this system fits reality but 
the mechanics don\'t have to be accessible to anyone but the 
designers (i.e. "us").  It also effects minimal change 
on the system, yet allows enormous amounts of measurement of 
abilities.  Suddenly, you can really measure your stats if you 
care to using various physical test batteries lie the AAPHERD 
(it\'s a physical fitness education skill test battery).  Just 
figure out your SD and you\'re done.

But all the players would see is "roll 2D6 and add 1" to obtain your 
stat. (i.e. nothing changes but the potential for a detailed detailed 
task resolution system arises).  Then you provide tables that really 
equate to what abilities that stat provides, like in AD&D.  Except 
these tables are REAL.

Deriving simple, FUN, rules from complex gearhead technical backrounds
can make T4+ the DEFINITIVE RPG, the premiere SF game. But we should
consider what makes game mechanics FUN?  Except for gearheads, 
equations do not.  I once read a quote that a single equation in book
will a readership by some enormouys amount (like a factor of TEN). 

So use appendices, use hypetext (in electronic versions).

Well, apparently lots of people like collecting cards.  Some people 
just like collecting "stuff."

In Star Wars and Shadowrun we discover that rolling lots of dice and 
getting sixes is fun.  In AD&D one finds that a "natural 20" is sort 
of like an aphrodesiac.  In Rolemaster its the "open ended" rolls 
that kill dragons.  The extremes are FUN and the source of high 
adventure.  Critical successes and failures make games exciting.  

For me, well, I LOVE detailed character data, career points, 
decorations, commands....  But that\'s just me.

My brother like the images, the artwork.  He really loves Blair 
Reynolds\' stuff.  In fact, he\'s a DGP fanatic because their stuff
had great ideas and scenes.

But tying Traveller to one background is a mistake.  The rules should 
be generic, generic but exciting and technically accurate, as 
well as capable of providing any level of detail desired.

Those six (eight) little books were magical.  I remember leafing
through Mercenary and High Guard back in the early 80\'s.  Striker
was the best thing that ever happened to me.  I became a true 
gearhead the day I read it.

I think IG should keep the design system to those who want to use 
it (like some of us). Don\'t waste resources publishing a work that 
nobody but those on the TML will want.  Provide the detailed tables
and along with accurate and detailed equipment desriptions in the 
generic game.

Then give the players nicely formatted, inclusive, and accurate 
CT/High Guard/MT type tables specific to the Imperium in an 
Imperial sourcebook.  Include easy to find instructions so those 
who desire can download the basic design sequences/spreadsheets 
and transform themselves into gearheads if they so desire.

Beyond  the MT data and the CT Alien module and Twilight\'s Peak (these two
long out of print) there isn\'t a lot.. The MT library data is quite
extensive though..

Both Leroy and Harold are probably going to tell you that they know what

to avoid the Templars killing them;-)

	sorry Marc, if this dosnt match T4.1 revision scedule, tell
	me if you like it, or why you dislike it.

	Request for Comment : Anagathics
	----

	Anagathics are medical and genetical methods to increase lifespan.

	Status of this Memo : Experimental
	----

	No proposed solutions of this document are intended as
	canon for the Traveller Comunity.  Rather, it is hoped that a
	general consensus will emerge as to the appropriate solution
	to such problems, leading eventually to the adoption of
	canon.

	Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

	Introduction :
	----

	I know that this is a broad mixture of diffent kind of canon.

	Adapting it to T4 (perhaps aging checks should be better made
	once per term and not any five years) destroys T4 space opera
	fealing of anagathics makes rich Vilani people live forever
	(T4/Vol1/PP70&78). IMHO anagathics should have side effects,
	or everybody would use them.


	While TNE anagathics were TL15+ and difficult to find even
	in the Regency. I asume that MT anagathics where of the same
	type (even if the rules are quite differnt). But T4/M0 also
	have anagathics for the same difficulty to find (12+) and with
	much higher results, even if produced backwater TL11. Normaly
	there should be no anagathics available in Sylea so I started
	a bit hand waving for fixing this situation as a player ask last
	session. They always deal anagathics, as it is the best
	freight for a yacht. Now as I\'ve read the T4 rules a
	second time, T4 anagathics seam to be broken as people
	using anagathic simply never age nor die. Here is my fix:

	Aging (T4 - private fix)
	----

	  age 35, save one of str,dex,end with 3+ on 2d6
	      40, save two of str,dex,end with 4+ on 2d6
	      45, [ ... ]
	      50, save 3 of str,dex,end with 5+ on 2d6
	      55, [ ... ]
	      60, save 3 of str,dex,end with 6+ on 2d6
	          save int&edu with 3+ on 2d6
	      65, [ ... ]
	      70, save 3 of str,dex,end with 7+ on 2d6
	          save int&edu with 4+ on 2d6
	  and so on 

	  when character has SOC 9+:
	   	DM+1 if TL11-, DM+2 if Tl12+, DM+3 if TL15+
	  when character has SOC 8-:
	     	DM+1 if TL12+, DM+2 if Tl15+

	Different types of Anagathics :
	----

	- A11V Anagathics Vilani
	  The character automaticaly succeeds one aging roll.
	  Anagathic side effects start at 75 but rolls of 11-
	  are ignored, there is also a chance of sudden death
	  when entering jump space of (real age/100), and any
	  time in jumpspace roll on anagathic side effects
	  ignoring rolls of 11-.
	  First therapy at 40, medical check is once per term.
	- A12S Anagathics Solomani also know as "Anagin Forte"
	- A12S Anagathics Sylean also know as "Viratuk Injection"
	  The character automaticaly succeeds one aging roll.
	  Anagathic side effects are starting at age of 60.
	  First therapy at 40, medical check is once per year.
	- A13B Anagathics Beta also known as "Ghul\'s vampiric friend"
	  The character automaticaly succeeds two aging rolls.
	  Anagathic side effects start at 80 but rolls of 11-
	  are ignored, there is also a chance of sudden death
	  when entering jump space of (years of using anagathics/100),
	  and any time in jumpspace roll on anagathic side
	  effects and ignore rolls of 11-.
	  First therapy with 33, medical check is not necessary.
	- A14H Anagathics Herzenlust
	  no automaticaly succeed, no side effects before 85.
	  First therapy at 35. Medical check once per term. Only
	  a fumble can cause genetic or psychologic side effects.
	- A15I Imperial Anagathics
	  The character automaticaly succeeds two aging rolls.
	  Anagathic side effects are starting at age of 60.
	  First therapy with 40, Medical check is once per term.
	- A17MT Anagathics Metagenetic Therapy
	  The character automaticaly succeeds three aging rolls.
	  Anagathic side effects start at 80 but rolls of 11-
	  are ignored. Impossible medical test for appling A17MT.
	  Skin will change to cameleon blue colors when the therapy
	  is successfull, otherwise a side effect take place imideate,
	  together with 1d6 aging rolls! Therapy will last half a year.
	  Further medical checks are not necessary, nor any subsequent
	  therapy or injection. TL17MAT is not a drug, but a genetic
	  therapy.

	Usage of Anagathics :
	----

	On a roll 12+ on 2d6 (using standart modifiers) a doctor able of
	handling anagathics (or a pusher for A13B), is available. When
	first adapting anagathics roll on the side effects table, a
	formidable medical check is posible to avoid side effects. Any
	furher time a medical check is necessary, roll an difficult
	test, to avoid side effects. Once the official side effects
	starts, medical help can only lessen, or repair by surgery
	afterwards those side effects, but never avoid. Whenever a
	fumble rolled by the medical roll 1d6 times on side effects
	table.

	When using Anagathics a character dos not increase visual
	age, nor dos he step further in the aging table. But the
	clock is still ticking. And he has still to make savings
	throws any 5 years to prevent aging based on their visual age.
	At 60 to 85 any kind of anagathics stoped working probately,
	as the live will decreased together with inteligence.
	Side effects normaly occuring by a medical failures become
	more likely so its wise not to abuse anagathics, but to stop.

	When a character stops using anagathics, a formidable medical
	check is necessary or aging must be rolled twice next time.

	Genetic and Psycholoical side effects caused by anagathic abuse
	----

	roll 2d6+TermsOfAnagathicsUse+LastTimeMod-MedicalSkillLevel :

	4-	no effect

	History of Anagathics ( totaly uncanon ! ;-)
	----

	Perhaps one of the main drawbacks the Vilani had was that while
	anagathics were strictly forbidden they were sectetly at common
	use by Vilani nobles. A lot of them feared jump space so much
	that they prefered to wait for the Solomanis to arive, instead
	of obeing their fleet commands orders to group in bigger fleets.

	Like a lot of other technics the solomani improved anagathics
	(using their +2 bonus for medical/genetics) after the first war,
	but deceidet to make anagathics classified and restricted for
	special operation like Jan de Lubbe, C-Jammer, and others, as
	terra had a population code of B, during 1th to 3rd war.
	Later in the RoM the Vilani expirience and known side effects
	prevented that Anagin Forte sold well.

	In the Long Night Vilani nobles returned in abusing A11V
	anagathics, so staying on their backwater planets and waiting
	for the Sylean Confederation. Getting A12S was a bit
	to easy in the early 3I. Be unemployed, cought by the ESA,
	and decide to become a member of a medical field test.
	Some yeas later as A12S realy worked, prices where high
	and the need for steady medical help still prevented the
	use of A12S as a common drug for export.

	A13B-SuSAG was at widly use in the antebellum (3I : 200-600),
	but later forbidden as A13B had the same jump intolerance
	like A11V, and as A15I was available, consumers had to switch
	to the new drug by an Imperial decrete, and production had to
	become upgraded or closed.

	During the consolidation wars a new type of Anagathics
	showed up. Anagin-Herzenslust a island solomani improvement
	of standart Anagin, showing nearly no side effects when
	used with medical help. The drug was cheap and available
	during consolidation and firth frontier war, as the different
	island fractions financed their military budget with smugling
	A14H to Deneb and Gushemege. While it was not as potent
	as A15I it was medical low tech, so it became even
	comon practice for the middle class.

	Production of A14H stoped when the Regency declared the
	Islands as amber zones, and restricted high tech trade,
	as the production relied on imported technolgies.
	
	Beta showed up second time. Produced by the Gushemege Vampire
	for controling local TEDs. It found its way through the
	Anagathics Island highway to the Regency, forming the
	class of Anagathic Ghuls - former Imperial nobles, now
	Regency citicens without any future.

	As the Regency realised this mistake it was to late. Old
	production facilities were beyond repair, so the smuggle
	of Anagathics continued. In 1202 Herzenslust and Nebelwelt
	restarted A14H production. RQS is forcing quantaine as last
	inspection showed that the automatated fabrication facilities
	are definitivly not from the Regency. As the controls proved
	free from any known virus form, the risk of a war was to high
	for a crew of the RQS-DPC-23DF0020.

Without some as yet unidentified event prompting such action. 

Suggestion:

With all the recent hoopla about asteriod collisions with Earth, how about
postulating one occurs or very very nearly occurs, such as a skip thru the
upper atmosphere within the next 12 years. No one in 1930 would ever have
suspected that the United States and Communist Russia would be military
allies 12 years later, in 1942. The out of left field event of Nazi Germany
changed the rules within a few years.

A high-complexity developer\'s tool without a system to use it. This is

God damn it, you seem to think that I\'m just whining about the
complexity level -- as though I had a nice safe user-friendly
alternative. The FACT is that if I want to design a fighter craft
(nothing esoteric, like battle armor or blimps or even combat choppers),
or a dreadnaught, or anything over 5000 tons and not of TL10-12 that I
am pretty much WITHOUT options. 

Look... for all my Irish temperament, I\'m actually a pretty easy guy to
satisfy. Just please in the name of God tell me how to build a cute
widdle space fighter for T4 without a scientific calculator... then a
20,000 ton carrier to wrap around several squadrons of them... nothing
esoteric, like hot-air balloons or Bussard ramjets....

Oh. Ah. I see. It\'s all IG\'s fault for not keeping up with the authors,
who continue to charge innovatively ahead and design ever-more complex,
evermore incompatible design systems for a game that cannot make use of
what they generate.

Oh, okay. I should just shut up and quit bitching and crawl back under
my rock and design pieces of hardware that I can only create with
somebody else\'s custom-written spreadsheets downloaded off the Internet
that generate statistics like G-hours and microseconds that I have no
way of converting to QSDS stats, unless by the grace of God the guy that
wrote the spreadsheet includes a little column at the bottom that does
it for me. And toss my $100 worth of books, which I might not even have
bothered buying, seeing that not one of them agrees with the other. 

In brief, I should simply have taken up checkers for a year and a half,
waited for FF&S2 to come out, then bum a spreadsheet for it off
somebody. Groovy. NOW you tell me.

Understatement of the year.... but it still doesn\'t explain the
incompatible-with-anything VDS. Nor the different language, stats, etc.
between SSDS and QSDS. Nor a new FF&S that is slightly off-kilter with
the old, which means that even if somebody had the out-of-print book to
make their own plugins that they will now have to revamp EVERY FRIGGING
THING THEY\'VE BUILT to conform to the new standard.

ANY BOOK FOR DESIGNING HARDWARE THAT HAS NO SYSTEM FOR USING IT IS A
WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY, and only a techno-game-geek locked into their
own private litle introverted universe could possibly fail to understand
(and hence be offended by) this. Nevermind the complexity level -- let\'s
just set the whole issue of real-world complexity for real-world users
off on the side for a minute. As is, FF&S2 is a $25 paperweight, because
YOU CANNOT F*CKING USE WHAT YOU F*CKING BUILD. Why is that hard for
people to grasp?

It would be -- not OK, but more palatable -- if there were alternatives.
What is common fare in any SF game? Space fighters? Space fighters are
cool. Robots? Hovertanks? Dreadnaughts? Powered battle armor? Okay;
let\'s keep it simple; let\'s stop right there.We can\'t let everybody have
everything they want. Let\'s confine ourselves to the basics.

Where are my stock dreadnaughts and space fighters and robots and
things? Can I, after 1 year and $120, even HAVE these staples in my
campaign unless I buy FF&S2 and whip them up myself out of whole cloth?
No. Do I have a rules set that tells me what happens when all the
warbots and hovertanks and star cruisers all start shooting at each
other? No. Can I design stuff using FF&S2 that will be compatible with
the (old-FF&S-based) QSDS and SSDS-constructed ships (assuming I\'ve
found and downloaded the un-broken version of QSDS off the Net), as well
as (virtually non-existant) stock ship & vehicle designs? No.

Perhaps it makes you happy to have your complex little design system
with which you can fine-tune ships and vehicles and ordnance that sit
there and look pretty and do nothing, but not me -- oh! I forgot! You\'ve
GOT the old TNE books! More importantly, you can UNDERSTAND them! You
can USE what you build! What about the rest of the planet? What about
people who haven\'t been playing Traveller since 1979? What about
somebody who\'s just getting into the game for the first time who is
getting good and mad because they have been given three design systems,
the first of which is erroneous and the latter two of which contain gobs
of material and statistics and whatnot that have no way of being used in
the game?

>The fact that SSDS and QSDS were
>built with FFS, and not FFS2 is another problem. 

Oh, REALLY? So we are going to have to revamp all our existing designs
YET AGAIN to conform with YET ANOTHER rules set, even if we were
faithful to the original FF&S? Of course, that actually shouldn\'t be too
much trouble for IG, since most if not all of the stock designs in
Starships were made up out of thin air anyway.... but what about all
those ships built using QSDS and SSDS in the intervening time (they are
mutually incompatible, remember -- not in theory, but in fact.) I guess
now we need QSDS 2 and SSDS 2, to conform to FF&S2!!!

Why would any normal person pay good money for this sort of whiplash
every few months?

Holy shit and tomato juice. You are seriously telling me that you come
out with the high-complexity design system FIRST, then the SIMPLE
version for all the kiddies, THEN the combat system to make use of what
you build and all the stock designs that should have been included in
the original release? (What good is an SF game without spaceships? or a
rules set so they can shoot at each other)?

It is this sort of raging obliviousness to the real world that the $120
I\'ve spent on T4 supplements is hostage to. It is also an excellent
example of how badly IG screwed up when they placed the writing and
editing of the game system in the hands of a select few gearheads on
this digest.... each of whom enforces their own biases in every book
they write.... farming game design and writing out to the fan-gurus must
have looked like such a shrewd and cost-saving measure two years ago;
kind of like putting the Mormons and the Ba\'hai and the Messianic Jews
together and telling them to write the definitive treatise on
monotheism. By commitee. For free. Like the outcome isn\'t as predictable
as a Klan rally in East L.A.

Even if the math were correct, which it isn\'t in the only published
version, QSDS doesn\'t agree with SSDS on a whole host of matters (how
are docking rings and external grapples different? why figure mass for
SSDS and not QSDS? do sandcasters need to be put in batteries or not?
with MFD\'s or not? what are microseconds? how do you control 5 missiles
with an MFD that only controls 3? and what dumb shit would design a
warship that couldn\'t control its own weapons anyway?). And we have an
alleged \'Vehicle Design System\' that is compatible with none of the
above, even using either of the two available flavors of FF&S; and that
even WHEN some magical, all-unifying combat system comes out, will be
incompatible with that, too. Apparently in T4 ground-based vehicles and
starships will not be allowed to shoot at each other. (Ever seen a 1,000
ton destroyer escort converted to gunship duty with a dozen railguns
linked directly to the main power plant? Ever seen a Mobile Orbital
Defense Platform consisting basically of a starship laser turret with a
hover-drive and a crew pod? Doubles as a great tank destroyer.)

Between stock starship designs that are simply made up and cannot be
built with anything, and the above design issues, and the fact that the
NEW master design system is apparently a little-bit incompatible with
the old out-of-print semi-comprehensible one... I don\'t know whether to
laugh or cry. I simply cannot believe that people are happily defending
this. I feel like I\'m trying to describe color to a blind man. The more
I point out that things are non-functional, the more people insist that
it is (1) actually okay and will all be resolved in the next book, or
(2) IG\'s fault. 

Oh well. Maybe somebody will take pity on this poor sinner and design an
Excel spreadsheet to design capital fire-&-forget missiles, along with
stats for the launcher and a column for conversion to QSDS stats... a
VLS that shoots Sidewinders the size of a telephone pole.... and then a
nice 20-ton fighter that can carry a pair on external racks...

Until then, I STILL quit. This broken, self-contradicting, Swiss-cheese
excuse for an overpriced puke-ola game system will claim not one jot
more of my time or money. This whole f*ckaround has reached such heights
of baroque unreality that it defies description. Not only is the Emperor
naked, but he\'s dead -- and instead of trying to revive the sonofabitch,
or anoint a worthy successor (T5?), the game-nerds are dutifully
genuflecting to the decomposing corpse.

Who says we haven\'t been? Perhaps as fast as we have been able to figure it
out, we have been applying the technology. 30+ years to get from Goddard\'s
unmanned, barely guided bottle rockets to the V2; 10 years from v2 to shinny
metal ball whipping about the earth (sputnik), and then 10 years later,
multiple manned trips approximately a quarter million miles each way.  

When Roswell occured, \'computers\' were differential gears, with a few in the
vaccum tube stage, and lots of commerical stuff of hardwired peg boards. 50
years later, nearly every toaster as the computational power of most 140s
computers.

The Cold War mentality did not vanish with the Berlin Wall; we just have a
larger opponent that the USSR.

Exactly the image I am trying to create with my vision of Jump Effect. That
is why the ports are covered during Jump: there is no effective outside, and
if you try to look out, you end up looking back in at yourself instead. Very
disconcerting.

Um, hate to correct you, but it took 56 days for the Lewis & Clark to get
to Neptune from Earth orbit, not 72 hours.  I saw the movie myself about
four hours ago.

Good point; I hadn\'t thought to look at High Guard. I know that the Imperium
board game does not include tonnages on the ships in it; only a Resouce
Units cost for building & supporting (shades of PE!).

Calling it Martial Arts is misleading. It implies Kung Fo or Judo. (I always

Calling it Unarmed Combat infringes on Brawling.

Yes.  It could even  be even more complex than this.  From the Luna article
in Dragon (by M. Miller), we know that gravitic systems are based on chip 
type devices.  Using large arrays of these things, one could conceivable  
develop very complex interference effects, quadrapoles, etc...shaping 
just about what ever field configuration you want.

Analagous present day systems include phased array radars, which are 
pretty nifty in their own right.

This question applies to Armorer, Mechanic, Gravitics, Electronics, etc. So
Fred ((from a LoTech world and with Armorer-3) isn\'t living in a vacuum...

Technology, Training, and Ability
	Individuals come from a variety of technological backgrounds in the
Traveller universe. The abilities conferred by skills are relatively tech
level independent. That is to say, a MidTech individual with appropriate
skill is skilled in the repair and maintenance of specific devices. While he
might not be able to invent new devices at HiTech or VHiTech, he probably can
puzzle out their maintenance and repair, especially if the appropriate
manuals or technical supplies are available.
	For example, Fred has Ground Craft-4. Since he comes from a LoTech world,
much of his experience is with LoTech Ground Vehicles. Later in his life, he
gets a job fixing cars and when he does, he has access to diagnostic
equipment, repair manuals, tools, and parts. Perhaps another mechanic would
fix a car by repairing the axle spindle, but Fred just replaces the whole
assembly. He has skill in achieving the end, but the way he gets there is
shaped by his background.

	Armorer (Soldier)	Dex, Int
	Armorer skill is an expertise in the care of and repair of weaponry. The
individual can operate, maintain, and repair military and civilian weapons.
This expertise extends to small arms (hand weapons), heavy weapons,
artillery, and ship=92s weapons. Weapons are made to be maintained and
repaired; an armorer=92s experience and background includes a working knowledge
of currently available weapons, a historical knowledge of other weapons, and
an ability to find references which help in handling otherwise unknown
weapons.
	Identification. An Armorer can identify weapons after an examination of 
the weapon itself or of images of it.

	To identify an unknown weapon.
	(Int + Armorer) < Difficult (2.5D)
	Difficulty of this task will vary by specific weapon and whether images or
the weapon itself is available.

	Maintenance. An Armorer is responsible for preventative maintenance of
weaponry, carefully disassembling the equipment, cleaning it, replacing worn
parts, and then reassembling it.

	To perform preventative maintenance on a weapon.
	(Dex + Armorer) < Average (2D)
	Uncertain (1D). This task assumes proper tools and manuals are available.

	Repair. An Armorer is responsible for repair of weaponry in a unit or
organization, or on a ship.

	To repair a weapon which has malfunctioned.
	(Int + Armorer) < Difficult (2.5D)
	Uncertain (1D). This task assumes proper tools and manuals are available.

	Depending on the circumstances, this task may have other levels of
difficulty or uncertainty.
	Armorer is one of five members of the Soldier skill cluster (the others =
are Ground Craft, Camouflage, Demolitions, Heavy Weapons, Tactics).

Well...we\'ll probably take it for this...but I\'d have to agree with
you.  I find some of that artwork pretty darn annoying.  I like some of
it....mostly the one\'s you\'ve mentioned (CSC and PsiInst--I really liked
the PsiInst picture in the last JTAS Contact: The Suerrat article, when
it was "expanded" and "hazed up" a bit!)  But what is that THING coming
out of the nose of the ship on Anomalies....or those "claws" on EA.

I would like to see (I in no way pretend to represent anyone other than
myself) more of the Larry Elmore B&W artwork as seen inside the T4
rulebook.  I may take some hits for this, but I just don\'t think I\'ve
taken enough recreational drugs to fully appreciate the Chris Foss
stuff.

All this to say....."me too, Dan!"

Jeff, I\'m with you on this one!  I *use* alternative technology in my
games...a LOT of alternative technology. ;->  

I don\'t think TML is the place to develop Stutterwarps and Stutterjumps,
Psionic Drives, Hyper Drives, Dean Drives, Ether Propellers, Exotic Matter
Drives, Casimir Powercells, M/AM power plants, CNO fusion, Blasters, Neural
Whips, Grav Scanners (I don\'t think they are in FFS2 are they?), and all
manner of other SF technology. Can you imagine the noise to signal ration?
;->  

I *hope* GDW-Beta becomes a *hotbed* of alternative technology development
during the next few months...how about it Guy?  If not there, maybe MPGN
would create another list for us here.  I *would* have suggested ISBA, as
an alternative site, but they are more focused on using what we already
have rather than developing new technology.

Let me expand of the role of the Steward:

True, the primary duty of the Steward is to attend to passenger and crew
comforts, services and safety. Stewarts are responsible for daily
housekeeping services and stocking the ship with necessary commissary
items, janitorial supplies, bed and bath linens, water, oxygen, medical
supplies, drugs, foods, beverages and other consumables. They often play
the part of waiter, bartender, clerk, valet, trainer, barber/hair
stylist, announcer/DJ, entertainer, activities director, florist,
masseur, casino dealer, dry cleaner, pet groomer, tailor, nanny,
counselor, nurse and cook (This is where the JOT skill would be quite
real). Many Stewards are also travel agents, tour guides and cruise
directors, conducting passenger tours of the ship, as well as
facilitating planetside and starport excursions (usually for fees). They
also schedule entertainment activities and onboard music/holomovies/VR
games, and update the entertainment software selection and electronic
news data-packets periodically. Their computer skills allow them to
program VR entertainment and create multimedia and holographic
presentations. They may also perform public relations, customer service
and entertainment computer help desk functions to passengers and crew
members. Many times they perform some journal-keeping and bookkeeping
roles. They deal with starport and custom officials and sometimes have
to run interference for passengers in trouble with the local law or
powers to be. And as you commented they also are critical in recruiting
passengers.

Stewards instruct passengers on shipboard safety procedures and run
lifeboat drills. They also insure that all safety-related shipboard
equipment and lifeboats are in proper working order and perform periodic
preventive maintenance (PM). In emergencies, the Stewards role is to
insure the safe evacuation of passengers to lifeboats, then perform
damage control and fire fighting duties. Damage Control (personally, I
think this should be a separate skill) can involve dealing with loose
high-voltage lines, dangerous cargo and fuel leaks, oxygen line fires,
solar radiation exposure, explosive decompression, vacuum conditions,
sharp floating debris and exploding ships ordnance, to mention a few
fun things. On some ships Damage Control Suits (similar to a lightly
armored vac-suit) are standard issue to damage control team personnel.
Stewards also perform hazardous materials (HazMat) containment and
decontamination duties as well. Obviously, a variety of different skills
could come to bear in damage control work.

Stewards also handle crew and passenger compartment maintenance and PM
duties including regulating and monitoring life support/environmental
(HVAC) systems, ships plumbing/waste disposal systems, damage
control/fire-fighting and safety-related systems, entertainment and
passenger compartment communications sub-systems and maintaining the
ships galley, laundry room, gym/health spa, entertainment suite,
casino, ships commissary, and, if also the medic, the sickbay.

As a cook (SL-0 to 2) or chef (SL-3+) (again, I would like to see this a
skill unto itself) the Steward is knowledgeable in preparing a variety
of foods for different cultures, religions and races as well as
selecting wines, liqueurs, spirits and non-alcoholic beverages. They are
responsible for stocking the galley with standard and specialty foods
and beverages and insuring their proper handling and storage. The higher
the Stewards\' skill level the more variety of high quality meats,
seafood (sometimes live) and poultry available onboard. To this end,
most Stewards of SL-3+ generally get free rein as to what they want to
spend for their passengers\' comforts. They also monitor and resupply the
drinking- and waste-water supply and insure its purity.

Many Stewards find themselves as the ships medic also. This many times
includes supporting the low passage berths as well as running the
pharmacy and medical lab.

On occasions, Stewards perform some limited security functions such as
conducting searches of passengers, luggage or cargo for weapons,
contraband or dangerous products, securing passenger valuables (in the
ships safe or secured cargo hold) or providing executive security to an
onboard VIP. In the rare event (depending of the GM) the ship is under
attack by pirates or worst, the Steward may be called upon to help repel
boarders or even man the turrets. Thus weapons and gunnery skills are
critical import.

Another equally important function Stewards perform are the duties of
CargoMaster (CM)(or LoadMaster to you Air Force types)(Yes, I think this
should be a separate skill!). Using Hydraulic ExoFrames (HEFs),
AntiGravLifts (AGLs) or other cargo-handling equipment to 
on-load/off-load cargoes the CM understands how to obtain the most
effective utilization of the ships cargo hold to maximize the amount of
cargo carried. Many cargoes, such as those packaged using custom-fitted
cargo bladders or containers will provide near maximum cargo hold
utilization (up to 99%) without even requiring CM skills (especially
with bulk cargoes such as grains, ores or liquids), but the majority of
cargo-to-cargo hold situations are a problem of mathematics and
experience. Attempting to load a quantity of loose freight, mail or
odd-shaped cargo without having a CM skill would deliver a default
maximum cargo efficiency rating of 75% of capacity (at least thats the
way I use it). Each additional skill level of CM can increase the cargo
capability by 4% up to a maximum of 99%. No way to get 100% capacity
even with a SL-9!

CMs also have an understanding of how to handle dangerous (i.e.,
explosive, flammable, corrosive) and live (animals, plants,
microbiologicals, seeds) cargoes needing special handling and care. For
many standard, dangerous, fragile or live cargoes the CM skill level
would also determine the amount of cargo damaged (i.e., dead animals,
destroyed plants, crushed products, spilled liquids, broken viruses
vials, etc.) during on- and off-loading (maybe due to poor cargo hold
placement, lack of proper care or bad handling. This would be a serious
factor in profitability to any ship captain. 

Maybe you\'ll give the Steward more respect now!

Yes and no. The draft I\'m been looking at allows players to pick the table
for the roll, but you have to roll for the specific skill.  All careers
have one table with the 3 physical characteristics and another table with
the 2 mental characteristics.  This gives our hypothetical powergamer a
pretty good chance to boost a characteristic or two every term with the 4
or 5 rolls he gets each turn. OTOH, you don\'t have the pick/pick method as
a printed option that *really* allowed stat-boosting.

Personally, I\'d rather characteristic advances be made *very* expensive,
let the player advance a characteristic OR roll for the 4 skills he gets
during the term.  Then if you\'ve *just*got*to*have* that STR+1 then you can
get it, but it\'s gonna cost you!

Richard, this *is* something that the T4.1 draft handles a little better. 
The player can roll for a skill OR pick his declared major.  The grad
student with a declared major in chemistry could concievablly have a
Chem-2, but it would be his choice. He could also have a Chem-4 or 5.  Of
course, if he did he wouldn\'t have those Research, Carousing, Instruction,
Biology, or Admin skills he could have learned instead of Chemistry.

IMO, there should be *6* skills per term, plus promotion and maybe even a
"hobby" skill.  If Chem-1 represents a year of study, then that could
represent as much as 2000 hours of study/work...that\'s *too* much. 

What I\'m doing is making a skill-1 be 8 months of study/work (2 semesters)
at 0.75 effort (the other quarter goes into the character\'s "hobby).  This
works out to 6 skills over the 4 year period PLUS time for 2 "hobby"
skills.  From the test characters I\'ve done I like these better than the 4
or 5 skills per term in Marc\'s draft.  One problem is the characteristic
advances...I\'ve skirted that one by pulling them out of the tables, and
letting characteristics be picked at a cost of 4 skills.

Yes, 8 per term is a lot, but if they go into *more* skills rather than
much higher levels for the same number of skills, it works out very well.
Like Ken, I *want* skill levels to go up some..not to outlandish levels,
but up some.  I also want a broader selection of skills, instead of 9 or 10
skills, I\'d like to see characters with 14 or 15 skills. Actually *I* like
characters with around 20. ;->

I agree with Richard.  I see Admin as knowing the rules, regs and the
*shortcuts* to getting things done.  When Jo the Trader needs to get the
paperwork completed and approved by 4 different offices before he can
unload and transport his cargo to his buyer, he uses Admin.  When Hope the
Naval Officer needs to get the Yardmaster to move her ship\'s repair to the
top of the list and she does it by knowing the proper forms to fill out,
exactly how to fill out those forms, who should get those forms, and how to
get the forms to the top of that person\'s inbox, she uses Admin.

Admin doesn\'t make the character *look* competent in a bureaucracy...it
let\'s the character *BE* competent in working inside a bureaucracy.

BTW, I\'m not gonna push for it\'s inclusion, but Scrounging is an important
skill that isn\'t listed. It\'s not really Admin, nor Trade or Broker (the
way they are defined), but characters are *always* Scrounging around for
something or other.  ;->

   About the same time it takes the Enterprise of Star Trek to travel at
impluse to the same location.

   As for flying a fighter for long duration, the pilots of those F-111s
that bombed Libya back in the 80s flew for *much* longer than three
hours.  As I recall, so did a number of other American fighter pilots
when they deployed to the Gulf during operation Desert Shield/Storm.

   In fact there are so *many* pilots of single or dual seat fighters
that fly for more than three hours straight, I\'m surprised that you
would make such a statement.

   I won\'t make excuses for Trojan asteroids that turn up where they
aren\'t suppose to be (the number of basic astronomical violations Star
Trek and even Traveller have made over the years is enough to make
Galileo spin at 78 rpms in his grave).  However, since we have no idea
what the Chigs were thinking (maybe they were just being cautious or
preparing to send in scouts out ahead of the main body), I don\'t think
their cruising speed is a very valid point of criticism.

>Sorry, but the science in S:AAB *sucked*.

   I didn\'t say it couldn\'t have been better, just that it protrayed
things more realistically than a lot of other sci-fi.

Well, I guess you two weren\'t around for the "Art Wars" when T4 first came
out, huh?  ;->  Chris Foss\'s work was harshly reviewed by several people,
and it was either Ken Bearden or Joe Walsh that kept asking.."Is the
illustration on page ## you\'re idea of Traveller?"  

Personally, I like the B&W drawings inside T4.0, too. Is that Larry Elmore?
Yep it is (just looked).  I also liked Reynolds and which ever Keith used
to do drawings. The cover of MT\'s Imperial Encyclopedia sticks in my
mind...the guy hanging in the air by his Gravbelt while scanning across a
gorge, some kind of grav craft off in the distance and hanging
buildings...now *that* was TRAVELLER art!

OTOH, I liked the LBB\'s and they had NO art at all.

   The space station in _2001_ is several generations ahead of Mir.  Mir
is late 70s technology, somewhat more advanced than America\'s Skylab. 
It *is* operational, more than can be said of the American et al. "Space
Station Freedom" or whatever they are calling it now.

   2300 AD used a "realistic" star map, which took a three dimensional
image of space and turned it into a two dimensional one.  It was a
*pain* to use, and God help you if you wanted to go another star
system.  Truly realistic star maps will not become a reality until you
can convince a game company to produce space modelling software (and
make it a standard part of the game) that can be run on a laptop
computer (Pentium or Pentium II unless you mind cheesy graphics), *and*
the cost of laptop computers comes *way* down.

Just my opinion, but I think the strange thing "sticking out" of the
nose on the ship on Anomalies is supposed to be a destroyed monorail 
track the ship is sent to investigate. I read this in a book with Chris
Foss art I think. The painting then at least makes sence, to me that is.

But I dont need a design system that doesn\'t tell me if this gun is a good
gun, what the problems with it is and so on. For that I need a system to
use the gadets I have designed. If there is no system to compare the
gadets with I can just describe the gun with words using no design sytems
as I can\'t compare to guns anyway.

	I second that. Foss is a great artist, but some of his paintings 
used in T4 actually predate Traveller. They have absolutely nothing 
to do with the game. The look and feel of his technology goes 
way off the mark.

Yes, so what ?  This is _still_ Econ 101.  If the quantity supplied is
reduced and demand is not the price _will_ go up.  Economists have done
some work on the question of dowries and IIRC one conclusion is that the
brideprice is money paid to the groom to cover the net present value of
the money he will spend in the future to support her (minus his
perceived net present value of the support she will give him).

As an example suppose that the groom will spend $1,000 per year on the
bride but the services he receives from her are only worth $800 per year
to him.  He is loosing $200 per year by being married.  The brides
family will have to give him money to make up for this loss. He will
want the net present value to him (at his personal discount rate) of the
money he will pay out for the shorter of their lives.  If the number of
women out alive were to be reduced the value of the remainder would
rise.  If the value the groom placed on the brides services were to rise
by only 30% then her services would be worth $1,040 a year to him.  Thus
getting married would gain him money.  He would then be willing to pay
to achieve this gain.

When there are not as many women being born the value of each one will
go up.  The fact that many countries require a dowry rather than paying
a brideprice just means it will take longer there.

Dowries are more common then brideprices because there are more
countries where the groom perceives the bride as an economic drain than
the converse.  This has some cultural force and this would create
friction in the economic transaction that as the heart of the marriage
and therefore it is quite possible that brideprices would not replace
dowries as rapidly as they would in a world of perfect information.

To reduce this to its simplest level most human males desire intimate
aquaintance from human women.  Billions of years of evolution have made
this a very strong demand [If your parents did not have kids you
probably won\'t either.]  Therefore the demand for women is fairly
inelastic [and has few substitute goods] and therefore the price will go
up rapidly as quantity supplied goes down.  If there are fewer human
women grooms will have to pay more to get them.

Of course economics is really just the behavior of the selfish genes
that make up the body doing what is in their own best interests but
that  is another story.

hate higher (past calculus) math enough that grad school was no fun :)

Ah, "WHUFFO" isn\'t an acronym, IGTS[1], but merely the emphatic form of
"whuffo," i.e., "what for????" (how come?  WHY, LORD, WHY?) as pronounced
by me when I slink out of the office and take off the suit and tie.

And stoked by your misdirected praise and another drink, let me share a
couple other WHUFFO moments:

WHUFFO they think ringing eardrums are scary?  I don\'t get it... am I
normal?  Like, that IS why they put in all those loud pointless noises,
huh?

WHUFFO they\'re choking on their own bad breath and scrounging for CO2
scrubbers and they\'re air-conditioning O\'Hare airport?  These are
"rescuers?"

WHUFFO this so-called "search-and-rescue" team manages to break EVERY
=46REAKING RULE IN THE BOOK?  Did they break the Don\'t Shine Flashlights in
Satan\'s Face Rule?  YES!  Did they break the Arrive Fashionably Late Rule?
YES!  Did they break the Don\'t Try to Leave Rule?  YES!  Did they break the
Don\'t Heft Weapons and Brag Rule?  YES!  Did they break the Don\'t Move
Backwards Rule?  Did they break the Shoot Scientists on Sight Rule?  YES!
And on and on and on...   These numbnuts oughta have their freakin\'
licenses pulled, along with their viscera... where the hell\'d they train, a
guest spot on "ER"?

WHUFFO "the Government" didn\'t think to find out what the voice hidden in
the last transmission said, instead of getting lucky that some
potato-eatin\' paramedic remembers a bit of Latin (on the second try!) that
the good Fadders taught him, when it\'s already too late?  No FREAKIN WONDER
that "the Government" is to embarrassed to name itself.  THAT\'S the answer
to the Milieu:2100AD conundrum about national represention -- they\'re all
TOO DAMN LAME AND KNOW IT to use their own names.

WHUFFO there\'s frost on the goddamn windows?  The inside\'s supposed to be
heated; the outside\'s supposed to be outer space, righty-right?

WHUFFO they bother putting a screenwriter in the credits?  Haunting of Hill
House Maltese Falcon Blade Runner Hellraiser Prince of Darkness Alien
Aliens Bunches o\' Aliens Outland Friday the Thirteenth Nightmare on Elm
Street 2001 ha!

WHUFFO they get my hopes up about a "dimension of ultimate evil" for
something really scary and Chairman Bill doesn\'t come though the gateway to
inflict terrible, terrible hairdos on humanity?  I guess by 2057 AD they\'ve
figured out that the locus of cosmic ickiness is the Microsoft Corporate
Campus.

WHUFFO they got themselves a Ripley Clone, whuffo they get in innuendos
about who-all she\'d like to bunk down with, timid innuendos though they may
be, and so then WHUFFO she\'s gotta be this bit a spindly blonde do-nothing
fluff?  Sigourney\'s starting to look good.

This is an oversimplification.  Rather TNE was not able to sell enough
to prevent this.  GDW was not just Traveller, it was also a bunch of
wargames - and wargames do not sell either.

Maybe because they are easy to pick up and start play right away ?
[Except for GURPS but that is a whole other question.] 

I work for a distributor and for a game store. I order games for a
living.  (Trust me, I\'m a professional. :)  ).  I would love to order
more Traveller products but I can not.  I will not order what will not
sell.  Unless it gets better I cannot sell Traveller. Unless it gets
better I cannot recomend unqualifingly recommend Traveller.  _I_ will
buy Traveller and play Traveller until you know where freezes over - but
I don\'t know anyone else who will.

In his letter about the future of TSR Peter Adkinson (President of WOTC)
says that Alternity is being held back until a 1998 release so that WOTC
can promote the heck out of it because "the days when a game can sell
without promotion are over" (paraphrased).

I am not cognicent of the chances of there being a T5.

All cynicism aside I am impressed by what I have seen of T4.1 and would
like to commend Marc for what he has done.  It would have been nice to
have seen it a bit earlier.

This is the way I use Admin skill too. It\'s more akin to an
understanding of organizational behaviors and knowing the political
structure of the bureaucarcy in place and one ability to manipulate that
system to your advantage.

I hope that Marc reads this and considers putting it into the next

as strong as I would like it to be. Input anyone?


PROCUREMENT (or SUPPLY)

The average merc unit or starship has thousands or even tens of
thousands of systems, sub-systems, parts and expendable and
non-expendable supply items to keep track of and make purchase decisions
about. The universe if full of poor quality, counterfeit and flawed
items at every port of call awaiting the sucker in need. The Supply
Specialist (SS) keeps abreast of this massive supply maze. An SS using
their Procurement skill has a working knowledge of both Imperial and
non-imperial supply procedures and contracts and a network of personal
contacts (call the supply specialist club for a lack of better term-in
short networking).(Twenty years ago while in the Army I was assigned for
five months to a Quartermaster depot where bartering and part swopping
was the order of the day - ordering parts through the system was too
slow - these guys were master scroungers). By using this knowledge the
SS can obtain standard and non-standard needed items using published
computerized parts catalogues via the various military, governmental,
starport and corporate supply channels on most worlds. The higher the
Procurement skill level, the better one is at determining the
authenticity, quality level, availability and retail/street/discount
price of such items by examining and researching supply catalogues,
product evaluations and manufacture recall notices. Knowing the detail
here is the difference. The SS is also generally able to obtain a lower
price for almost anything through their special knowledge of
manufactures specials and rebates, personal bartering and special
incentives known only to supply insiders. 

This skill is also used to administer the unit/starship preventive
maintenance program. When a starship, vehicle or other item needs
scheduled maintenance or repairs the SS knows how to find a reputable
repair facility or mechanic, negotiate a fair price and monitor repair
progress. The SS also keep a complete inventory of all unit/ship
equipment with serial numbers for warranty and loss prevention. Some
bookkeeping and journal keeping is involved.

When a specific part or item is not available within regular supply
channels the SS resorts to using their sources within the gray or black
markets. By bartering and networking they can generally find the needed
item. The higher the skill level the faster and easier to find it, and
the less expensive it\'ll be. 

Of course this skill only applies at starports and worlds with a solid
economy supporting the tech level of the needed item. 


FINANCIAL

A character with this skill would have a knowledge of all aspects of
personal and business finance. They would have a understanding of
bookkeeping and accounting procedures and banking and investing
practices. This skill would improve ones chances of obtaining bank loans
or credit and facilitate the best interest rates, or having contacts
within the financial industry allowing one to find and acquire venture
or investment capital. It would assume a solid knowledge of different
types of financial instruments, the stock, bond and commodity markets
and general market economic conditions. Individuals with Financial skill
would also have a general understanding of insurance, real estate, tax
issues, trade tariffs, financial ethics, auditing, forecasting, estate
planning and governmental policies regarding financial markets. This
individual would also be able to recommend salary and wage packages,
employee benefit programs and handle payroll accounts for businesses.

Characters with this skill would know how to obtain credit reports,
banking records, land deeds, escrow accounts, probates/wills, trusts,
bankruptcy, insurance information and tax data. They would feel
conformable dealing with financial institutions such as banks, credit
unions, brokerage houses, insurance companies, tax offices, real estate
companies, credit bureaus and corporate financial departments.

Not precisely so. If it is a non-default skill, or one you already hold, then
the ONLY way to get that skill is through 

A. Education, or 
B. Instruction by someone who has the skill.

What you imply is that someone with Instruction would be a good teacher, and
that they could set up schools for PCs.

FYI protons do indeed tunnel -- it\'s one of the quantum effects that 
makes hydrogen funny stuff (to use a technical term) -- but since 
they\'re, what, 1822 times massier than electrons they\'re sqrt(1822) 
times less good at it, crudely speaking.

You can get quantum tunneling of whole spaceships really easily, if 
you happen to have an infinite improbability drive fitted ;-)

There aren\'t any gravitic dipoles. And they are less likely than
magnetic monopoles.

However, the field generated by a flat plate is rather interesting.
Except near the edges, it is constant (no inverse square drop off). Of
course, any finite sized plate will have fairly severe edge effects so
that at a great distance, it appears to be a point source, and thus
follow inverse square.

Also, given how *close* you are to the "plate", the required "mass" is
quite low (I don\'t have the formula for the field of a flat plate
handy, or I\'d give actual calculations). So the effects at a distance
are minimized.

For that matter, since we know that both attraction *and* repulsion are
possible with "grav tech", we can have 1/2 gee "pull" from the floor,
and another 1/2 gee "push" from the ceiling. Done properly, there isn\'t
any residual field outside the ship. It\'s also a lot safer, since if
one set of plates fails, you still have gravity!

Unfortunately, to use these as a power source, you have to be able to
use an output voltage noticeably lower than the max voltage of the
capacitor. And add circuitry to keep the discharge at the lower voltage
until the voltage in the cap drops below it.

For useful power units, you want this sort of capacitor, but with 100
or 1000 volt capability. Just pray that a bullet doesn\'t hit one of
them, as the energy release will be moderately explosive. :-)

We were told in no uncertain terms to *not* do alternate technologies
in FF&S2. In a way, its a good thing, as it gave us more time for what
did get in.

I think any such supplement will have to be non-IG.

I think if the UK reelects a Labour government in 2002 (probable date 
of next general election) then the UK will be sufficiently enmeshed 
in the EU by the time of the subsequent election (2007-ish) that it 
won\'t withdraw.  Denmark is notoriously unkeen on the EU but similar 
considerations may well apply.

For space travel, sure.  For EU membership, I don\'t think so.

Important addition: Chemistry implies an understanding of materials,
their properties and their uses.

In practice, this will mean that Chemistry can be used to answer 
questions from "What material is this?" to "How can we synthesise 
this acid-resistanct polymer?" and "Is this chemical potentially
valuable?"

Suggest rephrasing this to:

A person with Chemistry skill... [can discover] ... their general 
composition and novelty.  Unknown chemical compounds can be extremely 
valuable, as can new sources of known and patented pharmaceuticals.
The statement...

[end rephrase]

In all likelihood most molecules would be known to the science of a 
thriving Imperium, tho\' gaps in the record might -- only might -- 
have developed.  Information on the chemical reactivity and uses of 
these molecules may be much patchier.

High tech chemistry is concerned with *arrangements* of 
molecules -- how to combine atoms into useful and interesting 
materials.  Some drugs are much more effective in one crystalline 
form than another; some crystals might be harder than diamond (for 
instance, theroretical studies show that a carbon/nitrogen crystal 
might be harder, if it could be made); "molecular computers" could 
use a series of thin molecular films in their components.  All these 
are current examples.

Actually, I don\'t think that would be so easy to do.  Much easier to

Qualitative analysis implies discovering constituents but not 
proportions.  So fibreglass is shown to be a resin plus glass 
stiffening, for instance.

Note: it is much easier to analyse the chemical composition of a 
material than its structure, especially with modern lab equipment.  
This is particularly true in the case of something like modern 
semiconductor devices (transistors, chips etc.).

Note that at TL9+ analysis of chemical composition will be almost 
trivial and could be automated to a huge extent.

Substitute "can devise" for "can create" a process.  It may be that 
the process requires apparatus not available, such as the gravitic 
generators used to create superdense materials.

Many processes will be known, and "creating" them will be a Task 
using Research and Edu.

To devise and implement a novel process is a Task on Chemistry and 
Int.  I would recommend the design and implementation being separate 
tasks.

Similarly, while Chemistry relies upon physical principles it implies 
only a basic familiarity with Physics.  Individuals with Physics-4 
and Chemistry-4 are Chemical Physicists or Molecular Physicists.

Most qualitative analyses will require a field lab or better to run.

So a character rolls real dice and gets good rolls... so starts out with
AAA999. Just rolling on the physical and mental tables to move this to FFFFF9
(assuming all possible die rolls go right) makes the character 40 years old
with practically no skills.

Or rolls all evening long until he rolls CCCCCC, and then spends 15 years of
character generation to make the fellow FFFFFC. Or even FFFFFF assuming he
went Noble. And has virtually no skills (they all came as physical plusses).

>>I do not have the T4.1 chargen rules. Do they address this problem?<<

Yes they do. They tell how to roll dice and generate characters. The problem
of players generating an FFFFFF is addressed by the real world laws of
probability. For a player to generate a character who begins with AAAAAA or
better is less than 0.002% (maybe 1 in 3 billion). For the other 2 billion
tries players make, the characters are balanced.

    'body' => 'Hello all,

When I posted house rules re: starport \'size\', someone 
(perhaps jokingly) wondered about the actual tonnage
or acreage of a starport.  So I started wondering too,
and scribbled up a draft house rule... so without further
ado, here I go again.

1. Calculate Size Index
- ----
Starport size = floor (The number of populated worlds within 2 parsecs / 3) 
              + (Starport class: A=2, B=1, C=0, D=-1, E=-2) 
              + floor (Tech Level / 4) 
              + 2 if there is a Naval base
              + 1 if on an XBoat route

OR

              Value of starports on worlds within 2 parsecs
                (Starport class: Interdicted=0, Non-Imperial client=1, 
                     A=2, B=1.5, C=1, D=0.5, E=0.25, X=0)
              + 2 if naval base
              + 1 if on an XBoat route

2. Determine Starport Capabilities
- ----
Size	Orbital	Passenger	Freight		Fuel	Shuttles
Index	Ports	Facilities	Handling		
- ----
0	0	0		0		0	 0
1	0	10		0		1t	 0
2	0	20		10t		5t	 0
3	0	30		50t		25t	 0
4	1	88		250t		125t	 0
5	4	50		1250t	        625t	 2
6	16	192		6250t		3125t	 8
7	64	326		31,250t		15,625t  32
8	256	1104		156,250t	78,125t  128
9	1024	4186		781,250t	390,625t 512
A	4096	16484		3.9Mt		1.95Mt	 2048

Okay then, orbital ports determines base orbital tonnage.
Let\'s multiply the number of orbital ports x 100 to get
the tons displacement.  So 4000 ports = 400,000 tons.  Sound okay?


Surface hectarage = func(passenger, freight, fuel);
	= 1
	+ sqrt(fuel storage)
	+ sqrt(freight)
	+ passenger / 1000

How\'s that for starters?

How should world populations factor in?

In the Phillipines (or at least the part my ex-fiancee came from) the groom
paid for the wedding, as well as made gifts to the bride\'s father.  The
sociology texts I consulted (when I was balking at the cost) described this
as a way of showing that the groom could afford a wife.  Made sense when you
were providing a pig for the local villagers, but gets a bit more expensive
when they move to the city and _still_ want everyone invited!  Picture an
extravagent Italian wedding, where the bride\'s parents choose everything and
the groom pays :-(  

This attitude is _not_ universal in the Phillipines; it is common in rural
Luzon but virtually ignored in Manilla (which is very Westernized) except
among new arrivals from the country.

I found the TNS article, here\'s what it says:
Dentus/Regina (0601-C979500-A S) Date: 361-1105 
Word was recieved today that two weeks ago the Imperial Battle cruiser Adamdun 
mistakenly engaged and destroyed the merchant craft Bloodwell of the Oberlindes 
Line. The Bloodwell, according to the crew of the battle cruiser, was not 
showing its ID transponder signal and would not answer broad-beam hails. The 
Bloodwell was under full acceleration, and after it refused to change vector 
in response to laser warning fire, it was engaged engaged by high-G missile 
fire and destroyed. A subsequent (and unsuccessful) search for survivors 
resulted in the identification of the ship.

Oberlindes Lines officials called the story "an obvious cover-up of a tragic 
display of incompetence." and claimed that the Bloodwell\'s ID transponder had 
just undergone its annual maintenance check, and could not have failed to 
function. As in all commercial vessels, the ID transponder was supposedly 
tamper-proof, and are could not have been turned off by the crew. Legal action 
is expected.

While I\'m here, a few more questions from the CT era:

1) Why is Ruie not part of the imperium?

2) What is the reason for Roup\'s Amber Classification?

3) What is the reason for Pscias\' Red Classification?

Fine.  You write it.  Unless you haven\'t figured it out, the people who
wrote FFS2 (many of whom you are insulting repeatedly) were told NOT to
design a combat system.  There were given an ASSIGNMENT, and not much time
to do it.  Several people have said that they were told that the combat
system would be ready before the deadline.  Guess what? It didn\'t happen,
and the FFS2 deadline rolled around, so they had to do the best that they
could with what they had.  As far as I\'m concerned, the authors of FFS2
have done an excellent job.

I think you are whining that Traveller isn\'t custom designed just for you.
FFS2 has been out for two weeks.  It hasn\'t made it to many parts of the
country yet due to the UPS strike.  GIVE US A CHANCE TO WORK OUT SOME
PACKAGES!  You seem to expect that we\'ll hand-deliver what you want right
now, with a big cheery smile on our faces while you call us names.  Grow up.

You have three choices.  Either breakdown and spend $25 on a scientific
calculator, get one of the many spreadsheets avalible, or wait for those
folks who do QSDS packages to get around to it.  I\'m sorry that I haven\'t
devoted 24 hour days to fulfiling you whims, but my doctor seems to think
that HD treatment is more important.  I imagine that the other gearheads
have similar real life concerns.

*If* IG had provided the FFS2 design team with the space combat system, I
imagine that the book would have been different.  Of course, you can use
ships built with FFS2 with BL, RPSC, or any other Traveller combat system
because everything is in real world units.

Now you are getting pedantic.  You have made your point.  If you want to go
away, please go away.   Like I have said, Leonard has said, and several
others have said: give us a little time to start producing QSDS plug ins!
We have to *write* and *test* these things (you know, that work you expect
others to do for you) before we post them so that you won\'t be back in six
weeks screaming that the design is broken because Doug\'s laser turret
states xxx, whereas on Joe\'s website it says yyy.

But here, for you gaming pleasure, I present The Doug Berry Space Combat
System.

Each side rolls one die.  Add Pilot, Ship Tactics, and Gunnery Skill for
each ship.  Add total number of lasers.  High roll wins.

Feel free to modify the DBSCS(c) as needed to cover changing tactical
situations.

Is that simple enough?

No, we told you six months ago.  Have you just *now* figured out that IG\'s
schedule is two parts fantasy and one part wistful thinking?  Did you
somehow miss every reference to FFS2 as a gearhead book?

When you see the August THUDDD, take a look at the ships designed.  They
all us the common T4 ship description.  They were alldesigned using
different sequences.  In reviewing my Terrapin, I find that the basic
design is still sound under FFS2.  The only change needed was to adjust the
sensor description.

I\'ve used a battlefield missile designed using the new FFS2 two nights ago.  

I have tried to keep my temper, but you are pushing me.  I will make this
very damn clear.  I do not appreciate you calling me, my friends, or any of
the people who worked on FFS2 names of any sort.  That is immature and
uncalled for.  You dodn\'t like the book?  Tough.  Perhaps you shhould have
looked at it before you bought it.  This is why I don\'t own a copy of
Starships or Anomiles.. I looked first.  If you haven\'t learned that first
lesson of consumerism, then too bad for you.

You seem to have a problem with anybody who enjoys design work.  Guess
what?  We are the ones who are shaping the game simply because we are the
ones who are bothering too.  You want to make a mark?  Sit down and write
something.  But be prepared to have your work and yor person attacked by
people for any number of reasons.

You want a dradnought?  Here:

Marvin class dreadnought.

Size: REAL Big
Guns: Lots
Armor: Thick
Apperance: Big Shiny wedge

Anything more will require that somebody sit down and hack out the numbers.
 The whole point of FFS2 is to allow those of us who enjoy doing this the
chance to develop starships and the like.  This means that rather than a
stock Battleship, you be able to choose one you like, and the\'ll have some
flavor to them.

I\'m currently noodling around with the _Royal_ class Battleship, a 90kton
TL12 ship that fulfils the role of ship of the line for the new Imperium.
When it is done, I will post it to the list.  You will then have Traveller
stats for a Dreadnaught.  I will have done all the work.  What do I get?
Nada. Zip.  

I may even do some weapon packages for QSDS (I\'m back on disability, and
have a great deal of time on my hands.)

The systems are pretty compatible.  Sensors and fusion+ will be the only

Yeah, and they should have done Windows before DOS...  Please read
carefully: QSDS is a simple system using PREBUILT MODULES to allow for
quick, simple starship contruction.  Thos modiules were built using FFS.
So it stands to reason that FFS had to come first.

I don\'t know about any of the others who are writing, but I\'m in it because
I like it.

So you you dislike designs that are hand waved out of thin air?  Then why
do you bitch so mightily about the attempt to make a solid design system?

Perhaps you should sell FFS2 back to your gamestore, it doesn\'t seem to be
for you.

************************************

Jay,

I think that it really might be a good idea for you to follow your own
advice. ARRRRGGGHH!!! Mk. II  The game is supposed to be fun...but it
seems that it has no longer become that for you.  If your blood pressure
is really running as high as it appears to be in your posts, then
continuing with T4 is going to drive you to an early grave.  There\'s
plenty of CT/MT/TNE stuff out there to keep a ref. with a little
imagination going for a long time.

Secondly, I would just like to state that, while I\'m sure you think that
adding expletives to your posts really drives home your point...I for
one do not appreciate them.  Thats just my opinion and I will attempt to
avoid reading your posts in the future to avoid them...which is sad
because I like to hear everyones opinions.  However for me your language
is not only offensive...but also tends to have me give less credence to
your opinions than I otherwise might...then again your writing style is
your choice.

Anyway, find some rule you like and have fun.  I doubt very much that
Marc intended the revised Traveller to cause anyone to have a heart
attack and all the anger and cursing in the world is not going to turn
back the clock a year and produce the product you want.

Jeff, I\'m with you on this one!  I *use* alternative technology in my

I *hope* GDW-Beta becomes a *hotbed* of alternative technology development

an alternative site, but they are more focused on using what we already

Eris,

A request.......I push my time limit envelope as it is with reading all
the TMLs (not whining, just the truth....and actually prefer it to the
alternative of having so little to do that I am bored out of my skull)
and will not have the time to subscrive to yet another list (in this
case GDW-beta).  If this alternate tech disscussion occures on GDW-beta
could you let those of us on TML who are interested that it has started
(I would subscribe for a little while) or at least post a summary to the
TML once the discussion is complete.  I think it would be terribly
interesting and useful for supplying a more "alien" feel to some planets

I uniformly dislike the Chris Foss Protuberant Artwork on most T4 books.
It just does not have the right scale for Traveller, in my opinion.  I
could not do better, but I do not like his stuff for this game.  The
interior illustrations of the main rulebook looked pretty good, but IIRC,
that was done by someone else.

Oh, in my universe, M0 is the land of wood burl shift knobs and hand rubbed
starship consoles, while TL15 is Blinkenlight Heaven.  I decided this
because there were all of those low tech planets in T4, and about the only
thing that a low tech culture can provide is personal servants and
handcrafted goodies, so those became status symbols in the early years.  By
1100, I ruled that the tech levels had evened out a bit more, so that any
planet being traded with regularly was likely within a TL or 2 of its
trading partners.

Despite that, the ships themselves look pretty much like they will a
thousand years later, just with lots and lots of strange luxury items and
as much of the tech as possible hidden.

difficult to design using the FF&S rules.  I do not mind that overmuch, but
I want to know how the Imperial designers get around this.

Because you are limited to .16G as your drive, a TL12 grav vehicle cannot
go faster than about 110KPH.  This means that there are no fuel-free mach
1+ grav bikes possible.

There are also no small, fast courier craft that use only electrical power.

There are two solutions as I see it within the FF&S rules:

1.  Put some heplar drives on your vehicles.  My back of the envelope
designs led me to believe you could make a grav bike with a 5G booster that
could have a good twenty minutes of booster fuel in a reasonable package.

2.  Put a 1t thruster plate and a 1t fusion+ plant in.  This means the
minimum size for a fast, fuel free vehicle is about 5t, when all is said
and done.

A third one that is reasonable, but not explicit.

3.  Add a new type of drive - the electrically powered fan.  This could
probably be hacked up from the helicopter rules, and would make a good
booster for fuel free, undetectable, but slow use.  This would probably not
push you above mach 1, but might be handy for the 110KPH-1000KPH range.

Extension proposals:

There should be improvements in gravitics between 12 and 16.  I am thinking
that you should be able to get .25, .50, .75, and .90G or something like
that at TL 13, 14, 15, and 16.  The sizes, etc., do not necessarily need to
change.

There should be improvements in thruster plates as TL advances.  Perhaps
the minimum size drops from 10m^3 to 1m^3 over that time?

Alternatively, the thrust/weight ratio might improve as well.  I am not yet
sure I want to deal with that, as that alters ship design, but it seems
like all components should get better as time passes.  For jump drives, the
capacitors and power plant part of the system will improve, while for
maneuver drives, it seems like a TL15 ship should get more drive out of the
same space than a TL12.

Any interest in extending these charts?

In addition, physical fatigue would be reduced greatly by just having what-
ever internal gravity there may be switched off. There is IMHO a large 
difference between being stuck in the cockpit of an F15 for 12 hours under-
going the pull of gravity making your legs and butt get numb and tired on
the seat underneath you, and floating just off the seat in a natural fetal 
position with no strain on your body in an inertially damped space fighter.
Sure, for combat you will be strapped in tight, but for a long run out some-
wheres with no combat expected, you\'d be expected to loosen up the
belts a bit and float, perhaps catch a few Z\'s with the computer set to wake
you if anything funny is detected.

This is a reason the staterooms on my ship plans tend to be smaller than the
usual design, I don\'t include beds in my deckplans. I can\'t imagine any 
culture that has gravitic control as an everyday fact of life not having 
zero g beds as the norm while planet side. Using this as a given (in my
campaign, at least), I can see absolutely no reason to wasted valuable
shipboard space on anything more complex than a containment system
(i.e. net) attached to the wall to hold you in place, or at most a type of 
closet/cubby like some of the shuttle folks sleep in now.

Er - how else are simple systems?  If there is not a high complexity system
underlying them, then they are usually terribly inconsistent in ways
obvious the first time you try to use it.  This is simple fact, and can be
witnessed right here in River City.  Take any two design systems hiding in
Traveller, and part of why they are completely inconsistent is that they
are running from different assumptions.

Hell, even Star Trek, land of inconsistency, has a writer\'s guide that
describes how the tech works.  FF&S is the equivalent for Traveller.  It,
or something like it, is needed, imho, as you get bizarre systems otherwise.

The examples you ask for do need to be printed.  From a complicated system,
you can create simple ones, like QSDS.  If you have a complicated system,
you need simple ones, and you need a whole pile of examples.  I want a game
with hundreds of ships, dozens of deck plans, various weapons, tanks, and
all that other stuff.  Without something like FF&S in the hands of the
people designing the simple systems, and likely in the hands of the
designers of many of the example vehicles, I do not think it is going to
happen.

Methinks you are not getting Doug\'s point.  You seem to be saying that IG
should have printed up one of the alternative, simpler, systems as well as
a combat system first.  Perhaps you are right, but someone has to write the
thing, and if they have different assumptions from the other authors, you
get two different things that do not connect.  Further, if the designer
does not have a book like FF&S, the system consists of tables filled with
random numbers that do not mesh well.

Yes, I know that FF&S looks like that, but the tables are not completely
random - they come from an underlying assumption set, and if the book is
complete enough, then the simple systems derived from it will work right.
This was done, and the result is a system that lets whoever updates QSDS
make a system that produces ships that are OK, and reasonably close to what
a scaled up grav tank might do.  Or that a detailed design might allow.

Don\'t be disingenuous.  IG has decided not to PAY FOR a design system and a
combat system at the same time.  I think they should have, but they did
not.  When they get off their asses and decide that they need a combat
system, then they will contract with someone, likely one of the people who
contributed to FF&S.  The combat system will then be reasonably consistent.
 If they are smart, they will make a design goal that the system be
playable at a fun level in under an hour, and preferably under half an hour
for a simple ship to ship deal.  Like the original Starfire game - easy to
run, easy to learn, easy to play, and not that hard to make very difficult
if that is how you like it.

I keep hammering away on consistency for a reason: it makes a big
difference, and without something like FF&S, you are not going to have it.
Example: Traveller starship lasers have megajoule plus muzzle energies and
fire control that can hit at light second distances.  On that scale, grav
tanks are toast.  I need to know that when I play the "low tech fighter
against merchant ship" adventure.  If they do not want that, then they
better pay attention to what they get.

I do not need FF&S to figure that out, but I need both my grav tank and my
starship to have something like the same assumptions.  As a result, HOWEVER
I design my grav tank and my starship, they better both come to kind of
similar results.  Without something like FF&S in the hands of the guy who
writes my simple system, I am sunk without a trace.

...

Ok, let me try a different phrasing.  NOT A SINGLE FUCKING PERSON ON THIS
LIST RUNS IG.  THE SONS OF BITCHES WHO DO THAT DO NOT LISTEN TO US, AND DO
NOT SPEND ENOUGH TIME IN TESTING AND PROOFING PRODUCTS BEFORE THEY SHIP THEM.

Marc Miller listens, sometimes, but he does not plan what IG is going to
do.  Doing that would take him away from the game design that he is clearly
good at and enjoys.  Blaming the authors of FF&S for inconsistencies in
previous products is not going to help.  And saying that they should have
been consistent with one of the previous systems in not really all that
possible.  IIRC, the system in Starships and Guy\'s QSDS are both based on
FF&S, the original, and as a result, this one is going to get results kind
of like those.  As a result, the old starship design systems are at least
sort of consistent, and they could not be more so without this boo, or one
like it.

>ANY BOOK FOR DESIGNING HARDWARE THAT HAS NO SYSTEM FOR USING IT IS A

Bullshit.

You either design the results first, and hope to God they make some kind of
sense when you combine them, or you design the design system first, make it
consistent, and then make a combat system that makes them playable.  In the
ideal case, the public sees neither one before the other is done, and if
you it the second way, it is a lot easier to play test the combat rules.
(Since combats need more people to play than design fests, you want to make
that easier to test.)

To be honest, what I would have done is:

At the same time, cost and spec out FF&S, the Naval/Ground battle book, and
the Example Designs book.  All three are developed at the same time, and
the Example designs book is the test suite for the rest of it.  As you
fiddle with the system, you have a stock set of designs that have to work
right.

Example Designs consists of a ten page system like QSDS, ten pages of
combat rules, and sixty pages of ships, tanks, guns, missiles, and so on.
From the moment you get this, you can be running a game within hour, and be
done an hour after that.

Eventually, you will want more details, and then FF&S and the Battle Book
are waiting for you.

You cannot, though, have the simple system without building the complex
one, because then you end up with exactly the situation you are complaining
about.  A dozen different systems, all with different core assumptions.  A
starship system that makes no sense when ANYONE with even an idiot\'s
conception of science looks at it.  Even an idiot knows that cities die
when nuked.  If I have nukes as primary staship weapons, then he is going
to think of blasting a city with one.  What stops him?  Nuclear dampers on
high tech planets, which is something that a simple system probably does
not need to cover, because they are big and expensive.

Every potential player of an SF game probably knows enough science to see
the flaws, so if your game has science in it, you better do it sort of
right.  By having the complexity available, the science is potentially
consistent.  Like any SF, you cannot blow suspension of disbelief with
incosistency.

I am not claiming that the present situation is perfect, or even good, but
I find it hopeful.  T4 has been out for less than a year, and we now have a
decent design base.  If they get their thumbs out, continue to support
adventures like TLWH, and make it a quest to never release a supplement
with a map-text problem like M0, they have a much better shot.

I really think IG has a process problem - everything they produce suffers
to a greater or lesser extent from being rushed to market.

Example: FF&S needs the combat system, and both need an approachable system
for people who are not programmers.  This is obvious to me, and to the
designers, and everyone else looking.  With FF&S2, they have the
complicated stuff, and now a simple program can generate tables for
something like QSDS, and will produce a simple system where you do not need
to know what a square root is.  The end user does not write the program,
and should not even know it exists.  Most customers just see a ten page
ship design system that takes under 15 minutes to navigate, and a ten page
combat system that is neat and easy to play.

Given the interdependence, you release all three at the same time.  You
have to release the simple ones and the examples first, or you lose some
sales, but once the complicated ones are done, why hold on to them.
Therefore, simultaneous release.

IG gets to sell books full of new and better ships, guns, etc.  They have
easy fodder for the people who can get the system.  This would have
required a decent test time, and a decent combat system, which they have to
pony up the money for.  IG does not like doing that.

Standing behind QSDS and putting it on their web site would be an elegant
solution to the simple design system problem, as then the simple system is
free for download.  Putting up a five page combat system would work fairly
well, as then people could "try it out."  If they try that before they get
the hard rules done, then they end up with inconsistencies JUST like those
between the vehicle design system and every one of the starship design
systems, so they better have the hard combat system done before they post
the easy one.

It\'s a nice rule. Seeing stuff like this is THE reason I subscribe
to this list. However, I have a question. Why the fixation on
a 2 parsec distance for neighboring worlds? I\'m curious because it
seems to me that higher TL worlds should use longer distances than
that.

Or am I missing something? Maybe you\'re following the KISS rule.

    'body' => 'The following are comments, observations and questions that I have concerning
the Tasks chapter.  In general, I like the style of presentation and writing
a lot.

Observation:  In the introduction, half-dice should be half-die.

Observation:  In the first paragraph of An Overview Of Tasks the first
    sentence should read:
        A task expresses an action....

Comment:  The format for the task statement itself is confusing because of
    the use of the symbol <.  Since the task statement deals primarily with
    numbers, upon first reading this I take the statement to mean add 
    characteristic, skill and modifiers and the dice roll must be greater
    that this number.  Of course, the dice roll needs to be less than or
    equal to this number (for success that is).  I think either a different
    symbol should be used or another format.  A possible format instead:

            Difficulty, Characteristic, Skill
                Modifiers

            To repair a grav vehicle.
            Difficult, Dex, Gravitics
                +1 for Tools (required)
            Probably takes several hours.

Comment: Drop the half die for difficult tasks.  If a half die was used
    more extensively in the game system, I would say keep it, but if it
    is only going to be used for difficult task resolution, drop it and
    make the progression a smooth one from 1D to 6D.

Observation:  The target number in the Rolling Tasks section should be:
    (12 + 2) = 14

Comment:  Label the task for box Universal Task Format (like it is at the
    end of the document)

Comment:  Under Task Modifiers, an example or two (maybe one for having
    necessary items, another as a situation based modifier) would be nice.

Observation:  The first sentence in the section Half Dice doesn\'t make
    sense.

Comment:  In the paragraph When Easy Tasks Are Hard, I would suggest that
    easy tasks are always rolled.  The reason is two-fold.  First, the
    paragraph does not deal with modifiers, such as, for example, direct
    fire combat at night (night adding a negative modifier which could
    make an automatic Easy task for someone no longer automatic).  Second,
    the referee should be allowed to keep some modifiers secret for
    various types of tasks, especially if the characters are unaware of a
    situation modifier.  For example,

        To avoid a police car in a high speed pursuit.
        Difficult (2.5D): Dex, Ground Craft
            -3 for not noticing black ice on road
            -2 for not noticing bald tires
        Road is covered up ahead with black ice.

Observation:  The second sentence in the first paragraph of Default Skills
    should read:
        Any character may attempt a task which specifies a skill that is
        designated as a Default Skill,.....

Question:  Under Cooperative Tasks, in the past, the character with the
    highest skill level would add their characteristic to the task attempt,
    not the character with the highest characteristic.  Is this a change?

Question:  Under Opposed Tasks, is N, the number of characters, referring to
    1 side only, both sides equally or both sides total?  Also, how do the
    participants on each side contribute their skills and characteristics,
    as it is done under cooperative tasks, or total all appropriate values?

Observation:  The explanation of the Uncertain Task example should read:
        The player would roll 1.5D and the referee would secretly roll 1D.
        Assuming Int 7 and Fast Talk-3 and he has the Fake ID, the required
        roll must be 11 or less on 2.5D.  If the player rolls 3, he knows
        he must have succeeded (since even if the hidden die roll is 6, the
        task would succeed); if the player rolls 11, he knows he must have
        failed (since even if the hidden die roll is only 1, the task would
        fail).  But if he rolls between 6 and 10, he cannot know if he
        succeeded or failed until the referee indicates the results of the
        third die.

Comment:  The sections Task Without Skill and Tasks With Skill Only provide
    a very good explanation of and add flexibility to the task system.

Question:  In the Spectacular Results section, does the rolling of 3 1\'s or
    6\'s include the result on any half die (before of after dividing by two)?
    What about uncertain tasks, does the die/dice rolled by the referee
    contribute to the determination of spectacular results?

Question:  In the section Probabilities, why should the probabilities of
    spectacular results always be the same (disregarding the special case
    involving a half die), regardless of difficulty level?

Question:  Can hasty or cautious tasks increase the task level beyond
    Hopeless or below Easy, respectively?

Observation:  In the section Duration, the last sentence of the first
    paragraph of the description of Cautious tasks should read:
Uncertainty is unaffected....

Question:  Under Jack of All Trades, can this skill be now used in place of
    default and non-default skills?

Question:  Is the section Divided Attention replacing the multiple actions
    rule from T4?

Comment:  The paragraph Don\'t overdo pre-defined tasks has almost nothing
    to do with the title.

Observation:  The last sentence of The Role Of The Referee is incomplete.

Observation:  The last paragraph of 2. Express the Task Statement has
    information that should be in the section 3. Express The Task Comments

Comment:  The sections An Understanding Of Tasks and Task In Action give
    excellent insight into the thoughts behind the system.

Observation:  The third line of the fifth paragraph under An Understanding
    Of Tasks should be either
        Strength-4 and Skill 8
            or
        Strength-3 and Skill-9

Observation:  Remove the last sentence from the fourth paragraph under
    Tasks In Action.  This is the Tasks Chapter.

Observation:  The fourth sentence in the section Difficult Tasks under 
   Tasks in Action should read:
        Spectacular Failure happens if the roll is three 6\'s.

Observation:  The first sentence in the section More Training should read
        ...is the same as Dex 11 and Demolitions-1...

Comment:  The idea of a Task Library is really nice for commonly used
    tasks.

Observation:  The section The Exploits of Darkhamaar\'s Crew is incomplete.

Whoa whoa whoa there! Ebonics was \'recognized\' under some highly
misunderstood guidelines in ONE, (1) school district, Oakland CA.

What it _is_ is a clearly recognizable dialect, with distinct rules and
grammar. Ask the linguists who actually study it.

The \'second language\' bit got convoluted when the school administrators in
Oakland \'made it so\' for the purposes of integrating the children who
speak nothing but ebonics into the classroom.

What it is _not_ is a commiesymp pinko plot to degrade our children until
they\'re so dumb they\'ll watch stuff like MTV and TV sitcoms (hey
waitafrigginminute...maybe the commiesymp pinkos WON!)

It\'s right up there in misinformation whith the current twits in Cingress
all up in arms because the US refuses to destroy the public school system
infavor of private ones. They had some dumba** congresscritter up spouting
about how "All Amurrican children deserve the chances that Chelsea Clinton
has..."

Why yes, they do, if you can put up the tutition required yearly that the
Clintons pay out of their own pocket..duh! But handing money from the
public funds to pay for private schools is government subsidy,
nothing less, something that these stupid Republicans are too blind to see
if it bites them on the a**.

Sorry, but there are a lot of nutcases out there siezed upon the entire
"Ebonics" thing to call for things like dissolving the entire public
school system, \'give\' the parts away to private industry who could then
run them \'oh so much more efficiently\'. Sort of nationalization in
reverse.

Private schools work because A) they can accept, deny or kick out _anyone_
they want for _any_ reason they want, and b) they typically spend a _hell_
of a lot more per student than public schools.

Sorry, the rant is _completely_ off topic, I\'ll return you now to the
"Foss art destroyed IG by making them use gearheads to write FFS2 with
Bic NearC Virocks" flame now in progress.

I agree that TML might not be the best forum for this.  Perhaps the nuts
and bolts of the tech should be explored elsewhere.  But it SHOULD be
explored and incorporated/extrapolated/interpolated into the game.  Maybe
and end of discussion summary would do for each topic could be posted
to the TML for consumption.  A succinct, useful, gameable version.  

We need to explore future tech vigorously so that Traveller doesn\'t 
become an unintentional Space 1889 (i.e., badly outdated tech ideas).

Eric has already noted the problem with accumulators and I\'ve noted the
power plant problem.  These affect the hard science of the game just as
much as if you planted an balmy earthlike world out near Pluto.

I somehow don\'t think we\'ll be using silicon chips in 100 years.

CSC
- ----

This is a Q&D Macintosh application that implements the design system found
in CSC.  Note hugely compatible with FFS, I\'m afraid, but then the CSC stuff
doesn\'t seem to be that compatible with Real Life (tm).  (Ie. I haven\'t been
able to design a WWII Jeep for less than 45k, or my 1987 Tercel for less than
15k, or a Greek/Roman galley that comes near actual performance.) 

For what it\'s worth, though, here is the program.


Metator
- ----

Here is an updated version of Metator (now up to v1.0.3d).  Features
supported:

1) System generation using an updated version of Scouts/MT.  Systems
displayed as a list of UWPs, a schematic view (similar to Long Way Home), or
with circular orbits and actual positions.  Map scale can be set to linear,
logarithmic, or schematic diagram.

2) Worlds detailed using World Builders Handbook, TNE, real science, and some
homebrew rules.  Core type, density, gravity, horizon distance, atmospheric
composition...  Also includes social data like government branches, law and
tech level by area, unusual customs...

3) World maps created (not good ones, though).

4) Starship encounter tables created (my homebrew system,based on world stats
and milieu). User can add starships to the available types.

5) Trade tables created using my homebrew system
<http://www.interlog.com/~dmci104/GamingClub/Traveller/trade.html>.  User can
add to list of exports.  Passenger and freight rolls also displayed.

6) Animal encounter tables generated.

7) Temperature tables generated, as well as weather tables (from Grand
Survey).

8) Air pressure and water pressure tables (for those who like mountaineering
and diving).


Things missing:

1) Some star data (didn\'t have my books on holiday).

2) Evolutionary diagrams (coming, just incomplete).

3) Mountain diagrams (may make this one a separate program).

4) Better world maps.

5) Printing of colour pictures.  (You can print schematic map symbols,but I\'d
rather print custom colour/grayscale icons :-)



PS.  For those of you waiting for responses from IG, I emailed this software

Yeah, but you\'ve got an exhause that would be, ahem, kind of a pain to

Actually, IIRC, the base size for Thruster plates is considerably bigger
than that, limiting Thrust Plate craft to something like 50 or 100 t or
greater.

Ahhh, yes, ducted fans. This is something that is sorely missing from FFS
completely: with the advent of insanely cheap power via Fusion+, electric
motors become vastly more important, and really should be covered as power
sources for \'thrust\' agencies. Sadly, the _old_ FFS allowed that, with
propellors, wheels, etc needing X amoount of power, without really
specifying what the power is. 

At Tl12, especially with the advances that RT superconductors can bring,
you can get some very powerful, light electric motors. Hell, even modern
electric motors would work, with a properly designed ducted fan.

Sadly I know NADA about such things in the real world, ie power/weight,
how big a ducted fan has to be to generate X thrust, etc.

Marbles off a sidewalk. 

Every time I think we\'ve ascended to new heights of unreality, we reach
another plateau. You just plain cannot talk to people who are so utterly
hostile to the idea of simplicity that they mistake internal consistency
for Star-Trek mushiness and unwieldy complexity for psuedo-realism. The
Politics Of Bullshittium have laid T4 low.

Look, dude, I can pick from a plethora of published designs in every
other game system extant, not merely one or two archtypical examples
scattered across several different supplements. As far as \'hacking
numbers\', I could design my own vehicles, fighters, and big badass space
cruisers in Traveller Classic and even MegaTraveller, which was easy to
sit down and use although it required you to refigure everything every
third step, and took a helluva lot longer that it ought to have. It is
not like being able to build your own stuff WITHOUT a scientific
calculator is some sort of novel requirement on my part.

What I want, and what will sell, is a game system that is internally
consistent and comprehensible and will let me do roughly what I want.
Even in MT, this is what we had. I do not WANT and should not HAVE to
consult countless errata and download countless spreadsheets to include
the most basic of items in my campaign. After a year\'s waiting and $120,
I want to be able to do it myself out of published materials. That\'s not
whining, or forcing my personal dictates on anyone. That\'s utterly
real-world reasonable, and the bare-assed minimum that any game system
that wishes to survive should muster. I want not perfection, but
competancy... and an assurance that each book I buy will not be
invalidated every few months.

As it is, VDS, QSDS, SSDS, FF&S2, and our published catalog of
spacecraft all disagree with each other (oh, and FF&S 2 is MOSTLY
consistent with the old FF&S save in sensors and Fusion +. Only the eyes
& ears and power supply of every sub-100-ton vehicle in the Traveller
universe. Merely that. No problem for any COMPETANT human being to
figure out... save that I shouldn\'t have to figure it out to begin with,
but that\'s just selfish whining on my part. Oh, so the sensor arrays in
all my QSDS and SSDS craft are now botched and will have to be refigured
in order to be canon, and I will have to spend another $25 for the
privilege of doing IG\'s work for them. Hey, no sweat).

Not to mention that whatever game system IG ultimately comes out with
will now have to include a full array of tables and charts so that all
that \'real-world data\' you\'re so proud of can be converted into useable
information BEFORE they can play. Perhaps you do not understand that
this is more brain-twisting trouble than 99% of the gamer community will
wish to go to.

IG\'s only (slim) chance to save their asses will be to put whatever
spreadsheets you guys come up with on their Web site for free download.
In the meantime, everyone in the real world who wants to know what a
micro-second is within the game (or mass, or a G-hour, or how all of
this useless verbiage impacts the performance of whatever designs they
can cough up) will have to go with their questions unanswered. At least
a spreadsheet allows them to ignore such things, instead of having to
painrtakingly edit the design system for what is relevant and what
isn\'t.

It is a bit as though AD&D included the tensile strength and Rockwell
hardness of every weapon and piece of armor in the game, but didn\'t tell
you WHY.... and gave you only leather, plate, and shield as stock armor;
and required you -- if you wanted anything more comprehensive than this
absurdly limited array of personal protection (and why the hell would
you want different kinds of armor in a heroic fantasy game?) -- to go
buy a $25, nightmarishly complex game-designers supplement and a $30
scientific calculator and learn how to use them both.... 

.....and on top of it all, obstinantly refused to give you a more
advanced combat system that MADE USE of things like tensile strength,
stress points, etc. (not that 90% of gamers would be able to use it if
it existed.) Oh, but wait -- there are three or four published
designer\'s supplements, and none of them are consistent with the other,
or even with the published lists of weapons and armor..... which one to
use?

I guess every baffled, whiney-assed gamer who doesn\'t have access to the
digest -- and hence your noble efforts to make this monster you have
wrought accessable to the rest of us -- will just have to go hang.

DC to DC converters could be used to increase the output voltage, you 
just have to be careful to purchase (or build) one that can handle 
high currents.

I\'m not sure what you mean by this.  The output voltage of a capacitor
when fully charged is equal to the voltage level used to charge it.  
What you need to worry about is the amount of resistance in the 
load across the output, which will limit the current across the load.
If the resistance is too low (no matter what voltage level the cap
is charged to, ie: 2.5v or 100v), and the capacitor has been charged
enough it can do anything from simply warm that load up to vaporizing
it.  The useful figure here is the energy, in joules, that is stored
in the device.  Hmm, I don\'t know how much energy it takes to 
vaporize 3cm off the end of a large screwdriver (I\'m sure someone
could tell me, and yes I once watched from five feet away while an
electric company employee proceeded to do this; Wow!) but it may be 
possible with a 100F - 2.5v capacitor, it\'s only 312.5J fully 
charged though.

Couldn\'t we use DC-DC converters(like above), or even put the 
current through an inverter and then use high voltage/current 
multipliers?  Thousand volt diodes are easy to come by, even if
their not inexpensive.

I\'ve seen what happens when even a 1000uF @ 12V cap exploded once in
a lab, it\'s not something I\'d want to be leaning over. ;-)

    ::chuckle:: Problem is I could actually see this happening too!  Perhaps as
you develop Mileu 200 and then the Rim and other places not yet visited in
terms of star maps or Canon.  You can tuck in pockets of the various other
cultures of Asia.  I could easily see a trickle of immigration to the Rimward
throughout the 2nd Imperium of Asians with their cultures trying to escape the
growing problems to Coreward and settle the virgin worlds beyond the reach of
Terra.
    That would go quite a ways to balancing things out, not to mention creating
some interesting situations out there. ;)

    And as many a Master I\'ve trained with would say with a smile.  "And when
you have to reload?"  Dodging and finding cover is something people can get
very good at when their lives are threatened.  More to the point Traveller
really doesn\'t have a way of handling all the Martial Arts that exist or will
develop over the centuries to come.  This may seem like a small point but with
the usual lives the average PC leads they would run into this fairly
frequently.  Not to mention that it can make for great "chrome" for designing a
world or culture and something new to make the PC\'s lives... eventful!

> Calling it Unarmed Combat infringes on Brawling.
    EXACTLY!  Brawling as described is functionally untrained Hand to Hand and
it can be very effective, but because it is untrained it can leave huge
vulnerable holes in the Brawler\'s defensive and offensive repertoire.  It\'s the
difference between a bunch of folks picking up some weapons and going out and
getting into some firefights in the city and joining an actual military force
and training to fight in cities, and forests, and deserts, and on beaches, and
with combined arms teams, and with air support, and...
    See my point?  Sure, the bunch of folks who picked up some weapons and
survived some firefights in the city are gonna be pretty good at surviving and
fighting in a city environment.  How good are they going to be at fighting in a
desert?  With using or facing close air support?  This is just an analogy but
do you see the point I\'m making?

    Okay, this makes sense, however it\'s gonna cost more time the greater the
distance from the original TL at which the skill was used.  FoEx; A modern car
mechanic can go and fix an old Model-T, these vehicles are legendary for how
easy this is to do.  But if our car mechanic is used to using diagnostic
computers and all the other modern equipment he\'s gonna take a LOT longer to
figure out how to fix that Model-T.  It\'s certainly a simplier machine, but
it\'s completely different from what our car mechanic is used to dealing with.
This has economic implications BTW... ;)

    Marc, your mechanic must LOVE YOU if you let him get away with charging you
with a complete replacement rather then simply repairing the assembly!  Again,
this has economic implications.  I suspect part of this problem might come from
the fact that you\'re designing and thinking in terms of PC use of skills
exclusively.  BUT all of the skills in Traveller are used by NPCs to run the
various societies the PC encounter and move through.
    To take your example of Fred with a Ground Craft-4, he\'s going to want a
job using that skill.  Now thinking as an _Employer_ trying to _Make a Profit_
would you hire a LoTech Ground Craft-4 and put up with having to have to PAY
for his working through the learning curve to get up to speed with HiTech
equipment?  I\'ll tell you the economic reality, because I had an Uncle go
through this, No you will not!  As an Employer you expect a person to have a
certain level of competence with the task at hand, that\'s why you hired them!
    Now for PCs, struggling to handle all the variations in Tech they encounter
this may work.  It breaks down when it gets applied to the RW STS.

I have at 30 ship designs, done by various people, all in the same format.
You can\'t tell who used what to design what unless you are told.  I\'m sure
that us gearheads could talk to Gold Rush Games and get paid to publish a
few books of ships.  Of course, right up until today, if you had asked, I
would have given them to you.

It\'s called QSDS.  It came with the basic T4 rule book, and it was based on
FFS.  You bought a book that you did not need, and can\'t seem to use.  For
this, you are blaming the authors.

MegaTraveller.  Not having to consult errata.  Excuse me while I laugh

QSDS is still a perfectly valid design system.  Use it, and i know that I\'m
planning on submitting QSDS design packages to JTAS for all to use.  Why

How many small craft will you have to redesign?  Honestly.  How many.  As
for the sensors,  get ready, here is the ENTIRE set of instructions on
converting:  "use Table 204"  *gasp*.   I can see where you would rebel at
the thought of looking up one table.  (It is mislabeled, but easily found.)

So a range table is beyond your understanding?  You can\'t comprehend a dama
ge results table?  I think you gravely underestimate the gaming community.

Every Traveller related piece of software I know of is freeware.  Of
course, you never asked for it, just screamed at us.  Here\'s a secret, I do
all my hard work on a spreadsheet, with a pad of paper and a calculator for
side work.  It takes me 25 minutes to rough out a ship or weapons system
using FFS, and I\'m waiting for a FFS2 spreadsheet.  I can do it, why can\'t
or won\'t you?

It\'s all relevant, unless you want to play space fantasy.

Apples and Oranges.  AD&D is a game of High Heroic Fantasy.  It revels in
being highly unrealistic.  Traveller is a game that has always tried to
ground itself withing the posiibilities of science.  That is why we didn\'t
start out with "photonic blasters" and "lightsabres"  we started with
autopistols and cutlasses.  This is why Traveller suceeded, the internal
consistancy.

Once again, AD&D has been essentialy unchanged since 1978.  Traveller has
had four completely different sets of rules.  Take a look at the state of
AD&D circa 1979, and tell me that it was any more complete.

Jay, there is a magazine called Journal of the Travellers\' Aid Society,
edited by a nice lady named Jean.  She needs articles.  She really wants
articles.  So what I do is write articles for her.  If I choose, I could
spend tommorow whipping out 6 pages of QSDS packages and she\'d probably buy
them.

Also, just because you seem to be incapable of figuring out FFS2, don\'t bet
others can\'t; I was at my VFNSLGS today, and I was chatting with a couple
of kids.  One of them had bought FFS2 the other day, and was enthusing
about how "stone" the system was.  He was 12.

Well,

My old campaign was not *exactly* Canon, but the whole basis to the
campaign was that the reason Terrans got into space in the first place
was due to population pressures on Earth.  As Earth\'s population
increased into the 500,000,000,000 mark resources and living space got
sparse and folks were shipped off on automated sleepers. 

Hence in my old campaign there were ethnic enclaves, and guess what, the
same ethnic clashes as on earth.

Far be it for me to throw cold water on our little conspiracy
sub-thread, but the transistor was discovered in the 1920\'s by some RCA
researchers.  They showed the Administrator of their lab, who told them to
drop that stupid research and get back to what they were getting paid to
do...designing vacuum tubes.  They did.

So, the transistor was only *rediscovered* by Terrans in \'47. ;->

A device known as "The Motorman\'s Friend" was sold up until the sixties in

And this seems completely correct.  However it then follows on to say
that a person will not be able to get a job if he has not got experience
with skill use at that TL.  Which makes sense to me (and which I\'ve
snipped to save space) and finishes with the following.

To which I say.  Ah ha, an examination of the real world (i.e.
Traveller) will show IMHO that most people will not be traveller\'s to
any great degree.  Therefore the low tech trained Mechanic would seldom
be called to compete for jobs in a high tech environment (or vice
versa).
However, I think that given a few weeks/months to become familiar with
the resources involved then that mechanic should be able to perform
adequately.

It seems, to me anyway, perfectly reasonable to have a skill like
mechanic that covers all mechanical endeavours of all types, and if
required then a familiarity for a specific TL, or range of TL\'s, could
be tacked onto the skill (simply listing the TL\'s the mechanic is
competent in).

It could easily be argued that a mechanic trained in Ford Motorcars
might have significant problems servicing a hovercraft (some have
proiblems servicing Ford Motorcars if mine was anything to go by) but I
think this _way much extremo_ and goes against the Traveller creed.

Thoughts anyone

Nope, just like it doesn\'t surprise me that the Soviet Union had
energy weapons for ten years before the US\'s own highly touted
scientists thought they were possible.  ;)

For good reading check out _The Chariots of the Gods_ by Erik Von

for previous high tech societies here on dirt..uh, Earth.

	if you still have a "select dice from a pool" option, its
	still quite easy to have a high stat, or else unbalanced
	character for powergamers. I would advise to spilt the one
	big pool into several smaller ones :

	- Attribute Pool : 12d6 (allows a max of 6 skills)
	- Enlistment, Injury, Commision, Promotion and Continuance
	  either rolled normaly or at referees discretion.
	- Skills Pool : 12d6 per term (allows a max of 6 skills)
	- Mustering out rolled normaly or at referees discretion.

	This would allow some freedom of choice while constraining
	game balance.

Actually, High Guard says size class P which starts at 50,000 tons,
and extends up to one ton below size class Q (75,000 tons) so the
Vilani could have had up to 74,999 tons.  In my campaign, I always
made the last 100 tons a percentile roll for the players.  They
wanted to do a 1,999 ton ship--they changed their minds when I told
them that 99% of the time, they would be treated as a 2,000 ton
vessel.  They promptly made the ship 1,900 tons. <G>

The caveat must also be added that the assumption here is that the
Vilani had TL11 computers, which matches J-2 drives.  All in all,
the Vilani could have up to 74,900 tons, given the CT constraints,
and some referee input. <G>

Andrew\'s post had the TL10 change taking place at the _end_ of the
FIW (again assuming JumpTech 9/10).  The limit on computers for TL9
is size D, or up to 4,900 tons!  Again, the same caveat for computers
as above for the Vilani.

Notice also that the Terrans had 4,900 ton ships, combined command and
control for the FIW (United Worlds, soon Terran Confederation doesn\'t
happen until the end of the FIW in -2400).

You also need to point out that in High Guard, the combat differential
mods due to computers is +computer difference (yours-theirs)--Vilani
are plus one (+1) on _all_ HG combat tables, Terrans are minus one (-1)
on _all_ combat tables (that is +2/-2 at the start of the FIW).

Four points:  1) there are a lot of assumptions in this picture
                 (mentioned and not mentioned).

              2) Harold would tell us that the Terrans _must_ be TL9 for
                 T4 to be consistent with CT--(T4 _is_ Traveller).

              3) HIGH GUARD was _not_ gearheading in its earliest form
                 as someone previously claimed, IMO.  (It may have been
                 inspiration, however.)

              4) Questioning slavishly believed dogma is the key to
                 the scientific method.  I love Galileo, he really
                 is a hero (and more so these days).


Thanks for the blast down memory lane. <G>  I just could not resist

I may have been disappointed with the way IG has started producing 
things and the lack of examples provided in FF&S 2 that help new 
Traveller players (who are the future of this game, NOT grognards like 
us), but I cannot condone Jay\'s continued hammering away at the 
contributors of the list.
   It is unfortunate that IG has allowed the situation to deteriorate, 
and let us not kid ourselves, things are not good for Traveller.  
However, it will only prevail if the dedicated player/enthusiasts of 
this mailing list continue to assure consistency and quality with the 
work they do that goes into future IG products.
   I think Marc Miller\'s job is formidable NOT impossible, it is 
unfortunate that there aren\'t veteran hands like Frank Chadwick or Loren 
Wiseman to help with the product line/planning aspects of IG, but we 
must prevail over that if Traveller is to thrive.
   Make no doubt, I\'m still on board Traveller and will go down with the 
ship should it happen.
   Let\'s cease this bickering and move on.  Our game needs us.

Charles

I forgot to mention that the same reasoning applies using the MT
ship design and construction rules, since they differed little from
the High Guard rules.  As I see it, I am right on in every thing
I said applying using MT, except that I could never figure out how
the CP (Command Point) thingy worked.  It still works out to ship
sizes.

I won\'t even pretend to know any implications of TNE, but that was

	Most of my light grav vehicle designs (TL11 - TL13) use an MHD 
turbine or a gas turbine for power, coupled to ducted turbofans for 
power. Admittedly, they are not fuel-free but need fossile 
(hydrocarbon) fuel to keep going. But, they\'re cheap, reliable and 
can be fixed on nearly any planet with reasonable technology. A TL 12 
gravcar (2-seat, 1 disp. ton) has a top speed of around 30kph and 
costs less than Cr 40,000. :)

Yeesh. I had to specifically tell my players that technology in my campaign
is nothing like what is shown in this movie.

For example, in my campaign unpowered derelict starships cannot remain for
days in a stable orbit inside a gas giant\'s atmosphere, starship bridges do
not have glass windows which the pilot must watch out of to steer the ship,
starships do not have so many lights on the hull they look like christmas
trees, grav tanks are not designed to dump their occupants and a couple
hundred gallons of fluid onto the floor of the bridge, ship damage is not
repaired by firing automatic spearguns through the ship hull, doors do not
go BANG! so loudly and unexpectedly the crew suffers permanent hearing
loss, in an emergency the normal ships lights do not go out and strobe
lights start flashing all over the place nor does the life support sytem
start pumping out dry ice smoke, bulkheads do not have huge teeth on the
entryways, airlocks do not require a long vocal countdown before opening,
engine rooms have seats and control panels instead of giant spikes all over
the place, corridors do not have revolving \'fun house\' walls, the ship\'s
drive is not a giant rotating armillary sphere with headlights stuck all
over it, starships are not built of Volatile Steel (TM) which
chain-detonates when a satchel charge is set off inside the ship. Also,
jump space is not you-know-what.

Yup, incredible (def. "not credible") is the word for it. In the tradition
of other high-budget SF films, everything looks like a soundstage for a
music video.

What about the negative medical effects of zero gravity.  Do you think
it would be a good idea to have zero gravity beds everywhere ? 
Cannonically Traveller has (at TL 9) anti bone degeneration drugs
(mentioned in CT\'s Beltstrike IIRC) but if everyone is using zero
gravity beds they may need to be taking this drug.

On the other hand it is quite possible that 8 hours a day of zero G has
none of the negative effects that 24 hours a day zero gravity does.

In addition their are certain other activities one can do in bed that
may be somewhat more difficult in zero gravity as the participants may
have difficulty remaining in contact.  I have heard rumors that certain
space shuttle astronauts might have a first hand answer to this
question, can anyone out there confirm this ?

How about simply using gravity control to move the bed into the ceiling
when it is not in use and letting it descend when needed.

Bruce private schools spend normally spend less per student, often a
_lot_ less, than public schools do. The primary reasons they can do so
are that they do not have to take everyone and that they spend alot less
on administration.  (Unless you mean universities rather than schools.) 
I think you got it right on target with reason A) however.  

Non Americans (especially British) should be aware that Americans mean
publically (government) funded when they say public schools and
privately funded (paid by the students family) when we say private
schools.

I think that PE could be made even more useful for Traveller referees 
and players if there was a section in it for using the supplement on 
one world in any melieu.

Right now, one of my PC\'s, a Baron from the planet Tureded in the 
Spinward Marches, is thinking of returning home and uniting his 
world.

I\'ll probably adapt PE to be used in that way--but I thought it would 
 be nice for the PE people on this list to come up with some rules 
for governing an entire planet INSIDE the Imperium, not empire build.

I\'d like to see rules for interaction with other planets, Imperial 
taxes as a strain on world economy, trade coalitions, etc,--every 
thing that it would take to run a world as a member of the Imperium.

This would make a nice later expansion for PE.  Maybe they could hook 
it in with the upcoming Nobles allowing for PC planetary leaders to 
become big wigs in the Imperial court--maybe even Emperor one day.

....just thinking ahead.

Yes, I tried that, but they are specific to vehicle type armors--not 
personal armor.  You\'ve got to make a lot of assumptions and do a lot 
of stretching to come up with personal armor numbers using that 
system.

Why can\'t IG just put in a few paragraphs somewhere in some 
supplement the AVs for the standard Traveller armor types we\'ve had 
since the game was established--Cloth, Combat Armor, etc?

The MT Armor types are pretty close to T4\'s, but they get a little 
stiff at the high end.  I mean, sheeeesh!  AV 18 for high tech Battle 
Dress?

Yet Mesh is AV2, just like in T4, and a Flak Jacket is AV3, just like 
the CSC description of Flex (describing it to be your standard 
ballistic cloth covering).

I guess I\'ll keep using MT AV\'s until I can find something better.  

It sure is keeping the PC\'s alive this way.

So, maybe I do qualify as a geek-boy gearhead, living in my own introverted
universe....but I don\'t think so, and even if I do, I resent being called
as much.  Personally, I divide my time between \'moronic anal-retentive
gearheadism\' and character/culture/prose description.

Let\'s face it, one of Traveller\'s main attractions has always been it\'s
technical side...that, plus the background are what (IMHO) what makes the
game so good...the gearheads can to their thing, the prose/culture freaks
can do theirs, and a great synergy results.  Traveller has appeal at both
ends of the spectrum, something that not many (if any) other games have.

If you don\'t like it, fine - you live in a free country, you can like what
you want...but you stepped over the line from constructive criticism into,
frankly, childish whining.  It\'s fine not to like the results of someone\'s
labour - it\'s quite another thing to insult them and dismiss them as
worthless because they don\'t share your (somewhat narrow) viewpoint.

That\'s my last word on the subject...flames will be pointedly ignored.

My *impression* in Traveller has never been of space being at a particular
premium.  Perhaps I\'m wrong but I\'ve kind of assumed that even if starships
don\'t have quite the space of the, say, Enterprise, they still have a fair
bit of room for those long weeks in jumpspace not to feel claustrophobic.

I\'m sure some will love that - others might loathe it.  I suspect
passengers will demand the choice.  Ship captains (or designers) will
provide it.

The only minor race with a separate write-up to that level of detail

The Vilani *do* have radically different aging rules.  I don\'t think

   In your humble opinion of course.  Look, if you insist on wasting
bandwidth on bullsh*t NEA propaganda, do it somewhere else.  Your

No smiley at the end of the sentence, OK, it\'s a serious question.  
It gets a serious answer:

I couldn\'t claim to have such a strong background in any of the 
above, but I do have some kind of overview of them.  (Also some 
courses in Earth Sciences, knew a couple of geologists, interested in 
Jung\'s psychology and historically literate.)

My take on these sciences in Traveller would be:


Geology

The study of the materials which make up a world.  This includes 
knowledge of rocks and minerals in a world\'s crust, an understanding 
of the formation and internal structure of worlds, and the ability to 
make deductions based upon geological information.  Geology is not 
limited to Earth-like planets, but is commonly applied to icy worlds 
and asteroid belts alike.

Learning of Geology is initially classroom based, with a strong 
practical component, but includes a large proportion of fieldwork.  A 
graduate of the University of Sylea (Geology-3) might expect to have 
experience of several mainworlds, at least one asteroid belt and 
perhaps one "unusual" world with severe vulcanism or a number of 
interesting minerals.

Analysis: (tasks as for Chemistry)

The analysis of rock samples shares many techniques with Chemistry, 
the difference being that Geology is more attuned to discovering the 
structure of naturally-occurring, predominantly inorganic compounds.

Geological analysis on the larger scale may be used to determine the 
fault lines between plates, likelhood of volcanic eruptions and the 
like, as well as more mundane applications such as determining 
geologically stable sites for waste disposal or mining.

Predictive use of Geology is complex, a typical task being to 
determine whether lanthanum ores may be present in a region, given 
the known rock structures and compositions.  A good Geologist is a 
must for any serious exploration team.

Equipment bonuses: +1 to +6; most rock samples are quite easily 
analysed, and complex problems require both expensive tools and 
considerable computer power.



Psychology

Psychology is the study of what motivates a sentient being at the 
personal level.  This includes social factors and sometimes also 
assumptions about "universal human nature"; the latter are somewhat 
contentious but often produce very accurate models of behaviour.

In an interstellar society, Psychology includes the ability to adapt 
to other people\'s way of thinking, despite cultural differences.

The practical uses of Psychology skill are many and varied.  Most 
tasks using Psychology will be Uncertain due to the subtleties of 
interpersonal communication.

Assess mood of crowd, Psychology + Int > Easy

Determine underlying attitude of official, Psychology + Int
 (uncertain)

Detect impostor or spy, Psychology + Soc or Int, Difficult, uncertain
 [maybe an opposed task vs. Disguise or Psych?]


Tasks are typically one level harder when applied to an alien culture 
(including some "exotic" human culures) and one level easier for a 
culture the psychologist knows well.  Resistance or evasion may make 
tasks harder (if undetected) and active cooperation will decrease the 
difficulty one level.



History

History deals with the actions of whole societies, in much the same 
way as Psychology deals with individual motivations.  While the study 
of history is focussed on past events, the skills of a historian can 
be applied to interpret or even predict events in the present day.

History skill reflects the ability of a character to find and 
understand the social and economic factors behind a situation, past 
or present, as well as a broad overview of history as a whole and 
detailed knowledge of one period or culture.


Example uses:

Assess local law/government level

Assess political situation

Determine likely source of local unrest (e.g. whether a new factory 
 is to blame for striking workers)

Recall historical analogy to present day

Manipulate government


Understanding societies in both personal and social aspects is 
difficult, and those with History-4+ and Psychology-4+ are known as 
Psycho-Historians.

(mostly from MT books). It\'s smaller than most escort class ships.

So what class to ship is it?

Also the Close Escort ship (in the Imperial Encyclopedia) is far smaller than
the Escort ships published for MegaTraveller.

There\'s probably some good reason for this.(I guess it\'s something to do with
the different design methods in CT and MT.) But I have always had trouble
coming up with a reason why the Kinunir is classed as a cruiser.

Israel won\'t accept EU immigration rules, for a start:  Moslem 
influence in Europe is increasing and if Turkey joined the EU for 
instance that would be a real barrier.  I can also see problems with 
defence, presence of certain other nations (British backed 
Palestinians in 1948, Germans somewhat tainted by WW2, many Austrians 
*still* anti-Semitic by all accounts, pogroms by Slavs, etc.)

Israel might well be a good candidate but I can\'t see it being other 
than militantly isolationist.

IMO it would be much better just to realize that the Traveller universe is
not identical to our universe and to simply stick to one timeline once it
is established. As far as I\'m concerned I don\'t mind gaming in a universe
where, say, computers didn\'t develop as explosively as they have done in
our universe in the past 20 years. Or, in casu, space exploration and
international cooperation developed much faster than it really did.

About seven years ago I started a time travel campaign based in the 27th
Century (loosely based on Simon Hawke\'s Time Wars books) and one thing I
did was to issue my players a timeline covering events from 1990 to 2610
(Cribbed from, among other things, T2300 and GURPS Terradyne). When I did
some more work on that timeline a couple of years ago, I added the entry:

1990	Game universe begins deviating from the real universe in a major
	way!

Let\'s do that with Traveller. Otherwise we\'ll have to keep revising the
timeline and the tech definitions as the real Earth develop in ways we
didn\'t anticipate (and I guarantee you that it will ;-).

A user of this skill would also be able to use nearby objects as 
weapons.

In my campaign I use Brawling because MT has no Martial Arts skill.
However, I\'m willing to introduce MA if it makes sense.

My question is this: what are the effects of having two different
skills for these abilities in combat? Is there a situation where
Brawling-2 is better or worse than MA-2?

I\'m speaking about Traveller tasks, not real life. As a practitioner
of Jiu-Jitsu, I\'m aware of the differences between a decent martial
arts ability and a decent bar fighting ability. These differences
don\'t seem to translate down to the Traveller combat rules in 
CT and MT. 

If someone can come up with the difference between Brawling and
Martial Arts as that difference applies to the combat rules, I\'d
appreciate it.

As a history graduate I\'d like to propose some amendments to the history
skill proffered by Nick, principally I\'d warn against combining history and
psychohistory skills in such a matter of fact way. The psychological
comparison of societies and individuals is a useful analogy that falls over
quite quickly when applied too earnestly.  I imagine that psychohistory (in
the sci fi/dune sense) requires knowledge much more in the domain of the
mass media specialist. The psychohistorical \'skills\' available to the
ordinary history graduate or postgraduate relate to the psychological
analysis of the motives of historical individuals, not to the manipulation
of countless billions of contemporaries. So I\'d remove that \'manipulate
government\' section.

I\'d define history as:

A body of knowledge concerned with the recording, study, and critical
analysis of past events through contemporaneous recorded testimony in
written, oral, and other forms. Characters may have specific knowledge of a
particular period, race, or society or they may have studied history
thematically, for instance concentrating on economics, politics, social
history, the history of science and technology etc.

 It seems, to me anyway, perfectly reasonable to have a skill like
 mechanic that covers all mechanical endeavours of all types, and if
 required then a familiarity for a specific TL, or range of TL\'s, could
 be tacked onto the skill (simply listing the TL\'s the mechanic is
 competent in).

First, I think that mandating a TL aspect of "Mechanic" or some such would
make the game more inaccessible with little gain otherwise. For game masters
who care to, they can impose such additional realism. In any case, most
people don\'t move between tech levels (real world that is). When they do
(immigrants move up; missionaries move down) we find there are universal
skill aspects, and TL dependent aspects. I think a lot of mechanics (for
example) are working at the edge of their competency and really have skill in
"Use of Ford diagnostic computers" rather than in "Mechanics"

Whoah ! What deep system probes have disappeared ?

We aren\'t causing current flow - to do that, we would displace only the
the charge carrying electrons in the field. Rather, we are displacing
everything, and so there is no net electrical potential.

It\'s the same explanation as FF&S1 and hence part of the alternative tech=
Traveller "pseudo-canon". There\'s no mention of anything in common between
Jump and Stutterwarp other than they are both FTL Drives !

I think I am repeating myself here, but Jump is travel through an alternative
space time called Jump Space, whereas Stutterwarp is analogous to electron
tunnelling on the macro scale. I don\'t see how the "rules" are the same.

True, to a point. Yes, Traveller does have artificial gravitational fields.
Yes, they do not require mass. However, nowhere does it imply that Jump Drives
are gravitic devices, merely that they are affected by gravitational fields.
And Stutterwarp is definately not a gravitic device - in 2300AD canon, there
is no science of gravitics, and stutterwarp drives exist quite happily. Since
TNE / FF&S1 lifted Stutterwarp from 2300AD, then I assume the same is true,
a view which is supported by FF&S1\'s description.

As for Grandfather\'s achievements, there is no reason to assume that the
TL 27+ "Bunch Of Grapes" in Adv 12 uses anything like the same technology as
a TL 15 Imperial Cruiser. It\'s like comparing an abacus with a modern PC - -
sure they both achieve similar results, but the PC is thousands of years
ahead of the abacus. Take another example - a TL 7 rocket gets to orbit
the hard way, while your TL 15 vessel uses Contragrav. Both get to orbit,
the method is different. Same with jump - The Bunch Of Grapes maybe uses pocket
universes and other uberscience, whilst the TL 15 Jump Drive uses
more primitive / conventional methods.

I was doubtful before. I am now completely sceptical. Grandfather may have
acheived myriads of wonders, but even he had limits. I don\'t buy that he
could produce enough energy to create a pocket universe with portals through
the entirety of the Milky Way, nor do I see how he could harness 
the _EXTREMELY_ powerful galactic black hole ...

> Not if my preceeding comments are held to be true.

And if they aren\'t ? Why do you need such high powered explanations to
commonplace things in the Traveller canon such as Jump ? You seem to
have caught White Wolf syndrome - you know, humans have never done
anything and the Cainites are behind every significant event in history.

Personally, I think that Grandfather and the other Ancients are overused,
or at least would be if this list had it\'s way. Everywhere I look there
are Ancient sites, relics, survivors, massive experiments etc. Every

The hydrogen bubble theory of Jump is something else that bothers me. I have
always thought that the vast amounts of hydrogen that were consumed by the
Jump Drive simply provided the energy that "punched" the ship into Jump Space,

I prefer the Ringworld explanation - that the suns in the core have gone
Nova, and the shockwave is moving towards us at lightspeed and will reach
us in 20000 years. May be the Zhodani are trying to ascertain if this is the
case.

True, a good handwave attempts to restore internal consistency. But turning
a blind eye to something like 2D maps is easier, and does not rely
on overusing the Traveller standard MacGuffin of Ancient Technology.

But Han Solo is from _STAR WARS_ canon, not Traveller. So the statement is
pretty much irrelevant - Traveller may draw on aspects of Star Wars, but it
is not the same. And in any case, we are not trying to explain away the
shortcomings of Star Wars science, but discuss the nature of Traveller\'s Jump
Drive et al.

Why bother?

I think that gravitic control would be something that would be kept
under central control of the captain and crew. It seems to me that it
would be a breach of security to allow passengers access to gravity
controls, even at a localized level.

Why waste power on manipulating bed gravity when space could be
conserved by simply having beds that fold down from the walls or recess
into the floor?

I\'m sure advances in materials and ergonomic design will allow future
travellers to sleep in comfort on a few centimeters of SleepWell(tm)

wall.

Geeze, we could make this *really* detailed if we wanted to.

Unarmed Combat (Cluster)
   Boxing - formalized fighting method using the hands to deliver blows
   Martial Art - one of many formalized fighting methods using hands,
       feet, holds and throws (This *could* be a cluster!)
   Wrestling - formalized fighting method using holds and throws   

Melee Combat (Cluster)
   Brawling - rough and tumble street fighting using clubs, stick,
       bottles, hands or anything else that is available
   Fencing - one of many formalized fighting methods using swords,
       including Cutlass, Saber, Rapier, Broadsword, etc. (Cluster?)
   Flexible - includes whips, ropes, flails, and other flexible weapons
       (Cluster?)
   Knife - any short one handed blade
   Spear - includes quarterstaff and rifle with or without bayonette
   
Comments:  Ok, it\'s too much detail..and not enough at the same time. Yes,
Martial Artists use weapons, sometimes, but that isn\'t usually their
primary training.  Most people look down their noses at Brawling as
"untrained", but if you have Brawling 4 then, by golly, you ARE trained and
should be more than a match for Mr. Karata 2...IMO.

Maybe we should simplify and cut down on the skill choices.  Just have
general groupings.  The effects of a Good Brawler and a Martial Artist are
the same after all...call the ONE unarmed combat skill Brawler, Martial
Artist, or even Unarmed Combat, and it can stand for *any* style of
hand-to-hand, mostly, unarmed combat technique.

At the same time, the space station in 2001 was based on *50s* designs.
I\'ve still got an old Lindberg Line model of a wheel type space station
kicking around in storage...

The difference between the 2001 station and things like "Freedom" is
that the 2001 version was built to be used as a multipurpose
*commercial* as well as scientific venture. Freedom is an excercise in
stupidity because they are trying *so* hard to "optimize" things that
they actually increase the costs needlessly (things like using a 2 kHz
power supplies instead of the "standard" 400 Hz used in aircraft. For a
savings of a few ounces per unit, they wind up requiring everything
that uses power to be custom built!)

I was thinking more along the lines of 7 or 8 hours, which *is* extreme

The thing is, there\'s *no* excuse for the entire Chig force to be
moving at speeds of only a few hundred km per *hour* relative to
Jupiter when they are heading for earth. Heck, at those speeds, they\'d
fall into the planet!

First off, Niven has a *major* goof with regards to superconductors.
They do *not* superconduct *heat*. So several things he has characters
do with them won\'t work.

As for power storage, a superconducting ring can store power. You have
a current flowing around the ring endlessly. Trouble is, this generates
a magnetic field. So there are four modes of failure for the ring:

1. the current reaches the current limit for the superconductor. At
   which point it quits superconducting and has a real, non-zero
   resistance. Given the current level, the ring will almost instantly
   explode into vapor from resistive heating. (ouch!)
2. The magnetic field reaches the field density limit for the
   superconductor. At which point the material quits superconducting,
   and events proceed as in #1.
3. The magnetic forces exert an outward pressure on the ring. At the
   point where the pressure exceeds the tensile strength of the ring
   material, it comes apart explosively.
4. if you place the ring inside some sort of reinforcing, to support it
   against the pressure, at some point the pressure will exceed the
   compressive strength of the ring material. It\'ll crack, the cracks
   will have resistance, and the ring explodes into vapor.

The current and magnetic field density limits on superconductors vary
with the material. Some are pretty good at handling high currents and
high field density. Tensile strength and compressive strengths are
pretty low (most superconductors are ceramic like materials). 

The energy density of a superconducting ring *might* be pretty high,
but it\'s limited by the factors I listed, and nobody really expects the
energy density to get really extreme.

I think that somewhere along the lines someone got their acronyms

drive had "Space" as part of the name, and isn\'t supposed to exist for

Why not? We still use wirewound resistors and paper dielectric
capacitors in some applications. We even use tubes sometimes.

And things like copper oxide rectifiers have been in use for over 100
years. So I figure that silicon based devices will hang on in some
niches. Even now its usually simpler to use 74xxx chips for interfacing
the cutting edge stuff than to build a custom chip for the job (at
least until you get into massive production runs).

I\'d not be surprised to find an 80x86 type chip inside the room
thermostat, for instance. :-)

Population pressure doesn\'t work as a reason for shipping people off.
You can\'t ship them as fast as they reproduce.

What population pressure *will* do, is get some "criminals" shipped
off, and get a lot of folks who can\'t take the pressure, but can manage
to scrape togther a stake to emigrate. But neither will affect the home
population noticeably. It just gives a "safety valve" for getting rid
of the discontented.

But the voltage drops along a log or exponential (I forget which) curve
as you discharge it. That\'s why I said that you\'d have to use a lower
voltage than the cap was charged to. You want one that\'s a ways below
the "knee" on the discharge curve. You then need to use something to
keep the output voltage of your "capacitor + gizmo" *at* the lower
voltage during the portion of the discharge when the capacitor voltage
is higher than your nominal output voltage.

This is a *much* messier situation than the discharge curve for a
battery cell.

Let\'s see... Neptune is about 30 AU out. That\'s about 4.5e9 km. or
2.25e9 to turnover if we assume constant acceleration. 28 days to
turnover is 2.4e6 seconds. Plug in the formulas and I get around
8/100ths of a gee. Boy, they really need those G tanks. :-)
(But it isn\'t *too* unreasonable for an ion drive!)

20% decompressed is just "high mountain" equivalent. 12 psi of air, and
around 3.6 psi of oxygen. Not a problem.

Now if it was decompressed *to* 20% (rather than *by* 20%) it\'s a
different story. 3 psi total, .9 psi oxygen results in rapid
unconciousness unless you were born in the Andes or Himalayas.

Well, I just ran some quick figures. If we assume that it is an 8 hour
trip to Jupiter (about 5 AU) then at constant acceleration, it\'s about
..36 g. Low, but not *that* low. 

And regardless of the gravity, you run into trouble at the point were
the pilot needs to defecate. Urination is handled by a "pilot tube",
but the other is rather more difficult to deal with.

Well, energy wise, a zero-g bed is *expensive*. It\'s equivalent to
hauling a person 1000 miles straight up against a 1 g field (or
boosting them to escape velocity). It also gets nasty if the person
slips out of the bed\'s "field", as they\'ll *regain* all that energy as
kinetic energy. Which results in an interesting display as they turn
into a meteor inside the confines of their bedroom.

On shipboard, for the same reasons that the ship\'s field doesn\'t extend
far, it\'s much cheaper to turn off the field (actually, since you need
to keep the inertial compensation, you really set it on "neutral").
But on planets, you have this *huge* gravity field to fight against.

IIRC Earth was packed with everything the Solomani could find. At that time, 
there were no TL15 Solomani troops.

With their vulnerability and lack of medtech, the Vilani might misinterpret 
accidental infection (eg from a POW with a cold) as a deliberate attack!

Agreed. There are people who play using the GURPS mechanics, or a variation of

So many probes have died between Earth and Mars that NASA jokes about the

Space to moce around in for work and entry/egress.  I\'m about 1.65m tall,
so folding myself into a 1.5m^3 space would be a bit cramped, and difficult
for me to work in.  I\'ve done it (the driver\'s space for a M-113A3 isn\'t
very big, but I know I suffered a bit in the task rolls.

Workstations and bridgeworkstations need to be much larger.  If you work in
a cubicle, measure it out, that\'s what your workstation and seat should be
considered as.

Sounds OK but PLEASE use some handier logscales:
1,1.5,2,3,5,7,10,15 etc
1,2,5,10,20,50,100 etc
1,3,10,30,100,300 etc
1,10,100,300 etc

When someone dreams up a table about the amount of freight a starport can
handle one do not have to come up with numbers like "781 250 tons" snd
such. Otherwise a good idea.

Also IMHO the singlke most important factor after starport class is population.

    'body' => 'In the recent past, Harold Hale has attempted to get a discussion going
on relativism.  He raises some points/issues about the use of "relativism"
in Traveller writings.  I suspect that he was largely biased by its use in
the MT heyday, and TNE to a lesser extent, but I\'ll let him explain that if
he desires.  I would just like to point out some things from my perspective
(relativistically :) and am interested in anything anyone else has to say.
I don\'t believe Harold has touched on it all, so I am firing off this thread.

Yes, things were written from a Vargr point of view, and we had we also had
the Vilani side of things, presented to us in _Vilani & Vargr_.  That is
sort of natural given the fact that the book\'s nature.  If I understand HH
correctly, where relativism fails in V&V (just _one_ example, there are
more) is in that there are not too many characters who are of either "V"
that are adventuring in those spheres--they are characters of those races
in the Third Imperium.

Also, when it comes down to players/referees reading the materials, the
subtle ambiguities are lost on we humans trying to understand the author\'s
intent.  With no clear definition stating "what is what", it is a rather
ambiguous interpretation to be made.

At the same time, I would argue that relativism is a fact of life, though
it may be done better, with explanations in future work.  In that extent,
I agree with Harold.  But, bear in mind that as our "fact of life" is with
us, there is a certain amount of reality that can (must?) be dealt with
that uses reasoning like:

   The Imperial Citizen in Milieu 0 is in some ways _vastly_ different
   from their counterpart in Milieu 1100 (M1100 for example only).
   After a thousand years of the normal evolution of a technological
   society, such a difference may be formed by seeing the difference
   between the humans of 20th century Earth as contrasted by the
   (relatively) primitive society of 50,000 years earlier--the larger
   margin of difference being that the latter end of the range overlaps
   into the beginning of the Technological Age.

   If the reader is concerned with a 52,000 year period being compared
   side by side to a 1,000 year period, the reader should consider how
   world public opinion on an issue can shift in very short periods of
   time, given sufficiently advanced technology.  An example is the
   period surrounding the Viet Nam War in the United States.  Consider
   the number of people who thought the War Protestors in the early
   periods of the War were traitors? (This author does not have the
   exact factual values, but suffice it to say that if it was not in
   the high ninety percentage spread of Americans, it was certainly a
   majority.)  After the War, the situation was very different.  Sure
   it is possible that some of the people on those college campuses
   later wrote the "history" in classic Chinese succeeding Dynastic
   fashion, but these _formerly_ traitorous protestors are now heralded
   as heroes (by some).  At the same time, some have gone on to suggest
   that Jimmy Carter did not get re-elected for his pardoning of those
   who fled the draft to Canada in the north.

   That is one example of how planetary commo can set an opinion, right
   or wrong, and change relativistically, a world view in a mere decade.
  
So, I see relativism as a reality.  You can put in general social trends,
politics, religion, and on any subject that people talk about.  If Traveller
uses relativism, then it is probably as good as the author\'s ability to
write about it.  I don\'t think that means that Traveller should abandon a
social gearheading device just because it causes confusion.  People confuse
people, not relativism.

(I am particualarly interested in Dr. Clark\'s response to this one, but I\'ll
certainly read others. :)

(My PPS below, inspired this next bit.)
As an aside, I am very telemobile.  Friends always ask me why I don\'t get an
ISP.  With two regular school accounts, and usu. another 3-4 class accounts,
I have plenty of internet access.  I am a practicing UNIX administrator, and
it pretty easy for me to keep on the net.  Presently, my two main accounts
are experiencing OS upgrades, so I am hopping from stone to stone, so to
speak.  Most people would just live with the 24-72 hour outage.  I respond
by rerouting as seamlessly as possible.  The problem is that since most people
just use the "reply" on their mailers, things get routed that I can\'t control.
Oh well, our tech is getting better. <G>

Anyway, this is how I view the Trav player characters that I referee.  Adding
a few tech levels can make common Traveller tech almost incomprehensible to
the average player.  That is my only stand against gearheading.  It is not
too terrible, but I wanted to say it before any of my comments get
misunderstood.


In my opinion,

    more importantly <G>, this relates to Traveller.

Interesting!  I recently got _Far & Away_ #1, featuring a couple of
relevant MT articles by J. Andrew Keith.  "Planetfall" discussed the
in\'s and outs of takeoff/landing/orbital docking from the ship crew\'s
perspective; "The Compleat Starport" tackled starport/spaceport
capabilities.  For comparison, here\'s the features from his contents
table:

  Orbital Port
  Naval Base
  Scout Base
  Extrality
  # Berths
  Traffic
  Starship Construction
  Spaceship Construction
  Naval Architect
  Refined fuel
  Unrefined fuel
  Search & Rescue
  Major Repairs
  Minor Repairs
  Superficial Repairs
  Overhaul
  Life Support Supplies
  Lodging
  Entertainment
  Brokerage
  Warehousing
  Security
  Berthing Costs
  Shuttle Service
  Transport Terminal
  TAS

I like your use of port size, but I also like the way M. Keith\'s article
allows for port "specialisation" (e.g., passenger ports and freight
ports; comfortable and expensive ports vs. cheap \'n\' cheerful).  Perhaps
a choice/die roll based on size for each facility?  For instance, using
size + (2D-7)/2 would allow a size 5 port to have 0-64 orbital ports;
handle 30-326 passengers and 50-31,250t freight; supply 25-15,625t of
fuel and 0-32 shuttles.

I don\'t think individual downports should have lots of orbital ports,
btw - so I\'d regard the o.p. number purely as a tonnage indicator.  Is
this what you intended, or did you mean them as individual orbital
ports?

>How should world populations factor in?

I\'ll think some more about this whole issue when I have time, and let
you know.

Why waste paper printing out those darned hardcopies... we\'ve screens to
read them on.

No seriously - I know that anology fails a thousand times over, but one of
the key "features" of the background of Traveller, especially T4, is that
power is cheap. Amazingly cheap. Blindingly wasteful, conspicious
consumption cheap. It\'d sell, just cause it\'s cool...

that is, until someone said it causes cancer.

Agreed. In hand-to-hand combat, usually the first really good hit 
determines the winner. Definitely a guy who\'s been street-fighting for
10 years will kick the crap out of a junior belt martial arts guy.

This is what I was thinking too. I like the name "Unarmed Combat"; it
certainly fits better than Brawling if you include martial arts
in it.

Please, just follow your own advice and quit.  You have insulted a
number of people on this list.  You have failed to listen to their
responses while accusing them of doing the same (listening does not mean
you have to agree with them, but it *does* mean you have to pay proper
attention to the content).  You have continued to use a highly
inflammatory tone - once, I will forgive.  Twice, I can ignore.  Three
times, and you have induced me to flame someone for the first time ever.

I would like to thank the gearheads of this list for their restraint to
date in the face of extreme provocation.

Disclaimer:  I am not a gearhead, nor do I play one in T4.
I will not be buying FFS2 for the same reason I didn\'t get FFS1 -
designing hardware at that level doesn\'t interest me.  However, I\'m
pleased it exists for those who enjoy such things.

Apologies to the rest of the list for the rant.  I actually agree with
some of Jay\'s other complaints - but no way am I going to speak up in
support of them right now.

	I would. A chip in a control panel would only be part of a system.
Eventually this would need replacing, say, the wiring, connections, etc...
and the heaters could wear out thus precipitating renewal of the whole
system anyway. Most rubbish you buy these days doesn\'t last five minutes,
how is any of it supposed to last 100 years!

	As for silicon, I thought scientists had been working on other compounds
to be used as processor bases for years. A long time ago I heard of a
substance called gallium arsenide, that is supposed to speed up the
electron flow, or offer less resistance to it, or something like that.

	Something else I once read about was that instead of the processor having
a printed electrical circuit, all circuits would in fact be made up of
millions of tiny laser beams, with light emitters and receivers to act as
the connections. The advantage of this would be that as light travels much
faster than electricity - about twice as fast I believe - the beams could
cross each other without interfering with each other, thus ruling out the
possibility of a short circuit and enabling all circuit paths to take a
more direct route, speeding up processing time even more.

	This would enable a completely different processor architecture to be
used. It would be very different from a 80x86 type processor.

	If we\'re talking about these things now, then silicon chips will be almost
unheard of as one approaches the 22nd century. Silicon chips then will be
as dead as something that is very dead indeed.

	See ya...

Chimera Missile Boat

During the time after recontact with the Hivers, the Aubaini government
put a major effort into building system defenses in case of a Vampire
attack.  This effort continued into 1200, and ended with the founding
of the Reformation Coalition.  The RC needed more jump capable ships,
both military and exploratory.  The Aubaine governmet put off building
more system defense boats for itself, but it still builds SDBs for
other governments in the Coalition, who have no defenses against attack. 

During the period from 1194 to 1200, 5 Chimera Missile Defense Boats
were built, they all serve in the Aubaine navy, patrolling the system. 
The Chimera is primarily designed to protect a crucial world in the
system, either a gas giant, or the main world itself.  While patrolling
a gas giant, the Chimera is designed to hide deep in the gas giant.  To
counter the tremendous pressures of the gas giant, the hull is stressed
to 10Gs. When at these depths, the ship will be out of communcation
range, due to the opacity of the atmosphere. It is thought that the
ship will only enter extreme depths after expending its missile
capacity, or repairing battle damage.   This also protects the boat
when it is hiding in a world\'s ocean.  Other less expensive ships, such
as Dragon, Griffen, Manticore or Medusa SDBs patrol higher regions of
the gas giant, and its moons.  These ships and automated sensor buoys
act as lookouts for enemy ships.  Once an enemy ship is spotted, a
judgment is made whether it is a significant threa

The ship only accelerates at 1G, most of the time the ship will by
lying in wait for enemy ships.  Extra acceleration would allow the ship
to evade enemy fire, but it was thought extra fire power was a better use of space.
If the ship is forced to enter extreme depths, where its 1G
acceleration may not be able to get it out, its fuel tanks have been
specially modified to be configurable as ballast tanks, allowing the
ship to come out of extreme depths.  This also allows the ship to save
itself if it suffers a manuver drive hit, and it is slowly falling into
the gas giant.  The ship only 36 G-turns or refined fuel, but it can
fill its entire fuel tank in under 9 minutes. As it will normally be
operating in a gas giant, scooping up additional fuel while on the run,
should be no problem.  In an emergency, unrefined fuel can be used in a
HEPlaR system.  

The Aubaine Navy tends not to station ships in the oceans of Aubaine,
because the noise of the HEPlaR jets, disrupts Schalli communication. 
In extreme need the ships are authorized to venture into the oceans. 
In case this does happens, the ships have a cargo hatch on the floor of
the main cargo bay, this will allow the ship to take on cargo while
under water. Once the door is opened, air pressure will keep the water
from coming in, will act as a bathescape. The cargo bay also can be
pressurized independently of the rest of the ship, this allows Schalli
to enter and exit the cargo bay, without suffering decompression effects.

This seems low; 8 hours at 0.36 G (one-way, not turn-around) is 
(0.5 * 0.36 * 10 * (8*3600)^2 = 1.5x10^10m = about a tenth of an AU.

There\'s no particular evidence that Traveller grav technology works this
way (or that any grav tech would have to.) There\'s lots of ways to get
into "zero-G" without getting to escape velocity. For example, step out a
second-story window and you\'re in free fall, albeit briefly, without much
energy cost. A zero-G bed just has to be a region of locally flat spacetime
which (while currently impossible) shouldn\'t particularly require any extra
energy. (Moving an object within the field shoudl require energy due to 
conservation of energy - the field has to provide the energy the object will
regain when it exits the field - but those are small numbers.)

Which probably isn\'t true. The invasion of Earth was the single most important
ground battle the Imperium had to fight during the war - and one they nearly
lost; if the Imperium had TL15 troops available in significant quantities they
would have deployed them. (If invading the enemy capitol - especially one 
charged with emotional symbolism - isn\'t what you\'re saving your first-line
troops for, what *are* you saving them for?)

In the Solomani case, they didn\'t expect to
deliberately abandon Earth; and they\'re unlikely to have sufficient transport
available after losing whatever naval battle it was to evacuate their troops
(the TL-15 ones you suggest) from Earth - especially since they would have had
to evacuate all the native Terran ones as well as whatever mobile forces
they had. It\'s certainly normal assumption that planetary forces are the
same TL as the world as a whole (see FFW), and pretty clear that the 
Solomani are unlikely to have had enough transport to move all the earth-TL
troops off of Earth. It\'s very clear from looking at both games that the
Solomani are intended to be TL13 or 14, no higher - Leroy\'s case is much
weaker even than his arguments about the Rule of Man.

(Does anyone with access to Supplement 10 remember if there were any TL-15
worlds on the Solomani side of the border even in 1107?)

No one is saying the things last a 100 years, but contol systems built
using time proven designs will be CHEAP, that\'s REAL CHEAP, folks, to
implement. No one designs a thermostat with a cutting edge RISC chip, just
\'cause 6800 chips are obsolete as personal computer CPU (no I didnt
leave off the last 0, I think Moto still makes \'em)

If anything, the fact that stuff doesn\'t last very long tends to make the
subsystems cheap and similar in construction, since they\'re designed to be
replaced.

GaAs chips are used now, for a number of high frequency applications, but
they\'re more expensive to make, and why do it, just because you can?
Silicon IC\'s are sheap, well known in their behavior, and for most
applications, plenty fast enough for what they do. Again, you don\'t need a
GaAs superfast RISC chip to run a thermostat.

Well, it\'s not that light travels so much faster than electricity, but the
frequency is such that you can make _much_ faster switches, if you have
the basic component design down.

Absolutely, this is why _computers_ in Traveller are much more powerful
than they are today. But, to belabor a point, that has nothing to do with
embedded controllers...

Why? Silicon replaced vaccuum tubes for some very important reasons: they
run on much lower power, they are much more rugged, they are enormously
smaller, and they\'re really cheap to make. New circuit paradigms, such as
optical circuits, will make the processors faster, but not much smaller
(we\'re already running into quantum tunneling effects in some chip
designs), not much lower power (unless they find a better way to make
led\'s) and not much more rugged than silicon. So I don\'t think silicon\'s
going to go away, unless there are really, really unexpected ways to
fabricate and use these new circuits.

Leonard, you\'re right, but I don\'t think you\'ve actually _seen_ how really
amazingly mindbogglingly knock-your-socks-off _cheap_ energy is in T4 with
the advent of Fusion+. I don\'t remember if you are in the FFS2 beta gang,
but a minimum size TL-12 Fusion+ plant is only 0.01 m^3, costs 1000 Cr and
puts out 48 KILOWATTS of power continuously. The thing weighs 20 kg, and
occupies a cube 10 _cm_ on a side.

Remember the old aviation engineers claiming they could get a brick
sh*thouse to fly, all they needed was the power?

Gee, but *your* numbers look TOO high. Let me see...it looks like 1.493mk
to me. Isn\'t that more like a hundredth of an AU?

One reason that everyone what holding their breath on Sojourner\'s Mars

No signal, no sign, nothing.

This, of course, is just how I see them. (my standard non-c disclamer ;-)

Broker is the skill of getting the best price when buying or selling a
cargo, ie. "bargaining", "neogotiating", cutting a deal. Trader is the
skill of picking the best cargo to buy and determining the best place to
take it for sale.  

I think there\'s a need for both.  Some people might be very good at finding
a cargo..Good Trader, but poor at getting a good deal on that cargo...Poor
Broker. Or you might have somebody who is terrible at figuring out where a
good place would be to sell something...Terrible Trader, but great at
getting the best possible price...Great Broker. See, the difference?

The key to making the most profit would be to have a Great Trader team up
with a Great Broker. The Trader finds the cargos and decides where the ship
will fly next to sell them. The Broker negotiates the purchase and sale of
the cargos. And the team gets rich. ;-> 

Does that make sense?

The only problem here is that most folks drive cars on a regular basis. 
The workstation in a car is the driver\'s seat.  This workstation has an
area of at most 1.5 m^3 in many cars, and I\'ve never seen a modern car
with more than 2 m^3.  Given that an air-raft has been defined as gravitic
car, why should their workstations be larger.  Certainly, there are no
automobiles (excluding trucks and buses) on the market with a driver\'s seat
which has 2.5 m^3 of room. 

Sure, for vehicles folks are planning to work long-term in, like
spaceships, workstation should be larger.  3.5 m^3 is a good minimum, and
7 m^3 seems more likely.  But I\'m not talking about starships or
submarines, I\'m talking about grav vehicles, commercial automobiles and
all the other short-term use vehicles which have much less space available
in the real world.  I think some errata would be useful on that one. 
 
I\'d say for both crewstations and seats, 1.5 m^3 is normal and 
2.5 m^3 is roomy for ordinary short-term use vehicle seats.

[ex-cellent review of "Event Horizon" snipped]

Don\'t hold back, Kenji, tell us what you *really* feel :)

Everyone knows that making a horror movie is a gamble.  The same goes
for science fiction.  Everyone is afraid to dump money in such a
product because the viewing audience is generally narrower than for a
movie that is a bit closer to home (unless it is pure "eye candy" like
ID4).

Combining the two genres was a very brave attempt indeed.  It is too
bad that they couldn\'t get decent writers for the movie.  When a movie
like "Event Horizon" gets bad reviews-- and it *is* getting bad
reviews-- it just makes it that much harder for the next guy that
comes along that wants to make a SF, horror, or SF/horror movie.



Just a few more points before I go:

Why were the crew breathing normal air/oxygen while immersed in their
fluid-filled grav tanks?  The supposedly 30G of acceleration (from an
ion drive!?!) would have made breathing gas a whee bit difficult.

Why does the pilot continue to move the Lewis and Clark forward
(blind) inside Neptune\'s atmosphere when ranging information clearly
puts them on a collision course with the Event Horizon?  Lucky thing
they used reverse thrust when they did, eh?

Why does the "gravity drive room" have big spikey bits that could
easily impale you, yet nobody actually gets impaled?  These writers
gotta learn to work with the props department.

Why bother trying to explain something like the "gravity drive" at
all?  The explanation was worse than NOT knowing!  If the drive
generates gravity to bend space, why is Neptune and the ship itself
not effected (all right... there was *some* atmospheric distortion in
Neptune\'s atmosphere).  The "Event Horizon" should have been in orbit
around Uranus... at least we would have had some butt-hole jokes.

Search & Rescue in the year 2047?  Exactly how many civilian or
commercial space vessels are flying around out there 50 years from
now?  Why is a "search & rescue" ship named after a team of
*explorers*?

When the first crew goes mad, why do they all pose for the bridge
cameras while performing their various atrocities?

Why didn\'t someone clean up all that guck off the bridge walls?

Why was there a 30-second audible countdown to begin depressurization
inside the airlock if there was no way of overriding it?  Pretty
annoying (kind of like Chrysler\'s "your door is ajar"-- taken to the
extreme).

With all the ship\'s power available during the movie ("gravity drive",
artificial gravity, 30G ion drives) why can\'t somebody rig up a few
more lights so that everything isn\'t so damn dark (especially in
sickbay)?  How the hell do you perform maintenance or repairs with a 1
Watt light bulb?

Why does a mile-long ship-- "with 15 foot high ceilings"-- suffer
toxic CO2 levels after being inhabited by a crew of eight after only a
few hours?

Exactly how much air (ie: reaction mass) can exist inside a vacc suit
to bring "Mr. Jet-Propelled_Wonder" back after being blasted away from
an exploding vessel?  Why would you design a vacc suit with this kind
of feature anyways?

Then we agree--it is just a matter of whether or not there were TL15 troops
_before_.

Using the same MT source that says RoM was only TL12, the Imperium was TL15
at this time.  Remember also, that Terra (and the Solomani Sphere) were part
of the Imperium up until the Solomani Confederation was founded in 871.  It
is very clear from descriptions that the Imperium and Solomani Autonomous
Region were still close up to this time, yet it still took another century
plus to do something about this "rimward rebellion."

Now if you are telling me that a bunch of Terrans at TL14 can take on the
Third Imperium at one entire tech level disadvantage--well let\'s just say
that is like the Terrans in their 4900 ton ships taking on 74,900 ton Vilani
ships. (In fact, I would venture a guess that the Vilani would need only
one ship!)  Remember, I just reread the entire Invasion: Earth game, so this
is not IIRC going on here.

BTW, the Vilani even without Meson Guns, just relying upon PA Spinal Mounts
would have to be more moronic than Pakleds to loose to the Terrans, not to
even think about culturally stagnant.

Sorry, but it is clear to me, that Terra was TL15+ at the outset of the
Solomani Rim War, c. 998.

I do thank you for continuing the spirited discussion.  If you want to do
some more CT browsing, reread the piece on the Solomani Movement/Cause in
Alien Module 6: Solomani.

When designed, the Kinunir was the largest Traveller ship ever published. 
The Type-C cruiser was 800 tons (hitherto the largest ship designed). 
Remember that the Kinunir was first published in Adventure 1, back before
High Guard and Mercenary (the first rules expansions).  Likewise with the
Gazelle close escort (JTAS 4): the PA barbettes were a new weapon, and very
scary (a single Gazelle could beat 2-3 corsairs in Mayday-style combat).

As the game system evolved ships got larger, but the older designs\'
designations weren\'t changed.  (Well, the Kinunir went from being a Battle
Cruiser to a Colonial Cruiser.)


In one of the TNE novels, a character notes that the Kinunir was useless as a
warchip, but great at threatening relatively defenseless planets from orbit.

If so, the two skills should have associated tasks. Now, Broker skill
is already covered in the rules regarding Trade and Commerce.

Trader skill, OTOH, by this definition needs a task along the lines
of:

	To find cargo to buy speculatively:
	Routine, Trader, Admin or Strtwse, 14 hrs (safe, unskilled OK).

Now, what happens when this task fails? The person doesn\'t find 
cargo? Introducing this task sure means there will be less cargo to
be had!

yet, that was some one elses design that I didn\'t modify. As for the rest

The straight dope on cruisers from CT\'s "Supplement 9: Fighting Ships":

"Cruisers:  Cruisers are the smallest ships to carry the large spinal weapons
needed to cause serious damage to a large armored ship, although most are too
lightly armored to stand in the line of battle.  They form the cadre of
commerce raiding task forces and provide fire support for planetary
invasions.  Sizes range from 20,000 to 100,000 tons. <there\'s more but I
digress, this is the meat of the entry>"

>So what class to ship is it?

The straight dope on the Kinunir class is also from "Supplement 9":

"The Kinunir class colonial cruiser (also known by a variety of designations:
vanguard cruiser, battlecruiser, and vanguard escort) is not a true cruiser,
being more properly termed an escort. <again, there\'s more, but I left it out
for bandwidth>"

>Also the Close Escort ship (in the Imperial Encyclopedia) is far smaller than
>the Escort ships published for MegaTraveller.

The "Fighting Ships" entry on escorts says that "escorts are small ships of
up to 5,000 tons".  In addition, the FS entry on the close escort says:
"Hundreds of Gazelle class close escorts have been built and many remain in
service with the Imperial Navy, despite the fact that in a combat situation,
they are nearly worthless.  The close escort, even when new, was not intended
to stand up to combat vessels; rather it was envisioned as an anti-piracy and
revenue patrol ship.  In that role, it has performed well, but when pressed
into combat duties it has invariably suffered disproportionate losses".

Um...  So there you have it.  I guess that answers some of your questions,
sort of?  When the Kinunir adventure came out, Traveller was still extremely
young.  There weren\'t a ton of ships to measure the Kinunir against, so it
was made into a "colonial cruiser".  The Traveller vision of ships was
probably much smaller back then.  Later, as the universe expanded, ships got
bigger.  The inconsistency has been there ever since...

These are  points in a two body gravity system where stability results. 
There are five classical points- L4 and L5 forward of and trailing the
"moon" in the Earth planetary system, and L1, L2 and L3 at other
places.  L4 and L5 are positivly stable- if you place an object there
then move it away it will tend to fall back into position.

L1, L2, and L3 are only about neutrally stable.  An object will stay
until you displace it a bit, then it will drift.  

A little real evidence for the existence of these points are Jupiter\'s
so called "Trojan points", trailing and preceding the orbit of Jupiter
around the sun by 60 degrees.  There be rocks there.  60 degrees at
Jupiter\'s orbit is a lot of space, which is why it was silly to see
Jupiter from its Trojan in S:AAB.

Note that Earth Moon Sun is three body.  And Mars, Jupiter Saturn etc.
The real math is tres complique with more than about two bodies(little

Right. I deserved that. Munchkin Powergamer (UPP FFFFFF) is hyperbole used
by posters to illustrate some particular design issue or play style, and
not a real character that we have in our games (or would allow). I, and
others, are guilty of using him as the reductio ad absurdum against rules
or play styles which we disagree with.

However, the fact that Mr. Powergamer doesn\'t really exist does not
invalidate arguments that use him to make a point. The point I was trying
to make is the imbalance between characters with widely different
characteristics.

Now, I know in real life characters having the same skill can have widely
different target numbers. The trouble starts when players roll these
imbalanced characters. For every AAAAAA (or 7B7777, which happens a lot
more often than 1 in 2 billion tries) somebody rolls, someone else rolls a
444444 (or 737777). The way the task system works, the first character is a
superstar who regularly succeeds Impossible task rolls, while the second
character is hard pressed to succeed an Average one. These characters are
not balanced. Since character generation gives everyone the same chance to
boost charactersitics, this imbalance gets preserved in the game. Now in an
ideal game the players would happily contribute whatever their characters
are able to without worrying about what other players contribute. In the
real world, however, most players who roll shmucks sit fuming while those
who got lucky rolls in chargen just beat them in everything. I almost had a
player quit my campaign because of this.

Another problem is, if players can choose which skill table to roll
against, the tendency to roll disproportionately on the physical and mental
development tables in an attempt to maximize their characteristics. Now
some posters have called this "abusive", but is it any more abusive than
minimaxing their weapon dice or cargo capacity to gain the greatest
relative advantage? Even supposing it is, isn\'t it better to have the rules
thwart this kind of munchkinism rather that relying on the referee to
handle it on an ad hoc basis? And for those players who rolled poor
characteristics, I think there should be some way for them to make up their
initial handicap.

I do not have the T4.1 chargen rules. My post was a sincere (if perhaps ill
phrased) question as to whether the T4.1 rules dealt with what I felt were
problems in T4 chargen. It was not a dig against Marc, who in my opinion
has gone beyond the call of duty in soliciting feedback on Traveller.

This time, instead of complaints, here some suggestions I think would
address the imbalance I see in character generation:

* Change the task system so skills have a more significant role in success.
I know there was a big flamefest about this, and that it isn\'t going to
happen in T4.1, but it made a difference in my campaign and still think it
is useful to mention as an optional rule.

* Use troupe-style roleplaying, where each player gets to run several
characters (including GM characters). I am trying this in my campaign, and
it makes a huge improvement. Not only does everyone get a chance to play a
superstar (and a shmuck), but it gives me and the players a lot more
freedom. Players can choose what character they will bring into each
encounter and don\'t get as upset when their character dies. I can run
adventures where different things are happening at the same time and don\'t
have to rationalize why everything always happens to the same 4 guys. After
trying this I wouldn\'t go back to one character per player.

* Make characteristic increases harder for higher characteristics. This
would allow low-rolling characters to improve themselves without letting
the high-rollers turn themselves into demigods.

* Add some bad results to the physical and mental development tables to
provide a little negative reinforcement to rolling on them. For example, I
have never had a player roll on the T4 Scholar Physical development table.
The power gamers quiver in fear when they see that "-1 Dex" on the table.

* Add some more skills. The decision point for minimaxers whether to roll
on the development table or a skill table is whether they have enough level
1 skills or not. By having a finer granularity of skills Mr. Powergamer
will have to spend more rolls getting the skills he wants. Actually, the
existing skill tables aren\'t bad for this; there are a lot of different
combat skills needed to become a battle studmuffin. Marc was wise to
eliminate Combat Rifleman skill. I just wish there was a better selection
of science and technician skills. However, the mental development tables
aren\'t as generous so this isn\'t as much as a problem, and it seems to me
the power gamers aren\'t as interested in science skills... strange.

* Use a points-based chargen system where players all get the same amount
of points to allocate to characteristics instead of rolling 2D6. Even if
you do this you will probably have to do something to the physical and
mental tables. Personally, I find these systems too complicated but they
are popular.

I think any one of these ideas would improve the imbalance I found in T4
chargen. I don\'t know how applicable they are to T4.1 because, again, I
don\'t have the rules.

Oh, come on, now!  Chairman Bill is on TV all the time -- and they
broadcast that simpering purple demon-lizard from the Jurassic during peak
viewing hours for small children!!!  You really expect me to believe they
were afraid of an X rating?

BTW, what does it mean that the filmmakers spared us no sight of blood,
shattered bones, exploding frozen corpses, gouged-out eyesockets, fresh hot
entrails, frisky maggots=81 and burn tissue, but took care that the luscious
centerfold model (used by the Mad Scientist to illustrate his somewhat

R-rated nudity was a Clockwork Orangian shot of some bruised and
waterlogged satanic hallucination?  What sort of message is this sending
the young generation of gearheads? <G>.

I\'ll tell you what:  the entire movie\'s a bit of Vilani cultural
propaganda.  Blatant allegory.  Solitary megalomaniac scientist neglects
social bonds (wife kills herself), then constructs a huge expensive
spaceship using totally untested technology based on principles he admits
he doesn\'t understand; the testing of this new technology -- during which
he refuses to cooperate with his teammates -- nets out with the destruction
of two spaceships and their crews, and "opens up a gateway into a dimension
of total chaos and evil" (sic.!)  Was this film written by Vilani patent
lawyers, or what?

In fact, we should re-evaluate *all* those luddite-flavored novels and
films for signs of Vilani tampering!  I think it must have started in the
early 1800s; the Vilani were concerned about the spread of
industrialization and a global econmic system, and so created the Romantic
movement... Mary Shelley was clearly an alien spy.  Tuberculosis became
fashionable because all the highly-placed Vilani infiltrators were coming
down with it.  In a broader view, the Taipings were all too obviously an
experiment in social engineering that went awry.  Queen Victoria, given her
suspiciously long life, had probably been abducted and replaced by a Vilani
plant...

Because modern scientific evidence has shown that zero gravity for 24
hours a day is unhealthy.  I think that it is quite possible that zero
gravity for 8 hours a day is also unhealthy.  In the abscence of real
world data indicating otherwise I do not see any reason to assume that
zero gravity beds will catch on as I think it is likely they will be
unhealthy.

On the other hand this is a great advertising blurb and it is almost
worth assuming zero gravity beds to have this set up.  I am not
technologically conservative in general, I think that in the future
people will do some everyday things vastly differently than we do today.

However - I do not think that being in zero gravity unnecessarily is
medically prudent.  Having the beds pop into the ceiling saves space
(usefull) but does not require zero gravity sleeping (unhealthy till
proven otherwise).

And indeed they may well be. In my campaign, all Travellers are taking
"space drug" as a matter of course (it\'s included as a supplement in their
food) to ward off the effects of zero-g, jump space, motion sickness, and
a myriad of other space-occupational hazards, kind of like we consume
a variety of additives in our food and water without thinking of them, like 
fluoride, vitamin enrichments, and the thought-control drugs dumped in
our reservoirs by the black U.N. helicopters :) Not Canon, of course, but
how I do it.

I\'d be interested in knowing if anyone has done any work on this...maybe
using floatation tanks? I know there was a study I saw on the Discovery
Channel where a group of volunteers spent a long time (a month or more)
lying in floatation tanks and developed much the same problems as astro-
nauts do after similar periods in zero-g; I wonder if they\'ve examined the
effects of shorter, daily periods? Anyone know, or can guess where to
start looking?

This I\'ve been curious about as well, but for some reason the space 
agencies have been strangely silent. If they\'d just give the public some
hard info on this, we might see a Renaissance in interest in space travel :)
I wouldn\'t think it should be too terribly different from certain activities
being performed in water; it would have its advantages and disadvan-
tages, just like doing it with gravity.

Perfectly valid, I just stated how things are done on *my* ships as a 
general rule. YMMV, as in the next post about the subject:

I agree with the points you make, it\'s just my personal feeling that the
majority of the people would prefer it; I\'ve read where several astro-
nauts described it as the most peaceful sleep they\'ve ever known. I\'m
very much a protege of Louis Wu, in that a) I\'ve taken a vow never to
die :) and b) would be so used to gravless sleep plates that I would 
have a difficult time sleeping in gravity

And my impression of *most* of the ship designs I\'ve seen (and made) is
that extra crew space gets eaten up in the desire to squeeze as much 
cargo space and as many small staterooms as possible into a ship to 
maximize the profit. I think this would rest just as heavy on the mind of
any ship\'s captain, given the rather *low* rates that cargo and passenger
service allow under the Imperium, at least. :)

Of course--give the people what they want is the first rule of business.
Make the people think they want what you have to give is the second
rule. :) And with that in mind:

Voila, a mass produced g-bed for less weight than the typical water

actually needed, but it\'s late and I\'m too tired to do so right now :)
This was fun enough, that I think I\'ll do a regular catalog of the beds
and put it up on the Pan-Imperia page; think of them as just the thing
after a hard day\'s sub-orbital pogoing :)

And this is just with CSC, I can\'t wait to get my hands on FFS2!

Thanks, I had not recalled the scenarios as a possible source.  I\'ll go
back to that one.

BTW, I haven\'t denied that the AHLs were TL14.  As for the other stuff,
it could be Ministry of DisInformation working again. <G>

The original source quote was rather vague (see my post on it), so I\'m
not surprised I missed it.  The more telling is the Invasion: Earth info,
along with the other stuff that should be coming along in my last post.

Well, for the same reasons, if the Imperium _was_ TL15, wouldn\'t they be
using their TL15 troops.  We could throw out the TL tables of the Imperia
in the much heralded MT Ref\'s Companion, but that would at the same time,
eject the only direct quote for a TL12 RoM.

See last comment directly above.

Also, Invasion: Earth tells of the _massive_ strike by the Solomani against
the Third Imperium\'s front.  I can see the possibility that Solomani TL15
reserves would be held back, but why not use them if you are making a
gamble.  Yes, it is a gamble.  There are myriads of possibilities, and more
than one _could_ make sense.  (Note the German strategy in WWI. And yes,
they did lose the war. [Sorry about that to my friends and possible relatives
out there on this list.])


>(Does anyone with access to Supplement 10 remember if there were any TL-15
>worlds on the Solomani side of the border even in 1107?)


None whatsoever.  They were all TL14 max.  One world over the border in
Aldebaran sector, adjacent to the Near Bootes cluster was TL15.  That was
in GDW\'s newsletter "Imperial Lines" #2.

Remember, I\'m trying to make sense of the _whole_ published volume of
record.  Admittedly a not too simple task.

For the record, Inv: Earth gives _both_ sides TL14 troops counters.  The
Imperial forces are broken down as to Regulars, Colonials, etc., but no
such distinction is made for the Solomani counters.  (Exactly why I
stated that the claim that Earth was TL13 was, well, an exaggeration.)

As for RoM TL, the little bit of text devoted to TL period in the game
just kind of dances around what TL is, only to really say that TL 12- is
in one category, and TL13+ is in another (for combat purposes).  That is
why I can see TL15 being a possible explanation for the Solomani.

S&A states clearly that the max Solomani TL is 15, an "adjustment" from
CT days.  We also need to factor that in for evaluating CT sources, if
we are going to be precise about this.

As an analysis/strategy point, in response to a my "case being weaker",
I only focused on the Inv: Earth game, since that is the only post-RoM
published source of Terra\'s TL until 1107/1110.  I:E reinforces the
quote of 1107 Terra\'s TL being 15, which is about as far as they wanted
to get specific on the subject.

You are right that a strictly CT view of things could suggest that Terra
reached and maintained TL14 until the Imperial TL programs raised it to
15 in the post-War era, not that the Imperium would necessarily want to
rebuild Earth with improvements after the "hell" the Solomani put them
through.

	Actually, I\'ve read some hard info on this from some aviation
magazine years back. It would appear the Russians tried this in the
mid-80s, and turned out to be a disaster. The body movements put the
participants in a spinning motion; I understand the joyful moment
was interrupted by breaking a wrist in addition to bruises and other
painful things. :)

	The Russians then designed a cradle with handholds and straps so 
that two people could have sex in space. Not out of friendlines to 
the lonely cosmonauts, but because the Russian space administration 
had been told to experiment on zero-G breeding and childbirth. I 
assume the experiment failed.

	In a related story (not sure if it\'s true), in the late 70s there
was a bit of a problem with the cosmonauts\' libido. Out of touch
with sexual contact, one astronaut managed to short-circuit some
electronic systems by masturbating. The by-products scattered in
zero-G and wandered among the sensitive electronics, with
predictable results. From then on, Russian astronauts have been 
provided with condoms.

Description: 
"EmJ Motors is proud to introduce our new Rover Sport/Utility Vehicle. The
Rover is a compact two-person contragrav car ideal for exploring the
backwoods or cruising down to the corner convenience market."

The Rover has proven to be very popular with the grav car buying public.
It\'s small size allows it to get close to the ground and still be able to
maneuver around obstacles that larger vehicles would never be able to
traverse.

The Rover has become very popular among police forces on planets with
extensive wilderness and who have no need for heavy armed craft. The Rover
is also popular among prospectors, hunters, scouts, and others who
appreciate its rugged construction and reliable performance. The Rover will
fit in nearly any starship\'s cargo bay.

The Rover is often used as a light recon vehicle by various armed forces,
this variant usually has some form of squad support weapon mounted on the
multi-use mount, fired by the passenger. Another popular variant is the
hunter\'s special, which comes with either a tranq rifle or net gun mounted
on the multi-use mount.

This vehicle is basically a flying jeep, think of rat patrol with lasers.

   As part of the Canon Orthodoxy around here, my position might seem a
bit hypocritical, but I think you need to disconnect the sequence of
events from a particular set of dates.  This becomes critical when
reality starts to make you look like to total smuck.  Besides, we\'re
talking Marc Miller\'s Traveller (not the original), which gives IG an
excuse to do a reality check on the few canon dates that are in near
future.

   It may be better as someone suggested, to start the background with a
date further out (say 2063, the tradional start date for important
events in sci-fi shows like Star Trek and S:AAB).

    'body' => 'Marc,

A few comments about the T4.1 Chargen chapter - I\'ve only just got around
to playtesting it. I generated a batch of characters, and came up with the
following thoughts. Note: you sent me the draft chapter some time in late
June; no doubt it has changed a lot since, so some of these comments may be
obsolete.

On the Chargen Checklist, under "Roll for Injury", it says: "If an injury
occurs, roll one half-die for the years served. Resolve that number of
years, and proceed to Muster Out." This conflicts with the Injury &
Recovery rules, which state that leaving the service when Injured is
non-mandatory.

Under "Roll for Commission", you should explicitly state what it means to
receive a commission. Non-military types such as myself might not know that
it means "promotion to Rank 01 (or Rank 04 if current rank is E7+)".

Also, when a character enters a service after OTC or NOTC, does she
automatically get a commission (and the skill roll that goes with it)?
Perhaps she should become an NCO until she rolls a commission? Or is that
not how it works? The Eneri example seems to suggest that he automatically
received a commission, and the extra skill roll, when he enlisted after
OTC. But this is not stated explicitly.

On the Checklist, under "Aging", it says "At the end of each term
(beginning with term 6), determine the effects of aging..." But different
characters will reach term 6 at different ages: not every character enlists
at age 18. This should say something like: "When the character reaches age
34: at the end of that term, and the end of every subsequent four-year
period, determine the effects of aging..."

Heroism Awards: I think that each Heroism Award should provide a one-time
DM on the next roll for Promotion: +1 for an MCUF, +2 for MCG, and +3 for
SEH.

Some of the "Mustering Out Benefits" tables have a seventh item, but I see
no text explaining the +1 modifier (usually applied if the character has
Gambling, IIRC).

What is Concealment skill, and how is it different from Camouflage?

Heh. Under "Entertainers", I notice that achieving Acting-10 means you\'re a
"Star Actor" and gets you a big wad of cash. Same goes for Writers,
Musicians, and Dancers. Hmm... I guess achieving Artist-10 just means you
go mad, lose all your friends, and starve to death in a garrett...? ;)

In the Navy "Physical" table, I note "Forward Observer". This is a Physical
Development skill? Strange. Why not "Knife" or "Blade Combat" as in the
other fighting services?

All in all, the character generation system is excellent. I found it very
difficult to intentionally produce monster geek characters (without fudging
lots of rolls). Once a character starts aging, you can just about keep
their physical stats at roughly the same level by concentrating rolls on
the Physical table -- but after age 50 this doesn\'t work any more. 

I find that you have to consciously work at building up a specialization
skill or two, by concentrating a lot of rolls on one or two specific
tables. If you follow the rules strictly (no picking skills, except in
school) you can generally build up only one skill to a level of about 5 or
6, if your lucky. And that\'s after University, Grad School x 2, plus six or
seven career terms! Characters who wash out of a career after only two or
three terms are going to be pretty useless (unless they chose a worthwhile
major in school and took a Masters at least), with maybe one skill at level
3 and a bunch at 1 or 2.

I notice that non-academic skills, such as weapons skills, are very hard to
pump up to \'professional\' levels (6+ or so?) -- unless you geek out and
roll continuously on one table for several terms. Which, I suppose, is
intentional, and somewhat realistic.

Entertainers and Scholars seem to have the best chance of pumping more than
one skill up to a high level, because they can choose to push up their
specialty/major - though only as high as their highest non-specialty skill.
(I note that Scholars can cheat by repeatedly returning to school and
pushing a Major skill up to six levels, then returning to their career and
matching that skill with their chosen career Major. Repeat process until
total geekdom is achieved.)

I wonder if all careers shouldn\'t have similar \'specialization skills\',
such as those of the Entertainer and Scholar, which can be chosen instead
of rolled, so long as some other skill is at an equal level. I think it\'s a
good idea for each character to have one or two specialties that makes him
or her uniquely useful to the group. You would still have to geek out on
one table to push up that secondary specialty, so that you can choose
higher levels for your main specialty.

Re: the Task Chapter:

As for the Task System, I think that the probabilities are a bit high for
my tastes, and (like many others on the list) I don\'t care for that
half-die. I suspect I\'m going to use a straight 1D thru 6D progression (and
7D for \'Hopeless\' tasks, I guess).

To compensate for the higher dice codes, I will probably double the number
of Homeworld skills, and find other ways to ensure that all characters have
one or two skills at level 7+, and three or four skills at about 5. This
should also help to further balance the stat:skill ratio, which still seems
somewhat low to me in T4.1.

But the system as designed will work okay - even if some players are going
to gag on that half-die. It\'s certainly a vast improvement over T4.

Well, that\'s all for now. Will send more comments as they occur to me.

Best,

 + GMG +

The Kinunir is a Colonial Cruiser. For ego purposes, some people call it a
Battle Cruiser. At 1200 tons, the ship is relatively tiny.

Kinunir was designed before High Guard, and before Traveller started having

Ways To Roll Dice
	Although there are many schools of thought on how dice should be rolled,=
 the
Traveller game system embraces only three for character generation:
traditional rolls, the pre-rolled sequence, and the specific manipulated =
die
roll.
	Traditional Rolls. As the player creates his or her character, the corre=
ct
number of dice are rolled at the moment the result is required. That resu=
lt
is used, and it cannot be changed or re-rolled.
	Pre-Rolled Sequence. Before the character generation procedure is starte=
d,
the player rolls the dice quite a few times and records the results in or=
der.
The player should roll the half die at least 20 times, a single die at le=
ast
40 times, and two dice at least 50 times.
	During character generation, the player selects the next die roll on the
list and uses it. Because the player can make decisions, the player is
allowed, within the context of the rules, to select what roll is next to =
be
made and can search out options within the rules for the best use of that
roll.
	Manipulated Die Rolls. In some situations, a player=92s goal is a very
specific result: a character of a specific age, or in a specific career, =
or
of a specific rank. In such situations, the player can manipulate the
required die rolls in order to achieve such a result.
	When the player is creating a character to be used for adventuring, the
manipulation of die rolls should be coordinated with the game master in o=
rder
to verify that they are legitimate.

	Broker is a Business skill regarding the marketing of goods, and represents
an understanding of the business of buying and selling. A broker acts as an
agent for the owner of goods (and may act for himself); when the sale takes
place, the broker receives a commission. A broker receives a commission of 5%
per level of skill (to a maximum of 20%).

	Trade and Commerce. Broker skill is used in the Trade and Commerce process.

	Broker is one of two members of the Business skill cluster (the other is
Trader). Trader enables a character to accurately estimate the true value of
merchandise.
	Broker is a default skill (and at Broker-0 allows an individual to make a
deal; it is not enough to allow a commission).

Brokers can influence consultations of the Actual Value Table, but must be
paid a commission. Brokers, however, vary in quality and availability by
starport.

Broker	Starport	Mod	Comm
Broker-4	A	+4	20%
Broker-3	AB	+3	15%
Broker-2	ABC	+2	10%
Broker-1	ABCD	+1	  5%

	Goods are delivered to the ship in 4 days. Accelerated delivery, add 10% per
day.

(From T4) Trader (Business)-Int or Soc This skill is useful in identifying
the best cargos to carry from one world to another. It gives a character an
advantage in commercial trading, as it improves one\'s ability to estimate the
resale value of items in the trade and commerce rules. (See Chapter 10 for
details.)         The Trader skill normally references the Intelligence
attribute, due to the cleverness necessary for recognizing highly-marketable
cargos. A reasonably high Social Level can be of help as well, enabling the
character to make useful connections with buyers and sellers.

Trader).

I\'d certainly agree this in real life.  However, in Traveller I\'d be 
slightly more inclined to give characters a chance to manipulate 
whole societies, in the pattern of Poul Anderson\'s Trader Team et al.
or Jerry Pournelle\'s Falkenberg novels.  (I didn\'t say it would be 
easy!)  Not that one roll on History skill would enable you to start 
a revolution, but it might tell you *how* to start one.

This is a wonderful description of the study of history (or more 
loosely the humanities).  What I was trying to define was the 
"functional" aspect of History skill to PCs.  Traveller skills are 
generally rather practical in scope, which is perhaps one reason why 
CT didn\'t have science skills (too abstract), and I was attempting to 
frame History in a similar way.  Thus also the blurring between 
history, geography, sociology and economics -- Traveller deals in 
"catch-all" skills for the most part.

Here, here!  I\'ve been experimenting with troupe style for the campaign I\'m
writing, and it works well in Traveller.   The players\' main PCs are the
command staff of the Ramble-On Rose, but they also have characters who are
crewmwn, scientists, and ship\'s troops.  This makes each adventure
different, and allows the players to experiment with different
personalities in the same game structure.

One warning, this should only be used if your players are fairly
experienced.  The stress of monitoring 3 or 4 characters can result in the
"Fighter #23" syndrome quickly.

I like this, it adds a great deal of flavor to the skills.

One thing that struck me as I\'ve been reading this discussion of skills and
TL is the scene in Turtledove\'s "Worldwar" series where the British have
finally gotten their hands on a Lizard fighter, and the best radar techs on
the island are just cracking the nose to take a look.

Drooling with anticipation over the expected sudden improvement to their
own radar sets, they open the fighter\'s nose and find...  purple boards
covered with odd gold tracings.  Not a tube in sight.

This is why we need to set skills off by tech level.

Going from nothing to 6800 could be a similar leap as going from 80486 to

The curiosity about zero-g sex is truely one of the few universal constants
amongst Traveller players :*). In my games I take a conservative approach
(couple embrace, camera pans upward, scene fades out in soft focus; cut to
breakfast on the terrace the next morning).

It\'s one of the very real concerns with long duration spaceflights (such as
to Mars). Assuming a mixed gender crew (almost a certainty now), the
possibility of a pregancy becomes quite real and half way between Earth and
Mars there ain\'t a lot of options. We know that a number of human biological
systems such as immunological responses and cellular reproduction are very
badly effected by zero-g; and there\'s some very good reasons to suspect that
foetal development would also be adversely effected. Then one moves on to the
nightmare of childbirth in zero-g, like what role does gravity play in the
physical changes that women undergo in later pregnancy? how does zero-g
effect labour? just how the heck does one cope with the copious release of
body fluids involoved in childbirth without gravity to collect them for you?
Compaired with this the actual mechanics of zero-g sex are simple.

Lets see...

distance to turnover = 2.5 AU = 3.75e8 km = 3.75e11 m
time to turnover = 4 hours = 1.44e4 sec

3.75e11 = .5*A*(1.44e4)^2
3.75e11 = .5*A*2.0736e8
7.5e11 = A*2.0736e8
A = 3.61689148e3 m/sec^2
A = 369 g
V at turnover = .17 c!!!

Gee, I think we just found a different problem for our intrepid
flyboys. Since they have to fight g-forces when they manuever (shown
all the time), they don\'t have inertial damping. So they are a thin
layer of goo inside the fighters. :-)

BTW, at one gee it takes them 6.4 *days* to make the trip. I don\'t
think anybody can spend a week in a fighter cockpit!

Well, I don\'t like the "step in the side of the gravity well" solution.
It creates some nasty field gradients above and below the bed. You get
a zero g area, but the top and bottom of the volume are very steep
gravity gradients to make up for it. So an object falling into the
field from above will get an extra boost. and likewise, one that slips
out the bottom of the null g area will also be boosted.

Since the "overall" cuvature has to remain constant, the local
curvature has to get exaggerated on both "sides" of the flat area.
Since field strength is proportional to slope, you see the problem.
(the worst case would be having a "vertical" slope at the high or low
end. That\'d *really* ruin your day.

Quite right! The difficulty depends on the planet (for me that\'s GM fiat at
the moment), and the time is more like 3 days.

>Now, what happens when this task fails? The person doesn\'t find  cargo?

Any of several things:

1. no suitable cargo is found.
2. smaller selection of cargo found.
3. cargo found, but the Trader is *wrong* about it\'s value.
4. cargo found, but the Trader is *wrong* about how valuable it will be on
planet X.

That sort of thing.

>Introducing this task sure means there will be less cargo to be had!

Maybe, maybe not.  Rob Prior has a good system on his website for
developing Trade Tables that you might want to look at, it includes tasks.

According to FFS2, the curoff point for thrusters is about 2000AU for a Sol
like star.  This makes thrusters very usable within almost any solar system.

Travel times would still make micro-jumps preferable in many cases (Ie,
Earth to Pluto.)

If I may jump the gun a bit here, I\'d like to see the revised combat system
go back to an "action point" style of system.  I\'ve been fooling around
with a varient personal combat system since T4 came out, and have had great
results with mechanics based on Snapshot/AHL.

In my system APs are based on Dex+Int+Tactics.  This pool is used to move,
shoot, and perform tasks inside each six-second combat turn.  Moving
cautiously down a corridor, covering doorways costs 5AP per 1.5m square.
Players plot out their moves, and announce them simultaniously.  If you run
into a situation that voids what you were going to do, you lose all APs
that you committed but haven\'t spent.  This keeps players from declaring
"I\'ll run down the corridor, open the airlock, and throw the grenade
through."  They are much mor e likely to keep a reserve of APs just in case.

This system is based on my training and experiences as an infantryman along
with research into the nature of combat.  In dangerous situations, people
tend to get very cautious about movement and exposing themselves, and I\'ve
seen troops moving "on edge" to keep ready for the next surprise.

If anyone is interested, I can clean it up a bit and post it to the list.

At 1002, the Imperium was moving into TL 15...most TL 15 constructs were
prototypes, technology demonstrators and pre-production models, with a few
items in full production.. Although the Imperium certainly used TL 15
equipment during the Rim War (what better place to try it out?), there
wasn\'t enough to substantially alter the TL of it\'s forces, which were
still largely TL 14 (late TL 14).

The Solomani Confederation was solid TL 14 in most areas at the end of the
Rim War.  Subsequent research and espionage pushed it into the TL14/15
border by 1110... the Confederation in the CT ear (c. 1107) was late TL 14
overall, pushing into TL 15.  Between 1107 and 1117, some invisible \'line\'
was crossed in the Vilani dominated Bureau for Technological Assessment
*g*, and the Confederation moved into early TL 15.  At the same time, parts
of the Imperium were pushing into TL 16 (e.g. Vincennes, Dlan).

Could make for some good adventures...Solomani agents crossing the border
to steal Imperial technology, or Imperial interests trying to stop them.

Opinion only, remember...

Humans have some problems in _continuous_ zero-G, and the long term
effects aren\'t known. We\'re talking _intermittent_ zero-G here, folks, so
the effects we\'re talking about wouldn\'t be manifesting themselves. In
fact, I\'d suspect that people would spend less time sleeping, since once
you got used to sleeping at zero gee, your body would be able to relax
more, and rest more efficiently, and so could get by with 4-6 hours where
the average is 7-9 hours now.

Acclimitization is the key. We won\'t know the effects of intermittent zero
gee until we can study it.

I quite agree. The original poster advocated beds that reduced gravity
in the sleeping area to zero-G, even when planet-bound, so passengers
could sleep standing up and thus save space. I pointed out the danger of
having a local area of gravity control, and that the same space could be
saved by high-tech materials and folding beds.

I agree completely. My SleepWell(tm) Narcoplast sleeping surface is
designed to work under the 1G standard gravity of the starship. It folds
down from the wall, like beds in those small cheezy apartments in the
movies, sans noisy box-spring.

Another point against zero-G beds: Wouldn\'t the daily switch from 1G to
0G be unhealthy, uncomfortable and disconcerting? Waking up in the
morning would be a whole new negative experience if one had to drag
oneself off cloud nine and onto the floor, the oppressive effects of
gravity making it even more difficult to get on with the day...

Different strokes. The crew of the ships as I see them would have override
control over anyplace on the ship, of course, but would allow a good deal
of leeway to what folks do in their cabins. (The more I think about the 
possibilities of NarcoPlast, the more I like including it in the cabins as 
well as the Cloud 9 g-beds, for those who like their gravity *high*). I
would say giving the passengers *no* control over their room gravity
would be a bit paranoid for me, but then I have discrete closed circuit
monitoring of all the rooms on my yacht if needed, so who\'s paranoid? :)
Besides, the beds that I recently posted look a lot like either canopy
beds, or playpens, or geodesic spheroids anyhoo; you don\'t just fall into
one like a regular bed, but get *into* it, close the safety screen/field 
generator, and turn it on.

>Why waste power on manipulating bed gravity when space could be

Because, as others have stated, power is *cheeeeaaaap* in Traveller. 
My bed design I posted will support a metric ton of people (for those 
times when you have a few special friends over on batteries that will
run for 24hours of continuous use. Lesser use/weight will only 
increase the battery life/decrease the recharge time.

Love it! Reminds me a lot of Computer By The Foot, and the instantly
transformable cloth/powder that was discussed on here a ways back for
portable keyboards, conformable control systems, and such. Consider
it swiped.

No, energy in Traveller is *cheap*, thanks to Fusion+. And as far as
the boosting to escape velocity, I see it more as a modification of 
contragrav, using a electronic "net" or a geodesic framework, or a 
series of "projectors" in the wall, or whatever to produce a contragrav
field within which the person floats. Kinda like that floating frog on
CNN the other day, but different :)

No more so than an airraft would. If it doesn\'t turn into a meteor when
its contragrav gives out a meter above the ground, why should a person?

C\'mon, Leonard, quit pissing in my oatmeal :) I\'ve already established
on the List that I like my Traveller a bit softer than some if it means that
my players and I can have some of the really cool things we\'ve "seen" in
a couple of decades of reading/watching sci-fi. We don\'t want 
Teleporters or drives that go "vroooomm" in a vacuum, but we demand
our thrustless drives and our interstellar drives and our zero-g amuse-
ment parks. I\'ve made my bed, you can at least let me lie in it <g>

Indeed, most of the evidence points to Traveller grav tech being related

But Traveller has a long history of inertialess contragrav/thrusters.

I considered using this in my designs, but thought that a storage bank made

Belter Drug is already in the Canon, as someone has previously stated.
And in my campaign, I have Space Drug which does much the same and
more. I have faith that another few thousand years of medicine can give
us a solution; we\'ve only been experimenting with low-g environments
for a couple of decades now; give us time  :)

Quite possible that periods of zero g is not healthy, but possibly not, too.
I do remember seeing where exercising for several hours a day minimized
the muscle and bone effects, just think of it as exercisizing for 16 hours a
day. In addition, we have drugs in Traveller to counteract the effects of 
zero-g on the body. The gods know that people in this country wil already
take a pill for every ill as it is...

C\'mon now, you know that in the absence of real world data there is no
reason to believe that they wouldn\'t, either. Unhealthiness certainly hasn\'t
stopped people from smoking, drinking, eating at McD\'s, or baking them-
selves on the beach/in the tanning booth now, has it? <g> What was it
Barnum said about underestimating the public?

Thank you, Ralph Nader; "Unsafe At Any G" <vbg>

I think that the Far Future will be unimaginably different from now as 
well; it\'s just that I dare to presume to imagine it just like the next
guy<g>.
And my bit has grav beds. And I think we\'ve shown that the effects can
be eliminated/minimized w/ Traveller medicine and tech. And as far as
taking "unnecessary meds" goes, I don\'t think that folks who inject 
silicon, saline, and collagen into their bodies, take daily drugs to 
prevent acne and hair loss, and eat substances that are *known* to 
cause abdominal cramping and sudden diarrhea just so that they can
eat twice as many potato chips, all in the name of vanity, would have
any problem with one more "supplement"  :)

Ouch :) You\'d definitely either want a large open space to try this (it\'s
a shame we let Skylab fall down), or else something like a sleeping bag
arrangement. In fact, that would seem far easier than a sleeping bag 
under gravity... *cough cough*

Perhaps we should require an End task roll to see if they are allowed

Marc, this is really good work here; can we get this included in T4.1 ?

I for one use the Action Points from Snapshot with modifications and

You need to add cryogenics as a separate skill or include it in the
description of medical. You should also consider pharmacy or
pharmacology as a part of medical. Also psychology does not deal with
mental illness, that\'s psychiatry! I personally use the term Medicine as
the professional physician and Medical as the technician level.

One shouldn\'t think of the Jupiter\'s Trojan Asteroids as a "point" in
space 60 degrees to either side.  The region these asteroids occupy
conjures up focused "radar-like" lobes along Jupiter\'s orbital path.
Perhaps a better image would be the blade of a chain saw.

I didn\'t see the particular S:AAB scene, so I don\'t know if this helps,
but the Trojans oscillate considerably ahead and behind Jupiter, and they
sometimes move closer than the notion of the 60 degree LaGrange points
confer.

As for putting spacestations there, the Earth-Luna system is better than
the Jovian system, unless your station can move or withstand occasional
rock-crushing. <G>

I\'ve been meaning to tell that I am a H.S. Thompson fan too.  He lives close
to here, up in Aspen in the mountains.

Back to the Terra ideas.  Your post made me think of a quicky that I wrote
just yesterday.

It seems hopeless to try and discuss a "unified" view of the published record
of Traveller.  Given that certain "revisions" happened over time for the game,
I don\'t see a feasible way to keep _all_ of it in tact.  Try this on for size.

   "In the early years of the Sylean Federation, historians, working from
    incomplete records on Sylea and the dozen or so original Federation
    worlds, were able to prove using individual sources, that the empire
    called the Rule of Man was TL12, TL13, TL14, TL15, and TL16."

   "The problem is that they were all right and all wrong.  Of course, the
    reality is that an Empire is made of up many worlds, and all of these
    were found in the Rule of Man."

   "It wasn\'t until the Sylean Scout Service (IISS) contacted the 183 worlds
    of the newly forming Third Imperium, and compiled the cross-referenced
    data in the year 59, that enough actual verifiable, archeological fact
    was uncovered to show that the Second Imperium was in fact TLX."
 
                             --Yoshi McElroy, translated by Leroy Guatney
             excerpted from the essay on Tech Assessment, IISS Explorer\'s
             Handbook, published Regina/Regina 1100


Now, the above writing was tastefully done, and fits into _whatever_ view
of the Rule of Man\'s TL you happen to buy into.

Afterall, we have talked about a number of sources scattered across four
editions of the game.  Somewhere the line has to be drawn.

I am finished with this discussion.  Whenever the X (above) gets filled in,
I suggest if you don\'t like it, use the various sources presented throughout
the course of this discussion to make things work for your campaign.

One last comment.  I have gotten the feeling that it was not appreciated by
some when I told Harold many weeks ago that what he had written was good for
his campaign.  I want to explain that for me, that is the ultimate compliment.
All that I mean when I say something like that is, "I would play your campaign
using that interpretation, because Traveller _is_ about what we want it to be."

I have had the privilege of writing for the first three eras of the game, and
I know I would have liked to contribute more, but I also know that we can\'t
all be the Architect.  That is hopefully one person\'s job, and will stay that
way.  This game abounds with possibilities, and I hope it stays that way,
while all the time growing.

IMO

The Imperium reached TL 15 around Year 1000. That means they began upgrading
their navy to TL 15 around that time. Some of their navy, that is, because
only a few Imperial planets would be able to build TL 15 ships from the
start (In 1100 they still have some TL 14 ships). So the Solomani Border
War would be fought with mostly TL 14 ships. As for TL 15 troops, who knows?
If we use the explanation I came up with (that an interstellar society\'s TL
is measured by it\'s highest space technology, whereas individual planets\'
are measured by that planet\'s highest overall TL) then both the Imperium
and the Solomani may have had some TL 15 troops. But if Terra\'s home
defense units had a TL of 14 then that is solid evidence  -  I\'d go so
far as to call it proof  -  that Terra\'s military TL at that time was 14.

>Remember also, that Terra (and the Solomani Sphere) were part

Right. And since the Imperium reached TL 14 around 700 then it makes sense
that some planets in the Solomani Sphere was TL 14 too. And the evidence
works both ways, of course; if Terra had been TL 15 before 871 then TL 15
knowledge would have been available to the Imperial authorities and at
least some Imperial planets would have been TL 15 too.

>Now if you are telling me that a bunch of Terrans at TL14 can take on the

That\'s not true, at least not by CT combat rules. Steve Higginbotham once
estimated that given optimal ship design (not always a given ;-), TL 12
ships have a 12/1 advantage over TL 9 ships while TL 15 ships have a 3/1
advantage over TL 14 ships (I have no idea how things are under T4 ship
design and combat rules). Nor is \'a bunch of Terrans\' the proper appelation 
for the combined forces of the whole Solomani Sphere. And in any case, the
Imperial forces would not be solid TL 15... or even borderline TL 15.

>Sorry, but it is clear to me, that Terra was TL15+ at the outset of the
>Solomani Rim War, c. 998.

Let me get this straight: You claim that Terra was TL 15+, despite the fact
that Terra\'s defenses were only TL 14? 

I\'ve got a suggestion: Pretend you have to present the best possible case for 
the RoM being TL 12 and examine every bit of evidence in that light. List it 
in two columns side by side with the \'RoM was TL 15+\' case and see for
yourself. Perhaps that will help.

Politics in the Solomani Confederation was a tad more complex than you
appear to think. They had their doves as well as their hawks. And a
sizable number of loyal Solomani considered the Sphere to be the natural
border of the Confederation.

(I _yhink_ the above is canon, but I can\'t remember the references offhand,
so I may be wrong. Perhaps it was just what we worked out on the Pocket
Empire mailing list).

4.  Skills should be kept in the same range as CT (i.e. 1-6, or 
so--where a level 3 is considered a professional skill level, level 
1 is considered a beginner, and level 5 or higher is considered a 
beginner).

5.  The task statement should be modified so that skills and stats 
are equally represented.

I know you said above that you do not want discussion or elaboration, 
but it should be pointed out that tasks in T4.1 are not too easy.  
The way you have it set up, success chance falls in a desirable 
range.

This should not be a point of contention--and I say this based on 
your earlier post a few days ago stating that skills will still 
average around level 2 (and some people have written in saying that 
level 4 is about as high as most skills go).

OK.  200 years.   :)

Actually, magamps, tubes, and some of these older technologies
produce some high quality signals in specialized components and
are highly resistant to shock damage as well as EMP.  So there
are uses for them.  I\'m just not sure how old these technologies
are, but my guess is less than a century.  

Perhaps my point would be better made to suggest we consider
the next cutting edge tech to come along rather than forcing
the RoM to use old 80x86\'s cannibalized from IBM PCs.  (A TL 7
RoM).

I haven\'t had the time to study the draft of T4.1 CharGen rules, so maybe
the explanation is there, but if T4.1 is anything like T4 then I don\'t 
understand what you mean by abuse. (It is easy to understand how you could
abuse the TNE CharGen with multiple careers, of course). Except for a bit
of trouble with the mustering out rules I don\'t see why someone shouldn\'t
change careers as often as he likes. In my own campaign I limit careers
changes by requiring the character to start at the bottom rung of the
new career unless it has one or more skills useful to the new career at a 
reasonable level, and by using ordinary common sense, but as I said, I don\'t
understand where the abuse comes in. Can you enlighten me?

The _Traveller Adventure_ description of the March Harrier (your average
400-ton subsidized merchant) stated that the floor field could be set
from 0 G to 2.0 G anywhere on the ship, with the rooms having
individual gravity control.

Now, I always took this to mean that every cabin had a little dial by
the door marked "Gravity" along with the ones marked "Temperature",
"Air Pressure", and so on, and that the passengers could set their
own inside their caibn..  I\'m perfectly comfortable with the
idea that the crew can override the local gravity control from the bridge.

I don\'t understand why you wan\'t to discourage players from generating
characters with multiple careers. Why is that?

Some second careers are mandated. In Denmark you can\'t become a police
officer without having served in the military (Mind you, the term of
service in the military can be as little as a year).

In some societies multiple careers could be mandatory. How about a society 
where _everybody_ is required to serve a term in one of the militaries? 
(Didn\'t the Soviet Union use to have something like that?) And in some cases 
you might even want to give enlistment bonuses to a second career for certain
prior careers (f.ex. a term in the army might _improve_ your chances of
becoming a law enforcer).

The Zhodani (mostly TL14) did fine against the Imperium (mostly TL15)
through the 4th and 5th Rim Wars...TL15 vs 14 isn\'t that big a technology
advantage; Jump-6 helps very little (you can never design a decent warship
to take advantage of it), armour and lasers don\'t improve, the only big
advantage is smaller power plants. The Solomani Sphere had lots of high-pop
worlds, which are the only ones that count economically - no surprise they
did reasonably well (but one should note, still lost lots of 
territory...)

Not clear to *anyone* else - there\'s no evidence beyond your own wishful

I:E certainly doesn\'t reinforce the idea that Terra was TL-15 at the time
of the invasion. *Some* of the counters have to be native Terran troops - 
it\'s just impossible for the Solomani to have evacuated all the troops in
question, given the flow of the war - and native troops pretty much always 
have the TL of their homeworld (look at all the planetary forces in FFW.) 
I\'ll grant that the Imperium was (early) TL-15 if that\'s what MT says
(anyone else check the dates?), but it must be pretty early; I say again that
the invasion of Earth was the single most important ground battle for the
Imperium to win, and if they had TL-15 troops they would have deployed them.

So, in order to assume a TL-15 terra in the Rim War, you have to assume that
it was the *only* world in the Solomani Sphere that was TL-15 - which seems
odd. 

And that it chose not to build any TL-15 home defence forces, and that
every single scrap of TL-15 military equipment it *did* build was evacuated - 


This seems somewhat implausible to me. The preponderance of evidence really
does suggest that Terra was TL-14 at the time of the invasion.

You are, of course, entitled to your opinion, and I am not going to gainsay
you.  I do, however, have a different spin on Galileo than many.  Partly
because I was both a confirmed Anglican and a Physicist, I was always in
the center of the "religion vs. science issue."  Made Galileo sort of a
special study for me, as I had thought that the popular view (brave
scientist punished by Luddite church) was correct.

After some years of thought and study, I realized why my Physics professors
disagreed, and really did not care what religion their students followed.
The two patterns of thought address completely separate areas, typically.
For example, if you bind your religion to a scientific truth, then when
more is discovered about that truth, you are in worlds of hurt.  Likewise,
a scientific hypothesis backed with religious fervor often hides real data.

Galileo was one of the first examples of a person thinking that physical
and political smarts are the same.  He was quite bright, but he made some
incredible tactical blunders.  For example, he had Simplicio quote the
official church positions on a couple of issues, using the Church phrasing
so that the reader could not possibly miss it.  Not wise...

Especially not wise when one of his close discussion companions was the
Pope of the day, a man as arrogant as Galileo, and who it was not terribly
wise to piss off.  By publishing in the way he did, Galileo guaranteed a
hostile response from an arrogant man, and because of his own arrogance, he
did not manage the publicity surrounding his discovery well enough to
escape the anger of his former companion.  The Pope of the time was usually
placatable, as long as he was "in the loop," but was not terribly forgiving
when left out of it and insulted.

He might have escaped some controversy if his models were clearly better.
Unfortunately, it was not yet qualitatively simpler than the models he was
working against.  The heliocentric model would not get simpler until the
planetary orbits were considered ellipses.  This limited his "See. I am
right!" ability.  Once that fillip is added things got so much simpler that
it was hard to attack him and his model, even if he was a bit aggressive in
stating it.

Since this is off topic, I invite those interested to respond via email.  I
do recommend the book "Coming of Age in the Milky Way" by Timothy Ferris,
as a rather neat examination of the various universe sizes contemplated by
people at various times in history.  It also goes into the political skill
or lack thereof of the people who were pushing the various ideas.

    'body' => 'There\'s a line in CT Book 4:  Mercenary that states, "In general, 
prices will tend to drop by 5-15% at each tech level after the level 
of introduction of an item, with examples of the item sold at the 
regular base price generally incorporating improvements or 
representing deluxe models."

I wanted to incorporate this idea into my campaign, so I went looking 
for additional Traveller articles on the subject.  I only found one 
other article, in BJTAS #1, by Frank Chadwick, but that article 
focussed more on the buying power of the Imperial credit vs local 
currency than it did the actual variation of an item\'s price on 
different worlds.

Given that, I used the concepts in these two articles and came up 
with my own pricing chart, based on the TL of the item and the TL of 
the world it is being purchased on.

Let\'s say you are on a TL 10 world and you want to buy a TL 9 map 
box.  You\'d expect to pay less for it than the printed Traveller 
base price, wouldn\'t you?  I would, so I designed these rules to 
accommodate.

I also realize that economics are not as cut and dry as that, so I 
added another factor that could actually increase the price of the TL 
9 map box on the TL 10 world.

As always, I\'ve designed this system to be simple, easily 
understood and introduced, and fully integrateable with your 
Traveller campaign.

The TL Based Pricing system takes two steps, which are covered below.

===============================================================
Ken\'s TL Based Pricing For Traveller
===============================================================

Assumptions.

I\'ve made a few assumptions when designing this rule.
1.  The Traveller printed based price is the price of the item at its 
     introductory TL on a world with a Class A starport.

2.  The starport of a world effects the prices of goods in several, 
     sometimes undefinable ways.  (Ex:  It may affect prices directly 
     because of the item being imported, or it may affect prices 
     indirectly because of the import of parts used in the item.  
     Something may be imported for one industry then found to be 
     useful in another industry, etc.)

3.  The price of an item will generally go down if purchased on a 
     lower tech level world.

4.  The price of an item will generally go up if purchased on a 
     higher tech level world.

5.  The GM will have final say in what items are available on a 
     world.  (Just because the item wanted is of lower tech than the 
     world\'s tech level, it does not mean that the item is available. 
     Likewise, there may be limits on what can be imported to the 
     world.  Various local laws may apply.  This is the realm of the 
     GM.)

==============================================================

Rules.

Step 1 (Starport factor):  Roll 1 D6 and use corresponding starport 
            table.  Divide Traveller base price by the factor under 
            the world\'s starport code.  This will result in the 
            item\'s adjusted base price.

Step 2  (TL factor):  Roll 1 D6 and use corresponding TL table.  
            Figure the difference between the item\'s TL and the 
            world\'s TL, either up or down.  

            If the world\'s TL is higher than that of the item, 
            MULTIPLY the factor from the TL table by the adjusted 
            base price (from step 1).  This will give you the final 
            price of the item.

            If the world\'s TL is lower than that of the item, and the 
            GM is allowing this item as an import, DIVIDE the 
            adjusted base price (from step 1) by the factor from the 
            TL table.  This will give you the final price of the 
            item.

===============================================================

Notes.

You can use these tables in a number of ways.  One way, which may be 
cumbersome for some people, is to calculate each price for every item 
purchased or shopped.  This means rolling for a starport table for 
each item, then rolling for a TL table for each item, then 
calculating the price of each item.

On the other end of the spectrum, a GM can save himself some 
headaches and still use the pricing charts by rolling once for the 
starport table and once for the TL table.  Then the GM can copy down 
the final factor and use it for everything purchased on the 
world (one price factor for the entire world).  

A middle-ground approach combines the two options above and may 
provide a good compromise between the realism that comes with heavy 
dice rolling/calculations and the broad method of having only one 
price factor for everything on the world.  GMs can pre-roll the 
factors for items in each of the item categories given in the MT 
World Builder\'s Handbook.  Under this method, a GM would 
pre-calculate a price factor for items that fall under the Personal 
Military category, the Space Transport category, the Medical 
category, and so on.  In this way, all items under a single category 
will have one price factor, but price factors between categories may 
be different--yeilding different prices between items.

Using these rules will provide economic differences between worlds 
that are otherwise the same.  You can have two planets, side by side, 
with the same TL and the same starport, but they may have varying 
prices for the same item.

In this way, these rules are intended to add more realism to your 
game.  Players may find that one place that they can buy weapons and 
ammo at real low prices, but it is on the other side of the 
subsector.  As with all role-playing, these rules should be used to 
compliment your game.  If you find them to be a nuisance, and you are 
bogged down in dice rolling, I suggest you use one of the less 
complicated options for using these rules that I have detailed above 
or drop the system all together.

As always, I welcome comments, criticisms, and suggestions.

I use in my game.  They are available to anybody just for the asking.

Close, but not quite. 

Lagrange points are the points where there is no acceleration, where
gravitational and centrifugal forces "cancel". For any two masses, there
are three points of minimum potential: L1 L2 L3. These points are
unstable. Any whack from a piece of space debris or a passing body will
disturb an object orbiting at that point, flinging it into one the
gravitational wells or off into space.

Stable Lagrange points (L4 & L5) are at a potential *maximum* not
minimum. If a body at that point is perturbed slightly, it will just
execute a stable (not necessarily closed) orbit around the L4 or L5
point.

For Example, the Trojan Asteroids *share* Jupiter\'s orbit. They orbit
the L4 and L5 points of the Sun-Juptier system, 60 degrees behind and
ahead of Jupiter in its orbit. Some of the Trojans make complicated
orbits taking as long as 110 years to meander around the Lagrange point.
(While orbiting the sun every 11.86 years like Jupiter)

I hope I got the above right, I cribbed parts from some Astronomy notes
on the web...

FFS2 has a system with which to use it.  That system is called "physics."
There\'s a game supplement out for it, authors Halliday and Resnick. :)

Seriously, people who want the design detail provided by FFS2 are
(largely) the same people who have the tools -- mental and physical --
with which to turn units like gee-hours and light-seconds into travel
times, vehicle ranges, combat system elements, and so forth.  Personally,
I\'m *far* happier seeing real-world units in a design system, perhaps
supplemented by conversions to game-system stats.  If I know a laser is
factor-37, I\'m helpless to decide if it can be applied to a nonstandard
task (long-range signalling, say, or pushing a lightsail).  If I know it
emits 10-microsecond pulses, each carrying 5 MJ of energy, at a frequency
of 0.2 pulses per second, then I can apply actual *physics* to get an
answer.

The other (and related) beauty of real-world units is that you can build
game-unit systems on top of them at will, including mutually exclusive
ones, and translate between them via the "ground truth" of real-world
units.  So if I know a factor-37 laser in Bob\'s Cool Space Combat system
is equivalent my laser above, and so is an Yludium Q37 Explosive Space
Modulator from the "Secret Tech of the RoM" supplement (which assumes a
different combat system), I can freely include both in my campaign using
either combat system, or any other which provides conversions between its
units and real-world units.

Yes, because fighters (being small) are a limiting case of the simpler
design systems, as are (for example) missiles and extremely low- or
high-tech craft.  QSDS constrains itself to a small range of hull sizes in
which a number of subsystems scale more or less linearly with size.
Designing a (good) 20-ton craft is *inherently* harder than designing a
(good) 500-ton craft, as you need to pay more attention to how you fit all
the needed subsystems into the far more constrained space...and you need
to think about what subsystems you can do without which get included
"silently" by QSDS (e.g., contragrav and g-comp).

QSDS is like Lego...if you want a more or less blocky shape, or a shape
which can be built up from blocks, it works really well, and is very easy
to use.  If you want (say) a smooth sphere, you\'re SOL.  FFS is like
modeling clay...you can get just about any shape you want, but actually
doing so takes time, patience, and skill.

You can\'t.  End of story.  If you want to do that, either learn FFS (it\'s
not *that* hard), or use pre-built designs (lots of those appear on the
TML, and in fact next month\'s THUDDD will be a heavy fighter specifically
to explore the new low-size domain opened by FFS2).  Or switch to another
game system which supports what you want to do, either as a patch on
Traveller, or using an entirely different game.  Nobody\'s holding a gun to
your head saying "Thou shalt not handwave figheters into existence, nor
shalt thou create 20,000 dt ore carriers our of whole cloth."  All FFS2
does for you is let you create both of these while remaining consistent
with the (game and real-world) properties of other vessels.

By the way, my brother Douglas mentioned that he uses FFS/SSDS despite
being a high-school dropout; conversely, all my THUDDD designs (including
my April THUDDD winner) have been QSDS designs, despite my having a
BS in chemistry with an engineering tilt.  So far, I\'ve found the
"chunkiness" of QSDS doesn\'t overly constrain me, and I love that 25% cost
discount.  Your mileage may vary.  The point is, you have *many* more
(sanctioned) choices in this regard than in any other RPG in history, not
to mention your utter freedom to say "f*ck sanctioning" and roll your own
system or lack of same.

The authors of FFS2 produced an utterly admirable work.  They had to walk
a precarious balance beam between compatibilities with FFS1, the "secret"
FFS1.5, QSDS, SSDS, and canon.  I\'m astonished how well they did at the
job; it was amusing to read the book and spot the dozens of places where
TML arguments clearly inspired new declarations on canon (e.g., now jump
involves *both* a lanthanum grid *and* H2 "displacement mass"!).

FFS2 was indeed seriously undercut by IG\'s approach to production.  Most
notable and pathetic are the ludicrously bad equation errors (parentheses
and double-headed arrows in place of multiplication signs, and so forth). 
These are simply not acceptable; they are clear indications that no
competent person at IG even *looked* at the galley proofs, an
unforgiveable sin in publishing.  My opinion of IG as a management team
has thus ratcheted down yet another notch, placing it currently near the
crust/mantle boundary. 

Less critical but still sad was their decision to rush the book into print
with (a) inadequate playtesting and (b) no game-unit conversions
specified.  The fact that (a) didn\'t end up causing any major problems
(that I\'ve found, or that I\'ve seen reported) must be ascribed to sheer
good fortune combined with the very talented group of authors.  As I\'ve
mentioned, (b) isn\'t necessarily a major problem, but it\'s a shame IG
couldn\'t get their shit together on this issue before FFS2 came out.  It\'s
another (much less serious) instance of the M:0 vs. FS lack of
coordination syndrome.

How you derived this from either your or others\' comments is a mystery to
me.  Surely, you\'d prefer QSDS (available in T4) to FFS2?  In a section I
snipped, you asked for conversions from QSDS stats to real-world units.
Other than the weapon and sensor systems, QSDS *works* in real-world
units.

One of our points of total agreement; VDS should never have been released
if FFS2 was planned.  At the very least, VDS should have been made largely
FFS1-compatible in the expectation that FFS2 would also be
FFS1-compatible.  What actually happened is another entry in my "IG
management is either stupid or seriously misguided" examples list.

FFS1 invalidated Traveller shipbuilding canon by moving all m-drives to
HEPlaR.  To compensate for the massive HEPlaR fuel requirements, they had
to reduce required J-Drive fuel.  This in turn broke FFS1 ship designs
with respect to *all* other releases of Traveller.  Personally, I\'m glad
to see FFS2 (and QSDS/SSDS) returning to the older drive and fuel canon.

The claim "If you fail to agree with me, you are by definition stupid (or
misguided, or unenlightened, or being senselessly stubborn)" is a popular
rhetorical trick used by those whose actual arguments are not carrying the
audience.  I do not appreciate your use of it on this list.  Please
restrict your posts to arguments about Traveller, and refrain from ad
hominem attacks in the future.  This makes the list a more pleasant,
useful, and productive forum for all points of view.

Dreadnoughts:  If you want to fight DN-class vessels versus one another
(or similarly large vessels), then yes, T4 has so far left you in the
lurch.  However, in 99% of role-playing-oriented Traveller campaigns,
knowing precisely how many thousands of point-defense lasers that Tigress
has is not an issue.  My brother once posted a scene from one of his games
that\'s stayed with me ever since...the players are in a 200-ton Free
Trader:

GM:  OK, the Imperial Battleship _Invincible_ is in orbit near you.  They
send a radio message, standard hailing band -- "Prepare to receive
boarders for a cargo inspection.  Acknowledge."

Player 1:  What are our odds of fighting this thing?

GM:  They\'ve got weapon bays bigger than your entire ship.  *Lots* of
them.

Player 2:  OK, everyone, into uniform!  Send back, "Welcome aboard,
Imperial Navy!"

The point being that any ship much bigger than the 5,000-ton limit is,
relative to most player groups, an abstraction, a plot device, rather than
anything requiring detailed fleshing out.

Space fighters:  There still seems to be a massive difference of opinion
over whether these actually work in Traveller; if you want them, use the
several designs which have appeared on the TML, wait for a supplement to
include them, learn FFS2, or watch the September THUDDD.

Robots:  Admittedly not covered yet by Traveller.  Handwave them, use
older supplements (Book 8, Vampire Fleets) to build them, or wait and see
what comes from IG, the TML, or other sources.

T4 comes closer to this in many ways than any other SF RPG, especially now
that FFS2 is out (with its vehicle vs. starship armor and weapon
equivalencies).

As QSDS and SSDS were based on a modified (unreleased) version of FFS1,
which I call FFS1.5, which fixed the jump fuel and thruster drive problems
from FFS1, and introduced Fusion+...frankly, any remaining tweaks required
to bring QSDS/SSDS/FFS2 into full compatibility should be very small
indeed.

There *are* good, simple ship combat systems available *now* for T4...RPSC
is the best, IMHO, but there are others floating around.

I think we all agree that the lack of a good *paper-published* ship combat
system is a Bad Thing, but I can\'t agree the situation is as horrible as
you make it out to be.

Were I IG, I would offer a full refund for any copy of Starships mailed to
them, and burn the returned copies.  It stinks that bad.  Other than that,

No, no, you utterly misunderstand the original poster.  He\'s talking about
order of *development*.  Release schedule is a separate issue.

What, you\'d prefer your ship-design systems to be written by poets?  I
mean, seriously, who else *can* do this kind of work?

Now, for the QSDS end of the spectrum, they should have engaged far more
inexperienced playtesters to see if they could *use* the resulting system,
and used the results of these tests to fine-tune its design and
presentation.  Yet another IG management screw-up, but one of the less
disruptive ones, IMHO -- QSDS (the bug-fixed 1.5 version) is a good,
simple, straightforward ship design system.

I\'m not following your analogy.  Are you suggesting that using just one
of these groups would be better, or including more groups, or just one
group not on this list?  I truly don\'t follow what you\'re trying to say
here.

All answered by FFS2, which answers apply (by definition) to QSDS.  On the
"why figure mass" issue, it\'s a *simplification* -- what you\'re asking
for, right?  Figuring mass allows you to see if the ship\'s density falls
outside the range where calculating m-drive performance based on volume
breaks down, and you need to instead fall back on the more complicated
iterative f=ma approach.

Oh, *please*.  If you don\'t either know this or know how to use any

You don\'t.  Or you rotate control, guiding those near targets, letting the

(1) No, we\'re arguing that it\'s resolved already, though perhaps not

I\'ve always seen Broker as a skill in bargaining, while Trade is a skill in
marketing.  That is, a broker can get you the best price on grapple grommets,
and sell them for you as well, but a trader will be able to predict whether
grapple grommets are really in demend on Regina or not.

In terms of starship crew functions, the trader will know what kind of cargo
buy, while the broker handles the actual buying and selling. (Of course, a
single person could have both skills.)

On my web page (URL above) I have a set of tasks for finding, buying, and
selling trade goods.  About the only change you would have to make to convert
from MT to T4 would be to multiply the times by ten.  (MT tasks multiplied a
3D roll by the time given, thus the time given is about 10% of the actual
time taken.)

My question is this.  How many computer programs can be run in a

Before, in CT, computers had space and capacity figures telling you how
much space a computer had to run programs and how many total programs
the computer can hold.

For example, a model/1 computer could run 2 size one programs
simultaneously, or it could run 1 size two program.

I don\'t know how to handle this in T4.  Book 1 says that a program must
be of the appropriate TL to run, but it doen\'t state how many programs
you can run at one time.

Am I to believe that you can run as many programs as you want--all at
the same time, as long as the TL requirement is met?

I do it with the bed as an easychair/sofa/futon/bed type of thing.  It
pulls out from the wall and unfolds when you transform it from a sofa
(large) or easychair (small).  Frankly, passengers spend most of their time
in the commons areas rather than their rooms.  The cabins are *small* and
crowded, and the staterooms (small and large) aren\'t much better. 
Passengers lounge in the Lounge, they read in the Reading Room, they dine
in the Dining Room, they entertain in the Entertainment Room..on small
ships it\'s all the same room ;->, but it gets them out of their cramped
little cabins.  Game reason, it forces them into more interaction with the
other inmates..uh I mean, passengers ;->..and crew than if they can hole up
in their cabins.

I suspect you meant, "and level 5 or higher is considered an expert.",
correct?

I do think it would be *good* if skills and stats ran on appromimately the
same scale. This implies that with an average Characteristic of 7, an
average skill should also be *about* 7.  If this becomes the case, I would
*prefer* that the skills achieved these levels without using a multiplier
(ie KB2), might or might not be possible, but I would prefer it, and what
this means for skills is that 1 is a beginner, perhaps 6 is professional,
and 9 is an expert.

"How the Mir\'s "Oxygen Candles" Work 

When the Mir\'s two Elektron oxygen-producing systems are
unavailable, the crew burns "Oxygen Candles" to produce the
oxygen they need. Following is a brief explanation of how
these candles work. This technology is well understood,
highly reliable and at least as old as WW1 submarines,
where it was already used. 

The "candles" are stainless-steel cassettes holding
"briquets" (as the Russians call it) of the chemical
Lithium Perchlorate, LiClO4, or sometimes Magnesium
Biperchlorate, Mg(ClO4)2. 

Twenty cassettes are inside a generator container which has
an 8.5-watt fan (ventilator), a dust collector, and a filter.
When heated with a small amount of solid fuel, the chemical
decomposes into Lithium (or Magnesium) Chlorate plus Oxygen.
The oxygen admixes to the air being blown through the generator
by the fan. Each cassette generates 600 liters of oxygen (i.e.,
about what one person needs for a day), and it takes a cassette
about five to twenty minutes to decompose."

So remember...when your life support has been shot to pieces,
"\'Tis better to light a candle then to curse the darkness".

Problem: If skill levels are supposed to range from 0 to 15 in T4.1 (to put
them on par with stats), then a professional level in a skill ought to be
6+. There would be almost no professionals with Broker-1.

Consider: you go to Merchant Academy for four years, graduating with, say,
Broker-2 and Trader-2. You enlist in the Merchants, automatically getting
another Broker (Business). Let\'s say you serve three terms, getting a
commission and two promotions, thus you get about fifteen more skill rolls.
If you concentrate a lot of rolls on the Career and Social tables (but not
exclusively), you could get about four more levels of Broker. At rank 02
you automatically get another Broker (Business).

Thus, by age 34 you\'ve got Broker-8. Now _that\'s_ a professional level of
skill. Anybody with Broker-1 is just dabbling.

If you totally geek out and take only Broker at the academy, and roll on
the Career and Social tables at every opportunity, you can easily end up
with Broker-13 or more. After only three terms of service. Imagine an
eight-term Senior Captain who retires to run a brokerage house; he\'ll have
Broker-15 or whatever is the maximum allowed.

While we\'re on the topic, *is* there a maximum skill level in T4.1? The
draft I\'ve got doesn\'t mention one.

The point is that your Broker table, above, looks like a holdover from the
CT/MT era. If *specialization* skill levels are going to be so much higher
in T4, such rules are going to have to be radically rethought. This applies
to every similar rule in every supplement and rule book. A lot of old rules
aren\'t going to work any more.

True enough.  It makes me feel a bit guilty slamming it; but on the other
hand... well...  anyway.  There *were* a number of good touches in it, I
thought.  Ambiguity about whether the ship\'s builder may have been "in
cahoots" with the Badness from the start, for example.  Having
African-American characters who weren\'t mere two-dimensional cutouts, but
full-fledged three-dee stock figures was quite a step forward, too.  It
made a better horror film than a sci-fi film, I thought.  The tech was just
window-dressing.  The problematic grav drive could just as easily have been
your standard "dusty tome of forbidden knowledge."  _Terminator_ or _The
Reflecting Skin_ is more "science/horror" to my mind.

I\'ve met a couple of ambulance drivers, who probably aren\'t representative
of the field, but knowing them did leave me unsurprised at this move.

Actually, I liked that -- they were at least trying to mess with *some* of
our preconceptions about the genre.  I just wish they hadn\'t messed with
our preconceptions about acceleration, for example.

Let\'s be fair: *was* an experimental vessel, after all.  There were some

I think you meant Frontier wars, not "4th and 5th Rim Wars."

While I agree that FFW was a fun game, and were it fought with HIGH
GUARD rules the Zhodani would have gotten a pasting (for some of the
reasons posted here recently about HG).  I also recognize, that of _all_
the boardgames published for Traveller, FFW (due to it\'s immediate
proximity in the house campaign) needed to be a little closer to keep
us all on on our feet.

I agree about the value of J-6.  Also, even in 1110, the Imperium staple
was J-4 ships (see Fighting Ships, CT S9, and Spinward Marches Campaign).
Another reason AHLs might be of value for their unusually longer legs.

See Hans\' post about Steve Higginbotham\'s analysis of HIGH GUARD at the
TL 14/15.  I did the same analysis and it is a 3:1 advantage, which is
significant.

We don\'t have sector stats on a third of the Solomani Sphere.  The only
in the remaining two thirds of the Sphere that portrays your view of the
Sphere is the Solomani Rim, witness Diaspora, Daibei, Old Expanses,
Magyar, and Alpha Crucis (some say Alpha Leonis).

Just for averages, assume that the entire nine sectors of the Sphere
are twice as populous as the average Third Imperial sector (which the
sector data do not bear out).  That makes the Sphere about equal in
population, hence production, as the Third Imperium.

Then, the Imperium _still_ has a 3:1 advantage over the Solomani, and
I:E states that the Imperium was _prepared_ for the conflict having
reinforced the border.

Yes, the Solomani managed to puncture the front lines, but it was by no
means a breakthrough.  This is where I contend that those brave TL15
marines bought it.

Well now, I wouldn\'t spend so much time on it if everyone agreed with me,
now would I. <G>  It is not wishful.  The only wishful was that more thought
was put into publishing the background of this game, especially since it
is so important to people.  That is by no means a flame, but it is also
clear to me that part of the problem we "laymen" have in interpreting this
stuff is to sort all of that out.  Novels are written by one, maybe two
authors, occasionally three.  Traveller has _never_ been that way.

Are you saying that this TL15 threshold happened all at once?  Suddenly,
we wake up and the headlines read "Imperium now able to build TL15", so
start construction.  I don\'t think so.

That is one way to look at it, and mine was another.  I am trying to have
a discussion of "future canon".  I am looking at Traveller background holes
(fill more holes, fill more holes, fill more holes, fill more holes)
and trying to see what the potential is, where the general (though not
unanimous) response has been "There\'s no hole here."  I just have to
disagree.

Well, we know how many TL16 worlds there are in the Third Imperium c.1120,
and nobody is calling it a TL16 Third Imperium.  That leaves a lot of room
for my interpretation. (Yes, and there were a few sectors not visited by
the Digest Group, but that changes nothing on this point.)

Then Steve is in perfect agreement with me.  I did the TL14/15 analysis
a long time ago and I can confirm the 3/1 advantage.  It all comes down
to powerplant size as the difference between the two levels.

I have not done the 12 to 9 numbers, and that size range gets complicated
there because the numbers I stated above are _MAXIMUM_ sizes for the
purported TL9 Terrans and TL11 Vilani.  This is using CT High Guard rules.

So what did I miss in your statement?  It seems that we agree.


>Nor is \'a bunch of Terrans\' the proper appelation

Correct.

Forget I said "a bunch of Terrans", because I was not trying to imply
anything by it.


>for the combined forces of the whole Solomani Sphere. And in any case, the
>Imperial forces would not be solid TL 15... or even borderline TL 15.


Same with Solomani forces.  The game\'s counter mix bear that out.  That
just reinforces my point.  If there were few TL15 ground troops on both
sides, they could have been eliminated much earlier in the war.

Hans, that is _exactly_ what I have been doing.  As a review, because I know
how hard it is to keep up with the TML, even on digests.

                         RoM TL12                                RoM TL15+

miscellaneous               -                                       x


As my previous post says, I can see it going either way, but there is just
more ideas that convince me it is a higher value than not.  Yes, then I
shift into a mode of assume the hypothesis is and test for True/False, which
is what I have been doing, along with examining (under a microscope) the
rules for support either way.  I think the support is there.

While boardgames are certainly a source of insight, the core rules (BB 1-8)
are more telling.

That is not the reinforcing I was speaking of.  I was saying that I:E
does not reinforce any TL for Terra, until 1107.

And that is why I say that the few that would have been deployed quite
probably would have been shot up after a decade of war.  The stand at Earth
is the _last_ thing of the War.

Odd because that is not the case.  The GDW source says that TL15 worlds are
rare, but the frontier along the Third Imperium at a mere TL14 is reasonable
since the _unmoveable center_ is around Earth, in the former worlds of the
OEU (and Yes, their TL could be due to the Imperium having advanced them,
but could also have been because they were all along.)


>This seems somewhat implausible to me. The preponderance of evidence really

I think I said that earlier if you rely merely upon CT sources, which is
what this has been about (mostly recently).  Since CT made the Sphere +1,
a consistent canon says treat I:E at +1 TL, which as has been shown here
does fit.  (Hmmm, maybe I was too hard on the "incompatibilty" notion.)

Marc,

When you begin reviewing the combat rules please give consideration to
revamping them into a square grid format (say, something similar to
MAYDAY or Azhanti high Lightning\'s systems). I realize that you are
attempting to keep the basic rules simple but I don\'t believe that a
change like this would add all that much complexity and will make it
much easier fro those of us that LIKE miniature combat. This was one of
the major complaints I\'ve had since T1 (CT) came out in the 70\'s, that
is until the above named suppliments (games) came out. Thanks for any
consideration you give to this suggestion.

Not quite. We could have a situation very much like that I once had
with a stock broker. The broker\'s assistant invariably was the one
with whom I dealt and that person was useless. So, you find a broker
but that person\'s apprentice is doing the deal for you.

You\'re welcome, Rob. 

I\'ve been working on an expanded version of the LBB Trade chart (145
entries, running from -15 to 130, using a d100 with modifiers to access the
trade items.  I\'m coming from the POV that almost anything *could* be
available, but quantity, quality and cost is going to vary based on where
you are. ;->

Yep, that about sums it up.

Imperium Games is hellishly behind schedule on alot of things.  Going to the
Better Business Bureau, if they can do anything for you, can only cause more
trouble than its worth.  I\'ll bet that Imperium games will get to the
Citizens of the Imperium deal as soon as possible.

You\'re dealing with a small company, not a massive multi-tentacled
conglomerate.  Please don\'t screw them (and us) like this.

   This is incorrect.  We know that the Imperial Army and Marines were
equipped with the Trepida grav tank and its APC sister vehicle at the
start of the Rebellion (1116), and that these were *standard* AFVs
(meaning that they are the most numerous type).  Both vehicles were TL
14, *not* TL 15.  It would therefore be logical to conclude that the
First Solomani Rim War (which occured over 100 years earlier) was fought
between two opponents that had TL 14 ground forces (space forces being
another matter).

   Your assumption is that the Terrans were fighting the largest Vilani
warships, which IIRC was not the case early on.   Just as the U.S.
didn\'t throw its full weight into the Vietnam War, the Vilani held out
its best forces.

>Sorry, but it is clear to me, that Terra was TL15+ at the outset of the

   Actually this is possible, since Terra was the capital of the
Solomani Confederation (IIRC, Zhodane is one TL higher than the rest of
the Consulate).  The loss of Terra would then leave the Confederation
without a TL 15 world--a devastating blow, which would give further
support to the reasoning of Imperial commanders that Terra must be
captured.

   Once again, for whatever reason (probably the cost of replacing
equipment), the Third Imperium was fielding TL 14 equipment for its
ground forces in 1116, even though there were clearly many worlds that
were TL 15.

   What was the name of that world?

   This fits nicely with establish canon.  I\'m not sure what the problem
is here.  While it is possible that the Imperium and Solomani had some
TL 15 commandos or other small elite formations, at the scale the game
is conducted, they would not have been a factor in the fighting (or
would have been lumped in with a lower tech formation).

   Wrong...and well, by now *everybody* knows the rest.

   It is entirely consistent for Terra to be early TL 15 in 1000, TL 11
during the Long Night, TL 12 during the RoM, and TL 10-12 during the
Interstellar Wars.

   If this is the best you can do for evidence to support a higher TL
for the RoM, I\'m going to have to insist that you take a Deductive Logic
course while attending university.

   While I:E provides us some clues to the TL of Terra c. 1000, it is
not even remotely a valid source of information for TL info on the RoM. 
Far too much time had passed between the two eras.

   While the UN is currently not much more than a debating and posturing
club, there are some things that it does with regard to air safety and
health care issues where it is a significant positive influence.

   So NATO saves Earth?  Hmmm...that scenario is too Western-centric for
my tastes, and I\'m an unabashed running dog American imperialist who
listens to too much Rush Limbaugh and G. Gordon Liddy (Prepare to be
culturally assimilated.  Resistance is futile.  :-)  ).

   I would prefer to think that after the turn of the century, the UN
evolves into something a bit more potent.  IIRC, the canon sources
indicate that by discovering jump drive, the UN is finally able to
obtain finanical independence and assert itself without worrying about
certain nations withholding funds and blackmailing it into doing their
bidding.

Too many people shoot from the hip on this stuff. Imperium told you an answer
(delay due to UPS). Sure, they ordered the color printer before the strike,
and it hadn\'t come by the time of the strike, and now its delayed.

Really, the choice is up to you... 

If you think Imperium Games is lying to you, cancel your order and have them
reverse the charges.

If you think they are telling the truth, but don\'t want the Citizens stuff,
then cacenl and have them reverse the charges.

If you want what they say they\'ll send you, then wait for it. Or even tell
them you really want it, so hurry.

But I\'m really tired of the Imperium bashing that the net and the TML seems
to love to do.

I\'ll share what I said at GenCon at least twice...

When GDW closed its doors (announced later 1995; accomplished by Feb 29,
1996), Traveller reverted to me. I talked with four potential publishers. One
figured they would have a new rules book oiut by GenCon 1997 (right, this
year), and maybe one module per year thereafter. Another had just bought an
out-of-print fantasy role-playing game and was looking for a science-fiction
title to round out their line. Yet another wanted to buy the rights so they
could own the potential for electronic games, but really didn\'t want to put
out a print version.

And Imperium stepped up to the plate, offered lots of support and planned on
getting a revised version out by GenCon 1996 (they did it; in some ways only
barely, but they did it). The also planned on at least one module per month
thereafter, and they did that, despite a change in management half way
through the production cycle.

Where would we be if Imperium had not stepped forward? While meaning no
criticism of other operations at all (indeed, Tantalus sponsors this mailing
list), we would be where 2300 AD is... not in print.

There are things I wish were different. I am personally revising T4 into T41
(and many don\'t agree with my decisions, but I promise you it will be worth
the wait). Many people are participating in the revamp of T4 and in the
publication of the upcoming T4 products.

BTW flagella@concentric.net is Courtney Solomon\'s right-hand person and is
dedicated to handling all of the problems that come up the best they can be.

I spoke some time ago with one of my former partners and he talked about how
genteel and understanding everyone on his particular mailing list was... why
aren\'t we at that point too?

How may people on the List actually play out ship to ship combat during
role play sessions? Graig Berry touched on my  point in his reply in TML
1997, referring to a play group being hauled over by a dreadnaught,
while in a 200 ton ship. To paraphrase (some more) he basically said
that the ship was to big for them to fight.
I\'ve DL\'ed Joe Hech (and several others)\'s role playing combat system
and with a few exceptions like waht i\'ve read in it (time permitting
I\'ll get to read the rest in the near future). I hope the update it for
FFS2.
I also like to make star ship deck plans, building plans, etc. and I
like them to be consistant, which is one of the reasons I\'ve like
Traveller, and enjoyed  Highguard, Trillion Credit Squadron, etc. FFS
was a bit different from earlier works but an excellent addtion
(particularly the alternate tech, sadly, from what I\'ve read, missing in
the new book). But I\'ve never used the Basic Traveller (CT) star shi
combat system!
I missed Brilliant Lances (it came and went during a non-gaming period
for me) and the basic Traveller rules were too basic for my group. We
did quite a bit of TCS,(Kinda the En Guard of the Traveller universe)
but when I reff\'ed Traveller, a role playing game, the groups I\'ve had
over the years were more interested in role playing (ie "what\'s
happening to me?") than breaking a role play session up mixed with war
gaming. When we war gamed space combat (not often, usually these
sessions were WW2 armour or sea combats) we gamed with large units that
didn\'t have any role playing elements.
Any way, as I asked before rambling on (I\'m tired! sorry). How many
actually run the combats during a role play session, how many just hand
wave them off, and how many run ship to ship combat as, basically a
seperate game (maybeor maybe not involveing the ship thier role players
are on)? I really am curious to see what the answers to this question
look like.

Eris, I\'m surprised you didn\'t think of using hammocks (a la
Gilligan\'s Island).  With grav plates located in the floor, walls, and
ceiling, synchronized to alter gravity in a continuous loop (floor...
wall... ceiling... other wall... floor... wall.. etc.), you could get
yourself up to some pretty impressive speeds!  Of course, the
Skipper\'s hammock would have to include a reinforcing weave of
superdense...

Marc,

I\'ll toss my two cents in, something I have not done recently.

I have all but dropped off the list (though I still doggedly get it, I\'ve 
not read it seriously for several months...) because of the tone.  Everyone 
here seems to like traveller, or at least claims too, but it\'s so darn 
negative!  I caught myself on a serious attitude slide downward about T4, 
and almost got to the point where I couldn\'t understand why my players kept 
coming back!

And having fun...

That was the key for me, despite what the gearheads, and the rulelawyers, 
and the why-won\'t-it-play-like-life (as if I wanted to play a game true to 
life!), and the bash-the-[insert nationality here] types say...my players 
are enjoying themselves.  Am I playing true T4? No.  Have I ever played 
canon traveller?  Hey!  That\'s no too...  Does anyone care?  NO!

So, instead of contributing ideas (like I tried to do in the beginning), I 
watch for THUDD, new products, and gear.  I read from a select few authors 
(ones that I know promote positive feelings for the game, and/or 
constructive criticisms.  I (sadly) ignore the rest.

For my players, and my own enjoyment, I will not allow myself to get sucked 
into the whirlpool of IG bashing.  Hopefully, sometime soon, either a new 
list will spin off (I\'ve seen some calls for them) or the nay-sayers will 
feed themselves into oblivion and I will be able to read a whole digest 
without getting depressed.

By the way, I\'ve caught some of the new skills - I\'m going to have to go 
back over my archives to pull \'em all out!

How about the following:

Broker  Starport        Mod     Comm
Broker-8        A       +4      20%
Broker-6        AB      +3      15%
Broker-4        ABC     +2      10%
Broker-2        ABCD    +1       5%

For every _two_ full levels in Broker skill you may add 1 to the roll on
the Actual Value table (to a maximum of +4).  For every level of Broker
skill used the Broker will require a commision of 2.5%.  Half the
qommission ammount is the Brokers actual earning (1.25% of sale price
per level of skill applied) the other half of the Brokers fee is used
for expenses.

(Some earlier version of Traveller specified that half the Brokers fee
went towards expenses, this should probably be restated.)

   Basically my view is that while you can publish a lengthy essay from
the point of view of the pit bull terrier Lucan kept around for those
*special* executions, there is always some underlying truth we call
"reality", which is the what is really happening or has really happened
in the universe.  "Reality" is not dependent upon points of view--in
fact point of view frequently distorts "reality".

   In the days of CT, material published was pretty much "reality". 
There was very little point of view writing, and when there was it was
usually made clear that what was being expressed wasn\'t necessarily
true.  It was almost entirely up to the referee to generate material
that threw in distortions and caused ambiguity.

   This changed with MT.  Much of the material generated for MT was done
from the point of view of a particular faction, particularly the DGP
stuff.  However, when the point of view of a commentator excluded
information or distorted "reality", we were given a Referee\'s Section
that explained what was really true ("reality") and what wasn\'t.

   With TNE, there were a great number of subplots, some of which were
strongly hinted at, some of which it appeared were designed to be
mysteries.  There is still an underlaying "reality", but at times it
appears the only people who know what all the aspects of that *reality*
is are employed by GDW.  However, nothing that appears in print
contradicts what has been presented as "reality" before.

   This brings us to Marc Miller\'s Traveller.  Most things are relative,
as those writing MMT themselves are to a greater or lesser degree fuzzy
on what "reality" is in the Traveller universe.  Items are presented as
fact ("reality") even though they basically contradict previous material
(and even themselves).  This contradiction in what is "reality" and what
isn\'t causes a rift between those who play MMT and previous versions of
the game.  Leroy comes along and implies that "reality" has always been
relative, which is of course incorrect.

   My take on things is that publications like V&V are saved because
they include a section for referees that provides you with a check
against "reality".  Otherwise, as a referee you can\'t make a value
judgement about the information presented and it is useless.

>At the same time, I would argue that relativism is a fact of life, though
>it may be done better, with explanations in future work.  In that extent,
>I agree with Harold.  

   Only two groups of people *must* know what *reality* is--the game
writers and the referees.  The game writers must know because it is
necessary to tell a coherant, consistent story.  The referee must know
so that he or she can also tell a coherant story, whether it is based on
what the game writers tell him, his or her own work, or a combination
thereof.  Players can be treated like mushrooms (an old joke).  Point of
view stories provide players with material that allows them to "feel\'
the part of an alien (or not so alien) race, and "walk a mile in their
shoes."  

>So, I see relativism as a reality.

   This to me is a basic contradiction.  Unlike in real life, Truth
(that is philosophical Truth) is always knowable, provided that someone
puts it into print.  While it sometimes makes sense to withhold
information from players, even lie to them, to believe that this should
be extended to everyone is just plain wrong.

Harold

	*nod* I think that\'s about the best way to handle sex in gaming, 
unless a) there\'s something odd/weird/dangerous going on (the other 
person is a robot, is trying to kill the PC, or the PC just 
won\'t believe when told he\'ll hurt himself in zero-G etc.) and b) the 
subject is handled tastefully.

	Talking about sex: I have noticed a foreign society\'s reactions
to sexuality are a considerable factor when cooking up new cultures 
for Traveller. Try comparing ancient Greek, feudal Japan, Victorian 
England and the modern MTV-culture, just to give you an idea.

	Close your eyes and think of Vland. :)

I would also like to see a grid system return.  I think it would be
_vital_ that the scale used be the same used to _draw_ starship deck
plans.

This might make it possible to make a tabletop miniatures combat game. 
As Games Workshop has shown you can make a lot of money doing this if
you do it right.

Has anyone out there played Games Workshops Space Hulk (tabletop not
computer)?  I have always thought that Warhammer 40K\'s Space Marines
owed a sizeable debt to Travellers Imperial Marines in Battle Dress
(although they are both derived from Heinleins power armor in Starship
Troopers).  When I played the introductory scenario in which the Space
Marines were trying to make it off the giant derelict spaceship (or
Space Hulk)and were fighting off the Genestealers (nasty Alienlike
aliens) it seemed strongly reminiscent of the Azhanti High Lighting
Scenario in which the Marines are trying to get off the damaged ship
before it sinks into the gas giants atmosphere and they have to fight
off the blobs that inhabit the gas giant.

Now I happen to think GW\'s games are a bit pricy but I would love to see
something similar for Traveller.  Tabletop Minis games are very visual
and look cool.  This would help in marketing Traveller.  I think that a
tabletop game with half a dozen Imperial Marines in TL15 Powered Battle
Dress against a dozen TL 14 Zhodhani Consular Guard teleport specialists
with combat armor (T4\'s unpowered Battle Dress would be fun to play and
great to get people into Traveller.  I suspect it would be a wee bit
expensive to develop but we can dream.  I see a point based system for
assembling balanced forces and a new Army Codex (er Alien Forces Guide)
every few months or so.  The boxed game would be $70 or so & feature the
Imperial Marines vs Zhodhani mentioned above.  (I picked Zhodhani
because they have a good visual look and their psionic powers would make
for an interesting game but if we want this to be a Milieu 0 game I
guess we would have to pick someone else.)  Naturally this game would be
supported by lots of pretty looking expensive 28mm pewter miniatures.
 
After marketing this minis game for a few years (while regularly raising
the prices for them) Imperium Games would stop making the Traveller RPG
and concentrate only on Traveller: Space Combat.  Then they would set up
their own chain of retail stores, which only sold Traveller materials. 
The Journal of the Travellers Aid Sociey would go to full color and
gradully morph into an add for this months new miniatures.  Then a
little while after that they would decide that none of the distributors
really understood them and start going direct to all the stores.  Their
prices would continue to rise during this whole time.  But I guess
nothing like this could ever happen, it is too improbable, right ?  :)

    Terrans have at their disposal (for ships up to 4,900 tons):

       Lasers, Missiles, and Sandcasters turret-mounted,
         factor-6 PA 100-ton bays, factor-7 Missile 100-ton bays

       No Spinal Mounts are available to the Terrans.

       Max Jump is J-1, Max Maneuver is M-6, Max Armor is 9 and A-9 requires
         40% of the ship

    Conclusions:  The Terrans, if using nuclear weapons (No dampers to defend
       with at TL11) have the best chance at forcing the Vilani to disengage
       do to battle reduction of all weapons, which would require 78 Wpn-1
       hits, though disengagement would probably happen sooner than that,
       though with Ersha\'s Armor, it could wait until then if needed.  The
       tactical situation would also depend on whether or not it was fueled
       at the start of the battle or not.

    The Ersha mounts a factor-K PA Spinal Mount.  Against Terran ships at
       armor factor-6 (30% of ship), the automatic critical hits are
       reduced to zero, and the Spinal Mount would get only 5 rolls (2 rolls
       if the Terran ships are A-9) on the SE/Rad damage tables with only
       armor as a +DM.  Even against A-9, the Terrans can not defend against
       Maneuver drive hits, which in turn reduce agility, which makes it
       easier to hit, ...

  Perhaps the Vilani only have big ships as well.  Their Consolidation Wars
may have evolved smaller ship designs ala what the Terrans are forced to
deal with.  It could also be that since the Vilani are the biggest on the
block, they would not use too many of the "Ersha" class.  I just ran this one
off to give us an idea of what the flagship of the Fleet might look like.
It is pretty well optimized.

  (Unfortunately, a certain mailing list has been keeping me busy, so I will
have to visit the T4 rules later. <G> IIRC, it looks similar to High Guard in
some ways.)

Yes, this is a *very* big problem.  I still don\'t like the idea that an

usual comments on the different designs - sorry!  However, here are some
comments, based on the designs I have seen so far.


What makes for a superior TL-10 SDB?

1) An airframe hull that allows it to manuever and hide in gas giants and
oceans.

2) Good acceleration to allow it to choose the range of engagement, and
enough g-hours to put the acceleration capacity to use (the more the
better). The capacity should be higher than g-comp, allowing emergency
manuevers. 

3) Defense systems, either good armor or sandcasters.

4) Lots of missiles, but more importantly, the ability to control those
missiles - ideally enough MFD capacity to control a launch spread.

5) Some other sort of weapon system (other than missiles) that allows the
engagement of small targets at lower cost, and the ability to engage in
combat when missiles are fully expended.

6) The best sensor system money can buy - SDBs operate alone most of the
time, and they need to have good systems to find the enemy and decide what
to do (fight or flight).


  My Generica design takes the above factors into account - the best of
the other designs do as well.  I urge you to consider the above when
evaluating the various designs for your ballots.

No, I\'m not saying that.  I want skills to be about the same as they 
were in CT, ranging from 0-6 or so.

But, I want them to contribute to the overall success of the task 
roll about as much as characteristics contribute to success.  

Either 1 skill level is worth more than 1 stat level, or stats are 
worth less than skills, level per level.

  If this becomes the case, I would

Right.  I\'m taking the opposite side.  I have no love of the 
modifier, but I\'d like to keep Traveller skill levels like they were 
in CT and MT.  I don\'t want another animal like TNE where skills are 
on a different scale.

I have no love of the multiplier, but in my book it beats having a 
whole new definition of skill levels.

In short, I want T4 to be a suped up version of CT--let\'s only change 
what needs changing and leave the rest alone.

	I do - just last sunday, the 400-ton trader Iola Violante was 
attacked by a 800-ton pirate-operated trader when leaving the Min 
system. Fortunately, the ship\'s gunner (your friendly SolSec 
monitor) managed to kill the two incoming missiles, and the pirate 
was later destroyed by a Coast Guard cutter.

Nope.  I like it.  But it does make play cumbersome.  ;-(  "Will sacrifice 1/2 
die for peace and quiet, and or food."  I\'m ambivalent, and I\'ve missed the 
last few months of this argument (it doesn\'t sound as if it\'s changed any).

Really?  Throw in another die.  It\'s the perception of "a chance" that\'s more 
important than the chance itself... to players.  Heh.  I prefer "really rough" 
tasks.  It makes PCs think more, rather than just \'roll \'n burn\'.

I\'m in the "stats are your friend" camp, but I\'m willing to negotiate.  (Is it 
me, or has this debate been won by the old fogies in favor of \'experience\' over 
prowess?  I leave for a couple months, and gee...  ;-)  What I do NOT want to

There should be...  What was wrong with INT+EDU is maximum "efficient" (on tap) 
skill memory?  It seems we cling to the barrel of the canon, only to throw out 
important little springs.  Hmmm.

If we have to bow in the direction of age (experience) before ability...  Let\'s 
just run up the skill levels instead of formulae.  Otherwise, let\'s keep the 
status quo.  It sounds as laise faire (sp?) as it gets.

Oh, and while we\'re on the topic of tasks anyway, how about a codified manner 
to use XP as modifiers to tasks, a la 007?

I played in a game like that, all the players had one character on the command
crew of a ship, and another character that was part of the "away team".
It works really well with experienced role-players. The captain of the ship
got to play a low down grunt in the away team and the ships gunner got to play
the marine commander.

There are ways of avoiding this problem, you can use already established 
characters in the campaign, these tend to have well defined personalities 
and so players can avoid the problems of characters "merging".
If this is not possible try starting each player with one character and 
adding second (or third.....) slowly, after about 5 sessions.

Another thing to try is to let players play some of the minor NPC\'s in the 
game. Let them play a bartender, shopkeeper or starport official. Just give 
them a note with the characters rough personality and let them do the work for
you. It gives you time to check a few things in your notes/rulebooks and is
a handy way of getting players involved in the session even if their
characters 
aren\'t.

You\'re going to hear screams from the "don\'t change from skill 1 to 6
crowd," but it looks pretty good to me. ;->  I\'ve been thinking about just
expanding the tables so you can keep the mod to skill 1 to 1, and lowering
the commission to 3%/level.  There\'s nothing wrong with a +8 or even +10 in
a roll on a table..if the table is broad enough and handles mods that
exceed the table max.

Was it Sandy or Greg? The Glorantha list is probably one of the nicest lists
I\'ve ever had the pleasure of reading. No product bashing at all (they 
currently have a setting now but no rules at all) just good discussion &
debate.
Sometimes I wish this list could be a bit more moderate - when it\'s good its
great but when its bad its appauling!

I\'ve gotten a great deal out of the last few releases. Even FS - without  it
quite a few of us wouldn\'t be enjoying trying to fix the data - and I hazard a
guess that even if the data had been good people still wouldn\'t\'ve been happy
about their own favourite sub-sector.

I\'m still awaiting FF&S2 to arrive in the UK (the UPS strike I guess) but
reading between the lines it also looks like a good product albeit for
gearheads - Okay it doesn\'t do everything by all accounts but what supplements
do? 

When all the CT & the early MT stuff came out this list wasn\'t in existence, if
it was I suspect most of the products would\'ve been bitched about, its only in
hindsight that they\'re classics now.


Its not a case of giving IG a chance, they\'re our last best hope :-) for
traveller. With the time and capital invested in traveller, if this one fails I
doubt anyone else will take it up at least for a good long while, so lets stop
worry about how crap IG are and concentrate on helping Marc make this
incarnation the best it possibly can. Andy, Stu, Doug etc didn\'t bitch about it
they wrote their own stuff and were rewarded by being offered the chance to
develop proper products, presumeably the ones they wanted to buy.

Anyway I\'ve finished mildly venting!

BTW this is all written with a huge smiley all over it (apart from the slight
sigh at the beginning). :-)

[snipped  - my definition of history]

   I\'d certainly agree this in real life.  However, in Traveller I\'d be
   slightly more inclined to give characters a chance to manipulate
   whole societies, in the pattern of Poul Anderson\'s Trader Team et al.
   or Jerry Pournelle\'s Falkenberg novels.  (I didn\'t say it would be
   easy!)  Not that one roll on History skill would enable you to start
   a revolution, but it might tell you *how* to start one.

I see your point, and I think that, on reflection, my definition of the
history skill was a little too oriented
toward the academic study of history rather than the pragmatic type of
skill you rightly suggest is of
interest to the average Traveller player.
     However, I still balk at the analogy between psychology and history -
it just does\'nt stand
up. I think history should remain a knowledge skill, so the recall
historical analogy task is fine, but
the manipulate government task is way off, and I think there are two good
Traveller-based  reasons
for asserting this:

1: Marc can correct me if I\'m wrong, but the derivation of the
psychohistory aspect of the traveller
background - the psioincs suppressions - is Isaac Asimov\'s Foundation
series. I cannot claim to
have ever read these books (shame on me) but I have read that a
psychohistorical manipulation
forms the meta-plot of the series. Psychohistory in these books is a
statistical and public relations
based science, requiring access to vast amounts of census and other types
of data and
absoloute secrecy concerning the manipulation - or the experiment itself
affects the outcome. I\'d say
this is a fairly good footing on which to keep psychohistory in Traveller -
 there is a world of difference
between psychohistory defined thus, and the outcome of the machinations
(albeit political) of a group
of player characters.

2: Psychohistory has a well established place in the traveller canon - the
Hivers are masters of this
science in the proud tradition of Niven\'s Pierson\'s Puppeteers. The fact
that the 3I failed to
manipulate it\'s population and the status of manipulation as the Hiver\'s
very own analog of the star
trigger (more subtle, though) is a good argument for confining
psychohistory to the realm of
government and other ultra-resourceful agencies. In other words, this is a
technology beyond the
abilities of the Imperium that serves to define the \'flavour\' of a central;
 alien race, so making it a
readily available ability under the history skill diverges from \'canon\'.

Of course, there\'s no reason why players cannot be caught up in a
manipulation, but I\'d say a
project of this type is beyond the ken of a single individual or a handful
of individuals. You\'d get a
damned good scenario or even campaign out of it though - the truth could
rapidly get lost in a
situation where shadowy figures pull strings behind the scenes, kinda like
the X-Files meets
traveller.

It really could be any.  But I know California seems to be polarizing
North and south (so a split could happen).  Colorado seems to have similar
rumblings (east and west slope).  Purto Rico has been a topic for
statehood off and on over the past 20 years so it could happen in the next
50 years.  The last state, who knows.  I was thinking in terms of Guam,
but it could easily be Canadian or Mexican Border states.  Also, the
Bahamas or the Virgin Islands are not out of the question.

Agreed.  I think that the distinction between Minor and Potential might be
confusing, which I was using to distinguish the two.  As an aside note, a
lot of the 3rd world entrance is a bit unreal, but I\'m trying to get as
many nations involved to increase the possibilities for the second half
of the century. (I\'m using fusion power as a hand wave to bring some of
these nations into the game.)

As far as I know there is no published map of Porozlo. There are a few
adventures in Book 4: Mercenary and 101 Patrons, however, which provide
names for some of the nations and political parties on that rather besieged
planet.

If you\'re interested in a New-Era take on Porozlo, you may want to read my
description of the planet at my web site:

I take into account all canonical information I could find and I try to
describe some of the geography as well.

By any chance, was there a great deal of alcohol involved in this
conversation?  ;-)

The TML has long been a very useful resource for me, and become a sort of
comfortable old friend.  Unfortunately, its the sort of friend who is a bit
unstable, and who you keep locked in the cellar when company comes over,
lest he do something unsightly and embarrasing.

In reality, the IG-bashing seems to be in two forms:  Legitimate (IMHO)
concerns/complaints over IG project management blunders, and pointless
grousing about IG business practices/policies.  The first I see as
legitimate because several people who do project work for IG are on the
TML.  The second I see as pointless as IG management is not part of the
TML; these sorts of issues would be better brought up with IG management.
Despite the various complaints, I have seen a marked improvement in IG
products, but I don\'t think its fair to expect a 180 degree turnaround in
only six months.

And of course, there is also the general griping/whining that the T4 system
or its components are not exactly what person X wanted, and how that is the
result of some evil plot by the TMl and the techo-gearhead elite.  These
don\'t seem to be attacks on IG so much as attacks on TML folks who have
worked hard on some IG projects (ref. IG project management blunders
above).

In any event, I was wondering when somebody associated with IG was going to
say something about all this.  If you had waited another day, I would have
won the office pool!

I\'m throwing my hat in with Eris on this one. T4(.1) is *not* CT. Many
things are similar, but character generation is quite different (and
better, imho).

The greatest (only?) determining factor of how much value is placed on a
skill level is the character generation process. Marc has clearly
decided that skill levels should be given out a little more easily.
Since that is the case, skills need to be rated more highly. Skill def
*needs* changing. Witness the Entertainer  and Scholar careers.

What really needs to be done is for Mark to *clearly* spell out, in
T4.1, exactly what skill levels roughly correspond to in the real world.
Things like the Broker table, and other throwbacks to the old rating
system, need to be revised. I believe that if a limit is placed on
characteristics, one needs to be placed on skills, too.

T4.1 *needs* a definition of skill levels. I think it should be new.
After all, the entire task system is new, why shouldn\'t the skill level
definition be changed to fit the task system? The system is different,
lets not limit ourselves by nostalgia...

Descriptions something like:

Skill-1     Novice. Basic familiarity with the application of the skill.
            Normally, professional employment not possible.

Skill-2     Trained. Minimum level for professional employment.
            Character is still considered a beginner.

Skill-4     Proficient. Character is considered competant in his craft.
            Most professionally employed people using this skill possess
            this skill level.

Skill-6     Expert. Character is an expert in her field. She commands a 
            higher wage when professionally employed for her skill.

Skill-8     Master. Those possessing this skill level consistantly
outperform
            most others with the skill. Those seeking only the best hire
            these people.

Skill-10    Virtuoso. Character known to be the at the top of the field,
            perhaps even becoming famous. Realm of the Einsteins,
Trumps,
            Pavarottis, Scottys, Van Goughs...

     Although it might seem a skill more appropriate in Call of Cthulhu
than Traveller at first glance, there is a lot of adventuring \'rope\' to be
had in archaeology in the traveller background. A good fictional example is
Jack MacDevitts novel Engines of God, the central characters in this are
archaeologists investigating an ancient menace that threatens an
interstellar human society through the archaelogical remains of fallen
alien cultures - a great plot and some nice locations, but a fairly weak
ending.

In traveller terms I\'d define archaeology skill as:

The character is experienced in the analysis of past and prehistoric
cultures through the excavation and study of their material remains. The
character has a chance of identifying the age and origins of ancient
artifacts, writings, or architecture and can form hypotheses about aspects
of a culture based on the evidence of these material remains. As with the
history skill, the character may specialize in one or more races, cultures,
regions, or historical periods.

Marc,

Let me say thank you for your dedication in making sure that T41 is
everything that we hope for.  I especially aprreciate you coming to us for
or opinions and advice; after plying Traveller for 20 years, it\'s nice to
be able to contribute.

At this point I think that only a few of us are really mad at IG.  Most of
us are still a little upset over things like Starships and the First
Survey/M:0 fiasco, but that\'s in the past.  The recent releases have proven
to be much better.

At the risk of sounding like Kenneth, I hope you\'ll take a look at my
combat system when I get it posted, I think it would be an asset for T41

It depends.  If the combat is important to the plot of the campaign, and
everyone seems ready to "ride to the trumpts", I\'ll haul out Brilliant
Lances and we\'ll get down and dirty.  If the combat is incidental, or if
the players don\'t seem enthused by the prospect, I\'ll use the RPSC system
or just handwave a quick encounter.

That was my game, and the reaction was exactly what I had intended.  I
needed the players to realize that this was like challenging the USS
Nimitiz and her battle group in a 24\' sailboat.

It\'s a good system.  If the ship is an important "character" in the game (A
scout game where repair yards are non-existant, for example) I\'d suggest
using a more detailed system (BL or a varient.. something is sure to be
written for T41.)

Craig and I used Mayday extensively way back when.. (Craig, did I ever tell
you what fianlly happened to your old desk?)  It was a system that I could
understand  and use as a young player.

That is a problem.. the turn scale makes role play difficult.  There was
even a Murphy\'s Rules way back at the beginning about the low rate of
Traveller fire.  This does make running combat and keeping it tinteresting
a challenge for the GM.  But from conversations with Navy types, especially
submariners, it seems that this is the way high-tech combat is fought..
long periods of hunting followed by minutes of terror as the weapons burn
towards their targets.  

A good model for the referee in running space combat might be movies like
"The Hunt for Red October" and the recent HBO original "Deadly Waters" (?)

On a related note, why is it that there is not a comprehensive book on
technology other than arms, armor, power plants, and vehicles (AAP&V)? FF&S
only dabbled outside of these spheres, and the various item lists in books
like MT\'s Imperial Encyclopedia are very limited and quite conservative in
scope (at least that\'s how they seem to me).

Perhaps this bias towards things that move around and blow up other things
has similar origins to the reason that magazines like "Hot Rodding" and
"Guns and Ammo" are popular. Or maybe it has to do with the assumption that
combat, being the most chaotic of situations, needs the most comprehensive
rules.

Personally, I\'d like to see a book on alternative technology -- not the
"alternative technology" of solar sails and Dean Drives, but the technology
that deals with things other than AAP&V. Things that impact on the everyday
lives of characters. You know, that 90%+ of the time that the PCs aren\'t
shooting or being shot at? I know that the ideas are out there -- the
interesting thread on zero-G beds (among others) has shown that.

After all, we have, what, five or so ship combat systems and a similar
number of AAP&V construction systems? How about a book on all the other
stuff?

I have completely selfish reasons to ask this. One of the biggest problems
I have had in running a good sf game was the lack of such support. Being
none to creative myself, I had a hard time conveying to my players what it
would be like to live in a future-tech society. What are the convieniences
available to a person living at TL 13? Do refrigerators still use freon?
Are there sonic showers, or do you bring (or make) a bunch of water into
space for showers? For that matter, what *is* a sonic shower? Would it
sound wierd?

I already know 80 ways to kill them. Give me something to make them marvel.

Yep, that\'s right.  I can see two ways of dealing with this.  The first
and simplest way would be to add more capacitors in parallel to 
increase the total capacitance.  This would lower the discharge 
rate, keeping the output voltage above the minimum voltage needed to run
the system.  The second way would be to have a voltage level sensing
controller that would be able to compensate for the voltage drop until
a minimum operating voltage is reached (where it simply shuts down due
to lack of voltage).  

I was going to go into energy densities of alkaline and ni-cad batteries,
but it\'s late and I\'ve got to get up early for work.  I\'ll try to take
this up tomorrow.

I thought I\'d pass on one part of the "Compleat Starport" article I
mentioned.

JAK pretty directly equates size with number of berths, and bases this
on population and starport type.

                   A    B   C/F  D/G  E/H
# dice to roll:   P-0  P-1  P-2  P-3  P-4   (P is UWP population digit)
Mod to each roll:  +1   0    0    -1   -2

The result is the # of berths for the world.  If there is an orbital
port, the GM chooses how many are in orbit; if there are multiple ports
on the world, 50% of berths are allocated to ports with the UWP port
class; 25% to ports of the next highest class; and 25%  to the rest.

I quite like this, but what it is missing that your suggestion had is
that it takes no account of traffic.  You wrote:

How about converting some of your modifiers to extra dice in JAK\'s
system (so, roll +1D if on an X-boat route)?

Not being up on military matters - how much does the presence of a naval
base affect the size of civilian ports in RL?  Personally I\'d give it a
+1 at most, but am willing to stand corrected.

I\'m not sure of the best way to deal with neighbours, but I definitely
think it should take their starports into account; therefore I prefer
your second formula.  It would be nice to give extra credit to worlds
sharing a Jump-1 "main" with the target world, and to have a "trailing
off with distance" effect rather than a 2-parsec cutoff, but I can\'t
think of anything that isn\'t way too complicated.

To be honest, I think I do have an article (from the Trav Chronicle, 
I think), but I didn\'t remember it until you just mentioned it.

I use so little of the TNE stuff (and I have a lot of it) because it 
is so different from CT/MT/T4.

Out of sight, out of mind.

Yes, I love this book (used it last night to produce a map of Zila), 
but that section is very vague.  I do use the info though.  This 
governs what can be imported (Novelty TL).

That\'s easy to do using my chart.  If you divide from the chart, you 
get more expensive items.  If you multiply from the chart, you get 
less expensive items.

If you, as a GM, decide that a lower tech item that the PCs are 
looking for is an antique and not readily available on the world, 
then divide the TL factor instead of multipling the factor.  The item 
will become more expensive.

This is a good point (and the reason I like to read comments) that I 
hadn\'t thought about but easily fits into the system.

Wow, now that\'s high tech gaming!

You might be interested in Frank Chadwick\'s article from BJTAS#1.  It 
is a system similiar to my own (I based my tables on his work) that 
focusses on the buying power of an Imperial credit.

I thought it was too clumsy for my game, but with your computerized 
gaiming tools you would have no problem at all.  It basically 
converts all player money into local currency, then converts all 
items to be purchased into local currency so everything is on the 
same scale.  Then, when the players leave the planet, you convert 
back to Imperial standard credits.

I thought this was a little to much for my game (and so I came up 
with the charts), but it might be the thing (or the inspiration) that 
you are looking for.

  It makes the session go much more quickly when I

Sounds awesome!  I usually pre-roll this stuff before we play, but I 
can see the program save time in prep as well.

That\'s true, but it is a lot of work unless you are set up (like you 
are) with a computer during the game.

Boy, gaming has come a long way, hasn\'t it?

using the system.  The idea of antiques may not have occurred to them 
either.

See ya, Bill,

I think it is better, too, but still very compatible with 
CT--especially if you give CT era careers 1 skill per year instead of 
1 per 4 years.  You end up with very similar characters.

And I agree with this.  It is a good move.

But, I disagree here.

What I am saying is this.  Yes, having more skills is a good thing, 
but there are two ways to have more skills.

Let me illustrate with an example.  Let\'s say a character is in a 
career for 20 years.  By Marc\'s method, chargen gives him 20 skill 
levels.  You can divide up these skill levels in two ways.

You can (1):  have a character that ends up like this
              1 level 9 skill
              2 level 3 skills
              5 level 1 skills

Under this division, yes, you are right, skills need new definitions.


Or you can (2):  have a character with more skills than in CT, but 
each specific skill does not range over 6, like this
                1 level 5 skill
                2 level 3 skills
                2 level 2 skills
                10 level 1 skills

Under this second choice, your character has more skills, and still 
each specific skill does not go out of the classical range of 0-6.

In this way, T4 characters can have many more separate skills than a 
CT character, but comparing skill for skill, all T4 skills are 
interchangealbe with CT skills.

And the balance between the old and new is secured.

This is what I would like to see.

First, it\'s only a 3:1 advantage if you assume that *all* the imperial forces
are TL-15, which they certainly aren\'t; the imperium had *just barely*
started to transition to TL-15. 

I say again: if the Imperium had significant quantities of TL-15 troops, they
would have appeared in Invasion: Earth. No matter what was going on elsewhere,
invading Earth was the single most important land battle the Imperium was
going to fight in the Rim War. If they had TL-15 troops, they would have
included *some* of them there. Similarly, if Earth was TL-15, *some* of its
home defence troops would have been TL-15, and been present. 

Second - even if the Imperium had a 3:1 effective advantage, they couldn\'t 
deploy *everything* to the Rim; they had to keep enough forces present 
to deter the Zhodani, the Aslan, the Vargr, the K\'Kree...and this was the
period of the "crustal" Imperial strategy, where most forces were 
forward-deployed. 

Finally - the Imperium having a significant (perhaps 2:1) advantage is
perfectly consistent with the results to the war; the Imperium was on the
offensive - and you need an advantage to win if you\'re on the offensive; they
captured large amounts of territory (but not all they wanted), which is
basically consistent with the Imperium being slightly but not very much stronger
than the Solomani.

I notice you haven\'t addressed the absence of other TL-15 Solomani worlds in
1110 - did they absent-mindedly leave all their technological information 
on Sol while they were busy evacuating all their TL-15 troops to avoid
confusing future archeologists?

I admire your tenacity, Leroy...but try applying Occam\'s razor: in the
complete absence of TL-15 counters in I:E, the best explanation is that
neither side had significant TL-15 forces anywhere, not that they magically
shuffled all of them off. If nearly the whole Solomani Sphere in 1110 is
TL-14, the best explanation is that they were all TL-14 in 1000, not that 
they mysteriously slipped back.

Even *you* have to admit that the Imperium is ahead of the Sphere technologically
in 1100.l Why can\'t you admit that the same is true in 1000?

The problem with this is that GW has already established itself as the
reigning champion of tabletop games.  GW sells more tabletop games
than all of the miniature system companies *combined*.  Like
Microsoft, this kind of leverage has made it extremely difficult for
any other company to produce a competitive product.  Whether you like
GW games or not (I do not-- they often boil down to matches involving
one set of bizarre unit-specific rules pitted against another) it will
be extremely difficult to succeed in this market.

I actualy do play out the ship to ship combat durings sessions.  It has 
gotten a bit easier in T4 than in TNE which took all night!(look to see what 
direction the ship is facing, roll on the location table, roll for system 
hit, apply dammage, etc....) The RPSC System workds great for me.  For 
gaming puropses it is quick and details the RP aspects of ship combat.  I 
have used it many times and I can actualy visualise what each PC is doing, 
 like something out of a Star Trek scene:

Joe Ishugii wrenched the controls on the bridge of his Scout-Courier, 
managing to anticipate the pirate ship\'s laser blast and evade it, just 
barely.(Player rolled his pilot evasion task)  His friend, Schmedly Dunlop, 
manned the Gunnery Control station.  "I\'ll soon deal with this problem!", 
said Schmedly as he got a lock on the pirate.(sensor task) and fired.  The 
small laser turet on the Scout was working overtime(overpower laser ROF), 
and was prone to overheating, but he managed to peal off a good shot that 
lased right into the pirate ship\'s main gun, damaging it severely(successful 
gunnery task) just as the electronics spark and fry in the turret.(Unknown 
to players at that moment).  Just then the sesors detect 2 inbound bogies 
goming in fast from the pirate, missiles!  Shmedly prepares to get a lock on 
and fire at the missiles when he gets a red light indicating the laser 
turret is off line.  "Motz!  We need laser power in the next 30 miniutes or 
were all dead!", screams Schmedly to the engineer.  Motz gets to work 
re-rigging the power couplings and circuitry,  he finishes and Schmedly 
manages to get a shot off to the inbounds, destroying one....the other 
impacts into the hull.  The guys on the bridge rock in thier chairs as the 
missile hits.  Dammage report computer says exposive decompresion in main 
engineering.  Motz learns this and realises if he haven\'t had been working 
on the laser turet on the time, he would be floating space junk by now!

Yes, ship combat need not be booring and "techish" you can have alot of fun 
with it.  The emphasis is to make shure it is done quick and fast so that 
the players get a feeling of heart pounding, gut wrenching, combat action. 
 This is what I liked about the CT/HG system.  MT made it very complicated 
with all those charts, TNE was detailed, too detailed.  RSPC is the best 
system I found yet. IMNSHO. :)

I do have to admit (not easy for a gearhead wargamer like m\'self) but there 
is more you can do with a ship than just vape other ships.  Murder mysteries 
were a common and favorite occurance during that long week in jumpace in my 
games.  There\'s always the ship that has a \'quirky\' piece of machinery. 
Ain\'t nothing like a quirky j-drive to act as your macguffin, PC\'s need to 
go to X world to get Y part or keep misjumping every 1 outa 6 jumps! ;->

Not to mention if you are playing in TNE land theres always....
VIRUS!

Right, and bacteria are fairly adaptable to basic chemistry.  That

Deaths are not likely to be the most significant event.  You have
a highly regimented empire that is spread out over travel
times on the order of a year and has gotten sort of moribund
lately.  Then you incapacitated more than 1/2 the population
(either through direct illness or caring for those who are
sick) for several months in several waves (for different
illnesses) that sweeps through the empire, disrupting
communications and supplies (what\'s the saying "any society
is only 3 meals away from revolution? :-) just as the war
is starting.  That would leave the empire ripe for the picking
from even a small force.  Especially, if regional governors,
smaller neighbors, etc.  used the opportunity to pick old scores,
declare independence, launch their own bids for power, etc.

You are a governor of a planet in an empire that has been
on it\'s last legs for some time now.  A couple of plagues
sweep through cutting you off.  A fleet shows up that, while
small by standards of the forces of the whole empire, is
certainly bigger than what you have, or can be raised without
the no longer existant communications, and comes from a society
that isn\'t disrupted by the plagues.  It is not unreasonable
that you probably would choose to switch to new masters who
can stablize the existing order.  In fact, they might
even be seen as a relief from anarchy.

Fair. One minor detail, Canada has 10 provinces and 2 territories, and all
but four are on the US border (without looking, name them)

I know that. In fact, I assumed it because, let\'s face it, Cuba is not going
to be anything soon if the sitrep remains as is.

Yep. They can do that

I\'ve always thought corps won\'t rule but rather abuse laws in "pisspot"
nations like Liberia and threaten legit nation states. Corps cannot defeat
even a small nation state, but they can threaten to leave and thus
intimidate nation states. Perhaps you should make a list of good, average
and mean-spirited megacorps

Yes, it\'s true.  In the copy I bought at my FLGS Chapters 6,7 & 8 were 
ommited and replaced with a duplicate of chapters 3-5 or such.

I do not know if anyone else had this misprint, and if not then that means 
my copy is RARE and perhaps valuable. :)

<RANT>
Yes, TML citizens, I am NOT looking at this incident negatively.  I think 
that this book absolutely rocks.  Sure my copy was messed up, and sure the 
tables are in the back, and sure the equations are kinda wierd, but the guys 
who worked on this thing went through a lot to produce it, and I respect 
that.  I am not saying this because I was a playtester either.  I have 
started to get into the game design thing on a freelance level and I can 
only imagine what some of these guys who do it for a living have to deal 
with, in addition to maintaining a job and for some a family, they do not 
need negative comment.

There, I have said my peace.
</RANT>

What I am saying is, this is a game, have fun with it.  I kinda enjoy little 
quirks like this.  Prolly because I look at things in the future (hey I\'m a 
dreamer).  I figure my copy of FF&S II could be an envy of gamers in the 
next century (Wow, you got one of those copies?  Way cool!)

>Right.  I\'m taking the opposite side.  

I know you are, Ken. ;->  This is one we simply diagree on.  It is possible
(easy even) to extend the level of skills somewhat beyond the 1-6, and, to
me, that does less damage to the Traveller system than trying to shoehorn
everything into 1-6.  Yes, I know about the compatability ?problems?, but
all those old rules need to be revisited, reviewed and revised (where
needed) anyway. So, let\'s worry about making it better, not keeping it they
same.

>but I\'d like to keep Traveller skill levels like they were  in CT and MT.

Well, if skills run 1 to 6 and characteristics run 2 to 12 like in CT/MT
then they *don\'t* work on the same scale. In TNE skills ran from 1 to (I
never saw higher than 10) and attributes ran from 1 to 13, the scales were
closer to being the same. Personally, I liked the TNE *scales* and it\'s
task system, although I think the "number of dice/diff level" is a *neater*
technique and I\'d like to see it retained, if possible.

There are a number of reasons I would like skills and characteristics to
run on about the same scale.  One being you could more easily have
characteristic only tasks, (STR+AGL) rather than (STR+skill), when they are
appropriate.  

I guess this issue isn\'t one worth arguing between us, we both know our
attitudes on it pretty well by now, and aren\'t likely to change each other.

Reddkneck Arms and Munitions (RAAM) is proud to announce a great line of
missiles/torpedoes to carry the RAAMPage Weapon Modules.

Due a great effort on our part and CRASH we were able to get this
announcement to every freedom loving being out there. All major instellar
governments have been trying to suppress this from getting out to beings
out there.

Well they did not succeed, hell they did not even scuff the paint job.<G>

We here at RAAM are proud as hell, to formally announce the release for
sale of our line of torpedoes/missiles "Bubba" and "Little Bubba". 

With the armor level that each carries they will shake off point defense
batteries like water on good wax job.

Each is capable of multiple runs at more than one target, too.

They designed to reusable to keep costs down.

We have even packaged them into two major variants. 
The MK1 line for the "Cannonites" out there and the MK2 line for the
"Herectics".

"Bubba" and "Little Bubba" are guaranteed to make your enemies into new
allies or space dust, your choice.

They have been designed by the very best techniques and technologies
available and even some not generally available.

We were able to find solutions to the many issues in the design and
construction of the "Bubba" and "Little Bubba".

Easy credit and financing available, we accept valuable metals, credits,
and lost kittens.

Remember at Reddkneck Arms and Munitions (RAAM) if its a big battleship
RAMM it. 

Our motto is "Peace Through Superior Massive Overkill"

Reddkneck Arms and Munitions (RAAM) is located at Liberty Hall/Beyond, go
past the Spinward Marches, and just follow the glowing planets and cratered
starships. 

And now for the MK1 lines of "Bubba" and "Little Bubba"

Not quite correct.  The L points are where the gravitational and
*centripetal* forces in the rotating two-body frame cancel out.

Picture the Earth-Moon system as seen from \'above\' their center of mass
(inside Earth, by the way).  The two bodies revolve continuously around
this common point, once per month.

Now, start spinning yourself, at the same rate, so that from your view,
Earth and Moon are \'fixed in place\', with the whole rest of the Universe
spinning around them once per month.  In this frame, gravitational forces
act as they always do, pulling objects toward Earth and Moon.  However,
there is also a new \'pseudoforce\' in this frame, which \'pushes\' objects
away from the center of mass, more so the further they are from it.

Near Earth or Moon, the attractive forces overwhelm the repulsive
\'pseudoforce\'.  Far from the two, repulsion overwhelms attraction.
However, in a few special places, the two neatly cancel out, and these are
the LaGrange points.

The first three, L1-L3, are along the line running through the Earth and
Moon; one \'behind\' Earth relative to the moon, one between Earth and Moon,
and one \'beyond\' the Moon.  These are all \'negatively stable\', however,
like a ball bearing balanced on a smooth hill.  If the ball bearing drifts
even slightly off-center, it will accelerate away, down the hill.
Similarly, a craft wishing to stay at L1,2 or 3 must use a tiny amount of
thrust to stay there, as otherwise tiny external forces -- solar gravity,
light pressure -- will shove it away.

The last two LaGrange points are at the apices of equilateral triangles
having Earth and Moon at the other two apices; 60 degrees ahead of and
behind the Moon in its orbit.  L4 and L5 are *positively* stable, like a
ball bearing sitting in a shallow dip.  Nudge the ball bearing gently
enough, and it will tend to roll back to its original position.

This positive stability is one major reason L4 and L5 make attractive
spots for large-scale space facilities; you don\'t need (much)
station-keeping fuel to make stuff stay where it\'s supposed to be.

Hope this helps!

Best idea on this subject yet!  I\'ve been trying to convert as many of the
tables and "Roll 7+" type things to Tasks as I can in my notes. What\'s the
point of having a good task system if we don\'t put it to use? ;->

Doug, I\'m not arguing with you or Marc about the 1/2 die. I\'ve said I don\'t
like it, Marc has made it fairly clear he wants to use it, so unless he is
open to dropping it why discuss it?  However, I\'m also not going to use it
in Task Resolution. I can see it\'s uses in certain areas of character
generation and the combat system, but a single d3 in the middle of a d6
progression is inelegant and unneeded.

Of course, just my opinion.

Apologies if people are ****ing you off with moaning. You probably only see
it as people love the game so much. Personally, I\'ve just adopted the
principle of looking at the supplements first, and then buying them if I
like them. (Caveat Emptor?) I like the T4 system, and am looking forward to
T4.1.

Just one plea - please leave the combat system substantially as it is, as
it is one of the bits in the new rules that I think beats any previous
edition\'s. (Nice, fast, task driven and with autofire rules that are
understandable and playable! ;-) ) Haven\'t used the unarmed combat yet, so
I won\'t comment.

I suspect this is a rarity; I have my pre-order copy of FF&S, and I\'ve
looked at the local game store, and both copies are whole and unsullied
with pagination aberrations.  As for collectibility; its always possible.
I have some 12" GI Joe accessory sets that were mispackaged, which I hope
someday might be worth something (as opposed to the other sets which I\'ve
long since opened and played with).

Yeah, I said I played with them...

Whats it to you?  You got some kinda problem with that?

Yeah, I\'m 33.  What\'s your point?

	As a book importer there is a difference whether something

	That Traveller is in print but "temporary out of stock -

	delivery, when no other terms are made like "30 days strictly
	net" for book and gamestores, or "proforma prepaid" for the
	wilds.

	To have a living Traveller is a very good thing for all of us.

I disagree with Kenneth here.  I\'d rather have a new set of skill levels
(with a table/formula so I could convert exisitng characters) and not have to
multiply during the game.  Less hassle for newcomers.  

As someone who regularly introduces people to Traveller (by using it as a
teaching aid), I know that it is easier to premultiply numbers than to keep
multiplying them every time you use them.

This is not a total opposition to multipliers.  I can see, for example,
having a character multiply their skill by half when using unfamiliar
equipment.  I just think that the multiplier should be for special cases, not
all cases.

> How may people on the List actually play out ship to ship combat during
> role play sessions?

	I often do it. Here is my "role playing ship combat system"

	- BE PREPARED !
	- Place a map of the ship on the table. The map has to have
	  grids. I also prepare a d20 translation for the deckplans
	  as I\'m using TNE hit locations. Any player has to place his
	  poeppel somewhere on the map.
	- Place a clock next to the map. I always referee ship combats
	  in REAL TIME. Civilian laser fire every 3 minutes,
	  military lasers any 30 seconds.
	- Anything on the player ship is task based now. There is NO
	  HEXMAP for the combat. I\'m using a pocket calculator for
	  astrogation (Atari Portfolio) and as the LCD has a very
	  narrow engle of view, there is no posibility to lurk. I
	  dislike a referees screen hiding me from the players, so
	  if you dont use a pocket calculator be shure that the
	  screen is between the paperwork and the players, and not
	  between the players and you.
	- All space tasks are UNCERTAIN. Uncertain princip and real
	  time produces a very dense athmosphere. I let the sensor
	  op make his roll, if it was successfull I divide his roll
	  by the modified target number multiply it by 30 minutes,
	  and tell him later (portfolio manage this beeping up with
	  a message ;-), if it was a miss, the task fail without
	  any notice. I dont tell players if they hit. The sensor
	  op has to roll on. Its difficult to tell if a hit was
	  placed and formidable to distinct between sandcasters,
	  decoys and fuel hits.
	- Never extend a battle for more than 5 turns (2,5 hours),
	  preparing jump is a matter of less than an hour or imposible
	  by rule. So disengaging is most times posible in long
	  range battles. If the group manage to stay alive for
	  that time cheat the moral roll and disengage.

I\'m also in Richardson, Texas and have been into Traveller since 1977.
I\'ve been interested in starting up a game in the Dallas area. I operate
a graphic design business from my home and generally work between 4 pm
and 4 am daily. So, give me a call and let\'s see if we are on the same
wavelength.

   I\'m not sure how rare or how valuable, but my understanding is that
when things like this happen, it is the fault of the printer, not the
publisher (in this case IG).  I seriously doubt IG leafed through every
single copy of FF&S II before shipment (nor would I expect them to do
so).

   Little "quirks" like this do nothing for MMT\'s repuation and are, I\'m
sure, regretable from IG\'s perspective.  Hopefully their printer can
avoid similiar manufacture of "collectables" in the future.

Traveller

Virus Characteristics
- ----
Traveller is a memory resident, file infecting virus. It infects
.COM and .EXE files, including COMMAND.COM. 

Upon infection, the Traveller virus becomes memory resident at
the top of system memory but below the 640K DOS boundary.
Interrupt 21 is hooked by the virus in high system memory, as
well as interrupt 24 in low system memory. Interrupt 12\'s return
is not moved. 

Once memory resident, it infects .COM and .EXE files as they are
executed. It also infects one file each time a previously infected
file is executed, or whenever a DOS DIR command is issued.

It is not known what Traveller does besides replicate. 

Indications of Infection
- ----
Files infected with Traveller will contain the following text
strings:
"Traveller (C) BUPT 1991.4"
"Don\'t panic I\'m harmless <<----!!!!!!!"
"*.* COMEXE" 

Total system and available free memory decreases by 1,840 bytes.
Files infected with Traveller have a file length increase of
1,220 to 1,237 bytes. The virus is located at the end of the
infected file. There are no changes to the file\'s date and time
in a DOS disk directory listing.

Method of Infection
- ----
The only way to infect a computer with a file infecting virus is
to execute an infected file on the computer. The infected file
may come from a multitude of sources including: floppy diskettes,
downloads through an online service, network, etc. Once the
infected file is executed, the virus may activate. 

REMOVAL

How To Clean Your System With VirusScan
- ----
If the above method was unable to remove the virus or the file
was corrupted or overwritten by the virus, please refer to:
If VirusScan Cannot Remove a Virus From Infected Files

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Prevention
- ----
Scan all files before using them to minimize the risk of
infection. 

Virus Information

   My credentials as a critic of IG are well...without question, but I
think if you go to the BBB or any other consumer watchdog group without
first expressing your issues to IG, you are doing IG a disservice and
basically wasting your time.

   Give them a chance to make things right.  The *vast* majority of
businesses out there will be all too happy to make things right, and
sometimes even give you something extra for your trouble.  If you go
straight to the BBB, probably the first thing they are going to ask you
is, "what did IG say when you tried to contact them?"  If your answer
is, "I haven\'t tried," you can expect to be told to at least make an
effort and then get back with them.

   I think if there is valid criticism of product or the way IG does
business or approaches the game, then this is as good a forum as any
available.  It should remain so (sometimes a little theraputic ranting
is good for the soul).  IG shouldn\'t worry about people here griping
about various products.  What they *should* worry about is if a product
is released and nothing is said about it at all.  For the bandwidth
coming out of TML is the sound of people who care about Traveller.  When
that bandwidth ceases, it is a sign that no one cares.

   However, lenghty rants against FF&S II (which should scream GEARHEAD
PRODUCT from the word \'go\') that put the product down because it is
\'gearhead-oriented\' are uncalled for.  If you think that FF&S I was a
much better product, if you think the formatting sucked with the tables
in the back, if a formula is confusing, missing, or appears to be
incorrect, if you feel it should have covered more areas of technology
and it did not, or you don\'t like certain passages or artwork, then
those are valid criticisms.  But please, enough of the "it\'s too hard"
comments!

   Everyone does.  I think what you are doing in personally revising the
MMT rules was a excellent move.  Even MMT serious skeptics have backed
off to varying degrees the "T4 Bashing"--some have even announced their
intention of giving MMT another chance.  If IG had carried out the
revisions I don\'t think any of the skeptics would have given a second
thought to pronouncing it "dead on arrival."

   How many versions of the game system are there for the game covered
in the other mailing list?  Assuming at least four, are they all
basically covering the same ground or do they each have radically
different settings?  Are the game mechanics similar (use the same amount
and type of dice, etc.)?  Because of the inherant differences between
CT, MT, TNE and MMT, it is only natural that there be a certain level of
tension, ranting, and general strife on this mailing list.

I would think that the presence of a Naval Base would have quite a large
impact.  Let\'s say that a Cruron is based out of the system.  That\'s 5
cruisers(30,000-50,000dt), 4 escorts(10,000-25,000dt) and various other
ships.  There\'s also the support personnel to think about, say another 100%.
 Now we have to consider the civilian sector.  Does the planet have
recreation facilities for the 20,000+ Naval personnel; if so add at least
50,000 more people who are directly influenced by the single cruron\'s
presence.  Then there\'s the black market to consider........

All in all, a relatively small naval force requires a huge amount of civilian
support thus increasing the size and complexity of the spaceport.

In CT, characters received one skill per term, plus one for commission or
promotion. The average skill eligibility was between 0.25 and 0.50 per ye=
ar.

In Mercenary (and High Guard, etc), there were a variable number of skills
awarded ranging, but let\'s say it was between 1  and 1.25 per skills per
year.

MT continued that general eligibility.

T4 and specifically T41 has a skill eligibility of approximately 1.25 skills
per year. That rate is formalized by the "experience" rate after adventuring
begins.

The rate of receipt of skills by characters in T41 is approximately the same
as for Mercenary or Enhanced MT characters.

Empirical evidence from playtesting of T41 indicates that most character have
skill levels between 2 and 4 for the skills that they figure are important.

It is a mistake to say specifically that CT skills ranged from 1 to 6 and T4
(T41) skills range from 1 to 15. Skills in CT could range from 1 to 15 as
well.

The characteristics versus skill debate could range on forever. T41 is going
to have characteristics and skills.

Because people skip from career to career vicariously adventuring int he

intended as a substitute for adventuring; its a way of getting some
experience before adventuring.

Because once multiple careers are allowed, then it becomes more than two...
it becomes 3 or 4 or 5. I have to draw the line somewhere, and I originally

What about power, control, and logic devices using photonic (optical
devices controlling pulses of light), gravitic (employing solid-state
matricies of gravitic potentials), or nucleonic (microscopic machines using
tghe strong nuclear force) technology? These technologies could have
significantly greater bandwidth, power, and reliability than electronic
technology. I think AT&T has experimented with photonic devices.

NB. Fiber optics are not photonic devices; they are merely a transport
mechanism. The power and logic is supplied by familiar old electrons.

This depends on what a skill level means. If skills go from 1 to 6 then,
yes, a skill 4 doctor should be an expert and able to beat a skill 1 doctor
of any characteristic. If skills go from 1 to 15, like characteristics,
then a skill 4 isn\'t greatly better than a skill 1 and I could easily see a
skill 4 doctor being bested by a talented skill 1 doctor.

Personally, I like the idea of skills based on the same scale as
characteristics. Like Eris says, this means that we could have skill-only
(Chemistry+Medical for pharmacy, for example) or characteristic-only
(Dex+Int for a pool shot) tasks.

That applied to maximum total number of skill levels per character. I was
asking whether there was a limit to how many levels you can have in a given
skill.

I think 15 is a sensible limit, since stats are also capped at 15.

Sure, that would work. Inelegantly, though.

I feel that every level of a skill should count. The best solution would be
to rework the Actual Value Table mentioned by Marc, so that the modifier
equals the skill level, as it should.

More thoughts on the Chargen draft chapter:

Do graduates of the Merchant Academy enlist automatically in the Merchants?
The text doesn\'t say. If they do get to auto-enlist, at what rank do they
start?

In the Merchants, Automatic Skills include "Business-2" at rank 02. Does
this really mean you get two more skill levels from the Business cluster
automatically? Or is it a typo?

Under Scholars: on the Skill Eligibility table: "+1 skill upon achieving
Edu B". If you\'ve already got Edu B upon enlistment, do you still get the
skill?

Re: the Art Skill description: I think Art should be a cascade skill. The
player should choose a specialty from a list of various fields of art, such
as Art: Graphics, which also provides a lesser ability in Art: 3-D. Thus:

Art (Cascade):  Includes:
  Graphics      Painting, Drawing, Graphic Design, Printmaking
  3-D           Sculpture, Ceramics, Textiles, Architecture, Holography
  Multimedia    Film, Video, Animation, Digital Media (TL6-8)
  Immersive     Digital Media (TL9+), VR, Holomedia, Sensies (\'simstim\')
        
Skill in one specialty confers abilities in other specialties at a lower
level of skill, usually 1 level lower, sometimes 2 or 3.

This way, the Art skill not only covers careers in painting, but also in
cinema, design, architecture, advanced media, and lots of other cool things
we haven\'t invented yet (but which crop up in sf stories all the time)...

Best,

[I\'m not posting this to the list because I know it would just cause a
stupid flamewar...]

Can you rename "Craftsman" in T4.1? It rankles every time I read it. Many
of my characters are not men (sometimes not even human) so why use this
term when there are gender-free alternatives? (Imagine how you\'d feel if
our cultural default concepts were reversed, and you were often called "a
great \'craftswoman\' of game design"?)

Call it "Handicraft", "Craftwork", or "Fabrication". (Or "Craftsophont" for
that matter :)

Better yet, make "Handicraft" (or whatever) a cluster that breaks it down into:
        Carpentry  (or Woodcraft)
        Metalwork  (or Metalcraft)
        Synthetic Materials (or Plastics ?)
        Armorer
        Tailor
        Jeweler (maybe)
        Ceramics (maybe)
        Basket Weaving (okay, maybe not Basket Weaving:)

Fortunately you got rid of "Combat Rifleman". But don\'t worry, I\'m not
going to complain that there\'s no "Jill of All Trades" skill...

While we\'re suggesting new skills, I\'ll repeat something I suggested during
the Task System Debate:

       Put "Sophontology" under the "Social Sciences" cluster.

The science of "Sophontology" is mentioned in the CT Library Data entry on
Sophonts (IIRC), and I prefer this term to the less precise "Xenology". I
think it\'s a highly necessary skill in the Traveller universe, representing
general knowledge of a specific alien culture, its customs, psychology,
etc.

The player must choose a specialization each time he rolls this skill, such
as "Sophontology: Aslan".

Sophontology might also cascade to Language, and vice versa. Hence,
Sophontology: Aslan-4 would also confer Language: Aslan-3. But Language:
Vargr-4 would confer Sophontology: Vargr-3.

What d\'ya think?

More maunderings as they come to me...

Not a big problem for me. I\'d prefer to avoid it whenever possible, though.

>> 2. Tasks are too easy.

IIRC, you said that PCs with an "average" stat-7 and skill-3 should have a
50% chance of success at Formidable tasks. And the current T4.1 system
achieves this. I feel that this is too easy: Difficult tasks should 50% at
this skill+stat level, not Formidable. A straight 1D thru 6D progression
would achieve this.

But I\'m much more worried about characters with high stats, who really have
things too easy in T4.1, as in T4. For instance, we were playing T4 as
written, and my character (a mostly non-technical archeologist) managed to
fix most of a ship\'s virtually-trashed systems single-handedly, armed only
with Engineering-1, simply because I had a EDU of F. The ref, Roderick,
kept throwing Staggering and Impossible tasks at me, but I made every roll
easily. This is, of course, absurd. 

This sort of problem should be less common in T4.1 because EDU levels
aren\'t so ridiculously pumped up. But it\'s still a danger wherever
characters have high stats, and I think a slightly tougher system will
avoid these situations. Hence my suggestion of a straight 1D thru 6D
difficulty progression.

>> 3. Tasks use full strength Char and Full Strength Skill in the task statement

This is good, and I like it. But it requires a Chargen system that produces
characters with _at least_ two or three specialty skills in the 6+ range.
For the most part, the system works very well, though at present a PC is
only likely to have one skill at that level. As I said in a previous post,
I think a bit of tweaking would help, such as ways for the player to
concentrate on developing those professional skills. Entertainers and
Scholars have such specialites already. The trick is to keep these rules
from being abused, leading to characters with stat-F, skill-15. The Scholar
and Entertainer specialization rules are pretty well designed in this
respect.

Kenneth, of course, would like to restrict skills to the same 1-4 range as
in CT/MT, and I understand his reasons. It would be nice to keep things
compatible with the old rule sets. Boosting the range of skills makes for
problems - hence my post about your Broker Skill table. But I suspect this
is no longer an option. You\'d have to rewrite the T4.1 Chargen rules in
order to maintain CT skill levels, which would be a shame because the
system works very well as it is. So T4.1 skill levels are not equivalent to
CT skill levels, but is this such a terrible thing? I think we can simply
convert CT skills to T4.1 skills by multiplying by 2. Or maybe 3.

Gee, I guess I didn\'t manage to restrict my opinions to single-line points.
Oh well ;)

Some are bashing FFS2 at the top of their lungs, and others are raving about

also explains some of the reasons why things ARE and why things are NOT.

FFS2 does some things rather poorly and others it does rather well.  The
reason I will stick with it is the fact that I, me personally, can help
correct what\'s wrong.  With help from all of the GREAT people we have here
on TML (yes go ahead and pat yourselves on the back -- but just once).  This
is why T4 has not died yet.  If it wasn\'t for all of us, and this open
forum, IG would have been filling chapter 11 long ago (they still may?!?).
But its their, IG\'s, inconsistencies in published material that will be
their undoing.

I do not want to see Traveller go away.  New material is almost always good
even if it is bad material because it gets people to think, and that is what
a RPG is supposed to do.  We take the best of the worst and everything of
the best and use what we want.  Create what we don\'t have, and read
EVERYTHING in between.

In most of the mail I read I got a bad taste in my mouth, not from some of
the exciting things that are going on but all of the other stuff.  I think
most of us know by now that IG doesn\'t SEEM to listen, they might - on deaf

Chew on this for a while.

It is not a hassle if you only do it once (the calculation) and leave 
it like that.

Ex--  Character has Dex-7 and Pistol-2.  He wants to fire his gun.

The multiplier for skills is 3, and we\'ve already wrote on the 
character\'s sheet.  The line reads
             Skill/Level          Exp
             ----         ----
             Pistol-2               6

Instead of the player adding 2+7=9 (in T4), the player adds 6+7=13.

It\'s not more hassle.  It is the same move, and it is only addition.

  Expense can be lower than you think. You can now buy white metal 15mm
figs for WW-II very cheaply, up to and including bags of four battle tanks,
for around $20 US (under $30 CDN). The original 15mm Trav figs were quite
good, as well. These also work straight onto the old maps (AHL, Snapshot,
various licensees, Asteroid, deckplans on magnified copies), and make for
smaller (and better ground-scaled) table-top battles. Vehicles are _much_
cheaper, and importers can supply 15mm figs from the UK.

  For those who must have 28+mm figs, try "Legions of Steel". They should
be cheaper than GW and more palatable to Traveller players, "realism"-wise.

Maybe your desire for a knowledge-related component of History could 
be satisfied by including the Archaeology skill you outline 
elsewhere.  (I am a little cynical about the knowledge element of 
history in RL; too many graduate students whose response to the 
question "What decade did you say your period was?" is "Oooh, I 
wouldn\'t say a whole decade!" rather than "Don\'t patronise me, I know 
more general history than you do, and you know it."  I am not an 
expert on the broad sweep of history, but worryingly neither are 
they.  Digression over, no offence intended.  Perhaps they\'re just 
nice people.)

May I abuse snippage by inserting some positive Traveller reasons

I think MT had a Psychohistory skill; certainly it had a Library Data 
entry for psychohistory (with a little note for referees as well).  
Psychohistory is in the public domain.

Given that the concept exists, it is not unreasonable for a title of 
"psychohistorian" to exist for an expert in History and Psychology.  
This doesn\'t make them another Hari Seldon, just a social 
psychologist.

I would agree entirely, but IMO the world of difference is a 
difference in scope, not in nature.  While Asimov\'s psychohistory can 
read trends thousands of years ahead and accurately predict 
strategies to alter the whole galaxy of inhabited worlds, it requires 
vast resources.  PCs won\'t have the influence to do this; what they 
will be able to do is apply the techniques locally.  I don\'t see 
psychohistory as being anything other than a fusion of psychological 
and historical techniques.

I am certainly not suggesting that the PCs be able to wield unholy 
power over sectors of Imperial space -- although if they want to try, 
bring on those magnificent Men In Battledress...

I don\'t intend to undercut the Hivers -- well, not much, anyway.  I 
do want humans to have a chance to detect and counter Hiver 
manipulations, or engage in manipulations of their own like the 
Psionics Suppressions.  (Yes, I\'ve heard it\'s all a Hiver plot.)
It\'s a tribute to the Hivers that they can manipulate humans at all, 
given that alienness of their thought processes.

The key difference between 3I humanity and Hivers is that while 
humans view manipulation as reprehensible (at least when it\'s applied 
to them) and to be concealed, the Hivers glory in it.  If PCs skip 
out to the 3I with the secret of the Star Trigger, the 3I is not 
going to be any more defined by it, nor are the Darrians less defined 
by it -- it\'s not their big secret, but it\'s a damned effective 
weapon that\'s now known to *work*.

That\'s *exactly* the kind of thing I\'d implement if the PCs ever took 
to this in a big way -- with or without something called 
"psychohistory" behind them.

It\'s true that Traveller character generation has always been a bit of a
game in itself. To me that has always seemed a bit of an added charm to
it. That\'s true even if you only go through one career. I don\'t agree
that that is a bad thing.

If people enjoy creating characters, what\'s the harm in that? I should think 
that would be a bonus.

As someone who has used a few simple rules of thumb to allow characters
with multiple careers ever since CT, I can tell you that it enhances the
resulting characters. Instead of players being able to assume that a
diplomat would under no circumstances know anything about demolitions 
you can have diplomats who have been marines and ex-merchant navy officers
and ex-criminal army privates and ex-doctor law enforcers. It works for me,

Sometimes, yes, but the aging rolls impose a natural limit to the number of
different careers anyone can pack into a lifetime. And a few sensible rules
prevent people from chopping and changing incessantly. For example, unless
a character has a skill useful to the new career at a reasonable level, the
character begins on the bottom of the ladder in the new career. Since high
rank is an advantage in several ways, excessive career changes are
discouraged. And, again, what is the problem with a character having 5
careers? 

>I have to draw the line somewhere, 

I don\'t see why a line is necessary. There is a natural limit build into
the system already (the 4 year term size (Though, actually, I myself some-
times let a character have half terms. With the appropiate cut in skills
recieved, of course)).

     some good points there on the History/Archaeology skill - I agree with
you that the difference between player character and society-wide
manipulations is one of scale.

There was no Psychohistory skill in MT but there was an extensive library
data entry - so again, you\'re right, it is in the public domain.

     I think that what I\'m trying to get at is that psychohistory should be
a skill all of its own if it is available to players at all (or rather for
the first time) in Traveller. Let\'s leave the History skill as it has
always been defined in Traveller (I think it first appeared in MT) - that
is as a knowledge based skill. I don\'t think it\'s too pedantic to see that
historical knowledge of any degree and the Machiavellian know-how for
manipulating situations are two separate areas of endeavour for the average
player character. This is all just IMO of course, and I\'m not really
interested in arguing the specifics of one or other skill among many, I\'d
be interested to see how you\'d define a separate psychohistory skill
though...

>I was just purusing the tables in HIGH GUARD (remember that in terms of
>ship design, especially at these TL, there is not much difference between
>CT and MT) and came up with the following:

This is a facinating post. Unfortunately you\'ve made a small error in reading
the High Guard rules and ignored a very important factor regarding the Vilani
in the Interstellar Wars.

First the minor error. You\'ve misread the rule regarding ship size and
computers. The rule state that a ship of a certain size requires a certain
model of computer as a minimum. At TL 9 the best computer you can build is a
Model/3, at TL 11 its a Model/5. Now a 5,000T ship requires a Model/3 and a
10,000T requires a Model/4; a 50,000T ship requires a Model/5 and a 100,000T
ship requires a Model/6. Therefore the Terrans can build any ship smaller than
10,000T and the Vilani any ship smaller than 100,000T.

However more importantly, the Terrans are not fighting the central Vilani
fleet, they are fighting the provincial governors fleet. In the game Imperium
which simulates the the Interstellar Wars we find that the provincial
governor is prohibited from building any ship larger than a light cruiser. So
the Terrans are not facing the largest ships the  Vilani can build. The
question here is how big is a Vilani light cruiser? If we assumes that Vilani
capital ships are around 60,000T to 80,000T and their heavy cruisers around
40,000T to 50,000T, I\'d hazzard a guess that Vilani light cruisers are in the
20,000T to 30,000T range. This makes the Terrans and Vilani a much closer match
than pure TL analysis would indicate. At this size in HG the best weapons are
missile bays (fits with Vilani ships high missile factors in Imperium).

Now this gives an interesting possibility. In Imperium, Vilani ships are mostly
charecterised by high missile factors and Terran ships by high beam factors.
I\'m not sure and I don\'t have time to do the design at the moment, but I
believe you can design a jump capable ship mounting a factor-B spinal PA at
tech level 9 under High Guard (at TL 9 a B PA masses 5000T plus 2000T power
plant and fuel). I think this can be made to fit in a 9,900T hull. To be sure,
its not a very good ship, but it can be done and would come as a suprise to the
Vilani who have only ever encountered opponents who have received their
technology and tactics from the Vilani themselves (a GIGO situation). Such a
hypothesis would go a long way towards explaining why the Terrans where able
to survive the First Interstellar War.

However, as a final proviso, all this is of course mute, as High Guard has long
been retired as the "offical" ship design system (despite that fact, I do love
it and will continue to use it)

I really hate it when I roll a character (CT) with Liason-3, Admin-2, 
Streetwise-1.  Since the Liason counts as Admin or Streetwise-2, 
these skills are "wasted".  Similarly with the Pilot-4, Ship\'s Boat-2 
character... a kind GM (ha!) would allow rerolls, anyone got a spare 
kind referee? 8-)

This is less of a problem in T4 in general and T4.1 in particular; 
for instance, Medical now provides a blanket First Aid-1, and there\'s 
no upper limit to skills.  However, I still propose:

If a character has Skill-n derived from another skill held 
(e.g. First Aid-1 from Medical-3) and receives an increase to the 
"derived" skill, then they are awarded Skill-(n+1).

The Medical-3 character awarded First Aid skill has an effective 
First Aid-1; she has First Aid-2 after the award.  Obviously spent 
some time in an ER.


Effects: no "useless" skills, more skill-2/3 rather than 1/2, pilots 
don\'t now dread Ship\'s Boat skill, etc.

Side effects: it\'s still better to get the major skill first and then 
levels in the minor, but you will never do worse than under the 
current system.

Counter arguments (include): It\'s sometimes interesting to roleplay a 
character with "useless" skills, as it gives them some history.  
"Darned right they were a useless outfit, gave me vacc suit training 
and first aid after all them years as a drop trooper medic!"

The major argument against is that ability to perform a task and the 
"proper" training are different things: derived skills simply aren\'t 
accredited, they\'re patchy.  My only reply to that is that they 
aren\'t treated as such in any form of Traveller.  A skill level is a 
skill level, in practice.

Oh, and I\'d love to see the Naval Architect skill back 8-)

Everybody I\'ve heard from wants the grid back, but very few people can
agree on the size.  *Sigh* for the Tactical Action Combat System (TACS)
which is being written today, I\'m going to put all the movement rules in
meters per 6 second turn.  That way, you can convert to whatever grid size
you wish.  Want 30 second turns and a 10m grid?  Simple; multipliy all AP
costs by 5.

What do you think Fib computers are ? ;-)

yes Bell Labs...errr... _Lucent_ did/does (they nuke research programs
with distressing speed these days) have a number of hybrid and a few,
very simple fully optical devices. \'Nano\' (more or less) mechanical
devices are in commercial use today...there is an LED Projector on the
market (TI I think) that uses an array of movable mirrors in a chip sized
package as part of the system. Pretty neat stuff.

And why shouldn\'t the Hivers glory in it...it is, to them, the perfect
defensive weapon...they don\'t risk themselves physically, far fewer people
die than in wars, and it ends by your enemy _agreeing_ to do what you
want, _happily_. I think that the most widely known Hiver manipulation,
that of the K\'Kree, is probably considered mostly a failure by the Hivers,
simply because it _is_ so well known, that they had to go to the lengths
they did, confronting the K\'Kree, and basically threatening them by
revealing that they\'d manipulated some K\'Kree into eating meat.

With less fanatical subjects, like humans, it\'s likely that the fact that
they\'re being manipulated would never be known. They just think it Tastes
Great! Less Filling!

The last, for you people fortunate enough to not live in the States, was
the advertising slogan of a brand of watered down beer that is
spectacularly successful because, at least intil recenly, Americans had No
Taste! in beer.

This comes up because I just read a hilarious, highly educational book
called "Beer Blast: The Inside Story of the Brewing Industry\'s Battles for
Your Money" by Philip Van Munching (ex of Van Munching & Co, importers of
Heineken beer) It is a wickedly funny tale of the Beer industry\'s
marketing battles, mostly from the 70\'s to today, told by a veteran of the
marketing trenches. ISBN # 0-8129-6391-1 Times Books, 1997

It has LOTS of examples of failed \'psychohistory\' (aka marketing).

AT&T has indeed, as have a number of other telecoms companies and 
universities worldwide - the japanese are very interested by the 
potential, and here at good old Heriot-Watt we produced the world\'s 
first optical \'computer\' - actually a ring (made up of 4 spatial 
light modulators IIRC) making up a single (I think?) optical logic 
cell - processing speed 1 logical operation (AND, OR, NOT etc.) per 
clock cycle.  The machine was called O-CLIP (Optical Cellular Logic 
Image Processor I think).  

The problem with it was that it didn\'t scale very well - the second
version was supposed to use a 4x4 array of optical elements for
parallel processing, but the researchers found that thermal
transmission between the cells of the SLM arrays was such that the
design was unworkable.  They then went on to look for new materials
to use as SLM\'s, and I believe have now settled on SEED (Self 
Electro-optic Effect Device) materials for these in most 
applications. 

All-optical computers are at the moment a real blue-sky research 
item, the real money is going into optical interconnects for 
electronic processors, such as those I believe are used between 
processor boards in the later Cray machines (anyone have one handy to 
check?).  As a previous poster said, the propagation speed for 
(free-space) optical transmission is ~twice that of electrons in 
silicon, and photons don\'t have interference problems when you cross 
two beams.  That being the major obstacle to optical computer design 
- - how to get the photons to interact with each other to make a logic 
circuit.

Still, you do gain a remarkable amount of freedom by being able to 
make connections from your chips in the third dimension - just ask 
anyone connected with flip-chip bonding techniques - and that\'s just 
using ordinary electronic connections.  Hybrid optical/electronic 
devices have an incredible bandwidth - 5 years ago the BNR labs 
at Harlow had developed fibre/electronics transceiver devices with 
speeds at 700 Mbit/s per channel, and last year they reported the 
fabrication of a 12x2.5 Gbit/s receiver, aggregate capacity 30 
Gbit/s.  I\'m sure research hasn\'t stopped there!

Very true - in fact, the power for any \'optical\' device is supplied 
by good old electrons (leaving aside chemical lasers as irrelevant to 
the point in hand).  If you are willing to neglect power supplies 
however, optical fibres can indeed be photonic devices - there are 
self-amplifying optical fibres being laid all over the world, a 
nifty example being BT\'s fibre optic switch at Galashiels about 40 
miles from where I sit, allowing simultaneous transmission of up to a 
million-ish telephone calls from Scotland to London.

Right, it\'s time I stopped writing this and go and do some work 
instead.

You\'re not the only one who\'s noticeded that.  I, for one, agree entirely.  I
think that there should be a little more attention paid to the other
technologies of the Traveller universe (someone had mentioned a little while
ago that in his M:0 campaign the starships had low-tech, handcrafted accents
on the bridge and such.  It made me start thinking, and I got these visions
of starships fit for kings with Corinthian Leather and so on)...

Anyhow, I agree completely, and, I introduce the "Microfoil Welding System"
as a start on non-weapon tech:

     Microfoil Welding System, TL8+,  Mass: Neg., Vol: Neg. Cr: See below.

    Microfoils are a combination of various materials and metals (boron, carbon,
silica, aluminum, nickel) that releases can heat up enough to fuse two pieces of
metal together with just a spark or a small amount of heat.  The foil\'s rapid heating is
caused by the rapid combination of the atoms of the above materials.  The reaction
raises the temperature to 1,600 degrees celsius in less than a millisecond.
     Micorfoils create a stronger weld because there is little or no time for oxygen to
mingle with the joint and cause brittleness.  The strength of the weld can be changed
by adding or removing layers.  The thinner the layer, the stronger the weld.  Some
layers are just 20 - 25 atoms thick.
     Although the technology exists at TL8, it is not cost efficient to use.  The time
and cost required is excessive (8-24 hours per layer and an expensive technique
called "magnetron sputtering").  At TL10, advances in nanotechnology mean that
foils are cheaper and easier to make, and the cost goes down.  At TL10+ Micro-
foil welding systems cost 100 credits per "weld" whereas at TL8 and 9 the same
amount would cost 100 times as much.

(Note:  This technology was listed in the December 1996 issue of Scientific American)

In Challenge 28, the article Contact: Sabmiqys basically points out that the
Vilani did not have Meson weapons, but the Terrans developed them during the
war. A quote:

"The first time the Vilani encountered meson fire from the Solomani, the
Vilani were horrified - their ship was induced to explode from inside - just
like the Gashukubi legends. Rumors of the "gashukubi" weapon of the Solomani
did much to break the Vilani\'s will to continue the fight."

Gashukubi ("Certain Death") was the Vilani name for the Sabmiqys\' system.

This article seems to say that the Vilani lacked both Meson weapons and
meson screens.

If I\'m stating something that has already been said, I apologize.

Yes, but why do it at all?  

Those of us who have played Traveller for since the beginning have a \'feel\'
for what skill levels mean in game terms, but that \'feel\' will be wrong with
the new task system anyway.  Other than nostalgia, I can\'t think of a reason
for _not_ changing the meaning of skill levels.

Backwards compatibility is maintaining by a page on converting between
different versions (eg. to convert a character from MT to T4, multiply all
skill levels by 2).

Good point, Richard (and Eris).  I like this idea: tasks use two values
without being restricted to a skill and an attribute.  Simpler and more
flexible, and training is on par with inate talent.

Assumign that level 6 is an average for a \'professional\' skill level, then
your typical 30-year old would have 12x1.25=15 skill levels.  If they put
half into their main skill, they have a level 7: quite respectable.

Two possibilities:

1. MA does more damage than Brawling (+skill?)
2. MA tasks are a level easier than Brawling

MA should be harder to learn (ie it appears less often on the skill 
charts) to compensate.

Size-wise, the Kinunir is more like a destroyer. Maybe they couldn\'t afford 
\'real\' cruisers, but didn\'t want anyone to know? :-)

IMU* there\'s a colony of Stone Age Vargr there that the IISS don\'t want

puppy she stowed away on a Scout/Courier that visited, and by the time 
she was discovered it was too late to send her back. In order to hush 
up this cock-up, the Scouts sort of adopted her. That was a seriously 
twisted PC...)

I think the combat system is basically good, tweak and refine at will, 
but, as mentioned before, kill the 3D max damage rule.

 Grid based combat system would be nice too, but this may lead to a 
wargame intense type of combat system (not that its bad, it just may not 
be for everyone)... but with starship deck layouts (hmmn, Traveller 
Naval Architecture) likely to come out as grid based deck layouts (not 
hexes), this may dovetail nicely with a grid-based combat system.

I don\'t know, but I\'ve noticed it too.  I\'d been on GURPSnet a while,
which has far less confrontation and rankling, so this was a bit of a
shock when I joined.  I still enjoy TML as a great source of discussion
and ideas, but I do wish things were a little gentler here.

>I\'m really tired of the Imperium bashing that the net and the TML seems
>to love to do.

I\'m as guilty of this as anyone.  The thing is, IG aren\'t perfect - and
it\'s so much more natural in our culture(s) to criticise than to praise,
particularly when concerned about the future.  As someone involved in
Re-evaluation Counselling where we are taught to *support* our leaders,
I should know better.

Steve Charlton\'s position (basically IG is improving but still has
project management problems) pretty much reflects what I believe,
including the stuff about not blaming authors for management problems.
I will add that IG shouldn\'t be blamed for the realities of business,
either - sure it\'s a shame FFS2 wasn\'t written before QSDS, but that
would have vastly delayed *any* return on investment.  IG isn\'t a
charity.

I am really glad that Traveller is back with us.  I don\'t have the money
or the will to support IG by buying bad product (which is false support
anyway IMO) or material that doesn\'t interest me, but I will consider
any and all books they bring out.  Based on what I\'ve seen from Marc, I
*will* buy T4.1; based on LWH, I *will* buy Gateway.  I still won\'t
order direct because I want to support my local (excellent) game store.

When I have enjoyed a product I try and say so - as I did with PE and
PI.  T4 has already passed TNE in terms of quantity of material of use
and/or interest to me.

My two penn\'orth.

I think that wounds reducing stats is one of the best things about CT/MT/T4
combat rules. When you are injured you do get weaker, dizzy, etc so I find
it a nice simple way to simulate realistic wounds. You don\'t need some
chart to tell you after loosing 20% of your hits you are at -1, the wound
penalties are built in.

Rob,

I have converted characters using the following method. They have all
played okay.

1) Look up career type and check that it exists in T4(!)

2) Look at skills already present and convert to T4 equivalents.
eg Astrogation from Navigation...

3) If the skill doesn\'t exist record number of points in that skill.

4) Total number of skill points and divide by <character age> - 18.

a)If this ends up >1 then do not modify the skills (except for any \'lost
points from step 3 which will be dealt with in step 6).

b)If this ends up <1 then work out how many skill points would be needed to
increase this to >1.

5) Take number of skill points required from 4b) and roll on appropriate
T4.1 character tables to allocate each point.

6) Allow player to select skills up to the total number of points from
\'lost skills\' from the appropriate character tables.

and that\'s it. Seems to work. I leave stats well alone..

A decent point.  I have a counter, though.  Remember what you paid for it. :)

I have held down a scholar career and an engineer career, alternating
twice, since term 1.  It has been almost five years since my last year or
two of Scholar, and I am thinking of going back again.  Four careers (two
twice) for twelve years.

A friend of mine has held down one career only since his college and grad
school, so two careers in twelve years, covered by the basic rules

Another friend did physics in college, software teaching in a non academic
setting, and is now an engineer, so three careers in 12 years.  This would
be problematic under the current proposed rules.

My father, in a 40 year career, was a scholar, an engineer, a broker, and a
manager.  This is also problematic.

Each of these led into the others, but it seems unlikely that someone is
going to stay with the same career for 20 years in the present day.  M0,
they might, but this seems funny _from todays_ standards.  Judging from the
other people I know, a career lasts between one traveller term and three,
with the median being somewhere around two terms, and 2-3 employers.  Since
many adventurers are in their 20s, and they have often gone to college,
this is not a problem.  Three terms - 12 years - thirty, so most
adventurers should have only one career, but I would be surprised if all.

From this, I get the idea that multiple careers should be allowed, but not
encouraged.  Further, if someone leaves the career they are in "early",
fudging is needed.  Your rules cover that, but it might be worth dropping
in a line like "The standard character generation system does not allow
more than one post education career.  With the approval of the game master,
characters could be designed who have multiple careers, but this is unusual
enough to incite comment, especially if someone has been in their present
careers fewer than three terms."

Fair enough.

So far, the Millennium\'s End chargen system is my favorite, as it is
resolved on a yearly level, and is detailed enough for good game fodder.
Unfortunately, the mechanics are clumsy, whereas the T4 mechanics are
pretty clean.

As a result, skill levels of one and two were quite common for skills a
character wanted to have as central in CT, and the young had quite an
advantage, given that first term.

I approve of the new experience rate very, very much.  A welcome change,

Yep.  This matches my experience, and I approve in general.

I would only note that the scale is a bit too linear.  It is as easy, and
as likely to go from 4 to 5, as 1 to 2.

My house rule, offered only as an insight into how we dealt with the
system, is as follows.

I make a player roll to raise a skill above 2, with failures meaning a
related skill of player choice with a lesser level is received.  The roll
is greater than current skill-2, with a six always a success.  I also have
them make a similar roll for stats, where what is important is how the stat
differs from where they started.  It is a heck of a lot easier to go from a
10 to a 12 than a 10 to a 15, imho.

For example, Bob is a Scout.  He has JOT 1, and Pilot 1.

Yr	Skill rolled	Result
1	Pilot		Pilot 2, no roll needed
2	Pilot		Rolls a 5, so gets pilot 3
3	JOT		JOT 2, no roll needed
4	Pilot		Rolls a 1, so chooses Astro 1 instead.	=09
5	Gun		Gun 1, no roll needed
6	Brawling	Brawling 1, no roll needed
7	Engineer	Engineer 1, no roll needed
8	Pilot		Rolls 4, gets Pilot 4.
9	Pilot		Rolls 1, so chooses Astro 2, as it is less than Pilot 4
10	Grav		Grav 2, no roll needed
11	+1 Str		no roll needed
12	Survey		Survey 1, no roll needed

This makes the professional level of skill stay in the 2-3 range, with a 4
still a bit noteworthy, as some people will need it.  It also means that
people will tend to get related skills, and I give the players choice to
limit the die rolling and to encourage character design.

>It is a mistake to say specifically that CT skills ranged from 1 to 6 and=
 T4
>(T41) skills range from 1 to 15. Skills in CT could range from 1 to 15 as
>well.

To be fair, though, since there are more skills received in T4, the levels
will be somewhat higher.  Not as much as one might expect, since there are
six tables, rather than four to roll on, but the skill level variance has
been increased.  (I think this is good, but it is worth noting.)

>The characteristics versus skill debate could range on forever. T41 is=
 going
>to have characteristics and skills.

Yep.  And about half the groups will not be satisfied not matter WHAT you
do.  I will use Stat/3+skill, I suspect, but I care not what anyone else
uses, as long as the tasks in the book are phrased in terms of words and
modifiers in terms of generic difficulty levels.  This is the way it has
been going, and I think it kind of neat.

>Looking deeper into the details of Skill + Characteristic, we come upon
>Competency testing... actually looking at how well a specific character can
>perform specific tasks...

Good idea.  Be sure to phrase it in a task form in the rules whenever
brought up, as then all a DM has to do is fiddle with the task system, and
the rules will still work.  (I know you have done this so far, but I like
to hammer on points that are important to me.  Hammer hammer hammer.)

Easy to translate to other skill systems, as one just need work out the
probabilities for MTS (My Task System)  Also VERY nice in that it specifies
just what a professional should be able to do.

>Position	Prime Skill	(Char)	Req S+C	Collateral Skills

Also good - it lets a player know just how well they did on their
qualifying exams.

In regards to the format of T4.1, has anyone ever seen "Advanced Squad 
Leader" by Avalon Hill.  Their rules are quite unique, presented in a 
format similar to the old U.S. Army manuals.
  All the rules are written in pages that are in a nicely decorated 3 
ring binder.  The rules themselves are colored and on good stock paper.  
The advantages of this format is that it is amenable to revision, as 
different subjects are divided within the binder, and that updated (and 
errata fixed pages) are produced in a timely fashion.  New rules can be 
added directly to the binder.
  This format may suit T4.1 well with its extensive design options 
(FF&S2), etc.  In addition, this would provide a more durable format 
than the bound rulebooks that are currently produced.

  What do you all think?

Well, me.

I use a different approach to character generation.  After it is over, I
have an optimization phase where any so-called useless skill can be
transferred within cluster.  The activity of the character id not change,
but the character\'s skill levels do.

In a previous post, I mentioned my generation rules, in which I make a
player roll to raise a skill above 2, with failures meaning a related skill
of player choice with a lesser level is received.  The roll is greater than
current skill-2, with a six always a success.

Useless skills are then counted as a gain of the useful skill, with the
gain roll required.

For example, at the end of generation, a character has gotten Liaison 3,
admin 2, SW 1.  The character got all of these as interpersonal skills.

The player attempts to raise liaison by swapping the SW.  He rolls a 6, and
so gets Liaison 4.  He also noted that he has accredited experience with
thugs. :)

He attempts to raise Liaison with one level of admin, and gets a 2.  Since
he fails, he must pick another related skill.  The player decides that this
was the time he spent in the back office, and takes a legal 1 instead.
This was a skill that could have been rolled, and is lower than his current
level of liaison.

He attempts to raise liaison again, and rolls a 5.  This is >= his 4, so
now he has liaison 5.

He could have had a liaison 6, but that would be unlikely.  He also could
have ended up with a liaison 3 and two or three other skills at 1 or 2 that
are peripherally related.  This works pretty well, in that players then end
up with spread out skills, like a lot of ones and twos.

For this to work, you do need lists of related skills, a task I am slowly
working through.  I was cheered to note that the skill clusters make the
work a lot easier.

I am fiddling with the skill definitions a bit to make them seem more
equal.  For example, liaison is better than both SW and Admin, as it serves
as both.  To fix this, I have liaison, admin, and streetwise all serving as
the generic interaction skill, and which one you have as your primary focus
changes how you do things.

The way I am doing this is making skill clusters where you will have a
strength in a skill, and get the others at reduced level.  This way, the
game can have lots of skills, which my players like, without having players
need a small notebook just to know what skills they are competent in.

No - *you* define Highly Skilled; you\'re writing the task system and 
character generation system. "Highly Skilled" should mean something like 
"a slightly better than average PC excercising the skill she\'s best at"; 
C10 is probably reasonable, and if the cgen system produces S7 that\'s what
you should use. The point is that the task system *has* to have a level of
difficulty sufficient to make it hard for talented PCs to do something - there
have to be *some* tasks that are 10% success chance or less even for the
best. (This is particularly relevant in combat tasks. If fire at maximum
range is Impossible, but good PCs have a 40% chance of succeeding at Impossible,
then a target is either completely unhittable (outside max range) or 40%
hittable; that\'s very awkward - there should be a range at which even a good
PC has a 10% chance of hitting someone. I noticed this when I did the sensor
stuff - I wanted maximum-range sensor tasks to be hard even for very good
sensor operators, but the system didn\'t support it (T4, at least.))

I\'ll soon have to run a Starship vs. G-carriers scenario for my players.

I don\'t own Starship, nor EA and FF&S2 has not even arrived in Italy.
All I have are T4, CSC, and the downloaded QSDS.
I spent a couple hours trying to reverse engineer some of the
stuff I have and coming up with a workable solution.

Here is my problems:
The Starship is more or less equivalent to a Scout/Courier, but
it\'s armed with a TL-13 Civilian laser, 29 MW power.  
The Ship\'s armor is rated as 10 according to the QSDS and T4
manual.

I worked out some numbers (with more than a little help from my
SO, which is a Computer Engineer) in order to translate all this
in something which I can use with the CSC vehicle system.

What I got is as follows:

Starship Laser
- ----
Dmg: 19, Range: Very long. 
To hit:  (Dex+Gunnery), Impossible
Fire Control will add +6
Agility for G-Carriers will give another +1 
Possibly other +DM for sensors and/or clever tactics on the PCs part.
(The range stuff is quite subjective and not based on actual
calculation). 
The laser will be able to fire once per combat turn.

Starship Armor
- ----
Some "back of the envelope" calculations gave starship hull
thickness at around 8 cm. With Superdense, it should be
something like Rigid Armor:22, according to CSC.
Unfortunately, CSC seems to imply that 22 is equivalent to USP
armor 2, instead of 10. This last part is not terribly
important, because the G-Carriers mount kinetic weapons and so
they will probably be unable to do much against the starship.
[They have goods reasons to prefer kinetic weapons on this
mission.]

The question is: are these numbers remotely similar to stuff
produced with other supplements? They seem reasonable to me, but
I\'d really hate to have to chance things later... the PCs will
probably try to use their ship as a weapon in other situations,
so I\'d like to have a minimum of constistency in this.

Or perhaps:-

1. MA does more damage than Brawling.
AND
2. MA tasks are one level harder than brawling.

MA skills as easy to obtain as brawling.

Personaly I like the rules for MA in Runequest, where after attacking
with a fist, a separate roll is made against MA skill to see if you do
extra damage.  So perhaps the following could be used.

1. Roll to Hit using Brawling.

If Hit

2 Roll against MA to see if higher damage level done.

Just some suggestions.

Personaly I prefer just brawling to cover all styles of unarmed
fighting.

It\'s probably worth mentioning, if only as an optional rule. Specify by TL

This is a well informed view of things that I completely agree with.  If
T4.1 is providing skills to characters in a similar fashion as CT
advanced chargen (mercenary, etc), then I am completely happy.

Given this, skill definitions should remain the same, which is what I
wanted in the first place.  Skill-1 is a novice;  Skill-3 is a
professional;  Skill-5 is an expert.

That\'s EXACTLY what I wanted!

Now, if we can just make sure that skills contribute as much to task
success as stats, I\'d be a really happy camper.

But, skills in T4.1 will not be like this, according to Marc\'s post
today.  He said that character\'s skills will average between 2-4, just
like in CT/MT.

You might get an occassional level 7, but that happened in CT too.

Given this information, based on Marc\'s empiracle (how do you spell that
word anyway?) evidence, we don\'t need new skill definitions.

Not according to Marc\'s new post. It looks like skills will be about the
same value as they were in CT/MT.

  Other than nostalgia, I can\'t think of a reason
> for _not_ changing the meaning of skill levels.

If the skills will be about the same value-wise, then there is no reason
at all for changing the meaning of skill levels--and it is still
backwards compatible.

So, now we are left with the problem (if you think it is a problem as I
do) of having skills contribute as much to task success as stats do.  

Thus, I bring in the multiplier, done one time and written on the
character\'s sheet.

You asked why, this is why.

I concur.  These are exactly the technologies I felt would be employed.
Now we should decide in which order (i.e. at which TL does each technology
become robust and/or generally available?

Concerning fiber optics...

As these employ visible or near visible light wavelength photons for
transmission of information, they should be considered a basic entrant
into the photonics field of technology.  I have no idea what those 
who are working with this technology consider them, but along with the 
CCDs, photoresistors, and other optical-electronic interface devices 
that they interface through, they certainly are photo-electronic
devices.

Perhaps some neologism are required (here stated with EM analogs)?

photonic - electronic (integrated circuits, small scale integrated
microcircuitry
		and logic circuits)

photic - electric (large scale power transport, lighting, etc...)

electromechanical - photoelectrical

Just a beginning.  Please comment and add to this.

Exactly.  By reducing stats, you account for damage, wound effects, and
reduced chance of success on post-wound tasks--all of this in one short,
neat, calculation.

It\'s elegant, simple, and a stroke of genius.  More RPG\'s should use
this system--not the other way around.

EX--in D&D, your character only has one hit point left, but even though
he only has 1 hit point left, he can make a STR check just as well as he
could at full health, and he has no problem hitting his opponent just as
well as he could before either.

He\'s near death, but all of his other functions operate just as good as
ever?

Traveller handles this much better.  It is one of the great things about
the game.

Guess I haven\'t read the rulebook closely enough.

I think if a skill can always be substituted at one level lower, then
the related skills *should* belong to a skill cascade. I wasn\'t aware
that Liason counts as Admin or Streetwise.

I don\'t see Liaison (a negotiation, communication skill) as being
terribly related to Admin (working within a bureaucracy) or Streetwise
(being able to "fit in", connecting with the underculture). They are
broadly related, yes, but not enough to warrant use of a reduced level
in the other skill in all situations.


In short, no skill should be "useless". If it is, then one skill has
been made too powerful (because it can "substitute" a wide variety of
skills). Related skills should belong to a cascade, skill definitions
should be made clear enough so that there is no overlap. 

Skill substitution is possible only in special circumstances dictated by
the Task Description, *no* skill should be said to *always* be a
substitute for another (ex. Pilot/Ship\'s Boat). I think the skill def\'s
need revising if this is the case.

IMHO

There was consdiderable discussion of this format when T4 was first being
discussed, the consensus ended up being (after some input from people
ewho\'ve actually _produced_ such things) that it was expensive, and people
who are in the RPG market nowadays seem to want glossy covered expensive
books rather than a three ring binder, the usual triumph of style over
utility...(how else to account for such monstrosities as the Lincoln 4x4)

Aaaaah...LBB 2 starship combat...now *that* was a system!  Triple-weapon
turrets, beam lasers, a movement system based on thumbtacks and standard
metric string-lengths...and best of all, a distance scale in which planets
were *big*, like 10 cm across or so.  Never mind that prudent starship
pilots feared enemy missile fire far less than the dreaded (and all too
common) Flying Off the Edge of the Desk...and spoke in hushed whispers of
the still more horrifying Cat Walking Around on the Desk.

(So, Douglas...what *did* become of the battered but glorious Really Big
Desk, site of so many random corsair encounters?)

	- Schools are first term careers.
	- Military careers have to be started in 1st or 2nd term,
	  if the 1st was School.
	- Civilian careers can be started later as a second career.
	- Some careers should be only for older characters, e.g.
	  Diplomat, Agent as a second career.

	I would realy like it when T4.1 would have much more careers
	( outing as a TNE guy ;-) to chose from. TNE had more color
	for character generation, while T4 is faster. In general
	I prefer the KISS principe ( Keep it simple sushi ) of T4
	rules over TNE rules (e.g. in combat) but as the character
	generation is a single and important event. I would prefer
	a wider range of pre adventure occupations.

	- Law School, Technical School, Athlethe/Martial-Artist,

	  Civil Engineer, Civil Pilot, Construction Worker, Corsair,

	  Professor/non technical, Researcher/Scientist (technical),

different functions: labor negolation & bargaining, political

wealthy and have elaborate and extensive facilities on many worlds.

Some of the guilds and associations in my universe are: the Associations
of the Imperial Navy/Army/Scouts; the Star Guild; the Mercenary Guild;
the Merchant\'s Guild, The Imperial Associations of

Guilds and Associations carry much weight within and outside the
Imperium due to their ability to organize their membership and conducts
boycotts and strikes. They have also be instrumental in their
credentialing efforts which has help merchant lines, charter companies
and the megacorporations to secure lower ship insurance rates if they
hire a fully certified crew. In fact, many companies and trading houses
will not hire uncertified personnel. A side benefit is that crew pay
scales are higher due to certification.

Depending on the skill level the testing process could take a few hours
or several days and vary from few hundred credits to thousands. The
higher the skill level the more difficult the testing. If a character
does not make his certification roll at the tested skill level, they
will temporarly lose one skill level (they did not really know the skill
after all - it was just a paper skill). They can then retest at the next
lower skill level and risk losing it as well, or not. If they pass the
test they receive formal certification. Dropping a skill level via
testing is not always permanent. If the PC enters an extensive training
program in that skill (classes and trainers are also offered by the
guilds/associations) after a specified time (usually three to six
months) they may retest. If they fail to pass on the thrid try they
generally have to wait one year to retest again. Associations and guilds
will only test those skills that are related to their profession or
trade. Of course, not all skills are testable (ie, streetwise, liaision,
bribery).

Hivers & Ithulkur for TNE claimed that the K\'Kree started eating meat as
a response to the Ithulkur soldiers eating dead K\'Kree on planets which
were low in supplies.  I realize that a lot of people out there are not
to thrilled by some of the more satirical elements of Ithulkur culture
as presented in that book but this bit always seemed like a good detail.

If we believe this accont the successful Hiver manipulation was in
duping the K\'Kree into believing that they had managed to induce
carnivorous behavior among the K\'Kree when in reality it was the
Ithulkur who had (inadvertantly) intorduced this behavior. If the Hivers
are capable of fooling the K\'Kree with these sort of lies face to face
where the K\'Kree can smell them then I think we probably need to assume
that Hivers do not give off a different smell when they are lying. 
(More proof of Hiver\'s being naturally inclined towards Manipulation. :)

mixed minds on this; I clearly remember sitting around and creating High
Guard and Mercanry characters just for the fun of it, due to the wonderful
annual detail which let me basically write a story about the character.  On
the other hand, as a GM I can recall many instances of a player wanting to
feed his character through as many different careers as possible in order
to get a wide variety of skills.  This would be classical munchkinism.

I do have a suggestion (which I used in my campaign).  I blatantly stole a
concept from GDW\'s Twilight:2000 chargen rules, and had the player roll a
d10 after each term if he decided to switch careers.  If the roll was less
than the character\'s total terms served (in all careers), chargen stopped
and the character began play.  If the player stopped chargen before the
"Play Start" roll happened, I generally gave him some nice minor bennies
(usually an extra mustering out roll or two).

The roll did not tabke place after the first term, and there was no roll if
the player stuck to one career.

Michael, Andrew and others,

Thank you. This is exactly what I hoped would happen when I posted that
question. It appears to me that of the people who have responded most
take a role playing approach to space combat, smoething that I have been
thinkng long and hard about incorperating and your replies have shown me
that it is the way to go. Again Thanks.

On a slightly off thread note, I just wanted to mention that I called my
local game store today in hopes of picking up a copy of FFS2 this
weekend. He told me 3-4 copies showed up, late due to the UPS strike and
that all were gone already! (Drat, got to be FASTER!) Well, now he has
been told to hold one for me when the reorder that he\'s already placed
comes in. Along with a copy of M:0 or M:0 Campaign which also has been
sold out since it hit the store! I guess some one out there is buying
this stuff! (how bout it any one in the South Jersey, Philadelphia area
lurking out there? I ref and am will to add players, but I really want
to PLAY! sorry for the ad ;).

Let\'s not focus on the "equal 10 or more part yet", but on the "90th
percentile" for average tasks.

I would contend that a truly competent person should succeed on Average
tasks almost 100% of the time, and on Difficult tasks around 75% of the
time.

 Staggering    1%        10%          15%           25%
 Impossible    0%         1%           2%           10%

I would further contend that NO Beginner (no matter how naturally talented)
should have a better chance of success than a Competent Professional of
*average* natural ability.  OTOH, a naturally talented Beginner should have
as good (or even a better) chance of success than a Journeyman of average
natural ability.

What do others think?

Marc, I think Bruce has made a valid point here.  Those of us who have
expressed interest in the "Great Task Debate" all have ideas as to how the
task system (and character generation system too) should be set up, but
those ideas are moot, once *you* have decided on each of the issues making
up this discussion.

Maybe, we can break this down into smaller steps, and have you sign off on
each issue as it is finalized.  That way we can keep the discussion more
focused.

For example:

Basic Task Determination Mechanic Possibilities:  

 1.  Roll a Fixed Number of dice for all tasks, and have the Target
     Number vary based on difficulty in some way.  (this is MT or TNE
     style)

 2.  Roll a Variable Number of dice for tasks based on the level of
     difficulty, and have the Target Number stay fixed based on
     Characteristic + Skill.  (this is T4 style)

Marc, I *think* you have firmly decided on mechanic number 2.  If that\'s
the case then any discussion of mechanic 1 is basically off-topic for this
particular discussion.  If I\'m wrong and you are still considering mechanic
1, then we should discuss the pros and cons of these (and the 2 or 3 other
mechanics I can think of) until you *have* decided. 

Once you announce your choice we should "hush-up" about that topic (for a
little while anyway ;-), and move on to the next topic.

I\'m going to assume (I know the joke ;-) that you have firmly decided on
mechanic 2, and T4.1 will use a variable number of dice...Please correct me
if I\'m wrong...and suggest that the next topic to be discussed should be
what you have termed Competency Levels.  Not how many dice!  Not half dice!
Not the range of skills or characteristics!

Marc, leaving aside the specific number 10 (perhaps it should be 12 or 13,
but that\'s a different discussion ;-), I don\'t think the position of
Captain should be limited to only expert pilots..pilots can be hired. The
Captain should be competent in something, certainly, but not necessarily
piloting.  She could be an expert Astrogator, Sensor Operator, even an
expert Merchant who hires the rest of her crew..don\'t you think?

OTOH, Chief Pilot, Engineer, ect. might very well require an expert in
certain specific skills.

Yes, but many of the books on the market include nice three-ring
punched holes.  Why not make a binder available (a nice D ring
binder at that) with a really good cover insert and back insert.
Maybe just the plain old Red/Black Classic Traveller "Traveller" 
and "Starship Beowulf" blurb.

After all, IG has invested in the much less useful hardcover.  Why not
a binder. I guess this could cause some assemply problems for the 
binder inserts if you also wanted to market them as a paperback so this
could, in fact, pose a problem.

debate really DID rage among academicians, industrialists and scouts
of the early Imperium.  Perhaps it persisted in Imperial circles well

It makes for both a mystery and interesting discussion, tending to add
an extra dimension to a universe.  Things like "Anomalies" would have 
added tremendous fuel to the fire (and uncertainty to individuals\'

Here\'s my suggestion (actually an enthusiastic request.  Both groups
agree on the milieu that the debate occured most vigorously in.
Create a "academic persona," a notable authority on the RoM or its
relics.  Then have at it, in character, on the list.  

Structure the discussion as an entertaining and informative debate 
(with footnotes to cite Canon sources).

Of course, most of the basic arguments have been advanced.  I just would
like to know who the old coots scrapping over this were.  Develop their
backgrounds, families, etc...  Did any of them have eligible college
aged daughters eager to prove their parents\' assertions?

Could be interesting!  Anyone else think so?

	Gee, Kenji, you say the nicest things :).  Actually, though, the

	You know, this might be due to micro-comet impact.  For those of
you who haven\'t been following this, there\'s this big controversy in the
astronomical community about this funky new class of astronomical objects
that some people are claiming to have discovered; very fluffy, house-sized
comets/snowballs.

	There are apparently very large numbers of them constantly breaking
up in Earth\'s upper atmosphere; while they only weigh a few tons each, at
the speeds involved one could certainly ruin a space probe\'s day...

	Run out and buy this month\'s Sky & Telescope or Astronomy for details.

	Yup, I remember that one.  One of my fave cartoons ever done in a
TSR publications was one of those color strips in the back of Dragon
magazine, where they were expounding on the differences between fantasy and
SF rpgs, like where weapons come from ("Forged 10,000 years ago on the
battleground of Z\'Blnith, this wand..."/"This blaster?  Sears.  23.95 on
sale.") and so forth.  Anyone remember it?

	Ahem.  I\'m actually using several FF&S2 items in my current
campaign.  Not that I\'ve actually bought it yet; I\'m working from a
playtesting copy.  However, it\'s still quite usable, even in the
fragmentary form that I\'ve got it in.  I\'m planning on buying it in the
second printing, once the errata and typos have been fixed.

	Darn... you know, a ship like that could really liven up a campaign
and provide endless roleplaying opportunities.  Evenings of fun would no
doubt be had by all (I can just see Ross\'s face as he screams "The food

>(Dex+Int for a pool shot) tasks.

One of the problems I\'ve found in adding skills and characteristics is the
effect of the outlying characteristic levels.  Very low levels (say 2 and
3) make it almost impossible to get a PC to Journeyman levels, and very
high levels (say 10+) make it impossible for a PC to NOT BE COMPETENT in
virtually every skill she learns.

For example, Jill has INT 11.  Every skill with level 1 gives her a Asset
of 12 and using 2d for Average and 2.5d for Difficult that gives her 100%
on all Average tasks and 91% on all Difficult tasks.  Jill\'s player will,
most likely, spread her rolls out to get lots of different skills that all
use INT as their base.  If Jill gets a skill to 4, then she will have a 31%
chance on Impossible tasks, and that is simply too high...even if Jill is a
naturally talented, well skilled character.

Ken (along with a lot of us) realize that a good way to handle this is to
extend the range of dice, dropping the 1/2 die at difficult.  I *think* we
could make:  2d-Average; 3d-Difficult; 4d-Formidable; 5d-Staggering;
6d-Hopeless work.

Now Jill\'s 12 gives her 100% at Average, but only 74% at Difficult, and
drops her to 2% on Impossible tasks.  Even with a skill 4, her percentages
are Diff-95%, Form-66%, Stag-31%, Impos-10%...much better, IMO.

Although, this is a good solution for our naturally talented character it
leaves characters of average and low talent in trouble.  Bob\'s INT is 7.  A
skill 1 gives him Aver-72%, Diff-26%, Form-5%, Stag-1%, Impos-0%, and even
a skill 4 only boosts him to Aver-97%, Diff-63%, Form-24%, Stag-6%,
Impos-1%.

Ken\'s solution is to multiply skill levels by 2 and extend the dice range
by one Average become 3d and Impossible becomes 7d.  This DOES work quite
well.  (Ken knows I have reservations about the details of his
implementation, but in all fairness the doubling effect works pretty well.)

As I\'ve said, in *theory*, I\'d like to get Stat and Skill on roughly the
same scales.  It looks like several others agree (and Ken does too in
effect, with skill doubling..1-6 becomes 2-12).  This implies a Stat of 7
and a Skill of 7 for an Asset of 14 for someone of Average talent and
Average skill (this *isn\'t* a Competent Professional PC, this is a
Journeyman), but folks I have real trouble with 14 being the mean
Asset..it\'s too high.  An Asset of 12 is more reasonable, and that implies
either we drop both Stat and Skill by 1 (1-11, mean 6) or accept that
skills will normally lag behind stat by a couple of points.  

I\'d like us to consider the effect of changing the Characteristics range
from 2 to 12 to a lower and/or a more narrow one.  Perhaps something like 4
to 8 with a mean of 6?

I know nobody *likes* to hear this, but we might want to consider maximum
and miniumum Stat levels for humans. Lower than the 15 we\'ve used in the
past, and higher than 1. I\'ve been thinking about a Stat range of 4 to 10,
and ways of getting it while keeping a bell curve around 7.  An advantage
of this would be to let the other species have different maximum/minimum
values for specific stats from the humans.

If you will consider using FUDGE dice then a mechanic of 3df+7 gives a nice
bell curve around the mean of 7.

No, don\'t kill it, include a few more exceptions to the rule
(explosive ammo, energy weapons, etc).  Either that or eliminate it as
a general rule and have it apply to only those methods of attack for
which it makes more sense (300 m/s and greater projectile weapons).

that of price ($150 CAN minimum just to *play* a game of ASL was a bit

I couldn\'t agree more.  It is an elegant system.  There is no need for
additional characteristics like hit points, stun points, etc.  Hit
locations can still be used which deliver more or less damage as an
optional rule without affecting the elegancy of the basic damage
system.  And due to the fact that only one~ stat has to be reduced to
zero to render a character unconscious, the randomness of exactly
*which* stat this ends up being means that 7 points of damage (as an
example) will not always render a character unconscious (unless that
character\'s three primary stats are all 7).

~ I don\'t neccessarily believe that reducing ONE stat to zero should
render a character unconscious, however; it seems a bit too straight
forward and predictable (ie: first you are rendered unconsious, then
your wounds become severe, and then you die).  People suffer grevious
injuries or die while maintaining consciousness all the time.  Perhaps
after two stats are reduced to zero, but not after only one.


Example:
=======

One stat reduced to zero: character should consider ending the fight
   pretty quick; make an Average CON test (based on current CON-- auto
   fail if CON reduced to zero) to stay conscious each 6 second combat
   round

Two stats reduced to zero: character is unconscious; character is
   also greviously injured on a failed Average CON test (based on
   current CON-- auto fail if CON reduced to zero)

Three stats reduced to zero: character is unconsious and greviously
   injured; character is also dead on a failed Difficult CON test
   (based on normal CON)


I just came up with this on the fly so don\'t flame me if there are any
glaring errors :)

Actually, to be picky, I think Marc has said the average is more like 
1.25/year, meaning 25 skill levels over 20 years...

I believe there will be more level 2-4 skills than you estimate (just 
from what I\'ve seen of 4.1 chargen)

I think it\'s quite possible to get higher than 5 in a skill. Are you 
suggesting that we put a cap on skills?

A question that\'s been bugging me: WHY is this important?

Mechanics of CT and T4 are vastly different. T4 has a task system, CT had 
modifiers. T4 takes attributes into account. CT in general, didn\'t. T4 
even has different skills than CT.

It\'s /illogical/ to insist that skill level defs be the same, so that T4 
skills are interchangeable with CT skills. (geez -- I feel like Spock, 
but Illogical is the best word)

I think skill level def\'s need to be looked at, by an empirical study of 
what skill levels are common buy hashing through chargen, or skill def\'s 
need to be decided and chargen adjusted to reflect this.

>And the balance between the old and new is secured.

To reiterate: WHY?

Once a suitable skill range is decided, then CT characters can be 
converted by a simple (likely just a multiplication factor) formula. CT 
adventures need to be converted wholesale anyway, if T4\'s task system is 
to be used.

It may end up in the final analysis that skills do indeed average 1-6 in 
t4.1 chargen. In that case: so be it. I just don\'t see why it\'s necessary 
to assume a priori that this *needs to* be the case.

>This is what I would like to see.

I don\'t want to see it if it means skills have far less meaning than 
stats, or if it means skill level def\'s don\'t sync with what is possible 
with chargen.

I believe it would be far neater and tidier to have skills and 
characteristics on the same scale -- without another converting step. As 
has been stated, this makes stats and skills truly interchangeable.

(\'course, that\'s why I like FUDGE. mmmmmm fuHDge... drooool...)

gotta run. gettin\' hungry.

Doug, that\'s perfect for me.  I\'ve settled on 1 meter squares/hexes for
deckplans and 6 second turns for personal combat.  I know 1.5m is CT
traditional, but I always thought the squares were a little large:

  1.5
 +----+----+
 |A  |  B|
 +----+----+
      1.5

The way I see it A and B are as much as 3 meters apart but still in
adjacent squares.  That\'s pretty spread out for a knife fight, not that
I\'ve been in many knife fights.  ;-> Even if you put A and B in the middle
of their respective squares they are still 5 feet apart (1.5 meters), and
that\'s *still* too spread out...IMO.

Hans, I agree with both you AND Marc on this one.  On one hand, CharGen
should be fast, easy to complete, and not substitute from actually
adventuring. On the other, I\'ve spend many evenings (when I didn\'t have a
group to play with) generating characters using the CT Advanced methods,
and added tables for all kinds of details, imagining the lives of the
characters I was rolling out.  Only occasionally, would one of these
characters make it into a game, but I was certainly entertained.

Perhaps, what we need here are "get the character finished and into the
game" rules in the rulebook, and a suppliment (or series of articles in
JOTAS) with more advanced rules for generating extremely detailed
characters. Not more powerful characters, but characters with more life
experiences detailed.

As for as careers are concerned, I *do* think second careers should be
allowed even in the standard rule set. More difficult, perhaps, but
allowed.

I hope Ken answers this.  He seems absolutely *fixated* on skills being in

Yep, if I was comfortable using FUDGE with all the Traveller Tech, I\'d
probably convert completely.

Here\'s my latest suggestion use 3f+7 for Stats, with no points up/down that
go outside the range of 4 to 10.  Award *2* skills per year where a skill
can\'t be selected/rolled more than twice per term.  Count the first 18
years as a term worth 8 skill levels.  A 20 year career yields 48 skill
levels spread across a number of skills.

Yes, medical should be able to substitue for first aid, but I wonder if 
this should be on a one for one basis or a one (medical) to two (first 
aid) ratio.... lots of docs (i.e. pathologists, internists, etc don\'t do 
much first aid stuff... scary isn\'t it?

This could be touchy, are we going to provide a subskill for Surgery?  
Or like in CT proclaim those docs with dex>8 surgeons?  Surgeons are 
much more adept at identifying and treating injuries (and markedly so) 
compared to their nonsurgical colleagues.

Hmmnn, it should almost seem that someone who takes medical skill should 
have some chemistry and biology skill as a prerequisite.... speaking 
firsthand, its not used oftern in medical practice, but they made us 
learn it in college and again in med school... part of the selection

 As indicated by someone earlier, this should be Psychiatry... which 
should be treated like surgery and be made a subskill of Medicine (since 
psychiatrists are M.D.s and can pescribe drugs, and psychologists are 
Ph.D.s and can\'t prescribe).

   If this is so, then those who are "surgeons" should get First Aid 
skill equivalent to their surgery skill.

"Heavy water" is deuterium oxide (D2O). It\'s noticeably denser than
normal water (thus the name) and because the deuterium is heavier than
regular hydrogen, it reacts more slowly in chemical reactions. t also
causes some trouble in biovhemical reaction, thus it is classed as
somewhat toxic (really!).

It\'s used as a moderator in some types of nuclear reactors. That is,
it\'s the stuff that slows fast neutrons liberated by fission, so that
they are slow enough to induce fission easily. Another common moderator
is graphite.

A lot of other people have posted some good stuff, but there are a few
points they missed. First of all the "Trojan" solution requires that
the primary be at least 30 times as massive as the body orbiting it
(actually 29 and a fraction). And the bodies in the Trojan points have
to be of "negligible" mass.

Second, while the L1, L2, and L3 points *are* unstable, it is possible
to have a stable orbit *around* them, as long as it is at right angles
to the line connecting them with the center of the primary. There are
several satellites that have used this trick.

What *I* would like is a "formula" for figuring the location of L1, L2,
and L3 for any given pair of bodies...

Don\'t forget that Texas still has the option (one of the conditions

While I keep seeing "sonic showers" in SF, I have trouble believing in
them. The "theory" is that you use ultrasonic waves to "shake loose"
the dirt and such like. I don\'t buy it. For one thin, dead skin
requires active measures (like a rough washcloth or a loofa) to get it
loose. Also, various skin oils and other secretions have to be removed
with water and or surfactants (soap). Finally, ultrasound doesn\'t
travel well through air.

Water for showers isn\'t all the big a problem, as humans convert food
and oxygen into water and wastes. So you\'ll end a trip with more water
than you started with, and water is fairly easy to recycle.

Refrigerators don\'t have to use freon. Freon was just a convenient gas
that has the right properties to be a good refrigerant (liquefies under
moderate pressure even in the tropics, and vaporises at normal
pressures) but unlike the older refrigerants (ammonia and chlorine)
isn\'t toxic.

There are thermo-electric units that use electricity *directly* to pump
heat from one side to the other. Staged, they could do the job nicely,
but they do use a *lot* more power.

The problem with using CG is that CG provides a force pushing up, it
doesn\'t neutralize gravity. Thus, the resulting bed wouldn\'t be "zero
G", it\'d be like a waterbed or like the skydiving trainer that uses the
highspeed fan to support you in mid-air. Your weight would be
"balanced" by an upward force, rather than cancelled. The feeling is
going to be different.

Sure, but it isn\'t anti-gravity. Anti-gravity *does* have the kind of

You missed my point *entirely*. It\'s perfectly possible that 80x86 type
chips will be part of dedicated controller units *long* into the
future. They are cheap, easy to fabricate, and the design is well
understood. 

The room thermostat will be a "dedicated controller" that interfafces
to the appropriate ship\'s systems.

It allows faster switching speeds and thus is used in high frequency
work. It\'s also a lot more expensive because unlike silicon, gallium is
fairly rare.

While photonic circuitry may be possible, anything that needs to
control *power* will have to interface with *electronic* circuitry. So
a lot of low level stuff wil be electronic, simply because it doesn\'t
need the speed, and does need to control electrical systems. It\'ll have
some sort of interface to the photonic stuff if it needs to link with it.

Why? As I said, they\'ll be the cheapest way of doing things that have
to control *electrical* stuff. We still use relays, even relay logic
circuits, in current equipment. And those are over 100 years old.

If you have something that works better, is cheaper, and is more
reliable, then you use that. But sometimes the old stuff works fine.

The idea makes sense, and the results could potentially be cool, but, only if it was
done right.  For example, TSR did the "Monstrous Compendium" in a similar format,
but they didn\'t think right.  The alphabetical order didn\'t flow right, and the material,
IMHO, were chintzy.  None of the advantages they claimed really worked in
practice.

So, if done right, it could be cool.  However, would it turn newer players off?  Would it
sell?  Those are the kind of things we have to ask.

I agree. The notation of captain in the example was badly placed. Actually,

no no no. You roll 50 dice and record the rolls in sequence. Then the first 6
are the characteristics. The advantage is that you can waste rolls on
(attempts to enlist perhaps) that you know will fail in order to get the
right rolls (which you know are ahead in the sequence) for the attempts you

I\'ve just read the first three books of the Seafort Saga, by David
Feintuch.  The series reflects closely (at least for military ships) your
comments. Sort of like the Hornblower series in space (with all of
Hornblower\'s meglomania, depression, and messed up head...) In the series,
the technical officers are staff - engineer, doctor, pilot, etc. The
captain is the leader who orchestrates the activities of the crew. Just
like in real life...

   I agree completely.  The publication of material by outside companies
benefits the game (greater diversity), the game publisher (free
advertising anyone?), and the hobby in general (if for no other reason
than it takes up shelf space that a FLGS might be tempted to use for
some low-class CCG).  While it is possible to keep everything internal
(IIRC Games\' Workshop works this way), small to medium-sized operations
get a tremdous benefit from licensing other vendors to produce product.

   TTC #13 is in the process of being completed (an artist for a crucial
project busted up her drawing arm if you can believe that).  Good news
on the shipping date should follow soon.  In future issues, I expect to
publish both Traveller and Marc Miller\'s Traveller material (we are in
need of good quality artwork and articles for both).

   As for the missing issues, send me your particulars and I\'ll take the
matter up with Kevin Knight, who still handles circulation matters.

I agree with James here.  Originally, I didn\'t like the rule--but 
that was because I did not understand it.

Now that I know why it is in there, it makes much more sense to me.  
Maybe there should be some explanation as to why the 3D Max rule is 
in the rules given in the text?

And, I\'m happy with that.

Nope.  I just wanted T4 skills to compatible with CT/MT skills.  Even 
in CT/MT, we occassionally saw a level 8 skill.  As long as it is 
just occassionally, I\'m happy seeing level 8 skills in T4.  What I 
don\'t want is a character with two level 12 skills, four level 10 
skills, several level 8\'s, etc.

I\'m very much happy with what Marc and others have posted as to how 
T4.1 characters will turn out.  I think that they are very compatible 
with CT/MT now that I\'ve seen that.

I wish Marc would have posted that earlier.

> A question that\'s been bugging me: WHY is this important?

I saw Eris\' post wishing that I would answer this, but the plain fact 
is that this is moot now in my book due to Marc\'s recent post.

I could strew you with the why\'s and whyfor\'s of my thinking on this 
matter, but it doesn\'t mean anything anymore because I believe that I 
am gettting what I want in T4.1 chargen.

Before, I was not sure that T4.1 would turn out that way.

Disagreement here, but, again, discussing this is moot.

Well, ASL sells on the virtue of its components; a T4.1 need not be done 
in such full-colored splendor as ASL required... and the flexibility of 
the binder system favors T4.1 over a wargame such as ASL.

If we make exceptions, they must be VERY clear... too many 
interpretations have arisen from the 3D rule now.... and though I tend 
to agree with the logic James uses in restricting the rule to projectile 
weapons, but as a matter of playability, who would want to use them in a 
Traveller universe if this were so???   Slug throwers would be wimpy 
weapons shunned by the serious adventurer.  I don\'t think wimpy slug 
throwers are what we have in mind.

If we make exceptions, they must be VERY clear... too many 
interpretations have arisen from the 3D rule now.... and though I tend 
to agree with the logic James uses in restricting the rule to projectile 
weapons, but as a matter of playability, who would want to use them in a 
Traveller universe if this were so???   Slug throwers would be wimpy 
weapons shunned by the serious adventurer.  I don\'t think wimpy slug 
throwers are what we have in mind.

I agree with this fully.  

Marc, you also mentioned how in MT and CT advanced char gen
character\'s received 1-1.25 skills/term and that in T4.1 they also
receive 1.25 skills/term.

If this is the case why change the skill level meanings?  In CT/MT 
Medical 3 = Doctor, naval Architect 3 = Professional.  These 
distinctions were all written down in the rules.  If character\'s 
receive approximately the same number of skills in 
approximately the same ranges then why change the meanings
of the skill levels?

My take on the Task System/Chargen/Skills quandary:

IF skills and stats really are going to be of equal effect in T4.1, then
you seem to have only TWO workable choices before you:

1) Redefine skill levels such that an Expert level is 7-8.
   Thus skills and stats will be on roughly the same scale. For both stats
AND skills, 3 to 4 is low, 11 or 12 is high. Anything higher is
exceptional. In this case, the Task System, which adds stat and skill,
generally does not make high-stat novices more capable than average-stat
experts. No skill multiplier is necessary.

 OR

2) Keep CT skill definitions, in which an Expert level is about 4.
   But if you go with this (as I fear you are doing) then stats are still
about twice as effective than skills. It means that 5 is a very high skill,
whereas 5 is a low stat. Thus high stats far outweigh high skills.
   If you must keep it this way, I suggest (as *strongly* as I possibly
can) that you use Ken\'s multiplier in the Task System. If you don\'t,
high-stat novices will always be able to out-do average-stat experts. And
that was what we complained was wrong with T4. We wanted that *fixed*,
right?

Right now, unfortunately, it looks like you\'re planning to go with 2), but
not with a skill multiplier, and I think that would result in a broken
system.

You have pointed out that T4.1 characters have a big batch of skills in the
1-4 range, with very few at 5-6, and maybe one at 7+. I got the same
results myself. But you seem to imply that skill level 4 should therefore
be considered an Expert, as it was in CT. Is this what you meant? If so, I
think this is very wrong, assuming skills and stats are supposed to be on
an equal footing.

If you go with 1), some way should be found to consolidate skill levels
during Chargen; that is, I think that T4.1 characters have too many skills
in the low 1-3 range, and not enough in the mid to high range of 4+.
Chargen is good, but it needs tweaking.

If you go with 2), then Chargen should be changed to make it harder to
achieve levels of 10 or more. If the Task System applies a multiplier to
the skill level, as in KBv2.0, such high skill levels are unnecessary, and
they produce absurdly high TNs. (Besides, if Broker-4 is an Expert broker,
what the heck is a Broker-10? Or a Broker-14 for that matter? With T4.1
Chargen, these are entirely possible.)

Personally, I don\'t care if you go with either of these proposals, or if
you suddenly come up with something else. Both of the above suggestions
have their merit. Either can be made to work.

But I disagree strongly with the way you\'re headed right now.

My main points again:

  *Please DON\'T say that 4 is an Expert skill. It should be 7-8.

  *If an Expert is level 4, then use a skill multiplier in the Task System
so that skills and stats have equal effect. (i.e. TN = stat + [2 * skill])

Please consider this very carefully. We\'ve gone over and over this, but I\'m
sorry to say that you seem to be missing some important implications.

Thanks for listening,

something to add. Speaking from a sociological PoV most people do generally
have two (and only two) careers, in western societies the changeover usually
occurs in your 30\'s or 40\'s (in societies with shorter life expectancies it
comes sooner). What most people are confusing as career changes are actually
simple job changes. In a career change the entire focus of the persons life
changes, generally requiring learning entirely new skills; in a job change the
same skills are used, but in a different way. For example Phil trains at
collage as an engineer. After graduating Phil is employed in several jobs,
designing pumps, teaching at a small university, junior manager in a
construction company. These are not career changes, as Phil is using and
improving in the same general group of skills in each job (Phil can be regarded
as either a bureacrat or scholar at this time). Later, Phil has settled,
established a comfortable asset base, married; basically achieved a solid
degree of security in life. What generally hapens at this point is that Phil
will start to question his career path, "Is this what I want to be doing"
(the classic "mid life crisis"). It is at this point that Phil may well change
career, branching out in an entirely new direction giving more satisfaction.
In Traveller, at this point Phil chooses to become an adventurer. The only real
exception to this general pattern is military service. It is not uncommon for
the first "term" after collage to be spent in the military. This can either be
compulsary military service (as in much of Europe) or simply a cultural
imperative (such as in Japan and parts of the US). This is more a "rite of
passage" than a "career". Unusually, this process and pattern appears in
virtually all Human cultures, with the time frame compressed or expanded in
proportion to the average life expectancy.

So I\'d say, for Humans, the one career rule is a good one. With the possible
exception of a first term in the military, but only if the character does not
choose the military as a career. I think people are failing to recognise the
basic flexibility of the Char gen process. A single "career" can represent
a whole lot of options. Most of them cover a whole range of employment options,
and can easily accommodate most of the job changes that people are confusing
with career changes.

	In the kitbashed set of combat rules that I use, I put the limit at
4 dice and apply it only to non-HE slugthrowers.  Everything else does its
rated damage.  So basically, it\'s an exception to the rule rather than a
rule with a vast majority of exceptions.

	And I like the idea of lethal combat rules: I also use Glenn
Grant\'s hit location table, so sometimes the wound will kill if not treated
immediately.  When combined with multiple damage on called shots, it\'ll
probably make the first real balanced combat I throw at them into a killer
(so far, Rye-Ben terrorists armed with Bullpup-9\'s and nukes don\'t count).
It keeps the game rational, because people know that getting shot can kill
the character dead on the spot, just like IRL.  Saves things from
degenerating into the adolescent "The dentist\'s receptionist told me I\'ll
have to wait ten minutes?  I shoot her!" sort of silliness.

	Well, basically, because this is the Far Future, and lasers and
plasma guns are highly funky technotoys that add a certain amount of
flavour and colour and extreme lethality?  Besides, as I formulate it, the
rule doesn\'t apply to explosive rounds; so snub pistols are still viable,
and larger-bore weapons firing explosive rounds are still plenty nasty.
Assuming I ever have time enough to ref much Traveller again, I think I\'ll
have personal weaponry gradually shifting to lasers and gauss weapons as
the Imperium moves up in TL.  At first, I was surprised to see that Trav
still used slugthrowers at higher TL\'s, but after reading why in FF&S1, and
running a few designs, it made a certain amount of sense to me...

Frankly, writing tasks for the skills in the next chapter gives great insight

trying to translate the implied tasks into standard notation.

Sounds OK to me.  In fact, I like it better than the \'official\' levels, but
from what I hear of the new task system (and skill levels) Marc likes
something different.

Oh well, looks like I\'m going to be following Marc\'s advice and modifying
rules (like the task system) to better suit my players.

True. I am writing it. I find that checking my work against the criticism
helps me fine tune the final text.

1. There are some people I will never win over. More than that, their
criticisms keep coming back. I was motivated in this round to speak up again
when the post stated that I had made the new range of skills 1-15 (average
7), putting some set of words in my mouth. I was trying to establish the
foundations everyone thought were there, and what the criticisms were.

2. I am currently writing the text of Skills, which should (and does) include
task examples. Writing sample tasks for every single skill shows the wide
variety of tasks available.

For example, it is clear that there have to be tasks with skill only (no
characteristics). There have to be tasks with characteristics only (no
skill). There have to be tasks with skill possible but optional. Then there
are Uncertain, Hasty, etc etc.

If definitions means saying Skill-1 is this, Skill-2 is that, then that\'s
true.

On th eother hand, when a whole text of Electronics is

"Nearly anyone can wire a light to a battery, but dealing with electronic
devices is an entirely different matter. A person with this skill has
expertise in the operation and repair of such equipment. Electronics skill
allows a character to understand, manipulate, assemble, and fix complex or
even alien electronic devices. Obviously, some rolls will be harder than
others, and many may be impossible without sufficient tools.
        Education is normally the attribute associated with this skill, but
Intelligence may be of more assistance when dealing with alien devices or
malfunctions of an unusual nature."

and half the text is taken up saying maybe you could use Edu or Int to help
you, I think we need new skill texts... including example tasks, discussion
of several areas where Electronics can be applied like,

	Diagnosis of Faults.
	Repair and Maintenance.
	Equipment Design (Modular).
	Equipment Design (Custom).

etc.

Excellent idea.  I\'d doing all my deck plans at 2m per inch so they look OK
with 25mm figures, but with the choice of 1" or 0.75" grid overlays (for 2m
squares and 1.5m squares respectively).

No, not until the final closing.  The knife fights I\'ve seen (admittedly not
many) have been mostly circling matches until a final tangle.  4-6 feet
sounds about right.

Columbia Games is learning that the added expense hurts sales.. HarnMaster
II is a very slow seller (even for Harn stuff) since th cost of the heavy
paper stock and the binder drove the basic rules to near $50.

When we moved up to the City, no one wnated to take the desk, so we cut it

with a chainsaw in my hands....

I shy away from any statement that somebody will succeed 100% of the time.
There is always the chance of failure.

I would agree, except for the fact that the first time I fired a M-16 for
qualification I hit 39 out of 40 targets.  This was with 2 weeks experience
with the weapon.  It\'s fairly obvious that I shot better than 90% of the US
Army based on my natural ability.  

One thing that\'s been missed in this debate is that aging tends to take
care of the uber-character\'s physical stats.  Stick around long enough and
you\'ll have great skills and low characteristics.  As for INT and EDU, I\'ve
rarely seen players devote themselves to pushing those characteristics up
unless it was appropriate for the character\'s conception.

I\'m including a hit location system as an optional rule on TACS (which
should be done today, BTW), some people really want one, some people think
it slows the game down too much.

In TACS, when one stat is reduced to zero, you need to make a task roll
every turn to stay conscious.  When two stats reach zero, this task becomes
very difficult, and has to be attempted for every action you try.  (ie, you
crawl 2 meters and try to fire a shot.. you\'d have to roll to avoid passing
out three times.) If you get down to zero on all three physical
cahracteristics, say goodnight, Gracie!  You are greviously wounded, and
have only minutes before you bleed to death.

Wounds also deteriorate under my new system, so PCs with First Aid will
have something to do.

You got Scrounging too, eh? Yeah, it\'s one of the more useful skills in my
campaign, up there with JoAT. Here\'s my definition:

	Scrounging	Int, Soc

  The character is skilled in finding items such as spare parts, tools,
weapons, etc. Scrounging involves more than just randomly searching, and
does not necessarily mean stealing items or doing anything illegal. The
character may be able to call in favors or be able to assemble a working
item from discarded junk. An individual with this skill is familiar with
the kinds of places to search for a particular item and the people likely
to have it. In the case of a previously contacted inhabited world, the
individual will have knowledge of the proper inhabitants to contact
regarding the availability of items, local laws governing their sale and
possession, and be aware of specific areas on the planet where goods are
most likely to be found.

Scrounging is in the Charisma skill cluster.

vague in Traveller. Since the time of the pharaohs humanity has searched
for the aqua vitae and the fountain of youth. And when is becomes available
it seems to have had no significant social consequences. Considering the
extremes people have gone to in history to gain eternal youth, even if
anagathics were totally illegal, cost millions of dollars per dose, and had
a 1% chance of working, a significant proportion of the population would
still do anything to get them.

I think the existing aging rules in T4 are fine, but there should be more
information on the effects on anagathics on aging rolls. I like the idea of
different forms of anagathics at different tech levels. While few player
characters ever die of old age, the existence of centuries-old characters
should have a significant effect on the society and game system. The
character generation rules should also take anagathincs into effect.
Perhaps a Formidable task against Soc each aging crisis during character
generation will allow the character to make the roll under the effect of
the local tech level\'s anagathic.

I plan on making anagathics just give one a DM on aging rolls in M:0. The
"stop aging" anagathic is a higher TL.

Yup!

Thinking to print it as it looks on Friday, I started to upload it in the
one copy of WFW97 at work and Doc Solomons went mad. So I didn\'t. But
MacLink 8 converted it happily as a Word 6 file into Clarisworks on my
Powerbook, so I bypassed that problem!

	Easy      : 3d6

In the UK we have two or four hole binders... so I would not be that
impressed with three hole ones. IIRC most of Europe uses two hole as well...

But it\'s a US game ;-&

One thing that the rules do need is a subtly different cover - the T4 rules
have a \'broken\' reputation - reprinting them without something on the front
cover like \'revised and enhanced\' may not help to overcome this problem.

The problem is that the "lost world" people use myth and mysticism to
support their points, and fail to come up with proof.  The same applies to
the RoM debate.  We have it written down in several places that the RoM
achieved TL12, and it is accepted as "TML canon" that at the end, they
might have reached TL13 in some spots, with medical technolgy in the
experimental TL14 range.

The Solomanist position has claimed everything from the RoM being TL16 to
them having the same genetic technology as the Ancients! (TL25+).  There
hasn\'t been a single piece of evidence forwarded that explicitly supports
this position.  Even the terraforming arguement was shown, upon review, to
be useless.

Leroy, and any of the alleged "silent majority" who accept his views, are
welcome to run their games as a d/u/n/g/e/o/n/ c/r/a/w/l/ search for
m/a/g/i/c/a/l/ high tech relics.  TNE used this approach, and it was one of
the largest failings of the setting IMHO.

For the purposes of general discussion of on the Traveller Mailing List,
and for those of us who attempt to write for publication, we should stick
with the accepted, or canonical, history.  The RoM had a common TL of
high-end 12, any assumption otherwise will have to show proof in the
established body of Traveller work.

Now, if a T4 product is released that states that the RoM was TL14, or 17,
or 35 and run by Elvis\' clone; then that will overrule what has come
before.  In a similar vein, if Marc or Loren were to speak out and say "we
intended it to be this way", I believe that would settle much of the
arguement.

To be honest, "Anomalies" occupies the posistion of "best of the worst" for
T4.  I really haven\'t found allt hat much to use in that particular book.
Traveller has survived publications that violated canon before.  Remember
the Leviathan and it\'s 1/2ton jump torpedos?  The King Richard from FASA?
Hell, most any ship design from FASA.  I place the TL14 vacc suits in
"Anomalies" in that category: a mistake.  Make them TL13 and I can buy the
premise, since it would make sense that the Navy-dominated RoM would
develop cutting edge space equipment before the Long Night.

When the ISBA started doing that, there was a great deal of resitance to
on-line roleplay occuring here.  That\'s why we moved over to our own list.
While interesting, I don\'t think it would work since we don\'t have enough
*real* information to debate.   

This would come up the day after I take the RCCC comment out of my .sig

	Well, actually, I was thinking about sending you a six-pack of

Guiness brewed by Famille Spofulam and you\'ll get the concept quite nicely

The stats for the laser bays, 1/2-0-0-0, are what are listed in QSDS1.5 and
that is what I used for designing my THUDDD entry.  After the entry was
finished, I then went back and redesign the ship using some speadsheets found
on the Vyborg Campaign wep page.  I desigend a laser that used the same power
and was the same volume or less than that listed in QSDS and ended up with
the following design:
- ----
Vol(m3)  Mass(ton)  Power(MW)  Area(m2)  Price(MCr)
351      511        111.111    44        38.3

ROF  Short       Medium     Long       Extreme
100  10:1/13-42  20:1/7-21  40:1/3-11  80:1/2-5

Battel Riders:  L(-2)10:2-1-0-0
T4:             1/3-2-0-0

- ----

I\'m at a loss as to why, despite using the same amount of power, my design is
smaller, cheaper and more effective (I also double check the design using a
speadsheet by Dave Golden).  Someday I may change the T4 stats for the Kukri
class SDB on my web page but I think its proable too late for my THUDDD
entry.

     Based on evidence in Scandinavian graveyards they, too, practiced
selective female infanticide and ended up with a gender ratio of 7 or 8 to
1! Far more pronounced than we are currently seeing. The result? Well,
large bands of angry young men roaming from as far as Nova Scotia to

I understand the reasoning behind the blowthrough rule too, but why 3d? 
Why not 4d?  

Why not a different number of dice based on the bulk of the target?
Something like: for human sized targets, 4d; for smaller targets 2d; for
larger targets 5d; for elephants and whales 6d; etc.

That\'s the thing Rob, if Marc has made up his mind firmly about specific
portions of the rules, I wish he would tell us what he\'s decided and say,
"No more discussion on this topic is requested at this time."  As it stands
now, I\'m not sure what he\'s decided and what he\'s still open to
modification on. 

Yes, it looks very likely that I\'ll be modifing the rules (heck, rewriting
them ;-) extensively too.  Might as well get started.

Ken, that depends on the scale of the target numbers.  There\'s no reason
the skill component of the target number shouldn\'t be 8, 10, 12, if the
scale is arrainged appropriately.

So, tell the truth Ken, are you still going to use KB2? ;->

I don\'t have a source, but I thought the Imperium reached TL15 *during

We don\'t *enjoy* IG-bashing. We\'d all be much happier praising them rather 
than burying them, but when one product (CotI) is a year late, most are full 
of errors, and some are so bad it\'s embarrassing (like Starships), what else 
can we do? We want IG to succeed, but we also want products that are properly 
proof-read and playtested, and come out on time (in that order).

My vote would be to lose the D3 and use (stat/2)+skill. This would reduce the 
dominance of stats over skills, and in the process make tasks harder.

It\'s funny, but i\'ve gotten more writing done in the last few days on
massive doses of Prednisone than I\'ve accomplished in months.  Of course,
85% of it makes the works of William S. Burroughs look like "Dick and Jane
go to Sylea", but some of it is worthwhile.

I was chatting with a net friend who runs a microbrewery in Oregon.. he\'s
offered to do a run of Scout Brew if I design and print up the labels.  now
we have to have a Traveller Con!

Let\'s drink to excess!

Why do so many Traveller afficionadoes believe in "gravitics" as some
mysterious science with potential beyond "mere" artificial gravity and
thruster plates?  Gravity is the weakest of the fundamental forces, thus
I doubt it would be as effective a basis for technology as E&M (either
electronic, photonic, or photic (to use another poster\'s term)) or,
certainly, nucleonic forces.

This is not a flame -- merely a polite disagreement.

Actually, I wonder if that rule still applies.  After all, Texas had to be

Did we ever decide if it\'s reasonable for TL13/14 equipment to last for

You heard right; it\'s just that the Lagrange point "names" L1 through L5
are for the _points_, not for the points in the Earth-Sun-Moon system.

Quick diagram (works much better than words); P is the primary, S is the
secondary, 1-5 are Lagrange points 1 through 4:


                                        4




         3                      P              1 S 2




                                        5


L4 is the leading point, L5 is the leading point (taking into account
the motion of the secondary around the primary*).  L1-3 are never
stable.  L4 and L5 can be stable if the primary is more than about 25**
times the mass of the secondary; otherwise, they too are unstable.

.. 

* Of course they orbit each other, but you know what I mean.

** Actually, more like 24.9599.

Even if skill level 3 is treated as Professional in most fields Doctors
should still be skill level 6 (six).  Doctors go through many years of
schooling, college (in which they may or may not take a pre-med course),
graduate (Medical) school, and after grad (medical) school they _still_
have to go through an apprenticeship program (an internship, etc) before
they are considered fully professional.  This many years of training -
most of which is _quite_ harsh - should produce high levels of skill in
a Doctor. It is certainally true that if we were to broaden out the
Medical skill into several subfields not all of the training med
students and interns receive would all be towards the generic Medical
skill but I still think skill level 6 in needed for a Doctor.  I would
not want someone as _my_ Doctor IRL if they did not have skill level six
or more.

That\'s exactly what I was saying.  I was speaking of skill levels, not

Interesting idea, but how are you coming up with target numbers?

In your example, the level 3 character has to roll 2D6 for a Difficult
task.  What is his target number?   Lower than what on 2D6?

I really don\'t want to, but it depends on if Marc fixes the problem of
characteristics having too much influence over skills with regard to
success at tasks.

KBv2.0 was designed to correct two things in T4--the half die and the
stat vs skill problems.

If Marc fixes the stat vs skill problem and still uses the half die,
I\'ll probably switch to his official system.

If Marc does not fix the stat vs skill problem, whether or not the half
die is included,then I\'ll keep KBv2.0.

In my eyes, it is a serious problem when a level-1 medic can out perform
a level-4 medic just because the novice has a high Edu.

I\'d like to see that fixed.

The problem with using a method of dividing stats is that stats change
in combat.  When your character gets wounded, you have to recalculate
again.

That\'s why I went with multiplying the skill (instead of dividing the
stat) in KBv2.0.  Skills never change during combat.  You\'ve already
made the calculation and written it in its own column right next to the
skill.

All you have to do is add that number to your stat (whatever it
currently is) and roll dice--you\'re rockin\' and rollin\' just as quickly
as you would be if you were just adding skill + stat.

It seems to me that dividing the stat becomes too cumbersome during
play--"Oh, my character just took five points of damage!  I\'ve got only
3 points of Dex left!  Let\'see...that\'s 2 points or only 1 point do I
add to my skill level when I shoot back?"

True.

A point about the CT/T4 task comparisons everyone seems to be missing.

CT and T4 will have (apparently) the same skill levels. However, CT tasks
(once CT got a task system) only used stat/5, not the entire stat.  True, the
target numbers were different, but the amount contributed by the stat was
(usually) less than that contributed by the skill.

This is the change in balance that bothers me (and, I think, Eris and the
others).  It doesn\'t matter if skills have the same numerical value as they
did in CT/MT, because their effects will be different.

That stated, I have a suggestion.

Before we discuss specifics like numerical levels, lets decide the
chance-of-success (in %) for people at different competency levels (label,
eg. Novice, Professional) at different task difficulties (standard task
names).

Once this is settled (!), we can worry about exact numbers (ie. dice rolled,
attribute and skill levels, multipliers or lack thereof, and so on).  I
suspect a lot of these numbers will be fairly obvious if we can take this one
step at a time.

Actualy, I\'ll go further.  Marc, as this is your game, what do _you_ see as
being the chance of success for various task difficulties?

And the Solomani were not uniformly TL14 or TL15 either.  The assumptions
can generally cancel, and if they don\'t, they go to the advantage of the
Imperium.  Try the opposite angle of view on this problem, if the Solomani
_only_ had TL14 outfitting, and _that_ was not a majority, then the outcome
of the war would not have been a _stalemate_--the Solomani _must_ have been
TL15 in their sphere, and fairly well established as such, or it would have
just been No Contest--the Solomani would have been pasted, and hung up to
dry--none of this armistice with no formal recognition nonsense, allowing
the Solomani to retreat and regroup at Home, in Aldebaran.

Sorry, I guess I thought you were talking about the Solomani, _not_ the
Imperial forces.  Yes, that is reasonable, but as I have pointed out,

  1) the games use of TL is somewhat blurred anyway, and

  2) with the MT boost to things, just add +1 to Solomani Tech from the
     I:E perspective

Just like the Solomani having to watch the Aslan, Hivers and possible
client state encroachments if they were to pull everything out.  True,
the Solomani were more desperate, but they barely made a dent in the
coreward frontier, and were repulsed rather easily.

Actually, given the assumptions I previously made, if the Solomani are only
TL14, I\'d give the Imperium at least a 4:1 advantage in the Rim War.  The
Solomani are not as well organized militarily as the Third Imperium--no
depots, etc. etc. etc.

Not really.  The library data of I:E makes it clear that both sides knew
was portends the future held, and were roughly prepared.  Remember, it was
120 years after the declaration of the Solomani Confederation before the
Rim War broke out.

As I said, a "revision" applied to MT took care of this.  Yes, that presents
a problem for trying to understand a consistent timeline, however consider
that from my reading of the differences between Supplement 10 and the
Alien Module 6: Solomani (both CT), it is clear that GDW was taking a step
back from some of the things that had been written in the earlier source.

Thank You, but I can\'t even remember Occam\'s razor, let alone apply it. :)

The first statement is true.  As the vast Imperium pulled away from the
Rim, politically and technologically, (remember that in 1100, they have
all those TL16 worlds in the TL15 Imperium, which is understandable, but
should not be forgotten.

One thing on that note.  I think the MT departure (late-CT as well) from
a clear consistent Tech Level makes these waters muddier as well.  I think
I do have a solution.  Though they did not always obey this consistently,
I think you should use the highest of all areas of tech in the UPP
of the given world.  For example, they did do this for Sabmiqys.  They
say that the world was TL8 when it came to space travel, but TL17 when it
comes to their robotics tech.  Similarly, Terra was TL14 at the end of
the FIW (their jump tech noticebly less, at TL9, or perhaps they were
actually higher, but just did not have a clear understanding of that
little invention they came up with out there in the Belt).

I am trying to show that just relying upon CT alone is not always enough
to have a consistent understanding of the Traveller universe.  The fact
that it was published through several editions of the game only makes this
task more complex, and perhaps only possible by old Traveller codgers like
J.P. and myself. <G> (I won\'t take the chance of offending other old
codgers, I know how they can be. <G>)

Not really.  The Imperium has _always_ (M1100) had a diversified range of

See above, and...

Actually, as I said before, this discussion has helped me to see through
the prospects that MegaTraveller didn\'t do so much up-teching as it did
further clarification.  For example, after Chris\'s help in locating the
Vilani/No Meson factoid in the Contact: Sabmiqys (Challenge 28), I now
realize that this was pretty much a required "fact" of the Vilani, or the
Terrans would have been a Vilani province at the conclusion of the FIW.

Exactly, and you can still point to the fact that MT redid the whole
Solomani Sphere as a max. TL15, rather than the previous TL14.
Just add +1 to relevant CT sources that may have been written before
the "change."

Sorry Harold, you can interpret the I:E combat rules any way you want to,
but the plain English version [whose detractors I have told to write GDW
and ask them for a ruling on, though that no longer works :(   ] that I
have only mildly paraphrased above is the way it is.  No IFs ANDs or BUTs.
In I:E, the combat treats TL13+ _all_ _exactly_ the same.

No, the rest of this discussion, which you have accepted the basic
premise of (Terra was TL15 in at the start of the Rim War), is the evidence
and reasoning.  Unfortunately, this phase of the RoM TL discussion is about
consistency with the published universe, and not so much quotes from the
various background sources that was previously discussed, admittedly some
here have tried to make the case (to me unconvincingly) that there were
alternative interpretations.

My interpretations _do_ _not_ _require_ _a_ _reinterpretation_ _of_ _the_
_rules_ and to me, that _is_ _very_ _advantageous_.  I will say this--a
concern foremost in my mind are the ramifications of changes to the
Traveller universe.

    'body' => 'First of all, I recommend reading my article in JTAS #24, "Refereeing High
Guard and TCS campaigns".  That ish was the last of the small sized JTAS\'s.
(BTW, though they didn\'t credit Marc with it, as well, I think Marc and I
spent [my long distance] two phone calls of one hour each, verifying what
I had written, and answering questions about the rules, and I stated so in
the article.

In that article, I presented an alternative to the Book 5 design sequence,
albeit fully compatible with HG.  It is the percentage based checklist in
which I group all percentage based components (i.e. drives, armor, fuel,
bridge [for large enough vessels]) on one list, and tonnage based components
(weapons, screens, staterooms, refinery, etc.) on another.  The tonnage based
components form the "payload".

Familiarity with this approach helps one understand the intricacies of HG
design.  I won\'t do an actual design here--this is a simplified example to
make the point clearest.

Let\'s assume procurements wants the following performance:

  J-4   5%
  M-6  17%
  P-9   ?
  Fuel 49% (Jump and Powerplant fuel)

Payload of 15,000 tons, consisting of:

  Crew staterooms, refinery, cargo, weapons systems.

  Assume a Meson-S is to be deployed (allows for TL14 or TL15).

  This means that the powerplant, and the whole design, may be done at
  either TL.

      TL14 TL15
  P-4  18%   9%

Total  89%  80%

Now, there is no particular magic here--just algebra.

   Payload                          15,000
   ----  =  Total(required) =  ---- =  136,363 (TL14)
   11/100                            .11

   Payload                          15,000
   ----  =  Total(required) =  ---- =  75,000 (TL15)
   20/100                            .20


Now Bruce might be saying, but you said 3:1.  That is true.  There are
several reasons this example does not prove that contention.  I would
have to search long and hard for the design I did at the time, but it
was based upon basic Third Imperial design principles (the above does
not take into account for an Armored ship, and most TI were, and it
may very well be that this one is way underpowered to support the
proper contingent.

I assume that Steve Higginbotham did something like the above, as I
independently had, and reached the same conclusion.  (Do you remember
the constructs of every proof you have ever written?  No.  Just the
results are what is important.  Also remember, this is for the ships
of the line, and is _solely_ based upon the difference the powerplant
makes at TL14 vs. TL15.

Cost in High Guard is roughly directly proportional to size, and size is
largely inflated by the requirement for larger powerplants at TL14 as
compared to TL15.  Also, TL15 could boost the Meson Gun to factor-T,
where the TL14 can not.

Given the similarity the MegaTraveller system has to High Guard, this
analysis is advertised as a CT,MT analysis.

BTW, it has been at least 10 years since I did this, so it is possible
that I left something out.  Also, the example I did was a TL15 100Kton
ship, and the "equivalent" TL14 version came out very close, if not
exactly, at 300Kton, hence 3:1, all other things being equal.

Having worked in the publishing industry in my dark past, I thought I might
speak up on this issue.  The ASL cost is really not a valid argument point,
because there are a bunch of extra factors involved with that one (like you
need to also buy a whole second game to get maps and counters also needed
to play).

I was one of the people who suggested a binder format for T4.  Actually, I
suggested a binder format more for the design rules, but a binder
nonetheless.  At that time, the arguments on the TML against the binder
approach were:

1.  Expense
2.  Complexity
3.  Lack of Consumer Appeal

Issue 1 (Expense) is not really an issue at all.  In fact, the binder
approach is significantly less expensive than the hardcover approach, and
if handled properly can be less expensive than the softcover approach.  In
this case, "handled properly" means minimizing expenses by not having a
printed binder cover (using an insert into a commonly-available binder with
clear insert front and back), and not having the printer put the pages into
the binder for you (a MAJOR increase in cost; this raised the price of a
report I was involved in from $1.75 each to $3.80 each).  In this case, you
either have the contents shrink-wrapped and stuffed into an empty binder
(which is itself shrink-wrapped) OR you get the corporate staff and some
family members together for a binder-stuffing weekend.

Issue 2 (Complexity) is also not an issue.  This again relates to the
approach taken, the amount of pages in the binder, and the size of the
binder itself.  A huge binder is unweildy.  A small binder becomes a pain
when you are forced to "overstuff" it with too many pages.  Putting front
and back page-guides (those little plastic inserts) really helps a lot;
ESPECIALLY if you spend the extra $.0.25 to get the full-page sized page
guides.  One common problem in binders without page guides is that most
binders come with handly little pockets on the inside front and back
covers, which gamers invariably take advantage of.  However, when the book
is opened/closed, the front/back pages will get tangles with the contents
of the pockets, and cause a mess.  Small page guides will also do this
sometimes, but the LARGE page guides will NEVER have this problem.

Issue 3 (Lack of Consumer Appeal) is a VERY LEGITIMATE issue.  A little
history here.  There have been many games released in the binder format.
Most have been small-quantity printings, with very low quality artwork and
production values.  A few of teh industry biggies have also delved into
this; most notably Avalon Hill (Advanced Squad Leader) and TSR (Monstrous
Compendiums).  Both projects used printed binder covers.  The Avalon Hill
binder was actually very good quality, and came with a very nice slipcase
cover, which certainly inflated the cost considerably.  However, most of
the cost of the ASL rules binder is due to the very small print run and the
very high operating expenses Avalon Hill has to deal with.  Remember,
wargames have seriously lost market share, and for Avalon Hill to continue
making wargames for a more limited audience, it has to charge more money
for its product (more even than IG does for T4).  On the other side of the
coin, the TSR effort was very poor quality; the binder was very shoddy, and
the paper contents were so thin and poorly drilled (adding the holes for
the binder) that most copies fell apart after only a few uses.  My FLGS had
many returns on this product due to this problem, and eventually TSR moved
back into the normal hardcover format.

A more recent entrant into all of this is the new edition of Harnmaster
from Columbia Games.  They used the cheaper approach of using "generic"
binders with full-color inserts front and back.  The interior is made up of
very nice near-cardstock paper, which menas the book can be used without
the pages falling out.  If the owner adds a lot of pages to the book, he
can go to the local business supply store, buy a larger generic binder,
move the cover sheets to it, move his contents in, and presto - he has a
book of equal quality to the original.  This book was $30.00, but the
quality and production values of the contents seemed more typical of a
$50.00 product.

All this rambling does have a point - I am not sure a binder approach is
applicable to the basic rules for T4.1, mostly because of the lack of
consumer appeal.  However, there are other T4 things that really SCREAM for
this approach.  Specifically; equipment books (weapons, vehicles,
starships), Technical Architecture books (FF&S, other future add-ons) and
First Survey type books.  All of these share the same element of being
constantly added to, updated, revised or annotated (either by the owner or
by Imperium Games).  The basic rules are self-contained as a basic ruleset;
future expansions and additions are not the basic rules, but are
supplements or advanced rulesets.

Sorry for the length; this is of limited interest to most folks, but think
of how nice it would be to have a binder full of starships, and every issue
of JTAS you cut out or xerox one or two more full-page designs to add to
the book, or you get a few dozen with each new mileu book.  Or you get a
basic equipment guide for Mileu Zero (or for all mileus), and with each
future mileu book or Aliens module you get a few dozen insert pages of
designs valid for that mileu or race.  You only buy the binder once (or
maybe once for starships, once for vehicles, once for equipment, once for
survey data), and you spend a little bit of money with each realease to get
more goodies for your binders.

Well, I have four High Guards right now.  There is the First printing safely
stowed away, the Second printing with the not-missing, but not-attached,
cover that I use all the time (the one I shall quote from here), the Mint
copy, and the one I got that is for sale (and yes, I have already received
a request for one, that I have not had a chance to reply to, due to a
horrendously busy schedule the past few days).

In my coverless edition, it says (excerpted, and re-formated on purpose):

  Page 23        Page 26
                 Computers
    Tonnage          Model    Ship   TL
      D  4,000         3        D     9
      E  5,000
      F  6,000
      G  7,000
      H  8,000
      J  9,000
      K 10,000         4        K    10 (A)
      L 20,000
      M 30,000
      N 40,000
      P 50,000         5        P    11 (B)
      Q 75,000

The relevant textual quotes are:
  pg.28 "Computers...Ship size shows the hull tonnage code which requires
         this computer model as a minimum; for example, a 10,000 ton ship
         has hull code K, and requires at least a Model/4 computer be
         installed. Tech level shows the minimum tech level required to
         build the indicated computer."
  pg.22 "Each specific tonnage level includes all values between it and
         the next highest level stated. Thus, tonnage A includes all
         tonnage code A includes all tonnages from 1,000 to 1,999 tons.

Who made the small error? <G>  BTW, you may notice from one of my earlier
posts, before I read this one, that I am in the High Guard pantheon. <G>

Just for clarity, _the_ maximum size for a TL9 ship, Terran or not, is
4,999 tons.  With my own house rule, I drop that to 4,900 tons but that
either value still does not allow for Terrans to mount Spinal mounts.

Notice, also, all those Missile Boats in Imperium that are _soooooo_
effective using High Intensity fire against those Vilani BBs they get
later, or on appeal to the Emperor.

Andrew, I enjoyed the mythical Early Terran Battleship, but let\'s have
one that is legal.  I am sorry that I was behind, but as fate would have
it, the exact first digest I started reading today was the one with
this (your) note in it, and one of the last was your tech level 9 10KT
Terran battleship.  Hey, we could get a referee on the list and run a
line of battle. <G> (Just kidding, by the time we had any conclusion to
the battle, Marc will be talking M3000, and we\'ll all be cherishing those
out of print E21 sourcebooks. :)

I think what you are trying to say is that size D includes size E-J, which I
do not agree with.

The max ship size for TL11, Vilani or otherwise is 74,999 (my house rule is
74,900).

Given the assessment and the problem of interpreting the rules, you do make
a good point about the nature of the Imperium game.  However, the vastly
restrictive ship sizes that both sides have, there is little point in trying
to talk Capital ship, unless you accept it as an Ersha class, from my earlier
post.

Then, given that the FIW was not too decisive, since the Vilani just have to
keep coming back, they\'ll eventually capture all the Terran ships, repair
the maneuver drives, and the only thing left for the Terrans to do is build
more ships.  Hell, with Armor-11, the Vilani could start ramming the Terran
ships--it just depends on how fast they build, or have accumulated the
Ersha class.  They might be able to field 1:1 for Terran ships, and any
Armor-11 ship would do, it wouldn\'t have to be the flagship. <G>

I like your overall reasoning, I guess I am just having a difficult time
justifying it under HG rules.

I love it too.  I only brought it up since my proposals about the Early
Terran and RoM tech levels brought about cat calls about T4 not being
compatible with CT.  In this case, if they are going to force bad cannon down
our throats, then we should point out just exactly what CT says about this
pet theory that the Terrans were TL9.  I am surprised that nobody is flaming
you for trying to mess with High Guard, properly one of the CT bibles. <G>

Also, to show that your interpretation of the HG Computer rules is not lost
on me, I am going to adopt them as part of my own House rules since I still
use HG.  To tell you the truth, I think HG had as it\'s focus, design of
ships in the TL12-TL15 range, another telling fact of the RoM/Terra TL
discussion--Interstellar states must be TL12 to handle what goes with the
turf.

:)

Since J.P. is one of my players, and the flame of FF&S2 started,
I stopped giving him digests on floppy.  But that didn\'t stop him from
pointing out that QSDS, SSDS, and FF&S2 all need spreadsheets, and to be
done "right", should all be done together.  I have a feeling, if I break
it to my players that we\'re leaving HG behind, I\'m gonna be in trouble. :(

I guess that could be good or bad.

When you define beginner as 

A. unskilled (can\'t attempt the task anyway), or
B. default skill level -0, with characteristic halved,

then a beginner has a considerably lower chance than a competent profesisonal

Because the skill level meanings were written for CT basic, not advanced or

That\'s why I tend toward competency testing.

And that\'s why advenced character generation for T4 will be more concerned

giving the character more skills.

This is precisely right (and what the furor over national school testing is
about). Regardless of skill level, competency is what I would want in the
crew of the starship carrying ME.

So the standard for getting hired as a crewpersonis whether he or she can do
the job.

Competency Testing
	A candidate for a position must demonstrate that he or she can succeed at
various tasks associated with the position. average tasks at the 90 th
percentile. To accomplish this, the sum of skill level and one of the
associated characteristics must equal 10 or more.

Pilot	Pilot	(Int, Edu)	10	(or whatever)

Add Skill (S) and characteristic (C) to read the percentage chance for
success for each difficulty level. For example Skill-5 and Characteristic-4
produces S+C of 9. Read the probability of success at Formidable Difficulty
as 38%.

A task with a default skill would use 0.5C instead of S+C.

I hope you make it a little harder to fiddle with than that!  If I just let
it be a dial by the door, then somebody would reach in and give it quick
twist one way then the other.  Ha! Ha! Good joke, huh? ;->

I have the cabin\'s controls require them to key in a password input (with
Command Crew having Master Overrides) before you can adjust anything other
than light. The password  is used to lock and unlock the door as well. It
is set to the cabin number originally, and the passenger can change it to
anything they would like.

That\'s still a sticking point, but I can forsee that it might be possible
that properly stored, the Vacc Suits might still be usuable after two milennia.

I\'m just at that point in TACS, and right now I\'m leaning towards having
work like this:

1-25kg    1D6
26-50kg   2D6
51-100kg  3D6
101-200kg 4D6
etc..

This puts the majority of humans in the 3D6 range.

As for what is affected by blowthrough; bullets, lasers, and fragments are
subject to the blowthrough rule, while explosions and plasma/fusion weapons
are not.

Comments?  I know I said I\'d have TACs out by tonight, but I want to make
sure I\'ve covered everything.

	Well, actually, while it\'s pretty nice beer it\'s not quite worth
switching platforms over.  It\'s not the world\'s greatest stout (it\'s a wee
bit pale for that), but it does pack one hell of a punch.  It\'s alcohol
content is 9%, almost double normal Canadian beer, which is generally more
powerful than U.S. beer IIRC.  And it goes down pretty smoothly.  So
basically, you\'re getting twice as drunk off the same number of beers.  I\'m
6\'2", 230 lbs or so, and two Trois-Pistoles got me surprisingly bagged the
other night.  They kind of sneak up on you; it\'s a speed thing more than
anything else, I think :).

	Another Unibroue beer that you (or Rob) might get a kick out of is
called "Maudite", Tr: "the damned one".  The label has a picture (in reds
and oranges) of a bunch of lumberjacks in a canoe flying over Montreal
circa 1820 or so, and a great big glowering batwinged devil (who looks a
lot like one of my brothers in law) with his arms crossed at the bottom.
It\'s only about 7-8%, but is eminently drinkable and an interesting deep
red colour; I think it\'s a wheat beer.  And it has a real plus in that the
packaging would make the pope\'s (or Billy Graham\'s) head explode :).

What are you doing talking about KB2?  You aren\'t going to use

you just playing "dog in the manger?" ;->

Ok, what constitutes a fix of "the problem of characteristics having too
much influence over skills", IYO?

As I\'ve said before Task Resolution and CharGen are tied together.  You
can\'t change one without affecting the other, and you can\'t "fix" one
without having to "fix" the other.

Looking at Marc\'s draft of CharGen, I just don\'t see that much difference
(if effect) from T4.  The scale of characteristics is still 2 to 15, and an
INT or DEX of 10+ is still going to have the same effect on Average and
Difficult task it had in T4.  There are actually fewer Background/Homeworld
skills.  All the tasks of careers (enroll, promotion, injury, etc) are
still like they were in T4..the numbers changed but the technique is still
not based on the Task System.  The number of skills per term hasn\'t been
changed from T4, it\'s still 1/year plus 1 for Commission and 1 for
Promotions.  There are a couple more Career skills, but that\'s about it. 
The escalating EDU problem has been toned down, but you will still have a
lot of PC\'s with an EDU of 9+. From the character\'s I\'ve generated the
range of skills is still pretty much the same as T4, too.  Have you
actually created any characters using Marc\'s draft of CharGen?

Given that the characters coming out of CharGen are going to be very much
like those coming out of T4, as I see it, any perceived problem of Stat vs
Skill that existed in T4 will still be perceived to exist in T4.1.

I don\'t define a beginner as someone at unskilled or even default level.
That person would be, in the former case "no skill", and in the later case
"unskilled."  I define a beginner as some one who has just begun to be
trained in a skill, a first year student if you will, ie skill 1.

I\'m of mixed mind on lasers.  In 3G3, Greg Porter, discribes the effect of
a laser on flesh more like a steam explosion than a puncture like a high
velocity bullet.  It *might* be that lasers deposit more of their energy in
watery flesh than they would burning/punching through metal.  

Heavy low velocity projectiles probably shouldn\'t "blowthrough" either.
They may not have the energy to punch all the way through, but because of
their size do massive damage inside a body.

I\'m no expert, though, just something to think about.

	They were probably done using Greg\'s system, since FF&S2 only got
written after EA was released.  Apparently 3G3 (Greg\'s system) was superior
to FF&S1 in many respects, and from what I can tell, so is FF&S2, so
quality/consistency ought not tobe that big of a problem.

This is called a check ride.  Pilots have one about one per year.  Other
no-notice checks also come up randomly.  The real basis of "competency"
is really from peer approval, even though check rides are a requisite to
move on and up. 

Depending on the period and place they may be broad and objective or
VERY piddly ass detailed, with a bust for a minor, stupid detail that
has little to do with flying skill.  However, the testing idea is
valid-pilots are constantly being evaluated in one way or another.  Sort
of like every day of your life is a test.

BTW, your airlines use a seniority system based on hiring year.  You
advance soley on your time in the airline.  Period.  Of course the
average flight time is 5000+ hours for new hires, (or 2500 hrs previous
military.) Most of the ner do wells are long gone. And there are still
check rides.

I remember when MT came out.  My group, with more than it\'s fair share of

   Well let\'s see, _101 Vehicles_ (MT) has the following to say:

   "The Trepida class became the standard issue Imperial grav tank (at
least at the high end of the technology level scale) in 1109, and is
widely distributed throughout the Imperium."

   The Trepida of course being the TL 14 main battle tank of Imperial
forces.

   "The Astrin class grav armored personnel carrier was developed as a
companion to the Trepida grav tank to carry troops into battle.  Its
deployment has followed the Trepida by about three years."

   The Astrin is the TL 14 grav APC of Imperial forces.

   We also know from various older sources that the FGMP-14 was the
primary infantry weapon of battledress troops (the FGMP-15 serving as a
support weapon).

   THe FGMP-14 is the 56th century equivalent of the American M-16A1
rifle.  

   Now, if the standard main battle tank, APC, and standard infantry
"rifle" are *all* TL 14, what would that mean for the force as a whole?

   Look, it makes more sense to equip Imperial troops at TL 14 in 1116
(not to mention 1000) rather than TL 15.  For one, there are a lot more
TL 14 worlds (thus more worlds you can get supplies from) than TL 15 in
the Imperium.  For another, because there are fewer TL 15 worlds, if you
insist on going with TL 15 hardware your logistics lines are going to
have to be longer if you are going to run anything resembling a
prolonged campaign (say invading a rebellious province).

   As for the I:E era, what few TL 15 worlds there might be in the
Imperium couldn\'t hope to begin to supply the entire Imperial Army or
even Marines.  As for the Solomani, with one TL 15 world (Terra, and
that\'s a gift I\'m handing you), you are even in a worse position.  More
than likely, the Solomani are still fielding large amounts of TL 13
equipment (evidenced by _101 Vehicles_ though I admit it is not as
complete a source as I would like).

   Leroy, the reason for the change in TL of *some* (not all, see the
TNS items for worlds in the Solomani Rim during the Rebellion era)
worlds is the natural progression of those Solomani worlds from TL 14 to
15 which had occured between 1107 and 1117.  It is entirely possible
that those Solomani worlds that did go up in TL did so because of the
rape of captured TL 15 Imperial worlds (ones that resisted the Solomani
Party), where industrial manufacturing equipment etc. was carted off by
transports to "loyal" worlds back in the Confederation.

   For historical parallels, if I\'m not mistaken, our European friends
can testify to what the Soviets did to Occupied Germany.

   I believe that *some time ago* I thought it would perfect sense if
certain Ancients sites (or at least people in 1116 know that they are
Ancients sites) were mistakenly attributed back in Year 0 to the RoM.

   I further said that it would make perfect sense that there would be
*rumors* of TL 13+ RoM equipment which turned out to actually be TL 12
or to be Ancients artifacts mistakenly attributed to the RoM.

   I also said that if these ideas were put into play in MMT, that the
Referee\'s Notes should indicate the true origins/TL of the sites/items.

   When I said these things, they were basically ignored, even though it
would have solved a lot of the RoM TL debate.  It\'s somewhat comforting
to see now that people like Leroy and Dan are finally coming around....

Simple.  T4.1 has to survive this test:

Edu-7, Medical-4 character has a better chance of success than a Edu-11,
Medical-1 character.

When that happens, I\'ll consider the problem fixed.

I guess you are joking, right?  I said I\'ll use Marc\'s system if it
fixes the problems of Char vs Skill.

I\'ll compare what Marc has done to my system.  If what he comes up with
is better than what I\'ve produced, I\'ll use that.  If it is not as good
as KBv2.0, then I\'m sticking with my system because it fixes the
problems I want to fix, it is extensively playtested, and it works.

I only have one (2nd edition). To save wear and tear; I photocopied it,
the four JTAS articles (including yours BTW), and parts of TCS. Then bound
them altogether. I\'ve been using that since 1989; when it finally wears out,
I\'ll probably copy them again.

I still hold to the max size for a TL 9 ship being 9,999T. However never
being one to forgo a challange :*)

It would be interesting to play out a TCS campaign based on the FIW though,
wouldn\'t it :*).

The term "Capital Ship" is entirely relative. If all you can build is 9,999T
ships (or 4,999T) then a 9,900T (or 4,900T) ship is a "Capital ship". In my
own campaigns, I use the term "Ship of the Line" for what most people call
Battleships and a lot of Cruisers. No prizes for guessing where I got that
idea :*).

All the Terrans can do in the FIW is survive. I put their survival down to the
fact that even the Vilani provinical governor did not view them as much of a
threat during the war, coupled with unexpected Terran ships and tactics.

I still use HG as well. I like it, it might be a bit "crude", but I\'m willing to
accept that. It works well enough to allow me to concentrate on roleplaying and
I can fudge around the simplifications. I suspect that I\'m not the only referee
who started with CT and has kept HG as their design system.

Erm. Wrong methinks.

Supplement 10 describes the *Arcturus* Subsector (home to the Cymbeline
system). This does have 4 TL15 worlds, but *all* the worlds in the
subsector are in the *Third Imperium*, not the Solomani Confederation. The
thick black line at the bottom is the border <g>. Not sure how they mark

The S10 copy I have has no worlds >TL14.

I think most of us would be happy with just the first two. Not meant as a

just an observation as to why some of us get a bit upset.

This is also a problem I have w/ respect to Skill Cascades. IIRC, using
gun combat for an example, if you get Shotgun-4 (Jed Clampett) you have
the equivalent of Pistol-3, Rifle-3, and SMG-3. Then, if you get SMG
skill as a pick, it suddenly drops you to SMG-1. The same effect exists
for all the other Cascades as well. Where then is the incentive to ever
choose a level of skill in any of the other branches of the Cascade? This
is something I\'d like to see fixed in T4.1 .

Got to check that one out. Your discussion makes me think about something 
I heard on the radio the other day about how McD\'s is having to cut the price
of the "Arch" line of sandwiches to try and boost sales. Made me wonder who
the advertising *genius* was who came up with the entire Arch campaign:

"Let\'s see, we need a hook here... How about a hamburger that tastes so
\'icky\' that kids won\'t eat it? Yeah, that ought to sell billions!"

I think McD\'s has definitely knocked Burger King\'s "Herb" promotion out
of 1st place for stupidity with this one :)

I\'m using CG because it\'s what CSC has, and I don\'t have FFS2 yet :) I\'m
thinking maybe a variety of CG projectors arranged in a globe like shape
that produces a CG "field" rather than a flat bed area projecting up. It is
my impression that CG doesn\'t actually push against gravity but just 
neutralizes it, while ignoring the inertia effects that would cause such a
craft (or bed occupant) to be hurled off the planet.

My biggest complaint with *ANY* binder.  I should really buy stock in those 
little round reinforcement thingies.

I have to agree completely with Steve here.  I would have loved to have seen 
Starships, Aliens 1, and FFS2 in this \'binder\' format (not sure about 
Milieu:0).  However, Steve\'s on target about the main rulebook as well.  I want 
a hardback, and I\'m willing to pay for it.  I think that people "buy into" 
certain RPGs, and different crowds are attracted by hardcover/price point. 
 Owning the hardcover editions of certain RPGs was always more of a status 
symbol as well.  I wish that more companies would at make small runs of 
hardcovers (I never play MERP, but I bought the anniversary hardcover, same 
with Vampire et al, good \'idear\' books, bad genre).  </ramble>

The only reason I would excuse a basic ruleset for being in a binder was a 
tremendous amount of errata.  :-(  Or frequent editions/revisions.  I sure wish 
the old Rolemaster was in binder format.  ;-)  The new ones are drilled, but to 
damn big to fit in a normal binder.

Since we will never see "the little black books" again, I vote for everything 
in hardcover.

The first thing I did with FFS2 was take it down to Kinko\'s and have the
binding cut off.  Then I put everything into page protectors and shoved the
whole shebang into a binder.

With a book that that, the binder format makes a great deal of sense, since
it needs to lie flat and put up with a great deal of page flipping.  It
also helps protect the pages from coke spills, and I can take the tables I
need out of the back and have them for easy reference.

I\'ve always held that the ship\'s internal field is slowly adjusted to the
gravity at the destination world over the course of the trip.  This allows
the passengers and crew to acclimate to the new conditions before arrival.

On the other hand, McD\'s has a wildly sucessful ad campaign here in the SF
Bay area for the "McDouble" burger.  A character named Eddie the Echo who
says everything twice, until he eats the burger.  Simple, cheap, and funny
as hell..

what this has to do with Traveller escapes me completely.

I have two subsectors mapped out (I am playing in the standard CT world,
Imperium c. 1100), and in these two subsectors I have two VERY long
mains (jump one trade routes).  One wraps around one subsector and
through the other and back into the first, and the other goes more or less
straight across both subsectors width-wise.

Now, when I connected the two subsectors together and saw the two
huge mains, visions of Free Trader unions danced in my head,
massive subsector wide lines as well.  I loved it.  One problem is,
though, that on one of the mains, there is a very low tech world lacking
both starport and gas giant.  ie.  dead end.

In trying to figure out a way around this, I thought about a calibration
point much like the ones from the TNE Regency sourcebook.  When
I looked for a location, this seemed too perfect because the logical
place for the calibration point would connect both of the mains,
thus roughly doubling the amount of worlds that can be reached by
a J-1 trader...

My dilemna is:  Is there a source for rough prices of starports?  I
think I saw some discussion a little while back.  In addition, the
other dilemna is, since I am using FF&S2 manuever drives, would
they work?  The Comet or Iceteroid wouldn\'t be huge like a star or
anything.  I hope that manuever drives DON\'T work here, because 
I\'ve just gotten visions of HEPlaR tug boats pulling ships out to 100 
diameters of the comet.

Why would you want to do that--just for game mechanics?  Why would 
you want to deny a character the benefit of a high stat because his 
skill is low?

My thinking is high natural ability should help the chances of a 
novice--not have his natural ability stunted due to his incompetence.

They were definitely designed using Greg\'s 3G3 system, and by the way he

That\'s what I\'ll use then.  It does require that you know how much your

In the intersts of keeping things as simple as possible, I\'m keeping the
common forms of damage subject to the blowthrough rule.  I may go back and
do advanced rules later covering the various odd and strange things you cna

Like TL3-4 balls?  In most cases like that, the sheer size of the round
prevents the damage from getting too high without making the weapon a
massive support gun, and then the damage will blow through from velocity.

I\'m designing this for non-experts to use, so your input is appreciated.

I don\'t think anybody thinks characteristics *shouldn\'t* be involved, 
it\'s just that most seem to think the full value is too much.

How about the value of the controlling stat, so an average PC has a max skill

Actually, I consider that to be possibly the most elegant way of dealing with 
wounds that I\'ve seen. It combines the simplicity of \'hit points\' with the realism 
of having injuries significantly affecting the character.

Yes, I agree, your method is easier. However, I don\'t consider dividing a small 
integer by 2 to be a particularly difficult mathematical challenge (and if you\'re 
using a D6/2 as a D3, then T4 forces you to do it anyway). 

I\'m sure KBv2.0 is a much more accurate and flexible system (well, you keep 
telling us it is :-), but it just doesn\'t \'feel\' right to me.

	So an easy task is hard for unskilled.
	A beginner (skill of 1-2) should only attempt easy and average tasks.
	A professionell (skill 3-4) dosnt worry about routine task.
	Experts (5-6) will only have fun with the hard stuff.

	BTW: We should better close task resoluton debate. Perhaps T4.1

As I have come to understand, lasers *should not* be included with
such a rule.  I originally thought that a laser beam would burn a hole
through the target and continue out the other side (ie: a 5d damaging
beam would drop 3d max into the target and send 2d out the back and
down range).  From what I have learned on this list as to how lasers
interact with fleshy (ie: mostly water) targets is that the vapourized
tissue obscures the beam, absorbing the rest of the beam\'s energy.
Lasers also react explosively when they strike flesh as the beam super
heats the water, explosively turning it into steam.

No, the best candidates for the 3d max rule are traditional slug
throwers that do not rely on a warhead or "payload" to do its damage.
Some exceptions like weaponry with either slow (less than 100 m/s) or
hyper (4,000 m/s or more) might be included, but these would be rare
enough that such an exemptions to the 3d max rule could be included
with the weapon description and not in the combat rules themselves.
Or not... whatever :)

PCMPs are, in reality, high-tech slug throwers (plasma instead of
solid lead or steel).  Since their damage is inflicted upon the target
using multiple methods (impact, contact burns, and radiation/proximity
burns), putting a 3d max limit on the damage delivered via kinetic
energy is fine with me (all though some others on the list think that
that\'s too complicated).

And to answer Ken\'s question as to why 3d and not 4d... my guess it
has something to do with the fact that characters have three stats
that "absorb" damage and not four.  Although it isn\'t specifically
stated in the rules, the example regarding damage dice allocation
leads one to believe that the first die is randomly distributed
between three stats, with the second die being distributed between the
_two_ remaining stats, and the last die affecting the final stat (ass
opposed to the idea of distributing each die among three stats, even
if this means that it is possible for all three dice to affect the
same stat).  With a 3d max rule, all stats are reduced to some degree
while allowing the target the chance to stay conscious (something that
an additional die might not allow).

It\'s "dog in the manger", not manager. ;->  A manger is a hay or feed
trough. The expression "dog in the manger", as I understand it, comes from
the dog that would be hidden under the hay and jump out when the cattle
began to feed. This unsettled the cattle and generally caused trouble for
the farmer. So, it means to go along with a program, or idea, while
maintaining hidden objections or reservations. Then jumping up after the
decision is made, unsettling the organization and going off on your own. 
It also can be taken to mean, having a hidden agenda.  I asked if you were
playing that game..notice the smiley...to give you a chuckle, because I
*know* you would never do something like that.
  
Yes, I know you can always "just use KB2.0", but we aren\'t talking about
individual fixes we can all apply, we\'re talking about trying to convince
Marc to fix the rules that go into T4.1. If you *really* don\'t think
Characteristics that range from 2 to 12, while Skills range from 0 to 6,
with an Asset made up of flat Characteristic+Skill will work you should to
say so, and work with us toward a real solution. If your solution is simply
Marc adopting KB2, then say that, too.

On a different subject, I don\'t know why Marc posted the objections on the
list if he wasn\'t still open to making changes.  If it was just so he could
attempt to counter objections, and the matter is actually settled, then he
should have said that in the original post...it would have saved a lot of
bandwidth. ;->  OTOH, if he *is* open to making changes, then perhaps he
should be clearer about that too.  I\'m preceiving mixed signals in his
posts, and I don\'t know whether to just stop trying to convince him that
changes are needed or continue.

LOL, that\'s what I thought you\'d say.  Ken I\'m afraid you are SOL. Marc, is
as unlikely to agree to multiplying skill levels by two as he is to
dropping the 1/2 at the difficult level.

You know, I think part of the problem is a misunderstanding of "learning
rates", and how Stats are applied in the game.  Some people seem to have to
idea that 1 year spent learning a skill results in the same gain for
everybody, and testing does not bare that out.  The current rules don\'t
bare that out either.  If the Stat is the character\'s natural aptitude for
a skill (which I don\'t really accept, but it seems most people do) then the
naturally talented (Stat-11) person *should* get more learning benefit out
of his first year (Skill-1) than a person of average talent (Stat-7).  The
current rules reflect this.  He should get more learning benefit from his
second through n\'th year than the average stat person, too, up to a point
they cover this as well, but they break down much too fast, For example....

...using 3d6 tasks under current/proposed rules...

                           Skill Level
             0          1         2         3          4
   =======================================================          
 Stat 7   0.5% (3)   26% (8)   38% (9)   50% (10)   63% (11)
   % increase     25%       12%       12%        13%
 
 Stat 11   5% (5)    74% (12)  84% (13)  91% (14)   95% (15)
   % increase    69%        10%        7%        4%
 
Notice the big increase from 0 to 1, this is the built in bonus for first
acquiring the skill.  It is significantly higher for high Stat people (as
it should be IF the Stat is a learning modifier).  However, also notice
that because of the nature of bell curves the *rate* of increase from 1 to
4 is not only lower for a high Stat person, but increasingly so.  This is
because the average Stat person is still riding up the curve out to level
4, while the high Stat person is over the top as of level 1. 

While it is true that the benefit of training should have diminishing
returns, I don\'t this models either reality or (more importantly for the
game) our perception of reality.  Personally, I think that for any task
more difficult than Average *everybody* should have a learning curve (not
just a downward slope) where the first 2 or 3 levels bring increasing
benefits, before cresting and beginning to receive diminishing returns.

I\'ve contended all along that we need to break natural talent (the Stat)
away from the aptitude for *learning* a specific skill (a multiplier for
improving that skill).  The Stat should form a base that contributes a
minimum level that the person starts from, and the *learned* skill should
contribute the rest.  Skills that the PC has a low aptitude for should
increase by a smaller amount (let\'s say 1 point per level) than skills for
which he has a high aptitude (let\'s say 2 points per level). Yes, you could
do this with the Characteristic, but it would be cleaner and more natural
to do it with either another set of Stats that represent the character\'s
sense/feel/learning rate for different skills. I\'ve suggested this before,
and I\'ll present it again just to make sure everyone is aware of it, but I
not going to try to sell it.  It does add a little more rolling, and
arithmetic, to the game, so either you thing the advantages are worth it or
you don\'t.

I\'m in the camp that says the learned skill should represent about as much
as the base stat IN A COMPETENT person.  I define a competent person as one
that will succeed at Routine tasks *virtually* 100% of the time.  (The
virtually is for Rob. ;-> Like him I do think everybody should have a
chance to flub-up and occasionally fail, but that\'s part of what
Exceptional Failure is all about.)  Using 2d6 as Routine, that means I
define Competency as an Asset (StatComponent + SkillComponent) of 12.  If
we agree that each part should be about half, then the average Stat should
contribute about 6 and the Professional level of skill should contribute
about 6.  

Notice, I didn\'t say Stat 6 and Skill 6, just that they should contribute
about that much.  I can really see only two ways of getting to 6 for
Professional Skill Levels, you either have the same scale 0-6 and multiply
by something (simplisticly 2), or you give out more skill levels (2/year
rather than 1.25/year seems to work pretty well).  Either way there are
still problems at the top and bottom end of the scales.

Given that we may have Stat 12+ in the game then we are saying that these
naturally talented people are Competent with 1 level of training. We are
also saying, given that Skill increases are a fixed amount (whether 1 *or*
2), so that a Stat 12 + Skill 1 person will have as good or better chance
of success at *any* level of difficulty than a Stat 7 + Skill 3 person.  We
are also saying that a Stat 12 person recieves *less* benefit from
increases in learning a related skill (after the first level) than the Stat
7 person out through Formidable Task difficulties (given Marc\'s scale).

Therefore, we are saying that an Average Professional is no better (or
worse) at Formidable tasks than a Highly Talented 1st year student. Some
people agree with that statement, so for them T4.1 *is* fixed. Your KB2
papers over the worst of the systems offenses (but not all, see above), and
for some people that\'s all they want.  Neither solution satisfies me.

the typographical errors, and once you get used to it, having all the tables
and equations in one place actually works.  However, there are some aspects
that are unclear that I need some help on.

*** 1.)  Table 212: Food Storage.  Does the volume include the amount of
food, or is it in addition to the amount of food?  For example:  If I have
2m3 of food at TL8, do I need an extra 2.4m3 for storage, or do I need 2.4m3
total for storage in which the food is fitted?  (2m3 for the food, plus 0.4m3
extra for the refrigiration, shelves, etc.).

*** 2.)  What is the volume of an individual workstation or crewstation?
 That is:  Is it the volume & mass of a seat + the mass of the workstation
from the table in the book, or what?  I know that there is errata for the
control system, but I mean JUST the volume for the workstations and
crewstations (how can I figure out how big a bridge I need if I don\'t have
the volume of the crew/workstations?).

*** 3.)  What constitutes an electronic system when figuring out how many
electronics crew members are needed?  Is it EACH component (i.e:  3xComputer,
Controls, Nav-Aids, Flight Avionics, NOE Avionics, 500,000 km Radio, 1000 AU
Laser Communicator, P13 Sensors, and A11 Sensors for a total of 12) or is it
some
other way (groups of components)?  If so, what are the groups of components?

Any help would be GREATLY appreciated, thanks.

Richard,

I posted the "Scrounging" description to get a more encompassing tasks
for the skill. I agree with you as to the general role of scrounging but
a skill should have specific task rolls. If you can think of such please
advise me. Thanks!

Hmmm according to my copy of V&V the vargr males mass 60kg and the females
55kg, so by the chart above they sould be 3D6.

	Spinal mounts are not limited to > 5000dt, if you are using

	in close combats.

	Ok they are Tl13, but just an other design for a tl9/4999er.

	This ship could mount 120 meter spinal mount weapons. Using
	a 400 Mj PA with a bore of 5.7m, will produce 10:100-80-40-20,
	( or 10:3-3-2-1 BR, 4-4-3-2 T4 ) for only 230 displacement tons.
	4 of them plus a large fighter bay, and some missile bays will
	show a capable warship.

> The max ship size for TL11, Vilani or otherwise is 74,999 (my house rule is
> 74,900).

	Its usual to call ship classes *999er because of burocratical
	contrains. German Captains Licence include distinct limits
	for coast, Atlantic and Pacific. These terms are stated e.g.
	" less than 5000 tons Pacific " so we have the class of 4999ers.

Why a dead end? Develop it. One or more of your trade organizations has
people on planet trying to obtain rights to develop a port there. Develop
the port without the locals input; select an isolated area near a body of
water and have a trade organization, a consortium of organizations, or even
a aggressive individual initiate a port & refueling operation. 

Does your view of the Imperium have an organization that \'protects\'
undeveloped worlds? If not, then the economic engine will drive over the low
tech world with what ever is needed to provide a low cost path over which
trade will flow. 

If you are still at the design stage of your universe; simply add the Gas
Giant. If you rolled the subsectors randomly, you have the right to adjust
the rolls to fit your planned story line or lines, add the gas giant where
you want. 

You, as Referee, are god, not the dice.

And a controlling stat of 2 causes all skills that use it to max out at 2?
I\'ve got a problem with that. ;-> If we can boost the low end a little it
might work, though.

What we need to to narrow the range of STATS from 2 to 12(15). I like
something like 4 to 10, with 10 being the *absolute* max for humans. Skills
could be maxed out at the Stat now and the worst maxed out skill would be 8
(72% Aver, 26% Diff, 5% Form, 1% Stag, 0% Imp). I could accept that as the
best a Terrrible character could do. 

Awarding 4 Background and 8 skills per term (rather than 4+1) probably
would be enough to boost skills up to approximately the same level as
Stats.  Six term characters getting 8 per term would have 52 levels divided
among skills and the purely average character would have 42 points divided
among Stats, but the 52 points would be spread across 10 to 15 skills. 

I randomly rolled up some characters(random table/random choice) using
8skills/term, maxed at a controlling number (I used 4 to 8, but 4 to 10
should work OK) and I ended up with pretty good characters. They all had
above 20 skills, many 1 and 2\'s, fewer 3-4, a few 5-6, and only
occasionally 7\'s and 8\'s.  I\'m going to do some more using pick table/roll
tonight, and see how it looks.

BTW, I\'ve been using 6 new *aptitude* Stats: Aggressiveness-controls all
combat/physical skills, Esthetics-controls all art/language skills,
Scholarship-controls all skills gained through classroom-type study,
Charisma-controls interpersonal/social skills, Natural Sense(green
thumb)-controls survival/outdoorsy/bio-based skills, and Tech
Sense-controls all technological/scientific skills because I didn\'t want to
use the Characteristics that already contribute the base of the Target
Number. If you don\'t want to use my 6 aptitudes, you could just use the
Characteristics though.  

For testing purposes tonight, I\'ll use the Characteristics only.
