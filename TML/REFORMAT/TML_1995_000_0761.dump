 Fire, Fusion, & Steel Errata 7 December 1994
 
 This document compiles all changes, corrections, and
 clarifications to the 2nd printing of Fire, Fusion, & Steel
 (a.k.a. "Mk I, Mod 1"). Note that this includes the high-energy
 weapon upgrade presented as "Putting the Heat Back into Plasma"
 in Challenge #76. This also includes those portions of the
 Striker II design sequence upgrades that function as
 clarifications, but does not include the design sequence
 expansions from the Reformation Coalition Equipment Guide and
 Striker II.
 
 Owners of 1st printing FF&S (distinguished by the absence of
 "Mk I, Mod 1" on the credits page, and missing text on page 75)
 will first want to consult the "Fire, Fusion, & Steel First
 Printing to Second Printing Upgrade," available in Challenge #75.
 
 Modifications are laid out by page number in 2nd printing FF&S
 (Mk I, Mod 1), with a characterization of the type of change
 (Correction, Clarification, etc.). Changed material is set off
 _like this_ to make it easy to spot, and references to existing
 or previous material is often included within quotation marks
 "like this" to make it easier to spot the material that needs to
 be modified or replaced.
 
 Page 12
 
 (Correction): On the Hull Form and Configuration table, the LM
 for Open Frame should be 4, not "3.5."
 
 (Correction): On the notes beneath that same table, the second
 paragraph of MVM should read:
 
 "Perform the same calculation, _then divide by hull material
 toughness_ to get the volume of that hull\'s internal structure
 stressed to 1G."
 
 Page 15
 
 (Expansion): Change section "4. Place Surface Fixtures" as
 follows:
 
 "Surface fixtures include all antennae, radiators, external
 grapples, and hatches. Surface area devoted to slower-than-light
 maneuver drive (aft), jump drive (aft), _fuel scoops (anywhere),_
 and lifters (ventral surfaces) should also be allocated. These
 systems do not have surface hit locations listed on the ship\'s
 damage table (these have their damage handled by internal damage
 in the same hit locations), but are allocated in this step to
 ensure that other systems are not improperly placed where these
 engineering systems should be. Divide the total hull surface area
 by 20 to determine the surface area of each hit location and
 allocate surface fixtures accordingly.
 
 _When allocating antenna surface area, use the full unfolded
 surface area for folding EMS antennae. If the available surface
 area is too small for this, allocate surface area for all non-
 antenna surface area consuming systems, and then allocate all
 remaining surface area to "Antenna." However, this remaining area
 must be at least equal to 10% of the unfolded surface area of the
 folding antenna, plus the surface area required by the other
 antennae installed aboard the craft. If this requirement cannot
 be met, the systems cannot be accommodated aboard the vessel."_
 
 (Clarification): Change the sentence in section "5. Evaluate
 System Damage" as follows:
 
 "Systems can take 1 minor hit per 5 metric tonnes of mass
 _(round to the nearest whole number of minor hits,_ to a maximum
 of 4)@"
 
 Page 17
 
 (Correction): On the armor volume increase per thickened face
 table at the bottom of the right column, the entry for Sides
 (both) should be _30%_, not "15%."
 
 Pages 17 and 23
 
 (Clarification): In some cases, designating a turret as a small
 turret (and therefore requiring its components to take up 10
 times their volume) results in the turret being larger than the
 maximum 10% of vehicle volume allowed for a small turret.
 However, when recalculating the turret\'s volume as a main turret
 (requiring its components to take up between 2 and 6 times their
 volume, depending on tech level), the turret then falls back
 below the 10% threshold and becomes classified as a small turret
 again. In such cases, treat the turret as a main turret (using
 the main turret volume multiplier), but this turret must be the
 only turret on that vehicle, and the vehicle is then classified
 as having a small turret for purposes of target type in the
 vehicle damage sequence.
 
 Page 18
 
 (Clarification): In the second paragraph, modify the last two
 sentences as follows:
 
 "A moderate slope _multiplies_ the effective armor value of a
 face by _1.5._ A radical slope _multiplies_ the effective armor
 value of a face by 2."
 
 (Correction): In the notes beneath the Suspension table, the
 note headed "Kl" should instead be headed _Vol._
 
 Pages 18 and 24
 
 (Clarification): Large direct energy input lasers with
 trainable focal arrays may be designed for turret mounting in
 ground vehicles. When fitting these weapons to the vehicles, the
 laser\'s homopolar generator need not be placed in the turret, nor
 have its mass accounted for in the weapon stabilization
 calculations.
 
 Page 19
 
 (Correction): In the last sentence of the first paragraph, the
 reference should be to Step _9,_ Crew, not "Step 8."
 
 Page 20
 
 (Correction): The Cargo section should be labelled Step _10_,
 not "Step 11."
 
 Page 23
 
 See "Pages 17 and 23," above.
 
 Page 24
 
 See "Pages 18 and 24," above.
 
 Page 26
 
 (Enhancement): Before calculating the G rating of a lift
 vehicle, first determine its density by dividing its loaded mass
 by its volume in displacement tons. If the result is less than
 15.5, use the procedure as printed (i.e., divide thrust in tonnes
 by 10xhull displacement). If the result is 15.5 or greater,
 determine G rating by dividing the vehicle\'s thrust in tonnes by
 its loaded mass in tonnes.
 
 (Correction): The "Combat Move" section in the right hand
 column should be modified to read as follows:
 
 "Combat Move: The safe NOE combat movement of a grav vehicle
 (in 10-meter grid squares per combat turn) is equal to the
 vehicle\'s _safe_ NOE speed (in kilometers per hour) multiplied by
 0.139@"
 
 Page 32
 
 (Clarification): Under the Rotor Assemblies table, the "Wt"
 note should have the following addition:
 
 "Wt: Weight, in tonnes, per tonne of power plant _devoted to
 lift._"
 
 Page 33
 
 (Addition): Under "Step 6: Crew and Passengers," helicopters
 which are equipped with ejection seats may only be equipped with
 advanced ejection seats.
 
 (Addition): Under "Step 6: Crew and Passengers," each
 crewmember or passenger carried has a mass of 0.1 tonnes.
 
 (Addition): Under "Step 7: Life Support," add the following
 clarification:
 
 _Although aircraft systems are calculated by mass, not volume,
 certain life support systems have their characteristics based on
 volume rather than weight alone. When calculating these systems,
 the volume basis is the total volume of all crew positions and
 passenger seats. Volume for these components is listed on the
 tables on pages 47 and 62._
 
 Page 34
 
 (Addition): Under the "Weight" subsection of "Rating Your
 Design", the total weight of all components should also include
 crew and passengers (0.1 tonne each) in addition to the other
 components listed.
 
 Page 35
 
 (Correction): At the end of the second paragraph of the right
 column, delete the sentence, "Aircraft flying NOE have their
 agilities doubled."
 
 (Correction): In the size table at the bottom of the page, the
 range of displacement tonnage for a Small target should read
 _100_-999, not "199-999."
 
 Page 49
 
 (Correction): On the Maser Communicators table, the volume of a
 tech level 15 30km maser should be _.001_, not ".002."
 
 Page 50
 
 (Addition): Add the following note beneath the Radar tables:
 _Antenna Price (in MCr): Antenna area * 0.05_
 
 Page 53
 
 (Addition): Add the following note beneath the Area Jammers
 table:
 
 Antenna Size: Antenna size in square meters is equal to
 required power in megawatts divided by 50.
 
 Page 56
 
 (Change): The mass of ERA should be _0.2_ tonnes per cubic
 meter, not "4." The price of ERA should be volume times _0.0007_,
 not "0.007."
 
 Page 57
 
 (Addition): Modify the Nuclear Damper Design table to include
 Minimum MW and Minimum Volume columns as follows:
 
 TL  MW       Min MW  Vol  Min Vol MCr
 12  0.0005   1.5     5    7.5     0.13
 13  0.0003   0.9     8    7.2     0.3
 14  0.0002   0.6    10    6       0.67
 15  0.0001   0.3    11    3.3     1.5
 16  0.00008  0.24   13    3.12    2
 18  0.00006  0.18   16    2.88    4
 20  0.00003  0.09   18    1.62    6
 
 Add the following notes beneath the table:
 
 Min MW: Minimum power requirement for a damper at this tech
 level, in MW
 
 Min Vol: Minimum allowable volume of a damper at this tech
 level, in cubic meters
 
 Page 62
 
 (Addition): At the end of the first (incomplete) paragraph,
 replace the last sentence, "Docking rings allow no maintenance or
 repair." with the following passage:
 
 _A docking ring may only accommodate craft of one specific
 displacement (in tons) and one specific hull form and
 configuration (e.g., a 10-ton streamlined cylinder or a 30-ton
 unstreamlined wedge), designated during the design sequence.
 Airframe configurations may not be accommodated in docking rings.
 Docking rings allow not maintenance or repair tasks, but do not
 prevent maintenance hours from being spent._
 
 Page 63
 
 (Addition): The first two sentences of the Chemical Power
 Plants section were accidentally deleted. Add them before the
 first existing sentence:
 
 _"The first steam power plants burned wood to heat water in an
 enclosed boiler. As the water boiled, the steam was contained
 under pressure and used to turn reciprocating pistons that turn a
 drive shaft."_
 
 Page 67
 
 (Change): Under the Explosive Power Generation table, the
 "Mass" note should be changed to read, "The mass of the
 cartridge, in tonnes, is equal to its volume in cubic meters
 multiplied by _4_," not "8."
 
 Page 70
 
 (Change): On the Self-Contained Thrusters table, the FC value
 for EAPlaC should be changed to _0.3_ from "0.225."
 
 Page 88
 
 (Clarification): The last sentence above the Sights and
 Rangefinders table should be modified to read:
 
 "When a weapon equipped with a point-defense computer fires at
 _a_ ballistic projectile, the projectile\'s _target movement
 difficulty modifier (from the table of the same name on TNE page
 294)_ is halved@"
 
 (Correction): Under "Indirect Fire Control," delete the
 sentence:
 
 "Indirect fire sights on mortars have half the weight and cost
 of those for CPR guns."
 
 In fact, simple indirect fire sights are already automatically
 included on mortars (see page 109).
 
 Page 94
 
 (Clarification): In the right hand column, all references to
 "penetration" should, of course, be to "penetration _rating."_
 
 Page 97
 
 (Clarification): The last sentence of the "Cassette" section
 should be modified as follows:
 
 "The price of an empty cassette is equal to the price of a
 single round of _ball_ ammunition for the weapon multiplied by
 500."
 
 Page 103
 
 (Clarification): In the right-hand column, the second sentence
 of section "3. Receiver Price" should be modified as follows:
 
 "If capable of selective _or multi-selective_ fire (one _or
 more_ automatic rate), multiply price by 1.2."
 
 Page 110
 
 (Correction): The formula for computing the direct fire range
 of a mass driver is wrong. Replace the second paragraph of the
 "1. Direct Fire Range" subsection with the following:
 
 "Short direct fire range in meters for a mass drive gun firing
 a kinetic penetrator round is equal to _five times the sum of its
 bore size in centimeters plus one-twentieth its muzzle velocity
 in meters per second plus 20. SR = 5 [B + (Vö20) + 20]"_
 
 Page 121
 
 (Change): Under section "D. Range," change the last two
 paragraphs to read as follows:
 
 "Short direct fire range in meters for a plasma gun is _100
 times the square root of its pulse energy in megajoules._
 
 Short direct fire range in meters for a fusion gun is _150
 times the square root of its pulse energy in megajoules."_
 
 (Change): Under section "E. Damage Value," change the formula
 to read _30_ times the square root of E, rather than "11.5."
 
 Page 122
 
 (Change): Replace the second and third paragraphs (both single
 sentences) on the page with the following single paragraph:
 
 "Plasma and fusion weapons have a penetration rating of 1-2-10."
 (Change): Change the first five lines of the Price Multiplier
 table to read as follows:
 Component              Plasma  Fusion
 Firing Unit            600*    1000*
 Support Hardware       600*    1000*
 Gyro-Compensator*      600     600
 Inertial Compensator*  1000    1000
 Recoil Cradle          25      25
 
 (Correction): "Empty magazines cost _Cr10_ per kilogram,
 rounding fractions up," not "Cr1".
 
 (Clarification): Under "K. Recoil," make the following addition
 to the "Ww" note:
 
 "Ww: Weight, in kilograms, of weapon (loaded). _When a recoil
 compensator is fitted, Ww includes the weight of the backpack.
 When no recoil compensator is fitted, Ww does not include the
 backpack."_
 
 Page 144
 
 (Correction): The volume of a tech level 11-12 500-kiloton
 warhead should be _.388,_ not ".4."
 
 Page 145
 
 (Addition): Add the following note beneath the Homing guidance
 table:
 
 _Range: Maximum short range of the guidance system. This can be
 reduced if the missile\'s propellant limits it to a lower range._
 (Addition): Add information to the Smart Warheads Sensor table
 as follows:
 
 TL Type           Mass  Cr      Memory Range  Seeker Range
 7  Visual         1     200     _8_           _40_
 7  Infrared       1     2000    _4_           _20_
 8  Imaging Radar  1     10,000  _8_           _40_
 _Memory Range: The maximum short range of a target memory
 missile equipped with this sensor. This can be reduced if the
 missile\'s propellant limits it to a lower range._
 
 _Seeker Range: The maximum short range of a target seeker
 missile equipped with this sensor. This can be reduced if the
 missile\'s propellant limits it to a lower range._
 
 Page 146
 
 (Correction): Under section "B. Atmospheric Rockets and
 Missiles," make the following change to the last sentence in
 subsection "9. Range":
 
 "For homing, _target memory, and target seeker_ missiles, short
 range is _equal to this maximum range or the listed short range
 of the guidance system, whichever is lower."_
 
 (Addition): Under section "C. Space Missiles," add the
 following sentence to the end of subsection "9. Determine Max Gs
 per Turn":
 
 _Round all fractions down for final G rating._
 (Addition): For both atmospheric and space rockets and
 missiles, the armor value of the missile\'s airframe skin is
 dependent upon fuel type and tech level.
 
 Fuel Type    TL 5-6  TL 7  TL 8+
 Liquid Fuel  0.5     1     2
 Solid Fuel   1       2     3
 
 Page 147
 
 (Addition): On the Receiver Length table, the LV Semiautomatic
 is also used for RAM Semiautomatic and the LV Automatic is also
 used for RAM Automatic.
 
 Page 149
 
 (Addition): Under Tac Missile Launchers, the volume of a tube
 launcher is equal to 4 times missile volume. The volume of the
 magazine of a magazine launcher is equal to the volume of the
 missiles contained in it. Note that tac missiles have a volume in
 liters equal to their mass in kilograms.
 
 Page 150
 
 (Correction): At the end of the first paragraph, delete the
 reference to the designator\'s effective range being equal to its
 medium (twice short) range. Designator tasks are rolled using the
 designator\'s listed short, medium, long, and extreme ranges, as
 discussed on TNE page 278.
 
 Therefore, in the second paragraph, the TL-7 laser designator
 simply has a short range of 3 kilometers, and no "useful range."
 (Addition): Under "Direct Fire Rocket Launchers" add the
 following passage to the end of subsection "E. Range":
 
 _Unguided rockets are inherently inaccurate at long ranges. The
 short and medium range bands for direct fire rockets are
 calculated normally. However, direct fire rockets have no long or
 extreme range bands, so may not be fired in direct fire mode at
 longer than medium range._
 
 Page 151
 
 (Addition): Under "Space Missile Launchers," add the following
 sentence to the end of the fifth paragraph:
 
 _"The mass of a mechanical reloader in tonnes is equal to its
 volume in cubic meters times 0.5."_
 
 Page 152
 
 (Clarification): The Capacity of the wingtip launch rail
 should be understood to be "100kg _worth of_ missiles or
 rockets."
 
 Page 153
 
 (Correction and Addition): On the Sandcasters table, the Beam
 Reduction of the TL-8 sandcaster should be 1D6*5, not "1D6*6."
 Beneath the table, add the note that all listed sandcasters mass
 50 tonnes and draw 1 MW of power.
 
 (Corrections): The masses and prices on the Nuclear Dampers
 table should be changed as follows:
 
 TL  Description        Mass    Price   Power
 12  Damper Barbette    _76.2_  _2.05_  15
 13  Damper Barbette    _73.2_  _2.8_   9
 14  Damper Barbette    _60.8_  _4.06_  6
 15  Damper Turret      _33.5_  _4.53_  3
 
 (Corrections and Addition): On the Space Missiles table, delete
 the line for the TL-8 missile; there is no such weapon. The G-
 Turns for the TL-12 semi-independent missile should be _9/9_, not
 "8/8," and for the TL-14 semi-independent missile should be
 _7/7_, not "8/8."
 
 All missiles on the table have an armor value of 3. The semi-
 independent missiles have an endurance of 10 hours; after this
 time they behave as normal controlled missiles.
 
 Pages 155-156
 
 (Correction): All references to "7x46mm" ammunition should read
 _7x30mm._
 
 Page 156
 
 (Change): Because of the high energy weapons upgrade, the
 details of the TL-13 plasma cradle gun have changed as follows:
 Under Specifications:
 
 Cartridge Mass: (.0036*_4_=) _.0144_ tonnes (_14.4_ kg)
 Under Weapon Design, Mass:
 
 Autoloader: (30*_14.4_=) _432_ kg
 
 TOTAL: _832_ kg
 
 Under Weapon Design, Range:
 
 Short Range: (_3.46_*_100_=) _346, round to 350_
 Medium Range: (_350_*2=) 700
 Long Range: (_350_*4=) 1400
 Extreme Range: (_350_*8=) 2800
 
 Under Weapon Design, Damage Value:
 
 Damage: (_30_*3.46=) _103.92 (104)_
 
 Under Weapon Design, Penetration:
 Value: _104-104-52-10_
 
 Under Weapon Design, Price:
 Firing Unit: (48*_600_=) Cr_28,800_
 Support Hardware: (72*_600_=) Cr _43,200_
 Autoloader: (_432_*10=) Cr_4320_
 TOTAL: Cr_200,320_
 
 Under Weapon Design, Volume:
 Autoloader: (.432_*_1=) _.432_
 TOTAL: _.772_ cubic meters
 
 Page 157
 
 (Changes): These changes are also necessary because of the high
 energy weapon upgrade. Under "Step 6 -- Weaponry," the 12-Mj Plasma
 Cradle Gun has a volume of _1.544,_ a mass of _0.832_, and a
 price of _200,320_, and 400xPPC have a mass of _5.76_.
 
 Under "Step 9 -- Cargo," volume should be _16.576_ and mass should
 be _4.144_.
 
 Page 158
 
 (Changes): On the Design Recapitulation table, the changes
 noted above for page 157 must be made, resulting in the following
 changes to the total:
 
 Mass is _25.5356_ tonnes unloaded and _36.6236_ tonnes loaded,
 and Price is _1,713,739.7._
 
 The charts below will allow owners of Traveller: The New Era
 Smash & Grab, and the Reformation Coalition Equipment Guide to

     penetration :-)
     Unfortunately, I don\'t agree with his first point :-(
     
     He writes:
     "... a laser ... with an intensity less than 0.390625 Mj/cm^2 ... will 
     have a PR > 1 and a Damage Value of 1 or less"
     
     A laser with an intensity of 0.25Mj/cm^2 (figure off the top of my 
     head) will have a damage value of 25, and an official Penetration 
     Rating of Nil.  Allowing an IPR < 1 (using my, unofficial rule) would 
     give a penetration of 3.
     
     Sorry to be negative, especially when you took the time to reply to my 
     query, but I still haven\'t heard anything to discount my IPR < 1 
     ruling.
     
     I\'m happier with your second point, though.  The idea of trading range 
     for penetration feels right, although I\'ll need to examine FF&S again 
     tonight to see exactly what definitions are used for the relationships 
     between damage, penetration, power, intensity (now, where did I put my 
     Optics text books?).
     
     Big thanks to GDW for the FF&S errata.  I wish other companies were so 
     willing to admit their mistakes and correct them.  Since I tend to buy 
     Traveller products as soon as they come out (impatient, moi?), I 
     always seem to have the first printing with the most errors.
     
     Incidentally, has anyone on this side of the Atlantic seen Striker II 
     in the shops yet?  Thanks to John Bogan for the brief overview.  Is 
     Striker II a boardgame with counters, maps, etc, or a miniatures 
     wargame?  (Should I buy it as soon as it comes out, or wait for the 
     corrected printing with errata applied? :-))

For all of you that wanted to design these instruments of destruction, 
but never got around to it...

I spent a few hours last night designing an rough skeleton of the Death 
Star and the Star Destroyer (well, a Super Star Destroyer: a Star 
Destroyer is only about 1 milion Disp).

First, I had to extend the hull table to accomodate these monsters...

       Displacement      Kilolitres       MV            Length
        (Millions)       (Millions)

SSDestr   100               1,400         60 524        1 388 metres
D. Star  6400              89,600    247 906 978       88 833 metres

Then I installed a jumpdrive, jump6 for the SSDestroyer, jump2 for the 
Death Star...

Jump6, TL F    Volume       Mass            Cr        Surface Area       
              (Millions)   (Millions)   (Trillions)    (Millions)
SSDestr          98          196           29.4           32.667

Jump2, TL F

Death Star      1,792        3,584        537.6          5,973.333

[note: the surface area for the Super Star Destroyer is about half of 
it\'s total surface area!  This may pose problems for the future, and 
indicate why it\'s most powerful weaponry is high-powered lasers.  And you 
can probably forget either Contra-grav (not missed) or EMM (definitely 
missed, but then again, you don\'t expect this ship to _hide_, do you?)]

Weaponry

No, I didn\'t do this part.  However, I suspect that the Super Star 
Destroyer\'s top armorment would be lasers measured in the million\'s of 
joules.  As for the Death Star... well, it can certainly blow up a small 
moon, but even with a meson gun worthy of deathless fame throughout the 
ages, the best it can do to a Earth-sized planet is slowly strip off it\'s 
crust.

To get firepower of sufficent magnitude, what you need is probably a 
disintergrater gun of legendary dimensions.  However, I lack hard data on 
the force needed to blow up a planet ("how many hit\'s can a planet 
take?"), or the neccessary info to build this gun.  Any takers? 

Power Plant

I have no idea of the power consumption needed by these beasties, so I 
decreed that that the powerplant is 3% of the total volume (the 
powerplant for Steve Bonnevilles\' _Azhanti High Lightling_ is 5%, but TL F 
powerplants are twice as efficent).

              Volume           Mass              MW              Cr
            (Millions)      (Millions)        (Billions)     (Trillions)

SSDestr         42             84               .252             8.4
Death Star    2,668          5,336             16.008          533.6

Engineering Crew (assuming TL F computers)
  Super Star Destroyer            1,680,000
  Death Star                    106,720,000

Estimated Ship crew (\'Engineering crew x 3\' is my rule of thumb)
  Super Star Destroyer            5,040,000
  Death Star                    320,160,000

Estimated Cost (Power Plant cost x 5)
  Super Star Destroyer             42 TCr
  Death Star                    2,668 TCr

.. Now, about feasibility.

Assuming every Hi-Pop system can pay 5 TCr of the bill for a Super Star 
Destroyer (ie. money that would have been earmarked for five Trillion Credit 
Squadrons, of four ship\'s each), you would need 8.4 Hi-Pop systems to 
build a SSD, and 33.6 Hi-Pop systems to build a squadron of four.  Now, 
because a typical Imperial Sector (a *Third* Imperial Sector:) has  
between 30-40 Hi-Pop systems, a Sector Duke would be trading his 1,000 
ship Navy for a squadron of near-invinsible warships (imagine trying to 
get a critical hit on these babies!).  Pleasing to the ego, but not sane 
military strategy.

As for the Death Star... well, remarkably enough, the Third Imperium 
*can* build it (THAT\'s how big the Third Imperium is!).  Not only that, 
but it could do so without touching the Imperial Navy! (you can kiss 
goodbye to the Planetary (non-jump) warships and IISS, however.)

You need 2668 TCr to build one; that is, 533.6 Hi-Pop systems.  Now, 
since the entire Imperium only contains about 880 Hi-Pop systems, you 
would be using 60.6% of your Naval budget to build this technological 
monstrosity.  The entire Imperial Navy, with it\'s roughly 42,000 major 
ships, 126,000 minor ships and 20 Naval Depots is worth about 3000 TCr.  
But \'the _other_ Imperial Navy\', the Planetary squadrons and the 
Imperial Scouts,  are also worth 3000 TCr.  Guess who\'s budget disappear\'s?

Of course, you can just stick to Star Destroyers.  At 1 Million 
displacement, they are twice the size of the current Imperial 
heavyweight, the 500 kiloton _Tigress_ Dreadnaught\'s.  Moreover, they 
won\'t cause the Sector Minister of Finance to stir restlessly in 
sweat-filled nightmares.  Perhaps someone here would like to try his 
hand in building one...?

I was planning to submit this story to Chalange, but they limit 
adventures to 4000 words.  When my rough draft hit 1200 - and I was only 
a fourth of the way through - I decided to develop my \'other\' story 
idea for Challange. (which I havent even started yet)

And what about my old story?  Well, I\'m submitting the portion I saved to 
disk.  If you like, I\'ll submit the rest within the week.  If not... 
well, at least I didn\'t submit this to Challange.

Hi there,
        Alvin, you message was unreadable by my mail reader (Pine).  Was 
it a Mime formated message?  If it was, Pine can not handle mime so if 
you could post your adventure again (or send it to me), It would be great.

Thanks a lot, and Happy new Year!

     Django Upton provides some feedback to my rantings about laser
     penetration :-)
     Unfortunately, I don\'t agree with his first point :-(

     He writes:
     "... a laser ... with an intensity less than 0.390625 Mj/cm^2 ... will
     have a PR > 1 and a Damage Value of 1 or less"

     A laser with an intensity of 0.25Mj/cm^2 (figure off the top of my
     head) will have a damage value of 25, and an official Penetration
     Rating of Nil.  Allowing an IPR < 1 (using my, unofficial rule) would
     give a penetration of 3.

     Sorry to be negative, especially when you took the time to reply to my
     query, but I still haven\'t heard anything to discount my IPR < 1
     ruling.

     I\'m happier with your second point, though.  The idea of trading range
     for penetration feels right, although I\'ll need to examine FF&S again
     tonight to see exactly what definitions are used for the relationships
     between damage, penetration, power, intensity (now, where did I put my
     Optics text books?).
 ----

You are confusing Damage VALUE ( used to determine armour penetration ) with 
Damage DICE ( used to determine the effect on unarmoured personnel only ).
If you actually read the rules in FF&S you may be surprised to find that 
lasers that can\'t penetrate tinfoil can still fry an unprotected human! 
Silly that rule may be but there you are.

FYI:
Damage VALUE = 2.5*I^(1/2) If > 1 then round to nearest integer
1/PR = IPR = 0.8*I^(1/2) If >or= 0.5 then round to nearest integer; else 
=nil
Damage DICE = (Damage Value - [armour*PR] )*25
If PR=nil then Damage DICE against unprotected targets may be precalculated 
using:
Damage DICE = (Damage Value * 25) rounded to nearest integer

e.g.
I=0.390625 MJ/cm^2
DV=1.5625 rounded to 2
IPR=0.5 rounded to 1
Damage Dice
AV=0 : 50
AV=1 : 25
AV>=2 :0

I=0.25 MJ/cm^2
DV=1.25 rounded to 1
IPR=0.4 rounded to nil
Damage Dice =25

I=0.1024 MJ/cm^2
DV=0.8
IPR=0.256 rounded to nil
Damage Dice= 20


The two things that I think GDW have missed are:
 - It is assumed that lasers cannot be focussed on an area less than 1 cm^2
(solution? "R" in the intensity formula may be <1 for IPR ONLY)
 - If damage is not rounded then a fractional amount may be left after 
penetration which would be sufficient to cause 1 or more personnel damage 
dice. This is important at the intensities common for small arms lasers. 
This is particularly evident if the IPR is not rounded and the above 
focussing rule is used.

Also it seems that the rating of armour is too coarse for personnel armour. 
You either stop 25 dice of damage per step or none at all!

Django.

I\'ll jump in here and say that the configuration on the mailing list
software has been tweaked to handle MIME messages better.  Further
messages should be fine.

Prelude - (to referees) don\'t be afraid to let your PC\'s fail
        - can cut and paste ideas into other adventures
        - this is an attempt at a "tough" adventure; in order for the PC\'s to
          earn this much money, a lot of legwork is needed.  The firepower 
          will be needed, but more towards the end of the game.

Glisten  027-1202

The PC\'s discover a news article regarding an Aslan Female, Hlausau\' 
Ktyakuhois, who was last seen over a year ago in the Glisten system.  
Considered a major political figure in her homespace of Ranib subsector 
(Trojan Rift - M), she was exploring business opportunities for
the Oikhoiseaha clan when she vanished.  The article also noted that the 
reward for her safe return has been increased from 30 to 42 MCr.

The wisest course for the PC\'s is to head for Glisten and contact the local 
representative of the Oikhoiseaha clan, E\'ae Kouwoureal.  There will be a 
brief discussion; before the meeting, make an Average roll of Liaison 
(using the highest Liaison rating among the PC\'s) to see if the PC\'s
remember the formalities and preparations needed to signal their respect 
towards the clan leader.

During the discussion - which will last only two minutes - make a Difficult 
roll of Liaison. Difficulty should be altered according to the amount of 
preparation the PC\'s make for their audience.

Outstanding Success = hired indefinitely.  All known information regarding
Kty
is later given to the PC\'s by one of Kty\'s aides.  All expenses are paid, 
up to a limit of 100,000 Cr per month for a year.  Afterwards a retainer 
of 10,000 Cr is paid per month to the party.

["Kty" : short form for Ktyakouhois.  DON\'T use in her presence!]

Success = hired for a year. Basic living expenses are paid for, and a fee of 
1500 Cr per PC is paid out every month.  Basic information about Kty is 
provided to the PC\'s.

Failure = not hired.  The PC\'s must somehow foot the cost of looking for Kty,
as well as worry about basic living expenses - Glisten is an expensive 
system to live in. 

Outstanding Failure = not hired.  Moreover, they have challanged the pride of
the clan, and find themselves facing a formal duel.  Even if the PC\'s 
back down correctly, the clan will work to discourage them in their 
search.  If they manage to find Kty, they may be forced to accept less
than a tenth of the reward money due.

----

Common knowledge: If this isn\'t given to the PC\'s, basic data on Kty can be 
found in a variety of government and clan databases.  To obtain 
unauthorized access to the database of either the local Ministry of 
Commerce and Trade (which handles the main starport, located at Seraiian
Asteroid) or the Police Datachannel (a system-wide Missing Person\'s report 
exists throughout the system), the following procedure must be followed: 


A) Finding out the physical spec\'s needed to imitate an authorized 
   terminal & user ID.
   Formidable: Research
B) Altering a regular terminal to fit the electronic signature of a
legitimate
   terminal.
   Difficult: Electronics or Communications
C) Forging a low-level security clearance code for the user.
   Average: Forgery
D) Accessing the database.
   Easy: Computer 

The above tasks assume that a sufficent amount of time and tools is used. 
Moreover, all actions are assummed to be at TL F.  Increase Research 
difficulity by one level for every tech era the PC\'s homeworld is below 
High Stellar: increase the difficulity of all other
tasks by one level for every Tech level below F the PC is operating at.

The PC\'s may choose to contact the local criminal underground to do the work.
The Referee is advised to negotiate hard for every \'service\' required, 
and demand exorbant compensation for these services.  Moreover, the 
Referee should factor in the possibility of scams and double-crossing.  
Finally, there\'s always the possibility that the criminal didn\'t do
the job properly, putting the PC\'s continued stay in Glisten - even their 
freedom - in jeopardy.

If the PC\'s target the clan\'s database, they will have to obtain physical 
access to a networked terminal in the clan\'s holding on Sarodon 
Asteroid.  The clan compound here houses the entire Oikhoiseaha clan, and 
is also the site of the gravitics factory they are constructing.  Once the
PC\'s have somehow sneaked onto the site, they need to imitate - or \'borrow\' -

an retnial pattern and the voice of an Aslan with the security clearances 
needed.

----

Detailed knowledge: the PC\'s will only be able to have this level of
knowledge
about Kty only by A) having it given to them by the clan leadership B) 
conducting interviews with the *right* Aslans (knowing who to interview is 
a task in it\'s own right!) C) successfully logging on to the clan
database, getting meaningful data from the right databases, and making the 
right connections with this pile of vaguely related mass of information.

There is another way.  Both researching Kty\'s background and making the 
connections are definitely easier if they choose to make the trip to 
Kty\'s homeworld, Lysewekh (Ranib: Trojan Reach/0640 A6205LA-E).  Going on 
regular jump4 Aslan liners (Regency ships are quarrentined
for 6 months before being permitted to travel deep into Aslan space), the
trip
covers 14 jumps (about 45 parsecs), takes 28 weeks and costs 14,000 Cr 
per passenger in low berth.  To compare: the typical Regency citizen 
earns about 12,000 Cr a year.

The wise PC will be on his guard, this deep in Aslan space.  Few humans 
routinely travel this far into Aslan territory; thus, only a few 
professional Aslans have tolerance skill. 

The system itself is essentially a trade and military station.  Humans will
be
tolerated, but watched carefully.

If you put energy into a planet at a rate sufficient to cause the total 
energy (input energy - radiated heat) to equal gravitational binding 
energy it will come apart.  However for earth size planets this number is 
huge.  Someone actually posted this info way back when.  It would 
probably much more effiecient to smash the planet repeatedly with metal 
plugs/rocks moving at .001c or .01c.  Clearly not as glamourous.  

I think when the info was posted way back when the meson gun needed to 
bust an earthsize planet had a crew of 1.2 million.  Clearly you could 
wreck everything on the surface with a weapon orders of magnitude 
smaller.  Difference between Star Wars and Traveller is that Traveller 
attempts to explain and rationalize the functioning of the technology and 
to base it upon scientific principles.  Star Wars does not even make the 
slightest attempt to do that...it is Sci Fantasy and not Sci Fi.  
Therefore a traveller weapon will NEVER replicate the effects of a Star 
Wars weapon given similiar size/power reqs etc.

This is not to say that there can be no new scientific understanding that 
would allow such weapons.  But you know what....
It is a game and if youre just playing to PCs make something up and have 
a really good explanation that you give with an utterly straight face.

Blaster is a Star Wars term like Speeder.  We saw at least 3 different
things called speeders in the movies (Luke\'s Speeder on Tantooine, The
Small fighters that Luke used to engage the Imperial Walkers in Empire
Strikes Back, and the grav-bikes from the third movie).  So I think 
blaster was a generic term for a "Pulse Laser".  They did that (I think)
because people assosciate "Laser" with long beam of energy and the "Blasters"
used short beams of energy.

In at least one case, the blaster was probably the equiv of a fusion or
plasma gun (the scene in the first movie where Luke rushes home to the ruins
of his uncle\'s farm and the charred skeletal remains of his uncle and aunt
are laying on the ground.)  Obviouslly, none of the normal blasters left
that kind of distruction.

These were both rough estimates of mine from this fall.  They only
included the roughly 640 numbered fleets of Imperial regulars and
Subsector Reserves.  I figured each had 5 squadrons, each squadron 
worth about TCr 1.  This *doesn\'t* include the infrastructure costs
of the hundreds of Imperial naval bases or the nineteen depots.  I\'m
not even sure that the TankRons are covered in that cost.

The second TCr 3000 for the planetary navies and the IISS was not
even that far thought out.  However, just for each HiPop and near
HiPop world, at 1000 worlds, they could spend just TCr 1 on local
defense and pay a total of TCr 1000 easily.  The IISS has to pay
for operation of the huge xboat service and for the government\'s
Imperial Courier Service, and the costs there depend partly on
how good the services are.  Those also could easily run up into
the hundreds of trillions of credits.  The lesser worlds will 
operate a small number of ships for planetary defense and customs
duties, and the rest of the IISS will need some ships, too.  Some
of that cost could be considered to be the *really* old IN ships
mothballed in the Depots and Inactive Ships Facilities.  Then there
are the infrastructure costs not in that figure, for about a
hundred or so Xboat Way Stations, a few hundred IISS bases, the
local planetary naval facilities, and so on.  

Remember too, those figures are for the *assets*, not the budgets.  
They represent the ship acquisition costs for the various Imperial
space forces over a normal twenty to forty year replacement cycle.
During wartime, yearly costs would go up as the replacement cycle
shortens to replace ships lost to battle damage.

The rough estimates of the Imperium using the colony model I did
suggest that all the Imperial navies should have 42,000 major ships,
126,000 minor ships, and 126 million personnel.  What leads from
this?  Well,

  * For 21 sector fleets, each sector gets 2000 major ships, 
    6300 minor ships, and 6.3 million naval personel.  There
    are actually 28 sector fleets, but there are quite a few
    sectors with less than sixteen subsectors.  I think that
    _Rebellion Sourcebook_ claimed that the regular IN had
    about 1000 major combatants per sector, so this looks 
    pretty good. 

  * At 1000 major combatants per sector, the regular IN would
    have squadrons of 12 to 13 major combatants.  I think that
    "major combatant" covers everything down to the 10,000 d-ton
    escort destroyers, or even smaller, so this checks too.  

  * Each squadron gets about 20,000 personnel.  This may be a
    little short for TNE -- thirty or forty thousand would make
    more sense.  However, this figure includes the IISS and
    planetary "squadrons", which may need fewer crew than the
    IN and colonials.  In any case, some fiddling could 
    be done to fix this if necessary.  If the definition of
    "major combatant" goes down to destroyers and 1000 d-ton
    destroyer escorts, there shouldn\'t be a problem here as
    it is. 

  * 126 million personnel are only about 0.08% of all the people
    in uniform in the military, by _WTH_.  At a total Imperial
    population of 15.77 trillion, most people in the Imperium
    will never be in the space forces.  Less than one person
    in one hundred thousand.  However, there are quite a few
    more people that get into space by working for the shipping
    lines, which have more people in them than the space forces. 

  * The navy can\'t be much bigger -- it\'s too expensive.  It
    looks like the HiPop worlds would be paying on the order
    of half a trillion credits a year just maintaining and
    replacing the fleet at it\'s current size.  Each.  And the
    IN builds at TL15; more navy ships tie up the high tech
    starport yards, making for less-efficient merchants.

remarks and questions about it.

Overall it is an impressive work, but I simply don\'t understand why GDW
uses the artist they\'ve used here. And the colours on the cover certainly
dosen\'t help much. Quite unattractive, IMO at least. I mean, I know tastes 
differ and all that, but Loren, do you really think that artist is any good? 

(Hmmm.... Wait a minute while I check... Ah! I think I\'ve solved the
mystery. The cover artist has the same name as the Art Director...)

Be that as it may, the book is full of useful material and the three
campaigns presented in it are all three interesting. But I would have
liked a sample economy. There are some thing I\'m not too sure about.

Why does the equipment and buildings in the Agricultural and the Raw
Material sectors not require maintenance?

(Assume TL 9 for all questions below.) 

Is it correct that a Light Industrial Laborer needs Cr 7,500 worth of Heavy 
Industrial Capital Goods and Cr 3,750 worth of Construction Capital Goods? 

Is it correct that a Heavy Industrial Laborer needs Cr 22,500 worth of Heavy 
IC and Cr 3,750 of Construction IC?

How much HICG does a Construction Laborer require? (Its still Cr 3,750 worth
of Construction CG, right?)

Is it correct that a Heavy IL uses 1.5 KW and 110 TONS(!) of Raw material 
to produce Cr 2000 worth of Heavy IC while a Light IL uses the same amount
of power and only (!) 55 tons of Raw Material to produce Cr 2000 worth of
Light IC? (That can\'t be right, can it?)

Is it correct that a Materials Laborer requires Cr 1500 worth of Heavy IC
and no Construction IC at all?

Can one ML really produce 500 tons (500,000 kilos) of Raw Material in a 
month?

Finally some comments and ideas:

Why would any TL 10+ society bother with roads at all? Surely a society
with cheap anti-gravity vehicles won\'t need anything much more sophisticated
than Trails & Tracks? Remember those cities that Beam Piper described with
tall buildings separated by green areas?

For any society much larger than a holiday camp you\'ll need another sector:
Administration. This sector can be as large as the other sectors allow it
to be (you can always make more work for administrators), but I do think
there is a real need for some coordination of any society. I have no idea
what the minimum administration any society can manage with, but it must
be more than nothing. As a pure guess I would suggest [Population Level] in
percent (So a 100 man group would need two full time coordinators, a 1000
man would need 30, 10,000 would need 400, and so on until population level
A where a full 10% of the population would be needed just to keep track of
everything (though I would allow computers to substitute to some degree).
Does this sound reasonable?

Another sector you\'ve ignored is the Service Sector. That includes everybody
who makes life a little easier or more fun for other people: Waiters, hair-
dressers, sport and arts performers, fiction writers and game manufacturers,
etc. This would be the basis of another Satisfaction Index. A very important
one too. The Romans put it ahead of shelter and goods (Bread and Circuses,
remember? ;-).

You seem to think that everybody in a colony will have the same standard of
food, accomodation, and possessions. This may be true in a new colony
(although even there I would expect the common folk to bunk in 20-man
huts while the colony leaders lorded it in a whole quarter hut apiece), but
I don\'t believe it will ever be the case in any sizable society. And for
the purposes of determining civil resentment you need the lowest standard,
not the average. I\'m not sure quite how to implement it. You could make
it possible to differentiate by sector. Or perhaps tie Social Standing to
standard of living and describe a society by how many of its members belong
to each level. So one society would be 90% middle class people while
another with the exact same economy could be 60% low, 30% middle, and 10%
upper class.

I have built a list of differences between World Tamer\'s handbook and 
World Builders handbook, to see which worlds of a sector I am working on 
need to be regenerated.  I thought initially that there would not be much 
work, but there is more than I thought.

Here are the differences, in case they are of interest to others:

I.1. Stellar mass of M0 II stars now 16
I.4. Process to establish tidal locking different for K and M type 
primaries
II. Luminosity of M0 III different, but so small that not worth worrying 
about.
V. Axial tilt table similar, but has different brackets - not worth 
worrying about unless you are very particular.
VIII. Density and Gravity done using variation on standard TNE rules, so 
these will all be different, as will everything that uses them (like 
planetary mass, distance of satellites, rotational period of satellites).
IX. Mass will be different, due to changes in step VIII.
Satellites: Tidal locking done differently.

There were two other differences that were actually corrections of WBH 
typos, rather than true changes. The designer correctly establishes 
satellite orbital distance by multiplying orbit number by planet radius 
(instead of diameter) and has the formula for planetary rotational period 
producing a result in hours (instead of days).

The only thing that looks missing is on p87. Mainworlds being satellites 
of gas giants are mentioned but no masses are given - these are needed if 
you want to apply the formulae that follow. Perhaps they will be in the 
second edition. They were stated in WBH, but were wrong, which doesn\'t 
help much (WBH definitions meant Jupiter and Saturn would both be small 
gas giants, instead of large, as they should be).

The designer appears to have had a problem with world gravities.  TNE 
implies low density is 0.7 standard, and high density 2.0 standard (by the 
world gravity table), but these are grossly different to WBH. The 
compromise seems to be to use 0.7 and 2.0 figures for world gravity and 
0.55 and 1.55 elsewhere. I have no idea which of the two sets is better, 
maybe someone like Duncan Law-Green can comment, if still around.

I suspect that there should be two different tables for establishing 
densities, one for terrestoid planets and one for satellites of planets. 
In our solar system, Mercury, Venus and the Earth are of comparable 
density; Mars is 0.71 that of Earth. Satellites of planets range from .2 
standard to 0.65 standard. I\'ve deliberately ignored Pluto.

In the Alien book "Solomani & Aslan", I luckily picked up 2nd hand two
weeks ago, I found out that the "Charted Space" isn\'t all charted
space but that there\'s more information available.  The book shows 4
sectors below and a couple of sectors left of the "normal" map shown
for example in the TNE rules book as charted space.

Now I\'ve two questions: Do the other alien books also enlarge the
charted space (I would be very interested in the Zhodani empire) and
is there anything more than a page full of small dots available (like
the atlas of the imperium for the emperial space)?

Perhaps a computer readable version of the Aslan space (or the
Solomani Rimwards region) is already available.  Otherwise I would
suggest a project to chart this space (make a worlds list). Although
the map didn\'t show individual hexes, I\'ve tried to scan a small part
of the map page and with 400dpi one could locate each world exactly in
the column and with a little luck also in the row (small errors may be
possible).  If there are enough voluntaries who would like to chart
two or four subsectors, it wouldn\'t be much work.

We could also generate the (not really official) UWPs for all worlds.
Because this hasn\'t done already (if I know right) there\'s no
copyright on these worlddata and one could make the lists free
available??

Btw: what\'s the legal status of the other world data (available per
ftp)? Has GDW granted their permission? Or would GDW grant their to
the above idea? Loren? (Unrelated to the question whether have to be asked
or not.) In general, what\'s about the copyright of material generated
with the help of a rules book?  I got the impression that some
companies follow the idea that all ideas, based on or developed with
the help of a given rulebook couldn\'t be published independendly.  But
because the misuse of trademarks (one could omit them) or because of
the misuse of licence (usage only for personal matters)?

Common rumours about her fate:

      Quiet conversation with some of her peers and companions [largely 
Aslan, or humans that folow Aslan tradition] at Ilroei will result in 
these rumours...
  - she was killed in a duel due to a deadly insult she gave to a losing 
party in one of her cases back in Ranib subsector, four years ago.
  - she is being held for ransom, but the local clan chief is keeping it 
quiet
  - she has a reputation of being very difficult to fool
  - she is extremely adapt in company politics, having a \'golden\' career 
history.  She understands who to befriend, who to avoid, and how to 
massage them to her point of view
  - a local human terrorist group - perhaps the dreaded Freedom League - 
has kidnapped her.  
  - political troubles back in Ranib subsector has forced her to return 
home, but strictly incognito
  - she left to scout the Regency for new markets, but choose to do so 
alone, and without alerting her local clan chief (after all, she does 
outrank him, being a representative of the great clan chief back home)

----
 
Special knowledge - level I

  - she was born & raides in a lower-class family
  - trained as a purchaser for Ilroei\'s Consumer Products division
  - gained a reputation as an  adequate worker, but a True Master of 
    Tradition
  - eventually left the company, gaining a reputation as a professional 
    adjudicator of inter-clan financial disputes
  - obtained subsector-wide fame in 1192 by resolving a 30-year old 
    corporate dispute between two powerful clans
  - rejoined Ilroei Industrial Products in 1197
  - was proclaimed a clan elder (female: similar to a vice-president of a 
    company) in 1200

Special knowledge - level II

  - Kty[akuhois] has a very willful and hardheaded personality
  - she has a mate and seven children back on Iysewekh
  - she is the primary motivatior for her clan\'s expansion into 
    ex-Imperial space: in many ways, the Glisten project is her baby

Rumours 
  
  - she is rumoured to have been quite abusive to her personal servants 
    and those under her command
  - that her father was not merely lower-class, but actually an outcast
  - she\'s looking for *any* fault in local operations, to discredit the 
    current leadership and further her own ambition
  - that several of her most celebrated cases were actually carefully 
    arranged show trials, designed to increase her prestige among the clan 
    leadership.

Where is Hlausau\' Khyakuhois?

The first step is to realize that this is an "inside job", thai is, her 
     enemy is probably Aslan, rather than human
The second deduction is to determing that her abrasive personality, 
     ambition, and high competence would make enemies of both competitive 
     businessess and her superiors _back at Iysewekh_.  (Her skill in 
     politics has insured that the Aslans at Glisten are all "her people", 
     due to her highly astute sense of politics and judjement of 
     character.  There are a number of ways that the PC\'s may be able to 
     discover this fact)  
The third deduction is that whoever took her did not wish to kill her in 
     public.  *Why?*  A competitor would benefit more from a public duel 
     than a dishonourable kidnapping.  Indeed, they may not have killed  
     her at all.

You may leave the players to figure this out themselves - especially once 
they have the special, detailed knowledge they need to figure this out 
themselves.  Or yor may present it as a task (esp. if pressed for time) - 

      Formidable: Average of Intelligence and Education.

This task can be attempted twice a week.

----

Once the above is known, you need to figure out who among her possible 
enemies would hesitate to kill her in public.  Attempting to find her 
enemies within Ilroei Industrial Products would be - in this adventure - 
not possible.  For one thing, none of them is at Glisten, and there is 
much too little info to work on.  Even if they are at Iysewekh, the PC\'s 
know too litle about the sublties (sp) os Aslan company politics to 
understand what to do.

===========================================================================

Who has Hlausau\' Ktyakuhois?  Part II

The PC\'s *can*, however, try to find Kty\'s enemies outside the Ilroei 
company: 
           Difficult: Liaison or Research

Then, narrow the list of subjects by discussing who would prefer her to 
"dissapear" rather than either be killed, counter-attach in a non-violent 
(ie. political) manner, or simply wait for her to return to the Trojan Reach:
     
           Average: Research

>>> and the answer is...
         Ftaihkeaya Machinery, owned by the Ftaihkeaya clan of Tlaiowaha 
(Tlaiowaha: Trojan reach/1928 B1209L4-E T  411 A1 F4 D)

================================

Ftaihkeaya Machinery is in direct competition with Ilroei  in the area of 
constructiong some of the enormous pieces of gravitic machinery needed to 
suspend TL E gravitic cities in the air.

Ftai. has long been the primary supplier of this kind of equipment, but 
it\'s dominance in the field has been slowly worn away by complacency and 
the competition.  Ftai. decided to try and revitalize it\'s product line 
by setting up a TL F research office to gain new insights from Glisten 
(and nearby Regency) manufactourers.

But now, less than five years after the reasearch office was created, 
Ilroei is planning to establish a major factory in Glisten to take 
advantage of the ex-Imperial markets.  This is *very* bad news for 
Ftaihkeaya.

Then Hlausau\' Ktyakuhois herself arrived, to take command of Ilroei 
operations and turn that factory into a reality.  Thjis upset all of 
Ftai\'s plan\'s,a ndwould decisively give Ilroei the upper hand.

Moreover, Ftai. couldn\'t directly attack eith er Ktyakuhois or her 
company: as an adjudicator, she sided with Ftai. in a controversial 
ruling over copyright.  Even though she is removed from the bench, for 
Ftai. to attack her publicly would almost certianly cause Ftai. to lose a 
lot of public standing, as a company _and_ as a clan.

Thus, they originally decided to kidnap and kill her in secret, using 
human mercenaries to cloak their involvement.  However, the humans who 
kidnapped her decided to blackmail Ftai. instead.  They recieve regular 
payments of 5 MCr every six months, thru a paper company.

Ftai. Machinery is currently in a quandry.  The - so far - have decided 
not to hinder the construction of Ilroei\'s factory, so as not to draw 
attention to themselves.  They _have_ sent out two squads of trusted, 
elite clan soldiers to kill Kty and ker captors, but they are following 
empty leads in the Regency.

There are two ways that the PC\'s can get hard proof connecting Ftai. 
Machinery with Kty\'s kidnapping: follow the electronic "paper chain" 
connecting Ftai.\'s payments to the blackmailing merc\'s or ambush Ftai.\'s 
outgoing company messenger.

----

One: The email trail!

Following the email trail will eventually lead the PC\'s to the xboat 
network, and onward to Mora, the capital of the Regency.  There, the 
message is copied 50 times and sent off to destinations throughout the 
Regency, via both xboat and merchant ship\'s.  The smart PC will return to 
Glisten at this point, the stupid PC would go on a mad romp across the 
Regency like the Aslan mercenaries.   [If they meet, the Aslan\'s may 
choose to \'team up\' with the PC\'s until they find Kty, then kill both her 
and the PC\'s!  They are poor liar\'s however...]

The lucky PC will follow the copy sent to Gandr (Lunion: Spinward 
Marches/2245 E000347-8).  Gerard Winstion, an experienced money 
launderer, picks uo the money with fake ID\'s, spends a month cleaning it, 
then places 90% of it in a variety of subsector accounts, keeping 10% for 
himself.  If caught, he can be "persuaded" to lead the PC\'s directy to 
the mercenaries.  Warning: he alwars has one or two of the mercenaries 
with him, and a chartered scout with crew ready to jump.

----

Two: The Messanger ambush!

Ftaihkeaya\'s messanger can be ambushed in four places: in Ftai.\'s 
industrial/residential complex, enroute to the starport, on the Aslan 
jump4 courier ship, or at his destination at Tlaiowaha starport in the 
Trojan Reach, about 10 four-parsec jumps away.

Finding out who the messanger is and his location is a computer task, 
using the same method needed to illegally enter Oikhoiseaha\'s computers: 
just this time, the target is Ftai\'s.  Getting inside Ftai\'s complex - with 
takes up half an asteroid - is more difficult. (you PC\'s had better have at 
least a ship\'s boat: some of these asteroids they are travelling to is clear
across the system..)  About 15,000 people - 1/3 Aslan - live and work in 
the complex, and the site is guarded to peasetime *Aslan* standards, 
including 5 20-disp fighters and 3 large laser bays.  Moreover, an attempt to
forcibily board the facility will quickly run into about 1250 adult Aslan 
males and TL E-F security precausions.

If the messanger is to be ambushed in transit to the starport, the PC\'s 
would need to plan carefully to insure that they are near the Frai. 
spaceship as it transport the messanger to a waiting jump4 courier ship.  
Tey\'re so many ships near Glisten Starport that they won\'t draw suspicion 
until the\'re within 300 km\'s of the transport.  Then, they must shoot 
down the spacship\'s HEPlaR, match vectors, close with the spacecraft and 
board it in under 30 minutes.  Then they must grapb the messanger (who 
would have suicided by this time), get back to their ship, and jump out 
before the Glisten systen navy arrives in force.  Fortunately, the 
Regency doesn\'t hav an extradition treaty with the Aslan New Lords, but a 
change in ID and [very expensive, rare TL G drugs (for TL F DNA tests), 
impossible-to-legally-get] drugs to mask the PC\'s DNA pattern are 
strongly advised.

Sneaking onboard the Aslan ship as Ftai. cargo requires enterind the 
starport, somehow getting rid of the cargo of a cargo container, and 
entering it yourself.  It\'s aslo wise to put a forged ID sticker with the 
new weight on the container, and wear Vacc suits.

Once onboard, they should wait until certain that the messanger is 
onboard (ie. until they feel the shift into jump space). THEN assult the 
crew.  If successful they can bring the dead messander (or, if there 
_really_ lucky, the Low Berthed messanger) back to Ilroei, so they can 
take out the TL E computer chip in his brain (wiped after death: that\'s why 
he\'s so willing to die, if he can\'t avoid capture.) to rebuild the wiped 
information (normally a Formidable: Computer test, but in this adventure 
there\'s automatic success after 1d6 weeks).

==============
==============

Break in the adventure.
Well, that\'s all most of the detail\'s : some more to follow, then the 
Adventure Finale!

These are the twenty Denebian worlds with population codes of A
during the 1120s, from the DGP sector files.  They contained some
780 billion or so inhabitants, about 78.6 percent of Domain\'s
population of around 992.3 billion.

As an experiment, I decided to see how bad it would have been if
the Virus had gotten a chance to collapse these twenty worlds.
At the end, some guesses will be made about the size of the post-
Collapse Imperial population.

Only the steps which affect population were completed.  To get a
"average" estimate, die rolls were fixed.  All rolls of:
  d10 ==  5
  1d6 ==  3
  2d6 ==  7
  3d6 == 10
Worlds with TL from 0-8 lose no population multipliers.
Worlds with TL from 9-A lose one.
Worlds with TL from B-D lose two.
Worlds with TL from E-G lose three.

----
WHAT IF? In the Domain of Deneb.

The numbers in parentheses are in people killed.

The following six worlds are killed utterly:

Deneb/Usani   (60 billion)            Deneb sector capital.
Pikha/Zeng    (60 billion)
Lintl/Vestus  (40 billion)
Rethe/Regina  (30 billion)
Junidy/Aramis (30 billion)
Louzy/Jewell  (10 billion)

Actually, some of Junidy\'s 28 billion get a reprieve; about 14
billion citizens of Junidy are native sentients, the Lleweloly.
The environmental restrictions shouldn\'t apply to them; their
population reduction should really be figured only be tech level
reduction and done separately from the human population.  The
Lleweloly, using this system, get reduced to 5 billion.  All of
the humans die.  The calculations that follow incorrectly assume
everyone died.

These six worlds managed to stay HiPop:

Beaxon/Gulf          (86 billion)
Porozlo/Rhylanor     (10 billion)
Vincennes/Vincennes  (7 billion)
Mora/Mora            (7 billion)      Domain and sector capital.
Trin/Trin\'s Veil     (7 billion)
Neumann/Gazulin      (6 billion)

Porozlo is a twin to Earth, and suffered the least relative damage
of any of the worlds I collapsed; they lost half the population.
They are only world from the list to stay at population code A.

Beaxon was a waterworld of 90 billion.  They lost 86 billion
because of that, and even so managed to stay HiPop.

The 1139 "Rape of Trin" in the official history "only" killed 3
billion.  Average case and even best case calculations for
Trin\'s collapse are worse than this, so being in the protected
Regency must have helped.

Note that, except for Beaxon, at one percent population growth per
year, these worlds would mostly have recovered their population
losses by 1200.


The remaining eight worlds on the list were left with between
thirty and fifty million inhabitants, except for Lilad/Zeng,
which was left with only three million out of 80 billion.


In total, nearly 753 billion people died; almost 96.5% of
the original population.  (With the correction for Junidy, the
figures are 748 billion fatalities, 95.8% of total.)

Assuming this data is applicable to the Domain as a whole,
where a trillion Imperial citizens survived, without the
Quarantine less than 40 billion would have been left; 80
billion in 1202, at one percent recovery per year.

----
Applying this experiment to the "official" Imperium:

The pre-Collapse Imperium had a population of roughly 15.77
trillion, according to DGP.  Subtracting the trillion that
live in the Regency, we get 14.77 trillion.   The remaining
calculations assume that the twenty Denebian population-A
worlds can be taken as representative of the entire Imperium.
Since the number of worlds sampled is small, the following
calculations may be off.  Hopefully, the extrapolated casualty
rate is too high.

Fourteen and a quarter trillion people died just in the Imperium
in the Collapse if these numbers are representative of the whole.
Including the pre-rebellion Solomani Confederation could bring
this number as high as twenty trillion, and that just covers
Imperials and former Imperials.

Half a trillion survived in the main body of the Imperium.  Their
average tech level will be around five.  If the survivors adopt
a one percent growth rate, they can repopulate the Imperium in
just under 340 years.  Pocket empires aren\'t accounted for.

In the Regency, a trillion survived, their average tech level
around twelve, with an effective naval tech level of 15/16.

It\'s worse than you think... according to the material put out by
West End Games for the Star Wars RPG (I consider it canonical
for Star Wars because various authors of Star Wars novels have
cited the West End stuff as sources in the same breath that they
thank their liason at LucasFilms...) the "Imperial" class Star Destroyer is
1600 m. long and the Super Star Destroyer was
8000 m. long!

That gives us 9,804,200 tons displacement for the Imperial Star
Destroyer, and 17,157,000,000 tons for the Super Star Destroyer,
assuming wedge configuration.  That\'s 9.8 MILLION tons for the
Star Destroyer and 17 BILLION tons for the Super Star Destroyer,
respectively!

Internals: the Star Wars universe uses a different FTL drive
concept, more akin to Star Trek\'s warp drive than Traveller\'s
jump drive.  It is much faster -- maximum speed is limited by
how well the galaxy is mapped than anything else.  On a well-
mapped route, you can cruise from the galatic core halfway to
the rim in a few hours.  In unknown space cluttered with
navigational hazards, you can take days to travel 1 parsec.
The hyperdrive is very small, and very, very cheap by
Traveller standards.  It is not terribly reasonable to try and build
a Star Destroyer under FF&S rules using standard Trav jump
drives.

Power plants are a complete unknown, though they run larger
than the jump drives.  I\'ve seen reference to both fusion reactors
and a mysterious crystalline "power core".  Who knows?  Maybe
they use Allotropic Iron... :-)

Weaponry seems to be high-powered lasers -- combat range is
very short by TNE standards (120,000 km is considered extreme
long range for Capital Ship weaponry) -- maybe they don\'t have
gravitic focussing? :-)  The Death Star\'s weaponry is another
piece of cake entirely -- it was the product of some secret
Imperial Research Lab (read the Jedi Academy trilogy for details)
and could be anything.  The buzzwords "superphased laser"
have been tossed around -- maybe it had phasers. :-) :-)
(Interestingly, the same novels introduced the Darrian Star Trigger
in the form of an Imperial secret weapon known as the "Sun
Crusher".  Nice delivery system, too.  I want that armor for my
warships... collapsium plating, apparently).

Crew: for reference, the _Star_Wars_Imperial_Sourcebook_ lists
the crew of an Imperial SD at 37,085 crew plus 9.700 troops (the
Stormtrooper division); the crew of a SSD is 280,734 crewmen and
38,000 troops (a Stormtrooper corps).

Feasibility: 2 Death Stars are said to have nearly broken the
Imperial economy; they did divert a noticeable amount of
shipbuilding resources.  The Empire of Star Wars seems to
have *relatively* fewer shipyards capable of building Capital grade
ships than the Traveller Imperium.  It\'s strongly implied that only
a handful of worlds can build Star Destroyers, for instance. On the
other hand, the Empire has millions of worlds to draw revenues
from, compared to the Imperium\'s tens of thousands.

In any case, there are said to be 25,000 Imperial Star Destroyers
in existance, and only 4 Super Star Destoyers (of which one was
destroyed at the Battle of Endor with the 2nd Deathstar).

rules on pp 190-191 of the TNE Rulebook.  Why should
non-human aliens that may not breathe the same air or drink the
same kind of water or even like the same weather we do have
their maximum sustainable population (MSP) based on how
Earthlike the world is?  What about minor human races designed
for the worlds they live on, like the Darrians?

For easy identification while scanning pages of
UWPs (or while letting your computer do it) of worlds  inhabited by
non-humans, I have added the following Trade Codes & Remarks:

        Hw - Home World
        Ac - Alien Colony

A Home World is mostly self-explanatory, but in the case of
Ancients transplants like the Vargr and minor human races, a
world is a "Home World" for these purposes if the race is
designed or evolved to live there better than anywhere else.
For example, Darrians are designed to live very comfortably
on Darrian; it\'s a Home World.  Vilani are not especially
adapted to Vland, and can\'t even eat the local foodstuffs without
processing; Vland is NOT a Home World.

An Alien Colony is a world colonized by non-humans; the
general principle is that its MSP is based on the world\'s
simularity to the Home World\'s UWP.

Finally, note that aquatic races such as Dolphins and
Githiaskio have slightly different criteria for habitability than
we ground-pounders.

 In all cases, "native" refers to HOME WORLD statistics, and
"local" refers to the COLONY world being assessed.

----
    - If ALIEN HOME WORLD, only size mods apply when calculating MSP.
    HOME WORLD is assumed to be otherwise optimal for ALIEN race.

    - If ALIEN COLONY, caculate MSP with the following mods:

         Size:  no changes.

         Atmosphere:
            - If native atmosphere is A or higher, and local
         atmosphere is different code or composition, MSP is 0.

            - If local atmosphere two levels lower density than native
         atmosphere, mod = -2.
            - If local atmosphere has different or opposite taint than
         native atmosphere (e.g.  tainted if native is untainted or
         sulphur taint if native has nitrogen compound taint, etc),

         Hydrographics:

         - If local hydro code is 7+ lower than native, mod = -2.

Second thing:  I have written an OS/2 REXX script that will
gobble up GENIE-format sector files (or SSV-format subsector
files) and run them thru the Collapse Effects Determination Rules.
The script is loosely based on Guy Garnett\'s AmigaREXX
scripts for Hard Times mods -- I stole the sector file parsing code
and ideas for \'NUKE\' and \'SAVE\' options from them.  Also,
the addcode and stripcode scripts will work to add \'nuke\' and
\'save\' flags for the purpose of VIRUS processing as well.
I added a command-line flag for \'ALIEN\'; whether or not to
use the Alien Home World option introduced above.

 As soon as AOL puts in ftp upload capability, I will upload it
(and the RXMATHFN.DLL needed for the pow() functions)
to wherever the current software archives are these days.
In the meantime, I can e-mail VIRUS.CMD to whoever requests
it.  You\'ll have to find your own copy of RXMATHFN.DLL,
though -- it is available in most large OS/2 archives, such
as Hobbes, the Hobbes mirror in Walnut Creek\'s archives
(ftp.cdrom.com), and probably IBM\'s OS/2 archive
(software.watson.ibm.com, I think).

Applicability to non-OS/2 systems: I converted the original
ADDCODES,STRIPCODES and HARDTIME scripts from
Amiga AREXX to OS/2 REXX with a minimum of difficulty,
so it should be easy enough for you Amiga users to convert
VIRUS.CMD to ARexx.  You\'ll have to find your own way to
handle the pow() function; I can\'t help you there.

Users of mainframe or Unix REXX\'s should be able to convert
VIRUS.CMD.  DOS users, there are commercial PC REXX
implementations out there, but I don\'t know if there are any
public domain ones.  Sorry if you can\'t use it.

Oddly enough, I find that the more I learn about the Star Wars universe,
the more sense it makes -- in fact, it often makes more sense than the
CT-MT-TNE universe.  I will admit that the Star Wars visionaries are a lot
more daring than GDW about what may be developed in thousands of years

>Will someone please tell me what the hell a blaster is anyway.

In Star Wars, a blaster is a laser.  In pre-1961 scifi, it\'s any handheld
energy weapon. In sloppy TV & movie scifi, it\'s also any handheld energy
weapon.

In defense of the Stormtroopers (perish the thought!), I must point
out that young Skywalker is now known to be VERY strong in the Force.
Ever consider that someone who, with minimal training. can parry blaster
bolts with a light saber,  might also be rather hard to target by troopies
with unshielded minds?  It had to have been an untrained, subconscious
thing, but I would guess that Luke was either running where the
stormtroopers weren\'t aiming, or telepathically or telekinetically spoiling
their aim.  I vaguely recall from my pulp novel reading days that The Shadow
was pretty hard to plug at point-blank range, too.  Note also that Leia, who
was with him, is now known to be "strong in the Force" as well.

In short, don\'t try this trick with Imperial Marines -- they wear psi
shields!

Steve Bonneville recently noted that only a few people in a hundred
thousand would ever serve in the Imperial Navy (or any space navy, for that
matter...).

This simple fact should greatly change the character of the
Imperial Navy.  This implies that the Navy should be composed strictly of
*the best*, ie. perfect health, very smart, quick thinking, skilled in
physics, great looking, heros of the galaxy... imagine an entire navy of
Buck Rogers types! (I shrudder to think of it.)

This ain\'t the Navy I know and love...

But assuming that this is the case (and it _is_ the case), then this
should be the minimum UPP for...
   Enlisted 888888-8
   Officers AAAAAA-A

Please, someone prove me wrong...

    'body' => 'Hi folx,

Not much to do with TNE-Pocket, but you might be interested:
Some observations I made a couple days ago on FF&S.

There is a science and technology show on the Discovery Cable
Channel called \'The Next Step\'.  It is not my favorite by any
means, as it is more in the realm of a \'Gee Whiz!  Lookit this!\'
type show than CNN\'s \'Science & Technology Week\' and the Discovery
Channel\'s \'Beyond 2000\' and at times looks more like a music video
than coherent reporting of something new.  They tend to say \'lookit
this\' instead of \'It works this way...\'

(Unfortunately there are shows that are FAR worse than \'Next Step\'
in this regard.)

In any case, on Tuesday, they showed something that perhaps
everyone who designs vehicles and robots using Traveller\'s design
tables should look at (regardless of what system, tho this pertains
particularly to FF&S).

The story was that of the first robot war.  A public event in which
engineers designed radio controlled robots for the purpose of
running (essentually) a robot demolition derby.

There were a few rules they listed (No explosives, untethered
projectiles, acids, or lasers.  (Probably more but they didn\'t tell
us due to poor reporting)).  There was also what appeared to be a
weight classification (Light, medium, heavy?  (Again poor
reporting)).

The most fascinating thing about it was that, as this was their
first encoutner, no one knew what the opposition was going to look
like.  I saw a lot of stuff from what looked like a small radio
controlled car covered with nails like spikes to a large steel buzz
saw on wheels powered by a 300cc lawn mower engine.

There were all sorts of robots with all sorts of weapons with all
sorts of strategies involved.  Some relied on speed for defence,
others relied on armor.  Some had no offence at all.

The point of all of this was that while everyone out there was an
engineer, and had the same access to whatever technology they
wanted, they all produced VERY different designs based on what they
figured would work.

The overall winning design (I think it was, again poor reporting)
looked like it was built using an upside down galvanized steel
garbage can as a casemate.  On top of this were spinning arms that
had two spiked morning stars on the ends.

On the other hand there were some that had rams, others that tried
to flip the opponent over.  One had some sort of a spring loaded
lance in a tank turret.  One had what looked like a giant set of
vise grips.  One was made out of powered kid\'s big wheel, complete
with rider.  One had a buzz saw mounted on a turret that used (I
assume) Estes model rocket engines, for show mostly.

(I wonder about the possibility of using Estes model rocket engines
as offensive weapons.  You get close, fire and the things will act
like small blow torches or slow acting shaped charges.  Slam an big
E or F engine next to his armor and BLAM!)

Now that I think of it, a good body would be along the lines of a
kid\'s PowerWheel\'s jeep converted to radio control.  Large wheel
base, sturdy, decent battery capacity, large weight carrying
capacity for a weapon (say a gasoline powered chain saw).

Ok, now, think about what sort of design you might come up with...

Now...  Think about this:  Imagine someone from another culture
comes in with a design built on another planet.  With different
gravity, different technology, different requirements, different
evolution!  I think you\'d get a VERY different idea of what sort of
weapon might be used in a war.

Imagine the above warrior robot design based, not on an electric
powered vehicle for small human children, but say based on a
similar vehicle for small K\'kree children!

Now, FF&S was based (supposedly) on the Imperium.  But we\'ve seen
how the FF&S designs of Imperial technology don\'t always favor the
grav tanks and hand guns we are familiar with.  By my reading of
FF&S rules, the TL 11 meson body pistol that I posted when FF&S
came out is quite a legal design.  Who\'s gonna buy a TL 12 gauss
pistol when you can have a concealable meson gun in your holster
for about 2328 credits?  Who\'s gonna buy a TL 15 Fusion Gun
(FGMP-15) when you can buy a Meson Gun (MGMP-11) that does as much
damage for 2527 credits?

Armor?  What is this thing you call armor, stranger?

The point of all the above rambling is:  FF&S may or may not be
realistic in its simulation of technolgy, but I really doubt that
the best designs for weapons that can come out of it are the ones
that are what we\'ve seen for Traveller in the past.

I think it would be fascinating to see a bunch of designs come out
and see what would do best on the battle field rather than saying
"Ok, grav tanks and battle dress are the big mainstays of combat."

We already know that FF&S makes the traditional spinal mounts
useless in comparison with a spinal mounted laser!  What else is
out there?

But to get back to my original topic, I *BELIEVE* that the way the
Discovery Channel plays things is that the show on the robot arena
will be repeated on saturday afternoon at 4PM Central time.  (5 for
you EDT Yankees. :)  I strongly reccomend that the designers out
there take a look.  It was fun, and illustrates all of the above in
a REAL engineering problem that wasn\'t done on paper!

Hans\' recent WTC query reminded me of some things I was wondering
about, so consider this an open letter to Loren and GDW:

STRIKER II: (errata/clarification)

p5.  2.3 Personnel Stands,   "...(see page 00)."
            Production typo, what\'s the real page?  134?

       "Finally, these rules...single stand and crew stand."
            I take it the Double Size stands are the "crew stands."
            The description matches, but please don\'t shift terminology.

p7.  3.4 Vehicle Cards, last sentence:  "...sample vehicle unit card on
             the previous page for an example."
      The example is on the same page.

p12.  5.5 Terrain Effects and Movement.
             I know grav vehicles and grav-belted troops are counted as "flying
             vehicles" for movement purposes, but there are times when terrain
             will affect them, most obviously when moving _through_ vegetation
             rather than over it.  Some others, like buildings, would also apply
             sometimes.
             What are the movement modifiers here?

p26.  9.24 Eliminated,   "If any enemy stands are within 10 inches of it..."
        Inches?  Striker II is a metric game.  10cm? or 25.4cm?

20.3 Drop Capsule Landings.
             Thinking grav-belts again.  Would the penalties for landing in
              rough terrain or deep water apply to grav-belted troops?
             Or be reduced in their effect?



STAR VIKINGS:

I count three characters with Aslan language skill, two free trader
captains and an RCES spy (who definitely had no contact with Aslan).

Where did they learn this?


PATH OF TEARS:

How many troops does Oriflamme have on Spencer?  Page 34
"Offensive Ground Troops" first says they have "over a dozen
divisions" but just after that says Oriflamme only has "five full
combat divisions".  It really can\'t be more than a few thousand
troops, and even that assumes they patched together an old
bulk freighter to use as a troop transport.  Bringing them over
in Broadswords a platoon at a time doesn\'t really cut it ;-)
Remember they would have started this before the Auroras
would be available to be dedicated for the Spencer operation.

WORLD TAMERS HANDBOOK:  (possible spoilers for TMLers)

p108, the Hercules-class.   I ASSUME the USL configuration is
       a typo. They were streamlined in The Traveller Adventure and
       in their own operational description in WTH.

Bootstrap Mission:
       Once the "signal" is given, the text implies Holmgren will
       arrive at the landing beach in a short while, an hour or two,
       maybe.  According to the map, the beach is about 260 km
       from Kongsholm.  This is a tech 1 society, what\'s he riding?
       Shadowfax?

       I detect a slight scale problem here :-/

There are no modifiers to determine the Agricultural Capacity and
Raw Materials Capacity of sea hexes.  Does this mean no modifiers,
or that sea hexes weren\'t considered.

Fishing provides rations, as does aquaculture.

Raw materials can be found on sea beds and underground (eg. North
Sea oil).  The ability to recover and exploit these resources would
depend on tech level.

Also, for raw materials: it says there is no usable area in glacier hexes,
but again, higher-tech settlements should have some ability here.

One aspect missing: forced agriculture (hydroponics, yeast processors,
 and such).


I know the RC Bootstrap/Colony focus of WTH led to some things
(higher tech capabilities, administrative and service sectors, repressive
governments) getting the short shrift, but an expansion of these kinds
of things might be worth doing in the future.

One thing this would allow is a "realistic" design sequence for
what I call "gigastructures": arcologies, grav-cities, space habitats,
hostile-environment cities,and such.

These were randomly generated by DGP so the maps would not simply
stop at the edge of charted space.  However, they also _deleted_ the
position hex numbers so that GM\'s would not be constrained by another
"official" bit of information.

Some fanatics (myself included) have tried to match the dot locations to
hex numbers, though.  I eventually gave up on it, but others have been
more persistent.

One of the reasons I gave up was that, being randomly generated, they
don\'t neccessarily match the locations of the few worlds in the "new areas"
that we DO know the location to.

Case in point: Home, the Solomani capital.  I don\'t have it in front of me,
but find the location hex number from the world description.  Now check
the map where that hex would be, and what do you find?  The center of
a four-parsec-wide void!

Then again, it just may be SolSec playing headgames again ;-)

Also, some of the information in Reavers\' Deep doesn\'t match older
CT material.

Vilani and Vargr does this with the Vargr Extents.  A little bit of

No (see above), except for anything persistent people have created.

The FASA game was good, but the movement/actions rules system was

Why is it that we automatically seem to associate futuristic sport 
with violence, when present trends seem to indicate the opposite? 
No more punch-ups allowed in the NHL, FIFA trying to take tackling 
out of soccer, quarterbacks in the NFL wrapped up in cotton wool, 
while the fastest growing game globally is basketball, a 
non-contact sport. Have the sports marketing people got it all 
wrong in trying to project a friendly, family image; is it really 
more blood that we want?

Just a reminder:

The last time I heard, there were three types of nobles: "Honor" nobles 
(ie. a reward for excellent and honourable service), "Administrative" 
nobles (ie. a ruling subsector Duke) and "High" nobles (ie. nobles that have 
vast amounts of economic and political power).

In the Regency, Honour nobles would be pratically unchanged, 
Administrative nobles would have lost most of their powers 
(excepting...?), and High nobility will simply keep on marching.

NOTE: In Britain, the nobility had their power removed by A) expanding 
the francise B) the loss of power in Parliment C) high inheritance taxes,
eroding the basis of their power and D) the shift of the basis of wealth 
from land to capital.  These things were brought in (generally) 
via Labour governments, duly elected by the people. [I\'m relying on vague 
recall of that great book "The Decline of the British Aristocracy" by 
that widely written author Mr. Whatshisname.]  

In the Regency, A) has been done (from nothing to - I assume - every 
adult Regency citized) B) has been done (from a strictly Moot-based 
government to a "House of Commons/House of Lords" split.)

C and D, however, hasn\'t been done... and probably can\'t be done in the
Regency!
Thus, there are real limits on how much power the Regency Nobility can 
lose, *IF* they don\'t hide in an anti-democratic corner, but enter into 
hard negotiations with the democrat\'s.

Moreover, the Head of the Government remains an unelected noble, and 
*his* power remains unchanged.  Also, because the Regency is so large, 
there are real limits to what the democrat\'s can control.  And many 
of the elected rulers are actually pro-democrat nobles.

Finally, the basis of Noble power - their wealth, and tehir connection\'s 
with the Navy - remains unchanged.

Therefore, I predict that the nobility will retain much of their power, 
and furthermore may get a rebound: when the Regency decided to retake the 
rest of the Imperium, it\'s quite likely that Noble Rule will turn out to 
be the best way to rule the barbarians of the Wilds.

Could someone here email me a list of current Traveller fanzines, esp. 
HIWG? (yes, I know it was posted a while ago...)

Perhaps this list can be posted, and kept at a ftp site somewhere.

Thank you.

I think the reason for this is due more to the nature of many science
fiction writing than anything else.  Many classical science fiction
movies tend to take place in a post holocost environment.  Why this 
is so is another topic, but now that the \'cold war\' ended without an
atomic war, I think even this trend too will die out.

For a good example of your argument, there was an epsiode in the old
Buck Rodgers TV series of the 70\'s.  The olympics had been to weakened
that even boxing was a sport done where force gloves scored "hits" on
the opponent, much like fencing does today.  In fact the only way the
boxer could hurt himself was if he tripped.

On the other hand, there may be a counter trend in your argument.  One
reason that soprts are getting less violent today is the cost factor.
When major leagues are paying billions for their "players" then injury
becomes a serious financial drain.  Should the tables reverse and owners
get the ability to hire players for cheep cash, I fear this trend may
reverse, as senor players might eventually earn so much money that they
would get replaced by younger players, through attirition or injury.

There will always be a market for "blood and guts" and "right and wrong".
Fornately the movie industry, soap operas and professional wrestling are
more than adequate in fufilling that market.

"next week on Imperium Wide Wrestling \'Mr Imperium\' takes on the evil
and masked \'Mr Virus\' in a cage - grudge match with the new and improved
plasma rifles."

Now, the final portion of my Glisten adventure...


==============================================================================
<Swelling theme song...>

The PC\'s may try to ambush a Fiat. messanger *after* he arrives at Tlaiowaha
[ie. get there by their own (hopefully faster) ship, or find out his 
schedule and be there, waiting for him].  

They should berth their ship, and wait until Ftai.\'s courier ship has 
arrives and is ready to disembark the messanger.  Then the PC\'s need to 
grab the messanger, get back to their ship, and jump while their ship is 
still on the tarmac (they dare not try to lift out: if the starport\'s 
defenses doesn\'t nail them, the local SDB fleet will!)

Because of the Heirate\'s political climate and clan structure, the only 
military they need to fear is the Ftai. clan - who can afford to send 14 
500-disp TL C-E warships after them.  Since the Ftai. need to block off 
escape routes and search systems, it\'s highly unlikely that the PC\'s will 
encounter more than two ships at any one system:

Roll 2d6 for encountering a Ftai. warship while running to Glisten: 

the first half of the journey:
2-6 none   7-8 one ship    9-11 two ships   12 three ships
the last half of the journey:
2-4 none   5-7 one ship    8-10 two ships   11-12 three ships

[reminder: Tlaiowaha is about 10 for-parsec jumps away from Glisten.

However, at Glisten the PC\'s will be given a break - assuming that they 
have chosen to jump near the Ilroei complex at Sarodon Asteroid rahter 
than to Glisten Starport, that is.  Otherwise, expect major red tape, or 
a final last attack by two Ftai. ship\'s.

======+++++=====+++++=====+++++=====+++++=====+++++=====+++++=====+++++

Entering Nightnoise

Both the information from the mercenary money launderer and the info on 
the biochip in the dead Aslan Messanger\'s skull agree that the merc\'s 
hired to kidnap Hlausau\' Ktyakuhois were the Aao Le-Tik group, based from 
Glisten.  A few hours at a human merc watering hole (Average: Streetwise 
- Easy if the human is a Merc himself) will inform the PC\'s that the Aao 
Le-Tik is a squad of about 20 members, of only average fighting ability 
but imaginative when it comes to ruses, bluffs and deception.  
Originally formed to fight Glisten\'s occupation, they eventually became 
discuraged and chose to sell their services to the highest bidder instead.

Both sources also agree that the original place where Kty. was held was 
in an abandoned city on Nightnoise, an asteroid in Glisten\'s orbit 3, 
outside of Glisten\'s two asteroid belts.  The Ftai. message says that the 
Aao Le-Tik abandoned the site when they sent the blackmail message, and 
their jumpship was found abandoned at Trin.

Winston - the (possibily) captured launderer - insists that the jumpship 
was a ruse, and the mercenaries hid themselfves in the city until the Ftai.
search team left.  

If Winston isn\'t with the PC\'s, but they did get the biochip, either 
they or (if the players are rather thick) the aslan\'s should decide to go to 
Nightnoise to see if any clues remain on the Merc\'s whereabouts.

Two weeks later, the PC\'s - along with Winston (if they somehow found 
him), and 80 Aslan technicians, investigators and troops - heads for 
Nightnoise on a 1000-disp charted fusion-drive spaceship.  They bring 
enough equipment to last the expedition three months, along with 20 Aslan 
grav bikes.

The Aslan transport spends days disembarking people and equipment, then 
leaves, to return in three months.  The expedition finds itself in an 
artifical cavern, it\'s roof open to raw space, formerly a F-class port. 
The expedition presses down a corridor, it\'s mobile powerplant providing 
the energy needed to power air locks and iris valves.

The dead city of Tanenbaum is completely dark - no power, nolights, no 
gravity, no breathable air.  Four hundred years ago, Tanenbaum\'s lax 
safety regulations finally caught up with it, resulting in a massive 
city-wide plase that rendered it uninhabitable and killed 92% of it\'s 
155,000 inhibatants.

Today, charred skeletions and melted furniture litter the residental 
areas of the city.  The air is full of carbom monoxide and old toxic 
fumes from the fire, and occassionally the zero-G soot (floating in round 
clumps in the air) is broken up, impeding vision.

The party pressess forward, to where the biochip/Winston says Kty was 
first held.  A recently-built, makeshift  airlock is opened mechanically, 
and the party enters - one at a time - into breathable atmosphere.  The 
modern light-switches work, displaying a hallway leading to eight rooms.  
The place is furnished with cheap steel furniture, adapted for a zero-G 
enviroment.  There is no computer, memchip\'s or paper to be found.

Even a careful, 3-day search will only show that Humans and Aslans were 
here within the past two years.

++++++++++++++++

If the party doesn\'t have Winston to guide them, they must divide up the 
city and search every section for sign\'s of continued habitation.  If 
Tanenbaum is divided up into 10 equal sections (The Aslans obtained a 
500-year-old electronic data of the city from the Glisten archives before 
leaving) it will take one month to search a single section. There is a 
10% chance that they\'re searching the right section, and for the group to 
find the right signs [ie. an increase in background heat, detection of 
unaccounted-for electric fields, recent footprints and handprints) is a 
test of 

Difficult: Observation 
(assume group observation asset is 10) 
..once per month.

If the party finds nothing after three months, the leader of the Aslans 
will argue to leave.  The PC\'s may agree, and abandon the site [and, 
unknowingly, the 42 MCr].  If not, they can argue that the party be 
resupplied (Formidable: Persuasion), increased to 200 searchers, w/ 
additional equipment (Impossible: Persuasion.  Success here will decrease 
searching difficulity to Average), or be left with a skeletion crew to 
continue the search (Difficult: Persuasion.  Success here will increase 
difficulty to Impossible: Observation)

If they\'re smart, they can elect to watch Nightnoise from their ship for 
any sign\'s of activity.  With simple patience, they will spot a 100-Disp 
unarmed spaceship, landing on the asteroid some distance from the old 
spaceport. (in 1d6 weeks.)  This freighter is carrying supplies to the 
merc\'s in the city, and is landing near a abandoned air lock to transport 
supplies.

++++++++++++++++++++

If they find the "Neighbourhood" where the merc\'s are holding Kty, they 
can plan out a strike team.  However they do it, they should remember to 
enter the merc\'s territory thru an airlock, to perserve the atmosphere 
for the hostage\'s sake (if they feel that she\'s still alive).

Of the 80 Aslans, 30 are female, with spacesuits (AV1) and two 9mm magnum 
                  revolvers each (Experienced)

                  40 are male Aslans, with Combat Armour-10 (AV 2/1), 4 
                  Grenades (C:3 B:12), and 1 ACR-10 (Veteran)

                  10 are Male Aslans with Combat Armour-12 (AV3/2), 4 
                  Grenades, and one Plasma Rifle-12 (Elite)

The Aslan females will avoid the heat of battle, but will fight if pressed.

Four Veteran Aslan\'s are demo experts: each have 6 kg of plastic 
explosive and 10 blasting caps.

Twenty Aslan will get grav bikes: their bikes carry extra ammo and 
another 6-hour air tank.

-- -- -- -- -- -- --

Of the 22 Aao Le-Tik mercenaries, 17 are in Tanenbaum (two were with the 
money launderor, one is on Glisten, two are on the 100-Disp resupply 
freighter)

Because of closed-circut TV, Jeho Markinov, the commander of the Aao 
Le-Tik, will immediately be aware if the PC\'s or the Aslan\'s enter the 
Merc\'s territory.

As soon as he sees that they\'re coming, he\'ll order a fighting retreat to 
the merc\'s air lock.  Ordering Kty into a rescue ball, Markinov will 
activate the 25 pre-set tripwire mines, send an emergency call to his 
man at Glisten (which will tell him what\'s happened, and to take 
certain actions), destroy the vital circutry of his command post with a 
blast of his plasma gun (so his cameras and sensors can\'t be used against 
him), and head out to the well-camoflagued escape ship near the merc air 
lock.

The merc\'s have endlessly drilled for this action, using VR and the 
anciend electronic maps of Tanenbaum for pratice.  They will split into 
two fire groups, and one hostage group: 

Fire group 1: 1 Elite, 3 Vet\'s, 2 Experienced, 1 LMG, 10 mines
           2: 1 Elite, 3 Vet\'s, 2 Experienced, 1 LMG, 10 mines
Hostage:   Markinov, 1 Elite, 1 Experienced, 1 Hostage

..the mines (C:5, B:24) are set by physical tripwire, impossible to see
   (but infrared may pick it up).  Twelve turns must be spend to set them 
   up in a hidden spot, four turns if left visible.

..the LMG\'s are TL7, w/Bipod, using ball ammo

The Merc\'s...

Markinov (Init 6: you will kave to develop his skill set) 
  Battle-Dress-10, 1 Pasma Gun-14, 4 smoke grenader, 4 regular grenades

3 Merc\'s with Combat Armour-12 (AV 3/2), 1 Autogun, one plasma Rifle-12, 
  4 smoke grenades, 4 regular grenades (Elite)

6 Merc\'s with Combat Armour-10 (AV 2/1), one Plasma Rifle-12, 4 
  Grenades (Veteran)

5 Merc\'s with Spacesuits (AV 1) w/Chest-Armour-10 (AV 2), one plasma Rifle-12
  (Experienced)

2 Merc\'s as above, but also with a one-shot Plasma Bazooka-10 (Experienced)

++++++++++++++++++++

The Merc\'s will treat the city like a three-dimensional maze.  Their 
planned route will avoid open spaces and large rooms, but dwell in 
corridors and maintenance shafts.  Whever possible, they willa ttempt to 
shake their pursuers by using unexpected tactics, surprise, and superior 
knowledge of the city layout.  If they can draw out and isolate an enemy 
squad, they will do a brief offensive and attempt to kill it, or at least 
keep their head down with suppression fire.  Again when possible, the 
fire groups will try to cover each other.

The first hour of the conflict will occur in the merc\'s breathable area.  
Sometime after this, the merc\'s will blow a hole in the wall, venting in 
bad air.  While the Expedition is busy ramming on their helmets, the 
prepared merc\'s will burn rubber.

+++++++++++++++++++++

The Aslan commander will attempt to herd the merc\'s into dead ends and 
killing zones.  Five vet\'s will be left behind to guard the females: 20 
Vet\'s and five elites will chase the merc\'s, while 5 elites and 15 Vet\'s 
- all on grav bikes - will either steer the merc\'s into a dead end, 
prepare a cross-fire killing zone, or try to block their escape route.

The PC\'s should be careful regarding combat.  If their weaponry and 
armour is not up to a plasma-gun firefight, they should stay in the rear 
with the Aslan females.  If they insist on joinin gin the fun, they 
shouldn\'t seperate from the main chase group: as humans, any Aslan trhey 
surprise may asume that they\'re merc\'s for a cxombat turn.  Shared radio 
frequency\'s will quickly dissapate the confustion, but large holes in the 
PC\'s chest may appear in the meantime.

++++++++++++++

Capture

Battle should be played out in two scales: generic map\'s for the PC\'s 
(but remember the 3-D nature of the conflict!), and an abstract system 
for the entire battle,

The battle is limited to 6 hours - this is how long the merc\'s have until 
their air supply run\'s out.  If they don\'t make it to the escape ship in 
time, they surrender.  If the PC\'s air hits bingo level (ie. the level 
they need to get back to base and recharge their air supply) they *MUST* 
immediately retreat back to the Aslan females, and their mobile air 
refresher.

If the Merc\'s make good time, the merc\'s can reach their escape ship - 
a Ship\'s Boat - in about 4 hours.  If the PC\'s alert the authorities, the 
Boat can easily be halted by Glisten\'s Navy before it can reach the 
Starport.  If not, the Merc\'s escape: about 6 month\'s later Kty is 
realeased, for 42 MCr.

If Markinov is trapped like a rat, he\'ll surrender, relying on Aslan 
belief\'s onnot killing prisoners to protect him.  If he realises that the 
Aslan\'s who trapped him are from the Oikhoiseaha clan, he\'ll bargain: 
Kty\'s life for the merc\'s escape.  The Aslan leader will agree, and let 
him and his men go: they will send an assassin (or the PC\'s!) to 
terminate him later.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Rewards

If fully successful, the PC\'s get their 43 MCr three bi-monthly installments.

They also gain the favour of an up-and-coming clan and a respected, 
powerful Aslan female clan lord.

If they find the merc\'s, but Kty dies in the firefight, they just get 
the money.

Since much of Ktyakuhois\' plans involve expanding into ex-Imperial space 
-- especially the systems of Glisten, Albe (Sindal: Trojan Reach/2211 
A540A98-E De Hi In Po 213 As F4V M2D), and Tobia (Tobia: Trojan 
Reach/3215 A444A55-F In Hi 203 As F7D) -- she is likely to find plenty of 
use for the PC\'s.  However, if they want to climb to the to pf the ladder 
as trusted servants they must join the clan and adopt Aslan Ways, 
renouncing Regency citizenship.

Hlausau\' Ktyakuhois   6.5 terms   - 1 term purchaser
                                  - 5.5 terms adjudicator
867958-B                          - 1 term administrator

Epilogue - PC\'s can join with Kty
         - how do PC\'s spend their money?
         - characters can be retired, if the players want to
         -   "   "     "  "  enhansed (ie. more education, cyberware, 
           hardware).  After a while, their patrons who hire them will 
           start to give them especially tough jobs
         - PC\'s can expand - ie. go into a business venture, or build
           their own Merc. unit
         - PC\'s can buy a starship, new or used (increased wear = decrased

I finally ftp\'ed to ghost.cc.missouri.edu. Going to PUB/Traveller/HIWG, I 
discovered a new set of (copywrited!) UWP tables for the four sectors in 
the Regency of Deneb.  If you want all to see *all* the New Era changes 
to our favourate piece of charted space, go for a visit: this post is for 
Steve Bonneville, who\'s always playing with the Pop-level A worlds of the 
Regency.

All information below was typed in: although errors have been found and 
corrected, undiscovered typing errors may still exist.  However, there 
*are* pop-"B" systems, and there *are* "B" & "W" zoned systems.

Note: The Regency has regained all territory lost to the Aslan\'s during 
the Rebellion period.  (Three cheers for Tobia!)  

All primary "D" stars have been changed to "V".

And the _Gazelle_ close escorts should probably be USL, not SL.  I
vaguely recall that part of the point of the _Fiery_ close escorts
was that they were streamlined _Gazelle_ CEs.  (Maybe someone out
there decided that the _Gazelle_ design really was too bizarre for

They\'ll need them, too.  What Cynthia doesn\'t mention is that
a fifty-kilometer diameter Death Star displaces something like
four and two-thirds TRILLION displacement-tons, dwarfing even
the Super Star Destroyers!

I know of two large Third Imperial structures off-hand:

* The one-kilometer sphere of the gravitic/repulsor lifted
  Imperial Palace that Arbellatra built; that would be about
  37 million displacement tons.

* The Limii Orbital port at Theton/Theton, Vland, which was
  a sphere 1675 meters in diameter, and had over 300,000
  permanent residents.  That would be about 175 million
  displacement tons.  The text said it was big enough for
  a class-A high port, so static structures this big are
  probably not too uncommon.   (from DGP\'s _Flaming Eye_)

Well, that\'s pretty close to the impression I got.

"Honor" nobles got awards for achievement or service, in social standings
from B to D.  The British examples I like using to show what this would
mean are Sir Isaac Newton, Sir Alec Guinness, and Viscount Montgomery;
scientific achievement, artistic merit, and military success.  But these
go further than that in that they are hereditary, even knighthoods, in
most cases.  Honor nobles are celebrities in their field of endeavor.

"Rank" nobles are often for Imperial bureaucrats.  The Imperium requires
high-level bureaucrats to be nobles.  So often when promoted to a specific
job, they get a title, which they are then allowed to use even after they
retire.  The title isn\'t hereditary; they\'re "life peers", but they still
sit in the Moot.  Imperial justices, high-ranking bureaucrats in the 
various Ministries, planetary consuls, and flag officers with certain jobs
get these titles.  These are also used for governors of areas without a
formal representation -- I suppose that means interdicted worlds and
reservations.  Sometimes,  hereditary knighthoods and baronies are given
to local families to represent the Imperium in regions where rule by
high nobles isn\'t as welcome; I\'d think there might be a fair bit of
this in culturally Solomani regions.

"High" nobles are people like Archduke Norris, Duchess Elane of Mora,
and Marquis Leonard Bolden-Tukera.  Families with vast political
and economic power, directly administrating Imperial territories in
the name of the Emperor.  Don\'t confuse the territory they are 
administering with their "fief", which is territory owned directly
by the Emperor but placed in the stewardship of the noble as a source
of income.  For instance, Norris, as Archduke Deneb, administers the
Domain of Deneb, and archdukes normally rate a fief of an entire 
world, usually held as a reservation.  As Duke Regina, he administered
Regina subsector and held a fief of not more than ten million hectares,
which he could lease, rent, or use as he saw fit, but could not sell.
Norris gets the profits, and Norris pays the bills.  These titles
are hardly ever handed out; they go for exceptional military success,
unbelieveable economic assistance to the Realm, and other expressions
of personal loyalty to the Crown.

Another thing to note is that immediate family of title holders are
in most peerages in the Imperium treated with the same protocols as
the title holder.  However, the powers of the title, if any, are only
wielded by the title holder.

As for the other points, I think I\'m willing to wait and see what
exactly is going on in the Regency before saying anything on the
future of the nobility in the democratic reforms, since the rule
book was fairly vague on exactly what the deal is.

(5) The Tech Advance step incorporates some of my prejudices
about technological advance (many of which prejudices I owe
to James Burke\'s excellent series, "Connections").  Assumptions:
more time equals more chances to advance; more people equals
more innovators; a higher initial TL means a more advanced and 
larger body of knowledge to start with, and better communications
between people with ideas to implement.  As for governments,
Balkanization means competition between nations and a higher
chance of vast government budgets being thrown into research.
Otherwise, the more a particular kind of government depends on
clinging to the "status quo", the less chance of technological 
advancement.  It\'s hard to get to starships if the priests burn at
the stake anyone inventing gunpowder...  Contrariwise, total 
anarchy tends to discourage the infrastructures conducive to
innovation -- reliable communications channels, effective
education, some reward for innovation, etc.

I treat law level as also indicating the culture\'s dedication to 
maintaining the "status quo".  The higher the law level and the
more repressive the government, of whatever type, the more
likely they are to thwart any developments that would "rock 
the boat" or at least tax/regulate it to death.

Finally, the particular cause of the Alternate Collapse (the
change in the laws of physics affecting gravitic tech) means 
that pre-Collapse gravitic science is worse than useless: it is
very misleading and will send scientists off into a blind alley 
that may take centuries to recover from.  An intact pre-Collapse
base is more likely to have recoverable pre-Collapse science
and engineering information, to the detriment of technological
advancement.

(6) TL mods to MSP are loosely based on TL effects on agricultural
productivity as per World Tamer\'s Handbook.

(7)  Starports: if a world\'s technology did not decline over the last
700 years, and they had the technology to support a starport in
the first place, I think they could have repaired any damage to the
starport by now, or even built it up some more.

TL and population requirements were added because of the loss
of interstellar trade and most of interstellar technology.  A world
now has to be capable of supporting a starport on its own; it can
no longer depend on parts shipped from a nearby high-tech, high
pop world.  At TL 9, a world can build jump drives; at TL 7 it can
build decent rockets and spacecraft; at TL 5, they can manage
alloys and basic electronics (tubes); at TL 4 they can manage
welding and working decent steels.

(8) It\'s been 700 years.  How many 700-year old military bases
do you know of still operational? (Okay, there\'s the Kremlin...)
Any functional civilization should have its own, new, military bases,
however.

And that\'s it.

Uh... I\'ve been here ever since the new TML out of mpgn.com started up.
Mostly lurking, but every now and then, I throw something out.  Didn\'t you
see "An Alternate Vision"?  That was my most recent MAJOR post/thread
prior to this latest thing.  I joined up because I like the TNE ruleset in
spite
of the Virus background.  I\'m working out an alternate history for our
(Higginbothams and Friends of the Alliance) campaign.  I wanted a collapse,
just not the Viral-induced Short Nap; I think that explorations from small
cluster states and conflicts between them are much more interesting than the
vast, impersonal 3rd Imperium with its stagnant, thoroughly explored borders.
Look at FASA\'s old Far Frontiers material (the Sky Raiders trilogy, Rescue
on Galatea, Ordeal by Eshaar, etc) for the kind of environment I find
interesting.

The alternatives, to me, were (1) use the Long Night, which is exactly that
kind
of environment, or (2) collapse the Imperium into a 2nd Long Night.  I chose
the later as it allows me to write my own history.  The details of the Long
Night(1) 
are mutable, but the outcome is set: the Sylean Federation conquers its
neighbors and goes on to form the 3rd Imperium.  Just personal preference.

>and even [gasp!] contribute to

What foul calumny! Slander! Libel!  Infamous churl, to imply such a thing!
:-)
VIRUS.CMD and the alien homeworld optional rule are a simplification of 
a modification to the "Collapse Determination Effects" rules that I drew up
to implement my "Alternate Vision" Collapse.  Since I had already done the
work, I went ahead and made a stripped down, "by the book" version of 
the REXX script that would be useful to those of you using the "standard"
Virus 
background.

Yes, there is a REXX script for implementing the Alternate Collapse on
your sector files.  See next post by me.

Alternate Collapse Effects Determination

Based on "Collapse Effects Determination", pp 190-191 of TNE Rulebook 
with the following modifications:

Step 1) Calculate Maximum Sustainable Population (MSP)     normally, except
for ALIEN HOME WORLDS and ALIEN 
    COLONIES.  "Alien" here  means all non-humans and any 
    heavily altered minor human races  

(Referee\'s discretion).  "Home World" means the world where the 
    Alien race EVOLVED; e.g.  Kushyu for the Aslan, Darrian for 
    Darrians.  All Terra-evolved races (major human races, Vargr, 
    uplifted races) should use the normal mods, but note the special 
    Hydrographics mods below for aquatic races when applying 
    MSP to Dolphins.  "Colony" means a world settled by the Alien 
    race.  In  alll cases, "native" refers to HOME WORLD statistics, 
    and "local"  refers to the COLONY world being assessed.  

    - If ALIEN HOME WORLD, only size mods apply when calculating MSP.  
    HOME WORLD is assumed to be otherwise optimal for ALIEN race.  

    - If ALIEN COLONY, caculate MSP with the following mods:

         Size:  no changes.

         Atmosphere:  
            - If native atmosphere is A or higher, and local
         atmosphere is different code or composition, MSP is 0.
            - If local atmosphere is one level lower density or two
         levels higher than native atmosphere, mod = -1.
            - If local atmosphere two levels lower density than native
         atmosphere, mod = -2.  
            - If local atmosphere has different or opposite taint than
         native atmosphere (e.g.  tainted if native is untainted or 
         sulphur taint if native has nitrogen compound taint, etc), 
         mod = -1.  

         Hydrographics:  
         Special case:  aquatic race 
            Hydro 3,4 :  mod = -1
            Hydro 1,2 :  mod = -2
            Hydro 0 :  uninhabitable (MSP is 0)

         Otherwise, 
         - If local hydro code is 3+ higher OR 5+ lower than
         native hydro code, mod = -1.
         - If local hydro code is 7+ lower than native, mod = -2.  

Step 2) Tech Decline
    - If Pre-Collapse Tech Level was 0-8, and HOME WORLD, or 
    ISOLATED/INTERDICTED WORLD, there is NO decline, and 
    Tech Advance (Step 2A) should be checked for.
    - Otherwise, check for Tech Decline normally, with the following 
    modifications to the table:  
        B-C             2d6
        D+              7+2d6

Steps 3&4) Calculate normally.
Step 9) Do Population Recovery step NOW.
    Grow population since Collapse to max of MSP at 
    (MSP * 0.15% + 0.5%) per year (or any more realistic growth

Step 7&8) Do now: reroll Post-Collapse Gov and Law based on 
    new Pop Code.

Step 2A) Tech Advance : only check if sent here by modified Step 
    2 above.
    - Roll 1d3 + the following mods for number of TLs to advance; 
    treat results < 0 as 0. 

    Time Since Collapse             Pre-Collapse TL

    Pop A           +2              all others      0

                                    *cumulative with other gov mods.

    Post-Collapse Law Code:         +(6-Law)/4, drop fractions
    Intact Pre-Collapse Era Base:   -4

    - Special case:  Balkanized worlds.  
        (1) Quick method:  assume most of population is part of one
    government.  Determine that government type and use its 
    modifier plus Gov 7 mod with world pop code mod.
        (2) Detail method:  determine government type and population
    for each nation.  Calculate TL independently for each nation 
    based on individual Gov and Pop mods plus Gov 7 mod. 
    Assign the highest resulting TL to world, as technology will 
    rapidly filter out to rest of the nations.  Reserve a few items of 
    top TL to high TL nation as "Military secrets".

Step 2B) Modify MSP. After final Post-Collapse TL is determined, 
    modify the MSP as follows:  

    TL 0-2 : MSP - 1
    TL A-F : MSP + 1

Step 5) Starport
    - Calculate starport decline as normal, except that No TL decline 
    means No Starport decline.
    - If new starport or spaceport quality does not meet the following 
    guidelines, lower starport or spaceport quality until it does.  
 
        A : minimum TL 9, minimum Pop 4
        B : minimum TL 7, minimum Pop 4
        C : minimum TL 5, minimum Pop 3
        D,F,G : minimum TL 4, at least 1 person
        E,H : no minimum TL, at least 1 person
        X,Y : no minimums

    - If Tech Level has advanced, check for Starport Improvement.  
    Roll 1d6.  If result is less than TL advance, starport improves 2 
    facility levels, providing TL and Pop minimums are met.  If result 
    equals TL advance, starport improves 1 facility level (providing 
    TL and Pop minimums are met), otherwise it stays at 
    Pre-Collapse level.

Step 6) Bases
    - All pre-Collapse Era bases are ruins, at best.  Check survival 
    only if necessary for Tech Advance Check, or if you wish to 
    distinguish excavatable ruins from glass-lined craters.  
    - Reroll Base Check, checking for Post-Collapse non-Imperial 
    military bases using new starport.

(1) The reasons behind the Alien Homeworld rule should be
obvious.  The TNE rules seem to assume humans or other races
that prefer Earth-like worlds when calculating Maximum Sustainable
Population (MSP) and that is ridiculous when considering
methane-breathing nightmares from iceball worlds.  There is also
no consideration of aquatic races: Humans may survive on a 
Hydrographics 1 or 0 world, but Dolphins are going to have a 
hard time of it.  Conversely, Hydro A worlds should be more 
habitable, not less for races like Dolphins and Githaskio.

Referee\'s discretion will still be necessary: the rules don\'t reflect
the odd races that can live comfortably in a very wide range of
environments, such as the H\'hkaar, or races very sensitive to 
minute changes in their environment, such as Ael Yel.

(2) In the Alternate Vision, the Collapse was caused by a 
combination of war (Hard Times), sudden rearrangement of
trade routes (two supernovas) and the instaneous failure of
all gravitic technology (??).  In our universe, we have assumed
that the sudden jump in fusion plant efficiency at TL 13 under
MegaT technology was due to gravitic fields replacing magnetic
fields in the standard "Tokamac" style fusion plant.  Thus the 
severe tech drop at TL 13 and above -- all power plants, all
transportation, and many dependent techonologies are 
irrepairably dead.

Low tech isolated/interdicted or "native" worlds are assumed to
have their own pre-gravitic technological base, and a more-or-less
self-sustaining economy, and be less affected by the loss of
gravitic technology and interstellar trade.  In fact, now that they 
are not being held down by the heavy hand of the Imperial
Megacorporations, they may be able to advance in technology
over the 700-odd years of the Collapse.

(3) Use the growth equation of your choice.  I assume that more
hospitable worlds will grow faster.

(4) 700 years later, these might as well be new worlds.  So you
might as well re-roll government and law level from scratch.

Basically, yeah. Gazelle is streamlined and can go

This once provided me with a really cute plot twist: one of the 
characters in my \'Dentus\' campaign, a bureaucrat named Strudekin 
Bellakar IV (his most prized possesion was an ancestral fountain 
pen!) become "Sir" Strudekin when he was appointed acting governor of 
Dentus. He even managed to declare war on the Vargr raiders who took 
the system at the start of the rebellion (Dentus is on the old 
imperial frontier coreward of Regina, pop 1/2 million anarchy), just 
before the scout base in the system was nuked to dust 8-()

Anyway, Jim, who was playing Strudekin was much more interested in 
being an officious pen-pusher than anything else so it gave a real 
depth to the character! In fact the whole game was made by the fact 
that the players spent a lot of their time talking to each other in 
character and finding out each others dark secrets :-) I didn\'t even 
get to hear half of it but it gave me plenty of time to deal with 
players individually.

I got worried there was a bad typo here, but a close look at page 34
of _Path of Tears_ read something like this: 

Under "Defensive Forces", the table in column one indicates that Oriflamme 
has 56 "division equivalents" of ground troops; they aren\'t necessarily 
arranged into fifty six divisions.  Technically, Army units can be used
for off-world operations, and 12 Oriflamme Army divisions are being used
that way on Spencer.  Five more of those fifty-six "division equivalents" are
Oriflammen Marines, and are trained to operate routinely off-world.  They\'re
too useful to tie up on Spencer in a garrison.  The rest of the ground
troops are still on Oriflamme, I guess.

Furthermore, the RC as an interstellar government maintains another Marine
brigade (Spearhead Brigade) of five battalions made up of volunteers from 
those five Oriflammen Marine divisions, as part of the three-brigade RCMC.
The name suggests that Oriflammen Marines are used to being "spearhead"
troops for some force which is following them, like Army units.  The Third 
Imperium used to do that.

As for the jump-3 spacelift capability of Oriflammen, that\'s a bigger
problem, but _Path of Tears_ does note that the planetary governments 
do own a fair number of hulls not listed with the hulls owned directly by 
the RC.  Maybe they have (or had) enough to do it.  They have adequate 
access to space to have five trained Marine divisions, after all.  
Maybe it\'s less plausible, but at least it isn\'t a typo!

Actually, many cargo ships are equiped with passenger cabins, including 
ships over fifty years old.  If one looks at East Asia island chains, 
especially the Phillipines, you\'ll find lots of ferries of rather ancient 
vintage.

Merchant ships over 100 years old are not uncommon, even in non-Third
World countries.  A friend of mine is writing a history of the Danish
Merchant Marine.  In a search of the active list of ships in 1920, he
found that 7% were over 100 years old, with some hulls from the 1770s(!)
that had been converted to steam. 

Even airplanes can survive for many years - there are thirty year old 
jets still flying, and DC-3s from the 1930s still in routine service.

Given the high price of starships and the relative technological 
stability of the Imperium, I would not be surprised to see very old 
starships in service.  They would be most common on frontiers and on runs 
between backwater systems.  

Of course, 700 years would probably be right out.  :-)

Portsmouth has been used as a naval base by Britain since the 1500s. 
Continuously. Through a variety of TL changes. Chatham has also been used 
for a long while. Note that the individual buildings change, but the sites 
are dictated by the harbors colocated with the bases (fluctuations with 
the size of forces, etc.)

Various Roman legions stayed in position for a couple centuries at a 
clip, usually in the same base. They sometimes built a new camp nearby 
when a site became to worn to use.

Spanish military archives are known to back to the 1500s, though the 
archive buildings themselves change every few centuries.

Assuming reasonably stable technology, and stable strategic needs, it 
probably continues to be more cost effective to reuse a military base, 
refurbishing it or updating its technology from time to time, than to 
abandon it and move elsewhere.

OTH, the US Arny kept several frontier forts as military sites long after 
their original purpose had ended: Ft Huachuaca (sic) in Arizona stopped 
being a necessary Apache watch post by 1890, but it still operates. Its 
function has changed over time, its facilities upgraded to suit the needs 
of the function.

When I first looked at this, I thought "no problem, probability will take
care of this."  If we assume that average Imperial citizens are generated
just like player characters (a stretch, but why not), then one out of
7,776 citizens is officer material (AAAAAA or better), in classic
Traveller anyway.  In an Imperium of 15 Trillion, that means almost 2
billion potential officers.  If we assume a uniform age distribution from
ages 1 to 70 (rather conservative), that\'s about 27 million new officers a
year.  At twenty years of service each (probably a bit generous given the
re-enlistment rolls), that\'s about a half-billion potential officers for the 
Imperical fleet. 

The one flaw I see is that character generation gives too many nobles -
one out of six, actually, which is the chance of throwing 10+ on 2d6. 
Unless the Imperium is a much differnt place than I thought it was, a lot
less than one-sixth of the population is noble.  If we eliminate the A
social class requirement, then we have an officer pool of over three
billion.  Is that enough?  You tell me.

Frankly, in Classic Traveller, every naval officer should be BBBBBB or 
better - we\'re talking studly. 

Note that in the New Era the requirement for officers would be more like
999999-9, since the way stats are rolled up is different (2d6-1) plus
there\'s seven stats instead of six.  A New Era Character with stats of
AAAAAA-A or better is literally one in a million (actually one in 35.8
million).  If the Regency population is one trillion, there are less than
30,000 folks that good - not enough officers, I think.  If we eliminate
social status, that\'s about 350,000 people, probably plenty.   Stats of 
all 9s or better gives a character that\'s one out of 46,656 - there would 
be over 20 million of them in the Regency.

So, offhand I\'d say the navy could be pretty picky, especially about 
enlisted men, as long as you come from a BIG political grouping.  
AAAAAA-A may be a bit too high, however.  It\'s certainly too high for a 
pocket empire or the RC.

This may be why big empires can last so long even when faced with
barbarians on their border.  With such a big population, they can skim off
the cream of their population for the military and fight the barbarians
with very competant people.  When competant people no longer go into the
military, empires fall.

 I wish I could answer them all immediately, but there\'s this
 little thing called time that prevents me from doing everything

 don\'t know everything yet, and have to refer some questions to

 Unless I\'m misremembering, events such as this have been going

 The main difference seems to be that the stuff wasn\'t always

Believe it or else, Rob, the fact that there are ANY hints of non-combat

howling. What is now the RC was orignally solely "Space Vikings" rabid 
hungry wolves out to steal technology (that they couldn\'t make or 
maintain themselves) so they could "reclaim the stars" *for themselves*

Too many people said "but we don\'t want to play destructive raiders (at 
least not all the time)" and "that\'s it? You wreck the Imperium for this? 
Bye!"

To be fair, while not printed out as separate adventures, Path of Tears 
does suggest noncombat adventures down to the planet level (just not many 
of them). Constructing the adventure is left as an exercise for the GM 
(who needs to do something once in a while...).

Don\'t forget that many folk with that kind of ability can have a kinder, 
gentler, more fun life by taking those abilities and applying 
themselves for their own benefit in politics, business, etc, rather than 
the Imp or Regency Navy. Not to mention that some number of the nobility 
need to be taken out of the officer pool to minister family holdings or 
businesses, help run other parts of the Imperial (or regency) government, 
etc.

Also, If you are a noble parent with two sons, one brilliant, with good 
common sense, and one that\'s a bit of a louse, which one will you suggest 
goes off with the Navy for a decade or two?  If said Baron drops a note 
to the Captain-Dean of Admissions at the local imperial trainery, the 
Captain is likely to acquiesce and take the louse...

Also, I always rather had the feeling that the Navy represented one of 
the few means for the "great unwashed" to get a chance to break into 
higher social ranks, where brains and ability could at least compete with 
parentage and inheritance.

So, I\'d say there is space in the Navy wardrooms for non-nobles, and that 
not all Navy officers resemble buck rogers (an untitled commoner, I believe).

In any spaceship energy eventually gets converted to heat, which must be

out of Traveller).  If you run the calculations for your average warship,
even assuming really efficient weapons (99.99% efficient) and a solid ship,
you end up with a nice cherry-coloured glow.

You can also get some amusing effects with robots and the calculations are
even easier, because here all the energy ends up as heat.  The old
MegaTraveller robots doubled as nice space heaters. (Robot butler, sticking
finger in cup, "let me warm your coffee, sir.")

Similar effect from high-tech cities with really large power plants.  

Something for you FFS hot-shots to calculate (pun intended).

(Personally I don\'t bother with fixing these rules, because I don\'t have the
time/interest to redesign the design system.  Still, if you\'re playing around
with varient versions of FFS it\'s something you might want to consider.)

Consider: When the Romans set up base camp, there was usually nothing 
nearby - certainly no one owning all the nearby land. More modern bases 
(say US bases), refurbishing has been dome by tearing down and replacing 
older facilities with newer ones.

Space Navy bases will probably periodically need to rebuild landing pads. 
Buildings will need to be replaced every 1-7 centuries (certainly to be 
gutted and refurbished/wired for changing technology. For instance, say 
in  400 3i a building is created as offices. By 489, new buildings are 
needed (its easier to build a new office building than to rewire this 
one). Building 2 is built and moved into by 495. Building 1 is 
refurbished as officer\'s quarters. In 584, Building 2 is turned into 
classrooms for the new regional Imperial Naval Academy; Building 1 is 
changed slightly to be a dorm (other buildings are built elsehwere. In 
722, the academy is moved to a new orbital facility; building 2 is 
turned into a warehouse.; building 1 is torn down, and in its place a 
"temporary" landing pad is built (for use while the main pads are taken 
out of service for their 3rd rebuilding). By 744, all the pads are 
rebuilt, and the Building 1 site (an open pad still called Sanborne Hall 
by tradition) is covered over to be a small craft maintenance site (since 
the floor can still hold multi-hundred ton craft).

The face of the base will change; land will go from open to building and 
back depending on the needs of the time.

It is equally possible that while building the supports for the Maint 
building, archeologists will halt teh activity to investigate the hidden 
underground complex discovered (it has been built under the base as an 
emergency HQ back in 325, but no one has had to access teh records that 
discuss it for several centuries that the records are effectively lost).

Hmmm. Actually, this gives a number of adventures ideas....

Ideas, maybe, but I _have_ lots of those.  I just don\'t have the time to do
much with them.  

I want something that someone playtested and found works, that I don\'t have
to spend a lot of time preparing.  But then, I also want all necessary maps,
building plans, and personalities worked out.  I _hate_ the phrase "the
referee must create..." in an adventure (unless it\'s referring to some small
sidetrack).  I\'m greedy, and I have very little spare time.  

I\'ve mentioned all this to GDW, but the truth of the matter is that they can
only write so much stuff, so if combat adventures are the only ones that
people submit then that\'s all I\'ll get to see.

In fact, I\'ll throw out the following challenge:

Write a detective adventure set somewhere inside the Coalition.  The solution
should call for deducation and reasoning.  Local customs and tech should make
this more than a \'Dick Tracy in space\' episode.  The player might be RC
personnel, local police, or civilians.  All local laws and procedures should
be followed (or legally skirted) - any resulting conviction should be because
of proof not firepower.  The players should be liable for their actions and
have to live with the results (possibly this is their homeworld: "don\'t piss
in your own pool").  Include a reasonable array of suspects; possibly even
leave the referee the choice of which one is guilty, with varient clues
depending on who the real criminal is.

I\'ve done (more than) my fair share of trading adventures, but I\'m not very
good at writing detective ones even though I _love_ to play them.

I\'m not sure if the RAFM figures are available yet - they weren\'t when I
tried to order some before Christmas. The catalogue lists ship\'s crew,
techs, RC Marines in BD, robots, and a few others.

The Denizen figures have been out for a few years, and are *very* nice.
They\'re not official Traveller figures, but there are some that appear to
be wearing Zhodani combat armour...

Here is the Dakaar-class freighter, which was partially described
in _The Drenslaar Quest_ by W.H. Keith published by Gamelords.

While the Dakaars operate mostly in Reavers\' Deep, equivalent 
designs are likely common throughout Imperial space.


Dakkar-class freighters were built by Starstream Enterprises 
on Caledon (Tech Level 12) and were operated by Starstream, 
Dakaar Trading (a subsidiary of the Dakaar Corporation), the 
Aariskin Corporation of Ildrissar, and a number of other 
subsector- or larger sized shipping and trading concerns. 
These ships are designed primarily for surface-to-surface 
cargo transfer capability.  While they have no space dedicated to 
a ship\'s vehicle, most crews commonly carry an air/raft in the 
cargo hold.

That was true. However, welcome to TNE. Read it. Ships USUALLY jump with 
the aproach vector they want to use at the target planet, and pop it close
to on target. lucky ones only need to turn on the engines to land. So, 
corrections upon exiting will not need to be large.

A good point! All this is of course known data used in astrogation 
calculations, so it isn\'t a secret. Just pop a rock moving in a vector 
opposite the planet\'s orbit.... and you get an earth-shattering kaboom.

>You may not find a suitably sized rock that can withstand
>multiple 10-megaton charges going off on it within 1 jump of the target...

Considering the number of systems that have a belt or gas giant (which 
tend to collect space junk in their leading and trailing trojan points),
I\'d say finding one is easy. Also, note the above comment about TNE 
jumping - few corrections would be required.

The comments about catching such a weapon while it is being devised 
raises it own problems - your stealth vessels jump into the system, turn 
on the densimeters - and note several planetary masses and hundreds of 
smaller planetoids. Not to mention a variety of ships. THEN they have to 
begin searching for them (engine use is detectable). Plus, with TNE\'s
fuel rules, they cannot cruise about changing vectors very long without 
needing fuel. ANyone that chlose to the enemy should at least watch if 
not guard fuel carefully....

Pluswhich, given TNE, if you are going to the expense of sacrificing a 
jumpdrive for a massive object anyway, its not that much more expensive 
to put in a multi-parsec junp drive - which makes finding ity still more 
difficult...

Hans sez:

Does it say that this is randomly determined, or is this known based on 
the distance traveled and various aspects of the fabric of space in the 
region? If it is randomly determined, then that is a general problem with 
astrogation, and it means that most merchant traffic does NOT make it near
the 100 diameter sphere.

(For those of you saying huh? consider: 93 million miles (1AU) from the 
sun, the earth travels in excess of 280 million miles per annum - or 
about 750,000 miles a day. Just about Earth\'s 100 diameter limit. If you 
can\'t be sure where within those three days you will arrive, then you 
need a decent safety factor to ensure you are outside the 100 diameter 
limit for anywhere during those three days!  Otherwise, you may re-enter
normal space deep within the gravity well - or not re-enter at all. 
Normal traffic will avoid this region like the plague.  People arriving 
above or below the plain of the ecliptic can use a smaller safetyu 
margin, but may well  be more than 100 diameters out on appearance - and 
re-enter space with a bad vector, that requires fuel expenditure to correct.)

(Either this is a screw up of TNE (hardly a surprise) or this doesn\'t happen,
and jumps take a known period of time.

>So why not impose a limit to how fast things can move in jump space?

Rules state there is none; veolcity vector is conserved from the entry 
point into jump space to the exit point back into normal space with no 
effect on jump. Unless you want to create a set of rules varying the 
ability to get into jump space based on (what? size, weight? speed? total 
energy?) and make some reasonable explanation for it, skip it. And be 
nicer to your neighbors so they don\'t drop rocks on your planet.

Howdy,

I calculated the displacement of the new Free Trader mini at 206 tons at a
scale of 1:1000.  In doing so (I had to copy one to do it) I calculated the
density of the white metal used to cast the original.  It is about
5.46g/cm^3.
So in the future I will figure out the scale as soon as I get the mini to a
scale :)

(BTW, the 206 tons is well within what it should be based on the rules (and
is a good little mini (aside from mold tears))

Over at xboat, there\'s quite a discussion on rock-throwing for military 
purposes.

My question for this group: what is the best, most cost-efficent way to 
move rocks in system during peacetime: 

Jump Drives?                  Fusion Drive?
Solar Sail\'s?                 HEPlaR?                  Ion?

My personal bet is solar sails, since it\'s free and probably the least 
costly (by FAR).  The only down-side I can see is the long travel times 
needed to move, say a 20 km-diameter asteroid. (no numbers to calculate 
mass, right now...)

I\'m assuming that - if you can move the rock cheaply enough - it\'s 
definitely less costly to mine it in orbit around the mainworld rather 
than out in the dark.

An associated question: is there any non-violent reason why a megacorp would 
want to move a rock quickly?

HEPlaR isn\'t an option (it isn\'t a particularly effective way of moving even a
ship these days :)  One thing to remember is that ion and sails have the 
advantage of constant thrust, but that that thrust will be very low.  Even a 
small ship could give a rock a decent push into a lower energy transfer orbit
without too much trouble (1g accel is *big*, and even a tenth of a g ain\'t
too shabby).

A bunch of seekers could work together to give it some delta v, then meet it
at the return end to brake and orbit it (assuming a peaceful use).

Regarding their wartime use, I think that unless the goal (and result) was total
destruction, they would be part of any big bombardment ifit is easier to do than
"normal" bombardment.  Total warfare would be met in kind, and thus there is 
detante (IMO).  Leaving it as a possibility makes for neat plot lines anyway
:)

While on the subject of drives, what about SDBs these days?  Without *much* more
fuel (delta v) they can\'t operate they way they should/did historically.  The
max delta v possible is something like 200 BL hexes/turn assuming the ship is
all fuel, this isn\'t enough to keep reasonable trip times for SDBs if they are
to engage in hit and run tactics.  Maybe they could have combo HEPlaR/fusion
drives that only use the HEPlaR near planets, and use an efficient fusion drive
(giving a few hundred hexes delta v) for deep space travel.  A way to prevent
a starship/SDB arms race drive wise would be to say that there is a maximun
relative velocity (relative to systemwide particulate matter (which compared to
ship velocities would be more or less fixed)) before Lanthium jump grids get
ablated by micro-meteorites and solar protons, etc.  This would allow the SDBs
some reason not to have jump drives (otherwise they should be jump 1 for 
in system travel).

Of course, with TNE and Virus, closely connecting computers (and removing
humans from the loop) may not be a viable (or desirable) option.


As to conserving velocity, remember that every star is moving at a different
vector as it orbits the galactic core.  I can\'t recall exact speeds, but
remember from some quick research a few years ago that the different vectors
between systems was enough that ships would need a long time (and a lot of
fuel) to match vectors with each world.  Allowinf a Jump to change your
vector at least gets around this problem.  (In fact, it may have been the
reason Jump changed vectors.)

This unit has  a focal diameter of 12, count em, 12 meters. As a
result at TL-12, the effective range is 120 hexes. Woof. Consequently
at normal combat ranges, the damage and penetration are intense. This
model is accompanied by a fusion reactor that provides the 166.67 MW
required by the weapon. The data above is a complete package, I can
also provide full stats for this weapon both with and without the
reactors.

The immense damage and penetration rating are indicative of
the imbalance between spaceship weapons. This laser fits into the (TL
x 50Mj) limit for lasers discussed previously on the TML, but the wide
focal array gives a long efective range and so at the range where fire
is possible the discharge energy is multiplied. The meson gun above
gives much worse performance and for seven times the price.
Admittedly, lasers are a mature technology at TL-12 while meson guns
are relatively new.

	Yes but, I doubt you\'ld want to wait the decades it\'s take to get a 
sail-driven rock to the orbit you want.  Sails are meant for a BIG 
sail-area:mass of payload ratio.  I\'d go for fusion, ion or even good 
ol\' chemical drive...

	Only if the cost differential made the time costs worthwile...like I 
said, using a sail, you could go broke waiting for your rock to come 
in.

	Ahhh...there\'s the fun part...Claim Jumping? Hiding Resources? Stealing 
alien technology stuck on the rock? Getting a (large) cache of supplies to 
the right spot?  Putting a beacon of some sort into place? Using it 
to build L5 Colonies? Lotsa excuses for moving a rock.  There is an 
ooooold SF Novel \'Moon Zero-Two\' (late 60\'s I think) which was involved with
such a 
plot...in this case the rock was a twenty or so ton emerald, that 
they were trying to get to "land\' on a pre-staked claim on the moon.

My personal favorite is O\'Neill\'s -- mass driver using chunks of the rock

For rocks, no ---- might be a good way to move an ice asteriod, tho.  Not an

HEPlaR is pretty miraculous by the standards of real-world rockets (which
FF&S emasculates horribly).

As for SDBs, they should have jump 1 drives for in-system travel.  Small ones
should use HEPlaR to conserve mass, and large ones should use Fusion Rockets
to cut down reaction mass and powerplant weight, and get bonus free power
to run the weapons from the Drive power tap-off.  Around here, we treat
HEPlaR
as being as hot as fusion rockets, since the performance is only possible
with
a fusion rocket anyway.  You want to land in cities, use chemical rockets and
Contragrav.

I did a real quickie estimate of this a while ago, based on the radial
velocity of 45 stars within 5 parsecs of Earth.  There is an error here
in that this is the radial velocity and not true relative velocity, but
it makes for a decent estimate.  The scale is in BL/BR hexes per turn,
which I don\'t remember off the top of my head.

hexes/turn:  0       1      2      3      4      5      6        7      15

# of stars:  14       15    6      2      2      2      1        1        1

Or, expressed in terms of percentage of stars with a radial velocity
equal to or less than a given velocity:

hexes/turn:       0     1      2      3      4      5     

       % =<:      31    64    78     82    86    91


Realizing that true relative velocity takes into account motion in
three dimensions rather than just along the direct line to Earth
(the radial velocity), corrections will drive the numbers upward,
especially at the low end.  However, a not-going-too-far-out-on-a-
limb guess would put most still under 2 hexes/turn.

Of course, you will still have those occasional wildcards, like
the one moving 15 in this sample.

If anyone wants to do better, go right ahead, I wouldn\'t mind 
more accurate numbers myself.

I\'m currently working on a program tentatively titled \'Survey\', that is

It takes standard .UWP sector files, and maps the sector in a variety

map subsector by starport and allegiance.  I\'ve got other plans, but 
basic program is up and running.  It runs under MS-DOS, but can be run
under Windows.

Is there any interest in such a program?  I\'ve found it to be useful,
if only to resurrect my moribund Pascal skills.  If anyone does have
an interest, where would be the best place to post it (it\'s about

A series of articles in Challenge a couple of years ago talked about 
traveller wet navies quite extensively and while I can\'t speak for TNE 
(#include <std.disclaimer>), in MT, a high-tech sub is an SDB.  

Planetary warfare is reduced to orbital craft vs. submerged craft that 
are deeper than the sensor range of orbiting attackers.  Anything in 
between is an easy target, and it\'s assumed there are enough surface 
sensors to give the submerged craft an advantage.  Now a jump-capable 
sub would be a jump-capable SDB which would be ...

Of course this is a theoretical ideal, your actual managerial mileage 
my vary.  Upper-level leaders are rarely strategists/engineers, so the 
Countess\' sub sales could still happen, if for the wrong reasons.

or, What do I do with this white dwarf?
----

    A very long time ago, several Traveller players noticed that 
the standard sector files had some, well, "peculiar" (read:  
stupid) combinations of worlds and stars.  Rich, Agricultural 
worlds with 2 white dwarfs for suns, for example.  Worlds 
described in old Classic Traveller adventures as hot, desert 
worlds were found to have M9 V cinders for suns...  and so on.  

    Some time back (last month), Harold Hale proposed that, while 
visiting Viral destruction on your favorite systems, Referees 
take the time to fix some of those weird world-star combos.  He 
outlined some thumbrules* for doing so that would change things 
to better match observed stellar frequencies, and make sense, 
too.  I said, "Great!", clipped and filed the article, and 
continued with Christmas planning.  

    Since I like to write programs for the fun of it, and I find 
rolling dice for n-thousand worlds really, really tedious, I 
decided to write Yet Another Rexx Script to do the job, to be 
called SUNFIX.CMD.  

Howard Hale\'s algorithm
----

    While you\'re destroying interstellar civilization at the 
local level, you may also want to take the time to correct 
anomalous stellar data.  All class "D" stars which are primaries 
(particularly with a main world that is even marginally 
habitable) should be changed to class "V"; all class "VI" stars 
should be "V" stars; all K5 through M9 class "IV" should be 
changed to class "V".  

** why: There are no class VI stars; ditto for K5 thru M9 IV
stars.

    Also, check to see if the main world and the star it circles 
are compatible.  For example, it is next to impossible to have an 
"Earth-like" planet circling around a M6 V star.  Geo Gelinas 
came up with a table to convert imcompatible mainworld-star 
combinations.  All M4 V, M5 V, M6 V, M7V, M8 V, and M9V stars 
that have a habitable planet (one with atmosphere type 4-9 or 
D-F), should be converted using the table.  Systems containing a 
M3 V star should be examined on an individual basis for 
conversion (a world circling such a star would be a *very* chilly 
place indeed...if you intend the world to be like Star Wars\' 
iceplanet Hoth or some cold, barren desert it should work "as 
is", but if you had something a bit "balmier" in mind, change the 
star).

    Now that you\'ve fixed the primaries, look at the companions.  
I decided that Harold\'s method of going back and forth counting 
white dwarfs and adjusting the count was too much of a hassle for 
a one-pass program; I assigned a flat 33% chance that an existing
M type "D" white dwarf would remain a white dwarf, albeit changed 
in spectral class, or turn into a \'V\'.  Use the following table 
to assign the new spectral class.

   Make sure you note all changes in stellar data (for primaries and
companions) on the 1117 or 1129 stats as well.

   The result will be stellar data that not only reflects the Universe
accordi
ng
to the TNE stellar generation rules, but also to some degree the Real
Universe (or what we currently know about it).

   Kaguk (the name shorten for Terran pallets I guess some years ago)
is another classic example.  It is an agricultural world that at according
to the old listings orbited around a M3 D star!  That\'s not even enough
wattage to grow mushrooms.  In fact, the temperature of such a world
(regardless of its orbit) would likely be so cold that it could not even
have an atmosphere.

   The work was not mine alone, though certainly I was thinking along
the same lines as the other individuals who should get a share of the
credit.  They are (and I apologize profusely if I forget anyone):

   Mark "Geo" Gelinas - who developed a supplement to the Collapse
Effect rules which updated the primary stars of the standard sector
files.

   Leroy "Hindmost" Guatney - who acted as sounding board, well of
knowledge, and verbal sparring partner as I began my  Holy Quest for
Astronomical Correctness.  His involvement with Traveller dates back
long before Book 6: Scouts, and he is an amateur astronomer to boot.
Leroy is currently working on a new stellar generation system which
will be proposed at some point in the future as a replacement for the
current "House System" (which still has its flaws, though it should be
noted is much improved over previous versions).

Additional Notes

clarification: There are class VI stars, *but* because of their nature
(lacking in any elements above helium-- therefore, no planets,
asteroids, or even comets), they are not portrayed in the game.
Solo white dwarfs also usually lack planetary bodies--the evolution
of the star from main sequence to giant to white dwarf normally cooks
away all the planetary bodies in a system.  Occasionally, though, a
planet or two might survive--a Pluto-like body or on rare
occasions an outer  gas giant.  No exceptions are made for this in
Geo\'s conversion guidelines, *but* if you want to add a bit of realism
(and don\'t mind the extra hassle of there being an exception to the
rule), keep two or three white dwarf primaries--a "qualified" candidate
should consist of a O - K white dwarf, with a main world that has an
atmosphere of 1 or less.  A gas giant or two may be present, but no
world can be any closer than orbit 5 or 6.

addition: True, \'B\' class white dwarfs have a habitable zone, but the
nature of white dwarf star systems (see above) would preclude the
possibility of there being a world that close to the star, barring Ancients
manipulation (read: for all practical purposes non-existent).  Also,
every white dwarf out there was  at one time a red giant star.
This fact would preclude star systems that consist of a primary with a
white dwarf in close orbit and a habitable planet in orbit 2-4 (or so)
from existing (the habitable planet would at one time have been inside
the envelope of the red giant and been destroyed).

   33 percent...humm...I decided on changing all the white dwarfs to
\'M\' type main sequence stars first (and then reconverting some of them
later) because I wanted to radically reduce the number of so-called
\'DM\' companions.  I\'m curious, Cynthia, on the average number of
white dwarfs per subsector that results from your method.  Some of the
old standard sector files had a DM in over half the star systems, while
others had lesser amounts because they where generated much later.

>Use the following table  to assign the new spectral class.

   This table is reflective of the white dwarf frequency as we know
it to exist today.  Notice that \'K\' and \'A\' class white dwarfs are the
most common type, unlike main sequence stars which have the
distribution listed in Cynthia\'s post (\'M\' class being the most common, then
\'K\', \'G\', etc.).

>** why change spectral class?  The universe isn\'t old enough for  there

   There was a raging debate between Leroy and myself over the
question of whether \'M\' class white dwarfs should even be included
at all on the white dwarf class tables (I held out that they shouldn\'t be,
he countered that they should).  The result was a compromise which
allows them to occur, but very infrequently.  \'M\' class white dwarfs
are theoretically (I say theoretically because so far, none have been
confirmed to exist, though there is at least one K9 D out there)
extremely old white dwarfs, on the order of 8 to 10 billions years, 
which could be population I or II stars.  They almost certainly *can not*
be found as companions of young \'O\', \'B\', \'A\' or even \'F\' or \'G\' class
main sequence stars (\'K\' class main sequence would be borderline
at best) as the combination would be akin to having a 80 year old man

Makes for an interesting idea for a new class of planetary bombardment
weapon.

If you come out of jump with a very high velocity relative to your
target world, and your ship is equipped with, say, a spinal or
parallel mounted MASS DRIVER, rapid-firing 1 to 10 tonne shells...

Maybe they\'re made of stealth material.  Hmmm...  At higher techs
you could keep the mass the same but make them smaller by using
better materials technology...  That might just hurt a whole lot.

And it would be a whole lot cheaper than moving asteroids around.

Cool. I did not know that; the one college-level astronomy text I had around
the house didn\'t even mention class VI stars, so I figured GDW had
interpolated them into existance or something.  You learn something every
day....

GURPS Space system roll-up rules had a good way to handle this -- first 
you generate a normal system of a main sequence star of the same spectral
class.  Then you run it thru red giant and maybe supernova stages.  What\'s
leftis the white dwarf\'s planetary system.

Well, I used a very unscientific method to come up with that 
percentage (33%) -- I ran it against the Spinward Marches and
adjusted the percentages by trial & error until it averaged around 3-4
dwarfs remaining per subsector.  Like for VIRUS.CMD -- you have the
source code, adjust \'til it suits you.  I liked the results I got with 33%,
so
I went with that number.  If you have some ideas for improving that while
sticking with one pass thru the file, I would love to hear them.  I want  to
keep this one-pass or so, as the current code will work on both subsector
and sector sized files, while leaving comments, etc. where they were.

Since the real universe is also 3-dimensional, for our campaign we
decided that the 2-D hex map actually represents a map of jumpspace,
not realspace.  Gravitational potentials and other forces force stars to be
*at least* one parsec apart in jumpspace. And, there is not necessarily a
one-to-one correspondence between a star\'s realspace position and its
jumpspace position.  Supernova collapses in particular can move adjacent
stars a looong way in jumpspace, as unclimbable hills of "jump potential" 
form about spinning black holes and neutron stars... (Now you know why
you never find the damn things on the standard sector maps... You can\'t get
there from here.) Again, the standard "In My Campaign" disclaimer....

   BD+38 2285  is a G8 VI, and BD+31 1684 is a G2 VI--both are in the
"local" stellar neighborhood (within 25 parsecs).  There are others as
well.  I\'ve learned a lot about Astronomy since I started doing research
on the "real" stars of the Solomani Rim--a lot more than I picked up in
my college Astronomy courses (all of two).  I figure I\'ll be a bonafide
expert in about another...oh, 50 years.  It\'s fun though, or I would find
some other mental gymnastics to busy myself.

   The same could be done with the TNE system, but it seems like an
awful lot of trouble to go to just to blow something up (the same could
be said of many action/adventure movies).  Smells like a Challenge article
to me....

   I figured to do it *accurately* you would have to first have to know
the age of the stellar region with which you were working (the
older the patch of stars, the more white dwarfs there would be).  That
kind of research is of course beyond the scope of this game.  The D6
method (converting all the DMs and then deciding on how many white
dwarfs there really are) is indeed a two step method, but I liked the
results it gave me (then again I tend to be more "hands on" with the
data, making any revisions personally).  Three per subsector is an
interesting number, because it is about the average with which I came
up for the Solomani Rim (actually 3.75--some of them because they
*really* were there waiting to be counted, not just rolled on some dice). 
   
   From what I\'ve been able to determine, my number is pretty close
(white dwarf companion-wise) to the real figure for the stellar region
close to Sol.  Three as a universal average would work fairly well,
assuming the local area (50 light years or so) is reflective of the rest of
Known Space.

   There are a number of ways to handle the situation.  One problem that
I can see is that your explanation relies on gravitational theories which
may or may not be accurate.  While I agree that gravity would tend to
distort jump space on an interstellar scale (making the fastest way to get
from point \'A\' to \'B\' not necessarily a straight line), I disagree with your
analysis of supernova effects.  A ship doesn\'t "climb a hill" when it goes
into jump, it tunnels through the hill and comes out the other side.  This is
why a ship disappears from normal space when jump is initiated.  This
is not to say that a supernova (which occurs only *very* rarely--none 
will have occurred for thousands of years in Known Space by the time
of TNE) wouldn\'t have some effects.  

   One potential problem for ships in jump space near the supernova
would be that the distortion waves created could "swat\' a ship out of
jump space, leaving it helpless in deep space (unless it had extra jump
fuel).  The distortion waves would travel out like ripples in a pond,
and could affect an area of several parsecs.  Another possible effect
would be that some ships might get "carried off" by the distortion waves
and deposited in a system far from the intended destination (possibly
even back to the system they started from!)--and no, I wouldn\'t dare say
similar to Star Trek: Voyager (tm)...but if I did, you\'d know what I mean....


>... (Now you know why you never find the damn things on the
>standard sector maps... You can\'t get there from here.) Again, the
>standard "In My Campaign" disclaimer....

   There are no black holes in "Known Space", and darn few neutron
stars (in fact, none come to mind right away).  They weren\'t included
in the Traveller rules for this reason.  It made little sense, I\'m sure, to
the
folks at GDW (and I\'m speculating here Loren, if you\'re listening) to do
the research required for rules to generate such phenomenon when
the characters would likely never encounter them.

   Perhaps your PCs run further afield, or your version of "Known
Space" is different from the "orthodox" version (which I believe is the
case here).  It\'s interesting to speculate about the nature of jump space,
and how it interacts with "real" or "normal" space.  It also generally true
that for every group that plays Traveller, there is a different theory
as to exactly how it works.  As with theories of God, someone could
be right, and possibly everyone is wrong....we\'ll probably never know
in our lifetimes.

Ah, yes.  It was in Challeng 29.  The article was wriotten for Twilight:2000,
and covered: how to create real-seeming weather; the effects of winter season
weather in the environment; and the effects of being in cold weather 
conditions without proper food, shelter or clothing. (I wrote it; I\'m 
quite pleased someone else has acknowledged its existence).

It was written for TW:2K v1, but should be adaptable easily enough (it 
treated the effects of cold as fatigue). Some mods should be taken for 
"how cold is it": Winter in Poland or any temperate zone can be 
compensated for easily enough, but that heavy sweater and leather coat 
may not be adequate for Artic exploration!

Perhaps I\'ll dig that puppy out and look at the article again and post an 
update here...

I never did get the Desert Environment, but I adored the Mountain 
Environment. Gamelords paired these with adventure modules taking place 
in those special environments (Desert with the Dunraiders; Mountain with 
Ascent of Anekhathor(sp)).

Mountain Env was mostly dedicated to types of mountaineering; designing 
mountain terrain (for your characters to then climb) (size of region; 
difficulty; number of pitches; etc). It included a bit about temperature drop
during climbing and a bit about the effects of cold (also of oxygen 
starvation) and chances of accident.

I can dig that out and provide more detail....

If you have seen it before, sorry for the repetition.

Ten big myths about copyright explained
July 19 1994, Brad Templeton  address: brad@clarinet.com                     


1) If it doesn\'t have a copyright notice, it\'s not copyrighted.

        This was true in the past, but today almost all major
        nations follow the Berne copyright convention.  After April
        1, 1989, everything created in the USA, for example, is
        copyrighted and protected whether it has a notice or not.
        The default you must assume for other people\'s works is that
        they are copyrighted and may not be copied unless you *know*
        otherwise.  There are some old works that lost protection
        without notice, but frankly you should not risk it unless
        you know for sure.

        It is true that a notice strengthens the protection, by
        warning people, and by allowing one to get more and
        different damages, but it is not necessary.  If it looks
        copyrighted, you must assume it is.

2) If I don\'t charge for it, it\'s not a violation.

        False.  Whether you charge can affect the damages awarded in
        court, but that\'s the only difference.  It\'s still a
        violation if you give it away -- and there can still be
        heavy damages if you hurt the commercial value of the
        property.

3) If it\'s posted to USENET it\'s in the public domain.

        False.  Nothing is in the public domain anymore unless the
        owner explicitly puts it in the public domain(*).  Explicitly,
        as in you have a note from the author/owner saying, "I grant
        this to the public domain."  Those exact words or words very
        much like them.

        Some argue that posting to USENET implicitly grants
        permission to everybody to copy the posting as much as they
        like.  This is very probably wrong.  First, the whole
        purpose of copyright is to provide protection to people
        after they freely distribute it.  For example, George
        Lucas still owns Star Wars after broadcasting it on free TV
        or giving copies to lots of people.  Secondly, that argument
        breaks down when one considers what it would mean for you to
        post an MPEG of Star Wars to the net (other than some really
        annoyed people with v.32bis modem feeds.)  All the copying
        would still go on, but clearly without permission since you
        -- unless you are George Lucas -- didn\'t have the right to
        give permission to copy in the first place.

        (*) It\'s also in the public domain if the creator has been
        dead for 50 years.  If anybody dead for 50 years is posting
        to the net, let me know.

4) My posting was just fair use!

        See the notes on fair use for a detailed answer, but bear
        the following in mind:

        The "fair use" exemption to copyright law was created to
        allow commentary, news reporting and education *on*
        copyrighted works without the permission of the author.  In
        this case, the "on" is important.  You must be commenting on
        or reporting about the *work*, not the subject matter of the
        work.  If you could have reported the facts in your own
        words, but didn\'t to save typing, it\'s probably not fair
        use.  If you needed to demonstrate something about the
        actual work or writing, then it might be fair use.

        Fair use is almost always a short excerpt and almost always
        attributed.  It should not ruin the commercial value of the
        work (which is why reproduction of the entire work is
        generally verboten.)

5) If you don\'t defend your copyright you lose it.

        False.  Copyright is *never* lost now, unless explicitly
        given away.  You may be thinking of trade marks, which can
        be weakened or lost if not defended.

6) Somebody has that name copyrighted!

        You can\'t copyright a name, or anything short like that.
        Titles usually don\'t qualify, but I doubt you could write a
        song entitled "Everybody\'s got something to hide except for
        me and my monkey."

        However, you can trademark an adjective, when applied to a
        generic type of product or service.  Like an "Apple"
        computer.  Apple Computer owns that word applied to
        computers, even though it is also an ordinary word.  Apple
        records owns it when applied to music.  Neither owns the
        word on its own, only in context.

        You can\'t use somebody else\'s trademark in a way that would
        unfairly hurt the value of the mark, or in a way that might
        make people confuse you with the real owner of the mark, or
        which might allow you to profit from the mark\'s good name.
        For example, if I were giving advice on music videos, I
        would be very wary of trying to label my works with a name
        like "mtv."  :-)

7) They can\'t get me, I\'m innocent until proven guilty.

        Copyright law is mostly civil law.  If you violate copyright
        you would usually get sued, not charged with a crime.
        "Innocent until proven guilty" is a principle of criminal
        law, as is "proof beyond a reasonable doubt."  Sorry, but in
        copyright suits, these don\'t apply.  It\'s mostly which side
        the judge or jury believes more.

8) Oh, so copyright violation isn\'t a crime or anything?

        Actually, recently in the USA commercial copyright
        violations involving more than 10 copies and/or value over
        $2500 was made a felony.  So watch out.  (At least you get
        the protections of criminal law.)

9) It doesn\'t hurt anybody, in fact it\'s free advertising.

        It\'s up to the owner to decide if they want the free ads or
        not.  If they want them, they will be sure to contact you.
        Don\'t rationalize whether it hurts the owner or not, *ask*
        them.  Usually that\'s not too hard to do.  Time past,
        ClariNet published the very funny Dave Barry column to a
        large and appreciative USENET audience for a fee, but some
        jerk didn\'t ask, and forwarded it to a mailing list, got
        caught, and the newspaper chain that employs Dave Barry
        pulled the column from the net, pissing off everybody who
        enjoyed it.  Even if you can\'t think of how the author or
        owner gets hurt, think about the fact that piracy on the net
        hurts everybody who wants a chance to use this wonderful new
        technology to do more than read other people\'s flamewars.

10) They e-mailed me a copy, so I can post it.

        To have a copy is not to have the copyright.  All the E-mail
        you write is copyrighted.  However, E-mail is not, unless
        previously agreed, secret.  So you can certainly *report* on
        what E-mail you are sent, and reveal what it says.  You can
        even quote parts of it to demonstrate.  Frankly, somebody
        who sues over an ordinary message might well lose, because
        the message has no commercial value, but if you want to stay
        strictly in the law, you should ask first.

    'body' => 'Battle Rider is very difficult to get a handle on, I\'ve played a lot of 
SFB and find it very easy to set up a balanced game with and to easily 
ascertain how effective weapons and sensors are. I  expect that BR will 
get easier, perhaps someone will post a replay of a game (GDW? playtesters?).

An SFB mailing list exists, email Steve Cole at S.Cole@genie.geis.com and 
ask him about it (come to think of it I\'d like the address myself).

Back to BR. One of the problems we ran into playing it was that
1) Ranges are hard to get a feel for. I\'ll be making a reference card to 
write down ranges, to hit #\'s, and damage values. What format should I 
post it in?

2)The ships as designed are hard to hurt with direct fire weapons. Note 
that a battleship is almost immune to meson gun fire and particle 
accelerators as well. For example a Sylea class BB has a meson screen 
factor of 16. When its size of -4 is added in it takes a meson gun of 21 
to do any permanent damage. The Sylea itself carries the largest meson 
gun in the game and only has a 16 factor at short (10 hex) range. 
Admittedly any shot which isn\'t completely blocked by the screen will do 
temporary damage if its Dv exceeds the size modifier, but that means that 
the primary weapon of the largest ships in the game can\'t hurt each other 
at all. That leaves missiles and lasers as the only weapons that can 
_hurt_ an enemy capital ship.

I find this somehow unsatisfactory. And I suspect that the ship designs
were done and not properly evaluated for effectiveness against their
primary opponents. The battleships in BR all carry missiles at 40(200)
factors, and the battle riders have missile factors of 20(100). A Sylea BB
has 30 lasers and 40 sandcasters to shoot down incoming missiles. They had
better be well escorted as an attempt to kill a BB will involve several
ships worth of missiles attacking one defending ship. You\'ll also need
sensor pickets to _detect_ the missiles in time for defenses to engage the
missiles before they make their attack pass. 

I don\'t see the usefulness of meson guns under the current rules systems. 
Ditto for N-PAWS. Missiles are highly effective but are easily countered. 
Lasers are perhaps too effective, I don\'t think GDW took large diameter 
lasers into account at all (see my previous post of a tl-12 laser with a 
BR factor of 10:(-2) 10-8-5-3) in designing their ships. It seems that BR 
has broken the assumptions made about space combat from High Guard to MT.

Thats a hundred billion credits and it can still only guarantee damage on

ship with a large meson screen past 21 hexes at all. On the otherhand, 
the gun is 2 klicks long, and draws over a gigawatt of power. And I 
repeat, a hundred billion credits.

If there\'s an interest I can add deep mounts to the worksheet and put up a
variety of weapons from different TL\'s. The worksheet contains all the
neccessary tables and so I can\'t post the darn thing anywhere. 

By the way, a meson gun deep mount includes contragravity for the entire 
traverse sphere, so the weapon turns to bear on a target as if it were in 
zero-g (.01g or less). That doesn\'t eliminate mass, but surely helps.

whtat the hey, I\'ll put the new formulae in now...

Well kids, I\'ve been silent for a whiles. There is one thing
that been bugging me, and that is call-signs. My players were
all hot to give themselves their own. And the ones they came
up with were BAD, VERY BAD. So here is a simple house rule We
came up with.  ( No I won\'t list the rejects, half of them were not for 
polite company)
 
The player can come up with a possible callsign, then he/she/it 
has the pleasant duty to let the rest of the group vote ( moan,
is the likely case), If the group objects, then a appropriate 
callsign is given, through the characters action and/or 
mannerisms.
 
This method seems to work best, and it cuts down on the really
bad one and lets the good ones by.

In other things, could one of you nice people list here or in private mail 
the stats Tl 14 144mj laser lance from BL. I\'ve seemed to misplaced some 
reference material in the this most recent move.

Not wanting to get too off track, but the major problems with many scenarios
for both these games (and others) is that they shouldn\'t always be balanced
:)
But I know what you\'re getting at...

A useful thing to have... dunno about the best format----mac would be nice :)

The result, though, is that you need to get an Outstanding success to do real
damage... this\'ll drop the range on the meson guns (they were always short
range weapons).  It also means that it\'s worth the extra point cost to buy
the
Crack crew.

There are *many* problems with missiles in BR/BL IMHO.  The big problem in
terms of a change from what those of us that played CT expect to happen is
that
missiles couldn\'t do more than scape stuff off a BB before, now they can kill
it.  We don\'t allow Outstanding hits for missiles when we play BR, since they
are nasty enough with the 1-6 damage (compared to a 2 in BL (converted to
BR).

But in reality, I think there should be KE missiles, which would do the 1-12+
possible in BR as it was written, so I am confused :)

BTW, the Sylea has 30*ABS(-4)=120 lasers!, but only 30 can bear through a
given hexside.  The system as designed makes a task force big enough for a
few laser
laden escorts (CA sized) important if you want to keep the BB alive.

Also, the BL rules promised rules for damper *screens*, not just the single-
target turrrts listed, but we never got them.  We had thought about letting
the
ships attack their size class (abs value of) times the listed damper number
of
missiles.  Another possiblity would be to let each damper attack an entire
spread (any missiles launched at the same target from the same ship that
don\'t
take different routes are a spread).  That would at least make the big ships
less crippled by missile attack.

The same could be done with sand (that, or make it work like chaff/flares
from
the FFS rules).
 
> I don\'t see the usefulness of meson guns under the current rules systems.

Yeah, but if the Sylea was converted from High Guard it would have a missile 
factor that looks more like this:  M:10000(10000)  :)

Yup.  You have to put a cap on laser power (or power per unit FA, maybe) or
everything will go out of whack.

Also, that escort CA would have L(200 -5)10:1-1-0-0 with a size class of -3

Lot of little missile killer lasers pumped to -5 DM, of couse you\'d never
detect
the missiles in BL, but it\'s *easy* in BR (yet another problem :(  We give 
detection attempts with a passive sensor vs missiles a -2 if the missile used
any gturns (little missile, big burner)... and they\'re *still* hard to detect
before they blow up in your face!

    'topic' => 'Comments on Challenge 75 & New Damage System',
    'body' => '
After a long time of waiting I finally got an issue of the Challenge
75. Because I\'ve looked forward to this all Traveller issue since New
Year, I would like to make some comments on this magazine. First of
all, I\'ve to say that on the whole I like this issue, but (and there\'s
always a \'but\') some article show me again, why I hate and love
Traveller at the same time.

On sentence on the (back)cover: GDW really seems to have to save
money. The Challenge looks more than a catalog than a magazine. It
looks good but boring. But it\'s the contents that counts, isn\'t it.

The first adventure, "Undercity", is IMHO also the best one. Perhaps
it\'s because I like the "Oasis Pocket Empire" background, that is
detailed in the last article of Challenge 75. The adventure contains
an original setting, some good NPCs and a story which has much room
for roleplaying. As it reads it\'s only another smash and grab (SAG)
variant (even if with less smash) but with an emphasize on the NPCs. I
think, there\'s a great potential in this setting.

The other adventures, "Operation Wolf Snare", "The Long Fall Club" and
"The Madness Effect" have the Reformation Coalition as background. The
first two adventures are pure SAGs. Both adventures have a direct
combat action emphasized plot. As a general critic, I don\'t
understand, why all worlds outside the RC are evil dictatorships or
worlds where another subjective reason exists so that the RCES feels
justified to rob and murder. I think, GDW and most adventure-writer
forget, that the fall of the last Imperium is only 70 years ago.
There\'re still a lot of people around, who remember the old time. I
can\'t believe that humanity will fall back to such a primitive
level. As I understand, TL doesn\'t describe the civic level but only
the technology level. People don\'t became automatically primitive only
because they\'ve no computers anymore. So I don\'t understand the
primitive behavior of the Daaridaians in the "Wolf Snare" adventure
(the text stats that the world had industries before the fall, that is
at least TL5). Furthermore, the world Daariada is about 16 weeks away
of the RC core and wide outside the area of operation. So it\'s an
illegal operation, even for the RCES, as I understand. As a last
point, I would like to grumble about the TNE combat rules again, and
mention, that, if the player character wear the "standard RCES light
combat armor" -- as shown at the picture on page 27 -- the whole
combat mission become routine because no native or space pirate could
harm the players. No plan is needed, only targeting and shooting.

On most worlds, I would think, the RCES or other spacers would be the
long awaited rescue that could help with the rebuild of the world.
Perhaps people have now a strong distrust in computer (or even in the
whole technology) but most behavior would be to try to live peaceful
voluntarily on a lower TL.  In the first years after the collapse
there I strong idea of "this was the greatest war of humanity, there
shall not be no war anymore!" And such an idea could last over 50
years (as, for example, your history in europe shows) Back to the
Challenge...

The "Long Fall Club" adventure is built up on the idea that if the
others can\'t protect their property, it\'s my property. It\'s a briefing
- travel - combat - debriefing plot with no opportunity for roleplay
(at least that what I would call roleplaying.) However, it seems to be
a somewhat difficult combat mission (if not the players own that AV6
"standard RCES light battle armor" ;-).

The last adventure, "The Madness Effect", is a very untypical
adventure and a very interesting one, too. It as a little touch of
Horror games like Cthulhu. I like this adventure and would like to see
more adventures of this kind. Even if it\'s set in the RC, there are no
problems to transfer the adventure to any Traveller setting.

The description and the idea of the NPC "Karel Rossum" is IMHO one of
the best articles. However, I\'m afraid I can\'t say much more without
uncover his uncommon secret. This article could be combined this the
"Oasis" backgrounder or used in any other background.

The "Quick Start" characters and the pregenerated NPCs ("A Friend in
Need") are good articles, either.

"Planetfall", however, the not-mass-but-more-than-a-dozen combat
system has some flaws. (Btw, is this system compatible to the much
advertised "Striker II?") The idea is good, nearly as good as to use
this as the standard combat system. But I\'ve the same problems with
this system as with the TNE combat system. People will not die,
weapons will not wound.

As a concrete example look at the RQS and Vargr templates that are
supplied (as an outlook to the Regency source book? :-) at the end of
the article. I\'ll reproduce the templates here:

                         Init Fire Melee Armor Wnds

Init is normal TNE Initiative, Fire and Melee are combat assets, Armor
the armor value and Wnds the number of wounds. Instead of 40 hit
points, normal NPCs have 12 wounds, characters have STR+CON
wounds. Weapons will do as much wounds as there damage value is.

The RQS\'s are equipped with a snub pistol and an ACR. Let\'s forget the
pistol, it is useless because of the armor of the Vargr. The ACR will
do 4 wounds (DV 5, Pen 1) at near range.  Soldier A has a 25% chance
for an outstanding success, and a 50% chance for a normal hit. The
expectation value is a damage of 4, or 20 when firing a burst. That
kills any Vargr.

expected damage chart:

   A                               B
25% crit (8)                15% crit (8)
50% hit  (4) -> 4 / 20      50% hit  (4) --> 3.2 / 16
25% miss (0)   average      35% miss (0)      average

Firing bursts, all Vargr are dead (free sight assumed).

The Vargr are armed with pistols (forget them) and Assault Rifles (DV
4, Pen 2), doing 2 wounds against the RQS\'s. They\'ve no change, even
to kill A or B. As an additional flaw, the Vargr captain (A) should be
equipped only with a pistol (he\'s dead before combat starts).

   C                      D                    E
15% crit(4)           5% crit(4)          0% crit(4)
50% hit (2)->1.6/8   50% hit (2)->1.2/6  45% hit (2)->0.9/4.5
35% miss(0)  average 45% miss(0) average 55% miss(0)  average

The normal RCES soldier would look like F (as from the pictures), a
player character perhaps like G (as the two soldiers in my groups do)

                          Init Fire Melee Armor Wnds
F RCES Marine (Veteran)    4    13   13     6    14
G Lancer (rated as Elite)  6    16   16     6    20

All weapons of the RQS or Vargr are useless, the RCES\'s would perhaps
carry ACRs or LAGs. Even with an Armor=2 there\'re (nearly) invincible.

I think, it\'s more realistic, that with higher TL, not only armor
protection but also the weapon damage will increase. (How this will
happen, is left as an exercise for the reader :-) The AV6-battle dress
is TL12, so a TL12 small arms weapon should be able to penetrate this
armor. As a solution for this problem I would suggest Penetration
values of 1/2, 1/4 or 1/3.

* An ACR with "crystaniron uranium armor piercing" (CUAP to give the
  child a name) rounds should have a Pen of 1/2 instead of 1). CUAPs are
  available at TL10. (rules like DS, but Pen-2)

* Crystaniron uranium ultra explosive (CUUE, TL11) rounds are improved
  HE rounds, don\'t subtract 7 when calculating the explosive energy.
  (This rule isn\'t perfect)

* Superdense high velocity (SDHV, TL12) are actual small rocket guns
  and reduce Pen from 1 to 1/4 or Nil to 1 at near range (else like CUAP).

* Superdense high explosive (DSUE, TL12) are improved HEAPs with a
  1-1-1 penetration. Don\'t subtract 7 when calculating the explosive
  energy.

* Superdense explosive armor piercing (EAP) are the state of the art
  TL14 rounds, designed for maximum penetration (2->1/2, 1->1/4, nil->1)
  and maximum damage. (Pen/4, don\'t subtract 7)

(Oh, that\'s fun. I\'ll try to design something useful...)

When calculating armor protection, round 0.5 to 1 and 0.25 to 0. A
5.5x45mm SDHV-12 round has a DV of 5 - 6 * 1/4 = 5 - 1.5 ==> 5 - 2 = 3
against my beloved AV6 armor. A 9x44mm SDHE-12 round could kill a AV1
protected soldier doing DV16 at an outstanding success. That looks
better (IHMO).

Hm, I would now give (normal) NPCs 12 wounds and players (and
important NPCs) (STR+CON)/2+6 wounds.

Wounds (W)  Effect
< 0         dead (perhaps only critical wounded in case of PCs)
< 3 (1/4W)  critical wounded
< 6 (1/2W)  serious wounded
<12 (W-1)   slightly wounded

For hit locations, I would distribute the wounds as follows:

HL   Wounds   Effect
Arm  3 (1/4W) <0 arm useless, have to drop all things carried.
Leg  4 (1/3W) <0 leg useless, can\'t walk or stand.
Head 3 (1/4W) <0 dead (that\'s live)
Cest 6 (1/2W) <0 critical wounded, can\'t move arms or legs
Abd. 4 (1/3W) <0 serious wounded, can\'t move legs

Each damage is also subtracted from total hitpoints. Arms and Legs
cant only absorb twice the maximal wounds. All other damage is
lost. If an arm or leg is reduced by more than twice the maximal
wounds, the part of the body is destroyed. (This damage system is
somewhat like RuneQuest)

Example: An type B RQS marine has 16 total wounds. He\'s hit for 4
wounds in the left leg. Now he has only 12 total wounds and his left
leg has 1 of 5 wounds left. Again he\'s hit, left arm, 5 wounds. His
arm has now -1 of 4 wounds, the total wounds are reduced to 7 (he\'s
now serious wounded). Because his arm has less than zero wounds left,
he can\'t use his ACR anymore and he has to draw his pistol.  Another
hit, 12 wounds, again the left arm, would reduce his wounds only to -4
and his total wounds to 4. However, the arm doesn\'t look well and is
total useless. He\'s now nearly critical wounded and decided to become
unconscious.

What do you think about these changes? I really wish to hear some
comments.

Now I\'m total off topic and I\'ve not mentioned that the Callenge 75
also contains two deck plans of the 600t Liner and the 400t Corsair.
And I\'ve not ask whether anyone here has further informations about
the region of the Oasis subsector.

The Sweeper is a TL9/10, 6 bbl light automatic weapon firing the 2x12N ETC
cartridge developed for it by Pendang South Armory.  It is completely
experimental, though reportedly at least one example has been combat
tested with "good results".

Relevant statistics:
Weapon Designation: PSA-18 Light Area Assault Weapon
Weapon Nickname: Sweeper
Mass: 5.9kg empty, 7.9kg with empty 6,000 rnd cassette, 10.1 kg loaded
Length: 40cm (blk = 2)

					(std. ball is Cr45 per cassette)
Range: Short 18m Medium 36m Long 72m Extreme 144m (with DS ammo, 15/30/60/120
							with std. ball)
ROF: User selectable 1, 3, 10, 20 "short" bursts, or 50 shot "long" burst
Recoil: 0 with all short bursts, 1 with long burst

Features: TL 10 Laser Sights, supressors (one per bbl), TL 10 gyro comp,

[Design info: 2x12 necked ETC ammo TL-9, Wa=0.377g, Ea=157J, Bla=19.625 cm
		Bl=20cm, 6 hvy bbl, heavy self loading deluxe multibbl reciever
		plus features listed above]

The Sweeper was designed in early 1200 as a private project by the 
Pendang South Armory, using a mixture of TL-9 components and limited TL-10
elements which were locally experimental.  This bold combination let the
weapon achive a huge rate of fire (cyclic rate exceeding 3,000 RPM) and
yet show less per-burst recoil than virtually any other SMG design available.
The user selectable short burst combined with a progressive trigger pull to
select the "long" burst or continuous fire option proved very popular
with troops, especially in a design purpose-designed for "rock and roll".

In late 1200 the company began field testing it, and in an amazing turn of
events a Pendang Broadcasting Service crew doing a nature documentary on
jungle life in the southern jungles was single-handedly saved from a herd
of rampaging Kikk-leopards (40 kg felinoid pack hunters, extremely rare) 
by ex-Major Konrad Chin, PSA\'s principle test and evaluation engineer.  

The film of that rescue impressed Pendang\'s government so much that an order
for 100 units was placed immediately for "evaluation purposes".  PSA has been
having production problems ramping up to produce that many units, but
a number of examples have been deployed within the military.  The initial
results are so positive that the Pendang government has recently talked
of nationalizing the production operations of PSA to improve output,
with interest in ordering perhaps 100,000 weapons over the next few years.

I always keep forgetting something.  In this case, the ETC additional
mass/cost in the magazine due to the battery...

Having looked at that rule, I am employing a Field Rules Adjustment.
If you look at it, the battery in the magazine is fixed mass no matter
what E the cartridge has.  I think that it should properly be some
adjustable amount, a constant fraction relative to cartridge energy.
So... given that they liked the values given for their 7x46 ETC ACR,
and it has 30 times the Ea of my 2x12N ETC cartridge, I divided the
battery mass by 30.  So there.  Results are...

Mag capacity for PSA-18 is now 3,000 from 6,000.  Cassette is same mass
(4.23 kg loaded), costs Cr500 additional over gun cost (the battery price).

And a derrivative toy.  Introducing the highly experimental PSA-19...

Relevant statistics:
Weapon Designation: PSA-19X Medium Area Assault Weapon
Weapon Nickname: Pushbroom
Mass: 10.6kg empty, 13.7kg with empty 3,000 rnd cassette, 14.9 kg loaded

Cost: Cr4,969 incl 1 cassette, full cassette of 2x12N ETC DS ammo is Cr45

Actual Recoil with continuous fire (5 bursts) is 4 for the whole turn, not 5.
Rcl as calculated w/o rounding is 0.733

[Design info: 2x12 necked ETC ammo TL-9, Wa=0.377g, Ea=157J, Bla=19.625 cm
		Bl=46cm, 6 hvy bbl, heavy self loading deluxe multibbl reciever
		plus features listed above]

Also newly introduced is the (new) 6,000 round cassette, mass 6.46 kg loaded,
Cr1,000 each, full load of Ds is Cr90, full load of ball is Cr45.  This has
so far only been produced in quantity 3 units, and is NOT deployed with any
of the field test PSA-18\'s, but will be soon if it proves as reliable as
the smaller magazine.  It is intended for use with the PSA-19 but fits
either weapon interchangably.

South Pendang Armory has produced five experimental PSA-19\'s after someone
observed that a longer barrel would give the weapon rifle-like range without
sacrificing the low recoil or rate of fire.  The only changes from the PSA-18
are barrel length (46 cm instead of 20 cm) and longer supressors to deal with
the slightly higher muzzle energy.  All other components are the same.
The weapons recoil actually dropped a small amount for extended bursts.

Yes, Loren, it\'s me again.

Just a reminder about my space force question.  Just for repition\'s sake:
    Why do high-population systems have much fewer men - and therefore  
    starship\'s - in their navy?  This seems very conter-intuitive to me!

Several people have pointed out that GDW\'s stress on Gas Giant Refuelling 
is economically non-viable: as I understand it, the time spent travelling 
from the gas giant to the mainworld destroy\'s any benefit from free 
refuelling.

Can anyone here come up with the *real* reason why starship\'s like to 
jump to & from gas giant\'s?  Perhaps jump astrogating is easier from 
their vicinity?

Hi all,

I just finished a novel which I thought other Traveller fans
may find enjoyable.

The book is 

The War Machine, Crisis of Empire III by
Roger MacBride Allen and David Drake

Now normally I\'m not a big fan of David Drake (apart from
the first Hammer\'s Slammers, I\'ve never thought he was very 
original or insightful. I bought this one used and didn\'t 
hae high expectations. I was impressed with it and read it 
quickly over two nights. 

The book covers several topics of interest to the TML. Discussions
of jump mechanics, insystem jumps, fleet combat, and ancient 
virus-like aliens are included in a standard space opera setting. 

I don\'t know if it is still in print. I read volume III without 
reading I or II and it wasn\'t diminished. 

The novel reminded me of The Mote in God\'s Eye (one of my all-time
favorites) but with more of a traveller feel. This was TNE at its
best. Several plot devices have long been staples in my campaign
(which I won\'t discuss here to prevent spoilers).

TTFN,

Glenn

 The Clipper comes in three separate blister packs.  The first is the basic
Clipper, just the two hulls and the spine.  The other two pack are modules
of various sorts. One includes the Manta and several non-descript modules.
The other has what looks like a monsterous side-mounted accelerator, and
several weapons modules.

 The other three _may_ be in consistent scale, but I canÕt be sure. The
Broadsword comes in two halves and the LinerÕs forward disk is separate, as
are the sensor booms of the Donosev.  The Liner and the Donosev are probably
fairly close in scale, but I think the Broadsword is off.  All look good
on their own, however.

Keipes (0132 B677884-6) declares the fourth Empire after the sudden
death of Tekim Hsun, Grand Master of the Order of Revealed Knowledge.
    The Grand Master and 31 members of the Order were killed by an
accident while demonstrating a relict TL13 grav tank.  We have
information about excavations at the destroyed Imperial navy base.
Whether the tank is realy a relic or an outworld import is not know
yet.  It appears that the "accient" was a carfully planed murder
attempt.  Elite troops of Grand Duke Eledo of Balawak blocked the
whole region.
    On the next day, Kim Eoi was declared as new Grand Master.  She\'s
known as a progressive force in the Order of Revealed Knowledge.  A
wave of arestments were noticed by our agents in Peidoan, capital of
Keipes, and in other cities.  Duke Eledo declares martial law for the
next two months.
    The days later, Grand Master Kim Eoi declares the the Moot will be
reastablished with all Nobility (we know about 22) of Keipes having a
vote and the Order having veto right. The Moot should elect a new
regent within two weeks. Duke Eledo declares this day as an holyday.
    The local news system announces the beginning of a new era. The
Order of Revealed Knowledge has done a good job, perserving know
needed wisdom and develloping "methods" to banish the all destroying
virus. But know, each citizen has the duty to help the reastablishing
the new and better empire.
    Our agents had found indications of offworlder activities.  One
picture shows three human-looking persons wearing the old imperial
combat armors.  A detailed plan exists to restructure the Keipes
economy and to raise the TL within one year.

	Fav Prime was a large independent mining factory with a space

	the energy plants, all workers died.

	The moon Nio held a small military base with 292 soldiers.
	This base was totally destroyed through a vampire ship attack
	in 1145.

	The moon Hsui of Peyateo of has a protected high tech research
	base.  Perhaps, this base wasn\'t discovered by the virus and
	Dr. Penui Deo and her assistants might have survided in low
	berth.

	Of some interest is also the moon Czakim which could be easily
	terraformed (clean the tainted atmosphere) or could perhaps be
	the homeworld of a minor race (the Czaki). Then Czakim would
	look like this: Ulbuam X897545-0 (681.000 inhabitants, 0.6g)

The only reason I can think of is when you are jumping through a system
and want to refuel there but not stop there (e.g., a jump-1 ship travelling
between two wealthy worlds jump-2 apart with a colony of poverty-stricken
homicidal barbarians in between.)

Or, of course, during military maneuvers for secrecy (refuel at minor-
system gas giant, jump to target) or because there were no bases in the
area.  (Actually, given the size of Oort clouds, most powers probably have
them seeded with tankers, secret refuelling bases, and the like.  Yes,
this means that the Virus got through the Regency borders long ago. <grin>)

I can\'t think of any real reason, unless the mainworld is orbiting the 
gas giant. But gas giants got more military significance in TNE than 
in MT when the fuel consumtion has sky rocketed. The capture of, or 
prevention of that, of gas giants is esential to manage to comitt 
fleetforces to a system, unless you will make yourself dependent on 
defenseless tankers.

I predict that gas giants will be the focus for battle before the 
siege of the mainworld begins.

comments anyone?

Someone, I can\'t remember who, already provided a very good answer to
this.  Using the older world generation system (ie - Scouts), many
"mainworlds" actually ORBITED Gas Giants.

Regina is an example of such a world.

In those cases, GG refuelling would be economical, and an attacking

While refueling at a gas giant in a remote system, sensors indicate a very
faint incoming transmission.  At first it seems to be a random series of
numbers, but computer analysis indicates it is a data stream, compressed
using a method long out of date (from the Last Imperium if adventure is
set in the New Era universe).  Triangulation indicates the transmission is
just above the pressure horizon (max depth into the atmosphere) for the
ship and spacesuits the party is using.  The source also appears to be
slowly sinking - if the party decides to go down they will only have a
limited time to do so.  The exact time is up to the GM, but should be
short enough to prevent the players from going for help. 

If the players investigate, skill rolls for piloting and sensor ops are
appropriate.  The object will turn out to be a large (1000 ton
displacement) sphere with rather obvious dents and other damage, which
reveal that the sphere is very heavily armored.  Sensors indicate low
power.  If the players have a neural activity scanner, they will get no
readings.  There are no obvious markings.

REFEREE INFORMATION

-Classic Traveller or Megatraveller Version-
The object is a scientific probe used to explore the interior of gas 
giants, collecting data and taking samples.  It is designed to descend 
and ascend on a regular basis - apparently the scientific team that was 
collecting the data is no longer here for some reason (see below).  The 
probe will open for maintnence and sample retrieval if a code is 
transmitted - the players should be given some way of figuring this out 
(a small panel on the hull, an entry in a databank on their own ship, 
decoding the data transmission, etc.) 

1) The scientific team left because it thought the probe was destroyed - 
it was only damaged and took much longer to come to the surface.  If the 
players go on board, they may be able to fix the probe and download the 
data collected.  This will be a race against time, as the probe slowly 
sinks into the atmosphere.  If the players find the scientific 
organisation that placed the probe, they will be rewarded in some 
suitable way.

2) As 1 above, but the probe is damaged beyond repair.  The players may 
be able to salvage some of the sensor equipment.

3) As 1 above, but pirates are using the probe as bait - they will attack 
the players during the salvage operation.

4) As 1 above, but the probe has brought with it some Blobs (tm) from down 
below.  The blobs are unintelligent, fearless, and in pain - they attack the 
players, of course.  Adjust number and strength of Blobs (tm) to 
challenge players.

5) As 4 above, but these are Smart Blobs (tm).  In fact, it\'s a team of
Smart Blob (tm) scientists and explorers (Smart Blob (tm) player
characters, of course), and they and their friends down below captured the
probe and are now using it to explore the upper atmosphere.  They are
excited to meet these strange carbon-based life forms, and would like to
set up trade relations.  If they play their cards right, the players could
wind up rich and famous. 

6) As 5 above, but these are Evil Super-Smart Blobs (tm).  They want to 
take the players with them as samples, and will stop at nothing.  Good 
luck surviving high pressure.

-New Era Additions-

The above scenarios can be complicated by the presence of a Virus in 
the probe\'s computer.  The exact type is up to the GM, but a "Hobbyist" 
strain is most appropriate.  The hobbyist virus, if contacted, will be 
happy to talk about the gas giant and how fun it is going up and down 
in the atmosphere, and will even cooperate with the players if they help 
fix its broken systems.


Note: Blobs (tm) appear courtesy of GDW\'s Azhanti High Lightning game; Smart
Blobs (tm) and Evil Super-Smart Blobs (tm) appear courtesy of several twisted
campaigns run by yours truely.

	First of all, are there any guidelines for the max weight or 
ground pressure of ground vehicles?  The current rules make no mention of 
this, but ignoring it gives essentially free reign to have 150 ton 
tanks.  Even worse, there are no rules for how heavy I can make my 
hovertanks.  I assume that at some point the hoverfans cannot produce 
sufficient pressure to keep the vehicle aloft.
	The second question regards AZHRAE vehicles.  The section on 
thrusters states clearly that the RAM stage only works beyond 800 KPH, so 
one needs to use the turbojet stage until then.  I\'ve simply used the 
vehicles g-rating to determine the time it takes to accelerate to this 
point.  Not a problem.  But how do you determine when you need to switch 
over to the rocket motor?  I assume this is related to altitude and 
oxygen levels, but I don\'t know enough about RAMjets to figure this out 
for a standard atmosphere, 1 G planet, let alone all possible 
variations.  Any ideas?
	Lastly, without gravitic technology I can\'t very well have SD

Some kind of composite?  Diamond?

Refer your xmission 25/11/5720.  We concur that incoming
craft is most likely sub-light colony ship launched from
Terra in mid 21st Century.

The colonists carry with them tools, materiel and know-
ledge necessary for TL 8 to 10 industrial production.  In
Mirabilis\' current context, this is of extreme importance.
The nation that allies with the colonists will, in a short
space of time, dominate the planet.

Given your current mission on Mirabilis, it is vital to
Commonwealth interests that the colonists ally with the 
Republic of Varangia.  Your orders are to do everything
possible to create such an alliance.

Note that current combat and engagement restrictions still
apply.

Xmission ends...


The characters are members of the Near Bootes Commonwealth 
Expeditionary Force, part of a Contact and Liason team on
Mirabilis.  Mirabilis is like many habitable worlds after 
the Virus struck - struggling to maintain a TL 4 economy,
and fragmented into a number of nation-states.

Your C&L team has estsablished relations with the Republic
of Varangia, a (relatively) progressive and democratic 
nation on Mirabilis\' eastern land mass.  Varangia is the
nation most likely to countenance Mirabilis\' eventual 
incorporation into the Commonwealth.  Your team\'s ultimate
goal is to bring Varangia into a position of political 
dominance on the planet.

Two months ago, Varangian astronbomers discovered an
unknown object on a hyperbolic course towards the inner
system.  The object was decelerating.  Despite the 
absence of much historical data, Varangian researchers
were able to identify the craft as a Terran colony ship,
launched before Terrans discovered the jump drive in
AD 2089.

Unfortunately for Varangia, unfriendly agents have 
passed this information on to their governments.  Now,
the race is on strike up an alliance.  Rival governments
will stop at nothing to win this race - the stakes are
high.

Referee\'s Information :-
----

The ship in question is the UNCS "New South Wales", 
launched in AD 2047 by the United Nations Repatriation
and Relocation Agency.  The ship is home to twenty 
thousand colonists in low berths.  Crew is rotated 
amongst the colonists.

The colonists were fleeing one of the most turbulent
periods of Terran history.  Many are political 
dissadents and malcontents escaping repressive regimes, 
others are refugees from war zones.  At any rate, they
are a mixed bunch, and are likely to be as fragmented
as the people of Mirabilis.

Between the Mirabilans and the colonists, the stage is
set for double-dealing, betrayal and intrigue on a 
grand scale.  When so much is at stake, the potential
for a healthy dose of violence can\'t be ignored either.

The Near Bootes Commonwealth is my own campaign setting,
for the Reformation Coalition or another pocket empire, 
use any habitable world near the empire\'s borders.  For
added effect, have a rival empire doing the same thing
for one of Varangia\'s rivals.

-Classic Traveller-
The player group is hired by an ex-Imperial Navy Captain for an 
expedition.  He will tell the players that his father was an itinerant 
asteroid miner who was lost in a misjump when the Captain was young.  His 
father\'s ship was recently discovered, and the Captain has the records 
from the last jump.  His father and the crew came out in empty space, 
only to find a large asteroid-like body.  His father and several of the 
crew went to explore the asteroid, but never came back.  The one 
remaining crew member set the ship on course for the nearest system, but 
his low berth failed before the ship was found.  The Captain wants to 
travel to the asteroid and find out what happened to his father.

-MegaTraveller-
Set up will be much the same, but the father\'s ship was attacked when it 
returned to the system in the middle of a battle of the Rebellion, which 
killed the remaining crewmember (not the failure of the low berth).

-New Era_
The Classic Traveller set-up can be used in the Regency.  For the RC or a 
Pocket Empire, the Captain is looking for his grandfather rather than his 
father.

1) The situation is exactly as it seems.  The asteroid is plain rock.  
The Captain\'s father and his fellow crew were killed by faulty equipment.

2) As 1, but the asteroid has rich deposits of ore that can be worked.

3) As 1, but the Captain\'s father was abandoned on the asteroid on 
purpose by the crewmember.  The father left a message explaining what 
happened.

4) As 3, but the "Captain" is actually the crewmember who left the father 
for dead, and has returned out of guilt.  The players should be given a 
series of clues to this respect.  The asteroid contains nothing valuable.

5) As 4, but the crewmember has returned for valuables hidden on the 
asteroid.

6) The introduction is all a cover story.  The Captain is an active member
of a secret service appropriate to the setting and time of the campaign. 
The asteroid is a secret cache of fuel, parts and weapons maintained by an
enemy of the local political entity that the Captain learned about during
his service.  He plans to use the players to discover this and use the 
cover story to prevent the enemy from learning their codes have been 
compromised.

7) As 6, but the Captain has gone rogue and plans to kill the players and 
steal as much as he can from the facility for sale on the black market.

8) The Asteroid is a generation ship and the father is alive aboard.  He 
was abandoned by the crew member on the ship, who panicked when the father 
didn\'t return promptly.  The people on the asteroid are friendly and 
interrested in getting to civilization and in trade.

9) As 8, but the asteroid\'s inhabitants just want to be left alone.  They 
are not interested in trade, but they will return the Captain\'s father.

10) As 8, but the asteroid\'s inhabitants are violently xenophobic, and 
will fight to destroy the player\'s group.  They are technologically less 
sophisticated than players, however, so the Captain\'s father can be 
rescued if things are done right.

  thanks for the adventure seeds and keep them coming, I like them at least.

With regards to the second seed, an 11th explanation struck me 
immediately.  Anybody played or seen a CD game for the PC called 
Creature Shock?

The basic plot is vaguely similar.  A survey ship complete with 
prototype fighter/weapon has gone missing in the asteroids and you have 
to find out what happened to it exactly.  The ships distress beacon 
contains footage of the disaster.  What actually happened is that when 
the ship passed close to the asteroid, tentacular pseudopods lashed out 
and arrested it\'s forward motion.  This caused an explosion in the 
drive section and supposedly the death of the crew.  The ship is now 
resting partially embedded in the asteroid.

The asteroid is vaguely alive and is under the control of a superior 
alien type.  It also contains samples of various dangerous life forms 
that have been collected including a polymorph which can duplicate the 
captain of the missing ship.

Integration of this idea into Mark\'s adventure seed could run along the 
following lines.

11)  The asteroid mining ship came out of jump near the asteroid.  
After a routine densiometer scan the crew noted the presence of heavy 
metals, unknown compounds and deep caverns in the rock.  All the crew 
bar one went over in vacc suits to investigate the possibility of this 
being an ancient artifact (or an abandoned military rock throwing 
project).  The interior had an atmosphere (lo-pressure, tainted).  They 
encountered hostile life forms, seemingly degenerated technological 
beings,  which the crew dealt with.  After a period of exploration the 
crew came under attack by a large creature of some sort and were 
quickly killed.  The remaining crew member on the ship engaged the jump 
drive and left.  After a period of six months, during which he prepared 
his story and gathered some cash, he contacted the PC\'s with his bogus story.

If you get a chance have a look at Creature Shock, it\'s very impressive 
visually, but you need to see section 2 and on to get a feel for this 
asteroid.

I\'m not Loren, but I\'ll take a swing.  Starships are expensive.  They\'re
so expensive that a HiPop world can\'t afford to have that many.  But a
lower population world may have a higher percentage in the navy since
they need to have more ships proportionally than the HiPop worlds.  In
a sense, the HiPop worlds can economize a bit here because of the 
economies of scale involved.

>Can anyone here come up with the *real* reason why starship\'s like to

>their vicinity? 

A system with a truly lousy planet and starport might have no source
of fuel available, requiring use of the gas giant.  Yes, this would
make it a *serious* backwater.

Long-range trade route merchant shipping might use gas giant refueling
if they aren\'t going to stop in a system.  Then it might be cheaper 
than maneuvering down and buying unrefined fuel, even with the bigger
jump limit involved.  Heck, not dealing with Imperial Starport
Authority paperwork may make it faster on the route. :)  This sort
of operation gets expensive, of course, so the profit has to be pretty
good.  I can see Tukera Lines trying this.

Of course, if you want real fast transport, you have to cut out the
gas giant altogether and go to the xboat system\'s tender approach,
where you bring the fuel out to the ship.  Since the tender would
have to know the transport\'s exit point, I can see some problems
with pirates possible here.  The xboat system is actually even faster
than that, since they transport electronic information and can
shift the "cargo" from the arriving ship to a fully refueled ship
faster than they could refuel the arriving ship and send it off
again.  This, of course, is even more expensive, since it involves
keeping a few extra ships around, but it\'s better in a large-scale
continuous operation like the xboat network. 

Besides the other military operations mentioned, it would be useful 
in a case where an invading fleet doesn\'t want to take the mainworld
of the Podunk system, but it\'s in a strategic position on the way to
Rhylanor, so the mainworld is bypassed, the fleet refuels, and jumps
on.  The benefit is that you don\'t get your fleet whittled away by
attacking a bunch of less consequential planets.  Of course, then
you run the risk of having your supply line cut off, or worse things
happening behind you, but it\'s a calculated risk.

Yeah, this is a *major* omission, I spotted it straight away, (this may
have been due to the fact that I\'d just been to a lecture on AFV design).
ISTR that Striker and MT had rules for this, I\'ll have to dig them out and

Yup, that\'s it.  Divide the target\'s armor by 6, and that is how many points
you subtract from the damage value (the amount of "damage" used up burning a
hole through the armor).

I have it on good authority that you\'re much better off using the
combat rules in Brilliant Lances, but...

The 1/6 (say) is the Penetration Rating (PR), the 20 Damage Points is
the Damage Value (DV)

What you do is, you multiply the Armor Value of the TARGET by the
Penetration RATING of the Laser, and that is how many Points of
Damage Value that you lose penetrating the Armor.

So, take a ship with an Armor Value of 60.

60 * 1/6 = 10.  10 Damage Points are used up penetrating the Armor.

20 - 10 = 10, so 10 Damage Points get through to mess with things
inside.  Note also that the Critical Table is erroneously labeled.
It\'s Damage Value which Penetrates vs. Target Size Class (rather
than Penetration Value which Penetrates, as the table says) that
determines the number of criticals done.  Lasers would be even
more powerful than they already are otherwise.

Hopeth this helpeth.

If they were xenophobic, why would they keep the Captain\'s father
alive. I would assume they shot him right off the bat.  The Captain
would want revenge and want to destroy the entire ship, probably an
easy job for the players and their hi-tech ship.  the Players would
have to decide if they would help him or stop him.  If they stopped
him, they probably won\'t get paid....

Thanks.  I was hoping I would encourage others to do the same - seems to

You most certainly may.  Could you send me the address of the page (if
there is such a thing)?  I haven\'t bothered to learn about WWW yet - a
Traveller page would give me the incentive to make the effort.

Setting: Planet with Pop 8+, Gov 3+, Tech 9+

Player Information: Arriving on planet, the players find the local
government has instituted a unique form of currency: biomoney.  In order
to encourage spending and increase the velocity of money (the number of
times a unit of currency changes hands per unit of time), all currency is
alive.  To keep it alive, it must be kept next to the skin .  However, the
money gradually becomes allergic to the person who is carrying it, so it
must be spent within 7 days or it dies and is no longer legal tender. 

All transactions of 1000 credits or less must be paid for in biomoney, and
the first 1000 credits of all salaries and compensation is paid in
biomoney.  This means the players will have no choice about using biomoney
if they visit the planet (as a good GM will insure happens). 

What the currency looks and feels like is up to the GM, though it is
suggested that it should be rather disgusting (that encourages people
to spend it as quickly as possible). 

Complications: 
1) One of the characters turns out to be allergic to the
biomoney and becomes deathly ill with a nasty rash.  However, money kept
next to his skin does not die, even after seven days.  Complications 
include cruel fellow players, criminals who want to exploit the player to 
hide their money, the planet\'s currency police, etc. 

2) A local underground group contacts the players and asks them to take a
sample of the biomoney off-world for analysis.  They are convinced the
money is poisoning people, but the government is covering it up.  The
truth of the matter is up to the GM.


Note: This is really more of an encounter than a true adventure seed.  It 
was inspired by a description of a Traveller gaming session I read years 
ago, where one of the things the players encountered was, I swear, an 
alien animal that looked like an "inside-out rat."  My immediate thought 
was, "What if the players were forced to handle inside-out rats on a 
regular basis?"  I know, I\'m sick, but then again, most GMs are...

Good point, Lewis - I didn\'t think this through.  Two possible 
explanations.  One, the xenophobic inhabitants have some moral or 
religeous code against killing, so they have kept the Captain\'s father 
alive.  This would also help the characters, since if they lost they\'d be 
captured rather than killed.  Two, perhaps they are xenophobic due to the 
Captain\'s father, who has gone mildly insane from being abandoned and 
thinks one of the players is the guy who abandoned him. The asteroid 
people are xenophobic because of the paranoid stories the Captain\'s 
father is telling them. 

Of course, it could just be that the Captain\'s father is dead, and so now 
it\'s time for revenge.  

Finally, here\'s idea 12:

12) As 8, only all the asteroid inhabitants are dead.  They died from a 
disease they got after they ate the Captain\'s father and his buddies raw 
in a barbaric ceremony.  The players are free to loot the asteroid.

clean.  Dirt, dust, and waste products can clog filters, line ductwork, 
and generally make the ship look and smell like a pigpen.  Ship\'s with 
sub-standard life support systems, such as the standard type S Imperial 
scout, are even more prone to problems of bad smells and mold growth.

As an aside, one of the biggest problems is the ship\'s crew and passenger
complement.  Humans sweat, cough, and most notably, slowly shed their hair
and skin.  In a starship, as in dirtside dwellings, as much as 90% of dust
and grime is human hair and exfoliated human skin, which is a lovely food
source for microbes. 

The schloobie, a genetically engineered animal first produced in the 
Solomani sphere but now generally avalible in Imperial space, is one 
solution to this problem.  Looking rather like a furry rug, the schloobie 
has no bones - it moves by a rythmic motion of its hair.  It can flow 
into the smallest spaces, and eats a wide range of organic materials, 
including dead human skin, mold, and other organics.  It keeps ductwork 
and crew quarters clean, eliminating the need to dust most surfaces.

Schloobies mass roughly 2 kilos, and come in a wide variety of colors so 
that one can match them to a ship\'s decor.  They live from three to five 
years.  They do not reproduce - they are in effect manufactured by 
biotech companies.

A typical ship will carry one schloobie for every 10 persons on board - 
luxury liners often carry more to insure higher standards of cleanliness.

Shloobies can also be used as a substitute for showers or baths.  When 
rubbed over the body, they remove dead skin and dirt, though care must be 
taken to avoid removing hair, since a schloobie left on too long will 
digest it.  As a result, schloobies are common on desert worlds and other 
places where water is scarce.

Schloobies work best with Human or Vargr waste, since they are designed 
to digest organics based on Terran biology.  Vargr do not care for 
schloobies, however, since they often will eat a vargr\'s fur while he sleeps.

    This is a proposal for a TCS game, which I will referee given
that enough interest is shown.

    My purpose is twofold:
        1)  to learn something about the formation of interstellar
governments in a power vacuum,
        2)  to learn something about what works using FF&S technology.

    Hopefully, the players will have a chance to
        1)  learn something about what works using FF&S technology
        2)  have a good time pounding each other with advanced
technological weaponry...


    The game will require four or more players, each running an
"empire", plus any others that are interested in playing the parts
of admirals/generals/governors subordinate to the main players.
    Note that this game is primarily strategic and operational, NOT
tactical, despite what "TCS" may imply...

SETUP:

    The Imperial Era ended about 700 years before the present, with
the complete collapse of the human-dominated Third Imperium and 
surrounding interstellar states.
    You (the players) have just recovered Jump technology, placing
you in the forefront of the return to space.  You have no contact 
with anyone else at this point.  You have no clue whether there IS
anyone else left, in fact.  Think of yourselves as like the RC, but 
not as stupid...:-)

    There will be two types of initial position to choose from:

        1)  You start with one planet, population between one and
two billion, TL-10 with TL-11 J-drives.
                            or
        2)  You start with one country on a balkanized world,
population between 200 million and 300 million, TL-11 across the
board.

    I am willing to listen to other setup ideas anyone is
interested in playing, though handicaps will be put in place to
prevent any player from having an overwhelmingly superior start
position (assuming I can spot the advantage, anyway).  Note that
_absolute_maximum_starting_TL_ is 12.  Don\'t even bother asking
for higher...
    Those of you who choose to be on a balkanized world are the 
leading technological power on your world.  Note that secondary
powers on your world may begin space exploration/exploitation as
soon as you lead the way by launching a ship (that is, they start
building a ship on "turn 2").

    A little free information for the players, that your personas
in the game will not have:

        1)  there are three or more other players, which means 
three or more other interstellar states.
        2)  IMPORTANT:  There are also two spacefaring "NPC"
races - both unpleasant.
    One will do its best to conquer you if you contact them.  The
other will do its best to obliterate you.
    The first of the above will not have Jump until/unless they
can take it away from one of you (or another spacefaring NPC).
The second will have Jump, but will be restricted from leaving its
"home space" till they discover your presence...
        3)  all other NPCs will have minimal spacefaring capability
at the beginning of the game.  They will begin working on Jump at
the moment of contact by an interstellar power.


TECHNICAL DETAILS:

    This game will use FF&S design rules for equipment, with
modifications.  Interested parties will be informed of the mods
being used.  Economic rules will be based closely on WTH, ditto
the ground combat rules.
    Build rates will be straight out of TCS to start.

    Each player will be issued a listing of all stars within ten
parsecs of your homeworld.  Note that you will all be using a 
coordinate system based on your homeworld, so hex numbers will
not give any clues about the "big map".
    The "big map" will be used by me to track players and NPCs.
It will be a 30 parsec radius circle (well, hexagon, actually),
which covers pretty close to two sectors worth of space.  Note
that the "big map" will be centered either in the Spinward 
Marches or the Solomani Rim, for those who  like to amuse them-
selves by finding out where they are, and what lies beyond the
edge of the map...
    In addition, each player will be expected to either:
        1)  be a minor human race,
                            or
        2)  generate his/her/its own homesystem.

    Note that in the latter case, there will be no insystem 
development allowed until the game begins.
    Note that in EITHER case, you will be allowed to choose your
own government types and law levels.  The referee (me) will then
use your choices to harass you endlessly, no matter what they
are...;-)

    "Victory conditions" will be up to each player.  You tell me
what "victory conditions" you wish to work toward.  I will
determine final "victory" based on the extent to which each of
you achieved your "victory conditions", and the difficulty of
achieving those conditions.
    This way, you will not be locked into achieving any specific
conditions, whcih specific conditions may not fit with either
your personality or your strategy...

    In any case, starting fleets will consist of one (1) ship of
400T or less per player.  This will represent the first starship 
built by each player since the end of the Imperial Era.  Note that
cost of this ship is irrelevant, except for maintenance purposes.
    Starting armies will be based on Striker II guidelines, with
any player starting on a balkanized world considered "warlike",
and any other player considered "peaceful".  Starting armies will
be pretty generic, but you may tailor them to your tastes once 
the game begins...

    During the initial period of the game, each player will be
operating asynchronously.  That is, I will process each (one year)
turn as fast as it is sent to me.  As soon as you make contact
with another player (or an NPC), you will become synchronous with
that player/NPC and anyone HE/SHE/IT is in contact with.  This will
continue until all players are in contact.
    Any new players that are added will also operate asynchronously
until he/she/it is in contact with someone.  This includes players
who are knocked out of the game and who wish to return to the game
under a new guise.

    R&D will operate similarly to that in my previous game - you
describe to me the desired result of the program, and throw money
at it till I tell you that you have something.  Note that ANYTHING
described in FF&S can be researched in this game.  Further note
that everything that doesn\'t fit the "standard Trav" picture will
be MUCH harder to achieve (things like Stutterwarp, for instance).



    The game will begin as soon as four people have chosen to become
players.  I already have one (she won\'t be Sir Reginald this time,
though ;-) ).  At that point, I will begin accepting turns just as
fast as you can send them in....

This is similar to an idea that occurred to me recently. The system works
like this:

You have a set of space-stations (well, Starports, really), at the 100-d
limit of the main world. All interstellar traffic goes via these. Each
station has its own tugs, fast shuttles, fuel tankers, etc. This allows
ships to pretty much forget about a manoeuvre drive. 

When a ship jumps, the chances of a misjump are slim, (it\'s using refined 
fuel, outside 100-d, jump program is very accurate (known, fixed, start
and end points)). It will come out fairly near to one of the stations.
Passengers and cargo can be transferred via fast shuttles, whilst tankers
can fly out to refuel the ship - which need never actually visit the
station, (unless it needs repairing, in which case a tug will bring it in).
Fuel can be brought to the station either from the main world or gas giant
using large, slow, bulk tankers (there\'s no hurry, and it can be refined
en route).

Advantages? Jumps should be safer. Actual travel times should be faster,
since the in-system travel is done in fast shuttles. Starships are cheaper,
(no m-drive). Passenger/cargo ships are more economical, (all that space
that would have been taken up with m-drive and fuel can be used for cargo
or staterooms.

Disadvantages? If you *do* misjump, you\'re in trouble. Needs a lot of time,
money, and resources to set up.

As to the question of misjump, would a low berth for everybody and a 
powerful radio or other communications system to send out distress calls 
be cheaper than an M-drive?  I\'m not sure, but for Classic Traveller (the 
only ship design system I can handle), it looks like it looks like a wash 
for carrying passengers, what with the cost of the extra low berths.  

What would make sense in the situation Andrew describes is L-hyd tanks -
since you have to go out and get the ships, the cargo shuttle could hang
around to grab the L-hyd tanks and tow them in for refilling.  You\'d 
lower costs and be able to carry more cargo/passengers.

This is off the top of my head - it would be interesting to sit down and 
run the numbers.  Out of curiousity, how would the design changes in 
MegaTraveller and New Era impact this situation?

Actually, in my view the computation would be no different.  Afterall,
the station is moving in orbit (around a planet, let\'s say), which in
turn is orbiting a star, which in turn is orbiting the galatic center
which in turn has motion relative to every other galaxy.  (Okay, you
probably don\'t have to worry about Galatic Relative Motion....).

It all ties in to the fact that there is no absolute frame of
reference and that stars are continually moving (i.e., there are no
\'fixed\' points).

You could argue that a station could provide partial computations, but
at a minimum that would require knowing the outbound vector of a ship.
Regularly scheduled flights could benefit from precalculations (their
outbound vector could easily be pre-definied), but traders,
adventurers or military craft might not.  For instance, military
spacecraft may be required to perform all calculations for security
reasons and traders may be trying to push their luck on the
100-diameter limit in order to gain an advantage over a competitor.

You could also argue that jump calculation programs already have as
much precomputed as possible, thereby making station-based
calculations worthless.

Myself?  I\'d leave the jump calculation rules as-is.

The characters are approached by Piet Van Der Heidjen, 
a representative for Voortrek-Provencal Industries.
VPI specialises in petrochemical refining in the 
Aquitaine system - mainly by extracting hydrocarbons
from Aquitaine\'s major gas giant and refining them
in orbital stations around the gas giant (Eleanor).

Recently, output from VPI\'s \'Eleanor-3\' rig has 
fallen markedly, due to a series of inexplicable
accidents.  Van Der Heidjen and his superiors 
suspect foul play, but are unable to launch an 
official investigation.  Such an investigation would
cast doubt on VPI\'s ability to supply high-grade 
petrochemicals to Aquitaine, and pave the way
for rival corporations to import these goods from
Aegir.

Van Der Heidjen wants the characters to sign on 
as workers aboard \'Eleanor-3\', and investigate 
covertly.  A retainer of Cr 25000 will be paid, 
plus a bonus of Ce 25000 on successful completion
of the mission.  

Due to the nature of the installation, the characters
will not be allowed to take any weapons with them
(firearms and volatile hydrocarbons do NOT mix).


GM\'s Information:

1/  The accidents are caused by a disgruntled, 
    and more than slightly unbalanced employee aboard
    \'Eleanor-3\'.  Exposure could completely flip
    the culprit, leading to a particularly 
    spectacular murder-suicide if not stopped.

2/  A rival corporation is behind the sabotage.
    Their agent is well armed, well trained, and
    willing to kill if necessary to avoid being
    exposed.

3/  The accidents never happened.  The rig\'s 
    CEO has been faking the incidents and covertly
    shipping the \'lost\' materiel to Solomani terrorists
    on Saxe.

Whatever the cause, the players will be outgunned, 
and possibly outnumbered.  Brute force aint gonna work
here - only cunning, skill and a little luck will see
them survive to collect their bonus.


I got the basic idea for this one from an old Dr Who 
episode, set aboard a terrestrial rig.  (No, I can\'t 
remember the name of it).  More details, including 
deck plans and rough specs for the \'Eleanor-3\' rig
are available on request.

I have usually assumed that high-volume starports were pratically never 
just one single port, but a host of networked port\'s...

Still, it\'s good to make this clear to one and all.

Well, with tugs, yes.  
I doubt if tug\'s serve minor ships + free traders, however (say, anything 
under 1000-Disp is considered a waste of time)

You are correct to point out that civilian ships that have no use for 
adventure are unlikely to have more than 2-5 hr\'s of drive fuel... and 
this may last them for quite a while!

Sorry: there are no-such-thing as a \'fixed point\' in space, although you 
can predict the location of well-known bodies to very tight levels.

More pertaintly, the location of these starbases vary with time: and you 
don\'t know exactly when you are going to get out of jumpspace.  Thus, 
tug\'s and my vestigal drives.

Now THIS is a good idea.
However, most driveless ship\'s (yes, I admit, you can get away with it in 
many instances) would only exist for the major trade lines and megacorps: 
basically because of the cost of all those tug\'s, space station\'s, etc.  
For one-time or occassional visits (and most adventurous scout\'s don\'t 
live in Core sector), you still want all the g-hour\'s that you can get.

An imaginative and useful setup for Core sector (and other long-civilized 
areas, like Rhylanor subsector, maybe).  Not good for frontier and 
exploration areas, however.

Yes, that\'s what I thought. Pre-war Imperial Core and Solomani

All right, I surrender!
Basically, what I meant was this: Jump calculations are very complicated,
involve a lot of variables, and probably take a while to calculate. The
more variables you can make constants, and the more factors you can
calculate in advance, the safer the Jump.

Agreed. Although...maybe people like the RC could use it too. They don\'t
have many ships, or places to build them. If you take an old ship, rip out
the m-drive, then bolt that onto a new hull (or a bit of rock, or
*anything*), you get a ship *and* a shuttle/tug/whatever.

Mark Clark, I love the adventure seeds, more more applod...
how about...

  as no. 8 But the "asteroid" is really a forerunner ( pre even the
anchients,
  in case you\'re tired of them... ;-) ) ship there doesn\'t seem to be a crew
  but your employer\'s "friend" and the rest that crew are found in stasis
tubes
  1) How do they relese them
  2) Just who put them in there in the first place...
I don\'t think a clever GM would let a party get away with the ship but if the
party is EXTREMELY clever and pulls it off... there will STILL be a lot a
good
GM can do with this. Can you imagine the questions they will get from
customs,
system control, and the authorities ( who WILL eant to get their sticky
little
fingures on this thing... PAY them but they should be proud to contribute to
the
well being of the state!
I\'m afraid that I would not be able to use these with my present group as one
of them reads this group. He comments even more often than I do... Hi Jim ;-)

I am also tired of the rock thread...
I aa also glad to see this group pick up it was a little guiet there for
a while I guess it was the holidays...

Our fine crew of misfits keeps hitting the news wherever we go...
At Lunion upstation we had picked up an ini watcher who had a psi shield
(naturally) unfortunatly for him Narius ( our 40K Grey Knight ) sensed
the blank spot and decided he did not like one little bit, Gunnar ( our
INI agent and knew of the watcher ) was sitting in the ward room with
our captain Marcus\' twin sister and older brother, when Narius came out
armed to the teeth and above. Gunnar stopped him and told him that the
station aouthorities would not allow firearms off the ship with out
considerable paper work... Narius asked Astrid ( our purser & 1st
officer ) to take care of it, no dummy she, she told Narius that it
would take longer than a week. Narius turned to Gunnar and said I sensed
a psi sheild out there just what am I allowed a pillow!
Gunnar hurried him out ( as he has done every time Narius has brought up
the subject of psi, but Narius STILL hasn\'t caught on... ;-) ) and
allowed him his pillow...
Narius walks off of the ship armed with a pillow. He walked past an
dblindsided the poor fellow. He told him that he did not like watchers
and do not show up here again, and stomped back on board.
Marcus\' sister noticed Gunnar\'s snicker.
Gunnar later reminded Marcus that he could not tell her just what was
going on she wasn\'t cleared for that information and Only if she shipped
out with us could she be told a close look at Gunnar would have revieled
a slight grimmace at the thought of two of them on board...
The station security did not try to arrest Narius as the assalted
indivual did end up in the hospital, I don;t think that he will admit
that he was decked by a Pillow!!
Later we jumped into a battle while one fo the crew was being talked
down from the belief thet we where all going to die ( he heard that
there was a 7% loose rate down here. The timeing couldn;t have been
worse for the crew member last seen in his hard suit under his bed...

Oh well I\'ve babbled on to much

Im currently setting up a non traveller related mailing list, principally 
for exchanging mail with my friends at university. The format for the 
list would resemble something similar to traveller@MPGN.COM ie a daily 
digest would be sent to those who subscribed.

Unfortunately our sys admin doesnt know how to set up a digest based list!
Im wondering if it is possible to obtain the software that runs this list,
either through public domain or via cash (no software piracy here)

Im not too great with computers either so it would be helpful if someone 
could mail me and explain to me what I have to do.

Cheers,

Mark.

Howdy,

last night I was printing stuff from the TML to put in my notebook when I
noticed a few things...

First, it seems that a lot of the BR conversions have the number of controlled
missiles equal to the number of missile MFDs, not the MFDs times the number
that they can control (5 for TL14, 6 for TL15, etc).  This has been discussed
before, but I thought I\'d bring it up.

Second, there was a planetary defense MG posted that is just plain wrong
(unless I\'m doing something wrong, in which case I\'d love to know :)

It is listed as having a DE of 50,000, and a length of 2000m, yet the damage
is listed as 10: 25-20-16-12.

First, the the effective range for a TL15 MG of 2000m is 80 hexes, so the
damage won\'t drop off, and secondly, the actual damage listed is wrong.
For DE=50k, the damage would be 12, not 25.  If I\'m srewed up on this
please let me know (maybe I\'m doing mine systematically wrong, yeesh :-/

So this critter should be M 10:12 (IMO)

This didn\'t appear in any of the official eratta sets
so I\'m going to post it here.

The Mass Driver design rules, pp 110, have the following
listed formula for range (short range) of a MD gun:
( bore diam (cm) + muzzle vel (m/s) ) * .015

This is wrong.  It would, as listed, give a max short range
around 75 meters for TL 10 5,000 m/s mass drivers, which is less
than a good rifle\'s short range, not to mention conventional
CPR cannon.  In addition, if you carefully look through FF&S, you will
see that the standard way to represent numbers less than 1.0 is with 
a leading zero, i.e. 0.015 would be correct, but .015 is "wrong".
Combined, those two signs are pretty strong that there\'s a misplaced
decimal point in that number and it should be 0.15 not .015 .

And yes, MFD\'s threw me a bit too, I hope the copy of my BR converted 
ships file on one of the ftp sites is correct. Just spot the error and 
let me know.

And a new comment, Task Force Games has a set of hex-grid maps of a solar 
system (use counters for planets). Its the Starfire Map Set, email 
tfg@aol.com for a catalog. Some of the info in the Starfire rules will 
also be useful for setting up assaults on a system for BR. When I get 
around to it, I\'ll post my findings.

Querry, why has no one tried to set up a traveller-based mush or moo? 
Other than copyright restrictions (which have been worked around in the 
case of novels) and lack of a site that is.

   This list is the result of a lot of research, and help from the
somewhat more knowledgeable (in some cases much more
knowledgeable).  Those who I have bugged over the past months
regarding this project know who you are and I thank you.

"Designer\'s" Notes


   A number of constraints were in place when I began this project.

   The first major one was that  none of the star systems could be
"moved".  All the known stars had to be placed within existing star
systems in the position they existed as of John Harshman\'s original
work--this also meant that new systems could not be "created".  
The result is that some known stars are a bit out of place (particularly
those furthest away), though the general direction to them is more or
less correct.  

   The second major constraint was  that all main world stats (with 
the exception of those which were contrary to the rules) were 
"sacred".  This meant that some stars had to be "turned up" a few
degrees (M7 Vs made into M2 Vs, etc.) so that the world that circled
them wouldn\'t be against the laws of astrophysics (i.e. a world  
with a standard, tainted atmosphere circling an M6V star).  This also
necessitated, in one instance, "flip-flopping" of two sets of known
stars in their relative position to each other and Sol so that the main
worlds were matched up with a compatible star.  

   The third major constraint was what I call "The Uncertainty 
Principle" (I know the name is already taken, but it works for my
purposes as well), and it reads something like: "the further you get 
away from Sol, the less likely you are to be correct about the exact
location of any given star".  While some stars could be identified 
beyond seven parsecs (the limit I ended establishing for myself for
identifying correctly the position of known stars) because they were
particularly bright or near a significant star (like Arcturus or Altair), 
most main sequence types beyond that limit could be placed in one 
of three, four, or more systems.  I ended up concentrating on getting 
the stars closer to home right (actually more accurate), and 
including additional stars beyond that limit if I felt comfortable about 
the accuracy of their location.  I welcome anyone criminally insane
enough to attempt to push the boundary out further than seven 
parsecs (especially given the above constraints)--perhaps the
nice men in the white coats will give you extra crayons for the
project.



Additional notes....


  Some of the systems contain more than one named star--this is not
necessarily because the stars in question are binary (trinary, etc.)
pairs--it just so happens that they lie within one parsec of each other
(particularly in the \'X\' and \'Y\' axis).


   Some stars (like Beta Hydri) are relatively close to Sol along the \'X\' 
and \'Y\' axis (2D-wise) but are a great deal further away in the third
dimension (up and down, or above and below the plane of the 
galaxy).  In those cases, the relative position of the star to Sol was
"translated" so that the direction from Sol to the star remained 
basically the same, but the distance between Sol and the star 
remained the same.  This allowed the galaxy to be "flatten", and
expressed in Traveller terms.

   Send your additions, corrections, suggestions and general 
constructive criticism  to hdhale@tasc.com.  The table below will
look much better in a proportional font like Courier, if you pull it up
in a word processing program.

of whether the name of the sector should be changed.  The best
candidate so far that I am aware of is Alpha Leonis (Regulus) which
is at least in the sector.

If you have the opportunity, check out 

"The Wings of Honneamise" (Royal Space Force)

which is making the rounds at some of the arty theaters
around the US.

Very briefly, it is a full-length animated film about a Tech-6
planet\'s first manned spaceflight, centering on the
astronaut-to-be.  A short description fails to do it justice,
but suffice to say it comes _HIGHLY_ recommended!

Feb. 17-20  U.C. Theater, Berkeley, CA

Feb. 17-23  Dobie Theater, Austin, TX

Mar. 2-9  Palm Theater, San Luis Obispo, CA

Apr. 7-8  Southwest Film center, Albuquerque, NM

Apr. 21-23  Cleveland Cinematheque, Cleveland, OH

Apr. 27  Union Theater, University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee

(at least, these are the play dates that haven\'t already passed by)

It\'s been described by newspaper critics as being like a cross between

don\'t do the movie justice.  The story is moving and the animation is
incredible.  It\'s a damn fine film.

I\'d second that...the standard of the animation is excellent, though I 
must say I did find the story a little slow-moving for my tastes at times...
(OK, so I was watching it in the original Japanese, with a English script 
on about 30 feet of fanfold paper in my lap, so maybe I didn\'t appreciate 
it as much as I could :) but I still enjoyed it...)

TMLers in the UK may be interested to know that WoH will be released on 
video by Manga Video (aka Mangle Video, aka "Never mind the quality, look 
at the tentacles" Video) "shortly" (sometime in the next month or so...). 

For ref\'s looking for a few new scenario ideas, Japanese SF animation is 
certainly worth a look...

Cheers

>From the MegaTraveller Referees Companion (1988) p.93 Alien 
Languages:

"The Zhodani call their language Zdetl; the present form of Zdetl 
was formally proclaimed the official language of the Zhodani 
Consulate on the occasion of the 300th Olympiad. [about 1550BC? ] 
Some dialects of the language exist, but they tend to be the 
jargon of specofic occupations rather than true differences in 
language."

and, MegaTraveller Referees Companion (1988) p.63 Zhodani:

"The following are terms in Zhdant......Zhdant: The language of 
the Zhodani."

Yes, the book contradicts itself -- not for the first time in 
Traveller\'s long history  ;-) . I suppose calling the language 
Zhdant is a bit like calling anglic \'terran\' -- you could get away 
with it, but it\'s not strictly accurate; the sort of mistake an 
ill-educated alien might make.

This any help?

        GDW\'s _behavior_ to date, with respect to this list, has
        said nothing, even with the number of postings of ships,
        weapons, casual encounters, alternate histories, pocket
        empire scenaria, RICE Papers, et alia, that have passed
        through these lists and their predecessors at engrg.uwo.ca.
        One could be led into thinking that GDW follows the FASA
        philosophy on this issue - but it could be a disappointing
        error to do so.

        We readers of the list are not the only ones who must be
        careful.  Rob Miracle, MPGN\'s administrator (or one of
        them) has refrained from copying over the Sunbane archives,
        or from creating a new archive at MPGN because of
        uncertainty with regards to GDW\'s policy.  I have written
        (and collected from other posters) material which would
        certainly belong in such an archive, and as I recall, some
        samples are in GDW\'s hands.  We are still awaiting a
        statement from GDW as to whether this material can be
        placed in a publically-available archive.

        I am therefore asking publically, as I said above, for some
        sort of policy/attitude statement from GDW on this
        important issue.  I eagerly await such a reply.

Yes, the wording is dense, and yes, some of the provisions are
one-sided.  But in my estimation, it is a license that most
creators can live with (I am not a lawyer, by the way).  FWIW, I
understand that this was worked out _before_ the TSR brouhaha, but
I could be wrong on it.  Certainly, I requested it before FASA and
Chaosium published their policies.

GDW will no doubt remember the flap caused by Kevin Siembada/
Palladium a while back, which ended up with almost nobody writing
_anything_ about any Palladium product since, and which almost
killed Wizards of the Coast.  I fear that TSR is going to go down
that path, in the name of trying to maintain total control over
that which is by its nature is not amenable to such control.

Obviously, I would prefer that GDW follow the route of FASA and
Chaosium, rather than that of Palladium and TSR.  I would consider
the Steve Jackson Games route to be more acceptable than the TSR
route, but less desirable than the FASA route.

Therefore, I am asking publically:

        What are GDW\'s intentions on this issue?  The previous
        "policy statement" does not make it clear, and the
        situation has changed somewhat since its formulation.

        I am not asking GDW to consult with high-priced lawyers to
        come up with a bulletproof cast-in-stone policy; I am
        asking for a statement of general attitude on the part of
        GDW, so that those of us who _do_ create can know just how
        far we can go, and how far we cannot go.

>> Sam Shirley

Note the contrast between the Chaosium and FASA positions and that
of TSR.  Early on in the brouhaha, before FASA or Chaosium came out
publically with their policies, GDW was asked about their policy.
The response is quoted below.  Note that it is significantly less
clear than any of the previously cited policies:

>> I\'d like to take a few moments to explain some things so we can avoid some
>> needless heartburn and speculation. This involves the nature of
copyrights,
>> letters of permission, and that awful s-word: suing.
>>
>> I hope that these issues are already pretty clear to most people who will
re
>> this, and maybe this letter is unnecessary, but it never hurts to
communicat
>>
>> The same way that Stephen King gets paid when someone makes a movie of one
o
>> his books, or Elton John gets paid when someone plays one of his records,
we
>> need to get paid for what we do. If musicians had to write songs and do
>> concerts for free, or authors or game companies had to spend months
writing
>> books for free, how could we expect there to be any music or books or
games?
>>
>> Companies like GDW do not own physical objects like factories or gold
mines
>> fleets of aircraft, things that have inherent value just sitting still.
All
>> that we own are our capacity to produce new ideas and games, and our
copyrig
>> on the ideas and games that we have already produced. Without copyrights,
we
>> would be working for free, and then how could we pay our rent, our
utilities
>> our printers, our color separators, and, of course, our employees.
>>
>> The problem with copyrights is that their owners must actively protect
them
>> they are not to lose them. The law is pretty clear that failure to protect
>> copyrights and trademarks is tantamount to voluntarily giving them up.
Usual
>> this involves trusting other people to not attempt to infringe on them,
and
>> nicely asking them not to if they try. However, if someone goes ahead and
>> infringes on your copyright anyway, the only thing that you can do to
protec
>> it is to sue.
>>
>> GDW is not now or ever looking to sue anyone, but our policy, and the
policy
>> any company, has to be that if we are forced to protect our copyrights, we
w
>> do so by the only available means, which is suing. Reserving the right to
be
>> able to defend yourself if required is hardly a threatening or foreboding
>> posture.
>>
>> Copyright law is becoming increasingly complicated by the electronic
>> revolution. We cannot afford to lose our ability to make a living doing
what
>> do by not being careful, especially when a project looks like it takes our
m
>> valuable material and charges straight into the thickest part of the
hedge,
>> to speak.
>>
>> As far as letters of permission are concerned, we are not refusing to give
o
>> any more, but we can hardly grant letters of permission to do things that
ma
>> lose us our copyrights. That wouldn\'t make any sense at all.
>>
>> David Nilsen
>>     GDW Chief of Design

A while back, while pursuing some research of my own on this and
related topics, I had occasion to request from Steve Jackson Games
a copy of the standard form taken by licenses to create derivative
works.  The text of this appears below.

>> ®LM0¯GENERAL GAME-ASSISTANCE PROGRAM LICENSE FORM - STEVE JACKSON GAMES
>>
>> Comments by Steve Jackson - updated 12-3-93
>>
>>    This is the licensing form which SJ Games uses to give permission
>> to create computerized character generators, GM aids, and so on for
>> its games. It\'s illegal to distribute such programs without our approval,
>> so we\'ve gone to our lawyers for a form that will let us give approval
>> in as streamlined a way as possible, without giving up any of our own
>> rights.
>>    If you\'re just writing a program for your own use, you don\'t need
>> our permission. But if you\'re going to sell - or even GIVE AWAY - a
>> single copy, you DO need our permission, and this license is the way to
>> get it. Yes, that includes shareware. Yes, that includes Lotus and
>> similar spreadsheets. Yes, that includes so-called "public domain" work.
>> You can\'t put my copyrighted material, or anything based on it, in
>> the public domain, because it ain\'t yours to begin with.
>>    We are not trying to prevent the creation of these programs. We
>> want to ENCOURAGE it, which is why we paid fat legal bills for this
>> agreement form. But the trademark and copyright laws require us to
>> "protect" our intellectual property with great formality, or risk losing
>> it. (If this bothers you, write your Congressman.)
>>    Yes, some of the protection provisions are one-sided. That\'s because
>> this license is for OUR protection. They are, after all, our games and
>> our livelihood . . . :-)
>>
>>    COSTS: If you give away your program, this license will cost
>> you nothing, not even a registration fee. (Editorial comment: I do not
>> agree with the idea that all programmers have some sort of moral
>> requirement to give away their work. On the other hand, if you choose
>> to do that I applaud you, and I won\'t ask you to pay any sort of fee.)
>>    If you\'re going to sell your program, as shareware or any other way,

As most of the participants on this list know, several months ago,
TSR, Inc., started an effort to restrict the availability of
material for their product lines that was not created and/or
authorized by them.  Several FTP sites have been intimidated into
shutting down, or removing all TSR product line-related materials.
They (TSR) _have_ authorized a single site (ftp.mpgn.com) to carry
such material, but they have required a disclaimer to be attached,
the wording of which appears to require that the authors waive some
(most) control of distribution of the material.

Jim Vassilakos, a participant on the original Traveller Mailing
List (from the engrg.uwo.ca days, and before the XTML inception)
recently wrote to some other companies to find out their policies
on this issue.  He posted to the net the most recent dialog from
that effort.  It is reproduced (minus Usenet headers) below, quoted
with ">> " prepended.  Text without such prepended indicators is
mine:

>> Hello, everybody. For those of you who have followed the discussions
>> concerning TSR\'s policy toward the net, here\'s another tidbit for
>> your archives. I recently wrote Chaosium asking them what their
>> policy was. Here\'s my letter and their reply:
>>    jimv@cs.ucr.edu
>>
>> ======================================================================
>>
>> From: james vassilakos <jimv>
>> Subject: policy on fan-authored, internet-distributed material
>> To: Chaosium@aol.com
>> Date: Sat, 28 Jan 1995 12:14:40 -0800 (PST)
>>
>> I\'m writing with respect to the TSR/Copyright debate which has been
>> brewing on the Internet over the past several months. Basically,
>> TSR issued a statement saying that all fan-authored material which
>> relates to AD&D (i.e. fan-written modules, monsters, rules, spells,
>> etc) may not be archived on any ftp site other than MPG-Net, and that
>> futhermore the following statement must be attached by the author to
>> the document in question:
>>
>> - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
>> This item incorporates or is based on or derived from copyrighted
>> material of TSR, Inc. and may contain trademarks of TSR.  The item is
>> made available by MPG-Net under license from TSR, but is not authorized
>> or endorsed by TSR.  The item is for personal use only and may not be
>> published or distributed except through MPG-Net or TSR.
>> - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
>>
>> People on the net are primarily concerned about the last line, where
>> we waive distribution rights to our own work. Since this situation has
>> persisted for several months despite some research netters have done
>> suggesting that TSR\'s position is not legally defensible, some people
>> have been dropping AD&D and moving over to other game systems. I\'m
>> currently compiling a summary of the internet articles pertaining
>> to this situation, and I\'d like to include your company\'s position
>> for the record. As an example, FASA responded with their own statement
>> which they asked to be attached to Shadowrun-related, fan-authored
>> material (notice that they make no reference to distribution rights,
>> much to the relief on many netters):

Howeve

terminatio

Games
>> may terminate this agreement immediately by providing LICENSEE with a
Notice

da
>> of this agreement, this agreement shall automatically terminate.

written
>> approval of SJ Games. LICENSEE shall immediately notify SJ Games of any
chan
>> or proposed change in ownership or control of LICENSEE during the TERM
hereo
>>  9:2 LICENSEE shall grant no sublicenses under this agreement, but this
shal
>> not prevent LICENSEE from having products made for it to its
specifications,
>> provided all provisions of this agreement are satisfied.
>>
>> 10. GOODWILL AND COOPERATION
>>  10:1 LICENSEE agrees that the essence of this agreement is founded on the
>> goodwill associated with the name of SJ Games and the LICENSED MARK, and the
>> value of that goodwill in the minds of the consuming public. LICENSEE agrees
>> that it is critical that this goodwill be protected and enhanced and, toward
>> this end, LICENSEE shall not during the TERM or thereafter:

    'body' => 'That big batch of copyright messages had two problems:
The SJG quotes came out of a wordprocessor with formatting codes still 
included.
The messages arrived out of order in the digest. I\'d advise putting the 
whole thing (with the SJG stuff strtipped of weird characters and 
formatting) on one of the traveller ftp or WWW sites.

On to more positive notes.

I so very rarely see a well documented post on the \'Net. The references 
from FASA and Chaosium provide a nominal statement of copyright, without 
severe restrictions. All they want is to remind people who actually made 
the game discussed. They are required to do that, on an active basis to 
maintain the copyright. If the public refuses a company could very easily 
lose a big batch of copyrights with attendant loss of control over 
quality of materials. So follow the rules, in this case it is beneficial.

The Steve Jackson Game computer software license is a different kettle of 
fish because it assumes a financial responsibility on the programmers 
part. But if you are selling things, that\'s business. Notice the free 
license for free-ware and PD software. However, all of this could be very 
different if SJG was selling its own software.

I do not believe that such copyright statements could be required to 
aplly to private correspondence that is not open to the public. I haven\'t 
actually met any of the other people on this list, but I consider myself 
to be a party to a \'personal\' discussion with you all. I believe that a 
copyright notice on a private letter is silly and I don\'t see that the 
fact that it was sent to more than one stranger makes a difference. 

On the other hand it is clear that files on the ftp and WWW sites should 
include a copyright statement. At the end for a file available for ftp; 
on the title page of a web page or ftp site directory. Also, bundles of 
private messages in the archives would need ONE copyright notice at the 
end, just like anything else, because they are publicly available in the 
archive and are hence being \'distributed\'.



Needless to say I am not a lawyer, nor are these respectable legal 
opinions. Actually, I probably _do_ have to say that.

The modifications tell me to calculate the number of control points

another figure for control points that depends on the type and

Then the several computer models list mass, volume, price and a multiplier
which I don\'t really know how to use.

I think that these modifications were based on some traveller ship design

The Jonkereen are a "Home-made" Minor human species.  They were detailed in
(as I recall) the MegaTraveller\'s Journal #3 (or maybe #2) and were
genetically modified by the Imperial Colonial Authority, or some such, to be
well adapted to desert conditions.  After several generations they are doing
fairly well, although their culture is only TL 3 or 4.  I seem to remember
that they had, in turn, several small settlements on other nearby
"Moisturally challenged" Domain o\' Deneb worlds.  As I recall, they were
somewhat reminiscent of the Beduin in terms of culture.  Nice Vilardi
illustrations for the article, too.

No rules for designing one (probably "Barbarian" from the MT or CT career
types) and no naming conventions were provided.

I don\'t have the article with me, being at work, so I can\'t be more
specific.  Doubtless, hordes of others will  respond more accurately.  Well,
maybe one horde.

Possessions: 300,000 Cr; most of it tied up in his home and retirement funds.

Family: one wife, 2 small sons (ages 5 and 3)

Appearance: Short & wiry, with thick, wavy black hair.  Dark brown skin, 
his eyes are naturally brown, but he wears yellow contacts for more 
fashionably `manly\' look.  Usually clothed with TL B "sprayed on" 
fabrics, topped off with Devil\'s breaches and a brown/silver `head-cape\', 
similar to Arab headgear, but no fabric covering the top of his head.

Personality: Vigourous and excitable, the kind of man who will try to 
right a wrong as soon as he sees it, without regard to the consequences.  
Adores his patron god, his family and his political followers.  Will 
never intentionally cause anyone pain, unless it\'s absolutely unavoidable.

History: He was just another minor TV personality when he first got 
involved in the Hetot M, a political organization that wants the 
democratically-elected Regency Planetary Resident to control domestic 
affairs also, thus becoming the defacto head of government rather than the 
current non-charismatic dictator Fieerield e\'Orentav, President of Cyan 
for the last 17 years.

Of course, e\'Orentav is not pleased at all: he considers Citizen Gurewich 
to be "a threat to social harmony", often placing him under house arrest 
and conducting petty harrasment against him.  The Resident, placed in a 
delicate diplomatic position, has worked hard to distant herself from 
Gurewich\'s campagin while trying to persuade e\'Orentav to soften the 
`fascist-lite\' nature of his government, giving the general public a 
greater voice in planetary affair\'s.

Throughout the Regency - and on Cyan - public opinion view Gurewich as a 
folk hero, a speaker for the Average Joe, uncontrolled by The Man.
The high level of Regency media attention has forced the dictator to avoid 
taking `extreme measures\' to deal with Gurewich, instead relying on an 
unsuccessful slander campagin.

Despite his importance to the Hetot M, Gurewich insist\'s on spending half 
the year in an undersea cavern with other Initaties, engaging in the 
worshiping of Neptune (yes, the same Roman god).  During these times of 
seculsion, the government can afford to increase it\'s heavy-handed actions 
against the democrat\'s, as Regency media attention drop\'s drasically.

Possessions: A Luxurious TL 5 Mansion (owned by the Regency)
             15,000 Cr from Father, on a TL E debit card
             Has a TL 5 limo for "Regency business", but still can\'t 
                drive it, preferring the chaffeur to so.
             Two personal servant\'s (one that belong to him, the other 
                being a Family Watchdog.)

No Family on Mewey : but a large, wealthy, and controlling one on Vume.

Appearance: Of Solomani decent: white, with brown hair w/mustache set on 
a slim face.  Tends to project a neat, `natty\' aura.  Dresses in typical 
"minor noble" fashion, on the conservative side.

Personality: Soft-spoken, even timid, but rigid if a matter of principle 
is involved.  Is quietly europhic over getting away from his family, but 
nervous about doing something stupid and ending his new-found freedom.  
Enjoys going on `walkies\' on Mewey, the first world he\'s ever been on 
where you can step outside, breathe the air, and feel the sunshine gently 
lie on his shoulders.  

History: Eleven years before he was born, his homeworld was conquered 
without a fight by the Regency.  In return for a formal acceptance of the 
Regent as their Liege, the now-defunct nations of Vume were ennobled, 
then swamped by the waves of settlement from nearby Albe. 

By the time Alco was 10, the original population of 10,000 had risen to 
over 1 million, with the old Vume culture forgotten by all but the 
museums.  Seeing how Regency Nobility was losing power, Alco\'s elders 
made him join the Regency Electorial Office, to get a firsthand feel of 
the New Democracy - and see how the Vume families can cut a niche in it.

Alco himself has no love for politics, and privately detests both his 
elder\'s controlling ways and their willingness to sell their heritage for 
titles.  He hopes to prevent Mewey - another world `persuaded\' to join 
the Regency, in 1182 - from Vume\'s fate by the vigourous defense of 
Mewey\'s democratic right\'s.  Indeed, his superiors wonder if sometimes 
Mr. Alco places Mewey\'s interest\'s above the Regency\'s.

Possessions: Master of a TL A Morraine Free Trader, w/AirRaft. 

Family: Is a major `family elder\' of his 32-member clan, with the menfolk 
usually scattered throughout the Deneb Wilds: most of the women and 
children is located on Dophkah\'s Starport. (Yes, local Free Trader 
culture is quite patriarchal)

Appearance: Once a strong, handsome daredevil, a Rebellion-era mine 
robbed him of a chunk of his face and much of his strength.  With chin 
and front teeth missing, Hugie is quite repulsive: he continues to trade, 
but makes sure that strangers who wish to see him are warned by his 
shipmates about his appearance, to reduce the shock.

The incident also created difficulties in speech.

History: The most promising of his father\'s many sons, Hughie was 
helping to set up astrogating matrixes from the age of 6, and was 
selected by his clan as part of the permenant crew of the Al Dabaran from 15.

The vast majority of his travels is plying a safe interface route between 
Dophkah and Errogel (Million: Deneb/2716 C150544-8 N Ni Po De 324 Wi G9 
V), the unoffical subsector capital of Million sector today [hey, it does 
have a working Vargr corsair, which is one more ship than any other 
system in the Million wilds can claim!]  Exactly two other merchantmen - 
both owned by the Vargr - operate in the subsector, and both ship\'s are 
in worse shape than his (not that the casual observer could tell the 
difference).

Only very occassionaly would the Al Dabaran leave it\'s single safe route, 
usually to pick up one of the clan\'s trained technican\'s from advisiory 
duties on one blasted world or another.  About five of these valuable 
brothers is on Segan (Million: Deneb/2717.  At 1117: B3509AB-C.  At 1200: 
X35056F-1 Ni Po De 324 Wi G9 V), helping the local TED maintain his 
machines, and richly rewarded for doing so.

Possessions: Standard "Living module" in the HighPort. 
             About 8,000 Cr in savings
             About 14,000 Cr in small `gifts\'

Family: a common-law husband, 5 children (3 have left home).
        Her parent\'s also live with her.

Appearance: In line with Risek fashion (which is itself heavily 
influenced by Rhylanor), tri D\'vanfair prefers to wearbiogeneered 
clothing with it\'s biolumenesent (glow-in-the-dark, for those with 
trouble with my spelling) colours and an overpowering fagrance.  Her 
stolid, double-chinned face is traced with faint red tatto lines, 
identifying her as a member of the D\'vanfair clan of Bevy.  A synthetic 
`halo\' - a visual effect eminating from a cap she wears - completes the 
effect.

Personality: Loud and getting louder.  According to the starship 
captain\'s who have the pleasure of her company, she is rude, crass and 
ignorant of the first principles of starship operation.  About the only 
way to avoid being entangled in a writhing mass of red tape is to 
continually "feed Herself with small but valuable gifts." (their words)

If you talk to her family and her social peer\'s, though, you\'d hear the 
story of a generous and musically talented woman, always willing to help 
out anyone in need.  Even a few traders are willing to sing her praises: 
the most legendary tale revolves on how she faced down both the Starport 
Administrator and the Commandant of the Navy base to retify a gross 
injustice done to one of "Her" merchants. 

Position: As a Port Inspector, Ms. tri D\'vanfair has enormous power over 
the comings & goings of the smaller ship\'s (under 1000 Disp), especially 
Free Traders who don\'t have a Corp. to look out for them.  Heading a 3-5 
man ship inspection team, she can declare a starship, crew members or a 
cargo load "hazzardus", impounding them until a formal hearing is held.

Possessions: A large, transparent pressure dome in one of the better 
                neighbourhoods 
             Access to local Regency resources, as needed
             c. 200,000 Cr in Mora-based investments
             22,000 Cr available as ready cash

Family: her husband David, four grown children (all in the Regency Civil 
        Service), and two large Clover hounds 

Appearance: the Dame\'s clothing tends to be quite conservative and 
understated.  However, a Regency royalty watcher or a fashion expert 
would appreciate her very subtle (and very expensive) taste in clothes, a 
style that fewer and fewer lesser nobles can afford nowadays.

Personality: Tall and regal, Dame Oralia tend\'s to give the rarefied air 
of a cold, superdignified noble.  This is the result of training and habit, 
but also preferance: she doesn\'t like to associate with anyone of lower 
Social Standing then "9".  About the only crack of humanity she is 
willing to show in public is affection to her God, her family, and  
family servants, and even then it\'s more of a loving tenderness 
than a powerful bear hug. 

Family History: Origionally from Sagan, Deneb sector, the main Huntington 
line perished to the last man fighting the Vargr hordes, leaving only a few 
survivors of the lesser, non-hereditary noble line to carry on the family 
name and tradition of service.  Even by 1200, Sagan has remained 
unvisited by any Regency craft, formally or unoffically.

Beliefs: Dame Oralia - a life (non-hereditary) peer, ennobled 1194 - 
fiercely believes in both in her family and in the Regency.  A devout 
Roman Catholic - a typical `Solomani noble\' religion -  she also believes in 
the place of the nobility as ordained in God\'s Order.

However, her Oath of Feality to the Regent forbits her from striving to 
neutralize the Democratic Reforms, as the Regent *is* the Will of God in 
temporal matters, as far as she is concerned.

Unfortunately, her charismatic younger brother Brian not only opposes the 
Reforms but believes that violence can be justifiably used to stop them.  
In his influential telebook "Honour Betrayed", he declares "[The 
Democratic Reforms] is an illegal attempt to ursurp Noble authority, 
proclaimed by a Regent who dares to take what Cleon has given.  Deneb 
will soon be as dead as Illeish, if we allow the use of majority votes as 
a shoddy cloak for the theft our our rights, our property, and our heritage!"

That\'s Brian\'s view.  Dame Oralia\'s view is that her brother is 
commiting high treason against divinely-annointed authority.  If she ever has
the opportunity to kill him for disgracing the family name, she will 
gladly take it.  Currently, however, not even MoJ agents can find Briam.

Ambition: Originally a Crown Attorney, she made the bench in 1191.  She 
has the reputation of a severe, hanging judge of ice-pure integrity.  
Her goal is to eventually become Law Lord of an important system in a 
decade, eventually apexing in a *hereditary* title.

Current goals: as a judge of a recently-absorbed system - Flammorion was 
annexed after a short action in 1188 - Dame Oralia\'s mail goal is to set 
Imperial Justice as a perfect, unquestionable standard in the eyes of all 
Flammorionii.  "The way that a civilization dispenses justice is the 
clearest indication of that civilization\'s worth" one of her professors in 
law taught, and the Knight intends to clearly indicate the superior worth 
of Imperial Civilization to all others.

Family:  Has many connections to the local poor

Appearance: looks like a Vargr on the ropes, with old, dull clothes and a 
greying, dirty coat of fur.  Despite his semi-impoverished condition, 
however, Vangtirs still retains a certain pride in himself, and has not 
let impoverished circumstances impoverish his soul.

Personality: Loud and boisterous.  Quite adventurous and daring, he\'s 
willing to take on anything and anyone that get\'s in his way... and has 
the scars to prove it.  

History: Born into the very small Vargr community on Enos (less than 1000 
menbers), he worked as a railroader for a decade before being able to buy 
a low passage ticket to Anduril.

On Anduril, he worked in a sweatshop for four long years (his hands still 
hurt from that time) until he found his true calling as a guide to the 
Urgnemoff Desert.  Based in the small town of Hunafloi, his archaic TL 4 
tours are bringing in a constant income, allowing him to treat his 
friends and even import - at an outragious cost - a TL 4 ballon for his 
business.

Possessions: The only thing the Adept owns is her Bible.
             All the following possessions are actually lent to her by 
               her order:
             An extensive array of TL C antivirus equipment
             Religous pamphlets, books, and audiovisual equipment
             A large array of field equipment
             Her TL F nun\'s robe

Organization: her 800,000 member order is spread throughout the trailing 
and coreward edge of the Regency, with a special concentration in 
Pretoria and Lamas subsectors.

Appearance: The first thing one notices about her is her unmistakable 
clothing.  A dark blue, TL F nun\'s robe with habit, it\'s usually speckled 
with shimmering, twinkling stars that can dissapear with a guesture or a 
verbal command.  It provides an AV of 2.

Forentine herself is thin and willowy, though on the short side.  her 
face is of uncertain origin, usually placid, with naturally arched 
eyebrows and dark brown eyes.  Her black hair is hidden by white cloth.

Personality: Enthusiastic and mystical.  Her unlimited faith in God 
grant\'s her the stamina to endure any trial: however, her spritual 
orientation(ie. her lips moving in silent prayer, unexpected religious 
trances, religious laguage popping into non-religious conversation, 
talking to angels) can make people nervous.  However, her natural love of 
people - especially the poor, sickly and hurting - tend to cover her 
faults.  She still has some very weird eating habits, though.

Her most enjoyable pastime isher soaring chant\'s: she\'s always learning 
new chant\'s to add to her extensive repritore.  When attacked, she 
react\'s in a passive-aggresive manner, often infuriating her opponenbt or 
dumping guilt on them.  Her most deadly weapon is a low-profile, 
razor-sharp wit: she can make even the most arrogant and proud 
opponentlook like a blind and stupid fool, but she\'ll never openly and 
directly attack anyone.

Usually quite easygoing, she can be stubborn and manipulative over issues 
she feels is important.  Oftentimes, she can even literally get sick 
until she get\'s what she want\'s.

History: At a very young age, Leonidas decided to become a num, and was 
enrolled in the Society of Mary Magalene.  She enjoyed her stay at the 
convent at Ash, and now- after an extensive education, Adept Forentine - 
and her Champion, Aleksandr Suvarov - is preparing to enter the Wilds, to 
recontact the faithful of the Imperial Church, convert the heathen, 
spread antiviral tools and techniques, and gather sociological 
information to bring back to the Church leaders on Mora.

Ambition: Leonidas hopes to do a good enough job so that not only will 
she be initated into full sisterhood, but be given a pernament mission to
tend.

"Code" is a method of communication using symbols, gesters and subvocal 
sounds to convey information secretly.  Taught in certain regiments of 
the Regency Marines.

Possessions: A large array of field equipment (ie tents, radio\'s, etc)
             Marine Cutlass (bought secondhand: his own was broken in 
                       disgrace)
             4mm Gauss Rifle - 12
             commo kit * 2
             medical kit * 3

Organization: The Military Order of Christ is a registered mercenary 
unit, operated by the Imperial Catholic Church as a security arm for 
church leadership, property, isolated conflicts and dangerous 
expeditions.  Largely Veteran/Elite, the 1400-man unit has a solid 
reputation, although it\'s fielded too rarely to be seriously considered 
as a contender for "The Best Mercenary Unit".

Appearance: Unattrative, though not repulsive.  A hard, bony face, framed 
by dirty blod hair, is set upon a 6-foot sinewy, big-boned body.  
Clothing is either ill-fitting civvies or worn military fatigues.  Has a 
thick Denebi accent when he speaks, which is seldom..Sticks close to the 
Adept in the field.

Personality: Laconic.  No longer beat\'s up people on impulse, but is 
still tempted.  Despite his distain for authority he is loyal to his 
order and his God, and is both quick-witted and fearless in action.

His great goal is to obtain fame and renoun, to cleanse his name and be a 
hero to his people, `to sieze the Glory\'.  His every action, every though 
is directed to this one goal.

History: Born in Deneb, Suvarov\'s childhood dream was to join the Regency 
Marines.  He served two tours in the Marines with distinction, obtaining 
several citations and metals, including the Regent\'s Star for 
spearheading an attack on a nasty enemy strongpoint in 1194.

All that he worked for was lost when he callously murdered a 
non-combatent on the battlefield in 1196.  Although his unit didn\'t report
this crime to the authorities, rumour\'s about his action eventually reached
an officer, who set court-marshal proceedings in motion.  Because of his
previous heroism Suvarov wasn\'t shot: instead he was given 100 lashes with a
neurowhip and dishonourably cashiered, with his life savings paid out to
the victim\'s wife as restitution.

Without honour, without his friends, and without a future, Suvorov would 
soon have destroyed himself in drugs or drink if he wasn\'t rescued by a 
compassionate priest.  After repenting of his sins, paying penance, and 
converting into the Imperial Church, he requested and, after careful testing
using Zhodani techniques, was allowed to join the M.O.C.

His sterling record with the M.O.C. has finally landed his first 
independent assignment, with Adept Flourentine: an opportunity to prove 
himself a reformed Christian that Suvarov has been waiting for.

Posessions: 10 MCr in diamond\'s gold, and radioactives
            a line of credit from her clan (only useable in the Hierate)
            an extensive database on the current Spinward States 
              (although much of that info is over 10 years out of date)
            Translator chips for every language in the Spinward States
            another specialized database regarding the 
               diplomatic/political situation (only 4 years out of date)
            subscriptions to nearly every news service, political,  
               scientific and business journal in existance
               (except that worthless RC junk, of course :)
 
Family: unmarried, to preserve her independence

Appearance: on rather light build for an Aslan, with a very long, 
well-groomed coat of black hair.  Her round face and oval eyes (oval even 
for Aslan) is set off with a short snout.  Aslans (or humans fluent in 
Aslan) would find her accent strange and harsh: her Anglic is clear, if 
rather stilted.  Her style of dress is definitely unknown by local Aslans 
(and human Aslan watchers).

Personality: Beyond the usual Aslan formality and pride, Kyuiwei is 
incredibly curious ("as curious as a Hiver" is the Regency stereotype: 
of course, Kyuiwei would immediately ask to see a real live one).  
Everything she sees must be poked, tested, sampled and analyzed.  Enev 
more interesting for an Aslan, she applies her curiouisity to sentinents 
- regard less of their barbaric (ie non-Aslan) culture, she just must 
find out more about them.  her non-judgemental attitude - very rare on 
her world, where no human has been seen since the Rebellion started - has 
marked her out as her clan\'s Ambassator Extraordinare.

History: After graduating from a local "university", Kyuiwei was selected 
to join her clan\'s scientific community as a field scout/scientist.  As 
scientisis were the subgroup most likely to interact with the Strangers 
(ie. Aslans outside of the Yekhakteal clan) she became exposed to these 
folk, and - unlike her peers - wrote about these strange Aslans with 
their peculiar habits for the general public.

Worldwide fame and notoriety was produced: the government initally 
attempted to discourage further writings, but, under pressure from 
acadamia, business, and her hordes of fans, relented, and gave her funds 
to continue exploring.  And explore she did: with an aged trader with a 
questionable jump drive she explored first her subsector, then the entire 
sector, taking odd jobs and speculating on cargo to keep food in the 
belly and the engines hot.

When she returned "to stay", she had not only bought a treasure trove of 
information, but had inadvertantly laid the groundwork for other clan members
to follow, both business and scientists.  This led to a surge in the ecomony
(Yekhaktei is the highest tech system in the subsector), which led to a 
vastly increased government interest in her explorations.

Eventually, the clan leaders managed to persuade her to launch another 
one-ship expedition, but as a formally accreddited ambassador of her 
clan.  She was given the _Ouhaei Hteftaihwoarl_, a gorgeous TL E Aslan 
scout/diplomatic yacht, with a read lab, probes, RCV equipment and 
everything, wrapped in a million credts worht of luxurious fittings, 
double-large rooms, whirlpool, etc.  And she was given a \'loose\'itenary, 
involving contacting all the major clans of the Hierate, the Zhodani, and 
the Regency.

Kyuiwei has spent the last eight years away from her distant home, and 
has seen more wonders than anyone else in her clan\'s history.  Now 
completing her tour in the Zhodani Consulate, she\'s now in Chronor 
subsector, preparing to enter the Spinward Marches.  With most of her 
experiences of humans from the Consulate, she would be initally very 
truthful and trusting, expecting the truth in return. However, her view
of the Regency will be as an inferior civilization, full of liars and 
mentally ill people (as her Zhodani friends suggest).  Indeed, one of her 
crew is a Zho \'guide\' (actually a SORAG agent), sent specifically to 
protect her from the Regency barbarians.

                *All hands!  Stand by!  Free falling!*
                    And the lights below us fade
 
                     Out ride the sons of Terra
                    Far drives the thundering jet,
                    Up leaps the race of Earthmen,

                 We\'ve tried each spinning space mote
                    And reckoned its true worth:
                Take us back again to the homes of men

             a rented apartment in Solaris Tower
             about 32,000 Cr in the bank

Family: A loveless marriage with two wives, no children - his only son 
died 12 years ago in a hull breach incident.

Appearance: His very low charisma is the result of a major attitude problem.
& Personality        `Cursing\', `drunken\', `lewd\' and `smelly\' comed to 
                      mind when you see his bloated form lurch towards you.

Despite his degenerate existance, this particular blight on mankind is 
quite competent on thejob.  he is an extremely tough examiner - on both 
first imers, and those renewing their license to fly - who enjoys 
depriving young hotshot pilots of their starship pilot license for the 
most trivial of reasons.

He is also quite devioius in his methods: one of his favourate tricks is 
to fail the pilot, then suggest that "for the right incentive" he\'s 
willing to reconsider the grade.  After the bribe is given, he blows the 
whistle, the pilot is imprisioned and barred from ever regaining his 
license while Longshanks gains brownie points and an extra bonus in hs 
paycheck.

While he\'s willing to stomp on anyone, he especially loves to fail psions, as
they remind him of the Zhodani, those "Craven, perverted mind-eating
moon-worshippers"  Originally born in the Consulate, (he regularily 
thanks the gods for getting him out before the age of 4, where his 
\'education\' would have started) he insist\'s on calling
his old homeworld "Sheyou", and is willing to do anything to hurt the 
Zhodani, psions, or anything related to them.

Behind this tub of lard\'s beady little eyes lies a beady but hyperactive 
mind.  Treat with caution.

Club         3 (10)   Liaison       1 (4)
Slug Pistol  3 (10)   Research      1 (8)

Possessions : a large web of medical and criminal contacts
              about 2.4 BCr, in laundered accounts
              several regal estates on Menorb, Efate, Whanga, Ruie and Regina
                 (many bought from recently impoverished nobles)
              his very own island chain on Whanga
              illegal biotech and prostitution operations throughout Regina 
                 subsector
              several small legitimate biotech firms on Efate

Family: most of his family is involved in his operations in one way or 
        another, and form the nucleous of his command structure.  The 
        people that he really trusts, though, are his three clones.   
        Equipped with regularily updated copies of his personality, they 
        are his top aides, and reside on Efate, Menorb, and Regina.  He 
        himself prefers to remain on Whanga.  

Apperance: Heavy-set, but with hard muscle underneath the flab.  
           Red-brown skin tone, crew-cut brown hair, and hazel eyes are set 
           on a brick of a head. Dresses *very* well, but still looks 
           and moves like a thug.

Personality: The strong, silent type.  Carefully plans every move, then 
             does whatever it takes to see it through.  Has the ability to 
             see "The big picture", and how to profit from it.  He\'s 
             also rather lucky (a +3 on every difficult or crucial 
             task), which comes in handy in his business.

History: Always hungered to `make it big\', and get out of his cronically 
         depressed megalopolis.  Dimling started out as a small-time organ 
         dealer, arranging the illegal sale of blood and kidneys.  
         Eventually took over the business: developed and extended "Organ
         harvesting" to target the ill, street people and especially 
         untended children (who\'s organs go for the highest prices on 
         the black market).

        After branching into less-than-reputable hospitals, he\'s now 
        believed to operate a "medical testing centre" - with sentients 
        as testing subjects - somewhere in Uthe/Gvurrdon: the 
        subsector govenour\'s Justice Commission: Syndicate Branch 
        suspect\'s Orsesokhin (Uthe: Gvurrdon/2323 A000874-F G Cx Na As 
        210 Ve M5 V M2 II), the capital of the coreward Thonengling Raghz 
       ("Thoengling Empire" in the local Vargr dialect), as the most 
       likely site.

       Currently, Mr. Dimling is attempting to recify his only noticable 
       failure: his every attempt to take over Whanga for his own 
       purposes has been repeatedly countered by the local 
       democartically-elected Resident (the local nobility he has in his 
       pocket): he came close to staging a favourable coup, but something 
       went wrong, and he had to back off or face the wrath of the Regent
       himself (who just happens to be subsector Duke, and is not  
       pleased with how Dimling corrupted the local Nobility)

Possessions: Ranger bank Card (TL F), w/500,000 Cr available

               master went missing
             A TL -D laser pistol
             A pension from Tirem, of 23,100 Cr/year
             A reserve commision in his nation\'s Air Force

Family: A wife on Tirem, five grown kids (one in the Regency Navy)

Name: According to his culture, he\'s to be refered to by
      ... his Anglic name when outside of Tirem system
      ... his Chinese name when insystem
      ... his Vilani name by the nobility (regardless of where he is)

Organisation: The Ranger Corporation is a scout/exploration company, the 
largest now operating in the Spinward Marches.  Currently has 20 scouts, 
and one scout tender.  Based on Mora/Mora/Spinward Marches.

Appearance: a gentle, nondescript man in his mid-forties.  Of clear 
Solomani caucasian/oriental decent, with brown wavy hair growing gray 
on his temples.  Bates dresses neatly and comfortably.

Personality & History: Usually quiet and unassuming, Mr. Bates is an 
unlikely scout: he didn\'t even leave his home system till the age of 41.  
However, after he retired he decided to "tour a bit of hte Regency" and 
signed on with Ranger Corp. as a scout.

His willingness to help, natural shyness and extreme skill in piloting 
endeared Bated to the crew of the Second Guess.  

While docked at one of Ruie\'s downports the crew decided to hit the bars, 
after trying unsuccessfuly to get Bates to join them.  They never returned.
The local police has not found a trace of them in two weeks of searching, 
and suspect that they have left the planet.  Bates has contingency order 
to return to Mora, and is already looking for a crew to take the Second 
Guess home.  However, he would love to make one last effort to find his 
shipmates.

I know that two Alien\'s list have been posted here, but I\'m going to ask 
this question anyway:

             Can anyone here post an alien list, but only for the 
             Domain of Deneb? [the "Domain" because I\'m including the 
             Regency surrounds.]

Basically, I\'d like to know what aliens can PC\'s in the Regency can have 
a chance to meet, besides the Asla,, Vargr, and Darrians. (and, off the 
top of my head, the Jonkeereen and the Jundy).

Thank you.  If you don\'t care to clutter the list , please email me.

If one good thing comes out of the New Era for Imperial/regency fans, 
it\'s that we are going to get a lot more detail about our favourate piece 
of the stars.  Assuming that GDW will do the sourcebook the _right_ way, of 
course... 

Incidentally, what is the _right_ way for GDW to do the job?  Personally, 
I\'m hoping for 
   A) a good overview of Regency politics and basic political structure
   B) a subsector-by-subsector breakdown + descriptions of the Regency
   C) perhaps a brief survey of the most important systems
   D) an outline of the major culture-groups in the Regency
   E) a good, highly detailed description of Regina subsector.

  Folks, I want to apologize for my data dump into a recent digest.
  I _did_ intend for the whole shebang to appear in the digest, but 
  _not_ as eight messages, and _certainly_ not in the order in 
  which they actually appeared.  Thank a less-than-perfect mail 
  reader/poster for that...  As far as the WP codes in the SJG 
  license, well, that\'s the way I got it, and I don\'t believe in 
  altering text that I\'m quoting.

  I _do_ want to know GDW\'s position on the issue, and I _did_ want 
  to make people aware that not everyone takes the TSR stance.  If 
  that question and that point got across, I\'m satisfied.

  In case I neglected to mention it in the data dump, I want to 
  publically thank Jim Vassilakos for (a) posting his FASA/Chaosium 
  information publically, and (b) giving me permission, nay, 
  encouragement, to repost it to the Lists.

Assuming that a TL F/G, Jump4 Regency fleet, consisting of 
                  10 *  50,000 Disp ship\'s (Warships)
                  40 *  10,000 Disp ship\'s (Warships)

is sent to clean up Vland sector of Virus and resecure it for the 
Regency/Imperium, how long would it take to do the job?

And how would they organize the ship\'s to do the job?  The safest method 
would be to keep most of the ship\'s in one big fleet, and sterilize each 
system, one at a time.  How long would this take?

What would be the quickest method?  "Each ship to take on one system" 
rather than keeping the fleet in one place would be quicker: how risky 
would it be to disperse the fleet? 

A proper risk assessment would require a good grasp of enemy strength: 
how would I estimate the strength of Vampire fleets in Vland? (I suspect 
that Vland system itself would be a VERY dangerous place, because of all 
the major naval ships and defense installations based there during the 
Collapse).  How smart are these ship\'s?  And how do I go about cleansing 
an infected, ex high-pop, high tech world? (`Bombard it from orbit\' sure 
sounds good to me, especially the cities - where Virus would be 
strongest.  BUT I don\'t want to kill any human (O.K., `organic senitnet\') 
inhabitant\'s that may be in the city.

My sample fleet above is just an example: what do you think the actual 
ship composition should be?

Geneered race designed for desert existence. Originally designed for a
desert planet in Gushmege to counter Suerrat expansion early in the 400s,
they were developed by SUSag on Jonkeer in the 500s and developed their
own subculture in the 600s. See MTJ3.

They are not all that far from normal humans. They were imperial 
citizens. They made up most of the population of Jonkeer, and I believe 
had a few colonies elsewhere. Those who stray off planet 
adapt to local conditions.  MegaTraveller Journal 3 has an article with 
more detail. What has happened to them since the bust up is up to you.

I don\'t know if someone answered this before but GDW did release an
eratta for the Mass Driver range.  This is what GDW posted to this
list.

 Page 110

 (Correction): The formula for computing the direct fire range
 of a mass driver is wrong. Replace the second paragraph of the
 "1. Direct Fire Range" subsection with the following:

 "Short direct fire range in meters for a mass drive gun firing
 a kinetic penetrator round is equal to _five times the sum of its
 bore size in centimeters plus one-twentieth its muzzle velocity
 in meters per second plus 20. SR = 5 [B + (Vv20) + 20]"_

How about 4 fleets, divide what you said in two to make the two main "virus
killing" fleets. 1 command fleet as you specification, but with two huge
dreadnaughts (so it can split if nessasary, and be able to kill anything),
and one quarinteen fleet, carrying marrines, or army, for garison dutey,
engineers, to set up xboat routs, planitary defences, boot strap teems,
and enough ships to provide the quarinteen line as it expands and general
massive support program(4th fleets would probs be the same sixe as the
other three put together.

The two little fleets go out and kill all the system bound virus fleets, and
any wanderes they find, tell the free traders they will be patrolling
corridore, and then clean the stars between the great rift, and the Windhorn,
would mean that the quarinteen lines would be shorter therefore less ships
needed. As the quarinteen line slowly expands, probs a system a month, and
the system is intergrated into the regency, the command and controll fleet
stays within about 20 pacars of the quarinteen line to fend off any ships
moving towords the quarinteen line and get reports from the killing fleet,
just in case the killing fleets stir up something realy bad, like a fleet
from the black currtain. Would also mean that the 20 pasecs to the quarinteen
would be regarded by those systems as safe as houses, and also provide,
inmormation on those systems (detaled, to twoo killers should be providing
basic information), and an incresed trade with the Regence, cos of shore
leave
etc ... should make the systems easier to intergrate.

Once the killing fleets kill all but the wanderes between the G rift and the
Windhorn one fleet patrols the line into Vland, while the other continues to
patrol within corridor "showwing the flag" while the quarinteen fleet catches
up.

After corridore and the one above it (forgotten the name) are cleared and
quarinteened. Strategic naval basses should be set up, just in case the
 big bad fleet turns up, and the teritry isn\'t lost too easily, you could
then start thinking about Vland, all in all it should only take about 10
years to get to Vland, before it could be incorperated as well.

 Frank Responds:
 "Odd as it may seem, the design sequence stands as is. It works
 in producing correct muzzle energies for everything _except_
 mortars, and mortars do not use the muzzle energy calculation for
 anything in the game.
 
 To determine nominal muzzle energy of mortars, multiply the
 energy on the cannon table by the length of the mortar barrel in
 calibers and multiply by 0.0015. (Note that this includes the
 modifications to ME caused by the mortar configuration). Thus a
 40L5 mortar has a muzzle energy of 2.625 Mj."

FYI.  See below for a portion on a Reuter news article on non-lethal weapons.
 These are examples from a TL 8 culture.  How about some of you free thinkers
coming up with some Traveller non-lethal weapons.

I can just see a band of Star Vikings/Lancers/Traders stumbling across a
culture that abhors violence but is willing to defend themselves ;-).

Also, these types on weapons would be good for anti-hijacking devices.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
"Marines To Use \'Non-Lethal\' Arms In Somalia   

    WASHINGTON (Reuter) - U.S. Marines will be armed with new non-lethal
weapons from ``bee-sting\'\' hand grenades to nozzle guns that spray foam
barriers when they land in Somalia to protect a U.N. troop withdrawal, the
Pentagon said Friday [2/17/95]...The Pentagon official said four weapons new
to the military -- although tested and approved for riot-control by U.S.
police departments -- will be carried by Marines expected to soon go ashore
in Mogadishu. They are: 

    --small stinger hand grenades, which explode into hard rubber pellets,
causing painful stings like those from a bee; 

    --wooden and rubber pellets fired at the ground in front of unruly crowds
from 12-gauge shotguns and 40mm hand grenade launchers, which ricochet into
legs and cause bruises; 

    --machines that lay down a stinging barrier of bubbles laced with teargas
200 feet long, 20 feet wide and four feet high; 

    --and a backpack that feeds a nozzle gun to lay down another type of
crowd barrier, this one a thick, sticky foam that constrains the movement of
individuals trapped in it. "

    'from' => 'Michael Llaneza mllaneza@mercury.sfsu.ed',
    'body' => 'In reference to Alvin\'s note below......

I have just purchased Striker II (first paycheck !!) and expect to play 
shortly. I haven\'t noticed any serious problems from just reading the rules.

I do note that the scenarios are geared towards 25mm scale and are 
consequently infantry heavy. I like 1:300 and armor and will be writing 
some scenarios along that line. Fortunately I have a large (3m x 4m) 
floorspace to contain an armored scenario. More on this as it develops.

On the topic, I thought I\'d make some suggestions as to 1:300 scale 
miniatures.

First, Games Workshop\'s Space Marine figures. The plastic sets are ideal 
for building an infantry force. Each army has two boxes of infantry 
available. One has one model hundreds of time over (used to be 200, I 
think they\'ve cut the boxes in half) and 20-30 vehicles meant as APC\'s. 
The second box has a variety of infantry models, including command 
models, heavy weapons, and some light vehicles or support weapons.

I have before me the second box for the Space Marines. It contains:

10 Robots	  14mm tall, big guns, humanoid
20 Captains	  6.5 mm tall, no helmet (!), looks like a veteran
20 Heavy Weapons  big shoulder mounted missile launcher
10 Commanders	  flag on backpack, sword held aloft
200 Marines	  6.25 mm tall, infantry in powered armor, 
20 Terminators	  9mm tall, heavy armor, pity there aren\'t more of them
40 jump troops	  flight pack, sword and pistol.
20 Bikers	  power armored troops on bikes, yeah sure guys. might work
10 Landspeeders	  2-seat open flying vehicle, armed.

This lot _was_ 20 bucks. I believe the quantities have been halved, and 
the prices are probably $15 for half the above quantities. But the above 
box will produce, oh at 4 models per stand (20x20mm) 50 stands of 
infantry, less command stands and support stands.
	A platoon of Imperial Marines (Striker II pp 138) needs 16 stands,
6 of them command stands.  The above box would give you 3 platoons. Going
down to 3 figs per stand will let you field a company for $30 with some
left over. The APC\'s would come from the Centurion miniatures mentioned
below; 6 APC\'s to a platoon, 25 to a company. 

Some suggestions for using these figures:
The Imperial Guard work for generic infantry, Space Marines will do for
battledress troops for the Imperium or RC, and the Eldar should work well
for Zhodani infantry. In the Marine sets you will find some very passable
tracked APC\'s; the Rhinos are perfect and the Land Raiders less so. The
Eldar have a plastic tank that comes with the basic infantry that is
turretless, but makes a passable grav tank or apc. The sets of mixed
infantry for each army provide models that will work for the specialist
infantry; the Eldar have some figures that would work well for Consulate
Commandos. Most of the command figures from GW are either the steel-jawed
hero (if you can tell in 1:300) or a figure with a flag or battle
standard. No, Traveller doesn\'t have troops running about with swords in
powered armor, or carrying battle-standards, but they make a stand _look_
like a command stand so they have their uses. A little creativity goes a
long way here. When I build a specification listing, I\'ll put it up so
that others can just go shopping and paint their figs. 

	The second source for cheap, high quality models is the ex-FASA 
Centurion game. There are at least two boxes of plastic armor available. 
Each box has about 3 dozen figures for about $20. The tanks are a bit 
smaller than the scale used by the GW figures above, but are close 
enough. Each box has a couple of varieties of tanks and APC\'s; enough for 
a battalion as I recall. There are also metal figures available, at a 
higher price of course.

	Thirdly, Soldiers and Swords Games (SSG) is producing models for 
Ogre Miniatures. I hope we\'ve all played Ogre and GEV, even if not 
recently. Anyone who has read this far, and has never played either is 
missing a lot. They have a line of largish models, closer in scale to the 
GW figs than the Centurion models, but are very science-fictioney and 
well designed. The two models of hovertanks (scout models - not MBT\'s) 
are excellent, and the other tanks look great for TL9+ guntracks and 
battle taxis. They also do a line of buildings that you will absolutely 
want for 1:300 Striker.

	Fourth, go for some modern or WWII microarmor. I\'m partial to 
GHQ, but Scotia (who has some SF models I haven\'t seen) and C-in-C will 
do fine. Look for : trucks! gotta have \'em for the Wilds, and some 
may convert well to grav vehicles. I have seen some of the ex-Soviet 
missile launchers from GHQ, I want some for planetary defence and heavy 
AA launchers.  I expect that there are now Scud\'s and Patriots as well. 
Helicopters are good too. I note that many of the obscure WWII tanks will 
not look out of place as guntracks since most people won\'t recognize 
them. Last seen the French and Italian AFV\'s came in mixed packs. These 
models, especially the cheaper models, will also provide parts for 
conversions. Just swapping turrets will produce a new model.


	Fith, Scotia and Irregular both produce 1:300 SP miniatures. I 
may actually have seen some of the Scotia figures, I don\'t recall being 
impressed. I have never seen the Irregulars. I don\'t have addresses for 
either of these companies, nor have I seen a recent catalog.


	Lastly, I\'d like to reccomend the old Milton Bradley game
Invasion:America. Not only a fun game in its own right (there was never 
any agreement as to which side would always win, so strategy was the 
key), but it had a lot of plastic figures in it. There were wheeled 
APC\'s, hovertanks, high-tech attack helos, and a bomber that looks 
perfect for the grav-speeder role. This game is out of production, so 
check your local used game store or a convention. The infantry models are 
about 18-20mm tall, so they won\'t fit with the armor.

I\'ll keep this list and develop it for a WWW site to be named later.

 Just a quick head\'s up: as well publicised in a small country
just a little to the north of here, some "non-leathal" weapons 
like you describe can actually occasionally kill. A little more
frequently they can leave people permanently maimed.
 Just be sure to interpret "non-leathal" as "not primarily
designed to be leathal" in your games and work out some sort
of "acceptable casuality" rating :-).

 Hmm. People are already talking about lasers that blind
people. Why not lasers that temporarily blind people? If chemistry
progresses why not tear gas that is more effective and with
less side effects. Go back to classic Moorcock ideas and have
hypnotising strobes?
 Some, less enlightened (or more enlightened depending on
your viewpoint) planets might require mandatory implanting of
a disabling post-hypnotic suggestion that can be activated
by the police.
 We already know that strobing a light at 3Hz (?) and playing
a tone at 10Hz (?) cause epileptic fits in 1 in 10 people. Say
this was refined to a much better system.
 How\'s that?

This made me think of the weapon that was the plot device for the
movie, _Looker_:

It was gun shaped and emitted some kind of strobe effect that caused
the target to basically do nothing for a short period of time (1
minute, perhaps). Also, during this period of inactivity, the target
was effectively unconscious and would not remember anything.  From the
target\'s perspective, they would appear to have leaped forward in time
instantly.

Since it depended upon a strobing light effect, it was only effective
if you looked at the ``gun\'\' while it was being fired (it worked
through mirrors, as I recall).

  I see great minds work alike.  I am using space marine /ogre/GHQ miniatures
for striker II as well. I think they work great. Unfortunately there are few good
grav tanks/vehs. on the market so they must be conversions.  The heavy
tank for ogre should work well.  Shave off the treads at a reverse angle and
use alot hobby putty, paint and da-daa ! instant grav tank.
  Also for small skirmish actions don\'t overlook the space marine 25mm line.
(40K)In fact I think the 40K rules are horrible. They scream for a simple  yet
realistic system like striker II. I am currently using FF And S to convert 
Space marines weapons and vehicles to striker. If anyone is interested
just tell me and I will post the weapons and vehicles as they come out
of the factory.....

In addition to being able to induce a fugue state of variable length
  (several minutes at least), the strobe could also be set to cause
  an effect very similar to psionic invisibility - the subject would
  mentally \'edit out\' the presence of the person who flashed them.

The best example of this was a fight scene where one combatant was
  being hit over and over by an \'invisible\' assailant.  By a lucky
  accident, he found that he could partially see his opponent as

All in all, a rather interesting (and powerful!) item to drop into a

the development of instantaneous communications, the financial markets 
weren\'t very well developed.  The development of the limited liability 
company didn\'t occur until -- what -- the 17th Century, and easy 
incorporation and public trading of stock weren\'t common until the 
mid-19th C.  By that time, the newspapers could get information by 
telegraph, and it was only a few short steps (with a big stumble in 1929) 
to Quotrons, world-wide cross-border equity and currency flows, and 
programmed trading.  That situation then lasts -- becoming more refined 
-- for some three hundred years, until the explosion of the Terrans into 
Vilani space.

How did the Vilani finance empire-spanning companies like Makhidkarun, 
Naasirka, and others?

How did the Solomani finance their explorations and conquests?

More to the point, after three thousand years of a steadily shrinking (in 
terms of time to get information) area of known space, how do the 
megacorporations raise funds?  We know that they are corporations, with 
some stock held by the public (see the Library Data article on 
megacorporations).  Where are the markets at which the public can buy 
stock (and, presumably, debt instruments)?  How do individual investors 
gauge the financial condition and future prospects of the company?  The 
major lenders and institutional investors are in an easier position, 
because they typically aren\'t going to speculate on the LICs\' short-term 
performance, but can do reasonable due diligence.

I suppose that there is a strain of Virus that perverts Quotron machines, 
too.  After the collapse, there will be a need to finance new ventures.  
Some capital will come from taxes, but some will come from investors 
("Buy Regency Bonds and help Norris help us get out of the sticks!").  
How will they assess risk, given communication time lags?  (Time lags 
become shorter after the collapse, because the markets are smaller.)

I solicit any comments about how the financial markets will work in and 
after the Third Imperium, whether directly related to these issues or not.

These were the simple guidelines I used:

I figured that there were major stock exchanges at the subsector capitals,
and maybe on planets well-connected to the rest of the Imperium or with
big populations.  Megacorps would be traded on all exchanges, but the
littler companies would only be traded in their primary area of operations.

Electronic "certificates" of shares of stock would be electronically 
recorded and either kept in a local datasystem or "printed" onto a
virtually unforgable portable card for interstellar transport, which
would be standardized by the "Ministry of Finance" (my local version
of a Treasury Dept/SEC for the Imperium, since I don\'t think anyone
ever made one).  

[Adventure possibilities with forgers, of course.  Most would fail,
and get nailed by the Ministry of Justice.]

Travelers could arrange to have their stock traded by a local broker,
and have the changes put on the card, which would indicate a certain
number of valid shares.  You could keep several cards and records, but
the only shares that you could actually trade are the ones you could
get at.  If you were on Aramis, and wanted to sell the 10,000 shares
of Tukera you had on Regina, you\'d have to send registered xmail to
Regina to have your broker issue the sell order.  If you wanted to
sell the 10,000 shares of Oberlindes that you had with on the ship,
you make arrangements with a local broker and can do it now.

Making projections are a pain, and it\'s virtually impossible to know
the current state of a large interstellar firm at any one time.
Sort of like Renaissance Italy -- you just have to wait for the
trade fleet to make it into port, and you can\'t know if a storm
delayed it three weeks out of home.  So it can be a bit risky,
but sector corps and megacorps are fairly safe bets.

The megacorps, especially banking and investment ones like Hortalez
and Zirunkariish probably keep their own courier service.  Even the
little Oberlindes interface-line kept a jump-5 courier net in its\'
main operating area in Regina and Aramis (in Traveller Adventure).
Jump-6 is expensive to maintain, but the megacorps are probably
rich enough to maintain it for limited internal use connecting a
fairly small number of vital hubs.

It\'s an OS/2 REXX script I wrote to apply the Collapse Effects rules to
existing Genie-format sector files (which may even re-appear in the archives if
and when GDW ever makes up its mind on the copyright issues...)  There are
several other scripts for mangling your sector files in various ways that
should
be available... I haven\'t checked to see what actually got uploaded -- I
don\'t have
ftp upload capability yet, so I have to ask someone else (thanks, Ken!) to
take care
of it.

Anyway, REXX is useful if you have a computer with a REXX interpreter on it. OS/2
comes with it built in, Amiga has an implementation called ARexx, there are PD Rexxes
for most Unix flavors, and, since it was originally an IBM mainframe shell language, it
is probably available on any IBM "big iron" you might have lying around.  There are 
also REXX implementations for DOS, but not freeware, as far as I know.  Someone
who had Personal REXX for DOS downloaded the programs; he never told me how well
they worked in that version of REXX (Jeff? ).

    'index' => 'ao370',
    'body' => 'TO: xboat@mpgn.com

During a discussion of lasers and defenses against them on
rec.arts.sf.science, I came to some interesting conclusions about about
sandcasters.

What got me started was someone talking about using some sort of
miniaturized "corner reflectors" for laser defense. I happened to
remember that there\'s *another* way to get much the same effect. (the
effect being "reflex reflection", the phenomenon of reflecting a beam of
light more or less back at its source).

What is this other method? Use tiny transperent spheres. The internal
reflections will bounce the light back at the source, with a bit of a
spread, and a moderate amount of chromatic aberration. This is how we get
rainbows. It\'s also how the reflective street signs, painted strips on
the roads, and reflective tape on clothing work.

All the reflective gimmicks above use tiny glass beads. (very tiny!).

It occurred to me that if similar beads *aren\'t* what sandcasters are
loaded with, they ought to be!

Here\'s what would happen when a laser hit a cloud of such "beads".

First, the bead would bounce most of the beam back at the source (or at
least fairly close to it). While this would be too dispersed to be a
serious threat to the firing ship, it would result in an increase in the
temperature of anything on that side of the ship. It\'d also play hell
with any sensors affected by the wavelength in question. This would even
work to some extent with x-ray lasers, as the internal reflections in the
beads tend to be of the "grazing incidence" type required for decent
reflection of x-rays! A small portion of the beam would be reflected from
the surface of the bead, and thus be scattered.

Next, the bead would heat up, as the portion of the beam it didn\'t
reflect would be absorbed, resulting in heating. How much heating depends
on the composition of the bead, the wavelength of the laser, and possibly
on the *size* of the bead. Eventually (probably in seconds or less) the
bead will melt. But since it is in freefall in a vacuum, it\'ll stay
spherical! So it\'ll keep reflecting, just at lesser efficiency!

Eventually, the bead will start boiling. At this point the absorption
will probably take a drastic jump, and the bead will quickly flash into
vapor. The vapor will continue to absorb at least some of the laser
energy going thru it, until it ionizes and forms a plasma. How much the
vapor absorbs, and how easily it ionizes will depend on the omposition of
the bead.

Once it\'s a plasma, it may be very transperent or very aborbent depending
on the composition and the laser wavelength. Plasmas tend to have *very*
strong absorption bands! Proper selection of bead composition could cause
the plasma to be *very* opaque at common weapon-grade laser wavelengths.

Even better, the plasma can be made to emit energy at other wavelengths
when "pumped" by some wavelengths. This can increase the sensor jamming
effects.

Given how long the Imperium and others have been playing with laser
weapons, I\'d be willing to bet that the "sand" in the sandcasters is an
optimized mixture of various beads optimized for reflecting and later
absorbing various sorts of laser wavelengths.

There\'s probably a "general" mix, selected to be reasonably effective
against the sort of stuff a normal ship might run into. Warships going
into combat against a specific enemy may carry large amounts of a mix
optimized against the wavelengths the enemy is know to use.

Definitely something to think about...

BTW, this would make a laser attack intercepted by "sand" into a quite
spectacular lightshow!

Production of "beads" is rather simple given access to free fall and
vacuum. Determining the "best" materials would take a lot of research,

    I\'M interested in the philosophy being used by starship designers out
 there.  what are the general guidelines people out there are using when
 building warships for an imperaial space background.
      just to foster discussion, her are the guideline I use

  1. armor is your friend. most warship want a armor values around 100.
    the few Cubic meter you lose will be made up for with the protection
    gained.

2. One big hole is better to many little holes.  Putting 1 150 point blast
   into an enemy is better then 3 50 point blast.  The bigger damage, the
more
likely you can cause a critical hit and totally take out cital systems (i.e,
   life support, powerplant, etc.).

3.  If you ship\'s mission is to \'lie in the line\' keep the small craft to the
s
mallest number possable.  Unless you design is going to carry a large number
of troops, or be used for police/coast guard type duties a good deal, forget
th
e small crate use the space something mission related (i.e., firepower)

4.  I allways use lazer turret/barrbet insted of nuclear dampers turrerts/
    barrbets;a lazer is more flexible.  A lazer allow you to stop a missle
from
    you, but tne can be used to hit the person who fired that missile at you.

5. no MFD = DEAD


I still have not come up with a good answer a few question like these.

what is a good g-rating for a war ship of given size?

how long should a ship design to work with a fleet take to purify it fuel?

any and all comment are welcomed

I have a few questions on FF and S
pg 146
how is average velocity calculated????

     
on pg 70 - self contained thusters
is the FC rate mass in kg or tons for thrust calulations?

I was wondering if any errata sheets for Striker II are out yet.

Also  a question about striker II.  On pages 132 and 133 it mentions
notes about the missiles,, Where are these notes located??

Also some other comments...

  1.  FFS- On small turrets FFS  have some huge multipliers for space.
       I understand some of the problems with the mechanics of multiple
        turrets, but surely some of these could be solved with high tech. 
levels.
       For example I designed a small turret for a APC. The Heavy mg
       I designed took up about 2 square meters. That\'s 20 cubed
       meters(!!!) of space with the *10 modifier. Did I do something wrong? 

       It the very least I would think you could have a unpowered cupola 
that
       would be crewed.(Such as the M48 and the  M60 have).  I am sure you 
would have
       a space/wt. limit , but it would serve for small weapons since it 
would not take
       up alot of space. :-)

   2.  Pg. 126 of the Reformation equipment manual has a Pyrrhus tank and a 
12mj
        fusion gun of 40 penetration. In the striker manual the same vehicle 
has a
         penetration of about 100. Which one is correct?

   I\'m assuming here that the Second Solomani Rim War (what the
Solomani call the Rebellion) doesn\'t happen, and that you are running
a varient campaign.

   "Terran Nationalism" would be a natural development, as Terra is not
truly "Imperial" nor for that matter truly "Solomani".  Depending on how
things develop in your campaign, Solomani to the Terrans could have
the same implications as "Imperial" does in the RC.

   The problem is that neither the Imperium or the Solomani would have
allowed the Solomani to establish a "Switzerland" type state between
them.  The Solomani in particular would have been against it, as Terra
is their theoretical homeworld.

   Sealing off the borders would even be more problematic.  The fleet
required would be massive, as Terra doesn\'t have any rifts to isolate
itself from anyone.

   If they don\'t have "little black boxes" what do they have?  They have
to have some way of telling good guys from bad guys--that would be
critical to enforcing a blockade, unless you are prepared to visually
communicate with all ship traffic (military and commercial), and don\'t
mind blowing up the ocassional ship who\'s communications array isn\'t
working.

   The other presumption is  that the Terrans would *know* to do away
with "little black boxes" because they transmit Virus.  Up to 1130, no
one had any reason to believe that these devices would be the death
of most of interstellar civilization.  A time traveler could go back and tell
them to destroy the boxes  and why (assuming that anyone who
listen to him or her), but that would be about the only way.

   This goes without saying....particularly the killing of vampire ships
part.

   I would be happy to answer more specific questions.  Theories on
the Solomani would take up quite a bit of bandwidth.

   But it is also true that you can\'t make your ship damage proof either.
Beyond armor value 100, you reach a point of diminishing returns rather
quickly.

   The old rule of 1 turret per 100 tons displacement having gone the
way of thruster plates, you can now mount as many weapons as you
have personnel/power/surface area.  But you are right, the bigger
the punch, generally the better.  I say generally because of the ability of
"low wattage" lasers to strip off surface fixtures (like antennas) and
shoot down missiles.  I strongly recommend on a warship a mix of
both.

>3.  If you ship\'s mission is to \'lie in the line\' keep the small craft to

>(i.e., firepower)

   That depends.  If you plan on being able to evacuate your crew
quickly should something happen to the ship, then you need more
small craft.  Passenger liners would almost certainly have to have
enough small craft to hold all the passengers and crew in a disaster
using cramped seating  (ever try to show a stressed out mother holding
two children how to use an emergency one-man evacuation bubble?
I wouldn\'t try it....).  On military craft, all small craft (outside of
fighters,
which should be of the multi-role variety) should be as ulitiarian as
possible.  For example, the same boat that carries the suppiles should
also have removable seats available for passenger transport.

   Very true.  Any nuclear damper proponents out there?

>5. no MFD = DEAD

   While individual gunners can continue to fire weapons if the MFD
is down, not having a MFD can ruin your whole week.  It\'s usually a
good idea on a warship to have at least one backup.

>I still have not come up with a good answer a few question like these.
>
>what is a good g-rating for a war ship of given size?

   The maximum for the tech level.  No one says you have to burn that
many G-turns all the time (something about running out of fuel), but it
is nice to have the acceleration (or deceleration), as under the right
circumstances it can save your ship.

>how long should a ship design to work with a fleet take to purify it fuel?

   That depends.  I\'d say 24 hours as a good guess.  The longer you
take the refuel, the longer you have to stay in one place.  If your ship
(fleet) is hurting or seriously undergunned (or both) sitting in one place
too long can be fatal.  If you plan on your ships operating in fleets or
large task forces all the time (accompanied by a tanker/fuel refinery),
and your ships don\'t routinely refine their own fuel, you could get by with
significantly longer  processing times.  I would never design a starship
that couldn\'t refine it own fuel, as Murphy\'s Law can be *very*
unforgiving.  Better to be stuck in a system for a few weeks refining fuel
your shuttle scoops up by the thumble full than to be stuck in a system
permanently or misjump into deep space.

 Yes, that was me.  I haven\'t had the chance to clean out the 
 mailreader debris from the files and try them, though.  I _will_ 
 do so in the nearest future that I can manage, and if they take 
 any tweaking, I\'ll note what, and, subject to a veto by any of the 
 authors, I\'ll willingly mail the mods to whoever wants them...

 I believe that the PD/shareware REXX interpreter called 
 "Regina" can be mad to run on DOS systems; I believe that the GNU 
 project also has or is working on a REXX interpreter, which will 
 also be easily modifiable to run on DOS.

 I understand that there are several DOS/Windows REXX interpreters 
 available; the only ones I can speak for are the Quercus Personal 
 REXX products for both DOS and Windows.  The latter is advertised 
 as being very highly compatible with the REXX that comes with 
 OS/2.

Comments that follow are merely my opinion; my designs have
not yet been tested in combat, so bear this disclaimer in mind...

Considering the ease with which I can design a laser that will trivially
punch thru several hundred points of armor, I think 100 AV is so low
as to be useless.  Why pay the weight penalty for no gain?  Either 
use really heavy armor (500+ points) or don\'t bother with armor at all.

1000-pt holes are even better...  On the other hand, 3x 50 point shots will
knock down 3 incoming det-laser missiles, while 1 150-point blast will 
knock down 1 of those missiles while the other 2 detonate and shred your
ship.

This seems too trivial to mention.  I always assume small craft are their 
for a reason, not just decoration.  At the very least, a several hundred-man
crew needs some way for crew members to go and from the ship without
the ship docking at station everytime a crewmember needs to get on and
off.... In the Navy, we called \'em "Liberty boats", for their most common
use.

And they\'re cheaper, less power-hungry, available at lower tech levels, etc.
I prefer lasers to particle beams, for the same reasons.

>5. no MFD = DEAD

Can\'t argue with that.

>I still have not come up with a good answer a few question like these.
>what is a good g-rating for a war ship of given size?

As high as you can squeeze into the crate without squeezing your
crew into thin layers of goo on the wall when you light off the drive...
The practical limit is probably 2Gs higher than your Grav Compensators
can handle at the "strapped into workstations" level.  Add 1G for 
Grav tanks, if you can handle the expense and extra volume, and 
an really elite crew may be able to handle the extra level of difficulty
for doing tasks at 1 higher G than compensated for, so add another G.
Of course, you may not be able to squeeze that much drive and 
reaction mass into your hull, depending on your tech level, so that is
another limit.  But your maneuver Gs are your limit on evasion mods,
your ability to pursue the enemy, and your ability to flee him, if necessary,
so the higher, the better.

>how long should a ship design to work with a fleet take to purify it fuel?

It shouldn\'t.  Fleet Tankers and Fuelers should be designed to handle
scooping/slurping fuel and refining it.  A warship shouldn\'t have the extra
clutter of a fuel refinery and scoops, unless it has a heck of a lot of spare
space available.  As for the Fleet Fuelers, how often do you want the fleet
to be able to move?  That determines how fast they should be able to 
process fuel.  One constraint: obviously, they don\'t need to process it any 
faster than it can be scooped or slurped.

There\'s a fix in the Striker II rules -- if your small turret winds up bigger
than a large turret, I think you give up and make it a large turret.

GDW fixed the energy weapon design rules in the FF&S errata published
in Striker II; the numbers in the Striker II manual are up-to-date and 
closest to correct.

It seems that the Solomani gave the term to themselves... however, you 
can keep your understanding of the term, it sound\'s cooler than the 
offical version.

In a post-Collapse enviroment, it\'s possible that the Solomani returned 
to their Terran root\'s (remember, the homeworld is still named Terra); 
also, the empire may be centred on Terra.

What did you do with the Solomani doctrine of racial superiority/destiny?

Did the Imperium mean "suppression and conformity"?  Well, to the 
Terran\'s, yes -- the solomani sphere was a federation of individual 
interstellar government\'s, centred around the doctrine of Solomani 
superiority and the Rule of Man (the ideology, not the Second Imperium).
Single worlds could fight against each other, and have minor trade scraps 
that would be forbidden in the Imperium.

In your universe... in the offical universe, the Solomani were busy 
grabbing some border regions, abnd having a difficult time fighting the 
Daibei and the Vegans.  They was also internal dissension regarding a 
`softening\' of Solomani doctrine.

[Does anyone here know why the Solomani didn\'t conquer much mopre than 
\'border regions\'?  Apparently, GDW consider\'s them to be military 
incompetents - after all, due to tech level\'s and population alone, they 
should have never lost the Solomani Rim in the Rim War.]

Major question: why did the Terran Empire cut itself off from the Third 
Imperium during the Rebellion, instead of grabbing everything it could?

You\'d need to justify how the Terran\'s managed to recover so quickly.  
Four point\'s on your side: they have a treasure trove of stuff and old 
info on Terra, which would help relearning everything quickly; The 
Terrans were more into biotech than the Imperium, which would both reduce 
their dependence on electronic technology and give them experience to 
deal with a carbon-based, electronic lifeform like Virus much quickly; 
there were a variety of widely differing tech standard in the Solomani 
confederation, which would slow Virus\' spread; and the Hivers managed to 
recover quickly, showing that it _can_ be done.

This is a good description.  Tell your guy\'s to be more careful as they 
go closer to th e Black Sphere, though -- up there, Virus is *organized*.

Question: what happened to the rimward portion\'s of the Solomani 
confederation?

Someone with "Solomani and Aslan" aka Rats & Cats help this man!

The only thing I can say is 
   A) The Rule of Man lasted 400 years
   B) It was founded by Hiroshi I (who never crowned himself) who 
condicted a peaceful coup, with naval support
   C) It fell due to poor economic management: the Old Earth Union, 
however, survived until the coming of the Imperium
   D) The Solomani were part of the Imperium from 550? to after the First 
Civil War, when the Emperor (until then, always a pureblood Solomani) 
married into a wealthy Vilani industrialist family.  Soon thereafter, the 
Solomani were allowed to seperate.  The Rim War was fought (offically) to 
retake Terra, and weaken (alleged) Solomani racism.

There are a series of good post\'s on the sublect, and Ranke (?) wrote up 
an article on this subject, where slip\'s me right now.

Armour values of 100???                     <giggles of Zhodani glee>

Sir, there are quite a number of ship\'s our there with armour of 1700, 
last time I heard!

I *think* that Booneviles\' Anzanhi High Lightning, a typical 
Imperial cruiser, has armour of 600.

Yes: but don\'t forget the power of fighters as reusable missiles and 
sensor pads.

Don\'t forget that most Imperial Campagin capital ship\'s use meson gun\'s 
and Particle Accellerators as the main gun.  PA\'s cause radiation damage, 
and only nuclear dampers will help here.

[NOTE: if you chech the number\'s, massive lasers as the main gun gives 
the most bang for the buck: this isn\'t what the Offical Version calls 
for.  Someone DID post a fix...]

> 5. no MFD = DEAD

Very, very true.  Don\'t forget that MFD\'s can usually control multiple 
missiles, but only one laser/meson/PS weapon.

> I still have not come up with a good answer a few question like these.
>

Standard Imperial Doctrine calls for jump-6, maneuver-4 ships as a minimum.
Fighter\'s NEED maneuver-6.  Battleship\'s and dreadnaughts are 
occasionally built with less maneuver, down to maneuver-2.
 
> how long should a ship design to work with a fleet take to purify it fuel?

No offical doctrine here, but I recomment keeping the number below five
hours: three may be idea.

I\'m publishing the documents in pdf format - which I know isn\'t completely

I saw this on the news last night - it\'s absolutely disgusting stuff!

There are quite a few non-lethal weapons being developed atm, including
anti-vehicular weapons (sprays that stop engines working, slippery liquids
to make steering difficult, etc), sonic weapons, flash grenades to
temporarily blind, lasers to *permanently* blind, non-nuclear EMP-bombs
to fry electronics, etc.

AIUI, most people used the black boxes - Aslan, Darrians, Vargr, Solomani,
etc. They were too useful *not* to use, and Imperial law required traders
to have them.

That\'s not Terran-specific - everyone feels like that.

\'Any info\' is a bit vague - what in particular do you want to know?

   Perhaps that\'s why many air forces use them to keep from shooting
down their own aircraft.  IFF interrogators (which is what they use) are
essentially transponders that tell friendlys on the ground and in the air
that you\'re one of the good guys.  Without them, air control on a modern
battlefield is virtually impossible.  Speaking of air control, on the
commercial side of things, various types of transponders are used by
aircraft and ground stations to speed up the landing process and
assist air traffic controllers in keeping straight who\'s who on the
radar screen.  Those of you who have seen the movie "Die Hard II"
saw just how dependent airports (and airplanes) are on transponders
(and what happens when they give the wrong information).  Without that
technology, you have to cut way back on the number of airplanes (or
starships) you have in the sky (or in orbit) at any given time.

   I think as the RC continues to expand and increase its star and space
ship population, some kind of transponder system will have to be
introduced.  Certainly the civilized portions of the Regency continued
to have transponder systems (of a different type, no doubt) after the
Collapse and up to the New Era.

   Why is the return on your investment better at 500+ points?  From

   We are in complete disagreement here, for reasons I stated in my
previous post.  In large scale actions, the first things that people tend
to shoot at are the support ships (battletenders, etc.).  No refueling
capability is even deadlier to a ship than no MFD, IMHO, since a ship
without a MFD can still shoot but a ship without fuel is a drifting target.

   We agree here.  Fleets that rely on tankers for their primary refueling
capability need to be able to get their tankers in and out fast, since a raid
by enemy defense boats can ruin a tanker\'s day (even its whole
week).

1) This is how I\'m justifying why Terrans don\'t like the phrase "Solomani",
even though they created the phrase: during the occupation of Earth by the
Imperium, "Solomani" became a durogatory phrase. Words do, after all, change
connotation. And, yes, Terrans still consider themselves racially superior
to Vilani - I can\'t think of any idea why they wouldn\'t.

2) There\'s a reason why the Terrans cut themselves off. After the Occupation
of Terra, the Terrans naturally could not stand being controlled by
"inferior Vilani", and declared war on the Imperium.
They staged several rebellions and various other
"subversive" and "terrorist" activities. Of course, the Imperium was just a
wee bit PISSED OFF about this, and there was a great military prescence in
that subsector.

After the Imperium fell, much of that military prescence was disbanded, and
the Terrans were able to "Drive out" any stragglers. However, Terra and
the surrounding area was devestated, and the Terrans needed time to rebuild.
When Virus came, the Terrans were still in the early stages of rebuilding
their area of space. Since they were rebuilding virtually everything - and
that includes replacing destroyed or worn out electronic equipment and
starships, Terran scientists were able to recognize Virus as a problem and
deal with it.

One more point about Virus: the Terrans still have a bit of a racial
superiority
complex and would be damned before recognizing Virus as a living entity.

As always, I will solicit any comments.

Ok, betrayal of ignorance time.  I have to admit that I don\'t dig
all of this jargon.

Mush sounds like something my mother used to spoon-feed me when I was
a baby, and moo?  Well, I thought that "moo" was the sound a cow made.

The only thing I know for sure is that there is exactly one "r" in
"query."

So, I\'m a grown boy now and I feel that this gives me the right
to say that I don\'t know what the hell you\'re talking about.

Could someone enlighten me?

Because of the large travel time needed in the Traveller universe, I 
doubt that aone-month membership\'s would be used.

In the offical Imperial Campagin, The Traveller\'s Aid Society is an 
exclusive interstellar social club _first_, and only secondarily a genuine
aid society like, say, The Last Minute Club in Canada (which provides 
discounted travel rates and packages for members).  This would reduce 
Yearlong membership\'s to, maybe, a `trial\' period.

I seem to remember that the cost for membership is 1 million credits: I 
should look it up again when I get home. 

Oh yeah, since the Imperial Government uses Traveller\'s Aid ratings as
a semi-offical rating system, a number of close connections with 
government and nobles would not be out of character.

Make that a 50,000 charge limit, and you\'d be closer to the feel of the 
Society.  Don\'t forget the free high-passage ticket\'s!

No doubt, the actual scope of the Traveller\'s Aid society has been 
documented elsewhere.  Any researchers out there?

**ACLU CYBER-LIBERTIES ALERT** 
 
FIGHT ONLINE CENSORSHIP! 
 
AXE THE EXON BILL! 
 
The American Civil Liberties Union urges you to contact the members of the
U.S. Senate Commerce Committee and your own Senators to ask them to oppose
the efforts to turn online communications into the most heavily censored
form of American media. 
 
In a clumsy effort to purge sexual expression from the Internet and other
online networks, the self-described "Communications Decency Act of 1995"
(S.314, introduced by Senator Exon on 2/2/95) would make ALL
telecommunications service providers liable for every message, file, or
other content carried on their networks.  Senator Exon is planning to
attach the bill to Senator Pressler\'s new telecommunications legislation,
which is targeted for action in early March. 
 
The Exon proposal would severely restrict the flow of online information by
requiring service providers to act as private censors of e-mail messages,
public forums, mailing lists, and archives to avoid criminal liability. 
The ACLU believes that online users should be the only censors of the
content of the information they receive. 
 
**The Exon proposal broadens existing law by subjecting service providers,
as well as the individuals who actually send messages, to criminal
liability for any "obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent" message
transmitted over their networks.** 
 
If enacted into law, this vague and overly broad legislation could have the
following draconian effects: 
 
 * The Exon proposal would prohibit communications with sexual content
through private e-mail between consenting adults, and would inhibit people
from making comments that might or might not be prohibited. 
 
 * Under the Exon proposal, service providers would pay up to $100,000 or
spend up to 2 years in jail for prohibited content produced by subscribers
on other networks, over which they had no control. 
 
 * The Exon proposal would expand current restrictions on telephone access
by minors to dial-a-porn services to include online access to indecent
material, requiring service providers to purge "indecent" material from
public bulletin boards and discussion groups to avoid accidental viewing by
a minor. 
 
In effect, online providers would be forced to offer to adults only that
content that is "suitable for minors." 
 
 
S. 314 is nearly identical to an amendment Senator Exon successfully
attached to last year\'s Senate version of the telecommunications law
overhaul.  Last year\'s bill died for unrelated reasons, but the Senate
Commerce Committee is determined to pass new telecommunications legislation
this year that could easily include the Exon proposal. 
 
The ACLU opposes the restrictions on speech imposed by this legislation
because they violate the First Amendment\'s guarantee of free expression. 
Forcing carriers to pre-screen content violates the Constitution and
threatens the free and robust expression that is the promise of the Net. 
The Constitution requires that any abridgement of speech use the least
restrictive means available -- the language of the Exon proposal is clearly
the most restrictive because it sweeps broadly against a wide array of
protected material involving sexual expression. 
 
Stop the information superhighway from becoming the most censored segment
of communications media! 
 
ACT NOW: 
 
Urge members of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and
Transportation: 
 
 *To oppose the Exon proposal, or any Senate or House variation. 
 
 *To drop the Exon proposal BEFORE it goes to the Senate floor.  
 
 *To hold full hearings on the Exon proposal and to review it thoroughly
before it goes to the Senate floor. 
 
 *To reject any effort to attach the Exon proposal to the Senate
telecommunications legislation. 
 
THE EXON PROPOSAL COULD BE LAW WITHIN WEEKS IF WE DON\'T ACT TODAY.

*** PROTECT THE INTERNET. READ THIS MESSAGE ***

This document is an electronic Petition Statement to the
U.S. Congress regarding pending legislation, the
"Communications Decency Act of 1995" (S. 314) which will
have, if passed, very serious negative ramifications for
freedom of expression on Usenet, the Internet, and all
electronic networks.  The proposed legislation would remove
guarantees of privacy and free speech on all electronic
networks, including the Internet, and may even effectively
close them down as a medium to exchange ideas and
information.

For an excellent analysis of this Bill by the Center for
Democracy and Technology (CDT), refer to the Appendix
attached at the end of this document.  The text to S. 314
is also included in this Appendix.

This document is somewhat long, but the length is necessary
to give you sufficient information to make an informed
decision.  Time is of the essence, we are going to turn
this petition and the signatures in on 3/16/95, so if you
are going to sign this please do so ASAP or at least before
midnight Wednesday, March 15, 1995.

Even if you read this petition after the due date, please
submit your signature anyway as we expect Congress to
continue debating these issues in the foreseeable future
and the more signatures we get, the more influence the
petition will have on discussion.  And even if Congress
rejects S. 314 while signatures are being gathered, do
submit your signature anyway for the same reason.

Please do upload this petition statement as soon as
possible to any BBS and on-line service in your area.
If you have access to one of the major national on-line
services such as CompuServe, Prodigy, AOL, etc., do try
to upload it there.  We are trying to get at least 5000
signatures.  Even more signatures are entirely possible
if we each put in a little effort to inform others, such
as friends and coworkers, about the importance of this
petition to electronic freedom of expression.

******(2) The Petition Statement

In united voice, we sign this petition against passage of S. 314 (the
"Communications Decency Act of 1995") for these reasons:

S. 314 would prohibit not only individual speech that is "obscene, lewd,
lascivious, filthy, or indecent", but would prohibit any provider of
telecommunications service from carrying such traffic, under threat of
stiff penalty.  Even aside from the implications for free speech, this
would cause an undue - and unjust - burden upon operators of the various
telecommunications services.  In a time when the citizenry and their
lawmakers alike are calling for and passing "no unfunded mandates" laws
to the benefit of the states, it is unfortunate that Congress might seek to
impose unfunded mandates upon businesses that provide the framework for
the information age.

An additional and important consideration is the technical feasibility of
requiring the sort of monitoring this bill would necessitate.  The
financial burden in and of itself - in either manpower or technology to
handle such monitoring (if even legal under the Electronic Communications
Privacy Act) - would likely cause many smaller providers to go out of
business, and most larger providers to seriously curtail their services.

The threat of such penalty alone would result in a chilling effect in the
telecommunications service community, not only restricting the types of
speech expressly forbidden by the bill, but creating an environment
contrary to the Constitutional principles of free speech, press, and
assembly - principles which entities such as the Internet embody as
nothing has before.

By comparison, placing the burden for content control upon each individual
user is surprisingly simple in the online and interactive world, and there
is no legitimate reason to shift that burden to providers who carry that
content.  Unlike traditional broadcast media, networked media is
comparatively easy to screen on the user end - giving the reader, viewer,
or participant unparalleled control over his or her own information
environment.  All without impacting or restricting what any other user
wishes to access.  This makes regulation such as that threatened by this
S. 314 simply unnecessary.

In addition, during a period of ever-increasing commercial interest in
arenas such as the Internet, restriction and regulation of content or the
flow of traffic across the various telecommunications services would have
serious negative economic effects.  The sort of regulation proposed by this
bill would slow the explosive growth the Internet has seen, giving the
business community reason to doubt the medium\'s commercial appeal.

We ask that the Senate halt any further progress of this bill.  We ask
that the Senate be an example to Congress as a whole, and to the nation
at large - to promote the general welfare as stated in the Preamble to
the Constitution by protecting the free flow of information and ideas
across all of our telecommunications services.

          ======================================
          Instructions for Signing This Petition
          ======================================

It must first be noted that this is a petition, not a
vote.  By "signing" it you agree with *all* the requests
made in the petition.  If you do not agree with everything
in this petition, then your only recourse is to not sign
it.

In addition, all e-mail signatures will be submitted to
Congress, the President of the United States, and the
news media.

Including your full name is optional, but *very highly
encouraged* as that would add to the effectiveness of the
petition.  Signing via an anonymous remailer is highly
discouraged, but not forbidden, as an attempt will be made
to separately tally signatures from anonymous remailers.

Because this is a Petition to the U.S. Congress, we ask
that you state, as instructed below, whether or not you
are a U.S. citizen.  We do encourage non-U.S. citizens to
sign, but their signatures will be tallied separately.

Signing this petition is not hard, but to make sure your
signature is not lost or miscounted, please follow these
directions EXACTLY:

1) Prepare an e-mail message.  In the main body (NOT the
Subject line) of your e-mail include the ONE-LINE statement:

SIGNED <Internet e-mail address> <Full name> <US Citizen>

You need not include the "<" and ">" characters. \'SIGNED\'
should be capitalized.  As stated above, your full name is
optional, but highly recommended.  If you do supply your
name, please don\'t use a pseudonym or nickname, or your
first name -- it\'s better to just leave it blank if it\'s
not your full and real name.  If you are a U.S. citizen,
please include at the end of the signature line a \'YES\',
and if you are not, a \'NO\'.  All signatures will be
tallied whether or not you are a U.S. Citizen

CDT POLICY POST 2/9/95

SENATOR EXON INTRODUCES ONLINE INDECENCY LEGISLATION

A.  OVERVIEW

Senators Exon (D-NE) and Senator Gorton (R-WA) have
introduced legislation to expand current FCC regulations
on obscene and indecent audiotext to cover *all* content
carried over all forms of electronic communications
networks.  If enacted, the "Communications Decency Act of
1995" (S. 314) would place substantial criminal liability
on telecommunications service providers (including
telephone networks, commercial online services, the
Internet, and independent BBS\'s) if their network is used
in the transmission of any indecent, lewd, threatening or
harassing messages.  The legislation is identical to a
proposal offered by Senator Exon last year which failed
along with the Senate Telecommunications reform bill (S.
1822, 103rd Congress, Sections 801 - 804). The text the
proposed statute, with proposed amendment, is appended at
the end of this document.

The bill would compel service providers to chose between
severely restricting the activities of their subscribers
or completely shutting down their email, Internet access,
and conferencing services under the threat of criminal
liability.  Moreover, service providers would be forced to
closely monitor every private communication, electronic
mail message, public forum, mailing list, and file archive
carried by or available on their network, a proposition
which poses a substantial threat to the freedom of speech
and privacy rights of all American citizens.

S. 314, if enacted, would represent a tremendous step
backwards on the path to a free and open National
Information Infrastructure.  The bill raises fundamental
questions about the ability of government to control
content on communications networks, as well as the locus
of liability for content carried in these new
communications media.

To address this threat to the First Amendment in digital
media, CDT is working to organize a broad coalition of
public interest organizations including the ACLU, People
For the American Way, and Media Access Project, along with
representatives from the telecommunications, online
services, and computer industries to oppose S. 314 and to
explore alternative policy solutions that preserve the
free flow of information and freedom of speech in the
online world.  CDT believes that technological
alternatives which allow individual subscribers to control
the content they receive represent a more appropriate
approach to this issue.

B.  SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS OF S. 314

S. 314 would expand current law restricting indecency and
harassment on telephone services to all telecommunications
providers and expand criminal liability to *all* content
carried by *all* forms of telecommunications networks.
The bill would amend Section 223 of the Communications Act
(47 U.S.C. 223), which requires carriers to take steps to
prevent minors from gaining access to indecent audiotext
and criminalizes harassment accomplished over interstate
telephone lines.  This section, commonly known as the
Helms Amendment (having been championed by Senator Jesse
Helms), has been the subject of extended Constitutional
litigation in recent years.

* CARRIERS LIABLE FOR CONDUCT OF ALL USERS ON THEIR
  NETWORKS

S. 314 would make telecommunication carriers (including
telephone companies, commercial online services, the
Internet, and BBS\'s) liable for every message, file, or
other content carried on its network -- including the
private conversations or messages exchanged between two
consenting individuals.

Under S. 314, anyone who "makes, transmits, or otherwise
makes available any comment, request, suggestion,
proposal, image, or other communication" which is
"obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent" using a
"telecommunications device" would be subject to a fine of
$100,000 or two years in prison (Section (2)(a)).

In order to avoid liability under this provision, carriers
would be forced to pre-screen all messages, files, or
other content before transmitting it to the intended
recipient.  Carriers would also be forced to prevent or
severely restrict their subscribers from communicating
with individuals and accessing content available on other
networks.

Electronic communications networks do not contain discrete
boundaries.  Instead, users of one service can easily
communicate with and access content available on other
networks.  Placing the onus, and criminal liability, on
the carrier as opposed to the originator of the content,
would make the carrier legally responsible not only for
the conduct of its own subscribers, but also for content
generated by subscribers of other services.

This regulatory scheme clearly poses serious threats to
the free flow of information throughout the online world
and the free speech and privacy rights of individual
users.  Forcing carriers to pre-screen content would not
only be impossible due to the sheer volume of messages, it
would also violate current legal protections.

* CARRIERS REQUIRED TO ACT AS PRIVATE CENSOR OF ALL
  PUBLIC FORUMS AND ARCHIVES

S. 314 would also expand current restrictions on access to
indecent telephone audiotext services by minors under the
age of 18 to cover similar content carried by
telecommunications services (such as America Online and
the Internet).  (Sec (a)(4)).

As amended by this provision, anyone who, "by means of
telephone or telecommunications device, makes, transmits,
or otherwise makes available (directly or by recording
device) any indecent communication for commercial purposes
which is available to any person under the age of 18 years
of age or to any other person without that person\'s
consent, regardless of whether the maker of such
communication placed the call or initiated the
communication" would be subject of a fine of $100,000 or
two years in prison.

This would force carries to act as private censors of all
content available in public forums or file archives on
their networks.  Moreover, because there is no clear
definition of indecency, carriers would have to restrict
access to any content that could be possibly construed as
indecent or obscene under the broadest interpretation of
the term. Public forums, discussion lists, file archives,
and content available for commercial purposes would have
to be meticulously screened and censored in order to avoid
potential liability for the carrier.

Such a scenario would severely limit the diversity of
content available on online networks, and limit the
editorial freedom of independent forum operators.

ADDITIONAL NOTABLE PROVISIONS

* AMENDMENT TO ECPA

Section (6) of the bill would amend the Electronic
Communications Privacy Act (18 USC 2511) to prevent the
unauthorized interception and disclosure of "digital
communications" (Sec. 6).  However, because the term
"digital communication" is not defined and 18 USC 2511
currently prevents unauthorized interception and
disclosure of "electronic communications" (which includes
electronic mail and other forms of communications in
digital form), the effect of this provision has no clear
importance.

* CABLE OPERATORS MAY REFUSE INDECENT PUBLIC ACCESS
  PROGRAMMING

Finally, section (8) would amend sections 611 and 612 of
the Communications Act (47 USC 611 - 612) to allow any
cable operator to refuse to carry any public access or
leased access programming which contains "obscenity,
indecency, or nudity".

C.  ALTERNATIVES TO EXON: RECOGNIZE THE UNIQUE USER
    CONTROL CAPABILITIES OF INTERACTIVE MEDIA

Government regulation of content in the mass media has
always been considered essential to protect children from
access to sexually-explicit material, and to prevent
unwitting listeners/views from being exposed to material
that might be considered extremely distasteful.  The
choice to protect children has historically been made at
the expense of the First Amendment ban on government
censorship.  As Congress moves to regulate new interactive
media, it is essential that it understand that interactive
media is different than mass media.  The power and
flexibility of interactive media offers a unique
opportunity to enable parents to control what content
their kids have access to, and leave the flow of
information free for those adults who want it.  Government
control regulation is simply not needed to achieve the
desired purpose.

Most interactive technology, such as Internet browsers and
the software used to access online services such as
America Online and Compuserve, already has the capability
to limit access to certain types of services and selected
information.  Moreover, the electronic program guides
being developed for interactive cable TV networks also
provide users the capability to screen out certain
channels or ever certain types of programming.  Moreover,
in the online world, most content (with the exception of
private communications initiated by consenting
individuals) is transmitted by request.  In other words,
users must seek out the content they receive, whether it
is by joining a discussion or accessing a file archive.
By its nature, this technology provides ample control at
the user level.  Carriers (such as commercial online
services, Internet service providers) in most cases act
only as "carriers" of electronic transmissions initiated
by individual subscribers.

CDT believes that the First Amendment will be better
served by giving parents and other users the tools to
select which information they (and their children) should
have access to.  In the case of criminal content the
originator of the content, not the carriers, should be
responsible for their crimes.  And, users (especially
parents) should be empowered to determine what information
they and their children have access to.  If all carriers
of electronic communications are forced restrict content
in order to avoid criminal liability proposed by S. 314,
the First Amendment would be threatened and the usefulness
of digital media for communications and information
dissemination would be drastically limited.

D.  NEXT STEPS

The bill has been introduced and will next move to the
Senate Commerce Committee, although no Committee action
has been scheduled.  Last year, a similar proposal by
Senator Exon was approved by the Senate Commerce committee
as an amendment to the Senate Telecommunications Bill (S.
1822, which died at the end of the 103rd Congress).  CDT
will be working with a wide range of other interest groups
to assure that Congress does not restrict the free flow of
information in interactive media.

MUSH == Multi-User Shared Hallucination
MOO == MUD, Object-Oriented

Members of a family of online interactive games which includes MUDs,
MUCKs, and many more-or-less related things.  Basically, a way of doing
real-time roleplaying in an online, interactive and user-extensible
setting.  The experience can be _very_ good (equal or better than
\'classic\' tabletop roleplaying) under the right conditions.  In any event
they can absorb a frankly unbelievable amount of your free time.

MUD == Multi-User Dungeon
MUCK == Multi-User Carnal Knowledge     ;-) 

They\'re online, multi-user interactive role-playing environments.  If you\'ve
never played one, they\'re hard to describe, but vaguely similar in concept 
to the old Zork or adventure games, but with multiple players (who can
interact with each other and with the game) online at once.  Certain players
can extend the game database and/or programming logic, as well.

There are a large number of such games based on White Wolf\'s Storyteller
game; as I understand it, each player in these games maintains a character
sheet for their character, and uses this in conjunction with the programming
of the game.  Other games exist which revolve around science-fiction and
fantasy themes, ranging from Star Trek through Albedo-esque \'critters\' (the
[in?]famous FurryMUCK) to classic swords and sorcery.

A Traveller MUSH or MOO (or even MUD or MUCK) would require GDW\'s
permission (Traveller is a trademark, and you also would require their
permission to use portions of their copyrighted background material and game
rules).  At least in _theory_, such a game could be successful in generating
additional interest in Traveller for GDW (particularly if the online game is
written in such a way that a copy of the Traveller rules is very useful to
players).  Considering the sheer number of Storyteller-based online games,
White Wolf must be seeing some benefit from this form of marketing.

Without proper permission from GDW, such a game is flatly impossible, and
should not be attempted.  Even with permission, a considerable amout of
Traveller-specific set-up and programming would have to be done, in order
to support things like space travel, interstellar travel, and other game
aspects specific to Traveller.  This would be a good deal of work for a
talented database builder or programmer.

pmm118@email.psu.edu posted some of his ideas for the TAS as it exists in
the New Era; Alvin Plummer responded by reminding everyone of the TAS as
it was during the Classic period (and maybe still is, in the Regency).

Alvin, I think the part that you missed was "mentioned in the TNE rule-
book."  The TAS of old, like so many other Third Imperial institutions,
ceased to be during the chaos of Rebellion and Collapse.  Some fragments
survive in 1200, and in many pocket empires new organizations with
the same purpose (though nowhere near the resources) have started using
the name. 

Until the day comes when people regularly travel across sectors again,
the size and benefits of anything calling itself the TAS will probably
be limited to the sort described in Fireplug\'s posting.

Just another reminder: this isn\'t the Traveller you remember.

MUSH and MOO are both (somewhat contrived) acronyms, derived by example
  from MUD (Multi-User Dungeon).  MUDs in general are server programs
  that people connect to, using clients or plain Telnet; they resemble
  the old text-only adventure games, in which the players move around 
  in a virtual environment of rooms, objects, and sometimes monsters.

The MUD concept has gone in two directions.  One has refined the \'game\'
  programming; these are almost all based on the same \'kill-the-monster-
  get-the-treasure-go-up-levels\' D&D model, while the technical side
  becomes more and more sophisticated.  This type is referred to as
  "combat MUDs" or just "MUDs", as they tend to be literally multi-user
  dungeons.  The other type has turned away from the competitive 
  aspect, using the virtual environment for socializing and/or role-
  playing.  MUSHes and MOOs are currently the two most popular server
  programs of this type.

MOOs tend to be more social these days, while MUSH is the platform 
  used for roleplaying worlds.  In the early days of MUSH, games based
  on the Pern series by Anne MacCaffery (and run with her permission)
  were the dominant type; now the balance has shifted to the World of
  Darkness setting of White Wolf\'s supernatural games.  (Something
  about a dark, brooding, tragic, misunderstood character that can
  rip out the throat of anyone he doesn\'t like seems to appeal to 
  today\'s teenaged gamers.)  There are also several BattleTech MUSHes
  with code for mech combat, a ShadowRun MUSH, assorted Star Trek
  games set in various periods, and so on.  Some MUSHes have a more
  general theme without being based on any one fictional universe.

For more information, check out the newsgroups in the rec.games.mud.*
  section:  .announce, .misc, .tiny (most relevant to MUSH/MOO and
  the \'social\' type), and .lp or .diku (flavors of combat MUD).  The
  FAQ is posted frequently there.

   You are referring to the Second Solomani Rim War, I take it.  The
Solomani had a tough time due to several factors:

1)  Dissention within their armed forces.  Remember, the bulk of the
personnel in Solomani Navy comes  its member-states.  From the Central
Command level on down, there were disagreements about war aims.
After the fall of Terra in 1117, many Confederation commanders 
believed that the war should be ended (Terra had been the ultimate
objective after all).  Stiffer than expected Imperial resistance on all
fronts added additional commanders to the list of those who wanted an
immediate seize-fire.  By 1125, the Solomani were forced into serious
seize-fire negotiations (probably whole fleets were refusing orders to go
on the offensive by then).  It is also entirely possible that some
personnel were abandoning  their starships, or conducted mutinies in
an effort to return home (contemporary Solomani accounts about
this would have undoubtedly been suppressed by SolSec).

2)  Lack of support for the war on the homefront.  After the initial easy
victories, large casualties lists started to filter back from the front.
Everyone had expected a short war (don\'t they always) and when
that didn\'t happen, support for the war plummeted.  By 1125, there was
a large anti-war movement, this despite SolSec attempts to squelch it.

3)  Untimely defeats.  Had the Solomani won the Battle of Dingir in 1117,
they continue to advance on the Vegan homeworld, and given the
confused state of the Imperial forces, would have likely captured
Muan Gwi, Depot, and ended Imperial resistance in the Rim.  They
entered Dingir system overconfident, and ran into an Imperial force
that whose motivation basically amounted to desperation.  The defeat
the Solomani suffered at Dingir permanently stalled their
offensive into the Rim\'s heart--and ultimately caused a major
redeployment of forces, as the Solomani attempted to flank the Imperial
position.  Later defeats in Daibei and the Old Expanses (at the hands of
Margaret and her allies) had a similar effect--and left the Solomani
in the unenviable position of fighting what amounted a two front war
on exterior lines.

   I hope that explains things better.  Everyone is free to comment
should they so desire.

Firstly, the war took them by surprise - rather that having a year or more
to prepare, suddenly *wham!* the opportunity is there, and either they take
it or lose the chance. Secondly, they had to integrate the captured worlds
into the Confederation, and/or passify/garrisson them, which takes time.
Thirdly, they didn\'t want to extend the supply lines/communication times
too far. The 2nd Imperium shows the problem of grabbing too much, too
quickly.

I always considered them to have a pretty good military.

T*THREE HOURS?* How much space are you devoting to purifiers?! I\'d say 6-12

One of the ways Israel was "persuaded" not to get involved in the Gulf War
was by the Coalition refusing to give them the correct IFF codes, therefore
their planes would have been marked as hostile.

Depends on your deployment strategy. If the fleet is always going to be
used as a single force, then it\'s reasonable to have dedicated tankers and
no purification gear on the warships; there should be enough escorts to
protect them from enemy attack.

 [Sorry...I could\'t resist a pair of straight lines like
 those...: ) ]
 
 _ The Death of Wisdom_ is the first ever Traveller novel by
 GDW Press, first of a series of three by author Paul Brunette.
 
 The novel is set in the Reformation Coalition and involves the
 attempt to stop a plague that is killing the Hivers, the alien
 race which has been providing technological support for the human
 recovery.
 
 The heroes are the crew of the Reformation Coalition starship
 Hornet, which is led by Coeur "Red Sun" d\'Esprit, a survivor of
 the collapsed Imperium, who survived for 70 years in suspended
 animation.
 
 The crew stumble across the early stages of the plague and
 attempt to trace it back to its source, and find that it involves
 a conspiracy from within the Coalition that is linked to the
 Mercantile Guild, a sort of interstellar Mafia which seeks to
 prevent any interstellar governments from rising again. The
 pursuit of this mystery takes them across a subsector to find the
 source of the plague at a Guild base, which they destroy.
 
 Coeur d\'Esprit, as a former Imperial citizen, provides some
 perspective on the difference between the old self-destructing
 Imperial society and the society of the New Era to which she is
 committed. The crew also includes a Schalli navigator, "Deep
 Six," and a courageous Hiver technical advisor, "Scissor."
 
 This novel is very closely tied to the Path of Tears
 sourcebook, and displays a great deal of equipment that is
 detailed and illustrated in the Reformation Coalition Equipment
 Guide. In addition to the two follow-on novels, this trilogy will
 be supported by articles in upcoming issues of Challenge which
 present the characters as fully detailed TNE characters.

You rang?  :)

Some things that are known about the Travellers\' Aid Society:

The Travellers\' Aid Society is a private organization that maintains
facilities and hostels at all class A and B starports in the Imperium,
which means about 3600 to 3800 systems have at least one TAS hostel,
judging by world generation.  (About 40% of all Imperial worlds.)
The TAS is as big as the megacorporations; its\' worth is probably
measured in quadrillions of credits.

Lifetime, non-transferable membership in the TAS costs MCr 1.  The 
TAS then invests this money to operate the organization.  In some
cases, memberships are sponsored by the Navy, Marines, or Ministry of
State (Diplomats).  Belters and Nobles (TNE "Wealthy Traveler") also
often obtain memberships.  Occasionally the TAS awards a membership.
If you are applying as an individual, a "blackball" must be avoided
which culled 3% or so of the applicants in CT/MT (maybe 10x worse
in TNE).  Many ordinary citizens are members.

Services:

The High Passage ticket every eight weeks would require the Society to
make 6.5% interest annually on the membership fee.  Of course, as old
members die, their fees can go to the endowment, so the Society gets
richer and is able to do more things....  

Members have access to the Society\'s hostels, and can invite guests.
They get reduced rates on first-class lodging and meals from the TAS
for all.  (TAS gets some income here, but probably have to cover part
of the cost with other income streams.)

   "Traveller News Service is another Imperium-wide benefit 
    of membership in the Travellers\' Aid Society." 
	                                     -- TNS blurb, JTAS.  
The Society owns and operates the largest independent news service in 
the Imperium, with news offices and correspondents virtually *everywhere*.  
While it\'s public, I get the impression that they operate like the 
Associated Press, letting the local news service pick up their stories 
off the wire.  Members get full, free access to read the news wire at 
any Society hostel.

Travellers\' Aid does have an agenda.  It wants to encourage safe 
interstellar tourism.  It discourages low passage travel.  It also
operates the travel zone service to warn members and the public 
about potential hazards on the planets of the Imperium.  It has
declared worlds red zones before the Imperial government has been 
able to place the Interdict in order to protect members.  This sort
of Red Zone is a strong advisory.  Actually, similar services exist
today, in the real world.  Usually, such an advisory would be
accompanied by text explaining why.

We got a lot more information from the TAS ad in MTJ #1 and the 
interview with Jeramii Boden (TAS spokesbeing from 1105-1120s) in 
MTJ #3.  TAS was founded some time in the early 700s (before 720).
So at about the same time as the Solomani Autonomous Region.

We also learned that it provides these additional benefits for members:
  * reasonable prices on local planetary tours
  * free legal counsel at all TAS hostels
  * full medical coverage and insurance on baggage

MTJ #3 revealed that the Society helps sponsor holoshows and travellogues, 
something like National Geographic.  It has a "TAS Junior Explorers Club" 
open to kids, even non-member kids as an educational tool, to recruit 
potential new members, and promote the Society\'s point of view and agenda.
Travellers\' holds special lectures, sometimes impromptu, open only to
members and their guests, at the hostels.

An article in JTAS #24 on the ISCC (Imperial Standard Credit Card) adds
that for a "modest" Cr 10000 lifetime fee, the Travellers\' Aid Society
will issue a "TAS Services Card".  To put it simply, it\'s a "portable
bank account" that is encoded with the holder\'s DNA and also serves as a
proof of identification and a guarantee of unlimited reliability of 
credit.  If lost, the balance would need to be verified, but since these
cards would get used frequently at TAS hostels, and members travel at
a leisurely pace, it might not be so bad getting the correct balance and
issuing a new card. (Trying to lose a card with a big debt on it won\'t
work, because TAS gets a report of the transactions eventually from the
other end.  Assume some complex tracking going on here to keep all this
straight, they\'ve got the experience and I don\'t.)
  
Any other neat convenient service that the members might like would be
appropriate to add for a campaign.  For instance, I let players of 
members send very brief xmail messages to the hostels in the subsector
for a nominal charge (or free) since TNS needs to maintain fast, maybe
jump-4 courier service to the xboat net all the time anyway, and those
ships may have extra room available for more data.  Some limits were
made and adjusted from time to time.  And of course the hostel post
office could also handle first-class physical interstellar mail, which
would be about Cr 0.25 or Cr 0.5 per 25 grams or fraction per jump,
judging by interstellar mail shipping costs and adding in some cover
for planetary delivery; that\'s a typical mass for a letter.  I felt
free to have local Postal Unions send most mail on jump-1 "Fat Traders"
though, which slows the mail and increases postage.

In my opinion, the TAS membership should be something that the average
PC just *lusts* after. :)  Even one party member with a membership can
make life interesting.  All sorts of fun adventures can be spun off 
starting at the Travellers\' Aid Society complex....

Thankyou Hugh, I\'m glad to see that someone has finally spotted the 
difference.  MT was simply an inclusion of all the Traveller books, with 
extrapolation and some new bits (not many in total, quite a few in pages), 
most of the latter appear as if they were done in isolation to the rest of 
the universe as stated or created - hence the loopholes/conflicts (High 
Guard damage tables and Damage Points for weapons and ships!!!).

TNE is a totally new game, built from the ground up using T2000 (not 
Arnie), and Dark Conspiracy (all TM/c GDW).  Hence it is a distinct 
possibility that those who enjoyed CT and/or MT will not enjoy TNE.  If 
however you enjoyed T2000 2nd _AND_ CT/MT then you would very possibly 
love TNE!!  However I\'m one of the former.  I enjoyed CT and to a lesser 
degree MT, but not Tw2000 etc.  Hence I\'m disappointed to say that I 
think GDW and I have gone our separate ways to a significant degree.

Shame really, considering Frank Chadwick\'s excellent games such as the 
Third WW series (if somewhat fictional now in setting and scope) and 
Marc\'s superb vision of the future of science fiction RP genre by 
creating Traveller (TM/c GDW) along with all of those who had input.

I would like to take this opportunity to go on record to say a BIG (HUGE, 
Tigress sized) _THANKS_ to all those involved in the creation and 
development of the first edition of Traveller.

Thanks guys for giving me the best 12 years of my life and yet more to 
come (over 50% of my life has been dedicated to reffing Traveller - CT/MT).

Just my bit guys.

   The Solomani had war plans for invading the Imperium, just as every
General Staff and Joint Chiefs of Staff on 20th century Earth has some
of their people working on contingency plans for invading their 
neighbors (I\'d be very interested in seeing Canada\'s plans for invading
the U.S.--and under what conditions they would be implemented).
Whether any of the admirals and generals in the Solomani armed forces
took these plans seriously would be a point of debate.  I would argue
that most didn\'t--if anything they were worried that the Imperium might
finish the job they started a century before (the First Solomani Rim War).

   The war of 1117 represented their best hope for retaking Terra (and
possibly securing the other worlds they lost) in their lifetimes.  What
ever the outcome of the civil war in the Imperium, the new emperor
was probably not going to be in any shape in launch an offensive
to retake territory seized by the Solomani (first order of business
at any rate would have probably been to drive back the Vargr--a job that
would have tied the Imperium up for several years).  At any rate,
the Solomani were in a much better position to win than they were in the
first war.

   The Solomani war plan probably talked to the "fact" that local
populations would welcome the them with open arms.  While this may
have happened in some locations (particularly in the Old Expanses),
many worlds the Solomani didn\'t expect to fight their "liberation" did.  This
undoubtedly threw the time tables off in their plans and was a
major factor in their getting bogged down (add this factor to the list of
three I posted yesterday).

   Logistically speaking, the Solomani had less of a bad time of it thanks
to the integration of their navy.  Their Army, however, wasn\'t particularly
well integrated (I\'m not even sure they standardized the calibre of
their weapons, although I would hope they did).  This lack of
integration was probably a deciding factor in more than one crucial
planetary invasion.  Certainly it figured prominently in the initial Lagash
campaign of 1118-19.

   Even a 6-12 hour purifier may take up too much space unless you
are talking about a dedicated tanker.  As currently designed, fuel
purification plants are volume hogs.  The current design system places
greater emphasis on tankers and starports for quick refueling.

   The problem with this strategy is that the tanker escorts have to
be used as just that--tanker escorts.  They could never be "pulled"
from that duty for other activities.  All tactical deployments would have
to be centered on defending the tankers.  What happens if you are
forced to withdraw under pressure and are low on fuel? Are you
going to lead the enemy back to your only way of getting home?  I don\'t
think so.  Having a minimal refining capability would allow you to go
hide out in a gas giant for a while and wait for things to cool down.
Later you can sneak back to the tanker, top off your tanks, and get the
hell out of there.

   I\'m not convinced that he\'s taking about a valid design.  I\'d like to
see the stats for one of these "interstellar tanks" posted, in particular
the hull design calculations.  After all, under the old system it was
possible to design 15,000 ton jump-6, maneuver-6 starship
with a spinal mount meson gun if certain rules were ignored.

>TNE IS  NOT TRAVELLER!

   TNE is Traveller, just as much as MegaTraveller was Traveller, and
"classic" Traveller was Traveller.  Attitudes like that are best
expressed in the alternative to this mailing list.

1. They didn\'t lose the Solomani Rim War... they lost Terra, which would
have been like the Union losing Washington D.C. in the Civil War -- a 
devastating blow to morale to lose the Capital, but doesn\'t imply a very
deep penetration of the borders...  As it was, the Solomani fleets broke
the back of the Imperial Navy; that\'s why they STOPPED at Terra.

2. A closer examination of the Solomani Confederation reveals that it
has all the unity of the U.S. under the 1781 Articles of Confederation; it
is almost fatally divisive.  The supposedly monolithic nature of the
Confederation under the unifying control of the Solomani Party zampolits
is almost certainly a fiction; an artifact of Imperial propaganda or Party
propaganda, or both.  Solomani Navy command probably thank heaven
when they *don\'t* have internavy squabbling similiar to that which crippled
human efforts in the 2300AD setting -- where the Earth nations were so
busy squabbling about who got the prestige of beating the Kafers that 
they almost gave the whole thing to the Kafers.  (Which, btw, seems to
be modeled on Anglo/American/Free French/Soviet squabbling during
WWII... )  Using the example of WWII, all the Solomani need to throw
a monkey wrench into the works is a Montgomery, someone who is 
allowed to run operations beyond his ability for reasons of national 
prestige and amity among allies.  Anyone remember Market Garden? 
(aka "A Bridge Too Far").

I have some questions about TNE:

1) Challenge 76 had an errata list to beef up the energy weapons. Is 
there a central repository of errata sheets for TNE products? I think I 
have three different ones for TNE and I want to get them right.

2) I know this has probably been asked before (and might be on an errata 
sheet somewhere) but what is the correct calculation for figuring out 
the size of a satellite of a planet? I dont have the book in front of 
me, but I think it says (World Size - d6). This is a hold over from 
World Builder\'s Handbook. I don\'t think a Size 9 planet can have a size 
8 moon and be stable. In the past I have used the formula
 (World Size/2) - (d6) + 1  (round down any fractions). 
This allows for worlds to have satellites no bigger than half of their 
size.

3) Has Aslan society collapsed as well as the Imperium? What about the 
K\'kree?  Have the K\'kree disappeared from the official universe?

Thanks

  Ditto.

  Sounds reasonable to me.  I\'ve been wondering the same thing, after
generating
a size 6 planet with a size 5 moon.  There should be a slim chance for this
kind
of thing, and shared orbits and trojans too, but that\'s what GM fiat is for. 
The tables should normally prevent this kind of thing, IMO.

  Aslan are perfectly fine, AFAIK.  The only part of the Hierate left is that
next to the Spinward States.  Seems the rest were hit by Virus as hard as the
Imperium else (what a surprise, with as cautious and forethinking as the
Aslan
are... |-)  Of course, that could change, if they got some assistance.  A
more-
or-less restored Hierate would give the Regency a hard time.

  K\'Kree seem to have been all but phased out of TNE.  I\'m not terribly
pleased
by this; I like the K\'Kree (as a referee, anyway).

  This information may be completely and utterly wrong, as I\'ve only had TNE
a
little while (*) and I only have the main rules so far (any purchase
recommend-
ations, anyone?  I know I want FF&S, BR, and Striker II, but I\'ve no clue
which
sourcebooks are any good...)

 -Mark Hughes
 * I thought I\'d probably be returning it immediately - instead I\'m very
   impressed by most of it.  It\'s much more true to the spirit of early CT
than
   the later "two-thousand-rulebooks" games or MegaErrata.

 Due to moving around I just received a letter from Planet 3 Software about
 a new release for their Traveller Navigator.  I don\'t remember seeing
 anything about it in the list so here it is.

 ===========================================================================

 Planet 3 Software is pleased to announce the release of a new sector for
 Traveller Navigator.  The OLD EXPANSES SECTOR has been finalized and 
 approved by GDW.  Now, Planet 3 makes this information available to you.

 Furthermore, Traveller Navigator - Diaspora Sector has been enhanced from
 version 1.2 to 1.5.  What\'s new: every single starship and small craft 
 ever published by GDW for use with T:TNE is fully detailed.  That\'s 39
 starships and 11 small craft and all 19 clipper modules for use with the
 Aurora and Maggart class clipper ships, used by the Reformation Coalition.

 The star maps now print in color, if you have a color printer.  The 
 glossary section has been enhanced, covering many new topics.  Also
 included, is the Travel Computer.  A program that quickly and easily
 calculates the travel time and fuel consumption of a spacecraft when
 travelling between planets in a solar system, or when moving to and from
 jump points.  Dozens of calculations that can take upwards of 15 minutes
 are now performed in a split second.

 The prices are: 
    Diaspora Sector upgrade   $15.00
    Old Expanses Sector       $24.95
    Both of the above         $34.95
    Shipping and Handling     $ 2.50
    CA residents tax            8.25%

    Planet III Software
    999-C Edgewater Blvd.
    #361
    Foster City, CA   94404
    Ph:(408) 366-1033

 ===========================================================================

 The letter says that the upgrade offer expires 4/15/95.

 I am not affiliated with P3S in any way so if you don\'t like their stuff
 don\'t yell at me.  I do use the Traveller Navigator where I can (on friends 
  machines) since it\'s for Windows and I have a Mac.

    'body' => 'More thoughts on the \'Second Rim War\':

There have been some great points made in the discussions
so far - points which I\'m going to have to take into
consideration in my own post-Collapse campaign in the 
Rim.

I\'ll add a couple thoughts of my own...feel free to turn
the flamethrower on to them if you disagree:

1/  If the Solomani in the 57th Century are anything 
    like their ancestors in the 20th, it\'s going to 
    be hard to get the entire Confederation to agree
    on what year it is, let alone the conduct of 
    offensive operations against the Imperium.

    As the war dragged on, dragging the Confederation\'s
    economy down with it, there would have an increasing 
    trend for the component systems to go their 
    seperate ways...even start fighting each other.
    In my campaign, by about 1128, an increasing amount
    of force was required to stop the Confederation from
    falling apart in much the same way that the former
    Soviet and Yugoslav states have.  By the time of 
    the Collapse, the Confederation was falling apart
    at the seams, and it\'s Navy was not equal to the 
    task of keeping things together AND holding the 
    coreward border.

2/  I like the point made that the idea of a monolithic
    Solomani state was a myth perpetuated by both sides
    (for their own reasons).  The reality was probably
    more like Germany before Bismark:  a rather loose 
    confederation of a large number of small states, 
    with some vague higher ideal of \'Solomani supremacy\'
    holding them together, but at each other\'s throats
    most of the time.  I wonder if the Confederation
    would have ever found it\'s \'Bismark\'?

3/  The GDW material I\'ve read hints at a growing 
    r\'approachment between the Confederation and the 
    Imperium from the last half of the 11th Century.
    It would have been interesting to see what would
    have happened if Strephon wasn\'t assassinated 
    and Dulinor\'s planned \'democratic reforms\' went
    ahead.  The Solomani tend (?) to be a fairly 
    egalitarian lot, with a disliking of nobility and 
    heriditary rank.
    
    Of course, Strephon\'s assassination changed all of 
    that...

Concluding - no, I don\'t think that the Solomani were
incompetent, they just can\'t seem to get along with
each other, let alone the rest of the universe.  I\'d 
say that any state forged by the Solomani would last 
about as long as the Rule of Man before disintegrating.
Mind you, it\'s that competitiveness and belligerence
that enabled them to beat the Vilani senseless a few 
thousand years before.

"Australia\'s attempt to win it\'s first Test series against the 
West Indies in almost 3900 years was foiled yesterday by the 
sudden appearance of Solomani Marine Corps units on the Melbourne
Cricket Ground.  Play has been abandoned, and the West Indies 
have escaped with a 1-all draw in the series."

In the ACR design example in FF&S (January 1994 Edition, p.154) 
there are a few things I don\'t understand:

Ammunition: in p.92, it is stated that the cartridge case must be
at least 35mm long to be necked. Still, the necked cartridge
case in the example is only 30mm.

Barrel: the barrel is light, so barrel price multiplier should be
200 (p.94). In the example, 400 is used.

Recoil: the auto/semiauto recoil multiplier of 0.95 (p.98) does 
not seem to be included in the calculations, even though the ACR
is an automatic weapon.

Does someone have explanations for these things ? 

Furthermore, I have been trying to reverse engineer some of the 
weapons in Reformation Coalition Equipment Guide, with poor results. 
Most of them seem to be heavier and more expensive than necessary.
Am I misinterpreting the FF&S rules, or is there something wrong 
with the designs ?

Notes:  The ALAR-20 (Advanced Linear Accelerator Rifle) is the standard
rifle of the Commonwealth Marines, and is the de-facto standard (pending
formal confirmation) rifle for member world ground forces.  The design is
based on the standard Solomani Confederation 6x30Gauss Rifle, although
technological limits forced a redesign of most components.  The weapon uses
the standard Solomani Confederation 6x30mm Gauss round, a standard which has
also been adopted by the Commonwealth.

The design is a bullpup configuration automatic rifle, and is able to fire
single shot,  5 or 10 shot bursts via the fire selector.  Optical and laser
sights are fitted as standard, as is a bayonet lug and grenade adaptor for
standard 25mm rifle grenades.

The ALAR-20 was designed by Gestner-Matsui Systems on Saxe, and is now
manufactured under license by arms companies on Saxe, Aquitaine, Hamilcar
and Teucer.  

Note that, although this rifle will shortly be adopted as standard by
Commonwealth ground forces, it\'s use is by no means widespread.  Many line
and reserve units still use other weaponry, mainly an assortment of chemical
and ETC rifles.

A squad support weapon, based on the ALAR-20, is being tested by
Gestner-Matsui.  The ALSW-20 is expected to enter service with the
Commonwealth Marines in early 1202.  Another variant, the ALZR-20, is being
prototyped.  The ALZR-20 will be a low-velocity gauss rifle suited for
zero-G and vacuum work (it will incorporate a much shorter barrel and
vacuum-hardening).

The other 20-odd occupations will appear if there is sufficient demand. Note
that the system is similar to that for the standard Human generation system

entire contents of the TNE handbook (which would pose copyright problems). I
haven\'t had much time to use these rules so any feedback would be
appreciated. Perhaps GDW would like to use this to save themselves the time
of writing their own Aslan TNE book? :-)

All trademarks and copyrights used within this document are hereby
acknowledged. This document in no way seeks to challenge the aforesaid
trademarks and copyrights. Blah blah blah legalese waffle, etc.

* Note
TNEx indicates page x of the Traveller: The New Era rulebook.

* Background
The Aslan Hierate spinward of the Great Rift has maintained its
strength and largely avoided the effects of the Virus. This was
possible due to the isolation provided by the Rift and the
advance warning given by the Domain of Deneb. In the Hierate
trailward of the Great Rift the Virus spread, albeit more slowly
than through Imperial space. Here significant disruption was
caused but each group of Aslan clan worlds tended to be more
self-sufficient and the overall damage was significantly less
than in the Imperium. These worlds are refered to as the \'Clan
Worlds\' and are regarded as slightly inferior by the surviving
Hierate worlds. It is presumed that this refers to the Clan
Worlds\' lesser ability to cope with the Virus and their
independece from the Hierate who now exert little influence in
that region. Aslan outside the Hierate are still regarded as
Outcasts, as per pre-Virus times.

* Homeworld
Determine using TNE17-18, using the following translations to get
the regional DMs:
Hierate -> Regency; Clan Worlds -> Pocket Empire; Outcasts -> use
the Imperial region within which they are located (e.g. Wilds).

* Attributes
As per TNE19 except that Strength and Constitution are rolled as
2D+1 and Dexterity as 2D-2 (count 0 as 1). Charisma and Social
Standing are with respect to other Aslan rather than aliens.
Homeworld effects on attributes are as per TNE19, with a final
possible attribute range of 1 to 15.

* Social Standing
Social Standing of B or C indicates leadership of a family group
or small clan; level D is a planetary clan; E indicates
leadership of multiple-star systems; F is a Hierate
representative. Clan worlders may not exceed E; outcasts may
occasionally reach C.

* Naming Characters
Outcasts and Aslan used to dealing with non-Aslan tend to assume
anglic names for ease of use, either a literal translation of
their Aslan name (e.g. "Teller of Winding Tales") or a shortened
version of it (e.g. Iroioah -> Iro) or a convenient anglic name
(e.g. "Long claw" or "Growler").

* Background Skills
By the age of 16, an Aslan will have picked up level 2 skill in
3 of the skills on TNE23. The following are NOT available:
Act/Bluff, Archery, Disguise, Slug Weapon, Streetwise. The
following are ADDITIONAL possibilities: Dance, High-G
Environment, Racial (new skill - see below). All the skills are
limited by homeworld as per TNE23.

* Default Skills
As per TNE24. Superior eyesight (particularly at night) and sense
of smell gives all Aslan an automatic skill of Observation 1.

* CAREERS
As per TNE24-28 except that Aslan terms are 8 ftahea (about 7
human years) in length. In addition, at age 16 ftahea (approx 14
years), all Aslan undergo:

* Rites of Passage (ROP; Akuaeuhrekhyeh)
A male Aslan rolls 2d6. His ROP is equal to the number of
characteristics greater than or equal to the roll. For female
Aslan the 2d6 roll is compared to Intelligence, Education,
Charisma and Social Standing; the ROP is twice the number of
these attributes equal to or exceeding the roll. The character
can opt to use 1 or 2 ROP points per term; these can be added to
any of the commission, promotion or special duty rolls, or can
be used to gain additional contacts (one per 2 ROP points). Any
remaining ROP points at mustering out can be used as ship DMs.

* CONTACTS
As per TNE29-31 except: Individual Aslan are rarely wealthy
unless high in the clan hierarchy, hence \'wealthy\' contacts are
replaced by \'noble\' ones. \'Government\' contacts within the Clan
Worlds are usually \'nobles\'; in the Hierate such a contact may
be within the Hierate bureaucracy rather than a local noble.

Notes:
*  Age in human years.
** Sk = Skills per term/special duty.
Note also that Aslan age far faster than humans such that they
must make THREE rolls per attribute per term. Aslan rarely use
anagathics and if the player choses to do so, THREE applications
must be made per term - a substantial cost in drugs!

* SKILL- AND ATTRIBUTE-DERIVED VALUES
As TNE35.

* INITIATIVE
As TNE35-36.

* STARTING MONEY AND INITIAL EQUIPMENT
As per TNE36-37 except for male Aslan (except outcasts), halve
the values given on TNE37.

* Starships and New Benefits
As per TNE37-38 except: Male Aslan will only own a starship in
exceptional circumstances (e.g. as a clan noble, a male may have
a starship nominally assigned for his use, although it may be
owned and run by a clan female). Both males and females acquire
starship DMs but males usually convert this to an award of land,
and females may opt to take a share in a corporation. Land is
shown in square kilometres and may provide income, if used for
farming, etc. (a usable profit of perhaps CR 5d6 per year per square
kilometre). Corp indicates the value (MCR) of the character\'s
shares in an Aslan corporation. A dividend of 4% of the value is
payable per year. DMs may be split between two items, e.g. an
Envoy might opt to use half his DMs to try to get a Courier and
the other half to get some land.
Roll   Land   Corp          Roll    Land   Corp

12     40     3             20      10k    12
Notes: Per point over 20, add 10k land or 2 MCR. MP = Medium
Passage. HP = High Passage.

* Stellar Regions
The following DMs apply to ship DMs (whether used for a ship,
land or corporation): Hierate DM 0; Clan-Worlds DM -6; Outcasts
use the table on TNE38.

* Ship Types
Courier = Ktiyhui-class; Escort = Ekawsiykua-class; Scout =
Hraye-class; Seeker = Kteiroa-class; Trader = Eakhau-class. Star
ship type may (optionally) be altered by the roll as per TNE39.

* EDUCATION
College education is less common among Aslan than among the
Vilani and is exceptionally rare among males who can only attend
Flight or Military Academy. Females may attend any of the further
education institutes. College skills and requirements are as per
TNE40-41 except that Hiver Technical Academy is not available.

* CAREERS
As per TNE42 except that term skills are as given in the Age
table above.

* Sex-specific Skills
The Aslan have very fixed ideas about which sex should be allowed
to learn certain skills: Males disdain financial skills, Females
tend to avoid physical combat. The skill clusters given in TNE113
are used here but the following list indicates whether each skill
is available only to Males (M), Females (F) or either (-). The
career skills are listed as: a, b, c; plus M: d; F: e. This
indicates Males may choose from the skills a, b, c and d; Females
may choose from a, b, c or e.

VESSEL: Hovercraft M, Large Watercraft M, Small Watercraft M.
VICE: Bribery F, Disguise -, Streetwise -.
Notes:
- Act/Bluff, Disguise - These skills are very rare among Aslan as
they are considered dishonourable. Additionally, they use the INT
attribute (to outwit the adversary) rather than CHR.
- Gambling - Female Aslan understand the value of money and would
not waste it in this manner; Males rarely \'gamble\' and would
certainly never have any skill in it!
- Unarmed Martial Arts - primarily involves the use of the lethal
Aslan dewclaw as a \'natural\' weapon, as well as jumping kicks,
arm locks and throws.

*Low Tech Skills
Where low Homeworld Tech levels are allowed for a career, some
skills will not be available:
                     For given Tech level, replace by:
Skill                Industrial            Pre-Industrial
Gun Combat           Gun Combat            Archaic Weapons, Armed Martial
                                           Arts or Early Firearms

Space Hand           AnyVeh*               Animal Handling
Space Tech           Technician            Artisan
Space Vessel         AnyVeh*               Animal Handling
Technician           Technician            Artisan, Engineer or Explore
*AnyVeh indicates Aircraft, Personal Transport, Vehicle or Vessel
(as appropriate to the career).
e.g. Pre-Industrial Army is equivalent to Aslan Barbarians;
Envoys existed even in these early societies, etc.

* Skill Clusters
The new skill cluster Racial includes the skills Independence,
Meditation and Tolerance:
- Independence (Males only)
Gives the ability to understand monetary concepts; handling
finance is considered beneath most males and a 1d10 roll equal
to or greater than the character\'s SOC must be made to retain the
skill, otherwise an alternative skill must be taken.
- Meditation
Suitable relaxation techniques allow the Aslan to duplicate any
of the Self skills except Regeneration, with the same skill level
in each and a PSI strength of 1d6 (determined randomly for each
of the Self cascade abilities).
- Tolerance
This skill reflects experience in dealing with Aslan outside the
character\'s own clan, and non-Aslan. Where a misunderstanding
with a non-Aslan would normally require a duel, a successful
skill use indicates the Aslan makes an allowance for the alien\'s
ignorance of Aslan ways, and the duel is avoided.

* CIVILIAN OCCUPATIONS

* Artist
Aslans prize fine artwork and embellishments on all items from
clothing to weaponry. It is the Artist who provides these
finishing touches to various types of ware.
Prerequisites: AGL 7+.
First Term
Skills:
Artisan 5 OR Fine Arts 5, Charm 1; plus M: Interaction 1, Racial
2; F: Interaction 2, Racial 1

All Terms
Special Duty: 7+ for:
Melee, Physical Science, Social Science, Technician, Vice; plus
M: Determination; F: Forgery
Contacts: One per term, academic, business, trader or wealthy.
Other effects: Double the termly cash allowance.

* Assassin
The assassin hires himself out to wronged individuals as a
private \'enforcer\'. Honour requires him to notify his victim and
then to outwit any precautions the victim takes in order to duel
the wrong-doer face-to-face.
Prerequisites: STR 7+ OR AGL 7+, Pop = Moderate+, Sex = Male.
First Term
Skills: Acrobat 2, Gun Combat 3, Melee 3, Racial 1

I would have said *primary* objective. The secondary objective would have

Yeah, that\'s the big problem with a Democracy - you gotta listen to the

This calls to mind a phrase I have heard attributed to Goethe, about

Perhaps this applies to the Solomani as well ... and can be reversed
to describe the Vilani.

One feature of Solomani weapons in my universe is that they use the same
ammo as Imperial ones, but the magazines are designed so that Imperial mags
fit into Solomani guns but not vice versa.

Yes, this is the way I see it. Incidentally, IIRC the Solomani never
acknowledged that the War had ended - the last 115 years were just a long
cease-fire.

If you mean CT\'s _Solomani Rim_, you\'re right on the ball.  For those of 
you who don\'t have a copy (like me two weeks ago), the two government\'s 
had rather peaseful and non-provocative relations with each other, 
although they still weren\'t exactly the best of friends.  The Solomani 
had turned their attention to colonizing the rimward border, and would 
give only verbal support (and maybe weak verbal support, too!) to 
Solomani movement\'s in ex-Solomani, Imperial space.  Probably the only 
real sore point was Terra itself.

Alternate history #5 ! (Along with Emperor Varian, a quick Dulilour coup, 
the assassination of Lucan, and  - most realistic - a fractured, 
burned-out shell of human space, dominated by the Solomani and Lucan II.)

If Dulinor had pulled it off, he still would have had to contend with 
`Solomani racism\' and the Solomani loathing of big government.  I doubt 
if relations would have improved much, although he may have managed to 
make a deal over Terra.

Legality of the armor rating depends on how big the ship is.  In TNE,
armor factor is based on armor thickness in metric units.  It\'s harder
to put an 18 cm thick layer of bonded superdense on a 50 cm sphere
than it is to put the layer on a 500 m sphere!  The 500 m sphere needs
more armor in total, but the armor takes a smaller proportion of the
space available in the sphere at the same thickness.  And the same
thickness of armor now gives the same degree of protection, no matter
what hull it is installed in. 

My \'FI\' Azhanti conversion has a TNE armor rating of over 500, which
takes about the same percentage of the ship for armor as would be seen
in the typical ship designs for a smaller ship; the smaller ships just
carry proportionally *thinner* armor.  So a rating of 2000 in TNE for
a battleship-sized craft is not unreasonable in TNE, and would be under
three-quarters of a meter of bonded-superdense covering the hull.  It
is unreasonable for a 400 ton SDB.

If I remember right, this was around a percent or two of internal volume,
but the gain over CT/MT is offset by the equipment requirements and the
increased crew sizes in TNE. 

I considered 500 the minimum for a strike cruiser or fleet intruder meant
for operations independently or with small fleets, because that\'s the
minimum in Battle Rider that will stop a turret laser.  It had refueling
capability which took a day, because anything faster was too big for the
tight design, but it needed the ability since the cruisers go places 
where they don\'t want to be worrying about protecting fleet tankers.

In my experience, it is possible to make ships which are reasonably close
to the look and feel of the old designs with the TNE rules.  You aren\'t
going to get an exact fit, and the ships will perform differently under
different rules systems and may not be quite optimum anymore without
some adjustments.  The Book 2 designed xboat wasn\'t compatible with Book
5, and this makes things a bit weird even now.  TNE has no repulsors at
Imperial tech-levels, and plasma barbettes need to be laser barbettes,
but it mostly works out, and the ship prices are comparable.  When you
convert, you have to decide which characteristics of the old ship you
most want to keep, and which you\'re willing to compromise on, depending
on the point of the ship in the first place.  A lot of the old tricks
from MT ship design to save space, like not putting life-support in 
fuel tanks, come in handy to cram everything into a conversion.

   TNE is Traveller, simply a further refinement of the game.  There is
no reason why anyone who enjoyed playing Traveller in 1985, shouldn\'t
enjoy playing it in 1995, except they might find the way the storyline
advanced a bit disagreeable (which is why the Regency exists).
 I think this is where your problem with TNE lies.  Some people in my little
gaming group were none too happy about the Rebellion storyline, and
even less happy about the way it ended.  Somehow I have to believe
that if the rules changes had been implemented and Strephon were still
on the throne (in year say, 1125), you\'d be quite happy with TNE.

   The First Solomani Rim War ended in a marginal Imperial victory.  While
they did succeed in reclaiming a portion of the worlds they stood to lose
through Solomani succession, and captured the Confederation\'s
homeworld (Terra),  they failed to crush the rebellion completely.  This
left the Imperium in a position where they had to fortify a border that
had previously been a quiet region.  One wonders how the Rebellion
would have played out differently had all those Imperial assets fighting
the Solomani were instead fighting one of other factions.

   It was my understanding that what drained the Imperium during
Rim War I was the assault on Terra.  That was accomplished primarily by
Imperial Marine and Army forces--the Navy played a much smaller role.
Also, Terra was at the center of the Solomani Confederation prior to
Rim War I.  If capturing Terra isn\'t deep penetration, what is?

   The Solomani Confederation had the potential to be one of the most
repressive government in the history of mankind, and there were
certainly individuals within SolSec, the Party, and the military who
wanted to bring about authoritarian rule.  The central governmental
structure, however, was sufficiently weak that bastions of "liberalism"
could exist on various worlds.  This enabled dissidents to speak
against the central government freely without fear of waking up dead
or imprisoned.  The "liberal haven" worlds paid lip service to the
Solomani Cause, while at the same time granting local citizenship to
non-Solomani humans, genetically manipulated sentients of Terran
origins (dolphins, Vargrs, etc.), even sentients of non-Terran origin
(Aslan, etc.).

>wrench into the works is a Montgomery, someone who is  allowed to

>Too Far").

   Market-Garden failed because the time tables for its execution were
too tight, and the scheme of operation and maneuver wasn\'t flexible
enough.  It was a giant crap shoot, that, had it worked, would have
shortened the war by several months.  Patton\'s alternative was to have
his forces drive into the Saar industrial region.  Patton\'s plan was less
risky, but also would have done less to bring the war to a faster
conclusion.  We can see in hindsight that Monty\'s plan was not the one
to go with, but when Eisenhower approved it, he did not have the
benefit of hindsight.

   Remember as well that the Germans were launching rocket assaults
on England by this time (from sites in Holland and coastal Germany as
I recall)--and Churchill among others feared that the V-1s and V-2s might
succeed where the Luftwaffe didn\'t.  This caused the Brits  to pressure
Ike to approve Market-Garden (which could have knocked out the
launch sites had it worked) instead of Patton\'s offensive.

  [Interesting historical "what if"...what if Patton had been put in charge
of Market-Garden?]

   The Solomani plan could have very well resembled Market-Garden,
in that it was full of rigid  timetables and very specific schemes of
maneuver.  All it would have taken was a few foul-ups here and there
to blow the whole operation out of the water.  We know that the Battle
of Dingir in 1117 was one such foul-up (the Solomani failed to secure
the system)--there were probably others, as I indicated in my last post.

   The ultimate repository is located in Bloomington, IL (OK, like no

have bits of errata, but I know of no site that claims to have it all.
Sounds like a project for someone....

   This sounds like a reasonable fix, though I\'m wondering if we happen
to have a pseudo-expert in Physics out there in Cyberland who could
enlighten us further on this subject.  I do know that Charon, Pluto\'s
moon, has a diameter about 57 percent of its parent body, though it is
less dense.  It could be that we should be talking in terms of mass
instead of diameter.

3) Has Aslan society collapsed as well as the Imperium? What about the 
K\'kree?  Have the K\'kree disappeared from the official universe?

   It can be assumed that the Virus adapted itself to Aslan computer
circuitry pretty quickly, and that there was enough commonality
between clan computers and software so that the Virus was able
to jump from one to another until finally it had spread through out the
Hierate trailing of the Great Rift.

   This fact would not preclude the existence of Aslan pocket empires
where the old Hierate once stood.  It also opens up the possibility of
new Virus types--ones that have a more Aslan-like outlook on the
Universe (Vampire clans, anyone?).  There is also a strong likelihood
that the Aslan colonies would begin expanding back across the
Great Rift to find out what, if anything, might be left of their brethren.
This effort would be accomplished in much the same way that the
Regency is reaching back into the old Imperium.

   The K\'kree?  Anybody\'s guess as to what happened to them, but
if the Hivers were laid low for the most part by the Virus, you can
darn well be sure that the K\'kree bought it just as hard, probably
worse. 

Mark Hughes says:

   The K\'kree did make good vegetarian Nazis, didn\'t they?  : )
They will probably return at some point--not that I can speak for GDW,
but I\'m sure they at least give a fair hearing to a K\'kree write up,
perhaps as a series of Challenge articles.

   As sourcebooks go, they\'re all pretty good.  The one I would
recommend the most would be the Coalition Equipment Guide, because 
of the nice selection of hardware it contains.

  Let me note that I am _not_ doing a book review, nor am I
  discussing the plot.  My comments are purely on production 
  issues, and are strictly my opinions, nobody else\'s.

  The first thing I noticed is that the book is printed and bound 
  using heavier stock than most books of the same size and price.  
  This is good in that it makes the book more durable (I like 
  durable, I tend to read books until they fall apart, sometimes 
  beyond [good books, like Brunner\'s _Shockwave_Rider_, fall into 
  the latter category]).  The only disadvantage to the heavier 
  stock is that it _looks_ like you\'re getting more than you 
  actually are.  This is a good 350-page book; it looks like some 
  400-page novels I have.

  When I started reading the book, I noticed that it was a harder 
  book to look at.  Not to read; it is well-written - but the 
  typography and the paper color combine poorly.  The paper is just 
  a bit off _bright_ white, and the font is a humanist sans-serif 
  font - my best guess is Stone, or a close variation.  The problem 
  with most sans-serif fonts is that the non- (or minimal) 
  variation in line thickness tends to "hide" certain letters.  A 
  serif font, like Times, Garamond, et alia would have been better, 
  or perhaps a variable-thickness sans-serif font, like Optima.  
  Alternatively, brightening the page to increase the contrast 
  might have helped.  I\'d opt for going the Optima or Times route; 
  bright paper can be tiring to look at.

  I also encountered some serious editing boo-boos.  There were a 
  few (really - only two or three) places where duplication of 
  sentences or nearly an entire paragraph occurred.  Disconcerting, 
  to say the least.

  Without giving anything away, I _will_ say that the story was 
  well-done.  I strongly recommend converting it to an adventure 
  format and tossing it into Challenge or a sourcebook.  I hope GDW 
  picks up that ball and runs with it.  I also hope that the two 
  sequels are due out soon.

A recent Digest included the question:  "What is the structure of the
Imperial Army?"  Since I have spent the majority of my Traveller
"career" playing, running, and designing for the Army, I feel qualified
to give my opinion on the subject.

The Imperial Army is the Imperium\'s basic defense.  Each world is
responsible for raising and equipping a self-defense force.  Each
Subsector then organizes the best personnel from the individual SDFs
into the local Imperial Army.  Since the needs of, say, Jewell Subsector
are quite different than that of a Subsector in the Imperial Core, this
system allows for flexibility in training and equipment (for example,
forces in Jewell must be equipped with psionic shields due to the
Zhodani threat).

An advantage of this is a boon to local industry, as the highest tech
industrial world in the region will receive multiple contracts to equip
the Subsector Army.

At a more basic level, the Army probably uses a regimental system,
similar to that of Victorian England.  The Regiment is your home away
>from home, and you serve in the same Regiment as your father did before
you, and his father before him.

Umm..  I don\'t think GDW is flesh out the RC world.  I think they want to 
leave them for the refs, so any ref can set up his adventures as he 
wishs.  If you want to write adventures for RC, Why don\'t you write 
somme, and submit to Challenge..  If they like it, they will use it to 
help them establish the information on RC.  I don\'t think it should stop 
you from designing adventure for RC.

Ironically, the planet that gave them most trouble was propably Terra.
Consider: By 1117 conditions on Terra had been normalized. Civil government
had been returned a few years before. Relations between Terra and the
Imperium were propably more cordial than ever before. And then the 
Confederation moves in. Do you think the Confederation leaders at Home
is going to turn over leadership of the Confederation to Terra? Not bloody
likely! I\'d bet dollars to doughnuts that the first thing they do when they
move in is to decapitate the Terran leadership with treason trials and put
Terra under occupation  -  this time by _Confederation_ forces! By the time
the Virus topples the Confederation Terra is propably fighting a guerilla
war FOR the Imperium! 

Idea for GDW: Loren, can you imagine the fun the RC would have with a
pocket empire centered around Terra that considered itself the legitimate
successor of the Third Imperium? Wouldn\'t that be deliciously ironic?

They have what every navy back to pre-spaceflight Terra have had: A way
of transmitting information (be it flags, aldis, or radio) and secret
verification codes. You don\'t NEED anything as elaborate as the chip
transponders. A courier with a scrap of paper sent ahead will allow a
ship commander to recognize a friendly ship. It\'s simple, really.

No, the presumption is that noone would be silly enough to incorporate a
\'black box\' in their ship\'s electronics that was manufactured by a rival,
potentially hostile, government. This is the aspect of the Virus story
that I have most trouble accepting. The Live Psionic Silicon Chips is
just a McGuffin. I can accept them as readily as I accept jump drives
and psionics. But to believe that any of the Imperium\'s neighbours would
accept something like those black box transponders... GDW says that they
did it because it was the only way to get to trade with the Imperium. BS!
Let me tell you what (IMO) would happen if the Imperium tried anything
like that: All the surrounding states would impose a trade embargo on the
Imperium (perhaps totally, perhaps limited to ships carrying such a
transponder ;-). The Imperial Megacorporations would ask the Emperor for
an audience and the magic transponders would be scrapped toot suite. Mind
you, the Navy would propably keep using them. (Btw. the whole story proves
that the Imperium was ripe for disaster; they make a discovery that makes
true artificial intelligence possible, and what is the first thing they
use it for? Number plates!)

 You asked for it, you got it...

 ::>TL 8 InnerCity Public Transportation Bus

 ::>Price:          10,834 Credits

 Only if an Imperial credit is worth five or more 1960 US 
 Dollars...  and to buy the model of bus that appeared in SPEED, 
 you\'d probably need a seven-to-one rate today...

 ::>Size:           56 Cubic liters = 4 Displacement Tons

 I can\'t comment on this.  I\'ll try to get some measurements the 
 next time I ride one...

 ::>Mass:           6.00 Tonnes Empty, 6.63 Tonnes Loaded

 This is probably about right...

 ::>Power:          0.2 MW TL 5 Improved Internal Combustion Engine

 Probably not improved.  1940\'s vintage Diesel would be about 
 right...

 ::>Maint:          1
 ::>Controls:       TL-8 Enhanced Electronic Ground Vehicle Controls

 Manual linkage.  Period.  Easy to maintain, less likely to break.

 ::>                TL-8 Inertial Positioning Navigational Aid

 No navaids.  Except the driver\'s eyes, the street signs, the 
 kerbs, and the yellow line down the middle of the street...

 ::>Commo:          30km Radio Communication Suite

 Probably only about 10km.

 ::>Sensors:        2xFront HeadLights
 ::>Life Support:   Light, Heat
 ::>Cargo:          125kg

 Zero.  This is an urban rapid transit bus, not an intercity bus.  
 Strictly carryon, in the passenger compartment.

 ::>Crew:           1
 ::>Passnegers:     12

 Seats for 20-30 (I never counted.  Probably closer to the 30).  
 Standing room for another 30, officially.  Try about 50 standees 
 during rush.  Total capacity officially about 50, really 75-80.

 ::>Armament:       None
 ::>Max Speed:      93 kph Road speed/19 kph Cross Country speed

 Downhill, with a _good_ tailwind.  Maybe.  Most of those busses 
 can\'t do better than about 45km/h on level ground.  65 when new, 
 and empty.

T::>Travel Move:    186/78  [kilometers per 4 hours]
 ::>Combat Move:    43/18   [m/s]

 No, probably about 3/4 of this.  I\'ll check this as well.

 ::>                        Fill up:   125 Credits

 Close.  Probably a bit more, at least in NYC.  Call it 150, at 
 $1=1Cr.

 ::>                        Fuel Type: Hydrocarbon Distillates

 Low grade...

 No more than 2km/l.  At any speed.

A question for GDW, if _Alien\'s of the Rim_ hasn\'t been 
finalized/published yet...

How did the Hivers take control of their very dangerous warbot\'s?
Is the questioned answered in the _Rim_ book?
(For those without the CT Robot supplement, Hiver warbot\'s were so 
dangerous that importing them into the Imperium was a crime...)


A question for everyone else...

How do you think that infected Vargr robot\'s should be played?
(Vargr robots are built to truly shoddy specifications... anytime that 
good `Vargr\' robots are sold, they are invariably ex-Imperial property 
(often stolen).

More interesting "Alternate questions"!  I suspect that, if the Confederation
was part of the Imperium during the Rebellion, it would depend vitally on 
who was the Archduke at the time.  If he was a strong, pro-Imperial 
Archduke (a la Norris) the area would either have provided muscle and a
centre for the `Moderate pro-Imperial\' fractions (Norris, Margaret, Craig, 
maybe Brks and that guy in charge of Gateway) to retake the Imperium.  If he 
was strong and pro-independent, the Solomani Confederation v.2 would have 
been born.  If he was weak, the area would have fractured into a billion 
fragments as local independent movements take off.

An excellent point.

Where is the 1117 Battle of Dingir covered?

THIS is interesting, to see if the Aslan New Lords can retake their old 
clan holdings!  Does the infected portions of the Hierate even remember 
the old clans?  Have new clans formed to replace the old ones? (I would 
think yes!)  How has the Aslan Honor Code chaned in the Wilds?  It 
certainly isn\'t the universal code it used to be!

The Aslan\'s are so LAND... LAND... LAND hungry, I wouldn\'t be surprised 
if they have ALREADY started their reconquest!

Thank you, Mr. Zeitlin, for not discussing the plot!
Anyone who has bought the book, please DO NOT post spoilers here!

By 1117 Terra had been "occupied" for over a century. Marriages
between Imperial Marines and Terran natives had been going on for
quite some time (see the TD issue with the article on the occupation
forces). The annual soccer tournament between the Terran champions and
the Marine team was a popular event (same issue). Also, certain facets
of the occupation had woven themselves into the fabric of daily life
(I\'m thinking specifically of the "fixed times for visiting others"
mentioned in _Sol & Aslan_, a result of the curfew laws). I would
certainly believe a sizable amount of the population was satisfied
with the status quo.

Also, Terra is a high-pop world and a center of trade. One might
expect a certain cosmopolitan attitude, especially due to the
not insignificant alien presence (Aslan are stated as being present in
most major cities, the Hivers have their colony in Australia, and
there are probably plenty of Vegans on the planet at any given time). 
This would tend to produce less support for the doctrinaire Party
factions and more for the liberal factions (like the HDV and
Pan-Sophontists). This as opposed to the "ethnic world" colonies which
were founded on cultural purity issues to begin with.

Note that in _Survival Margin_, Terra\'s UWP even after the reconquista
is A867A69-F, indicating it\'s still a "captive government". It calls
to mind the pictures in _Sol & Aslan_ of the somewhat
depressed-looking people shuffling through crowded city streets,
presumably on Terra, with the huge signs in the background reading
"The Party Is Freedom" and the like.

This list of Regency Aliens is a chopped-up varient of an earlier work I 
have found, originally written by Mitchell K. Schwartz.

Local sentient\'s - major races:

Humaniti - Solomani, Vilani, Zhodani
Vargr - (someone with the correct sourcebook, please name the major races 
         of Vargr, and where they are... thanks.)
         One major branch is known to me... the Urzaeng, as big as the 
         Aslan, though not as smart. (Bred by the Ancients as guards).  
         Throughout the Vargr Extents.
K\'Kree - there is one contient of a Regency world (names?), which is the 
         home of diplomatic K\'Kree stranded in the Regency.  Apparently, 
         they have managed to form a company of some kind , (in 
         entertainment or  starship construction?)
Droyne - are on about 20 worlds in the marches, and about 15 elsewhere
         in the Regency.
Hivers - there are none.
Aslan - there are lot\'s of them, esp in the rimward regions of the Regency.
        Most Aslan Subjects of the Regent would be considered outcasts by 
        their Hierate brethern.  Would someone here do a nice write-up of 
        Regency Aslan, please? (I would do it myself, but lack the 
        Solimani & Aslan book)

Minor races 

Humaniti: 

Daryen (ex-Darrian\'s) - Daryen/Spinward Marches 0627
           See Aliens 8: Daryens (seem remarkably elf-like: 
           forest-dwelling, pointed ears, etc.)

Foriani - Floria/Trojan Reaches 0213
          Made up of two castes, the Barnai (top) and the Feskals (Bottom).
          See TD 20.

Halkans - Halka/Trojan Reach 0510
          "Halkans appear to be slightly built albinos, but they are 
          not.  Their eyes are pale grey (nearly white).  Their hair color 
          ranges from white to ash-pale blond.  Discovered by Florian 
          explorers in -50 ti, they were held as slaves untol 1000\'s.  See 
          TD 19.

Jonkeereen - Jonkeer/Deneb 1324
          "Geneered race [by the Imperial Ministry of Colonialization], 
          designed for desert existance.  Originally designed for a desert 
          planet on Gushmege to counter Suerrat expansion in the 500s and 
          400s, they were developed by SUSag on Jonkeer in the 500s and 
          developed their own subculture in the 600s.  See MTJ3."

Nexies - Nexine/Spinward Marches 3030
         "Nexine is an underpopulated water world being "reseeded" by the 
         Ministry of Conservation (as of 1105) using biologically altered 
         humans.  No description available.  See Supplement 3 Spinward 
         Marches."

Syleans - Sylea/Core
         "Human minor race responsible for the Sylean Federation, which 
         became the Third Imperium" {Probably overrepresented in the 
         Regency Nobility.}

Tapazmal - Dlaekan/Reft 3134 (the Wild side of Reft sector)
         "Geneered by the Ancients for low birth rate, later raided by 
         the Loeskalth before annexation by the Zira Sirku.  See TD20."

Other: 
 
Bwaps/Newts - Found throughout the Regency, and was once common 
              throughout Imperial space.  Amphibious, very good bureaucrats.

Ebokin - Based on Yebab/Spinward Marches 2202.
         "Arthopod octoped sophonts living mostly planet-bound on this 
          one planet at TL 5."  See the Traveller Adventure

Gl\'lu - Kubishush/Deneb 0917
        "Heraphroditic septapodal minor race.  See TD1."
        (A little more info would be nice, for those who don\'t have TD1)

Keo Neseb  -  Penkwar/Spinward Marches 2128
         "Extinct insectoid race resembling giant praying mantises. 
         Believed to have reached their apex about 8 million years ago, 
         having reached at least two neighbors Persephone and Harvosette. 
         See RICE paper on Persephone."

Larianz - Byret/Spinward Marches 2523
         See Spinward Marches Campagin (again, more info for us latecomers
         would be appreciated.)

Llellewyloly - Junidy/Spinward Marches 3202
         Large plant-like people. (Moble?) Population about 14 billion in 
         the early 1100\'s. Nicknames Dandies. See Traveller adventure.

Salika - Garden/Reft 0435
         "Humanoid race evolved to be aquatic, covered in short fine fur 
         like a seal, with slightly webbed multi-jointed fingers. The Salika 
         abandoned their home world in generation ships when their sun went 
         through a hot phase about 1000 ti. Friendly and tolerant, not 
         prone to combat. They live only 45-55 standard years. See TD19&20."

Shi\'awei - Chaosheo/Deneb 0130 
         "Bulky aquatic creatures; bullet shaped with 4 evenly spaced 
         arms. See TD19."

Shreikers - 567-908/Spinward Marches 1031
          "Intelligent hexapods about 1 m at the shoulder. They talk at the 
          high end of human hearing, hence their name. Achieved TL3 before a
          planetary tectonic disaster shook them back down to TL0. See 
          Adventure 11 Safari Ship."

Tentrassi - Origin unknown
          "The Tentrassi wander space in nomad jump fleets, seeking their 
          lost home world. Nomad Fleet 8 visited Raweh (Spinward Marches 
          0137) around 1100 and again in 1122 ti. See MTJ3." 
          (Any info on tech levels?)

   It also brings to mind the phrase "the veneer of Democracy" the
source of which escapes me at the moment.  Certainly not all worlds
in the Solomani Confederation had an Orwellian quality to them, but
all most all of them were practicing hypocrites when it came to matters
of personal freedom and expression.  Very reminiscent of several
groups which existed in late 20th century Earth that were known
collectively as the "Politically Correct" and the "Moral Majority".

   Very convenient--except that wouldn\'t the Imperial types figure out
what the Solomani were up to make an "improvement" to their designs
so that Solomani mags wouldn\'t fit in Imperial weapons?

   In fact, the right wing of the Solomani Party (which held posts all the
way up the hierarchy to the High Council), wanted no less than the
return of all territory seized by Imperial government prior to the First
Rim War.  The "lunatic fringe" of the right wing wanted the
re-establishment of the Second Imperium, and perhaps even an empire
encompassing all of Known Space with themselves as its leaders.

   Moderates (which made up the majority) were willing to settle for a
return of Terra and several other systems (Prometheus for one).
Right-leaning moderates were unwilling to rule out a military option to
accomplish this, while left-leaning moderates believed that diplomacy
was the key.

   Liberals (which were decidedly in the minority, but controlled several
key worlds) believed that the Imperium would never willingly give up
Terra, and that it was a waste of time and resources to attempt to
regain control of it.  They wanted to engage in a dialog with the Imperium
on gaining access to Terra for cultural and trade purposes.  They
wanted the border between the Imperium and the Confederation to
be open to all travel (just as the border between the U.S. and Canada
is now).  Liberals ranged from the pragmatic (who wanted to use the
resources spent on a massive military build-up on colony ships for
rimward expansion), to the idealistic (who believed that all sentient
creatures should chose to live together in harmony).  The "lunatic fringe"
of the left wanted re-integration into the Imperium--these people were
closely monitored by SolSec and were subject to local persecution.

Additional note:  If the Solomani were so against "big government" why
did they insist on trying to keep biological and security files on
everyone in the Confederation?

Re: Armor Value of what?

   I will have to admit at this point to not attempting a design over 5,000
displacement tons.  That shocking confession out of the way, I will
also say that it sounds like the rules are attempting to recreate to some
extent the system that existed under High Guard--that large
ships are not really bothered by turret weapons (except that they can
have stuff scraped off)--for the really big ships you need a BAMG
(big *ss meson gun) to get inside them and wreak serious havoc.
A typical TL 15 large warship therefore must have two things: a BAMG
(already defined) and a BAMS (big *ss meson screen).  Everything
else you add just aids the performance of these two components.

   But hopefully not too much flexibility.  All small arms would be
standardized, as would infantry support weapons, artillery, ortillery,
and armored fighting vehicles.  True, the Imperial Army located in the
Old Expanses would have little need for psionic shields, but you can be
pretty sure that there is a warehouse somewhere on Vland that has
cartes of them in case the crap hits the fan and Vland Sector units get
deployed in Deneb Sector to help turn back a Zhodani incursion.

   They would have been awarded the contract *only* if they could
manufacture what the Army needs according to the Army\'s
specifications.  The Imperial Army would have little use for TL 14
battledress helmets from Core that weren\'t compatible with the TL 14
battledress suits in the Solomani Rim.  

   Another thing, given the ease of interstellar trade and travel in the
Imperium, parts were likely purchased from the "low bidder",
and shipped where they were needed.  A soldier in the Diaspora
Sector would likely have FGMP-15 from the Massilia Sector; an e-suit
from the Solomani Rim; oxygen tanks and other environmental gear
from his home sector; and communications and other electronic gear
from the Old Expanses.  All these components would be designed to
fit together as though they came out of the same building.

   A basis at regimental level for the Marines makes sense, especially
sense their are a lot fewer of them.  For the Army, I\'d think you\'d be
talking division level, IMHO.  In the U.S. Army, the exploits of various
divisions (especially the 82nd Airborne) have become the stuff of
legends.  Each division gets its own distinctive patch, and I\'m sure that\'s
probably true of the Imperial Army.

   As to making membership in a division hereditary, the problem is that
such a system is not conducive to maintaining a professional army.
Yes, there are individuals in the 20th century who strive to be (and
frequently are) assigned to the same unit their father was when he was
in the army, but I don\'t know of any current "modern" army where this
is official policy.

I believe that the Imperium actually had more potential for being "the most 
repressive government in history", and that the orginal Ziru Sirka was it.  
I also think that a closer examination of the political structure of the
Solomani
Confederation would show that the central government was more than 
"sufficiently weak".  Remember that the Solomani member states, unlike
Imperial worlds, could join as interstellar states, and many did.  Many of 
those interstellar states are at least as large as, as populated as, and as 
technologically advanced as the Vegan Autonomous Region; they would give
the Confederation just as much trouble if they got riled up enough to secede.
Many of these states\' citizens no doubt feel a certain nationalism, and 
remember that the Confederation Armed forces are made up of these citizens.
Not only that, member states have their own militaries and citizen militias (the
Home Guard) -- another strike against strong central government, or organized
repression by the Confederation as a whole.  OTOH, without much central
government oversight, the individual member nations can rule their citizens
pretty much as they please, and some pretty horrible governments can result
--
the Wuan Technocracy comes to mind.  On the gripping hand, this can 
happen on Imperial worlds, too, since they are allowed home rule, and anything
short of slavery and mass genocide is allowed.

In short, SolSec and the Solomani Party had only as much authority as the
local government was willing to allow them, and the more powerful "local" 
governments are not likely to be easily intimidated by them.  If it is in the
interests of, say, the Kostov Confederate Republik to give SolSec free reign,
they will; otherwise, SolSec has to operate covertly, and possibly against the
laws of the host nation.  I will concede, based on material in "Cats & Rats" that
SolSec has been trying to strengthen their central government by installing their
own puppets in charge of strong member nations.  It also looks like their tactics
are backfiring on them.  As the situation stood in 1120 or so, either SolSec is
going to be purged of the covert-op cowboys because of its abuses of power,
or there\'s going to be revolution in the central government, or there\'s going to
be a Civil War between the States\' Rights and Centrist factions.  No one\'s going
to war over a bunch of aliens; any Solomani Civil War will be over fundamental
issues like the central government trying to strip members of their traditional 
rights and perogatives.

It\'s really up to you, but I\'d think that he would keep his old rank, 
esp. if he\'s reenlisting into RCES (They lack qualified personnel)

You _may_ give a promotion for training, but this is a personal decision, 
and isn\'t standard policy.

>Ironically, the planet that gave them most trouble was probably Terra.

   It took the Solomani two tries to land on Terra and ultimately take
control of it in 1117.  In a history I am putting together based on the
old Traveller News Service bulletins from Challenge, the first assault
tried to establish a foothold on Terra somewhere in Asia and was
repulsed with high casualties on both sides.  The second attempt
tried and succeeded in establishing a foothold on Australia.  It took
the Solomani until the end of the year to mop up the last pockets of
Imperial resistance.  Even then, hundreds of  Imperial Marines escaped
capture by the Solomani and began a resistance campaign that
managed to destroy several key installations and assassinate a number
of Solomani political figures (among them Jeffrey Long).  The siege of
Terra is important in the Second Rim War, because the Imperial
ground troops left behind managed to tie up large numbers of Solomani
forces which could have made a significant difference had they been
available for use elsewhere.

<snip>

   You are correct in most of your analysis.  Without question, all the
"collaborators" (or at least their leaders) in the Terran Imperial
government "resigned", or took early retirements (never to be heard
from again).  A few dozen were probably picked out for show trials
where they were given a death sentence or ordered to serve  long
prison terms (if they cooperated in rounding up Imperial sympathizers).

>By the time the Virus topples the Confederation Terra is probably
>fighting a guerilla war FOR the Imperium! 

   Not the whole planet, but to be sure the surviving Imperial Marines
on Terra had become very effective guerrillas.  With the help of
local collaborators, they were a constant thorn in the Solomani\'s side
right up until the end.

He also says with regard to transponders:

   If you have to wait until you are within visual range in ship combat
to identify whether a bogey is friendly or enemy, chances are you\'re
going to be dead before you find out the bad news that he wasn\'t who
you thought he was.  The problem with straight radio communication
is that radio transmissions can be intercepted--or worse faked by the
bad guys.  All it takes is the right code or a friendly, pleasant speaking
person who can bluff his way through a conversation.  While that
adds all kinds of role-playing opportunities for PCs, it doesn\'t do much
for a peace time navy worried about espionage.  The chip transponders
came into vogue because they couldn\'t be faked (see Challenge article,
among other sources).

>No, the presumption is that noone would be silly enough to incorporate
>a \'black box\' in their ship\'s electronics that was manufactured by a
>rival, potentially hostile, government.

   Only three governments of any major consequence were "potentially
hostile" to the Imperium:

   The Zhodani Consulate - Which of course is on the "correct" side of
the Great Rift, and bears no further discussion.

   The Solomani Confederation - Who was theoretically still at war with
the Imperium in 1117, but who\'s merchants were by that time engaging
in trade with the Imperium.  If I\'m in charge of the Solomani/Imperial
border for the Imperium, you\'re darn straight I\'m going to tag and track
the travels of every Solomani merchant that comes across the frontier.
If I\'m a Solomani merchant, I have no trouble fitting my ship with a
transponder, if that means I have access to all the lucrative markets
on the Imperial side of the border.  It is quite possible that the Solomani
were growing their own version of the Cymbeline chip in 1117--
remember that the Solomani *owned* that world at one time.  The
difference between the chips being that the Solomani didn\'t consider
their version to be sentient (which it wasn\'t).

   The Julian Protectorate - Here you might have something, except that:

   the Virus could be transmitted by any kind of data exchange...I say
again, any kind of data exchange.  The x-boat routes were probably
just as effective at spreading the Virus as those cursed chips you are
complaining about.  They were certainly the primary means by which  the
major worlds of the Imperium and the Solomani Confederation received
infection.  The Julian Protectorate would not have been immune to
infection by data exchange, and since every single interstellar society
interacted with every other interstellar society in Known Space (either
directly or indirectly), no one this side of the Great Rift would be
immune.

>GDW says that they did it because it was the only way to get to trade
>with the Imperium. BS!

   Here in the U.S., we are not in the habit of letting potentially hostile
aircraft violate our airspace.  The Imperium probably had a similar
policy.  And as I pointed out, what\'s the harm of mounting a transponder?
A merchant wouldn\'t see the harm, given the markets it opens up.

>Let me tell you what (IMO) would happen if the Imperium tried anything

   If all the surrounding states could actually agree on anything.  I\'m
sure that the K\'kree and Hivers would disagree on the color of snow
(though I\'m sure the Hivers would manipulate the K\'kree into agreeing
with them :-)  ), let alone an embargo policy.  And you believe that you
could get even a significant percentage of the Vargr to agree?!  Ha!
You\'d have better luck with the Solomani, and unless it involved them
recovering Terra somehow, forget it!

   As the comic relief of your campaign.  They are the most intelligent,
friendliest, most caring and compassionate sentient species in Known
Space--unfortunately they have this bad habit of falling apart (literally)
at a crucial moment....

>More interesting "Alternate questions"! <snip>

   An ending to make TNE storyline haters happy...

   Since there would be no Solomani invasion, Daibei doesn\'t succeed
from the Imperium.  Those forces, plus those in the Sol Rim are committed
to fighting Dulinor (we\'ll presume...you are correct in stating that the
sector might have declared for Margaret, in which case the Collapse
still occurs).  With an additional six full fleets (the Daibei Fleet, the
Diaspora Fleet,, the Magyar Fleet, the Solomani Rim Fleet,  the Alpha
Leonis [Crucis] Fleet, and the Aldebaran Fleet  now baring down on
Dulinor, he puts up a valiant but losing struggle against Lucan.  In
secession, the territory of Strephon, Margaret, Vland, and Antares are
re-absorbed into the Imperium.  The Vargr are driven off, as are the
Aslan, and peace and tranquility are restored to the Third Imperium for
a decade or so.  Lucan turns out to be nuttier than a fruitcake (surprise!)
but is *not* assassinated, because everyone fears a repeat of the
Rebellion.  He dies in his sleep of "natural causes" a few years later,
and Norris is offered the throne, which he of course accepts.

   ...and they all lived happily ever after....

>Where is the 1117 Battle of Dingir covered?

   It is mentioned in a couple of Traveller News Service bulletins.  The
implications the battle had on the rest of the Second Rim War have been
extrapolated by me and included in a history of the Solomani Rim I\'m
working on.

Re: The Aslan

   I have not been privy to what ever plans GDW has for the Aslan in
the proposed Regency sourcebook, but perhaps Loren could give us
a preview. <hint>

It wasn\'t of immediate use (since I don\'t run an Imperial campaign), but the information
is one of the few pieces from this list which I\'ve stored for future reference.

By all means continue to post here.  Or count me as one of your independent

  A quick glance at page 70 of my copy of FF&S shows the first self
contained thrusters coming at TL 5 (Turbojet, Ramjet, LF Rocket, SF Rocket).

  So starting at TL 5, you have a chance.  With the Space:1889 add on rules
to FF&S (hmm..perhaps I should CC Loren on this :->), you should be able to
build etherflyers at TL 3.

All things being relative, there have to be Hiver scales of courage. Any

Just to play "Devil\'s advocate here, but it could be argued that while
such marriages took place, they were frowned upon by most of Terran
society (G.I.s returning home to America from the Allied occupation of
Japan after WW II with a Japanese bride in tow encountered a great deal
of prejudice...as did French women who took German soldiers as
lovers during the German occupation).

Devil\'s advocate:

   Could it have been popular because they liked to see the "local boys"
kick the butts of the occupiers?  Remember the movie "Victory" starring
Pele, Michael Caine, Sly Stallone et. al.?  The crowds cheered the
Allied players, much to the chagrin of the Germans who set up the event.

Devil\'s advocate:

   Ration stamps were an every day part of life for Americans in World
War II (they are frequently mentioned in the cartoons of the era).  That
didn\'t stop people from enthusiastically burning them (a little prematurely
as it turned out) when they heard the war was over.

   Agreed, all except the Vegan part.  Vegans would have found Terra
a very uncomfortable place to live, because of the high gravity
(remember, there are three worlds which are inhabited completely by
humans in the Vegan Autonomous District because of their high gravity).
Vegans are generally restricted (depending on the density of the
planet) to worlds of size 6 or less.

   We agree here.

   If that\'s Earth, I hope that Vegan in the picture is wearing a special
support suit.  Earth\'s gravity would cause serious injury and eventual
death to an unprotected Vegan.

   And remember...the Party is your friend.  You like your friends, don\'t
you?  So you must like the Party, or we\'ll make sure you don\'t have any
friends....<argh!>

Shalom Zaidfeld asks:

>Did anyone on the list tried to design a low tech (TL 4-5 range)
>spaceship?
>Is it possible to design one using FF&S rules?

At tech level 4 - Impossible.  Basic life support hasn\'t been invented
yet (I assume you want who ever you are sending up to come back
alive), and what rockets there are simply can\'t be built powerful
enough to carry more than a few kilos (not to mention range 
restrictions).
 
At tech level 5 - Maybe.  Basic life support is available, as are
liquid and solid fuel rockets for propulsion.  Your biggest problems would
be: 

a) Designing a rocket big enough to carry all that heavy equipment
into space.  As I recall, such rockets were not available on Terra until
TL 6 was achieved.  This task would be easier on a world with less
overall mass (say one the size of Mars), therefore less gravity to
overcome.

b) Figuring out a way to shield your volunteer from exposure to radiation
(assuming that you want who ever it is  to live a semi-normal life span
after they return).  TL 5 vacc suits are available, but provide little
protection from radiation.

   Flights into space at TL 5 are going to be of the low earth orbit variety,
with how many rads an astronaut can take probably being the limiting
factor (needless to say, an astronaut\'s career would consist of years
of training followed by a short flight into orbit and permanent retirement). 
Determining the exact health problems to be encountered would be up
to the referee, as I can find nothing in the Traveller rules which covers
the topic.

    'body' => '  This is a list of guidelines for creating Vargr characters for TNE. It is

BACKGROUND SKILLS: As for human characters
DEFAULT SKILLS: As for human characters

Listed next are the Vargr careers and their TNE equivilents. Some careers can
have more than one equivilent.

ADMINISTRATOR: Bureaucrat
ARISTOCRAT: Use the Wealthy Traveller career. CHR 8+ required.
BARBARIAN: Barbarian (of course)
BELTER: Belter
CORSAIR: This one is tricky. The Vargr Alien Module seems to indicate that
this career is similar to the Marines, while Vilani and Vargr seems to have it
be much like the Corsair career listed in the TNE rulebook. These guidelines
suggest using the Corsair career.
DOCTOR: Medicine
EMISSARY: Diplomat
EXPLORER: Scout
HUNTER: Hunter
LAW ENFORCER: Law Enforcer
LEADER: Manager
LONER: Use Bounty Hunter, Criminal, Mercenary or Tough as appropriate
MERCHANT: Trader
MILITIA: Army
NAVY: Navy
RAIDER: Use the Marines career, possibly with Special Forces
ROGUE: Criminal
SCIENTIST: Scientist

AGING: As for humans

VARGR CHARISMA AND LEADERSHIP: A Vargr\'s Charisma score (and hence his
Leadership asset) can change rapidly based on the character\'s social
position. Whenever a character gets a noteable success, a Difficult CHR
check allows the Vargr and increase of +1 to his Charisma stat relative to
other Vargr. His stat for humans remains the same. A significant failure will
reduce the Vargr\'s charisma by one unless he can succeed at an Average
Charisma check. A Vargr will respond to humans of Charisma A+ much as he would
to a strongly charismatic member of his own race. The Leadership asset is used
to determine who a Vargr will follow. The character with the highest Leadership
asset in a Vargr group will be the leader unless and until someone else
surpasses him.

SKILL BONUSES: Vargr get a -1 difficulty level on all Observation tasks
involving smell and hearing.

As you can see, it\'s pretty rough. I had trouble figuring out how to handle
Charisma changes during character creation. (Some kind of success roll for
each term, or possibly tied to promotions?) Any help with this would be

I have made a HIWG document for generating Vargr character for TNE. I 
think I posted it a few months ago. It is also available at sunbane as 
142_14.txt. And for those who are interested I\'ll post it again.

Doc 142.14,  Date: January 15, 1994

                             BUILDING THE PERFECT DOG

This document has been an article on KU #4. Since then I have changed the rules 
a bit, and modified the careers. This document will be upgraded as new special 
careers pop up.

As the Traveller: The New Era (TNE) do not include Vargr character generation I 
will present some rules here that I think will be of use. Note that GDW may have
other plans for Vargr character generating. As the Vargr is quite close to 
humans (not counting looks, ancestry and behaviour) their skill will be quite
like. And I won\'t introduce any new skills.


THE STATS

Vargr got the same stats as humans, with one exception. Vargr do not have Social
status, but their Charisma rating is the measure to find where they stand in the
Vargr society. A Vargr with high Charisma will attract other Vargr for 
followers. So put a \'-\' in the Soc box on the character sheet. The stats are 
rolled as following. STR 2D2-2, AGL 2D6, CON 2D-2, INT 2D6-1, EDU 2D-1, CHA
1D6.

If the total stats are less than 33, the player can add the difference to the
character stats, with these exceptions: CHA cannot be increased to more than 3. 
Any other stat cannot be increased beyond 11. The 33 limit is lower than the 
limit in the rulebook of 36. The reason for this is that the Vargr is generaly 
weaker than an average human.

When calculating the weight of a Vargr use the same formula as for humans, but 
the base weight is 70Kg. Making generally Vargr smaller than Humans. The base
weight is the same for males as for females. For hand combat damage factor is
the same as for humans, but add 1D6 damage each time the Vargr elects to use his
or hers claws. For using the claws the skill is as for unarmed combat, Unarmed 
Melee skill which all Vargr characters start with at level 0, Leadership is also
a skill they start with at 0.


SELECTING CAREERS

The Vargr can use all the careers in the book except for "Hiver Technical 
Academy". There are some consideration to Vargr when they are generated. Firstly
their Charisma rating is a measurement of how successful a given Vargr is. The 
Charisma rating may go up and down during generation.For CHA beyond A the cost 
is doubled. Thus it cost is 2 points from A to B. But loss of one point in CHA 
brings you automatically from B to A. In some careers there is possible to make 
a big enough mistake that you are thrown out. This is true to all military 
careers. This does not however stop the character generation, the character just
has to enter a new career, but not a military one, if he or she makes the 
continuity roll. Even if you are thrown out from a career, you always finish the
term before you enter a new one.

CHA is increased/decreased like this:
   +1 If promotion is made.
   +1 if 12+ is rolled. Cumulative with above modifier. 
      And promoted an additional rank.
   -1 if the promotion roll is missed by 4 or more
   -2 and demoted if the roll is natural 2 regardles of DM\'s. Not cumulative
      with above modifier. Holds true for both special duty and promotion
rolls.
   If a natural 2 is rolled twice in a given military career the character is
      thrown out at the end of the term.

If your character is from Society of Equals in Gvurrdon, he or she must make a 
special roll to be rated equal. This is essential to enter the following 
careers: Any military officer, Diplomat, Lawenforces or Aristocrat.

   Difficult, Willpower

This task is rolled before the character generation is started. If the roll is a
catastrophic failure roll 1D6 and divide the result on the STR, AGL and CON 
stat. Reduce the stats accordingly. This is damage taken from the test. 

Example: A player rolls 4 on the die, when he has failed. Thus the stats has to 
be reduced with one each. For the remaining point the player may choose which
stat to reduce.


CAREERS:

**Oruelaen**
Psionic forces of Thirz Empire in Gvurrdon. Thirz empire has a special force of 
psionic agents. They are not secret agents as portraied in movies, but rather a 
information gathering group for the King in Thirz Empire. Not much are actually 
known about them publicly, so a lot of myths has been spun around them. All 
sophonts that are citizens of Thirz Empire may apply. They will be tested for
potentiality before they are admitted. For ranks use Army table in the rulebook.
All who are admitted start with rank E5 Sergeant. Rank O10 General is not 
available for playing characters when King Thir holds this position. As the 
force is small and there is only possible to get promoted when a operative dies 
or quits, the agents start at Enlisted rank, no matter what kind of academies or
careers they have attended before. Those who are admitted get a Cha+1

PREREQUESITES: PSI strenght of 8+, and at least one of these abilities:

               rolled 1D6


**Aristocrat**

As an aristocrat you know how the interstellar governments in the extents is 
working. And if you are lucky and use your skills properly, you might be able

               below 8 the character may not continue this career. Note that 
               CHA may not get above 15 or F.


**Fair Witness**

This career are only open to citizens of Thoengling Empire in Gvurrdon
Sector. A Fair Witness (FW) is a profession where a Vargr, or some other sophont
has gone through a training, giving total recall. FW is pledged to report 
whatever it observed when on duty. Most FW is working free-lance, but need a 
permit to do so. There is almost impossible to bribe a FW to tell something 
else, that the FW did observe. The reason for this is that the job itself gives 
quite good economical freedom, and Charismatic standing among the Vargr. A FW
will never offer an oppinion, nor a theory when on duty. Or  speak his or her
meaning when recalling something they observed while on duty. Thus if asked why 
a person acted has he did, the FW cannot answer this, but only tell what the 
person did. The FW will recall what he saw, heard, smelled, felt and so on. A FW
may be hired by anyone, but as they get better, their fee increase accordingly. 
FW are often used when deals are been made, or when there is need for a 
independent witness in a certain process.

When an obervation is going to be made, let the PC roll an imprint task, using 
observation as asset. Base difficulty should be difficult, adjusted depending on
the situation. When the given situation is to be recalled later, a new task is 
rolled. The difficulty on this task depends on the success level on the prior
task.

Asset: Observation
Imprint Success Level    Recall Difficulty
----
Outstanding Success      Routine  
Success                  Difficult
Failure                  Formidable

Success                 75%
Failure                 50%
Outstanding Failure      0%

VARGR VERSUS OTHER SOPHONT INTERACTION

First time a non Vargr character is interacting with Vargr NPC\'s or other Vargr 
characters, divide that characters CHA with 2, and drop fractions. The result
may not be below 1. Note however that this will reduce all assets EXCEPT 
language skills. For the character to increase his or hers CHA to normal level 
follow the general CHA increase and decrease rules below. The opposit is also
true when a Vargr are going to interact with humans for the first time. Note 
that both of these cases relates to Humans in a Vargr dominated society, or 
Vargr in a Human dominated society.


CHARISMA INCREASES AND DECREASES

When a session is over there should be checked if the leader of the group,
the 
character with the highest CHA, will increase his charisma. The difficulty
level
is up to the referee. But I will give a few pointers.

Asset: Leadership.

  The session was an outstanding success    Average
  The group met its goals in the session    Difficult
  The group barely made the goals           Formidable
  The group made only a few of its goals    Impossible

If any of these tasks are a catastrophic failure the leader loose 1 point of 
Charisma. If the leader has CHA of A or more increase the difficulty with one

level.

The difficulty levels should be modified with how difficult the adventure was. 
If the adventure was an total failure, the character must roll a formidable task
to prevent Charisma decrease. If that roll is a catastrophic failure, the leader
loose 2 points of Charisma.

The leader may also by commendate or reprimand the others in the group, and thus
increase or decrease the CHA of these characters. The leader may only commendate
a character if he himself got a CHA increase, but he may reprimand a character 
whenever he wish. But reprimand a character without reason will have 
counterproductive results, and the referee should penalize this.

One good roleplaying tip is that the referee places the players in clockwise 
fashion, with the highest CHA rated character to the left of him. Whenever there
is an important decission to be made, ask the leader first. Ignore the others
for a while. If the leader is hesitating, this can mean a loss in Charisma 
specialy if other players start to come with solutions. This is to simulate that
the other Vargr always look to their leader. If the leader fails the others may 
take command. The referee should be a bit careful with this approach though. The
player may not be good at roleplaying in this fashion, so the referee should 
give him more time than a player that got good abilities at this type of 
roleplaying.

Whenever 2 players got equal or a difference of one level in Charisma a 
Charismatic struggle erupts. The leader must then roll a difficult leadership
roll to stay in position. If the roll fails, the two players change position. If
a catastrophic failure is rolled, the leader loose 2 CHA points.

The referee may also increase or decrease the CHA of characters during play, to 
give them a feel of how successful they are. However this should be used 
sparingly. If a player shows some initiative, and do something daring and 
succeeds he should be awarded. In doubt let him roll a difficult task. Equally 
he should loose Charisma if he does something and fails, especially if he 
endangers the mission and the adventure group.

Other uses of Charisma is that a high Charisma Vargr will always reduce the 
Initiative  to the opposition by one to a minimum of one, if they are of lower 
Charisma. If the Charisma to the leaders of the two groups are equal, let the
player roll a difficult leadership to gain the upper hand. If this fails the 
opponent get the upper hand. When calculating loss of initiative to combat 
damage use the original initiative.

Remember these rules is only valid in a Vargr society. A human will have a hard 
time to prove herself, but when she gets the wheels turning, there might not be 
anything stopping her. Note that If the non Vargr character increases her 
Charisma above her original level it is returned to normal when interacting with
other non vargr characters or NPCs.


BRIBING VARGR

This may sound easy, but many has fallen into the trap, believing the Vargr 
nature is working for them. What they do forget is that do not oppose to the 
Charisma of the clerk in front of them, but the Charisma of his superior
officer or leader.

An example is maybe in order. Lets say an Vargr journalist is working on a 
special report, and need graded information from the police. Offering money for 
bribery is pointless. As for most human societies social status is measured by 
the wealth you got. This is not the case with Vargr. To a Vargr you have to 
offer increase in Charisma. Money is something that comes along. Money is not as
important for a Vargr as for most human cultures. Money is a tool nothing more 
nothing less. However money should be offered in the bribe, but the amount never
is large. Its just a small contribute for the service rendered. So the 
journalist must actually make up a case were he can prove that the police 
officer will increase in Charisma if the journalist is successfull in his 
investigation. Remember that Vargr are pack animals opposed to humans which are 
more invidiualistic. A Vargr will always view a certain action in the light of 
what the group will gain by that given action. Each individual Vargr always try 
to improve their status within a group. This sound contradictory, but viewed 
from the human point it is, but for the Vargr it makes sense. If the indiviual 
Vargr feels that he or she will gain Charisma to belong to that group it will be
loyal to it, and do whatever is in her power to increase the group Charisma. 
Going back to this journalist, he must convince the police officer that the 
whole department will gain by giving the information he needs. In most cases a 
person trying to bribe a Vargr only have to go up against the closest leader to 
the Vargr trying to be bribed.

The difficulty is such a bribery attempt is rarely easier than Difficult. If the
group leader of the opposition are of lower Charisma it might be easier. The 
difficulty level should also be adjusted to how the bribing player is arguing, 
and how he or she present the deal.

There is also possible to buy information on the street by Vargr. In these cases
money have more to say, when this kind of information is bought from Vargr that 
never are attached to a group over long period of time, and thus do not have the
neccessary group loyalty, except for its own day to day survival.

Friends:

	I\'ve a question, when the RCES equipment guide was origionally 
advertised in the backs of the other source books, it showed an interesting 
Heavy POWER armour derivative.  What became of that armour design, and Is 
it still possible to get a copy of the stats for it.  It seemed to me that 
a lot of the preliminary work had been completed however that aromour was 
not to be seen in the guide, why not??  Just a quick question.

Stay Frosty,

Ah, but the Imperial military is huge, and covers a vast amount of space.
Presumably they standardise everything. To start modifying every gun of
every soldier from the Rim to the Marches would be a *nightmare*, and would
take decades to fully implement. By contrast, the Solomani military is
smaller and more compact, and have a good reason for doing it in the first
place, (ie when they get around to conquering the universe :-) it\'ll make
life a bit easier).

Purely in the interests of the security, safety, and happiness of the
citizens. If you have any further questions or complaints, I\'m sure SolSec
will be more than happy to explain in detail. With force, if necessary.

OTOH, they could end up in a \'too many chiefs, not enough Indians\'
situation. It might be better to throw them all in at a pretty low rank,
with rapid promotions for the particularly talented ones.

I\'m sure there\'s more to JL\'s assassination than meets the eye.

I\'m not so sure. I would think that Terra would get *very* special
treatment from the occupying forces, (I mean, this is *Terra* for God\'s
sake!). Round-ups of collaborators etc would be handled *very* carefully,
so as not to offend the loyal citizens, and as much as possible it would
be a case of \'business as usual\' for most Terrans. Therefore there wouldn\'t
be much motivation for resistance, and if the remaining Marines were
offered decent treatment and quick repatriation, then they\'d have little
motivation to carry on fighting a war they\'d already lost. In addition,
Terra is a very high tech, high pop planet - it\'d be pretty hard to hide.

for the moment) to stop the Solomani Confederation from 
completely wiping the floor with them.  By 1130, the Imperium
has been conquered, and the New Rule of Man becomes the 
new order.  Of course, by 1140 the victorious Solomani start
turning on each other...so it\'s the Rebellion all over again...

OK, I admit it...I hate racism in all it\'s forms, but I just
can\'t help _identifying_ with the bloody Solomani!  I might
start up a campaign set in the Interstellar Wars, just so 
I can satisfy my primitive tribalism!

Actually, Persephone\'s on the Web, and at ghost.cc.missouri.edu. 
And I\'m waiting until my "World Tamer\'s Guide" comes in a week or two, 
before I start building worlds again, rather than interesting NPC\'s.

I _may_ also post a few more adventures... I can\'t squeese the time 
needed to do a professional write-up for my ideas, and I can\'t leave them 
to waste (I currently lack a gaming group, and always was a better

Mr. Myhre neglect\'s to mention that, with the Vargr stuff, is an 
impressive amount of material on Gurvorin (spell-check!) sector (the one 
just above the Spinward Marches).  Go and get it.  Now.

 There is a heavy TL12 battledress with a armour of 12 in the guide. That is
the armour (looking slightly japanese)in so many pictures. How heavy do
you want?.... Armour 12 is pretty heavy for TL12.  I recently played a 
striker game with a team of 5 TL12 heavy battledress Fireteams each carrying a 
Heavy MG.
Wow! They kicked butt.
       A  interesting side note is where does a "battledress" become a 
walking tank?
  I designed a TL12 walker with a crew of 2 , laser/miss launcher /heavy 
armour etc. At 54 cubic meters It is clearly not  battledress.  So what would you base a 
definition of battledress on size? agility?crew? cost? A  very interesting question.

Well how about _this_ alternative ending:

        Strephon does not loose his sense  of  will  in  1121,  but  is
        smuggled back to Capital by IRIS and publically confronts Lucan
        for  the  throne.  Lucan\'s  guards,  who  are  basically  loyal
        Imperial officers following whom they think is  the  legitimate
        Emperor, are unable to act and so refer the matter to the Moot.
        Given the recent history of Lucan\'s rule  the  Moot  fall  over
        themselves \'recognising\' Strephon\'s claim.

        Immediately hostilities cease between  the  core  Imperium  and
        Strephon\'s Stronghold which frees up a number  of  fleets  from
        both \'sides\' to go after Dulinor.

        Strephon  opens  negotiations  with   Daibei   and   Margaret\'s
        Stronghold to rejoin these factions to  the  Imperium  ...  all
        Lucan\'s demands for more ships are  cancelled.  These  factions
        are then free to turn all their fleets  to  repelling  Solomani
        incursions, and the core Imperium faction  has  then  freed  up
        more forces to use against Dulinor.

        A similar deal is offered to Antares.

        With the new Imperial reinforcements, together with  the  proof
        of Strephon\'s existance, Dulinor\'s forces collapse - thus
        \'ending\' the rebellion by about 1124.

        Apart  from  a  period  of  mopping  up  there   exists   three
        outstanding problems:

        1) What to do about the Ziru Sirkaa.  (Try to entice it back as
           an Autonomous Region?

        2) What steps to take to prevent a future recurrence:
           a) Strengthen/legitimise the position of IRIS.
           b) Weaken the powers of  the  throne  (introducing  many  of
              Dulinor\'s proposed reforms) and  moving  part  way  to  a
              republic.
           c) As soon as a successor can be agreed  upon,  Strephon  to
              abdicate.

        3) Long-term economic recession caused in part by  the  actions
           of the Megacorporations.  (Possible legislation  to  prevent
           future reoccurance ... leading to corporate tension  in  the
           post-Rebellion period.)

privately-run greed-orientated pirate/smugglers (often 
consisting solely of outcasts). Privateers are a clan-run 
unofficial navy (raiding rival clan shipping where enmity 
exists but a full-scale war has not been declared). This 
latter case is regarded by many clans as an honourable career 
equal to or exceeding a standard military career. Low Tech 
(Industrial or lower) Pirates are assumed to be aircraft or 
sea-vessel based.

True... but bu the Rebellion, Terra had a TL of 15.

Whay you\'d end up with is genuine feudalism, with a weak Solomani emperor

Well, yes.  Also, they have much more spirit than the Vilani or the Zhodani.
A much more interesting people, on the whole.

   In answer to your question: you pull your glove back out of the
civvy\'s head and look for a papertowel to wipe off all the goo.

   Many is the time I wanted to go out on the town in full battledress.
I can see the ads now...#you can drive in it, swim in it, even play tennis!
Now let#s see your tennis buddy return *that* backhand....#. Many worlds
would indeed ban certain types of battledress or place restrictions on
the extra strength, etc. suits can provide. You may even have instances
where you have both military and civilian models of the stuff (much like
you have selective fire weapons for the military and semi-auto versions
of the same weapon for civilians...or at least you used to....).

Striker has a conversion table in the back of the book. It is not 1 for 1 
for
ammo expenditures.  I believe autocanon ammo divided by 10 to get
shots. However striker also allows most inf. weapons to have unlimited
ammo for purposes of the basic game.

So who\'s talking about visual? I mentioned aldis as yet another way of
transmitting data like flags and radio. In the case of starships you\'d 
use radio, obviously. But the basic problem hasen\'t changed since the
days of flag communication.

Eh? More easily than transponder radio signals?

Exactly. Just like in the days of Nelson\'s navy. All it takes to make sure
you can\'t bluff your way in is to protect your codes and change them
regularily.

No, it takes someone with the right codes.

Yes. Of course, the article didn\'t explain how you prevented people from
programming their telemetry to feed false information to the transponder.
Face it, if it\'s electronic, it can be faked. (In this case: Put a small
trader in your warship\'s hold, kill your own transponder, and broadcast
the trader\'s signal. Instant deception (No doubt a few improvements on
the basic idea is needed to make it foolproof, but any ship that relies
on such transponder signals alone for positive identification is potential 
toast)).

Did you know that "threat" means different things to a civilian and to a
military man? The civilian think of threat as what your neighbour is
_likely_ to to. A friendly, smiling ex-boxer is no threat, he\'s a good guy. 
The military thinks of threat as what your neighbour _could_ do to you if 
he got mad. An ex-boxer is a threat. He _could_ punch your lights out if 
he wanted to. To the military ALL other governments are _potentially_ 
hostile. Some just have more potential than others ;-)

Exactly. You don\'t NEED those silly transponders at all. If your Virus is
magic, then it\'s magic. Why bother with those transponders when you still
have to make the Virus capable of taking over through any other kind of 
computer link too? There\'s way too many ships that would not have such a
transponder installed no matter what the Imperium decreed. I may be 
mistaken, but I think it is stated somewhere that the neighbours\' warships 
were also equipped with these transponders. :-P If I\'m mistaken then I 
certainly  -  well, I won\'t say I retract anything, but I\'ll certainly 
simmer down a lot. I\'ll see if I can\'t dig out the reference.

The thing about a black box is that _anything_ can be concealed inside it.
Worse, this is a black box that is constantly spouting coded radio signals.
You think about it a little and you\'ll see why a merchant wouldn\'t like to
have something like that mounted. Mind you, it would make a terrific 
secret (secret?) spy network for the Imperial Navy if the Solomani were 
stupid enough to allow it (And I bet the Megacorporations wouldn\'t mind all 
the juicy data they\'d get about their foreign business rivals either). So at 
most you would have some interface line ships mounting them. But the ships 
trading a few parsecs over the border? No way. And as for any military ship? 
Don\'t make me laugh.

Who said anything about agreeing with the other states? I think each of
would do it on their own. Flatly forbid any ship mounting such a secret
spy dingus from jumping into any of their systems.

   If it were pointed out to them that they were surrounded on all sides
by potentially hostile enemies (the Imperial spinward sectors, the
Imperial trailing and rimward sectors, and of course the Vargr), they
would doubtless capitulate.  If not, the war would be a very short one.

   a) Seeing as how they were only suppose to be a MegaTraveller
variant, never part of the actual storyline, it may be best for IRIS to
disappear.  The Brotherhood of Varian (which I believe is what it was
called) could serve the same function you had in mind.   b) I\'d have
to say that the powers of the throne were fatally weakened already,
unless Strephon is willing to hand power over immediately to a regent
until Norris arrives.  Even then Norris would have to agree to a laundry
list of limitations to his power.   c) Norris is the natural choice given the

   The megacorporations have been turned into regional businesses
as a result of the Rebellion.  Economic recovery would take many years
in any event.

Yes it could. It\'s not quite the impression one gets from reading about
it, but it could be. My point concerns something else: It\'s not that I
think the Terrans loved the Imperium so much (although, as I pointed out,
they love them enough for the Imperium to return civilian government) but
that they are going to HATE the newcomers much more. Someone else said
that Terra was special and rated special treatment. That\'s right! Terra
IS special, and rates special treatment. For one thing, Terra rates a
big say in running the Confederation. But do you think the Confederation
leaders on Home like that idea? Not unless they\'ve managed to breed a
whole new kind of politicians! (Now _that\'s_ a  challenge for GenAssist:
Develop a politician who care more for his charge than for his own power).
So how do you prevent that? Declare the whole planet lousy with "traitors".
The treatment that will cause them to deal out will make some Terrans
react, the Confederation will react to the reaction, and before you know
it the Terrans will be looking back to "The Good Old Days" under the
Imperium.

I\'m not saying that this is inevitable. A great statesman among the
Confederation leadership could easily handle things a lot better. But I
do say that my scenario is both possible and likely.

   To quietly make a very minor modification?  I think not--but let\'s say
for the sake of arguement it did take decades.  It\'s been quite a while
since the last Rim War (over a hundred as memory serves me correctly),
more than enough time for both sides to make mods to their magazines
and weapons several times over.

   The Solomani Army may be "smaller and more compact" in relation
to that of the  Imperium, but it isn\'t "small"  by any stretch of the
imagination.  Modifications would cost the Confederation government (or
in this case the government of the individual member-states) a nice
hunk of pocket change as well.  Money that, btw, would probably be
better spent on coming up with more effective munitions.  I agree,
making weapons that can fire both Imperial and Solomani bullets makes
a lot of sense, but getting into a game of mod-countermod just wastes
time and resources.

   As the frustration with Imperial raids and guerilla activity increased
(these are mentioned in TNS items), the methods of the occupying
forces would have become increasingly harsh.  That would have led
many Terrans to question whether having the Solomani on their planet
was such a good idea to begin with.  As has been stated previously,
it is very likely that the Terrans see themselves as different from other
Solomani--the occupation of their world makes the Terrans realize how
little they have in common with their supposed brethren.

   I doubt that any of the Imperial Marines were repatriated.  After the
Solomani suffered so many casualties in taking Terra, the first inclination
of their troops would be to cut down surrendering Imperial Marines
where they stood.  Being surrounded with no possibility of rescue and
facing an enemy not inclined to take prisoners, many of  the Imperial
Marines probably fought until they too exhausted  to continue were killed,
or managed to escape encirclement and retreat into the wilderness.
Remember as well the mission of the Imperial troops on Terra: delay
the Solomani as long as possible until Imperial resistance can get
organized (ironically a similar order was probably issued to Solomani
troops on Terra during the final days of the First Rim War.

   As for hiding on Terra, that would be easier than you think.  Remember
that initially, SolSec wouldn\'t have I.D. records for everyone on Terra.
They would have to rely on those created by the Imperial government.
It would have been easy to leave agents behind who have "legitimate"
Imperial identification identifying them as someone else.  What are the
Solomani going to do?  Run in-depth background investigation on 40+
billion people to make sure they are who they say they are?  Not even at
TL 15 would this be possible.  An Imperial Marine could ditch his
battledress, move to Phoenix, and claim to be Cleon Milbert, insurance
salesman from Cairo, Egypt, and have all the documentation he needs
to prove it.  Unless he looks and tests *very* Vilani or is a member of
a human minor race, the Solomani bureaucrat issuing out new I.D.s
wouldn\'t even give him a second thought, much less have SolSec follow
him around for a while.

   Assuming that the Booteans were a typical member-state of the
Solomani Confederation technologically speaking, then one could
presume (as I have) that the standard tech level of the Solomani 
Confederation Navy was TL 14.  This does not mean that there weren\'t
worlds within the Confederation that were higher-- just that for
standardization purposes the Navy settled on that figure (as the
Imperium settled on the TL 14 Trepida Grav Tank for its standard).
Where the Solomani had a definite advantage over the Imperium was in
medical technology, where they had a tech of around 16.  God help
the poor humans if vampire ships get their circuits on a TL 16
Solomani "instant baby" machine--post-production product
improvements would almost certainly result....

   In my analysis of the war, early on the primary Solomani advantage
wasn\'t that they had better quality, it was just that there were *so*
many of them, and they were better organized than their Imperial
counterparts.

   This was yet another reason that you never saw any serious attempt
by the Solomani to retake Terra prior to 1117.

   Remember who\'s running and designing much of the Imperial
military hardware of this era--people of pure, or more likely mixed
Solomani extract.  We do just fine in the future, IMHO.

>Alternatative history #133:  

   Interesting, but if the Solomani are so advanced, why did they wait
until a civil war in the Imperium before going on the offensive?  Surely
they had the power to do it long before then.

   Traveller was originally designed so that you could set up in whatever
era suited you best.  Eventually there got to be a running storyline
advancing the Third Imperium up through history, but it was never meant
that *everyone* had to do all of  their gaming, all the time in the Imperial
year 1109 or 1111 or 1117 or whatever.

 In the Megatraveller days Fusion and plasma guns were good penetration
short range weapons for space craft. Any ideas on why they changed this
in TNE?.  Any estimates on what the space modifier would be on Fusion
guns in FF& S for range?  I believe Megatraveller was *1000  in Kilometers.

Yes, just read the section in FF&S where it explains why Charged Particle 
Accelerators don\'t work in space. The same applies to Plasma and Fusion guns 
only more so. Also the velocity of the plasma is so low that a hit at space 
combat ranges is unlikely to say the least!

Subject: Mass Driver Guns

   I would like to know if any one else out there has attempted to design
mass driver guns using FF&S.  I\'ve put together a few designs myself
and believe I might have found a significant error in one of the formulas
that renders them inferior to CPR guns.  The potential error has to do
with the way the weight of mass driver projectiles is calculated.
If I\'m correct, MD guns do have much superior penetration to CPR guns,
but require huge amounts of energy to power them.

 ----

What is the potential problem you have discovered?
IMO MD\'s generally do have superior range and penetration compared with CPR 
guns but use phenomenal amounts of power to make them go. The total weapon 
system (gun+power supply+ammo) may however be more massive and expensive 
than a comparable CPR/ETC gun.

Lets see now can you all say Gvurrdon? Fine!

A full sett of Gvurrdon documents are also available from Sunbane. 
Most of them also from the web page to Goeran. I\'ll post the web 
address when I can find it, or maybe Goeran will do it himself.

I\'ll be updating some of the documents soon, but it will take some 
time.

For those of you who has been waiting for my updated HIWG document

Terra/Solomani Rim (1827 A867A69-F) Date: 081-1118
¶ Jeffery Long, formerly a reporter for the Phoenix Sun News
organization, surfaced today from SolSec, following his internment by
Imperial authorities nearly six years ago.
¶ Long claims that his work dealing with so-called hyperspace sickness
drew him into a ring of high-tech Imperial research and, ultimately,
to an Imperial jail cell, as well.
¶ "My findings will be published soon, I promise you," stated Long as
he was reunited with his family in Buenos Aires.

Terra/Solomani Rim (1827 A867A69-F) Date: 093-1118
¶ SolSec released today a communique stating that Jeffery Long,
recently freed from Imperial prison, has been murdered.
¶ "The hotel room where Mr. Long and his family were staying in Osaka
on their vacation was all but destroyed by a bomb. There were no
survivors."
¶ Though several staff members of the hotel are under investigation,
no charges are expected to be filed against them.
¶ "We cannot rule out the possibility that Imperial Intelligence
agents carried out this vicious crime against true humanity - the
technology of the bomb and its professional placement are very
suspicious," stated an anonymous source in the local district
attorney\'s office.

Terra/Solomani Rim (1827 A867A69-F) Date: 123-1118
¶ From notes gathered from the wreckage of the hotel room where
Jeffery Long and his family were murdered earlier this year, his
publisher has produced and released a draft of his works entitled _The
Hyperspace Web_.
¶ In it, Long\'s notes suggest that he was jailed by Imperial
authorities when his investigative work, into the problems and
mysteries of hyperspace sickness, was becoming uncomfortable to naval
researchers. 
¶ It states that popularized research into the sickness was getting
dangerously close to research facilities the Imperial Navy had working
on breaking the jump-6 barrier.

The TNS used to be an Imperium-wide benefit blah blah blah.

Another possible assassination attempt on a prominent Solomani radical
is the mysterious grav vehicle accident that almost killed Joshua
Dahvin on 043-1122. Dahvin was head of the liberal wing of the Party
and a former Minister of Economics, who spoke out against the tendency
to centralization in the government of the time and advocated
citizenship for all sophonts in the Confederation. Shortly before his
"accident" (168-1121) he had made some public remarks which SolSec
called "desperate ravings" and a "clear dalliance with seditious
intent".

You never know.  Dave Nilsen wrote the article on Imperial Marine
uniforms that appeared in Traveller Digest #14, covering everything
from field gear to full dress.  It also mentioned a JIS ("Joint
Imperial Services") standard for officers\' rank insignia that would
presumably apply to IA and IN uniforms also.  In TD #9 there\'s also
an article on the Imperial Guard with a page of art showing the
basic uniforms they use.  And DGP\'s _World Builder\'s Guide_ has plenty
of art showing the IISS field duty uniform.  It\'s a TL15 tailored 
vacc suit, with zippered pockets on the right breast and right thigh,
the IISS crest on the right shoulder, field office patch on the
left shoulder, with a tape that probably has ship assignment on it
under that, and a red Imperial Sunburst on the left breast.  The
IISS crest and field office patches can be seen in detail on page
seven.  (They\'re not in color, but we know that the IISS prefers to 
use the Sunburst in red, from _Imperial Encyclopedia_.)  A levanex 
cloth utility vest, also with Sunburst on the left breast, is optional, 
and one illustration shows a cap that has the poni-and-circle design
on the front.

I got the impression that it isn\'t *courage* that Hivers lack, it\'s
that they really really don\'t like close-in violence.  I can see a
Hiver climbing out on a limb over a precipitous drop to get a better
view of an interesting archeological site or plant, but when it comes
to hand-to-hand combat, they call in the Marines.  After all, the
Hiver are going out into the Wilds, aren\'t they?

They aren\'t as pacifistic as the Virushi, as far as I can tell.  
Hivers just like to keep violence at arm\'s length.  Hivers will use 
nuclear warheads; they prefer to deal in violence at long ranges.

That\'s because, (by about 1110, anyway), the Solomani hadn\'t reached TL15,
(I think only Imperial or Hiver worlds are allowed TLs of 15+).

IIRC, Solomani Medical TL is 16, most other areas are 13-14. In my
universe, they reached TL15 round about 1115, (mostly through stealing
Imperial stuff).

I know exactly what you mean. Maybe it\'s because we *are* Solomani?

Agreed. I think they\'d prefer somewhere like Luna or Mars. When on Terra,
they\'d generally stick to their own buildings (eg Vegan Embassy) where they
could have grav plates in the floor.

Apart from that article on the IMGT in TD#??, I don\'t remember ever seeing

The colour pix in the RCEG also show horizontal bars on the shoulder pads
- since at least one guy has two and most of the others have one, I\'d guess
this is rank.

Plus, of course, if the guy in BD decides to do something naughty, it\'s
hard for the local police to do anything about it without taking out half
the city.

I usually make BD illegal without a permit, and CA gets a lot of suspicious

It is a bit of a dilemma - not recapturing Terra would have been political
suicide, as would nuking it, butchering millions of pure Solomani (as pure
as you can get!), etc. OTOH, once you\'ve *got* Terra, what\'re you going
to *do* with it?

  > I doubt that any of the Imperial Marines were repatriated.  
  
I said it was *offered*, not that it actually happened, although I think
it probably did. POWs - particularly injured ones - take a lot of resources
to look after. In addition, ISTR reading something about this somewhere,
(although it may have been referring to mercs).

I always assumed that the Confederation military - and the Navy in
particular - were more standardised than the Imperium. The Imperial Navy
was about TL12-15, whereas I see the SCN as being 13-14.

One big advantage was that the Imperial forces were pretty confused and
demoralised - Strephon was dead, the Imperium was ripping itself apart,
and nobody really knew what the hell was going on. In addition, in the
past, the Imperium could always rely on reinforcements - this time, there
weren\'t any.

   Not exactly.  For one, he wasn#t from Louisiana. :-)  Jeffery Long 
was the subject of a series of three TNS news bulletins, and if I#m
remembering correctly was mentioned as a NPC in an adventure.  His 
cover was that he was a reporter, but Imperial authorities found out 
better and put him in prison for spying.  He was released when the
Solomani captured Terra, but was killed soon after by Imperial agents.
The official reason he was jailed had to do with his poking around
Naval research facilities related to breaking the jump-6 barrier,
but I think there was a lot more to it than that.

   Anyone know the full Jeffery Long story, or is it one of those
#adventure hooks# you were suppose to make up your own answer to?

Hans Rancke writes about transponders:

>>The problem with straight radio communication is that radio
>>transmissions can be intercepted
>
>Eh? More easily than transponder radio signals?

   Actually, yes.  The frequency at which transponders broadcast
would be a closely guarded naval secret.  Communications bands much
less so.

>No, it takes someone with the right codes.

   Normally, yes.  But as has been proven in the past, if you can
pretend to be someone else well enough, people will believe you.
Having coded transponders takes the human fallibility (or gullibility)
out of the process.  Fake someone out by having a merchant vessel
in your hold?  Perhaps in wartime.  It would probably work too, the
first few times.  Eventually the bad guys would figure out what you
were up to and blow you out of space.

>Face it, if it\'s electronic, it can be faked. 

   And if its human it can be faked out.  All depends on how much
faith you put in your people and in your equipment.  Apparently the
Imperium put some faith in the former, and a bit too much in the 
latter.  Ideally you would use a combination of human and transponder.
In wartime, this would be critical.

>You don\'t NEED those silly transponders at all. If your Virus is 
>magic, then it\'s magic. 

   The transponders are what literary types call a #plot device#.
They help explain why it is that the Virus gets to be interstellar
in scope (its rapid, prolific spread is explained through other
plot devices).  Either you buy off on the concept or you don#t.
Some people think that matter transport is #magic# (among other
things) and don#t buy off on the whole Star Trek concept because
of it.  Some people feel the same way about the Force in Star Wars.
I can explain to you why I think it works, but that#s all I can do.
If you don#t buy my explanation, you don#t, and I can#t make you
believe in it.

>I may be  mistaken, but I think it is stated somewhere that the
>neighbours\' warships  were also equipped with these transponders.
:-P

   Use of the transponders was extensive in Known Space.  I don#t
recall whether or not non-Imperial, non-Solomani warships used it,
but if they did, they probably used their own #homegrown# version
of it.

>The thing about a black box is that _anything_ can be concealed

   This fact doesn#t stop black boxes from being mounted in
practically every airliner used on Earth.  Do you honestly believe
that Lufthaunsa (or any other major airline) could get away with 
deciding not to cooperate?

>Who said anything about agreeing with the other states? I think each

   The transponders were shared technology.  The Imperium went to
other governments said, #OK, here it is, this is what it does.#
Of course they would want the black box ripped open and thoroughly
analyzed.  They would probably insist that they make their own.
The Imperium would agree, provided that their version broadcast
on the proper frequency while in the Imperium. That would be that.

   If it were pointed out to them that they were surrounded on all 
sides by potentially hostile enemies (the Imperial spinward sectors, 
the Imperial trailing and rimward sectors, and of course the Vargr),
they would doubtless capitulate.  If not, the war would be a very 
short one.

   a) Seeing as how they were only suppose to be a MegaTraveller
variant, never part of the actual storyline, it may be best for IRIS to
disappear.  The Brotherhood of Varian (which I believe is what it was
called) could serve the same function you had in mind.   

   b) I\'d have to say that the powers of the throne were fatally 
weakened already, unless Strephon is willing to hand power over
immediately to a regent until Norris arrives.  Even then Norris would
have to agree to a laundry list of limitations to his power.   

   c) Norris is the natural choice given the circumstances.

   The megacorporations have been turned into regional businesses as a
result of the Rebellion.  Economic recovery would take many years in
any event.


Hans Rancke also writes about Terra and the Solomani:

   Given a choice, after 13 years of Solomani occupation, the Terrans 
may have begun to wish that everyone would just leave them alone--
but at the same time, most of them would have also realized that was 
impossible.  Terra was just too significant to both sides just to
let it go an independent course.

>Someone else said that Terra was special and rated special treatment.
>That\'s right! Terra IS special, and rates special treatment. For one

>think the Confederation leaders on Home like that idea? 

   This is true, except that remember where many of those leaders
on Home came from Terra (of course).  The situation would be very
analogous to that faced by Taiwan.  Ruled by leaders that were
kicked off the mainland by the Communists, These same leaders and
their successors refuse to even consider the possibility of declaring
their island independent--because that would mean giving up their claim
to be the legitimate government of all of China.

   The leaders on Home made a beeline to Terra as soon as it fell.
When they realized that Terra was too close to the front for comfort
(reinforced by an Imperial raid or two, no doubt), they decided not
to transfer the capital back there until hostilities had ceased.
Unfortunately for the Solomani, the Collapse occurred before that
happened.


Django Upton says regarding mass drivers:

>What is the potential problem you have discovered?

   See below.

>IMO MD\'s generally do have superior range and penetration compared
>with CPR  guns but use phenomenal amounts of power to make them
go. >The total weapon  system (gun+power supply+ammo) may

gun.

   My point exactly.  OK, here#s what#s wrong (Loren, please send
this information along to Dave and Frank):

   The formula for determining the weight of a gauss weapon round
(any mass driver with a bore diameter below 20 mm) is as follows:

   (3.1416 times radius cubed) times .02

   The formula for determining the weight of a mass driver round
(any mass driver with a bore diameter 20 mm and above) is:

   (3.1416 times radius cubed) times .1

   Why should you care if mass driver rounds are so much heavier
than their gauss weapon (and CPR gun) counterparts?  Because the
weight of the round is used in calculating the energy requirements
of the gun.

   I pinned down the weight of the round as a culprit by designing
two weapons, one using the mass driver design sequence, the other
using the gauss weapon design sequence.  Both guns were designed
to be 20 mm.  Without question the gauss weapon consumed less
energy--power requirement for the mass driver was a hefty 4 Mw.

   The official explanation from GDW on the subject has been that
mass driver rounds have a different aspect ratio than a typical
gauss weapon (this makes mass driver rounds heavier, since they
are longer).  While this may be the case, the difference in
aspect ratios is too severe.  I purpose the following formula
to calculate the mass of mass driver rounds:

   (3.1416 times radius cubed) times .06

This will correct the problem and make mass drivers a weapon
that people want to use for anti-tank applications, instead
of an ignored design sequence that is rarely used.

they were (before the Chaos) in possession of the highest tech level in known

were also well known for the Star Trigger (once a bluff, but later very
real). 
 That kept their stronger enemies at bay.  (Keep your enemies close -- If I 
remember right, there were both Imperial and Zhdant bases within the 
Confederation.)  Their weaker enemies, a much greater threat, were the Sword 
Worlds and the Belgardians.

I got the impression that these inquisitive folk were more interested going 
their own way than getting directly involved with interstellar politics.  
Though they were doubtlessly very involved behind the scenes.  (Case in point
-- As long as the Frontier Wars kept everyone busy, nobody\'s going to notice 
us.)

The problems come in when you notice that the Special Branch was very well 
hidden.  The main installation with its high TL ships was, as I understand
the documentation, never discovered.  This leads to some interesting possibilities 
when you remember that Grandfather had a lot of involvement in the Darrian\'s 
development.  (Pocket universes and jump gates come to mind, but I was careful 
to only hint at those in my campaigns.)  (One of twentieth-century American 
Ranger tenants was that "it\'s okay to lie to anyone about what we do -- except 
your superiors" -- Gray\'s Commandoes.)

What happened to them during and after the rebellion?

I could see the Confederation fall, but that would lead to the question: What
happened to the Spacial Branch Fleet?

If they survived, (They recovered after the first Star Trigger event), have 
they recovered their earlier tech level?

<And about a bijillion other scenarios.>

Has anyone else worked on the Darrians since 1120?  I\'d like some input.

  One of my first thoughts on reading TNE was "Gosh, wouldn\'t it be fun to
let
Virus get the Star Trigger?"  Sure, it\'s a one-use effect (since all Virus in
the region would be destroyed on activation), but it would set the Darrians
back again (and all of the nearby empires), on top of Virus damage.

  I always liked the Darrians...  Plenty of enemies, which means plenty of
jobs
for non-Darrians to carry out for the Darrian gov\'t and citizens.  And plenty
of scientific and exploratory jobs (I also liked the Hivers quite a bit for
the
same reasons).  And they made good enemies as well as patrons, if you had
something they needed or that threatened them.

  They\'ve had a lot of practice building back up from disasters, so they\'d
probably be, like the Hivers, the "patrons" of their region of space.  I
doubt
their intentions are quite as benign, though - this would be a good
opportunity
to pacify their old enemies once and for all by taking control while they
can\'t
fight back...  The Sword Worlds should make a good addition to the
Confederation.  If not, they can make sure they never get off-planet again.

  They\'d also provide a good excuse for really high-tech stuff.  Hmn.  I just
finished reading "Eternity" (the sequel to "Eon"), and it would be
interesting
to have the Darrians move in that direction (an entire race of radical
Geshels
would be entertaining and as alien as you can get...)

   Well actually no one *needs* battledress, as all that anyone really
*needs*  is clothes, food, transportation, a safe place to live, and
medical treatment should they become ill.  As to *why* a civilian would
want battledress, the reasons vary.  Some people might collect it as a
hobby (like people collect suits of armor); some might be military
enthusiasts who always thought the Imperial Marines looked neat, and
wanted to look like them; others might be historical re-enactors who
want a suit so that they can go out with their buddies and recreate the
Second Battle of Akiikharii (or whatever); some people might be
concerned about threats they have been receiving and want the extra
protection (and have the money to buy it).  Battledress is not a practical
item, people want it because it is *battledress*, and it has a certain aura
about it.  The same type of people who buy it buy old Sherman tanks,
P-51 Mustangs, Springfield rifled muskets, or German Lugers.  If they
were being practical, they\'d buy something else.

   This relates to what I\'ve been talking about--the only thing that all
Solomani could agree on was the recapture of Terra--once that was
accomplished, the various factions couldn\'t agree about what to do next.
It was almost as though it happened too easily.  The conservatives
had their way for a time directing war policy, but after several
disasters on the front, the conservatives lost the support of the
moderates, and the situation became increasing chaotic.

   I don\'t recall any such exchange of prisoners between the Solomani
and the Imperials.  It is good policy to take good care of POWs
(with the understanding your enemy will do the same), injured or
otherwise.  My presumption was that the Solomani took few Imperial
prisoners to start with on Terra, for the reasons I outlined.

> Wilderness? On Terra?

   Vast stretches of tropical rain forest still exist (or were recreated)
on Terra in the Amazon river valley and the Congo region.  Other
forested regions exist in North America and presumably elsewhere.
\'Wilderness\' can also refer to the desert as well.  No one said they all
had to hide out in Los Angeles (sorry, bad \'A-Team\' reference), though
the cities too would have provided a place for them to disappear.

   The Imperial and Solomani Navy were probably both equally
standardized.  First-line Imperial craft being TL 15, second line being
early TL 15 to late TL 14 (with TL 15 add-ons), and the reserve fleets
being TL 14.  System fleets would run the gambit from TL 9 to TL 16.
Solomani first-line would have been late TL 14 (with a few ships with
TL 15 add-ons), with the second line and reserves also being TL 14
with some TL 13 squadrons used in "quiet" areas.  System (and
member-state) fleets would vary from TL 9 to TL 15.

   F.Y.I. (no quiz this week, I have enough stuff to grade....):

   Gokhman, Boris (1056 - 1139).  Admiral, later Archduke of Sol (1121).
Commander of the Imperial Rim Fleet from 1115-1130.  Founder of the
Rim Concordat (q.v.).  First Regent of Dingir (1130 - 1139).  The
Archduke is most noted for his dramatic victory at the First Battle of
Dingir (q.v.) during the Second Solomani Rim War.  His decision to
pull together loyal forces from Terra and  Prometheus  and use them
to reinforce the 115th Fleet under Admiral Tania Yau led to the stunning
Imperial victory in that battle.  He went on to orchestrate the defense of
the Imperial stonghold surrounding the Vegan Autonomous District,
despite facing a superior foe and at times contradictory orders from
Capital.  Finally cut off from the Imperial core, he organized the region
under his direct command into a cantonment and began negotiating a
peace treaty with the Solomani Confederation.  These negotiations
were about to reach fruition when the Collapse occurred.  After the
Collapse, he served as provisional leader of the government of Dingir.
While in that post, he provided strong leadership and was able to keep
the various factions of that world from falling into civil war.  He was
succeeded by Tania Yau (q.v.), who also took the titles of Regent of
Dingir and  Archduke of Sol.

I think the reasoning would depend on what you define as "battledress".
If you use a strict definition of it being a suit of heavy armor built
around a powered exoskeleton with other built-in enhancements, then
said civilian is going to need to do some fast talking to the local
authorities.
   However, if you use a somewhat broader definition that is alluded to
in some of the equipment info, then there are some valid reasons.  This
definition just uses the powered exoskeleton part.  An example of a
"plausible" situation might be a high grav world where the mechanical
assistance of the exoskeleton is a neccessity.  If the world also has a
corrosive or insidious atmosphere, you then need to plate it a bit with
some armor to keep the atmosphere out.  There are also examples of
powered exoskeletons being used as "cargo-handlers" (a la _Aliens_),
such as the "Baby Brute" Light BRT from the RC Equip. Guide.

Of course, coming in late, I could have missed the entire point of the
original question and be completely off base. :)

Just finished reading The Death of Wisdom (DOW) this weekend, so I 
thought I\'d give folks a brief review.  I\'ve included some info about 
plot elements, so if you like to be surprised, stop reading now.

Paul Brunette, _The Death of Wisdom_, GDW Press, ISBN 1-55878-181-1, 352 
pages, 1995, $5.95.

DOW is the first volume of a trilogy, and is set in the Reformation 
Coalition.  Action centers around the crew of an upgraded Far Trader 
(good old Empress Marava class), assigned initially to a routine training 
mission.  In the course of the mission, they discover an outbreak of a 
Black War-style biovirus which attacks and kills Hivers.  The crew then 
travels into the Wilds to find the source of the virus and destroy it.

Is it worth reading?  The answer is a resounding maybe.  Fans of the 
Reformation Coalition and the whole New Era setting will enjoy the book, 
anybody else can skip it without regret.

Before going further, I should point out that I am a real fan of what GDW 
has done with The New Era - I like the whole idea of the reformation 
coalition, and I prefer it to Megatraveller.  That said, I still have 
reservations about the book.

First of all, the quality of the writing is extremely pedestrian.  I 
don\'t know what else Brunette has written, but this book demonstrates 
that he\'s no master craftsman.  I know I shouldn\'t expect much, but 
compared to the _Dark Conspiracy_ trilogy that GDW put out a few years 
ago (the first novel had a dynamite introduction where the hero wakes up 
in a bodybag and has to escape before he is dissected), or to the 
Paranoia novels released by West End, DOW is filled with flat dialogue, 
dull descriptions, and characters who are more cardboard-cutoutlike than 
is usual for science fiction.  

Brunette does use a lot more female characters for ship\'s crew than I\'ve
seen in the Traveller games I\'ve run, so that might strike you as odd, but
it is a nice touch.  On the other hand, he constantly describes hardware
in terms of whatever tech level it is.  It looks to me like he just went
through the Equipment Guide and made sure one of everything showed up. 
This is handy if you want to use the book as a sourcebook, but I very much
doubt if people in the Traveller universe would really talk this way. 
Frankly, it\'s books like this that made me stop reading popular fiction
and turn to classic literature and history. 

On the other hand, the plot is interesting, though not very complex.  The 
descriptions of space combat are also fairly good, though since I\'m not a 
FF&S expert I\'ll defer judgement to someone else.  Frankly, this whole 
thing would make a better module than a novel.

One thing I didn\'t like is than everyone, and I do mean everyone, is
stupider than the player characters, oh sorry, crew of the ship.  If the
Merchant Guild is really as stupid as they are in the book, the RC will
have control of the Operation Area in five years or less, just like they 
plan to.

Anyway, overall I give the book a C-.  It\'s interesting for plot ideas 
and descriptions for some of the planets in the RC and nearby, but as a 
work of literature it\'s not too great.  Unless you are an RC fan, save 
your money.

One last note.  The Hiver in the book is not very courageous in the 
conventional sense.  He travels on a rather lightly armed and armored 
starship, which is probably courageous for a Hiver, but he doesn\'t put on 
combat armor and charge a grav tank or anything like that.  Actually, I 
suspect he is the one responsible for the outbreak of the biovirus among 
the Hiver - there are several clues in the novel that point that way.  I 
think he was using the outbreak to push the RC and the Hiver Federation 
closer together, and in 100 years he\'ll be hailed as a hero.  Never did 
like those Hiver, except with special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, 
onions on a sesame seed bun.

By the way, I\'d be interested to know who other folks select as their 
favorite character in the book.  I like Vega Zorn - I\'ll leave it as an 
exercise to guess why.

and I now tell him what I myself was told - this is like saying that
modern Danes would have a natural affinity for raiding the coastlines
of surrouding countries, because their Danish Viking ancestors had a
"lot of practice" doing it. The Maghiz happened _millenia_ before the
"present" of CT/MT/TNE. Probably the vast majority of Darrians learn
about the Maghiz the way we on Earth learn about the fall of Rome, as
a blip (but an important one) in a history class. ("And then there was
the Maghiz, which removed our ability to produce the latest generation
of spare parts for our grav cities, and forced the capital to be moved
to Mire...")

I agree that they might have detailed files in their data archives on
what was done to pick up the pieces after the Maghiz, but that isn\'t
quite the same as being the "natural patrons" for their area of space.

I also kind of doubt that the Darrians would use something like the
Collapse to "settle old scores" in an antagonistic way. Now,
incorporating them as equals into a new "Greater Darrian" culture I
could see - the concept of the small group helping a larger, more
backward one to achieve great things is also a prominent concept in
their history.

Yep!  My point exactly.  You can find all sorts of really
odd things in the Congressional Record; it makes a
wonderful resource for making up future societies,
religions or governments.  Take some of the proposals
from the Congress and push them to their logical 
conclusions (whether you agree with them or not).  I 
have even had luck doing this with extremist political
viewpoints and extremist religious beliefs.

  No, you completely misunderstood me.  I put it in anthrompomorphic terms (as
"they\'ve had a lot of practice"), but the point is that they\'ve dealt with a
very similar disaster before, and made a more decentralized society.  If the
Danes still had their original culture (as the Darrians do; most SF cultures
are amazingly monolithic and unchanging - who has time to make a thousand
constantly changing alien cultures?) and the English were still defenseless, I
suspect they WOULD be damn good at raiding the English coastlines.

  The Chaos did a bit more than that to them.  They lost essentially everything,
and were left with just the knowledge that it could be done.  Would this leave
a permanent mark on them?  In our world, possibly not.  In Trav (and almost all
SF literature), absolutely.

  The "natural patrons" is based on their psychology more than anything else.
That they\'d likely be the first in their area to recover is just icing on the
cake.

  Again, you misunderstood.  That\'s not antogonism, that\'s practical.  If your
old enemies are weak, and you\'re strong, some people would take the chance to
victimize them.  Others would take the chance to assimilate them if possible or
make sure they\'re not a threat if it\'s not possible.  And fools take the chance
to give their old enemies all of the technology they need to be a danger again.

Some points I have to make:

1) Knowing human nature, there must have been some resistance movement.
There\'s always a resistance movement. I mean, c\'mon, this is Terra - Terrans
love their individuality - the 3rd. Imperium represent a threat to that
individuality. And the Terran Rebels gotta have guts ...

2) Status Quo - First of all, Joe Citizen, although loathing the Imperium,
probably would try to stay in line - after all, there is the threat of the
Imperial Marines. Second of all, marriage between Imperial Marines and
Terrans would be looked down upon by the Terrans - it\'s sleeping with the
enemy.

3) Solomani Occupation - The Solomani would treat Terra special - it\'s the
homeworld. They gotta have SOME respect for the Solomani Homeworld.

Rim War.  If the Confederation was like most other totalitarian
states, individualism and freedom of expression would not
have been highly thought of, or even tolerated in many cases.
The Confederation in my campaign bears a strong resemblance to 
the old Soviet Union (between 1960 and 1985).

Power in the Confederation (as in the USSR) would rest on three
pillars:  the Party, the secret police and the military.  It is 
in the interests of each group to ensure that no group dominates.
When one gets too strong, the other two combine to pull it 
down (e.g. the CPSU and Red Army join forces to destroy Lavrentiy
Beria and his NKVD following Stalin\'s death.  The NKVD is split
and weakened - one part goes to the military and becomes the GRU
while the other part becomes the KGB).  Like in the USSR, this 
may have the following effects:

1/  Lack of initiative amongst field commanders.  The invasion
    of the Imperium followed a set plan, where every commander
    knew exactly what he must do.  As soon as events began to 
    deviate from this plan, commanders had to refer to their
    superiors for instructions.  The Imperial forces are 
    analogous to the NATO armies, in that much greater emphasis
    was placed on individual initiative.  Imperial commanders
    were almost always quicker to react than their Solomani 
    counterparts.  Furthermore, by specificly targeting and 
    destroying Solomani command, control and communications 
    assets, they were able to regain the initiative and hold 
    the Solomani.

2/  Political control of military commanders.  Every Solomani
    unit and ship had it\'s political officer.  His role was 
    to monitor the reliability of Solomani soldiers and 
    commanders.  He would have had the effect of further 
    reducing the initiative ability of individual commanders.

When such a culture is deeply entrenched, it\'s hard to alter.  
Even after 1125, when vicious infighting caused the Solomani
Party and SolSec to give the Navy a freer reign, they still 
found the going tough.  Despite some outstanding individual 
performances, the Solomani still had too few commanders 
capable of thinking independently and seizing the advantage
of the moment.

Striker has a conversion table in the back of the book. It is not 1 for 1 
for
ammo expenditures.  I believe autocanon ammo divided by 10 to get
shots. However striker also allows most inf. weapons to have unlimited
ammo for purposes of the basic game.
 ----

Oops, I meant 1 SHOT per turn or per dice. The table you refer to converts 
rounds to "shots".
This has evidently confused you sufficiently for you to ignore my question 
and instead tell me stuff I already know.
The problem is as follows:
 - Striker II uses different numbers of dice rolled for hits at different 
ranges.
 - Weapons will fire the same number of rounds at a target regardless of 
range
 - In Command Decision (which most of Striker II\'s rules came from) 1 shot is 
used per ROF to hit attempt.
 - If the interpretation is as CD then at least one of the vehicles presented 
in Striker II doesn\'t carry enough ammo for even 1 turn of fire at close 
range with it\'s main armament.
 - The rules for ammo use for infantry heavy weapons refers to turns of fire, 
NOT dice rolled.
 - The rules of Striker II are totally unclear as to what is intended.

Again there is an appendix in the back to convert TNE to striker. |There is
a chart (that is hard to understand) about ROF on the first page of the

You can use the chart to convert TNE ROF to Striker ROF

Again you missed the point!
The chart you refer to does not have a position for any vehicle weapon with 
ROF=4.
It does have:
TNE ROF (5 or 10 handheld), all 3 = Striker II ROF 4
TNE ROF 5 fixed = Striker II ROF 5

gun.

   My point exactly.  OK, here#s what#s wrong (Loren, please send
this information along to Dave and Frank):

   The formula for determining the weight of a gauss weapon round
(any mass driver with a bore diameter below 20 mm) is as follows:

   (3.1416 times radius cubed) times .02

   The formula for determining the weight of a mass driver round
(any mass driver with a bore diameter 20 mm and above) is:

   (3.1416 times radius cubed) times .1

   Why should you care if mass driver rounds are so much heavier
than their gauss weapon (and CPR gun) counterparts?  Because the
weight of the round is used in calculating the energy requirements
of the gun.
 ----

It is also used in calculating the muzzle energy which is used to determine 
the penetration of KE rounds. The above formula produces rounds which are a 
bit heavier than CPR/ETC rounds of the same bore. If you don\'t like the 
energy requirement then build a smaller bore mass driver!

 ----
   I pinned down the weight of the round as a culprit by designing
two weapons, one using the mass driver design sequence, the other
using the gauss weapon design sequence.  Both guns were designed
to be 20 mm.  Without question the gauss weapon consumed less
energy--power requirement for the mass driver was a hefty 4 Mw.

   The official explanation from GDW on the subject has been that
mass driver rounds have a different aspect ratio than a typical
gauss weapon (this makes mass driver rounds heavier, since they
are longer).  While this may be the case, the difference in
aspect ratios is too severe.  I purpose the following formula
to calculate the mass of mass driver rounds:

   (3.1416 times radius cubed) times .06

This will correct the problem and make mass drivers a weapon
that people want to use for anti-tank applications, instead
of an ignored design sequence that is rarely used.
 ----

The above will not change the performance of a KE round propelled buy a 
given energy input in the slightest. The energy requirement is DIRECTLY 
proportional to the muzzle energy of the MD which determines the KE 
penetration. The above change will require a larger bore weapon which will 
improve the performance of other ammo types but will require greater storage 
volume for the ammo.

BTW have you tried making an explosive power generation system part of your 
MD design. That way your MD rounds arrive with their power plants attached. 
Also you can probably use the MD\'s HPG as the EPG\'s HPG thus saving a bit of 
(mass/vol/Cr). Maybe Loren would like to comment on this?

Nor do you have to. I agree completely. If you define a new physical
effect or mechanical dingus then I should accept the explanation as a
ground rule (Provided, of course, that there are no glaringly obvious
corrolaries that you have missed). But when you tell me about how an
_existing_ factor works, then you damn well better be realistic. In
this case I\'m talking about human nature (Or government nature ;-).

Two things: Everyone knows what\'s inside one of those black boxes. Secondly:
You\'re turning the example the wrong way round. Imagine that no such boxes
existed and that the US suddenly announced that no planes would be allowed
inside the US without such a box, made and sold by an American firm, sealed
and not to be opened by anyone else. They\'d have a perfect right to do so,
of course. But I think many other nations would inform the US that in that
case no US planes would be allowed inside their airspace until further
notice.

You mean the Imperium told all its neighbours how to make those things?
In that case they also learned how to fake them. Kinda ruins the whole

Not Exactly... theyr is a system (Samquis?) in Antares sector, inhabited 
by a civilization of self-repairing robots at TL 17, which is the 
highest-known TL in Imperial Space (or anywhere else, excepting 
Grandfather\'s little hideout over Lair).

Nothing much during the Rebellion, except grabbing a few worlds back from 
the Sword Worlders.

They still exist whole in the New Era: The Zhodani have gained no new 
worlds, while the Regency is growing quite nicely, esp in M-P sectors.
The Sword Worlders have blown up into four fragments, each centred on a 
major world, except the trailing systems: they are either Regency 
territiory (if they have a pop of "0" ) or allied with the Regency.

No information in the files: they _may_ be at TL D, if their TL was 
kicked up one level like everyone else (except the Zhodani).

A PURELY PERSONAL RANT FOLLOWS.
When GDW indicated they were interested in authors for Traveller novels a
year or more back, I applied, having just written a complete novel based
around a Traveller hijack played between two groups of players in about
1989. The main character is a well thought-through female smuggler who turns
mercenary, the plot is quite complex with more than one mean
twist-in-the-tail, the characters are realistic (because the interplay and
characteristics are based on the actual game play), a substantial amount of
authentic Traveller equipment, background, etc. is mentioned (although the
novel is set in a subsector generated by myself placed at the junction of
the Domain, Vargr and Zhodani spaces). I felt well-placed: (a) as a writer
of huge amounts of technical, RPG and sci-fi literature (the last on an
amateur basis), and (b) as a long-standing player (17 years) of Traveller...
to write a novel that would appeal to both Traveller-players and a general
sci-fi audience.

GDW weren\'t interested. I can only guess (from their half-year slow
response, losing of my first submission, eventual token 3-line reply letter,
etc.) that they were only interested in stories which advertise their new
TNE setting. Bingo, if I\'d only had the RCES manual, copied out a few pages
and talked about the Virus a bit, I wonder how much better I might have been
received... IM(very)HO, plot was not high on their requirements list.
Judging by their current financial state, GDW was probably willing to accept
anyone as long as they worked for peanuts. ;-)

Oh, and if anyone thinks I just can\'t write, the novel has been reviewed and
highly praised by a professional writer. Incidentally, when I mention "I"
above, I must of course qualify this by saying that I ran the original game
but my wife played the heroine character and wrote substantial sections of
the book. Further, we\'re onto book 2. Book 1 is with an agent and hopefully
will eventually get into print with a few minor alterations to avoid GDW\'s
petty copyright crap. If it ever gets published I\'ll notify the list and
maybe Mark can review my book as well. :-)

Naturally all comments in this message are personal rants at having been
rejected by GDW and I have neither read (nor intend to waste my money) on
any novels produced in a blatant (and lame) attempt to drum up more
customers for GDW\'s RPG products.

NO DOUBT someone will flame me for this. If so, please send to my personal
e-mail address rather than irritating other users of the traveller mailing

A RICE paper is a full-blown TML description/travelogue of a Regency world.

Yep: however, you should remember a few things...

A) It\'s very likely that the Imperium send it\'s best, most able nobles to 
   govern Terra.  This implies that the Imperium didn\'t treat Terra like 
   the British treated Ireland, but instead did it\'s best to address 
   Terran concern\'s within the Imperial framework.  Even with 
   ultra-competent government, it still took over half a century before 
   civilian government could be restored

B) Where would the Terran Rebels get their equipment from?  Who\'s funding 
   them?  The Solomani Govt. had an "understanding" with the Imperium, 
   precluding that avenue.  And the Imperium would, again, send to Terra 
   the very best anti-terrorist groups that 11,000 worlds can provide.  

C) The Imperium would most certainly respect the Terran need for 
   individuality... not to do so would be mistreating this very valuable 
   prize, not only creating tension on the border but political unrest 
   within the Imperium (remember, a large percentage of Imperials >>are<< 
   Solomani\'s!

It\'s certain that the locals would retain some animosity to the Imperium 
- no one likes to be conquered, even by `good masters\'.  I doubt if the 
Imperium would ever incoroperate Terra into the mainstream: what they 
would aim for is to get a `passive acceptance\' of Imperial rule, with as few
nasty images of occupational brutality as possible.  This aim was secured 
by c. 1100.

They most certainly would -- remember, until Arabella (c. 620), all the 
Emperors were pure-blood Solomani.  Strephon himself has some Solomani 
blood, as does the majority of the human Imperial population.

You\'re quite correct.  

If you want something frightening, remember that all Imperial citizens 
have a Imperial PIN number... all 15.777 trillion of them!  Under the 
control of ONE agency!

The Imperium had a much stronger basis for totalitarianism than the
Solomani ever had: it\'s just that it was based on Noble Rule, not 
Solomani Ideology, so the politically persecuted could always move elsewhere
(if they had enough money, and didn\'t attack Noble Ideology).  However, note 
that there were no \'intervening\' levels of sovergin governments; 
especially in interstellar relations, Imperial Law was the Only Law.

Moreover, the Nobility was generally educated in "the obligations of 
nobility", at least until 1100\'s where the nobility forgot obligations, 
and instead focused on expanding it\'s power.  With predictable results.

---- Long Aside ----

The Regency is striving to \'pension off\' it\'s Nobles, but I doubt their 
possibility of success: too many nobles own too many corporations, and 
many nobles have a planetary basis of power, out of reach of the Regency. 
(ie: all those worlds with govt. codes "3", "5", "A", "B", or "C".  
Religious and bureaucratic govt\'s might be noble-based, as well as family 
govt\'s ("0")).

Moreover, the Regency is still a "Charismatic Dictatorship", ruled 
essentially by one man.  The "rule of law" is based on the Imperial 
Tradition, rather than a constitution, a religion, or public acclaim.
Democratic reforms will make themselves felt most forcably at the 
subsector level.

It will be policically interesting to see how the Regency operates, where 
many people can\'t vote for dogcatcher but can vote on subsector 
immigration...

I would think that any BD bought by such people would have to have all
weapons and most of the electronics removed. You\'d probably need a licence
for it too.

   The Phoenix Project is mentioned by more than one source.  The plan
was to have caches of weapons, etc. placed on various worlds in the
Imperium which would be used by Solomani insurgents when their
brethern started the "Big Invasion".  Unfortunately, the Imperium found
out about it, and seized most of the caches.  During the round up of
Solomani agents that followed, a few of the caches were missed and
forgotten about.

   If anything in the game, the Third Imperium is protrayed as the protector
of individual liberty--this is certainly true when the Zhodani are
mentioned.

   No doubt there were Terrans who were whole-hearted supporters
of the Solomani Party in 1117.  No doubt when they heard about the
assassination of Strephon they pulled their pick-up truck off the side of
the rode, removed their shotguns from their gun racks, and went Vilani
and alien hunting.  Yee-haa.

   With *extremely* rare exceptions, there is a birth record of every
person living in the industrialized world--at TL 7.  By TL 8 on Terra,
there is a birth record of the majority of the population of the planet
(which numbers in the billions).  In many industrialized countries it is
possible to get records of a person\'s birth, schools they intended
growing up, organizations they belong to, any criminal convictions, their
financial history including any credit problems they may have had, major
purchases they have made, even the magazines they subscribe to--all
from a few sessions in front of a computer.  By TL 14, it would be child\'s
play to accumulate all that information and more (including medical
history) in one central database which would be routinely updated.

   Maintaining the "veneer of democracy" was important to the Solomani,
and remember, there were still member-states that were powerful
enough to force SolSec to work covertly within their boundaries.
Julius Caesar made a point of never openly declaring himself dictator,
because he realized that his people would never support a tyrant.
No doubt the hardliners within the Solomani Party always made a point
of keeping up appearances--while at the same time plotting coups,
assassinations, rigging elections, and supressing the opposition in the
name of state security.

   The left-leaning members of the secretariat would have never

   This was the case in any event.  Control two of the above, and you
control the Confederation.  Control all three, and well, let\'s just change
your name to Uncle Joe.  All of the political manuevering would have
been done behind a veil of secrecy, least the masses suspect their

   I\'m not so sure that the Solomani were that monolithic, but as I have
commented in the past, the Solomani seemed to be on a very specific
timetable with their invasion, and when the unexpected happened, they
seemed to have trouble dealing with it.  Actually, if there was trouble
within the Solomani military in the later stages of the war, it was that
individual commanders stopped listening to the high command and were
more concerned about: a) taking care of their people locally  b) getting
home in one piece.

   Monitoring of ships and crews was done covertly.  Your gunner
3rd class that operates laser turret number four could be a Solsec spy
and you would never know.  By 1125, many of these spys would have
been killed, found out for who they were, or changed their alligence.
that would help explain why many commanders rebelled: there was no
one monitoring their activities.

   Even if you reduce the bore of the mass driver, the power
requirements are still out of proportion with what they should be.  I can
propel a hypersonic grav tank with the energy required to power even
a modest mass driver.

   The change I proposed _does_ reduce the power requirement for
all mass drivers.  It is infinitely preferable to use a slightly larger bore
size and have the energy requirement at a level that justifies the
exsistance of the weapon.  It does little good to have a 3 cm gun capable
of penetrating 200+ rating of armor if the power plant required to use
it can\'t be hauled around by normal vehicle.

>BTW have you tried making an explosive power generation system part

>plants attached.

   I thought about this, but doing so would defeat the design reasoning
used behind a mass driver.  Two things I did come up with: reduce
the energy input into the gun; and in the case of a mass driver autogun,
reducing the rate of fire.  Doing both these things makes a mass driver
a little more reasonable on power input, but not enough.

   I\'m assuming you\'re implying they\'d start blowing up their own
merchant vessels out of fear that they might be bad guys.  Presumably
before you issued any "shoot to kill" orders, you\'d change your
merchant transponder frequencies.

>But a code provide just as much security as a transponder. 

   Which means a coded transponder would be even more effective
than either one alone.

>Two things: Everyone knows what\'s inside one of those black boxes.

   Yes, and everyone would know what was inside the Imperium\'s
blackboxes.  No one said that just because they incorporate
revolutionary new technology would mean that no one would be allowed
to look inside.  Any government that _did not_ want to look inside would
have to be gullible as hell.

   No one said that other governments would not be allowed to make their
own--just that they had to be made according to Imperial specs.  Again,
it would be unreasonable for the Imperium to hand out such devices
and expect no one to pry them open.  The Imperium wasn\'t looking to
make money on the transaction--they simply wanted to establish a
standard in Known Space.  Because they did so in a reasonable
fashion, they were largely successful.

>You mean the Imperium told all its neighbours how to make those
>things? In that case they also learned how to fake them. Kinda ruins
>the whole idea, dosen\'t it? Where does it say that they did so, btw?

   I think you misunderstand the whole purpose of an "interstellar"
transponder standard.  The purpose is not to gain a military advantage,
your enemies would see through the ruse--the idea is to make it easier
for your spacecraft to visit their territory and their space craft to
visit your territory.  It was intended to foster interaction and make things
easier on the orbit and space traffic controllers.  It would be done for
the same reason that the US, the UK or Russia would on a planetary
level, and IMHO, it\'s just common sense.

He also says about Terra and the Solomani:

>Several generations ago. They would be Home-boys (;-) by now.

   Perhaps subconciously, but don\'t tell them that.  Remember, Home was
picked because of its similarity to Terra.  The Solomani intended to
recreate their homeworld as much as possible.  I always pictured Home
as having museums full of looted Terran art and monuments that were
recreations of those on Terra (Wanted: Construction firm to build exact
replicas of the Pyramids of Giza.  Inquire at Solomani Party Headquarters
before 31 May).  Children of the refugees from Terra would be
indoctrinated in Solomani Cause and be subjected to long boring
stories about the "good old days".  These stories and indoctrination
would be told and retold generation after generation.  I seem to recall
a people in Terran history who continued to believe they would regain
control of their homeland one day even after centuries of occupation
and exile...humm...I wonder who they could have been?  ;)  Of course
I would never compare the Solomani to the Jews, but the circumstances
were similar.

>It hasn\'t been long enough for a Taiwan-born generation to assume
>control of Taiwan. When that happens they may well drop their claim.

   Someone better tell the ruling party of Taiwan that--while native
peoples on Taiwan and some ethnic Chinese have come to believe that
the island should declare its independence, these people are in the
minority and are in no danger of coming to power anytime soon.

a) Yes and no.  Whilst the _original_  reference  to  IRIS  was  in  a
   Challenge variant it was also mentioned in \'Survival Margin\'  in  a
   number of Stephon\'s diary entries.  But also from  this  source  it
   appears that IRIS wasn\'t everything it was claiming to  be (perhaps
   it _was_ the Brotherhood of Varian) hence the inclusion of the word
   \'legitimise\' in my original post.

c) Norris  is  too  \'Denebiocentric\'  a  choice.   Remember  that  the
   Imperial nobility is a hereditary institution.  Probably  the  most
   acceptable  choice  would   be   Margaret.   She   represents   the
   _conservative_ wishes of  the  central  Imperium,  and  she  has  a
   hereditary claim, ... with Strephon\'s endorsement  the  Moot  would
   probably  accept  her.   Norris,  whilst  being  the  _intelligent_
   choice, would be viewed by many  as  someone  from  the  periphery,
   unskilled  in  the  etiquette  of  high court!

	I do not think that there is anything wrong with the mass driver
	projectile weight formula, if you consider the material the round
	is made of.

	If the MD projectile has the same shape as Gauss projectile
	(l/w ratio 5), the weigth formula [Mp = (pi * r^3)/10] shows
	that the projectile is made of density 10 material. According
	to this, the projectile is a finned dart made of Crystal Iron
	or Iron jacketed Superdense, and will treated as APFSDSxx
	ammunition. (penetration multiplier 4.5 or higher)

	(Actually, the first MD guns in TL-8 would use DU penetrators
	with ferromagnetic jackets or sabots. However, the maximum
	muzzle velocity is 3000 m/s at TL-8, and conventional CRP guns
	can usually outperform any MD guns at this Tech Level.)

How? Well, the states must have records on their own citizens, (for tax
purposes, if nothing else). Presumably one of the conditions of entry into
the Confederation is allowing SolSec access to these.

Yes and no. Us Solomani are pretty contradictory. I agree with your point
- in fact, due to the time delays, all large scale operations *must* follow
a set plan, or they degenerate into chaos - but, according to _Solomani
& Aslan_:

"Our love of independence is our most distinctive trait...
Fundamentally, we idealise self-reliance. Our cultural heroes, for example,
typically solve their problems without seeking outside help.
Tales of such heroes teach our children the value of resourcefulness. Our
schools teach them to consider unfamiliar and untried ideas as viable
solutions to problems."

Aren\'t there rules for armoring individual components?  Maybe you could 
just add all the components together.  That wouldn\'t armor your airframe 
but it would protect everything else.  To make the plane survivable 
otherwise, I\'d make sure it had plenty of excess Gs so that it can still 
get home with some damage.

I wish I knew.  On this subject, does anyone know what the game 
differences are btwn homing and target memory Tac missiles?

Yes.  The gunner has to interpose the gravitically controlled cloud of 
"sand" between the ship and the laser.  Kind of like blocking bullets 
with Wonder Woman\'s bracelets :-)

Maybe the problem here is not that the MD design is wrong but that 
the contra-grav and HePLAR powering your hypersonic grav tank  are totally 
fantastic technologies.  Making MD guns just as fantastic is not a solution,
IMHO.

I think you\'re missing the point, bore size is irrelevant to the 
penetration of the weapon.  _Energy_ is all that counts.  If you make the 
round less massive it will have less energy at a given velocity and will 
thus do less damage.  If you want to make MD guns more energy efficient 
then change the required input energy formula.

The best you can do to make MD guns more efficient is to have input 
energy equal muzzle energy.  If IE<ME you have a perpetual motion 
machine.  In my designs I also use EPGs and have been very satisfied with 
the results.  My 3cm TL 12 6000 m/s mass driver has a muzzle energy of 
19Mj and a required energy of 38 Mj.  I use an EPG which is (if memory 
serves) about 2.4 cubic meters with a 5 rd feed system, not only does 
this power the weapon, but it replaces the HPG as well.  The 120 rds and 
PPCs are about 1.25 m^3.  With SD KEAP rounds the penetration is 340 and 
SR is about 1500m.  I haven\'t tried to design a CPR gun with similar 
performance, but any differences are likely to result from the fact that 
chemical energy is simply more portable and efficient for accelerating 
rounds than electromagnetic energy.

Even if the Solomani Govt themselves weren\'t supplying them arms, there

    Sorry, I misunderstood your question,,,,
     Your right,  striker is not clear on the subject of ammo used verses shots
fired per turn. . A couple of observations..
    1. Striker does mention several places that you can chose to fire less shots
         per round (I persume to save ammo?)
    2. Striker never seems to use shots and die rolls as the same thing.
         (maybe bad writing?)
    To reinforce how vague it is- 26.232 on munitions used in campaigns says:
     "each vehicle has a specified number of shots carried on board.  These
      are used up in combat and are not replenished until a unit recieves
      munitions." - How wonderfully clear.
      I think your original observation is correct. I doesn\'t make since for
      vehicles to run out of ammo in a couple of turns, 1 shot per turn
      seems to be the most straight forward.

    'body' => 'Andy, I\'ll be happy to read your manuscript when it\'s published (or even 
before, if you like - I edit a small RPG magazine as a hobby and do this 
sort of thing all the time).  I\'m sure it can\'t be any worse than The 
Death of Wisdom.  

Frankly, I\'m puzzled by what market GDW expected to sell DOW to.  I kind 
of doubt it will go beyond the group that already buys Traveller stuff 
(like me, the pathetic loser who owns nearly everything ever published 
for the game), especially since it\'s not by a mainstream press.  Due to 
the quality, I don\'t think it will motivate anyone to buy New Era products.

The major flaw I see with the book, one that I really didn\'t stress in 
that first review but that has become clearer to me with a few days to 
reflect on it, is that the central characters, by which I mean the ship\'s 
crew, are just not as interesting as the average set of characters a 
group of gamers would come up with.

I can\'t help but contrast DOW with the PBEM game I\'ve been in for the 
last few months.  The setting is the same (Reformation Coalition), our 
mission is the same (go out on a mission, carrying a scientist ((i.e. 
Patron)) with us), the ship is the same (modified Empress Marava Far 
Trader with places to hide secret cargo), even the crew structure is 
similar (we have a Pre-Virus era Captain who survived in a low berth, 
played by yours truely, folks from both Aubaine and Oriflamme, and a mix 
of starship crew and ground combat dudes).  Frankly, it was weird when I 
read the the first few chapters of DOW, since it was so much like how we 
were gaming our way in the New Era.

On the other hand, our gaming group (and I think the other members of 
our game will back me up here) came up with characters that are far more 
three-dimensional than the ones in the book.  They argue much more about 
RC politics, their planetary origins matter (the Aubauni pilot plays 
Shalli music and is sort of mystical due to the time he spent with a 
Shallif amily, the Oriflammian Marine drinks too much and gets into 
fights, the Captain misses his friends and family he left behind 70 years 
ago, etc.), and they don\'t always get along (the purser and one of the 
gunners got into a fight within minutes of their first meeting).  
Moreover, we have characters from more than just Aubani and Oriflamme 
(five different worlds among the seven characters).

I guess what I\'m trying to say is that this book could have been better 
if it focused on the roleplaying aspects of Traveller rather than 
mechanics and hardware.  The novel reads like a typical gaming 
session from ten or more years ago, when lots of ex-wargamers 
played RPGs and the focus was on blowing things up.  Hell, I almost got 
nostalgic when one section of the book came up: "We go to the starport bar 
and check for rumours."  "Roll against Streetwise."  "Made it."  "The guy 
tells you ___."  Really, that part of the book was almost that bad!

Anyway, enough of this.  The only reason I was so disappointed was because 
the Dark Conspiracy trilogy was so good (especially the first volume - 
read it even if you have no interest in the game system, it\'s that good), 
and I thought GDW would do as well this time.  Maybe Andy is right - 
maybe GDW just couldn\'t afford a better writer.

   I wonder what the Samquis think about the Virus.  Doesn#t the #Black Curtain#

   Antarctica would be a bit on the nippy side (I do not subscribe to the
DGP rubbish about melted polar caps--the discovery of fusion power
among other things in the early to mid-21st century would have
prevented such a thing from occurring).  Shackelton is located down
there, however, so it would be possible.

   Undersea operations would be very complicated.  Remember, the
Dolphins, _like_ the Solomani, and there are quite a few of them
who would have no trouble pulling some spy details against you

   Gokhman is responsible for saving the Imperium#s rear in the Rim and
for placing Dingir in a position to survive the Collapse.  You might call him
the Father of His Country, but I understand that title has already been

   Staying with the British analogy, the Imperium probably treated it

   Not quite.  It would be a simple matter to make conducting a census of
the population which would be forwarded to the Confederation capital
mandatory for membership in the Confederation.  The data collected
would vary in comprehensiveness depending on the tech level of the
world.  SolSec probably send out people to assist low tech worlds in
conducting what it considered to be a #proper# census.  Worlds that
attempted to withhold certain information would be subject to 
Confederation sanctions--and in any event Solsec would have its
covert operatives get the information one way or another.

   I would argue that they were both open to the same levels of abuse,
in much the same way that the Russian Empire and the USSR were--
one made no pretense about being representative of the people, while
the other did--both were capable of being equally brutal under the right
circumstances.

   The #Obligations of Nobility# was probably only given lip service long
before the 1100#s--it would make no sense that the Imperial nobility
would become so corrupted in just a generation.

   The politically correct answer is that IRIS was a variant and should

   Norris is a perfect choice because he IS an outsider, not in spite
of it.  Being closely associated with the Imperial court would actually
have been a strike against you in the opinion of the majority of Imperial 
citizens and the lesser nobility (who would have had great influence in
choosing the next emperor).  In the ideal scenario, Margaret divorces her
husband and marries Norris (I think they were fairly close in age,
anyway).

   They then become joint rulers of the Imperium, and represent an
excellent combination dynamic, innovative leadership and smarts
about the complexities and intricacies involved with running an 11,000
world empire.

Would you care to explain how that is kept a secret?  Any good scanner can
find your nieghbors cordless telephone, or the cell phone in a car 3 blocks
away.  If it\'s broadcasting it\'s not a secret to anybody with a scanner
(anything more than a few seconds will give away your postion)!  That\'s why
there is a thing call Radio listening silence.

ANNEX G (COMMUNICATION) TO 1-4 CAV TACSOP

4. Radio Procedures
 A. Radio nets will be operated IAW current SOI, except that static/fixed
call signs will be used on secure nets only. Troops and companies will use
COLOR call signs on internal nets.
 B. Radio operators will:
  (1) Use lowest power setting possible.
  (2) Do not perform excess radio checks.If possible flip band selector
switch and conduct your radio check on that frequency.
  (3) Use abbreviated call signs once contact has been established.
  (4) Limit transmission time to 9 second burst.
  (5) Erect OE-254 antennas when stationary for more than 30 minutes.
  (6) Authenticate in a timely manner, on non-secure nets only.
  (7) Authenticate all orders or other directives and requests for
information from unknown sources.
  (8) Listen before transmitting to avoid interference with other stations.

9. Signal Variables: 
 A. Challenge and password, frequencies, variables, and static callsigns,
 will change at 2400 hours local.
 B. Variable update will be conducted using one of the following methods:
  (1) CESO will deliver to subordinate units.
  (2) Cdr\'s will receive new variable at Command and Staff meeting
  (3) Over the air waves

10. Cryptonetting (secure equipment):
 A. Variable Cycle:
  1. Variables good for seven days.
  2. Variables are loaded into KY-57 VINSONs no earlier than 24 hours before
variable change.
 B. Variables Issue: Coordination for new codes will be made 2 days before
the end of the current crypto period between SIGO and unit COMSEC
representative.

14. HUSH   - Levels of security:
       HUSH 1 - Radio listening silence.
       HUSH 2 - Radio listening silence with directed              reporting.
       HUSH 3 - Silence imposed until contact with the            enemy.

BTW I seen to remember that warships had a variable transponder in them, this
would be very useful to a pirate ship.  Example See Starship Operators Manual
page 20. Military vessels can select a varity from none to full, and any ship
can always turn that pesky thing off!

BTW challenge and password can confirm idenity.  Example Arrival Vengeance pg
24 Argon Blue Codes-a one use ID code system.

And how do they do that? You can\'t keep something as detectable as a radio 
signal secret for the luffa Mike! Anyway, the issue is moot because Deyo 
chips communicate between each other on any empty channel they can find 
(They are really going to be busy in systems with a few thousand ships 
in-system at the same time ;-).

Yes indeed.

No you don\'t, because you don\'t control the frequencies the chips use. What
you do is ask your chip what the other chip says, and wether your chip
believes the other chip is untampered with.

The transponders aren\'t coded. What they (supposedly) are is tamperproof. 
That means that if the ship that just jumped in claims to be the Free
Trader "Fooled You" then it IS the Free Trader "Fooled You". Who is flying
the ship and what their intentions are is not guaranteed.

Incidentally, GDW did a good job with the Deyo chips in the technical
sense. As they are described they do seem impossible to tamper with.
Where I believe they fall down is to imagine that the chips would not
eventually be faked. You\'d need some breeder chips and some trainer chips. 
Both of these MUST be present at every starport that install new 
transponders, ie all systems with Class A and B starports. That\'s several 
thousand in the Imperium. What do you think the chances are that over a 
period of 30 years at least one corruptable individual would have access 
to these chips?

>>Two things: Everyone knows what\'s inside one of those black boxes.

No, they would only know what the Imperium _claimed_ was inside them. That\'s
the point I\'ve tried to make. The official story is based on the premise
that the neighbours would actually believe them. I can\'t believe they would.

Noone except GDW.

How right you are. Yet "Survival Margin" claims that the Imperium exported
a lot of these circuits, neatly sealed in their tamperproof casings, to many
"Aslan, Vargr, Zhodani, Darrian, Sword World, and Solomani" governments. Now,
I\'ll conceed that the Darrians, Sword Worlds and those Aslan and Vargr states
close to the Imperium propably was too weak to defend against the Imperial
requirenments by imposing trade restrictions. The same does not apply to the
Zhodani or the Solomani. Nor the K\'Kree or the Hivers who are also claimed
to have adopted the system.

> No one said that other governments would not be allowed to make their own--

Yes, GDW did.

>Again, it would be unreasonable for the Imperium to hand out such devices

But that\'s just what the Imperium is supposed to have done. The whole point
in encasing the chips in a tamperproof casing is to prevent anyone from
prying them open.

But the Deyo chips are not a transponder standard. They are small eletronic
devices produced by the Imperium military and enclosed in a tamperproof
casing which the Imperium delivered to their neighbours with instruction
of how to connect to your main computer and ship broadcasting equipment.
Guaranteed by the Imperium not to contain any secret surprises ("Hey,
would we lie to you?"). Sure.

The circumstances are not similar. The whole reason for the survival of
the Jews as a seperate identity up through the Middle Ages was that they
were not allowed by their oh-so-christian neighbours to integrate. As a
counterexample I can cite scores of tribes who were forcibly expelled
from their ancestral lands, moved somewhere else, settled down, and became
Somewherelsians. You don\'t find many Englishmen swearing one day to return
to their ancestral Russian steppes, do you?

The people of Home have their own T-prime planet to live on. Why the hell
should they be interested in going back to Terra. Especially the leaders,
who have access to the best the rich, unspoiled Home can provide.

Hahaha! <snorkle! guffaw> He he he! <insane tittering...>
ROFLAO!  Secret frequencies... what a concept! Hehehehe!
<Pick self up off of floor.>  

Sorry, but I remember a pair of bored electrical
engineers playing with the spectrum analyzer in the lab, and eavesdropping
on every interesting conversation in the entire radio spectrum.  You\'d
be amazed how indiscreet people are over cellular phones... drug deals,
assignations with girl friends, etc., etc.  I digress.  The point is,
all it takes is a full-spectrum scanner to find what frequency you are
using; there is no such thing as a "secret frequency".  Now, encrypting
a signal so that unauthorized listeners can\'t figure it out, that\'s another
story.  

Now I know that someone out there is going "Aha!  She doesn\'t know 
about spread-spectrum signals, which can be secret!".  Well, yes I do
know, and you can do that trick NOW, and spread-spectrum can\'t
be picked out from background noise -- we think.  By the 57th century,
they will have had 3700 years to work on the problem of finding a 
spread-spectrum signal in the background.  My guess is that we\'ll
figure it out before the end of the 21st century.

You\'ve never met anyone serious, Top Secret kind of security, or

guys... they wouldn\'t let the president himself in without the right codes,
and they have no sense of humor, either.  OTOH (playing devil\'s advocate),
I concede that there are a lot of places and times where the local
"authorities" aren\'t taking security seriously because (a) nothing ever
happens around here, and (b) we\'re not doing anything important anyway.
THAT kind of security, you can disguise yourself as the pizza delivery

I hate to do this to you (no I don\'t, I love it! :-), but it is very well known
what is in those "black boxes".  They\'re referred to as "black boxes" 
because they are *sealed*, and the airliner is not allowed to open them
up and play with them, but that they contain a flight recorder on a
continuous loop (an hour or two) is very, very well known.  And Lufthansa,
or any other airliner, *could* get away with it -- if they stayed out of those
countries where the boxes are legally required.  Otherwise, no.  I can\'t
get away with refusing to give the IRS half my money, either, much as
I wish otherwise.  Governments tend to be nasty that way about their laws.

OTOH, another, soveriegn *government* can get away with ignoring 
someone else\'s laws.  You know, like "you\'re supposed to allow us to
inspect your nuclear reactors", "You\'re not supposed to shoot people
for criticizing you in the press", or even "You\'re not supposed to murder
unarmed civilians".

[Proceed?]Yup

There\'s been a lot of discussion about transponders, etc.
Following the example of the real world, I\'d say any ship that doesn\'t want
to get arrested and impounded for several months of red tape (or years in
prison if the rules are more extreme), would opt to have a transponder
fitted. Each world makes its own but set designs would have to be authorised
by the Imperial authorities to verify that the local worlds were not adding
anything they shouldn\'t (or taking out the secret back-door firmware, etc.
the Imperium\'s already put in). Transponders can be more than just a
"identify yourself or die" unit - as a merchant captain I would certainly
not answer a distress call for a ship that didn\'t have a transponder... nor
would I allow any other ship, apparently military, Imperial or whatever,
unless I could be sure of identifying it at distance by its transponder.
Transponders can also be used for navigation to mark ships (which might be
too small to be easily detected by the simple sensors of most merchants),
hazards (asteroids, debris, etc.) and space lanes. The entire navigation
system would rely to some degree on coded data to prevent hackers, enemy
fleets, etc. playing havoc with your in-system navigation.

If you want to out-smart the virus on ship IFF (Identification, Friend or
Foe) then have a look at the book (or less usefully the film) Blade Runner
(starring the heroic Harrison Ford). This includes a description of testing
\'people\' to determine if they are androids - the androids give themselves
away by failing to react to small things that humans do instinctively, etc.
Don\'t forget, a lot of communications in Traveller would involve video as
well as voice and data links, so if the ship approaching your world has the
correct IFF but refuses to open a video channel, or does so and you can see
the ship\'s captain is actually a Marionette from Thunderbirds, then you know
it\'s a nasty Virus ship and not an innocent human ship.

There are all manner of such tests that could be carried out - if they are
successful and Virus ships get destroyed then the next Virus intruders won\'t
have been warned that (for example) the correct answer to IFF query "What\'s
the rat\'s piss like at the Enope bar?" is "Watered down as usual." The Virus
is much more likely to say, "I\'m not aware that rats are served at the Enope
bar?" BLAM.
Problem solved.

Exactly.  From this, we can conclude that military vessels have some way of
making telling the transponder "Shut up and stay shut up \'till I tell you
otherwise".  Its absolutely vital to be able to maintain radio silence, no
matter how much the "Deyo" wants to talk to its buddies.

And, given the realities of military supply depots and human (and alien)
personal foibles, anything that\'s available to the military will become
available (albeit in extremely limited quantities and at incredible prices)

Note: If you think this sounds a little far-fetched, that someone might sell
such military technology, think again.  There are plenty of arrests yearly
for selling pilfered supplies from military bases.  The most extreme example
that I can think of involved entire (whole, working) jet engines from
Air Force bases.

Exactly.  The information transmission medium is secure, but the endpoints
(the originator and recipient) aren\'t.  It is also quite illustrative to
note that throughout most of the history of seafaring on this planet,
"proof" of a given ships ownership and nationality have been no more secure
that accepting (or disbelieving) the flag flying from the stern, and the
ship\'s papers onboard.

It is also quite interesting to note that the cruises of the CSS Alabama
would make a bang-up Traveller adventure, if translated to starships and
planets, instead of steamships and countries.  The Alabama\'s captain made
a regular practise of changing the ship\'s apparent identity and nationality
of his ship.


Actually, I feel that GDW did TOO good of a job with tamperproofing the
Deyo chips.  To my mind, this makes corruption and piracy MORE lucrative and
easier to "get away" with on a continuing basis, rather than less.

Think about it - if the Deyo transponder is accepted universally as absolute
proof of the identity and ownership of a starship, any pirate haven that has
managed to acquire breeder and trainer systems can manufacture perfectly
valid registrations for any ships that it cares to.  Not only will the
aparrent ownership be changed (and the original proof destroyed), but the
uncorruptable Deyos will ensure that the forgery is accepted as genuine,
nearly no matter where the ship goes.

As a ship owner or captain, I\'d almost rather have a sheaf of Imperial
Stationery in my hand, stamped with the Seal of The Imperial Registrar of
Ships, and giving particulars about my ship, its ownership and provenanace,
and so on.  Anybody attempting to steal and re-register my ship would need a
similar set.  Even assuming that they could come up with perfect forgeries,
any half-honest portmaster, when presented with two different sets of
documentation for the same ship, will impound the ship (and probably the
people) in question, until queries to the appropriate offices via the IISS
X-boat and packet network resolve the situation to his satisfaction.


I think we can conclusively state that "breeder" and "trainer" systems MUST
be available on the black market, and are (probably) also standard equipment
on all Imperial Navy capitol ships.  There is canonical (Classic) Traveller
material which indicates that Navy capitol ships can impersonate any ship,
civilian or military, that registry records are available for.

In addition, in The Traveller Adventure, Sergi Haut-Oberlindes was able to
procure for the player-characters a special transponder with three settings.
One was their normal identification, another was a Akerut (or Tukera, I
forget) ship, and the third was as yet unprogrammed.  Obviously, Sergi had
access to a breeder and a programmer module.  Possibly these items, like the
spinal particle accellerator, were also "overlooked" when the Emmissary was
de-militarized?

As Gene Roddenberry wrote a long, long time ago in the original Star Trek
writers\' guide: Translate the situation to current-day equivalents, and see
if its believable.  In this case, Hans is right - its not.

Can you imagine that at any point - even now - that all (or even many)
foreign governments would install an American-made "black box" on every one
of their ships or aircraft.  A black box that transmitted indecipherable
signals more-or-less continously, and which was unopenable without
destroying the contents, such that everyone had to take the US Government\'s
word for it that the contents were benign?

I think not.  PERHAPS, if it were somehow made a requirement in order to use
US airports and seaports, some foreign aircraft and ships would be equipped
with the device, and more-or-less dedicated to the US trade.  But many more
would drop out of the market in favor or larger carriers, and certainly no
miliary service in its right mind would install them on their aircraft and
ships.


Personally, there are many things about the Deyos and the Virus that strain
my suspension of disbelief to the breaking point.  This is one of them.
Unless you\'re wedded to the T:TNE canon, these items are \'retcons\' added for
the New Era, and don\'t belong (and don\'t exist) in Classic or MegaTraveller.

In todays terms a homing missile would be a sidewinder which
"homes" in on the IR heat  from a target. Advanced forms of homing
missles will continue to try to hit the target if it misses the first time.
(until it runs out of fuel or loses lock)
If a homing missle loses "lock" on the IR target then it will miss.
A target memory missle would be like a harm or navy RIM(67?)
which are antiradation (antiradar) missles. It will home in on the
radar signal until it hits. However the enemy may do something
like turn the radar off so the missile will miss. This has been countered
by the newer antirad missiles who have a "target memory" widget
built in. The target memory device constantly estimates the actual
position of the target from the homing electronics. If the homing
electronics loses the "lock" the target memory device would tell
the missle to go to the last known location and blow up. The
current (TL8?) models only work well agianst stationary targets.
However with advanced sensors such as "target imaging" the
missle could actually search for the target once it got to
the estimated position.(very nasty).

controlled missiles are those which require constant operator or system
inputs from a source outside the missile itself inorder to remain flying  in
a straght line, let alone hit the target.  an example of such a missile on
the current battlefield would be the TOW anti tank missile used by the US
army, or the AT-3 sagger used by the "soviet" army.

semi independant missiles use some sort of passive sensor to gain a "fix" on
the target in question.  generaly a target lock from the launch site is
handed off to the missile, which transmits no active targeting beam of its
own, but follows the reflections from the target produced by the lauch
site\'s sensors.  the AIM 7 sparrow air to air missile in service with the
USAF since the 1950"s and the british semi active skyflash missiles are of
this variety.  interestingly enough, so is the hellfire missile used on the
apache helicopters.

fully independant missiles posess their own sensor and guidance packages
which allow them to track and attack a target once the target handoff has
been recieved.  such missiles are able to continue to track the target even
after loosing line of sight (LOS), or any other form of transmission from
the launch site.  These are the fire and forget systems, and are usualy
limited to relativly short ranges, or reduced payloads due to the large size
of the transmiter/reciever and guidance systems nessicary to make such a
beastie work.  current equivalents are the AIM-9 sidewinder air to air
missile, and most ICBMs.

hopefuly this helps.

    But if the frequency for transponders is guarded, how can anybody
transmit or respond? After all, even merchant vessels have transponders that
 identify  them. Seriously, it\'s the _codes_ that make up a valid interrogate
 / response  pair, and identify the ship, that are guarded. Perhaps something
 involving a  public/private key. Military transponders would have an
 additional, frequently-changing code set used in combat.
    Even if the frequencies started out secret, the first time somebody
 interrogated my transponder and it responded, I\'d know what frequencies were
 involved. All it would take is a scanner. (Or in TNE terms, a simple passive
 ems sensor).
 
Message 2 =================
     Recently Michael Bailey asked for a design for a TL-12, 1000T frigate.
 After several days trying to set up a spreadsheet, I think I have a design
 almost finished. Highlights are listed below, but I still need to do a final
 check on everything. If anybody else is interested, I can uuencode the
 spreadsheet and design notes up and post them. Source format is Quattro Pro
 for Windows 5.0 and Word for Windows 6.0, but I can write to a variety of
 formats. Let me know if you\'d prefer e-mail, or if there\'s enough interest
for a public post.
     I would certainly appreciate an independent sanity-check. Also, I don\'t
 have a regular group to playtest the design, so once I post the BL stats I\'d
 appreciate feedback on the use. I wanted something that could either
outfight
 or outrun anything its own size.

   My primary objection at this point isn#t the mass of a mass
driver round, it#s what that mass does to the rest of calculations,
which is to make mass drivers energy hogs.

   I don#t think that this is what they had in mind. My understanding
from the people in Bloomington, Illinois is that the difference in
calculating mass is due to the fact that mass driver rounds are
longer (thus have a different aspect ratio) than a gauss round.  It
has nothing to do with what they are made of.

   Interesting theory, except see above.

   You don#t find 45.126 Mw to be way too much power?!!!  Compare that
performance with a CPR gun of the same tech level and penetration.  
Be sure you include the weight of the larger power plant you#re going 
to have to carry because of the mass driver#s energy requirements.

   Homing missiles home in on a radiating source, whether its an IR
signiture or a radar or radio transmission.  Target memory missiles home
in on a target designated by the firer.  The target doesn#t need to be
radiating anything, and once the missile#s seeker has acquired the target,
you can #fire it and forget it#.

   I#m not saying make them fantasic, just make them so that they can be
justified.  MD guns are suppose to be the interim step between CPR guns
and energy weapons (prior to the introduction of fusion weapons, they
are superior to plasma weapons in certain applications).  At least that
has been the traditional niche they filled.  As it is they make excellent
anti-personnel weapons (when designed as gauss weapons), but poor
big guns because they consume so much energy.

   Energy is important to penetration, but it is not the only factor.  The
energy input requirement formula is identical for mass drivers and gauss
weapons.  Thus to throw a 2cm mass driver round requires much more
energy than a 1.9999 cm gauss gun round, though the rounds for these
two weapons have virtually identical diameters.  Mass driver rounds are
supposed to be longer (thus more mass), but they are so much longer it
takes too much energy for them to be practical.

<snip>

   I would like Loren at some point to let us know if using EPGs with mass
drivers is a valid design (according to FF&S).  If the formula for mass
driver can#t be changed, this may be an alternative.

   There is a big difference between the two.  First, the frequencies that
cell phones, etc. operate on are public knowledge--you can to down to
the local library and find the information.  Not so of aircraft transponders,

   True.  But like I said, keeping the frequencies secret as long as
possible is a good thing, because as soon as they know where to look
for you, you can at the very least expect some nasty jamming, and in the
worse case, an anti-radiation missile coming down on your head.

   You are correct, which is why you also code everything. From my
experience in Army this is the way it worked: everyone in the platoon
knew the platoon frequency, how to contact higher headquarters, the
#freq# of the Medvac guys, and the lieutenant carried around a book of
frequencies and codes (which was about 5 by 7 by 1 inches as I recall)
for the next several layers of command plus other units within the
company. If he went down, the platoon sargeant was in charge of
the book.  If you were a platoon leader and you lost one of the books,
your military career was pretty much toast, unless there were some
pretty significant extenuating circumstances.  The frequencies at which
the IFF (the interogator you used on an AA weapon to tell if someone
was a good guy) operated were known to no one, not even the
lieutenant.

   With the Deyo chips using any open frequency at random, it would
make it much more difficult to pick up their transmissions, but not
impossible, granted.

>No you don\'t, because you don\'t control the frequencies the chips use.

   I had forgotten about this aspect of the Deyo chip.  My comment would
apply if the frequencies were fixed.

   As I indicated, if foreign governments thought the chips were so good
(and apparently they did) then they would have started their own captive
breeding programs.  The Deyo chips would be able to tell their foreign
cousins from their own breed, but that wouldn#t stop the Aslan Hierate
from using them for the same purposes that the Imperium was.

   The only way I#d buy off on using the Imperium#s black boxes if I were
a foreign government is if I had the option to randomly dissect them.
Otherwise, they would act as a deterent to interstellar trade with
governments outside the Imperium, not a simply regulatory device.
Merchants are merchants, however, and if there was a buck to be made
carrying around a mysterious black box they would do it--of course the
ships that did would be dedicated strictly to the interface trade business,
and foreign governments would likely severely restrict their movement.

   Even they are allowed to be wrong from time to time. =:O  Besides,
what#s the Imperium going to do, force every government to account for
the whereabouts of every black box given to them?  It would just be too
simple to say, #oh, we#re sorry, the free trader Zoink blew up a week
ago when its power plant overloaded--I#m afraid we couldn#t recover the
box.#  Meanwhile they#re ripping the box apart in a lab somewhere and
figuring out how to duplicate the Deyo chip.  Of course the Deyo chip
would register has having been tampered with, but who cares? It#s not
like you#re going to put it back in a ship anyway.

   The Zhodani would be a perfect example of someone who would get
hold of a few of the Deyo chips and copy them.  Ditto the K#Kree.  The
Hivers being TL 16 in electronics (which is why they#re still around as an

   Like I said above.  I try to stick to the #orthodox# version of things
whenever possible. When the orthodox version is contradictory or flies
in the face of logic (like #M# type white dwarfs in close orbit of young
stars) I sit down and figure out what makes the most sense and fits with
the story line.  Loren is the company man around here, not me after all.

   Nothing is tamperproof with a little dynamite....  :)

   Then why hand them out?  How do you explain to the ambassador
from Gram why he should mount it in his ship instead of what he is using
now?  They would have had to demonstrate some advantage in using
them, and the best way would be to show how they were constructed.

   Their lack of integration was due to more than prejudice.  In areas
where they were allowed to settle and become part of the community,
they still maintained a degree of seperateness.  Many Jewish
communities went so far as to forbid their children to marry outside their
faith.  Jews did evolve over the time of their exile and even developed
new hybrid cultures (this is where we get Yiddish from), but always
there were those who kept alive the hope that one day they would
return to the Holyland and rebuild the Temple.

   As for the Russian steppes, I really have no desire to go back there,
though I have looked longingly at pictures of East Africa for some
unexplained reason.  :)

   Probably much longer than that, unless political developments warrant
it.  If, for example, China continues down the road of reform and
democratization, Taiwan will have little incentive to ever declare
independence.  On the other hand if China evolves toward an even
more oppressive regime, the majority on Taiwan may eventually give up
on returning #home# and seek a separate path.  It has already been
almost 50 years since the Nationalists lost the Chinese civil war--I have
every confidence that they will continue to hang on to the hope of
retaking China for another 50.

   When you\'re through, please call your local Air Force base and

   The Army introduced code books at the platoon level after their
experiences in Vietnam.  There you had NVA and VietCong types who
could not only talk with a perfect accent (take your pick, Australian,
Alabama, Ohio, etc.), but would assume the role of "Birddog One" or
whatever call sign someone might have been using for the past month.
I\'ve heard tapes of some of the conversations these people had over
the air with American and Allied troops.  Pretty scary.

   I pointed out (and others) that everyone would want to know what
was in the little black boxes that were being hooked up to all their
important systems, and that only people who had something significant
to gain by using them would if they weren\'t told.  At any rate, the
Imperial press would have been very interested in a story about
mysterious transponders, and sent some intrepid reporter to investigate.
No doubt a basic description of them (including the Deyo chip) would
have appear in the 57th century equivalent of Aviation Week and Space
Technology soon after.

   Speaking as the grandson of Kentucky coal miners and the proud
owner of a Stephens Model 311 (made before serial numbers) double
barrel shotgun, and a member of the Greene County Fish & Game Club,
I can tell you the difference between plain good old country folk and
brainless red necks.  Red necks shoot at people because it\'s fun to
watch\'em run--country folks shoot because you gave \'em no alternative.
Red necks waste ammo shooting into the air, and kill deer from their
cars on the side of the road and drive off--country folks generally hit
what they are aiming at and kill a deer so that they can bring it home
to be prepared for their families.  Red necks have a Confederate flag
window sticker in their truck \'cause it pisses off black people--country
folk have a Confederate flag window sticker in their truck because it
represents to them a link with a time when people had honor and stood
up for what they believe in.

   In the 57th century, red necks would be out hunting down aliens
just to watch them squirm--country folks if they had an opinion in
support of the Solomani, would organize a militia and fight the Imperial
occupiers with everything they had, all the while treating their enemy
respect.

   I take it Cynthia you are one of the country folks, and not a red neck....

Regarding transponders again...

   In wartime merchants work under a different set of rules.  Generally
they travel in convoys (safety in numbers after all).  Loose lipped
crews would find themselves and a lot of their fellow merchants floating
home--and don\'t think that point wouldn\'t be driven home to every
crewperson, by the way.

Well, when I said that the chips as described did seem to be tamperproof I
failed to consider the local magic system, mostly because the capabilities
of psionic adepts being so ill-defined it is possible to say that per def
no psionics can affect them (actually, a built-in psionic shield will do
the trick). Without such a shield a cybernectic telepath could propably
make love to a chip and persuade it to lie ;-)

Read what I\'m saying, Harold. The chips are not a standard that the other
governments can design their own chips to, they are small electronic etc...

Yes, and those were mostly the ones who was having a hard time where they
were. That\'s my whole point. You don\'t maintain that kind of burning
desire if you\'re reasonably well off where you are. Examples: The Jews
in Scandinavia and Germany around 1910.

Again, if you really think that there is not a profound difference between
the wiews of 1st and 2nd generation exiles and those of 3rd and 4th 
generation exiles, then that\'s your priviledge. All I can say is: You
are wrong, Sir.

Try coming up with one example of a people who, _having established 
themselves comfortably in exile_, really were anxious to return to
their ancestral lands. Note the qualification, because that\'s the
lynchpin of my argument. The people, especially the rulers, of Home
are IMO comfortably established on Home. They might talk a good return
to Terra, but when it came to action...

Haven\'t we reached a consensus? The Deyo chip may hold water in a technical
sense, but in terms of human nature the official history leaks in all
directions. Right?

Sure, they\'re classified... which is why I don\'t ask the Air Force what they are.
I ask my RF engineer friends with the spectrum analyzer.  Which bands are
reserved for military use is well-known (i.e., published), so you eliminate
non-military chunks of the spectrum right there.  Presumably, if I want to know the
freqs, I know something about the signal I\'m looking for -- what it\'s for, what the
minimum characteristics? performance? *must* be to do the job it has to do -- so I\'ll
know it when I hear it and the laws of physics might give me an idea what piece of
the  remaining military spectrum it MUST be in.  If I\'m a hostile government, I
then have lots of technicians and engineers with spectrum analyzers and computers to
listen for signals across the suspect bands, and analyze them.  If you use those IFF
interrogators, I\'ll eventually find their frequencies.  
      Yes, you can have "Secret" frequencies, as in \'they have a red stamp on the
paper saying "Top Secret"\' -- but you can\'t have "secret" frequencies as in "no one 
will ever find out what they are".

I\'m actually surprised that they didn\'t have them before that... the Germans 
pulled the same kind of trickery in WWII once in a while.  The Army Air Corps
boys certainly had enough experience with that... German fighter pilots in captured
Allied fighters with Allied markings still on them used to infiltrate bomber formations
and attack the bombers.  It got so bad that the B-17 gunners would shoot
anything that got too close, no matter whose markings were on it.  OTOH, the Vietnam
War seems to have been when McNamara\'s young hotshots decided to toss out 
everything we learned about running a military over the last 2000 years as 
"old-fashioned" and start over from scratch...

Hmm.. the German fighter trick would be a good one to pull in Traveller --
Vargr/Zhos/Sword Worlders flying captured Imperial fighters/destroyers, infiltrate the
Imperial formation, and shoot the crap out of something big and expensive.  
Then bug out.

Well, actually I\'ve lived in the city or suburbia most of my adult life :-) 
I appreciate your analysis -- you hit it right on the nail.  I said I live in
the South -- I\'m not Southern myself, I\'m a Sourdough -- born on the Last
Frontier.
A lot of Alaskans still have the frontier mentality, and my husband *is* Southern
"country folk"... and we both spent years in the military.  I appreciate the military
for the job it does, and for the wonderful educational experience of living under
a (mostly) benign dictatorship.  It makes you appreciate your Rights, both Civil
and Divine, and makes one a bit testy about those who would whittle them away.
I find most (American) military folk to be that way.  

Down here (Mississippi and Lousiana), people tend to be a little sensitive about
the term "redneck" -- for years ignorant Yankees and other liberals have been
calling any conservative Southerner a "redneck", tarring "country folk", "rednecks",
and Republicans with the same brush.  As a result, true "country folk" defiantly
call themselves "rednecks" and are proud of it -- same reason they display Confederate
flags -- not to "annoy blacks", but for the reason you mentioned and to show
their defiance of those who would tell them that their ancestors were evil for defending
the 10th Amendment rights of the States they lived in.  I am seriously
considering getting a Confederate Flag bumper sticker, just because of all
the hurrah in the media about the Georgia and Mississippi state flags having
the Confederate Battle flag incorporated in them.  

Anyway, because I have several "country folk" friends who defiantly call themselves
"rednecks", what you call "redneck" I call "stupid jerk" or something less printable
on the TML (it starts with \'a\' and ends with \'ole\').  Although I tend to reserve the less
printable term for those who display a certain level of malevolence as well
as stupidity.

What does this have to do with Traveller?  I don\'t know.  Think of something.  Some
key words and tricky phrases just set me off in "rant" mode.  I understand
Steve is
having a nice argument over on xboat about merits of the 2nd Amendment, so it isn\'t
just me... or Steve.  Curiously enough, many of my views on government and people
are mirrored in the writings of some well known science-fiction writers: Robert A.
Heinlein, H. Beam Piper, Jerry Pournelle (though he\'s a little too monarchist), and
some less well known: F. Paul Wilson, for instance.

Forgive a late-comer to the thread, but in what way do the Deyo chip and Virus
hold water in any technical sense?  It is this specific feature of the new
Traveller canon which prevents me from using the Traveller universe as my
campaign setting.

If you want to avoid repeating what is apparently a long-running discussion
feel free to answer by private e-mail.  I\'m not interested in argument -- I\'m
only interested in what sorts of PSG (pseudo-scientific gobbledigook) is used
to make Virus palatable.  The canonical explanation simply doesn\'t make any
sense at any level.  The social facets of it, so eloquently explained by several
people on the list, are obvious.  The technical facets of it are equally obvious
after a few minutes\' thought.  (How the hell does a PROGRAM, a set of states and
state transitions, on one computer change the underlying HARDWARE of another,
often completely unrelated, computer?)

This is exactly what led to changes in the way the military does things. As
a former OPSEC/COMSEC officer, I can speak from experience. For example,
"static" (unchanging) call signs are only used in training. "Real" call
signs are changed on a _very_ frequent basis. And even when you hear a voice
with a valid call-sign, they have to be able to authenticate properly.
Authenticator codes, ciphers, etc. have very short lives as well. And let me
tell you, it is an administrative nightmare for the poor sucker (me)
responsible for making sure the pilots have the current COMSEC material. The
service also takes a very dim view of anybody who takes the security rules
(much tighter than for regular classified of the same level) lightly.

I don\'t know about _most_, but a lot of folks around here seem to be holding
on quite tightly to places their _grandparents_ came from.  I suspect they\'d
never return (else why haven\'t they done so), but they still buy the savings
bonds, travel "back" every year, maintain the language and customs, send
money to the family "back home", etc.

Here is my newest attempt at designing motorcycles using FF&S.  It\'s a TL 
6 Motorcycle, which turned out to be pretty cheap.  I found many mistakes 
with my pervious designs, and this time I\'m sure it\'s a valid FF&S design.  
Please send any comments, ideas, errors to me.  

	-Shalom Zaidfeld

Note:  
 
This motorcycle design uses two rule changes.  First, 
The Open Crewstation is modifed according to the rules for 
Grav belt design, which can be found in the FF&S ADD ON RULES 
section in RCEG.  They state that a Rigid type grav belt workstation 
will use 0.04 as it\'s mass, no volume and the price will remain the 
same as in FF&S.  So I converted this rule for use in
my Motorcycle design stage.  The second modification is in the 
restricted seat.  It uses no volume or mass, but the price 
remains the same.  In motorcycles, the seat really doesn\'t 
take any volume or mass that should be accounted for.  The 
passanger is riding on top of the motorcycle main hull.

I subscribed to this listserver in the hope of reading interesting 
conversations about Traveller, and gaining new ideas for games; 
instead, I find long threads on subjects only vaguely related. 
Forgive this rant, those of you who post game-related stuff, but this

even _my_ domestic policy!
Please, oh please, could we have a little more Traveller material, as 
opposed to discourses on US current affairs. We can read that in the 
papers.

On a more sensible note - in the spirit of a new beginning:

What is the likely fate of the Aslan Incursions within the Domain of 
Deneb, once communications across the Rift to the Heirate have been 
severed. How are the isolated Aslan likely to react? Also, are they likely 
even to have survived? I think that Norris would see this as a weakness, 
and push back into these territories during the crisis.

Any flames - please stick to personal email.

The Imperial Pagans are a religious group common throughout Diaspora and 
Daibei sectors of the Imperium. The founders of the Imperial Pagans took 
elements of traditional \'planetary deity\' religions and combined them 
into an intricate pantheon of mythic level figures representing the 
populated planets and important stellar objects. This pantheon was in 
many ways a metaphor for known galactic civilization. The individual 
characters reflected in an archetypical sense the character and 
personality of each planet. The tensions, alliances, and enmities between 
the characters mirrored in the stories told of each \'god\' and the lessons 
which should be drawn from events.

The founders of the Imperial Pagans held an informal gathering of nature 
worshiping religions and shamanic traditions. These religions, with their 
emphasis on the earth that gave their civilizations life, often had 
trouble with interstellar civilization. The meeting was held to find a 
way to explain the vast diversity of worlds and life and to integrate all 
of the individual naturalist religions to combine into a single ethical 
community.

Since 652, when the number of worlds with active IP congregations reached 
16, the dispersed congregations of the IP have communicated with each 
other to discuss and debate the deeper meanings of current and historical 
figures and events. As the discussions mature over months and years 
(think of them as Internet collaborations with a 2 week minimum 
communications lag - if not months) the events are described in story 
format. Over time, the stories are edited and refined until with age and 
care, the event or person in question has become a mythological icon.

Certain characters, often Admirals or Emperors, or just as often common 
adventurers or ordinary folk, would begin to have cycles of stories 
attributed to them. Carefully recorded are the source materials from 
which the stories are based, but the myths are the important part.The 
myths are recorded and passed on in the form of a holographic projection 
of the teller speaking the words to the audience. Small groups listen to 
the recordings as part of their religious observance. Larger groups 
gather to listen to particularly significant myths, often in direct 
relation to current events. The average IP is well educated, if only 
through the religion, and all are active members of the discussion 
community. The IP\'s are consummate historians, anthropologists, and 
philosophers. They have little dogma, they keep open records of debate 
and source material.

In the New Era the IP are a significant civilizing influence. Their 
belief structure was able to accomodate the idea of a galactic armageddon 
and rebirth.On many worlds the IPs were lonely lights against the 
darkness. they preached regrowth of civilization and they remembered the 
old dreams.

As Hans points out, it doesn\'t matter how secure the Deyo (or any other)
transponder system was, it would have leaked like a sieve - everyone would
have used it but it would have been abused with fakes and alterable
transponders.

Modern examples from just this week\'s news (on humans ignoring laws) are the
\'revelations\' that some UK farmers have still been feeding their cattle
illegal hormones and not bothering to get rid of BSE-infected cows. Well,
thankfully I avoid beef anyway now but when a whole generation of UK
citizens starts coming down the human BSE, perhaps little \'cock-ups\' like
the Deyo/Virus/etc. situation won\'t seem so far from reality.

I can just see that lone scientist saying "But look, if we install the same
chip in every ship, what happens when it goes wrong."
Fellow scientist: "Don\'t be stupid Heinz, they\'ll never go wrong."
Heinz: "But look, I\'ve just found this ancient article about a chip called
the Pentium which caused all hell to break loose over a minor floating point
error. Just think of the compensation claims if our Deyo has a fault..."

SECRET FREQUENCIES, ET AL.
If you can\'t get the stuff the hard way (i.e. by careful examination of the
EM spectrum to find the frequencies and their coding method) why not do it
the easy way, i.e. find one corrupt official of appropriate level and pay
him 2MCr (in a Traveller plot this man could be called "Aldritch Aimes", for
example. In fact, for 2MCr he\'d probably give you the plans for the whole
navy fleet as well, prove the Imperials knew the Hivers were dodgy well
before the Virus, and uncover the secret plans for mass annhilation of the
K\'kree by a fleet sponsored by McDonalds).

The discussion was about the transponders, not the virus. Take a look at
the description of the chips. They really do seem impossible to _alter_
once they\'ve been created.

Did you ever see "Raiders of the Lost Ark"? Were you one of those people who
said: "Hey, no way the Ark of the Covenant could work like that!"? Or did
you (like me) say: "OK, the film postulates that the Ark of the Covenant
works like it does in the Bible. Let\'s see what kind of story that makes."

A game universe does not have to be an accurate model of the Real World to
be fun (often contrariwise). What it does need is to be consistent, so that
the players can PLAN their moves rather than just flail around randomly.
One good way to ensure consistency is to base most of your physical laws
on those of the Real World (because they are nothing if not consistent).
They are also known to your players beforehand, so you don\'t need to spend
endless hours explaining them. But if you explain the difference to them,
there\'s nothing wrong with deviating from the Real World in a carefully
controlled way (Jump Drives, Psionics, Contragravity, etc.). Only, if you
do so, make sure the new rules are _consistent_. So there\'s nothing wrong
with a Magic Plot Device like the virus per se. If Real Life Physics can\'t
take a joke then fuck RLP. What I object to is when a story isn\'t consistent.
(The Ark of the Covenant is OK by me, but I object strongly to those nazis 
running around _armed and uniformed_ in a British Protectorate!).

>(How the hell does a PROGRAM, a set of states and state transitions, on one 
>computer change the underlying HARDWARE of another, often completely 
>unrelated, computer?)

Well, you see, there was this living silicon chip with psionic abilities.
Every version of Virus that changes the hardware has one of those chips
behind it. Those Virus versions that are pure program only generate pure
program descendants.

What do you mean that\'s impossible? How much do you know about Real Life
Psionics?

No, what I dislike about the transponders is that GDW went to a lot of
trouble (and inconsistency) to explain why the Virus could spread through
all these ships. But that only gets Virus to a lot of planets. After that
they have to state that, per definition, this Virus is so sophisticated
that it can work its way into ANY system ("It\'s magic!"). OK, that\'s their
priviledge. But if they had to make it magic anyway, why waste strength
on such a bogus story as the transponders?

That\'s holding onto their cultural roots. I say nothing against that. All I
said was that once settled on a rich, pleasant T-Prime world like Home, the
patriotism of the settlers would be directed at the place they were born, 
grew up, and are making a good living.

strong 2nd Amendment discussion, and what happens?  My damned 
mail server goes down for a week.  Personally, I am a very strong
2nd Amendment supporter, but not all (or even most) of the 
worlds in my Traveller game reflect this.  

I do make a separation between planetary cultures and Imperial
culture.  I see Imperial culture as the overall set of values and
attitudes held by the Imperial citizens who spend most of their
lives travelling from world to world.  This group would tend to 
include most (but not all) PCs, as well as a fairly large portion of
the Imperial nobility and the members of the Imperial services 
(IISS, IN, IMC, IA).  I also tend to see another distinct cultural
group, the Corporate culture.  This group is similar to the Imperial
culture, but is based on loyalty to a megacorporate entity.

The Imperial culture I tend to see as being fairly individualistic, and
while I don\'t think it is violence-prone, I feel it does not shrink
away from violence, and sees violence as another legitimate
(though costly) way of solving problems. In terms of views about
weapons and armor, these items are tools used to stay alive and
to further the goals of the individual or group in question.  For
this reason, weapons are fairly available in the extrality zone
of most starports (I generally set starports at Law Level 2, but
when rolling for possible harrasment by Security I pretend the
Law Level is about a 6; the starport managers frown on
property damage).

The Corporate culture would have a similar outlook, but this outlook 
would be colored by a loyalty to the megacorp.  This loyalty might
be based on tradition or on greed, but it would still be loyalty.  In
this case, violence would also been seen as a legitimate means
of problem solving, but this judgement would be strongly
tempered by the possible economic or reputation effects on the
megacorp and on the person or group in question.

The Planetary culture would be a wildcard.  Each world has its
own unique culture, or at least a subset of an overall ethnic
culture like Solomani or Vilani or what have you.  Every kind
of viewpoint you can image (and plenty you cannot imagine)
would show up in some Planetary culture.

Now there\'s a neat idea for handling one world\'s law level.  In fact, you get
a 
couple of possible offshoots:
1 - As above; the government does not abuse this, and nearly all gun owners 
play along as well.  The main play effect here might be that the PCs, upon
visiting the planet, have a small adventure either getting local weapons
permits, or inadvertently violate local weapons laws.
2 - As above, but the local government takes a more oppressive bent and
begins
cutting back ammo quotas and keeping "hit lists" of known ammo buyers.  Lots 
more adventure possibilities here:  The PCs could be hired by pro-weapon
resistance forces as mercenaries, or if technically skilled could be hired as

illegal ammo makers.  Or they could become smugglers, running ammo to
the resistance.  Or the PCs might get hired as infiltrators or trouble
shooters by the local government.

Well, there\'s my .02Cr.  For those of you offended or annoyed at the
recent rash of gun rights discussions, I offer a minor apology, but in
general I think things like this deserve discussion.  As I have shown
above, there is a Traveller relevance to this topic, since it is
intimately involved with one of the eight Universal Planetary Profile
numbers.  I realize the others don\'t get discussed as much, but there
is little argument over world sizes or atmospheric types.  The only
other controversial one would be government, which also will
generate the occasional massive arguments (I hope we all remeber
the great Feudal Technocracy debate).

And for those of you not in the U.S.A., who feel disconnected from the
main points of the gun rights material:  Keep giving your input.  I am
keeping notes based on the info from our foreign friends, and your
views or the views of your governments will absolutely show up in 
some planetary culture somewhere in my universe.  I thank you all
for your ideas.

   Basically I am putting in my two credits worth.  My views are more in
line with what GDW has to say on the subject, and I have a basic
understanding of the logic behind GDW#s thinking.  If you were posting in
response to me because you thought you had an opportunity to tear
down someone who somehow bought off 100 percent on every thing
GDW has to say on the subject, I#m sorry to disappoint you.  Like I said
previously, I follow the orthodoxy as much as possible.  When writing for
GDW it is necessary to follow the orthodoxy without question (or I
should say It#s a good idea to do so--the storyline gets mucked up pretty
quickly if you don#t), otherwise what you write is a variant.

   I wouldn#t recommend it.  I understand they are very demanding lovers
(little known fact about Deyos).  Psionic manipulation would theoretically
be possible, but I was thinking in terms of simple duplication.  At TL 15,
cloning Deyos would be a rather easy.  Manipulating the clones into
useful transponder chips would take a bit longer, but it could be done. 
As to the Hivers, I#m sure that they had the Deyo jumping through hoops
and being well behaved little silicon lifeforms.  The Hiver who pulled off
the trick?  Why M.Gates of course....

>Read what I\'m saying, Harold. The chips are not a standard that the

   At TL 15 genetic manipulation is quite common.  Megacorporations
probably go around designing new living, breathing pets the way that toy
makers now make a new teddy bear.  Why should Deyo chips be more
unique than human beings (who are also the subject of genetic
manipulation)? The specs on how to make your own Deyo should be no
more complicated than  that--and like I said, if the Imperium wasn#t in the
mood to dispense the information, it wouldn#t  take long to figure it out.

   OK, the Jews of New York City would be one example.  There they still
occupy whole neighborhoods.  Everyone from the guy that owns the
koshier deli to the kid that sweeps the deli owner#s floors is Jewish.
Though they have absorbed a degree of American culture, they still
maintain many of the traditions they brought with them a century ago. 
Typically they might work outside the community, and even have
non-Jewish friends, but they always identify with their neighborhood
and its people more than they do the outsiders (this last aspect is
shared by other ethnic groups in NYC as well).  Many of them have
friends or family in Israel, or have visited there at least once in their
lives.
They also send money in Israel for projects--everything from planting
trees (popular 20 years ago), to providing assistance to Russian Jews
who have recently migrated there.

>So does most other faiths.

   But to the degree that this is important at least here in the U.S. has
achieved almost a degree of legend.  Or so Jewish comedians would
have you believe.  :)  I think anyone over the age of 30 has heard about
the stereotypical Jewish mother who dotes over her son, and advises
him to #settle down and marry a nice Jewish girl.#  Every indication I#ve
had from my Jewish friends is that the reputation of the Jewish mother is
well earned.

   There were Zionists (those who wanted to see Israel re-established)
among the Jews of Germany and Scandanavia, just as there were in
other parts of the world.  A large number of Jews left the U.S. after the
establishment of Israel so that they could settle there (some Jewish-
American pensioners retire to Israel to this day).  Certainly the Jews in
the U.S. could be counted as reasonably well off.

   I think you are badly underestimating the strength and influence of the
Solomani Cause in Confederation politics.  True, it may have meant
something different depending on what member-state you were from,
but the common theme of the recovery of Terra was always there. 
Remember what I said in previous posts.  Home was selected as the
capital because it was so Earth-like.  Home was made as much as
possible to look like Earth.  If as you are growing up you were constantly
bombarded by images and rhetoric about how this place you are living
is not where you belong, then there#s a good chance you#ll not want to
stay if you have an opportunity to go back to your true #home#.

   Of course there are profound differences.  The mere fact that there
are descendents of Chinese refugees who would think about declaring
Taiwan independent and think of Taiwan as home not China, tells you
that.  You seem to think that the process of total amalgamation takes 3 or
4 generations, and it#s simply not true.  There is no fixed formula for it
because of all the variables involved.  Otherwise there would be no
Palestinian refugee problem in the Middle East, no Jewish immigration to
Israel after WW II, no Hungarian ethnic types in Romania, and my wife (a
4th generation Italian-American) certainly wouldn#t use #you Americans#
when she sees my family acting in a way that differs from hers.

   The Jews after their captivity in Babylon.

   I#m not saying that there won#t be a significant percentage of the
population that consider consider themselves to be Homeians and not
Terrans, but the overwhelming majority would refer to themselves as
Terrans first.  We aren#t told the population of Home prior to the First
Solomani Rim War, nor are we told how many Terrans imigrated from
Terra to Home during and after the war.  These are important facts in our
conversation that we can only speculate about.

And again with the transponder thing...

   It leaks here and there, to be sure.  Whether you throw the baby out
with the bath water, or try to make sense of the official storyline with
some creative reinterpretation to patch the holes seems to be the
question.

   I don#t recall Iraq or the U.S.S.R. spending a lot of money on such a

Well Bob:
	The U.S. gun legislature can be looked upon as being the rough 
equivalent of a high law-level world, and while yes this is but a small 
drop in the imperial bucket, not all planets follow imperial rulings.  Some 
of these planets even have governments similar to U.S., or U.K. or Canadian
, Or Russian, Or what-ever.  By better understanding the cause and effects 
of thses different governments you can better represent how the player 
characters would intereact when having to deal with governments of various 
types.  I.E. we have been discussing the ownership of BattleDress, well if 
you extrapolate U.S. Gun-law a atep further you could come up with a law 
system that outlaws or allows for the ownership of such items.  Further you 
could take the idea of gun-outlawing to it\'s extremes and see what would 
happen if you allowed a single group of individuals to dictate the actions 
of all others in a planetary government.  

	Befor anyone jumps on a discussion step back and think it through, 
could you use this information to gleam a better understanding of how 
governments or other things work??


>I subscribed to this listserver in the hope of reading interesting

everything discussed can be used to enliven a game, if it gives you a sense 
of how a certain situation might go (I.E. two people in a bar talking about 
the new legislation against PSIonic Shields.)  Just take a detached look at 
it.  However if the discussion does not in some way refer to the game after 
a limited amount of time, it should be moved off to the more appropriate 
lists.

	I think perhaps the Female Aslans that were around would have taken 
control in the abscence of communications, and would have refounded a 
splinter society.  They perhaps would have bound together to survive, and 
eventually attempt to make contact with the home-worlds.

I hope this has been a usefull communictions, and that there does not

Not exactly.

There\'s a perfectly good reason for starships to have a transponder system
onboard (transponder in the same sense that modern aircraft are equipped
with a transponder, and NOT the Deyo/Virus hokum that GDW created for T:TNE).

In my Classic/MegaTraveller universe, starships have the following systems
as part of the standard communications and navigation suite:

1) Transponder.  This is a radar reciever and transmitter, that also has
   a simple, hard-wired process-control computer built into it.  Standard
   traffic-control radars operate on one of several bands, and broadcast
   coded data pulses as the sweep their beams through space.  The
   transponder recieves this radar pulse, decodes the data, and transmits
   a similar pulse, with new data.

   The data pulse from the traffic control radar contains a traffic control
   ID code (see notes under "Navigation Reciever" below), and a scan
   position code.  The transponder removes the traffic control ID code and
   inserts its own transponder ID code in its place, and then repeats the
   scan position code back as a broadcast (as opposed to the narrow beam
   used by the traffic-control radar).

   The transponder ID code is an the ship\'s official registry number, a
   (relatively) short alphanumeric code, unique to each ship.  Registration
   information is distributed througout the Imperium in varoius databases,
   so that in theory anyone recieving the transponder signal can determine
   who the ship is, and display this information on the bridge.
   
   Merchant ships transponders are equipped with an on/off switch: the
   transponder can be silenced if need be.  Of course, operating a starship
   without showing a transponder is a serious offence unless there were
   extenuating circumstances.  Broadcasting the incorrect transponder signal
   is also a very serious offense.  Failure to show a transponder signal has
   been cited by the Imperial Navy as sufficient reason to presume a vessel
   has hostile intent - and such vessels have been fired upon in the past.

   In addition ot that, military ships have programmable transponders, and
   can transmit false registration numbers and/or false scan position codes.
   Transmitting a false ID can make the warship seem to be a harmless
   transport (or a larger threat than it is!), or can be for a wholly bogus
   registration, while false scan position codes will make the ship appear
   where it actually is not, or can make the ship appear to be a \'false\' or
   \'ghost\' trace on the Navigation reciever\'s display, and even dissapear
   entirely if the decoding logic rejects the signal as entirely spurious,
   and removes it from the display (quite litterally, transmitting an "I\'m
   not here" code).  While these measures won\'t fool an enemy vessel all of
   the time, they are generally effective on pirates, raiders, and other
   small forces.

2) Navigation Reciever.  This is a reciever very similar to the one built
   into a transponder, which feeds data into the ship\'s navigation computer
   systems.  By combining the traffic control radar signal with data
broadcast
   by other transponders operating in the system, the navigation computer
   can determine the locations and (given several observations) the courses
   of every ship in the system).
   
   Some traffic control radars are used to provide position and advisory
   information to starfarers, while others are used to locate ships (either
   by direct radar reflections (at short ranges) or by activating their
   transponders (at longer ranges).  The function of the beacon is coded
   in the traffic-control ID code.  Some beacons are used to interdict a
   a world or a system, while others provide traffic lanes and flight paths
   to manage traffic.  Like ship registration numbers, the traffic control
   ID codes are maintained in a database, so that a ship can quickly
   determine the purpose and charted location of the beacon and act
   accordingly.

   Tampering with traffic control beacons, or otherwise interfering with
   their operations is a very serious Imperial crime (and one that pirates
   have been known to engage in).

3) Black Box (or Flight Data Recorder).  This is a data storage unit (at
   lower TLs, a tape recorder, while at higher TLs more exotic and durable
   technology is used).  It records several hours\' worth of cockpit
   conversation, plus all flight control inputs, and the most recent jump
   co-ordinates.  Higher TL units record more parameters, and retain the
   data for a longer period of time (TL-15 units, for example, store data
   on the last 8 jumps).

   These boxes (which are orange, and very durably constructed) are
   ordinarily sealed and \'tamperproof\'.  The box can only be legally
   opened and its data played back by the appropriate Imperial officials,
   and only after a warrant has been granted by the appropriate (subsector
   level) authority (although the warrant is merely a formality in any
   case where a flight mishap has caused a loss of life).

   Skilled characters can, of course attempt to tamper with a Black Box;
   they are not likley to be successful, and their tampering will probably
   be detected, unless they have high skill levels in Mechanical (physical
   access to the Box), and Electronic (for low-tecyh boxes) or Computer (for
   high-tech boxes).

Hi again :-)
Well, I got some pointers from Scott Kellogg, and I tried to find a fix 
to my design, while staying with FF&S rules.  I think I got it this time :)
A cheap, 140 kg motorcycle, top speed 150 kph when loaded.. Sounds ok for 
a 1950s type motorcycle.  Please send any comments, errors, pointers etc.

   It\'s not marketed as Battle Dress.  It\'s the ultimate in civilian
survival suits.  It\'s for the explorer, the adventurer.  It\'s perfect for
exploring caves on uncharted planetiods.  It\'s tough, it\'s durable, it\'s
real expense.  It has nifty options.  Instead of the rifle analogy, think of
sports cars.  Leather interiors, advanced life support systems with scented
air filters.
  Come on kids, why would a civilian *need* a sports car that does three
times the legal speed limit (i.e. Shelby Cobra)?  
  Of course, you can impose various restrictions on Civilian Survival Suits.
Restrict the extra strength to standard or even 1.5 standard.  Put
transponders on them, so they can be tracked by the government.  Tie the
transponder into an override circui, so the government can freeze you at
will.  Strict licensing and permit systems needed to own and operate.
Civie models produced with out the standard mountings for weapons systems of
course.  The bright, designer colors kinda stand out too.
  Needless to say, such things would be the toys of the rich.  Folk who have
enough money, could probably obtain, illegally of course, real battle dress
if they wanted.

Oddly enough, the technical aspects of the Virus make more sense than
the societal ones, as I hope to show you.  How does the Virus, nominally
a program, change (1) hardware on (2) another computer?  

Item (2) is easy -- the two computers merely have to be in communication.
Anything Virus can do to computer A, it can do to computer B if it can 
communicate with it.  I believe the "canon" does require computer-to-
computer communication as a prerequisite to infection.  
Remember, the Virus is a grandmaster-class hacker -- the originals
were programmed with all the accumulated dirty tricks known to the
Imperial spook agencies. Second, they\'re very, very smart, even 
sentient under the right circumstances.  This isn\'t a dumb virus
program, this is the Bulgarian Underground Hackers on a chip.  That\'s
how it does it to ANOTHER computer.

Item (1): how does software change hardware?  A few things to note: one
thing I postulated some time ago is that Imperial technology computers
carry the concept of PALs and PLAs and microcode even further along
and are very likely composed of self-configuring processors; i.e., they
can literally rewrite their own circuitry as needed.  Doing lots of number
crunching with little output?  The unused holographic processors re-
configure themselves into more floating point units.  Now imagine the 
VIRUS getting loose in circuitry like that.

More primitive technology is vulnerable to another form of attack: it IS
possible to alter the physical characteristics of a CPU with software.  It
is very, very tricky to do deliberately; the one Real World example that 
I know of was done by accident.  In the early days of the space 
program (and one of our TML rocket scientists [that\'s you, George!] 
may have the details on this), a satellite program developed a bug 
because a certain 2 instruction code sequence, repeated endlessly 
in a tight loop, actually caused dopant migration in the substrate, 
changing the electronics of the transistor.

Third, though the Virus can be present only as software, its
normal form is that of a living semiconductor chip, a gene-tailored
version of the silicon lifeforms of Cymbelline.  Those lifeforms had
the ability to crawl up to another chip, and consume/subsume it
into themselves, and use it as raw material to make more little chipoids.
The Virus can do that if in actual physical contact with the hardware.

There you go.  Now do you see why I, among others, consider the
technical aspect to make more sense than the societal?  In fact,
the pocket-empire list had a wonderful time trying to figure out how to 
keep the Virus-induced crash from being SO severe that the 
New Era was 700 years later instead of the 70 years later it officially 
is -- which time is too short anyway to be the Complete Collapse of
Civilization as We Know It that GDW makes it out to be.  A severe
economic depression for 70 years, I could believe, but not this 
severe a collapse.

Frankly, the series went downhill - the last of the three is just

The first book, on the other hand, is very good, especially the first 
third, where the hero wakes up in a body bag and can\'t move, and then has 
to try and escape, when he has no memory of who he is.  The pacing 
and suspense is great - I still remember it even though I read it four

There is a key requirement for enjoyment of any fiction by any person:

	Suspension of Disbelief <add echo effect here>

The standards of what will cause this suspension vary according to the
individual and, often, to the genre.

In my case, I have a VERY bad problem with Virus.  I have more than passing
familiarity with computer technology at both theoretical and practical
levels.
Because of this I simply cannot suspend my disbelief whenever I hear about
Virus.

I don\'t have a problem with _Raiders of the Lost Ark_ because a) I\'m not an
expert on the various pieces of nonsense it incorporated into the story, and
b) because the genre is one in which overblown, overstated action and magic
are part of the tradition.  I have problems with Virus because a) I\'m an
expert in the specific field in question, and b) because the genre of "hard"
SF is traditionally supposed to be more science than fiction.  (Hell, reading
the purple prose introducing FF&S should tell you what Frank Chadwick\'s stand
on the subject is!)

So, as it exists now, I simply cannot stomach Virus.  Whenever the subject is
brought up in a T:TNE supplement or adventure I get queasy.

So I reiterate:  What PSG have people found useful to get past the technical
implausibility of Virus?

I don\'t know about the Soviets, but we spent a great deal
of money on such activities -- all very, very hush-hush, Top
Secret, probably off-budget stuff.  It\'s part of SIGINT, signals
intelligence.  The U.S.Navy had a whole rating (that\'s MOS to
you army types...) devoted to it who weren\'t allowed to even
say what their rating (Cryptological Technician) did.  They 
had a handful of major sites that did nothing but that, and
various supporting sites.  I understand that that\'s 99% of what
the NSA does to amuse itself with taxpayer\'s money.  And 
so on....

Too true! Why couldn\'t the Virus be factually based and
extrapolated from real-world technology, like those nifty

 Someone was making comments on putting armour on planes.
This brings up a  point on FF& S. It only provides 1 type of armour
at any tech level.  Bonded superdense is great unless you want
to be a aircraft or speeder. Then you turn into a lead sled, or
end up with huge powerplant to power the device. Surly high
tech levels have come up with a light wieght alloy that provides
reasonable armour.  Perhaps you could use the preceeding
armour technology for a current version of a alloy.....
 Here could be a potential example:
TL 12 lightwieght Crystaliron alloy - Toughness 7 Mass 7.5 Cost .042
Compared to bonded superdense it would be half the
toughness, half the mass and triple the cost. Any
thoughts?

 I have been working on writing up the striker campaign I
recently ran. One of the things I want to come up with for
my next campaign are rules for transporting ground forces
in spacecraft.   One of the basic questions is how many
vehicles can I fit in a Far Trader cargo hold? I came up with this
for a first attempt....
  1. Strike load- "Ready to roll out the cargo ramp
      when the ship lands and enter combat" Take the M3 of the
      vehicle and times it by 2.  (landing in the middle of a
      armored division is still not recommended)
  2. Combat load "Some parts on vehicles may
      be removed to save space. (antennas, external
      weapons etc. Plus no real space between vehicles
      etc.  The cargo is loaded so that each ship has
      what is needs to supply the equipment it carries
      From unloading to combat ready should take
      24 to 48 hours. Take the M3 and times it by 1.5.
  3. Merchant load- Everything is packed to save
      space with no regard to combat use. All equipment
      that can save space by being broken apart will be.
      Use the M3 as listed. From landing to combat ready should
      take upwards of 7 to 10 days.

    Note that the wasted space in 2 and 3 would be used for
    smaller gear and ammo. These numbers assume that
    the vehicle is less than 3 meters high so that is will fit
    in a standard cargo hold.  The strike load multiplier
    can be 1.5 if a landing craft designed for armored
    vehicles is used instead of a cargo ship.  Any
    (friendly) comments are welcome. Next - Supplies

More or less.  Assuming that there is any type of security system in place,
the Virus on computer A will have to convince, cajole, or otherwise trick
computer B to allow it sufficient access to do what it wants.

For some computers, this should be relatively easy - for others hard or
impossible.  Even the best sentient cracker can\'t breach every computer
every time, particularly when the security system is set up to be properly
paranoid.  Of course, even in the Far Future, there will likely be many
computer systems that aren\'t properly paranoid - presumably the Virus will
be able to gain access to many - and perhaps even a majority - of the
systems it encounters.

This is a very good point, and certainly would make an interesting Traveller
plotline.  However, I don\'t think it provides an explanation for the Virus
and Collapse as postulated by GDW.  There are a couple of reasons why, even
with the computer technology you postulate, the Virus is still (to me, at
least) rather unbelievable:

The first is that a society that has used this technology for any
significant length of time should be VERY aware of the possible risks from
viruses, and take strong measures to defend their computer systems from just
this kind of attack.  Undoubtedly the designers had many years of experience
with various kinds of attack on their systems, including \'virus\' programs
that attempt to reprogram the computer.  Accordingly, Imperial computer
systems
would have incorporated many security measures intended to prevent such an
occurence, detect it if it did occur, isolate the infected node, and prevent
the damage from spreading.

Even more important, to my mind, is that Charted Space is a large, diverse
area.  It stretches my credibility a _lot_ to postulate that every computer
manufactured in the Imperium, from about TL-7 through TL-15, and whether
designed on Terra, Vland, or Glisten and intended to control equipment from
automatic forklifts to starships, military or civillian uses the same
architecture and is vulnerable enough to a Virus like you describe.  

It exceeds the capacity of my suspension of disbelief to postulate that the
Hivers, the Aslan, the K\'Kree, and the Vargr also used this very same 
architecture and technology, with the same security flaws as the Imperium,
and therefore suffered a corresponding Virus infection.

What amazes me about the whole "Official Line" from GDW is how unbelievable
their line is: that this Virus clobbered every computer in known space,
killing 90% of the population of the Imperium and plunging worlds into a
dark age so deep that 60 years later, the grandchildren of Imperial spacers
(mostly) didn\'t believe the \'legends\' of their ancestor\'s interstellar
exploits.  And that 10 years after _that_, worlds are building starships
again?  Really, now!

A _much_ more realistic scenario is possible, and doesn\'t change the
overall story much.  Start with the state of Known Space at the end of Hard
Times - things are pretty bad by that point, but are beginning to look as if
they will stabilize.  If some significant fraction of Imperial computer
systems were of the design Cynthia described above, and the Virus operated
as she described, this would knock out the majority of those computers.  I
don\'t think it\'s too much of a stretch to propose that the reconfigurable
comptuers were produced primarily for the civillian starship market, this
would knock out a sizeable fraction of the commercial ships, and
particularly those few ships which still ventured into the Wilds. 

This would cause the remaining Safes to contract further, and become totally
isolated from one another, separated by wide belts of Astra Incognita.  Its
also not unreasonable that the Domain of Deneb was spared - communication
betewen Deneb and the rest of the ex-Imperium was already effectively cut,
and the few copies of the virus which did make it through were sufficient
for Deneb to develop new safeguards for their computer equipment.

Of course, in this scenario, non-Imperial races would be hit considerably
less hard than the Imperium itself, with the possible exception of the
Solomani (particularly if the computer architecture in question were a
Solomani innovation).  This would have some interesting consequences,
though: instead of areas separating the Safes being totally devoid of
starfarers, one would encounter Vampires as well as the occasional Vargr (in
coreward areas), Aslan (mainly to the rim-spinward), and a Hivers
(rim-trailing), and K\'Kree (trailing).  Any of these encounters should be
relatively rare (after all, there\'s very little in those areas left that\'s
worth going after).

It would also be quite interesting to note that each of these races would be
doing its own thing within the boundaries of the Former Imperium.  Aslan
would be settling inviting worlds, while leaving most other locations alone.
Furthermore, they probably wouldn\'t venture too far towards the safes - why
should they, when suitable worlds in the Wilds are there for the taking.
Vargr would undoubetdly do many interesting Vargr-like activities, including
scavenging, perhaps raiding, and certainly limited settlement.  The K\'Kree
would likley set up a deep buffer zone between their worlds and
human-inhabited space, while the Hivers would probably do exactly what
they\'re doing in the New Era: setting up little polities whenever they
discover a ripe cluster of worlds, and then manipulating them for their own
ends.

Actually the two make no sense at an equal level.

> Item (2) is easy -- the two computers merely have to be in communication.

My computer is currently in communication with another one through a serial
link.  I challenge ANYONE, ANYWHERE (Bulgarian Underground Hackers
included!) to infect me.  I\'ll leave the link up for as long as they like.

The fact is that my computer simply does not execute any data sent from the
remote system unless I explicitly do so.  It takes my direct actions to
infect this computer system the way it is right now.

Also, I challenge anyone to write a program whose binaries will run both on
my PC here and on my AIX workstation at work.  The architectures of the two
machines, starting from the CPU and working through peripheral interfaces
and operating systems, are so radically different that I\'m pretty sure that
no single binary file could be a valid executable on both systems.  (I can\'t
confirm this for certain -- I don\'t know the executable formats on both
sides.  I do know, however, that the instruction sets of the PowerPC and the
80386 are VERY different...)  The potential avenues for unresolvable
differences go up exponentially for each type of machine you try to build
a "universal binary" for.  (Hell, I\'m pretty sure that it\'s not possible to
build a single executable which is valid for my machine running OS/2 and my
machine running Linux...)

This is nonsense.  Computer B would have to allow computer A to execute
code directly.  Not all communications links allow this.  (The one I\'m using
to collect my mail and news, for instance...)

Since it is the transmission medium I have difficulties with (not to mention
architectural incompatibilities), I can\'t imagine Virus getting loose in that
circuitry.

Not in any deterministic way.  You could not change the microcode of a
Pentium, for instance, to be a completely different microcomputer using this
sort of technique.  It would become an untenable computer long before you
managed to change it into a different processor.

Virus spread through transponder systems, not through physical contact.  Or
did these silicon life forms have the ability to "crawl" through radio (or
whatever) waves?

These are two more problems with TNE -- ones which I would have dealt with by
simply putting the timeline forward by several centuries had I decided to run
a TNE campaign in that setting.

It was this combination of many technical options and the unfeasible
Virus that made me design my own campaign setting.

First, I had been getting tired of the Jump Drive, so I replaced it
with Starfire-like naturally occuring warp points and combined FF&S\'
"keyhole" drives into it.  Warp points, in general, only require
rudimentary gravitics to utilise -- mainly as compensators for the
bizarre tidal stresses. Many warp points were one-way and had a
"closed" end, however.  Starting at tech level 11, devices could be
built which allowed warp transitions from the closed end. Taking tips 
from Babylon 5, these "keyhole" drives were absolutely enormous to begin
with, and were horrendously expensive at any tech level.  Thus only VERY
large, VERY expensive ships could mount them.

The flexibility and extensibility of FF&S made designing a whole
universe\'s technology pretty simple, actually.  I\'m still working on
getting the ludicrous engagement distances of Brilliant Lances fixed
up, though.  Lasers shouldn\'t be effective (as weapons) much beyond 
planetary orbital ranges.  This changes the face of starship combat
drastically...

   A fine idea.  It\'s much like one that was raised for small arm

If you have access to some chips, yes. In the _official_ universe we are
told that you can\'t get hold of those chips, because they are fried to a
crisp if anyone tries to open one of those tamperproof boxes. So no chips
to begin with.

We know that it took the Imperium 20 years to do so, because we are told
so in _Survival Margin_.

Does the word \'captivity\' have any sort of connotations to you? It dosen\'t
quite bring the phrase "having established themselves comfortably in exile"
to my mind. For a counterexample I\'ll give you the Jews in Egypt now that
we\'ve turned to biblical myths. (Mind you, I admit that if I had The One 
True God breathing down my neck and telling me to get back where I belonged
then I would be willing to leave anything behind and try to get back home.
Otherwise, well, I\'d want a guarantee of a pay rise when I got there...

If you were right then that would be a terrible problem for the Home rulers.
The logistics of repatriating the people of Home would be a nightmare. It
takes the entire naval taxes of 2,494,800 people for ten years to finance 
the building of a ship similar to the Aslan transport on page 88 of 
_Rebellion Sourcebook_. That is a jump-3 transport with room for 10,000
(low berth) passengers. A round trip from Home to Terra and back carrying
10,000 people will take 20 jumps. Figuring 10 days per jump on the average,
no, let\'s make it 9 days, that\'s half a year. At a rate of 20,000 people
per year it would take 125 years to transfer them all.

Mind you, it would be an incredibly good thing for those fortunate few that 
were left in possesion of the beautiful Home when all the fanatics went home.

Harold, fanatics are created by suffering, either your own or that of
someone with who you can identify. The Zionists of Scandinavia were
working on behalf of fellow jews who DID have a hard time. I defy you to
find an example of any people who were reasonably well off in exile who
were really seriously fanatic about returning.

Not my question, at least. I have made all the sense of the official
storyline I need by making up a Grand Adventure that gives the PCs a
fighting chance to save (most of) the Imperium. Wether they will pull
it off remains to be seen.

Well, I\'ll start off by saying I don\'t actually have ANY TNE products,
so I haven\'t read the descriptions of what the virus is supposed to be.
However, it seems to be a cross between software "infection" and
rogue Cymbeline chips getting loose from some super-duper ship
transponders.

Someone else suggested that it might be possible to make
software-reconfigurable
hardware using PLA and FPGAs and other EE acronyms. This make the virus
somewhat more plausible as once it gets a little foothold, it could
turn your model 9/bis into a bazillion C-64s if it wanted to - or do
anything else it wants.

Hm. Well, neither to machines on the Internet, right? But the Morris
Internet worm got lots of machines, of varying hardware architectures
to run its code. How? By logging on, compiling it and running it.
Sneaky, eh? OK, they were almost all UNIX systems, if not all. To me,
when I heard about it, I really thought it couldn\'t be true - but it 
was. Just because YOUR TL 7/8 computer may be reasonably secure against
"the virus" doesn\'t mean other computers are just as secure. Especially
those computers who run something more complex than DOS or other
terminally single-user setups.

Hm. Well, they have binaries that run on PowerPCs and original Macs. How?
They stuff two programs into one file. This is a big gross hack (IMHO) and
the operating systems does have to know about it, but in principle, you
could do it for any two systems. It wouldn\'t be easy and it might require
some bizzareness, but it could probably be done for any two different
systems.

Huh, actaully, this might be easier than building the aforementioned
PowerPC/AIX binary, as you can modify Linux. :) Just do the same thing -
stuff the two binaries into one big mess of a file, with it looking
like an OS/2 binary by default and have Linux recognize OS/2 bins
and go find it\'s own Linux code inside them.

Also, I think the TNE virus is more than the simple viruses you find
around today - it doesn\'t just infect your boot sector and pop up
"gimmie cookie" on the screen every few minutes - it is supposed to
be somewhat intelligent, isn\'t it?

So, I think the virus COULD spread, but the rate at which it seems to have
infected everything seems much less believable.

    'index' => 'ao597',
    'body' => ' Okay, I tried to stay out of this one as long as I could, but it
seems that many of us have forgotten some of the primary premises
behind Virus.

    1.  The Deyo chip was an adaptation of a silicon-based LIFE-FORM
       from from Cymbeline.  This being is amorfous in many ways and
       is capable of learning, replication and expansion.  Very much
       like a parasitic virus that was its progeny (Several sources
       including an old adventure <I don\'t remember the name, but it
       came out about the same time as the Chamax Plague.>).

    2.  Transponders are not just used for ship identification.
       As explained in one of the first TNE publications, they were
       used for transferring library data, updated astrogation
       information, cargo manifests and program updates.  This
       massive communications took place without outside
       intervention and anytime two vessels or transponder equipped
       entities (governments, ships, stations...) came in contact
       with each other.  Military vessels had the luxury of an off
       switch,

These two premises are combined (about 1120?) into a system of data
exchange that allowed fast, efficient spread of knowledge throughout
known space.  (Remember Library Data) With the Deyo chip in charge,
much of the communications took place without human knowledge.  Deyo
to Deyo exchanges were optimized such that it would be almost
impossible for organics to decode their language.  As the Deyo was
almost a community unto itself, that language would evolve
continuously.

Transmission of Virus was carried out in two main manners.

    1.  RF communications: In this manner, program updates and
       modifications would probably go unnoticed.  From personal
       experience, a programmed virus can spread throughout a
       community like wildfire, striking thousands of machines
       simultaneously when activated.  Many time there is no clue to
       the source and many virii can slip right past the best
       anti-virus software and hardware.  The argument that a virus
       linked with data are forgetting point 2 above, and if you
       think that because your computer speaks a different language,
       you are safe forgets that the Deyo is an intelligent
       life-form that is operating in it\'s native environment.  Of
       course, by rebooting the system or using a primative enough
       system (an IBM Pentium might be safe for example due to its
       lack of sophistication and Cymbeling technology).
    2.  Physical contact: The Deyo is a living entity (it\'s not
       carbon-based and therefore not an organism) which learns,
       feeds and replicates.  In the introductory adventure, it had
       the abilit y to interface with, enhance or control normal
       silicon-based electronics (an optically based system,
       therefore, would also be immune).  Once it is within physical
       contact with the "standard" computer system, it could and
       would act just like a biological virus, feeding off of and
       modifying the existing system.  (How much data and
       programming can be stored in a single DNA strand?)

C ombine the above two transmission modes with the original premises.
Strip a rival transponder to find out what platform is being used.
Broadcast the programming portion of infection and sit around until
it activates and disables the opponent.  Gain physical access to the
target and insert a small portion of Deyo.  Wait for the child to
grow up.

Well, that\'s the scenario I have been using in my campaigns.  Maybe
it will clarify someone\'s ideas or help to develop others.  As for
the social aspect of Virus, I\'ll save that for a later discussion.

   SIGNIT folks study all frequencies in an attempt to establish who\'s
using what.  They also try to break codes and analyze radio traffic.
They were primarily responsible for the Americans stunning victory
at the Battle of Midway, IM (and many historians) HO.  Does this mean
they were specifically looking for Soviet transponder codes?  Only they
(the SIGINT guys) can tell us for sure.  Another good question which
I know no one is allowed to answer even if they were looking for them:
did they succeed in finding them?


John Kovalic says about transponders:

   Good point.  How about this--why is it neccessary to use iron for
the process?  Could elements with a lower atomic weight be used,
such as titanium or aluminum?  How about composites,  perhaps a
superdense graphite?

   All that would be neccessary would be for computer B to allow
computer A the capability to download things in something other than
the TL 15 equivilent of ASCII.  Binary transfers (or the TL 15 equivilent)
went on all the time in the Imperium and elsewhere without human or
sapient supervision.  It was assumed that existing computers were
sophisicated enough to detect anything out of the ordinary and deal
with the problem, or inform someone or even another computer of a
possible infection.  Virus was programmed to get by all known
anti-viral programs, and could even "play dead" if it had to until active
attempts to clear it from a system ceased.

   True, but Virus was (is) extremely patient, and would catch many
systems while their guard was down.  Remember, the Imperium was
a highly automated society, so systems can\'t be too paranoid, least
people get POed with them and buy something else with less of an
attitude.

   The Virus used whatever mode of operation worked best for it at the
moment.  Remember you are talking about a sapient creature, with the
ability to learn and improvise and acccumulate knowledge over each
succeeding generation.  The tricks it pulled on people its first month in
exsistence wouldn\'t work as well the second time it swept through an
area, so it would employ new methods.  

   Also, the Virus didn\'t destroy every single computer system in the
Imperium.  There are worlds no doubt that have a completely functional
TL whatever computer net available to whoever shows up with a life
support system (which was wiped out  by the Virus when it erased all
the operations software and fried  the environmental controls) and a
power supply (to replace the one destroyed when a Virus-infected ship
took a swan dive into the one functioning fusion power plant left on the
world after Hard Times).  Many systems simply stopped working due to a
lack of spare parts (interstellar trade having been effectively snuffed
out--it\'s hard to build serious circuitry out of "stone knives and bear
skins, ask a certain Vulcan  :)  ).  Still others may have been functional
right up to the day that the local TEDs decided to canabalize them for
spare electronic components for their grav tanks, or were victims of
"collatoral damage" in one of the many civil wars that racked worlds
throughout the Imperium during the era after the Collapse.  Even today,
there are pocket empires here and there using some of the same
equipment they were in 1130--and have begun making crude copies
of it as they establish a new technological baseline from which to
start the next generation of computer equipment.

   Again, the Virus can improve and learn.  It might take some time for
it to figure out Aslan computer standards, but it would with a vengence.

   That figure varies from sector to sector, subsector to subsector,
and even world to world.  Some worlds have populations larger now
than before the Collapse.

   Only those worlds that survived as part of a pocket empire, or are
getting outside assistance (i.e. the Hivers)  in their recovery.

   Virus would arrive at your system\'s doorstep as something that looked
totally harmless.  After you let it in, whaam!  Assuming that you didn\'t
fall for that, maybe it would just skip your computer and go wipe out
the system that control the local power plant.  Hope you have a good
generator.

   Probably can\'t but you\'re assuming that things like seperate system
architectures for PCs and workstations exist at TL 15 or 14 or 13 or 12
or 11....  You seem to be stuck on what your system can and can not do
now.  Hell, the space shuttle can\'t get jump to Alpha Centauri and back
in two weeks, yet I\'m sure you buy off on FTL travel.  Why can\'t your
imagination work that well in envisioning computer technology in the
future?

   Once again, with feeling.  While the transponder systems were the
primary means by which the Virus spread on an interstellar level, it was
by no means the only way.  The Virus initially existed in "hardwired"
form (on a chip), but their offspring (copies not the original) could exist
in whatever form (hardwired or as software) best suited its purpose.

	I\'m engaged in designing an alternate world somewhat similar to 
your own.  I\'d be particularly interested to see what you come up with 
for ship designs to account for these shorter range lasers.  Are you 
using gravitic focusing at all?  How about meson guns?  I haven\'t been 
using either, and, in general, I\'ve found it makes for large, heavily 
armored ships with several large laser bays along the sides of the ship 
(to accomodate the focal arrays).  It also makes missiles much more 
important.  I\'ve also been fiddling with changing the time and space 
scale for BL because at the range you mentioned above, most of the action 
takes place within a single hex.  How have you handled this?

TL15 50-ton MFD Missile Bay
----
Volume:   700 kL        Mass: 317.856 metric tons (709.856 tons loaded)
Power:      6.84 MW     Crew:   4
Price: MCr 36.3544      Surface Area: 91.2 square meters
MFDs have +6 Diff Mod.

Four high-speed launch systems for 7 kL missiles are installed in the bay.
Each includes a launcher, a mechanical reloader with eleven launch cradles,
and a gunner\'s workstation equipped with a 300 Mm laser communicator and
a 300 Mm MFD with pencil-beam AEMS.  The bay also includes a magazine for
storing eight more missiles, and 5.972 kL of space for customization.  One
custom possibility is a small fusion plant and fuel tank to run the bay.

The bay contains 56 missiles, of which 48 are loaded to fire; the bay may
fire 40 missiles in any turn and can control up to 24 of them.  If the bay
fires no faster than 16 missiles a turn, it may fire continuously until 
the ship\'s magazine is exhausted; at 24 per turn it can fire for two turns,
then needs to spend one to reload.  To fully load the bay and the bay\'s
local magazine with standard TNE TL15 det-laser missiles would cost MCr 70.

NOTES:

It turns out that it\'s more volume-efficient to use a launcher/reloader 
system if over five missiles are installed, and the system is also much
cheaper than an all-launcher system.

A larger bay could use a seventeen-cradle system for each launcher, which 
could fire as many missiles as it could control every turn until the ship
ran out of missiles.

Most of the cost and power requirement of the bay is caused by the four
local MFDs and the pencil-beam AEMS.  The reason that they\'re installed
here is that any ship with this bay will need them, and by giving them
to the gunners I\'m reducing bridge crew by four.  Lower tech missile bays
can easily be built by using space from the local magazine to make up the
difference in the additional bulk of the electronic equipment.  More MFDs
could be installed on the bridge to enable massive single-round missile
salvos, maximum at eight additional MFDs per three bays, allowing control
of all 40 missiles the bay may fire per turn; of course, pauses would be
needed to reload at this firing rate.

The surface area was assumed to be exactly the same as a 50-ton laser
bay. 1 Mm == 1000 km.

I developed a list of materials for use in a alternate setting

35 different materials going up to tech level 13.  If there is
sufficient interest I can post it to the TML group and the gdw-beta

group...assuming there\'s sufficient interest.

Very true.  Just in the 15 years that I have worked with computers there
has been a dramatic change of software controlling more and more
of the hardware. Try to find a dip switch on a 486 motherboard. They
have been replaced by "software settings" . Certainly by TL10 you
would have motherboards that were completely configurable by
software. The cost  savings would be enormous. A few computer
boards could be used for 80 to 90% of all computer needs. Now infect
a latent hardware chip with the virus in the manufacturers board. The boards
are shipped all over the imperium. Wait for the radio signal...Poof! instant
dark ages.
   Someone mentioned about different operating systems. , unusual computers, 

low tech computers would be very difficult to infect. The virus would be 
lucky to shut
the computer down or perhaps erase the software.  High tech computers if
infected would be very dangerous  with the silicon virus. The
lifeform could reconfigure the computer for  its own means.  Think about it.
Can\'t communicate?  reconfigure the laser designator to be a communicator...
 Can\'t win. wait tell the ship is entering the atmosphere of a planet and 
short circuit
 the computer system. Can\'t get through the security gateway?Take over the 
environmental
controls and shut it down, Remember this virus was designed by people who 
knew
the imperium computer network. They knew what the back doors were. They
had the military codes etc...  I heard rumors that IRAQ had viruses that
infected their system from eproms that were put into printers... When you
have the resources of an empire the virus could have been designed
to bypass 90% of imperium security codes.  Even after the break up
little would change to protect the new empires.......
I guess I have babbled enough...

   Something the pilots like. :-)  They like even more

   A fine idea.  It\'s much like one that was raised for small arm
design.  Alloy for the receiver, hard steel for the barrel, plastic for
the stock and magazines.

   I like it!  The cost can be justified by a performance aircraft.

	Uhhh...one silly question...why are you using TL7-8 computers in
3000-something?  Of coiurse, we don\'t have the technology that would
be affected by this thing, but where does the rationale that
computer systems at TL12 work the same as those at TL 7-8 come from?
 Your objections to Virus being unable to infect computers based on
current systems standards is a little like saying (in 1942) GUI\'s
are impossible because the coding necessary on Eniac I is physically
impossible, or that floating point arithmetic errors are impossible
on Pentuims (aka the 80586.874456 ;-) because the gearing on your
Babbage difference engine is too precise to allow that (in 1890).

	Finally, if you read TNE, that\'s pretty much how they did end up 
running systems on ships to avoid virus infections (that truly dumb 
trhing about having a human type in codes from one computer to 
another to run a starship.  Yikes! IMHO that\'s more unbelievable than 
Virus.  Something like an active immune system (those \'domesticated\' 
Viruses of the Hivers) are much more reasonable.

	This  is a bit afield, but Wired Magazine (the february issue, I
think It\'s got a sort of Conan the Barbarian pastiche on the cover
mostly in orange tones) has an interesting article about computer
viruses. Now the article is written in the typical Wired \'I\'m so
goddamn hip you should need dark shades to gaze upon my visage\'
style, but there are some very interesting nuggets of information,
particularly about the possibilities of using viral produced code as
a \'software farm\'.  Apparently, in an artificial environment, self
mutating software viruses can produce some very efficient code.

	Extrapolate that into several tech levels higher than today, add in 
solid state life forms, and I don\'t think it\'s at all unlikely that 
something like Virus could exist. However, I do agree that the 
timescale in TNE is absurdly short...a couple of hundred years would 
be a better timescale for the Collapse into the Wilds, particularly 
if part of the Virus problem is \'life-hating\' Berserker ships, or 
fleets of them.  Go back and read Fred Saberhagen\'s Berserker stories 
to find out what (IMO) Vampire ships and fleets would be like.

First off the point is not that a virus would infect your computer. (a 
personal
workstation). The point is that the virus affect the banking,miltitary,etc 
systems.
A large corporation or miltitary by definition needs common means to
communicate and exchange data .(not just E-mail). The "information highway"
is mostly about bussiness exchanging data at a unparallel rate. As tech 
levels
increase the entire world would become (more or less) a networked system
net. Sure there would be security systems and some of them did work, but
look at the current battle of security verses hackers. Virus detection works
great agianst a old virus, but a really new design of a virus still causes 
fits.
Sure computers now have many levels of security , but most company
computers managers still never bother to change the root password
that came out of the box. Backdoors and security holes exist in about
every major system. If simple security was enough why do top secret
military systems remain isolated from \'any\' outside contact?  For the
virus to have its effect I doubt is would have to have infected over
30% of any one world\'s computers to reek havoc. I think current
hackers would agree they could get into 30% of the systems.
One infected starship plunging into a capital city would destroy alot of
 "isolated" computers or even personal computers. :-) Even if the isolated
systems survived the impact of the virus on the economic structure would
still cause things tofall apart.

Well, I\'m working (slowly though..) on detailing Apollo (0436/Aubiane).  
It\'s an intersting world.  A TL 8 boneyard with 4000 people 
digging around for TL 11 equipment, all this on a world with an 
atomosphere rating of C..   I\'m still working on the star system itself, 
and didn\'t touch any else yet.

If you need any help, let me know.

The number of architectures, both software and hardware, has been

I can buy off on FTL travel and not on Virus for two reasons:

1) I am not intimately familiar with the physics which makes it impossible.
I can thus very comfortably ignore the silliness.  I am intimately familiar
with the technology field VIrus supposedly operates in.  I cannot,
therefore, as comfortably drop it.  That, combined with the social
stupidities surrounding Virus, means I simply cannot suspend disbelief
when Virus is mentioned.

2) FTL travel is a strong, traditional component of SF.  I have plenty of
"case law" from past reading which has brought FTL travel into the norm.
(Besides, lets face it -- SF games would be pretty damned boring without
"the wonders of interstellar space"!)  Virus is weak in tradition and adds
no new, fascinating plot potentials which couldn\'t be used without it.  If
you don\'t believe me, read in the RISKS forum just what sorts of horror
stories are possible with our current, primitive (by Traveller standards)
technology...

I do not use gravitic focusing as this requires much better gravitic
technology than I postulate being possible for my setting.  Meson guns are
in the questionable status.  (The issue hasn\'t come up yet, so I\'ve been
putting off this particular decision.)  Your ship designs coincide roughly
with mine, although the lasers tend to be in remote devices instead of in
bays on ships.  (Manpower, as always, is EXPENSIVE!)  Since I haven\'t
considered much above the anti-pirate Corvettes in size yet, I haven\'t
been too careful in my assessments of technology...

The BL stuff I ignore and resort to the "dramatic tactical system".  I keep
an eye out toward orbital mechanics, et. al. and then make judicious use of
tactical rolls and player descriptions to assess difficulties and outcomes.
(I\'ve always found BL to be WAY too time consuming for RPG starship combat!)
Since starship combats are not a vital part of my campaign, I don\'t feel the
need to write up complex rules variants to handle them.

(You should have seen my first draught of the campaign setting.  I didn\'t
even allow for high-G acceleration over long periods of time.  The primary
in-system drive was...  brace yourself...  solar sails!  A few calculations
and a few kicks to my head from my players convinced me to ditch this
concept!:-)

I have a question on what type of ships would fit under
the categories of configuration in FFS. What is a close 
structure configuration, where would you place the Star Trek
ship USS Enterprise. 

Does anyone have any rules for desiding configuration on ships
whith two different hullforms.

Any ideas are appreciated.

You\'d better make damn sure your Tigresses are Virus-proof, or the Domain
could have a nasty surprise when they return...

GUYS! GUYS! (and Gals as the case may be.)

	This is just a RPG, Don\'t get too blown out of shape by all this so 
call PSG.  If you don\'t like something, change it.  Further if you can come 
up with a better version of VIRUS, so be it.  I leave it to the true 
computer architects out there to come up with a better version of VIRUS, 
and all it\'s related histories.  Develope this, and refine it, and who 
knows perhaps you\'ll have something that the rest of us will drool over.  
Till then either take virus out of your campaigns (there is no ruling 
against that!) or ignore it.  Also don\'t be so quick to judge what will be 
plausible in hundreds of years, after all if I showed a 1 mill candle power 
spot light to the people of Norman England in the 1100\'s theyd never 
believe it was just science.  After all the Normans believed that the Roman 
acqueducts were giant tubes to feed god.  So get your brain-pans humming, 
and either come up with a better idea, or just leave it be, but don\'t gripe 
about it do something about it. ;)

I have no idea what GDW is planning for in the future: after all, if they 
were so silly as to create virus...

However, I will say that there are only two reasons why the Regency 
WOULDN\'T rebuild the Third Imperium...

A) The Zhodani don\'t want them to.
   I suspect that this is unlikely.  The Zhodani can\'t be threatened by 
the Regency anymore -- they have too few high-tech worlds to fight the 
Consulate -- and letting them rebuild the Imperium gives those restless 
Imperials something to do.  Even if they succeed, they can never catch 
up to Zho tech levels and populations (ie. see the U.S. vs. The Soviet
Union ), and may have a devil of a time keeping a xenophobic, 
fractured empire together -- and resources spent to rebuild the Imperium 
can\'t be spend building up the Jewell subsector fleet.

B) The Regency citizens don\'t want them to.
   This is the most likely possibility.  GDW may _want_ the Regency to 
ossify, stagnate, and die do the Reformation Coalition can take the place 
of the Marches.  And Regency citizens, as late as the 1190\'s, insisted 
that the Quarrentine be maintained.

   If GDW wants to, they can build around the Quarrentine - continue 
checking every ship that enters or leaves the Regency: just give the 
orders to send out the Fleet and send RQS to start purging the Wilds of 
Virus.  Or they can lower the Quarrentine de facto, by order of the 
Regent.  If a Regency decree is issued that countermands the referendum, 
you can expect a surge in the power of the Nibility, and their eventual 
re-establishment.

And the reason that doesn\'t stand up to scrutiny...

C) The Black Sphere.  This CAN\'T stop the Regency, as sidebars in 
_Survival Margin_, dated at NE 65, talk about "The ex-Black Sphere".
I do expect fighting between the Regency Fleet and the Sphere, though 
(probably led by Lucan of Borg).

> ...venture into the wilds of the former Imperium, in a similar vein to 
> the reformation.

And what\'s going to happen when a CruRon from the Regina fleet (Reserve)
meets a RCES ship?

> Maybe GDW are planning this as another source book?

They\'re making a Regency book now: I don\'t know when (or *if*: apparently 
they have changed their publishing focus from storytelling + background to 
rulebooks and equipment, as the latter sell\'s more) they plan to set up 
another sourcebook.  Most of their background material will apparently be 
published in Challange, as it\'s cheaper than publishing sourcebooks.

I expect them to publish more Alien books, however.

> What new Alien races lie spinward. 

An odd question: I suspect that any spinward races would have been 
contacted long ago by IISS.  Unless you want a complete accounting of ALL 
the races.... Again, don\'t expect GDW to spend anymore time Spinward than 
they have to: the only reason why a Regency book is even coming out is 
because of the endless screaming and wailing of pro-Imperials like me.

If you assume that the Safes - the strongholds of the fractions - buckle 
and collapse due to financial collapse and internal divisions, you can 
get a pretty good imitation Collapse.  [Near the end, Dulinor\'s fraction 
was starting to divide against itself...] However, there would be somewhat 
more pocket empires than is offical, and more high-tech systems, too.  
Fewer vacumn worlds would have died.  All in all, a more interesting 
universe than the Offical Version. {Of course, that ain\'t saying much}

I fully expect that ALL Regency ships, naval and merchant, have been 
extensively Virus-proofed.  Also, RQS would have promoted the 
Virus-proofing of most [eventually _all_] of the Regency systems, esp.major 
systems like like Vincennes (TL G), Mora (Capital of the Regency, TL F), 
Tobia (TL G), and Trin (TL F).

system and thus was (or is you have a pre virus ship) highly
prone  to failure should a virus enter therein.  Post  virus
ships  are  now  de-centralized.  There are many  computers,
each with semi separate power systems.  (I would assume  the
computers  run off of batteries which in turn are  recharged
by   the   main  power  systems  but  do  not  allow   power
fluctuations to influence the computers.)

Pre  virus  systems also relied on an old tech level  system
called  the  "network" a single medium where  data,  program
upgrades, messages, would pass along a single communications
system.  Even the X-boat system formed a kind of network  in
which  program  updates routinely accompanied  news  briefs.
This  was one way in which the virus spread.  My post  virus
systems are still linked but specifically so.  If the engine
computer  needs  the  jump coordinates from  the  navigation
computer,  then  a  specific connection, (let\'s  call  it  a
channel)  is  made  between the two  computers.   Since  the
engine computer is only expecting the jump coordinate,  then
anything  else entered in would ether be garbage  or  a  bad
jump  coordinate.  If the nav computer got a virus, you  may
still  mis-jump (true even if you have human voices  between
the  two  computers) but the engine computer  would  not  be
infected.

Anyway  these  are my own two credits on the  virus  thingy,
which I think would have been a good idea if they thought it
out  a  little  more through before they waved  the  "magic"
wand.

   As previously stated, Loren Wiseman is the official company man
around here. When he speaks, it#s as official as anything is likely to get.
When I speak, I#m giving you my spin on TNE.  The vast majority of the
time (85-95 percent), it is in accordance with what GDW, Inc. has to say.
On those rare occasions that it is not, I give you what I think makes
sense.  I compose my posts to this mailing list at my keyboard and fire
them off after a quick spell check.  Only rarely do I have Traveller
reference material on hand at the time I#m writing my response.
Therefore, when I say it, it#s probably right, but when Loren says it,
it is gospel.  Is that enough of a disclaimer?

   No self-destruct mechanism is fool-proof.  It might be a Formidable
task (electronics, demolitions, and whatever other skill might apply)
but not an impossible (note small #I#) one.

   Because they were working from ground zero.  Anyone who

   But by the time they were ready to move back, they had done just that.
Also while they were in exile, they picked up on this new idea about
how God had created everything in six days.

   No myth, the Jews really did migrate.  The #why# part is a bit
unclear from the historical (non-Biblical) perspective in the case of
Egypt.  One account I\'m aware of had them as apart of a group of
Semitic tribesmen that invaded the region (thus Moses really would
have been an Egyptian prince), but were later kicked out.

   Quite simply not everyone who wants to go will be able to go.  Also,
since Terra was near the edge of a war zone, and there was a war on,
getting transportation back there would be extremely difficult unless
you had connections within the Confederation government or had
enough money to buy a means of transportation there. The mass exodus
to Terra, had there ever been one, would have had to wait until after the
Second Solomani Rim War was over.  The Virus prevents this (and many
other things) from happening.

   The Zionists of Scandinavia (and elsewhere) formed organizations
to help protect their people from prejudice.  Here in the U.S. there is a
group is called the Jewish Defense Organization.  Along with its mission
of protecting Jews, it provides teaching and information about the
Jewish faith and encourages Aliyah, or immigration to Israel.

   The Cubans in southern Florida, so far as I know, are still planning
on having a major party in the streets of Havana the day after Castro
dies.

Bob Brown writes about Norris and the Regency:

   The Regency is in an excellent position to reestablish the Imperium.
Norris was arguably one of the best statesman in human history, and he
was able to see his territories through two major invasions and the
Virus.

Two thoughts leap to mind, however....

   Is the current Regent as capable?  Just because Grandpa was a great
leader doesn#t mean that the grandson/granddaughter is even one tenth
as competent.  A number of former kingdoms (and current ones) in
Europe  (and other select locations) will testify to that fact.

   The assumption is that the peoples of the old Imperium *want* to
be part of a new one.  It is quite possible that the Regency will
run across many worlds that aren#t interested in joining, the
Reformation Coalition being one group I can name immediately.
It would take some interesting circumstances for those two groups
to see eye to eye long enough to form a political alliance.

  Perhaps, but today I can plug a DOS disk in my Mac, and ten years
ago that feat was impossible.  Also, I can create a document in
MacWrite, save it to a DOS disk, bring it up the next day for editing
in Microsoft Word, and then print it that evening using WordPerfect.
While the number architectures may be increasing in 1995, they are
also becoming increasing compatible.  Who is to say one day they
won#t all merge?

   One word: Einstein.  Basically you don#t have to know all that much
about physics it know that unless he was at least partially incorrect
in his analysis, we are stuck at sublight speeds.  Modern science-fiction
gets around the problem with #wormholes#, #jumpspace#, #hyperspace#,

Einstein may have been correct for the most part, but this is what we
discovered (fill in the blank) years later that made FTL travel possible#.

   That#s precisely what I#m implying.  You seem too ground in what
that device can do in front of you now, as opposed to what a similar,
much more advanced device could do for you thousands of years from
now.

   We are all of course entitled to our own humble opinions here, and
as I have said of another subject area, if the #Official# line of
thinking is doesn#t exactly match up with what you had in mind, then
take the TNE manual and go out and create a universe that does

you didn#t like the way the story #ended#.

Similarly, if you\'re an astronomer you\'ll have problems with the star system
generation; biologists have problems with the animal encounter system;
engineers can pick holes in any of the equipment design systems, etc.

So what?  The purpose of the rules is to produce something that _feels_

there\'s no biologist in the group I don\'t bother.  Sure, I _could_ do a
detailed energy calculation for every ecology, compute niche spaces, create
evolutionary pathways, etc., but I don\'t have the time.  

The same thing applies to Virus.  In my game, I\'ve assumed that high-tech
computers are partly synaptic and most software is grown/evolved (genetic
algorithms after several millenia of refinement); those that weren\'t taken
over by Virus severely damaged (looks at how much was controlled by computers
in MT).  It\'s a fact of (game) life, like Jump drive, and anyone who wants to
can come up with alternate expanations if they know more about computers than
me.

The key thing is that players are now required to do things, rather than
computers or skilled robots.

If Virus really turns you off, assume a crash for other reasons, or play in
the Classic or Rebellion settings, or invent your own setting.

Bingo, Rob - you\'ve just hit the nail on the head.

Anybody who\'s worked in the field of computer hardware architecture, network
design, or computer security can poke many holes in the pseudo-technical
gobbedygook behind GDW\'s Virus.  So we\'re left having to accept the virus as
a "magic" item which defies logical explanation or prediction (and therefore
ruins the basis of a hard-SF roleplaying game, just as surely as if someone
had written Alladin\'s Magic Lamp into _The Hunt for Red October_)

Or we\'d have to do as you do, and throw out most of the New Era background,
because its based on a fundamentally flawed (from our point of view) plot
device.  Unfortunately, as both the referee and the person who has
difficulty accepting the Virus, we don\'t have the option of ignoring the
problem and hoping that none of the players catch it.

On the other hand, an increasing number of people no longer know how modern
technology works, don\'t care to find out, and aren\'t bothered that they
don\'t know.  To many people (the authors of T:TNE included, perhaps?)
technology - from computers to copiers - is a kind of magic item; if one
performs the ritual incantations, the gods will smile upon you and it will
print your document.

> The key thing is that players are now required to do things, rather than

This is a very good point, and (assuming you can stomach the Virus), the
Virus does make a handy excuse for requiring the players to become much more
intimately involved in the operation of their ship.
 
> If Virus really turns you off, assume a crash for other reasons, or play in

Well, exactly.  My survey of a year ago found approximately one-third of the
purchasers of T:TNE were doing exactly that.

Which reminds me - since my email-box isn\'t full enough already, I think
it\'s time for a new survey.  (See the next message).

The Great Traveller Capmaign Survey (Mk.IIbis)


I thought it would be very interesting to re-run a survey that was quite
successful last year.  Basically, I\'d like to find out who on the list is
playing Traveller, and (generally) what "flavor" of the game you are playing.

If you PLAY or REFEREE a Traveller game, please take a couple of minutes
to respond.  I\'ll post a summary and analysis of the results to the TML once
I feel like I\'ve recieved all the responses I\'m going to get.

If you know someone who\'s not on the TML, please forward this to them
(particularly the GEnie discussion groups!).  The reply address is:
wildstar@qrc.com, or by postal mail to Guy Garnett, 14007 Eagle Ct.,
Rockville, MD, 20853 *USA*


HOW MANY Traveller campaigns do you participate in:
	As a PLAYER? 
	AS A REFEREE?

HOW OFTEN do you play Traveller?


For EACH CAMPAIGN that you participate in, WHICH RULES set do you use:
	Classic Traveller (including Starter Traveller and The Traveller Book)
	Traveller 2300 or 2300AD
	MegaTraveller
	Traveller: The New Era
	Other (some have reported playing "GURPS Traveller" in the past)

For EACH CAMPAIGN that you participate in, DESCRIBE the SETTING of the game:
	Historical 3rd Imperium (Imperial or alien, set before circa 1000)
	Classic 3rd Imperium (Imperial or alien, since circa 1000)
	Traveller 2300 or 2300AD Universe
	Imperial Rebellion Era
	Hard Times or Collapse Era
	New Era (Reformation Colaition and surrounds)
	New Era (Regency and surrounds)
	New Era (other or Pocket Empire)
	Original Campaign (comments and description welcome!)

For EACH CAMPAIGN, HOW MANY people participate?

For EACH CAMPAIGN, HOW LONG have you been playing this campaign?


Thanks, and I\'ll post the results to the TML, and mail them to anyone
who asks me for a copy ...

and should be in our hot little hands in weeks.  The Regency sourcebook has
been pushed back from spring to early summer (June according to TML gossip).

  What I\'d like to see is Aliens of the Marches, Volume I (Vargr & Aslan).
That would do me the most good personally.   My campain runs in the Spinward
Marches, post 5th FW.  No Rebellion, no Virus.  Ya just don\'t see a lot of
Hivers and Ithklur out there.  I\'ll probably have an advance order in for
the Regency Sourcebook, once the release date firms up some more.

  Another book on my wish list is FF&S II.  This is the manual that covers
some ot the vital stuff that the first one missed.  "Wet" ship design,
robots, primitive transport & genetic engineering are the topics that leap
to mind.  A good add on would be "liftwood" rules for "wet" ship design and
Ether Proppeller rules.   That should please the pith helmet crowd with only
a page or two.
  A release of FF&S (I), that is upto date with all current errata and
includes black powder *and* updated plasma/fusion rules would be welcome
also.

  Now on to Challenge articles I\'d like to see...

  Conversion rules, SPACE:1889 to House Rules.  This would probably best be
done as a series of articles.  Not only does it cater to the Pith Helmet
Crowd (tm), but it gives good background for worlds at that techlevel in the
Traveller universe (minus the liftwood and Ether Proppellers).

   Imperial uniform designs.  This has been covered in sources before, but
could use a recap in an offical GDW publication.  It would be real darn
handy for GM\'s like me and Rebellion types.   It would be useful for the
TNE/RCES types as good detail filler on reclaimed relic equipment.

   Critters.  A few pages on some basic animals.  Herd animals, work beasts,
luxury pets, riding animals, etc.  A good spot for an artist with sketchpad
full of animal beasts to provide colour to the article.

  Standards for non-Imperial governments.  The RCES types are going to run
into old Solmani stuff sooner or later.  A page or two on their standards
can put GM\'s to work churning out some basic equipment.  For example, the
standard Solmani Marine issue Gauss Rifle fired a XxYmm round and mounted a
XXmm grenade Launcher.  The Zhodani issue side armed fired a fu round and
used magazines of bar capacity.

  That\'s enough for a start.  Any suggestions?

Make that two.  The virus plot device has its problems, and it\'s not what I 
would have designed had I been in charge, but it works OK for me.  It *is* 
just a game after all.

Only if you also manage to steal the "top secret" research notes on the 
project.  Otherwise, yes you will save some time, but I wouldn\'t think 
you would save *most* of it.  But, then again, I\'m not a research 
scientist, so I could be wrong.

In the late 1950\'s, the creator of "Buck Rogers" postulated a 
weapon that he called a "ray gun" for his fictional universe.  Scientists 
of that day scoffed at the idea.  Less than five years later lasers were 
invented.

I am also "intimately familiar with the technology field Virus 
supposedly operates in."  Since I can\'t prove that something like this 
can not possibly exist, I am willing to accept it in order to advance the 
story line.

The idea of other interstellar governments tacitly accepting the black 
boxes is another matter all together.  I\'m still trying to work this out 
in such a way that I can stay fairly close to canon.  It tends to make 
integrating new information easier.

Traveller:TNE campaign. I never played much Traveller before The New
Era was released, so I was not as bothered by The Reformation
Coalition like most of the Traveller old timers were. The one thing
that has bother me is that the RC has not expanded since the release
of Traveller:TNE. Going from 11,000 star system to 15 is a major
difference.

[On a side note: I hope that GDW in Challenge magazine will have
articles or at least paragraphs in the Coalition News Service about
Planet x wanting membership or other news items that suggest
expansion of the RC]

The idea I\'m thinking about is having the RC making contact with a
pocket empire/coalition that has ideas and goals similar to the
RC. This group would be ask would be asked to join the RC, since it
has a large amount of raw material and one of the planets of this
group has a Class A or B starport.

The main problem is that this group (lets call them the Reformation
Expansion, or RE for short) is not close to the main body of the RC,
but is 12-18 jumps (at Jump 2) coreward and counter-spinward. There are
of course a few usable jump path to get to the RE, but main one that
is the safest to use is called The Corridor, or the Gauntlet (the
slang term, running the Gauntlet could mean making a run between the
RC and RE).

The RC/RE are trying to establish relations with most the inhabited 
worlds in the Corridor. Some have welcomed it, some have violently
rejected it, plus there is always the Guild.

Some RE base concepts:

Size: the number of planets in the RE should be 6 to 10 planets.

Politics: Similar to RC, but maybe for fun the planet with the Class A
starport could be Centrist, and become firm allies with Oriflamme.

Contacts with other races: My original idea was if it was coreward and
counter-spinward, the RE may have made contact with the K\'kree. But I
think I\'m maybe off on where the K\'kree empire/nation is located. What
maybe another idea is to make the RE spinward and slightly
rimward. Maybe the have made contact with the Aslan and Terra.

Vampires and virus: If the RE is more coreward, the vampire and virus
contact would probably be greater.

If you have any comments or ideas, please feel free to mail me. Also
if you like me to develop this more, please let me know.

[If GDW or anybody else likes this idea and wishes to complete it and
publish it, please do so. I doubt if I would ever do so. Since I ain\'t
a writer :-).]

In the _Rebllion Sourcebook_, in the chapter about the Zhodani, there is
brief item about the preceptions of the Zhodani about the Imperials.
It said that they were content to leave the Domain of Deneb as is, not
because of some Coreward threat, but because the Domain was no longer a
threat to them.  The reason for the hostilities originally between the
Consulate and the Imperium was simply an expansion issue.  The Consulate
felt threatened by the possibility of the Imperium expanding into their
space.  And just a side note, psionics was only an issue because of an
Imperial "psycho-history" campaign to sway public opinion against the
"perfidious Zhodani".

So, you are one of the many who missed out on the glorious Digest Modules?
Welcome the The Latecomer\'s Club!

  (Actually, I actually had a copy of both modules, but...
   well, I\'d rather not discuss it, the pain is too great!)

Loren, are you listening? 
And don\'t forget disintergraters (not covered in FF&S) and unusual 
weapons (monofilament swords is my personal hobby horse)!

(To the writer) 
Don\'t worry toomuch about Robots, it\'s coming round with Vampire Ships, 
coming out... sorry, I don\'t have a clue.

  Yes indeed. (sorry, Mr. Bonnevile, but I can\'t get my hot little hands on 
the necessary Traveller Digest\'s!)
  And, whoever is doing the graphics for this dream supplement, don\'t 
forget noble dress & court uniforms!
  Additional comment: if RC uniforms, dress, and badges are included, and 
some other neato stuff (the premiere merc outfit in the wilds, say), I 
believe that it would sell.

Well, this would be best included in a monster adventure/supplement.
One of my daydreams involve a single book, giving detailed info on four 
worlds. Say, Mora of the Regency, Aubaine in the RC, Kaggusious (the 
capital of the HubWorlds, and Capital (it makes Cold War Moscow fell 
like the sweet breath of summer!)

I hope that the new Hiver soursebook has the capital of the Hivers detailed.

Fine (although I\'m not a weapons man myself).
I\'m more interested in naval warship standards.

>   That\'s enough for a start.  Any suggestions?

Any other books?  Well, lbefore I begin, I\'m going to try and keep in 
mind that GDW has a delicate financial situation, and cannot afford to 
produce "Dream books" like the MT "Referee\'s Companion", or even my 
"Atlas of the Imperium", (updated).   Book\'s produced has to sell.

Well, I\'d think that my "four capital supplement" would sell as a 
standalone, but my uniforms are better handled either as an addition to a 
military-angle Traveller book [maybe "The Traveller Military Sourcebook", 
including a lot of meaty stuff on the Regency military and (more) 
interesting equipment from the Wilds, the Black Sphere, and the Hivers.]  
or as articles of Challange.

The Alien Modules need to continue.

Outside of this, I really need nothing more from the Post-collapse New 
Era.  Strictly speaking, I need nothing but FF&S expansions (I don\'t use 
the New Era), but I am curious to see how high-tech societies operate in 
the Offical Universe.

Please.  In the pre-Collapse TML (back whem Mr. Perkins was in charge), 
there were MegTraveller designs for floating, guided pizza boxed and 
starships which run on coal.

Of course, if FF&S II has genetic engineering, you may get your wish...

If this is really canon (and the Megatraveller Journals have never been 
considered otherwise), then the Zho\'s are going to be Very Busy by the 
time of the New Era... I\'m now wondering why they still exist.

Depending on the damage the Sparklers cause, they may be in a worse 
position than the Imperium is!

  Don\'t you worry!
  In "Path of Tears", the Coalition has plans to incoroporate all of 
Diaspora Sector by 1205!!!
  They are rushing because they are in "a race against time" before 
reuniting charted space becomes impossible, due to xenophobia and 
alternate, unnice pocket empires arise.

Maybe.  I _think_ that the Convenant of Suffern is to take the place of 
"Stout Ally" of the RC.  They\'ll need all the allies they can get, if 
they start bumping into the Black Sphere -- or Regency Fleets.

The main barrer between the Convenant of Suffern and the RC is the 
Promise main (which runs between them), currently dominated by jump-capable 
Vampires all drifting towards the Black Sphere for reasons unknown.

If you want to establish the RE in your own campagin, go right ahead!! (as 
if you needed my permission)

The RE seems a lot like what I\'m expecting in the Hinterwolds (If you 
look at your TNE New Era Map of Charted space, you\'ll find a fair number 
of pocket empires in that area.  And they\'re even closer to the Hivers 
than the RC.

Primordials, and thus the inability of the Zhodani to deal at all 
with the Domain. However, as early as 1120 Norris was conducting 
negotiations with the Zhodani, rumours were rife that the Zhodani 
were to allow the Domain to annex Distict 268 (sounds pretty much 
like expansion to me). In an interview with Norris, late in 1120,
we learn of his vision of the future and a day when both the Vargr
and the Aslan are part of a new Imperium (for want of a better word). 
Clearly Norris has plans even then for future, when asked about his 
demise, he pointed out that the Domain was run by a beurocracy, which 
will continue to run long after he has gone, he also points out that 
his true-daughter Silandrian will be his Heir (this boy has big

the size and the economic base is too great for that, to suggest that 
The Domain would collapse with the removal of Imperial markets is 
rather like suggesting civilisation would collapse if the USA sank 
into the sea overnight, I think The Domain is independant enough to 
survive. Finally there is still the Foreven Sector, largely ignored 
by both the Imperium and The Consulate, to date, however this is the 
new markets that Domain will concentrate on (Imperial Lines 1, GDW).
The point is The Domain WILL expand, but rather by deplomacy (and a 
subtle show of strength), rather than by force, and probably in 
conjunction with Aslan and Vargr elements.

How about an adaption of the MTJ#4\'s Zhodani\'s "Baddies for the Core" into
TNE.

Norris closes boarders, informs everyone else ...

DoD and Aslan fleets meet Virus crossing the J5 root.

Say 5 years later ? the Zhodani core fleet returns, with information about
the sparkers, who follow them back and appear in Zhodani space. The Zhodani
emidiatly lanch a massive strike against the Sparkers, with the concequence
that all the command and control staff of the Zhodani fleet are killed. They
die from Psionic collective mind. WIth 90% of all the Zhodani fleets dead,
the Zhodani, call on all nieghbours to help stop this comman enemy.

DoD, Vargr, and Aslan, combine with elements of the Zhodani fleet, and stop
the Sparkers. A band of adventures (non-psionic) board a Sparkers ship, and
communicate with the Primordials, after which hostilities stop.

With 90% of the Zhodani fleet destroyed, and all psionics of the systems
visited by the Primordials dead, Zhodani space sprinks from 7 to 3 sectors,
as the quariteen boarders can\'t be patrolled. The three sectors left start to
rebuild, while protecting there borders with the remaining fleets. Nobals
without psionic ability start to apear in Zhodani space.

The worlds left behind perish to the Virus, and in a few years, psionic
strains appear on the Zhodani boarders.

The Primordials bod about chartered space for a bit, destroying the odd
vampire fleet olong the way, untill they find the black currtain, where they
are repelled. Having suffered heavy losses they go searching for something
more interesting else where in the Galaxy.

Grandfather pops up to find the Zhodani crushed, and the Primordials bodded
off again (with no records of there course), and gose looking for them.

What do people think ?

I\'m rather fuzzy on the recent (i.e. New Era) history of things, so I\'ll
just shut up and stop quoting bits and pieces of history. :)

One thing that was brought up that I\'m not sure about is the comment about
the Regency\'s strength in comparison to its neighbors (I forget who it was).
Yes, the Regency still has its local fleets, but I don\'t think that they\'re
in a position to exercise gunboat diplomacy.  Although, as Bob Brown pointed
out, a properly placed frontier cruiser could work wonders in a diplomatic
negotiation.

Incidentally, in my defense :), I was merely pointing out another explanation
as to why the Zho\'s were leaving the Domain alone.  As I said, the Sparklers
never really sat well with me.

As far as the independence of the Domain\'s economy, I must agree that it\'s
not in any danger of imminent collapse.  Yes, things may have been hard
when the Vilani megacorps pulled out, but nature has a way of filling in
vacuums (besides, didn\'t the Vilani sell of their assets?  Someone must
have bought them...).  Also, the Domain has been semi-independent for a
while, anyway.  Even when the Corridor was open, it\'s a long way around the
Great Rift.  Anyway, this is all IMHO.

Hoo boy. I had missed that one. Now, it seems to me that
a marriage between Ms Norris and Master Strephon would be
the political opportunity of the century that couldn\'t be
missed. Is the Strephon clone the official Heir? The Norris
clone is, isn\'t she?

It seems obvious these two\'s fate is written in the Stars.

 For months I\'ve listened to TMLers and ex-TMLers (and XTMLers) bitch

been scrambled so badly as to make the 5th Frontier War as nothing, too
many primal secrets of the Traveller Universe would have stood revealed,
and the complaining here on the TML would likely still be going at
pre-XTML levels. The alternate timelines would be as numerous as they are
now, if not more so. I speak, of course, of what DGP had planned:

 The Sparklers (or "Baddies from the Core") were what DGP _would_ have
done to the game had GDW not awakened from their long T2k period and
taken control of Traveller again.  Frankly, my reaction to the Sparklers
was as bad as many TMLers reactions to Virus. Yech. Similar to the
Virus reaction of many others, my objections weren\'t to the whole idea
so much as to the details. By comparison Virus is a marvel of organized
plot design, IMHO, and is much more useful to stories (campaigns, that is)
placed afterwards.

 Don\'t get me wrong, DGP did some marvelous things for Traveller, but
the Sparklers would not have been one of them. As it sits now there
are no Baddies from the Core, the tales of the 8th Zhodani Core
Expedition remain to be told, and the real reason Grandfather made the
Zhodani Map Artifact remains unrevealed. Finally, the Marches remain
largely isolated from and unconcerned by the events in the rest of the
Imperium.
 Just the way I like it, Thank You.

   I second the motion.  I think that it should also include a discussion of
things like the Ancient#s pocket universes, parallel universes (and
machines that allow access to them), and time travel (and machines that
allow it)--it would be interesting to run a few H.G. Wells ``Time Machine``
type adventures.

  Absolutely.  But not only Imperial uniform designs, but Solomani, Vargr,
Aslan, Sword World, Zhodani, etc. as well.

   <snip>

   The Sparkler storyline has been classified by GDW as a ``variant``
which means that it didn`t happen.  This is not to say there couldn`t have
been some kind of revolt within the Consulate, or that the Zhodani really
did encounter the Sparklers but didn`t shoot it out with them (the Zhodani
probably would have re-deployed their fleet to meet the potential threat
just in case), just that some other explanation for all the naval starship
traffic must be found.

   My thinking in this case is that it is a heck of a lot easier to fabricate
something if you have a copy of whatever it is you want to duplicate
sitting in front of you.  It leads you down paths you otherwise would not
of thought of, and keeps you from turning down a blind alley.  As a
librarian (my day job), I can tell you from experience that being able
to adapt a previous search strategy to a bit of research gives you a
considerable time savings over having to come up with a search
strategy from scratch.

Me neither.  Luckily, as far as I can tell, it was just a non-canon story
idea of DGP\'s that was thrown into the back of MTJ #4 as an indication of
something they were thinking about.  Personally, I\'m hoping that the odd
stuff going on to galactic coreward from _Survival Margin_ and the weird
Zhodani movements at Esalin indicate that GDW is going to take the threads
that the DGP folks left lying around to start setting this up and are going
to do something more clever and interesting with this one.

Aslan and Vargr both got written up for MT - I\'d prefer to see supplements
on aliens that\'ve only been covered in CT first, (K\'Kree, Droyne, Zhodani,
etc).

I think that one\'s on *everyone\'s* list. I\'m still waiting for the neural

On a silimar subject, I read somewhere that the US wanted to put
self-destruct code in the s/w of hi-tech military vehicles sold to foreign
countries, just in case the vehicles in question got captured or the
country in question turned out to be not as friendly as first thought. For
some reason, the customers weren\'t too happy about the idea...

I don\'t think the Primordials can be stopped by anything short of 
Grandfather. From my understanding of _Survival Margin_, the Black 
Curtain is the area where no sophont has ever entered and returned. I 
assume that the Vampires have set up strong defenses in the area of the 
Black Curtain, but nothing with a high enough tech level to repel the 
Primordials.

I like the idea of the Primordials kicking Zhodani butt, 
and having the Zhodani beg the Domain to help in defeating them. 
Grandfather gets word of this and secretly joins an expedition of PC\'s to 
the Primordial Fleet. Grandfather (being Grandfather) doesn\'t want to 
wipe out the Primordials, he just wants them to leave his arm of the 
galaxy ("There ain\'t \'nough room in the Orion Arm fer the both of us, 
pardner!"). After getting nowhere with the Primordial Fleet 
diplomatically, he transports himself and the PC party to the Primordial
homeworld, and convinces the Primordial Head Poobah to get his troops out 
of Dodge City. After much negotiation, the PC\'s find out that the 
Primordials are merely combing the Milky Way for the recipe for the 
perfect egg salad sandwich, which in fact was manipulated out of 
existence by the Hivers. Luckily, the Darrians have a secret copy of 
the recipe, kept in the same vault as the instructions for the Star 
Trigger. Grandfather quickly retreives the recipe from the Darrians, 
and presents it to the Primordials in a grand ceremony. The Primoridals, 
with recipe in hand finally get to complete their greatest experiment: 
they travel to Kirur and ask to have lunch with the Steppelord of the 
2000 Worlds. While the Steppelord isn\'t looking, they switch his lentil 
sandwich with the egg salad.  He didn\'t notice the differnce...

BTW, When I started this rant, I had no intention of being this silly. 
The first paragraph and the first couple sentences in the second are 
serious. I don\'t know what happened. I think I\'ve been infected with the 
SI strain of Virus (Silly version). I better stop writing: I feel a 
need to explain my Assassination of Strephon theory.

He\'s not dead. He\'s on the one of the southern continents of Terra with 
Jim Morrison and Elvis playing Doom over a Virus-free network.

Fellow Traveller Players:

	I would dearly appreciate it if, when I write to the list, there be 
at least some acknowledgement of the posting.  I don\'t mean to seem pushy, 
however It seems to me as if you are ignoring anything I can add to the 
list out of hand.  I would appreciate it if you could at the least scrible 
a little something to show that what I had to say got a least a glancing at. 
 I however understand, if you ignored it because it was part of a topic 
that had become stale, and boring, Like the argument over VIRUS, Thanks for 
letting me get that all off my chest, I just don\'t like it when I\'m ignored.  

Stay Frosty,

O.K., O.K., give GDW credit where credit is due: they _DIDN\'T_ ram 
Sparklers down our throat\'s, and the Imperium still has a sporting chance 
to be rebuilt.

been so few messages.  Over here, I haven\'t recieved any Xboat messages in

Welcome to the Club of the Attention-Deprived!

Speaking as a mediocre TML Personality (not as legendary as Cynthia or 
Wildstar, but more well-known than the average silent TML\'er), it seems 
that *you* want to start fresh and interesting new discussions, banter 
with the OldTimers, have your wrath feared across _both_ List\'s, and 
generally be Big Man on Campus.

O.K., so what does it take?  Well, perferably you should have been here 
at least a year before the List crashed back in about last September.  
The Collapse is the great divide between 

The OldTimers (ie. people who apparently have been playing the game 
  since Reagan\'s first term), who usually only post rarely (and who are 
  missed:  Glenn noted a while ago that the List suffer\'s for their absence)

and...

The YoungBloods (ie. people who have been posting to the List only since 
  after the Collapse),who are simply not as steeped in Traveller lore as 
  the OldTimers (Though some of us are pretty good in the sciences, and I 
  do what I can with politic\'s, personalities, adventures, and worlds)  

Now, the best way to be taken seriously in (X)TML is NOT to repost good 
articles, but instead to write up new ones.  Bring up new issues, or at 
least old issues in a new light.  Spend some time writing up adventures: 
refine the adventure, and post it: it doesn\'t have to be huge, just as long 
as it\'s good.  Design new worlds and societies, for the Classic, 
Rebellion, or (perferably) the New Era period.  Spend some time 
understanding where Traveller came from, and try to get as much of it\'s 
great history in your head as your wallet and clock will allow.

When you comment on a line of discussion, try to avoid "me-tooism".  
Strive to understand what\'s going on, and the core of the controversy.  
Then see if there\'s something everyone is missing, and point it out.  A 
very good example occured on XTML, where there was a raging fistfight 
over whether the Third Imperium is a Solomani/Vilani split or 99% 
Villani.  Before someone pointed out that the Solomani can (and did) use 
clones to beef up the population, the OldTimers were happly smashing each 
other\'s brains out over the mathamatically possible rate of population 
growth. ("Would the 200-year lifespan Vilani reproduce as quickly as the 
Solomani?" sticks in my head even today!)  

Note the two-sided sword that earns respect and get\'s one heard on 
(X)TML -- A: A good grasp of what is actually _possible_ (remember, a lot 
          of folk here have their B.S., Master\'s, and PhD\'s: they expect 
          consistency and logic in their game)  One of the major problems 
          of Virus is it\'s apparent lack of connection with reality, and 
          seemingly "deus ex machina" nature, a problem that - to GDW\'s 
          credit - has been partly dealt with.  We await "Vampire Ship\'s" 
          for the definitive explaination of what Virus is, and how it isn\'t 
          the same thing as pure magic.

           B: A good grasp of Traveller Lore.  The Shot that Ended the 
          Bloodbath used a quote from "Solomani and Aslan" to clinch his 
          argument.  To get the Good Stuff, you need to contact 
          Rodge@cyberspace.com (Rodge Sanger): he has nearly everything 
          for sale (Sorry: NOT the glorious "Vilani & Vargr" aka Cogs & 
          Dogs, or "Aslan & Solomani" aka Rats & Cats).  

It\'s possible to be heard strictly using A or B, but using both is best.

And what if you aren\'t a science major, and you don\'t have a personal 
library of Traveller Material (including the Kr\'ee supplement, the book 
that seperates The Boys From The Men)? 

Well, then, first of all you should focus your studies on the New Era: 
the Era is so young that anyone here can become a master of it, if they 
buy everything from GDW regarding it, subscribe to Sword of the Knight\'s 
"The Traveller Chronicle",_and_ "Challange".  You should also start 
boning up on science and good science fiction works, so you can fence 
with the best.  Also, you should obtain some of the MegaTraveller 
background material (I recommed either "The Rebellion" or 
"Imperial Encyclopedia": you may consider getting the MegaTraveller game.
All of which GDW still has back issues of.), if you want to get more 
background info of the war that led to the Collapse. (say, your 
adventurers are set in Antares Sector, and you need to know why Archduke 
Brzk decided to seccede from the Imperium and create the Antares League).

Finally, what if you are slightly short of financial resources?  Then, 
first, you need to stick with the New Era.  Then, you _need_ to have
   A: The Basic RuleBook
   B: Fire, Fusion & Steel
   C: The World\'s Builder\'s Guide
   D: Vampire Ship\'s (whenever it comes out)
   E: Fire, Fusion & Steel II (again, whenever it comes out) 
This will total to about $120, U.S.
 
With this, you can produce your own universe.  A good grasp of this 
material will aquaint you with the basic _technical_ issues of Traveller. 
(and technical issues is a major subject on (X)TML.)

But what if you are more interested in the softer issues, like politics and 
societies?  Then you want
   A: The Basic RuleBook
   B: Path of Tears
   C: The Alien Sourcebooks (Hiver + whatever has been recently released)
   D: The Regency Sourcebook (what *I\'m* waiting for)

And if you want to concentrate on military issues?
   A: The Basic Rulebook
   B: Striker II (Land combat)
   C: Fire, Fusion & Steel (to make all those gorgeous grav tanks)
   D: Smash & Grab
   E: Brilliant Lancers (starship combat boardgame)
   F: Battle Riders (as above, but for fleet combat)

and it would be good if you can get "Trillion Credit Squadron" and "High 
Guard", both from classic traveller.  Great stuff for Subsector-wide to 
Sector-size wargaming and Fleet Actions.

Yes, but Virus still stinks.  SOme hate it for technical reasons.  I hate 
it because it makes the Traveller universe much less complex and a lot 
more duller (and low-tech, too!).  Also, It just isn\'t as grand as 
the pre-Rebellion Imperium.

And you stay cool, too, Mr. Long.

I hope that I\'ve been of some help.

Call me the voice of dissent. As a non-mathematician, FFS is as
incomprehensible to me as the Virus seems to so many out here. I envy
people - honestly - who can pick it up and produce a starship in a day or
two. I\'m still working on conversions from MT days. There must be more than
a handful of us out here who would put FF&S II at the END of their wish
list.

It strikes me more small, stand-alone folio adventures, a bit more detailed
than those in Challenge, akin to the classic Traveller Adventure line, or
even Arrival Vengeance, would help pull in a few souls who may be daunted
by the tomelike FF&S - not that I don\'t for a minute doubt its
wonderfulness. As soon as I understand it all (say, sometime before the
rise of the Fourth Imperium), I\'ll likely be calling for FF&S as loud as
anyone.

>Welcome to the Club of the Attention-Deprived!

Well personally, this is not the way I invisoned interacting with other 
players, this list sure could learn a few things from the Shadowrun List, 
after all were all in this for fun :)

>Speaking as a mediocre TML Personality (not as legendary as Cynthia or 
Wildstar, but more well-known than the average silent TML\'er), it seems 
that *you* want to start fresh and interesting new discussions, banter 
with the OldTimers, have your wrath feared across _both_ List\'s, and 
generally be Big Man on Campus.

Not quite what I want is to simply have those people who seem to think they 
can crawl inside of the heads of all players realize, that they are not the 
end-all and be all of TRAVELLER.  ;)

  since Reagan\'s first term), who usually only post rarely (and who are 
  missed:  Glenn noted a while ago that the List suffer\'s for their absence)

The YoungBloods (ie. people who have been posting to the List only since 
  after the Collapse),who are simply not as steeped in Traveller lore as 
  the OldTimers (Though some of us are pretty good in the sciences, and I

Don\'t be so quick to assume, only those of you who were here befor the 
crash are the only ones who have been playing traveller forever.  I for one 
have played every form of traveller that has come through the space lanes.  
Now if you want the high granduer of first edition traveller, then play it,
  I however like the changes to the rules, I feel that the action has 
gotten quite a bit smoother, and I can create a very good flowing story 
line.  Just because you don\'t like the present ERA of traveller dosen\'t 
mean that you couldn\'t use the new rules but remain faithfull to the 
history of the earlier editions.  i also happen to enjoy the Idea of post 
collapse Star exploration, and I LOVE the RCES (Star Vickings)The idea 
allows me to create a great team enviroment for my players to interact 
under.

> Spend some time understanding where Traveller came from, and try to get as

As mentioned Above, I already Know traveller\'s history, I have Read just 
about all of the info that has been, Including the very Rare FASA materials
.I especially loved the Idea of the COACC.

not hope to know what will deffinately be in the future.  Also perhaps a 
point that you are all missing is simply this "Get A Life" :>  It\'s only a 
game, you play it to escape from reality, not to emerse yourselves in the 
"Absolute" reality of science.  When we get off on one of these It has to

I work for the Army, but I have talked to some Navy men.  Historically =
(WW1 and WW2), navy battles can take HOURS, with hundreds of misses for =
every hit.  This was true until the dawn of guided missles and fighter =
bombers.  In fact, the WW2 vessles had two full crews because battles =
took so long you needed to give the guys time to sleep and eat durring =
the battle.  One of the problem with sci-fi is they still try to show =
fighters and ships simular to WW2 navy, with lumbering ships missing =
often and fast fighters skimming through for close torpedo runs.  A =
better anology might be having fighters trated like PT boats:  fast, but =
under the same limitations as the ships they are fighting.
After WW1, the Battle Cruiser was designed. It was a lightly armored =
cruiser that would be harder to hit due to it\'s speed.  It was discovered =
very quickly in ww2 that even if one in 200 shots hit is as opposed to 1 =
in 100 shots, without the armor this fewer hits did far more damage and =
was therefor a bad trade.
Anyway, 5 second turns would be silly if you are using WW2 as your =
example of ship combat, but might work for modern one-shot-one-kill =
missle warfare.

Ouch!
First, if the Black Curtain CAN repell a multi-billion ton fleet of TL33+ =
ships, i\'m going to be really scared when IT starts to expand..
Second, what little we know of the Pr1mordial, the Ancients may actually =
be of higher tech.  Try to explain to a cave man the difference between a =
TRS 80 and a MAC 8100.  
Chances are the Black Curtain is the Vampire Kingdom, since Lucan had so =
many ships until the end and all these other enemy vessles or doomslayer =
virus ships heading his way, where else would you have a vampire =
Imperium.  Unless Lucan\'s superweapon program jumped a few tech levels, =
these will still be TL 12 to 15 ships in varying states of disrepair.
Lastly, I dought highly the only super races in the Milky Way (Ancients =
and Primordials) came from the our little corner of the galaxy....
Something from the Gama quadrant anyone?
Again, how would the Imperials know if another empire was located on the =
other side of the Zhodani?  Do you think many Kkree know about the Aslan? =
 Do the Zhodani know much about the Hiver?  And the Imperium is an open =
border for trade compared to the Zhodani border....

I have confirmed that the info is correct though some army sources. Whew!
thats alot of stuff. Clearly local sources of fuel would be important. If 
you
have fusion power divide the fuel supplies by 20.  If you have a large
percentage of laser weapons you could also lower your ammo supplies.
Local ammo sources would be great but what is the local tech level?
You can see that attacking a planet with a hostile enviroment and no
local allies would be a logistic nightmare.

Hm, nope. TML and XBOAT arrive the their usual psudeo-clockwork fashion,

Yes! Me too! Well, no, actually, but I sympathize that sometimes it does
seem that some threads just terminate on one\'s own articles, when you 
were actually looking for some feedback. And I think you rate above
"mediocre mailing list personality" Alvin - maybe "acknowledged gadfly".

Uh, is K\'kree that rare? I bought mine mere months ago. Though I am curious 
why it says "Aliens Module 1" on the back and "Alien Module 2" on the
front...
What is the rarest Traveller book I wonder? Roger Sanger says he\'s still
looking for a copy of Signal GK (I think), doesn\'t he have, well, everything?

As for building up a Traveller library, if you don\'t have a CT library now,
don\'t start. MT can still be had, with a little luck (I got a nearly
complete set of books locally for $40! Some people would rather be rid of
it. Wierd). I\'d say, if you\'re just starting, stick to TNE. Although
it lacks the CT ambiance of bazillions of tiny 30 page black books.

And for actual new thoughts...

I was looking through 101 Vehicles the other day and it mentions one
recon drone which has no pilot, but is instead controlled by a robot
brain. In the preface of the book they make a brief statement about
equating MT computer CPs with robot intelligence points. The ratio they
give is 250 CP (I think) == 1 point of intelligence, giving TL 17 (?)
computers (Model 11) an INT of 4. They described this by saying that
above TL 15 synaptic processors become so reliable that they can be used
in starship computers, which require a lot more reliability than experimental
robot brains. Anyways, by this logic, most starship computers have the 
same capacity for intelligence as a worm or bug - little, if not none.

So, my question is, how can the Virus come along and make your pokey
Model 2/bis into a super-duper highly intelligent Virus computer??
This seems akin to a disease that make earthworms into rocket scientists.
I this Traveller or Star Trek?

The impression I got from TNE is that Avery (originally seen in the
ARRIVAL VENGEANCE folio) is adopted by Seldrian Aledon, Norris\'s
female clone.  Since Seldrian was in her mid-twenties and unmarried
(as far as I know) in 1126, Avery is likely her first child and heir.
This could set him up to inherit the duchy of Regina, archduchy of
Deneb, and/or Norris\'s job as First Regent, probably after Seldrian 
has a chance to run things.  Of course, if either Seldrian or Norris
end up having any natural children, they could end up getting some
of the subsidiary titles.  (I like the idea of a direct descendant
of Norris keeping the duchy of Regina, but the archduchy is probably
tied to the Regent\'s job.)  In 1200, a very old Seldrian, Avery, or
Avery\'s kid is probably running the Regency government.

One hot theory that\'s been bandied about is that Avery is actually a
clone of Strephon\'s.  The timing is fairly good, since whoever Avery
is, he was born in 1118.  Strephon needed a heir, he definitely wasn\'t
about to remarry, and the idea of letting one of his clones "become
real" might have appealed to his whimsical side.

"Armageddon 2419", the original "Buck Rogers" novel, was
published a wee bit earlier than the 1950s -- it came out shortly
after WWI, in the 20s.  As for scoffing at "ray guns", they were
scoffing at the Martian Heat Ray in H.G.Well\'s "War of the Worlds"
back in the 1890\'s....

Try the book "The New Dinosaurs", by Dougal Dixon.  Good artwork, and as the
animals are based on familiar Terran niches you can get the stats from T2k
(or guestimate easily).  See my earlier tirade on experts and believability
to get my opinion on most published Traveller animals (low).  Now if a
biologist was to write up an expansion to the animal rules...

Converting Terry\'s Wet Navy rules to TNE is relatively simple; I did a Q&D
last week.  I\'ve asked him to do an official rewrite but had no response -
but I think this is his busy season.  Did you know that he had a naval
architect for the Royal Navy proof his Challenge article?  Now there\'s a
writer who takes his job seriously!

I disagree here.  TNE has too many rules to bother with this.  I\'ve run a few
Space: 1889 games using Dream Park rules.  Email me privately if you\'d like
the scenarios.

Possibly, but you seem to have ignored what I was trying to point out, which
is that an expert will find problems in the rules no matter what they are. 
Take it from me; I reffed a group of scientists and engineers including:
electrical, mechanical, and industrial engineers, a physicist, biologist,
epidemiologist, businessman, and a computer scientist.  I regularly got taken
to task because the expert, realising that the situation I presented could
not be natural (was technically impossible, etc), decide that This Was A Clue
and promptly began to investigate.

Some examples include:

- ecosystems, biomass, bioenergy and nutrient flows
- thermodynamics (waste heat, especially)
- orbital eccentricity and orbital placement
- all the economics rules
- pre-Virus computer systems and expert systems
- manufacturing and repair rules
- disease, public health, quarantine regulations

The compromise we arrived at was that the expert would point out \'the clue\'
to me, and I would tell them whether their character noticed anything unusual
(it was a clue) or not (the rules were inaccurate).  We ended up with a
distinct "game reality" where many \'natural laws\' didn\'t apply, mainly
because we didn\'t want to redesign the entire published universe, all
published equipment, etc.  Most of these comments got channelled back to GDW;
some were incorporated in TNE, but more were left out because of playability.

I apply two acid tests when evaluating an \'incorrect\' rule or plot device:

1) Is it simpler/faster/easier than a more accurate version?
2) Is it plausible to a scientifically literate person who is not an expert
in that field?

If the answer is yes to both, then I will usually not bother to correct it,
even if I know it\'s wrong.

(As a paranthetical aside, friends of mine in the armed forces don\'t like
Clancy\'s books because he "places too much faith on technology working
correctly".  Having served in combat, they feel that Clancy _is_ \'rubbing a
magic lamp\'.)

Finally, note that Virus is rare.  (Although I\'ll admit it has been very
prominent in Challenge and S&G.)  Your players could plausibly adventure for
years without encountering it, so leaving it out of your campaign should be
easy.  Assume that high-tech synaptic computers break down quickly (so few
relic computers function and none can be trusted without thorough testing)
and you can get much the same effect - probably close enough to use most of
GDW\'s material.  Anything else, ignore.  (Hey, that\'s what I do with the
combat-type stuff anyway.)

   You also forgot...

   People who have played Traveller since Carter or Reagan was
in office and now find themselves stepping out on to the
information superhighway for the first time. It would appear
there are a number of them. Believe it or not, not every
Traveller player on the surface of Terra has an Internet
account.

   You also forgot...

   People who played Traveller back during the Carter and Reagan
Eras, who picked up MegaTraveller, didn`t like it and stopped
playing...and those who`s lives got too damn busy to mess with
RPGs during the late 80s early 90s, but now have the free time 
to play and picked up TNE.

   I got as far as Geometry in High School (a sophomore, or 
second year class) and that was it. I majored in History at the
local state university and generally avoided math courses
(with the exception of a couple of statistics courses) ever
since. I have no problem with the formulas in FF&S, nor should
anyone who has taken (and passed) a high school math course.

   In your defense....

   No one can pick up FF&S and design their first starship
in a day or two. The problem is that there are so many options.
Start off with a basic design philosophy, evolved from playing
a game or two of Brillant Lances and/or looking over the 
designs featured in the back of the TNE book. Once you have
a good idea of what it is that you like in a ship (butt-kicking
sensors, lasers over missiles, maximum possible armor, at least
60 G-turns of fuel), then start to put one together. If you
can#t put everything you want into the design, adjust your
design philosophy (``I`d like to carry 60 G-turns of fuel, but
I just don`t have the volume...humm...what if I made it 50?).
Show your design to others (I`ll look at anything....once :) )
who have a working knowledge of the rules, a little constructive
criticism can go a long way (and there`s nothing worse than
working in a design vacuum). Since you`ve apparently done some
designing before, this might seem like old hat, but I hope I`ve
been it least a little helpful.

   That`s DGP, Bob.  Marc Miller was never associated with
Digest Group Publications. His name was used in the credits
(after all, he did write the *original* game), but that was
just a formality.

   Once again, a formality. The creative vision of most of
what went on with MegaTraveller was the result of the work of
the people at DGP (which, by the way, has long since went belly
up). So far as I know (and once again Loren can correct me if
I#m wrong), things produced for GDW by DGP are official--things
produced and published by DGP prior to the publication of `Hard 
Times` (when Dave Nilsen takes creative control) are also
official. Items produced and published by DGP after that time
(1991) are not.

   They didn`t rip up the Zhodani because according to canon,
that did *not* happen. If you want to run a variant where the
Primordials trash the Consulate, that`s your business.

   Not exactly. At TL 15, regular computers can emulate AI
so well, only a computer expert can tell the difference.
The problem is that they are still to a degree deterministic.
For those of you who watch Star Trek Voyager, think of the
emergency medical doctor. He is a hologram (God how that
phrase gets miss used!) that has been programmed with the
accumlated medical knowledge of dozens of doctors, has access
to an extensive library of medical information, and even
appears to have a personality. Someone walking into the room
would have no reason to believe that he was anything other
than a walking, talking human being, and a skilled physician
to boot. But he is not artifically intelligent (at least not
yet). In the Traveller universe, there are robots and
computers that have the capabilities (and perhaps the
irritable personality) of the EM Doc. It is just the matter
of a tech level before they could cross the line into true 
sentience.

   The only truly limiting factor on Virus is space. If there
is enough disk (or whatever they use at higher tech levels)
space, the Virus expands itself to its full potential. If
not, it partially or even completely `zips` or condenses
itself. When completely zipped, it is called an `egg`.
This is the form it commonly takes when it infects a hand
computer or similar device (I postulated in `Playland` an
adventure that was recently published in Challenge, that
a Virus egg could be stored on an electronic device
equipped with a transmitter which would be implanted in
some hapless human who would act as a courier--this has some
rather chilling implications). In something like a 2bis,
you#d probably end up with a only partially expanded Virus.
A Forrest Gump strain if you will (``life is like a box of
chocolates...you never know which one you#re going to kill
first``). This would make it easy to contain and destroy, and
this is why so many smaller spacecraft survived the Collapse 
(aside from lower maintenance).

>Is this Traveller or Star Trek?

   If only GDW had one-tenth of the money Paramount had made
off of Trek, we would be discussing the finer points of the
latest Traveller animated series, and the implications of
GDW`s offer to purchase TSR at twice its market value.

Sir, I haven\'t got a degree either, know precious little real science, 
and have only a scattering of traveller products (of any era). (just a 
college CS guy.)

Moreover, I only got too read the pre-crash TML only about a week before 
it crashed, and posted exactly one message to it.

I\'m sorry you interpreted my post that way: it wasn\'t meant to be a put down.

Correct.  I mixed up being a "newbie" on TML with being a "newbie" with 
Traveller.  My apologies.

Which lead\'s back to the origional question: why don\'t you get any 
replies to your posts?  If you obtain an answer, notify us.

Just to let everyone know GDW\'s offical point of view about the Virus:

"Frequency:  Finally, and most importantly, avoid filling your campaign 
 with Virus.  The effects of Virus are omnipresent, but the actual reality 
 of Virus should be rare... "
			
"...if the characters encounter Virus every time they turn around, they 
 will either routinely defeat it or they will die a lot...it will have 
 very little perceived danger value...became an annoying nuisance..."

"..there are limits to your creative energies, no matter how imaginative 
 you are.  Each active Virus should not only be dangerous, it should be 
 unique and fascinating.  So keep them rare to enable you to lavish the 
 time and attention on them, that they deserve, as well as keeping your 
 players guessing."

	Path of Tears, _Virus_, p. 143.

So even GDW tells us to remember what the Virus has done, but it\'s almost 
gone now.  It\'s time to rebuild... it\'s time to go back to the stars...
To help out those who suffered more then others... to fix what was wrong..

..To give us all another chance...

That\'s why I like Traveller: The New Era.

Okay. Let\'s summarize: Biologists hate Traveller\'s biology rules;
Astronomers gripe that Traveller\'s maps are two-dimensional and therefor
have little or no known relevance to true astrography; Physicists can\'t
stand Traveller\'s FTL theories - they\'re impossible at best; And computer
scientists rip Traveller\'s computer rules - including and often in
particular Virus.

Geeez. You\'d think Traveller was a *game* or something... :-)

FFFFFFUUUUUUUUSSSSSSSHHHHHHHHH!!! (Sound of Halon FIRE Suppression unit)

Whoa! a Flame war has been averted.  I was frustrated by what I have seen 
as a lack of cooperation, and pushiness on the list.  I just get frustrated 
when all the Phd\'s of today think they can predict with 100% accuracy what 
will be in the future.  This is why most SCI-FI shows are very vague about 
how there systems work.  Can you tell me exactly how the ODN conduits from 
star trek work?? No and that\'s because the exact technology is not on a 
blue print, otherwise we\'d be able to manufacture the items postulated. ;)

When I get involved in a list like this, I see it as a chance to exchange 
Ideas about the possibilty of the technology, not the exact ways it works.  
I am not building these things, as long as I can give a creditable 
description of something, then that is all I need.  What I need to see from 
the list is more postulating of where the RCES is going, What the ASLAN\'s 
are up to, etctera, etcetera, etcetera. :)

Now that I have A different view point of you letter to me, I can 
Justifiably say "I\'m Sorry to have Jumped on your case."  However I still 
think that I have made some valid points during our very-short heated 
exchange. 


Now on to some new Business.  What do you all have to say to this??  Lets 
assume that for a moment, there is a spatial rift, how would this affect 
jump travel??  Would the rift merely force you out of jump, or would it 
cause a severe Mis-Jump.  Perhaps sending you half-way across known space.  
(now that i\'ve written that I\'ve noticed how much it sounds like ST.Voyager.)

	Here\'s another thought, what would a society be like, if they were 
considering the abolishment of the Anti-Psionic laws.  What would the 
people talk about in there discussions, and how would the underground 
Psionic institutes react to this news.  Would it have taken a civil 
disobedience tactic, sort of like the lunch counter sit-ins to bring these 
ideas about, or something else like the good deeds performed by a large 
number of Psionicists in that culture??

Just some new ideas to get the ball rolling in a more productive (IMHO) 
direction :)

  
Stay Frosty,

darned thing can be such a fun thing if it is used properly.  For example:

upon starting a new campaign with new players in RCES lancer roles . . .
I allowed my players in their newly (caugh, choke) refurbished far trader to
encounter a limping nearly destroyed free trader in a decaying orbit.  In
the interest of possibly recovering something useful, they went aboard to
see a bunch of bodies, useless equipment, and a single (virus
infected)police robot.  
        i should note that the player who discovered the robot is the type
who normaly befriends children, little lost dogs, and every other warm and
fuzzy thing that comes along.  when he saw the robot, it was "crying" over
the death of its comrades.  needless to say, they brought it aboard and left
the system.  
        playing an insane, but appearantly friendly police robot was a
unique experience.  having it make the coffee (saying it was in its
programing), and then ask if anybody wanted donuts was a riot.  
        but, it was all a ruse, that made the party let down their guard
long enough for the little bugger to get access to a computer terminal.
        virus is as virus does. . .

the other big mistake that my players did, was to plug every system onboard
into a computer, and plug all of the computers together.  i warned them, but
they don\'t listen to me.
        I can say without a doubt that it was most gratifying to watch my
players run around the ship smashing their own equipment in order to stop
this darned thing.  every time they thought they had finished it off, it
croped up somewhere else.
        needless to say, the darned thing placed eggs everywhere onboard in
everything the computer had access to . . . and i had much in the  way of
plot thickener for many sessions to come.

Now i understand the gripe about the virus not being logical, but even
illogical things can be used for fun. 

its just a thought.

 Sometimes, having the example isn\'t necessary; all you may need is 
 the knowledge that something is possible.  And once you start 
 using a technology in commerce, or demonstrate a weapon, it 
 becomes public knowledge that it\'s possible.  I\'ve seen it

Challenge 76 finally hit the shelves in my part of the UK last Friday
It seemed much delayed, at least three months after 75. A great read,

recipients of this list is, when was it out in your neck of the woods?
Our local roleplaying store, Virgin, doesn\'t even have Aliens of the
Rim on their lists (odd considering the report a few digests ago of
its imminent release), they say that Vampire Fleets is out this 
month. I am getting frustrated! So someone put me out of my misery,
Is it the same over the Atlantic, or does the UK just have [expletive
deleted]..poor roleplaying support. 
Read the Death of Wisdom, a nice read, and welcome as it brings the
reader through parts of the RC, fleshing it out. Ashtabula (?) seemed
to recover Coeur before the rescue missions detailed in PoT, but I\'m
sure it was active in the sector before the rescue missions.
P.s. Anyone got any info on the planet Welch, nr Xezor, for a planet
on the border of the RC, there\'s little info on it in PoT.
Looking forward to my next TNE acquisition, when it reaches these
shores...

   Those show the body sleeves and battle dress used by the RCES.  Various
publications that cover the RCES state that the Body Sleeve is pretty much a
"standard" uniform for RCES in the field.  They come in various colors,
including different camo patterns, but black is what is usally worn.  
   What I think Rob and others were asking for were downport, back in the
RC, duty uniforms.  Given the informal natures of the RCES, it\'s probably a
simple setup.  Trousers and tunic (or jumpsuit, depending on current
fashions).  The RCES insigna somewhere with name tag.  Rank tabs would be
downplayed, if worn at all.  Engineers on the job would be in coveralls, of
course. :-)  insigna wouldn\'t be visable under the grease anyway.

   RC and planetary marines are a different matter.  Rank and Unit insigna
would be present.  Uniforms would be more formal.   Hmmm...I don\'t remember,
do RC Marines wear Body Suits or do they have a simular kind of Combat
Environment Suit?

    'body' => 'Well, I got my copy of H&I, and I thought I\'d say a few words about it.  
I\'m pretty sure most of the folks on this list are going to buy it 
regardless of what I say in my review, but i thought I\'d say a few 
things, if only to see if we can get some discussion going.

First, the big question: is it worth the money?  As much as it pains this 
Traveller fan, the answer is "probably not."  There are a couple of 
reasons for my opinion, and I\'ll discuss the specifics in a minute, but 
the central objection I have has more to do with style than with 
substance.  What I mean by that is the presentation method selected is 
less than useful for gaming purposes, whatever the merits it has as a 
literary device.

(warning: excursion into literary theory follows - search for ***** to skip)

*******************************************************************

For the purposes of my arguement, I divide the presentation of 
roleplaying material into three catagories, associated with three ways of 
dealing with a text:

1) Classic - "There is one text, and the text is true"  
	In this view, the text is the source of truth and admits of only one 
interpretation.  In much the same way that a fundamentalist views the bible 
as the literal truth, the GM and players view the world description as 
literally true.
	This is the style of the earliest roleplaying games, like D&D,
Classic Traveller, etc.  There is one point of view, the game universe is
described from that point of view, and there is no abiguity.  Most
roleplaying games continue to follow this style of presentation.
	What this means for the consumer is that what is described is 
what is really going on.  In GoodOldDee\'nDee, Orcs are evil, they are 
always evil, and you should kill them because they are evil.  In Classic 
Traveller, the Zho are evil plotting mindstealers, they always steal your 
mind, and you should kill them because they are evil.

2) Modern: "There are multiple texts, each with its own truth"
	In this point of view, texts do not have independent truths, but 
only have authors, who infuse their points of view into the texts they 
create.  This attitude has its origins in the study of history in the 
19th century and the development of biblical criticism around the same 
time.  Biblical scholars, for example, began to use textual criticism to 
divide up the bible into parts written by those who knew Jesus, parts 
written later, parts added to support later changes in church teaching, 
and so on.
	Fewer roleplaying games use this technique, but it\'s out there.  
Some of the cyberpunk style games use marginal comments to point out the 
errors in official press accounts or library data, for example.  Done 
well, the technique conveys a sense of how different groups differ from 
one another and why they are at odds.
	In prctice, this can cause a shift in mindset in the course of 
play.  MegaTraveller, as described by DGP, was in a sense the 
transformation of Traveller from a "Classic" to a "Modern" point of 
view.  This is most clearly seen in the two alien modules DGP produced, 
where the racial descriptions are done both from the point of view of the 
race itself, in contrast of the alien modules from Classic Traveller, 
where the description is presented as being "objective."  Here, the Zho 
aren\'t evil, they\'re just misunderstood, because the Imperium made us 
think they were evil, but we can kill them anyway and blame it on the 
programming.

3) Post-Modern: "There are multiple texts, none of which are true"
	Perhaps eventually we\'ll get a better word than post-modern (talk 
about a weird term), but until we do I\'ll use it to signify the current 
literary attempt to reduce literature to an undiferentiated mass, where 
all texts have the same value, which, in short, is nothing.  In 
post-modern thought, there is no "truth," only the interaction of the 
reader and the text, the text acting on the mind of the reader to create 
some state in the readers mind.
	This is the most rare sort of roleplaying product approuch, 
though one could place many White Wolf products (Vampire, Werewolf, 
etc.), where the creation of atmosphere is of central importance - lots 
of illustrations, strange typefaces, etc.  Just compare the graphic style 
of White Wolf products with the typical GURPS sourcebook if you want to 
see what I mean.
	The Hivers and Ithklur sourcebook falls in this third catagory.  
The description of the Hiver is clearly intended to create a sense of 
paranoid confusion within the reader, as it presents multiple points of 
view, all of which are contradictory.  Moreover, in the segment on 
playing and refereeing the Hiver (pages 44 and 45), no attempt is made 
to confirm or deny the rumors presented in the text.  Essentially, the 
authors take the position that the reader should "take the various 
\'facts\' and think about them."  
	This may be fine for a work of fiction, where engaging and
chalenging readers is an appropriate goal, but when I buy a roleplaying
product I like my aliens defined and outlined, thank you very much.  H&I 
is written with a high degree of ambiguity and an intention that the 
reader play a large role in interpretation.  Frankly, I think this lets 
down most gamers, by failing to provide concrete details to plan a 
campaign around.

**************************************************************

Well, enough ranting.  What\'s actually in this thing?  Well, it\'s 92 
pages long, half devoted to Hiver, 40% to Ithklur, and the remaining 10% 
for designers notes, forms and charts, plus yet another advert for 
Vampire Fleets.

The sections on each race include history, current social structure, and 
career generation for Hiver and Ithklur PCs and NPCs.  The Hiver section 
contains no real surprises for those who have read the Classic Traveller 
module on Hiver - some sections seem to be almost verbatim transcriptions 
from the earlier material, though I didn\'t actually try to compare things 
line by line.  Those who have been following the Traveller News Service 
in Challenge will be happy to know that the "Corn Dog" mystery is finally 
solved - they\'re a copy of Terran corn dogs, made from sea slugs (yum!).

The only major new element introduced is the introduction of psionic 
Hivers.  They are rare (one in one million), and their psionic power is 
low grade.  It manifests itself through "Dreams," brought about by the 
cumulative thoughts of those around them.  These dreams have predictive 
power, and can be used as plot devices (imagine that!).  As a side note, 
this explains where that passage that begins "I had a dream.  A dream of 
a wood, old beyond imagining, thick with deep fertility..." and goes on 
to describe the old forest with rotting trees and a big fire and all that 
stuff.  GDW must like this dream - I think this is the third time they\'ve 
published it (Survival Margin, p. 67, and somewhere else).  I had thought 
this was something from one of Professor Ililek Kuligaan\'s books, but it 
turns out to be a dream by one of these psionic Hivers.  Fancy that.

The Ithklur stuff is essentially all original, and very unsatisfying.  
The Ithklur seem like the Three Stooges doing Monty Python routines with 
guns.  Stupid, that\'s what I think.  There are a whole series of jokes 
based on bad Saturday Night Live comedy routines and obscure references 
to American history (yes, Dave, I know what "54-40 or fight!" means, and 
it\'s a stupid joke).  I\'ll say it again - the Ithklur design is Stupid!!!

<no, Mark, go on, tell us what you _really_ think>

Oh, and there is a crabby designers note that says "Wel, we told you 
before that our aliens aren\'t just humans in rubber suits, but heah, we 
were kidding, they really are just humans in rubber suits - fooled you!"  
This from the company that brought us 2300AD, the game with the best damn 
alien aliens ever in a roleplaying game.  Somebody should just slap these 
guys for geting all caught up in post-modern literary theory and angst.  
They\'re probably just made because they didn\'t think up Magic: the 
Gathering of All Disposable Income.

Anyway, that\'s what I think.  I\'d be interested to hear what you guys 
think, once you read your copies of H&I.

Mark Clark


Oh, one last thing - there\'s a reference on page 57 of H&I to a Ithklur 
prisoner who was tortured and then _EATEN_ by K\'Kree.  How did this get 
past the editors?  Or maybe the Ithklur will turn out to be Berliners, in 
the same way as President Kennedy (jelly doughnut, anyone?).

Oh GOOD a flame war averted, thanks guys!

On the VIRUS...
As several people commented and can\'t be said often enough...
IT\'S a GAME!
We are playing in circa 1122 and the Virus is several exciting years
ahead for us, but since Jim and I feel that it is an interesting plot
device ( for all of it\'s weaknessess [ but then it is the 57th cntry. ]
:-) ).

On the Zhodani question...

Well the answer as to why they didn\'t absorb the Domain is political and
echonamic, I\'m sure that there are " right " wingers who want to absorb
the Domain, and some " left " wingers who want to open up all the
borders to the Domain. The large group in the " Middle ", realize that to
attempt to absorb the Domain would not be feasable, Yes; it could be
done, but the former Impearials would fight it to the last Sophant...
and the cost! the casuilty rate, the echonomic devistation that the
Consulate would have to recover from only to conquer a rebelious domain
nearly a third the size of the Consulate itself.
It is not feasable.
Much better to trade and slowly gain the trust and echonomic upper hand.
Besides with the leagalization of Psi, the Domain will finally become
more like the Consolate, which is the perfect government; isn\'t it? :-)

Besides there was a vision of the 8th core expidition, so we MUST take
care of that before we absorb the Domain or anything else. ;-)
( In my version of the history there where some other visions, involving

I have some similier feelings about the " Primordials " that James
Kundert, ( Hi jim ). has but with some modification I could see using
them, or any other Forerunner ( tm, Andre Norton, but I love the term,
so I use it! ), race, some of the characters have run into a remainder
of such a people ( they did not know it and didn\'t guess. care to take a
shot at now jim ? :-) ). I feel that anything that keeps the story
interesting is good.

I do have some ideas for a "Regancy" romance... no that\'s not it :-),
game on the 8th core expidition there are some regancy scouts and some
others from the Domain... could be great fun. ( our group likes cultrual
interactions rather than combat, our present crew includes 6 ELETE
troops - People who fought in a strange space the Brood for 14 yrs...,
and we have had only two ( count \'em 2! ) fire fights ) Oh that\'s right
one pillow fight...
Regancy people aboard a Zhodani ship... could be fun.
How about this...
Recommision the Arrival Vengance for a ( covert ) mission to the old
Imperium... What would the Reces Captain of an Aurora class think if
faced with a ship of that size and tonnage?
How would he react if convinced that it is not the virus but people from
the old "Spinward Marches" come to find out what is here ?
"Questions of a thousand dreams, What you do and what you see"

I\'d better wrap this up.
Oh here is another idea, Watch movies, cartoons ( ANime anyone? ) for
more ideas, I was going so spring one on our crew that I think jim would
have recognized, but I hope with enough twists to keep him guessing.
But they bypassed the world that best fit, Oh well I\'ll save it for
later, Maybe next DunDraCon.

Oh that brings another thing up after my car accident, I understand the

Let\'s assume that for a moment, there is a spatial rift, how would 
this affect jump travel??  Would the rift merely force you out of 
jump, or would it cause a severe Mis-jump.  Perhaps sending you 
half-way across known space.
----

The fact is that there is actually very little we know about the 
universe and the nature of space.  We do, however, know that 
space-time is not homogeneous.  There is nothing to suggest that a 
"spatial rift" does not exists.   I would suggest that, because of 
the sensitivity of jump field expansion to gravity wells (space-time 
bending), <hmm, can you jump from a lagrange point?> there may be 
some anomoly caused if a vessel in jump-space were to pass through a 
pocket (ripple, rift, gap?) in space-time.  If these anomolies were 
rare enough or spaced correctly, it would be an unusual occurance for 
a jumping vessel to meet up with one, giving the appropriate 
incidence of unexplained mis-jumps.

Now that I\'ve justified your assumption, on to the rest --

A mis-jump would be the most acceptable (by the rules) consequence of 
a "ripple-strike" (or whatever you choose to call it).  But let\'s 
look into the possibility of discovering a stable, static ripple 
(gee, a wormhole? -- It\'s even been discussed by Stephen Hawking, 
though the would only exist for an instant at a time, not even long 
enough for light to pass through).

At a distance of 1 parsec from a low-pop, low-tech world, a stable 
ripple is discovered, charted and investigated.  When a ship jumps 
through the ripple on a specific vector, with certain jump 
parameters, the travellers find themselves in the center of the black 
curtain.  If the discoverers were the Zhodani . . . (begin sweating, 
towel-heads!)

Try that one on for size and see if it fits, folks.  Right now, I\'m 
getting a migraine thinking about the possibilities.  What if 
Grandfather hears about it?

A quick jump into the flame wars --

Although the VIRUS arguments will continue, I need to point out the 
obvious.  Most of us have been involved in games and campaigns that 
diverge from the official GDW plot lines.  We don\'t care, in those 
cases, where we are, why we\'re doing what we\'re doing or when the 
adventure takes place.  The game is supposed to be fun!  If you don\'t 
like the virus, sparklers, non-interbreeding of Aslani and Vargr, 
etc., then ignore these ideas in your world.  Marc Miller, if memory 
serves correctly, designed a game that could be set into any time 
period with any magic system you want.  That\'s the glory of the 
Traveller universe!

I\'ve dealt with magic (in the traditional sense), run a Viet Nam 
scenario, played with tech-levels in the 20\'s and even did an old 
west theme.  There are no rules to the contrary.  But everybody needs 
to remember, also, that there is an ongoing plot and agenda for the 
main-stream game.  Like it or not.  And if not, make up your own 
system.  It fits the rules.  (Although I\'ll admit that GDW seems to 
have forgotten the flexibility of the game system somewhat.)

{I\'m going to have to remember to return that razor to Occam.  -- If 
you understand that one, let the others in on it.}

Don\'t you think that it\'s time to get back to the problems at hand 
and start talking about the game rather than busy ourselves in 
flaming GDW, other contributors and Ideas that may, with a little 
thought, have some merit to the Traveller Universe?

Okay, all FLAME ON.  I have my "silver-suit" waiting.

       All the discussion of the GDW "official" history and how some
players can\'t pull themselves away to do their own variants reminded of
a humorous encounter I had a few days ago.  I was at my local game
pusher buying Aliens of the Rim, and got into a discussion with the
clerk about my upcoming campaign.  I mentioned that I was going to use
Efate/Regina as a "cyberpunk" environment (high-tech, low law, etc.),
another customer in the store got extremely upset and began challenging
me on "where is THAT written? You\'re not REALLY playing Traveller!"
       Needless to say, both the clerk and I were struck speechless by
this display.
       I humbly offer my prostrate and pathetic form before Loren (He

 You have the first printing BL (email me your snail-mail
 address and I\'ll send you the errata). The reason we use G-hours
 _and_ G-turns is because G-hours are used for calculating in-
 system travel time in TNE and G-turns are used in starship
 combat.
 
 The equation to which you refer should be to multiply MW by
 _2_, not 10. You will note that when using the corrected
 equation, this gives the same result as 20 tons per MW. You are
 absolutely correct that this makes it very hard for small craft
 to get high G-ratings. We are aware of this, and are satisfied
 with this effect.

Interesting point, eh? Okay, so it\'s not a zero-gravity point, just a
matched gravities leading to zero directional force, sort of argument, but
perhaps that\'s an interesting new place to jump to and from - coming in well

If you\'re totally stumped, one approach can be to reverse-engineer a
design from the rules.  Of course, this assumes that the design that
is in the rules is reasonable to begin with, which is usually but not
always true, alas.

Another thing to try is to work backwards from the performance that
you want to the numbers you need.  The FF&S design sequences are not
always the best way to set up a design -- you may find it easier to
jump around in the sequence a bit, doing different steps first than
the ones the rules suggest.

For instance, say you want to do 10 damage dice to a character at short 
range.  According to FF&S page 129, damage dice equals fifty times the
square root of intensity (I) in megajoules (MJ), or
  DD == 50 * (square root of I in megajoules).   [Rule 7D.]
  
You can use simple algebra to find out intensity if you have damage dice!
I == (( damage dice / 50 ) squared).  So for 10 damage dice, you need 
  I == (10/50)^2 == 0.04 MJ.
  
Of course, to get 0.04 MJ intensity, you need to go backward and figure
out the details of frequency, how much input energy you\'ll need, and the
size of your focusing lens.  This backward approach can work well.  The
sample 10 damage dice figure was borrowed from an official laser rifle
design.

   For God sake, I stated (and you can check the record) that IF you
wanted to use the Primordials in your campaign, GO AHEAD.  BUT, that
the current orthodoxy does not recognise the Primordials storyline.  I`d
like to see a show of hands here of all the people who run a STRICTLY

could not use them or for that matter have the Klingons or Battlestar

   Here in the glorious state of Ohio (a mere 6 hour drive from GDW
headquarters) it was out about 10 days ago (more or less).

   Vampire Fleets will be out later this month, possibly in May.  I have in
my possession a copy of Aliens of the Rim which I picked up last
Thursday.

   Say, what about that TNE adventure by that new kid Harold something
or other?  :)

Thanks for the very kind words.  You know, I was trying to come up with
something along the lines of "Sneaks and ...." and I just couldn\'t think
of the second term.  I\'d like something that ryhmes, like "Rats and Cats"
or "Cogs and Dogs," but the nearest I got was "Sneaks and Geeks," and I\'m
not sure that is as good as the other ones. 

Perhaps all you folks out there can take a crack at it and we can vote on 
the suggestions.

I\'ll do this, but I\'d like some feedback from the net first.  Comments

       After giving this a great deal of thought, (about 30 seconds
worth) I belive I have come up with a nickname:  STARFISH & STRAIGHTMEN.

       Catchy.  I like it.

       But seriously, I appreciate what GDW was trying to do with the
Ithklur, create a species whose day-to-day behavoir was
imcomprehensible, indeed, almost hilarious, to the average human.  The
attempt breaks down due to the overabundance of 20th century references
in the book. (Baseball, Monty Python, etc.) given that 3700 years have
passed, shouldn\'t there have been other human cultural refences for the
Ithklur to latch on to?
       I really want to like the Ithklur, but it\'s going to take alot of
work before they are allowed in my game.

I\'m going to steal from a couple of texts I read a while back, one of 
which by s. Hawkins <sp?>.  

A wormhole, as I understand, requires two black holes collapsing to
singularities (Hawkins is now working on the idea that singularities 
may not exist) .  It would then be possible for the singularities to 
touch each other through super-luminary space (Okay, fancy would I 
threw in.  It really means FTL, but you could insert hyper-space, 
sub-space or whatever.) for an instant.  In the present thought, this 
wormhole will exist for only an instant and may actually attach to an 
unknown number of singularities at the same time for too brief a time 
for even light to reach the other end.

In this case, only an object at super-luminary (there\'s that word 
again) speeds could ever hope to reach the other end, wherever that 
may be.  (Probability anyone?)  Exact timing and (I assume) exact 
jump parameters would be necessary with only a slim chance of 
success.

Now for the good side...

Develop a way of placing a ship in jump-space using an external 
device (alternate drives anyone?) connected to a whopping big 
computer of simple timing device.  (Whew boy, shades of Babylon-5 and 
star gates.  I must REALLY be tired.)  This way, users could be more 
assured of getting where they want to go because the gate could be 
tweaked as more is learned about the system.  Then watch F. Lee Baily 
sit around and wait for the first mis-jump.

In other possibilities which I really don\'t want to think too much 
about right now:

	Alternate universes
	Hyperspace combat
	Worlds between the singularities (where\'s the missing matter?)
	How do I get back without a jump-gate?
	Illegal left-hand turns would be a REAL bear

And so on.  I think I\'ve free thunk enough.

Happy world-building,

I don\'t understand Dave\'s sense of humour, but then I don\'t understand most
American comedy programs anyway.  Or maybe I\'m just getting old.  Leaving
aside the in-jokes, what\'s left is a reasonable piece of work.

Artwork is OK-to-good, and certainly better than in several recent products. 

Writing and production is better than many GDW products.  I caught a couple
of typos, but back in the early days of Megatraveller this would have been an
amazingly well-done book.

Briefly (because it\'s past midnight), I\'ll comment on previous reviews. 
Tomorrow I\'ll send a more complete one of my own.

The multiple views of history are canonical.  Even back in Classic Traveller
times we had multiple views of alien races.  (The Zhodani modules was CT, not
MT.)  This just adds one more example to the list.  Dave and Loren have
managed to convey a deeper sense of the variety of social viewpoints in the
Federation than the previous module did (while also plugging a few weak spots
from that module).  

As to the Ithklur fascination with old Terran motifs, this is a literary
technique often used in science fiction.  If you can accept the vast
stability of the Imperial universe then this shouldn\'t be a problem.  

Regarding the "humans in rubber suits" issue: I didn\'t get this impression. 
Instead, I thought that Dave/Loren is saying that although you might _try_ to
play an alien you are still a human, and so everything you see/think/do is
filtered through your human viewpoint.  

Given the arguments I\'ve had with people (some here, some elsewhere)
concerning human cultures I think this is optimistic: most people don\'t
really understand other human cultures.  

The game rules are useful and mercifully brief.  Character generation is
fully covered.  Suggestions for roleplaying are useful.  I particularly liked
the NPC motivations.

Well worth the money I paid.

Is the cover computer designed (Like World Tamers) or drawing?

Given my history, you\'re gonna be surprised, but I agree 
with this. Perhaps the Big Corp gaming approach of TSR and 
similar have destroyed forever the free exchange of ideas. 
Time was, people used to say "in my world" and a house rule 
or history was accepted as locally canonical. Nowadays, it 
seems, we seem determined to locate and cling to one 
canonical reality. How we have fallen. 

Right! I will, now and forever, forswear ranting about 
Virus. I\'m just going to suggest and design. So there.

 Well, I would have liked one-syllable nicknames, but I came up 
 with "Silent and Violent" (pronounce "si-lent and vi-lent")...

 Although, I look at the others, and they all smack of a certain 
 contempt for the races in question.  Perhaps that will allow for 
 "Bugs and Pugs", in spite of the Hivers not being insectoid.

For what it\'s worth, I like seeing discussion (argument even !) on the rules, it
helps me make sure I understand how things work, but I\'d rather we did
a bit more adventure/playing/fun type stuff ! It\'s easy to just say that, I know,
so I\'ll put my money where my mouth is ....

Watching TV the other night, it struck me how much fun you could have
with the RC stuff playing it sort of like ST:TNG. For Enterprise,
substitute an Aurora or Maggart class ship ("This is Captain Pat Ritter of
the RCS Thunderchild, answering your distress call. Can we be of
assistance ?"), and ditch the ship\'s counselor ("We\'ll worry about
feeling bad when & if we get back to base"), then go and recycle all
those old Star Trek plots.

(Just read Challenge #76. Gee, aren\'t GDW kind, they\'ve even put the
Borg in ;-) )

Of course, THIS time, when those pesky natives don\'t know what\'s good
for them ("But our religion/custom/other perverse reason forbids us
from speaking to outsiders/accepting your help/having a good time"),
the players & ref can throw the Prime Directive out the window and go
kick some ass ("I don\'t care if your Virus god DID give you food & water,
we\'ve nuked it now, but here\'s some rations & a vending machine").

Actually, would a TL 15 vending machine be a good idea with the Virus
about ? "Maybe we should scan that Twinkie before we eat it, just in
case....", "Err, is coke supposed to be green like that, & why is it fuming
?"

For some historical precedent to RC behaviour, think of the
US/USSR/GB/France & places like Somalia, Suez, Chad, and all those
other places big nations went to help out, even if sometimes for their
own, perhaps a little selfish, reasons, :-). The thing is, at ground zero,
lots of people aren\'t going to want to have a RC staging base or
whatever in their back yard, or visiting starships ("If we\'d been meant to
fly, we woulda been born with thruster plates"), or synthetic materials,
TV, etc. etc.

Oops, lost the point for a while there. Basically, the RC only have a
limited number of ships, and an increasing amount of space to check
out, so it\'s quite often going to be that old routine of one ship doing a
meet & greet, with only old information and scattered rumours from
merchants and the like (BTW: Whatever happened to rumour tables ?
They were fun !). In many ways, there are similarities with the old CT
adventures (Leviathan, Safari Ship, etc.), one ship exploring strange
new worlds, only this time, instead of doing it for your own selfish
reasons (Money ! Fame ! Large guns !), you\'re doing it for a good cause,
the expansion of the RC, and the betterment of humaniti. Well, maybe a
bit of selfishness can creep in, you can still have the fame and large
guns, but perhaps the money will have to wait. In other words, players
should be boldy going, and making names for themselves.

BTW, anyone seen or have stats for the Lancer & Fusilier class, as
mentioned in POT ?

	I tried to re-create various modern helicopters using FFS aircraft
	design rules, and I noticed that FFS designs require much more
	engine power than modern helicopters.
	That is, Huey Cobra uses 0.8 MW engine power to create 11 tons
	of lift, and FFS allows only 4-5 tons of lift per MW. This low
	effiency means that FFS-style Huey clone needs huge engines and
	consumes fuel like hell.
	Huey Cobra weights 9.5 tons, and corresponding FFS designs weights
	24.5 tons.
	However, if the lift/MW values are doubled, modern helicopters can
	be designed.

	----


	Volume-based aircraft design

	While the present aircraft design rules in FFS are based on the
	weight of the airframe, it is possible to design fixed-wing and
	rotary-wing aircraft by using the design rules from lift-vehicle
	chapter, and design evaluation rules from aircraft chapter.
	The main difference is that you can design armored aircraft with
	lift vehicle rules.

	----


	Displacement Tons

	When I was re-designing modern vehicles, I noticed that the numbers
	can be deceiving, for 1-ton vehicle is already quite large.
	I checked the volume of various modern vehicles and come up with
	following values:

	Vehicle Name	Approximate Volume in Displacement Tons
	----	----
	Motor bike	0.2  tons or less
	Family car	0.5-1.0 tons
	Van		1.0-2.0 tons
	APC		2.0 tons (M113)
	Helicopter	1.5 tons (Huey Cobra)
	Jet Fighter	2.0 tons (F-18 Hornet)
	MBT		4.0 tons (T-80)
	Large MBT	6.0 tons (M1 Abrams)

	Compared with these values, 12-ton MBT (Prairie Fire) and 4-ton
	LRV (Pandina) are quite large.

	----


	Hull Material Volume

	When I calculate the hull material volume (with Exel spreadsheet),
	I use the following formula:

	MV = Material Volume
	DT = Displacement Tons

	MV = (DT*14)-4/3*PI()*(((DT*14)/(4/3*PI()))^(1/3)-0,01)^3

	(Volume of spherical hull, minus the volume of a spherical hull
	which has 1 cm smaller radius. This difference gives the volume
	of 1 cm thich hull armor.)

	This formula gives quite similar values as Hull Size table in FFS,
	page 11, but the results begin to differ in the high and low ends
	of the table.
	
	Rate	Exel	FFS	Rate	Exel	FFS	Rate	Exel	FFS
	1	0.28	0.4	100	6	6	1000	28	28
	2	0.44	0.5	200	6.9	9	2000	44.6	43

	5	0.82	1.1	500	17.7	17	5000	82.1	80

	Either this formula is wrong, or there is some errors in the FFS table.

	Damage Dice for PAWS

	Does anyone know how much damage a particle beam will inflict
	to living targets? As PAWS are used mostly as spinal guns, the
	personnel damage is irrelevant, but the design rules allows PAWS
	to be downscaled into man-portable waaepons, and then personnel
	damage becomes an issue.

	Laser damage is ( 2.5 x sqrt(I) ).
	PAWS damage (and penetration) is ( 5 x sqrt(I) ).
	According to FFS, Lasers inflict 20 times more damege to living
	target than they inflict to non-living target.
	According to BL, a crew hit with PAWS will double the causualities.
	Does that mean, that PAWS Damage Dice would be ( 100 x sqrt(I) ) ???

If you can track it down, CT had a wonderfull module for explaining and 
generating Droyne characters. This was part of the Aliens module series.

It may take a bit of work to convert it to TNE stats.

If you can\'t track one down drop me a line via mail, after a couple of 
weeks. Exams dontcha know.

No a lift vehicle has to be rated as a lift vehicle NOT an aircraft because 
lift vehicles do not derive lift from aerodynamic surfaces. Instead they use 
a lifting mechanism such as contragrav or ducted fans.
However I would not rule out the use of rotary-wing systems to provide the 
lift and maybe part of the thrust of a lift vehicle.
What seems to be required is some rules for the amount of aerodynamic lift 
for different configurations of lift vehicles.

The extra crew casualties in BL are supposedly due to radiation damage. This 
is probably a carry-over from the previous High Guard / MT rules.
I do not recall any special treatment of PAWS damage so I suppose PAWS just 
get their normal damage and penetration. ( I don\'t have my rules with me so 
I could be wrong about that ;-)

Or, to simplify (i.e. check this out in my mind):
Total vol TV = DT*14 = (4/3)*PI*(R^3) where...
Total radius (assuming spherical) = R = ((DT*14)/((4/3)*PI))^(1/3)
And the volume of a sphere 1cm smaller in radius is NV =
(4/3)*PI*((R-0.01)^3)
Which basically comes out to Antti\'s equation above.

Yes, I started an excel spreadsheet for this and it\'s clear that FF&S has
altered the values to fit some predefined function. It\'s not just a case of
perhaps using R+0.01 in the above equation - there\'s a definite
non-linearity in there somewhere which can\'t be explained, even by strange
rounding algorithms. Perhaps someone did the calculations by hand on the
back of an envelope?

What about the original CT adventure Twilight\'s Peak? I think that had
Droyne character generation in it? And there\'s some information in Research
Station Gamma (CT Adv 2?) which is more oriented to Chirpers, but is still
relevant.

Subj:	RE: Navy Warfare

After WW1, the Battle Cruiser was designed. It was a lightly armored =
cruiser that would be harder to hit due to it\'s speed.  It was discovered =
very quickly in ww2 that even if one in 200 shots hit is as opposed to 1 =
in 100 shots, without the armor this fewer hits did far more damage and =
was therefor a bad trade.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Just a quick historical comment;

The battlecruiser was invented by the UK *before* WWI. At that time bat-
tleships could only make 20-22 knots so they removed alot of the armor
& put in more boilers to get the speed up to 27-30 knots. They were NOT
originally meant to be used in the battleline but with a main gun arma-
ment almost as good as battleships the temptation just couldn\'t be resisted,
with disastrous results. After the war the best features of both were com-
bined to create the \'fast\' battleships that were built in the late \'30\'s
forward. Interestingly enough Germany was ahead of the rest of the pack
on this count. Her BC\'s had always had armor almost as good as the BB\'s
& by 1917 had even begun working on what was essentially fast BB\'s. Work
was abandoned, however, due to the exigencies of the war. France & Germany
both built a pair of what were essentially up-armored BC\'s before WWII
while the US built some during the war. The US Navy called their\'s CB\'s
instead of BC\'s & they were essentially up-gunned heavy-cruisers. From
what I\'ve read the USN had no intention of using them against capital
ships. The program was begun due to persistent pre-war reports that Japan
was building an improved version of the German \'pocket\' battleships.

Again, how would the Imperials know if another empire was located on the =
other side of the Zhodani?  Do you think many Kkree know about the Aslan? =
 Do the Zhodani know much about the Hiver?  And the Imperium is an open =
border for trade compared to the Zhodani border....
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Open sources of info would be more than enough to find out about the
other side of the Imperium. Standard Library Data can be easily accessed. 
And don\'t forget that the Hivers had a trade delegation present in the 
\'Marches. I don\'t think the Zhodani could overlook that. Finding out about
the \'other side\' of the states surrouding the Imperium would be tougher but
the Imperium still could find out about the "other side" of the Consulate 
thru info from the various minor states along the rimward edge of the Con-
sulate, for example. Any info that becomes public knowledge in any of the
major powers would be soon found by the others, IMO, by various & insundry
means.

Subject: Supplies for merc campaign
Date: Thursday, March 30, 1995 9:22AM

Since my last chart got mangled by email I sent it again with
underlines in between.
                         
          1 Platoon of 40 men           
          1 Day of supplies             
                         
________Percentage______supplies in kg____   Mult. for volume___Volume in tons
Ammo__    0.42____________    3360____kg____________0.5________1.68 

Fuel____  0.5_____________    4000____kg____________1.0________4 
Food___   0.03____________    240_____kg____________ 1.0_________0.12 

Spares__0.05____________ 400_____kg____________1__________0.4    
Total___________________ 8000____kg_______________________6.2

So for a company multiply by 3-4. (depending on size)
For a battalion muliply by 9-12(depending on size)
1 Fat trader would have 32 platoon days worth of supplies.
This means 1 platoon for 32 days or 32 platoons for 1 day.
If Fuel is locally supplied then you could supply 64 "platoon days"
worth of supplies in 1 Fat trader.
 If you have fusion power divide the fuel supplies by 20.  If you have a large
percentage of laser weapons you could also lower your ammo supplies.
Local ammo sources would be great but what is the local tech level?
You can see that attacking a planet with a hostile enviroment and no
local allies would be a logistic nightmare.

  I was recently watching Deep Space Nine, and the thought crossed my =
mind that the Vargr make good replacements for the Ferengi.  In the =
ST:TNG episodes about the Klingon civil war, where a duel gets fought =
over honor durring a staff meeting with the Klingon High Command, I had =
visions of Aslan dancing about my head.  The sneaky Zhodani (at least, =
according to the Imperial they are sneaky) work well as a Romulan =
replacement, replacing cloaks with Psionics.  Sword Worlders could =
replace Kardasians in a pinch, if your campaign has them more =
expansionistic, but I here the Sword Worlds are no more in TNE.  
  I would hesitate to put a worm hole of equivelent in my campaign, but a =
deep space station designed to allow jump-2 traffic to cross a four =
parsec rift might do just as well, or allow jump-4 traffic to cross an 8 =
parsec rift! (Jump-2 ships could still do it if they carry extra fuel or =
drop tanks).  The station refuesl ships from a captured interstellar =
comet, or using a large magnetic funnel to suck hydrogen from a protostar =
deep in space, and you haven\'t changed the Traveller physical laws at =
all, but still have a strategic military spot and interstellar cross =
roads.  
  
   A Star Trek Voyager campaign could be easly set up if a Jump 2 Aurora =
miss jumped 36 parsecs away.  Just finding a jump-2 rout home and all the =
adventures along the way could last quite a while. Have the drive reduced =
to Jump 1 and you have an even longer campaign.

   If you perfer to copy Larry Nivens Known Space story style, the Aslan =
can replace the Kzinti, the Hivers make good Puppetiers, and the Ancients =
replace the Slavers.  I have already seen RingWorld type adventures in =
PBEM and in regular campaigns.

     The standard one-week-thingy about jumps has always bothered me,
since we\'re all gettin\' stuff off our collective chests.  Shouldn\'t it
vary a little more by distance?  Even having longer jumps for *closer*
destinations would at least be intuitively acceptable.



     I have only one comment about Aliens of the Rim, Vol. 1 (since I
haven\'t read it all yet...  just got it today...):

LOREN!!!  How could you permit that hideous, awful, absolutely heinous
pun on the back of Hivers and Ithklur?!  The attornies for the advertisers
of the producers of the _Alien_ flick are probably livid, or amused, or
just (like me) smacking their foreheads, aggie-style, and saying, "Doh!"

     Fellow TMLers, especially those darn foreigners whose distribution
infrastructure seems even worse than our own in the U.S., please judge for
yourselves the pun at which I shudder, from the back of "Hivers & Ithklur":

Notes:

The "Julian" Class Armed Scout was designed on Aquitaine in the early 1190\'s
as a multi-purpose ship capable of independent exploratory missions beyond
the borders of the Near Bootes Commonwealth.  The Type 11 (the type\'s formal
designation) carries a reasonable weapons array (normal loadout consists of
3 120Mj Laser turrets), and is relatively well armoured.

The Type 11 is now being produced under license by most of the Commonwealth
worlds, with variations in design.  The most common variant is the Type
11-2, with jump maneuver drives downgraded to jump-2 and 1G respectively.
The increased cargo space has made this variant a popular merchant craft,
gradually replacing old Free and Far Traders as they wear out.  The Type
11-3 sacrifices maneuver performance for an impressive sensor and ECM array,
while the Type 11-5 (produced by Hamilcar), with no jump drives and 4G
maneuver, is the mainstay of that world\'s system defense force.

To date, 23 examples of this type have been produced:  11 Type 11-0/1\'s, 8
Type 11-2\'s, 1 Type 11-3 and 4 Type 11-5\'s.  Production continues.

Stats above are for the Type 11-1.

 Yep. That\'s why most people tend to ignore logistics in their
 recreational gaming (despite its vital importance in real life).
 What miniatures gamer (to use my own hobby as an example) would
 want to paint an army of 30 trucks for every tank?

 There _are_ "magic lamps" in _Hunt for Red October_. Its just
 such a good read that most people don\'t notice, and those who
 notice don\'t care. Traveller is a game. If it were as realistic
 as "real life" it would take as long to play and require as many
 PCs.

 That was certainly the original notion...the first few
 supplements were non-background specific with this idea in mind.
 We rapidly found that the vast majority of our customers wanted
 (nay, _demanded_) a background, so Marc and Frank decided to give
 them one.

 And Now a word from Dave Nilsen:
 
 Report from GDW -- April 7, 1995
 
 This is something new we\'re trying here, to help GDW customers
 stay a little more up-to-date with what\'s going on around the
 Workshop. I\'m thinking that some short update on a weekly basis
 from either Frank or myself would be nice, but just have to see
 what kind of schedule we can keep to.
 
 Vampire Fleets is typeset and is in the art department, having
 its maps and deckplans executed, etc. It will be out in May.
 
 Command Post Quarterly #9 is also in art, again, having its
 maps executed, and will also have a May release.
 
 Challenge 77 is in the art stage as well, same comments,
 although the issue\'s artists are also involved in drawing the
 interior art. Challenge 77 will be out in June.
 
 The second of the Traveller novels, _To Dream of Chaos_ should
 have its final rewrite back from Paul Brunette and into
 typesetting in about a week. The interior art is being executed
 concurrently, and so we will have it out in June.
 
 The _Regency Sourcebook: Keepers of the Flame_ is being
 written. To answer a common question, it will include several
 Regency-specific starships, such as the Quarantine Cutter,
 Inspection Launch, and TL-15 versions of common starships such as
 the Free, Far, and Fat Traders. It will be out in July.
 
 We are starting work on the Epics line (see elsewhere for what
 the ad looks like). The first of these will be a three-parter for
 TNE called _Virus Redux_. This will see the RC expand through the
 Diaspora Sector and into Massilia. Loren is also working on the
 first Twilight: 2000 Epic, which will be a retelling of the
 original Twilight: 2000 adventures Free City of Krakow, Pirates
 of the Vistula, etc. This is in response to overwhelming pleas
 for updated versions of these classic old adventures into the new
 Version 2.2 system. However, these will not be simple re-hashes
 of the old scenarios. The elements will be familiar to old-hand
 T2Kers, but there will be significant differences in play to
 allow old and new T2K players alike to enjoy them. Part 1 of the
 Vistula Epic will be out sometime this summer.
 
 Three other epics will follow, including a Regency epic,
 detailing the break-out into the Wilds, and a follow-on to the
 Virus Redux epic that will take the RC from Massilia up to the
 Black Curtain. (My apologies to those who have been expecting a
 Black Curtain adventure in Vampire Fleets. That was our original
 plan, but these plans were recast in the past few months when the
 project changed hands from me to Frank. We decided that there
 were still several interesting issues to explore closer to home
 before taking the campaign all the way to the Black Curtain, but
 we will get there.) The fifth epic is a Hiver & Ithklur epic
 entitled _Into the Belly of the Beast_,
 which will explore the questions, "Are the Ithklur really this
 crazy, and if so, why?" "Are the Hivers really this crazy, and if
 so, why?" and "What is really going on inside of the Federation?"
 
 Farther Down the Road:
 
 Paul Brunette is working on the storyline for the third
 Traveller novel, and beyond that will undertake a novel that
 springboards from the third novel of the Hornet trilogy into the
 Hive Federation.
 
 Frank is working with the authors of a second Traveller
 trilogy, although that trilogy is clearly not so far along as
 Paul Brunette\'s. Incidentally, Paul Brunette has produced a
 Challenge article that presents the characters of the Hornet
 trilogy as TNE characters, which will appear in Challenge 78.
 
 _Armor 21_ will also be out this summer as an adjunct to
 Twilight: 2000 in the same spirit as Merc: 2000. Armor 21 will be
 further supported in Command Post Quarterly by rules,
 organization, and vehicle ratings that will allow Armor 21 to be
 played using the Command Decision rules.
 
 And that\'s the way it is at GDW, April 7, 1995.
 
 Talk to you again soon.
 
 Love and kissies,
 
 Dave

You didn\'t pay too much attention to the conversation (or to the rules
changes either).

First: I\'m not a physicist.  I don\'t know enough about physics to
be unable or unwilling to suspend disbelief in jump drives or gravitic
technology.  I don\'t have that liberty in regards to Virus.

Second: The reactionless thrusters aren\'t part of canon anymore.
Thruster plates and related technology are optional technologies in
FF&S.

GDW felt the need to remove reactionless movement from Traveller for
the sake of "realism".  Why did they just handwave over the technical
and social stupidities of Virus?

So what does that tell you about how good a read TNE is when those who

I not only accept simplifications, I applaud them (if they are well done).
What gets me hot under the collar is when two of your rules contradict
each other or when your rules produce patently absurd results. Forget
realism. But could you try for a little more versimilitude?

Perhaps you miss the point. A game with fuzzy rules is no fun playing. I
know that it\'s the Referee\'s job to resolve conflicts, but it is YOUR
job to help him the best you can.

If the report is accurate (which I intend to check for myself) you\'re not
writing Traveller stuff any more except in a purely legal sense.

Sure, that dosen\'t bother me. But if the bit about the aliens-are-just-
humans-in-rubber-suits is accurate then you lost at least one sure sale.
(You know, I just _can\'t_ make myself believe that it can be true.)

To give themselves more time to work out the bugs? :)

I used to be up there with the biggest anti-Virus crowd myself, but
I\'ve been thinking about this a little.  The fast non-volatile memory
that shows up at tech-9 (which would probably replace both ROM and
RAM in most systems) and synaptic computers that, to at least some
extent, can program and restructure themselves (tech-11) present some
interesting possibilities.  Virus could then fairly easily lodge 
itself into tech-9+ computers and wake up in tech-11+ computers, which
would be the majority of Imperial computers.  And lower tech systems
would tend to be not just stupider and less flexible, but also more
like the initial system configuration, since there are less synaptics
in lower tech computers.  The technology was established in MT for
this.  Something like Virus might be workable, especially with the
decision that the resources of Imperial Intelligence\'s computer
gurus can get in on it.  I\'ll be interested to see if the "canonical"
explanation is plausible, assuming one is given.

Still pondering this one....

SMART Library Data Network, 001-1120     

Imperial Classical Movement:  a philosophical, cultural, and educational 
  movement popular with the social elite of the high population worlds
  of the Imperium.  Reaching its\' peak in popularity during the late
  ninth and early tenth centuries Imperial, "Imperial Classicism"
  still has an important influence on modern secondary education at all
  levels of Imperial society.

  Classicism is marked by its\' focus on the crucial historical period
  which surrounded Solomani-Vilani contact, the era from about the
  twenty-sixth to the twenty-third centuries pre-Imperial.  As pointed
  out by the classicists, the events and cultural movements of this
  era had a seminal role in the shaping of the modern Imperium.

  For many years, classical training was considered vital preparation
  for attendance at an undergraduate university or the Naval Academy
  by the nobility.  An off-shoot of Solomani theories of liberal 
  education that date back six millenia, the traditional classical
  training is intended to produce a "free individual" that possesses 
  the best speech, conduct, and abilities.  

  In the best programs, the historical and cultural background of the
  era is used to provide a context to help discuss modern history,
  sociology, and the basis of the social conflicts in the Imperium.
  Students are expected to be skilled in one of the classic languages 
  of the era before matriculation.  Training in the theoretical and 
  social sciences, fine arts, and athletics are also considered vital 
  to the liberal education of a civilized being.  
 
  Study of the classics have declined in recent years, with a de-emphasis
  of classical history and increased teaching of modern languages having
  become more prevalent in Imperial secondary education.  However, it is
  still fairly common for new students at the Imperial Sylean University
  to have a strong preparatory background in classical studies.

----
Rules for use with TNE:

Two of the four "background skills" slots (TNE, p. 23) must be used
for the skills History-2 and Language-2.  For Language, the player
must take either 
  Language(Classical English)-2   
or
  Language(High Vilani)-1
  Language(Classical Written Vilani)-1.

The remaining two background skills may be taken as usual, with the
following additions to the allowed Background Skills List.  In fact,
add them anyway:
  Dance           [What, not teaching dance?  Why, that won\'t *do*!]
  Persuasion      [Rhetoric, don\'t you know.]
  Carousing       

For high nobles, you might want to consider a +1 EDU stat to reflect
their reciept of the best education, and not apply the bonus to the
usual +2 limit to the first six UPP stats (so their EDU could still
go up another two points).
----

The twenty-sixth century pre-Imperial runs from AD 1918 to AD 2017.

I once had a campaign with a player whose noble character was nuts 
for ancient history, particularly the "minus twenty-sixth century".
The other players played him for laughs.  He\'d bring up some -26th
century reference, and they\'d pretend they had no clue.  For that
matter, so did my NPCs.  :)  But his "joke" skills in ancient
languages and history actually came in handy for the adventurers
on a number of occasions.

According to the back story, he went to a school like this when he
was young.  For whatever it\'s worth, enjoy!

Hi All,

Is anyone out there interested in discussing alternate 
player character definition?

I\'ve always felt that most RPGs tend to produce rather
2-D characters. It remains the responsibility of the
player to add variation beyond the six digits of attributes.
I\'m not saying that players shouldn\'t have to do this.
I am just looking for house rules which other gamers have 
developed to add diversity to their characters. Topics like
alternate attributes, different skill definitions, and 
additional personality rules spring to mind.  


TTFN,

Glenn

 We\'ve received an increasing number of letters, calls, and
 EMail concerning the difficulty in finding Traveller material in
 local stores. This is a real concern for us, and one we\'d
 appreciate your help with. Here\'s what you can do for us, if
 you\'re interesting in getting the products in your store.
 
 1) Ask your retailer. Retailers want to stock the games you
 want to buy. That\'s why they\'re there. If you bug them regularly,
 they will find a way to get the stuff.
 
 2) Send us the name, address, and phone number of stores that
 are having trouble getting the material. We can easily hook them
 up with a distributor who has the material or, if they are
 already hooked up with one, find out what went wrong in the
 communication chain.
 
 Thanks. This could mean a lot to us.

Hi All,

about time for a contribution I think, I\'ve been lurking for a 
couple of months now.

Well one commercial solution of which I am aware is the 
"Central Casting" series by Paul Jaques(spelling?).  These 
books are a long series of random event tables used to 
generate a character\'s backround, by the time you\'re finished 
you will know all about a character\'s life and be provided with 
several adventure hooks (enemies, unresolved events in the 
characters life etc) for later use.  At the same time 
personality traits are generated, these are loosly linked to the 
events, eg a good event produces a random "good" 
personality trait.  This means that people who\'ve had a hard 
life will tend to be nasty etc.

All of this may sound good, however in play I have found 
several drawbacks.
1) it takes hours to make all the die rolls required.
2) after the random events are generated someone has to 
weave them into a consistent story for the character, this 
also takes time(although it\'s enjoyable).
3) characters are too well defined, my players feel they have 
little scope for further development.
4) some players don\'t care for this type of thing and all my 
work generating an interesting PC is wasted as he is played 
as just another 786A59 !

My solution to these problems has been to just use the 
proceedure defined for generating NPC\'s.  This gives plenty 
of variety and a player gets something to hang their ideas on 
rather than a full detailed character.

The Sci-Fi book in the series is called "heroes for tomorrow", 
although the modern-day book"heroes now" is good to, as it 
has extra procedures for personality generation.

Unlike  with some other gaming systems, I never really  have
seen  my  traveller  NE  (or  even  GDW\'s  Dark  Conspiracy)
characters  as just a six digit number.  I think the  reason
for  this is I tend to personally emphasize the life history
generated when the character is generated.  This is probably
a  good  reason  why  I  usually  do  not  play  very  young
characters as they are not fully fleshed out to get  a  good
role-playing feel.

Sometimes  the  skills most useless in  play  are  the  most
important in defining the type of character.  As an example,
I  present a character that I have played, Dr. Paul Nunsome.
Dr.  Nunsome\'s primary skill is in robotics, but he has some
skills  in  Xeno-biology  and a minor  skill  in  sculpting.
After  all, a robot\'s got to both look good, work well,  and
not  be  confused with a human. He also has minor skills  in
marketing, but so far no one has been buying.

As  can be seen in the above example, I place an emphasis on
combinations of skills rather than new skills to  flesh  out
the  character  in  all his dimensions.   I  also  place  an
emphasis on his actual play time history, which can mold and
shape the character in accordance with the player, the other
players and the GM.

Glenn Myers <gem188@ansys.com> also stated:

However, in general I do agree with the statement that  most
RPG\'s  tend  to produce 2-d characters.  It  is  up  to  the
players  to add the 3rd dimension through their roleplaying,
and  any  attempts  by the system tend only  o  create  more
detailed 2-d characters.  How the player sees the numbers is
more important than the numbers themselves sometimes.

        Since I don\'t buy Traveller very much (dissapointing when you pick
up a technicle manual or a book stuffed with rules) I am not familiar with
the Primordials? Are they in a Traveller product, or something I can get off
of the net?

Way back in Challenge 35, there was an article, "The Spice of Life", about
adding a personality profile to the UPP.  Using the tables you came u with
the numbers of parents, siblings, acquaintances.  Then you created the
perosnality: allegiance, devotion, stability handle, leadership, respect
for authority, intolerance.  A freind modified the character background 
gereration for Cyberpunk to use in Traveller.

Notes:

Until the first "Aquitaine" Class Frigate enters service, the "Republique"
Class Barque is the largest military starship yet to be constructed in the
Commonwealth.
The "Republique", or Type 14 Barque is an evolutionary design based on the
600t "Eyre" Class TL-11 Barques already in service.  Advances in technology
led to the design of a larger and more capable "Eyre", with an upgraded
sensor and weapons package.  The first example of this class (the "Medoc
Republique") entered service with the Medoci Navy in 1197.

Like almost all Commonwealth starships, the Type 14 is capable of surface
landings.  It also carries a 95 ton shuttle for landings on unknown or
potentially hostile worlds.  Designed for armed exploration and
reconnaisance, the Barque carries a complement of 12 troops (Commonwealth or
local marines).  Fuel scoops and an on-board purification plant give the
ship the capacity to mount long missions without support.

Five "Republique" Class Barques are currently in service:

Gee, there\'s one unhappy customer....

I hate to say this, Mark, but I\'m going to side with Rob on this one
and agree that _Hiver & Ithklur_ is, IMHO, getting a bit more flack 
than it really deserves.  Clearly, you disagree.  :)

I admit, it has problems.  The rather badly handled so-called "joke"
about Scot regiments on page 51 should never have left the building,
disclaimer or no -- I mean, it was questionable and also needed an 
*explanation*, for goodness sake!  IMHO, it should have been locked
in a filing cabinet and plasma-torched with a FGMP-15.  Be free. :)
The sort of decrease in...I don\'t know exactly what, seriousness?...
that that represents is not cool.  Others may read that differently.
The section on Ithklur "Friendliness" on page 62 goes a bit over 
the top with the 20th century references, which can be grating.  
And the disinformation can really mess up the coherence of the book 
-- but it can be viewed as a liability or as an asset for the ref.

However, I actually think that I like the Ithklur design.  If they
show up in my campaign, the characters will be expected to fail to
understand a lot of the references they\'re making.  It looks to me
like the Ithklur have a sophisticated and obscure sense of humor.
I suspect that they\'re being both deliberately obscure, and playing
"games" with the humans, too, but it\'s a different sort of "game"
than they play with their patrons, the Hiver.  They seem to like
fishing for reactions...the typical human reaction on hearing what
they call K\'kree must be priceless, and possibly worth it to the 
Ithklur to change their language to keep things honest.  Besides,
I don\'t think the Hiver have much of a sense of humor from a human,
and possibly Ithklur point of view.  Other oddities can be explained
away with forgotten Solomani influences from before the human Long
Night, actual quirks of Ithklur culture, and so on as appropriate.

In any case, they could be fun to have around for role-playing 
purposes, to play off the characters.  Some comic relief, too.
Probably is part of the point, after all.

One interesting thing about Ithklur characters is that they are
*smarter* than the average human, and can beat the human maximum
INT in character generation by two points....

As for the Hiver, well, I like the Hiver.  I like the K\'kree, too.
They both tend to work best as NPCs, but they\'re still fun.  And
Hiver equipment is just funky -- the hexoculars are nicely done.

Anyway, that\'s my opinion.  I think the new supplement is worth 
checking out, and there\'s certainly plenty in there that I can use.

Perhaps you and Rob missed MY point, although Rob\'s quote (above) says it
fairly well: I AM an expert in that field, and I DO find problems with it.

Other people (including Rob, I believe) wrote similar posts, too.

That\'s not exactly what I meant.  As Rob (and I and the original poster)
pointed out, there are factual problems in _Red October_ that any nuc would
be able to point out to you.  For them, I\'m sure, the story was less
enjoyable than it might have been because of this. 

My point was, that because I DO see the holes in the Virus, I personally
(and most emphatically NOT speaking for anyone else) have as much
difficulty swallowing the Official New Era timeline as most of Clancy\'s
readers would have IF he had written "Captain Ramius carefully polished the
old brass lamp with a handful of cotton waste.  Soon, a misty smoke issued
from the lamp, and coalesced into a blue genie, hanging in the stale air
before him ..."

Clear?

> Traveller is a game.

True enough.  It\'s also a product that someone (you? Dave? Frank?) would
like me to buy.  If I have a problem with the quality of the products I
purchase, I\'ll certainly tell you.

Depending on how big the problem is, it may or may not lose you the sale.  

In the case of the T:TNE rules, the asking price is still reasonable even
when I disregard the hundred-odd pages of background material that I don\'t
care for and didn\'t particularly want included in the rules.  Similarly,
Fire, Fusion and Steel delivers useful material at a reasonable price.

Brilliant Lances was more problematic: the price was high for that game,
particularly when you consider how much of the rules included with it
should have been in the T:TNE rulebook, or were revised and republished
in FF&S.  For this and other reasons, I refrained from purchasing Battle
Rider.

The more specialized New Era suppliments are increasingly less useful to me,
and so I\'m increasingly less likely to spend my money on them.  After having
read the designers\' notes in H&I, I sure don\'t want to spend my money on
it.  It\'s just a game, sure.  And it\'s just my money.  If you want me to
spend the latter on the former, expect to work for it.

Think about this for a bit: T:TNE, plus FF&S, the Path of Tears and
Equipment books, plus the Aliens book, comes to a total over $60.
For that you can buy in paperback more than ten SF books - say some
of Cherryh\'s "Chanur" books, Niven\'s "Known Space", or others from
Asimov, Clarke, Dickson, Anderson and so on; plus rent the entire
Star Wars movie series for a night.

Do I, as a customer, deserve less for my entertainment dollar because
it\'s "just a game"?  I certainly realize that no game publisher has 
the economies of scale and vertical integration that book publishers
or movie studios have, but that\'s no reason to settle for less in the
realm of storytelling, research, and the level of creative effort put
into the product.  I vote with my wallet (and this is one election
in which you can vote early and vote often - legally!).

> If it were as realistic as "real life" it would
> take as long to play and require as many PCs.

Nobody\'s asking for "real life" here.  On the other hand, what\'s the
point of writing something like FF&S when the same effort isn\'t put
into the other areas of the game?  Or are guns the real stars of the
game, and all else just meaningless fluff, filler and comic relief?

In my (not so) humble opinion, T:TNE should have been designed the
same way, and (if that\'s what the distributors demanded) also made
in a boxed set with a background booklet.  The current T:TNE rulebook
is at least 100 pages too long to be used comfortably (and the extra
weight isn\'t doing the binding much good, either) and I understand
that the distributors have complained about bulk of T:TNE, too.

It\'s worth noting that one game system that gets a LOT more shelf
space in my local game store than all of GDW\'s products combined
is designed around just such a concept.  From everything that I\'ve
seen and read, it has been a very successful product.

It\'s a game that can be set in any time period, with just about
any magic system that you want.  It doesn\'t come with any background
built into the rules, although there are plenty of suppliments
available that provide this to those that want it.

I am, of course, referring to Steve Jackson Games\' GURPS.

resent having to wade through a great deal of juvenile humor to get to 
what I need.  The word "filler" comes to mind more and more often as I 
read through it again.

Perhaps I\'ve been spoiled by the late lamented DGP, but "Sneaks and

One other thing I want to make clear - I like the New Era background as a 
whole.  Frankly, it brought me back from my MegaTraveller-induced nap.  I 
find the Virus fun as a plot device, I\'m looking forward to more about 
the Black Curtain, the RC, and the Regency, and with the exception of 
FF&S, I use all of the books published for TNE.  My recent criticism of 
H&I and the first Traveller novel should be seen as dissatisfaction with 
particular products, not the system as a whole.

Hello There,

Loren Glad to see you again I\'d thought you had given us up totally.

Mark Clark... That wasn\'t very nice, If you do not like the style...
then you can "vote with your checkbook". no need to be nasty about it.
By the way I haven\'t picked up the " Aliens of the RIM " yet. I have
gotten a chance to look at it, at our last game, Jim has it, and I liked
what I saw. So if Games of Berkeley will EVER get it in I will
definetely get it!
( I think that it is just timing; but they never seem to have what I\'m
looking for when I go there. :-) )

On the subject of LaGrange points, I don\'t think that they would be
useful as jump points for several reasons, allowing that you could jump
to it without grav based problems.

one: Most highly technical and populas systems will have stations parked
there. Such useful points could hardly be passed up even with the
difficulties. ( see below )

two: If I remember my astronimy correctly... these points tend to sweep
up a lot of small junk, causing...
1. Grav problems.
2. Hull integerty problems...

Three: I don\'t know about your merchant Captian, but Mine is NOT going
to want our Navigator to try such a precise jump as to come out in a La
Grange point! If you want to enter jump there be my guest it could work
and I might allow it for an emergancy... But you would be taking
Chances...

Well another game session passes without any combat, But I have a
feeling that our GM has something planned at our next stop. He has been
just a little to adamat about the conditions in that system, kinda makes
me wonder... ;-) ( Hi Jim ;-) )

Well I\'ve babbled on enough.

       I recently came across a book that should be in every Traveller
GM\'s library.  "What If The Moon Didn\'t Exist?" (Neil Comins,
HarperPerennial) takes a look at ten alternate Earths.  The title
chapter examines the effects of Earth not possessing a companion: faster
rotation, minimal tides, the changes in the development of life.
       Other chapters ask questions related to the axial tilt, mass of
the sun, the effects of a near-by supernova, and so on...
       I highly recommend this book to anyone who designs detailed
worlds, you\'ll find dozens of hints for turning UPP stats in to living
places.  Any GM will find adventure ideas turning up in some of the
sidenotes.

Generic dislike of the puritanical/fundamentalistic
application of \'bizarre sexuality\' as a darkside trait
in the Future (and likely Past and/or Present) version
of this suppliment.  You get a nice big warning that
some people can\'t handle dealing with it, too.
Thanks, but I\'ll decide how my various cultures deal

    Actually, Guy, all us Navy nukes loved that story.  Not because it was
perfect or anything, but because it was close enough to perfect that we
all wondered where Clancy got the (classified) information he put into
that book...
    Hmmm....seems anything else I say on the subject might bounce off

away at times.  The reason I do, however, is that I\'m fairly passionate
about Traveller - played since 1979 ("Late Carter Administration"), own
just about everything published for the game, play it as much as I can.
As I pointed out in my response to Steve yesterday, I like the New Era
background.  Unlike others on this list, I\'m not going to whine about
Virus - even if I didn\'t like the idea (and I do), there is no way GDW is
going to change that part of the universe.  What I seek to do with my
comments is to perhaps guide the flavor and contents of future products.
Let me be clear - when a product I like is released (like Path of Tears
or Smash and Grab), I will be the very first to post a favorable review here.

As for voting with my pocketbook, well, I\'m such a Traveller junky that
I\'ll buy anything with the words Traveller on it.  My purpose in doing
these reviews is to help those who aren\'t as addicted as I am to make
choices.

Again, sorry you and others took offense at the heat of my remarks, but I
stand by my reviews.

P.S. How do you know that the Hivers didn\'t put me up to that review so
as to generate some sympathy for Dave and GDW?  Then again, maybe I\'m an
Ithklur trying to keep a little privacy - the fewer who read about us the
better, you know.  Getting confused yet?  Well, that\'s how I felt after
reading "Sneaks and Geeks".

Rocket has a Fc of 4.5 tonnes per hour per tonne of thrust, and HRF has a

Howdy,

I started to run a BR game via computer and found it was pretty intensive.
I thought I\'d make a suggestion for you:

Number the hexes in some common way, including headings for the six
directions, and allow for a MUCH larger playing field than the maps 
provided by GDW.

We found (Les, Michel, and I) that the game started really demanding the
extended area, and they wanted to dive into the "no contact at start" 
games...

Merrick Burkhardt came up with some Bogey detection rules that seem to
work very well within the system. You can find them at the FTP site
ghost.cc.missouri.edu /PUB/Traveller/TNE/FFS_etc/bogey.detection
or I can post them to you.

TL 14 Meson Gun (Solomani)

Bore:           4.58 m
Power Required: 69.4 MW
Volume:         2383 m^3
Mass:           2291 t
Length:         120 m

Damage: Short 5:240 Medium 10:118 Long 20:60 Extreme 40:30

Crew:           5
Price:          MCr 203.32

Specs include integral Homopolar Generator and Beam Pointer (both at TL-14).

The MG-120/3 was the standard Light Meson Gun in the Solomani Confederal
Navy.  It was produced in large numbers for a number of Light Cruiser
designs, most notably the \'Malkop\' Class Light Cruiser (10000t).  The Malkop
was produced in great numbers by the Solomani as both a line warship and
commerce raider.

Two Malkop Class ships have been recovered by the Commonwealth.  The
\'Voronezh\', now the AME-0034 \'Jean d\'Arc\', entered service with the Medoci
Navy (Aquitaine) after a lengthy refit in 1199, while the \'Polyarny\' is
undergoing restoration in orbit around Teucer for the Royal Teuceri Navy
(the \'Polyarny\' is expected to be renamed TE-0011 \'Prince Nomura\'.

Reports from CEF missions suggest that at least one Malkop Class cruiser is
in the hands of a potentially hostile power, based spinward of the Near
Bootes Commonwealth.

Both lasers are of the tunable type.  Both are listed as powered to
normal ROF levels -- can go up to -2 Diff Mod (at x10 power).  I
checked what would happen to the 100-ton bay if it were beefed up
to handle -5 Diff Mod; performance would fall to 1/64-200, and the
other stats of the bay would also change slightly.

It turns out that designing starship lasers is actually not too rough.
My design procedure is different than FFS, because I streamlined it
substantially to design for volume, range, and best possible energy.
After I got the method worked out with the big bay, the 50-ton bay 
only took ten minutes.

Here\'s how I did these weapons:

1.  Decide the size of the installation.
2.  Decide the effective range desired -- in this case, 2400 Mm,
    or 80 hexes.  (1 Mm == 1000 km.  I like expressing the final
    values in megameters, because it\'s more readable without the
    extra three zeros.  I do almost all calculations in the normal 
    units, however, so I don\'t screw up.) 
3.  Go through the range calculation in reverse to find the lens 
    radius and focal area.  Does the lens fit?   
4.  Pick an appropriate beam pointer from the chart.
5.  Crew is easy -- it\'s always one.
6.  Finding the ideal discharge energy for the laser, so that the 
    best lens and HPG can be installed, is readily computed by using
    algebra to mess with some terms.  The best DE in megajoules equals:
	
         Total Bay Volume - (Workstation Vol. + Beam Pointer Vol.)
     ----
     (FA Mult * FA ROF Vol Mod * Focal Area) + (5 * (HPG Vol per MJ))
	   
    Volumes in kL (cubic meters).  Area in square meters. 

    This equation works for all tech levels, given appropriate numbers. 
    I verified it against the standard turret laser at TL15.
7.  Given the discharge energy, finding the lens and HPG volume is 
    strightforward.  Find all values for workstation, beam pointer, 
    lens, and using one-shot *input* energy, the HPG, and the starship 
    laser is easy to finish.

I occasionally do a conversion from the old rules to TNE.  I tend to
use laser barbettes to replace plasma and fusion turrets, and laser
bays for high-energy weapon bays, for the sake of atmosphere.  It
also gives the conversions some punch.

Everybody can find parts for a two-year-old Ling Standard Products air 
raft (just go to the dealership), but where do you go for a compensating 
magnetostrictor for your classic Funilawari Dyno-speeder, out of 
production for over a century?  Well, you do just what collectors have 
been doing since the Rule of Man - go to a swap meet!

The planet Carlisle is centrally located, and supports a thriving salvage
industry.  It hosts an regular (once every five years) swap meet for
vehicle collectors, and thousands of vendors travel to the planet to set
up temporary booths, where they sell and trade parts and complete
vehicles.  Parts for almost any vehicle are avalible, either used or like
new. 

CLASSIC TRAVELLER

A Noble patron hires the players to provide transportation (if they 
have a starship) or security (if they do not) for his shipment of classic 
air-rafts to Carlisle.

1) All is as it seems - use this as a chance to pull out all those 
vehicle designs that have been hanging around.

2) All is as it seems, but unknown to the patron one of his air-rafts is 
stolen goods - conflict ensues when the original owner sees it at the 
swap meet.

3) The "Noble" is actually a smuggler (of what is up to the referee), and 
the air-rafts have the smuggled item(s) hidden inside them.

4) As 1, but the players discover one of the air-rafts has a sentient 
TL-16 robot brain installed.  The brain pleads with the players to free 
it from servitude, but the air-raft is very rare and expensive, and will 
lose most of its value if the brain is removed.

MEGATRAVELLER

1) The players are from the Wilds, looking for parts to repair an 
essential transport system on a Failing world.  A collector recognises 
the player\'s ship\'s vehicle as a rare model, and offers to buy it.

2) As 5, but the collector tries to steal the vehicle.

NEW ERA

1) Carlisle is now a boneyard.  The players are sent to explore, and find 
a version of Virus that is a collector of old vehicles.  It controls an 
army of vehicles and robots constructed out of scrap parts.  The Virus is 
potentially friendly, and will be happy to trade with the players.  It 
wants rare vehicles and trade literature, and will send the players on 
quests for what it wants (it knows where all the vehicle museums in this 
sector were). 


Note: This seed was inspired by my upcoming visit to an auto swap meet in 
Carlisle, PA.  Hope you like it!

Notes

The large cargo space can accomodate a large variety of payloads.  Power
couplings are available, and the area receives full life support.  See
beclow for details of various cargo palettes.  The cargo hatches at the rear
of the ship fold open to allow roll on-roll off (RO-RO) operations, making
vehicle disembarkation a simple procedure ( The entire bottom rear of the
ship opens up).

The "Paschendale" Class Transport has it\'s origins in the mists of
antiquity. The original design was produced by the Terran Confederation from
AD 2110 (-2411 Imperial).  The "Paschendale" was the first of a series of
transport starships designed and built by the Starbus-Lockheed Consortium
for the Terran Confederation Navy and commercial interests.  A relict
"Paschendale" (the "Meekatharra") was discovered in an underground storage
facility in 1179 by Medoci archeologists.  The facility is believed to part
of the orignal naval base established by the Terran Confederation during the
Interstellar Wars.  The "Meekatharra", although lacking jump drives, served
as the pattern craft for the "Paschendale".

The class has been built in considerable numbers in the Commonwealth.  It\'s
drop tanks allow two jumps totalling three parsecs between refuelling stops,
giving the transport enough \'legs\' to venture outside the Commonwealth,
making it a viable Free Trader in this part of the Solomani Rim.

Volume marked as "Cargo" is available for customization of the bay.

If you follow the design sequence in FFS for PAWS bay weapons, they 
seem fairly pointless; they\'re incredibly weak.  However, I recently
tumbled to something interesting that I understand John Bogan figured
out a while back.  The PAWS bay-length systems are small enough that
you could theoretically fit several into the same bay!  The theory
is that several PAWS barrels could get linked into one weapon with
just one beam pointer, and combine their delivered energy but keep
their range performance.  If you allow this, then to find out DV:
  DV == 5 * SQRT(Barrel DE * Number of PAWS barrels).
FFS doesn\'t explicitly say that this technique is okay to use, but
it\'s reasonable and doesn\'t seem to break anything.

This isn\'t very competitive with lasers yet.  But if you also reduce
PAWS lens diameter to reduce effective range to 30000 km, then you
end up with something interesting; a very short-range weapon with
a higher DV than the comparable laser bay, but which drops off in
power very fast.

So what are they good for?  PAWS weapons have lousy penetration in
comparison to lasers, so against a well-armored foe, the short-range
power advantage is reduced.  Depends on the rule system.  In Battle
Rider, these weapons are still dangerous to escort vessels, but in
Brilliant Lances, these are useful in another way.

The Brilliant Lances rules state that any hit by a PAWS on any part
of a ship causes *all* non-fiber optic computers to undergo a System
Reset.  This is a bit misleading.  According to the rules, if the 
computer resets, and no backup computers are available, *every system
on the ship* resets.  In other words, for the next turn the ship will
have "no functioning maneuver drive, and no weapons which can fire".

You may recognize that last phrase.  It\'s the conditions in BL under
which a ship is disabled, and vulnerable to a boarding action.

Now, of course, the boarding ship also needs to have matched vectors,
but it probably won\'t be too hard to do that *and* hit the ship with
the PAWS again, causing another ship-wide System Reset, giving the
boarders enough time to board.

I think that this is going to be the weapon of choice for commerce 
raiders.  The weapon has the potential to disable most civilian 
ships, with less risk of turning the target into a hulk to do it.  
It might be possible to take the target as a prize ship and make
a getaway with it, using its\' own drives, once the prize crew has
taken control!  Military ships need to have fiber optic computers
to avoid this danger.

Meson gun design is similar to PAWS design.  For a PAWS, range depends on
both length and diameter, and power depends on length.  For a meson gun,
range depends on length, and power depends on cross-section ("diameter", 
in a sense).  A bay-mounted meson gun tends to have poor range; neither 
one of these bays has an effective range of even a hex, even with 
tech-level bonuses.

Worse, I think that any of the meson screen equipped ships in Battle Rider
could stop a hit from one of these bays, even on a failed screen attempt
and an Outstanding Success on the attack roll.  However, unscreened ships
are in more trouble, since sandcasters and armor protection can\'t be used 
to stop meson gun attacks, as they can for PAWS and laser attacks.

In order to speed up design for these, I made a formula similar to the
one I used in laser design to get a rough estimate of what the DE could
be.  I then fine-tuned the design from there.  Coming up with an exact
formula to design a meson gun isn\'t as easy as it is for starship laser
design, because the crew requirement changes in 7 kL chunks, but you can
get a figure that is close.

A single-shot disposable rocket launcher.  The launcher doubles as the
carrying container for the 10cm HEAP rocket, the two components cannot be
used seperately.  The DRS (Disposable Rocket System) 10 is simple to
manufacture and simple to use, yet packs a considerable punch against
armoured vehicles and buildings.  Note that the effective short range will
be greatly affected by terrain.

A number of these rockets have found their way into the hands of terrorist
groups fighting the administration on Saxe.  How the Solomani guerillas
obtained the launchers is presently unknown, but they have used them to
deadly effect against army and Interior Ministry militia units.

With the late 20th century increase in tourism to the Holy Land, esp. 
Jerusalem, there has been a marked increase in a form of mental illness 
called the "Jerusalem Complex."  Perfectly normal folks, average 
tourists, become convinced that they are a biblical figure (Christ, the 
Virgin Mary, etc.) as a result of the time they spend at holy sites.  
There is a mental hospital now outside the city that specialises in the 
treatment of the syndrome.

Here are some things to keep in mind about this syndrome.  First, those
who are victums normally are not those who are well-integrated in their
faith, but are folks who have doubts or who have sinned in the past and
seek redemption.  Second, they will be fully convinced that they are the
holy person, and will be very uncomfortable with any questions that refer 
to their real past.  Note, however, that this does not mean they will 
immediatly act like the historical figure they believe they are - a 
person convinced they are Christ might be very hesitant to speak out for 
fear of crucifiction, for example.  Finally, most individuals recover 
faster if they are removed from Jerusalem - the city itself seems to have 
an influence.

CLASSIC TRAVELLER

1) The players are hired to find a young man gone missing from his 
wealthy family.  He is on the planet where his religion originated, 
convinced that he is the returned saviour.  Since he has given away his 
money and destroyed his clothing and ID, he\'ll be difficult to find.

2) As 1, but the young man has attracted followers who will be unwilling 
to let him leave.

3) As 1, but the "followers" are criminals who are just pretending to be 
believers.  They plan to blackmail the young man\'s family.

MEGATRAVELLER

1) On a visit to a Failing world, one of the players (whose religion 
originated on this world), decides he/she is the messiah and must help 
these people.  It is suggested that the GM arrange this beforehand with 
the player involved, preferably selecting a character who has some moral 
failings in his/her past.

THE NEW ERA

1) A victum of the syndrome is the TED on a planet.  The TED arrived some 
years ago on his spaceship, and has used high tech equipment to perform 
his miracles.   The inhabitants believe in him, for the most part, and 
follow him.

Hello,

Is this database available somewhere?  I looked on your web page but did not 
see it.

Any info most appreciated.  Thanks!

 appalled by the possibility that much of the primary source
 material for the history of the 20th century is in danger of
 vanishing (imagine studying the Vietman War based on a few
 movies, a Reader\'s Digest condensed version of Westmorland\'s
 memoirs, fragments of a World Book Encyclopedia entry, and
 whatever physical remains can be excavated 1800 years from now).
 1) The acid content of the paper used in the publication of
 almost all books and magazines from the civil war until almost
 the present means that the primary source documents for history
 are gradually becoming unreadable. GDW has several bound sets of
 late 19th century magazines (Harpers Weekly, et al., acquired for
 $.25 each at a garage sale for Space: 1889 research) which
 require careful handling if the pages are not to crumble to dust.
 I have seen books from the U of I library that were in worse
 shape. On the other hand, I have an 1840 translation of Josephus
 that has pages as supple as the day it was printed. There is not
 enough money for libraries to mircofilm everything immediately,
 and a certain number of documents are literally falling apart
 every year, some of them irreplaceable.
 
 2. The emulsion used for most movie film until the 1970s means
 that a gigantic amount of the newsreel footage of the 20th
 century is in danger of crumbling to flakes. Again, money for
 preservation is the problem. Preservation efforts have been
 concentrated on saving Hollywood movies, but the vital stuff of
 history is not _Gone With the Wind_, it is the Movietone News. A
 similar problem is encountered with microfilm and microfiche
 (also, a few years ago, the Library of Congress discovered
 that a fungus with an afinity for celluloid had eaten some
 of its microfilm collection...I don\'t know if this problem
 was ever solved).
 
 3. The Library of Congress and the Census Bureau have data on
 magnetic media that they can no longer access because the
 computer equipment to read it is no longer manufactured. As a
 note of possible relevance to Traveller fans, most of the Classic
 Traveller books were typeset on an IBM Electronic Selectric
 Typesetter, and recorded on mag cards, which we no longer have
 the equipment to read. Some of the Classic products and most of
 the MegaTraveller products were typeset on an MCS typesetting
 system, and are recorded on 5-1/4" disks which can be read to a
 PC using a special translation disk and a _lot_ of time.
 
 My field of study was ancient Rome. When I thnk of the
 inestimable historical value that is represented by just _one_
 intact Roman census, and the mountains of contemporary data that
 are in danger of vanishing, it makes me wonder if historians of
 the future will be bewailing the lack of sources for the period
 AD 1850-2000.
 
 Sorry for going on for so long, but I think of this subject
 whenever I read a SF story that makes reference to "the ancient
 20th Century." Maybe all the problems have already been solved,
 maybe they soon will be...

   I have personally produced a list of known star locations 
in the Solomani Rim which is available via WWW at:

   That list contains all the stars within 7 parsecs, plus all 
the stars down to A main sequence types for 50 light years 
(that are within the Solomani Rim, that is). Other select stars 
are also included--total for the list is around 77 systems and 
well over 120 individual stars.

my collections of Piper, Niven, Anderson, Cherryh, Heinlein, Norton,

In my glutted sated stupor I have thought of the TML and hereby 
offer to help anyone else looking for rare science fiction. 
This is the lifetime collection of a true fan. Nearly everything
is in mint condition. It appears to include complete collections
from several authors. It spans $0.40 Ace books from the early 60\'s
to recent 90\'s titles. I have yet to see another eight boxes of it.

Anyway, if anyone is seeking specific titles, email me with 
author, title, and price. I will check the collection again in a
week (when I have more cash.) The owner has been much more than 
fair on price so far.



TTFN,

Glenn, deliriously happy....a quest is at an end!

BTW, Whatever happened to SFLovers? I haven\'t heard from it in 
months.

What you need is the K\'kree alien module. This is an (apparently rare) CT

Yes their computer systems probably would have been different but that makes 
little difference to GDW\'s Virus.

The K\'kree generally only settled worlds they could live on without lots of 
technological assistance. They were however heavily dependant on robots and 
computer systems to run their spaceships etc. The combination of these 
factors is that a greater proportion of the K\'kree race survived the Virus 
but are living at low tech levels.

This sort of topic has been covered before and has sparked major flame wars
over the authenticity, realism, etc. of the Virus concept, but to summarise
briefly:
(1) the Virus spread initially through transponders
(2) the official line is that everyone, everywhere, had to have these
transponders on their ships
(3) therefore everyone has the Virus (QED).
Not quite logical, but assuming everyone uses similar BASE computing
technology e.g. reprogrammable silicon-(or other)-based chips, then all such
computers would have been infected.
The K\'kree\'s relative isolation might have helped reduce the spread, but
some effects would have been far worse.

For example, K\'kree ships are a minimum of about 1000 tons displacement
because the K\'kree hate confinement, so the ship interior is a mock plains
landscape (grass et al.). Everything (yes _everything_) gets recycled via
clever microbiological systems. However, I got the impression most of the
ship would have to be cleverly controlled by a computer. A Virus\'d CPU could
lose the oxygen, reduce to zero temp, etc. - things which humans might be
able to survive if they could get into a vacc suit with a long enough air
supply. K\'kree, assuming they clamber into their cumbersome vacc suit in
time, would probably die of mental anguish due to their claustrophobia-like
effects after only a few hours.

> So with that in mind, am I the only one who thinks that they would have 
>survived the Virus alot better off then most?

Perhaps.

> Was just wondering. because the idea of a K\'kree scout with a small 
>amount of backup going exploring/land claiming(depending on how they are)

As noted on ship sizes above, replace the word \'small\' with \'large\'. They
might certainly come and strike some retribution on the burger-eating worlds
of the humans (since K\'kree are solely vegetarian and view meat-eating as,
at best, cannibalism and, at worst, genocide).

Hope this helps.

Incidentally, teleport.com isn\'t anything to do with the Teleport computer
peripherals/supplies/sales/etc. company is it?

Traveller publications that the occurance of stars have
already been worked out for a considerable number of
sectors around the Imperium. All those high-resolution

    Is this data kicking around GDW in any form that

I\'m a bit more relaxed about the ongoing deterioration of records and 
film.  The problem that I\'ve experienced is not a shortage of records, 
but a positive oversupply.  Modern court records, in particular, are 
stuffed full of paper with almost no historical value.  

Archivists are finding that the biggest question they face these days is
what to throw away so as to preserve space for future aquisitions.  I\'ve
recently been hired to work on a research project that will look at
business history records to aid archvists in doing this triage - it\'s a 
very real problem, this excess of paper.

In some ways, the deterioration of so much paper is a blessing in 
disguise - every piece of paper that rots away is a paper that you don\'t 
have to read when you\'re doing your research.  

By the way, there are a number of companies that are working on this 
problem.  In the case of paper, it\'s already possible to extract the 
residual acid and prolong the life of the paper indefinitely - it\'s just 
expensive and time consuming.  There have been some experiments with bulk 
treatments that seem promising, but it\'s going to be some years before 
these techniques are widely available.

Of course, this has some applications for roleplaying - making the 
players look for that one copy of the data they need that\'s printed on 
high-acid wartime paper (journals and books printed in Germany between 
1940 and 1945 are rotting at a much higher rate than peacetime material) 
can be lots of fun.  One thing Loren didn\'t mention about early film 
stock is that, if it isn\'t stored in a climate controlled environment, it 
deteriorates and becomes explosive!  Many of these early films are now 
stored in ammunition bunkers for just that reason.  Now that\'s what I 
call risky research!

Ah, what that subject actually means is that I was wondering
what kind of computers all you TML/XBOATers run on.

More specifically, if I was to make some semi-useful piece of
software (or, even better, if someone else was to make something
similar) what platform would you like to see it on?

Like,

 - Unix/X - could use Tcl/Tk and some free db package...
 - Windows - I have an ooold copy of Visual Basic
 - Excel - Excel 5 has a lot of programming support
           and is available for mac and pc
           (apologies to that Lotus employee I\'ve seen abouts)

 - etc, etc

Now, I\'m not promising to actually make anything, but I think it
might be useful to know what kind of software would get used the 
most (ignoring things like whether or not it sucks).

"mutual defense union which grew into a trade and commerce union as

Long Night" (Alien Module 6) that the time was right for a return.

The Easter Concord declared its independence from the Imperium in 1127

listed as AAE7977 Hi Fl in the Solomani book that spells death in TNE 
terms.  What the Hell is an "E" atmosphere anyway?  Just really exotic?  

A couple more questions:

Did the Solomani retake Easter during the Final War?  If so, when and for 
how long?

What about those Vegans?  Are they allies of the K\'Kree?  (just kidding)

What are some sources I should consult about the area?

Hi all,

I was looking at some old, ooold stuff sitting around in one of my
directories and there was a bundle of gdw-beta messages, one of them a
survey of what rule-sets/campaign backgrounds people used. A lot
of people are/were still playing a CT background, eve if they were
using TNE rules.

So, I thought, why not a Classic Traveller sourcebook for TNE?
Sure, it\'s a cash grab, as it would essentially be an even bigger
rehash of already-printed materials that MT was, but hey, it\'s
getting tougher and tougher to get CT materials for campaign
backgrounds. And if some new material was put into it, it might even
sell to people who already have all that CT stuff.

So, Loren, what\'s your opinion? (Other opinions welcome too, of course).

Ethan
PS. As for that computer thing, I\'ve only gotten 2 responses so far,
but 3 different platforms! Aie carumba.

would like to see one.
 Suere, it may seem like a cash crab, but.
#1 It would be a fun alternatitive to tne but with a better rule system 
and easier to find that ct
#2 It would provide valuable background on worlds and the like. ease the 
ref\'s task signifigentley.
#3 It would be helpful when planning recovery(smash&grab) missions for 
the players. using a \'stanard\' imperal chart of the area they could spot 
high tech areas and search them out. Again, a aid to the ref.
#4 Even with some of the major planets labeld, it would still leave alot 
of leeway. And if the ref does not like a sub-sector or whatnot. They could 
always choose to ignor part or the entire book.
 It coulden\'t hurt. and GDW probabley would make a profit offa it. seeing 
as how alot of the stuff just needs to be compiled and updated.

When a character is injured, they have to roll a Willpower task to avoid
losing their next action.  (Except the first wound, which automatically
causes a missed action.)  The task is Easy for scratch wounds, Average for
slight wounds, and Difficult for serious wounds.  

This means that really dumb characters with low willpower can be distracted
by pinpricks and never fight back effectively.  It also means that in a
fistfight the fighter to land the first punch can keep his opponent off
balance.

Hello,

I was wondering if GDW is going to release some material on the pocket 
empires leading from the RC to the Hiver Federation. Using Pre-Collapse
Sector information, I\'ve tentatively mapped the three empires, the one
in subsector P of the Old Expanses, and those mainly in subsectors N
and C of sectors Hinterworlds and Spica respectively. I\'d expect the 
RC to have some relations with the empire in subsec P of the Old Exp-
anses, and Knowledge of the other 2 through it, that is if the Hivers 
haven\'t told them already. Also, as those three empires are closer
to Hiver space, they may have recovered more than the RC, having 
Hiver help for a longer time.
Sector P, to the best of my knowledge was in Solomani hands at the 
Time of the collapse, but whether differing Solomani computers and
transponders (if they were different) would alleviate Collapse effects
I don\'t know. The subsec has 28 systems, of which 20 are probably dead.
The pocket empire, from the TNE known space map, has 12 systems, of 
which 7 are probably dead, unless they survive through tenacity, like
the Balduri did. There is an Aubaine-type world, Syrim, at hex 2835,
previously pop A, TL E, quite habitable, and with a Naval Base, all
prior to the collapse. This world is probably the capital of the empire.
Of the other systems, at 2934 is Maurcam, starport B, pop 7, TL B prior
to the collapse, and Stad starport A, pop A, TL D and Naval Base prior
to the collapse, though Stad is inhospitable, and probably doesn\'t
survive into the New Era. Syrim had a Type A starport pre-NE. The other
surviving worlds (3 I think) are low tech.
The Sector N Hinterworlds empire is also nominally in Solomani hands
at the time of the collapse, I think. There are 21 worlds in it, some
in subsector O, 14 of there are probably dead. There seems no main
contender for main system of the empire, and most of the cemetary 
worlds seem to be the Hi-Tech, A-B spaceport worlds. 
At 1632 is Gamvina, previously B starport, TL 9, pop 6, which may have
survived with low pop, there are other similar worlds, but they may also
have survived with low populations. The main Capital worlds of the empire
may be Elan at 1335, starport B, pop 8, TL A, and/or Spire at 1836, 
Starport A, pop 8, TL 9, both needing a Balduri-type miracle to survive.
The Empire mainly in subsector C of Spica sector was also nominaly 
Solomani, but on the Hiver border at the time of the collapse. 
The empire contains about 19 systems, most unnamed on my data, of which
9 probably see the New Era. 
There is a strong candidate for capital, Nugent at 2010, starport A, pop 9
 TL E, prior to the collapse, but as it has a low atmospheric pressure,
needs divine intervention to survive. A waterworld at 2306, with port A,
pop 8 and TL A is also a strong capital possibility, and has a better
chance of surviving than Nugent. 

Well, that\'s all I\'ve garnered on the Hiver-ward Pocket Empires, and I have 
to point out that it is in no way gospel. Hopefully if GDW have the time
We\'ll be able to see the real state of affairs in those empires.
 
Yours,
Eamon Watters, QUB.

My roleplaying group are interested in knowing exactly what is the

This would help us to understand what can and can\'t be determined about
other starships in encounters.  Why aren\'t starships fitted with telescopes
that have advanced image enhancement so once an object is located an 
attempt can be made to view it?

Brillant Lances has a very brief mention of \'cold running\' where the
starship is powered down to 1% of normal power levels.  Could someone
give a better description of this please?  If detection is to avoided
this seems to be good way to do it. 

In Fire, fusion and steel does the target size table refer to displacement
tons?  I assume it does.

    'body' => 'Hi All,

I have a question on initial starship aquisition when a character is being
made.
I don\'t have my books in front of me, so the exact wording won\'t be right
but:

When a group of characters are first created they can pool together their
ship DMs.  They then roll on the [first of the two tables] table and see how
many minus DMs they get to allot to their ship - assuming they don\'t end up
with High or Middle Passages.  For example lets assume they end up with -16
DMs
to allot (the worst case).

They must then work these DMs off as either modifiers to the Ships Type table
roll (table two on the page), or modifiers on the wear of the ship (up to
-10) or modifiers on the amount of money outstanding on the mortgage (up to
-8).

The problem lies in the Ship Types table.  If they are taking a Scout ship,
what
is to stop them using up all 16 negative DMs on this table.  They are bound
to end up with a Scout ship anyway, and this way have no DMs to work off as
wear
or as outstanding repayments - they get a brand new, completely paid up scout
ship!

Possible solutions I have thought of:

1) The players must state how many DMs they wish to use on this table before
they roll the dice.  Then, if the total score rolled on the Ship Types table
is
less than -2 they get no ship at all.  So the most negatives they can risk
sensibly are -4.

2) They first roll the dice and then state how many minuses they wish to work
off (to a maximum adjusted roll of -2).  I like this solution the least as it
is very contrived.

How do the rest of you deal with this problem (or am I missing some rule
which
neatly explains it all) ?

Pete.

I\'d buy it.  But I lost most of my CT and all of my MT stuff to

The great thing about standards is that there are so many to choose
from.

There are TWO of us.  And no offense, As long as you go down
to your favorite SW shop and purchase Release 5 of 123.  8^)

I\'d like to see just about anything.  But as yet only have email,
so it doesn\'t help to just hang it somewhere and say "ok, it\'s
ready, you can find it at..."  The solution for people in my
boat is some wonderful shareware called uuencode/uudecode.

I like the second part (keeping the opponent off-balance).  

But I don\'t like the first part at all.  I\'ve seen some pretty dumb
characters in my life, with no willpower whatsoever, and they were
*never* distracted by little pinpricks, etc.  

I would suggest making it a category easier for scratch and slight
wounds...  Leave it difficult for serious wounds.  And modify it 
so that even someone who *fails* the roll can still use the action 
to *retreat.*

This seems to have been sorted out now - I\'ve even been promised a free
copy of _Death of Wisdom_, although it hasn\'t arrived yet.

I don\'t know what it is about my name, but mag subscription databases seem
to suffer a complete collapse whenever they see it. It\'s happened at least
3 times over thee last couple of years, and nobody can explain what
happened.

They don\'t make things like they used to - on this weeks BBC \'Antiques

no longer have a machine that can read them.

BZZZZT!  Sorry, wrong.  Most of the blueprints and data for Saturn V and
other Apollo hardware (which were hardcopy, not computer files, by the
way) were destroyed, officially as part of cost-saving measure, actually
to make it impossible to go back on the decision to build the Space
Shuttle.  Speaking as a former NASA historian, you would be surprised at
how little documentation exists, and how hard it is to get at the stuff
that does exist.

On the other hand, there are gobs of reel to reel tapes of data from NASA
science missions (including Apollo) sitting around in climate-controlled
storage, with no money to read and decode it and no prospect of it ever
being read.  Rather sad, really.

    'body' => 'Some time ago I promised a review/comments on the Aliens of the Rim
supplement.  Although a bit disorganized, here are my opinions.

After the usual intro stuff, there is a one-page report from the \'Special
Intelligence Branch\', which lays out several interesting (and mutually
contradictory) conspiracy theories.  This rather nicely introduces the
problem with Hiver manipulation: like talking to a social psychologist, you
can never be certain if the Hiver is telling you the truth or experimenting
on you.  

The next four pages detail Hiver physiology.  Mainly a repeat of the original
CT module.  Interesting and non-controversial.

The next 13 pages detail Hiver origins, history, and society.  There are
three threads: the \'official\' Hiver viewpoint, a sarcastic Ithklur dissenter,
and a few SIB glosses.  Most of the time the threads agree on what happened,
while having very different interpretations on reasons and significance. 
Imagine reading a history textbook annotated by a rival professor.  

Someone complained earlier about the story in the section of K\'kree eating
Ithklur, saying that the K\'kree are herbivores and wouldn\'t do that.  I
consulted a biologist, and herbivores do willingly eat meat!  For example,
deer kept in crowded pens will eat each other even when fodder is available. 
Apparently stress does really wierd things to their minds, and as herbivores
tend not to have surrender reflexes...  In fact, the biologist speculated
that carnivorism might be more widespread than the K\'kree admit, although it
is probably viewed as an intolerable perversion: something like cannibalism
among modern humans.

The next three pages talk more about Hiver psychology.  

The next nine pages give players details on being a Hiver: attributes,
careers, skills, etc.

The next three pages provide referees details, including some alien
motivations and more template NPCs.  

The next five pages are about Hiver Dreamers.  These NPCs are rather like
prophets, and can make good plot devices.

The Hiver section concludes with two pages of advice on using Hivers,
including yet more reminders that history is fiction, not fact (something
frequently ignored by non-historians).

After a one-page SIB preface on the Ithklurs, there are two pages on
physiology, one page on history, and 14 pages on Ithklur philosophy.  The
philosophy section is well-done (I think I recognized elements of eastern
religions blended with early Christian heresies and neo-Platoism as well as
other material I can\'t recognize, which may be original).  It certainly
provides a sound basis for playing an Ithklur character.

This section is also where we learn that the Ithklur like ancient American
jokes and trivia.  Seeing as I can\'t understand why some of the jokes are
funny, I can see how this would confuse post-Imperial humans.  (Why _is_
"Jane, you ignorant slut" a joke?)  In my game I\'ll probably translate this
section from "ancient Terran cultural references" to "ancient Imperial
cultural references" because I don\'t see the Ithklur picking this period in
history.  On the other hand, I may well use this material as examples of the
_kind_ of trivia that Ithklur like, because my players can relate to it
(especially those that watch American TV and movies).

The players\' section is 14 pages long, mainly careers and character stuff. 
This is where the philosphy section is put into practice: an Ithklur\'s
philosphy of life governs his career path.

The referee\'s section is only two pages, mostly alien motivations and
template NPCs.

There\'s an eight page appendix covering things like modified design
sequences, modified rules, new equipment, and so on.

Finally, there\'s a four page glossary (local colour) and two character
generation worksheets.

they are, but... you try to detect the other starship at extreme range, and
when 
at those limits you cannot resolve further detail.  Of course, as it gets
closer 
you can get decent images.

>what is the 
>information being collected by the EMS sensors, and other sensor types.

anything that stands out from the background of stars:

light - as IR from hot drive exhausts,
	as radio from electrics
	as visible light reflected, or more likely by occulting background stars
neutrinos etc from fusion reactors
(in MT, gravitic radiation)

an electronic camera and photomultiplier can automatically scan for stars
being 
occulted, which is hard to avoid even if you switch off drives and other 
sources... from the pattern of occultations and your own motion, you can work

out where the opponent ought to be and how they seem to be moving, but if all

you have is a set of shadows in front of stars, its pretty hard to build up
an 
image of the offender!
To really hide a starship, you need to set a course similar to in-system 
asteroids, set the ship slowly tumbling and stop accelerating; otherwise
you\'ll 
stand out from the other lumps even with the drives off.

1/ Having wrapped my brain around FF&S for a few weeks now, I\'m going to
take a break and get around to something I\'ve been meaning to do for a while
- collapse subsectors N and O (Capella and Gemini) of the Solomani Rim.  One
question - should I apply the Hard Times effects before I calculate the
Collapse effects?  I\'m fairly certain that I should, it\'s just that I\'ll
have to go out and buy \'Hard Times\'.

2/ Subscribers in Western Australia (or anywhere else for that matter).
There\'s a great games store here that has a pretty good stock of old and
second hand Traveller materi=E8l (CT and MT mainly).  I\'m in the process of
getting a complete list, which I\'ll post here.  If anyone want\'s anything,
I\'ll grab it and send it to them for cost plus postage.  For the Sandgropers
out there, the place is called Valhalla Games and Hobbies, and it\'s on
Wellington Street, opposite the Perth train station.

3/ Unfortunately, the same store is waaay behind on new TNE stuff (bugger).
In fact, there\'s nowhere in Perth that has more than a smallish proportion
of the published TNE material...I know that it\'s the world\'s most isolated
city and all, but pleeease GDW, help us!

Right...glad I\'ve got that off my chest!

I\'m curious to hear how people have used the K\'kree in campaigns. I find them

incredibly interesting, but they seem difficult to work into larger  
interstellar society. Can\'t exactly invite them over for a cookout. Adventure

ideas, descriptions of encounters, etc. would all be interesting.

Has anyone else considered modifications to K\'kree society? My first impulse
is  
to give their females a larger role. I see no need for them to remain only  
babymakers. I\'m thinking of a structure in which either male or female noble

K\'kree can be family heads. Not sure about the details yet. Also, they seem  
awfully stagnant to have survived so long; one could either emphasize their  
resistance to change, and try to decide what societal mechanisms they might  
have to support it, or else add elements of change to their society.

I recently recovered my stash of CT products from my younger brother, to whom
I  
foolishly loaned them years ago, and have been poring over the first three  
alien modues (Vargr, Aslan, and K\'kree). My interest in Traveller is more in

the universe than the rules.

I hesitated before writing to the TML since I don\'t have access to any New
Era  
rules, but here\'s where the K\'kree discussion has been going on.

Someone mentioned K\'kree reliance on robots; is this mentioned in any post-CT

products? I don\'t see it in any of my CT material. It certainly stands to  
reason; it\'s just that robots seemed mostly absent from CT.

Requirements to read the Hyperzine:
A HTML browser like Mosaic, Netscape, Cello or something like that.


Submittion guideleines:
1) All text should be in one of these formats:
     ASCII
     HTML


2) If you submitt HTML documents, you should note the following:
a) All links out should go to local directory.
b) Prepare anchorpoints to all subheadings
c) on headings should be alphabetical and consist of two letters like this: 
AA, BB, CC etc.
d) All anchors should be in capital letters for ease of finding.
e) You may have links out to previously published material.
f) All subheadings should be indexed at the beginning of the document.

And I\'ve never seen anything civilian under five or six thousand 
displacement tons.  The trouble is, a whole herd has to go along, and
that includes wives, servants, aides, above and beyond the normal 
working crew.  Military ships can be a bit smaller than civilian ones,
since they carry only a K\'kree military herd, in which everyone has
a shipboard job.  The standard K\'kree military "Frigate" from the
module was a five thousand ton ship, even so.  K\'kree just need too
much extra room, between their increased body mass and claustrophobia.
Military crews can be hand-picked and trained to work in enclosed 
spaces, but it\'s hard for them.  It means that when the K\'kree go 
anywhere, they tend to go in force.

Yeah.  K\'kree interstellar travel is rough.  There\'s two partial solutions.
First, I figure that there must be some sort of emergency "blast door"
system that slams out of the floor if the ship gets holed -- the K\'kree
aren\'t dumb, and they do build warships.  Also, they will use transparent
partitions if they absolutely have to enclose a space, so a truly large
K\'kree craft (and there are few that aren\'t) could be composed of several
cells.  Did I mention that K\'kree *hate* starship travel, even in their
own ships?

I think they\'re fun ships to build, though.  I\'ve been working on and
off on another K\'kree ship design for TNE that may eventually see the
light of day, depending on how it goes.

I think the K\'kree will survive the Virus fairly well, since they only
settle "blue-sky" worlds, and should have lower than average tech levels.
It would be interesting to generate a sector with the K\'kree world gen
rules, and then Collapse it and see what happens.  And as much as the
K\'kree hate star travel, they\'d be driven to it to reunite the herds. 
That leaves the ten teracredit question, "What is the Black Curtain
anyway, and does it stretch all the way to K\'kree space?"

Incidentally, one thing that was nice about the extensions to world
generation in the K\'kree worlds was a roll to determine if a system
had "native" sentient life.  In K\'kree space, it came out to one in
thirty-six systems, almost three percent.  I figure that this is 
after they\'ve killed the local carnivores, so let\'s say that the
number should be roughly doubled in the Imperium, to one in twenty, 
another easy-to-roll probability.  If the Domain of Deneb region has
1277 systems, and according to DGP in MTJ #1, 48 native alien races,
this comes out quite close.  The fact that it\'s a bit low could have
something to do with the fact that the Marches are suspected to be
the Ancients\' old, er, stomping grounds, in a literal sense.

Check out page 315 of the TNE rule book.  Passive EMS includes "computer
image enhancement" of the object, and while they don\'t say so very
clearly, I believe that optical wavelengths are included.  When you
consider that even the little 30 Mm PEMS on the Far Trader has a 3.5 
meter effective lens diameter (see FF&S), these sensors have incredible
resolving power, like a spy satellite.  If the ship is close enough,
and your PEMS effective lens array big enough, you might be able to read 
the name of the closing ship off the hull!  Of course, jitter will be
a problem, but that\'s what computers are for. 

As for the "other" listings, gravitic densitometers can be used to map
geological variations in density, neutrino sensors are useful in the
study of stars, and neural activity sensors can detect sentient life
forms, but only at short ranges.

I\'m afraid my reading of the TML has been a tad spotty recently, but
considering the amount of Hiver-Ithklur discussion I\'m surprised that I
haven\'t seen anybody mention the God-awful Santa Claus -- and I use the term
loosely -- \'joke\' involving the founder of the Ithklur philosophy.  Did
nobody else notice, or have I just missed the other references?

Concering the K\'Kree eating fallen Ithklur during the K\'Kree/Hiver war:
Someone mentioned that even here on Earth herbivors <sp?> will eat meat
under certain, unrare, conditions.  Using this as a "justification" of the
K\'Kree\'s activity has, to me, two difficulties:

1/ As I recall (and I could be wrong, not having the module with me at
work), the K\'Kree started to eat Ithklur when the Ithklur began eating
K\'Kree, sort of as a "retaliation".  For my conception of the K\'Kree, this
would be a wholly unthinkable motivation, mostly because historically this
sort of Barbarism was met with a wholesale genocide of the offending party
by the K\'Kree.

2/ Unless I\'ve missed an episode of Nova, most Earth herbivors *aren\'t*
sentient, star-faring species with stable, complex cultures spanning
hundreds of light-years and the social and technological evolution that
implies.  I can imagine *some* modern K\'Kree turning to meat to sustain
themselves under extreme crisis conditions, like those faced by the Donner
party.  However, while this might work for an isolated individual forced to
keep himself alive, it doesn\'t seem "logical" for an intact K\'Kree family or
military unit.  There would be too much peer reinforcement to keep them from
actually "doing the deed" alone.

It seems to me that the most likely situation was that a) Rations were
almost completely gone, b) all local flora was utterly indegestable by
K\'Kree, and c) the troop\'s Leader felt that the only hope for winning the
war was to keep his unit(s) alive.  Under those situations I can see a
K\'Kree leader ordering his troops to eat meat to keep them alive.  I can\'t
see very many K\'Kree leaders doing this, however.  I also don\'t see very
many K\'Kree soldiers going along with the order unless they, too, saw the
"necessity" of surviving and there were absolutely no alternatives.  That
is, they must have considered their continued survival to be an issue of
Galaxy-shattering importance.  They would have felt that the future
existance of the K\'Kree as a species was at stake to take such a step.

If the above suppositions are close to accurate, I can only assume that the
Steppelord of the 2000 Worlds and the K\'Kree on the street must think of the
Hiver-K\'Kree war as the most desperate military conflict of their entire
existance and of the Hivers as the most Evil of species.  If the K\'Kree have
a Devil, it has  six legs.  I shudder to think what preparations the K\'Kree
have made since the war.  A big asteroid at high velocity fixed with a Jump
Drive and aimed at the Hiver homeworld(s) comes to mind... :)

Every few months/years somebody brings this up.  Scraping the Saturn V was,
admittedly now, a VERY stupid decision but when you look at the NASA budget
at
the time and the PROMISED performance of the Shuttle there was no
alternative.
 NASA did not have the money to do almost ANYTHING else except to build the
Shuttle.  They didn\'t have the money to do science missions, let alone pay
contractors to keep the assembly lines open in case we needed the Saturn V
again.  NASA\'s other big program at the time, the Tracking and Data Relay
Satellite System (TDRSS), was financed with a loan from the Federal Financing
Bank.  My office, OSC, struggled for years to payoff the capital and interest
(remember the double digit inflation in the Carter years).

You can\'t just store blueprints for something as complicated as the 
Saturn V and 20 years later let a contract.  The parts are no longer being
made, companies are out of business.  Restarting the Saturn V would entail an
almost complete redesign even if we had a pristine copy of the blueprints."

The US has a annual budget of $1.4T.  About 1% is spent on the space program.

Change the national priorities and we could have a very different space
program today.  

PS:  NASA\'s budget took a $8B hit over the next 5 years recently.

I think at least some of the "Ithklur dissenter" comments are probably
Hiver comments -- some of the comments don\'t have the right point-of-view
to be an Ithklur, and sound much more like a Hiver.  Check the section

I\'ve been doing some work trying to design starships with FF&S. As a 
result of reading _The Moat Around Murcheson\'s Eye_, I\'ve decided to 
throw out all the fancy anti-grav technology in FF&S and see what 
kind of inter- and intra-stellar transportation I end up with.

The objective is to avoid using grav technology (so no inertial 
compensators, no contra-grav lifters, no gravitic focussing for 
lasers). 

The first ship type I set out to design was a 30-ton lander,
specifically short-range craft for getting from orbit to ground and
back. The craft is supposed to be relatively environmentally
friendly, so it doesn\'t use serious radiation-emitting drives. For
this reason I think I want ot avoid using HEPlaR drives for the
lander. Using an AZHRAE combination air-breathing jet/ramjet/rocket,
I\'ve found that thrust and fuel consumption are such that it can\'t
carry enough fuel to do anything useful. 

My questions are as follows:

  1. Has anyone tried fiddling with the thrust and fuel consumption 
     figures for any of the drives in FF&S? I recall a lot of that 
     went on in MT.

  2. In terms of radiation and general exhaust problems, what are the
     differences between HEPlaR and a fusion rocket? As far as I can 
     see, they both spew hot plasma out the back, yet no-one seems to 
     object to HEPlaR drives.

Has anyone else tried this?

I have some questions for people in general:

1). Whatever became of "Project Longbow" was it Psi Based, or more like a

Thanks for the replies guys I re-read the basic rule book about sensors 
but I still have questions and the logic behind how they are work.

When you play Brillant Lances and several objects are detected they are 
considered to be only blobs until a sensor lock is achieved after which
everything is known about the object.  This seems a bit strange to me as
a straight radar image contains a lot of information just picking up the
object like how far away it is, the size of the object, the velocity, 
direction etc.  More than enough information to allow a good guess that 
the object is a ship, missile, bouy, a rock etc.

I have no problem accepting that in order to hit an object its location 
needs to be known very precisely hence the need for a sensor lock but not
to make a general identification of what that object is.

Also considering the technological improvements used in the Traveller 
universe in other areas sensor technology seems pretty pathetic.

For the K\'kree government, possibly, but what about isolated K\'kree herds?

You haven\'t missed Nova :-)  

However, I think you are not giving the K\'kree credit for individuality. 
Even stable cultures exhibit local variation, and the behaviour of groups can
drift as fast as that of individuals.  Just look at the \'groupthink\' during,
for example, the Cuban Missile Crisis.  Peer reinforcement can be a positive
feedback mechanism as well as a stabilizing force.

What I am trying to get at is that avoidance of meat is not necessarily a
biological imperative, and anyway part of being sentient is being able to
overrule an instinct with reasoning.  Eating meat is regarded as perverted by
the vast majority of K\'kree in the mainstream of society.  So are many crimes
on Earth that keep cropping up (no pun intended).  Humans under pressure do a
lot of really strange things; why should K\'kree be different?

Think of the K\'kree as being stereotypical Bible-belt fundamentalists,
suddenly discovering a functional community of communists espousing free love
and homosexuality who continue to attend Bible class.  A holy war to wipe out
the heretics?  You bet!  

Note: the above is an analogy.  Personally, I view the dietary habits of the
K\'kree as being more religious or philosophical than biological.  After all,
our evolutionary ancestors ate fruit, grubs and roots, but most modern humans
couldn\'t stomach a meal like that.

The performance of many of the drives in FF&S are an engineer\'s dream.
What I\'ve found from my fiddling w/FF&S (many months ago...) that
designing a surface to orbit transport this way requires more
iteration then you would a starship.  However I vaguely recall makeing
some "house rules" mod in my system to compensate for this, can recall
it but I can dig for it if you\'re interested.

I think I have some things in this regard.  I\'ll post them after I get

In the Traveller Realm the HEPlaR reads like it\'s suppose to operate
as a heat exchanger, thus without the problems of induced radiation.
However, from a Hard SF point the performance of both engines with
indicate presence of thermal ions in the exhaust...no too "Green" as
some will say.

Some of the designs I\'ve done involves using a methane powered
reaction rocket (quaint ain\'t it?) but it\'s the easiest way to achieve
the required mass fraction to reach orbit with out making your lander
the size of Queen Mary.

As I mentioned previously, let me know if you\'re interested in any of
this stuff and I can post them after my Finals...sigh. :(

 I have neglected to enter all the UWPs due to its being a time consuming
and tiresome task that GDW will possibly overwrite soon anyway.
The asterisks indicate habitable zones for the two stars (a dubious
label when applied to Augur). Of Assiniboia\'s moons, Redes and Brumaire
are (in addition to Regina) fairly habitable, while Printemps and Harcourt
have atmospheres too thin to be comfortable. Most of the Lusor system is
populated to some extent, while the Darida system is nearly deserted.
 Regina\'s system _may_ have gotten more recent treatment by DGP, but I
found this one first...

have you tried using the T2300 space rules?  They were near future and used 
magneto-hydro-dynamic turbines (burnign l-ox and l-hyd) for most power 
generation, and got intertial thrust for landers by flooding the turbines
with 
excess fuel and venting the flame.
They tried quite hard to use realistic maths for thrust etc., so that\'d be a 
good place to start.
As plenty of people have commented its ****** difficult to build 1990\'s tech 
vehicles with FFS (or MTrav for that matter).

I suppose the Fusion rocket will have additional radioactive fusion
by-products 
in its exhaust, whereas the HELPAR "only" dumps UV, XUV and some XRays from
the 
plasma (it\'s *hot*, and highly ionised atoms radiate as they recombine 
electrically)

the worst problem, regardless of radiation, is the power levels.  I keep
seeing 
Grav bikes and such using 100kW to 2MW - think about dumping that hlot as
waste 
heat!  Trav anti-grav uses so much power that it alone is anti-social,
without 
beginning to consider the megawattage of Hot Plasma!

Think of a HELPAR drive as like a plasma cutting-torch and you\'ll get the 
picture.

Havent got the book with me ,but I think the difference between HEPlaR and 
fusion rockets is that the HEPlaR uses a shielded fusion reactor to heat
plasma which is passed through it and exhausted to provide thrust. A fusion
drive is just a fusion reactor, open at one end, that exhausts plasma
heated by fusion. As the reactor is open at one end, there is no shielding 
at that end, and all the nasty radiations that are produced in the fusion
reaction are free to propagate outwards.

	I am currently running a TNE campaign centered around Vyborg in

	appears in shops.)

	In my campaign, Vyborg survived the collapse almost untouched
	(due to the actions of the PCs), but all other places were hit
	badly. One of the worst case was a high-population waterplanet,
	with high-dense atmosphere (I think the place was called Vantage).
	All population lived in Grav-suspended cities because the
	atmosphere was too thick in sea level.
	When the Virus came, all the cities went down in a single night,

WRONG!! The shuttle is only 66.7% fuel tank and it can hit orbit
Under FFS it would have to be 1000% fuel tank to hit orbit. The FFS

I don\'t know if this helps...but a few weeks ago I knocked up a one-shot
anti armour rocket launcher.  The three major steps I went through were:

1/  Design the warhead (choose size, type, TL)

2/  Design the delivery system (artillery, rocket, missile, grenade?)

3/  Design the launcher

The weapon that I knocked up was a 10cm HEAP warhead, propelled by a solid
fuel
rocket.  The launcher was little more than a cardboard tube, which also
doubled as
the carrying case for the rocket.  More sophisticated launch mechanisms are
available, including (I think) provisions for multiple rocket launchers,
similar to the old Soviet MRLS.

Next week:  some TL-5 innovations from the Wehrmacht:  the \'Panzerfaust\'
(one shot anti tank rocket), and the \'Nebelwerfer\' (multi-barrel mortar).

You\'ll have to look at the scale of things. How do you identify a blob 
of a contact when it is following a fixed vector. On a planet where 
thnings are affected by gravity and a horizon things are different. 
Thus you\'ll need a lock-on to get a telescope to "see" the object. A 
missile can be made in such a way that it gives the same radar and IR 
image to a large craft. To properly identify this you\'ll need a 
lock-on. And a large craft can do the same thing by powering down and 
present a side of the craft that gives a small radar image.

See above.

As a former sensor operator from the Norwegian Navy, I\'ll agree 
partially. Firstly having too complex sensor rules just bogs the 
gameplay down. Most people just doesn\'t have the faintest idea what 
electronic warfare is about. Most people have this feed in by series 
as Airwolf, Knight Rider, Star Trek which are so far from the thruth 
you can get. But no ine objects, why, because it would destroy the 
story.

So the sensor rules in TNE is an improvement from MT which I never 
managed to stomach at all.

I expect that is primarily \'cos BL is a *board* game not an RPG; Trav itself 
should offer more in the way of tasks and incremntal information gain, (cf
Star 
Trek...)

>a straight radar image contains a lot of information just picking up the

I think outside the board game, you can sensibly assume that is true,
certainly 
velocity direction and distance.

HOWEVER:  *radar* is ACTIVE sensors - and if you use those, everyone in the 
system wakes up and says "oh there you are!"   The *easiest thing to detect
is 
someone elses active sensors being used, the next easiest is the reflection
of 
your own active sensors off a target, and the hardest is PASSIVE sensors - 
spotting the other shipo without giving anything away.

Most of the long range sensor argument concerns these passive sensors.

T2300 had the nice idea of a sensor drone, which was deployed with active 
sensors of its own and tight-beam telemetry back to the main ship.  Tough if
the 
drone got hit, but before then it lit up the system enough for you to get a
lock 
on most things.
\'Course, having stutter-warp drone helps too!

Trav is a hostile universe - there\'s lots of ships out to get you, even if 
you\'re a peaceful, unarmed vessel.
I expect an equal amout of Tech goes into ANTI-sensor stuff (coatings etc) to

balance many of the imporvements in sensors.

If you are really bothered, try using +/- TL as a DM on tasks!  That way a TL
15 
sensor suite against a TL 9 steamer has little difficulty in bypassing the TL
9 
attempts at concealment;  vice versa, the same TL 9 ship against TL 15
stealth a 
****** all chance of spotting its opponent.
That does then have the effect of further exagerating the importance of TL...

Personally I belive the DMs for difference in Computer cover much of the 
required factors, as the computers are heavily tied in to the imterpretation
of 
the sensor suite;  I could also argue that they are tied into the anti-sensor

suites too in helping produce decoy emissions, masking, and such

Yes, I spotted it. This is the only bit of the book I really object to.
Just for the record, I didn\'t mind the lack of \'facts\' - as far as the
Hivers are concerned, it works. It\'d probably work for the Droyne, too,
but I\'d prefer a more traditional format for the other races. One thing
I really missed was data on the homeworlds (maps etc), and Hiver space
(sector map w/stats, dot map, etc).

The shuttle is a lot more than 2/3 fuel tank; the orbiter + ET
combo has a dry mass of about 112 tonnes (32 tonnes tanks, 80 orbiter).
Fuel mass (LOX + LH2) is around 800 tonnes.  Payload is around 26
tonnes maximum.  And you\'re ignoring the solid boosters.

If anything, FF&S underestimates the difficulty in building things
which get to orbit.  delta V = g * Isp * ln(Mr) hurts a lot.
Real rockets get Isp in the 280 (Shuttle SRBs, many lower stage
engines) to 450 (Shuttle\'s main LOX/LH2 engines) range.  FF&S rockets
get ISP much much better than this.

long while I disliked the sensing task system in Brilliant lances because it
lacked variety in small vessel combat.  Assuming both ships were eqipped with

broke down the following way:
			Target Ship Using
Sensing Ship Using	Passive		Active
Passive			+0 Diff mods	-1 Diff mods
Active			-1 Diff mods	+0 Diff mods
ie there is no circumstance under which it is disadvantageous to use active
sensors over passive sensors, assuming the other ship is equally likely
to use passive or active sensors.
My solution:
I implemented the following rule:  If a ship uses G-Turns or active sensors,
it loses the advantage of Stealth or EMM.
This makes sense (no pun intended) to me.  The emissions from hot plasma
exhaust and active sensors are far harder to conceal using stealth-based
technologies over the ranges in which space combat occurs.  It has the effect
of making a decision to go active or use thrust much more important.
If anyone wants, I could include the full sensor rules I use, which redefine
sensing in terms of signatures, an idea I borrowed from 2300AD.  The above
rule change is the only deviation from actual Traveller: The New Era official
material, but the rules do clarify how ships are detected.

that from historians who worked with Saturn V engineers, but this 
material from the sci.space.tech FAQ shows destruction was not complete. 

>From Sci.space.tech FAQ

Contrary to popular belief, the plans and blueprints for the Saturn V
have not been lost. They are kept at Marshall Space Flight Center on
microfilm. The Federal Archives in East Point, GA also has 2900 cubic
feet of Saturn documents. Rocketdyne has in its archives dozens of
volumes from its Knowledge Retention Program. This effort was initiated
in the late \'60s to document every facet of F-1 and J-2 engine
production to assist in any future re-start.

The problem in re-creating the Saturn V is not finding the drawings, it
is finding vendors who can supply mid-1960\'s vintage hardware (like
guidance system components), and the fact that the launch pads and VAB
have been converted to Space Shuttle use, so you have no place to launch
from.

By the time you redesign to accommodate available hardware and re-modify
the launch pads, you may as well have started from scratch with a clean
sheet design.

Other references:

    Several AIAA papers delivered in recent years discuss reviving the
    Saturn V. For example, AIAA paper 92-1546, "Launch Vehicles for the
    Space Exploration Initiative". This paper concluded that a revived
    Saturn V was actually cheaper than the NLS vehicle.

An overview of the infrastructure still available to support production
    of a 1990s Saturn V and how that vehicle might be used to support First
    Lunar Outpost missions can be found in the December 1993 issue of
    _Spaceflight_, published by the British Interplanetary Society.

HOW LONG CAN A HUMAN LIVE UNPROTECTED IN SPACE

    If you *don\'t* try to hold your breath, exposure to space for half a
    minute or so is unlikely to produce permanent injury. Holding your
    breath is likely to damage your lungs, something scuba divers have to
    watch out for when ascending, and you\'ll have eardrum trouble if your
    Eustachian tubes are badly plugged up, but theory predicts -- and animal
    experiments confirm -- that otherwise, exposure to vacuum causes no
    immediate injury. You do not explode. Your blood does not boil. You do
    not freeze. You do not instantly lose consciousness.

    Various minor problems (sunburn, possibly "the bends", certainly some
    [mild, reversible, painless] swelling of skin and underlying tissue)
    start after ten seconds or so. At some point you lose consciousness from
    lack of oxygen. Injuries accumulate. After perhaps one or two minutes,
    you\'re dying. The limits are not really known.

Ok, I admit that the 66.7% fuel tank is a rough estimate based on a visual
guess (and I was talking volume, because in FFS that is what seems it be more
important)

Ok, when I bring up the FFS problems to people I get one of two reactions
1) They respond by saying that modern rockets do use up a lot of fuel. Or.
2) They quote a lot of real world physics

Well the responses are 
1) I know that real world rockets use a lot of fuel, but at least the can
hit orbit, and throw a little paylod into space. In FFS you can not build a
TL 8 or lower rocket and hit orbit at all.
And,
2) Real world physics is nice, but irrevelant, because this is a discusion
about FFS, not the real world. Physics describes whay hapens in reality,
FFS and the main rules describe what happens in Traveller games. The rules
are a model for reality and a fairly simple one at that. The rule don\'t
need to do reality exactly, just close enought so that you can have fun
playing the game. The problem is that in the real world Rockets hit orbit
at TL7, and in FFS they don\'t. If FFS rockets have a better ISP than in
reality then why can\'t they hit orbit in Traveller. Also what does ISP
mean, some of us haven\'t been in a physics class since high school. ISP
means about as much to me as BRB means to you
Have you tried to build a TL7 rocket that can hit orbit, please do because
thoes of us that have, have failed.
And in an attempt to get a respones from the nice people at GDW, I would
think that GDW would at least get this portion of the rules right, as in
the wilds Chemical Thrusters are what a lot of worlds would be using at
they try to reclaim the stars.

Though I\'ll undoubtedly attract quite a number of flames (this is very
nearly a religious issue here), here\'s my opinion:

The Traveller story actually begins in 1977, with a game called Traveller
(no "Mega" no "New Era", just Traveller).  As a late-seventies RPG,
Traveller was very advanced for its time, and was quite successful; a good
deal of support materials were produced, and a rather rich, detailed
background universe was developed.

Though it had a number of blemishes, inconsistencies, and other minor
problems, Traveller was not only one of the first (if not _THE_ first)
hard-SF role-playing games, but it was also the best.  It would probably
be fair to say that this original game has had as profund an effect on
Science-Fiction roleplaying as Dungeons and Dragons did on the fantasy
role-playing genre (the persons responsible [and yes, that includes you,
Loren] should feel justifiably proud, and take a bow).

This original game, now generally called "Classic Traveller" (or sometimes
just "the Black Books" - the rules were a series of small black books), is
long out of print, and generally available only at collectors\' prices.


The original game was updated and modernized as MegaTraveller.  The game
mechanics were updated, and an excellent "task system" were added, while
remaining relatively true to the original game system.  While characters
could move easily from "Classic" to "Mega" Traveller, not so for starship
designs or other hardware, and the official background universe was updated,
placing it in the throes of a violent civil war (called the "Rebellion" for
reasons which have never been very clear).

Unfortunately, MegaTraveller itself is riddled with logical and typographic
errors, as well as misformatted tables and other production problems.
Compounding these troubles is explanitory text and "design sequence"
flowcharts that never rise above \'fair\' except where they were lifted from
the original Traveller books, and providing that they weren\'t mistranscribed
in the process (those responsible should hang their heads in shame).

The end result is a set of rules which is not very beginner-friendly at all;
those who knew the original rules, or who had someone to teach them, managed
MegaTraveller fairly well.  I don\'t recommend MegaTraveller, unless you can
get it at a bargain price, or know someone who can point out the errata and
explain the confusing sections.


Traveller: The New Era is GDW\'s current Traveller product.  In some ways, it
can be considered an entirely new start: the original Traveller game rules
have been scrapped in favor of the Twilight: 2000 system; and the official
game universe is set after a complete collapse of interstellar society,
functionally severing it from the previous game universe.

In my opinion, the "tone" of the game has altered as well; there is a heavy
emphasis on combat and combat-oriented operations with a corresponding
simplification into well-defined "black" (opponents) and "white" (the \'good
guys\', including the player-characters).  Classic hard-SF, which provided
much of the inspiration for the original Traveller game, has much less
of an influence on Traveller: The New Era, which can probably be more
accurately described as Space Fantasy, rather than Science Fiction.

While there are a few more typos than should have been allowed to go to the
printers\', the basic rulebook is solid (though rather bloated at 384 pages)
with a very few exceptions.  The suppliment Fire, Fusion, and Steel contains
another 160 pages of starship, vehicle, and equipment rules which do not
appear in the main rulebook.  If you intend to make space combat a major
part of your game, you will also need Brilliant Lances, since the space
combat rules in the T:TNE rulebook have a number of flaws that severly
impact playability.

If you\'re going to create your own background universe, this is about all
the material you will need, although a few additional items (Battle Rider,
with rules for managing larger space battles, and Striker 2 for land
battles) may be useful, depending on the type of campaign you are
contemplating.  If, however, you intend to use GDW\'s official campaign
universe, there are many more books you can purchase.


Recommendation: Avoid MegaTraveller; if your choice is between the two,
definitely choose Traveller: The New Era.  HOWEVER, the Twilight: 2000 rules
system that T:TNE is based on is one that people either like or dislike,
there\'s relatively little middle ground.  If possible, play a session or two
before spending your money.  Another possibility for a SF role-playing game
is Steve Jackson\'s GURPS and GURPS Space (and associated sourcebooks).

  Doubtful. 
  
  A TL12 designer would be too used to solving problems with TL12
solutions. It would be far too easy to forget about the limitations of the
TL5 components when making the design. If the designer was quite familiar 
with TL5 equipment, they might get some benefit from higher tech 
optimisations which were able to be implemented at the lower level, and also
from higher tech design methods (CAD etc). That\'s probably about it though.

I bought the GDW Traveller the New Era game book and the supplement star
viking
s this weekend. Although I find nowhere any rules for shipdesign. I only find
r
eferences to FF&S and Brilliant Lances. Which one should I buy to have a
comple
te manual to build new, improved ships ?
 
Btw, Are there any BeNeLux traveller fans on this reading list (Belgium,
Nether
lands an Luxembourg) ? I would appreciate to get in touch with you.

   Ideally you would bring together a Lockheed Shunkworks type
team who would go over the plans and find suitable 1990s replacements
for the 1960\'s technology.  It wouldn\'t be that difficult actually, if your
team didn\'t have to worry about NASA bureaucracy, or AlGore
pressuring them to shake hands with the President more often, or
Congressman or Senator So-and-So leaning on them to buy parts from
specific vendors in Congressman or Senator So-and-So\'s district.
Launch pads just require that money be thrown at them--again not
that difficult (you have to build them from scratch, of course).

   Not if you use the Skunk Works approach.  For those who don\'t
know what I\'m talking about, basically Lockheed figured out back in
the 1940\'s that the best way to build an airplane (especially
something like the SR-71) was to hire the best and the brightest, put
them in an environment where they are free to experiment with new
concepts and designs, give them the tools they need to work, and give
them some goal to work toward (build a spy plane, jet fighter, etc).  The
result is some of the most innovative aeronautical design in aviation
history (the F-117 was theirs as well I believe).  Their approach would
work with designing a Saturn VI or whatever you want to call it.

   Discussions of this study were published in a number of other

that innovative (yes, bringing back old design and updating it can be

the engineering, it\'s finding the money and fighting the government

Sounds like now\'s a good time to thrash out some ideas & rules for sensors.
I\'d 
especially like to see a goo d distinction between the ease and *results* of 
passive vs. active detection.

Nah! If there\'s one thing GDW *don\'t* do, it\'s reality checks!  Look at the
bulk 
and weight of "ground cars" and their fuel consumption - you might pretend
its a 
limousine, but try building a "European compact" (or whatever it is USAns
call 
them) "cars" to me...

Try building a helicopter and comparing it to a real Sikorsky (cf recent
posts)

Look at the heat exhaust of a small grav car or grav bike.

To me, a Golden Rule of hard-SF has to be to check the low-tech elements
against 
real-world equivalents.  You look ****** silly when you get those bits wrong!

A lot of good books (and rpg settings) are build around this concept: 
Low tech level and high teory level (at least in some fiels).
Lot of steampunk fall in this typology (lefting out ether), Ancient 
technology use without a proper theory is another.

But maybe it isn\'t a theory level: Egyptians know about steam power and 
Sumers about electricity but their societies didn\'t need those technologies.

Maybe that the life in Egypt and in Sumeria would be a lot better if they 
made industrial application of those knowledge but that would made a
social revolution (as it happened in England some time later) and the 
powers that drive those cultures didn\'t need it.

Maybe in our future someone will wonder why, as we have the technology,
our culture don\'t have used the cold fusion that is \'so simple\'...

So when we talk about tech level we speak about the theory and the technology
actually used by that society, not the overall knowledge of the society.

Of course when we have a society that start with an high tech level and for 
some reason things go worse we have some interesting situations.
(It has ever happened in our history? Medieval tech level was lower than 
Romans?)

I think that the teach level is at least a bidimensional variabile (maybe
more)
and that trying to describe it all with a single value lead to 
unrecoverable troubles.

Ex:     Field/level     1       2       3       4       5       ...

        Medicine                X

AMES TEAM STUMPS FOR PLANET HUNTER, p 26
  NASA\'s as-yet-undefined strategy for locating planets around other stars
could breathe life into a $100 million orbiting telescope that scientists at
Ames Research Center want to fund.  the telescope, called FRESIP for the
Frequency of Earth-Sized Inner Planets, would be launched into a quasi-stable
orbit about 1.5 million kilometers from the Earth.  FRESIP was dealt a
setback
in February when NASA officials rejected it in the latest competition for the
agency\'s series of low-cost Discovery Missions.  FRESIP advocates say the
advantage of their telescope is that it would home in on the habitable zone
around stars where Earth-like planets may exist.

I\'ve been watching this discussion for a few issues, thinking about
jumping in, but have been too lazy.  However, I have nothing better
to do today, since the flood of May 8 is lapping over our front steps
and I\'m not going anywhere.  

The thrusters ARE broken.  The fuel consumption is somewhat 
*better* than the real-world, but the thrust-to-weight ratio is
pathetically low.  As an illustration, they give a TL5 liquid fuel
rocket 6 tonnes-thrust per ton of motor; in the Real World (tm), the 
V-2 rocket motor (a TL5 LF rocket) developed 20-30 tonnes-thrust
per ton of motor.

GDW also requires absurdly high Delta-V numbers to reach orbit:
they claim Earth requires 0.64 G-hours, which equals 22.5 km/sec 
delta-V.  In the Real World(tm), we require less than 10 km/sec (0.3
G-hours) to reach low Earth orbit.

Finally, GDW\'s formulas for calculating G-hours are broken.  Here\'s
the Real World formulas that apply to the Real World space program:


    Mass Ratio MR = Wl / Wef
                    Wl = Loaded Weight 
                    Wef = (Loaded Weight - Reaction Mass Weight)

    also:      MR = e ^ (dV/Ve)

    Exhaust Velocity Ve = 36,000 / FC
                    FC = Fuel consumption in tonnes/hour 
                            (yes, the number from FF&S)
                    Ve is in m/sec

    G-hours = ln(MR)/FC

    Delta-V = ln(MR)*Ve
              Delta-V is in m/sec

    Hohmann Transfer Orbit:
        dVh = Ve1 * sqrt( R2/(R1+R2) ) + Ve2 * sqrt( R1/(R1+R2) )
            dVh = total delta-V (m/sec) of Hohmann transfer orbit
            Ve1 = Escape velocity (m/sec) of start body
            Ve2 = Escape velocity (m/sec) of end body
            R1  = Radius of start body\'s orbit
            R2  = Radius of end body\'s orbit

     Orbital Velocity
        Vo = sqrt( R * G)
                Vo = orbital velocity (m/sec)
                R  = Radius of orbit (m)
                G = G (gravity) at altitude of orbit (m/sec^2)

      Escape Velocity
        Vee = sqrt (2*R*G)

      Delta V to achieve Orbit is, ideally, a Hohmann Transfer Orbit from
ground (which has the rotational velocity of the planet\'s surface as its
"orbital velocity") to Orbit, plus some extra for getting above the
atmosphere,
say +1-2 km/sec.

    Because of the ridiculous numbers for thrust-to-weight ratios in FF&S,
I arbitrarily changed them to be more in line with the Real World(tm); see 
below:

Chapter 9: Sublight (Maneuver) Drives

Page 70

(change): In the Self-Contained Thrusters table, use the following values for
thrust-to-volume/weight ratio instead:

TL	Type		Th
----
5	LF Rocket	20
6	LF Rocket	40
7	HF Rocket	40
8	AZHRAE (Rocket) 40

Final note: George Herbert\'s corrected tables for MegaT\'s Hard Times low-tech
rockets are also fairly accurate (in spite of he and Steve\'s quibbling over a
few
Isp\'s here and there), if you want a more detailed treatment of different
types
of sub-TL9 rockets.

                                                               -- Cynthia 

Brief Glossary:
       Isp  = Specific Impulse - time that 1 pound of rocket fuel can produce
                                            1 pound of thrust. Unit: seconds.
       delta-V = change in velocity required to do something. 
                     Unit: m/sec, km/sec, mph, furlongs/fortnight, pick your
favorite...
                       
       G-hours = same as delta-V, different units: Gravities * hours. Since
                       this is an acceleration * a time, it resolves to --
Velocity.

        Mass Ratio (Mr or MR) = Ratio of mass of fully fueled ship to 
                       mass of ship after all reaction fuel has been burned.

        Exhaust Velocity = what it says; how fast the hot stuff is spewing
out
                       the back end.  Has a direct relationship to how fast
the ship
                       can go....

         Hohmann Transfer Orbit = the absolute *minimum* delta-V to get from
                       point A to point B.  Used by people with limited fuel
supplies
                       who have a long way to go and no great hurry to get
there.

         Orbital Velocity = how fast you have to go around the planet to keep
from
                       falling down.  Those of you who have taken Dynamics in
college
                       had to go thru the agony of actually deriving this
equation from
                       those for rotational velocity and angular momentum,
and may
                       understand WHY you don\'t fall down if you go fast
enough.  I
                       know I did at one time.  Fortunately that part of my
life is a fast-
                       fading memory....

          Escape Velocity = like Orbital velocity, only faster; fast enough
to go
                       into a parabolic orbit around the body in question.
 Unlike
                       ellipses, parabolas are open-ended.... you don\'t have
to come
                       back.

As a former U.S.Navy petty officer, and wife of a former U.S.Navy
submariner, I have to agree.  For those of you who want to get a feel
for what real electronic warfare is liked, read Tom Clancy\'s novels such
as "Hunt for Red October" and "Red Storm Rising".  Even there, 
military folk say he errs on the side of having all the equipment work 
properly far too often -- other than that, he is quite accurate.  

For games that capture the feel of electronic warfare, Harpoon II in 
both the board and computer incarnations is quite good.  As for TNE,
if you use the TNE combat/sensor rules (not the other games, BL & BR),
and have a referee who knows what real electronic warfare is llike,
you can get close.

Note: a while back someone was saying something about the inaccuracies
in Tom Clancy\'s submarine novels.  I am given to understand, by 
submariners that I know, that his novels are very, very accurate, and
that the inaccuracies are of a deliberate nature -- that is, he couldn\'t
use the correct instances in his novels because they are CLASSIFIED.
He has a reputation for annoying security officers by doing things like
that -- learning classified information from his military friends, going out
and finding a non-classified source of the same information (like his
infamous
pictures of the Soviet Brightstar installation in "Cardinal of the Kremlin"),
and publishing only what he can point to as being available from non-
classified sources, thus staying legal, even though he originally found
out about things thru classified channels.  Thus the deliberate errors in
the submarine stuff.

electromagnetic
catapults.  Basically, these are spinally mounted weapons which have been
optimised for power efficiency and de-optimised for volume and length, and
operate like mass-drivers.  In particular, they favour very large designs,
such as could be used to launch a ship from the surface of a planet or make
an in-system transfer.  Military applications include planetary bombardment.
 
I have run into a problem.  "Footfall" by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle
describes the use of hyperkinetic weapons, basically chunks of rock which
cause damage purely as a result of the energy they gain during their drop
from
orbit.  I thought this would be good to include for electro-magnetic
catapults
and it turns out this additional energy causes a lot of damage (Obviously).
It can be determined from start distance, object mass and surface G of the
planet.  In fact, it overwhelms most other forms of damage, especially when
you start converting MW to kilotons of nuclear explosive damage (At 5 x 10^6
MW to a tonne of explosive, unless I am mistaken), which rather begets the
question why put a convetional warhead in such a missile? (Direct to GDW).
But I digress.
 
Basically, I do not know how much energy is reduced by atmosphere resistance.
I suspect a simple answer would be a subtraction from either velocity or
final
energy which would cause small objects to burn up and large ones not to lose
much damage as friction generates a shockwave which causes additional damage.
But I do not have any idea as to the scale of such reduction or whether this
is in fact correct.
Any ideas.

 Active EMS = radar, ladar, etc.
 
 Passive EMS = visual, IR, radio, x-ray, gamma, etc.
 
 Radiation receptors include cameras, telescopes, thermal
 viewers, radio and radar direction finders, etc.

 They are...as part of passive sensors

 Brilliant Lances, page 28. rules for crash start-up. In
 general, calculate 1% of power level, and see what this allows.
 This will usually allow Passive EMS, laser and maser commo,
 receipt of radio commo, and control of already launched missiles.
 Compare required power levels to see if life support & gravity
 can be run. Crew _may_ have to be in vac suits while "running
 cold" if life support is not powered.

 Yes.

completed the design. If anybody wants the source documents, I have the
following available:

let me know if you need a different file format -- if I can convert it I
will.

        I\'m really interested in comments on this, as this is my first
serious attempt at designing a useful combat vessel. I\'ve tried to balance
offense and defense to give this ship a reasonable punch and survivability.
Since I don\'t have any regular BL players, I don\'t know when I\'ll get the
chance to test it myself. I\'d especially appreciate hearing any scenarios it
gets used in, and what the results were. Useful comments might even find
their way into my next design.

Fuel scoops (2363m3 per hour = 50% of full load), fuel
     purification machinery (4.726MW) requires 36 hours for a full
     load of 4726m3
1) This ship is strictly a military space vessel. While it is
   streamlined for planetary landings, it does not have
   contragravity to allow it to hover. It spends as little time in
   the atmosphere as possible.
2) G-Rating is 6G. TL-12 g-compensators are only good to 3G;
   however, the thrust axis is aligned with the "up" direction of
   the ship. Thus, the crew can handle 4G\'s, and simply feel their
   own weight. At 5G\'s, crew in workstations are unaffected, and
   others (damage control), suffer +1 DiffMod. At 6Gs, workstation
   crew are at +1 and others are at +2.
3) The only deviations from the "standard" design sequence are:
  * I adopted the TL*50 limit on laser energy from the TML
  * I didn\'t understand the logic behind forcing bays to
    specific dimensions, so I ignored that when I designed the lasers
  * I ignored the requirement to recalculate G-Rating based on
    mass if the mass was greater than 15t/m3

I am updating the stats for Tavonni (Lanth/Spinward Marches) for Mike

Dead easy.

1. MegaTraveller is not available in the shops, not 
supported by GDW, and not covered in any RPG magazine above 
fanzine level.

2. TNE is the only official Traveller as far as GDW are 
concerned. It is coming out achingly slowly, despite the 
fact that great gobs of it can simply be created from the 
OOP MT stuff.

Unless you want to haunt game fairs and 2nd hand sales, you 
will be buying TNE. The descision as to whether this is 
good or bad is in your hands.

Have fun!

Unfortunately what we need is a system that can provide us with a cheap
means of getting mass into orbit.  The Saturn provided that, the Shuttle
does not.  For the Space Station to ever get developed we are going to need
something along the lines of Saturn again, or Energia.  The shuttle is
designed for re-entry from orbit, a useful tool if you have already
established yourself in orbit.  NASA and the Federal government (read
Congress, lobbyist groups) did the US Space program a huge disservice (IMHO)
when they placed the cart before the horse and sank most of their dollars
into the design and production of the Shuttle.  Other vehicles are now on
the drawing board, but none (to my knowledge) seek to address this problem.
I know that there are some NASA types on this newsletter - any other word?

Also, by placing the lauch site at the equator (like the European Space
Agency in Guyana) you gain 10-15% in the mass that you can effectively get
into orbit.  Why haven\'t we built nearer the equator?  Should Traveller maps
reflect this reality?

        Gee, Bob, maybe not everyone\'s been around forever and seen every
topic discussed. Maybe there are even people who are different from you and
_enjoy_ discussing "realism." Myself, the only thing I _don\'t_ enjoy on the
TML are people whining that we\'re not discussing only what they\'re
interested in. You want to discuss scenario ideas, go right ahead. Post
some. I like scenario ideas. I also like ship designs, I found the rock
throwing thread interesting, and I\'m enjoying the review of SDB feasibility.
Calling somebody "anal" doesn\'t benefit anything. You don\'t like what
somebody writes, don\'t read it. After all, you\'re not paying them to write.
When you do, you can dictate what they write. Until then, post what you\'re
interested in, and grant the same courtesy to others.

capable of pulling the wool over the eyes of the public. Therefore we buy
american for the dubious good of americans, hence all major launch

THE LAST THING WE NEED TO DO IS ANOTHER REDESIGN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  ISSA
elements are now sized for Shuttle or current ELV launches.  Switching to a
"new" Heavy ELV would entail another redesign which NASA, and the partners
can
not afford from either a $ or schedule sense PLUS design costs for a Possible
"Saturn VI."  I (ME ONLY, NOT ANYONE ELSE) think that we either make the
current design work or face station cancellation.

The DC-X is a flying test bed for a SSTO.  NASA is funding reusable X-craft. 
See WWW: 
http://gargravarr.cc.utexas.edu/delta-clipper/title.htm

Because there is no US territory close to the equator and we already have a
multibillion dollar investment in KSC.

>Should Traveller maps reflect this reality?

It would only matter in Traveller for TL 5-8 worlds or TL 5-8  nations on
balkinized worlds.  At TL 9 who cares?

   Actually you may be on to something.  I\'m wondering if it would be
possible to set up a TML FAQ document some place.  That way some
poor naive person will know what the sore topics are around here and
won\'t restart old wars with a perfectly innocent question.

   Stopping debate completely about certain topics (even if they have
been talked to death)?  I\'d rather not.  Limiting speech limits ideas,
and if this forum has one thing going for it, it is that is one of the most
diverse, free and open discussion areas regarding Traveller in the
world.  I\'d like to keep it that way.

>I for one don\'t want to know the in\'s  and out\'s of everything in the
>Universe, this is a game if you want  realism take a walk in the park.

   One man\'s anal is another man\'s sore point (a terrible pun that I will
retract....eventually).  Drink decaf.  Traveller as a game has always
attracted a certain kind of science-fiction fan--those that like a large
dose of realism with their star travel.  They want to know how it works,
why it works, and how to build one of their own.  They check designs
they have come up with again others in the real world (``say, this attack

Mind you not everyone who plays Traveller is like this, or like this
about every topic, but I would argue that those kind of people make up 
a majority of its players.


Thor Christensen writes about the Saturn V and the Shuttle:

   Actually, they didn\'t.  Skylab (if you can remember it) was suppose to
be the platform that the Shuttle was suppose to be using.  Unfortunately,
delays in getting the Shuttle space worthy (caused by budget cutting
among other things) caused a lengthy period of time when Skylab
went unoccupied.  Its orbit began to decay and it reentered the
atmosphere before NASA could send a Shuttle up to do anything
about it.

   Whenever you can\'t figure out something about any kind of human
interaction above the one-on-one level, the answer to `why not?` is
always either money or politics or both.  This is especially true when
something seems like a perfectly logical and worthwhile endeavor, but it
isn\'t being done or being done correctly.

   The U.S. has no Guyana, though if it were to re-annex the Philippines
it might.  The answer in this case is both politics and money.

   Should Traveller maps reflect this reality?  Interesting idea, except that
wouldn\'t contra-grav lifters nullify the advantages gained by taking off
from the equatorial regions?
