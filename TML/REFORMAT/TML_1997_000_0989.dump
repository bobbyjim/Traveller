If I remember correctly, it was either the Islands Cluster (Trillion Credit 
Squadron) or the Sword Worlds (as detailed in a JTAS article), or both.

What I find hard to believe is why anyone would send thousands of people on 
such a long expensive trip so far away.  What could they see 400 ly (or 
however many ly) away that demanded they undertake such a vast colonization 
effort with such a high risk and cost?  Why not a target significantly 
closer?  Or did they just pack the colonists on the ship and spin the 
bottle, pointing them in a random direction and they decided to stop 400 ly 
away just for kicks?

Obviously, the trip was written into Traveller history to explain the 
cultures/histories of the Islands Cluster/Sword Worlds, and it makes sense 
from that angle, but not from the point of view of the ESA at the time of 
the launch.

This leads to a question I have been contemplating for some months now.
Fusion powerplants have been sucking up hydrogen, fusing it and generating
energy, but I have not yet seen any rules or guidelines for what happens to
the helium produced. Or as Leonard has noted, any of the other elements, up
to iron, which has a net energy loss to fuse. Given the hydrogen intake, the
tech level at which is built, and other such considerations, should our
engineers be looking for somewhere or somemeans of flushing these fusion
resistant heavy nuclei out of the plasma? Could this be used to justify that
week in port between jumps? Could a plasma heavily contaminated with heavy
nuclei fusion by products contribute to mis jumps, or other unpleasant
accidents? What about the safety constraints? Heavy nuclei from a fusion
reactor have no electrons, so they are functionally the same material that
comes out the business end of a CPAWS. Maybe not travelling as fast, but
potentially as dangerous?

More questions than answers.

Suggestions?

The armour made a huge difference -- against stone weapons! The obsidian
chips in the Aztec maqaquitl (? their equivalent of the sword, anyway!)
simply shattered against metal armour. And, given the fact that these
weapons could only be used in thrusting mode, the main target of an attack
was the upper torso, just the area protected by the breastplate, or the
head - protected by the morion. The padded cotton armour that the Aztecs
and their enemies used could sort of protect agaist this - but european
tech steel armour was completely invulnerable. The reverse was, alas, not
even close to true - steel edged and pointed weapons more or less ignored
the presence of padded cotton.

The Spanish had other advantages that their opponents did not - due to
their higher tech level, but only indirectly. They had horses which, given
the primitive level of agriculture (even allowing for the maize plant and
several crops a season) the Aztecs possessed, the Aztecs could not have
supported enough of anyway -- after all, as you may well know, the reason
the Aztecs went to war so frequently with their neighbours was, quite
literally, to get meat for the stewpot ... this was one of their major
sources of animal protein in their diet, they just couldn\'t support much
else *and* their large population with their primitive level of agriculture
and lack of both the wheel and ships (log canoes don\'t really count).

The Spanish technology in the area of firearms is not as obvious an
advantage - a good English Longbow was better for range and rate of fire.
The problem with a good English Longbow was that it took ten to twenty
years to train someone to a reasonable level of proficiency, while with a
musket it took a couple of days at most Worse, the Aztecs didn\'t *have*
"good english longbows" ... they were lower on the tech scale (not really
represented well in Traveller TLs) even than that. Even if they did,
obsidian tipped arrows would have been much less effective than steel
tipped ones -- if certainly better than obsidian tipped swords.

Their lack of a really useful missile weapon compared to that of the
Spanish doesn\'t seem like much -- but fire shock is always preferable to
melee shock in combat, as it exposes the firers men to lesser danger (well,
I spose not if they both have the same tech weapons -- but even then,
tactics can minimise the effects -- tactics that, unfortunately, would have
been useless to the Aztecs as they had no equivalent missile weapon of
their own. The fire shock would have been enhanced by the noise and lack of
obvious connection (to such primitives) between cause and effect -- no
bows, no arrows or spears, and our guys are getting struck down by these
huge thunderbolts! Lack of tech such as *real* writing and something
approaching widespread literacy (which the Spanish were *closer* to than
the Aztecs) meant that superstition was more of a problem for the Aztecs.

Then there\'s the least obvious, but hugest, technological advantage that
the Spanish had -- *disease*. Because of their large cities -- their *many*
large cities -- and their advanced agricultural tech that allowed them to
keep *large* herds of domesticated animals they had a *huge* "disease
gradient". In other words, they were resistant to the diseases they brought
with them which, in turn, required the presence of many large cities (not
just one such as Tenochtitlan and allies) *and* large animal herds to allow
the crossover (after Macneill\'s "Plagues and Peoples"). Disease probably
did more than any other technological effect to defeat the Indians -- and
their level of tech meant that they didn\'t even recognise ways of dealing
with it (like isolation etc.) that the Spanish had, even if neither side
really had any medicines that worked against them

The Aztecs "preferred" the Spanish culture to their own!!! I\'m
flabbergasted!!! You don\'t *REALLY* expect anyone to accept that as a
serious statement? Surely not! The Spanish - and their imported diseases -
*DESTROYED* the Aztec culture; they replaced it almost entirely because the
culture was gutted and destroyed beyond hope of recovery. I have never seen
any suggestion, serious or otherwise, in any historical or anthropological
work on the conquest that would even vaguely support such a notion. You
simply cannot expect such a statement to be taken seriously.

As for "Aztecs" preferring to be "Spanish Peasants" rather than "Aztec
Slaves" -- well, your lack of knowledge is showing again. Apart from POWs,
who were destined for the stewpot *very* quickly, the Aztecs didn\'t *have*
a slave class -- they were starting to develop a sort of indentured
labourer class around the time the Spanish arived, but something like 99%
or more of *Aztec* society consisted of free men. There wasn\'t even,
strictly speaking, a "noble" class in a European sense -- it was the
Spanish and their monarchical/aristocratic mindset that saw Montezuma as
the "Emperor" of the Aztecs when he was nothing of the sort!

If we\'re going to argue about the Aztecs, please do some basic reading
first so you can argue on a basis of facts rather than fancy!

Again, you obviously don\'t have a clue what Aztec society was like, and so

Well, here you may have a point. However, the problem is, of course, how
many of the "lower classes" were, in fact *Vilani* -- evidently in the
Vilani Sourcebook there is a comment to the effect that, by the 1100\'s,
there were only a couple of hundred million ethnic Vilani left. Even
allowing for the Plague of Duskir, which I think is *vastly* mega-overrated
in its effects, this would seem to mean that the Vilani were always a tiny
minority in their own Empire. However, because the Vilani had a superior
tech, their culture -- or huge hunks of it -- would effectively replace
that of their subjects, and the whole Ziru Sirka would have been
*vilanified* -- just like the Roman Empire was *romanised* ... of course,
in some places the veneer was thinner than others.

But this still supports the idea that the Vilani didn\'t really have a clue
as to what sort of war the Terrans were fighting. Since the only successful
military tradition (such as it was) in the Ziru Sirka was that of the
Vilani, it was the one everyone looked to for clues as to what was going on
- -- and it would not have been until much later, which is what my contention
is, that anyone started to realise that this tradition was *useless* in
explaining the actions of the Terrans. Then it would have taken a *long*
time to convince all and sundry in a position of power that this was the
case, they would then take equally long, if not longer, to determine what
might be a suitable response, and they would always be *reactive* to the
Terrans as they would never really understand the Terran military mindset.

Cortez was never Emperor of Mexico. He was Viceroy for Charles V (or
whoever was the Spanish King at the time).

No, there isn\'t a complete, specific list at this time.  But if you have a 
copy of T4, it does list some specific Milieux they want to explore 
(Grandfather\'s time, the CT era, the Rebellion, Virus Era, the Far FAr 
Future, the Heat Death of the Universe, etc.).  I\'ve also heard rumors of 
stepping through the year 0 through 1400 period by 100 or 200 years (that 
is, a miliue book for each 100 or 200 years).  Nothing specific or 
definite though.

Besides, I think they have to focus on getting a core rules system and 
some adventures out there before doing any more settings. :)

BTW, M0 and First Survey should be out by this time next month, if all 
goes well.

Uhh...SSDS was developd online by some Traveller Mailing List people for
inclusion in the T4 Starships supplement (QSDS was also developed online by
TML\\GDW-Beta people).  It is still available online, and IG does not stop
the SSDS\\QSDS being available online.

Try Joe Heck\'s Web page at Http://www.missouri.edu/~ccjoe/traveller I

Why don\'t you forcibly introduce in a pulsating manner, silicon cubic
particles, into you rear excretory opening.

Sorry about that but the SSDS material is availble on the net and has been
before Starships was published. I feel that Charlie is "trolling", or is one

Hey, Franklin,

Normally, I like this type of rules extraplolation, but my comment is 
that it depends on what task system you are using.

If you are using the straight system as printed in the T4 main book, 
then your idea is great.  The addition of one point, one way or the 
other, gives players a benefit without giving them too much.

OTOH, if you are using a T4 task system fix in order to down play the 
part natural ability plays in the success of a task roll and increase 
the role skill takes, your system would not work well.

Using my task system fix, KBv1.1, players must halve the ability 
score and double the skill level to reach a target number.  It\'s 
obvious, using such a system, that your "interchangeable skill 
levels" would effect the target number with much more impact.

Thinking about this, I have a semi-rule in my games that I haven\'t 
quite nailed down yet.  It uses the notion of similiar skills too.

Let\'s say you have Guass Rifle-3 and you are trying to use a regular 
rifle.  I normal let players use like weapons--all rifle types--at 
one level lower.  So, under this rule, a player could pick up a 
regular rifle and use it at skill level 2.

Taking this a step further, let\'s say that the same Guass Rifle-3 
character wants to use a similiar but significatly different weapon 
like a laser rifle.  Basicall, the task is still to aim and pull the 
trigger, so I would let this player use his Guass Rifle-3 at 1/2 and 
drop fractions.  This would give him a Laser Rifle-1 skill.

There\'s a lot of little ways to play around with this idea of 
similiar skills.  In CT, the rule book said that all characters have 
a skill level of 0 with all of the weapons mentioned in the book.  T4 
has gone a step further and created a skill of Rifle and Pistol to 
cover all of the similiar skills.

I welcome any other thoughts on this matter.

Kenneth.

I\'m back with 4 Custom Hulls for folks to play with.  These formulae should
be good for any sized hull.  They don\'t, yet, take

There are some things I still have to work out.  For one thing, there has
to be a minimun plating thickness based on acceleration. Fro another, I
still haven\'t quite figured out how to handle internal structure.  But, I\'m
making progress.

I\'m also thinking about a double hull system.  The inner hull would be the
rectangular deckplan space that we *actually* work with.  The space between
the inner and out hulls would be where the jump grid, grav control devices,
etc are located.  The outer hull would be a shell of armor around the
outside of the inner hull.  I\'m still thinking.

Call the radius of the planet R, and your distance to the center of the
planet D.  Given that the angle from you, to the limb of the planet, to
the center of the planet is a right angle, with D being the hypotenuse, we
may derive:

  sin(theta/2) = R/D

where theta is the angular size of the planet in your sky.  Solving for
theta gives:

  theta = 2 arcsin(R/D)

Note carefully that we use the radius of the planet, not its diameter, in
the formula above, and that D is the distance from the center of the
planet, not its surface.

A quick reality check:  For D=R, R/D = 1, arcsin(1) is 90 degrees, double
that is 180 degrees -- and the planet fills half the sky, as expected when
you\'re standing on it.  For D >> R, R/D approaches 0, arcsin(0) is 0,
double that is still 0, and the angular size of the planet approaches 0,
as expected when very far from it.

Hope this helps!

No kidding. If T4 EVER wants to pick up any NEW players (not the old
geezers who\'ve been playing CT), they\'d better get out some kind of
setting NOW! Imagine this great sci. fi. role-playing just came out,
claiming great history, constantly referring to this mythical Imperium,
yet hardly any information is available in the single rule book. Just the
ticket to get new players into playing T4.

I checked out Starships in my local gaming store. Right now I\'m getting
more and more skeptical about IG. How\'s Central Supply Catalogue and
Aliens? I haven\'t gotten the chance to check them out yet. BTW was there
any explanation about why T4 stops at TL12?

One final note, In the discussion about economics as of late
I noticed one of y\'all saying the a actual transfer of goods
was needed to pay y\'als taxes. If you use the Venice traders
method you have all ready made the said transfer with the
establishment of off world trade banking. I.e. you have made
a transfer of somthing of value to another world with which
you wish to trade. Then every time you trade on or that world
the local office can handle the transaction crediting your
accounts with proper movement of value (cash paid out for the
goods you wish to buy, cash paid in from which you have sold)
This is the basics, traders will set up their own banking
system if the goverment in question will not. Usualy, goverments
will nogitate banking agreements honoring each others
Instruments (meaning,cash monies, checks, bonds, Gaming checks
(read poker chip) or any items of said value.) and violating this trust
means the loss of what ever assets held by that power or powers
depending on agreements.

Dakin Burdick <burdickd@indiana.edu> has recently got the "Galactic
Mailing List" up and running. He states the goals of the list as follows:

1.  Coordinate the creation of sector and world data.  The chief aim
    here is to avoid duplication or competition over development plans.
    If two people want to develop the same sector, then the first one to
    claim it takes precedence but may recruit the second to work on it.
    Once a sector is complete and added to the database of course, anyone
    can develop a world or adventure in it, which others must then follow
    in their own work.  These guidelines should increase the speed with
    which we not only develop the Classic sectors (my main interest), but
    also all the other alternate Traveller universes.

2.  Making the various designers aware of the various resources and talents
    of the others.  

To subscribe to the Galactic mailing list, send email to:

    majordomo@indiana.edu

Leave the subject line blank and type in the body of the text:

    subscribe burdickd_galactic

Majordomo will send you some info about the list along with its address.
If you wish to unsubscribe later, send to the majordomo@indiana.edu
address and type:

    unsubscribe burdickd_galactic

By the way, don\'t include a .SIG file with your message, as this will
mess up a majordomo mailer.

Dakin wants people to introduce themselves in their first message:

   "Tell us your name, email address, the area of galactic that
    you are working on or are interested in, and as much background
    about yourself as you would like to give us."

Anyway, I hope this info comes in handy... seeya on the list perhaps...

In the Milieu 0 book you\'ll find that the Imperium has a very fixed idea of
how planets should be allowed to develop technologically. And yes, it\'s all
to do with controlling trade, with the intention both of long term profits
and long term _dependence_ upon the Imperium. There are also obvious points
about trading high tech weapons (for example) to low tech worlds who cannot
(not having the appropriate history) truly comprehend the usage of such
without the possibility that they will annhiliate themselves and perhaps
anyone near them! Technology importation has to be handled quite carefully
and I see that as a major focus of the Scout Corp, certainly during the
formative years of the Imperium. Just letting any old trader import whatever
he liked is going to lead to the T.E.D. situations of TNE, and such a T.E.D.
is then going to resist forcibly anyone else\'s (e.g. Imperium) attempts to
override their authority.

Anyone on this mailing list like to advocate free trade (including weapons)
to Saddam Hussein? I\'m sure he\'s above TL5?

Anyway, those are _my_ _personal_ thoughts and the way I run my game. If
others prefer to have a less restrictive Imperium, that\'s up to them -
everyone should be free to run their games as they like.

The cynical part of me looks at it like this: its all commercial reality.

You have a large established base of players, many now in their 30\'s
with far higher disposable incomes than your average newbie. This
group generally has a good working knowledge of the background, and
knowledge of RPGs and hard science. *Therefore* As the producer of
the latest edition of the game, you produce the rules first, secure the
loyalty of the established player base (and the really cynical part of me
say\'s use them as a massive playtest). Then and only then, do you
aim to expand the player base. *Therefore* what gets released first
1:   Basic rules
2:   Equipment and advanced rules
Only after these things do you start producing things such as
background materials and adventures.

     THE IMPERIAL HOPE: A GRADUATE SCHOOL OF THE UNIVERSITY OF SYLEA
     
     The University of Sylea\'s Faculty of Arts offers two-year scholarships 
     for outstanding social sciences students aboard the "Imperial Hope", a 
     converted 2,000t merchant which serves as a travelling graduate 
     school. 
     
     The "Imperial Hope" is a surplus 2,000t streamlined merchant, 
     converted to a social science research school. The "Hope" will usually 
     be encountered in orbit around one of the Sylean or nearby worlds, and 
     its students and staff will be engaged in various research and 
     coursework activities, both on board and on the mainworld. 
     
     The "Hope" only has jump-1 capability and so rarely leaves the Sylean 
     Main. The ship generally tours Core sector for eleven months each 
     year, returning to Sylea for one month of overhaul, refit and staff 
     rotation. The ship\'s itinerary is determined (within reason!) by the 
     specific research being undertaken by the students and staff. Insystem 
     time ranges from a few hours (refuelling only if there is nothing of 
     academic interest in the system) to a maximum of about four weeks. 
     
     Each graduate student receives a two-year berth aboard the "Hope", 
     which entitles them to a double-occupancy middle passage, full life 
     support, and access to onboard teaching, library and research 
     resources. In addition to their studies, students learn the basics of 
     operating a starship by assisting in various duties (roll 5+ on 1D for 
     each of Ship\'s Boat-1, Engineering-1, Steward-1). 
     
     At the end of their time aboard, the students receive a Masters degree 
     from the University of Sylea. Those completing the course with honours 
     are eligible to continue aboard for a further two years as junior 
     academic staff and researching to receive their doctorate. 
     
     Academic staff are organised into three schools: Politics, Economics 
     and Sociology. Some of the most outstanding social scientists of the 
     Imperium have spent time as academic staff aboard the "Imperial Hope". 
     Staff members sign aboard for up to four years, after which time they 
     exchange with other staff from universities all over the Imperium. 
     Staff positions aboard the "Hope" are highly prestigious, and confer a 
     temporary +1 SOC (to a maximum of A, and only while a member of 
     staff). 
     
     The shipboard crew of the "Hope" are a collection of retired Scout, 
     Navy and Merchant personnel. However, it is surprisingly easy to find 
     a position aboard, as some crewmembers quickly tire of the academic 
     staff and their "caramel sauce" students ("Why caramel sauce? Think of 
     something rich and very thick..."). Students and junior crewmembers 
     take considerable pleasure in baiting each other, generally in good 
     humour. 
     
     The "Hope" is outfitted with excellent resources, including an 
     extensive holocrystal library. While insystem, the library is updated 
     hourly via data link to local library resources. 
     
     Adventure hooks: 
     1. PCs may be graduate students aboard the ship. 
     2. PCs may be academic staff aboard the "Imperial Hope" (required: 
     Int, Edu or Soc A+ plus a doctorate in one of the social sciences)
     3. PCs may be members of the permanent shipboard crew of the "Imperial 
     Hope"; the "Hope" also signs crewmembers aboard for temporary working 
     passage.

XTech Industries Sends Letter of Intent to Imperium Regarding New Ship 
Design.

Early this morning, the egnimatic CEO of XTech Industries, Commander X, sent 
his official "Letter of Intent" to His Imperial Magesty.  The letter states 
that XTech, a newly founded, privately owned, shipbuilding and electronics 
firm, intends to build a long range exploration and recontact vessel for the 
IISS.  Part of the LoI is as follows:

"Your Imperial Magesty,
I Commander X, your loyal servent and citizen, do hereby state my intent to 
accept his magesty\'s challange.  It would be my honor, and my duty, as a 
buisnessman of the Imperium to accept your magesty\'s request for a Long 
Range Survey and Recontact Vessel.  I am currently in the "phase one" step 
with my engineers, that being the concept and design phase...."

The rest of the message was censored due to the request of Commander X, as 
it involves corporate secrets.  The Commander says he is aware of others 
wanting to gain the Emperor\'s favor, and is careful to avoid leaks.

Quote from the Commander: "The guantlet has been cast, may the best design 
achieve his magesty\'s wishes!"

This concludes this Press Release from XTech Industries Corporation.

I often included these on MT ship designs as part of the anti-hijack
package.

Anyone else think that a computer with the crew\'s patterns recorded can

You might want to tell folks what area you are in, how far you are capable

Thanx for the plug Suz! :)

Now to add to it.

Planet X is currently undergoing a major facelift this year, and hopefuly 
will be in some form of compleation by the Middle of this month.  The Beta 
test (current) has proven to be a compleat success and the time for a full 
1.0 version is evident.

New features will include.
Compleatly new design interface, the 3 "tech levels" of the beta will be 
fusied into a consolidated site.  There will be graphics, but ALT tags and 
text links will be included for all text viewers (A courtesty to Joe Walsh, 
and other shell users!  :) )

The VRML site will be upgraded to VRML2.0 I understand that Netscape\'s 
Live3D has a VRML2.0 upgrade available, your old VRML1.0  browser will NOT 
be able to see it. So get ready for the future!  Upgrade Today! :)  The VRML 
site will be accessable via link from the main page interface.

As Suz stated eariler, I will have an #traveller IRC page, i will try to 
make the FAQ as complete as posible.

Also a Newbie Zone will be available for people new to the game to get info, 
and hopefuly, encourage them to become loyal travellerites!  Yes, Commander 
is for "Grass Roots" encouragement.

As always my friends....
Keep the Flame!
Commander X out.....<TRANSMISSION ENDS>

Jeff,

I agree with you more room should be made for accommodations.  

OTOH, it\'s quite possible that people will have a more Japanese attitude
toward their sleeping spaces a few thousand years from now. If that\'s true,
and we have gravity control, then even a half ton will be plenty for the
sleeping compartment...walk into a stand-up "closet", turn on zero-g, and
go to sleep.  <g> You might have your storage in the same space, or down in
the hole.  The "facilities" would be down the corridor.  Most living space
would be in commons areas.

Still, I tend to design ships with more conventual quarters. <g>

>  ...the typical cabin on a cruise ship...is 150-200 square feet
>  floor space, including the \'fresher (shower, sink, toilet).

Those would be the equivalent of Large Staterooms:  4m x 4m, about 13ft x
13ft.  That\'s plenty of space for 2 or 3 people.  On ships (star or
otherwise), I expect the cabins to be somewhat smaller than that. 
Passengers and Crew will spend most of their time outside their rooms in
commons or work areas.

I have 4 passenger levels:

1st Class - luxury accommodations, 6 to 8 tons of space, 1/2ton
            baggage.

2nd Class - standard accommodations, 4 to 6 tons of space, 1/4ton
            baggage.
            
3rd Class - modest accommodations, 2 to 4 tons of space, 1/8ton
            baggage.
            
4th Class - cold passage, 1 ton of space, 1/8ton of baggage.            

I\'ve designed standard deckplans for several types of quarters:

SINGLE CABIN - 2.5x3m (1.875dt), is very workable for a single 2nd class
passenger or junior Officer.  The room is cramped, but the resident would
spend less time there than at work stations or in commons areas.  It
includes a fold down twin bed on one wall.  On the wall at the foot of the
bed is a wall terminal for entertainment and/or work.  When the bed is up,
a table can be folded down just below the terminal, exposing a data entry
area.  There is a folding chair in the room.  The room has a small
closet/storage space (ship rules on lockability).  There is also room for a
fold down (or recessed) mini sink and toilet.  A communal Fresher is down
the corridor.

SMALL STATEROOM - 3x3m (2.25dt), is a slightly larger version of the Cabin.
 A double bed that folds out from a small sofa makes this the cabin of
choice for 1st class passengers on smaller ships, 2nd class frugal couples
on larger ships, or ship\'s Officers.

PAIRED CABINS - 6x3m (4.5dt, 2.25/cabin) A pair of Cabins share a small
Fresher located between them.  The accommodations of each cabin are similar
to the Single Cabin.  This arrangement is very acceptable for higher ranked
crew quarters, or for 2nd or 3rd class passengers.

PRIVATE BUNKS - 2x2.5m (1.25dt) Smaller version of the Single Cabin, with a
chest (rather than a closet) for storage.  These rooms are for 3rd class
passengers and crew.

LARGE STATEROOM - 6x3 (4.5dt) These suites include a fully
functional private fresher.  They feature a queen sized bed, a pair of
comfortable chairs, entertainment and work terminal, a dressing table and
closet space.  These luxury suites are reserved for 1st class passengers
and high ranking Officers.

Most of the space is in the commons areas.  You need to think about such
things as Galleys, Wardrooms, Dining Halls, Lounges, Game Rooms,
Gym/workout Rooms, Conference Rooms, Sickbays, etc, etc, etc!

I\'ve started to work on all of this, but only slowly.  I\'ve even got *some*
of the rooms on disk as VISIO stencils. <g>

the BARD system.  If you said, "Hey, that\'s me" to any of the comments
above, then we can use your help.  The Reformation Coalition is suffering
right now and we need a consolidated place for all information to be stored,
that is what BARD is for.  Please join the fight, and help us keep the RC alive.


Seriously, since IG has decided to put off the Reformation Coalition setting
till much later, it is up to us, it\'s fans to keep it alive.  I have already
started doing this and a small group of us are working to try to develop new
information and such for the RC.  If you enjoy the RC setting please let me
know, I am sure there is something that you can do to help, if you are
willing.  Thank you for your support.  (This plea is for the RC only
currently, no Pocket Empires, No Wilds, and No Regency support currently.)

Nice use of a reference, much better than just saying this is what we are
told ;^)  OK, I go ahead and concede Mikesh could have been building
starships.  And from now on I assume that Trillion Credit Squadron in not a

OK, lets use Striker. If we have Industrialized TL-13 (just for the sake of
argument) Vargr world with a population of 60 billion, this gives us a GDP of
1,512TCr (of course we don\'t know is such a world exists or not since we do
not have data for the Provence Sector, but such a world could exist).  Now if
we assume that military spending is 8%, not unreasonable considering the
tension between Vargr states, we get a military budget of 120.96TCr.  Take
40% for the Army, Multiply by 10 to get standing fleet size, and leaving 30%
behind for home defense would give us and invasion force of 508.032TCr.  So,
would this be a force large enough to bring Mikesh under Vargr control?

CSC is great, haven\'t gotten into Aliens yet, as I also picked up the new #G
at the same time. (Gearheads unite!)

T4 stops at TL12 since that is the tech level the Imperium had when it was
declared.  Later Milleu Books will include higher TL equipment.  IMHO, TL12
is a great enviroment to game with, since things are still vaguely familar.

I gotta agree with this. Tech 12 gives just the right balance of
familiar -- gauss projectile and laser small arms for the masses with
high-energy military weapons,  ***battledress*** and Your Friend, the
Meson Artillery.

It certainly seems possible. You could place a large chunk of
solid-state memory hooked up to the ship\'s computer (where it would suck
in, say, the last 72 hours\' worth of communications, sensor info, data
on the ship\'s systems, etc.), then give it its own gravitics system,
internal battery, and armor it to hell & back -- say with a USP of 10.
If whatever destroys the ship has less damage left over than the AR of
the black box, then it would stand a good chance of surviving.

What would be the game mechanics of such a device (volume, cost, etc.)?
Comments, anybody?

Phil McGregor wrote some comments on the Luxury Liner in Starships.  As
the guy who wrote it up I figured I\'d respond.

>effective HP Cabins, @ 4 tons per cabin and 1 ton dedicated cargo space (it

I have to admit I didn\'t know about baggage requirments for passengers
and crew. If you want to fix this remove 114 of the High Passengers and
use that as cargo room. 

>185 Crew Cabins assuming single occupancy of a Small Stateroom @ 2 tons
>each = 370 tons.

I am a much harsher person than Phil, becuase only the Captain and
First Officer are in singles. The rest of the command staff is doubled
up, and the crew is triple bunked.  

>699 total crew and passengers, requiring a 5 ton "Rescue Ball" (read the
>description on Page #6 - its *required*) for every four = 699/4 = 175
>(approx.) = 175 x 5 tons (no allowance for launching mechanisms) = 875 tons

Don Perrin never told me that ships needed these. Do any of the ships
in the book have these? I don\'t recall seeing any.  Also I think they
are pretty dopey, and the chance of them being used pretty slim.

>Add 2000 tons for Jump Fuel (J2), ...

Jump fuel is 10% of ship volume multiplied by Jump Number, so the Liner
requires 20% of 5000 tons or only 1000 tons of fuel.  At least that\'s
how I recall the computation.

>Total = 6555 displacement tons ... all in a 500 displacement ton hull!
Its a 5000 ton hull. From your Jump fuel calculation I assume you know
this, but just pointing out your own typos.

>And note that the idea of a Luxury class passenger sitting in a notionally
>4 (or even 8) displacement ton cabin - is laughable (its 3 x 6 meters, and
>that doesn\'t allow for the 1 ton supposedly allocated to general passenger
>spaces rather than cabin space - leaving that out, its 3 x 4.5 meters)!

That\'s why the design of the ship includes a 9000m^3 Ballroom. (Its
about 2/3 of the size of the Ballroom of the Hilton in Atlanta. I
figured that out during the Crow II presentation at DragonCon Last Year)
The ship also has a 500m^3 casino and a 500m^3 sports and rec center.  

We could argue back and forth about how much space high passengers
really want, but this ship has more space and accomadations than most other ships.  

I never saw plans for the King Richard by FASA, but I read that it too
was 5000 tons, Can anyone give details on numbers of people it carried
or anything else useful?

I realize some of the above details aren\'t in the Starship books. I
sent the complete design sheet to Don, but he didn\'t put any of the
details into the write up.  I did write up the flavor piece, but I
figured Don would change it around and include some of the details from
the design sheet.  I guess I figured wrong, well live and learn.  

I don\'t really like the new USP, I much prefer the FFS design listings
from TNE, it had much more detail to the listing.

 Would this necessarily happen in a ship with artificial
 gravity?  Wouldn\'t it and inertial comp prevent this kind of
 thing from happening, so that a passenger who _doesn\'t_ go to
 the lounge might not know when the ship takes off, and only
 realizes that is has when that unmistakable sensation of jump
 entry is felt?

 I remember a "Science Magic Show" at a college I attended for a
 while.  A regular party balloon filled with propane and air in
 the proper ratio didn\'t blow out the windows, even in the
 first-floor lounge it was being done in (floor-to-ceiling plate
 glass) - but the people on the tenth floor of the building (a
 high-rise dorm) both heard and felt it.

Well, it\'s been a while since I\'ve done one of these! :)  I just got off 
the phone with Courtney, who called to tell me about some great things that 
will be happening soon.  He\'s heard our constructive criticism, and this 
is an advanced peek at some of the things that IG will be doing to make our 
experience with T4 the best.  Here are some of the things planned for 
the next couple of weeks:


IG Web Site
===========

Within the next 10 days or so, the IG web site will undergo a radical 
change.  There will be feedback areas for each product, as well as a 
forum for discussions.  Courtney plans to ask Marc Miller and the other 
T4 designers to hold forums there from time to time, so that we can 
discuss Traveller with the people making it happen.  And, the site will 
be updated frequently.  They want to make the site a fun and vital part 
of the Traveller experience.


Direct Orders
=============

Courtney wants to make up for the problems experienced by those of us who 
ordered directly from IG in the past.  Once the web site is updated, there 
will be a limited time offer posted that will allow direct orders to be 
placed at a 30% discount.  And, of course, all orders will be shipped in 
bubble mailers, and will arrive in a timely fashion.  Give direct 
ordering a try again - they\'ve listened to our criticisms, and they\'ve 
greatly improved the process.


Starships
=========

The web site will soon feature an area where one can download the items 
that are missing from the _Starships_ book - the things we thought  
should have been there, or should have been done differently.


Look for these changes in the next 10 days or so . . .

Well, congratulations to Courtney!  With all the controversy recently,
around the JTAS shipping charges, and seemingly mediocore\\overpriced I was
really getting down on T4, at a time when it needs to garner as much support
as possible (before the summer, when TSR introduces it\'s new SF game, Alternity)

This all sounds great!  I\'d love to have the chance to chat with Marc and
the other designers to directly voice our opinons on the products that are
being produced, and what we can do to improve it.

Well, I hope so.  My UN-FLGS (Yes! That\'s UNFRIENDLY local game store)
doesn\'t stock anything almost besides way out of date stuff, and then WW,
TSR, SJG, Star Wars.  So, the only way for me to get my paws on T4 products
is to win one of these monthly contests, or order direct.

That definitely does sound good.  But what exactly does it mean?  Ae we
going to see better deckplans, or what?  Can you be more specific?

Well, who in this established base doesn\'t have starships and equipments
that can readily be plug into play? There is no good reason why the
backgroud books need be released 2-3 months after the basic rulebook.
Even after a book on *minor* alien races!

Again, there is no good reason why they can\'t publish the background
simulteneously or even *soon* (not months later) after the rulebook is out
on the street.

Great!  I\'d be willing to help in some Starship design, and coding that
needs ot be done (HTMl that is!), as well as, like I said the HTML design.
If we could get this done well, with the inclusion of SSDS (with designer
permission) it could work out quite well.  

Anyone else out there want in?  I\'ll start up a contact list.

Huh?

Traveller Alien Module 6, Solomani (GDW, 1986) gives a few
correspondences between Imperial and Terran dates.

001-   0   19 Jan 4521
001-1111   16 Apr 5631
111--2537   1 Feb 1986

I\'ve never calculated 001 for certain \'historical\' years. Since a
Terran year is 365.25 days (in Traveller) and an Imperium year is
365 days there\'s a certain amount of drift between the systems. We 
don\'t know if the Rule of Man uses a 365.25 day year, or calculates 
leap days as we do now. (We don\'t add a leap day to certain century 
years, etc.)

It imagine Ziru Sirka uses a Vlandian calendar, and the Rule of Man
uses a Terran calendar. During the Long Night, worlds probably use a
Terran calendar, local calendar, or possibly a Vlandian calendar (if
they feel really nostalgic). It also seems to me that the Sylean
Federation uses a Terran-based calendar. Why else would Cleon pick a
calendar with 365 days? Why not 350 days? 500? 700? 1000?

Plenty of headaches exist transitioning from year 649 SF to Year 0
without radically changing the number of days in a year, too. Imagine
how many contracts exist before Year 0 which are enforceable through
655 SF or later. Legal documents probably use both the old Sylean
Federation date and year, in addition to the new Imperial day and
year, during Year 0 and other early years of the Third Imperium. Some
documents might even have a Vlandian date, Terran date, Sylean
Federation date, and Imperium date to commemerate Year 0 and
celebrate past Empires.

I imagine that the Sylean Federation uses a Terran calendar and
goofs on keeping track of leap days. By the time the Solomani contact
occurs, correcting the discrepancy would cause more headaches than
it\'s worth.

BTW, here\'s January 4521:

        What is it?

        A zipped packet that contains STARS-V1.XLS, SS-WEAP.XLS and
        STARSHIP.TXT files.


        What they can do?

        STARS-V1.XLS is T4 starship design spreadsheet which contains
        all needed FFS tables. Needed starship components are selected
        from pull-down menus, and the final ship data is shown in
        "Brilliant Lances", "Battle Rider" and "T4 USP" formats.
        The ship data can be transferred into text file simply by
        cut-and-paste.

        SS-WEAP.XLS is starship weapon design spreadsheet which contains
        all needed FFS tables. It can be used to design lasers, particle
        accelerators and meson guns.  Weapon options and components are
        selected from pull-down menus, and the final weapon data is
        shown in "Brilliant Lances", "Battle Rider" and T4 formats. 
        The weapon data can be copied into STARS-V1.XLS weapon table.

        STARSHIP.TXT is a short readme-file.


        What are the limits?

        When the hull displacement is over 100000000 DT, the Excel will
        become more difficult to read when the values are displayed as
        as 1E+08. While it is still possible to design ships that are
        larger than sun, the jump ships are limited by the increasing
        surface area requirements.
        

        Where it can be found?

        The packet can be directly downloaded from my web page at:

        http://www.ee.tut.fi/~lahtinen/Traveller/Stars-v1.zip


        Why it was made?

        Originally I was trying to make a QSDS starship hull designer,
        but the project spontaneously expanded. I felt that QSDS was too
        limited, and so I expanded the original spreadsheet to include
        more and more starship components.
        Since I put the first version on my web page, several persons
        have mailed me suggestions how to improve it, and the Stars-v1
        is now complete.

    I like your idea of the flying grad school however I noticed that it 
is equiped with fuel scoops. Does this imply that the ship itself is
going 
to skim gas giants for fuel? If so I feel that this may be dangerous to
to the crew and the passengers because of the inherently dangerous
nature
of the skimming procces and not to mention any corsaires that might be 
lurking in the above mentioned GG. The corsaires however are not a
serious
issue when you are only traveling around in well developed systems that
have
a decent deployment of system defence boats. I think that this problem
could 
be addressed by includeing an autonomous fuel skimming module. This may
slow
down the refueling procces however it is quite a bit safer than risking
the
entire ship just to refuel.

    I only make this point because I have seen roughly 6 vessels ranging
from
skimming modules to starships lost in a gas giant due to refuleing in
the four
years I have played traveller.

I\'m some newbie on this list (and on TNE Rpg). As I read the Extended System
design, I was very interested in Star classification and I\'ve found some
very interesting information ine Encyclopedia

I don\'t have the precise data in the mind but :

    0  Blue       35000 K       He *
    B  Blue                     H  * 
    A  Green      10000 K       H+ *

    G  Yellow      5000 K       Hydrocarbons
    K  Orange                   Heavy metals
    M  Red         2500 K       Metal Oxydes 

* = I\'m not sure, I have to check it.

Ia, Ib, II   Supergiant Stars (rare because of their very short life span)
III, IV      Giant stars (called Red Giant)
V            Main sequence (called dwarf stars) (80% of known stars)
my classification also describe a type VI  (brown dwarfs), 
                            and a type VII (famous white dwarfs) 
Size type IV, V and VI are really close

Sun is G2V. M0V star is a small Red star. I think that the radius is smaller
than the sun\'s.
I could give you some relative radius array, function of Specteral type and
size, I\'ll check it up in my book

This star might be old one, but as the color and size changes during the
star life, this star could be anything. I would be glad if someone have some
more precise informations about life cycle of stars.

I\'ll check if I\'ve some information about that point, but I think the only
information I\'ll get is about the Sun.

V - small dim.

it started off with small hydrogen reserves compared to the sun, but it\'s barely on a simmer setting. lifetime will be several times longer than the sun, try 20billion as a ball park.

it\'s on the main sequence, where stars spend most of their lives.
so it\'s age is anything from 2 billion to age of universe-2billion. so no age in particular.

the light/radiation it\'s chucking out will be heavy in the red and infrared,
and weak in the blue light, let alone the UV

whilst you are close to the star, there isn\'t a lot of energy there for flares,
but it\'s possible the triggering porcess will be slower. Like a jacuzzi compared a volcanic mud pool, it could wait and the go pop. And I\'ve heard the major damage is the high energy particles rather than UV/X/gamma. you\'ll have maybe 30 seconds after the visual flare before the high speed alphas etc hit.

ecosphere-
earth temperature or earth light? the IR will make it hot if you go for the same brightness:

earth temperature - it\'ll be dim. if it\'s using chlorophyll/imported stock, expect large leaves. pictures of stuff at the ground of forests and jungles would be about right. such plants would be useful anywhere else, colonising Mars type planets.

earth brightness - it\'ll be hot. water holding for the plants will be tricky. Go for jungles or cacti deserts/outback.

old planet - 
expect tidally locked. animals will be highly evolved, probably with poisons/advanced pharmaceuticals. 
plants may have evolved defensive measures, to conserve whatever sugars they do photosynthesise. 
carnivorous plants are mainly for nutrients/minerals, not sugars.
but symbiosis could be good, an animal living with the plant, and fending off all other grazers. most likely  to be something small like ants.
lizards could be a good one, given the temperature. they can also go dormant to conserve energy...

Nah, TCS is still a valid reference, just ya gotta remember that its

Yep, would say that such a world could reduce Mikesh given time (and the will,
especially important for Vargr). Is such a world plausable? Yes, uncommon,
but still well within the bounds of reasonable. Such a Vargr world would have
a strong tendancy toward instability, but that could provide reason for the
leader
to risk an invasion. However, looking at Corridor, its not needed. I\'ll explain.

Assuming the low to mid population worlds in Corridor are going to be relatively
easy prey to the Vargr, it only leaves the high population worlds to worry
about.
The high population worlds in Corridor are: Knouth (0104), Mikesh (0206),
Yubitty (0313), Irasumshu (0417), Drayne (0910), Shuskaka (1109), Durima
(1205), Kaasu (1209), Zudagim (1415), Khukish (1606), Ashima (1611), Plunge
(2505), and Uerrgno (2903) [I\'ve ignored the rimward worlds beyond the rift].How
did these worlds fall? The simplest to explain are Yubitty, Irasumshu, Zudagim
and Uerrgno, none of these have higher than TL7, they just can\'t fight back.
That
leaves nine high population worlds. A quick look at Knouth (atmos C), Mikesh
(atmos B), Durima (Hydro 0) and Plunge (hydro 0). None of these worlds have
any chance of feeding themselves, blockade them and they have to surrender.
You can probably say the same for Shushaka (hydro 2) and Ashima (Atmos 4,
hydro 3, TL A); though Shushaka might hold out for a while. So that leaves just
three worlds: Drayne (B6749C9-D, 8 billion), Kaasu (AA7A9CD-G, 9 billion) and
Khukish (A77A989-F, 8 billion). I\'ll look at these worlds individually.

Drayne: Hydro 4 its going to have a rough time surviving, things are going
to get
    unpleasant for the population. They see the worlds around them falling,
figure
    out which way the winds blowing, have no idea how long they are going to
have
    to hold out; so they cut a deal and join a Vargr faction (not sure if
thats the right
    word) for protection
Kaasu: Admittedly this is much harder to explain. They have high tech, what
on the
    face of it is a relatively friendly biosphere. However, they\'re right
next door to
    Shushaka, the atmospher is tainted and again they can see how things are
    going. It is not too unreasonable for this world to fall, I think.
Khukish: Allegence = Non-aligned, not \'Independent Vargr\' but \'Non-aligned\'.
this
    world has not fallen.

So there we have it, I think a fairly reasonable explaination why the high
population
worlds in Corridor fell. Only Kaasu is uncertain.

Looking at the worlds in Corridor another interesting fact comes out. Look
at the
Vilani worlds in The Narrows subsector. No less than eight Corsair bases on
Vilani
worlds!!! and seven of them have a Vilani naval base in the same system. I\'d put
penny to the pound that the Vilani supported the Vargr.

I have other Ideas regarding this, like how much of the losses suffered
during the
Fifth Frontier War had the Domain of Deneb replaced? How fast could the Vilani
bureacracy react to the Vargr threat? How willing would perceptive Vargr leaders
be to offering high tech human worlds (remember Vargr see humans as less
likely to worry about charisma) \'carrots\'? But this is long enough already.
Maybe
one day :*)

When I had the same problem last year. Now I have have a spreadsheet that
produces custom hull (Rate,Vol,MV,L) that are on the table(with some rounding).
even with rounding less then 100 tons produces errors of .3 more or less and
above 
20000 3-10 point errors are produced.

This was supplyed by angus.mclellan@almac.co.uk (ANGUS MCLELLAN)

I don\'t think that you can use a formula and get exactly the same values
as in the tables, due to rather iffy rounding. What I did was to use a
look-up table (this\'ll work in Excel or 1-2-3) laid out exactly like the
one in FFS and have the boxes for MV and Length filled in by getting the
hull rate value and matching it to the correct row in the table with a
column offset.

BTW, you are just as well to do it this way as you\'ll have to use this
(at least I can\'t think of an alternative) for the hull configurations.

If you want to discuss this further, please feel free to email me. If
you like, I could upload an example spreadsheet (either Excel 5 format)
 to an ftp site for you to download.

If you want to use a formula, you could try the following (guesses) :-

Starting value Hull Size in UCP Tonnes [rate]
Derive hull volume in cubic metres/kilolitres as [volume = rate * 14]
Assume a basic spherical hull form.
Calculate the radius of a sphere with the same volume as the hull by
cube root of [radius = cube root of {(volume * 3)/(pi * 4)}]
The basic hull [length = 2 * radius], rounding to the nearest 0.1
metres.
The surface area of the basic hull is [surface area = 4 * pi * radius *
radius].
Calculate material volume as [material volume = surface area / 100] (the
other way round than in FFS, but so what).

All values (except rate) are in metres, either linear, square or cubic
as appropriate.

If you want to be really clever, you could do similar things from
scratch for box, cylinder, cone, disk and slab hulls.

Apart from Aliens what has been published? Answer = Gizmos.
Why? Gizmos are very popular, people like them, people buy
them, it helps pay the startup costs, plus they are "cheap" Lots
of helpful low cost advice right here on the TML. (Okay so
enough of the cynic from me :*) )

However you are right, the delay is a big snafu; but I can see why
it happened. Limited staff rushing to get a \'perfect\' product out to
a tight deadline end up doing worse than if more time was
allowed. I\'ve seen it happen time and time again in the publishing
industry. Things get delayed a bit here, then a bit more there, a little
more somewhere else, then people start rushing and in rushing
end up going slower. Its especially prone to happening when a
new project or company is just starting up.

Sigh... It is ONE of our references for ship building and maintenance. Just
as we\'re also using _Striker_. "The rules" is anything published by GDW and
whatever else that is considered canonical. This works as long as the rules 
dosen\'t contradict themselves or the background or reality. When they do, we 
have to use our judgement.

Well, I\'m sorry I left my eidetic memory in my other pants. Remind me to 
apologize abjectly for my lack of omniscence when I\'m through being annoyed
over that remark. Are you claiming that we haven\'t been told that Vargr TLs
are maximum 13? If you are, I\'ll be happy to go home and dig out a proper
reference. Well?

Why don\'t you try assuming that we\'re having a meaningful discussion instead
of a petulant brawl. Much more rewarding for all concerned. I\'ve learned
things and had several good ideas through having this discussion. What about 
you?

Possibly, though given what we\'ve been told about Vargr societies ("All of
Vargr society is subject to twin forces  -  a centrifugal force bringing
small groups together and make them more cohesive, and a centripetal force
pushing the group apart. All of Vargr society is constantly pushed and
pulled by these twin forces." _Rebellion_ p. 62) such a world would most 
likely be balkanized. And if it isn\'t, it\'s leaders would be reluctant to
send off most of its navy to conquer a world that would most likely secede
the moment it got itself a sufficiently charismatic governor.

Yes, assuming that such a world exists, that it isn\'t balkanized, that it
lies sufficiently close to Mikesh for its leadership to expect to be able to 
retain control, that it really had used 70 % for offensive armament and only 
30% for defensive, and that it decided to act the moment it heard about the 
departure of the Corridor fleets, then it could capture Mikesh. But you\'re 
missing the point. Mikesh was merely the first high-population world I found 
in the Corridor listing, which is why I\'ve been using it as an example. 
There\'s nothing else special about Mikesh. Losing it to the Vargr is indeed 
possible; losing any single high-population world to the Vargr is possible, 
assuming the right combination of circumstances (Of course, the primary 
assumption (that a Vargr government with the required strength and astro-
graphical location would also have the desire to invade a high-population 
world) is a bit hard to swallow, but what the hell...). But there are half a 
dozen worlds in Corridor of the same strength level and another dozen that 
is too strong for any Vargr Corsairs (Which are the forces we\'ve been told 
invade Corridor). You need a separate uniques set of circumstances (each 
involving a Vargr state rather than Vargr Corsairs) to account for the 
defeat of each of these worlds. And when you\'re done with that, you still 
need to explain why Norris didn\'t interfere eventually.

- ----  Generic information. Please correct me if I\'m wrong.

Plasmas are ionisated gazes which density is lower at same pressure than
their non ionisated form. Plasmas can have different range of temperature,
the more heat it has, the more important is the rate of ionized gazes. For
example, at 16000 K, 98% of H2 is under plasma form.   

Thermonuclear reaction starts when the plasma has sufficient energy (Temp
and pressure) to overcome the electromagnetic forces that repluse the
protons. Temperature is around 10,000,000 K. The short range Strong force
frees massive energy which is used in fusion reaction.

I\'ve read that in an encyclopedia that ionospheres has a non negligeable
rate of plasma

Earth has a ionosphere less than 200K but in the meantine Saturn has a 1700K
plasma.

The most strange is Jupiter. Orbiting around it, there is a huge tore of
Plasma. The radius is 5 time Jupiter\'s one, and the tore section is around
the size of Jupiter diameter. This tore radiates lot\'s on radio waves.
Voyager I and II had taken some measurement of tis effect. In a 4 month span
the radiations had doubled and the temperature of the tore has fallen from
100,000K to 60,000K !!!

The situation if this tore in not hasard, it is heavily linked to the
presence of Io right iniside it. Io is mainly frozen sulfures (i think) with
a groud temperature around 150K. What i don\'t understand is why the plasma
tore hasn\'t heaten the Io athmosphere.

Obviously, there is a very low density of plasma in this tore. But what
would be the effect of a starship crossig this kind of plasma?



- ---- TNE questions

1- Heplar

As this propulsion device generates plasma (which has a relatively low
density), it has a better efficiency than some non ionized gases. right?

What is the temperature of such a propulsor. There is a picture in TNE, of a
Scout/courier flying just over the sea. The waves behind it seems to be
vaporised by the ship, indicating a very high temperature, assuming that the
ship flies at average speed (2000 kph).

Is this a correct interpretation? what are the effect on ground, especially
around cities and starports.


2- Plasma weapons. 

High energy weapon uses a chemical detonation to heat H2 to plasma state in
a magnetique bottle and frees it at high speed. The destructive agent is in
this case the temperature of the "plasma bullet". As the plasma weapion are
moved to fusion weapon, the temperature might be a least around 1,000,000 K.
So what is the average mass of super heated plasma which is projected with
small weapons? I assume that heavier weapon project more plasma mass.


3- Fusion rocket

Simple : Why the fusion rocket is radiactive? I thought fusion create no
radiations instead of fission


4- FFS - second edition

I\'ve got the fisrt one, can any body tell me the main differences between
the two releases of FFS.

By the way, I\'ve seens is some Web page (I don\'t have the reference but i
think it\'s the FFS second edition errata), that plasma and fusion small
weapons dammages where quite doubled. This seem to be very dangerous for
players. Even if the plasma weapon are extremely destrucive in their
conception, it is hard for a player to use it. I explain : There is no fun
to fire at an enemy, which is instantely dead when I hit him. 

And it\'s much harder for the GM. Last year, i\'ve mastered a ADD like RPG.
Characters where in forest where giants lives. They fought some giants (one
or two each time) with great diffiulites. At a time, i wnated them to go in
a precise direction. So i put 8 giants, they ran and the giants too (this
was big fun). As they weren\'t fool (they didn\'t attack the 8 giants) they
had good chance to succeed the evasion. Know think the Giants were Combat
robots with plasma weapon (glups!). The lives of the Characters cannot be
condition by a hit or not hit dice result. 

Could you tell me you opinion about thoses weapons. In which case did you
have great fun in using those weapons (either player or GM)?
Personnally, I\'m mastering a TNE adventure in a week, I won\'t use this kind
of destructive weapon.

It\'s usual for the Scouts to interdict primitive planets for their protection,
but that\'s only a rule of thumb. Besides, the rules are administered by 
people, and people sometimes makes mistakes (or are bribed) I don\'t know why 
Sorel is not interdicted; perhaps its society is of the rare kind that in the
opinion of some Scout Survey commander is stable enough to survive contact;
perhaps some event forced the contact and presented the Scouts with a fait
accompli. Perhaps the whole culture is nomadic. However, even though Sorel 
is in contact with interstellar society it could still (propably is) be under 
import restrictions. An Interdiction includes an embargo, of course, but the
reverse is not true.

Why is that? Luminosity is in bolometric so integrated over all

wavelength(?)
Greenhouse effect will make the planet cooler though. Greenhouse on earth
works as visible light goes through greenhouse gasses, heats ground and
bounces back as IR which greenhouse gasses trap. A planet with same gasses
would trap IR to the outside instead(?)

Doesn\'t chlorofyll require certain minimum energy photons to work? If soo
then it would be hard to make normal plants grow on such a planet. Also
note that M stars tend to be very old and their planets therefore lacking
in heavy elements necessary for life.

Hi, Andrew. Welcome to the list. You are a newcomer, aren\'t you? Thanks for
the quote. I don\'t know where I got the 5000 T limitation from and I
appreciate the correction.

The list went through this argument only the other week, Andrew ;-). Tax in
kind never went out of fashion, we merely developed money to facilitate the
process. You still pay your taxes in goods and/or labour. You just use money 
to keep score, but where did you get the money to pay the tax? That\'s right, 
you worked for it.

But a draft on Mikesh is worthless unless you can buy things on Mikesh and
ship them to whereever you are.

Sure, but not unless Mikesh first sell enough stuff to the Imperium to get
the Crimp-notes. Believe me, it is much simpler for Mikesh to pay its taxes
by building and maintaining ships for the Imperium.

I don\'t agree with that assumption. The high-medium population worlds (ie. 
population level 8) are also beyond the strength of the Vargr Corsairs. You 
still need Vargr governments to take them.

Why? You don\'t think that any high-population world would be dependent on
importing things like food, air and water? The logistics of doing so is
prohibitive. All of these worlds can feed themselves although they\'d run 
short on gourmet imports.

Same argument.

I have to disagree. They might take the opportunity to go independent and
carve out their own little pocket empires instead of cleaving to their
allegiance to the Imperium, but joining a Vargr Corsair alliance is a very
unlikely thing to do. Though they might allow some Vargr to join _them_, if
they decided to go independent.

>Khukish: Allegiance = Non-aligned, not \'Independent Vargr\' but \'Non-aligned\'.

True. But neither have they reestablished peace and trade with their close
neighbours despite having had three years to build up their navy.
 
>I have other Ideas regarding this, like how much of the losses suffered

Well, since it is sound sense to reactivate mothballed ships before beginning
new construction (1/10th the time and 1/10th the cost) and since Trin is still
reactivating ships in 1123 (See _Arrival Vengeance_), it is most likely that
the Domain has as many ships laid up as their budget allows. If we assume that
the Imperial worlds use 3% of GNP in peacetime and 15% in wartime, the moth-
balled navy could be 8 times as large as the peacetime navy.

A year?

What kind of carrot could a Vargr leader offer a world like Kaasu to get 
them to join him? Though the Vargr might be able to convince Kaasu to let 
_them_ join _it_! ;-)

I can\'t remember exact details, but the King Richard was (in my opinion)
built with a complete disregard for fuel requirements, space requirements,
etc.  As an example it is useless.  I was written after High Guard, but
there really weren\'t any good rules about deckplans then.

The adventure overall is pretty fun though, so don\'t pass it up if you can
find it.

P.s.  Douglas, you can have a rocket launcher, but just try to find
compatible rockets.

Right here... I have a couple of designs for ships I am converting to HTML
sometime... some were made with QSDS and some with SSDS.  Don\'t have any
deckplans or pictures outside of drawings I have made to put up yet tho.

and IMHO, Starships wasn\'t that bad, it was just way overpriced for the
amount of material covered....

Anyway, yeah I am in for a Net Ship Design System with materials to
accompany....

Not to blow my (our) own horn, but my own department has a good web page

www.pfc.mit.edu

Look for my Boss (Ian Hutchinson) on the Alcator pages!

Includes an explanation of Fusion, pictures and diagrams, spin-off
research (superconductin magnets, maglev technology, etc) and local
weather.

Oh, and if you are in the (Cambridge, MA) area and give me some advance
notice, you can get a tour of the facility on certain dates (including
Jan 16th coming up).

Incidentially, if you *are* in the area on January 15th you can attend
the seminar entitled "Tokamak Fundementals for Poets" (a tokamak is a type
of Fusion Reactor, toroidal in shape).

email or call for more details.

My understanding is that the Scouts generally recommend interdiction 
to shield a young or sensitive culture from the interference that 
interstellar trade and commerce will bring.

Sorel might have a older or robust culture.

Perhaps it\'s an enclave of former Glistenites that would rather do
without high technology and seek to return to a simpler way of life.

Perhaps the locals view high technology as a mere curiosity and
figure that they\'re way of life is better.

Perhaps it\'s some sort of holiday world that\'s kept barren of high
technology so that Glistenites and other inhabitants of the Spinward
Marches have a place to get away and enjoy nature. Of course, it
might cost Cr1,000s or Cr10,000s or Cr100,000 for the priviledge of 
visiting for a week or less.

Just a few thoughts.

I can\'t figure out when this write up is supposed to have been written.  The
mixed references to all three Imperia makes it hard to determine just when
the Guy-troy were first contacted, when the Imperium (which one?) decided to
destroy their culture, and how the Third Imperium figures into all this.

The situation is even more muddled by the last paragraph on pg 23 that has
Imperial intervention taking place 300 years ago!  If this is supposed to be
a M:0 book, it should have been a Sylean intervention..

So far, this is my only real problem with the book; although I would have
preferred having the full illustration of each race with its write up as
opposed to just the skeleton.

Construction times, TCS, in weeks:

Light cruiser (20000 d-ton)  == 174 weeks (87)
Heavy cruiser (50000 d-ton)  == 192 weeks (96)
Battleship    (100000 d-ton) == 208 weeks (104)

The times in parentheses assume that the ship isn\'t the first built in the 
class by the starport, double the yard capacity is assigned to it, and 20% 
extra of the unmodified ship cost is paid.  This allows (0.4+0.4+0.2) == 1
extra week of work of work to be completed every week, the maximum allowed.

[Any others are on the far side of the Rift.]

A quick rundown, with information collected from MTJ about what happened
with these worlds:

DURIMA fought off one attack in 1118, but fell between 1119 and 1120 despite
  support from Khukish.  Jump-4 from Khukish, Kaasu, and Shushaka; 7 parsecs 
  from Depot.  [I wouldn\'t think this would fall, but maybe they didn\'t have
  much of a defense fleet.  Seems unlikely.]
KAASU fought until 1119, when Marquis Jan Rehman negotiated a separate peace 
  with the Dzarrgh Federate.  Has allowed tech-16 equipment to fall into the
  hands of Vargr since then, but maintains some autonomy.  Jump-3 from Depot.
KHUKISH is free and holding, apparently without too much difficulty.  Jump-5
  from Depot, Kaasu, and Shushaka, jump-4 from Durima. 
We know nothing of SHUSHAKA, except that it\'s jump-1 from Kaasu, jump-4 from
  Depot, and appears to have fallen to the Vargr by 1120.  [Again, you\'d bet
  this would hold, even though the Vargr could use Kaasu to resupply.]
PLUNGE declared itself an open planet, and is involved in a very lucrative
  trade supporting the fleets of the Windhorn Alliance.
KHOUTH is too close to the Dzarrgh Federate border for safety, especially
  with its\' lower tech.  It\'s on the Denebian sector border, and on its own.
DRAYNE is jump-2 from Shushaka and jump-3 from Kaasu.
KIRAN is on the Denebian sector border.
DEMICK is jump-5 from Kaasu, Depot, and Shushaka.

Class-C.  At least, according to the pre-Rebellion sector files on the net
for Corridor.  I agree, you\'d think they\'d have *some* starship manufacturing
capability....

Finally, on Vargr technology and fleet strength, from _Vilani & Vargr_.  The
way the world generation tech level rules work, where the Imperium would have
three tech-15 worlds, the Vargr have one tech-13, one at 14, and one at 15.
This gives them a fighting chance against the Imperial reserves (tech-14 in
general) and mothballed ships pulled into service that the Corridor Fleet 
didn\'t reactivate to take with them (tech-13/14 in general).  In TCS, to
reactivate a ship in ordinary takes 10% of construction time; the Fleet had
plenty of time to reactivate most of the operable ships in the mothball 
fleet and take them with, assuming the shipyard capacity was available,
which is less than clear, and that they got started even a couple of months
after notification of the assassination.

Also, just around the Windhorn is Llaegharrgh, a Vargr high-population,
tech-16 world.  It\'s been involved in a brutal five year war, but enough
battle-seasoned corsairs left to join in that the war came to a temporary
standstill; these corsairs would be *extremely* dangerous.  They\'d be few
in number, I think.  [They\'re the capital of the Llaegharrgh Interactate,
and get a mention in DGP\'s Vilani and Vargr.]

We know the Dzarrgh Federate sent its\' regular navy into the fray.  It 
seems they\'re using the invasion as a common mission to hold their worlds
together.  The Irrgh Manifest sent so much of its\' fleet into Corridor 
that the Glory of Taazkhorn took over some of its\' worlds; the larger
part of the fleet ended up working for Noegzoel and her Windhorn Alliance,
and is chopping up Kaasu subsector.  The Glory was apparently heavily
hiring corsairs before the Rebellion, to launch a crusade against the
Manifest; after taking a handful of worlds, they called off the crusade
and are attacking Corridor instead.

Perhaps the Corridor government was only expecting corsair raids, not a
full-blown invasion by Vargr interstellar governments, but this seems
really dumb on their part.  I\'ll also note that for whatever reason, the
Imperium seemed to feel it *needed* two full numbered fleets in each
subsector in Corridor to defend from the Vargr threat -- if it was really
meant for use against the Zhodani, they would have been much more usefully
stationed at the Denebian depot.  I suspect that the Vargr also had a
*lot* more ships than would be normal -- after all, they need to defend
themselves against the massive Imperial threat in Corridor!  What if the
Imperium decided to widen the Corridor all the way to the Windhorn Rift,
to secure it against a natural barrier?  This thought can\'t be far from
the Vargr\'s minds.

Well, I haven\'t bothered to do the math, but it needs to come out quite hot
to get the specific impulse (fuel efficiency) that it does.  You probably
wouldn\'t want to be standing real close to one of those things, which is
why so many of us thought HEPlaR on grav vehicles in TNE was a Bad Idea.
That\'s part of why T4 gravitics don\'t just counteract gravity, but also
produce thrust.

To get the performance that is reported, it turns out that the exhaust
has to come off with absurdly dangerous relativistic velocities.  The
particles coming off the back may as well be cosmic rays, for all the 
kinetic energy they need to have.

An M0 V is a very low-mass, low-temperature, low-luminosity star on the
Main Sequence ("adult" stars still burning almost pure hydrogen in their
cores).  Such a star would be distinctly orange-yellow in appearance, a
color rather similar to an incandescent lightbulb on a dimmer switch
turned about 2/3 of the way down.

A lot of science fiction sources allege that type M stars would be a truer
red in color, like stoplight red, but this is inaccurate.  The best
picture of how an M0 V star might look from a habitable world circling it
might be obtained by visiting the coastline of Los Angeles on a smoggy,
hazy day, and looking at the sun -- dimmer, yellow-orange.  Such a star
would also likely be bigger (in angular size) in the sky of a habitable
world, as its lower temperature and luminosity would require such a world
to be *very* close in order to get enough warmth.

In turn, this requirement for proximity would in all likelihood result in
the world being tidally locked to the star -- either in 1:1 resonance like
the moon is with respect to the earth (i.e., one face always toward the
primary), or perhaps in 3:2 resonance like Mercury with respect to the sun
(three rotations per two orbits) if the planet\'s orbit is notably
eccentric.

That\'s correct.

Basically, yes, though as I said above, the color would be more of a faded
orange than a true red.

As for their age, M0 V stars are the longest-lived star types.  Being so
small (and thus having relatively less-dense, low-temperature cores), they
burn their hydrogen *very* slowly indeed.  IIRC, an M0 V has a projected
main-sequence lifetime of around 20 billion years.  In other words, all
the M0 V stars that have ever formed are still around today.

Needless to say, any *particular* M0 V could be young, old, or
middle-aged.

As I mentioned above, any world close enough to be habitable would almost
certainly be tidally locked.  Flares on a M0 V would probably not be much
of a problem; as you guess, they\'re fairly boring little things, just
quietly burning away their hydrogen, wondering if they\'ll live long enough
to see the Big Gnab... :)  There\'d be *very* little UV from an M0 V.

Here\'s a question for ya. Can a tidally-locked world be habitable (capable
of supporting life on its own with a "pleasant" and somewhat constant
temperature) at any given location on the planetary surface? I was under
the assumption before this discussion started that tidal-locking would
cause extremes of temperature. One side of the planet could be boiling,
and the other side would be frozen solid. Would a tidally-locked planet
be able to maintain its atmosphere? If not... then the possibility of
habitation is pretty much flushed down the toilet.

And that brings up another question. What percentage of M0 V stars are
first generation stars? If they are first generation, then they probably
won\'t have any rocky planets, just gas giants. Only 2nd generation and
later stars are likely to have planets rich in a variety of higher-order
elements. If the vast majority of M0 V are first generation, then this
is a major strike against them in terms of having habitable worlds.

    'body' => 'In T4, XP\'s must be spent immediately; they cannot be saved and
accumulated.  I would suggest that certain specially-earned XP\'s could be
saved and amassed.  I would call these "banked" XP\'s.  They would be spent
to increase a character\'s attributes or to allow a character to purchase a
new non-default skill.  

(Attributes):

A character could pursue a regimen of physical exercise to improve one of
his physical attributes (Str, Dex, or End); he could instead pursue a
regimen of mental exercise for Int or Edu, or a regimen of "social
exercise" (read, "conspicuous flaunting of wealth") for Soc.  This program
would be run on a week-by-week basis (as opposed to the month-by-month
basis stated in the book).  The PC would spend a number of weeks equal to
the attribute\'s current value before he begins to earn any "banked" XP\'s
for the attribute.  For each week thereafter, the PC has a chance to earn
*one* (1) XP specifically for *that* attribute being improved; this would
be a Difficult test of Athletics (for a physical exercise program),
Instruction (for a mental exercise program), or Carousing (for a "social 
exercise" program).  If the PC skips a week, the difficulty of next week\'s
test would be increased one level.  This penalty would be cumulative; if
the difficulty ever passed "Impossible", the PC would have to start over
(but keep any XP\'s already earned) by spending another period of one week
per point of the current value of the attribute.  Assuming the difficulty
doesn\'t pass "Impossible", each time he successfully makes this skill
check (and gets an XP), the level of difficulty will drop by one level
until it returns to the base level of difficulty ("Difficult").  
    Once the PC has accumulated a number of "banked" XP\'s equal to the
current value of the attribute, he may spend them (all of them) for a roll
of 1D, which is then compared to the attribute\'s current value (as with
improving skills).  Instead, he may continue to earn XP\'s so as to
increase his chance of success with the die roll (also as per skill
improvement).  
    (Example): A character with an Endurance of 7 begins a physical
exercise program to improve his stamina and health.  For the first seven
weeks, he earns no "banked" XP\'s.  Starting with the eighth week, if he
passes a Difficult test of Athletics, he earns one XP *specifically* for
his End.  Let\'s assume that some time later, as a result of an adventure,
he winds up in the hospital for two weeks.  When he resumes his exercise
program (after being discharged from the hospital), his skill check is
now "Staggering" instead of merely "Difficult".  Of course, he could
decide to spend another seven weeks of exercise without any skill check to
restore the level of difficulty that way.  

(New Non-Default Skills):

The entry for Instruction skill is somewhat vague (as opposed to the rules
on Instruction and New Skills in TNE) in that the length of time is
totally up to the GM\'s whim (no suggestions on which to base your
decisions at all).  I would suggest that a successful check of the
Instruction skill at the end of a week of classroom study or
"apprenticeship"-type on-the-job training result in the earning of *one*
(1) "banked" XP *specifically* for the skill being taught.  The PC would
need to accumulate ten (10) such XP\'s to buy the new skill at level-0. 
This number of XP\'s would be halved (down to five [5]) if the character
has a number of other skills that are closely related to the skill being
learned (say, four or more levels total).  This number of XP\'s would be
doubled (to 20) if the character had a complete lack of related other
skills.  
    (Example): The crew of a trader is teaching Astrogation to the new
kid.  Astrogation probably involves heavy use of Computer and Physics
skills.  If the new kid had Computer-3 and Physics-1 (four levels total),
he should need only five (5) XP\'s.  On the other hand, if he had
Computer-0 and no Physics skill, he should pay 20 XP\'s for Astrogation. 
Otherwise, he should pay the regular price of ten (10) XP\'s.  Once he buys
the skill (Astrogation-0), he would then treat it as any other "default"
skill (he could use JOT for it; he can buy it at level-1 for two [regular]
XP\'s; etc.).  

(Purpose):
This suggested variant will result in the players having more control over
the "growth" of their characters.  It will also make attribute improvement
and the acquisition of non-default skills more in line with the theory
behind career generation (that the characters were working while they were
earning their skills and attribute modifications; they were not just
"chained to a desk", like the existing rule for getting new skills
demands).  

I would appreciate your comments.  

Thanks.

T::>I have a couple of questions:

T::>I saw in the book World-Building (Gillett, S.) that the size of a planet (or

 ::> What is the formula I need?

 This is called the "small angle approximation".  It works
 primarily because sin x and tan x are within epsilon of each
 other for small x.  Note that the multiplication by 57.3 is to
 convert radians to degrees.  I\'ll discuss my work below in
 radians; just remember to do the multiplication by 57.3 at the
 end if you want degrees.

 The derivation of the correct formula takes some diagrams that
 ASCII isn\'t suitable for, but which I was able to accomplish
 fairly easily on paper.  Skip the next few paragraphs if they
 stop making sense.  The critical info is marked with "|" down
 the right margin.

 To make the calculation correctly, you actually need the
 distance not to the pole of the planet you are viewing, but to
 the limb, or edge of the image.  For small planets, or planets
 at great distance, these are close enough together when
 compared to the distance to the planet\'s center that you can
 ignore the difference.  This is where the small-angle
 approximation comes in, and is quite useful.

 When the difference becomes significant, you have to base your
 measurements on the limb rather than the pole.  Unfortunately,
 you only have the distance to the center of the planet.  So,
 you have to derive the limb distance.

 If you diagram it out, you will see that the line from the
 center of the planet to the limb of your observation is
 perpendicular to the line from you to the limb of your
 observation.  (The latter is a tangent to the planet; radii are
 always perpendicular to tangents at the point where the
 tangent, circumference, and radius all meet.)  This makes
 things easy now, because you know the distance from you to the
 other planet, and you know the radius of the other planet.  By
 squaring both and taking the difference, you know the square of
 the distance to the limb, and by taking the square root of
 that, you know the distance.  Now, there is a right triangle
 formed by the distance to the other planet (d), the radius of
 the other planet (r), and the distance to the limb
 (sqrt(d^2-r^2)).  It turns out that the distance to the limb,
 when divided by d, gives you the cosine of _half_ the angle
 that the planet subtends.  Simply take the arc cosine of that
 number, and double the result to get the subtended angle in
 radians.  So, this is a better approximation for large angles:
             ___________
        -1 \\/ d^2 - r^2           d=distance to target planet  |
 2 * cos   ----          r=target planet radius       |
                 d                                             |
                                                               |
 It\'s correct if you\'re at the center of your planet.          |
 Unfortunately, if you have to use this formula, you probably  |
 need to take your own position on your planet into account.   |
                                                               |
 Now, this is where it gets hairy.  You need to know your      |
 latitude (L), the target planet\'s declination (D), and your   |
 planet\'s radius (R).  I don\'t think I can explain it without  |
 resorting to a diagram that simply can\'t be done in ASCII, so |
 I\'ll skip the derivation, and simply tell you that instead of |
 using "d" in the above formula, you need to use               |
   __________________________________                          |
 \\/ (d-R*cos(L-D))^2 - (R*sin(L-D))^2     d is center-to-center|
                                            distance to target |
                                            (same as before)   |
                                                               |
 for both occurrences of d in the first formula.  This formula |
 is correct, and as accurate as your figures for the indicated |
 variables.                                                    |

 I think you\'d better plug this into your programmable
 calculator, or spreadsheet program.  It\'s not what I would
 consider pencil-and-paper math; the derivation certainly
 wasn\'t, even though I did it that way.

 Well, I tend to be a bit more conventional, in the Western
 sense.  The big problem I have with common freshers is what I\'d
 said in my previous post - Joe Shlabotnick (Joe Bftsplk is his
 cousin) is _not_ going to want to go digging for a robe (to be
 "decent" - he sleeps raw) at 0300, and then find that there\'s a
 line out by the freshers.  Private, or at worst, shared (2
 cabins, one fresher) freshers are sort of a must.  And even
 shared is IMO going to reduce the price that the line can
 command for the cabin, all else being equal.

T::>Still, I tend to design ships with more conventual quarters. <g>

T::>>  ...the typical cabin on a cruise ship...is 150-200 square feet

T::>Those would be the equivalent of Large Staterooms:  4m x 4m, about 13ft x

 But that\'s just it - the figure I gave was the actual size for
 current seagoing ships.  Certainly these can be double
 occupancy - but there _aren\'t_ any smaller.  When you look at
 the QE2, you\'ll see _larger_, though.

T::>I have 4 passenger levels:

T::>1st Class - luxury accommodations, 6 to 8 tons of space, 1/2ton
 ::>            baggage.

 Yes, this would be OK for high passage.

T::>2nd Class - standard accommodations, 4 to 6 tons of space, 1/4ton
 ::>            baggage.

T::>3rd Class - modest accommodations, 2 to 4 tons of space, 1/8ton
 ::>            baggage.

 The 4td figure is the lowest I\'d go for either of these as Mid
 passage, especially if I have to take out up to 50% of this
 allocation for public areas and freshers.

T::>4th Class - cold passage, 1 ton of space, 1/8ton of baggage.

T::>I\'ve designed standard deckplans for several types of quarters:

T::>SINGLE CABIN - 2.5x3m (1.875dt), is very workable for a single 2nd class
 ::>passenger or junior Officer.  The room is cramped, but the resident would
 ::>spend less time there than at work stations or in commons areas.  It
 ::>includes a fold down twin bed on one wall.  On the wall at the foot of the
 ::>bed is a wall terminal for entertainment and/or work.  When the bed is up,
 ::>a table can be folded down just below the terminal, exposing a data entry

 ::>closet/storage space (ship rules on lockability).  There is also room for a
 ::>fold down (or recessed) mini sink and toilet.  A communal Fresher is down
 ::>the corridor.

 Again, we have the common fresher problem.  If you\'re booking
 passage on a ship that is primarily in the cargo transport
 business, _maybe_ this is acceptable.  For a designed passenger
 ship, I wouldn\'t find this acceptable.  It\'s also just
 marginally below what the rules (which I have been interpreting
 as Imperial minima) would permit for a mid passenger.

T::>SMALL STATEROOM - 3x3m (2.25dt), is a slightly larger version of the Cabin.
 ::> A double bed that folds out from a small sofa makes this the cabin of
 ::>choice for 1st class passengers on smaller ships, 2nd class frugal couples
 ::>on larger ships, or ship\'s Officers.

 Again, the common fresher problem rears its head.  It\'s legal
 in my Imperium, barely, but it wouldn\'t be a high seller.  It
 makes a _very_ nice _single_ room, with a twin bed, however.
 Much like the nice rooms the Resident Assistants got in the
 colleges I have attended.

T::>PAIRED CABINS - 6x3m (4.5dt, 2.25/cabin) A pair of Cabins share a small
 ::>Fresher located between them.  The accommodations of each cabin are similar
 ::>to the Single Cabin.  This arrangement is very acceptable for higher ranked
 ::>crew quarters, or for 2nd or 3rd class passengers.

 This is better than the single cabin, as the fresher problem is
 pretty much alleviated.  I could accept this as mid passage off
 the Mains.  I\'ll admit to having had two people, two desks and
 chairs, and two closets in something not much bigger than one
 of these cabins.  But see my comment about college RAs above.

T::>PRIVATE BUNKS - 2x2.5m (1.25dt) Smaller version of the Single Cabin, with a
 ::>chest (rather than a closet) for storage.  These rooms are for 3rd class
 ::>passengers and crew.

 No. This is just plain too small.  My Imperium\'s regulations
 wouldn\'t allow paying passengers to be put in one of these (2dt
 minimum for mid passage).  Single dorm rooms in every college
 I\'ve attended have been bigger than this.

T::>LARGE STATEROOM - 6x3 (4.5dt) These suites include a fully
 ::>functional private fresher.  They feature a queen sized bed, a pair of
 ::>comfortable chairs, entertainment and work terminal, a dressing table and
 ::>closet space.  These luxury suites are reserved for 1st class passengers
 ::>and high ranking Officers.

 Yes. This would be minimally acceptable as high passage off the
 mains; up the opulence and it might become a _single_ high
 passage on the mains.  Push it to 6td and it would be
 acceptable as high passage, single or double, on all but the
 most luxurious of luxury liners - the equivalent of 1st Class
 on the QE2, for example.

T::>Most of the space is in the commons areas.  You need to think about such
 ::>things as Galleys, Wardrooms, Dining Halls, Lounges, Game Rooms,
 ::>Gym/workout Rooms, Conference Rooms, Sickbays, etc, etc, etc!

 Yes, I realize that - but what this exercise has shown me is
 that the rules as written are very nice for designing your
 military ship, which is attack/defense oriented, or your free
 and far traders, which are cargo-oriented - but not for
 designing passenger-oriented ships.  I suspect that the same
 problems would show up in the yacht and lab ships as well.

     fully detailed, but it is a start. From the comments coming out of

FF&S, pg 14: one standard worksation (7 m^3) ...

    , pg 47: work & crew stations. Basically 14 m^3 on the bridge, 7 m^3
most else where, with a \'cramped\' crew station of 2.5 m^3 or \'open\' crew
station of 3.5 m^3. I think the last two describe things like fighter
cockpits or turrets.

The Founder 5000 is design to move large carges over protroled
intersteller shipping lanes.  As such it has been designed with no
Weapons or Armour because they take up needed cargo space.  Though it
can be used with out a Lightering companin ship it is not ment to be
thus the low G rating.  The ship relies on the advance controls to
reduce the crew to 23 (3 Command 2 Manuver 4 Electronics 5 Maintance 9
Enginnering). Though the ship has a triple redunet powersystem.  Even
if the ship loses 2 of its power sources the life support is still
active.  It carries an optional 2 Launch on docking rings.

     I\'ve said this before but...
     
     I want the IG site to have a Traveller News Service! Starting at date 
     001-0000, and stepping forward in time at a rate of perhaps 1 game 
     year per (real-time) month or so. An \'official\' news service is one of 
     the things I miss from the old issues of JTAS and Challenge, and 
     (cynically) it provides a simple way for IG to maintain interest in 
     their product line. 
     
     Perhaps eventually there could be one TNS per Milieu, perhaps like so: 
     
     Milieu Zero: starting 001-0000
     Pacification Campaigns: starting 001-0076
     Vargr Campaigns: blah
     Aslan Border Wars: blah
     Civil War: blah
     Psionics Suppressions: blah
     ....
     Classic Era: starting 001-1105
     Rebellion Era: starting 001-1116
     New Era: starting 001-1200
     
     IG might want to just reprint the old JTAS and Challenge TNS items for 
     Classic, Rebellion and New Eras - a way of keeping the old die-hards 
     at least partially on board with little effort. 
     
     I have also suggested that list members and other fans could write 
     news items (helps take the workload off IG); they could then be 
     filtered, vetted, edited etc. and then posted as \'official news\'! 
     
     Another suggestion: IG could periodically post a few scenarios to 
     their web site, (maybe authored in the same way as the TNS items), as 
     a way of providing ongoing game support and rewarding those gamers 
     that keep in touch!

I just tried it and it worked fine, it looks like a good start at redoing

        HEPlaR thruster is basically a MPD thruster. The expellant
        is turned to plasma in order to accelerate it with electro-
        magnetic fields, and all energy used to ionize the expellant
        can usually to be considered as wasted.

        The temperature will be as low as possible, and the exhaust
        will likely to be "cool" plasma. (What is the minimum
        temperature of liquid hydrogen turned to plasma?)

        Note that if you examine the values given in FFS (HEPlaR power
        input and mass flow), a trivial calculation shows that the
        generated thrust should be only 10.1 kg, not 20 tons.

        True. At close range HEPlaR thruster resembles plasma welder or
        continuous fire plasma gun.

        Plasma weapons were not documented well enough to give clear
        answers to any of those questions.

        Some of the FFS formulas assumed that plasma weapon was solely
        a kinetic energy weapon (all the energy released in one shot
        was used to calculate the recoil), but I would like to suggest
        that the plasma weapons are both kinetic and heat effect weapons.

        (Possibly 50/50 split between both energy types, assuming 6000
        m/s plasma stream velocity, kinetic damage as projectile weapon
        and heat damage as laser, using pilot laser to make a "hole" or
        "path" in atmosphere and releasing plasma stream along to this
        path... Brake. Cold shower.)

        If there is enough interest in this subject, I could make some
        calculations and design rule suggestions how these weapons might
        work. However the above text already contains too may assumptions
        and no real-world data.

> 3- Fusion rocket
>
> Simple : Why the fusion rocket is radioactive? I thought fusion create no

        Fusion rocket is basically a heat-effect rocket which uses
        fusion reactor to heat the expellant material and releases
        the expellant as exhaust jet. If the expellant is used as
        direct reactor coolant, the exhaust could be radioactive. If
        the reactor uses proper heat-exchanger, the exhaust will not
        be radioactive.

        (While I was studying Space Technology, I relieved some boredom
        by comparing real-world space propulsion systems and Traveller
        thrusters and made a Traveller FAQ on the subject. However I
        haven\'t been able to access the Beta list fo a long time, so I
        dropped the project.)

Sun is not in this state, It is just after (He acculmulation in the Kernel),
so it size is a little bigger (10% of increase)

Class V stars start burning H in the kernel (most of its life span) and
accumulates He. Radius is slowly increasing. He kernel contracts as radius
increase, H starts burning around the He kernel, R increase to 50 time the
initial radius (red giant). As internal temp is at 10^8K, He fusion in the
Kernel (Helium flash) and the size reduce (not a red giant). As He fusion
products (C, O...) are stable in the kernel, the star is again a red giant.
Finaly, the enveloppe quit the star and become a planetary nebula as the
kernel become a white dwarf.

Very true you would. This is how I\'d see things going:
First - Vargr corsairs have always raided Corridor, so when the
   fleets up and leave they keep raiding and find the fleets are gone.
Second - With the fleets gone, corsair activity steps up meeting
   more success (note the corsairs only attack the low pop worlds)
Third - One of the Vargr interstellar gov\'ts over the border decides
   to take a risk and invade (why? large Vargr gov\'ts are unstable
   and their leaders need ***lots*** of charisma, this is a gamble
   on getting charisma).
Fourth - This pays off, more gov\'ts follow, more sucess (note a
   few Vargr sucesses can offset a disproportonate amount of
   other Vargr\'s failures), more invasions etc.
How fast could this happen? I\'m not sure, looking at the info
published on the Vargr I\'d guess pretty darn quickly.

Just looking for plausable explainations :*). My guess (and it is just
a guess) is that these worlds didn\'t feed themselves (not couldn\'t,
just before the rebellion they just choose not to invest the resouces
on artifically creating an agircultural biosphere).

Ashima is a fairly marginal chance for survival with it\'s low tech and

You\'ve got the worlds around you falling left right and centre;
The Imperium is ripping itself apart, the two human states which
could help you have given up (for whatever reason), a sizable
interstellar Vargr state offers you protection and some degree of
autonomy. I\'d say it plausable.

Because three years is not enough time. Not only do you have
to build (or reactivate) the ships, but you have to find crews for
them, train the crews and then familarise the crews with their
ships. I\'d say four years minimum to do that. I know the obvious
reply is "reservists", but reserves take time to activate, still need
retraining and your not going to do better than double you standing
forces with reseves. Reserves provide the cadre\'s to build your
new force around.

That would seem make sense wouldn\'t it? but would it happen.
Look at the US navy. After the First and Second World Wars they
had massive numbers of mothballed ships. Why? because
during the Wars they built far far more than they needed in
peace, so they stored them. Eventually they got scrapped
(the last of the Second World War ones went in the late 80\'s)
Did they get replaced? No. The USN is now deactivating the
bulk of its intial post war build (50\'s and 60\'s), are these ships
going into reserve? No. Why not? They\'re worn out, they\'re
obsolete (the war built ships were not at the time). Of the
six Forrestral and Kitty Hawk class carriers being
decommisioned now or in the very near future only one is going
into reserve! These ships would be perfectly servicable in a war.
The thirteen cruisers? none are going into reserve, the frigates
and destroyers? maybe twenty. The worlds other major navies
(RN, Russia, France, Canada etc) are even worse. At best the
reserve fleet is going to be 20% to 50% of the peacetime fleet.
Why? Navies don\'t build ships just to put them in reserve. The
FFW was not big enough or long enough (it only lasted two and
a half years) to have prompted the kind of building program
that would give a huge reserve.

Hey, great. What a huge job...

Using FFS, i\'ve noticed three things

1- The jump drive volume depends on jump perf (you\'ve taken the wrong cell
(G-rating))

2- The formula for the jump fuel is in FFS    
              JD volume*5 
      for a max jump. In you sheet it seems to be different.

3- The workstation for the turret and barbette are already installed in the
component. So you don\'t have to count them for the gunners.

Go ahead and post them. I\'m sure some of us are twisted enough to find
a way to use them. :-)

BTW, which superman is this? The one from the mid 70s who could move
planets? The one from the 80s, who was still pretty powerful, but
wasn\'t up to moving planets? The Brunner rewrite who can\'t even fly
FTL? Or the current one?

As far as stealing ideas from comics, I find that works better in
FRPGs.  We were able to drop in Green Lantern (a pair of artifacts),
The Incredible Hulk (a mage/alchemist who made this slight goof :-),
and many others.

For SFRPGs, it\'s more fun stealing things from 30s, 40s & 50s SF. For
instance, the Lensman and Skylark series. Or some of John W. Campbell\'s
stuff. 

Picture your typical players making contact with a civilization that
has Lensmen. :-)

Types A and F are *white*, not green. O and B are "bluewhite".
Remember, this is black body radiation, so it\'s a spread out over a
*lot* of wavelengths, just distributed on a curve.

To get the same *visual* brightness, you\'ll need to be closer.
Remember, the radiation is spread out over a curve. The peak wavelength
shifts with the temperature. We are evolved so that our eyes are most
sensitive to the "yellow-green" part of the spectrum. This means that
our visual sensitivity is centered around the peak in the radiation
given off by the sun (a G type star).

A type M star is much cooler, and the peak is in the red, if not clear
down in the IR. So when you have the same amount of energy (area under
the curve) in the visible portion of the spectrum, you\'ll have much
*more* energy in the IR.

This is easy to show with diagrams, but hard to describe without them.
But it *is* true. 

Just remember that for people "brightness" mean "visible spectrum". But
for *heat* you have to count visible *plus* IR, plus any UV that can
penetrate. And the balance is different for different spectral types.

Depends. The part of the atmosphere that does the absorbing is
important. If it\'s water vapor, which is a major greenhouse gas and
tends to be restricted to the *lower* atmosphere, then you are heating
the air, so it doesn\'t help.

Remember, the greenhouse gases *absorb* the IR, not *reflect* it!

Chlorophyll is green because it absorbs (and uses!) the *red* portion
of the spectrum, leaving only yellow, blue, and green to reflect. It
won\'t do very well with long wave IR, but it may be able to use some
shortwave IR, as well as the plentiful red.

Native plants will tend reflect even a good part of the red as well as
the longer wavelengths. I\'m not certain, but I think that\'d make the
leaves look almost white to us. This is assuming that there\'s a
compound that can work well with IR. If not, then they\'ll use
chlorphyll or something similar.

True enough. But M stars of *similar* ages to Sol (give or take a
billion years) *will* have the heavy elements. Planets without them
will be *really* different.

Some type M dwarfs are pretty boring. Others emit enough radiation at

It *is* Io\'s atmosphere. Io is extremely volcanic and the gases from
eruptions easily reach orbital velocity and even escape velocity.
That\'s what forms the torus. Think of it as being Io\'s ionisphere
wrapped around Jupiter because of the orbit.

It\'s a lot thinner than the lower atmosphere so the heating is minimal.
Instead think of it as Io "sweeping up" the gases in front of it as it
orbits.

Not much. It makes more sense to treat it as a region of high particle
*radiation* (like Earth\'s Van Allen belts, only worse). High energy
electrons are the main hazard as it\'s not *too* likely that the buclei
would be at high energies.

Plasma densities can be pretty high. The sun is almost entirely plasma
from the visible surface to the core. And at the core, that plasma is a
lot denser than *water*.

The efficiency is due to the *temperature* (and possible to partial
fusion of the fuel).

Not that there are "plasma arc" torches used for some types of high
temp welding, cutting, and coating work. They use plasmas that are
dense enough to displace air...

At 2000 kph, the ship will leave one hell of a wake just from the shock
cone! As it is travelling supersonic, it is generating a conical shock
front (the angle of the cone is determined by the ratio of the ship\'s
speed to the speed of sound). 

At that sort of speed a shock cone involves pressure differences high
enough to cause major *structural damage* to buildings. The US Air
Force academy had to replace twisted *I-beams* in some of the
dormitories when someone in a t-34 trainer made a mach 1.5 pass too low.

So there will be a parabolic "wake" where the shock cone meets the
surface of the water.

The exhaust temp is determinable from the following...

Multiply the specific Impulse by 9.8 m/s^2 to get the exhaust
velocity. This plus the average molecular weight of the exhaust, and
the efficiency of the nozzle will let you calculate the temperature of
the exhaust.

But you also need to consider that the thrust divided by the specific
impulse gives the fuel flow rate (in mass units per second). 

So take the exhaust temp and figure out *how much* mass at that temp is
being ejected every second. That\'ll give you an idea of how much *heat*
can be transferred. And the exhaust velocity also gives you some idea
as to how fast the exhaust "spreads" (the higher the velocity, the
longer it takes).

> Is this a correct interpretation? what are the effect on ground, especially
> around cities and starports.

Me, I say that between the high velocity and high temp, along with the
low mass flow, you get the effect of a very long narrow jet that will
burn through anything that gets in the way. 

For a horizontal takeoff or landing craft, this just means you make
sure that there\'s nothing you care about, or a whole bunch of rock,
gravel and dirt behind you when you takeoff and at the start of your
landing. 

For vertical takeoff or landing it\'s a bit different.

So on the bare rock of an un-improved port, it\'ll splash a bit at first
as you approach, causing the rock surface to fuse over a circular area
centered on the jet. As you get closer it should be concentrating more
of the jet on the center, and starting to vaporise the rock, and then
burn a hole into it. So assuming you come straight down, you\'d have a
glazed area centered on each jet, with a hole in the middle. The
glazing around the edges would be badly cracked as it cooled.

Your ship\'s landing legs would be arranged to avoid "splashback" from
the ground. So you could lower the ramp pretty quickly. Or launch an
air raft immediately.

At more advanced port installations, there\'d be "blast pit" to avoid
having the exhaust hit anything until it had a chance to cool a bit.
Where water is cheap, they\'ll use some sort of water deluge system in
the pit to help absorb the heat and prevent damage to the lining. In

Nope. The easier to accomplish types of fusion tend to produce a lot of
extra neutrons. And even if they don\'t, the exhaust consists of high
velocity electrons, protons (hydrogen nuclei), deuterium,
tritium Helium-3 and helium-4 nuclei.  So it sort of counts as a badly
focused particle beam...

Well, a lot depends on the population and goverment codes. After all,
it could be a bunch of Buddhists who consider the world to be an
illusion and have no desire for material goods.

More to the point, at such low tech levels, if the population is low,
small amounts of trade won\'t really hurt anything. The traded items
will either be equivalent to local items, if of unknown materials
(pots, pans, etc). Or they will be "magic" (flashlights, radios,
medicines). 

"Magic" fits into a low tech society without hurting anything. So what
if a few people have "magic lights" that they got by trading with the
"sky people". Does that *change* the culture or the technology? Nope.

thank you for clarifying my bit about brightness.
I concede the point about white leaves. may help with the heat problem.

I read somewhere there is a minimum energy so I\'m not sure about using the IR, but there are alo rumours that chlorophyll developed from an IR detector for deep sea organisms that live near \'Black Smokers\'.

is there a biologist in the house?


on the point about HEPLaR drives, why not use ducted fans/(propellers?) instead? With a pocket fusion plant you have a year\'s range without refueling.

To get the same thrust the ducted unit might be expensive, but is safer than the plasma torch. So performance might drop, but once you\'re out in the country and away from other traffic, you can always kick in the afterburner.

Only vac to v.thin would need an alternative, and hydrogen might be awkward or restriced on these planets. 

it just doesn\'t have quite the same feel to it, for combat.

Fusion creates excess neutrons (and hence neutron radiation).  The Fusion
setups around my area are in blockhouses of concrete.  The advantage of
Fusion over Fission is that Fusion does not create *persistant* radiation
or radioactive waste.  Emissions are only present when the reactor is
active, turn it off and its like turning off a lightbulb, no more
emissions.  

The high point of our safety briefing was the \'cold fusion\' test rig they
set up at one point.  They set it up inside a concrete blockhouse to
isolate the expected neutron radiation.  Thing is it turns out that the
chemicals used are much more dangerous as caustic agents than any
emissions from that source are likely to be.

Now another question, if you please:

The planet (moon) is orbiting the gas giant on the equatorial plane (with 0 
degrees tilt - perhaps because it is tidally locked - one orbit=1 day).  The 
gas giant has a 25 degree axial tilt.  This also helps with the sticky 
problem of having solar eclipses every day for a few hours, because the gas 
giant won\'t block the sun every day around noon.  Actually, it just reduces 
the frequency of eclipses.  I think I would get daily solar eclipses around 
the vernal and autumnal equinoxes (gas giant\'s), right?

How would I calculate when the eclipses would occur and for how long?

Thanks,

Armand

(By the way, I calculated that the gas giant would be 27.89 degrees wide in 
the sky of one hemisphere.  Thanks to everyone who offered their help with 
the math!)

assume the shadow for the GG comes back straight. It would actually have a small region of partial shadow because the star isn\'t a point.
now assume that at the distance of the moon, there is a big projection screen.

The GG shadow is then a nice disc, of radius 27.89/2 =b 
the moon comes in at height 25sin(2pi t/T) = a
 and velocity 2pi R(orbitof moon)/T(orbit of moon)

the width of shadow to cross is 2R(GG) sin(pi/2 (b-a)/b)
		so that a=b, the moon just clips the shadow, so has zero width,
		and at a=0 has maximum width

so the duration of the eclipse is width/velocity.

this assumes the moon is a point, and the radius of orbit is large compared to the gas giant.

for non- point like moons, the angular width of the moon is \'c\'
fo a latitude on the moon, the \'height\' is c.sin(latitude). modify b by this amount to find the correct height.

this\'ll give you how long.

eclipses should be centred at local noon, for the point in the centre of the hemisphere facing the GG. it\'ll sweep across at approx the velocity just calculated

if you realy want detail, work out the angular radius of the star. on my imagined projection screen, measure that distance bothin and out from the disc edge. that ring is partial eclipse
if you\'re outside the ring, no eclipse

Except that the chamber is slowly absorbing neutrons and becoming
radioactive.  It\'s not very radioactive, but eventually your fusion
reactor site will all become low-level radioactive and need to be
disposed of somehow.  A professor I worked for joked about building
a fusion reactor in a valley in West Texas, running several years of
tests on it, then filling in the valley with concrete.  ;)

Not in Traveller.  The Ve = g * Isp equation barely works for HEPlaR and
fails utterly for fusion rockets because their exhaust velocity turns out
to be relativistic, and that\'s a Newtonian equation.  (In the past, this
has resulted in people crying "Fusion rockets in Traveller are broken;
the exhaust goes faster than light!")  :)  It works for real-life rockets,
because they have much slower exhaust velocities.

I believe that the corrected equation should be something more like

[1]  Ve = (9.8 * Isp) / gamma 

     where gamma = 1/Sqrt[1-(Ve^2/c^2)]
       and c = 299792458 meters per second (lightspeed)
       and Ve is exhaust velocity in meters per second,
           Isp is specific impulse in seconds.

[2]  Ve * gamma = (9.8 * Isp) 

     is useful to get all the Ve terms on the same side here.

Based on the fuel consumption figures given in the T4 rules, I found
the specific impulse (Isp) of fusion rockets and HEPlaR drives.  I
also made calculations for thrusters as if they were reaction drives,
using the fuel consumption of a fusion plant at the tech level of
introduction needed to power the thrusters.  I got the following
results:

Specific Impulse
- ----
Fusion Rocket:  1.46 10^8 seconds
HEPlaR:         4.11 10^6 seconds
Thruster:       1.2  10^11 seconds (effective)

Compared to an Isp of 450 seconds for the shuttle, or maybe 3000 for
a NERVA rocket, an Isp measured in days is pretty scary.  It is, however
necessary for the background to look the way it does.  If you want to
play like NASA, you need to stay at tech-8 and below; and most of the
hardware in current operation is only tech-7.  The first stage of a 
Saturn V is arguably only tech-6.

Exhaust Velocity
- ----
Fusion Rocket:  2.93 10^8 m/s = 0.97875 c = gamma of 4.88
HEPlaR:         3.96 10^7 m/s = 0.13320 c = gamma of 1.01
Thrusters:      effectively c (gamma of about 3920)

Let me say again.  You *don\'t* want to be standing too close to one of
these things.  :)

A) relative number of stars in each luminosity class (Ia to white dwarf)

and

B) for each luminosity class, the relative number of stars in each 
   of the spectral classes (O to M). 

I\'ve downloaded the latest version of Gliese catalog, but I\'m a little
reluctant to start trudging through it, both because of its daunting
length, and because for many entries, only the spectral class and the
actual luminosity are offered, and although I suppose it would be possible
to consult the tables in my much-abused copy of "C.T. Book 6: Scouts" to
tentatively assign these entries to one luminosity class or another, doing
so would require a lot of time and energy, and I\'d hate to expend it
trying to re-invent the proverbial wheel.  Thanks, very much, in advance.

  A small contra-grav vehicle sport and racing vehicle designed by Vargr
corsairs for maximum speed and strike capability.  The cargo is carried in
a small compartment forward of the pilot\'s seat, and can be used to mount a
light machinegun or similar weapon.  Weapons mounted can be controlled by
the pilot, but usually can only be used to fire forward.
  Like most Vargr designs, the Ouluekou (Howling Fury) jet-bike is a
mechanic\'s 
nightmare.  Its Turbofan engine generates more thrust than the airframe is
built to handle, and so it tends to suffer from accelleration stress and
metal fatigue over its operational life, increasing the wear and
maintenance required.  Still, it is popular among Vargr corsairs, who favor
it for the sheer terror that squads of jetbikes can generate.  It also
enjoys a certain popularity among humans who enjoy racing dangerous
vehicles.

  Another vehicle designed for the suicidal, the Souzghourroar  ("Fiery
Death") 
jetbike is optimized for maximum speed.  Like the Ouluekou jetbike, its
cargo area is located just forward of the pilot\'s controls and is just
large enough to mount a light support weapon such as a machinegun or plasma
gun.  Any weapons are limited in firing to the forward arc.
  The Fiery Death jetbike (the name is probably a mistranslation) is often
more 
dangerous to the pilot than to anyone else.  It is better designed than the
Ouluekou, and so does not suffer from the same levels of accelleration
stresses and metal fatigue, but the engines are still the same Vargr
designs, requiring frequent maintenance.  Due to its smaller cargo
capacity, it is less popular among corsairs than its predecessor but is
still popular among racing enthusiasts.

Sounds fine.  And remember folks, if you\'re unfamiliar with SSDS and 
would like to make an entry into the contest using that design system, 
then drop by IRC channel #traveller on Thursday, where Allen Shock will 
be doing a walk-through of the system.  For details on how to get to 
#traveller, when to be there, and so on, email suzd@goodnet.com

There\'s no clear-cut answer, as far as I know, due to the fact that
our observations of nearby stars are somewhat lacking, but back about
a year ago, I was looking into this question and came up with a bit of
data which you might find useful.

Check out http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~jimv/rag.html and go down to the
mailing list archives where are there. The last two (dated from
02-Dec-95 to 20-Mar-96 & from 20-Mar-96 to 14-May-96) contain
information pertaining to this question which you might find useful.

A few years ago, I asked this question of a planetary scientist who 
was giving a lecture on Venus at Boskone.  He talked about how very 
slow air circulation was on Venus, and how slowly the planet rotated 
with respect to the sun, but that temperatures were still very 
uniform all over the planet.  I asked if air circulation would then 
be sufficient to moderate temperatures on an otherwise Earthlike 
one-face world.  He felt it very likely.

So I expect that some oneface worlds could have reasonable belts of 
habitability between a hot pole and a cold one.

For these and many other star-system design questions, I strongly recommend
you check out the wonderful Alien Planet Designer web page, at:

        http://www.compulink.co.uk/~vicarage/planets/

This is a godsend for anyone who is interested in accurate planet and
system design, espedially for mathophobes such as myself. Just plug in some
values for the star and planet, and it spews out a wealth of data,
including angular size of the primary and the moon, whether or not eclipses
occur, tectonic activity, mean temperatures, surface gravity, coriolis
effect, and much else. The site also has a large number of indispensible
links to astronomical resources on the Web.

Have fun,

Glenn

The bottom line is that it\'s not known.  It is theoretically possible
for atmospheric circulation to distibute heat.  The problem is
that if you go through a period where the atmosphere begins
to freeze out on the cold side you loose atmospheric circulation.
The cold side them plumets in temperature (permamently freezing
out the atmosphere) and you can recover.

The plan has been to start the TNS once the Milieu 0 book is out.  As far 
as I know, that plan hasn\'t changed.  But, you might want to get in touch 
with the folks running the new web site . . .

Exactly.  The random system gets my creative juices going.  It is one

I feel the same about the character generation process--my favorite

        According to "Naval Architect\'s Handbook"
        (http//www.usa.net/~goldendj/Traveller) the jump fuel
        requirements in T4 are 10% of hull displacement per Jump
        number. I used that value.

        Hmm. I didn\'t notice this before. It is now fixed it so that
        only MFD gunners have separate workstations.

        One additional change to the spreadsheet was the new BL hit location
        and damage table calculations to "BL Data" sheet.

Hi Arthur,

There is an Air Raft on page 84 of the T4 rulebook.  The CSC stats for it 
aren\'t there, but at least the tonage and so on are.

Hope this helps,

"people in rubber suits" " (the Star Wars aliens, which no matter what shape
or color, acted very human).

Traveller\'s Major Races were a bit stereotyped... wolf pack Vargr, samurai
Aslan, etc.. so I admit to a little aniexty regarding this latest attempt at
aliens.

PHYSICAL:

A well put together 106 page book.  Foss art is thankfully used only on the
covers, and the artwork can be vaguely linked to the topic (I imagine the
front cover as showing Trakki Abominations circling one of their dead
cities).  The interior illustrations are well executed.  The typeface is
fairly large, but not overly so, and IMHO aided my attempt to read the
book.. I didn\'t have to squint.  At the end is a collection of "concept"
drawings.. I would have preferred additional finished artwork, or perhaps
some alien eqiupment.

CONTENT:

The book gives us 12 new races.. two are human minors, the rest are....
alien.  Tim Brown is to applauded for daring to go to extremes of design,
such as the Nunclees and the Providers.  Each race is presented with a
physical, psychological, and social brief, a cursory look at the homeworld,
and two sample members: one in the Imperium, one who lives on the homeworld.
Historical and character generation notes are also included.

EVALUATION:

Was this book worth the money I paid for it?  Yes.  Every race gave me ideas
for characters or adventures.  Their was nothing in this book I couldn\'t use.

I give it an 8 (out of 10)

PHYSICAL:

A 96-page book, with Foss banished to the covers for the most part.  well
organized, with occasional interior artwork illustrating the items described.

CONTENT:

The first half of the book is taken up by one of the most interesting
equipment lists I have seen in a long time.  Putting an actual Imperial
Surplus listing first was a stroke of genius.. I can just see the PC\'s
saying "well, it says that the battery should be here.. look again!"

The equipment list is also written with a subtle sense of humor..
"meaningful cultural exchanges" indeed!

Woven in among the shelves of gear are rules for such thing as vaccum
exposure and extremes of temperture.  I would have preferred that these all
be gathered into one place for ease of reference, but that\'s a minor nit.

The seconf main section is the vehicle design rules.  I haven\'t had the
opertunity to mess with these yet; but they look fairly complete.  As
someone has already pointed out, these rules err a bit on accuracy in favor
of playability.  I haven\'t found this to be a great problem, but if you wish
to be *exceedingly* anal about such things, buy GURPS Vehicles, v2, and
convert back over.

The final section is some pre-built vehicles.  The TL12 Grav Fighter is
exceedingly nasty.  I imagine ImpArmy jocks have a lot of fun flying these
things... 17.3Gs of Accl.. wow.

EVALUATION:

I admit it, I\'m a Greg Porter zombie.  I have been using 3G3 for years, and
my copy of the new version is in the mail to me.  This is how Traveller
supplements should be done.  It is weel written, has very few typos, and is
useful.

I give it 10 (out of 10)

I don\'t have a problem with the system because it produces odd results. I 
think it is splendid that we have to strain our imagination to explain such 
results. What I think is wrong is that it produce so _many_ odd results. I 
don\'t, for example, want a one-to-one correspondence between habitability 
and population, but I do want _some_ correlation. One or two worlds with
insidious atmospheres and high populations is fine, but it is not fine that
the population distribution on worlds with insidious atmospheres is exactly
the same as the population distribution for Terran-norm planets. That does
not (if you\'ll forgive me a reference that I\'m sure you\'re already getting
tired of hearing quoted) make economic sense ;-).

I\'ve been amusing myself by working on the history of the Spinward Marches
since I got Galactic, and I\'ve come up with some very creative explanations
about why some prime planets are practically unpopulated, but there are so
many of them that it is getting to be a strain. Especially the ones that are
astrographically so strategically located on trade routes that one would
think that the system would have been colonized even if the mainworld was
inacessible due to plague, poison, tsunamis, volcanoes, and earthquakes.

Random generation is fine for getting the imagination going, but only if
you do a reality check on the results later. The system I use in my own 
game universe is to spend 15 minutes trying to make sense of an odd UPP and
then changing it as little as possible if I can\'t. That still makes for some 
pretty strange and interesting results on occasion!

OK, this gives us an upper limit for how much of the reserve fleet could have
been activated and sent off with them. Not much use, though, unless we can
agree on how big the reserves were.

It\'s an odd thing about Depot. with a population of only 1000, it can\'t be
as useful as it appears to be. There\'s simply not enough workers to make
much of a difference wrt. ship-building (as opposed to ship maintenance).

Are you saying that RVE and Deneb ends up fighting each other!?! That goes
some way to explain things. Yes, I can see why Norris might keep out of
Corridor in the face of a threat from RVE (I have a lot more trouble with
the RVE threatening Norris, since they would (or at least should) be 
reluctant to provoke a war with him). But I _can\'t_ see Norris abandoning
three subsectors of his own Domain.

It is much more likely that he is making a bid for independence and is trying
to provide himself with an alibi.

Again, propably acting from hidden motives (or not so hidden  --  profit)

Except that being on the Denebian sector border it shouldn\'t be on its own.
It should be able to count on help from Denebian forces.

It dosen\'t make economic sense for them not to ;-). Besides, as Andrew pointed
out, _High Guard_ does allow them to build ships even if _TCS_ dosen\'t. A 
case of conflicting rules where, I submit, we should use our judgement. The 
best explanation I can come up with is that the Mikesh economy is booming so 
that ship construction is tied up years in advance. Hence outsiders can\'t get
their ships serviced there, causing a temporary drop in starport rating.
Not a very good explanation, I admit.

Yes. I found that out myself yesterday and was preparing for a helping of
crow today. I was wrong about the Vargr TL being max 13. It is TL 12 on
the average and trails the Imperium by one TL on the average, but there are
some TL 15 worlds.

You\'re off there, though. The reserve regulars may be TL 13/14 in general
(though if the reserves are 8 times the size of the active fleet, there will
also be TL 15 reserves), but the reserve colonials will be the TL of the 
system that build them.

Capacities:

Durima: (Pop*0.75/1000) =	 15 mill T

Kaasu:  (Pop*1.1/1000)  =	9.9 mill T
Khukish: (Pop*1.1/1000) =	8.8 mill T
Shushaka: (Pop*1.1/1000) =	8.8 mill T
Plunge: (Pop*1.2/1000) =	9.6 mill T
Khouth: (Pop*1.15/1000) =	4.6 mill T
Drayne: (Pop*1.2/1000) =	9.6 mill T
 
Kiran: (Pop*.95/1000) =		0.9 mill T
Demick: (Pop*1/1000)		0.7 mill T

A total of slightly less than 68 mill T of capacity.

Fact: The Imperium has an average of 1000 combat ships per sector.
Assumption: Imperium has 28.000 active combat ships distributed on 320 fleets,
an average of 87.5 ships per fleet.
Assumption: Corridor fleets amount to 1400 ships.
Assumption: Average size of Imperial ships is 100,000 T. (Based on an average
tax base of CrImp120 per citizen and using 55% of that to maintain mothballed
ships).
Assumption: Reserve fleets amount to 8 times the active fleet. (This is based
on a 3% of GNP in peacetime, 15% of GNP in wartime spending).

If so, the Imperial Corridor reserves amount to 1120 million T of warships.

Assuming doubling up of yard capacity, the Corridor shipyards can handle
34 million tons of warships at a time. 2% of 140 million T is tied up in
Imperial replacement ships already in the pipeline. Remains 31.2 mill T
of capacity. 

Assume an average of 9 weeks to reactivate a "batch".

Assume Corridor goes on a war footing the second they hear of the
assasination (NOT a plausible assumption, btw.) they have 50 weeks to
activate ships. This makes 5 "batches" reactivated, or 156 million T.
Remains 964 million T. Not counting the reserve units of planetary defense
forces, of course.

I wonder how long that will work? after all, they are just stretching their
command lines longer, making it more likely that a faroff fleet commander
will decide to set up on his own.

Well, that\'s another bit of canon. The Corridor fleets was a strategic
reserve. I\'m not saying that it was only against the Zhodani; it could 
have been a reserve against the Julian Protectorate too.

Yes, but there is a natural limit to how many ships a Vargr government can
have. They don\'t even get to tax all the people in their territories;
according to _Vargr_ most governments have large autonomous groups in
their population.

But the real problem is: Why didn\'t Deneb hold its borders against the Vargr
(as they have plenty enough strength to do) and why did they not extend
their protection to the spinward half of the Corridor subsectors once they
saw that the Zhodani wasn\'t going to attack?

The Current Superman (pre-Doomsday) in T4

Armour 100
Structure 25

Powers
Invulnerability: recovers his structure in armour every turn in an atmosphere, and he can 
enter vacuum for 4 turns without ill effect. He loses 20 Armour or 5 structure each turn 
thereafter
Supersenses: He effectively has an unjammable active sensors rating of 7, and is also 
immune to less than TL 13 EMM
Superstrength: he can attempt to hit a starship at difficulty of Difficult, doing 23 points of 
damage a hit, he can also apply 5440 G displacement tons thrust versus any ship he can grab 
hold of. Each use costs him 2 armour or 1 structure
Heat Vision: he can do an attack at a range of 1 hex, difficulty of Average, doing 4 points of 
damage. Each use costs him 2 armour or 1 structure
Superbreath: He can apply 7 G displacement tons thrust versus any ship in the same hex. 
Each use costs him 20 armour or 5 structure
Flight: acceleration 5 G, maximum speed 5. Unlimited hex turns per turn at no cost in 
movement. Each use costs him 1 armour or 1 structure
Superspeed: this power in total doubles his flight speed, drops difficulty of any attack by 
him by one level, and raises difficulty to hit him by one. Each turn of use costs him 5 
armour or 3 structure

Yeesss... The problem here is that the charisma won\'t go to the Vargr 
government leaders, it will go to the fleet commanders. It\'s the classic
problem of the old Roman emperors with the added twist that it must be
a lot worse for Vargr and that the Vargr leaders can\'t go themselves,
the way some Roman emperors did, because that makes the other part of
the charsima equation -- distance -- kick in.

Importing, say, one kg of food per person per day will require 28 million
tons of dedicated starships per billion inhabitants (Rough assumptions:
Jump-1 starships have 50% cargo capacity and costs Cr.0.5 per T). That will 
require a yearly maintenance cost of Cr1400 per person. for a TL 15 planet 
that would cost 6% of the GNP, or roughly twice what they supposedly use on
military spending. It increases the cost of the food by from 58 up to nearly
200%, depending on exact quality. (It also requires a world within 1 parsec 
that can produce the required amount of excess food per year.)

Atmosphere 4 is not a hostile biosphere. Worlds with tainted atmosphere are
eligible for Terran-prime category (size and hydrography permitting). Besides,
TL 10 is not low tech. It\'s a tad better than what we have today.

Once you\'re talking autonomy the picture improves, I admit. But then, that\'s
what I said above. They are more likely to try to carve out their own little
pocket empire. I\'d be wary of those pesky humans if I was the Vargr leader 
in question. The tail could easily end up wagging the dog ;-)

Kukish has had two years on its own to reactivate ships. That\'s roughly
48 million tons of starships, the equivalent of 5 and a half full Imperial
fleets.

If it didn\'t, why is Trin still reactivating ships in 1123? Even with 8
times the standing navy in mothball Trin is behind. it should have 
reactivated that many in a little less than 6 years. (Wait, I may be 
overlooking the finances; the shipyards wouldn\'t be able to afford to
go at full rate of reactivation as the number of ships to be maintained
grows. There would be a sliding scale involved. I don\'t have the energy
do the calculations now).

But the US is not storing their ships in an oxygen-free environment that
will make it last for centuries and the Imperium TL is not advancing at
the rate that the US is.

>At best the reserve fleet is going to be 20% to 50% of the peacetime fleet.

Yes, but even with calculating with 55% of the budget going to maintain
reserve fleets, the Imperial military spending only comes to CrImp120 per
citizen, which is _really_ low. The other way to work the assumption is
to make the average Imperial ship much larger than the 100,000 T I\'m 
already assuming.

>Why? Navies don\'t build ships just to put them in reserve. The FFW was not

1107 to 1110 is more than 2.5 year. Of course, it is too little time to
reactivate a huge reserve fleet, but...

What you say makes sense, but any way you look at it the figures are odd. I
don\'t insist on an 800% reserve, but you get some undesirable effects in 
other parts of our assumptions if we assume only 50%.

Yes. It reads as if it were written for the Classic
late-Third Imperium setting and had some names hastily
switched to make it "M0". (Note the "Vilani" official
with the suspiciously-Solomani-sounding name of Ranson Masters).
(Perhaps someone\'s old Contact notes have been sitting
in a file cabinet for years?)

I have vew complaints and many kudos for AA, but one
of the complaints is that it apparently wasn\'t proofread 
by anyone familiar enough with Traveller\'s established
background to red flag this fairly obvious discrepancy.

Also note the Controlled and Hresh encounter characters
who live on Dingir (presumably Dingir/Solomani Rim).
Dingir is in the ballpark of 120 parsecs from Sylea
(at least a year and a half one-way at Jump-3), across 
over 2 sectors of (in M0) poorly charted territory.

Furthermore, "historically," the Imperium gradually absorbed
the worlds and pocket empires of the Solomani Rim from
the 300\'s to the 500\'s.  In M0, it\'s doubtful anyone from
Sylea has even visited Dingir, except perhaps for a few
brave Scouts on a long-range exploratory mission
(that\'s a HINT, for the "campaign-idea-challenged").

And a final errata: the Newts belong in Empty Quarter sector,
not Old Expanses. And they don\'t have claws, so their
picture shouldn\'t either.

True.  On the other hand, their background is
SUPPOSED to be muddy (;)), and it doesn\'t really
affect actually roleplaying individual Controlled
in your game.

That doesn\'t bother me as much as the 3 or so pages
of "concept" art which has nothing to do with the 
finished form.  Plus the fact that all the aliens are
shown "alone and buck nekkid." Many are gregarious
and technological, and it\'d be nice to see what some
of them look like in an "actual" situation -- complete
with clothes, equipment, body language, etc.

At home the Charisma will go to the leader or at least some of
it will. Yes the leader is taking a huge gamble on lots of factors,
but that is the whole point. For the Vargr to have effective large
interstellar states (which they do) this problem can not be
insurmountable.

Actually importing 1kg of food per person per day requires a little
under 71,500 Td of cargo space (14,000 Kg per Td) per billion.
Using your figures (1Td cargo per 2Td of ship cost Cr0.5 per Td of
ship), it would cost Cr100,100 per billion per parsec. I\'d agree
it is a lot, but it depends on the cost of creating and maintaining
an artifical biosphere (from dirt up). If your interested the average
person requires about 4 kg of food and water per day.

Tainted thin atmoshpere with only 25% to 35% water, sounds at
least a little unfriendly :*) and TL 10 is low compaired with TL 13 :*).

Actually if I was the Vargr, I\'d welcome those pesky humans, a darn
sight more consistant/dependable than your average Vargr :*). but yes
again your right, the Vargr would have to play it carefully.

Assuming that they\'re stored at Khukish, assuming that there are
48 MTon of warships stored at all, assuming the ships Khukish
has are jump capable, assuming no ships came along and
wanted to be repaired or have their annual maintaince done :*).

>I say that WWII dosen\'t bear you out. I think it took a lot less than that

The systems used in the 2nd WW were a tad simplier than those
likely on your average TL15 warship :*), but even then it took 2 yrs
to train a competent crew. Taking the modern RN as an example.
Basic training = 3 mths, Sea training = 3 mths, Specialist training =
1 yr to 3 yrs (depending on speciality). And then once they are
trained you have to bring them together in a ship and allow them to
get used to one another (work up). During the 2nd WW the average
time to work up a new crew/ship was 6 mths. Using an unworked
up ship was little short of suicidal (witness the Prince of Wales in
the Battle of Denmark Strait). This gives you a minimum of two
years to get a crew ready, more likely three to four. Interestingly
during the 2nd WW, by about mid 1943 the RN and USN were
decommissioning older ships to allow their crews to be assigned
to new ones because they couldn\'t train crews fast enough, this
was at the height of the Battle for the Atlantic when every ship was
needed.

The missing factor is repairs to damaged ships and finding those
fiddly little out of date parts that got replaced in first line service
decades ago and you now find the ship just won\'t run without :*)

Actually the USN is storing the ships in an oxygen
free enviorment. Mothballing invovles sealing the ship,
pumping it full of a inert gas and then coating the hulls
in plastic. Theoretically a mothballed ship can last
for 100+ years. However the tech is a good point. So
I\'ve looked around for a better example:

The RN in 1791. A warship built in 1791 was not
significantly different from one built in 1594, or one built
in 1845 (these dates mark the period of the classic
sailing ship of the line) and was just before the massive
mobilisation and building program of the Revolutionary
and Napoleonic Wars which would throw latter figures
out. Ships of this period could be and were maintained
as effective fighting vessels in reserve for over 70 years
(note HMS Victory can be considered to have been an
effective fighting ship for about 120 years, 85 of which
were spent in reserve, and she\'s still around in good
condition 116 years later). The following tables throw
some light on the level of reserves.

This gives 176 ships active as against 101 reserve
The reserves are 60%-70% of the actives. This
percentage stays constant for the RN through out
the period (1594 to 1845). I chose the RN because
its situation was similiar to that of the 3rd Imperium.

(FFW 1008 days = 2.8 years) No you\'ve missed the point, not
to reactivate a huge fleet, to build a huge fleet. I was just saying
the FFW would not have lead to the kind of massive building
program that the World Wars did.

As far as I can see the only effect is that because there
aren\'t a huge surplus of ships laying around in reserve
states at war will tend to spend much of their now
increase military budgets on building new ships. Which
is what happens historically. If the number of ships in
reserve is much above 100% of the number in active
service then they are building ships just to go into
reserve. I just can\'t see any sane government allowing
that to happen (Imagine the headline "Navy builds
ships which are never used").

P.S. I\'m about to go away on holiday for a week, so
if I appear slow in replying, please bear with me.

Right, found reference to this *after* I posted.  Fusion is
expected to create from 1/100th to 1/1000th the quantity of radiated
material that Fission does now.

I\'m assuming you got this from the UPP. UPP stats aren\'t always what
they seem, especially for pop & govt. I believe that the UPP population
level represents permanent residents in the majority race. One could
assume that Depot has very few real permanent residents, like any
armed forces base, but has _lots_ of transients. Like a summer
resort town - permanent population 2000, summer population 20,000.
Now, that\'s a factor of 10, but I bet for Depot it could be 100 or
1000 times. Also, why in the Imperium would the ISS publish any
information whatsoever about Depot, a military installation that
is presumably not secret, but not exactly public either.

It is, to an extent, a question of whether UPPs are supposed to 
reflect absolute reality or the information available to the
characters.

Military shipyards != civilian shipyards.  Maybe Mikesh Jump drives

Anyways, carry on. You\'re much more interesting than I am.

Remember that "tidally-locked" is *not* the same as having the same
side always facing the primary (a "one-face" world). Luna is tidally
locked to Earth, and is a one-face world. But Mercury is locked to the
sun, but in a 3:2 resonance. That means that it rotates twice in every
three orbits. This means that one side is facing the sun at perihelion,
at the next perihelion the *opposite* side is facing the sun.

That would make a livable climate more likely. An atmosphere will help
too. Several "hard science" writers have set stories on one-face wolds
around type M stars. The weather patterns will be a *lot* different
than on Earth. Typical assumption is air rises on sunside and flows to
darkside, where it cools and returns to lightside at low altitude. As
long as the air cooling on darkside is warm enough to prevent major
glaciation, you are ok. Or if you have enough water for the glaciers
forming on nightside to flow under their own weight to the edges of
dayside and then melt to replace the water carried in the air.

Another sort of world was described in an article in a fairly recent
Analog. You use a string of cometary debris to blast a series of likned
craters along the terminator from pole to pole. With the proper setup,
you get a river flowing from the poles to the equator along the
terminator through the vally formed by the craters. And you get decent
air pressure and some living area. It\'s a neat idea.

Most M0 stars will be of the same age as the stars around them. Stars
in the galactic "disk" tend to be second and third generation. The
older stars will be moving thru the area with a quite high relative
velocity, and generally *not* moving with the "drift" of the other
local stars.

Also, second generation stars are thought to be *much* poorer in metals
than third generation stars like Sol. So while they\'d have things like
silicon and oxygen (and thus rocks), they\'d be noticeably lacking in
elements heavier than iron. Someday I hope to corner someone into
giving a "guesstimate" with more detail than that, so I can draw up a
rough abundances table for such stars.

Another interesting thing from a recent Analog article. It seems that
some planets have been detected orbiting supernova remanents. They
*have* to have condensed out of the nebuka formed by the supernova. And
that means that they will have *really* weird elemental abundances.
Mostly, they\'ll be lacking *light* elements, and very enriched in heavy
ones. Pity that it\'s 300 parsecs to the nearest known supernova remanent.
It\'d be a place worth visiting in spite of the hazards!

  fuel flow rate: 8 tons/min
specific impulse: 750
    Exhaust temp: 2227 C

The engine weight *includes* the pumps and the nozzle. The power output
is "thermal" so you can\'t tap anywhere *near* that. But I\'d be willing
to be that you could add some extra turbines to the fuels system to
generate power from the high speed fuel flow. Even if it\'s only 1% of
the output, that\'s 50 megawatts. 10% would give you 500 MW.

I\'d say this would work ok as the powerplant for a smaller ship. How do
the above compare with figures in FF&S?

I just pulled out JTAS 3 and low and behold it was there too.  The 241-1105
article was not verbatim with the original article.  Mostly minor changes
to make it a bit more readable.  The end of 1108 catches us up to JTAS 15
which also included an entry for 1109.

I once looked into the issue of element distribution across stellar 
generations.  It was years ago.  But I recall learning that when 
astronomers speak of "metals," they tend to mean any elements heavier
than helium (the bulk of which ARE metals, after all).  As far as they
are concerned, there\'s hydrogen, helium, and "metals."  "Metals" are 
all created by the same processes in novae and supernovae.  So I am not
sure iron will lag that far behind silicon in early-generation stars.
I think there will be the same proportions of the heavier elements, just
not much of them.

Whether that means such stars will have few rocky worlds or small rocky
worlds, or something in between, I have never been able to figure out.

of questions.

1. According to the rules the Fuel rating is the amount of fuel 
   carried in the ships given in standard displacement tons. 
   This means that the light fighter (given in both T4 and
   Starships) carries only fuel. It has a fuelrating of 10 
   and a 10 dton size. Whay wasn\'t the fighter changed in Starships?

2. Is there any relationships between shiparmour in FF&S and shiparmour
   in T4. Using the USD conversion charts gives the Patrol Cruiser, 
   the Scout ship enormously larger values of armor in T4 than they
   had in New Era. If the converted value from FF&S to T4 should be 
   multiplied by 10 (this seems right), how can the fighter have a 
   armour value of 8?

Thanks in advance.

More on `Real\' fusion

Fusion causes the release of Neutrons that can activate some materials, the 
metal of the vessel is the prime target. These Neutrons are the prime source of 
the heat energy that people are trying to release. Experimental machines are not 
designed to collect these neutrons and hence need the thick concrete walls Peter 
mentions.

The amount of this activation radiation is proportional to the amount of use, 
the inefficiency of the collection mechanism and the materials involved. Current 
estimates say that fusion reactors will be active for tens of years after use, 
not the thousands of fission waste products. Not really cause for a concrete 
industry celebration.

Certainly in traveller terms it is not unreasonable to expect that the materials 
and the collection process will be sufficient to provide the on/off ideal Peter 
also describes.

You might want to consider that fact that the usual starship cycle time is
14 days per jump (28 days for a round trip), and that your people might want
to be fed more than once every 28 days, not to mention downtime for annual
maintenance.  So it\'s more like 1kg*1E9 people*30 day cycle=3E10 kg/capacity.
Figure food at 1000kg/kl = 3E7 kl / 14 kl/dt = 2.1E6 cargo capacity =
4.2E6 dt of shipping at .5 MCr/dt = 2.1E6 MCr/billion people/jump.

Thanks!  I read the news.  :)  Seriously, a combination of TNS articles,
the article in MTJ #2 or 3, and _Vilani and Vargr_.

Yeah.  You wouldn\'t think that the fleet could have taken *everyone* with
when they left.  :)  The only other possibility is that more people live
off-Depot in the system than mainworld stats suggest, but that\'s stretching
things.

As for your other points, they\'re certainly good questions.  It would be
nice if we knew more about Provence sector, and could make some more
rational judgements.  Here\'s a question.  Based on what we know about
Vargr space, what would Provence have to look like for you to consider
the Vargr to manage what the "history" is showing?

But with the fleet the charisma goes to the admiral and the admiral already
has the advantage of proximity. That means that sending a fleet away from
the home world is tantamount to turning it over to the admiral. So if you
don\'t keep another fleet strong enough to beat the first back home with you,
you\'re practically turning over your government to the admiral.

But that\'s just it. The Vargr _don\'t_ have large effective interstellar
states. The best they can do is largish, semi-permanent, INeffective 
interstellar states. The Vargr concept of government just isn\'t the same
as the human concept. Large groups within national borders are autonomous
of, or even hostile to, the nation so tax collection must be a nightmare.

Unfriendly, yes, but the air is breathable and the water is there. And TL 10
is quite enough to sustain artificial environments.

If they exist at all then a fairly exact proportion of them will be stored
in the Khukish system.

No, these are the Imperial Navy reserves stord at Kukhish. The Kukhish
planetary defense reserves hasen\'t even been touched upon in that example.

By _TCS_ rules repairs do take up construction space, but maintenance only
costs money; it dosen\'t take up space (In reality, of course, it would take
up space, but that space would be over and above the 1 T per 1000 citizens
figure). 

>The systems used in the 2nd WW were a tad simplier than those likely on

How do you know? According to TCS it takes 9-10 weeks to reactivate a ship
in ordinary. No special provisions are made for lower efficiency during the
first so-and-so many months. Perhaps that means that part of the 1%
maintenance fee for ships in ordinary goes to keep the crew in training.
Perhaps it means that spaceships are much easier to run than WWII ships.

Repairs, granted, but finding those little fiddly bits, no. Remember that
the navy still pays 1% of the purchase price per year to maintain the ship.
A yearly maintenance overhaul only costs 1/10th of that. These ships aren\'t
mothballed, they are maintained in fighting condition (Mostly. I know that
there are examples of ships needing "nails").

No I didn\'t. I was saying that if the Imperial Navy traditionally has a huge
reserve fleet laid up in ordinary then the 5FW was too short to get through
it and no new construction would appear. However, if it only had a few ships
in ordinary then it would have, at least, 1 to 2 years worth of shipbuilding
more than that in 1117.

No, the major effect is that in that case the Imperium isn\'t using almost
half it\'s budget on maintaining ships in ordinary, which means that it is,
apparently, spending a lot less than _TCS_ and _Striker_ indicates. Even
_with_ that assumption the Imperium is apparently only spending CrImp36 per
citizen on its navy. Assuming that the Imperium uses 60% of its revenue on
the Navy, that means the Imperium gets CrImp60 per citizen. The average
citizen is TL 12, which means his homeworld\'s credits are worth approximately
0.6 CrImp, which means that he is paying 100 Cr to the Imperium. This
represent 30% of his total military spending, which means that he spends
Cr333.3 on his military. Since he makes Cr16.000 per year, military spending
is very close to 2%. (This figure is too high, actually, because there is a
correlation between high-population worlds and world TL, so the above-
average citizen pays disproportionately more, but let that slide for the
moment). With, say, 50% of the active navy in ordinary, the average
expenditure drops to CrImp21 per citizen, which means the military spending
is only 1,17%.

This implies that the military spending of the Imperium\'s major opponents
are also similarily low, which indicates a far more cordial relationship
with the Zhodani and the Solomani that the background implies.

It also means that the wartime expenditures of the Imperium (15% of GNP) is 
not 5 times greater than its peacetime expenditure like _Striker_ suggests,
or even 7.5% greater as my figures suggests, but almost 13 times greater.

Alternatively, the average size of Imperial ships about 300,000 T (that\'s
_average_. The 1000 ships per sector figure includes everything from 5000
T escorts and up).

>Which is what happens historically. 

That is what happened historically to surface ships on one world. Not what
"happened" historically to spaceships in three Imperiums

It just takes a slightly more cautious attitude. The Vilani influence, 
perhaps? I admit that _I_ would have twice as many ships and a lot less
reserves, but I\'m not running a government with more than 10,000 years
of historical baggage.

Btw. I can give you one historical example of building ships that were never
used. Before the Napoleonic Wars Denmark had developed a tradition for
having a huge fleet (Some 40 SoLs, I think), much more than they could 
afford to man. The idea was that it would act as a deterrent. We only
needed a few months to field (if that\'s the word when ships are involved)
a very strong fleet (at least on paper; apparently noone worried about
the quality of the crews. Go figure). Unfortunately we also laid up most
of the ships we did man each winter, so the sneaky English attacked in
spring before we could rig out the fleet.

Nevertheless, I agree that an 800% reserve fleet is unlikely. OTOH, so is
a low military expenditure.

 This is _hairy_!  Hairy enough to make the previous problem
 look like a cue ball! We\'ll need to know the following data,
 just to _start_ on this problem:

        1.      The subtension of the GG in the planet\'s sky
                (given as ~28 degrees)

        2.      The tilt of the GG axis (given as 25 degrees)

        3.      The subtension of the solar disc

        4.      The period and range of declination of the GG
                (your tilt and his may not be the same) (period
                is given as "one day", as it\'s tidally locked -
                but how long is a day?)

        5.      The period and range of solar declination

        6.      The latitude of observation.

        7.      Your period around the GG

        8.      Your diameter

        9.      Your distance from the GG

 Note that all periods need to be in the same units.

 It will take me quite some time to derive the correct formula,
 even if I have the math - which I may not!  This is a dynamic
 system; I have lots of trouble with them.

 Some information that may be useful:

 As you move from a latitude equal to the declination of the GG,
 the specific 28 degrees that the GG covers in the sky will move
 by an equal amount, but in the opposite direction.

 If the sun and the planet are at the same declination, you will
 get at least a partial eclipse every slightly more than one
 revolution around the GG at any point within a band 28 degrees
 in width, and a total eclipse in the same interval at any point
 within a band (28 - solar subtension) degrees in width centered
 on the same location.

 If the solar declination is different from the GG declination,
 the above situation will obtain for any period in which the
 solar declination falls within the indicated limits.

 Totality will last for (28-solar subtension)/360 of the GG
 rotational period, given that the planet is tidally locked to
 the GG. The entire eclipse, including partiality, will last for
 (28+solar subtension)/360 of the GG rotational period.  This
 assumes equator-to-equator contact for the eclipse; if contact
 is off-center, then use (28*secant(solar declination from GG))
 instead of 28 for a good approximation; for a better
 approximation, use secant(solar declination from GG) instead of
 solar subtension.  I think; I\'m sort of trying to
 gedankeneyeball this.

People with magic lights who talk to sky people could change a culture. Even
if a culture already has various beliefs concerning magic, it is doubtful
that high tech artifacts are going to fit seamlessly into the pevailing
mythos. If the sky people visit on a regular basis, myths will be created to
explain them. The legends and lessons in the myths will be changed. For good
or for ill, who knows?

Wizards or preists can weild a great deal of power, and can change the social
structure completely. A noble class of Magicians could be created, based upon
nothing more than the possesion of a flashlight. An entire religon built
around a radio. 

Fear of the unknown could also cause the populace to hunt down and kill
anyone trafficing with the "sky people". Wizards with magic lights also be
seen as a threat to "decent folk". The Salem hysteria and Europe\'s witch
hunts of the 1600\'s stand as evidence. Not only would this attitude stunt the
planet\'s technological growth (scientific experimentation would most likely
be illegal), but the Imperium would have a tough time trying to get the
people to accept them when the time comes to invite the planet into the fold.
If the populace has always been taught that sky people are evil,  how are the
scouts going to be treated when they do try to make contact?

True, I\'m speaking of an extreme scenario, but the possiblity exists, and the
Scout would have to consider it.

No, you\'re not wrong.  However I may be asking the list for some help in

A friend of a friend of a friend sent me this little note from one Ken
Whitman, alleged marketing flack for one "Imperium Games":

******MILIEU 0: The Third Imperium.******

The essential background for adventuring in Traveller is provided in a
number of Milieu books, each detailing an era in the long history of
mankind in space. Milieu 0 chronicles the emergence of the Third Imperium
from  the Long Night, extending its reach to re-explore and re-conquer the
vast interstellar territories that have been untouched for 1700 years.
Covers the early years of the Third Imperium, its history, structure,
economics, and library data. Also includes many adventure hooks and adds
direction to players and Referees. Marc Miller.

Other Milieu Books will include (among others): The Aslan Border Wars, The
Vargr Wars, The Barracks Emperors, The Rule of Man, Ziru Sirkaa, The
Solomani Rim War, The Zhodani Core Expeditions, and The Interstellar Wars.

******FIRST SURVEY******

This vital companion to Milieu 0 is an atlas of the 50 or so sectors that
were the Vilani Empire and its surrounding territories. The star systems of
the Sylean Federation are well defined. Farther and farther out, systems
are less well-defined. Each adventuring group determines its own survey
results for each system they visit. Lester Smith.

******Third Imperium Weapons******

Players and Referees will be thrilled to buy this complete book of Imperium
weapons. Weapons include melee, small arms, heavy weapons and artillery.
This guide will include graphic detail and history behind the weapons use
in the Imperium. Greg Porter.

******Adventure Class Ships******

Now it is time to add some detail to the players lives with this complete
book of Adventure Class ships.  Not only will this book supply a player
with new 100+ ton ships, it allows them to design their own ships, just the
way they want them. Don Perrin.

******Anomalies******

The records of the past don\'t mesh with what should be out there. This is
the first EPIC adventure designed specifically for the Referee in mind.
Marc Miller.

******Pocket Empires******

When Cleon established the Third Imperium, he never expected he would have
competition from his own scouts, merchants, and naval officers. Thousands
of adventurers tried to conquer worlds and establish their own empires in
the vast, uncharted territories not yet under Imperial rule. Strategic
level rules for establishing Pocket Empires. Marc Miller.

******Handbook of the Psionic Institutes******

When the Psionic Institutes began studying this abstract science, they just
didn\'t know what a bag of worms they opened. Are they a bunch of crackpots,
or is there something there? Ken Whitman.

******Small Craft******

If Adventure ships just wasn\'t enough, then you may want to explore the
world of small craft.  Not only will this book supply a player with new
ships less then 100 tons, it allows them to design their own ships,
including fighters. Don Perrin.

 ******MILIEU 200: Aslan Border Wars******

The Aslan Border Wars went on for thousands of years. This book details the
wars and the territories they were fought over. Includes major coverage of
the Aslan and how to play them. Lester Smith & Tim Brown.

******TRAVELLER: Strategic Battles******

Warfare is still the ultimate system for resolving disputes between the
stars. This board game, based on Fifth Frontier War, provides the mechanism
for fighting battles large and small anywhere within the Traveller
universe. Recreates historical battles and allows generation and resolution
of new ones. Meshes with Pocket Empires. Marc Miller. "

Actually the site name of

	http://www.imperiumgames.com

is NOT changing.  The situation is that we\'re in the middle of shifting
servers from the old server to the new high performance server.  Since the
old web pages were deleted before I could get the new site up, we had to
scramble to get the new pages responding to the old name.

So now "www.imperiumgames.com" is pointing to another interim server of
mine, which will then auto-forward browsers to the new address until we get
the pointers shifted around.

Hopefully this will be the last unsolicited intrusion for a while from me.
I didn\'t really see a need to introduce myself, but Joe Heck suggested I
may want to so that people know who I am, and why I\'m posting about the
Imperium Games website.

First of all, I\'m not an employee of Imperium Games.  I\'m an independant
contractor who has taken on managing the IG website.  My consulting
company, and our provider of choice (OPX) are providing the web hosting,
html design, and internet support for the Imperium Games web presence.

I _have_ been blessed with a lot of support from the highest level of
Imperium Games in revamping the website.  They\'re working hard to get all
the products out the door, and they\'re planning a **LOT** of things for
Traveller, which will be announced on the site.

As for my background, <BORING ON> I\'m 27 (28 in two weeks), and I\'ve been
playing Traveller since the first time I saw Azhanti High Lightning, and
the Serpent Class Scout by Paranoia Press in the 7th grade and got hooked.
I\'m engaged to a lovely woman with an 8 year old (I knew experience
fighting aliens would come in useful SOMEWHERE).  I\'ve been working in
computers for about 16 years, and I have two cats and my web page is at
http://www.cris.com/~dbullock <BORING OFF>

I am working hard to bring the IG pages up to speed, and I GREATLY
appreciate both the great encouragement/reviews/kudos/attaboys I\'ve
recieved from so many people, and the help I\'ve received from others (like
Chris Cox\'s (Draconis Cluster) artwork), and the suggestions for changes
from others.

Just as a note - The site is being hand coded by myself in HTML, and is
tested the same day changes are made using Lynx, Netscape 3.0, and Internet
Explorer 3.01.  I\'m primarily coding using HTML 2, although as time goes on
I\'ll be using HTML 3.0 features like cascading style sheets and what not.
The site itself is sitting on a high performance Pentium UNIX server
running Apache, with CGI\'s I\'m writing, and a T3 connection.

Also, here are some site statistics (we\'ve been up about 3 days)

Log Analysis On:  Thu Jan 9 18:04:19 GMT 1997

One of the other features I\'m adding is a "WEBSITE NEWSLETTER" (The
subscription form is on the OTHER SITES/LINKS page.  We\'ll be using the
Website Newsletter as an adjunct to the normal NEWS page to make sure that
you get major important news right away.  I encourage everyone to subscribe
to the newsletter.

Part of the goal for the new IG site is that the days of "OK it says Last
Updated December 2, and it\'s January 5" are over.  I\'ll be active, and
involved, and expanding the site services, including live Traveller chat,
Traveller message systems, and lots of availability by myself and others.

Well I can\'t think of anything else and I hate hearing [watching] myself
talk, so that\'s about it.  If anyone has ANY questions please feel free to
email me directly.

I once looked into the issue of element distribution across stellar 
generations.  It was years ago.  But I recall learning that when 
astronomers speak of "metals," they tend to mean any elements heavier
than helium (the bulk of which ARE metals, after all).  As far as they
are concerned, there\'s hydrogen, helium, and "metals." 

		having just taken (and PASSED!;->) an astro course here at
Dartmouth, I can vouch for the better part of the above. Metals are only
abundant in later generation stars, and amongst those, the older in actual
years the better. Mass also plays a part.

  "Metals" are 
all created by the same processes in novae and supernovae. 

		er, not exactly. Briefly, as a star starts out, its is mostly
Hydrogen and Helium. as time goes by, burning off of hydrogen brings about more
helium, burning of helium brings about othr elements(and in some cases, Novae)
which over shorter and shorter cycles bring us to the end phases of silicon and
iron. No matter how much mass is pressing on iron, it resists burning. But the
final stages happen SO fast and involve such pressures that the resulting rush
to the bottom of the gravity well either 1)\'bounces\' and explodes, bring us a
supernova and spreading all those nice heavy elements(metals) leaving behind a
neutron star or 2) pushes the core beyond its own gravitational area, going
supernova and creating a black hole (AND still spewing much metals to the solar
winds).  

 So I am not
sure iron will lag that far behind silicon in early-generation stars.

		by a very small degree astronomically. anywhere from minutes to
days in reality.

I think there will be the same proportions of the heavier elements, just
not much of them.

		relatively true, but think of the actual volume of the stars in
question: a star has to be (as I recall) no less than 30 solar masses or
greater to even get to the silicon/iron stage. Taking into account the
percentages, you could still probably make quite a few solar systems out of
nothig but the core elements of ONE massive star....

Whether that means such stars will have few rocky worlds or small rocky
worlds, or something in between, I have never been able to figure out

		Its all distribution, and usually dependent on the interstallar
medium the star is formed from: Keep in mind, protostars form out of big clouds
of cool materials, condense, ignite, and only THEN is there enough material
thrown off to start to form solar systems.

If I may say so, your doing a great job in your \'scramble\'.  The only thing
I\'d request is that you get a copy of the errata online soon, as I saw one
or two requests for it on Usenet.  I did direct those people to the list for
the _complete_ errata so I don\'t know if anything\'s happening.  But, it\'s
still probably a good idea.

I\'m really anxious to see what some of these features will be, such as
contest, play-by-email and others.  Also, my site is _finally_ listed in
Other Links!  :)

Just a couple of quick questions:

1) Where do I look on the net to find information pertaining to the   
setting of T4, so I can get a "feel" for the game?
2) Are there any campaign setting developers, on the net, that are   
looking for out side input? (Prefer an Australian group, but I would like   
to get involved in any group!)

Apologies for any confusion I may have caused. Thanks for the details,

I have only watch your discussion with on eye, and I\'m not familiar
with the Varg Invasions, but I still have a question.

Although there is a large reserve fleet (in this I take it you mean
ships, not crew since these has to be reactivated) after the Imperial
fleet is pulled out, where does the worlds get crews for these ships?
I would think that training sufficent crews for 48 million tons of
ships so that they are battle-capable would take some time.

Which works out to 2100 Cr per person per jump per 30 day cycle. Or 70
Cr per person per jump per day.

Seems rather expensive to me. :-)

I was aware of this, but didn\'t mention it since it makes little
difference to my comments.

Not true. "Metals" are formed to a greater or lesser extent in *all*
stars as they reach the later stages of their lives. Very low mass
stars may never even get to helium burning, simply because they aren\'t
massive enough to supply the required pressures. Other, more massive
stars will burn helium in the core when they run out of hydrogen. Still
more massive stars burn heavier elements. Until you get to a star
massive enough to star producing iron. At that point things get different.
You get a *loss* of energy, core collapse, and a supernova.

Novas seem to involve white dwarfs or neutron stars with close
companions. And they are a matter of hydrogen accumulating on the
surface until it there\'s enough to detonate from the pressure. This
won\'t produce lots of heavy elements, though it can spread some of the
elements in the surface layers around. In extreme cases you get a
different kind of supernova, which completely destroys the star.

Anyway, it takes a nova or supernova to *spread* the heavy elements so
that they can be incorporated into a new star system.

First generation stars formed from nebula containing *no* metals. Thus
any planets formed will be hydrogen & helium exclusively. Which limits
them to gas giants and iceballs.

The novas and supernovas of the more massive first generation stars
will enrich the interstellar medium in metals, thus when the medium
accumulates into a nebula dense enough to form second generation stars,
there will be some metals in the planets formed. Ditto for the stars.
So they\'ll be able to have rocky worlds as well as gas giants and
iceballs. 

When second generation stars go supernova that adds still more metals
to the interstellar medum. When this doubly enriched medium accumulates
into stars and planets, you get third generation stars and their
planets. That\'s us, about 15 billion years from the earliest stars.

Fourth generation stars are forming now...

many...). I put the books back on the shelf, and looked along to Atlas 
Games Ars Magica 4th Ed: 272 pages for #20. 

Sorry guys, Traveller just dropped off my shopping list, until they 
put more value into their books. I can understand not dropping the 
price (they need the revenue), but the public here isn\'t going to 
loved them at this price- to-page ratio, Foss art or no! 

If they can drop the colour plates, drop Foss\'s royalties and the 
colour costs and spend the money of *writing*, I might come back 
again. 

Aliens might be useful, but it struck me as one of the worst value 
supplements I\'ve picked up in a long time. I felt cheated just looking 
at the print size...

So why not rotate the direction of gravity by 90 degrees and sleep

Bottom line, basic mail only vial this node, canot log on to IRC! :(
Shutdown apparently occured at 5pm EST, so that it was unnoticed while I was 
updating X.net files at work.

I kinda knew this might happen, but i didn\'t relize how incompetent the 
managemnet at my roomies work was (OOC----They forgot to pay the bloody ISP 
bill!)

This is not a prob, but for tonight there is a prob, I am sory i canot be on 
IRC tonight to help with SSDS.

Tommorrow i hope to be able to get my own ISP account so that i don\'t have 
to worry bout it any more.

Again my appologies

"Planet X goes off the air imediately, We keep the flame...good luck"
 P.S. email this account for correspondance


The Commander can not begin to express his appologies enough for letting 
down those who had expected to hear from the CEO and Chief Engineer of 
 XTech on the IRC  E-Frequency network.  The Commander has read the posts to 
this mail list regarding his good character and helpful nature, and feels 
like a "1st class heel" by not showing up.  Hopefuly the Administrator of 
the IRC channel recieved the Transmission sent via jump carrier in time.

The Commander would like to state that e-mail is still available via both 
chanels (bprankard@theiia.org)  (CmdrX74627@aol.com)

The Site is sitll up and running, but the access codes for modifation have 
been disabled.

The Commander wanted to leave you with this final quote from some obscure 
Ancient Solomani 2D entertainment projection.

"It\'s not my fault!....They told me they fixed it!"

nice sidestep to the new with a cool adventure binding them together. 

This is my problem:

A couple of adventures ago they got their filthy hands on a hitech trader
from the lost civilisation of Arcane (TL:21) and had to fight of a lot of
drewling greedos just to keep that thing. In this adventure they happen to
slip into a plot to capture this ship by the military and because of that
has an accident wich either:

1. Damages the ship so bad they have to enter the cold berths just to stay
alive while their robot (also got him from the lost civ)drives them out of
harms way. It will take him 86 years approx. and by then the ship is ready
for the scrapyards.

2. Is attaced by the same military and because of the energy discharge
produced by the shields they do a time/space jump when entering J-space
leaving it 86 years later with so much dammage they have to enter cold
berths to stay alive.

In the end they will be awakened by the RC wanting to know who they are and
such. Their robot will be missing, carrying the ships specs of that TL, but
only the players will know that.

The question:

How will the reaction be from the base, them knowing these players have
knowledge of vast technology? 
How far will they go to get it?
Will they be able to reproduce the technology to some degree?

Give me some random thought about it will\'ya.

There is no one setting per se for T4. IG plans to put out Millieu books
spanning the history of the Third Imperium and beyond (maybe the other
way, too. I thought they wanted to do a Millieu book on The Long Night as
well). M:0, which is the beginning of the Third Imperium emerging from The
Long Night, should be out Real Soon Now.

may not be Travelleresque, you have to remember that all of Foss\' color

paintings.  Courtney broght him in for two reasons:

1) He has a lot of work we could purchase for second rights, and
2) His name is famous in Hollywood, which would help open doors for a
Traveller movie.

We (Courtney and I) went through and picked out color plates.  I being a
fan of Traveller picked only the plates that I felt you could say "Yah,
that feels like Traveller."  Courtney picked the plates that he felt he
could sale to a movie company.

Do I like all of the plates Corney picked? Hell No! But he was financing
the project and I did not feel like telling him what will sell to the big
movie companies.

Do I think Foss is a great artist? You bet your ass!


*******
But what about his original stuff?

We brought Foss over from England for 3 months.  During that time he
created two color paintings and 225 black and white drawings (WOW, you
figure how fast he was working).  Foss was directed to make "older-looking
ships and equipment" .  I always knew that we would be modernizing the
ships as the timeline progressed.  IT WAS ALL PART OF THE MASTER PLAN.

Now for those of you who think FOSS can\'t do Traveller-like pictures, boy
are you in for a surprise when you see the cover for Pocket Empires!  An
original Foss made for TRAVELLER.

Now Foss has asked me to sell the original artwork.  The asking price is
$3,500.  If anyone is interested, I would be willing to e-mail a j-peg to
them.  ONLY people interested in PURCHASING this piece should e-mail me at
Whitman@pensys.com.  For the rest of you who are just curious, you will
have to wait.  I am sure it will be on the new website in the matter of a
few weeks.

Description,

It is a war-torn battlefield.   Explosions and burning buildings.  The
natives were warned if they did not surrender their planet, they would
suffer the consequences.  They didn\'t listen.  Three marines in battledress
are attacking an aircraft.  Two marines are on top of the aircraft firing
guns into the unseen cockpit, while one marine lifts the raft onto its
side, propping it up using his head.  Above, we see a local aircraft
exploding from the laser shot of a superior Imperium fighter .

Overall, a great Traveller feel, and to all of you who don\'t like Fosses
old stuff...

My RC "Recovery Techs" are on the lookout for such "Metheselahs". Commonly,
they are offered positions in the RC if their ship works, pay to work off
those inevetable "necessary repairs"; or if the ship is no longer
operational, then the corporations are more than happy to have one or more
R&D techs to repair and refurbish TL 15 gear.  But, then again, the ship\'s
steward is usually out of luck.

Right.

The fighter is wrong, in both T4 and Starships.  It was designed before Greg
Porter\'s vehicle design system was ready, and before there was a workable
small craft design system.  I believe that it wasn\'t changed in Starships
because there wasn\'t anything better to replace it with.

Yes.  FF&S armor values (also used in SSDS) should be converted to "USD"
factors (using the table in the back of Starships).  Multiply the USD value
by 10 to use the design with T4.

>    If the converted value from FF&S to T4 should be 
>    multiplied by 10 (this seems right),

It is.

> how can the fighter have a armour value of 8?

The fighter wasn\'t designed; it was made up (due to the lack of a design
system) to look reasonable.

 Dragonfire has this interesting syndrome -
 "cyberrubberization".  A server suffering from this exhibits
 the symptoms of being down, then up, then down, then up, then
 down, and so on.  The last info I got from them, they were
 down, with more to follow.

I liked the adventures and the story about Beowulf.  The only problem 
I had with it was the aburpt ending.  Hadta re-read the last part for 
it to make sense.
I also thought the bit about Biotechnology was good.  Perphaps some

starbase construction.

On the other hand not leading fleets or supporting them from home could
result in Vargr leaders ending up being ex-Vargr leaders.  I imagine that the
idea of invading the Corridor would have been fairly popular for the
following reasons: The recent Oekhsos\' triads had whipped up a fair amount of
anti-Imperium feeling which not only resulting in many Vargr who wanted to go
and show the Impys a thing or two, but also helped unify Vargr in general; 
From a Vargr point of view plundering was not only an accepted way to make
money but being a corsair was a desirable and romantic profession;  Suddenly
Corridor was left "undefended" and many Vargr would feel that this would be
the opportunity of a lifetime.  Of course Corridor wasn\'t really undefended,
but with the withdrawal of most of the Imperium\'s fleet and reports of
successful corsair raids in Corridor the perception that Corridor couldn\'t
properly defend itself would have been there.  Under these circumstances
Vargr leaders who opposed invading Corridor could have found themselves being
replaced by those who advocated invading corridor.

I should note that - lest people think astronomers actually know what
they\'re talking about and understand everything - no "first generation"
zero-metallicity star has ever actually been found. There are various
theories as to why this should be the case, none of them compelling.
(Possibly the first-generation stars all formed as the protogalaxy was
collapsing and are *way* out in the galactic halo, and possibly only
relatively massive ones that have now all turned into undetectable neutron
stars/white dwarfs formed.)

A second-generation star will generally have ten times less metals than
the sun, so you probably won\'t get enough concetrated together to make a 
rocky planet - though that depends on which planet formation model you 
believe.

I should also note that for (confusing historical reasons) the 
sunlike current generation of stars is called "Population I", the
earlier second generation stars are called "Population II", and the
still-hypothetical zero-metallicity stars are called "Population III".

Fair enough. After all, there have been SOOOOO many movies based on all
those other role-playing games. Like, uh, er...

Perhaps thinking about buyers first and Hollywood second would have been a
better plan of attack.

>Do I think Foss is a great artist? You bet your ass!

I don\'t think many people here would disagree with that. But seeing several
of those plates once was enough (way back when they were first used on old
paperbacks), and most of them were just mis-used.

Well, maybe the Master Plan was to blame, then. But I still think that the

In Path of Tears they mention several ships, which I assume were going
to be detailed in the book Long Ships, which never came out. :(
So I took it upon myself to detail some of them. First off is the
Leviathan Assualt Transport.  I used SSDS, with a few FFS parts
thrown in.  I included both T4 and FFS design sheets, so even
more people could use the design.  One design consideration, is that
I used thrusters in the design, even though TNE didn\'t use thrusters,
mainly because I like thrusters.  

I am really interested in feedback, Do YOU think that this ship could
be actually used to carry 1000 troops into battle, with all the
equipment that they need.

From Path of Tears pg 38:
       "These ships will provide the Coalition with the capability to
 move large numbers of combat troops from one world to another an conduct
 opposed landings.  Each of these ships will carry a light brigade, and
 include launch facilities for a spearhead battalion of drop troops. 
 Although this capability is not intended for use in combat, the 
 Leviathan wil be streamlined to allow landing on planetary surfaces.
        Proponents of the coreward stategy see these ships as providing
 new capabilites to pacify worlds far out in the AO, while consolidating
 strategists expect that these ships will be used closer to home."

 Designer\'s Notes:
 POT lists a brigade as having three batallions of roughly 500 soldiers each.
 I assumed a light brigade was one with only two battalions.  The ship is
 also supposed to be able to drop a spearhead battalion into combat. I 
 figured that 400 soldiers and 100 dummy capsules dropped with most of 
 their command and control assests located on the ship sounded like a 
 spearhead battalion.
 The design was done with SSDS, with occasional FFS bits.

 Description
      The Leviathan Class Assualt Transports will be the biggest ship
in the Coalition Navy upon completion. The same team of Naval architects
that designed the rest of the Clippers designed the Leviathan. It shows 
this lineage, both in its appearence and its internal arrangements. 
The ship looks like a streamlined version of the Aurora and Maggart 
Clippers, with the addition of small stabelizing wings in common with
the Lancer and Fusillier classes. (For a picture of the Lancers/Fussillier
see their respective Battle Rider counters.)
      The inside of the ship also resembles the other Clippers.  This
has its good points and its bad.  The mechanical systems on each of the
clipper line tend to be versions of each other, and reduces the amount of
training maintence staffs need.  The staterooms are also identical
allowing transfered sailors to feel instantly at home.  Unfortunatly
some of the problems with the other clippers have not been fixed, every
stateroom still has the same badly designed fresher made by Novastar Inc. It
has a habit of backing up and "regurgitating" its contents back over the
floor of the fresher.  The Navy has tried to get Novastar to fix the design
but since Novastar\'s CEO August Delparo was just arrested for treason, 
the company is in a state of confusion and has been unable to come to any 
agreement over replacing the designs.  So when Delparo gets convicted, alot
of Coalition sailors will cheer his downfall.

Operations: 
    During a hostile landing, 400 marines will use the drop capsules to make
a meteoric descent. They will be accompianed by 100 MK II capsules in
various loadouts, depending on the mission and the commander\'s preferences.
(For details on drop capsules see RCEG.) At the same time the ship will
be firing planetary assualt missiles at enemy targets. As its laser turrets
are equiped with tunable lasers, they can also be turned on targets on the
ground, though they are intended at point defense weapons.  
    Once a beachhead has been achieved, the ship can launch its Fury
assualt landers, which carry a further 196 marines.  At the same time,
any carried grav vehicles can be launched. These can include Intrepid
grav tanks, Pyrrhus support sleds, and Ferret/Mongoose attack speeders.
    It is not expected that the Leviathan opperates alone. It does not
have the firepower to take out opposing starships.  It will probably
operate in concert with several clippers or destroyers.  After these
ships have cleared away enemy spacecraft they can be used as orbital
artillery. Fussiliers will not tend to be used in this role, as their
partical accelerators do not work as well in this role as the Lancer\'s 
meson gun.  Aurora, Maggart, and Belladonna Clippers can also carry
fighters which will provide air support to the troops.

Great.  Now the Cr64,000 question:  What do the designations R, N and S

Possibly.  But, it could be looked at this way:  Issue 24 of JTAS cost 
$2.50 in 1985, and you got 48 digest-sized pages.  Issue 25 of JTAS cost 
$5.00 in 1996, and you get 48 full-sized pages.  Looked at this way, it\'s 
not a bad deal. :)

Yup.  This is our chance.  Don\'t like the articles in JTAS?  Do better 
ones!  :)  JTAS #25 has submission guidelines.  Go to it! :)

How in the heck do they do maintenance on this thing? Some materials
and technological devices must be impossible to find even with the
few TL16 worlds in the Imperium. Even in the Vanguard Reaches/Beyond
sectors published by Paranoia Press, the highest TL was 17.

I\'d go with number 2. It can be used to guarantee the military can\'t
track/follow them. "Sir, we\'ve been able to discern their destination
from their jump field configuration but we\'ve picked up some unusual
readings..."

Given the history of the RC\'s Smash & Grab tactics, I\'d have to opt
for the RC grabbing the ship using any means short of outright murder.
Minor tech may be reproducable but, overall, it\'s main value would be
the furthering of research. Keep in mind that a number of tech
improvements are dependent on advances in material science, power
generation, and a host of other advances all being added together in
ways not previously known to achieve a synergistic effect.

As an example, consider the events and advances required for you to
be reading this post. The discovery of electricity, the development of
the particle accelerator in your monitor, and the manufacture and
manipulation of the materials used in your PC\'s motherboard aren\'t even
scratching the surface. How about the technologies and industries
required to simply exist before these advances can occur?

You\'re talking a jump from the RC\'s highest TL of 12 to a TL of 21?
Most of the trader would be magical. Heck, even black globes were
just starting to be really effective around TL18-19 and the 3rd
Imperium, at TL15/16, struggled with this technology and treated it
with the highest security possible.

Your players may be highly compensated by the RC but given its
current resources, they can\'t help but realize they\'ve come out on
the short end.  Then again, they are alive...

Aw, come on, Ken. Don\'t be shy; just say what\'s on your mind. ;-)

Personally, I really like the black & whites in T4 (though I\'d like
to know the race of the "seal"-faced alien). Although I also think
that while *some* of the plates aren\'t Travelleresque, so what? The
day I can do better, IG will be receiving my submissions in the
mail. (Don\'t hold your breath)  I use art I like from many different
sources. Besides, he *is* one fine artist.

BTW, would someone like to explain in objective detail what makes a
piece of art "Travelleresque"?

There is an Aliens Tech book in print now.  I have seen it at the local Barnes &
Noble\'s store in town.  Don\'t know the publisher or author, but it does make 
for interesting reading, with plenty of pictures and line drawings.

RELEASE: 97-7

SOFTWARE FOR FIRST NEW MILLENNIUM MISSION CLOSEST YET TO "HAL 9000"

    As the fictional birthdate for the HAL 9000 main computer 
from the landmark science fiction tale "2001: A Space Odyssey" 
approaches, NASA is preparing the most advanced spacecraft 
artificial intelligence software yet developed for launch 
aboard the New Millennium program\'s Deep Space One (DS1) spacecraft.

    According to the 1968 book by highly acclaimed author 
Arthur C. Clarke, Hal "became operational" on January 12, 1997, 
in Urbana, IL, home of the University of Illinois.  It then 
served as the "brain and nervous system" of the 400-foot-long 
spaceship Discovery that carried astronauts on a thought-
provoking voyage to the planet Saturn (changed to Jupiter in 
the movie version).

    The robotic DS1 spacecraft carries no crew and is much 
smaller than the spaceship of "2001," at a total mass of 945 
pounds, but its computer artificial intelligence program, known 
as the Remote Agent, shares the same basic goal of operating 
and controlling a spacecraft with minimal human assistance.

    "We don\'t want to give the impression that Remote Agent is 
an artificial lifeform," said Kanna Rajan, a DS1 computer 
scientist at NASA\'s Ames Research Center, Mountain View, CA.  
"However, the software will logically reason about the state of 
the spacecraft, and the Remote Agent will consider all of the 
consequences of its actions."

    Following its scheduled July 1998 launch, DS1 will fly by 
the asteroid McAuliffe in 1999, and the comet West-Kohoutek-
Ikemura and the planet Mars in 2000.  DS1 is thefirst scheduled 
mission in NASA\'s New Millennium program, which is designed to 
test and validate cutting edge technology for the systems and 
instruments on-board future NASA science spacecraft.  The 
Remote Agent is being developed in a collaborative effort 
between Ames and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Pasadena, CA.

    "The goals of the Remote Agent development are two-fold:  
to reduce the cost of exploration, and to extend exploration to 
realms of space where no ground-controlled craft could 
venture," said Dr. Bob Rasmussen, a computer autonomy expert at JPL.

    "Remote Agent should enable future spacecraft software to 
be more easily designed," said Dr. Barney Pell, another DS1 
computer scientist at Ames.  "The first version of Remote Agent 
will be the hardest to write. After that, we can copy it for 
the next mission and make improvements in it rather than 
developing the software from scratch."

    "This is made possible by model-driven software," Rasmussen 
explained.  "Models of the spacecraft\'s components and 
environment are given to the Remote Agent and it figures out 
the necessary detailed operating procedures on its own.  Only 
the models need to be updated for each new spacecraft."

    Given NASA\'s continuing efforts to develop many smaller, 
less expensive science spacecraft, "we also need to perform 
each mission with less than a dozen ground controllers instead 
of the hundreds of people now needed to run a major planetary 
science mission," said Dr. Brian C. Williams, DS1 team leader 
for the development of the Remote Agent fault protection 
software.  "The large distances inherent in planetary 
exploration result in communications that can be too slow 
during emergencies," Pell added, "and sometimes your 
communication pathway is blocked when a planet is between the 
spacecraft and Earth."

    Three parts of Remote Agent will work together to 
demonstrate that it can autonomously operate a spacecraft:  
High Level Planning and Scheduling, Model-based Fault 
Protection (also called Livingstone) and Smart Executive.  
"Some estimates show a 60 percent reduction in mission costs 
using Remote Agent.  The software would replace a large section 
of the human spacecraft control team back on Earth," said Dr. 
Nicola Muscettola, team leader for the planning software. 

    The High Level Planning and Scheduling part of Remote Agent 
will constantly look ahead to the schedule for several weeks of 
mission activities.  "Planner is mostly concerned about 
scheduling spacecraft activities and distributing resources 
such as electrical power," Muscettola said.  "The Planner 
allows a small spacecraft control team on Earth to command the 
spacecraft more effectively by sending goals instead of 
detailed instructions to DS1."

    "After DS1 we want to work on even more autonomous 
spacecraft that could reconfigure themselves.  If some part of 
such a spacecraft performed differently during the mission than 
expected, the craft would be able to detect this and change 
software models and algorithms to self-adapt," Muscettola added. 

    "Future systems also should be able to learn about their 
environment and act in partnership with scientists to find and 
analyze new discoveries," said Dr. Guy Man, the co-leader of the
New Millennium Autonomy Integrated Product Development Team at JPL.

    The fault protection portion of the Remote Agent, known as 
"Livingstone," functions as the mission\'s virtual chief 
engineer, according to Dr. P. Pandurang Nayak of Ames.  "If 
something should go wrong with the spacecraft, Livingstone 
would use the computer model of how the spacecraft should be 
behaving to diagnose failures and suggest recoveries," Nayak said.

    Livingstone was named for David Livingstone (1813-1873), 
the 19th century medical missionary and explorer.  "Like David 
Livingstone, the Livingstone computer program is concerned with 
exploration and the health of explorers," Nayak said.

    The third part of the Remote Agent software, Smart 
Executive, will act like an "executive officer" of the mission, 
issuing general commands to fly DS1.  "The Executive has to be 
able to execute the plans that are produced by the Planner and 
Livingstone," said Pell.  "If the Planner had to worry about 
every single detail, it would be hard pressed to produce a 
plan.  So, the Executive takes care of the details."

    The Executive also can receive a plan directly from ground 
controllers.  "However, if the ground\'s plan won\'t work, the 
Executive can say, \'Sorry, Ground, I can\'t do that,\' " Pell 
said, comparing Remote Agent to Hal.  "This can actually be a 
big help to ground controllers who must currently spend 
enormous effort double-checking every command," said Rasmussen.

    "In the event that the Remote Agent won\'t cooperate under 
some unusual circumstance, we will be developing a surgery mode 
where ground control can really get into Remote Agent and do a 
lobotomy," Pell added.  "Remote Agent may someday lead to 
software that would be incorporated into a space robot that 
would be as intelligent as HAL 9000."

    The New Millennium program "has accelerated technology 
development in spacecraft automation by at least ten years," 
Man said.  "The Remote Agent will open up new exploration 
opportunities for us, allowing us to really begin the in-situ 
era of space science." 

    The ultimate goal of the New Millennium program, according 
to Wesley Huntress, Associate Administrator for Space Science 
at NASA Headquarters, is to generate and validate technology 
"to allow us to build a fleet of these smart spacecraft, called 
spacecraft constellations or armadas, and let them explore 
different places, share their findings, and even divide amongst 
themselves the work of achieving complex scientific goals. 
Systems like the Remote Agent will be crucial supporting 
components of this vision."  

    The New Millennium program is managed by JPL for NASA\'s 
Office of Space Science and Office of Mission to Planet Earth, 
Washington, DC.

No, I was referring to PLASMAK or SPHEROMAK reactor vessels.  Both of these are
spherical in shape, and use magnetic fields for both plasma containment and heating.
I don\'t know much more about them however.  For the purposes of Traveller, I like 
a reactor designed by Farnsworth & Hirsch in the late sixties.  It is spherical, and 
uses electric fields to contain & heat the hydrogen plasma.  Test reactors were
built that unlike TOKAMAK, had a very stable plasma with a respectable nuetron
output.  The device was never scaled up, and further research was halted.

Two other reasons that the this reactor architecture was never used were the
death of P.T. Farnsworth (of ITT Farnsworth Research Corporation) and the 
appointment of Robert Hirsch to head the US Fusion program.  Once Hirsch
became head of the  fusion program, he directed the money into Tokamak reactor
systems.  He now regrets that decision, and has for the last few years been
trying to convince fusion researchers to look into other types of reactor to 
achieve a commercial system.  The reactor that he and Farnsworth were 
working on is his main aim (Inertial-Electrostatic Confinement).

The continuous stream of roadblocks to fusion power via Tokamak reactors
has apparently convinced him that other methods may provide an answer 
somewhat sooner than the decades or centuries required to design a viable 
commercial Tokamak reactor.  Laser fusion may be an answer, but I tend 
to think that it is nothing more than a way to fund big science.  I am a firm 
believer in the KISS method of engineering (Keep It Simple Stupid), and 
both laser and tokamak systems don\'t adhere to that rule.  The issue of 
complexity becomes even worse when you want to build and operate 
that (oh my god! Big and very Radioactive(!) What if it blows up like Chernobyl)
reactor in the regulatory environment of someplace like the U.S.A..  The 
overengineering and extra safety interlocks and 5000 workers to maintain it
will take a huge chunk out of any profit it might have made.  Fusion 
power won\'t be economical in the US unless it\'s small, easy to build and 
maintain, and cheap to operate.  Of course you could probably build it in
France and make a good profit, they understand the difference between
bombs and power plants there.

Well, the wife is yelling at me to get to bed (its 2am).

Ah, I am familiar with them. The reason that they were dropped was because
they rely on magnetic bottle compression (basic PVT) to help heat and
stabalize the plasma. As you scale them up they leak like a sieve because of
the non-linear (don\'t remember the exact power relation) relations involved
(E=mv^2, F=ma, p=mv, loss::v^2, v::E,T,q,p).

I am curious about your statement regarding neutron output, for a given mass
of plasma under identical PVT conditions there should be a fixed amount of
neutron output irrespective of geometry (ie spherical v toroidal) because
the neutron output is related to the number of molecules (or particles)
involved in the reaction. Also the effect on the container should be
identical for a given time period. In both cases the neutrons are going to
pass through the magnetic bottle (being neutral charge) and since in both
cases the plasma is fully surrounded all neutron output should be absorbed
in the liner. A torus has less surface area than a sphere for a given radius
[1]. Which means the plasma should absorb more neutrons per unit surface
area. While this means that the liner wears out quicker in a torus it also
costs less to replace as well as costing less to contain the plasma.

Consider [1],

I\'ll take a stab at that.  

If I had to describe Travelleresque art in one descriptive sentence, 
I would say that:

 Travelleresque art depicts believable images of what we expect the 
item (vehicle, space ship, piece of equipment, etc) to really look 
like in the future.

For instance, look at page 79 of the CSC.  I can buy that the grav 
fighter would look like that, and I can even see the grav bike, 
although I\'m not fond of the design, looking like that in the 57th 
century.

But, under no circumstances can I see a civilian ATV looking like it 
does on the page.  This thing looks like those cartoony stickers I 
used to get on baseball type cards, with a stick of rock hard gum, 
back when I was in grade school.  

I could easily see flames coming out of the side pipes in the 
drawing, but I can\'t imagine a vehicle really looking like that.

So, bottom line, in general, for me, is does it look real--or does it 
look like it could be real given the circumstances in Traveller.

close enough -- given that we have no idea from the pitifully inadequate
game stats as to *exactly* what goes in them. What doesn\'t even come
*close* is the prices.

For example, the Type S Scout/Courier comes in at around 66 MCr (without
discount) assuming that they don\'t have Exploration quality sensors, or 108
MCr if they do. The 200 ton Free Trader comes in at around 53 MCr. The
Broadsword Class 800 ton Mercenary Cruiser comes in at around 700 MCr.

for the fact that the figures given in T4 are 21.75 MCr, 30.75 MCr and
285.352 MCr, respectively.

Ergo, either there\'s something badly wrong with my maths (and I\'m pretty
certain that there isn\'t) *or* the system provided in Starships is

Somehow I don\'t think that FF&S, nor it\'s proponents are to blame.  If
the system is internally consistent, then it must work.  If the printed
values are off, then I would guess it\'s time for some more errata.  The
examples that you use are rather poor in my opinion.  The scout and
mercenary cruiser weren\'t designed by any of us.  My guess is that with
those, Perrin pulled the various figures out of his ass (you can tell by
looking at other ships that he didn\'t use the system).  For that, you
can blame the author.

As for the Free Trader, the listed price is the same as the one in T4.
Unfortunately, all ships in T4 were created with QSDS, and thus offer a
*substantial* discount since they are *stock* ships.

Actually, there\'s probably a good chance that all of those ships were
designed with QSDS.  Kind of funny that IG would publish ships created
with one system and then publish another system ALL IN THE SAME BOOK.

The system works.  Unfortunately, the rest of the Starships books points
out just how badly IG screwed up!!!  8(

A good question, and one you might ask the authors of _Trillion Credit
Squadron_. According to _TCS_ it takes roughly 8-10 weeks to reactivate a 
ship that has been laid up in ordinary. Once that is done it is completely
battleworthy. There is no mention of any reduced efficiency until the
ship crew has shaken down or anything like that. Logically there would be
such a reduced efficiency for some time, but apparently it is not severe
enough to be simulated with the _High Guard_ combat system. That could be
for several reasons. Two that I proposed yesterday was that perhaps space-
ships are much easier to operate than medium-tech surface ships or that
the 1% maintenance fee (1/10th of what it costs to keep a ship active, but
10 times the cost of an annual overhaul) includes the training of reserve 
crew (say, for one month per year). Also remember that the crew could at 
get 6-8 weeks of training while the ship is being reactivated. Apparently
that is enough.

Btw. here\'s my suggestion for several other way to keep navy reserves. Note
that these are house rules, not an interpretation of official rules:

Mothballed:  The ship has been completely shut down, pumped full of inert
	     gas, bagged, and stuck inside a convenient asteroid.
In ordinary: Ship is powered down with a small caretaker crew. It recieves
	     a perfunctory annual overhaul. (This is what I think the level 
             in the _TCS_ rules is).
On standby:  Ship is manned for 72 days per year and maintains a skeleton
	     crew for the rest of the year. Effectively the ship is
	     available for duty (at its base only) 2 months per year. When
	     a lot of ships are maintained in this way they are usually
             active in six staggered lots.
 

		Maintenance	Activation

Mothballed:	      0%	    25% (ie. a major overhaul)
In ordinary:	      1%	    10%
On standby:	      4%	     1% (and min one week)
Active:		     10%	     0%

You miss the point. I\'m not saying that most Vargr emperors wouldn\'t feel
tempted and/or forced to send some of his fleets off to invade Corridor. 
What I\'m saying is that if he has two brain cells to rub together he won\'t
send off more ships than he retains at home. Given that a successful Vargr
admiral would have both increased charisma and a battle-seasoned fleet 
when he came home, any emperor would be wise to retain quite a lot more 
than half his fleet at home. As it is he is propably waving goodby to any
fleet he sends off. That being so his best bet is to send off only a token 
force to keep his subjects happy. That\'s bad news for the medium population 
worlds in Corridor, but the high-population worlds would still be very
tough nuts to crack.
 
However, I\'ve decided to back down a bit on my position wrt. Corridor (but
not wrt. the Domain). See my reply to Steve Bonneville elsewhere.

Essentially it would have to be more un-Vargrlike. The picture I have of
Vargr society is that it is so disorganized that the concept of umpteen
billion Vargr paying full taxes to any one government, and of 500 TCr
Squadrons cooperation effectively for long enough to overwhelm the
defensive forces of a high-population world just isn\'t plausible.

However, I\'ve decided to back down a bit on my original claim. Essentially
I felt that the Vargr invasion of the Domain of Deneb and the conquest of
Corridor involved an unbelievably long string of low-propability events
and circumstances and that even without taking the Domain into account,
the Corridor conquest alone was unbelievable.

Now, after it has been pointed out to me that Kukhish didn\'t fall at all, 
that Plunge didn\'t really fall as much as sell out, that another planet
fell by treachery, that the Vilani Empire did take over several subsectors,
and that similar circumstances propably apply to other high-population
worlds, I have changed my mind to a degree. I will agree that the conquest
of Corridor only involves a not-quite-unbelievably not-quite-so-long string
of low-propability events and circumstances. Hence I have to admit that it
could have happened. And since it could have happened, and since GDW says
it happened, well, it happened. I still think that in time the Vargr would
have found occasion to change Corridor\'s name from the "Devoured Sector" to
the "Undigestable Sector", but since the Virus made that point moot I won\'t
go further into that.

What I still think is unbelievable is that the Assemblage of 1116 and the
other governmental and quasi-governmental groups of Gvurrdon and Tuglikki
could muster the strength to invade the Domain of Deneb, let alone capture
anything. I can\'t see Norris strip his Vargr border completely (and, in fact, 
even the official history tells us of Domain fleets fighting the Vargr). The 
military reserves of the Domain are formidable, no matter what assumptions 
are made about the state of its reserve fleets (btw. \'reserve\' is sometimes 
used synonymously with \'subsector\' and \'colonial\' forces; I use it only to 
mean ships laid up in ordinary). The colonial forces alone should be able to 
turn back the Vargr even if all the regular fleets have been moved to the 
Zhodani border and it just dosen\'t make sense for Norris to keep on beefing 
up his defenses against the masterfully inactive Zhodani at the expense of 
several subsectors where there IS enemy activity. And even without 
withdrawing any of the forces sent to the Zhodani border in the first weeks 
of mobilization, reserve and replacements ships alone would provide several 
full fleets in the first year alone. And the first load of NEW construction 
will be ready in less than two years. That\'s the end of 1118. So what are 
Vargr forces and Aslan _ihatei_ doing inside Domain borders in 1120?

I don\'t know about all of the designs in _Starships_, but mine were 
designed with QSDS 1.0, then re-designed with 1.1,then re-redesigned with 
1.2.  Then it was time to turn them in.  In that time, SSDS hadn\'t been 
completed (it was completed a week later or something like that, IIRC).  
QSDS was the only choice, if I wanted to respond to Don Perrin\'s call 
for ship designs by the deadline given.

This was all back before T4 was even released.  June or July of 96.

So naturally the designs will vary to whatever degree QSDS 1.2 differs 
from 1.4, and from SSDS.

I imagine the other folks who designed ships for _Starships_ were in the 
same boat.  We did our best, given the constraints placed upon us.

If the book had been released on time, it would have been understandable 
that the designs aren\'t up to spec for SSDS.  Unfortunately, for whatever 
reason, Don Perrin didn\'t design and/or re-design the ships in the book 
in the extra time he had, once SSDS was available.  Nor did he seek 
revisions from contributors.

So, as has already been established previously, the Starships book is 
pretty useless to those interested in accuracy of design, except for 
SSDS.

After Allen gives his SSDS seminar on IRC, perhaps I\'ll re-design my 
contributions to _Starships_.  If I do, I\'ll post them here and send them 
to IG.  Perhaps they\'ll use them in the next printing of the book.

    'body' => 'Some more thoughts on vehicle designs. Looking through the ones in the CDC
and doing a mental reality check on some of them (having been prompted by
looking at 101 Vehicle and the ludicrous design/durations there), I noted
the following --

TL12 Grav Tank - 250 hours duration (0.75 tons), but no extended life
support.
TL12 Grav Truck - 2000 hours duration (0.12 tons)
TL12 Rolen Politesse - 400 hours duration (0.15 tons)
TL5 Heavy Tank - 20 hours duration (4 tons)

I suppose the Grav Tank, Truck and Car are arguable as for duration -- but
for all of them there seems no operational need for such long periods to be
catered for between fuellings, and the cost in possible cargo (or
munitions) space is not inconsiderable.

However, the TL5 Heavy Tank is inexcusably overfuelled -- 4 *tons* of fuel
(4000 liters, more or less) in a TL5 (thats about WW2 Terran equivalent!)
tank?! You *have* to be joking, even modern tanks would be hard pressed to
carry more than 10 hours worth of fuel!

It weighs in at around 51 tons --equivalent to a Centurion (late WW2 tank)
and is armed similiarly as well. Both use a petrol rather than diesel
engine. The Centurion has a roadspeed of 34.6 km/h, close enough to the 45
km/h of the CDC design. The Centurion carres 1037 liters (say a ton) of
fuel and has an operational radius of 190 km (say 6 hours). What does it do
with the rest? Carries heavier armour, I would suspect. At this TL, we are
*not* going to see Tanks with the sort of 20 hour duration suggested here.
Why? Because they\'ll be blown away by the tanks with teh 5 hour duration
and the bigger gun/heavier armour. There is really no need for the amount
of fuel carried either, as, as any Tanker (or wargamer, or military
historian) will tell you, tanks rarely operate for 5 hours *continuously*
at a time even in battle -- and if they\'re cut off from logistics and
resupply, it won\'t matter if they\'ve got a 200 hour duration.

I guess this goes back to the ludicrous operational durations of the
Megatraveller era. It makes some sense for vehicles that a Fusion or
Fusion+ powered as the fuel volume may be quite small (or may not be, as
noted above), but for vehicles that operate in a well serviced civilised
area, there is no reason to carry more than 5-10 hours at most at a time.

Think about it -- how much petrol does your car have in its petrol tank? 25
liters in mine (more or less). That does me for a whole week of driving,
more or less, and that\'s around 200 km or so, on average (actually, its
probably closer to half a tank for a week). So, obviously, most of us don\'t
drive for 200 km nonstop most of the time -- we commute to work, to the
shops, to pick up the kids, to go to dinner or whatever. If I was on the
highway I\'d probably have around 5 hours duration nonstop at around 100 kmh
- -- but most people don\'t drive that way. And the designers would tell you
that the space allocated to the extra fuel would be better spent on more
interior room for passengers and/or luggage.

Military designers have different aims, but they basically don\'t want fuel
in there that doesn\'t need to be any more than a civilian designer.

The only exception that I can see to this would be exploration vehicles --
and they probably should be carrying external tanks or fuel as cargo
anyway.

So, just a suggestion, lets not have too many pre-Grav vehicle 200 hour
duration City Cars! Doesn\'t make sense. Just a thought.

What I seem to be reading is that Travelleresque art is supposed to
take into account the laws of physics as we know them and as they are
postulated by Traveller design sequences. It is also supposed to be
true to the design parameters provided by these same sequences (such
as volume, mass, material strength, etc.).

So we\'re talking about art which agrees with the engineering adage of
"form follows function"?  A great idea but a little tough for
commercial artists who have never played Traveller, let alone walked
through the design sequences which, we all pretty much agree, are
broken. And this is assuming someone tells them which one is
"official" (T4, QSDS, SSDS, FF&S, High Guard, CT).

Sounds like we want a commercially successful artist with a deep
understanding of engineering concepts and with experience
generating Traveller designs.

I don\'t know about stats but Revel I think it was put out a model kit for 
it a few years back, it probably had stats.

	IIRC correctly from writing SSDS, it was supposed to be _10_ (ten)

A couple of months ago I saw a book on the technology of the Aliens movies,
but I can\'t recall the title. The Colonial Marine APC was in there, along
with some stats. Budgetary constraints precluded the purchase of the book at
the time; but it as at a Barnes & Noble bookstore.

May still be in print. Oversized; like the Star Wars technical books.

	Neither. The official answer is convert the FF&S value using the USP
table, and then multiply by 10.

This is what I like most about Traveller; and what makes Traveller the most
unique of SF RPG games. The ease with which we can merge from our fictional
universe into the real one.  Out of the original group of gamers I lead thru
CT, one was in jr high, doing moderately well in school, but not focused on
a career orientation, till he got hooked on the concept of ship and
equipment designs. Last I heard of him some years back he was on the way to
a career in aeronautical engineering. Let\'s see if TSR or Games Workshop can
claim that kind of motivational effect for their games.

Most of these discussions seem to have focused on the military side of the
Vargr incursion and the surprising success thereof. What about the political
side of the question? Did Corridor fall because it\'s military failed to
protect it or did Corridor fall because the politicians failed to let the
military perform their function? Political expediency has cost more people
their freedom than military failure has. 

With the psychological effect of the Imperial fleets being withdrawn, did
government officials in Corridor make bargains with the proverbial devil
rather than take a chance on a real fight?

Ah, okay.  I don\'t have FF&S, but I\'m assuming the SSDS armour value
is equal to that.  For example, in order to get an armour value of 10,
I need to multiply the basic armour volume by 20.

While I\'m on the subject, how do CSC vehicle armours compare to FF&S?
I was trying to mesh CSC with the Striker II combat system, and some
of the armour values in Striker II seem far too high to have been
created
with the third power law in CSC.  The Trepida would require many meters
of superdense to get its >300 frontal armour value.

I think that you are taking it a little too literally here--which is 
what I was afraid of.  This is why I kept stressing "general" 
statement.

No, I don\'t think that we are requiring a Traveller artist to be that 
familiar with generating Traveller designs--although it helps.

Look at the cover to CSC, for an example.  I think that this is very 
Traveller, and this was something Foss did a long time ago.

And it passes my test--the ship, the explosion, the equipment, the 
man in the suit look believable.  It is Travelleresque--and Foss was 
not familiar to generating Traveller designs when he created the 
piece.

So, let me make my basic criteria for Traveller art a little more 
simple.

<in Clint Eastwood\'s voice>

"You\'ve got to ask yourself one question...does it look believeable?"

"Well, does it, punk?"

For me, there are very few pictures in the CSC that do not pass this 
test.  I wasn\'t expecting to accept many of them much less like a 
few.

Here\'s the ones, IMO, that do not pass the test (and this doesn\'t 
mean that I prefer all of the other ones--just that they pass my 
believeability test and I can buy that they could exist).

Don\'t Pass			Pass				Like

One of the points the prof made was that the old adage that you have 
to make ten customers very happy before you can make up for the 
damage that one dissatisfied one will do is true.

What do these thoughts have to do with Traveller?  Well, I just 
bought the CSC, Aliens, and JTAS today, and I\'m calling in the 10 to 
stand up.

Most of us dogged Starships pretty well, and rightly so.  But, I\'ve 
gotta say that I\'m not seeing that kind of uproar, either way, for 
any of these three new products.  I believe that IG deserved the 
pounding they got for that crap of a book, Starships, but I also 
believe that when they do something right, then we should shout with 
the same fiercness that we do when they screw up.

C\'mon everyone!  These three products are LIGHT YEARS ahead of 
Starships in terms of quality and worth.

Yeah, there are still a few problems, and I have not read any of 
these three yet, but I can tell just by flipping through them that 
they are going to be good supplements for me.

I want to start a different kind of uproar.  I WANT TO LET IG KNOW 
THAT THEY HAVE TAKEN A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION!  

I like CSC, ALIENS, and JTAS, and I want to let them know that this 
is the type of stuff I want to see.  This is one small step for 
IG--one giant leap in makeing Traveller what we all want it to be.

Let\'s take a look.  Here\'s my rundown:

The CSC.

Aesthetics:  One of the things that I always like about Traveller was 
that it\'s supplements were more adult oriented.  I liked that.  I\'m a 
fan of the little black books.  This was much better than the cruddy 
drawings that graced the cover of the D&D stuff at that time.   

MT came along with inconsistent art.  Some was great, like the cover 
to the Rebellion Sourcebook--and other items were not so great.  

TNE?  Well, let\'s not go into that.  I think whoever was in charge of 
the art for that game should be shot.

And, that brings us to T4.  I\'ve got to admit, I like the black motif 
with the red border. I don\'t know if they\'re planning this, but a 
good idea (and they may have already thought of this) is to have the 
different melieu distinguished in different trim color.  In M0, we 
can see that it is red.  Maybe M200 will be blue.  I like the tie-in 
with the old, little books in this manner.

 Another thing I\'ve got to admit, I like the 
Foss cover pic.  It was one of the few that I liked in Starships.  It 
looks like an exciting Traveller campaign--a ship blowing up, the 
character shielding himself with a piece of the hull.  This guy\'s in 
a world of hurt, and it looks like this is one of my campaigns.

Surprisingly, I don\'t mind many of Foss\' equipment illos either.  I 
still think that they could be done better

	If I\'m following you right, that\'s correct. Maybe another example, just to
make sure. 

	The armor value used when designing the hull is the FF&S armor value. This
represents the equivalent thickness of hard steel needed to provide the
same protection. So armor factor of 200 represents the protection which
would be provided by 200cm of hard steel. Multiply this armor value by the
volume factor to get the volume occupied by the armor.

	At the end, when you\'re calculating the ship\'s armor rating for the USP,
you use the USP conversion table and then multiply by 10. So FF&S armor
value of 200 becomes 6, then multiplied by 10, for a final Basic Combat
System rating of 60.
	
>
>While I\'m on the subject, how do CSC vehicle armours compare to FF&S?

	Not at all. Greg used a different armor system and completely different
base factors.

	They weren\'t. The Striker II combat system uses the same armor system as
TNE and FF&S. There is no easy way to convert from that back to the system
Greg used. What you have to do is determine what the armor material in
Striker II was, divide the armor factor given in Striker II by the material
toughness from FF&S to get the thickness of that armor, raise that
thickness to the 0.33 power, and then multiply by Greg\'s (completely
different) material toughness value.

Yup.  And by extension, that last is why I\'m late to work when it snows - 
I leave early enough to compensate for driving slower, but not to 
compensate for 2 hours spent crawling along as every danged driver has to 
stare at a fender bender [grrr].  But that\'s another story (and it 
really did happen just last week)...

I was told the same thing - and the converse; for every customer you know 
you\'ve lost (ie, they tell you so), you\'ve undoubtedly lost at least 10 
more.  

Why? Lots of people don\'t say anything, they just stop coming back.  Or 
they tell friends, and those friends never buy from you (or stop buying 
from you if they had been).  

The upshot is: Pay attention to what your customers tell you.  Sometimes 
the customer is just a hothead or is just unreasonable, so you placate 
them as best you can.  But most of the time your customers are doing a good 
service for you - they\'re telling you how to succeed.  Listen to them, 
and you\'ll do well.

And I think IG\'s done a pretty darned good job of that.  Since the reorg, 
things have gotten better (and we have to remember that Starships was 
completed, except for being printed, before the reorg).  There was that 
problem with the JTAS shipping charges, but that was quickly corrected 
(if you subtract the time IG\'s offices were closed for the holidays, we 
got a response one day after they received our complaints).  

The last three products have been very good.  And IG\'s doing more - the 
new web site design (with a customer feedback area and complete errata, 
including major new material to replace the problematic stuff in 
Starships) is a good example.

Well, you know where I stand by now.  My reviews of Aliens and CSC were 
pretty forthright in my apprecation of those products. :)  I gave 
_Starships_ a 50% rating; Aliens and CSC are solid A\'s (95% and 92%, 
respectively, IIRC).

Absolutely.  If no one lets them know when they\'ve done something right, 
how will they know what we like? :)  It\'d be great if folks who like CSC 
and Aliens would write to IG and tell hem so - and ask \'em to give Greg 
and Tim more work! :)


> C\'mon everyone!  These three products are LIGHT YEARS ahead of 
> Starships in terms of quality and worth.

Yup.  CSC is one of the most useful supplements I\'ve ever seen for 
Traveller.  And I\'m not even very interested in the vehicle design 
system!  The rest of the book is so chock-full of good stuff that I it 
brings to mind the best work of DGP.  I love it.

Aliens has some wonderful aliens in it.  Humanoid aliens, and 
completely inhuman aliens.  Each entry has plenty of information.  
Despite the large font, Aliens is densely packed with information, rather 
than art.  And that\'s one of the things *I* like most in a Traveller 
product.


> Yeah, there are still a few problems, and I have not read any of

Yup.  There were a few weights/costs left out of CSC (see IG\'s web site 
for those), and Aliens could have used a smaller font, allowing one or 
two more aliens to be detailed therein. But these are quibbles, in my 
book.  IG\'s taken care of the CSC problems by issuing errata 
immediately.  And as I said, Aliens has so much good information in it, I 
can\'t really complain about the font size.


> I want to start a different kind of uproar.  I WANT TO LET IG KNOW 
> THAT THEY HAVE TAKEN A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION!  

Cool.  Let\'s show \'em we really do know what we like. :)  Let\'s show 
them that we\'re people who love Traveller and want T4 to succeed.  
We let \'em know our thoughts on their _Starships_ product.  Now e-mail IG 
your praise today! :)

I\'m a bit new to the TML, but have enjoyed the days of lurking I\'ve been
doing.  Interesting discussion about artwork, as it happened to match my
feelings.  I\'ve been playing/running Traveller for about 15 years, and
was never content with the quality of artwork produced, particularly for
TNE. Being visually oriented, I\'ve come up with something better for my
campaigns.

My only question is this-why does the 20 year learning curve on starship
design, deckplan layout and art in general steer such a wobbly course? 
When one source produces an excellent design, such as the plans in
Arrival Vengeance, why do the follow on developers not mandate that
quality be continued?  What good are deckplans and art that are nearly
useless in describing the feel of the universe?

IMHO, the game begins with players and roleplaying.  Everything else is
a tool to provide the setting for the mind\'s eye.  Admittedly, I\'ve
mostly designed lately, but only for lack of finding a group in the
wonderful locations I\'ve been assigned to.

As for artwork, I can do and have done better.  Maybe you\'ll see it
soon.  And I like Chris Foss-except for starships with big clawy pincer
thingies and long, flexible snouts.  And US Navy destroyer bridges...

Long live Strephon, and long Live the THIRD Imperium!

Dave, 

From what was discussed on the Beta list it was established that contragrav
limits out at 100 diameters and that thruster plates have a limit of 1000
diameter. If it was to match up with MT it will be the first thing that does. 

I have sent a copy of this message to Greg Porter for the "Official" word on
this, I don\'t thing he paid much attention to the QSDS/SSDS/NAH
rules/discussions and rulings. Nowhere in the "three" can you design a
piloted craft capable of greater than 6g\'s for sustained periods.

By the way are you interested in some 36g missiles that were designed with
CSC/VDS garranteed to restart the killer missile debate.

Bu the way does anyone have data on kinetic weapon damages? Wildstar?

I\'ve been rather quiet of late.  Settling in at a new job with odd hours 
destroyed any habits I had of checking e-mail.  I had a few quick 
comments and questions.

A) I know I\'ve heard about a FF&S mailing List.  I believe its called   
   the Beta List but I can\'t seem to figure out how to log on to it.  If 
   anyone knows I\'d appreciate it.

B) About the Foss artwork.  Well, I agree the weapon artwork suffered 
   greatly in the origional rulebook.  I do like the Foss Artwork but to 
   tell the truth I\'d rather payless or readmore than have tons of 
   artwork. I mean artwork often enhances the writing but if the two 
   aren\'t related!?!

C) I wish to applaud Imperium Games.  Especially Ken Whitman and Marc 
   Miller.  I realize we all complain or make lots of \'suggestions\' 
   about the new Traveller but all things considered I really think that 
   things have gone smashingly.  The T4 that is out now is really good 
   and I like the look of its future.  So here you go a round of 
   applause.

	Applause  
      / 	\\
Applause	Applause
      \\		/
	Applause	:)

D)  I\'ve thought alot about the lack of melee weapons.  Anyone have 
ideas about rules for creating them.  In the last adventure I played I 
ended up using my Foil more than my Laser.  In fact I only 
took 3 shots the who adventure.  (Considered at least 10+ encounters 
with 6+ villians each this is pretty good.)  
	
I mean by TL15 I thought maybe something more advanced than just cold 
steel would appear.  My thoughts lie along the line of vibro or shock 
weapons.  For example Using FFS what if we added a small fuel cell and a 
homopolar generator plus XX volume of miscallaeneous gear and fit it in 
a sword handle.  This could amount to some sort of vibro sword.  
Thoughts or comments?

Ken,

This sounds neat but it sounds like that is the reason for the INFLATED
prices on CSC and AA. Other small game companies have better value for your
money. Example BTRC smaller than SP/FFE/IG, new issue of 3G, more pages per
buck. If the artwork is causing the price to go up, ditch the artwork. Also
about this movie feldercarb, not even gaming giant TSR has pulled off a
movie deal. It does not matter how pretty we wrap garbage in deluxe gift
wrapping paper, it is still garbage just in pretty package. Most gamers want
value for their money, yes a pretty package will attract our eyes, but
content versus value will be the deciding factors.

If it had not been for VDS in CSC I would not have bought it, and I still
feel that I was gouged on the price. As for AA I will wait for my FLGS
quarterly "shelf queen" sale to maybe pick it up.

Okay, that makes sense.  At this point I\'m not going to ask how small
craft like fighters end up with armour values of 8.  It\'s probably tied
to their fuel rating somehow <grin>.

I\'m not quite sure why armour values are independant of ship size,
while structure is not.  However, if we limit ourselves to 5000 ton
ships the difference is probably not too bad.

Yep, so what? I didn\'t buy MegaTraveler 2nd edition, either, I was so ****
annoyed with the ludicrously poor proofreading throughout, but especially
in the alleged Vehicle Design system. Didn\'t buy 2300 AD to replace
Traveller 2300 which was unusable because characters started off with
either 1 Hit Point or Dead, 50:50 chance.

I can\'t think of one other major game company who has *consistently*
mistreated its customers so over so long a period and, to be quite frank,
I\'m at the point where I\'m seriously considering *not* buying any more T4
products that have anything even remotely to do with *game system* ...
unless they\'re by Greg Porter.

Lets see the record so far --

T4 Rulebook - riddled with errors, some major, many minor.Hardcover version
so-called "binding" a joke that will last no longer than the softcover
("perfect bound" -- what I call "self destruct") binding will ... if every
other piddling little game company can do a decently bound hardcover, why
not Imperium Games?

Starships - completely unusable, with ship designs that bear no relation to
the "reality" (as defined by the rules) at all. Incredibly poorly laid out
... for ghu\'s sake, why did they have to put all those pages of
*irrelevant* colour art in one lump *in the middle of the b****y design
system. Couldn\'t they have at least had the common sense to spread them out
through the book?

CSC - Good product, even though the VDS is *badly* broken, entirely because
of the ridiculous constraints that Greg had to operate under.

Alien Archive - an insult to the intelligence. Useless artwork. Mega-sized
print like you\'d get in a kiddies story book -- padding out the page count,
and, of course, the price.

Journal - Haven\'t seen it yet, but the comments on the TML seem to be
pretty negative.

This is a worse strike rate than even the late and unlamented MegaTraveller
managed to rack up. Why would anyone buy *anything* from IG? Like I said,
as far as I can see I won\'t be buying *anything* from IG in future *unless*
it meets certain criteria --

1) No game system material (*unless* its by Greg Porter)

2) Has normal sized print

3) Has no masses of irrelevant and antique Foss *colour* Art (OK, I can -
*barely* - tolerate the B/W stuff, even tho *its* mostly irrelevant, too).

4) Covers background stuff I don\'t have, is "historical" (more or less
"canon") -- but, then, DGP did most of that, didn\'t they?

5) Has been done by someone who has some inkling of using a DTP/Layout
program (for ghu\'s sake, *I* can do better with MS Publisher than IG has!)

I am getting increasingly angry at the slapdash efforts and cavalier
treatment that IG has *demonstrably* shown to all the "faithfu;" customers
out there -- and I wonder how many *new* customers will be so disillusioned
with useless efforts like "Starships" that they\'ll turn to something more
professional than Traveller -- even *Star Wars* is better!

I am *not* impressed.

All above are based on "Armoured Fighting Vehicles of the World" and
various "Janes". Only a handful come even close. And they are exceptions
(the Comet was a "Cruiser" Tank -- light armour and high speed/long range)

Sorry, the figures you gave are, as far as Janes etc. are concerned, wrong.
The T-60 (and the T-28) were cavalry tanks, light armour and a peashooter
gun (and I suspect that, based on the figures above, wherever you got your
figures is wrong and it means that their actual duration was on the order
of 1/2 to 2/3 of what you say it is). Neither would have stood up to a
Sherman - or even been able to do much (if any) damage to one.

As I said, none of the TL5 (and later TL) tanks have much more than 5-6
hours duration -- and all the above figures are based on optimum road
speeds and road ranges. Cross country would be worse. And, of course, the
Allies didn\'t have to worry about where *their* next load of fuel was
coming from, the Germans did.

So? The lack of logistics would logically mean that they couldn\'t supply
them with fuel *if* it was the case. The Russians didn\'t normally have this
problem until the end of a multi-day offensive, when they\'d outrun their
supply lines ... al of them not just fuel. And, in any case, your figures
are wrong, so it seems.

No, like I said, in any normal TL5 military environment it makes little or
no sense. For a light *scout* tank, 10 hours would be Ok, but even that is
stretching it in a major way. No, armour and ammo (or speed) are more
important than an extended duration. Always have been.

Aircraft. And, in any case, the Buffalo\'s main problem was that *western*
aero-tech was advancing so quick when it was designed that *all* its
contemporary designs were outdated when they actually went into service. It
wasn\'t a bad plane *as such*, just compared to its competition.

Yes, and there was (for example) one design in 101 Vehicles that
*explained* why a Low tech vehicle had such a huge duration and a one man
crew -- not convincingly, in military terms, mind you, but there was an
*attempt* to explain.

Maybe an explanation would have made the above designs more palatable, but
I doubt it.

The quick answer is that R,N and S spectral types are cool stars that would
be normally be designated K or M if it wasn\'t for additional strong
absorption lines in their spectra that are not seen in most other stars of
the same colour and mass.

I\'ll see if I can dig out some more specific info over the next day or so.

"Improved" level as in resolution or range or both? What would the small

I\'m not really sure what point you were trying to make, but
I agree that the spheromak and plasmak reactors are difficult
to build and operate.  The Inertial Electrostatic reactor designed
by Farnsworth and Hirsch however used static electric fields
to contain and heat the plasma.  The plasma was stable from 
dc to 44GHz.  If you\'re interested in the research paper, 
complete with drawings and schematics of the vessel it can
be found in: Journal of Applied Physics, Vol 38, Number 11,
October 1967, pages 4522 - 4534.

Below is a graphic of the nested spheres construction of the
reaction vessel, showing the charges present on the two
electrodes.  

 
The inner cathode is a 90% perforated sphere, allowing the 
positively charged ions and  to pass through and be reflected
into the plasma again.  

The paper says that the device was operated over the 
pressure range from 10^-2 Torr to 10^-5 Torr of deuterium.
It also states that they were limited by the existing pump
capabilities.

At any rate the paper extrapolates that a fusion reactor 
based off this design, with a 1m radius vessel, would reach
the self-sustaining point (I think this is called either ignition or
breakeven) at 100MW of power input.

Well, gotta go now, think my wife is going to have the baby now :)

Actually it would be a radically sloped (x2), bonded superdense (x14) for 10.7 cm
(oops, is that 300 in the new system? I am still in the New Era)

Probably not. The most recent developments in melee weapons is the Israeli bayonet. And 
that development turns it into a wirecutter and bottle opener. Melee weapons are useless in a 
modern war, and are used as weapons only if you cannot get a real one (ie a gun)
The only melee weapons development is for crowd control and useless consists of better 
clubs, riot gases and plexiglas shields

I would like to go down on the records stating that all price increases
were invoked after I had official left IG.  I was always againt this and I
too feel  the prices are to high.  $20 was pussing it.  But thats out of my
hands now.

So? I\'ve only gotten CSC, but its adequate at best. Certainly nothing
spectacular. And at that price, I debated for a LONG time to justify
buying it.

Huh? The art in TNE is WAY more provocative than any of that T4 stuff.
I\'ve often found myself staring at the pictures in the various TNE books
and just picturing that scene in my mind.

Ugh! Those B&W stuff were downright ugly. No wonder Foss did so many B&W
illustrations, they were just prelim. sketches.

That\'s a good start at defining "Travelleresque" art.  For each detail in
the illustration, I want to be able to do two things:

(a) Assign that detail to some known component of the design, without
    over-straining credibility, and

(b) Relate that detail to engineering and physics as they are currently
    known, and as they have been extended in Traveller.

Thus, for example, ships with Mech-like claws on the front fail (a), as no
designs I\'ve seen include claws comprising about half the total ship
displacement.

While the various ship-design sequences differ on details, and will
produce ships differing in ratios of hull volume used for various systems,
the broad outlines remain the same in terms of interstellar drive systems,
weapons, fuel, hull configurations (when these were specified),
approximate crew/displacement ratios, and so forth.  An illustration
corresponding to any one of these design sequences would satisfy me in all
of them, within the slop permitted by my point (a) above.

I\'d settle for just a deep understanding of engineering concepts.  Someone
who knows on a gut level that you don\'t stick massive objects out on
slender pylons without a damn good reason, that you don\'t put heavy
aerodynamically meaningless fins on a design without a damn good reason,
and so forth.

I haven\'t seen the JTAS yet, but I agree that the starship book isn\'t
very good. I like the way UCP sheet is, but it do lack some info, as
what kind of drive. Duration in g-hours for reaction drives. And
inconsisties like a UCP-1 laser knocks out a maneuverdrive of a
100000ton ship and so on.=20

But neither was I impressed by the CSC. The equipment is good, but the
design sequences are just laughable. I stick to FF&S for my designs
and adapt them to T4 characters.

The Alien Archives (AA) I liked. It gave room for new plot twists.
Allthough I did miss our usual aliens, but then again we know most of
them by heart.

In TNE this isn\'t hard to resolve, but in T4 I have my doubts. And

If it won\'t get me thrown out of the temple, I\'d like to question =96-
strongly -- the apparent widespread assumption that that Fire, Fusion, &
Steel ought to be used virtually verbatim as the new tech design system
for T4. As a veteran gamer, Traveller fan, and professional technical
writer, I think that\'s completely frigging insane. Then again, I have a
pretty fair idea as to how this apparent insanity came about:

See, unless I miss my guess, you all seem to be male, highly
intelligent, and largely in your thirties and forties; and you seem to
blithely assume that anybody who lacks that smarts and savvy just needs
to get properly trained. That anyone may not WANT to get trained, may in
fact just want to roll up their sleeves and work =96 or, in this case,
play =96 seems not to occur to you. Neither does the blindingly obvious
truth that it is easier for 99% of humanity to LOOK THINGS UP than to
FIGURE THINGS OUT. Especially when you\'re in the midst of learning
something unfamiliar and new.

In other words, you\'re typical code jockeys.

I work with people like you all the time. I have drunk many beers and
eaten much sushi and had many shouting, fist-pounding arguments with
them while small crowds of non-techies looked on in dismay, not
understanding that none of it was personal. I prefer working with coders
and engineers, because they are brutally honest and monomaniacally
results-oriented -=96 which I like -- and don\'t take it amiss if you are
the same way =96- something I\'m gambling rather heavily on right now. But
the problem is that most of them are out to design the Best System, the
Killer App, come hell or high water, and irrespective of whether or not
anybody but another coder can use it.=20

I, on the other hand, am out to make sure that everybody understands
what the hell they are doing and write it all down in plain English.
These are not usually compatible goals. That which is the best tool for
the job may not necessarily be the best tool for the user.=20

A friend of my uncle\'s owns a 338 Winchester Magnum. It is the elk gun
par excellence. But alas! It kicks too much for my liking. It bruises my
shoulder and scares the crap out of me, for I am not built like a
football player. I will use my 30-06 Springfield, and simply be very,
very careful with my shot placement. The .338 is better. But it is no
good for ME.=20

FF&S is the .338 WinMag of design systems. You guys are built like
football players, so you don\'t notice the recoil. You are coders who
think that everybody should own a UNIX workstation, while most ordinary
people just need something unintimidating that is understandable and
that works. Like a Mac. Or Ellison\'s Internet box. Or an electric
typewriter.

As far as game complexity goes=85 well=85.. how do you KNOW that an NPAW
needs a separate homopolar generator, which must be computed and
included all by itself? Have you built one lately=85.?

Y\'know, my gaming buddies have a favorite term for extrapolative
technologies =96 "bullshittium." You know. Mithril. Adamantium.
Transparent aluminum. Coherent superdense. Lanthanum grids. Orcrist.
Wolverine\'s skeleton. Magic materials with mythical properties.
Bullshittium. You guys are debating the minutae of the physical
performance and properties of things that don\'t even exist; and by
blithely insisting these \'findings\' be included in any upcoming set of
rules, you\'re inflicting this nit-picky level of detail on everybody
else. And you\'re so wrapped up in this cozy superhard-SF cocoon that you
apparently don\'t even realize that you\'re actually just arguing over
bullshittium. To build a successful game design system, it is not
necessary to give everybody a crash course in the True Nature of
Bullshittium.

Don\'t get mad at me. It\'s neat, it adds realism, and I enjoy watching it
from the sidelines. I learn things. I get ideas. It adds verisimilitude.
It\'s why I joined this digest. But it cannot be part of a workable,
marketeable GAME SYSTEM for everybody else.=20

I repeat: T4 is not -- cannot be, if it is to do anything more than T:NE
did (which was to limp along on three cylinders for a few years and then
poop out entirely) =96 an actual blueprint for creating extrapolative
future technologies. It is, must be, first and foremost, a GAME SYSTEM.
At some level, extrapolative physics and realistic levels of complexity
have to take a back seat to user-friendliness.=20

By way of a single example, drawn from the last couple of digests: What
is Striker II? Is it still in print? If not, why must I rely on an
obsolescent, out-of-print work to make the present vehicle design system
fit the present starship design system? And even if I do find a copy,
WHY THE FLYING FRIGGING FRACK do I have to look up two different values
in two different books and perform three different mathematical
computations to find the armor value for one small craft? That isn\'t
practical.

(Anybody ever play D&D back in high school? Remember how they used to
have nineteen different kinds of polearms? and a table recording the
effect of each particular weapon on each kind of armor? Did you ever
meet ANYBODY who ever actually used that? And that blurb on page 114 of
FF&S about having to figure out atmospheric performance for your NPAW
each time it is used. Who wrote this? Did they really think anybody
would do this? What kind of drugs were they on? Why weren\'t they
sharing?)

Toughness? Thickness? The angle and degree of the slope? and =96 Jesus H.
Christ! -- the effect on internal volume? (Does sloping armor help if
the enemy is in a grav tank, shooting at you from above? Do you figure
that out separately? If magnetic shielding is so great, how come it
isn\'t on starships?) Sod that! as the British say. Tell me what you told
me in SSDS =96 how much protection, how expensive, how heavy, how much
room. Et cetera. I\'ll even go to the extra trouble of figuring out the
G-rating and volume of the internal structure, because it makes me feel
all technical. Gives me shivers all over.

Yes, I will gladly use SSDS; and so will a lot of other fierce-eyed
fanatic gearheads who want to custom-build and fine-tune vehicles and
starships that are so thoroughly efficient within the confines of that
particular game system that you will have a small but palpable advantage
over anybody who doesn\'t do the same. That is my thing; my trade; my
evil bag. I am an evil little design mavin, yes I am; I who built a Car
Wars compact car capable of destroying a semi in a head-on collision; I
who built a 35-ton BattleMech with a PPC that didn\'t overheat and
reduced the rest of my gaming group to smoldering snail snot; I, who
back when \'hard points\' still determined how many weapons turrets you
could put on your ship, designed a Fleet Point Defense System of
floating five-ton missile batteries linked together via robotic control,
so that a handful of men could fight the entire invading Zhodani fleet=85.
which we did, and blew \'em to hell, the rotten pointy-headed bastards=85..
ho, ho, ho=85=20

But SSDS is still three times as complex as 80% of the gaming community
needs or will ever use. Wildstar\'s QSDS represents the \'plug-n-play\'
ideal. I freely admit that, and I will never be as thoroughly hard-core
as you guys. Neither will anybody else that I can think of. Certainly
not enough to support a mass-market game system.

Magnetic shielding? Megajoules to megawatts? Designing, building, then
keeping track of -- in an actual game, mind -- the G-rating, speed, and
placement of the missiles you shoot? and the sensor locks and fire
control capacity of the launcher that flings them out there? For each
launcher, for each SHIP? Holy shit and tomato juice, as my Dad used to
say. Do you guys really do this? My hat\'s off to you, but=85 this is NOT
going to sell books beyond the initial printing. It didn\'t for T:NE. It
won\'t for T4.

So=85. how exactly do I suggest that you simplify FF&S without yielding a=
n
inch in hard-SF look, feel, and utility as the basic building block upon
which the entire gaming universe will run?=20

Easy. Fold all those goddam sub-components and sub-systems and
sub-everything-ies into the component itself. You only have to torture
your calculator once, instead of many times. Give the formula in
algebraic terms for all the math people, then for God\'s sake explain it
step-by-step in plain English. For everything. Armor doesn\'t need
slopes, or electromagnetic shielding, or toughness. It needs an Armor
Value, and a weight and bulk based on whatever bullshittium it\'s made
out of. This the real world we\'re talking about =96 the gaming one, not
the futuristic-physics one.

Example: Fold the fire control, homopolar-whatsis, beam pointer, crew
workstation, and tunnel all into one single formula for creating a
spinal-mount NPAW, modified by the tech level, the size, and the power
rating. (Screw figuring out the tunnel diameter =96 assume a default valu=
e
of the best possible: .125 of the tunnel length). Damage can simply be
based on tunnel length times megawatts modified by TL divided by
something else for each range band. What good is any single component
without any other? Why make people jump through all these hoops to do
something that ought to be a very simple, one-step kind of a deal?
Detailed should not equal difficult.

Keep the subsystems and various components. They mark the difference
between hard SF and \'space opera\', which is basically just D&D with a
high-tech glaze. Whole adventures can hinge on getting that one
maddeningly unavailable little doo-dad you need to reactivate the spinal
mount on that relic ship so you can blow the crud out of the bad guys
and save your homeworld. But they should only appear in the section
describing the physics of the weapon or system, along with a highly
detailed =96 and completely optional =96 crit-hit/maintenance list. NOT i=
n
the design sequence. That\'s sadistic.

Same goes for passive EMS arrays =96 why not average the processor, price=
,
volume, etc. into the antenna? Is a sensor array WITHOUT a CPU going to
be any good? Why make some hapless teenager reinvent the wheel every
time they want something new? Stick the processor where it belongs =96 in
a sidebar detailing what passive EM sensor arrays are and how they work,
along with a crit-hit/maintenance list. "Well, sir, when our passive
array took that last laser hit, the (rattle, roll) antenna survived, but
the processor is fried. We\'ll need a new one. It\'ll take (rattle, roll)
5 hours at the nearest starport=85" Mock realism. Internal mechanics laid
bare. Adventure fodder.  Good stuff.

And while we\'re dwelling on passive EMS arrays, eliminate the value for
antenna diameter. Go with surface area alone. "Obviously, if you don\'t
have enough surface area left for the passive array you want, you\'ll
have to go with a folding array, but boy! Are they expensive! And don\'t
try to unfurl it in an atmosphere, or in combat!" That\'s really all
that\'s needed. I can make a good argument that our EMS passive antennae
doesn\'t have to be round. It can be lots of little odd-shaped flaps that
stick up, or even something that looks like a colossal braking parachute
with microsensors embedded in it =96 any bizarre device you can think of=20
to multiply surface area.  Making our hypothetical teenager flip back
and forth and look up how long his hull is versus the diameter of the
antenna will make him refer to two books at once, which =96 although this
may surprise you -- for most people is confusing and annoying. It is a
tech-writing no-no.

As far as missiles go, I already covered that in a long rant to Dave
Golden. To heck with G-ratings. Keep missiles generic and the design of
the launchers simple:

\'Missile turrets are for engaging multiple targets, and for small craft.
Missile bays are for flooding single opponents with colossal doses of
firepower. The economy of their respective designs clearly reflects
this. Missile bays are more volume-efficient, but you can only shoot at
one guy at a time. It\'s a good way to put a lot of lead downwind, which
is good for little things like heroic Imperial system defense boats
(yay!) fighting big things like alien dreadnaughts (boo! hiss!).\'

\'If you\'re designing your own missile launcher, then for each missile
tube the fire control mechanism takes X power & X volume at X tech
level. The standard turrets, barbettes, and 50- and 100-ton bays all
have that junk included in the overall size and cost of the weapons
system. The number of missiles in each volley simply depends on how many
tubes you have. Bigger volleys are obviously harder to stop and do more
damage than little ones, which is why bays are better than little
dinky-assed turrets -- unless the opponent launches nine hundred
fighters at you. Then missile turrets become good again. See?\'

\'When you shoot at somebody with a missile volley, they get to try to
shoot \'em down, much in the same way as you\'d try to stop a laser with a
sandcaster. Since missiles are slower than lasers, the results from
missile fire are computed after everything else(?). But since each space
combat turn is a whole half an hour, and since missiles are assumed to
accelerate at speeds that would turn any pilot into organic goo, they
hit the same turn as they\'re launched... just like in Classic- and
Mega-Traveller, before GDW put themselves out of business by publishing
a game system so thoroughly researched, elegant, and realistic that
nobody outside of a few math geeks from MIT understood it.\'

(I hope I didn\'t piss him off with that. I was mad when I wrote it,
because I had just spent all day designing a Conflict-class destroyer
escort, the pride and backbone of the Arcadian aerospace fleet=85. And I
had to junk it because the bays didn\'t have enough MFD\'s, which isn\'t
explained in the rules; and because even if I added extra MFD\'s I had
odd missiles left over from every salvo, which just plain annoyed me.
None of which is his fault=85 but if some dingbat at an Imperial shipyard
built a weapons system that could only use half the missiles it shot =96
which is what FF&S currently forces you to do with standard-sized
missile launchers -- they would keelhaul him around the hull of his own
ship without benefit of a vacc suit).

Those are just brief examples, but I\'m sure you get my drift.
User-friendly and detailed are not mutually exclusive. Simple does not
mean dumb. For the up-&-coming Naval Architect\'s Handbook, we need to be
looking for little things that we can lump together into big things,
which in turn will form the guts of the updated SSDS. This will enable
us to:

1) Maintain compatibility with SSDS & QSDS (once they\'re reconciled with
each other), and all of the ships designed with the (corrected) current
version of each,

2) Maintain compatibility with all your pet FF&S designs, including all
those high-G missiles and other weird thingies,

3) Keep the faith with the original hard-SF feel of the game, and

4) Enable average functional adults and bright kids with regular (not
scientific!) calculators to spawn a new generation of gearheads that
will make T4 live and breath and jump and become a viable long-term
entity. I dunno about you, but I don\'t want to spend another $200 on
books and then wind up the RPG equivalent of an Amiga owner. I felt that
way before, when GDW went under. Not again, thanks.

To insist that SSDS is acceptable as an intermediate level of complexity
and to leave NAH to the hard-core gearheads like yourselves is simply
not acceptable. SSDS is okay, but it is still only screwdriver assembly
of somebody else\'s pre-generated components. To actually design
something new, you need FF&S, or something like it. And the bugger
simply does not need to be as complicated as it is. It doesn\'t. The
sonofabitch was doomed as soon as it came off the presses. To militantly
insist otherwise will doom Imperium Games to the same slow death by
strangulation as doomed its predecessor.

I am not preaching compromise, but improvement. I\'m trying not just to
complain. I\'m trying to be specific as possible. But the general tenor
of the discussions in this digest seems to hover in a cloud of
high-octane, cutting-edge unreality. If you want to help make T4 a
success, you need to shake that off, and bend your really amazing wealth
of gaming experience and brain power to creating a design system for the
other 99% of the human race.

And no. I\'m not being sarcastic.

Long Live The Imperium!

    'ts-index' => '1997-01-12.be093',
    'body' => 'Hi folks,

I\'m rather dismayed at the number of complaints about IG products that 
surfaced in the last two days.  I was with you during the introduction of 
T4, which was a fiasco (the few major errors, the many minor errors; the 
way the hardbacks were shipped).  I was with you during the _Starships_ 
introduction, which was another fiasco (other than SSDS, the book is a 
loss).  I agreed with many of the complaints, and I worked with IG to let 
them know what we all thought.

Now, though, I\'m at a loss.  Things are much better, and getting even 
better in the future.  Once upon a time, the IG web site was badly 
neglected.  Now, it\'s becoming a great place to get product info, and 
even to discuss the products with their new forums.  CSC and Aliens have 
much much less artwork, and none of it is sitting in the middle of the 
design system.  And both books have a great deal of useful information 
that referees can begin using right away.  Milieu 0 and First Survey 
will be back from the printer on January 23, which means they\'re only a 
month late (as opposed to Starships, which was 3 months late).  JTAS is 
finally out, and it looks pretty good (it could use more articles, but 
then we can fix that by sending our submissions to them).  IG will be 
providing, free of charge, the fixes to Starships, via their web site.  
They\'ve improved their shipping methods.  The editing has improved 
greatly since T4 was released.  The list of things they\'ve done to 
improve T4 goes on and on.


The only pending issues I see are:

1)  Lack of a detailed setting.  Well, M0 and First Survey will be in 
stores by early February.  Whether IG should have released them before 
now is a moot point.  It does no good to complain about that, as IG can\'t 
go exactly fix that now (at least not without a "Wayback" machine[G]).

2)  Graphic Design.  As I reported a few weeks ago, Marc Miller is in 
discussion with IG to bring on a professional graphic designer.  

3)  Price.  As I\'ve said so many times before, the marketplace will 
dictate whether the price they\'ve chosen is correct.  At this point, IG 
is very happy with T4\'s sales.  So, they have no reason to change the 
price.

4)  Design systems.  No design system can be all things to all people.  I 
personally like QSDS a lot, and will have little use for SSDS.  I\'ve 
never designed a vehicle for any system other than HERO, so I doubt I\'ll 
use VDS.  I have very different design system needs than those who want more 
detailed systems, or different approaches to design.  I bet there are a 
lot of folks out there, buying T4, who are not on this list and who will 
never use a design system.  Others will think the design systems provided 
are great.  These lists tend to be very design-oriented, although 
different approaches are advocated.  I forsee this being a contentious 
issue on TML no matter what IG does.

So, where there is a clear, reasonable solution, IG is taking action.  In 
other areas, there is no clear alternative to pursue, so IG shouldn\'t be 
taking any action.

I had expected that, by now folks would be more positive about T4\'s 
future.  Are Ken Bearden and I the only ones who think Aliens and CSC are 
praise-worthy?

Ah, so you do like CSC?  Great to hear it!

But what do you think of the actual text content?  Is the material the

Joe, no you are not the only ones.  You have to remember the 5% rule.  That
rule is based on the idea that you cannot please everyone all of the time.
There are about 500 individuals on this list.  Using the 5% rule, there will
be 25 people that will complain regardless of what happens.  These 25 would
complain if they won the lottery, (eg. it\'s not enough or why do I get a
$1,000,000 annuity instead of cash).  There is a fraction of our society
that can\'t be pleased cuz they don\'t know what they want.

Joe, you are right.  IG seems to be getting their act together.  I am
actually starting to look forward to M:0 and the First Survey.

In a full blown battle, yes, a melee weapon is foolish, but what about a

Another reason could be taht people just haven\'t had a chance to look at
it or take a good look at some of it yet.

Take my case, for example.  I live in Louisiana, where we are, literally,
the last to get anything.  The really big games down here are AD&D,
magic, and sometimes GURPS.  I was lucky, and I mean LUCKY to find a
softbound T4 within a month after its release (I was smart enough to
preorder the hardbound).  I still haven\'t seen Starships, Aliens, or CSC
yet.  When they DO appear (at least in New Orleans) we only see 1, maybe
two copies of an item.  And you literally have to have the luck to win
the lottery to find any magazines besides the CCG mags and Dragon
magazine (Although we just DID get a Barnes & Noble whihc caries Arcane
magazine.)

And I was one of those who ordered a single issue of JTAS #25 when I
ordered T4.  I still haven\'t seen that yet.

What I\'ve seen of the Traveller stuff I have so far I\'ve liked.  If I
didn\'t, I wouldn\'t have bought it.  Sure, I do have some problems with it
like others.  My problem is that I would have liked to seen more detailed
examples of some of the stuff.  I think it would have been smart of IG to
do a walkthrough of QSDS.  But otherwise, I think its pretty good.

Hear, hear! Thanks for getting me off my duff. IG is definitely made
improvements. I *really* like Aliens Archive because the aliens *are*
alien and not just humans in a monster suit. The writeup on the
Controlled was especially disturbing (in a cool kind of way) because
I can see the reasoning for actions taken by the race and the
Imperium (talk about the law of the jungle). Makes me kinda wonder
just how far the Imperium really will go when facing "a clear and
present danger." Any member of the Controlled would make one
incredible subversion weapon...any confusion now as to how the
Imperium moved so far, so fast?

Aside from the errata, CSC is a welcome addition to my collection.
The rules for dealing with temperature are great, IMO; does the
job without being complicated. And after playing Traveller since
1980, it\'s nice to finally have something describing the effects
of vacuum on the human body.

But the piece de resistance was JTAS. I love the idea of having
a publication dedicated solely to Traveller. The 100 Cargos by
Jo Grant (congrats, Jo!) and the short stories help add to the
background atmosphere of the game and not just for newbies.

Two thumbs (and my hopes) up for IG!

Makes sense. My players will be in a similar situation once they
discover a ship built by one of *my* old PCs. He actually ran across
the TL17 world in the Vanguard Reaches and had a ship built which
incorporated some of the Ancient portals from the Secret of the
Ancients adventure. Maintenance is handled by a device called an
Eternity Circuit from Paranoia Press\'s Merchants & Merchandise.

Built using FF&S, the thing is crewed mainly by robots, has a 9G
acceleration rating, Jump 6, and the armor and fire power of a light
cruiser (well, almost). All in a 482 dton hull.

Can\'t wait to see what they do with it. Hmmm...then again...

I also like the idea of vibro, shock, or monomolecular weapons (though
the latter may be a stretch). Given advances in biology and material

weaponry, IMO.

This should be an IG priority.. I don\'t mind Foss art on the covers, but the

My FNSLGS has sold out of everything for Traveller, and has stuff on
backorder, so the prices can\'t be hurting them that badly.

NO!  I loved Aliens, I got ideas from every entry; and CSC had some fun

comment on that.

    'body' => 'I\'m not going to bother quoting, since I only want to make a few points
about the rant.

First off, I am a gearhead.  The highpoint of my week was picking up the new
3G3.  That being said, I can now reveal my dark secret to the list:

In 1983 I dropped out of High School to join the Army.  At the time, I had a
GPA of 0.5, and had failed pre-Algerbra *four* times.  I never attended
college, and depend on my wife to actually code html for my web pages.

However, starting with Striker, I started to make myself learn math, and how
to use a scientific calculator so I could design things.  With
MegaTraveller, I had to learn even more to use World Builder\'s, 3G3, and the
ship design sequences.  The same with FF&S.  (BTW: If you find FF&S complex,
don\'t even pick up GURPS Vehicles 2nd ed)

I will admit, designing ships/vehicles/weapons is hard work, but when I end
up with a good design, it\'s something I can be proud of.

Now, as to the need for complex designs in Traveller.  Traveller is a "hard"
SF game.  There are really only three areas that the technology is glossed
over with hand-waving and technobabble:  jump drive, gravitics, and fusion
power.  Everything else is based on what we know, and best guesses about the
future.

A good example of what happens when you aren\'t rigorous in your design is
the much-abused luxury liner in Starships.  Within a week of the book\'s
release, people were posting about how broken the design was.  The same
thing will happen to me if I toss a piece of equpment in to my game without
engineering it carefully.  My players demand a consistant universe!

Using FF&S, or 3G3, or any realistic design sequence requires some patience,
but the results are well worth it.

I hate to add fuel to the fire, but I think your list of IG\'s problems has
problems of its own.  I\'ll admit I was disappointed with T4 and Starships, but
CSC and Alien Archives were decent books (and I\'ve only seen minor quibbles
about them on this list); I don\'t have JTAS, but other than the subscription
SNAFU (which IG cleared up quickly), I don\'t remember seeing _any_ negative
comments about it, and several positive ones - enough that I am going to
subscribe to it now.

Remember that no gaming company can react as fast as the criticisms can fly on
the \'net.  And have you actually seen the new Web site?  A great improvement!

I guess I\'m still willing to give IG a chance, because I am seeing significant
improvement in things already.  And I don\'t see any point in blasting them for
prior mistakes, since they are already aware of these problems.

Excellent suggestion.  Since Suzette Dollar has walkthrough sessions 
planned for #traveller, perhaps the folks doing those walkthroughs can 
send their example to Dave for inclusion in the web site after the 
walk-through sessions take place.  

Rumors Dept.:  Look for an announcement soon of the new Gearhead night on 
#traveller.  Walk-throughs of QSDS, SSDS, VDS, and 3G3 are in the works.  
Suz has done a phenominal job of making #traveller a great place for 
those who enjoy Traveller to hang out.  Now it looks like she has plans 
to improve upon her success.

<massive snippage>

Speaking as someone who absolutely loves the TNE rules, especially
FF&S in all its complexity, I can only say one thing.

You have a point. :-)

Although I may be everything that you said (good and bad) and proud of
it, I was very happy to hear (before Starships was released) that the
ship/vehicle design sequences and combat were going to be simplified
but with backward compatibility with FF&S. I totally agree that for IG
to succeed, the T4 game mechanics (including the design sequences)
*must* be acceptable by the mass market.

Although Traveller is a "hard" SF game, being a code hacker and system
developer has taught me that a modular design is the *best* way to go
when designing something other folks will be interacting with. The
"plug and play" method works by far for most folks and I was really
hoping that incorporating it into Traveller would help boost its
playability.=20

Personally, I will be staying with FF&S because crunching numbers for
the absolutely most efficient design possible does help me blow away
someone using the off-the-shelf method. That satisfaction is my reward
for number crunching. *But*, when I\'m helping a newbie design
something, I want the design sequence to go fast and easy and that
means "modular".

So before you get tossed out of the temple, they\'re going to have
first deal with me and my FF&S built TL17 Battledress and Arm Laser.

I\'m sorry, folks, but I need to get something off my chest.

If it won\'t get me thrown out of the temple, I\'d like to question =96-
strongly -- the apparent widespread assumption that that Fire, Fusion, &
Steel ought to be used virtually verbatim as the new tech design system
for T4. As a veteran gamer, Traveller fan, and professional technical
writer, I think that\'s completely frigging insane. Then again, I have a
pretty fair idea as to how this apparent insanity came about:

See, unless I miss my guess, you all seem to be male, highly
intelligent, and largely in your thirties and forties; and you seem to
blithely assume that anybody who lacks that smarts and savvy just needs
to get properly trained. That anyone may not WANT to get trained, may in
fact just want to roll up their sleeves and work =96 or, in this case,
play =96 seems not to occur to you. Neither does the blindingly obvious
truth that it is easier for 99% of humanity to LOOK THINGS UP than to
FIGURE THINGS OUT. Especially when you\'re in the midst of learning
something unfamiliar and new.

In other words, you\'re typical code jockeys.

I work with people like you all the time. I have drunk many beers and
eaten much sushi and had many shouting, fist-pounding arguments with
them while small crowds of non-techies looked on in dismay, not
understanding that none of it was personal. I prefer working with coders
and engineers, because they are brutally honest and monomaniacally
results-oriented -=96 which I like -- and don\'t take it amiss if you are
the same way =96- something I\'m gambling rather heavily on right now. But
the problem is that most of them are out to design the Best System, the
Killer App, come hell or high water, and irrespective of whether or not
anybody but another coder can use it.=20

I, on the other hand, am out to make sure that everybody understands
what the hell they are doing and write it all down in plain English.
These are not usually compatible goals. That which is the best tool for
the job may not necessarily be the best tool for the user.=20

A friend of my uncle\'s owns a 338 Winchester Magnum. It is the elk gun
par excellence. But alas! It kicks too much for my liking. It bruises my
shoulder and scares the crap out of me, for I am not built like a
football player. I will use my 30-06 Springfield, and simply be very,
very careful with my shot placement. The .338 is better. But it is no
good for ME.=20

FF&S is the .338 WinMag of design systems. You guys are built like
football players, so you don\'t notice the recoil. You are coders who
think that everybody should own a UNIX workstation, while most ordinary
people just need something unintimidating that is understandable and
that works. Like a Mac. Or Ellison\'s Internet box. Or an electric
typewriter.

As far as game complexity goes=85 well=85.. how do you KNOW that an NPAW
needs a separate homopolar generator, which must be computed and
included all by itself? Have you built one lately=85.?

Y\'know, my gaming buddies have a favorite term for extrapolative
technologies =96 "bullshittium." You know. Mithril. Adamantium.
Transparent aluminum. Coherent superdense. Lanthanum grids. Orcrist.
Wolverine\'s skeleton. Magic materials with mythical properties.
Bullshittium. You guys are debating the minutae of the physical
performance and properties of things that don\'t even exist; and by
blithely insisting these \'findings\' be included in any upcoming set of
rules, you\'re inflicting this nit-picky level of detail on everybody
else. And you\'re so wrapped up in this cozy superhard-SF cocoon that you
apparently don\'t even realize that you\'re actually just arguing over
bullshittium. To build a successful game design system, it is not
necessary to give everybody a crash course in the True Nature of
Bullshittium.

Don\'t get mad at me. It\'s neat, it adds realism, and I enjoy watching it
from the sidelines. I learn things. I get ideas. It adds verisimilitude.
It\'s why I joined this digest. But it cannot be part of a workable,
marketeable GAME SYSTEM for everybody else.=20

I repeat: T4 is not -- cannot be, if it is to do anything more than T:NE
did (which was to limp along on three cylinders for a few years and then
poop out entirely) =96 an actual blueprint for creating extrapolative
future technologies. It is, must be, first and foremost, a GAME SYSTEM.
At some level, extrapolative physics and realistic levels of complexity
have to take a back seat to user-friendliness.=20

By way of a single example, drawn from the last couple of digests: What
is Striker II? Is it still in print? If not, why must I rely on an
obsolescent, out-of-print work to make the present vehicle design system
fit the present starship design system? And even if I do find a copy,
WHY THE FLYING FRIGGING FRACK do I have to look up two different values
in two different books and perform three different mathematical
computations to find the armor value for one small craft? That isn\'t
practical.

(Anybody ever play D&D back in high school? Remember how they used to
have nineteen different kinds of polearms? and a table recording the
effect of each particular weapon on each kind of armor? Did you ever
meet ANYBODY who ever actually used that? And that blurb on page 114 of
FF&S about having to figure out atmospheric performance for your NPAW
each time it is used. Who wrote this? Did they really think anybody
would do this? What kind of drugs were they on? Why weren\'t they
sharing?)

Toughness? Thickness? The angle and degree of the slope? and =96 Jesus H.
Christ! -- the effect on internal volume? (Does sloping armor help if
the enemy is in a grav tank, shooting at you from above? Do you figure
that out separately? If magnetic shielding is so great, how come it
isn\'t on starships?) Sod that! as the British say. Tell me what you told
me in SSDS =96 how much protection, how expensive, how heavy, how much
room. Et cetera. I\'ll even go to the extra trouble of figuring out the
G-rating and volume of the internal structure, because it makes me feel
all technical. Gives me shivers all over.

Yes, I will gladly use SSDS; and so will a lot of other fierce-eyed
fanatic gearheads who want to custom-build and fine-tune vehicles and
starships that are so thoroughly efficient within the confines of that
particular game system that you will have a small but palpable advantage
over anybody who doesn\'t do the same. That is my thing; my trade; my
evil bag. I am an evil little design mavin, yes I am; I who built a Car
Wars compact car capable of destroying a semi in a head-on collision; I
who built a 35-ton BattleMech with a PPC that didn\'t overheat and
reduced the rest of my gaming group to smoldering snail snot; I, who
back when \'hard points\' still determined how many weapons turrets you
could put on your ship, designed a Fleet Point Defense System of
floating five-ton missile batteries linked together via robotic control,
so that a handful of men could fight the entire invading Zhodani fleet=85.
which we did, and blew \'em to hell, the rotten pointy-headed bastards=85..
ho, ho, ho=85=20

But SSDS is still three times as complex as 80% of the gaming community
needs or will ever use. Wildstar\'s QSDS represents the \'plug-n-play\'
ideal. I freely admit that, and I will never be as thoroughly hard-core
as you guys. Neither will anybody else that I can think of. Certainly
not enough to support a mass-market game system.

Magnetic shielding? Megajoules to megawatts? Designing, building, then
keeping track of -- in an actual game, mind -- the G-rating, speed, and
placement of the missiles you shoot? and the sensor locks and fire
control capacity of the launcher that flings them out there? For each
launcher, for each SHIP? Holy shit and tomato juice, as my Dad used to
say. Do you guys really do this? My hat\'s off to you, but=85 this is NOT
going to sell books beyond the initial printing. It didn\'t for T:NE. It
won\'t for T4.

So=85. how exactly do I suggest that you simplify FF&S without yielding a=
n
inch in hard-SF look, feel, and utility as the basic building block upon
which the entire gaming universe will run?=20

Easy. Fold all those goddam sub-components and sub-systems and
sub-everything-ies into the component itself. You only have to torture
your calculator once, instead of many times. Give the formula in
algebraic terms for all the math people, then for God\'s sake explain it
step-by-step in plain English. For everything. Armor doesn\'t need
slopes, or electromagnetic shielding, or toughness. It needs an Armor
Value, and a weight and bulk based on whatever bullshittium it\'s made
out of. This the real world we\'re talking about =96 the gaming one, not
the futuristic-physics one.

Example: Fold the fire control, homopolar-whatsis, beam pointer, crew
workstation, and tunnel all into one single formula for creating a
spinal-mount NPAW, modified by the tech level, the size, and the power
rating. (Screw figuring out the tunnel diameter =96 assume a default valu=
e
of the best possible: .125 of the tunnel length). Damage can simply be
based on tunnel length times megawatts modified by TL divided by
something else for each range band. What good is any single component
without any other? Why make people jump through all these hoops to do
something that ought to be a very simple, one-step kind of a deal?
Detailed should not equal difficult.

Keep the subsystems and various components. They mark the difference
between hard SF and \'space opera\', which is basically just D&D with a
high-tech glaze. Whole adventures can hinge on getting that one
maddeningly unavailable little doo-dad you need to reactivate the spinal
mount on that relic ship so you can blow the crud out of the bad guys
and save your homeworld. But they should only appear in the section
describing the physics of the weapon or system, along with a highly
detailed =96 and completely optional =96 crit-hit/maintenance list. NOT i=
n
the design sequence. That\'s sadistic.

Same goes for passive EMS arrays =96 why not average the processor, price=
,
volume, etc. into the antenna? Is a sensor array WITHOUT a CPU going to
be any good? Why make some hapless teenager reinvent the wheel every
time they want something new? Stick the processor where it belongs =96 in
a sidebar detailing what passive EM sensor arrays are and how they work,
along with a crit-hit/maintenance list. "Well, sir, when our passive
array took that last laser hit, the (rattle, roll) antenna survived, but
the processor is fried. We\'ll need a new one. It\'ll take (rattle, roll)
5 hours at the nearest starport=85" Mock realism. Internal mechanics laid
bare. Adventure fodder.  Good stuff.

And while we\'re dwelling on passive EMS arrays, eliminate the value for
antenna diameter. Go with surface area alone. "Obviously, if you don\'t
have enough surface area left for the passive array you want, you\'ll
have to go with a folding array, but boy! Are they expensive! And don\'t
try to unfurl it in an atmosphere, or in combat!" That\'s really all
that\'s needed. I can make a good argument that our EMS passive antennae
doesn\'t have to be round. It can be lots of little odd-shaped flaps that
stick up, or even something that looks like a colossal braking parachute
with microsensors embedded in it =96 any bizarre device you can think of=20
to multiply surface area.  Making our hypothetical teenager flip back
and forth and look up how long his hull is versus the diameter of the
antenna will make him refer to two books at once, which =96 although this
may surprise you -- for most people is confusing and annoying. It is a
tech-writing no-no.

As far as missiles go, I already covered that in a long rant to Dave
Golden. To heck with G-ratings. Keep missiles generic and the design of
the launchers simple:

\'Missile turrets are for engaging multiple targets, and for small craft.
Missile bays are for flooding single opponents with colossal doses of
firepower. The economy of their respective designs clearly reflects
this. Missile bays are more volume-efficient, but you can only shoot at
one guy at a time. It\'s a good way to put a lot of lead downwind, which
is good for little things like heroic Imperial system defense boats
(yay!) fighting big things like alien dreadnaughts (boo! hiss!).\'

\'If you\'re designing your own missile launcher, then for each missile
tube the fire control mechanism takes X power & X volume at X tech
level. The standard turrets, barbettes, and 50- and 100-ton bays all
have that junk included in the overall size and cost of the weapons
system. The number of missiles in each volley simply depends on how many
tubes you have. Bigger volleys are obviously harder to stop and do more
damage than little ones, which is why bays are better than little
dinky-assed turrets -- unless the opponent launches nine hundred
fighters at you. Then missile turrets become good again. See?\'

\'When you shoot at somebody with a missile volley, they get to try to
shoot \'em down, much in the same way as you\'d try to stop a laser with a
sandcaster. Since missiles are slower than lasers, the results from
missile fire are computed after everything else(?). But since each space
combat turn is a whole half an hour, and since missiles are assumed to
accelerate at speeds that would turn any pilot into organic goo, they
hit the same turn as they\'re launched... just like in Classic- and
Mega-Traveller, before GDW put themselves out of business by publishing
a game system so thoroughly researched, elegant, and realistic that
nobody outside of a few math geeks from MIT understood it.\'

(I hope I didn\'t piss him off with that. I was mad when I wrote it,
because I had just spent all day designing a Conflict-class destroyer
escort, the pride and backbone of the Arcadian aerospace fleet=85. And I
had to junk it because the bays didn\'t have enough MFD\'s, which isn\'t
explained in the rules; and because even if I added extra MFD\'s I had
odd missiles left over from every salvo, which just plain annoyed me.
None of which is his fault=85 but if some dingbat at an Imperial shipyard
built a weapons system that could only use half the missiles it shot =96
which is what FF&S currently forces you to do with standard-sized
missile launchers -- they would keelhaul him around the hull of his own
ship without benefit of a vacc suit).

Those are just brief examples, but I\'m sure you get my drift.
User-friendly and detailed are not mutually exclusive. Simple does not
mean dumb. For the up-&-coming Naval Architect\'s Handbook, we need to be
looking for little things that we can lump together into big things,
which in turn will form the guts of the updated SSDS. This will enable
us to:

1) Maintain compatibility with SSDS & QSDS (once they\'re reconciled with
each other), and all of the ships designed with the (corrected) current
version of each,

2) Maintain compatibility with all your pet FF&S designs, including all
those high-G missiles and other weird thingies,

3) Keep the faith with the original hard-SF feel of the game, and

4) Enable average functional adults and bright kids with regular (not
scientific!) calculators to spawn a new generation of gearheads that
will make T4 live and breath and jump and become a viable long-term
entity. I dunno about you, but I don\'t want to spend another $200 on
books and then wind up the RPG equivalent of an Amiga owner. I felt that
way before, when GDW went under. Not again, thanks.

To insist that SSDS is acceptable as an intermediate level of complexity
and to leave NAH to the hard-core gearheads like yourselves is simply
not acceptable. SSDS is okay, but it is still only screwdriver assembly
of somebody else\'s pre-generated components. To actually design
something new, you need FF&S, or something like it. And the bugger
simply does not need to be as complicated as it is. It doesn\'t. The
sonofabitch was doomed as soon as it came off the presses. To militantly
insist otherwise will doom Imperium Games to the same slow death by
strangulation as doomed its predecessor.

I am not preaching compromise, but improvement. I\'m trying not just to
complain. I\'m trying to be specific as possible. But the general tenor
of the discussions in this digest seems to hover in a cloud of
high-octane, cutting-edge unreality. If you want to help make T4 a
success, you need to shake that off, and bend your really amazing wealth
of gaming experience and brain power to creating a design system for the
other 99% of the human race.

And no. I\'m not being sarcastic.

Long Live The Imperium!

Although the essay is unclear at times, the History section mentions that 
the Imperium that did those things to the Controlled was the First 
Imperium.  At this point (Year 0 of the Third Imperium), just about 
everyone accepts the Official History as handed down through the ages, 
except for the Controlled themselves, who don\'t accept it yet who also 
don\'t know what really happened. 

It may very well be that the government of the Third Imprium itself 
doesn\'t know the real story...yet.  Might make a good adventure to have 
the adventurers uncover old First Imperium records that state what really 
happened.  Then all sorts of interesting ethical questions arise. =)

Yup.  IG recognized that the best people to turn to for the background 
are those most familiar with the previously-published materials.  Les 
Smith is a great game designer, there is no doubt.  But if he had been
required to go back and read all the previously-published history, then 
he\'d still be working on it in January of \'97. [G]  They did the right 
thing in getting some help on that aspect.

Right.  One thing at a time. :)  Maybe by the time Emperor\'s Arsenal

Aliens:  As Tim Brown said to me once, "When I get cut, I bleed black and 
red."  The guy\'s been involved with Traveller from way back.  And he can 
write like the dickens. :)

CSC:  It\'s Greg Porter.  \'Nuff said. :)

As someone who owns the World\'s Greatest Scientific/Programmable Calculator
(HP-48GX) (and otherwise completely matches your profile) and has requested
that there be _more_ formulas in the design system, I must say that I greatly
enjoyed your post and mostly agree with what you have to say.  This has to be
the best-written criticism of a game system that I have read in a long time!

I hope someone at IG sees this post - and IMHO those who are fond of criticism 
should take a few pointers from how this was written.

The main reason that I argue for formulas, rather than huge tables (or perhaps
as a supplement to the tables, so both are present), is that it is much easier
for me to see if the system is consistent and works well by seeing the
underlying _why_ of it all.

A complex system that attempts to model a hard-SF "reality" is great, but
additional complexity also makes it that much harder to see if the whole thing
actually makes any sense!  You can get lost in the details if there are too
many.

You argue for ease-of-use, and that was what I was arguing for also - just 
from different perspectives.  For me, a few pages of well-defined formulas and 
an algorithm to follow when using those formulas allows me to do everything I 
want with a vehicle/component/whatever design system.  I can then happily 
analyze and optimize to my heart\'s content, oblivious to the outside world, 
for hours and hours and . . . ahem.

I think that for most gamers (including me), the ideal design system would 
consist of the following things:

   1  A clear, well-written procedure to follow during the design process 
      that makes no assumptions about prior systems (CT,MT,FF&S, etc).

   2  Well-laid-out, clearly labeled tables for those parts of the design that 
      are most important to get the job done.  As you said, any power or 
      computer requirements for a sub-system should be included in that 
      subsystem, not handled separately unless there is good reason to do so.

   3  Reasons; explanations; the why of it all.  This is something I 
      constantly stress to my fellow software engineers in their documentation 
      efforts - Why something was done the way it was is _the_most_important_ 
      item to record for posterity.

   4  The bullshitium aspects - this is what adds the versimilitude to the 
      game and makes it role-playing rather than an optimization problem (as 
      enjoyable as those might be...).  The SOM was a great example of this.

   5  If formulas are included (as an adjunct to the easy-to-use tables), then 
      PLEASE typeset them as formulas, not as ordinary text!  Just look at any 
      math or physics textbook for ideas.  This was a big problem with FF&S.

   6  Examples; Examples; Examples.  Not just a list of designed vehicles (and 
      _please_ use the same system that is being documented!),  but at least 
      _two_ step-by-step designs covering all of the design sequence.  Well 
      done examples work miracles when it comes to clarifying things (as I 
      learned while teaching two semesters of College Algebra).
      Please carefully proofread everything.  Nothing is more frustrating than 
      trying to understand an example that has bugs in it - "Am I just stupid, 
      or does this not make any sense?"  Frustration is a sure way to lose 
      customers.

Perhaps IG should consider offering you an editorial job!

        My Christmas vacation was rudely interrupted on the 23rd by a phone
call from my boss; as a result I\'ve been working my butt off, am jetlagged
to hell, and missed the first week of classes.  However, there was a
payoff.  I wound up doing a little research on infrastructure project
financing in Asia.  As most of you are probably aware, the upper limits on
economic growth in many Asian countries are imposed by their
infrastructure; insufficient road networks, lack of public transport
systems, insufficient power generation capability, minimal airport
facilities, port facilities, water & sewage facilities, etc...  China is in
need of *all* of the above on a massive scale.

        Many of these countries lack the capital needed to finance these
sorts of projects, which puts them in sort of a bind.  OTOH, put a decent
road & transit system into Bangkok, and the place would boom.  One of the
reasons the Phillipines were lagging behind in terms of growth was
brownouts; your businesses can\'t compete with Japan or Hong Kong if they
haven\'t got power 7 hours a day.  So, the solution is to look for foreign
investment.

<I\'m sure that you can all see where this is going>

        What usually happens is that you get large companies from the
developed world doing the following:

1) setting up some sort of subsidiary or joint venture and doing some
creative legal and/or accounting juggling to limit liability to that sub.

2) getting financing from a variety of sources.  So far, in Asia they seem
to be relying mostly on borrowing from large financial institutions.

3) *kicker alert* getting concessions from the local government; in return
for building the infrastructure, the company behind the project typically
gets to simply own and operate it for a long period of time, like, say over
20 years.  This is typically known as a BOOT (Build, Own, Operate,
Transfer) deal.  You go in, you build your highway or your power plant, and
you make your money from the tolls and bills... and twenty years later, if
your projections weren\'t toally out of whack, you walk away with a nice
healthy profit, and the local government inherits the road and the benefits
of twenty years of having the highway operated for them no-charge plus its
economic benefit.


        Of course, there are risks.  Some of these countries are not
terribly stable (one deal I read about had to be negotiated with 5
successive governments in a short period of time).  Capacity uptake may not
grow as planned.  They\'re huge and complex, and regulatory regimes may a)
be suffocating and protectionist or b) completely non-existent, both of
which can spell big trouble.  All sorts of things can go wrong...  For the
governments involved, planned obsolescence is probably going to be a major
problem.  And of course, these sorts of deals seem to be becoming very
trendy, with the result that some are going to go spectacularly blooie.

        The implications for Milieu 0 of all this are so painfully obvious
they don\'t need mentioning.  The real money to be made in the expanding
early Third Imperium won\'t be in selling fusion guns to local dictators
(peanuts, really), or even selling Fusion+ units to everybody, but rather
in identifying planets where the conditions are ripe for a growth boom.
Then you go to local governments at about TL4 and up, and pitch them a deal
whereby your megacorp will build them a spaceport, fusion plants, a power
grid, a roadgrid system, a telecom system, hospitals, and water & sewage
systems at no cost to the government... and all you get are user fee
concessions for the next century.  Everybody involved wins: the planet
benefits from the infrastructure and massive sustained economic growth, and
you & your megacorp make insane amounts of money, as you\'re running the
power company, the phone company, the water company, the health system, the
toll roads, etc, etc, etc <excuse me where I go do a Mr. Burns impression>.


        Cleon wins, too: the planet of course becomes not only dependent
upon the Imperium, but probably falls under its cultural influence as the
locals start buying up the Imperial equivalent of blue jeans, Scotch,
BMW\'s, and the like...

        So basically, I see the Imperial technology export policy as being
highly infrastructure-oriented.  The sort of high-tech products that would
see the most trade are power systems, transport, communications and the
like...  guns would be way down on the list, if nothing else because in the
long term there\'s nowhere near as much money to be made as there is in
selling butter churns.

I\'d argue Canada, at least Oakville, is the last to get products.  Only T4
product around here is the rulebook, and that didn\'t arrive till October
anyway.  I stil have yet to even see Starships, Aliens, CSC, or JTAS

A quick note, I\'d vouch for Quincy Koziol as a trusted online seller as
well, as his prices are quite reasonalbe, even for out of print stuff, plus,
he gives a 30% off retail price for new items.

Bit gruesome, but something to think about.

I had assumed that some of them were proficient in the types of processes
that the ancients used to make the food for the humans, thereby leading to
the supply and demand structure that lead to the Megacorp that did the food
processing (name escapes me at the moment).

	Hmmmm...Logical, as the pointy eared one would say. The problem
with this is you start to transmit and concentrate things like \'mad vilani
disease\'; things like BSE and Kreutzfeld-Jakobs disease are transmitted
that way. But perhaps this was one of the functions of the
Shugilli...preparing the Other other white meat to minimize this threat.

It\'s hard to say. As far as we know, any case of regularly practiced
cannibalism in humans has been restricted to strictly ritual forms, Alferd
Packer and the odd soccer team aside. However, there are a number of
cannabalistic species, that under certain conditions gladly eat each
other. There is a species of (toad or frog...I don\'t remember which) which
is the major predator on itself.

Hmmm...maybe the ancients dragged along Fava beans, too ;-)

Not true.  The US Army is doing extensive research on melee weapons and
non-leathal weapons due to the increased missions in Stability and Peace
Support Operations.  Things like stun batons, immobilizing spray, and
capture foam are to provide troops with alternative to killing a local national.


At tech level 12 what sort of new melee weapons might be available.  Blur is
a great example.  It cause you to drop your weapon, or temporarily blinds
your opponent.  What about melee weapons will tranq abilities??  Or maybe a
sword that deflects laser blast back at your opponent??  The possibilities
for melee weapons are, like everything else in Traveller, only limited by
your imagination.

manages to finance itself-such a massive entity.  By the time of the
Rebellion some folks have to be wondering if taxes really could even
support the incredible expenditures.  Or tariffs...or anything...

The Imperium is NOT the United States, by a long shot.  It controls not
only the starlanes, but the unclaimed bodies in a vast number of
systems.  Imperial law may not extend to the surface of the governed
worlds, but it does cover the other 99.9% of the system bodies too
useless for the locals.  This is a system by system thing, of course.

In short, the Imperium OWNS those rocks, gas giants, comets, monopoles
and other infinite resources.  Unlike the US Forest Service, it DOESN\'T
charge megacorps a pittance to utiize them.  They pay-A LOT.  But the
profit THEY make is even higher.  

Think of it-most systems will have vast, exploitable resources just
waiting for use, much cheaper than jumping ten thousand tons of ore from
nearby Wherever.  To be a member of the Imperium and enjoy complete
sovreignty, you simply sign this little document agreeing to cede any
claims you have on other worlds to "big daddy." 

The assumption of Traveller is that the Imperium controls the space
between the worlds, if not the worlds themselves.  What this means,
besides the typical control of trade, is that they own 99.9% of its
resources-and sells them.  NOW THAT IS POWER.

	I would be very interested in such a product IFF*

	It contains more than just the T4 stuff--in other words, _all_ (or most)
of the historical material
	- Classic Traveller Rules
	- Classic Traveller Adventures
	- Classic Traveller Supplements
	- All JTAS articles from issue 1
	- Challenge material related to Traveller
	- MegaTraveller rules, supplements, adventures
	- TNE rules, supplements, adventures
	- as much third-party material as can be obtained

		AND

	It\'s in a useable format. To me useable means
	- Should be able to read it without requiring custom software. HTML might
be a good start for the text
	- MUST BE ABLE TO EDIT IT! I want to edit things for my own particular
flavor. Something like PDF is therefore out, because it\'s quite frustrating
to try and get it into something I can open with my word processor/text
editor and graphic tools.
	- Reasonably well structured.

*IFF=If and Only If.

	As a contribution, I have somewhere most of the Red Zone articles from
JTAS already typed in (downloaded from the GEnie forum).

	You also might want to consider seeing if some of us who have web sites
would be willing to allow portions of the material on our sites be included
on the CD-ROM. Personally, I would (with the original author\'s permission).

It would be nice to be able to copy and paste from it into a document and to
be able to conduct searches of the material (ie, Regina, etc).  As a referee
it would be a great resource for gaming.

It consists of an Crystal Iron Blade (equivelent volume to a foil), a

Generator, and an EletroStatic Field Generator.  If anyone is interested 
in exact numbers I can provide them (made in FFS).  

It weighes between 2.5 and 3 kg. And has component volume of 1.8 liters 
(this doesn\'t include the blade).  The cost is about 5600Cr and is a 
TL15 item.  It has enough power in the battery for 18 full turns of use 
(Turns based on 6 second rounds).  (AND YES THE BODY WAS HEAVILY 
RUGGIDIZED FOR MELEE USE).  

Any ideas on how to calculate damage?

At a 85% efficiency (TL15 Energy Conversion) it rated at ~.0085 MW
Now if we go with Laser Damage which is 50*(E^.5) it can do 4D damage 
when powered up and (1D = Foil) or (2D=equivelant broadsword weight)  
when powered down.

This is an exceptional couple of statements.  We are all scratching

The same goes for the vacuum exposure rules.  I think that they are a 
little liberal, but pretty close to the info on the NASA page (I 
think you put me on to that page).  This is the first time in 
Traveller history, that I know of (and I\'ve got A LOT of Traveller 
stuff), that official rules have been given for vacuum exposure.

This kind of stuff makes me excited.

Yes.  I was dark hearted when Challenge incorporated other games.  I 
took one subscription before dropping it because it did not contain 
enough Traveller material.

Yes, the book is a bit pricey, but the CSC is a great book of 
equipment and rules.  Name some other game equipment books you really 
liked and compare them to CSC.  I\'d like to see where you are coming 
from.

You\'ve got to be kidding me!  I\'ve got just about all of the TNE 
stuff, and the art was cartooney crap.  The people did not look real, 
there was kiddie "controls" on the pages of the equipment guide, and 
the covers to all of the major books was dumb.

What TNE pictures are you talking about?  I want to look at the same 
ones you did.

why.

But the thought is still there.  Maybe not enough people have bought 
the three new supplements yet.  I don\'t know.  But,  I do think IG 
deserves a pat on the back.

What I do know is that these three new books are great!  I want to 
see more stuff like this.

Heck yeah, there is room for improvement.  There always is.  

Let me complete my rundown of the three books that was aborted in my 
first post.



The CSC.
The look of the book:  I do like the black motif with red border that 
all of the T4 books are having.  And, the pic on the cover of the CSC 
is good as well.  After the Starships disaster, many people wanted 
less illos, but I like a lot of illos.  I like to see what the 
equipment looks like.  The thing is I like good illos, and I\'ve got 
to say that the Foss pics are getting better.  They are still not as 
good as they could be, but I like them.



Content:  Good stuff!  I like the info, and I really like the rules 
interspersed throughout the book.  I like the approach taken, and I 
like how it was all written.  There is all kinds of stuff in the book 
that I am sure that I will use for years.



The Negatives:  Well, I think the CSC has very few.  One little 
nit-picky thing is that I\'d improve the interior illos and increase 
their quanity, but I don\'t want this little comment to be compared 
with the horrible quality of the illos in Starships.  

The biggest problem that I can see is that, as has already been 
mentioned on the TML, the price is way too much.  I paid $22.50 for 
the book.  I compared this with several same size supplements of the 
Star Wars game (a game which I think is very good), and they ran 
between $15 and $18.  



Final Words on CSC:  The book is a wonderful supplement albeit at a 
premium price.



Aliens Archive.
The look of the book:  Again, nice book!  I don\'t mind the cover pics 
here either--maybe Ken Whitman will be right about the original Foss 
piece coming out.  Although I think that it is strange to feature the 
skeletal drawings as the only picture about each race on the first 
page the race is listed, I do like having them in the book.  I think 
another pic of the specific alien, with skin on it, would be more 
appropriate.

And, I really, really, like the center pics of the aliens.  IG, you 
need to fire Foss and hire whoever did these (Ashe Marler or 
Wildstorm Productions) full time for all of your illos.  This stuff 
is great, exciting, and exactly what I\'ve been looking to see.



Content:  I haven\'t read the whole book, but of what I\'ve read, I 
like it.  Good info.  These are not as indepth as some of the stuff 
DGP used to do (which is what I was expecting), but that is OK.  
There is more than one way to skin a goat.  The AA is full of great 
info that I will use in my game.

One thing that I\'m torn on is the Aliens not being specifically 
placed in the Imperium.

Let\'s look at the hands.  On one hand, I\'m playing in the 1100\'s, so 
I should be ecstatic about transplantable aliens.  I can put the home 
world for these guys any where I want relevant to my campaign.  I 
like this

OTOH, I don\'t like this.  One of the very attractive things about 
Traveller is its very detailed and specific background.  I feel that 
having transplantable aliens is somehow making it less specific.  
Part of me wants to know which part of space these guys are from.  I 
almost prefer that this be detailed eventhough the aliens book is 
more useful to me the way it is.

I\'m at a stalemate on this one, and therefore, for now, I have not 
opinion as to whether this should be changed or not.



The Negatives:  The news we heard about the print being too big is 
true.  It does look like they were trying to fill pages with what 
they had.  This would not have been so bad if the book wasn\'t $22.50. 
 Again, there are much cheaper books out there for other companies of 
the same quality.  Why can\'t IG produce a book that is more in line 
with this price range.  (Yeah, I know.  I\'m the guy who wrote all of 
that stuff about why IG\'s prices might be the way they are, but it is 
still frustrating as a consumer.)

And, I would like to see more pics by whoever did (it is not clear 
from the credits) did the alien illos.  It would be nice to see more 
aliens in action.  As it stands, we have one pic of them, one 
skeletal pic, and one conseption pic.  Give us more.



Final words on AA:  Nice book, great aliens, but at a premium price 
and large print version for the old.



JTAS.
The look of the book:  Ahh, the cover is not so hot.  It looks 
cheap.  Inside, it depends on your reference.  If you are used to the 
old JTAS and Challange, then it is right along those lines.  Nice 
continuation.

But if you want something to blow your socks off, like say, the Star 
Wars Adventure Journal, then the JTAS is a pale comparison.



Content:  What matters most is the content, and I am very pleased 
with what was presented in JTAS.  It has a good mix of good, detailed 
adventures, additional game rules, and even fiction.  I\'d say for a 
first try, good job!



The Negatives:  This is 1997.  There should be no reason we aren\'t 
getting a blow your socks off product.  I refer again to the Star 
Wars Adventure Journal.  Look at one of those, will ya?  It\'s got 
great art, great design, great adventures, great fiction--all in all 
it is an exciting game aid.  

The JTAS is a good Traveller magazine, but I want to be blown away.  
I want to be as excited about the JTAS coming out as I am the Star 
Wars Journal.



Final words on JTAS:  It is a good solid mag, and I\'ll keep buying.  
There is room for improvement, but even if it stays as is, it will be 
a good buy.  I recommend it.



As a business owner, my dad used to say that if the customers are not 
saying anything, then you are keeping them relatively happy.  It\'s 
when they start bitching that you\'ve got to worry.  They will 
rarely go to great lengths to tell you that you are doing a good job, 
but they will walk barefoot through fire to tell you that you aren\'t.

This is what I was trying to say in my abortive first post.  It does 
take 10 happy customers to make up for one unhappy one.  It\'s 
exponential.

Well, I think IG has done a fantastic job on these products, and I 
want them to know that.

I\'m taking the first step.  I\'ll be the first of the 10.

Who will follow?

Kenneth.

Doug, if people ever take the time to study FFS they might discover that it
isn\'t all that complex.  Personally, I think it\'s poorly laid out and
confusing...therefore hard to use, but not all that complex.  GURPS
Vehicles II is pretty much the same way.

As I\'ve said elsewhere, I want a system out there where folks can design
subsystems that conform to QSDS (or a QSDS-like system) for vehicles,
starships, and equipment.  Use QSDS style parts to build lots of things,
"plug and play"...right?  The thing is we need people to create those
QSDS-style components before we can use them!

I also want a system out there where I can build *non-standard* components. 
Maybe I want my universe to use technology like in David Weber\'s Honor
Harrington series:  500g plus acceleration limited by inertia compensation;
hyperspace sails.  Or maybe I want to play with wormhole technology.  Or
maybe it\'s stutterwarp, or ST style warp, or "aether propellers" or
something outlandish like that.

What I want is a design framework available that let\'s me design all those
things, and more!  I want that framework to produce components that can be
plugged together with standard parts, and be useable in the roleplaying and
combat systems.  Preferably, with *any*
roleplaying or combat system, because already with T4 we have at least 3
space combat systems floating around, with more to come.

Getting all that is *bound* to be complex...period.  But if it\'s well
designed, laid out and explained well then the process still should be
fairly easy to use.

Good luck to us all! <g>

T4 is improving with each release. Noticeably.
 There are foibles, however. This magazine has no price tag anywhere
obvious, and the labeling of this as issue #25 is an in-joke that needs
explaining in an editorial. Unless I\'m blind there was no News Service, so
JTAS is not yet the voice of advancing history...

 There are good points as well. Two new artists make appearances here.
While both are acceptable in a Traveller magazine, I hope to see more new
talent (and hopefully some old talent) in future issues. The fiction in
this issue is mercifully short and bereft of gamespeak (As a benchmark,
I consider the optimal example of fiction in a game mag to be the heyday
of Steve Jackson\'s Space Gamer). The scenarios are useful, and the source
articles are all immediately useful (The two page Asym article is easier
reading than their part of the Alien Archive).

 I rate this a fine start.  Lets see more.

Wrong.  I had this discussion with one of my players a while back.  
He\'s an ex-Marine (the player, not the character), and he made a good 
point.

The bayonnet has been standard military issue for over 200 years.  
There\'s no reason to believe that will change.

I think he made his point.

I\'ve been having some private conversations with a number of people over 
just this issue: complexity in Traveller.  I like complexity, but we can 
easily run into real-world problems.  Wait, let me give you an 
illustration. 

As it says in my .sig, I use an Atari 8-bit.  What it doesn\'t say is that 
I wrote a series of articles for a computer publication (Computer 
Currents) that argued passionately for a return to simpler computers.  
One was called, "Do You Have Too Much Computer?"  I program in assembler, 
so my contention was that if everyone would just program in 
highly-optimized assembler, we wouldn\'t need gigabyte hard drives and 16 
MB of RAM.  And I\'m right - compile something in Visual BASIC, then do 
the same thing in hand-optimized ASM.  There\'s a huge difference in the 
size and speed of the resulting executable (I wrote a graphical, 
artificial life program that is interactive and instructive for the Atari 
8-bit; the assembled version is 4 kilobytes.  It ain\'t SimLife, but it\'s 
still a good example of what can be achieved in assembler).  Only thing is, 
it\'s a thousand times harder to train someone to do ASM properly, and it 
takes an ASM programmer a lot longer to write a program - and it is MUCH 
harder for the next person to come along and modify that code for 
version 2.0.  So, it just ain\'t economically feasible to do as I 
suggested, no matter how much I\'d like things to be different.

Those of us who want Traveller to continue being the gearhead\'s nirvana 
are arguing the same thing I did in my articles.  And the argument is 
just as doomed.  IG is in this to make money.  To make money, they have 
to appeal to a broad audience.  As much as I hate to say it, most 
_existing_ gamers don\'t want to do anything but buy a pre-packaged 
adventure and run it with a minimum of fuss.  If IG wants to reach those 
who aren\'t currently RPGers (say, those who play CCG\'s), then they\'re 
going to have to put products out there that are simple to use.

Does this mean there\'s no place for FF&S?  Certainly not.  It\'s in the 
\'97 product lineup, after all. :)  But JayStr\'s comments ring true; if 
FF&S is to sell to more than a relatively few old-timers, it\'ll have to 
be presented extremely well, so as to make it easy for anyone to pick it 
up and begin designing almost immediately.  Yes, there\'s QSDS and SSDS.  
But FF&S/NAH isn\'t going to sell if it doesn\'t allow the average person to 
make designs without taking a virtual course in engineering.

FF&S/NAH must be straight-forward and simple to use.  Explain the concepts 
thorougly as you go along, with good examples throughout.  Keep the 
tables clean and self-explanatory.  

Because, face it: if FF&S/NAH doesn\'t sell, there won\'t be any more 
gearhead-centric products ever again for Traveller.

Hmmm.. sounds like you want an archive.  My wish list would have the rules
in a hypertext format, GM aid software for ship ops, combat and the like..
basically, everything I need to run Traveller from my desk (or laptop, if I
ever get one).

For the intial release. M:0 info would be nice.. a huge listing of ships,
vehicles, and equipment DESIGNED BY US GEARHEADS.

This isn\'t a great requirement for me.  I keep my campaign notes on a disk..
as I said, I want the rules, with explanations and walk throughs.

There are a few cookies I\'d like to see:

- -Graphics of things like the Imperial Sunburst, Military symbols, planetary
insignia, etc. done as a clip art library.

- -The Galangic alphabet, as used in various DGP products, rendered as a True
Type font.

- -The Imperial Anthem in .wav

- -A blank for creating TNS pages.

And, it looks very promising, combine these with the three releases from
GRG, and possible ones from CORE, and it looks like a Traveller 1997!

As Dave Golden says, it has to include more than the rules.  I\'d pay $70 for
the complete T4 rules set, a lot of the classic Traveller materials and
other stuff (perhaps in a \'historical archive - warn people sector data may
change), as well as the newer background material.  If it\'s well done, costs
less, indexed good, I\'ll purchase it.

Thanks,

    'body' => 'If you would have asked be before TNE, you could have put me down as 
a die hard, detail oriented role player.

The more details the better.  The more complex the better.

But, as I played TNE, I noticed something.  It was taking a very long 
time to play, and my player were loosing interest.

Alas, I was loosing interest with all the rolling for every bullet, 
and the hit point system, and the odd weight numbers.  

Here\'s a case in point.  We\'d get in a situation where weight was a 
factor.  Needing to know the encumbrance for each character, I\'d 
audit my players on what they were carrying.

In stead of just adding up easy weights, like a pistol that weighs 
4kg, my players would have to add numbers like 3.92537 kg.  I think 
you see where I am going with this.  While the long number is 
unnecessary, it is more realistic.

Also, take a gun fight with fully automatic fire.  An attacker can 
take 5 pulls of the trigger in an action round in TNE, and if he has 
two actions in a single round, he can take ten.  On top of that, we 
roll to see if each bullet hits in the burst, and each pull of the 
trigger is a 5 round burst.  That\'s 25 attack throws!  And, after 
that, you roll several hit location throws and their corresponding 
damage throws.

Now, come on.  That\'s a lot of detail.  When I first picked up TNE, 
I was in love.  I had been dreaming about that kind of detail in a 
game.  But after playing it, for the first time in my life, I could 
see what others had been screaming about when they talked of 
"playability".

I still like a good measure of detail, but since TNE, I know that 
there is a limit.

I think the key is to achieve the detail TNE gave us with a simple 
system that reflects that.

But, that\'s always been the GOAL in the gaming industry, hasn\'t it?

More detail always means more factors to consider, which means more 
dice throws, which means more rule complexity, which means more time 
needed to play, which means lack of playability.

Striking a balance, like in most things, is the key.

Here\'s a suggestion.  I do not think it would be unreasonable to have 
two systems for given items.  Like starship combat.  It used to be in 
Traveller that you had several options to choose from.  There was the 
system given in the CT book, the High Guard system, and the Mayday 
system.  

Better yet, in TNE, you had the system in the main book, Brilliant 
Lances for ship to ship, and Battle Rider for fleet to fleet.

I like the choices.  It seems that the design systems could be 
similiar.  People who like complexity and detail should be able to 
use a T4 updated FF&S system, while others can use a simplier, 
modular system.

One perk that I would really applaud is to have all of the systems 
mutually interactive so that a vehicle designed in the system given 
in CSC will be compatible and give the same type of stats as a 
vehicle designed in the new T4 FF&S.

And as Berretta would say, "Dat\'s the name of dat tune."

floorplans in Starships you\'re left with around 36 pages of useful (and

CSC, by virtue of the *vastly* lower garbage illo vs. text ratio is
actually a good buy. AA isn\'t, because of the large "Golden Book" text
padding -- tho its probably better than Starships.

This also ensures that all of the planets in the Third Imperium have the
same "standards" - so, for example, an electrical applicance manufactured
on one planet can be plugged into a wall socket on another planet (I would
imagine this kind of thing would extend to everything from electronic
character encoding sets to the diameters of nuts and bolts).  If nothing
else, this would encourage "uplifted" planets on the frontier, whose
infrastructures were put together will Imperial help, to trade with the
Imperium, rather than with their non-Imperial (and thus, perhaps,
"non-standard") neighbors...

However, I don\'t think that your comments are entirely fair. The complaints
that have been made are *not* about minor things -- they are about factors
that threaten the survival and growth of the game that we all love --
Traveller. IG *seems* to have lost the plot in the early days. Sure, it
*MAY* be getting its act together (tho AA and JTAS don\'t seem to augur well
for that), but is it too late? How many new (or *potentially* new) players
are going to buy Starships and feel so ripped off that they\'ll say -- "Oh.
I can get Star Wars RPG in *full colour* on *glossy paper* in a *decent*
hardbound edition, and it all works, there\'s no huge problems that make
vital subsystems unusable -- and its reasonably priced, too."? I suspect
the answer will be -- LOTS.

Is it too late to save Traveller? Don\'t know. But IG better do something
*radical* to improve quality and all the areas we\'ve been complaining about
or they\'ll go the way of GDW. After all, how many people out there threw
their hands up in disgust at MegaTraveller 1st Edition and didn\'t come
back? Or at TNE? *LOTS* I suspect, or GDW would still be with us.

A few tremors at the beginning, but thus far, no major earthquakes.  I say
T4 is doing well now that Courtney is in charge, their web page is great,
and the products ar elooking better.  Clear sailing for 1997.

Well, I believe I\'m one of the junior members of this list, at 17.  However,
my experience in RPGs does NOT come from CCGs (products of the devil I
believe <g>), but from my older brother, who introduced me to D&D at age 8.

Just, for the record, I love complexity, as it gives me something to do with
my RPGs when I don\'t have anyone around to game with.  Designing a starship
with QSDS\\SSDS is much more satisfying than with a simple design system.

Thanks,

Sure. But the point even with Books #2 and #5 was that they actually came
pretty close to the same figures. There wasn\'t a 40-60% variation in price,
for example.

Don\'t get me wrong. I think the CTrav game system stank (apart from
Starship design) -- MTrav was something I was *avidly* awaitingm but,
IMNSHO, the Task Resolution system was so complex, ill-thought out, and
badly designed that it was unusable (and, yes, I know that lots of people
disagree). As far as TNE is concerned, the *game system* was *great* ...
I\'ve always liked the T:2000 d20 game system, and this was even better than
T4 as far as I am concerned. The *background* stank to high heaven, and the
ridiculous design rules -- the wholesale change from Thruster Plates to
HePlar for example -- were a total turn-off.

So, I hope that I don\'t come across as a total fuddy-duddy living in the
past. I\'m not.

As for Star Wars, well, how many players of *it* have Net access? This is
the point I\'m trying to get across -- *we* are *not* representative. And if
you stuff buyers around with garbage like Starships *is* (OK, it wasn\'t
*intended* to be that way, but we have to live with the reality), then
they\'ll look at Star Wars, which is a *much* better presented product and
*seems* better value for money to the sort of High School/Junior College
Market we\'re evidently aiming at. The reality of Star Wars may be that its
not as good as Traveller -- but we\'ll still lose to it for the reasons I
have suggested. Or we might, if IG doesn\'t *radically* get its act
together.

Yep, I\'m waiting for CORPS vehicles myself. Greg reckons its close to
playtest stage, too! So (with luck) it *might* be available, as they say in
the computer software game "real soon now" :-)

And he *has* commented to the effect that you *could* use it to design
Starships -- even though there are no specific starship stuff in it like
MDrives and JDrives -- so maybe what we *really* want is CORPS *Starships*
as well! Or even, dare I say it, CORPS "Traveller".

Its not that the designed ships don\'t match with the results from the
Starships rules, its that *Starships* can\'t be used to design the "classic"
ships. If you use Starships you get ships that are *twice* as expensive as
they should be according to canonical sources.

But the point is that HG still worked. MTrav never did, as far as I could
see (of course, I really couldn\'t be bothered with a "Step 31 - Step #14 -
Step #3 - Step #2 - Step #12" sort of design sequence), and TNE was
actually *worse* than MTrav. Niether ever worked for me -- nor did they for
most of the gaming public. I don;t mind using 3G^3 for the simple reason
that the design sequences are just that, *sequential*, they are simple to
use, and even a non-gearhead like me finds them easy to understand and
emplace. MTrav and FF&S were simply unusable for me -- and for most people
not on this list, I suspect.

And thats the main reason. I don\'t want pages of errata like we got for
MTrav and TNE. That sort of stuffup is now a Traveller "tradition", one
that will kill it *dead* if they don\'t get their act together.

And still completely unusable for most people because it has the same
nonsequential design "sequences" that FF&S and MTrav had. How many people
like me bought it because GV#1 was so good found out too late that it was
like that? I personally will only be using the GV#1 *sequences* with some
of the extra detail from the GV#2 book -- GV#2 by itself is so complex as
to be unusable. Is simply don\'t have the time to create a Spreadsheet (and
don\'t really know how -- or care to learn) to make it simpler. I think SJ
have lost the plot with this product even tho it will sell well based on
the rep of GV#1. Thats my opinion, FWLIW.

And MTrav Task resolution was one of the *worst* "advances" in Traveller,
IMHO. Even TNE implemented it better! The design rules were non-sequential
and, therefore, unusable without a spreadsheet (well, that\'s they way I
felt). TNE was an improvement, except for Virus, HePlar and FF&S ... er,
pretty much everything, in fact!

yes, and if only they\'d gotten Dream Pod 9 or Greg to design the new
Traveller *game system* we wouldn\'t be having this "discussion". (To be
fair, I don\'t mind the non-design aspects of the system -- Tasks, Combat et
al -- even tho it is a little dated).

I was surprised that a response form didn\'t accompany JTAS #25, so
here\'s mine! It\'s modelled after the original form.

I\'ve rated each article and Issue 25 as a whole. 1 indicates great

shades in between.

Issue 25 as a Whole                     4.0
=====

I hope future issues of JTAS include some sort of response form, 
even if only for subscribers.

One other notable item missing from JTAS #25 is an address for 
general and editorial mail. Hopefully the masthead will be more 
complete in future issues.

Explination:

There products you are seeing now is still made by the same people, minus
me.  I however, managed the productions of CSC, AA, and JTAS.  I created
the scheduel (along with Marc) until August 1998, and the reason were late
are because Courtney and I were discusing my terms of departure from the
IG.  Most of these products were done months ago and sat waiting.  This
waiting period could have lasted months more, however, I thought the most
important people (the fans) would end up being the victoms if that
happened.

I wish IG and Cortney great sucess for the future.  Remember Traveller is
my favorit game!  However, before anyone go passing out kudoos, you should
wait until after First Survey and Milieu 0 are are released.

(Pull knife out of chest) Ouch.  That feels much better.-)

Megtraveller was not the downfall of GDW, it lost out because it didn\'t

	Well, I\'m only 21, but I don\'t really count. I\'m this young because I got into CT when I was REALLY young (like 12).

	Is T4 attracting any new 12-year-old gamers anymore?

Too late . . . I live in the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco - the
place is rampant with teeny-bopper vampire wannabees.  Apparently, wearing
black, listening to The Smiths & The Cure, and whining about how alternative
you are, and how nobody can POSSIBLY understand you, isn\'t enough these days.
 Now you have to play live vampire games, shoot heroin, and get arrested for
biting your girlfriend while she\'s semi-conscious (a true news item here,
BTW).

Traveller has definitely piqued my interest in things scientific and
mathematical, but I have to give D&D credit with jump-starting my imagination
and vocabulary, as well as my appreciation of mythology.

I\'ve been playing Traveller off and on since The Traveller Book came out.  I
stopped playing for a while, surfaced long enough to see Traveller become The
New Era, decided it was hideous, and went back to other pursuits.

Last year I decided to backtrack, and bought all the MT stuff I could find.
 I began a classic Traveller campaign using the MT rules, only to hear of the
impending release of T4.  After smacking into errata-from-hell time and again
with MT, we switched to SpaceMaster.  Then T4 appeared . . .

I fear for my life if I switch game systems one more time with this bunch.
:-)  However, I am addicted to the Traveller universe (ever since I was 16),
so it is inevitable that I will try to wean them from the rollicking
Space-Opera fun we\'re having now, and go for the grit with T4.

As for the group, none of us work with computers for a living.  Several of us
work in the human service non-profit sector, others are buyers for retail
chains, etc.  But we all got a kick out of Traveller.

I hate to agree with this, but in my FNGS, they have a huge display with all
the new game releases.  The Traveller stuff is gathering dust (including
loads of hard-covers that have been there forever).  The new "Bubblegum
Crisis," "Heavy Gear," "Earthdawn," "GURPS," and even ICE Standard System
stuff is selling very well.  I hope IG\'s sales are better in other areas of
the globe.

As are duelists, and it appears there is a "code duelo" in the Imperium.  

It may well be that a well-educated "Gentleman" or "Gentlewoman" is
expected to be able to handle a foil, saber, or dueling pistol. If that\'s
the case, then people will *use* what they know.  So, even in situations
where a saber might not be the logical thing to use, it still might be the
weapon of *social* choice.

One of the first sections I usually look at is the arcane on-line page. 
It highlights five WWW sites "you can\'t afford to miss."  In this issue
(#14), there was a favorable quick review if Joe Heck\'s site, complete
with picture.  It\'s only about a paragraph or so, but it\'s a very nice
review.

Also in the same issue, they rate the top fifty games of all time
according to them.  Traveller rang in in third place.  If anyone is
interested on other GDW games, Space:1889 (one of my personal faveorites)

Bit off-topic, but I\'m interested in what the top 10 are.

For inspiration it might be worth it to hunt down a copy of GDW\'s
_En Garde!_. I keep my copy at my mistress\'s house. ;-)

And who knows, maybe there\'s even a clue in the rules regarding 
jump drives? :-)

several products that might qualify as ship design systems, stock ship

1) Emperor\'s Arsenal,
2) Imperial Squadrons,
and, bless my soul,
3) Fire, Fusion, & Steel. (God help us).

But no Naval Architect\'s Handbook. 

So: What happened to NAH? Was that merely a working title for something
else? Has the old FF&S been busted up between starship design components
and everything else? What\'s the deal? What rules are going to be in
which book? Anybody know?

        Well, that\'s what I thought too.  Assuming that the PC\'s in my
upcoming Milieu 0 campaign actually survive the Das Boot meets Mars
Attacks! madness that I have planned for them (since at least one of the
players reads this list, you can all consider this strategic disinformation
<or not>), I figure that it might be fun to run something like this...
They clinch the deal, then there\'s a coup, the local equivalent of the mob
start muscling in, they have hellish union troubles, the local
anti-Imperial party starts acting up, etc, etc, etc...

        I was under the impression that there was a special Standards

"...to suppress any manufacturers who, within the borders of the Imperium,
deviate from Imperial Standards Organization ISO 9000 standards, _by any

In a word: YES!!! My game has a number of 12-15 year olds; they\'re a lot of
fun.

I know of at least one guy who\'s under 25. . . and it isn\'t me. 

FYI, I\'m 37.

Victor, you can uncloak/unmask now :)

Victor is one of the Sunday Follies players and a budding gearhead. Give
him a design spec and a good design system and he _will_ crank out a great
design -- and he\'s sixteen or so.

I daresay that Vic is probably our token teener -- and I\'m damned glad to
have him, Schalli Wheelchair of Death and all :)

I guess if IG had thought about that, there wouldn\'t be that "Starships is
broken" fiasco. They shuld\'ve first come up and designed with the most
detailed system, then scaled the system back for more simplicity to
accomodate SSDS and QSDS. Then everything would be more or less consistent
(Due to round offs, the final numbers might not be exact matches, but
should be close enough, anyway). The stuff in RCEG were designed with
rules from FF&S. I\'ve checked a couple of weapons for consistency (the ACR
had a suspiciously low recoil), but they did check out. So it gave me the
confidence to use the FF&S rules. I like Greg Porter and his work, but
right now, I don\'t have a whole lot of confident in IG pulling off a coup
de grace like the old FF&S.

Actually, I wonder how many new Traveller (T4) players, period. I\'m under
the impression that the only people who\'ve bought T4 were the oldtimers.
But then, the stuff\'s been selling well. One has to wonder, though, how
long until the lack of value in the products eventually drive off even the
oldtimers.

Never played MT. Initially, I was turned off by TNE. Virus and all that.
But one look at FF&S convinced me that TNE is the shit. The amount of
detial given was unprecedented, and I was in Gearhead heaven.

I have just bought my first copy of T4 and I know it is the best game I  =
=20
have come across in quite a while. I have one concern though, and it is  =
=20
related to the "Age of Traveller Players".

The product seemed to be written for old players of the game. (To me  =20
anyway.) I have played RPG\'s since 1981 I have played many different game=
  =20
systems concerned with many different genres(Including Classic & Mega  =20
Traveller)., so I am not a newbie by any account.

T4 felt like it was written for old players. As an experiment I lent my  =
=20
copy to some younger guys (15-19) at a gaming club to see what they  =20
thought of the game. (These guys played Shadow run and Star Wars.) They  =
=20
liked the game mechanics, (although a couple of them thought it was all a=
  =20
bit complicated), but could not get a feel for the game.

I think IG had better do some work on the setting of Traveller. They are =
 =20
in danger of producing a game that only caters to old people that like to=
  =20
reminisce about the glory of the olden days. The trend of Role playing  =20
games has been to move away from complex Game mechanics and to move  =20
closer to group "story telling". Traveller is rich in stories yet to be  =
=20
told by younger players, and it would be a shame if those "Newbies" never=
  =20
got a chance to understand the beauty, and the majesty, that is  =20
Traveller.

I Am looking forward to your response, just let me get my shield ready  =20
before the flaming starts :)

I think that probably because I\'ve already have most of the TNE stuff, and
there are quite a few equipment that are repeated, but not neccessarily
explained in better detail. But CSC was one of the priciest book I\'ve
bought so far. Here in Toronto, the cheapest you can get is cover price.
That\'s a lot to pay for a sourcebook. If it were cheaper, I\'d have given
it 2 thumbs up, but the price brought it down to just an average.

Off hand, hard to say specifically which ones. Among the favourites are
the covers of both the basic rule book and FF&S and RCEG. Also "Hot
Recovery" in RCEG was very good too.

I like Foss\' works, too. But they just don\'t give me the you-are-there
feel, like some of the TNE stuff do.

I don\'t have any Battletech stuff (well, \'cuz I don\'t play battletech. I\'m
not exactly into miniature wargaming). Maybe I\'m just used to the TNE
illos where at least they don\'t look like someone just sketch the thing on
a napkin during lunch break.

Hurrah for _both_ Aliens Archive (about time minor races got some
attention!) _and_ Central Supply Catalog, with Greg Porter\'s superb
mix of the technical and humorous.  (Why do all my Scouts now want
to get assigned to "cultural exchange" missions?).

And JTAS #25 looks pretty good, though I have yet to dig in.  Probably
time to get off my duff and write an article or two as well.  :-)

the average age of Traveller players prior to T4 was around 32.

   My guess would be that the average age was lowered somewhat after the
release of T4, given that 30,000 copies of it sold.  However, I would
argue that the average age is probably still above 30, and that does not
bode well for Traveller\'s future.

I\'m 26, but I played my first "Black Book" game when I was 12 or 13 (can\'t
remember exactly).  In terms of complexity, I program computers for a
living and I majored in Math/Physics in college.  So what I see as a
reasonable design sequence is going to be skewed in comparison to what the
rest of the Universe thinks.

I think that the overall point is well taken -- There\'s a fine balance
between Space Opera and Hard SF.  Traveller has been balancing on that
edge for nigh on 20 years now.  Personally, I thought the more "abstract"
design sequences for Striker/High Guard/Robots were good models.  They
provided a feel of technical realism without over-alienating those with no
desire to know about the Jump Grid and the Zucchai crystals.  On the other
hand, DGP\'s SOM was a thing of beauty.

I think, however, that there\'s room for products of both types.

In point of fact, I\'ve been missing the "big string of numbers" a la High
Guard for awhile.  I thought it was a great idea for providing the
capabilities of a ship in a compact format.  <Shrug>

I\'m starting to ramble aimlessly, so I\'ll let this drop for now...

   MegaTraveller was not the "magic bullet" but it certainly was one of
the nails in GDW\'s coffin.  GDW\'s sales went down after the release of
MegaTraveller, and never recovered.

   As for the 5% "whine factor", we should also remember the 5%
"cheerleader factor".  There is always going to be a percentage of the
population that\'s going to love anything so long as it has the Traveller
name on it, no matter how badly edited it is, no matter how much the
layout resembles an abstract painting, and no matter how much they are
overcharged for it.

I knew you weren\'t as against CSC as you sounded.  I\'ve got the TNE 
stuff too, but it is good to have the T4 stuff, and I\'d remark that 
there are many more different types of equipment than in TNE.  TNE\'s 
guide was basically an expanded version of the same equipment used in 
both CT and MT.

One thing I like about CSC is that they are actually giving us new 
equipment and rules.

Did you check out the vacuum exposure rules?  It is funny in a space 
game, especially one like Traveller, but they have never, to my 
knowledge, published official vacuum exposure rules like this.

I like.  I like.

I\'ll drag these out and look at them tomorrow, but I do remember the 
FF&S and RCEG covers.  They have that cartooney feel, and what\'s 
with all the red colors.  Everything\'s a shade of orange, red, pink, 
and the like.

LOL.  I\'m afraid I\'d have to agree with you here.  As we all have 
stated before, a lot of Foss\' sketches are crap.  I just said that I 
thought they were getting better in CSC--that I can accept some of 
them.

Really, I\'d like the equipment illos to be more like DGP illustrated 
them in many of their works.  Those were the best.  Remember the old 
equipment sheet they came up with?  I loved those things, and I\'d 
like to see those for T4.

Give IG a break.  They are trying, and the stuff is getting better.  
Like you, I expected T4 to be incredible from the word go.  I keep 
citing Star Wars, but that\'s only because I think it is an 
exceptionally produced game.  Everything that they put out is useful, 
well produced, and priced right.

I don\'t know why IG can\'t be that way, but the fact is I\'m a 
Traveller fan.  I want to see it succeed.

And I\'m willing to give them a pat on the back and an "E" for effort 
for these new products.  When I looked at Starships, I got angry and 
slipped it in my Traveller box.  I\'ll probably only open it again a 
couple of times again--like that other disaster, MT\'s Fighting Ships.

The difference with these new supplements is, although I can see many 
ways for them to be better, they\'ve got that old Traveller yearning 
going inside me.  I want to read them and incorporate some of this 
stuff in my campaign.  That, in of itself, makes these three products 
a step in the right direction.  

And I\'m hoping that it will just keep getting better.

This is true and not true in the same time. This depends on you character.
Personnaly, i\'m the chief Engineer of a small starship. My job is to make
everything going right. There is an other character who don\'t know anything
about Technical architecture. She only uses the Communcators. This technical
Arcitecture helps me a lot for role playing my Engineer. There is lots of
ideas, and lots of ways to use them.

Using the same reasonment, you could have said. Hey, you know, why creating
such a background for character as 99% (I hope not) just want to go to
adventure (roll dices)?=20

The Technical architecture as the character background helps the player for
role playing. If the ships were just LEGO (word used by another TML
subscriber which i agree with) they would have less soul and less subject to
speak of. As an engineer, i took time to explain the heplar propulsor ro
this commando girl which knows nothing about starships. This is ROLE=
 PLAYING.

The other point, already explained by several suibsciber, is the proundness.
In regular RPG (those who don\'t have FFS like source books). You pick up
equipement, just like in a store. There is no "life" in those small parts of
your character. My character has a self made ETC gun, it has an history, it
is quite unique. If i find another, this won\'t be by chance. This gun is not
MORE destrctive, it is just different from what you could find in the RC. I
had already got a non standart gun in a regular RPG. This gun had to be MORE
destructive to have a significant interest for me.

That is to say, if you build you own equipment, you don\'t wnat to loose it,
you could risk your life for it. Again this Technical complexity add
roleplaying. Traveller is a "always moving" game, as players move from world
to world, so they can\'t have so many contacts as in other "sedentary games"
(i.e. WW Vampire game). In this game, i\'ve noticed that characters can risk
there life for what they have which is in that case mainly contacts and
heaven (home sweet home). In traveller, contacts (other than the ship crew)
are much rare and less strong (as contacts are not frequently met). So
equipment is a very important point filling the gap.

If you don\'t think about that, the players will become what we call BROSBILL
in France (i don\'t know the english expression in English) which represents
the "Skill Only character with Very Small Background and Very Destructive
weaponery Just to Get Maximum of Xp". This is the ultimate non roleplaying
but dice rolling player (aaaaaarrrgghhhhh!)

It\'s not a "superhard-SF cocoon", as for me Traveller is not a true Hard SF
game but it\'s the most advanced in that direction (maybe there are others,
but i don\'t know them). It has build an architecture base uppon possibility
which may be false (most of them in fact). Just take a look at the 30\'s
vision of the 80\'s and you\'ll get a hard laugh. This trueness of the FFS
vision is not the point. It has imagine a vision which was encapsulated in a
system by which it could be described and manipulted.

If you find FFS too complex you don\'t have to use it. In our group, only
three out of 5 have open the FFS book, and only two have created some
personnal equipement. the other just took some existing equipement even if
they contains some mistakes regarding FFS.=20




Now I agree that FFS has many "dark points" which are not clear. But in my 9
year RPG experienced i have never seen such dense a source book, every page
is interesting and containt information. It could have been more developped
and more explained. Nothing is perfect, neither am i. And you ?

I much prefer the SSDS to the QDS (especially since QDS stops at TL 12), 
but other than that the rest of Starships is only useful for kindling.
[2 on a 1-10 scale]

I simply don\'t like AA, I loathe the art, and around half the aliens are
dull or uninteresting.  Worm people and giant, animate trees are pretty
stupid ideas.  Challenge the did a Contact article on the Ahetaowa (first
described in Robots as "a race of intelligent animated plants".  The art
and description in the articles revealed a fascinating sessile species
that looked and sounded both interesting and biologically plausible.  AA
gave us "Ents for Traveller", yuck.  

The drawings of the Graytch look amazingly stupid and unlikely (large
arboreal critters with feet ending in points?).  To make matters even
worse the stats given in the book make no sense. A species is described as
twice a strong as a human and has 2D6 for Strength.  I miss Digest Group... 
[3 on a 1-10 scale]

CSC is another matter:  I don\'t like much of the art (The dune-buggy ATV 
in particular) but there isn\'t that much of it, and the rest of the book 
is *very* good, congrats to Greg Porter.
[8 on a 1-10 scale]

JTAS looked like a very amateur effort with bad art.  I\'m not saying the 
articles were bad, they weren\'t, the layout and design we simply very 
bad, hopefully this will improve.

	You havent read much Central American history, have you ?  
Cannibilism was endemic in precolumbian Mesoamerican cultures & many 
modern anthropologists suggest it was due to there lack of other meat.
Marvin Harris has written an excellent book on this subject whose name I 
can\'t remember.

	Vilani & Vargr says (pg 16)
	 "The individuals who developed and held the food conversion 
secret were called shugiilii (the closest Galanglic word is miller).  
The shugilli ultimately developed hundreds of "mystical" food conversion 
techniques, and became looked upon more as a shaman than as a cook.  
Since almost no food was edible without some treatment, they became 
powerful members of society.

	Our ancestors had no need for medically oriented shaman.  The 
alienness of Vland biology was reciprocal: predators could not eat 
humans, parasites found no nutrition in our bodies, and bacteria or 
viruses could not invade and take over.  There were few human diseases. 
 Even surgery was relatively free from the dangers of infection." 

	Since the shugilii kept there food conversion methods secret the 
Vilani might not have known they were cannibals.  The food conversion 
secret for human flesh may have just been "Serve well done."  Since this 
also states that few medical problems existed I believe this indicates 
that cannabilism related diseases were nonexistant.  On the other hand 
few diseases is not NO diseases & these could have been one of the few.
Of course once the Vilani encountered people with lots of diseases 
(Solomani) they may have had to change there diets.  Yet another Vilani 
complaint against the Solomani....

	Cannabalism among the Third Imperium is cannonical however 
(unless this is one of the things Marc Miller is taking out to make 
Traveller wholesome (T4 pg 5)).
	
	In World Builders Handbook (pgs75-77) there are some tables for 
generating miscellaneous local customs.  Each planet has 1d6 customs (an 
average of 3.5) & a total of 216 different customs are listed.  This 
means that each planets odds of_not_being cannibals are (215/216)^3.5
or 98.39%.  Thus 1.61% of the planets in the Imperium will be (at least 
partially) cannabilistic.  With about 11,000 planets in the Imperium 
(circa 1100) there will be about 177 with cannabilism present.  In  half 
the cases the custom will be practiced by the entire poulation & in the 
other half of the cases it will be practiced by a subgroup.  These 
cultural practices tables are not affected by any of the planets stats 
so we cannot say that cannabilism is only practiced on primitive 
planets. 

	I therefore suggest that some of this Imperial cannabilism may 
be a holdover from Vilani cannabilism as practiced in the First 
Imperium.  I realize that some of you may be uncomfortable with the 
notion of cannabilism in the Imperium but we need to remember that 
Imperial culture varys widely & is not allways like that of late 20th 
century Westen culture.

	I am interested in the subject of cannabilism in the Imperium 
because my current player charecter, Fred Grandy (we are playing the 
Traveller Adventure using T4) is a cannibal.  When I generate a player I 
always like to generate ther home planet using World Builders Handbook. 
This helps me to play a better charecter.  When I generated the customs 
for his (randomly chosen) homeworld of Dojodo (C512311-7 S Lo Ni Ic 710 
Im M5V / 3233 Spinward Marches (Jump 1 from Mora)) the first custom I 
came up with was cannabilism.  I thought this was in poor taste (no pun 
intended) & rerolled it, when cannabilism came up again on the reroll I 
figured that the dice had spoken & went with it.

Several people have, over the last three or four months, commented to me
that "Space Opera" (yes, that\'s where my tagline comes from, I\'m one of

"heard" that it is.

Well, that\'s news to me! Does anyone have any actual *source* for this
"rumour"? *I* would like to know!

Also, assuming that it *is* true, does anyone have a *current* address for
FGU/Scott Bizar -- the last one I have is the old NY one which I know is
years and years out of date. I understand he owns and operates a Game store
in Arizona, Phoenix, Tucson, Flagstaff, somewhere like that, but I don\'t
know where.

I ask because, *if* he *is* reprinting it, and is simply *reprinting* it
(i.e. not getting someone to do a complete rewrite, as FGU owns the *name*
but not the actual *rules* or *background*), then I\'d like to know as I
would be expecting some royalties!!! (Eventually, of course :-)

I don\'t think its likely that any of this is more than rumour as Scott
always struck me as an honest type of guy, and, since he hasn\'t contacted
me (and *I* haven\'t moved in the last 20 years!), I guess it must be just
that, a rumour ... but, hey, I\'d really like to *know*!

Any information would be appreciated. Thanks in advance -- and, of course,

Well, OK, I can live with that. Unfortunately, there is a logical follow
through that stuffs it up -- *either* you give all the PCs *TWICE AS MUCH
MONEY* in character creation (its probably not necessary to double the
price of personal level items), then there is no way that you can justify
the increases -- after all, it\'s hard enough to see a Merchant character
with a Free Trader worth 40 MCr, its *twice* as difficult to see them with
one worth *double* that (whcih is what we get with Starships). Doesn\'t make
sense. Its much more sensible to assume that the prices in Starships are
the problem and reduce everything accordingly.

Exactly. There are very few people out there who care enough about the
"bullshittium" aspects of the game to make something like FF&S worthwhile
for a *mass market*. We must *not* go the way of FF&S again if the game is
to survive and grow -- despite the moans and groans from the few and
unrepresentative techies (flame retardant underwear *on*!)

QSDS is OK, but its not even as good in *some* ways as HG (not that I\'m
saying HG was perfect -- *it* would need to be updated for use with T4
anyway), and Starships is, as I still say, a bad joke -- one that will
cause a lot of lost sales for T4.

Like their email newsletter asking if we poor suckers who bought the error
riddled T4 Main Rulebook would *now* like to buy a "new improved" second
edition. Sorry. Didn\'t do it for MTrav, T2300, or (was there one?) for
TNE/FF&S; am unlikely to do it for T4. I have a limit to how much I can be
suckered; sorry.

But the problem is that GV#1 *WORKED* ... *AND* it was a simple
step-by-step process. GV#2 is unusable in the same way FF&S is; it requires
a g*****n spreadsheet to be usable. OK. *I* have Excel -- but I wouldn\'t
have a clue how to program it (it was part of the MS Office Package and,
what can I say, as a teacher I got a better price on it than most
*ordinary* people will), and, you know what? I don\'t ever even want to
learn how! I\'m a historian and english teacher, not a engineering or maths
one -- and I don\'t want to be!

Look, Greg Porter did the right thing with 3G^3. Step by step *sequential*
design sequences -- and, yes, despite the formulae I don\'t mind using it --
 *AND* he made available a *very* professionally produced Spreadsheet
program that mechanises it for a modest cost. T4 needs to do the former and
would be well advised to do the latter -- and include it in the cost of the
product, if necessary.

Like someone said "If only* are two of the saddest words in the english
language ... lets hope we don\'t have to go "If only IG had ... " sometime
all to close in the future!

There\'s the answer Ken Bearden and I were looking for!  Most of the 
people that like T4 are too danged busy *playing* the game to argue about 
it.  I shoulda figured that one out for myself. =)

Note about the crew: It should be 1 Command, 2 Maneuver, 1 Electronics, 
1 Engineer, 2 Gunnery, 1 Steward, and 2 Medical (The 20 low passengers alone
require 1 full medic; the passenger and crew requires a fraction of a medic, 
and there is no rule about rounding down for medical crew), except for the
special rule that a 200 T ship can be operated by a crew of 2. That reduces
the crew to 2 Command cum Maneuver cum Electronics cum Engineers, 2 Gunners,
1 Steward, and 2 Medics.

Incidentally, here is my suggestion for a Free Trader: Drop the High
passengers; two Mid passengers beat one High passenger any day. Drop the
Low passengers; they take up 1 T of cargo space, which will net you Cr1000
with no overhead and cost you overhead plus the cost of having a medic.
Reduce the fuel purification plant to 1 T capacity; It takes you 10 hours
to reach the 100 diameter limit of a small Gas Giant and 18 hours to reach
that of a large one; spending 20 hours to refine your fuel seems a
reasonable compromise with the lost cargo space a plant takes up.

I started playing Traveller in \'84, I had the black books, my players
and I loved it. But even then my players and I knew that it was not
sufficient to cover what we wanted.
I got Megatraveller in \'88, I thought that it was a vast improvement,
and used it. Even before TNE came out my players and I were spotting the
problems and trying to fix them. (the hopeless starship rules among one)
In \'93 (ish) I obtained TNE. From a referee\'s point of view it was
fantastic. My players had mixed feelings, some loved it, others thought
it was too complex, the initiative system sucked etc. In some cases I
had to agree. (I have never found an automatic fire system that was easy
to use yet)
When T4 came, I bought a copy (actually I was so excited I bought two, I
ordered one, and when I saw it in the shop, I bought it before my order
arrivedl, I could always use a spare!).
When I looked through the rules, I saw it had some good ideas, but it
seemed to lack something. I decided that I should playtest it
reguardless, so I got the usual group together and we tried it. A couple
loved the generation system, one guy hated the lack of choice. 
I pressed on....
Then the problems really started.
The task system didn\'t seem to work any more, my players were finding it
to easy to do things (or more to the point, to easy for the NPC\'s to do
things to them.)
They started ask me more questions.

"How many stateroom does a free trader have?"
I couldn\'t work it out from the info given, I went back to MT, to find
the values.

"What are the crew positions?"
I didn\'t know, I went elsewhere.

"If I buy a helmet, how does it protect me?"
It wasn\'t entirely obvious how a helmet fitted into the rules to me
either.

"If I fire my laser at that free trader, what damage does it do."
Err..., nothing..., I think.

"Why, It doesn\'t have any armour."
Yeah...

Other problems began to crop up on a regular basis. After a while my
players and I began to get very cynical (we tried to be positive...
honest)

When I bought Starships, Aliens and CSC, I didn\'t have that same level
of excitement that I used to have. When I read through the books I felt
a vague dissapointment. I have finally worked out what it was.

It didn\'t feel like Traveller any more. The Aliens were more like DND
monsters than traveller aliens.
Starships apparently, had a lot of problems, it\'s main problem for me
was that I couldn\'t be stuffed using a rules system that couldn\'t
generate the ships in the module, I like consistency, and it didn\'t have
it.
CSC was very good... but by that time I was so jaded I couldn\'t muster
any enthusiasm. It looks like a fantastic module, but  it\'s connection
to the T4 (basically broken) rules drags it down.

The construction rules are not any easier than FFS either, just
different.
And in two seperate modules.


My players and I have now started a campaing using a hybrid of MT and
TNE rules. (basically MT task system with TNE equipment). Oddly enough
using the T4 skill set and background. (I said it had some good ideas).
Characters can be generated using any system. (and converted
appropriately)

I\'m still going to buy all the supplements that are produced for T4, but
I probably won\'t be using them.
Maybe one day I\'ll change my mind and start playing T4, CSC has gone a
long way towards making me feel better about the system, but at the
moment it seems to have lost that traveller feel.

Kinda small?  I was realizing what Cortney Soloman meant when he said that
at $5 each they arent making money!  I\'ve spent more and gotten less on
comic books, computer magazines, etc.  and I think there were only about 5
pages of ads in this issue.

I\'d compare this magazine to Challenge, since it\'s a similar format.
Challenge was what? $4.50? How many years ago?  Challenge was more pages
overall, but I usually used about 8 of those 96 pages (and that\'s counting
the usable "crossover" stuff).  I also think the Foss covers are better
than most of the Challenge covers were (Inside art is more debatable).
This magazine provided me with many more usable pages (in spite of the
fact that I have 101 cargos already), including the fiction, which is
easily adapted to an adventure (as long as I hide the magazine from the
players in my group). 

> Things I\'d like ta see:

I think it would be somewhat masturbatory for them to review IG products,
and out of line with the mission of supporting only Traveller to review
other RPG products.  Providing overviews and descriptions falls under the
realm of advertising, and they did that.

I was quite pleased with JTAS, and would have paid as much as $8 or $10
for it.

Looking for meele weapons with attitude?  Try XTEK\'s line of quality hi-tech

<Available Now!!!> Shock Gloves, electrified mesh gloves, insulated for the

Vibroblades, all shapes, all sizes, all frequencies!

The "Electric" Dueling sabre.  No not the "electric blades" used in low tech

cow prod?

Melee weapons with intragal gun attachment.  Useful for the spy, assasin of 
the buisnessman who wants that special, stylish, "edge".  These look like 
normal meele weapons (sword, dager, etc...)  but they have a one, maybe 2 
shot gun inside of them.  "Hey, look at the doof with the sword, lets mug 
him, <BLAM!>"  Requires concieled weapon permit on most worlds.

<Promotional gimick mode off>

Seriously folks, I have been making melee weapons using 3g^3 and they\'re not 
half bad.  Mind you they are useful only if in melee combat with another, or 
ambushing or assasination.  In the heat of fire combat, unless you are a 
Skywalker(or a damned good psionisist!) "noththing beats a good 
blaster(laser) at your side kid!"

The "shock gloves" are curently posted on the Planet X website.  And when 
the ISP is reconected, I will be able to put more meele weapons on it.

OK, so I too have been making my first walk through SSDS and yes,
it doesn\'t match the prices that are listed in the main T4 rulebook
at all. ALSO, the armour values are TOTALLY CRACKED!!! The Mercenary
Crusier had an USD armour value of 40 (?), which would be an armor
value of 47,000+ in SSDS, which would be > 100% of the volume
available using TL 12 superdense... now, TL13+ bonded superdense could
do it, but gee, THAT ISN\'T AVAILABLE!!! I think IG is having problems
deciding what TL things are at. Perhaps this is some sort of carry-over
from GDW\'s \'Cadillacs & Dinosaurs\'.

Anyways, if I had to choose one, I\'d say that the main rulebook and
Starship ship designs are cracked but SSDS is OK.

Maybe the back of the 2nd printing of the T4 rulebook should have
a pointer to TML so people could figure out how things are _really_
supposed to work.

Good idea, Phil. I tried doing a design or two using the beta VDS
and I really had no idea what a reasonable amount of fuel was.
5 hours, 10, 20? I think that per your suggestion, less is more.

Perhaps, Ken, it would be more appropriate for you to refrain from comment
on what are basically management decisions at IG.  You are still heavily
wrapped up in the production of materials for them, and you know as well
as I that making decisions like the one being discussed in nowhere near as
simple as "Well, $20 sounds good". 

That you might make a different decision under similar circumstances is
moot.  Only the IG staff makes those decisions, and in your position,
questioning or undermining those decisions is not really fair or good
form.

book cost $1 and offered a free lifetime subscription to Playboy

I appreciate your comment.  I don\'t want to seem like I\'m winning or
undermining IG future desision because that is not my intent.  And you are
right that desisions are not simple or easy to make. I could write pages on
why dicissons are made.  Therefore, I will refrain from speeking of old IG
business and talk about the game.

However, I want to end this letter I had a good time working on Traveller,

1.  SALES

  I\'ve thought about this and I realize that IG may be experiencing good
sales, but who is buying this stuff?  The distributors and game stores
represent most of the sales I would guess, and I wonder how much they will
buy in the future?  If as everyone says, T4 is not selling well in their
area (here in Mississippi I think 3-4 main books) then it may be that IG
will have to rethink their price in the near future.  I hope I am wrong
about it and I hope it is just a misunderstanding, but I\'m afraid that the
good sales may end abruptly.

2.  IG\'S IMPROVEMENT

  Having said that, I must say that those purchasers who can get past the
failure of Starships will be happy.  I can definitely see that IG has
improved with it\'s products, but I agree with Phil (I can\'t believe I said
that) to an extent.  If people pick up the main book, then Starships, I
doubt they will come back to Traveller.  I kept coming back because I don\'t
play any other games and I really don\'t want to.  Also, I was on this list
and I could see what was going on behind the scenes with Traveller and I saw
the little signs that said they were trying to fix their mistakes.  I will
gladly throw my coin in the purse of those that think IG is doing much
better, but there is still a nagging voice that is asking me, "Is it too late?"

3.  AGE

  For the record, I am 26.

4.  LOUISIANNA

  Would the kind soul who admitted that he was from Louisianna please eMail
me.  I am about 30min from Slidell and I would love to get together with
another Traveller fan to talk or play Traveller.

5.  PETER

  Peter, I lost your eMail address here at work, but I still want to be in
the game.  I have the address at home and I will mail my Character to you by

It almost make me feel young.  This lurker is 31, has been involved in
gaming (Avalon Hill, SPI, Napoleonic Miniatures, etc) since 1977, RPGs
since 1980 (AD&D and Classic Traveller).  Our group has gone through
Classic Traveller, MegaTraveller, and TNE, although we never seemed to get
very far with the latter two incarnations as Classic Traveller.  I didn\'t
really like the Rebellion much, but I did like the TNE era (despite some
problems with Virus). So far, I haven\'t been overly excited about M: 0,
but that\'s mostly because of lack of published material. 

Current gaming group is aged 23-31.  

Back to lurking.

Some of the old-timers may recognize these prices.  Unless I\'m mistaken,
they\'re the same as the prices for these ships in Book 2 of classic, old
black-book Traveller.  Don\'t I recall something about a plan to use the
old Book 2 design system before QSDS was developed?

AFAIK, Aramis wasn\'t used for anything other than the TA.  The lower left
hand corner showed up in Adventure 3: Twilight Peak, but very little was
said about it.

Hey!  I live in the Sunset (19th and Quintara) maybe we can get together
sometime.  The kids in the Haight are the same as the ones who have been
coming here since 1970.. they think that the summer of Love is still
happening, and that *somebody* will feed them and give them shelter.
Welcome to real, cold, foggy world kids!

My wife lost a long time friend to that damn LARP.  He now spends every
night running a Vampire game in Redwood City, with no time for anything
else.  I hate to say it, but when the game becomes your life, things are
going a bit to far.

Hmm.. I started on Traveller, and it spured me to learn real world science.
Last year at a con I had an astronomer ask if I would consider doing my
doctoral work at his school!  The look on his face when I confessed that I
was self-taught...

Please explain this statement.  How exactly are the aliens in Traveller
"like DND monsters".

The aliens in Alien Archive are well written, and *very* alien.  That Denaar
might remember being taken to Vland 8000 years ago!  I could base an entire
campaign around finding the truth about the Controlled.  Even on a casual
encounter level most of these aliens, if played well, will leave the players
with the feeling that they have meet a different kind of Intellegence.

Side note:  A few years ago, I had a chance to meet Koko, the famous signing
gorrila.  This.. entity renamed me (Hair Face), offered to play (300lbs of
gorilla plays hard!), and talked to me about cats (we both like them).
Afterwords, I was talking with one of Koko\'s caregivers and I blurted out
that I felt like I had just talked to an alien.  I had, she assured me.

Koko is an alien.  She is a Mountain Gorilla that has learned to talk with
us.  She has an intellegence that is fully capable of grasping abstract
concepts, but is fundementally different from our own.  That is what makes
an alien.  Not the number of limbs or eyestalks, but that *different*
intellegence.

A Bwap isn\'t going to get frustrated by impatient humans, he isn\'t going to
be able to understand their motivation in wanting to hurry.  Asyms aren\'t
recycling maniacs because they are all Greenpeace members, it is what they
are.  An adult male Aslan *cannot* understand the concept of selling land
for money.  Most K\'kree would happily stomp any human into the veldt on
general principle; we only see the tolerant ones on the fringes of the Two
Thousand Worlds.

My point is this: with any alien race (including the humanoids from D&Dish
games) the GM has to get into the mindset of that race, or now matter how
well written, how many color drawings we have, it will still be a guy in a
rubber suit.  Alien Archive takes a great step in helping GM/players with
this by providing a set of quick role-playing guidelines in the form of one
or two word concepts.

the authoris Greg Porter, the same man who did such a good job on the

One warning:  make sure you own a good scientific calculator before

people in my group are 22, 27, 27, 27, & 31. Although most of the group has a
technical background (computers & chemistry), we don\'t want the game to get
really bogged down as to sacrifice playability.

Way back in the early 80\'s I was just a pc. There was more demand for AD&D
DMs so Trav was always secondary. By 1991 I was fed up with the D&D scene
(haven\'t played it since) & I finally saw that MT had been released. I found
some friends of mine who felt likewise & we\'ve been playing it exclusively
since.

Since, Trav products have been scarce, we\'ve had to modify the rules (as I\'m
sure most people on this list have done) to make them more realistic and/or
playable. Adjusting to MT took a bit of work but overall it was a positive
addition to my Trav resources.

I read in "Science Fiction Age" that TNE came out but I was reluctant to pick
it up. One of the pc\'s in my group did last year. I liked the plot and the
diversity of character classes. Figuring out combat took a while. I finally
typed a summary of what ground combat entailed because the rule book wasn\'t
concise. Since I stated that the group would be switching over to this new
system (EVERY bullet must be accounted for) they\'ve been strangely avoiding
ground combat and sticking to just ship combat. 

I finally found a place that sells T4 this weekend. I quickly looked at Ships
(enough has been said here) and Aliens (better, but not useful for my
campaign) before quickly looking through the rulebook. I bought it and read
through most of it yesterday. I\'m disappointed that the world generation
system hasn\'t been updated to reflect the one I found at the Missouri Archive
nor is it as comprehensive as MT. I like the character generation. I think
it\'s the best to date. I\'m thinking about trying to adapt some of the TNE
character groups to it (upon pc request). I\'m going to try the ground combat
sequence out to see how well it works. TNE is just too intricate to be
readily playable. A hybrid may be in order. Although my campaign will
continue in it\'s present time period, I\'m going to try and adopt T4 rules
where possible.

At this point in my gaming, I think all I really need is background info,
settings, etc. I\'d like to see the CSC. My pcs need something like that. I
look fwd to supplements like the Aslan Border Wars, Vargr Campaigns, etc.
Btw, if anyone knows of a copy of Vilani & Vargr that needs a new home, I\'d
be interested. 

Thanks!

There was a mercenary adventure for Aramanxs (in Aramis subsector) set in
the Rebellion era where Sternmetal or other megacorp had smuggled fission
powerplants to one side enabling them to build nuke subs. This was
published in one of the Challenge issues to be used with the Wet Navy rules

I agree with everything you said, but I have a slightly different
take on this. I am a gear-headed techno-geek who does nuclear physics
for a living. I do not like the complexity of FFS, not because it is too
hard.

I don\'t like it because its complexity is needless!

Look at the formulae given there! They are gross simplifications. You
can\'t expect me to believe that the simple linear, quadratic, and
cubic equations are sufficient for a REALISTIC discription of either
modern or future technology. You can\'t expect me to believe that the 
arbitrary six-step binary progression of the USD table accurately models
any kind of physically real system.

So FFS is a gross approximation. That\'s fine. I can live with gross
approximations. In science, we use them all the time. Gross
approximations are often useful because they SIMPLIFY.

But why should I use a compex and hard gross approximation,
when I could be using a nice and simple gross approximation?

To put it another way, why should we strain out the gnat of
bullshittium and then swallow the camel of the USD table?

It may not be better than ever, but its no worse than before. Every

no different. The rule changes (except perhaps for ship design) are good
improvements. Starships wasn\'t so good. The other stuff has been

I\'ve been following the list for about 4 months now, contributing when I
can (shaking my head in amazement when I can\'t!), and watching the general
tone of the list get more and more negative.

I\'m not talking about the constant bickering of the \'hard science\' vs. the
\'space opera\' players, I mean this constant dragging down of the product.
I agree that there are problems with Traveller, and probably with IG, that
need addressing and resolution.  But how many times do we have to go over
the same points, when all that is being contributed is hard feelings?
Very occasionally, I see someone address a point, and make a suggestion
for resolving that point, but that seems to be the exception.

That exception, IMHO, is the way to correct problems.  Instead of
just complaining, let\'s be proactive and FIX the problems.  If you don\'t
like the way a table works, rework it and share it with the rest of us!
If you don\'t have a fix, approach the problem as a request for
assistance, and let the rest of us help.  It\'s time to move on past the
problems T4 has had in startup, and start resolving \'em so that we can
both ENJOY the game (more), and ensure that IG is successful enough to
continue to feed our habits!  :)

I personally run a composite campaign, drawing on all 4 versions for ideas
and background.  I may not be canon, but I darn well enjoy it, and so
do my players (I hope!)  I\'ve been playing traveller since the early 80\'s
(CT), running it since the mid-80\'s.

For those that care, I\'m in my mid-30\'s, as are most of my players
(except for that rogue 21 yr old I just recruited!)

The long number is not realistic. The weight of your pistol will vary by
several milligrams depending on when it was last cleaned, how much sweat
has dried onto it from your hand, how much residue was deposited by the
last bullet, etc. 

False precision never adds more realism. Just more complexity.

>Character mode off<

Me personaly, the human, not the figment of my demetia,  I am 26.  I have 
played Trav since the black book days, having played AD&D for about a year 
before hearing of Traveller.  Basicaly I was trying to make a Sci-Fi game 
myself(was too D&Dish)  even came up with "tech levels" yep thats what i 
called them!  Then someone told me and brought over traveller one day.  been 
hooked ever since 1985.

And what of my space game?  Well, its been through 4 revisions 1985-1990 
then i just said to blazes with it and concentrated on Traveller. It had 
practicaly everything i could want in a space game. The background 
information from that old homegrown I still use as an "Alternate Quadrant". 
 Trying to do it yourself gives you a feel for what game designers must 
probably go through, so I treat them with great respect and admiration.

If you do the math, you will see I started trying to create "Starships & 
Zapguns(S&Z)" when I was 15.  Not bad, but verrrrry buggy(and just a bit, a 
bit mind you, plagaristic ;)  )

Well is that enough Info for the Infonauts?

   Don\'t confuse the \'Munchkin\' class with the GearHeaded MinMaxer!
The GHMM carefully examines the rules to produce the optimum character and
equipment load.  True MinMakers casually destroy Munchkins out of a deep
seated loathing. :-)

Are you sure about that?  If you go in with a Company standard rather
than
the Imperial standard, you get a built in monoploy, "You bought a GunkHo
Toaster, sir.  I\'m sorry about that, Ling Standard Services only
supports
Ling Standard Toasters on it\'s power grid."  And etc.... though that
makes

But that\'s so haaaaaarrrrrdddd! :)  

But seriously, there are indeed lots of folks on this list (and on 
GDW-Beta) that do their share to ensure the survival of their favorite 
RPG.  Twolf actively recruits folks who\'ve never played Traveller before 
to his IRC-based game.  Suz Dollar has provided a space for us on IRC, 
where we can discuss the game in all its glory <G>.  Stuart, Douglas, and 
Peter try to talk sense into the folks on rec.games.frp.marketplace - a 
daunting task as best, and I commend them for having the fortitude to 
even try <G>.  Then there\'s people like Guy "Wildstar" Garnett, Dave 
Golden, Merrick Burkhardt, and the rest of the active GDW-Beta team 
who\'ve stepped up to the plate more than once to make Traveller a success 
by helping with the technical design systems.  Let\'s not forget Kenneth 
Bearden, who complained about the T4 task system, then came up with a 
comprehensive fix within 2 weeks or so, and shared it far and wide.  Rich 
Ostero is certainly doing his share, as he runs a game every Sunday at 
his FLGS, which helps to draw many new members to the ranks of the 
Traveller enthusiasts.  Joe Heck, Commander X, and a legion of others 
help spread the word by running great web sites.  David Joseph Smart 
certainly amazed me by offering to compile the complete list of T4 errata 
(now available on IG\'s web site - way to go David!), and give out prizes 
to the biggest contributors.  James Dempsey, he of the superlative web 
site with the TML FAQ and other wonders, does a lot to keep us together, 
including keeping the list of Those Topics Which Must Not Be Mentioned. 
=)  Then there\'s Eris, who was crazy enough to go off to Gearhead 
territory with me and design the Role-Playing Space Combat system 
(Eris, it didn\'t turn out as we had originally planned, but it\'s 
still a damned fine space combat system).  Well, I better stop naming 
names, because I could keep going all day.  :)

It\'s quite obvious that many, many of us go out of our way to help 
Traveller succeed.  Which isn\'t to say that there\'s no need for more 
folks who are willing to give of themselves in order to assure 
Traveller\'s continued success.

Glad to meet ya.  I\'m 28, and I\'ve been a Traveller enthusiast for more 
than half my life. =)  \'Though I must admit that the ol\' enthusiasm has 
been kinda kicked into high gear for the last year or so. :-)

I just spoke to Tim Brown, who told me that the FF&S listed on the web 
site refers to the system currently under development on GDW-Beta.  The 
final title of the work is indeterminate at this time, and they felt that 
"Fire, Fusion, & Steel" adequately communicated the subject matter of the

Excuse me?  So, anyone that is still using CT or MT is actually
playing StarWars (due to the complexity of those two systems) and not
real Traveller?  Strange... my copy of CT says "Traveller" on the
front cover.  Traveller is not a military boardgame-- it is a RPG.
=46F&S is not a RPG-- it is a design system.

People like yourself seem to think that the perfect roleplaying game
would require a far more detailed version of FF&S, the entire Phoenix
Command game system for detailed combat (or perhaps even a live-action
paintball conflict), World In Flames for global conflicts, and access
to the Hubble telescope for celestial information.

Traveller is a role-playing game... bog it down with too many
dominating supplements and your target audience begins to shrink.
Even if such people choose not to buy these add-on products and stick
with the basic T4 rulebook, they could very well feel that
\'complexity\' is the direction IG plans to go with future Traveller
releases, and decide that such a game is not one that they would be
willing to pay for.  Imagine what goes through the minds of newbie
roleplayers that see an entire wall of a gaming store dedicated to
AD&D... \'Where do I start-- or do I even bother?\'

I agree with much of what Jay stated in his lengthy, but thorough
posting... if IG re-released FF&S, the only people that would buy it
would be people which currently own FF&S, and a few new interested
customers.  In fact, some current owners of FF&S might NOT want to buy
the new version is simply a re-release and not a complete re-write.

If IG made FF&S more complicated, they would probably sell _you_ a
copy (as well as a few others on this list).  But how many players
would they alienate by producing a product that these people felt
uncomfortable with or could not use?  Since so few people would buy a
"more complicated version of FF&S", they would have to price them out
at over three times the price of the current "Starships" to make any
sort of profit (someone has to be paid for all the time involved in
the project).

You obviously missed the point of Jay\'s post, and that was:

"For a company to be successful, it must try to make sure its products
are well received by as many people as possible."  If a car
manufacturer decided not to bother making vehicles with automatic
transmissions, they would be missing out on a large portion of the
driving public.

As another list member put it, keeping FF&S "as it stands" (or making
it even more complicated) does little for added detail since all of
the other remaining interrelated rules would then be considered
woefully inadequate (ie: the combat rules suck-- both starship and
personal).

Yep! I also remember meeting Dave Hargrove back in the early 80s at a
con in the SF Bay Area. I used Arduin as a massive D&D supplement. It
was at this con that I first ran Trav outside my home gaming group . . .
.

I also heard that Dave passed away a few years ago; however, I don\'t
know weather this is true or not.

I\'d like to see Trav hang around so I can introduce my (someday)
grandkids to the game; my teenaged daughter isn\'t into science fiction
or gaming (damn the luck). Maybe someday she\'ll see the light . . . . :)

For the past couple of days all most of us have posted, or read, is how   
Traveller has lost the its shine, and, that it is now only a game for us   
old die hard fans.

Now that we have seen the problems, lets fix them.

Traveller is one of the longest surviving RPG\'s and still the best! I   
don\'t know of too many RPG\'s that has had as much talent, love and vision   
put into it from gamers from all over the world. Face it, IG may produce   
the books, but we keep Traveller alive. In a nut shell, Traveller belongs   
to us, the gamers, and if we don\'t want to see it die, then we have to   
save it!

If we love Traveller as much as we say we do, than the responsibility of   
Preserving Traveller is ours not IG\'s.

With this in mind I would like to see discussion change to "What can we   
do to save Traveller?" Let us combine under a new banner as  "Custodians   
of Traveller".

Lets combine our ideas on this mailing list! Let us pass the sacred   
torch, that is Traveller, to a new Generation (When we are finished with   
it of course! :))

Please don\'t let Traveller die! If Traveller died it would be like all   
the stars in the heavens suddenly went out. Traveller is not about IG,   
it\'s not even about us the players........ It\'s about keeping the dream   
alive...... "That one day man will truly walk among the stars!"

Here endith the lesson!

I have (not too surprising really).
  
I haven\'t motivated myself enough to start writing traveller code (yet).  I 
did think about converting my random word generator and speaker over but 
java\'s sound support is criminally lacking :-(

Given how slow work is at present, I may be able to squeeze some time during

TSR games *shudder*, but I really liked GDW\'s style of products. A year or
two later I got to playing Traveller and have been hooked ever since.
Everybody\'s got an opinion, of course, but I thought of GDW as the class of
the RPG industry. 
My gaming group, luckily for me, agrees. :) They range in age from 23 to 27.
Even though some people have drifted in and out over the years, and our
lives have taken an annoying turn towards adulthood, a few of us still find
time to game every once in a great while. Even got them hooked on T4. The
first session ended in a misjump, though. *This does not bode well*
I\'m glad to see so many other people are dedicated to seeing Traveller survive. 
Thus ends the fuzzy warm sentiment... ;)

Adios,
Rob.

the vulnerability of grav vehicles...I\'m hoping the TML will bring some
clarification on the matter.

Just how much damage can a grav plate take before it ceases to function?
The standard Air/Raft (as I recall) has 4-1 ton C/G plates on the bottom
that provide lift, and a separate thrust mechanism (we\'ll side-step that
minefield for now).  If I have, say, a marine in a trench, with a rifle.
He is placed in such a way as NOT to be able to take out the pilot, but
CAN hit the underside of the vehicle, what does he have to do (as per his
BMR training in boot camp) to damage/destroy the grav craft?  Does anyone
have any specific AGC weaponry designed?

I assume the basic technology is fairly robust, but I cannot find any
specifics.  Any opinions?

I generally feel that I fall in the dinosaur category.  I\'m 35, and have been
a fan of Traveller since the week that the black box showed up at my local
game and hobby shop in 1977.  I started off with miniatures and Avalon Hill
games around 1971, and picked up D&D in 1976.

John Snead writes that at 35 he\'s due for his first aging roll (-: -- actually
it\'s at 34, isn\'t it?  I noticed it last year, and though how in 1977 I never
let any characters run much past 3 terms--obviously they were getting too old
to consiider adventures at that age. (-:

As for the deterioration of the TML--go back and look at the archives from
the time when TNE was announced. (Sometime in \'92).  Those were flamewars...

I probably also come close to qualifying as a TML dinosaur, having joined
up in 1990.  Any other long service veterans still lurking out there?  Hans
is still here regularly, and I saw George Herbert post last week...

I concur.  I\'ve always assumed that there was an Imperial Bureau of Standards
(or perhaps an Imperial Standards Institute) that organized that sort of 
thing, as well as providing the data packages for obsolete technology. (IDPs
were mentioned in my MT design collection.)

For whatever it\'s worth, I agree with you regarding "C.T. Book 6: High
Guard."  My support for it is not entirely wholehearted.  I wish, for
example, that the relationship between a ship\'s mass and the output of its
maneuver drives determined its acceleration.  I also wish there were rules
for different types of maneuver drives and power plants (so, for example,
one could design a plausible Tech Level 8 "battlecruiser," with a fission
reactor and an ion drive, or a short-range Tech Level 15 "interceptor" 
powered by high-output batteries).  Aside, however, from a few other
quibbles like this, I tend to think that "H. G." has nearly the right
balance between "realism" and complexity.

will allow the gearheads here to design vehicles and weapons, and happily
use theirs.
        I will be absolutely clear, however, in saying that QSDS is my
favorite TRAVELLER ship design system. In fact, I would like to see it
expanded! COMPREHENSIVE is not the same as COMPLEX. I would like to see hull
tables for 1,2,4 and 5 G\'s. I would like to see the tables extended to allow
much larger ships (maybe up to one million tons eventually). I want MORE
components that can be put into QSDS ships, but I want the system to remain
fundamentally the same. But I do think NAH/FF&S should exist for those who
want to create from the ground up. How about a book with revised and updated
versions of ALL THREE levels of ship design complexity under ONE cover? Then
you can choose whatever you like! And I would VERY MUCH like to see a method
for converting NAH stats
to ratings usable with CT and MT as well as T4, so the book will be as
useful as possible to ALL Traveller fans. (Conversion appendices, not lots
of additional rules).

ummm, no.
The bayonet is a tool, not a weapon
It caused less than 0.25% of the casualties in the US Civil War (and they used them a lot)
They are useless as a weapon. They are a tool, a morale booster, and stinkin\' heavy for a

again, I would rather have a room-sweeper type shotgun with glaser rounds than a

week. (wow!)

I Think the point that is missing here concerning the design systems is 
that most people don\'t want to design vehicles at all!  The vehicle 
design system in CSC was fine for some I suppose but I have 101 Vehicles 
and I don\'t intend to design any.  I would have preferred to see that 
space devoted to pregenerated vehicles and other neat stuff and put the 
design system in the design book.  Starships should have been a book of 
pregenerated STARships, not pages and pages of lifeboats, fighters and 
launches, and the SSDS should again have been in the design book.

So while some may want a new version of FF&S, I think there would be a 
real market for a revised version of Traders and Gunboats, Fighting Ships 
of the Imperium, and my all time favorite, Starship Operator\'s Manual.

As for Alien Archives, I haven\'t commented as I haven\'t read it all yet, 
but the comment it looks like a bunch of D&D monsters is certainly valid 
for the artwork.  The text IS better than that, but this is a case where 
the art actively detracts from the text, instead of just getting in the 
way.  The pictures of Newts in the old Journal were much better!  A Newt 
wearing clothes, and using tools!  Who would have thought it? 

And finally a quick comment on the Foss art.  The thing I think that is 
missing here is people.  Foss doesn\'t draw people, he draws ships, 
vehicles, spacesuits and buildings.  But Traveller is a roleplaying game. 
 It\'s about people. Sure there\'s room for a picture of starships flying 
around from time to time, but the most powerful and most memorable 
artwork associated with the game centers around people. (Where in this 
context, aliens are people too. :)  Look at the covers of the 
Megatraveller Encyclopedia or Player\'s Handbook, or the Rebellion 
Sourcebook.  It\'s the people that make those pictures memorable.  And 
it\'s the portrayal of aliens as "people" in the art in the old contact 
articles that make those pictures work.  The art in Alien Archives fails 
to do this. 

Oh yes, and for the record, I\'m 39.

Yep. That\'s why I went through the GDW-Beta archives, boned up on

It may not be canon but I\'m not publishing any designs and, besides,

Considerably different from using one in REAL (ie war) combat. Only idiots would forsake

Actually IG would not do bad to try to adapt En GArde to a macro-roleplaying supplement

I agree.  I\'d even go so far as to say that there is undoubtedly a large 
contingent of customers and potential customers who don\'t even want to 
design starships.  They want pre-made stuff.

I could go for that approach.

It\'s interesting to think of how long it took for Traveller to get all 
that nifty stuff.  Shoot, for the first three years of Traveller\'s 
existence there wasn\'t much from GDW for the system.  By the end of the 
next three years, there was certainly some good stuff out there.  And by 
the time MT was about to be launched, there was so much product from 
so many companies!  

I know times are different now, but heck, T4\'s only been around for a few 
months.  There\'s certainly time to put out the sort of products you\'re 
talking about - I\'d certainly love to see them! :)

Very true.  And actually this is one of the comments I included in that 
compilation of constructive criticisms of _Starships_ from the TML that I 
sent to Courtney.  I don\'t recall whose post I quoted in that section 
(sorry:(), but it said something very much like what you have said, above.

Actually, you are lunch.....
I agree with you, there probably were cannibals. But I imagine the Vilani, like a lot of 
Terran cultures, are masters of rewriting history. And now, to even suggest this could have 
happened would lead to cries of Solomani anti-Vilani racism

Very nice! At 3kg (6.6 lbs), this would seem to be of a weight equal
to, what, a broadsword? A hand and a half, maybe? Sounds pretty
intrigueing for a bodyguard on some medieval tech world.

Why not just carry a cattleprod?
More fun, and it works great against metal armoured foes

        Yep, count me in. I am 95% through creating an SSDS program in

        I had the same motivation, and it certainly succeeded. The other 
reason is that I have always wanted to write a Starship Construction 
program. 
     
        Anyway, I would more than interested in sharing classes etc and

Whew! I was getting worried; I\'m *only* 37. And I not only have

hit the market at about 85 cents to $1.00 for 8 figures. Nice to

Tres bon! Traveller has gone a long way to stretch not only my
imagination
but also to change the way I view things and to ignite a desire to see
things, to become something akin to a "Traveller". I\'ve pulled out
pictures
of places I\'ve been to and realized that I\'ve personally done a number
of
things my characters have done - SCUBA diving around sunken wrecks,
climbing,
travel to foreign lands (including Paris!), information system security
(and hacking), and trying to converse in languages I don\'t know. FF&S
helped
me understand some of the basics of cold fusion enough to want to find
out
more about it and *that* is the main reason why I enjoyed it so much --
it
*explains* the technology in terms I understand and, thereby, helps it
mean something.

Well, enough of my rambling...

Papua New Guinea.

With wide-spread diet necessitated cannibalism,  the population
would probably be stuck in hunter-gatherer phase and inhibited
from the population consolidation needed  for agriculture, urbanization
and technological growth.  In a culture where the question "Our new 
friend, you will stay for dinner?" has a double entendre, it takes a lot
of courage to be the new guy in town. 

Simply put, wide-spread cannibalism, would inhibit the formation
of larger population units than the hunting tribe, due to the lack of 
trust. Without large population units, no agriculture, no ironworks,
no starships zooming into the unknown carrying the Vilani way of life.

I know that some cultures like Mayan/Aztec were beyond hunter-gather
and practiced cannibalism. But they practiced RITUAL cannibalism,
not a wide-spread diet necessitated cannibalism.

Wide spread cannibalism, means that you and the jerks next valley over
aren\'t ever going to get it together to build that town that will let
you have the crop fields to get off the cannibalistic diet program.

Ok folks, lets calm down about making a CD ROM that becomes the next
BattleCruiser 3000AD 

The CDROM idea was to take what was *already* published (aside from T4 of
course) and put it on a CD in text or hypertext format, with (some)
graphics.  Don\'t think of it as this big development project, just a
republishing of old material in a form that makes it cheap and easy to
distribute.

I believe Roger Sanger gets the credit for the original impetus for the
thing.

I may be completely wrong on all of this, but that was the idea being
kicked around.

Oh, and I for one think it is an excellent idea.

   The sad truth is that just as it appears that the negative comments
are dying down, IG does something else which gets people in an uproar
again.  I don\'t see the same points being talked to death, I see people
finding new things wrong with a particular publication, and lamenting
the demise of <fill in the name of your favorite Traveller version
here>.

>Very occasionally, I see someone address a point, and make a suggestion

   I find the parallels to American sports talk shows on radio to be
striking.  Everybody has an opinion about what is right or wrong with
the team (the game) or individual players (the rulebooks and
supplements).  Many people complain when the team (game) is doing
poorly, and everyone seems to want to jump on the bandwagon when it is
doing well.  Most people have strong opinions about which version of the
team (game) is the best of all time.  Some people believe they have the
answer on how the current generation of the team (game) can be improved
in some fashion.  Of those people who express an opinion, most have
something constructive to add, while some are just blowing a lot of hot
air.  Of course you also have your basic jerks that waste everyone\'s
time (bandwidth).

   There is one big difference though.  The players of the 1997 New York
Yankees baseball team don\'t have to compete directly for the affections
of the fans with the players of the 1927 Yankees, or the 1961 Yankees. 
T4 is constantly competing with previous versions of the game for the
fans\' interest and dollars.  In that kind of environment, it has to be
at least as good as those previous versions, and/or add something new to
the game or it will not get either interest or dollars.  Given the
competition, and the graffs commited early on, T4 has an uphill struggle
against it.

   The problem is, what do you do when you are convinced that the
previous edition that you are playing is such a superior product, you do
not feel the need to purchase the new version?  What do you do when you
no longer have the time or the patience to break in yet another new
version of a game that you already have the bugs worked out of?  These
are questions that must be addressed by IG (afterall, they are the ones
who are trying to sell us something)--and by those who feel disenchanted
with the whole game development process.

I personally run a composite campaign, drawing on all 4 versions for
ideas
and background.  I may not be canon, but I darn well enjoy it, and so
do my players (I hope!)  I\'ve been playing traveller since the early
80\'s
(CT), running it since the mid-80\'s.

For those that care, I\'m in my mid-30\'s, as are most of my players
(except for that rogue 21 yr old I just recruited!)

years.

I first picked up Traveller in 1982 with Starter Traveller, and I\'ve 
been a Traveller junkie ever since.  For the last 15 years, I\'ve 
pretty much role played consistently, and I\'m known for my epic 
campaings.  From 1989 to 1994, I ran an epic D&D campaign with the 
same players.  I took a 2 year break, the longest I\'ve ever taken 
from role playing, and started my current Traveller campaign.  

My players range in age, now, from mid-twenties to early thirties.

And, I guess that\'s it.

I think that melee weapons are NOT the idea of a madman in a T4 
campaign. A then it dawn\'s on me it depends on the GM.  Myself and the 
GM\'s I know are a little stringent with the reality of a situation.  For 
instance, Most worlds we travel on would restrict the weapons that can 
be carried to shotguns and pistols or at the least pathetic rifles.  In 
addition we have played (I beleive this is mentioned in the rules) that 
at contact range no ranged weapon may be used for firing.  More often 
than not Contact range gets closed to.  Especially in a ship or a small 
room.  The benefits of Contact range are many.  There at least in melee 
you can dodge blows and few will fire into your fight.  

Plus when on a starship who wants to chance being blown into space.  So 
for the above reasons I beleive melee weapons should be given more 
status.  I realize ranged weapons are definatly the preferred weapon but

   Like it or not, FF&S addressed a need in the game.  If there was not
that need in Traveller, products like G^3 would have never been
developed in the first place.

   That fact is that you grossly underestimate the number of people out
there who like to tinker with designs.  Not everybody likes to design
everything (some guy might love designing detailed starships, but could
give a rat\'s behind about designing small arms), but if you take into
account all those things that people like to tinker with this or that,
you end up with something that looks an awful lot like FF&S.

  If the "Mod I, Mk 1" version of FF&S had a fault, IMHO, it was that
there was not nearly enough design examples, and no predesigned
equipment tables or modular equipment to speak of (like that found in
the two starship design sequences in T4).  GDW would have done well to
print this kind of material in a "FF&S Design Assistant" manual. 
Needless to say, I would have also paid large dollars for a CD-ROM
version of such a book, complete with design spreadsheets for all the
design sequences in FF&S.  IG would do well to publish "FF&S Mod II, Mk
I", so long as they also publish the other material as well.

   I have a BA in History from a state university.  I have learned to
use Excel to the point that I can now crank out a gauss weapon design
using FF&S in less than 15 minutes.  Phil, it\'s called the end of the
20th century.  Join us before you get left behind.

   OK folks, note the time and date: Phil and I agree on something, and
the world has not ended.  Perhaps there is hope for Middle East peace
yet.

        Another TML member decloaks.

I\'m 31... started in \'77 with the original D&D and "The Keep on the 
Borderlands" - previously to a friend introducing me to RPGs I had
been a complete SPI fanatic (yes, I have the Stargate trilogy! |-))
Moved quickly on to Traveller as soon as it was available, enthused
at RuneQuest II, through many others (including, notably, Pendragon,
CoC, Bushido, T2K, Dark Conspiracy and Ars Magica), settled on GURPS
for a while, flirted with LARPGs for a while in England (I\'m English 
by the way), revisted MT (love it...warts and all), felt sorry for
TNE and came back to Traveller again with T4. 
        Liked the new rulebook, but thought that Starships was a bit 
of a ripoff... good for the ship design stuff but why, oh, why just
repeat the same ships (pretty much) that ALL other revisions of Traveller
have done... at least MT got away with only 8 pages to do the same...
that on top of Trader and Gunboats!

        Personally, when I run my next Traveller campaign, I\'ll still
be using teh MT rules (with errata |-( ). However, I *will* definitely
be buying up the background books and keeping an eye on the sourcebooks.
After all, the differences between CT, MT and T4 are not *that* big a
deal!

Grahame

Also Leading Edge did both the Apc & the Drop Ship in 25mm, have had the

The \'real-world\' stats for the apc are similar to an airport\'s

It would explain a lot. But wouldn\'t Those-jerks-from-the-next-valley-over

    'index' => 'be338',
    'month' => '01',
    'body' => 'OK, instead of whining :-) I\'ve decided to give some thought to how the
design system could be improved --

1) It *MUST* be sequential. That is, you do Step #1, follow with Step #2
and then on to Step #3, #4 etc. There must be *NO* steps that must be
completed from further down in the sequence before you can complete a step
higher in the sequence. (Yes, I *know* that even in High Guard there was
some need to fiddle with the PPlant once the initial design sequence was
done to make sure all the weapons could be powered -- the point is, you
could actually complete all the calculations *before* the final fiddling.
You cannot do this in FF&S -- unless you have a Spreadsheet ... and T4 will
*FAIL* if we assume that all the potential market have home computers, have
spreadsheets, and know how to not only use both to maximum effect, but have
the time and knowledge to create a Spreadsheet program to do all the
scutwork).

This will probably mean that some assumptions will have to be made that
will lessen the "realism" (which is, as has been pointed out,
"bullshittium" anyway) ... and, sure, *explain* what the assumptions are,
and offer an alternative for those self-flagellating gearheads who glory in
such irrelevant minutiae! ;-)

The ideal to follow here is the *very* simple to use, but extremely
accurate and detailed 3G^3 (that\'s "Guns, Guns, Guns 3rd Edition" from BTRC
and by Greg Porter for those wjho don\'t know ... and any self-respecting
{isn\'t that a contradiction in terms ;-)} "gearhead" who doesn\'t have it
*must* get it ... the new edition is just out and well worth it!!!) ...
even a mathematical klutz like me (I\'m a history/english teacher for a
*reason*, guys ... I was no good at maths! I could memorise all the
formulae in the textbook, but I could never seem to match them up with the
problems in the exams ... yet even *I* can use 3G^3 to good effect). It
*IS* possible.

2) If you *MUST* have a non-sequential design sequence, then for ghu\'s sake
do what Greg Porter did (though he didn\'t *need* to do it, so simple and
easy to use are the design sequences in 3G^3), and provide a professionally
done *Spreadsheet* with the game. It would probably be a good idea even
*if* you do adopt a sequential design process. Any *really serious*
gearhead will *WANT* it -- even if it cost an extra $5-10, I would suspect.

3) As has been suggested, delete all the excess steps. You don\'t really
need to know the homopolar generator size to create an NPAWS ... no-one
would suggest that 3G^3 is anything but superdetailed and superaccurate,
and *it* doesn\'t see the need for such nit-picky irrelevance. Collapse them
into one -- have a general formula for NPAWS (or whatever).

For example. Do we really care how many airlocks a given hull size needs?
Or how many cargo locks? This is bullshittium at its worst. It should be
subsumed in the 20% allowance that is hallowed back to CTrav days to allow
deckplans to "make sense". And, after all, it is only *one persons* (well,
maybe several had a hand in it) *OPINION* of what would be needed. 

4) Give both Tables of general data *and* the formula (both a *simplified*
*optimised* one and a nit-pickers one, if necessary) for working out
intermediate steps. So if you desperately *want* a 125 ton Scoutship, you
can design it.

This is more or less what 3G^3 does, and it works.

5) Take the "classic" ships that exist and reverse engineer them so that
the *new* system works with them. In other words, don\'t change the classic
hallowed traditional prices (c. 20 or so MCr for a Type S Scout, for
example), change the g*****n system so that it *gives* those prices (or
close to them). Its the system thats broken, not the prices!

6) Make sure than an average person (not an engineering or computer science
graduate) with a *normal* calculator (or even pencil and paper) can design
a civilian ship in no more than 15 minutes, and a military ship in no more
than 30 minutes (yes, I know that QSDS can more or less do this, but
*Staships/NAH* *HAS* to be able to do this as well). *Completely* design,
from front to back, beginning to end ... at least at the moderately complex
level. If someone wants to use the fine tuning option, who cares if they
take six months do get it "just right" or not :-)

7) In your standard designs presented in the book, give more detail on what
goes in them than the "standard" form, which is patently inadequate for
reverse engineering or customising them.

Well, thats what *I* think, anyway.

>V- Main Sequence Stars are not dwarves. D is the notation for Dwarf.

I disagree with this point. The Sun is a Dwarf stars which is on the main
sequence the MK rating is G2V. D rating is for white dwarfs which are
degenerate stars the only MK rating are DB, DA, DF, DG. DK and DM are too
dim to be observed outside the system. There another value is DC white dwarf
which has a continuous specter and has no equivalency in the main sequence.

White dwarfs are the end of evolution of dwarf (\'small\' if you don\'t like
\'dwarf\') stars (Sun\'s fate). Those stars have very different parameters form
ordinary main sequence (dwarf) or giant stars

They are rocky inside, meanwhile the temperature is very high (not so high
as in a living star) but it can reach 1,000,000 K. The surface temperature
is also very different from usual stars: DB is at 100,000K and DG are around
4,000 K. DK and DM have a lower surface temperature but are consider to be
\'black dwarfs\' because they cannot be observed (this is NOT neutron stars).
The temperature of White Dwarfs lower slowly and fall in an non observable
value. I seems to be relatively fast compared to the total life.

White dwarfs are the last state of stars which have a masse less than 1,4
time the sun mass. Over this value, the electrons are crushed into the
kernel and the star becomes an neutron star (instead of a white dwarf) which
is much smaller and much heavier(per volume unit). The radius or a neutron
star is around 10Km (i think)

5.9 m x 3 m x 3 m this is notably larger than my living room, and somewhat
larger than the largest van I\'ve ever seen.  It\'s basically the size of a
small delivery truck.  Even the nifty IISS Hurricane air raft which is
only 3 disp tons is 5.4 m x 2.8 m x 2.8 m (around the size of a very large
van).  A reasonable air raft will be between 1 and 2 disp tons, much like
the Rolen Ploitesse described in CSC. 

It looks like time to shrink the vehicle bay on scout ships to maybe 4
disp (cramped hanger for a 2 ton craft or roomy for 1).  The 6 ton (MT) or
8 ton (TNE) hanger is simply unnecessary.

Of the two groups I game in, one has up to 9 players of 22 to 35 (3 women),
the other has 5 players of 30-35 (2 women). I\'ve been playing Traveller
about 19 years, AD&D for a little less. We alternate Traveller with D&D,
AD&D, Call of Chthulu and Ars Magica. Thankfully my wife plays in both
groups, otherwise I\'d have had to give up RPGs some years back!

I\'ve introduced some youngsters to Traveller 4 at the BITS stalls at various
conventions, as well as re-introducing a lot of older players whose catch
line was "I used to play this back when it was the little black books...".
This has included Jo Grant and myself running a 1-2 hour demo game every 2
hours over a 10-12 hour day for 3-4 days in succession, resulting in several
thousand dollars of sales for T4 books (rules plus our own products: TLWH,
etc.).

We hope that our dedication to promoting Traveller will be reflected in IG
approving most of the product line which we are sending them as part of the
1997 proposals from CORE. :-)

        I think "canon" is pretty silent about this, but certainly you could
assume that some of the early Vilani communities evolved this way. And,
certainly, others became vegetarian for a while, and others starteds eating
their own deads... but the communities that became dominant were those that,
after a while, found the way to process native food into all that Vilani
bodies needed (goving birth to the Shugilii).
        This could give us an interesting insight into ancient Vilani
history: the early fights between Shugilii-groups and cannibals (made even
worse by the presence of Ancient giant warbots).

        Well, there are bayonets, and then there are bayonets.  The one for
the Brit Lee-Enfield was essentially just a spike on a lug; no cutting
edge, no handle.  Useless for anything but poking holes in people.

        The Crimean war Brit yatakang bayonet I inherited from my
grandfather otoh is a short sword; it\'s easily 2\' long, with this nasty
forward dip in the foible of the blade, and a minimal hilt.  I figure that
they must have tried to combine infantry sword and bayonet into one item
when they came up with that one...  and it sort of changes the rifle into a
pole arm, not a pike.  Scary.

<that\'s not a bayonet... now *this* is a bayonet!>

        Oh yeah...  I read you.  In the background package I just
distributed to my players yesterday evening, I mention this, state that
cannibalism was outlawed for most of the First Imperium, and that calling
Vilani cannibals is a baseless ethnic slur :).

        OTOH, your examples are all based on Terran examples, where the
plant and animal life is, of course, largely edible.  Vland was a whole
different ballgame; while a comfortable planet, it was nowhere near as
hospitable in terms of food resources as Terra was.  I\'d suggest that
instead of being an impediment, in the marginal environment of Vland
cannibalism of some sort may well have provided those Vilani groups that
practiced it enough of an advantage that they were able to eventually
overcome the non-cannibals, consolidate, build up a civilization, and wean
themselves from the Long Pig habit by improving other methods of local food
production.  I could see this happening if they only ate some of their
defeated enemies and enslaved and eventually assimilated the rest...

        And another point; if the cannibalism practiced was essentially
exogenous, it certainly explains their taste for communal living and other
communally-oriented aspects of their culture... "you can\'t eat me, I\'m part
of the group!"

        This, of course, is entirely baseless.  If there is anyone here
worthy of being denounced in this manner, it\'s Ross, who is a model example
of the sadistic, evil, demented GM from the nether regions.  He\'s just
worried that now that I\'m running a campaign, retribution for his
multifarous past sins will come due.

        Of course, his fears are groundless.  I would never in a million
years stoop to his level.  His character (a rather well-done former scout,
I must say), will recieve the same fair and impartial treatment that I will
mete out to all characters.  Ross\'s delusions of persecution are merely the
product of a very guilty conscience.


PS: Ross, Isaac wouldn\'t happen to wear a moustache, now would he?

Last Thursday I went to my FLGS (Ground Zero in Bellevue, NE) to see if
anything new was in and lo! my wondering eyes beheld the Central Supply
Catalog and the Aliens Archive.  I grabbed a copy of CSC, choked briefly
when I saw the price, then bought it anyway.

Glancing over it, I realized that it was good.  Not that there isn\'t room
for improvement, but overall, the CSC is the best product released so far
by IG (I\'ve only glanced at the AA, and I have no use for a collection of
minor races just yet, so I won\'t try to review it).

Comments:
Motif:  I love the cover designs of the books so far.  The black background
with a single red band and bright illo harkens back to the old days of
Traveller.  Very minimalist, very powerful.  Very eye-grabbing.

Layout:  Very well done.  They didn\'t break up the design rules with eight
pages of useless color plates this time.  I like that.  The catalog section
is well-organized and readable.  Placing the rules for equipment use in the
pages nearest the descriptions of the equipment they govern is a nice
touch.  It saves us from the page-flipping "okay, I\'ve found it, now how do
we use it?" routine.  Whoever decided to call the medkit a "KIA" should be
slapped, though.
  One thing that would have been nice is an index.

Interior Artwork:  The black-and-whites are well done, much better than
those in the T4 rulebook.  There is room for improvement though.  For
example:
  The laser cutter (p.31):  I thought rings around the barrels of laser
weapons went out with the \'50s.  Maybe they\'re supposed to be focusing
magnets or something.
  Civilian ATV (p.79):  Looks like it belongs at a monster truck rally. 
With those immense rear wheels and dinky front tires, it\'s more of a "no
terrain vehicle".  Well, at least it doesn\'t look "melted".
  Heavy Tank (p.83):  Why does it look like it\'s moving backwards?  Maybe
because the turret is pointing toward the taller end of the tracks.
  Rolen Politesse (p.85):  Looks pretty slick, but how does the driver see
over its hood?  Ah.  Radar.
  Cargo Manipulator (p.90):  Um... right.  Whatever.  You know, I\'m
seriously beginning to wonder about Foss\' fascination with huge claw-like
things... It\'s a bit too Freudian to me.
  Type II Bot (p.91):  Looks cool, but what the hell does it /do/?  Using
the logic of "form follows function", I can only assume that it\'s a
jet-propelled, radar guided, gravitic bowling ball.
  
Design Rules:  It only took me a few days of reading and experimentation to
figure out building a vehicle.  Of course, familiarity with FF&S probably
helped.  My first attempt was to re-create the Vargr Jetbikes I posted here
a few days ago, and I\'m happy to say I succeeded.  The design I came up
with may even be better in some ways than the original.  IG may have
sacrificed a little detail to the great gods of Playability, but that\'s
okay.  Only a few questions:
  Why don\'t the Aircraft and HP Aircraft propulsion systems need any
surface area?
  Why do Thruster plates have a minimum thrust of 400 tons, when in
Starships they can provide thrust as low as 100 tons?
  Is 1.0 kl really enough space for an interior crew position?  This seems
a little small to me.
  Do crew positions include controls, or is it just the seat?
  How do you calculate power usage for weapons?  If a laser uses
"0.018MW/hr/turn", what exactly does that mean?  Can a MHD power plant
producing 0.300Mw power it, or does it need an enormous bank of batteries
to operate?  If so, why?  Can\'t a power plant, running continuously,
produce enough power to run the weapon each turn?

  And finally...
  Why did IG decide to charge $22.95 for a 96 page supplement, when the
original T4 rules ran for 190 pages and only cost $25 (soft)?  Have
printing costs really gone up that much, or is it just another extension of
"what the market will bear?"  

  That\'s it for now.  Pricing aside, the CSC was a welcome surprise after
Starships.  If everything IG releases this year is as good or better than
this, I think we\'ll all have a pretty darn good year.

What the heck: I\'m 24, and have been playing Traveller since...

...1996. I purchased MegaTraveller way back when , but didn\'t know they
put out any errata -- and my local game store at the time was more
interested in running the WWII museum in the basement than the
game-and-model part of their store and it\'s no wonder they were taken over
by the mall\'s arcade and used to house video games. We never played it,
and after seeing some of the glaring errors, I never bothered to finish
reading it.

I started roleplaying in second grade when a friend who barely knew what
he was doing brought in blue-set Basic D&D and "Into the Unknown". A group
of friends and I were hooked. We were given time off from class two days a
week to sit in the hall and role-play.

we all live in the SAME HOUSE and only 2 people(not including me) are

2. And Now for something completely different.
Want a simple vehicle you can make in the privacy of your own home?  How 
about the do it youself hoverboard kit!   Just go down to the local "Comm 
Shack" and buy the smallest posible grav plate you can find,  Hook that baby 
up to a power cell, add a control panel and CPU to control the hover and 
thrust then put the thing on some nice composite board material. Hop on 
board, crank up the power and Viola!  You\' re flyin!  This can be done at 
TL-9  but not real "FUN" untill TL-12

Go ahead, try it out with CSC\'s VDS, its easy.  The add "accesories" like a 
HUD, microthrusters, more control and programs.   I have made a sport out of 
this In my campain. Complete with "Contests" the PC can or must enter as a 
Macguffin.  It\'s cool little things like this in the game that make it 
enjoyable IMNSHO.  Enjoy!

4. Traveller Psionic Training for wannabe Jedi\'s
So you wanna deflect lasers with your electro-sword eh.  OK hotshot! Gimmie 
a 3.5D(Staggering roll) against the Average of your Telepathy and Awareness, 
and yes you must have both to do this.   Telepathy will allow you to "feel" 
your opponents action, and Awareness will give you "Psionicaly Enhanced 
Dexterity(temporarily)" in order to move your body in such a quick way as to 
delfect the shot.
Point cost?  2 per try!  Getting drained yet?  Even a Zho Duke can only have 
up to 15 so you can do this for 7 actions, rolling each time in combat, 
untill you get drained and "KA-POW".  Of course, there is that rule on 
overuse of PSI, and PSI drugs, that is if you want to fry your brain. :)

5.And now an anouncement
Anyone in the South East US near Jacksonville,FL  there is a convention 
there Around the 22nd of Feb, called JaxCon.  I will be running Traveller, 
other games will be run, and some guy will have his 16 PC LAN Multiplayer 
game setup.   For more info e-mail jaxcon@aol.com.  I will be beta-testing 
my adventure "Planet X"  that weekend there.  Hope to see you there, just 
look for Commander X! :)

Yes, yes, YES! I was just thinking this on my way to work this morning...
The only people in all of the T4 art I\'ve seen so far are in the
Elmore b/w pictures. People keep asking - what is \'Travelleresque\'
art? How about a definition by example - the covers of the Rebellion
Sourcebook, Hivers, Vargr, Solomani and Zhodani. And you know what
those are all pictures of? PEOPLE! Doing stuff! Dressed in funny local
costumes (or rubber suits for the Vargr)! Traveller is not and never
has been a game about starships. That would be Starfleet Battles.
The insides of the greates supplements, the 2 DGP Alien modules
were packed not with pictures of stuff, but people! By more than
one artist too! (Hey! Exclamation marks!) Now, pictures of stuff
are OK too, as long as the stuff isn\'t MELTING!!! Since when has
saggy equalled futuristic? Anyways, if IG wants to improve the 
quality of art in its supplements, get a couple of decent artists,
show them a bunch of old Trav art and say "yeah, do something more
or less like this".

On a positive note, I have to commend IG for sticking with a clean
design philosophy, unlike those unreadable WW books. Eeuugh. I think
Alien Archive was a good start towards better art, but why only 
preliminary/concept sketches? Does real art cost more than 
half-assed sketches? Probably, because IT DOESN\'T LOOK CHEAP!!!
Ooops, that wasn\'t positive. Anyways, keep at it IG.

> Oh yes, and for the record, I\'m 39.

When this thread last come up? I remember it happening
once before at least, maybe this qualifies me for \'TML Old Fogey\'
status. Anyways, I\'m 25 and have been playing Trav for...well,
forever it seems. Somehow, and I was just thinking about this
the other day, I managed to purchase all of the CT Alien modules
before grade 10... and I have no memory of it whatsoever. Also,
surprisingly enough, I was kind of out of the RPG scene while MT
came out, so after subscribing to TML waaay back when and having
my memory jogged that such a thing as MT actually existed, I went
out and managed to get a pretty complete collection of all that stuff
within about a year. For people who are looking for old Trav stuff - 
watch rec.games.frp.marketplace and do the occasional newsgroup
search using AltaVista - it\'s remarkable successful.

          Bear in mind some of us would love to contribute to the debate but are
          \'time-delayed\' a least a month on being able to get hold of the
          products
          to meaningfully join in the conversation.

          Usually by the time we get the books over here, you guys have already
          moved on to the next reviewfest and anything we can say is horribly
          out of
          date or been done to death.

          All I can do is concentrate on stuff published over here - say BITS
          items - and
          hope that their brilliance sets a standard for subsequent T4 books.

          Actually, the one thing I do see is your excellent work in keeping us
          informed Joe.
          May I take this opportunity to thank you for that and say that I think
           you\'re doing
          a sterling job.

Which I agree that\'s not the black body radiation which gives the color (but
indirectly). I was wrong.


>V- Main Sequence Stars are not dwarves. D is the notation for Dwarf.

I disagree with this point. The Sun is a Dwarf stars which is on the main
sequence the MK rating is G2V. D rating is for white dwarfs which are
degenerate stars the only MK rating are DB, DA, DF, DG. DK and DM are too
dim to be observed outside the system. There another value is DC white dwarf
which has a continuous specter and has no equivalency in the main sequence.

White dwarfs are the end of evolution of dwarf (\'small\' if you don\'t like
\'dwarf\') stars (Sun\'s fate). Those stars have very different parameters form
ordinary main sequence (dwarf) or giant stars

They are rocky inside, meanwhile the temperature is very high (not so high
as in a living star) but it can reach 1,000,000 K. The surface temperature
is also very different from usual stars: DB is at 100,000K and DG are around
4,000 K. DK and DM have a lower surface temperature but are consider to be
\'black dwarfs\' because they cannot be observed (this is NOT neutron stars).
The temperature of White Dwarfs lower slowly and fall in an non observable
value. I seems to be relatively fast compared to the total life.

White dwarfs are the last state of stars which have a masse less than 1,4
time the sun mass. Over this value, the electrons are crushed into the
kernel and the star becomes an neutron star (instead of a white dwarf) which
is much smaller and much heavier(per volume unit). The radius or a neutron
star is around 10Km (i think, maybe less)

I took time to answer because I ahd to check my data more precisely.

I did a little experiment last night.  Here are standard 100 ktonne thrust
packages of each of the three main propulsion systems -- fusion rockets,
HEPlaR, and thrusters.  They\'re self-contained; the HEPlaR and thrusters
both include enough fusion reactor to power them.  

I think the results are interesting.  You can design with these packages;
they\'re linearly scalable, just like their components.  This means that
if you want a 100 tonne thrust system, given my results, you can take the
package below and divide eveything by 1000.

Assumes the fusion plant with the lowest power generation on the table
in SSDS is the smallest available; not necessarily true.  My next big
question is what missiles would use for propulsion.  Chemical rockets, 
or fusion rockets (or one of the others at higher tech-levels)?

Another question is if contragrav and a lower-tech propulsion system
like nuclear-thermal rockets (NERVA) or chemical rockets might be more
economical than fusion rockets for low-tech commercial ships.  We don\'t
know yet, of course, since there aren\'t any published rules in T4 for
low-tech rockets.

I\'m 27 this week ( happy birthday to me , happy birthday to me .. ) and
have been gaming since \'81 ish. As for my group the youngest is 24 and the
oldest was 30 yesterday - which reminds me, I haven\'t sent him a card.
Whoops.

Re the ongoing discussion of design sequences - I _liked_ FF&S. I know that
we had to play musical chapters to build anything and sometimes it got a
little too complicated, but I thought that it was exactly what makes
Traveller stand apart from other roleplaying games - the level of detail.
It was a shame that the product had so much Errata, but that doesn\'t bother
me greatly - it was corrected on the Internet and in Challenge anyhow.

The guy who said/implied that most Traveller players do not want to be
gearheads obviously has not noticed the general trend in the game towards
such levels of  detail. It started with Striker and High Guard way back in
the early days, and continued right through MT and TNE to T4. Obviously,
supplements like COACC, High Guard, the Imperial Encyclopaedia, FF&S and so
on _sold_. Doesn\'t that signify that people liked the stuff in them ? That
some people liked the design sequences ?

Yes, for sure there is going to be a level of "bullshittium" in a product
that extrapolates the future, but Traveller has at least tried to predict
things based on real world science. Ever played / watched Star Trek (
heisenberg compensators, solition waves and let\'s not forget the radio
controlled Spock ... ) ?

If you want a hard SF game where there is a minimal level of bullshittium,
then play 2300AD. Strip off Stutterwarp, some heavy duty advances in
material technology, and the existence of extra terrestrial life and there
is nothing in 2300AD which is at odds with the predicted development of
modern day science and technology. It also has the best alien races that I
have ever seen in any RPG including Traveller. It\'s a shame that 2300AD has
not got the following that it rightly deserves, but that is a little off
topic.

IMHO, the design sequences in T4 are actually a retrograde step. Having
made the great leap of unifying all the design sequences into one whole in
FF&S ( at last, only one book ! ) we see them fragmented into many little
and conflicting parts again. Worse still, they are restricted / incomplete.
No vessels over 5000 disp tons, no small scale meson weaponry. Just
components that slot together.

In fact, I think that Starships is _dire_ - the deckplans are next to
useless and there is nothing much beyond TL12 ( great for Milieu 0 but a
little pointless for existing CT / MT era campaigns ) or actually new ( I
must have three or four versions of the Type S Scout or equivalent now ).
But for me the worst thing was that it admits that the design sequences are
based on FF&S ! So why not just reissue FF&S with the errata fixed and some
example vehicles and starships ?

What I think would have been better was a product with at least the
production quality of the MT or TNE products ( especially the Digest Group
stuff for MT, whom IG have yet to surpass IMHO ) which provided detailed
deckplans ( you know, the sort that show you where the freshers are and
have some sort of grid for use with Snapshot / miniatures ! ) and also the
design worksheets for each vessel. That makes them easily customised (
saving the referee time ), and instantly useful in a game ( how many
referees photocopy and enlarge deckplans of standard vessels for boarding
actions and other action aboard, I wonder ? ). Perhaps even some of the
stuff from the DGP Starship Operators Manual to round the book off with
some atmosphere.

BTW, I liked the Central Supply Catalog much more than Starships. It
suffers from slighly poor production quality but on the whole it was
alright.

Traveller CDROM - it would have to be good. On the lines of Traveller meets
Encarta, with a hypertext database of rules, articles, tables and charts
and lots of quality software. Star system and subsector generators, vehicle
/ starship design tools, deckplan clip art, scanned in forms and map grids,
trade utilities, NPC generators and so on. Please no dice rolling tools,
however. Let\'s not forget that the average CDROM is 650Mb - that should be
enough to fit in loads of stuff ( check out the Microsoft Developer Network
CDROM for an entire of just how much you can cram onto a CD - the answer is
_lots_ ).

Anyhow, that\'s it for now. Rant mode off. Check out my webpage for a load
of 2300AD stuff, if you\'re interested.

43 as of last May.  Started RPGing in 1977 doing D&D with massive Fantasy 
Trip insertions, then found Travellar in about 1978/79 played in a 
campaign that lasted until 1982. Then I 1) got married, 2) graduated, 3) 
got a real job 4) had a son .....  Now mostly I collect and theorize --

BUT soon (as promised before :^) I will be playing/GMing with my 14 year 
old !!!!!!.

Actually, if I was working in the Big Dark, I\'d want my suit to be
*brightly* colored in a pattern that was unique.  That would facilitate
rescue, and people could tell me at a glance in my lime green with pink
tiger stiped suit.

Of course a Vargr would find that lovely.

You turned me into a bloody ZOMBIE!!!  Every week my allowance went straight
to The GameTable.  Every waking moment was spent trying to figure out the
next move the Zhodani would make in the 5FW (btw: JTAS #9 still is the best

After he does all this, what\'s his reaction when I announce I\'m joining the

I am 32.  Picked up the 1st Edition LBB\'s back in 1978, at age 14, 
with money made from lawn maintenance.  Ironic, actually.  I\'d been a 
wargamer for over a year.  I bought Traveller thinking it was some 
sort of wargame...  I\'d played D&D before then, but really hadn\'t 
realized that somebody would put out an SF RPG.  I mainly wrote a lot 
of early adventures based on a lot of the Heinlein, Asimov, & 
Bradbury books I was reading early on.  

A bit of trivia for folks who didn\'t join this early on.  For over a 
year after the release of the LBB\'s there WASN\'T an official setting. 
My first addition to the 3 LBB\'s was Books 4 & 5, and Adventure 3, 
Twilight\'s Peak.  I consider the latter to STILL be the best 
adventure written for any version of the game though there have been 
many great efforts since.  1 of my first gaming buddies, Bob Munsil 
still plays Traveller with me semi-regularly on Sunday evenings, 
through the miracle of IRC...  He participated in that very first 
adventure years ago.

Rules:  Well, actually, I use the bug squashed version of MT, at this 
time.  May change on this once Milieu 0 comes out.  I had no real 
problems with the TNE setting, but just didn\'t like having to learn a 
totally new rules system, nor become the engineer that using FF&S 
seems to require.

Current Game:

Well, actually, I run 2.  I\'m running an IRC campaign set in Reavers 
Deep (a very unofficial Reavers Deep, I might add), set in 1116 
around the time of Strephon\'s assassination (A word to my players:  
No hints as to whether the rebellion is happening or not).  I have several ship 
designs, and other things from it I would be willing to post if 
people are interested enough.  These include a number of MT ship 
designs in the TL 10-12 range (may take the time to convert to T4, 
someday), a Robot NPC named GIGO (yup, Garbage In, Garbage Out), and 
a few other goodies.

The other campaign is a ftf that\'s currently on hold.  Running the CT 
adventure, Marc Miller\'s magnum opus, the Traveller Adventure.

Yes, I knew it. I cast my vote and lost. But I can grin and bear it; I
still have my copy of High Guard that I secretly carry around in a brown
paper bag. Now that I\'m done writing, I can finally put some work into
that High-Guard-to-T4 conversion system that I promised so many months

I\'m doing the same, currently converting the Bits product 101 cargos into a
VB/Access program, sorry can\'t give you the source on this one as it\'s
copywrited by BITS and i have to send it to the BITS/CORE group for their
perusal/approval, (If i get it working i\'ll then work on the 101 Plots
(another BITS supplement) and other things as well) for any that are
interested the BITS/CORE web page is http://members.nova.org/~sol/core/
look under products for the current available products.

However any other ideas I\'ll quite happily bounce off you or anyone else,
like why not write a FS&S component building module that will plug \'n\' play
with the QSDS system (Best of both worlds) and if its written as a program
then the Techies can get out their pens and slide rules to create something
and the rest of us use the program.

The only way human wave attacks like that work is if you can overwhelm your
target.  The Soviets made very sucessful use of bayonet charges after the
winter of 1943.. they had the manpower to absorb the massive casulties, and
the Germans soon learned that firepower wouldn\'t stop them, so units tended
to rout at the first sign of a wave.

In Korea, the PRC/NK forces failed to establish that sort of terror against
the Marines and Army, who had access to strong support to blow holes in the
onrushing attack.  The PRA WAr Museum admits to 50,000 KIA in the first 6
months of Chinese intervention.

>And, even if your figures on the Civil War are correct, why are 
>knives still issued to US Marines?  As a tool?

The bayonet was first designed to convert a musket into a polearm.  The last
time the US had an effective bayonet was the 2\' long pig-sticker we put on
the M1903 Springfield rifle.  This gave the infantryman a reach of almost
six feet to stab someone.  With a M9 on a M-16A1, I\'d have to get within
three feet to get a good forceful thrust.

Bayonets are a tool, but a poor one.  Most soldiers and Marines buy personal
knives, usually two.  One "utility" style camping knife, and one good dagger
(I bought a Fairburn MkII.. great 8" double edged dagger.)

Doug, you\'re not alone.  About 9 years ago, my brother introduced me to a
weird game in a red box called \'Dungeons & Dragons\'. Since then, I\'ve
probably spen a whole college education on RPGs, from D&D to AD&D, to CoC
and Over the Edge, before discovering a new source of for my spending (that
is, Traveller).

Well seen as everyone else is doing it I might as well join the

I\'m 27 years old, and started playing traveller, with a starter eddition

systems, but I have recently bought T4 and am very keen to run or play
Traveller again.  However there is just one problem I have just moved
from the UK to Chicago and don\'t know of any gamers in the area, let
alone ones wanting to play Traveller.

If there are any groups in the Chicago area I would appreciate if they

Hi,

I\'m a big supporter of purchasing gaming products locally.  I only buy 
stuff online if I have to (ie, out-of-print stuff and whatnot).  But if 
you\'re in a situation where you\'re unable to buy it local, you might want 
to at least consider buying online.  Once IG gets their web site set up 
for online ordering, give \'em a try again.

I\'ve also had great success ordering from Dragon\'s Trove 
(http://www.dragontrove.com) and Quincey Koziol\'s Titan Games 
(http://www.titan-games.com).  You might want to give the owners of 
either of those sites an email and ask how to order, and how quickly they 
can get the stuff to you.

The only modification I would make to this is that I do not believe that
the Imperium sells anything.  You only get paid ONCE if you do that...and
if the company you sell too goes banko, you no longer have control of the
resource you sold them.

LEASING however...

I want to comment on this.  

It makes sense to carry a number out to 5 decimal places if there\'s a
*reason* to carry it out to the 10,000th place.  It doesn\'t make sense to
do it for a pistol.  Round the darn thing off!

In the design of a starship there are intermediate calculations that can be
carried out that far, *need* to be, because of the scale of the numbers.
The *final* numbers should be rounded.

It reminds me of Armour and Weapon quality optional rules for AD&D. Such
a thing could easily be adaptible to Traveller, for everything from .44
magnums to jump drives.

I think 5 levels of quality is enough detail. If one were to roll a d6
to determine the quality of an item, this could be the table:

1. Poor quality
2. Substandard quality
3. Typical quality
4. Typical quality
5. Good quality
6. Exceptional quality

Here\'s a sample table of possible game effects:

Quality        Cost Mod.    Maintenance   
- ----        ----   ----
Poor           - d6 x 10%       x 2         
Substandard    - d6 x 5%       x 3/2
Typical        0                x 1
Good           + d6 x 10%      x 3/4
Exceptional    + d6 x 20%      x 2/3

I can think of other effects like a reduction in task difficulty or a DM
for using exceptional equipment. (The reverse is also true!) I would
think that Substandard-Good stuff basically functions the same, but
might have different physical qualities, only Poor or Exceptional items
would have task modifiers.

Other things that might be affected by quality include fuel consumption,
power use, item weight, chance of breakage on critical failure...

Note: Modifiers should really depend on the product. Some are highly
variable (smaller equipment), others not (starship equipment, say). The
numbers I chose in the above table are purely arbitrary to show what I\'m
getting at.

Cost modifiers of course, just indicate value. There could be any number
of shysters selling upscale products of poor quality at high prices, or
the possibility exists of high quality products at rock-bottom prices.
(At least that\'s what every Sylea-mart would have you believe)

A quality system such as the above can be abused, no one cares what the
quality of every nut and bolt they own is -- nor is the paperwork worth
the effort. But, I agree with Kenneth. A system such as this can add
some neat roleplaying opportunities.

"Welcome to Crazi Eneri\'s Used Air Rafts! What are you looking for
today? Perhaps you\'d be interested in this little number... it\'s a Ling
Standard Products model 6430 Open topped air raft. Barely used by some
old Newt who drove it to the beach on weekends... I see by your look
that you\'d like something that will turn more heads... Howzabout this
beaut! It\'s an Iridium Industries Stratosfera CX... a little more
pricey, but worth every credit! . . ."

I think if we put our collective minds together, this list could hash
out an interesting optional quality system for Traveller.

Here\'s one GM\'s take on melee weapons and TL:

Melee weapons are an important part of the flavor of my game. There is a
noble _code duello_ on Sylea (LL:8); Syleans of Soc 11+ may carry a
rapier on a baldric. Knights wear a white baldric; non-knights may wear
any color other than white. Adventuresome Sylean nobles can expect to
get into rapier duels on a somewhat regular basis. Higher-ranking
nobility may openly carry a magnum revolver (and ONLY a mag revolver) as
well as a rapier; this exception was recently written into Imperial Law
by Cleon. Folks of SOC 10 _may_ be able to get a permit to carry a gun;
this depends upon personal pull -- PCs have to _roleplay_ their attempt
to get a permit . . . and the price of the permit may be a favor owed.
If your SOC is 9 or less, get a boot knife and hide it well -- Solly,
Cholly.

On MY Sylea, there is a general revulsion to gun ownership. Non-nobles
with weapons are viewed by the man-on-the-lift as _dangerous people_,
lock up your daughters, the barbarians are in town! For the nobility,
the privledge of being armed bears a responsibility: using the gun or
blade irresponsibly results in _degradation_ from the nobility. Having a
sword is a privledge, not a license to kill.

On neighboring Ordun (LL:2), the _code duello_ requires magnum revolvers
. . . and duellists may not wear armor! David Weber\'s _Code of Dishonor_
contains the model for my Ordun duelling protocol -- and the _code_ is
available to _non-nobles_! Folks on Ordun epitomize the saying, "An
armed society is a polite society."

You also have a _good chance_ of surviving a melee; much better odds

That\'s how a high-tech missile attack vs. point defenses works, too . .
. except it only takes _one_ missile getting through the firepower
gauntlet to do real damage. IIRC, the Germans suffered so many
casualties that they _had_ to thin out their defensive lines a lot, too,
and in doing so, the firepower density facing the Sovs dropped enough to
make wave assaults work.

I recall that Reniassance-era musketeers used barrel-plug bayonets to
turn their long guns into pikes. Keeps the cavalry off you; horses don\'t

This is not meant to snipe at an otherwise very interesting and
informative article, but the title of the book is "Field of Dishonor".
The Honor Harrington series is an excellent resource for anyone interested
in running an active duty PC -type campaign, BTW.

Nothing more was heard from the ship and crew who answered the distress
call, more likely.  I\'ve always imagined that the famous mayday signal
from the LBB box cover was issued by a corsair, hoping to lure hapless
good samaritans into an ambush. 

But then, I\'m just a *bit* cynical... :)

  Yes, FF&S is complicated.  Yes, it has bugs (bloody big ones,
  IMO).  Yes, it\'s designed for gearheads.  So what\'s your
  point?  _Mine_ is that when GDW went under, and FFE/IG started
  working on T4, they solicited input from the list.  The sense
  of the list at the time was that FF&S should represent the
  _baseline_ of equipment design - simpler systems were needed,
  but they should be devised through cutting extra info out of a
  system with FF&S complexity rather than trying to patch
  complexity into a simple system later.  This is good; if done
  properly and without error, it means that any piece of
  equipment done with the simplified designs can be created by
  making certain acceptable decisions in the more complex
  sequence.  If you don\'t like the complexity of FF&S, stick to
  QSDS or SSDS!  That\'s what they\'re for!

  No, the Foss artwork, for the most part, is not
  Travelleresque.  What comes to mind for some of it is "Star
  Wars", for some, "Space Opera", for some "Robotech", and for
  some, "<Deleted by Censor>".  But fercryinoutloud, we _know_
  that already - no need to rant publicly any more.  Gentle
  reminders, privately, to IG, will suffice.  And if one
  dissociates the Foss artwork from Traveller, even some of the
  <Deleted by Censor> is _nice_ _art_.

  \'Nuff o\' dat.

  IG:  There are still some problems here.  I have not received
  my subscription issue of JTAS; my FLGS has it.  I thought the
  point of subscribing, beside the convenience of not having to
  visit the FLGS, was to get it _early_.  This still needs work,
  folks - for my FLGS to have it on the shelves before I have it
  in my mailbox means that theirs were shipped from IG before
  mine.  No way.

  CSC and AA: I still have concerns about IG\'s quality control
  and consistency thereof.  However, both of these volumes go a
  long way toward redemption of the sin of releasing Starships.
  My complaints have been hashed over on this list of late; no
  sense in going over it once more.  However, I _will_ make some
  comments about the printing: Consistency of appearance is
  desirable.  On the other hand, the products must be readable,
  and this must take priority over consistency. Large quantities
  of Helvetica at ten points is not readable over the long term;
  the eye and mind both end up straining somewhat - I should not
  get a headache from reading the things cover-to-cover.  The
  larger point size of Alien Archive alleviated the problem
  somewhat; better would be to switch to Times for the body text
  - Helvetica titles and sidebars is OK.

  The Web Page: _NICE_!  This is much better than the old one -
  contains more useful information, presented better, and
  "feels" more like what I would expect a SFRPG site to feel
  like.  The only complaints I have at the moment are that the
  TNS archives are as yet incomplete, and I think that the
  default grey background for the news articles themselves is
  somewhat tacky - not to mention that there\'s one year where
  the text all of a sudden went to double-spaced white from
  single spaced black.  I would offer an Idea: Make the archives
  searchable, preferably by subject, not just date.

  I must also take this opportunity to publicly urge IG to
  reopen discussions with Roger Sanger and conclude an agreement
  that will allow the re-release of DGP\'s old Traveller
  material.  These are resources that Traveller really cannot
  afford to lose, and are representative of the quality that
  will attract people to Traveller.  I fully expect IG to be
  achieving that level of quality by the end of 1997, regularly
  if not consistently - but that\'s no excuse not to take what
  you can get - and Roger started out as eager to get it back
  out as IG should be.  Unfortunately, IG dropped the ball, and
  it is IG\'s responsibility to pick it up and run with it.

  I think I\'ll let Sappy run back to his regular newsgroup...

I\'m 34 years old and starting playing Traveller in 1978.....

I was into models and was visiting the local hobby shop, when I overheard
some guys talking about playing some fantasy game like Lord of the
Rings.....

After speaking with them for a few *hours*, I left the store with a little
white box containing three little brown books.....Original D&D.....

When I returned to the store the next week, I found this neat little black
book with a red-orange stripe.....Book 4 Mercenary.....I was hooked.....so
I asked the guy who ran the store where the first three books of the series
where and he said he didn\'t have them in stock.....

The next week I bought JTAS #3.....and finally after waiting an eternity
(maybe 4 weeks), I got the little black box.....Classic Traveller.....

Since then I have collected almost all of the CT, MT and TNE products.....

My initial thoughts on T4 are much the same as those that have be flying
around the list since I joined a few weeks ago.....so I will not echo that
now.....

The last few products: CSC, AA and JTAS #25 are what I would have expected
from a start up game company good solid materials.....not great mind you,
there is still room for improvement and I truly hope this happens.....

One comment on JTAS #25 specifically involves the Silver Moon Incident,
since when does Traveller have cloaking devices and FTL communications? 
Shouldn\'t the adventure in a dedicated support magazine at least follow the
core rules of the system?  Or did I miss something?

I am 27 years of age, and the youngest of my Traveller group.

I was introduced to Traveller when my friend brought back the Fighting
Ships supplement from the UK waaaay back before I remember. I was
hooked, and sent a bunch of my money and a bunch of my friends\' money
off to GDW to buy a bunch of LBB\'s. (It was a $50 order IIRC, I\'m not
sure how I scraped together that much money :-) This was before Book 7:
Merchant Prince.

I discovered the internet in oh, about 1989-90 and shortly thereafter
found out there were these mailing list thingys and that Traveller
actually had one. Not having an internet account, I was the ultimate
lurker... I downloaded the digests by ftp and read them...

Although I haven\'t played all that much in the last few years, I\'ve
bought lots of supplements and kept up with Traveller\'s transformations.
I\'ve been eternally optimistic about each one, as each change addresses
some aspect of the game that frustrated me. Now, I am glad the pendulum
is swinging back to less complexity and more playability -- it makes me
nostalgic (ahhh simpler times...) I once lent my TNE rulebook to a
friend who had never played Traveller before, but was familiar with
AD&D. He found the rules impossible to learn. I LOVE detail but I
understand the need for streamlining.

It\'s only been since this past year that I\'ve been an official TML
member. So, I don\'t know what the official qualifications for
dinosaurdom are, but I consider myself one of the more recent dinosaurs,
perhaps a tricerotops.

        Good!  The paranoia is setting in, and we haven\'t even started
playing yet.  I guess I did a good job of tormenting him the last time I
reffed, then :).

        And is it my fault if people are really tasty?

        I agree.  Permit me to repost something I fired off back during
exams; it deals with performance, mass, and price, taking the values for
each at a given TL as a baseline and allowing deviation either way at a
price:

        It occurs to me that rather than doing it in 30 1% increments like
I did it, you could have a range of 5 increments of 7.5% each corresponding
to your setup.

During WW2 the Aussie in the desert were given a new type of bayonet
that was triangular 
in shape so that it would no get stuck in the victim.  Most complained
about them 
and got the old style ones back because the new ones could open tinned
food.

I have been playing traveller from \'84 and my wife does play as well.
We have a wide 
background from roleplayer/boardgames/figure(ancients to WW2 + striker
and striker 2)

my views on what books published for T4

T4 Book           A big mess but trying the games anyway
Starships         warned friend not to get it 
CSC                Not what I wanted so will not get it - told friend to
look at it
AA                  Great - some background on new minor races told
friends to
                       look at it

Overall             We will see, not to standards set by previous books
for traveller 

One thing I have noted in a second hand shop there was T4 and
Starships(1-2 weeks after 
I saw it in local FLGS)

As one of the 5% of whiners on the list ;-) I have been accused of not
*doing* anything to help solve the (many, almost insurmountable) problems
of T4. Well, I can assure you that *that* is *not* true --

To whit, the latest version of RPVDS (Role Playing Vehicle Design System)
- -- now known (it sounds better!) as the *SVDS* (*Simple Vehicle Design
System*) is available -- I\'ve posted it to the GDW-BETA mailing list, and
would be happy to post it to anyone on *this* list who would like a copy.
Warning, it weighs in at 324k even zipped and is in Acrobat V3 PDF format
(and has been rendered partly obsolete by a post from Rob Brennan *just as
I was about to mail it* <*sob*>

Still, it seems to work nicely. Can design a reasonable vehicle (and around
24 *now* obsolete **AARRGGHH** vehicles are included as samples), but only
covers wheeled, tracked, and legged ground vehicles at the moment (when I
get *this* fine tuned I\'ll get right to work on Aircraft and Grav Vehicles,
I promise) -- and can do it all (for the ones I\'ve done so far) in around
10 minutes (of course, these have all been straightforward *civilian*
designs and are quite unarmed).

So, if anyone wants to have a look -- and comments (even ones that render
things obsolete, like Robs <sigh>) are *welcome*. In fact, the more cogent
but constructive criticism the better. So, lemme know if you want a copy
zapped to you!

Also, for those of you who have been in Antarctica, Dark Star #2 (my
"Occasional Traveller Resource") is -- and has been for around 5 1/2 weeks
now -- available. 24 pages of (if I do say so myself!) *neat* Traveller
related articles including --

* "Logical Technology Ratings"

* Trader\'s Corner (Bookpads and \'Lectrograph Paper)

* Vilani Military Ranks

* Ila\'u Class Scout Courier (with detailed deckplans and floorplans for
standardised High, Middle Passage Cabins and other facilities -- including
a detailed layout of the living area of the spaceship, showing furniture
and fittings)

* Endeavour Class Survey Boat (a 10 ton small craft for the Ila\'u Scout)

* Emergency Survival System (a better and more logical design than the
"Rescue Ball" in Starships, he modestly says!)

* Medicine and Healing: An Alternative System

* Medical Equipment -- The Traders Corner

* Rank & Retirement Benefits

Now, far be it for me to blow my own trumpet, but one of the prescient
purchasers of DS#1 and #2 has (accurately! <evil grin>) said that it "looks
better than JTAS" ... well, <aw shucks>, what can I do but agree?

Cost? US$8 for the print-on-paper (photocopied -- this is a *fanzine* after
all) version (airmailed) -- and there are 15 left -- or US$5 for the PDF
version (emailed to you). I\'ll even throw in a copy of the latest and
greatest version of SVDS with every purchase (on disk for the pop and email
for the PDF versions!).

Unfortunately, the only easy way to pay is to send *cash* in US currency
(or Pounds stg or whatever, check with me first if its "whatever") -- but,
hey, no-one has complained that I\'ve ripped them off on the list yet, have
they? Write to --

A PDF version of DS#1 is available (all the POP versions are sold, sorry)
for US$5 as well, and you can see a print disabled version (downloadable)
on the Draconis Cluster Traveller Page ... or I can send you one direct so
you can see what you\'re (possibly) getting.

Like I said, a whiner I might be, but I *do* something about making T4
better!!!

My name is Tim Reynolds and I just turned 27 on the 12 ,happy birthday
to me and HAL and Andy Brick.
 I have been playing RPG since I was nine when yet another evil older
 brother introduced me to D&D and  Traveller shortly after our parents
 got on a religious kick about D&D.  I stopped playing Traveller in
 about 85 when I couldn\'t find anybody to game with as they had all
 moved to another base.  Since then I have played lots of different
 RPG including AD&D, Twilight 2000, Cyber Punk, FWRG(best Fantasy in
 my book) and lately WW game.  I always wanted to get back into
 Traveller but never liked, the new stuff enough to buy any.   Then I
 heard Marc was writing new rules and I picked them up.  I must say I
 found the effort worth it.  I followed the IG website connection
 found the mailing list and the IRC line made new friends and became
 amazed at the love people have for their game.  I believe that
 anybody who wants to should be allowed to roleplay and have actively
 recruit young people as well as females.

I believe that age will not be a problem for T4 because lets face it
we have jobs and money this is much better then  having a bunch of
12-15 vampire freaks who have to beg for money, form parents

As for the idea that T4 is not as good as CT, MT or TNE I must remind
everybody that Traveller is not the only game to go through such
troubles, I still spit in the eye of TSR  for changing systems, but I
have learned to accept 2nd Edition AD&D and  have even started to like
the system.  I believe the same can been done for T4, I personally
don\'t notice any major rules errors, then again I don\'t go looking
unless another player spots them, I just don\'t see a need too, I just
play the game and adapt to the problems  later.

Now, I like T4, even with all the problems that the ML has found and
will activity support the game.  I believe the game has just the right
mix of  hard SF to roleplaying ideas.  I play with the SSDS when ever
I don\'t have anything else to do it keeps me busy.  I believe that the
system  can be as good as the current Story Telling type games (Star
Wars and WW)  or even better.  Its just the choice of the players and
GM as to how they play hard or soft  this bit is not in the rules(and
should not be that\'s why I like T4) and cant be fixed by any formulas.

I hope that IG and Sweatpee are getting all this its a great marketing
tool, talk about nailing your customers.

FF&S page 54+ does provide for alternate communications technology using
subspace. Implication in the text seems to be that you would also be using
the alternative subspace drive instead of the jump drive. 

It is an interesting plot; adjusting around the sub/hyperspace references
would be relatively easy. Failed to report back instead of transmission
abruptly cut off. I did like existance of alternate encounters, selection
dependant upon the actions of the players.

Howver, as a Senior Systems Programmer, I am not sure about the idea of
arming computer operators (Room K, Encounter 21).

I am all for free lancing settings; it would be helpful though for any
variant rules to defined somewhere in the adventure. They usually do a side
bar on a change from the basic rules in Dungeon magazine.

  I must also take this opportunity to publicly urge IG to
  reopen discussions with Roger Sanger and conclude an agreement
  that will allow the re-release of DGP\'s old Traveller
  material.  These are resources that Traveller really cannot
  afford to lose, and are representative of the quality that
  will attract people to Traveller.  I fully expect IG to be
  achieving that level of quality by the end of 1997, regularly
  if not consistently - but that\'s no excuse not to take what
  you can get - and Roger started out as eager to get it back
  out as IG should be.  Unfortunately, IG dropped the ball, and
  it is IG\'s responsibility to pick it up and run with it.

[Mark Ayers]  Victor\'s de lurking Hello has inspired me to add a bit of =
a hello for myself.

I\'ve been at Traveller since the early days and will be at it for many =
more. I am a gearhead in that I like to design equipment and starships. =
For that reason I really like FF&S. The best of all worlds would be a =
completely tableless design system. Give me the formulas and realistic =
reason for limitations and off I will go. I have designed innumerable =
spreadsheets, WordBASIC macros, VBA macros, BASIC and C++ programs for =
personal use.

Even more than stuff though, I love to design places. Lots of places. =
Whole galaxies of places. Down to their most imitate details. I other =
words, I like the control of gaming in a setting I have created. Sure I =
am influenced by the wild and wholly Spinward Marches of CT days and the =
RC of TNE. I especially like what I have gleaned from Marc Miller about =
the nature of the nobility in Milieu 0.

2 cents about the current IG situation. I am confident they will rebound =
from their early mistakes. But then, when did my gaming group ever =
worship a rule they weren\'t trying to use to manipulate a referee?

[Mark Ayers]  Ross says=20
I just noticed that T4 has changed the shipping costs for cargo from =
Cr1,000/ton to Cr4,000/ton.

[Mark Ayers]  Yes it changes things. I did a breakeven analysis on a =
stock freetrader at the new freight carrying rate back during the =
discussion of the economics of bank lending for Freetrader purchases. =
Cr4,000 makes, IMHO, a much more realistic outcome. But then I play with =
all the economic numbers anyway. Gotta keep the poor purser guessing =
even if he is trader-8 broker-8.

I can\'t agree enough. What I have seen of DGP\'s input, comments and ideas
in their products (after correcting their typos) was absolutely first
rate. IG could do *much* worse than reestablishing this relationship...
not only because I would *love* to see what they would make of a post-
rebellion setting without the virus...

I bought my first boxed set after reading the review in Dragon #18

when I went to my first gaming convention[Winter Wars] where I ended up
playing in the Traveller tournament, that would later become "Shadows"

I got hooked, and have collected and played ever since

I helped judge a 4 day event at Gencon called "Prisoner of Paradise"

I was saddened to see GDW go boom, but maybe we can look forward to it
rising to new heights.

Great idea, if financially feasible for IG. This kind of detail can
add alot of atmosphere which is one of the reasons why I was so glad
to pick up CSC; I\'m using it as background info for an 1100s campaign.

I\'ve been playing Traveller since 1996, when noted TML slander artist Ross
Coburn introduced me to the game.  The first campaign that I played in was
rather shortlived, as we managed to blow out the M-drive and burn the ship
up in the third or fourth session.  My other RPG experience has been
minimal; I played a bit of D&D in the early 80\'s, but gave it up: I found
it annoyingly unrealistic.  I still diss it every chance I get.  About 3
years ago, I started playing Vampire:The Masquerade.  I enjoyed that, but
am now somewhat bored.  After 3+ years in law school, the horror of slowly
being changed into an inhuman bloodsucking monster seems pretty tame :).

        As I\'ve mentioned, I\'m getting a Traveller campaign off the ground.
I\'ll use the opportunity to playtest the system, and will bore you all

Yeah, but you might have to in order to *graduate* in your major. <g> If
not spreadsheets then certainly statistical software like SAS or SPSS.  

My first degree was in Pol Sci, History & Econ, in those days it was called
Social Science Interdisciplinary. In that program we had to learn how to
use computers well enough to do statistics and run simulations. My Profs
drilled in the facts and theory, but they graded on how well we *analyzed*
and interpreted, and often we analyzed the data with computers.

I remember a project in one political science class where we had to dig out
data from old census records and do a statistical analysis of the changes
in economic and social character in a political district...and then project
the effects of those changes on the voting habits of the district.  The
election that fall sort of provided the baseline for the instructors
grading. <g>  

In another class we had to analyze the birth and death records over a
period of time in a colonial city, and determine things like changes in
life span, number of children per family, number of children reaching
maturity, divorce rates, etc. The next step would have been to draw
conclusions from the data, we didn\'t get that far in that course, but I
remember the Professor eventually got an article out of our research. 

Don\'t tell me social scientists don\'t use computers! <g>

T4 does not change the cost for cargo.  It has been 4,000cr/ton since
Merchant Prince.  It was that way in MT and TNE.  You are confusing cargo
with freight.  Freight is what you carry for someone else, cargo is what you
buy to resale.  T4 doesn\'t state what you get for carrying freight.  It is
part of what IG lefted out of the Trade and Commerce section.  Now as a
referee you can decide how much to give to carry freight.

The average age is about 27 or so.  I just wanted to see how many of you
were going to be around when I croak, still buying Traveller stuff.

Its great to hear the stories, though!  Since this has evolved beyond
its humble beginnings, I\'ll give a blurb.

I started playing Traveller in 1982 at 15, played ADD until it sucked
too bad, then played Rolemaster.  Had some hokey campaigns, but kept
playing Traveller for the whole time.  In 85 I joined the USAF in search
of Pilot-1 skill, went off to the school for wayward boys in
Colorado(topsecret USAF-only code there!) then went to pilot training.

Since I didn\'t play Traveller there, I sort of absorbed the universe
through DGP\'s books and GDW\'s stuff.  Rolled "battle" on my duty
assignment in 1991, flying the mighty B-52 TL5 bomber, flew the TL7 B-1B
afterwards and life has kind of dragged a bit since. (A battle tour will
do that to ya\'.)

I\'m now in San Antonio learning to teach kids how to fly jets, and
wondering if...

both the GM perspective and the player\'s perspective.  What kinds of 
things can happen, what should be avoided, and whatever else we can 
think of.  It will be an "open floor" discussion, with no guest 
speaker and no moderation.  Just jump right in and join the 
discussion, or sit in a corner and listen.  

As always, we are on undernet, #traveller, and the server of choice 
is:

Last week\'s walk-thru of SSDS was, unfortunately, canceled at the 
last minute.  We were fortunate to have Sinbad Sam with us, and he 
kindly did a walk thru of VDS for us.  Thank you, Sinbad Sam for 
sharing your knowledge with us.  (btw, anyone I promised a copy of 
the log, please email me, I lost my list :-(   )

Coming soon:  Design Workshops.  We are in the planning stages of a 
series of Design Workshops to do walk-thrus of all the design systems 
we can think of, QSDS, SSDS, VDS, 3G3, and have even had an offer for 
doing a retro-walk-thru of High Guard and Striker.  FF&S, anyone? <g> 
These would take place on a night or weekend other than our Thursday 
night sessions, so email me your preferences.... I\'d especially like 
to hear from our overseas list members... what time of day is good 
for you (please try to translate to one of the US time zones for this 
time-zone challenged person... I am learning <g>)?

I am also actively soliciting good topics for our Thursday night 
sessions and, when appropriate, volunteers to lead the discussion.  
Anyone want to volunteer to lead a discussion about Wolrd Detailing?  
Someone familiar with World Builders Handbook, perhaps?

I\'m a big fan of both TNE _and_ the RC. Given GDW\'s decision to Virus the
Third Imperium, the RC was inevitable.

I happen to love the RC\'s attitude: the one that says "Never Again" to the
excesses of the Imperium.

You said it! I\'m also fascinated by the tech and the competing societies. 

Any of you read his two novels set in the universe of TFG\'s _Starfire_?

for about 10 years. A friend and I ran a shared campaign (a playing style
which I heartily recommend) during university. The classic rules were easy
to play, though the lack of explanation of the technology led to some
pretty strange rules interpretations. The thing that most interested me was
not the rules, but the adventuring potential I saw in the game. The other
RPGs we played tended to stick to fairly stereotypical story lines, but the
Third Imperium had enormous freedom for plots and adventures. The players
could be merchants, mercernaries, explorers, scientists, criminals,
trouble-shooters, ambassadors, entertainers, working stiffs, and
enterpreneurs on a hundred different planets with a dozen different
technologies. We did a lot of wild stuff and never repeated ourselves.

The campaign started to wind down when MegaTraveller came out; partially
because we didn\'t have as much time then and didn\'t like the new rules, but
for me the Rebellion Milieu just wasn\'t as interesting a place to adventure
in. Sure there were a lot of interesting wars, but there seemed to be less
for players to do. Trade and exploration seemed pointless, and the players
were insignificant in combat with those enormous fleets zipping around. The
sessions began to turn into \'firefight of the week\'. I never played The New
Era, nor did I have any interest in it. In my opinion the game destroyed
everything I liked about Traveller and promoted everything I disliked. I
take it this topic has been debated to death, so I won\'t try to add any
more gasoline to the flamage.

The reason I mention this at all is that, to me, Traveller is not the
combat rules or design sequences or SF technology or the adventures, but
the story of the Third Imperium. Unlike most other game settings you can\'t
describe the whole thing in just a sentence. And like my favorite books and
movies, I sometimes find myself just sitting and thinking how wonderful it
is.

Hey Tom,

The original game, what we now call CT, was started in the year 1105. 
 Each real year represented a year of time in the Imperium\'s 
history, and the JTAS kept up with the events that happened as we went
along.

I\'ve got to tell you, it was neat seeing the Fifth Frontier War and 
the Rebellion unfold right before our eyes in real time.

Same here.  I like the 1100\'s.  If you are going to play Traveller, 
you might as well start with the good stuff.

BTW, I never liked the TNE setting, and when they first announced M0, 
I was resistance.  But I gotta admit, I\'m starting to like the idea 
of M0.  I see some really fun adventure possibilities.  

The frontier, new contact, and all that.

Damn, Glenn, what a reply!  I\'m glad I didn\'t suggest anything about 
jumpspace!:)

Since the system might not be for everybody, I suggest that it be 
optional.  You have you basic system used in QSDS or SSDS or FF&S or 
whatever which uses base line equipment, periferals, and parts.

The specific quality stuff will be, as you suggest, variations on 
this base line stuff.  It could have plus this or negative that.  

This would keep the system totally optional but mutually integratable 
with the base line system.

I like it.

Boy, you ain\'t kiddin\'.  In my experience with talking to other 
Traveller players, they are always changing the rules.  Everyone, 
including myself, has a house system.

What that tells me is that there are problems, historically, with the 
Traveller rules, regardless of the edition.  People don\'t change the 
rules to other games near as enough.  I\'ve got a new player straight 
from AD&D who commented this to me.  He said that he never questioned 
the rules--they seemed right and we used them.  With Traveller, we 
are always questioning if the game mechanic accurately portrays what 
it is meant to.

Yes.  You are definietly right.  What attracts people to Traveller is 
the atmosphere, the story, the versitility, the history.  It\'s not 
the earth shaking game mechanics.

Traveller is a universe that I would read about.  It attracts me much 
in the same way Star Trek does (but has a much different feel).  I 
like it better than Star Wars.

And what is cool about it is that you can have any kind of campaign 
with Traveller.  You want a David Drake Hammer\'s Slammers 
adventure--it\'s there.  You want a Star Wars type, well OK.  You want 
Aliens, no problem.  You want any number of science fiction universes 
from novels--well, it\'s got that too.

You can play the Imperium as written, or it is easily adaptable to 
any type of science fiction that your heart desires.

It is what keeps us all coming back.

One of the very basic things I like about David Weber is his ability to
write personal drama (Honor Harrington) with just as much color and
excitement as his combat scenes (interpersonal, ship-to-ship, and fleet
actions), and still be able to give us background and insights to Honors
Universe _WITHOUT_ getting bogged down or lost in _any_ one part of it. 
Basically, he reminds me of H. Beam Piper and Jerry Pournelle - wrapped up
in
a single author!

    'body' => 'Well... I finally got some spreadsheets, and at this point I\'m basically
willing to throw my hands in the air and go on blind faith and hope
whoever created them knew exactly what he was doing, despite their
tendency to freak out and excitedly flash #VALUE! at me in half the
cells in a sheet... At any rate, I can design NPAWS now, which makes me
happy, and that\'s a start. Many thanks to Chris Cox, who emailed them to
me, and to whoever at the Vyborg campaign page wrote them.

So I\'m finally ready to knuckle down and dust off some very
highly-refined military starship design concepts -- some of which I\'ve
been nursing along for literally years -- but I\'ve got two specific
questions first, because a lot of the folks out here are elbow-deep in
That Which Is To Be, and after referring to individual to individual,
I\'ve given up trying to figure out who is doing what. For what it\'s
worth: Wildstar, Joe Walsh, Dave Golden -- if you guys read this along
with everybody else en masse, I\'d especially value your input.

First: Are we going to have a CHOICE between an advanced design/combat
system (the two drive each other) that treats a missile launcher as
basically just another weapon -- with complete fire control for
everything it can launch -- and treating these swarms of missiles as
individual munitions? Which may be more realistic, but completely
unmanageable for fleet combat as far as I can imagine. It makes my feet
itch. Why for pity\'s sake can\'t we just assume a default of a
semi-active radar homing missile with adequate fire control for each
tube (you get a lock, you shoot \'em; nice and easy, just like in the old
days), with additional options for the gearheads? Or something?
Anything?

As you can likely tell, the whole issue of mismatching numbers of
missile tubes versus the number of missiles the MFD will control versus
maintaining your target locks during flight and remembering which ship
launched \'em is still driving me up the wall. As a gaming and design
issue, it is terribly kludgy and in-elegant, particularly when you take
into account that the little thingies you are going to so much trouble
to track do such miniscule amounts of damage.... and I don\'t think the
kids will get it. (No, do NOT tell me to wait for fire and forget
munitions in the new FF&S. They\'ll probably be as expensive as hell, and
I like building cost-effective ships. Unless THEY are considered the
universal default...? That might be nice. What kind of missiles were we
shooting at each other all those years in CT and MT?)

Second -- and heretofore totally unaddressed anywhere I\'ve looked -- To
Be Agile Or Not To Be Agile in T4? And if so, by what means? Thrust to
weight? Thrust to displacement? And with what qualifiers?

Whatever combat system emerges from the welter of discussion of the
digest will have to include different levels of complexity (Easy vs.
Advanced ship combat) without radically affecting the efficiency of each
ship design. Excellent examples of this are the differing (x10) armor
ratings for role-playing and ship combat systems =96 you\'re still talking
about the same amount of armor; you\'re just looking at it differently.
Higher rates of fire give better chances to hit in an advanced combat
scheme, but merely do a bit more damage in the basic one. That\'s fine,
too. Not precise, but workable. It\'s almost like going from SSDS to
QSDS, if you see the parallel.

But if whoever is writing up the advanced starship combat system
suddenly decides to include combat agility as an expression of weight
versus excess thrust (or power output, as in MegaTraveller), all your
QSDS and SSDS ships suddenly turn into crippled pigs. That is not fine.
It\'s horrible. (I don\'t wanna design a whole slew of killer-diller
starships and have them turn into crippled pigs, so I\'m trying to get
the scoop. Presumably, neither is anybody else. That sort of whiplash
has already been inflicted on a whole generation of first-time buyers
with the whole QSDS versus SSDS versus impossible-stock-ships thing. I\'m
not sure the market will absorb another. I sure as hell won\'t.)

Plus you fall into the ancient hideous trap of having to refigure
everything else to figure your maneuver drive because it apparently
doesn\'t produce enough thrust to push itself, then you need a bigger
power plant because the maneuver drive requires more power, then a
bigger maneuver drive because the bigger power plant weighs more... That
sort of thing drove me stark raving rat-bastard mad for years. It is
reassuringly and refreshingly absent in the T4 system, despite the other
teething pains, but I have a nasty feeling it will come back to haunt
me. Why else are we figuring out in SSDS how HEAVY everything is?=20

So I suggest that we head this nightmare off at the pass by going with
extra tons of thrust versus displacement to determine agility =96 you buy
a 10G drive, then you have, say, thrust 6 and agility 4. Or you can
"channel all power to maneuver drives!" for \'emergency agility\', or
parcel your total G-ratings between thrust and agility as you please by
making Engineering rolls ["Dammit, Scotty, get us out of here! I need
more power to the thrusters!"].=20

You can justify all of this by saying that once you discover artificial
gravity [only a verrrry narrow cross-section of emerging civilizations
won\'t, and it is arguably easier just to have a game supplement to cover
them], weight effectively becomes a moot point as far as propulsion is
concerned. And it would be workable for all different kinds of
propulsion: chem rockets and bullshittium intertialess thrusters alike.
Whatever they come up with, it ought to be non-tortuous and easy to
remember while maintaining internal consistency with the physics of the
Traveller universe.

Anybody know? Missile fire control and combat agility in T4 -- what\'s
the digs?

Long Live The Imperium!

Scout/Courier: Using a 100-ton streamlined wedge hull, the scout/courier
is intended for exploration, survey and courier duties, with many in
service throughout known space. It is used when a ship of long-range
duration and high sensor capabilities are called for. The ship is
capable of operating for months without returning to a base or home
planet.

While the scout/courier can be operated by a single man, it has normal
crew of six (2xManeuver, 2xElectronics, 1xEngineer, 1xCommand), and may
also include a gunner. There is 7 small staterooms, so if the crew is
willing to live in double-occupancy, 3 passengers can be transported.

The PEMS sensor has folding sensor array, and works as P3 when folded
and P5 when opened.

The scout/courier is fitted with one 3-ton turret socket, which can be
fitted with a laser turret (LTM-115-5-2), missile turret (MTM-7-10-2),
sand caster, or 3-ton socket liferaft. Power surplus is only 0.5 MW, so
laser turret can be powered by tuning down other equipment.

Free-Trader: Using 200-ton streamlined disk hull, the free-trader is an
elementary interstellar merchant ship, carrying cargo and passengers. It
is used as the primary trade and passenger mover in the imperium. Other
civilizations have similar designs for the same purpose. It has the
capability of entering atmospheres, making it good for service to
planets without orbital platforms or stations.

Free-trader can be operated by 2-man crew, but has the normal crew of 6
(2xManeuver, 2xElectronics, 1xEngineer, 1xCommand). There is total of 18
staterooms; 6 for crew and 12 for passengers. If gunners or stewards are
required, the passenger allowance drops to 10.

The free-trader is fitted with two 3-ton turret sockets, which can be
fitted with laser turrets (LTM-115-5-2), missile turrets (MTM-7-10-2),
sand casters, or 3-ton socket liferafts. There is no surplus power, and
weapons can be powered only by turning of non-essential systems (fuel
purification plant, artificial gravity in cargo hold, radio transmitter).

Is THAT what the RC\'s attitude was?  I thought it was more like:

"We have the moral right to go in and steal the property of, or outright
  depose, any government we don\'t like - on the grounds that our
  supposedly democratic band of techno-despots can put it to better use
  than the other, less ambitious techno-despots.  We\'re not satisfied
  with just one planet, see.  And heck, even if some people say it\'s
  not moral, WE have bigger GUNS!  That MAKES it right!"

"How\'d we come up with this policy?  Why, our good friends the Hivers
  suggested it to us..."


The RCES are the direct spiritual successors to that oldest RPG cliche,
  the heavily-armed group of misfits who engage in breaking and entering,
  looting, armed robbery, mass murder, etc. secure in the knowledge that
  "it\'s okay, they\'re just orcs."

Me, I gave up dungeon crawls years ago.  Sorry.

I\'m 34 years old and starting playing Traveller in 1978.....

I was into models and was visiting the local hobby shop, when I overheard
some guys talking about playing some fantasy game like Lord of the
Rings.....

After speaking with them for a few *hours*, I left the store with a little
white box containing three little brown books.....Original D&D.....

When I returned to the store the next week, I found this neat little black
book with a red-orange stripe.....Book 4 Mercenary.....I was hooked.....so
I asked the guy who ran the store where the first three books of the series
where and he said he didn\'t have them in stock.....

The next week I bought JTAS #3.....and finally after waiting an eternity
(maybe 4 weeks), I got the little black box.....Classic Traveller.....

Since then I have collected almost all of the CT, MT and TNE products.....

My initial thoughts on T4 are much the same as those that have be flying
around the list since I joined a few weeks ago.....so I will not echo that
now.....

The last few products: CSC, AA and JTAS #25 are what I would have expected
from a start up game company good solid materials.....not great mind you,
there is still room for improvement and I truly hope this happens.....

One comment on JTAS #25 specifically involves the Silver Moon Incident,
since when does Traveller have cloaking devices and FTL communications? 
Shouldn\'t the adventure in a dedicated support magazine at least follow the
core rules of the system?  Or did I miss something?

inanimate objects, so you cannot damage a lock with it, however you cannot
fire it through an opening of less than an arrow slit in castle, this
sounds fine until the mage is faced with an armored knight in full plate

I hate to dull your enthusiasm (and to repeat the following which has been
said on the TML time and time again), but the original DGP - the writers and
artists who created the Traveller products - are no longer anything to do
with the DGP that is owned by Roger Sanger. I wholeheartedly agree that it
would be useful to have direct access to the old DGP material, but T4
products are allowed to use DGP material anyway provided they don\'t quote
verbatim, so most of the \'value\' of the DGP material will (I assume)
eventually make its way back into the T4 marketplace in IG products.

Even should DGP be licensed to *re-*print their stuff, don\'t expect to see
*new* material from them but DO be thankful that Roger had the foresight to
grab their archives before they were lost. Roger\'s DGP now has its own
\'vision\' of a RPG product.

This posting is intended to remedy the strange glazing over of the eyes
(shortly followed by loss of all common sense and then brain death) that
affects anyone mentioning the name "DGP" on this list. Take one pink pill a
day and repeat 100 times "It\'s not the same DGP."

    'body' => 'Hi all:

First off, I wanted to stand up and be counted as one of the folks who has
noticed that IG seems to be improving both their products and their apparent
interest in getting a good product out to the fans and potential fans.
 Though I am a die-hard CT player, I do indeed purchase every T4 product with
the same dogged determination that I fill in my beloved CT/MT/TNE collection.
 The rules are of little use to me, but the rest of the info can be "morphed"
to fit any campaign.  AA (despite it\'s use of the typeface for the senior
citizen edition Reader\'s Digests -- HEY!  Maybe they know the age of their
audience! ;-)) was a vast improvement as was CSC (barring ugly illos -- but
it could be worse).

JTAS was a surprise to me in that it did not "look" like, well, Challenge.
 But then, that was my own improper expectation.  It more resembles SOTK\'s
various genre magazines -- not a bad thing other than I would like to see it
get its own distinctive appearance.  So there is room to improve, but it
isn\'t a bad start.  I also don\'t consider it such a bad value for the price
in today\'s current gaming market.  You are indeed plunking your $5 down for a
publication that is ALL Traveller and not one Traveller article amidst
assorted could-care-less things and adverts.

ALIENS
A few digests ago someone mentioned the Colonial Marines Technical Manual for
Aliens.  That can also be had through a company called "Star Tech" who sell
all sorts of things for media: B5, XFiles, Star Trek, Lost In Space.....
 They also offered the technical readouts for the  AD-17N "Comanche" Assault
Dropship and the M114A1 "Powell" Mobile Infantry Combat Vehicle.  BTW, all
three things are way cool.

AGE
And last but not least -- and since some of the rest of you spoke up so
boldly -- I\'m 35.  I got a late start gaming in 1980 with D&D, and though I
purchased such goodies as the CT rules HB and various and sundry aliens
modules back then, I didn\'t actually start playing until two years ago in the
genre.  Now it\'s one of my all time faves!

Our main GM is 38, and two of the players I know the ages of are 31 (the
Munchkin) and 27-ish (Mr Ninja).  That is not because we can not find younger
players, mind you, but because we do not look for them since our playing
schedule is rather odd and late in the night to accommodate working
schedules.

I played in one of the games IG ran at GenCon 96 and I was one of two females
(the other was attached at the hip to her boyfriend who attended, but still
pleasantly active in the game), and I would guess the ages ranged from 19 to
35-ish, those of us who were older had been playing Traveller previously, the
younger bodies were newbies to it.

Oh, yeah, one more thing....

My FLGS reports that T4 is indeed selling well.

I\'m outta here,

Well, it\'s usually the Aslan _ihatei\'s_ inability to overrun Tobia I rant

long after it started, so long ago that I can\'t remember how long ago it

Amen! I remember opening up my JTAS, reading the Traveller News Service
announcing first the appearance of a Zhodani battle fleet in the 
Regina system(?), then the declaration of war and feeling a chill of
dread go up my spine. My very *first* thought was "what\'s going to
happen to my ship?".  I ended up as a Navy auxillary escort and got
into some pretty mean engagements (using High Guard).

With all the people delurking to give their bio, I figured I\'d join
them.  I\'m 25 (young for this list it seems) and have been gaming 
since about 1980 (I was pretty young...)  Like most people, I got
my start in D&D.  To be honest, I never got into Classic Traveller --
I could never find the basic rules for it -- lots of supplements,
but never rules.  (I could\'ve ordered it I suppose...)  I eventually
got into AD&D, and later science fiction games -- I\'ve GM-ed fairly
long campaigns of FASA\'s Star Trek and Doctor Who games, along
with TSR\'s Star Frontiers and West End\'s Star Wars.  I still
occasionally GM AD&D and Star Wars games and am trying to get my wife
to try out some games (It worked on my little brother... :-)

My first Traveller purchase was TNE.  To be honest, I found it too
complicated for my taste -- both in mechanics and setting.
I was excited when T4 came out, as it seemed a chance for me to 
get into Traveller from the beginning.  I liked the basic rules --
fairly simple mechanics, very playable in my opinion (after 
downloading the errata...)  I found I could make a character within
half an hour on my first attempt.  Like everyone else, I was 
dissapointed  by Starships (I\'m a guy who loves deckplans, and I was 
very unhappy with the plans included).  I\'ve got CSC as well.  

My problem is... "What do I do with all this stuff?!?!"  I\'m
anxiously awaiting a setting.  While I like to consider myself
pretty creative, I no longer have the time to develop everything
from the ground up -- I\'m married, I have a job which requires long
hours, etc.  I am waiting for the release of M0, which to be
honest, will likely determine if I continue purchasing Traveller 
products.

One question I will throw out for all you oldtimers... Can you
reccomend some (commonly available) CT products which will 
give me some inspiration as to the background of the Third Imperium?
I\'ve seen the Spinward Marches available, along with the Traveller 
Adventure.  If you wish, email me privately and I\'ll post
summaries to the list.  Reccomendations for websites are also 
welcome -- I\'ve seen a few which have nice histories of the Imperium.
I\'m looking for inspiration; something which can serve as a spark for
the creation of a campaign; something(s) to get me in the proper
Traveller frame of mind...

And what do you think the Civil Wars Milieu will bring? (shrug) Sounds
like a typical government to me.

"The only difference between a mass murderer and a government at war
is body count."

I, for one, was amazed that the Controlled were "contained" by the
Imperium and not just nuked into oblivion. A very pleasant surprise.
Maybe that\'s what allows the Imperium to last until Dulinor cops the
same attitude described above (i.e. the moral right to take the
Iridium throne). Curious how immoral acts arise from moral rights.

I joined "late" in the might Traveller PBEM (I still think of it as the

My understanding is that previous service in an active unit is also
required for applicants to U.S. Special Forces such as the Navy SEALs,
etc. and that such applicants go through a rigorous application training
before being accepted.  Any U.S. military lurkers out there who can
confirm?

"During the Crisis the specifications were sent by Scout/Courier to Sylea.

The Commander then let out a rather hearty laugh, and invited the TNS to 
drinks of his specialty called "Green".

Quite frankly, I suggest you start with the adventures. The Traveller
Adventure is VERY excellent, and it includes a subsector for campaigning
in. "Twilight\'s Peak" is the MOST excellent introduction for a mature
gamer (IMHO), it also includes a fairly interesting subsector. "Kinunir"
is also a good campaign starter. Other possibilities (because they
contain subsector maps and/or offer long-running adventure seeds)
include "Signal GK", "Leviathan", and "Expedition to Zhodane".

"Prison Planet" and "Nomads of the World-Ocean" offer long-running,
if one-dimensional, adventure seeds, and could be quite good if refereed
and played with great care. If the players get bored and want to move
on, tho, the game could really stink if you don\'t have other options.

If you despise canned adventures too much to buy them, or just want
general background, get the two "Library Data" supplements or  MT\'s
"Imperial Encyclopedia"; these both contain mostly the same information.
Great stuff! This info is what first gave Trav its reputation for having
a great background. When I saw "Library Data" for the first time, I
immediately trashed my own long running campaign and became a convert to
the GDW universe. No other game offered backgrounds this good at that
time. You\'ll still need to buy "Spinward Marches" or "Solomani Rim" to
have an astrography to travel through.

Have fun; I envy the wonder that awaits you!

Which suggests Traveller\'s rules are adaptable enough to handle

    'body' => 'RE: the Age Thread: I guess I might as well chime in. (I\'d have posted
earlier, but for the past two days I\'ve been debilitated by a pinched nerve
in my back. Eeeyow.)

I\'m a 31 year-old science fiction writer, editor and reviewer with a BA in
Creative Writing from Concordia University in Montreal, the city I now call
home.

I discovered RPGs in \'79, when _Time_ ran an article about GenCon. A
Tolkien fanatic, I scrambled immediately to grab a copy of AD&D (a game we
all complained about endlessly, but played anyway. For years its
competitors were just too cumbersome). I was a founding member of the
Forest City Games Club in my home town, London, Ontario. There I was
introduced to the LBBs, and I came to admire the clever simplicity of the
Traveller system. In 1983 I bought the Traveller Book and briefly ran a
campaign influenced heavily by Frank Herbert\'s _Dune_ books. By 1985,
involved in comics, \'zines, film school, and singing in punk bands, I
dropped out of gaming entirely. Thus I missed out on MT (IMO, a decent
synthesis) and TNE (a grand and ludicrously conceived mistake). A
hard-science freak (though not a gearhead), I suspect I\'d have loved 2300AD
- - but unfortunately I\'ve never even seen the rule books.

Like a junky who thought he\'d kicked the jones, I\'ve been dragged back into
the Traveller habit by the release of T4. Since the summer I\'ve been
crafting an insanely elaborate non-Imperium milieu, including a new future
history, several original alien species, and ideas borrowed from dozens of
contemporary SF sources (particularly Bruce Sterling\'s Shaper/Mechanist
stories, David Brin\'s Uplift books, various Greg Bear books, John Varley\'s
Eight Worlds, and so on). I\'m also integrating lots of recent astronomical
data, such as the current view of the Galaxy\'s geography.

T4 has required some fine-tuning. It needed an armor table, so I wrote one.
I updated my old personal hit location table. I didn\'t like T4\'s task
system (too many dice!), so I came up with a 2D Task System that actually
seems to work okay. And I compiled a short summary of the personal combat
system. I\'m now fairly satisfied with things.

The major temptation with T4 is that, unlike during the CT era, I now have
a Mac, and can easily use up my free time crafting professional-looking
game materials - and with a bit of effort I can do stuff that puts IG to
shame. I am very glad to hear that IG is hiring a graphic designer for
future books. Everything produced thus far is just barely acceptable
(except for those inexplicably horrid deckplans in _Starships_, and the
illos in AA are pretty bad). These books are examples of DTP hubris: owning
Quark XPress does not make one a good book designer. The books are cleanly
laid out, at least, though dull-looking and poorly organized.

BTW: Someone suggested using Times instead of Helvetica for the body text.
That would be a slight improvement, but really both typefaces are just dead
boring. There are now many attractive and readable sans-serif fonts that
are designed for body text  - check out Syntax or Imago, for instance -,
and they\'re great for headings, too.

<Sigh>. I could rant for pages about what the bad layout and design
decisions in the T4 books, but I won\'t waste any more bandwidth. I just
hope Marc Miller and Co. find someone with a good eye for design, and a
knowledge of the state of the art. Fingers crossed.

Despite my general loathing of the trashing of a 20 year old intricate
backgroun(15 at the time,) I must admit the RC was a logical conclusion
of the Rebellion.  My big peeve was that it was so "American."

When my brother and I first started playing Traveller in 1982 or so, it
really bothered us that the Imperium was not a democracy and therefore
not "good."  I found that I liked it anyway, (and have since found that
democracy does not equal good either.)  To paraphrase Robert Heinlein,
the best reason for the Imperium\'s existence was because it worked.  For
over 1000 years.  It was in some ways an alien concept, and very
provocative.

The RC, on the other hand, was America\'s in your face attitude.  "We
will do what we want no matter what is in our way."  Very realistic for
the post Virus era-a tough time.  But it was not a bit alien like CT, or
even MT.  It was a bunch of tough guys on a mission with nicknames like
"Slider" or "Guns" -just like Shadowrun(which I like.)  But it wasn\'t
what I loved in Traveller.  

Did I like Lon Maggart?  Sure!  But I liked Strephon more....

Of course, that is my personal opinion-TNE isn\'t my setting, but it does
have a lot to offer.  That is why it should be encouraged along with all
Traveller-and supported.  The unique possibilities of the Imperial
future can draw bunches of folks to the game who might not be interested
in my setting.  

To put it succinctly, any player or Ref who wants to play or run is
welcome here no matter what they play-we\'ll discuss the fine points over
a good game, whenever it may be!

The World Tamers\' Handbook was a book about designing worlds and stellar
systems. It had extensive rules for colonizing worlds -- finding
minerals & local resorces, keeping populations fed, protected, and
supplied etc. Its raison d\'etre is to model the bending of a world to
the will of Reformation Coalition colonizers and "uplifters".

The World Builders Handbook is also about designing worlds and stellar
systems, but it concentrates on expanding the UWP to include more
detail, including societal customs, more graduations in Law and Tech
levels (Medical tech, comms tech, weapons tech levels and so forth),
resource availability, local fauna and climate.

Note: Since I\'m at work right now, the above descriptions are from
memory, standard disclaimers apply :-)

I\'m not aware of a new book coming out to fulfill the world design need,
but I would recommend DGP\'s World Builders Handbook over the WTH. The
World Tamers Handbook is the epitome of TNE\'s penchant for micromanaging
every little teensy detail, wheras DGP\'s WBH is IMHO more thoughtfully
laid out, with neat tables and useful equipment data sheets. It is the
epitome of DGP\'s thoughtful design and a wealth of background detail
instead of complexity in game mechanics.

Unless you\'re more interested in modeling the colonization of a world,
of course.

I\'m not sure how things may have changed since I left the fleet, but it
used to be that no previous experience was required to join the SEALs.  It
cannot be guaranteed at enlistment, but all enlistees in certain fields
can apply at boot camp.  You can also apply from the fleet.

The trick is first qualifying for the program, then surviving the training
(I\'ve heard numbers as high as 75%, but I know that over 50% wash out),
and finally getting through the probationary period.

<lots of ranting about missiles snipped>

	You seem to be asking a whole bunch of questions that run 
together.  I\'ll try to answer those questions that jumped out at me.  If 
I miss something, could you repeat it? 
	You made one comment about missiles doing miniscule damage.  They 
actually did lots of damage in Brilliant Lances, but the weird way Don 
Perrin chose to handle armor and penetration made them wimpy.  It used to 
be that they did damage in between a turret and a bay PAW but cut through 
armor like butter. (Det-laser missiles that is.)
	On the issue of MFDs, I agree that it would be nice if they were 
more scalable instead of coming in big 4-missile-guiding chunks.  Maybe 
we can do something about that.
	As for tracking missile swarms, the way FF&S handled EAPLAC (the
m-drive used in missiles) was a little weird.  It was described as a solid
fuel thruster but it could be turned off and on.  This is not how solid
fuel thrusters in the Real World work, and it would probably not upset
anybody too much if we made EAPLAC drives have to spend all of their fuel
in one turn.  Since EAPLAC missiles have a max delta-v of 25 g-turns, that
means they\'d be a medium range weapon only, which would change T4 combat
somewhat, but it would also mean that they would hit in the same turn they
were launched, so there wouldn\'t be so much book-keeping.  Gearheads could
still design missiles with lots of little EAPLAC thrusters that they used
one per turn or that were powered by heplar or t-plates and were in
effect itty-bitty ships, but they rest of you wouldn\'t have to be bothered
with that. :-)

	Actually, if we use Greg Porter\'s rules for robots and autopilots 
it wouldn\'t add that much to the cost of a missile to make it fire and 
forget.  Of course, first we need to try and figure out how to make his 
computer rules jive with SSDS/QSDS.

> Second -- and heretofore totally unaddressed anywhere I\'ve looked -- To
> Be Agile Or Not To Be Agile in T4? And if so, by what means? Thrust to
> weight? Thrust to displacement? And with what qualifiers?

	We had a long thread on this on the beta-list not too long ago.  
If you want to look it up in the archives you\'ll find it under "agility" 
and "slewing."  The upshot is that we defined agility as the ability of 
a ship to rotate and change its facing.  We defined it this way so as not 
to confuse it with thrust, and because rapid slewing raises the number of 
the spacecraft\'s possible future positions exponentially.  Translation:  
high slewing rate makes evasion g\'s much more effective.
	It was found that the upper limit on slewing speed was actually a 
ship\'s g-comp, because a few g\'s applied to a ship\'s rotation created 
such large centrifical force on the parts of the ship furthest from the 
axis of rotation that anyone there would be squished.  Since the "squish 
factor" goes up the larger the ship is and thus the further from the axis 
of rotation it is possible to be, large ships are less agile than small 
ships.  Since g-comp keeps people from being squished, ships with lower 
g-comp are less agile than ships with higher g-comp.
	How exactly this is going to be translated into a number is not 
known, but it will likely be a fairly straightforward factor depending on 
ship displacement, configuration, and g-comp.
	How agility is going to be used is also not known, but my 
suggestion to the beta-list the other day was that it affect the target 
number for an Evasion roll.
	How we are going to handle Greg Porter\'s stacking of g-comp units 
is also not known.  He was kind enough to give us a very big out though 
by saying that the effect totally broke down for large volumes (ie 
starships).

	Scalable complexity is precisely the goal Merrick (the chief 
combat system guy) has set out as one of his most important.  The detail 
he has now is about on the level of Battle Rider, though expansion to 
Brilliant Lances level and further simplification to High Guard level, is 
forthcoming, (all AFAIK, I haven\'t heard from Merrick recently).

> Why else are we figuring out in SSDS how HEAVY everything is?

	Mass is important when you are designing massively armored 
dreadnaughts.  For the sake of simplicity, QSDS and SSDS assume that 
all ships are about 10 tonnes/Td.  The old rule in FF&S was that if a 
ship was above 15 tonnes/Td, you had to recalculate the ships performance 
by mass.  A similar system will likely be used in NAH.  
	A compromise might be to have people put their ship in a 5
tonne/Td bracket so that a ship between 7.5 and 12.5 tonnes/Td counted as 
10, while ships between 12.5 and 17.5 counted as 15, etc.

well, here in the US we have any number of SpecWar units..  The Army has the
Airborne Rangers (elite recon troops), which you can join after finishing
Airborne School.  There are only three battalions of Rangers (about 2000 or
so troops), so competion is fierce.  We also have the Special Forces.  The
SF, or Green Berets are manned by NonCommissioned Officers (Sergeants and
up), who are experts in their own field, and are cross trained in several
other Military specialities.  Green Berets also speak multiple languages,
and their main mission is to win "hearts and minds" and act as
organizing/taining elements for irregular forces behind enenmy lines.

The US Navy has it\'s SEAL Teams, the decendants of WWII\'s Frogmen.  SEALs
are tasked with everything from clearing beaches for the Marines to boarding
hostile ships underway to acts of sabotage and terrorism in the enemies rear
area.  SEAL training (BUD/S) has the highest dropout rate in the US
military.. close to 70% of trainees quit the program.

The United States Marine Corps has its Marine Expeditionary Force (Special
Operations Capable).  Rather than being an elite within the Marine elite,
the MEU (SOC) is a standard MEU that has undergone additional training prior
to a deployment.  Tom Clancy has written an excellent book about MEU (SOC)
called Marine!.. check it out.

With the exception of the Green Berets, all these units accept any qualified
servicemember.  The Rangers and SEALs have the option of returning a poorly
performing soldier to his unit of origin.  (The Rangers call this "Leggin\'
down the road", since 2 of the 3 Ranger battalions are co-located with
non-Airborne Infantry units, and they tend to absorb rejects.)  Army SpecWar
units are treated as a regular tour of duty, lasting 18-24 months before
being transferred.  The logic being that keeping highly motivated, well
trained soldiers cycling into regular mech Infantry will cause a general
raising of military skills.

Green Berets and SEALs tend to stay put in SpecWar for the remainder of
their careers.

The commando school option for newly minted officers is meant to represent
something like the Ranger School or Special Forces Selection Program.  If
you want to say that your retired Sergeant Major spent his entire career as
a snake-eating Jump Pathfinder, feel free.

Slight correction:  Any 11B (Infantry) who has attended Airborne School can
serve in a Ranger Battalion, IF they survive Ranger In-Processing (RIP).
This is 48 hours of pure harassment while they do your backround check.
Ranger School is overrun with 2nd Lieutenants and Rangers from the batts.
It takes a lot of pleading to the First Sergeant to get permission to go and
wait on the bench just in case somebody is late reporting in.

 Any moron can get into airborne school, and many do.

oh, no doubt there will be times that combat will come down to corps a corps, but I still 
stand by the idea that nobody is going to develop high tech melee weapons. Better material, 
yes; greater utility (my broadsword doubles as a bottle opener and a shovel) but if melee

I keep thinking of that Murphy\'s Rules cartoon where it states that "a modern marine\'s 
sword drill consists of little more than a salute, but the marines of the far future are trained to 
use their\'s in combat" and there is a caption "not so clumsy or random as a blaster". The

Perhaps the facts, but the color, the prose and yes even the art shows no 
sign
of returning in T4 products.  Nor do t4 products, even the much praised 
CSC seem
to be as good as the stuff DGP turned out in it\'s hey day.

Yes, I\'ve seen that comment before, and by you the last time too.  
Forgive me my
optimism, but I can\'t help but hope that SOMEBODY other than CORE is 
capable
of writing a Traveller supplement the way DGP use to do it.  Just because 
the
old group is no longer at DGP doesn\'t mean that Roger couldn\'t produce a 
good
product.  But without an agreement with IG we\'ll never know will we?  I 
guess 
I do not understand why you continue to bash him everytime someone raises 
the
spectre of hope.  

I really want to see that CD product.  I\'m afraid the powers that be at 
IG aren\'t
going to let it get printed because it doesn\'t fit into their master 
plan.  
I fear we will never see the CD full of classic Traveller material Marc 
Miller 
was going to do for the same reason.  And I think only a lot of mail from 
all of
us is going to change their minds.  The only reason I can give you for my 
beliefs
is that no one involved with them is talking about those projects 
anymore.  

But without that massive amount of wonderful material, T4 is just an 
error-riddled
rule book and some overpriced supplements with bad art.  It may be more 
than that
someday, but not today.

I know people keep hoping but my read of the CD announcement on the web 
page is 
that they are looking at doing a CD version of T4.  That\'s all it really 
says.

1st A high yield Fusion Plant eats up X amount of fuel and sends the power
generated to(yes I forgot how to spell the name of the crystals some thing
like Zucchi zoobakini like that) power sinks.
????  Is all of the fuel used up in that frist use and stored in the sinks as
in
for example a 400 dt ship use 40dt of fuel like *snap* that?????

2nd A pulse is sent from the sinks to the Hull grid that warms it up setting
up
the jump field

3rd The main pulse is sent out of the crystals Spreading open the stuff that
separates the stuff between J-space and normal space
???? J-space is like n-space but shorter so what happen when you start up one
more  jump drive????

4th the ship enters jump for a week or so
???? The effects of J-space on folks(AKA they turn into flipen loons) is well
Bad If a person is in the 
"wall" he is fine but getting to close to it is just as Bad so what is the
effect of two Walls on each other????

Face it-it is damn hard to make a living off of being a game designer.

No prob. I\'ll take whatever help I can get. Publicly casting my bread on
the waters in the digest & Trav mailing list is a good way to do that.

Good. I hope you succeed. It\'s kind of confusing as is.

That\'s one of the concepts I\'ve been nursing along for some time now:
the cruise missile. Basically it\'s just a kamikaze small craft with a
robot pilot and a big whopping warhead, which was a kind of radical
concept in the old rules; but from what I dimly understand of FF&S and
all the gearhead jargon about G-ratings and so on, it seems like that\'s
all missiles ARE.

So another question rears up: how does one build a whopping big missile
that will be compatible with T4? I know there are lots of missile
designs floating around out there, but I plain don\'t understand how to
translate G-ratings and fuel-hours and things like that into T4 stats
(ranges, chances to hit or get shot down, etc.), although I can figure
the damage using the USP chart in the back of Starships=85.

Ahhhh=85 okay=85 so if I understand you correctly, you will not have to d=
o
anything special to build high-agility ships since G-comp seems to be
purely a function of tech level. Is that right? You just figure out how
agile it is using a single formula depending on how big and high-tech it
is, and what general shape the hull is, i.e. its distribution of mass?=20

That\'s fine. That\'s more than fine. What a relief.

Whatever works. Not an issue.

STACKING of comp units? See above. I\'m confused again. Do I have to wait
for an up-and-coming book to design proper warships that aren\'t crippled
pigs, or don\'t I?

If the whole idea gets trashed, it won\'t be the first time that a choice
bit of bullshittium =96 logical and \'realistic\' on its own -- gets
sacrificed on the altar of playability: witness the concept of surface
area for power plants. If we can do that sort of thing to preserve the
Traveller-esque spacegoing dreadnaught, then perhaps we can do it for
other, equally valid reasons=85. like, uh, like you know, like making sur=

the game is simple enough that average-smart teenagers will like, um,

Then why are we put to the trouble of figuring out the weight per.
individual component? I like to do things by the book and do them
correctly, but it\'s really a pain in the ass. (So is figuring the crew
requirements in SSDS. Adding up legions of dinky fractions so we can
multiply the \'raw numbers\' by this and divide it by that for each crew
type=85 ugh=85.) Can I, without violating anything too badly, just go wit=

the 10 tons weight per. 1 ton displ. rule?

Performance? In thrust or agility? If we\'re still talking about agility,
doesn\'t that mean that you go back to the evil days of having to
constantly juggle the power plant\'s own weight versus the thrust of=85 ah=
,
I\'m not gonna go into it again. Too many nightmares.

I have an alternate suggestion: how about generic default weights
figured by tons displacement, modified by armor value and tech level?
Preferably all arranged on a short little table where you can just look
it up and figure it out in ONE EASY STEP; okay, my ship displaces this
much and has this much armor and is made out of this kind of
bullshittium; so it weighs THIS much per. displacement ton.

But what about when you jettison drop tanks? Or launch subordinate
craft? Or take on a bunch of cargo (oh, gee, how HEAVY is it? If I\'m in
a Custom Trader that\'s half cargo hold, do I figure my agility
differently when a Vargr corsair jumps me if I\'m carrying a bunch of
nuclear waste instead of Styrofoam chips?) Or use up a bunch of jump
fuel? If you\'re going to be that detailed with regard to how much the
bloody ship weighs, and worry about centers of gravity and squish
factors and things like that, you have to take all those issues into
account. As you can see from the above examples, the weight of Traveller
starships fluctuate wildly in the course of normal game play, and not
just by a little.

Better to shitcan the whole thing and go back to an agiliy sytem that
revolves around displacement, IMO. It\'s easily explained and takes all
of the above into account without being anal-retentive. If you want
smaller ships to be more agile than bigger ships, then explain in a
sidebar the physics of it, just like you did so patiently and so well
with me, and have the ramifications of the physics in terms of game
mechanics be that big ships ARE simply less agile than little ones. You
can even use the existing USP values for Hull Size, then modify them by
configuration and, if you insist, armor value to determine agility. That
way heavily armored ships aren\'t as maneuverable, regardless of how fast
or what size they are. For Pete\'s sake, why not? Detail Without
Complexity, as per. the Monster Post.=20

Whatever mechanism you ultimately come up with, if you only have to
figure things out once, I can live with it. But I will NOT go back to
any kind of scheme for figuring agility where you have to constantly
juggle everything like they had in MegaTraveller. No Frigging Way. Never
Again. I know I\'m not alone in that.

post on Monday, and it wasn\'t as bad as I was expecting it to be. Here\'s a 
brief review of the articles:

Vestiges by David W. Baker. - Not a bad adventure at all. Basically just 
a bug hunt, but all the info, maps, and clues are well presented. The 
only problem I have is with the layout: a near half page is used at the end 
of the adventure text to display a symbol that featured in the adventure.

Warden of the Everlasting Flame by Peter Schweighofer. - Nice fiction - 
but it seems far too soft for Traveller\'s Hard SF setting.

Bits of Biotechnology by Aaron Link - Some nice gadgets to throw into an 
adventure to give it that \'far future\' feel.

Excerpts from Aliens Archive: The Asym. - I think this article should 
have been a page or so longer, giving more information on the Asym 
homeworld, it\'s history, and their technology.

The Silver Moon Incident by Lew Wright. - Not a bad adventure, but it has 
quite a few flaws. The adventure implies that there is an FTL radio 
system in Traveller. There is also a pretty silly set-up that forces the 
adventurers into a run-in with the Navy.

Imperium Games ads for Citizens of the Imperium and JTAS. Putting ads in 
a magazine and telling people to "Go ahead cut these out... Buy MORE 
books!" will not impress most people.

Free Trader Beowulf by Don Perrin. - Hmmmmm. More fiction, and another 
implication that there is an FTL radio in Traveller. The Navy ship in 
the story keeps sending off messages to Fleet Ops informing them of thier
actions on Border patrol, and a Space installation on the border communicates
by tight light beam to Sylea.

One Hundred Cargoes by Jo Grant. - Uselful for a trading game, a pitty 
it\'s lifted fully from 101 Cargos.

Writer\'s and Artist\'s Guidelines. - Could have fitted on one page easily.

Artwork. - I liked the interior art lots - Robert Daniels\' work was very 
Travelleresque. The cover art was pretty good too, but the styling of the 
cover and the magazine in general was poor. I felt that a lot more could 
have been squeezed into the mag, but it wasn\'t bad as a start. I\'d lose 
the fiction though and put in more adventures.

Scores out of 5:	Vestiges  	4.
		   	Warden 	        3.
		 	Biotech       4.5.
			Asym     	4.
			Silver Moon	4.
			Beowulf	        2.
			Cargos	      4.5.
			Art: Ashe	4.
			Art: Daniels    5.
			Art: Foss	5.
			Layout    	2.

To summarize, JTAS 25 is a step in the right direction, but Layout and 
Content need to be expanded upon. From the clashes with Traveller canon 
I\'d say a few of us on the TML would need to start writing for JTAS 26. 

One good thing though. I got my copy in Belfast on the morning of the 
13th, it having been posted on the 8th - not even a week in Jumpspace - 
impressive.

"Bypassing the lock is difficult (throw 10+; DM + mechanical skill)"

Chapter 4 of main rulebook:

Task attempts involve four separate elements:

Above task should therefore look something like:

Well, I have this picture of a group in M200 or later finding some ship

that the M0 players lost to a misjump, or life support failure or the

I don\'t know the FF&F system well enough to say for sure, but won\'t there
be a problem with the size of the antenna array? Isn\'t that why the high
sensor capabilities aren\'t available in QSDS for ships with 100 T hulls

I\'ll admit, I can\'t fathom how it would be done either, but
then again, I\'m not a Vargr :*) (well at least not the last

at least subsector plus sized govts which can last

Using the two World Wars and the Revolutionary and Napoelonic
Wars as examples. The major building programs took at least
a year to actually start. The US 2nd WW program is misleading
because the US navy had actually entered the war almost a full
year before the rest of the nation, and even that did not get into
full swing until mid 42. Any wartime building program is a major
administrative task which takes some time to organise, even
more so when you don\'t have instantinious communications.

Now I see the point your making, my apologies. Yes there is
something seriously wrong here. I actually suspect it\'s that
TCS and Striker give way to high GNP (in my campaigns I
slash them to 20%). Perhaps the missing figure is crew
costs. I know that TCS says they are factored in, but if they
weren\'t it would go a long way to rectifiing it.

Interesting example. The Danes actually did have it right
according to the theories of the day (if you look at the
tables I gave for the RN you\'ll see a similiar pattern, if
you allow for the Danes lack of overseas possestions).
Those ships were then safely stored behind the rather
\'formidable\' (by all orthodox standards) defences of
Copenhagen. What the Danes didn\'t count on was
that one: the British would attack a neutral without
any warning when the defences weren\'t fully manned;
and two: that Nelson wouldn\'t play by the rules and use
highly unorhodox tactics. When the RN came back and
tried it again in 1807, it took them rather longer and
they only succeeded because they Danes came out
and fought (with their hastily gathered crews).
Incidentally as a note before Dec 7 1941 the
universal term for a suprise attack on an
unsuspecting neutral navy was to "Copenhagen"
them :*)

True something is very wrong here.

So far so good, the jump drive effect looks kinda (I like to use imagery 
from popular movies, esp. for newbies.) when Doc Brown\'s Delorian smashes 
through the space time continuum.  Re-entry is the same effect.

Now when you operate another field within a current field, wierd things can 
happen.  This is the realm of GM\'s whim, as there is nothing that I know of 
currently published that deals with shuch a "Bonehead Manuever".  What 
happens to a person caught in a J-field?  again, lotsa weird things.  I 
remember an old Challange "Horror" edition adventure where the pc\'s get a 
haunted ship.  Basicaly someone got caught in a J-field some 80 years ago, 
and everytime thing goes into jump,  the "ghost" would appear.  They called 
it a HPPE or "Hippie":  Hyperspacial Paranormal Psionic Entity.  Basicaly 
your psioinc signature (aka soul) gets trapped between dimentions.  Hows 
that for an X-Files in the 57th (or 45th) century?

Here\'s my rule of thumb for funky things GM\'s can do with multi-drives, 
misjumps, etc...

1. You have nothing set up, and you don\'t want to fatutz with it, so, as 
Cmdr. Ivanova says, >*BOOM*<

2. Standard Misjump 1d6 for direction hex on map, 6d6 parsecs out.  2d6 days 
duration.

3. Major rift in space-time.  GM decides which sector, or even QUADRANT you 
end up in. Aka wormhole.

4. Temporal Displacement. Time travel forward or back, GM\'s whim

5. Traped in a alternate dimention, laws of physics slightly off kilter(i.e. 
magic exists). Or a alternate history (ala "Sliders") universe.

6. Temporal and Spacial Displacement.  Arive back at the big bang, encounter 
the 4th Imperium, witness the assaination of "Strephon", again....

These are merely suggestions, I dont think a single one is cannon anywhere, 
but when you gotta wing it...

The T4 team are going through a learning process. CORE is trying to help in
its own (small) way.

>>Roger\'s DGP now has its own \'vision\' of a RPG product.
>And what would that be, exactly?

A couple of years ago I was involved in designing the task system, skill
tables and combat rules for Macrocosm (with Beejay Johnson and others). This
was to be a generic RPG system with several product lines. One of these
lines was to be AI, the game that DGP was *going* to publish before it went
belly-up. There was also a far future starships type one, alternative Earth
histories, etc.

Unfortunately, pressures of work and Traveller commitments meant I left the
design team several years (IIRC) back. Since then, to my knowledge, Roger\'s
new DGP has been developing some of this stuff, but I have no idea what
stage it is now at. I can only suggest that you contact Roger (assuming he\'s
still at: rodge@cyberspace.com) to ask what\'s going on.

>Yes, I\'ve seen that comment before, and by you the last time too.  
>Forgive me my
>optimism, but I can\'t help but hope that SOMEBODY other than CORE is 
>capable
>of writing a Traveller supplement the way DGP use to do it.

As Tom Lane seems to have figured out, the problem that I\'m trying to point
out is that too many people are *hoping* that things like this will happen
when they\'re not going to. If anyone wants to make a difference to Traveller
then it\'s going to be up to *them* to do it. I didn\'t sit down at my
terminal 2-3 years ago and wait, hoping that someone would create a UK-based
internet group dedicated to Traveller, which would allow me to buy
second-hand stuff without the bother of buying from the US, which would run
Traveller events at RPG conventions to promote it and bring in new players;
which would send out (moderately) regular newsletters to e-mail and postal
members alike to keep them in touch with other players (to tell them what\'s
happening at IG, to give them product reviews, etc.), etc., etc.

I\'d probably still be sitting waiting if I hadn\'t done it myself.

Now I\'d be willing to bet that I have a lot less free time than many people
on this list. Just FYI:

* I\'m a project manager for Nortel Technology, the research arm of Nortel, a
major international telecommunications supplier (Norstar, Meridian,
Companion, etc.)

* I\'m currently undertaking a PhD in radar (related to one of the two
projects I\'m working on).

* I have a wife - no kids yet and thankfully she plays RPGs, but I still
have to make time for *us*.

* On average I play in RPGs 2 evenings a week.

* I created BITS, which is now approaching 200 members in the UK and
provides a lifeline to many people who thought Traveller was dying out.

* I created CORE, which publishes 3 licensed printed products for the new
Traveller (all of which seem to be the least-criticised products out so far
- - ok, they\'ve had a small readership and I really *am* open to *any*
criticism anyone would care to send me), plus software, plus writing the
Milieu 0 book, plus currently in the proposal stage of submitting new
products to IG...

* etc. (teaching karate lessons, watching Babylon 5, trying to play the
piano occasionally...)

Needless to say, BITS and CORE have required a SUBSTANTIAL investment of my
personal time and money. TLWH might be a much revered product but it will
never pay for the time David Burden and I spent working on it.

>...doesn\'t mean that Roger couldn\'t produce a good
>product.  But without an agreement with IG we\'ll never know will we?

There are plenty of outlets for proving whether one can write for Traveller
- - there are innumerable web sites on which people put their adventures; JTAS
is open to your submissions - no license needed there, you get public
recognition and payment; Traveller Chronicle still seems to be outputting
stuff (after all, thanks to Kevin Knight that\'s where I first started
getting my stuff in print); *small* scale fanzines are probably still going
to be permitted by IG (so Phil McGregor\'s safe for the moment); or you could
always submit a manuscript *concept* direct to IG or to CORE or to Goldrush
Games.

>I do not understand why you continue to bash him everytime someone raises 

I\'m not bashing Roger, just saying that the only way to fix the problem is
to write stuff oneself and try to get it printed, or go help run a
convention and make sure Traveller is played there and that it\'s *your*
tournament that they\'re running.

Ask Roger if he thinks I have a death wish for him! :-) Heck, he and I even
used to discuss how best to protect our (or was it just my?) thinning hair! ;-)

>I really want to see that CD product.  I\'m afraid the powers that be at 
>IG aren\'t going to let it get printed because it doesn\'t fit into their master

I would hope that\'s not true; IG are, to my knowledge, considering the
concept. *They* would be able to do the job. *DGP*, without full licensing
from IG, would not be able to reprint all the Classic Traveller material,
only their own MT stuff. Whereas IG *could*, by paraphrasing stuff, use the
DGP material without (I believe) Roger\'s consent. That would be pretty poor
form though and would prevent usage of all that excellent Blair Reynolds
artwork, etc.

>I fear we will never see the CD full of classic Traveller material...

I think these products *will* appear, but they have to be carefully
designed, created and marketed. As an analogy, when coordinating CORE, I
don\'t just ring up Courtney and say "Hey, we had a good idea the other
day..."; rather, we sent in a 10 page formal document with marketing reasons
for why we wanted to do specific products. The full proposal for each
product is several pages each...

TO SUMMARISE
============

CORE includes Joe Walsh and Stuart Dollar, so between me and them, I think
most thoughts put forward by the TML get heard by Courtney, and all of us
have a STRONG interest in continuing to develop our FAVOURITE RPG, so don\'t
despair, and please continue to chuck comments at the TML.

However, could I HUMBLY suggest that for something like this DGP thing you
say "I wish we could have back the same writers/artists" or "Have any of the
current DGP \'team\' written any Traveller stuff we can look at", etc. Saying
that you wish that the *current* DGP was back writing Traveller stuff, and
implying that this would automatically return Traveller to those halcyon
days can be very misleading to the newbies on the list.

of JTAS 25:

>One Hundred Cargoes by Jo Grant. - Uselful for a trading game, a pity 
>it\'s lifted fully from 101 Cargos.

Before anyone starts worrying about this, I thought I should explain. Jo
never gave permission for it to be printed in JTAS. He submitted it to IG in
the middle of last year as a concept for a separate supplement. IG never
responded to this idea, although at Euro GEN CON and OrkCon - both events at
which Jo and I were representing IG and BITS and met Ken Whitman in person -
Ken said he\'d like to put the 100 cargos into JTAS. Jo\'s comment each time
was "So send me a contract". No contract ever arrived. The 101 Cargos and
101 Plots books were published at the start of November for OrkCon in
Germany. It was only confirmed that the 100 cargos were in JTAS when I saw
the first reviews of JTAS 25 on the TML. Jo wasn\'t (and isn\'t) happy, but I
was talking to IG last night and obviously there was some confusion for
which they apologise and will be sorting things out ASAP.

Our 101 Cargos book contains *101* cargos (one bonus cargo - it has
something to do with a shipment of RPG books which are late...;-) ), plus
the cargo and plot generation tables and shipping hazard codes. These latter
constitute about 15 pages and the cargos about 15 pages. None of the other
stuff was written by Jo, nor has it been submitted anywhere near JTAS.

Although demand in the UK for the 101 books is high, we expect to see some
decline in sales but we have more important "fish to fry" with regard to new
CORE products for IG. It *does* act as a way of providing a further sample
of CORE material to a wider market. Hopefully Jo\'s very pleased at the very
positive mention that his cargos have received in every review I\'ve seen on
the TML.

Incidentally, I think the JTAS article says Jo submitted it via the
Internet, but he didn\'t - he posted it. And I don\'t know if it mentioned the
contribution that Lesley (his \'other half\') made.

Roger Howe <rghowe@ozemail.com.au> then says about JTAS25: Tasks in adventures:

>does the task system used in the JTAS25 adventures match
>the one provided in the main rule book?
>For example, page 5 right hand column, line 18-19 of JTAS25:
>"Bypassing the lock is difficult (throw 10+; DM + mechanical skill)"

This is called the "spot the hangover from a game written for a previous
version of Traveller" test. Unfortunately you score less brownie points (to
use against promotion rolls) if it is actually a "mental blockage by an
older Traveller player when writing a T4 adventure" event. Roll a 6+, or 7-
or Difficult or Routine task roll [choose your Traveller system] against a
common skill throughout all T4 systems (Cooking?) to determine which is
which. :-)

Hey, now wait a minute.  Just because Stu and I sharpened your pencils as

In a vacuum, pieces of metal which are touching one another (such as the
"petals" of an iris valve, or the edge of an airlock hatch and the frame
which surrounds it), tend to "weld" themselves together, because there is
no microscopically-thin film of gas molecules sandwiched between them,
keeping them apart.  I don\'t know how long this process ("vacuum welding") 
takes, but this really does happen.  Of course, this can make those
"salvage the drifting derelict vessel" scenarios more interesting, too...

Um..... yeah  Just like any moron can become a 2nd Lieutenant, and many
do...
Actually Airborne school (jump school) takes all kinds of MOS\'s (even
ROTC cadets who have no MOS yet)  One doesn\'t need the 11B MOS to go to
Benning and Jump 5 times..........

DGP Put out some of the best products around for Traveller, or any other
game.  The fact is, it was the writers, not the name of the company, that
made those good supplements.  Of course there is reason to be optimistic,
but nnot necessarily about DGP specifically.  The gmae is being actively
published, IG is, in fact, giving out licenses (Roger\'s CD being an
"exception" in that we do not know the whole story at this point, but
they *are* talking about *some* CD), and there are plenty of interesting
noises and products coming from the field of fan-writers (Like Jo and
Lesley Grant, to name two) with excellent ideas.

This is quite possible.  We have some influence over this course of
action, but the TML is kind of a Microscopic environment - because it is
so vocal it may be an overrepresented segment of the buying population.
It would not necessarily be wise to take what the TML says as the
consensus opinion of the whole. (not to mention that what the TML says can
sometimes be quite self-contradictory).

Ultimately, though, IG makes the decisions about what to license and what
not to, and what direction to develop and which to let lie.  They make
these decisions in an environment which we cannot fully know about, with
factors we are not aware of, and with limitations we do not have to worry
about.  Ranting about what IG isn\'t doing that would make you\'re personal
life pure ecstasy is not particularly useful.  Now writing that supplement
you wish the Risen-From-The Ashes DGP to write is quite a useful thing to
do.  You may find, however, that it is more difficult than you had
imagined.

[Mark Ayers]  Let us not confuse Ranger school with an assignment to one =
of the Ranger battalions. The Road to a tab for most enlisted folks =
begins with hard slogging in a battalion. The lowest e-grade in my =
Ranger class was a PFC that would get promotion to E-4 CPL upon return.

Ranger School is overrun with 2nd Lieutenants and Rangers from the =
batts.

[Mark Ayers]  Most all Rangers "from the batts" have orders to the =
school that a for a real slot in the class. OTOH, many officers leave =
their initial training with orders to the Ranger School but with no real =
slot waiting for them. I was one of them. After having served enlisted =
as a 11B and gone through ROTC and the Artillery Basic Course I went off =
to Benning with orders to the school. I stood on the parking lot until =
they had told us about five or ten times to go home the class was full. =
I think the first step in culling out those who might not make it among =
the officer ranks are those hours standing out on that lot.

 Any moron can get into airborne school, and many do.

[Mark Ayers]  True Doug. But then you have to been unbalanced to keep on =
doing it in a unit after you\'ve earned the illustrious title "5 Jump =
Chump."

    'body' => 'Some things I learned at the MIT Plasma Sciences & Fusion Center\'s tour
yestarday.

Tokamak (toroidal confinement; i.e. doughnut shaped) Fusion Reactors are
expected to be the shape which will finally produce a sustained fusion
reaction.

The inside chamber is lined (at TL8-9) with Molybdenum tiles (just like
the underside of the space shuttle) or, sometimes, Graphite tiles.

Temperature inside the reactor must reach 100 million degrees centirade to
trigger fusion.  Pressure is (only!) about 10 atmospheres.  

(this confuses me since the confinement chamber is stressed to such high
levels)

The "easiest" reaction uses Deuterium and Tritium in a 50-50 mix.
Deuterium is easily obtained, but Tritium must be made and has a 12 year
half life.  The "dream" of fusion is to make a reaction with only
deuterium, which is theoretically possible.

Fuel may be supplied either by "puffing" (deuterium) into the chamber in
the center, or by "firing" frozen deuterium pellets into the plasma from
the outside.

Plasma is simply matter which has had the electrons stripped away from the
nuclei of the atoms. This usually requires high temperatures (or generates
high temperatures) and subjects the matter involved to control by magnetic
forces.  Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) is the theory of how that matter will
behave when subjected to magnetic and electrical forces of various types.

In addition to three different magnetic polarizing fields, a tokamak also
sets up an electrical current within the plasma, such that the plasma acts
as a "secondary" for a transformer.  I think this is identical to the way
an electric motor works; the outer windings of coil have a current
supplied to them which sets up an induction to the windings around the
inner coil to cause the inner coil to rotate.  In the Tokamak, the plasma
acts as the inner coil.  So there is a "flow" of plasma (quite fast too)
going around the center of the tokamak.  you might say that there is a
current (in the river sense)  caused by a current (in the electrical
sense).

When fusing, Two type of particles are emitted; Alpha particles and
electrons.  The electrons will remain confined and circulate back into the
plasma (along with most of their energy) the alpha particles are what we
need to capture energy from.  Most current designs put a steam turbine in
circuit where the water is heated by the alpha particles to create
electricity.  The alphas are then recycled by passing through a lithium
"blanket" which is wrapped around the outside of the reactor (inside the
magnets).[I am unclear what the lithium does with the alphas at this
point]

The net energy of the power plant is released in the form of the kinetic
energy associated with the electrons and alphas.  This can be captured by
harnessing the heat in these particles, or by some other means.

To take a science fiction tack, it would be useful for the alphas to
somehow be converted directly to electricity, without a messy steam
turbine in the way.  Perhaps an "alpha absorbtion layer" which uses damper
technology to "resist" the alphas and convert their kinetic energy into
electriicity (negatively charged particles, in other words) [help me, I\'m
handwaving and can\'t get up!]

The plasma cross section is not perfectly circular.  Rather the circle is
elongated in the up-down direction and flatter on the inside of the
tokamak (towards the center) than on the outside.  The shape of the plasma
ring is a major theoretical area of study; future tokamaks are even a bit
more elongated than those running now.  A cross section of plasma as it
currently exists can be found on the PSFC Web Site.

Heating the plasma is accomplished in a number of ways.  The electrical
current that is set up by induction causes a geat deal of the initial
heating (20 million degrees C I think he said) .  To boost the temp up to
100 million requires the use of other methods; RF heating uses radio
frequency antennas ("at just below the frequency used by WGBH in Boston")
at about 80 Mhz to energize tha particles.  Some newer reactors use laser
or particle beams to energize the plasma, thereby heating it (CT method
is using lasers).

Divertor physics is another major field of exploration.  in the newest
reactors a "divertor" chamber is at the bottom of the torus all the way
around.  The magnetic field is shaped to "catch" all the escaped particles
(and therefore heat) and divert them into this chamber to be cooled
harmlessly, or receyled back.  The shape of the divertor field, and the
physical shape of the divertor is a matter of intense study.

Turbulence in the plasma is one of the major stopping points of the fusion
reactor.  Chaos theory arose, in part, to study this phenomenon.
Princeton has (I think) a good picture on their web site of turbulent
plasma (simulated by computer and colored).  

The speaker (my boss) equated making fusion to a balancing act, where
forces are kept carefully balanced and active feedback systems constantly
monitor the adjustments that need to be made many times per second.  An
unstable plasma will not only collapse, it will do so in a matter of 1-5
milliseconds, at which point you\'ll have a jug full of hot gasses.

Plasma does not emit light.  Pictures and films of the plasma showed only
the edge of the plasma where cooler gasses were escaping.  The plasma
itself is invisible.

some components of a Fusion Reactor;
Vacuum Chamber
Vacuum Pump
RF antennas
Pulse Flywheel (or fast discharge electric capacitor).
Molybdenum Tiles (or Lanthanum (according to CT) at higher TL, Graphite at
	lower).
High Power Electromagnets (several winding the chamber in different
	directions).
Deuterium (or just hydrogen) pellet injectors.
Numerous POwer Supplies
Large Electrical transformer
Special Diagnostic Probes, Sampling Probes (all made of Molybdenum or
	Lanthanum)
Lithium Blanket
Computers, Computers, and more computers 
Alpha particle absorbtion device (that makes electricity)
Cooling tubes, coolant recirculators (we use Liquid Nitrogen btw) Coolant
storage (Ignore this if you use Liquid Hydrogen as both fuel and coolant)
Neutron Radiation Shielding
Electric Transformers for storing, absorbing, and distributing electricity
Heavy lift equipment for disassembly and maintanence of the reactor
Numerous monitors, readouts, gauges, idiot lights, flashing operations
lights etc.

One thing that came to me is that a standard Fusion Reactor as installed
should probably be considered two or three reactors.  The reactor here
needs to be taken apart and reassembled on a regular basis; this could be
considered inconvenient (to say the least) if we depended on it for
propulsion, life support, etc.

Another issue is damage.  If the shape of the plasma varies by a very
small amount, it will collapse.  So any hit to the Power Plant on a
starship will shut down that power plant immediately.  If you have three
PPs that means you\'re available power is cut by 1/3, but if you have only
one...

I hope this proves useful to some of you out there.

This looks like a CT task to me.  I assume it means "throw a 10 or better
on 2 Six-sided dice, and add any mechanical skill to the roll"

As you point out this is not couched in the T4 task system format.

I was looking at the latest Silent Death release - Night Watch, I think
it\'s called - and noticed that the recent Traveller starship miniatures for
the Aslan ship, the Gunship, and several other non-GDW designs have been
"appropriated" and are now Silent Death miniatures.

The funny thing is, most of these ships were designed to be between
400-1,000 tons, and are now used to represent fighter-sized craft.

Mixed feelings about this. Well, no. Just sort of sucky feelings about this.

PS. Am I the only person who thinks Traveller could use a Full Thrust-like
starship combat system? Something more complax than Mayday, a bit easier
than Battle Rider, and more playable than both? The playability is really
the big thing. Something people would seek out because it\'s a good game,
not just because it\'s a Traveller game.

I\'d settle for just a deep understanding of engineering concepts.  Someone
who knows on a gut level that you don\'t stick massive objects out on
slender pylons without a damn good reason, that you don\'t put heavy
aerodynamically meaningless fins on a design without a damn good reason,
and so forth.

Right!  Direct proton-proton chain fusion. No neutrons at all to deal

Effectively there should be a definate break at about (TL12-13) not only
showing increased effectiveness of "gravitic confinement," but the

First off, you don\'t have to pump it out if you don\'t want it in there any
more...just open a few hatches, and stand back. :)  (This is presuming
that the ship *exterior* is in vacuum, of course.)

I can think of two reasons you\'d want an inert, low-pressure gas (probably
nitrogen -- cheap, nonreactive) in your ship during storage:

(1) Vacuum-welding prevention.  Metal surfaces in contact with one another
    in a vacuum tend to weld if they\'re not either moved now and then, or
    coated with a nonvolatile protective layer.  Having a little gas
    around prevents vacuum welding without expensive, labor-intensive
    treatment of individual components.

(2) Temperature control.  Particularly if the ship is stored in open space
    relatively near a star (say, inside the orbit of Mars in our own solar
    system), extremes of heat and cold may occur over the structure of
    the ship.  While the hull is probably quite capable of handling this,
    interior componenets probably aren\'t.  The cheapest and easiest way
    to maintain a reasonable temperature inside the ship is to flood it
    with gas, then use a few low-powered heaters and some thermostats
    to keep the gas in your desired temperature range.  Near a star, the
    gas will help conduct/convect heat away from the sunlit side; far
    from a star, it will keep everything from dropping to cryogenic
    temperatures, which aren\'t necessarily healthy for precision
    mechanical components, electronics, and the like.

There\'s some pretty cool information on this in a Challenge magazine from
way back..(at the beginning of MT(?)) but post 26.
I don\'t know which issue \'cos most of my challenges were destroyed in a flood.
                    :-(

However I\'d already photocopies some really useful items and kept them safe.

Project Farstar was one of them (must have been start of MT \'cos DGP (wow
what marvellous products they did!!-had to get that one in!) were
advertising TD11 - with the Geonee merchant captain Fornee, and another
mechant captain on the cover.)

Dated 1988

It gave you few ideas about what could happen and I think 3 adventure plots,
and a few witty Deus Ex Machina plots for things went really pear shaped!

Hope this is of som assistance.

This is a tradeoff.  At higher pressures, you can use lower temperatures.
The sun isn\'t as hot as some fusion reactors, but has much higher pressures,
for example.

The stresses on the confinement chamber are due to the magnetic fields.
You have, in essence, a large number of parallel wires with currents
running through them.  These wires are all pulling themselves together,
thus compressing your structure.  This creates high mechanical stresses
which your structure must be able to withstand.

This secondary current in the plasma is what heats it.  Much like current
in a wire will cause the wire to heat up, current in the plasma will cause
the plasma to heat up.  There are other methods (as you said), but most
of those cause disturbances in the plasma.

I don\'t recall, but I think that the Lithium absorbing the particles is

Easier yet, there\'s a reaction (I don\'t remember which, maybe D-D) which
generates almost exclusively electrons.  If you capture these, you have
electricity without any intervening steps.  If you pulse your reactor at
60Hz, you can hook it up to your power lines.  I guess you\'d have to
regulate voltage, but you\'d be able to eliminate a conversion step and up
your efficiency.

My understanding was that the plasma was basically stable, meaning that it
tends to remain in the torus.  All of our reactors now are very experimental.
I\'m sure that by the time that they are used routinely in space ships, they
will be much more stable.  An example of how experimental our reactors are:
As of a couple of years ago, no fusion reactor had achieved a self sustained
reaction (where no heating is required to keep the reaction going).

Again, in the far future, these reactors will probably be a lot more reliable
and go longer between refits.  Neutron absorption will always be a problem,
though, and reactors will probably have to be replaced as they become
contaminated.

Again, I doubt that Traveller fusion reactors will be this unreliable.

    'body' => 'That was a good summary of tokamak operations, Peter.  However, I feel
I must make one correction.  Forgive me if I\'m a little keen -- I\'m
taking a Plasma Physics and Fusion Energy course right now.

The main fusion products from D + T (Deuterium and Tritium) fusion
are not alphas and electrons, they are alphas and neutrons:
	D+ + T+ --> He4++ (3.52 MeV) + n (14.1 MeV)
The alpha (which is the He4++) is charged, so it is held in the
containment field.  Its 3.52 MeV of energy goes towards heating
the plasma.  It is the neutron, which is not charged, that escapes
and ends up in the lithium blanket.  It will create more tritium
for the reaction by:
	Li6 + n --> He4 + T
or	Li7 + n --> He4 + T + n

You can also fuse deuterium alone, if you don\'t have any tritium.
It requires more energy, but is certainly possible.  If CSC says
that fusion plants now burn D, then I guess this is what happens:
	6D+ --> 2H+ + 2n + 2He4++ + 43.2 MeV.

I would now like to offer my take on starship fusion plants.  It
is certainly cannon that they can scoop fuel from gas giants, and
that they can even run on unrefined fuel.  This pretty much precludes
them using deuterium, or at least not in a regular tokamak.  However,
nuclear dampers are also cannon Traveller technology.  They can be
used to alter the local values of the strong and weak nuclear forces.
Thus, it should be possible to increase the fusion crossection of
H + H (largely a weak interaction) or H + D (a strong interaction).
In my universe, this is how starships work.  And no, I have no clue
how Fusion+ works.

student in military/diplomatic history, and I\'ve been playing Traveller =
since, oh, about 1991 or so.  The first incarnation I used was MT, and I =
really loved TNE, but I\'ve been away from it for about 2 1/2 years until =
recently when I discovered T4. =20
	I think it\'s pretty cool...but I\'d be really excited to see a CD, =
because there is some stuff that I remember (I don\'t have any of my old =
books anymore) which is missing from the new rules set.  In particular, =
I would LOVE to get my hands on a copy of DGP\'s _World Builder\'s =
Handbook_, if anyone knows where it may be found.  Thanks!

The position could be for a communications/liaison/fire-control officer,
whose job it is to keep track of the ship\'s troops as they deploy, and relay
their situation and needs to the captain.

Um, Colin?  Can I ask a really important question?
Could you /please/ use periods to seperate your sentences next time you
post?  I would really appreciate it, and I\'m sure I\'m not alone.  As the
title says, this is just a request, not a flame.  Thanks in advance,

  WTH is a regurgitation of a similar product put out by DGP before it
collapsed.

  Essentially, it\'s a set of rules for exploring, developing, and living
on _real_ frontier worlds. A must have for any RC fan.

Already been done.  The item you\'re looking for is a Thermionic Diode.  It\'s
a lot like a solar cell, only it converts the energy from high energy particles 
into electricity.  The Russians have built them into their "Topaz" fission 
reactors.  No moving parts, so it _should_ have a long service life.  :)

There was a web site for the Plasmak, I\'ll have to find it though.  I\'m not

Interesting point, Tom. My thoughts were that if superdense material is
available, wouldn\'t this allow increasing the pressure far beyond 10
atmospheres thereby also allowing the required temperature to be
reduced? So which is easier and/or more cost effective to have, low
pressure or low temperature?

Per my wife, who\'s a mechanical engineer, vacuum welding can occur in
as little as 3-10 years. The majority of your 1000 year old ship would
be large masses of useless metal. :-(

Well, I used to be a physics major(long time ago.)  Temperature is the
average kinetic energy of an atom/molecule.  Pressure is the force of a
group of molecules distributed over an area.  They are the same
variable, ie increase temperature in a confined area and you have
increased pressure, and vice versa.

Folks have been talking about Tritium-Deuterium fusion and DD fusion,
but basically ignoring proton proton fusion because the only place
capable of creating the temperature/pressure necessary is the
sun-because of its huge gravity well.  

If you have a strong enough gravity well(big Traveller assumption,)
proton proton becomes available.  Probably at the TL when superdense is
introduced(I think 13,) because that is when industrial ultragravity has
to exist to produce the armour.

I guess the use of superdense would allow superhigh pressure generation,
but my gut feeling is that this is a roundabout way to produce
confinement.  Highgravitic would be the ultimate type of inertial
confinement, smashing monoatomic hydrogen together in a field implosion.
Add a strong nuclear damper with a point node enhancing the strong
nuclear force, and you get a massive, clean fusion plant.  No neutrons,
unless you burn deuterium or tritium.  

They can explode, too, if your grav field looses containment and is
fusion a lot of hydrogen at the time.  Again this is unimaginable to our
present tech, but call me again when we learn to control gravity(if
ever:(

If ship hulls are made of superdense, would they vacuum weld?  They are
collapsed down to their electon shells, and possibly chemically inert
because of that.  In lieu of that idea, would a superdense surface be
virtually frictionless-now there is an idea for a new Traveller melee
weapon.

I\'ll bet superdense really wouldn\'t stay superdense without a strong
field present.

Teflon will resolve this issue quite nicely. The main depracatory force on a
space ship will be long term radiation damage and impacts from hi-v objects.
It will be swiss-cheese long before an eon passes.

I would like to make a suggestion to anyone interested in these issues if I
may. I do high-performance and experimental rocketry as well as robotics and
if you would like to get a better idea of what is going on in space and
materials sciences it would be worth your while to spend $12/yr. on NASA Tech
Briefs. You might also want to make regular trips to Survival Research Labs
(www.srl.org), The Robot Group (www.robotgroup.org), Society of Amateur
Scientist (www.thesphere.com/SAS/), Pacific Coast Rocketry
(www.asesur.com/prs/), Experimental Spacecraft Society (www.wallis.com/ess/),
and NOAA NIC (nic.noaa.gov). Also the National Academy Press is now online
with a wide selection of books available real-time (www.nap.com).

Both Pacific Coast Rocketry and Experimental Spacecraft Society are working
to be the first groups to have amateur rockets w/ payloads (I am working on
a spun-mirror telescope indipendantly of both groups) placed into orbit
($100,000 reward). Both of these groups allow anyone to join (there is a fee)
and participate. PCR is by far the most advanced group in the US if not the
world.

Hope some of this helps.

Ship Weaponry In the Terran Republic

   Traditionally, warships and other armed vessels within the Imperium
and the Solomani Confederation mounted one secondary weapon (turret,
barbette) per 100 tons displacement, and one primary weapon (bay, spinal
mount) per 1000 tons displacement.  The 1:100/1:1000 ratio was
maintained because the Imperial and Solomani navies had substantial ship
construction facilities and high quality starports at their disposal,
making hulls both cheap and plentiful.  So cheap and plentiful in fact,
weapons were considered by many to be the biggest cost driver in warship
construction.  There also existed a school of thought amongst Imperial
and Solomani naval architects which believed that spreading the weaponry
of a given fleet out amongst as many ship hulls as possible meant that
it took more damage to reduce the combat effectiveness of that fleet.=20
Thus, fleets were large, and worked generally en mass (battleships and
cruisers almost always worked in squadrons unless they were on flag
waving detail).

   In the post-Collapse era, however, meeting engagements on the
frontier consisting of individual one-on-one combat or small task forces
with no more than three capital vessels are the norm.  Being able to
quickly overwhelm an opponent (or better yet catch them by surprise) is
critical.  Fleets try to take as little damage as possible, because
starports are fewer and farther between, and of much less average
quality than during the Imperial era.  This tends to encourage designers
to install better sensors, increase weapon effectiveness, and create
redundancy (or increase it) when possible in important systems, such as
master fire directors and communications equipment.

   Early on in the Terran Republic, there were critical shortages of
military spaceship hulls, particularly starships.  These shortages were
caused by a number of factors, primarily a lack of proper Naval ship
yards (many are still being reconstructed), an emphasis in commercial
yards on the construction merchant vessels (which at the time were more
lucrative to build), and budgetary considerations, particularly during
the Dasovich administration.  The result was that the Navy=92s architects
had to figure out a method of significantly increasing the combat
effectiveness of the fleets of the growing Republic, while at the same
time making do with only a slow growth in the total number of combatant
hulls. =20

   Their answer can be summed up in one word: firepower.  Terran
Republic warships have a secondary weapon and defensive armaments to
displacement ratio of 3:100 (3 turrets or barbettes per 100 tons
displacement), and also have significantly more weapons bays than their
Imperial or Solomani counterparts.  Even armed civilian craft have a
ratio of turrets/barbettes to displacement of around 2:100, which would
technically qualify them as warships in many regions of space.

   Increasing the amounts of weapons on each ship hull is not without
drawbacks=97more weapons in general means more gunners and thus larger
crews (crews already larger than in previous times because of=20
reductions in shipboard automation), creating even more cramped
conditions for personnel.  In Imperial times, it was not unusual for a
typical petty officer to have their own small stateroom.  In the
post-Collapse era, such accommodations would be considered luxurious, as
small staterooms are routinely shared, and many lower ranking crew
members on larger warships sleep on bunks.  Terran Republic naval
designers have avoided much of the problem by relying on master fire
directors to control secondary weaponry instead of having crews
routinely man every turret or barbette.  While this means that ship=92s
compliment on a Terran Republic naval vessel crews is smaller than it
would otherwise have to be, the reliance on master fire directors means
that if for some reason a MFD goes down without a backup, there are not
enough free crew on board to control all the guns and fire them
individually.  The Terrans have learned to compensate for this partially
by giving all Naval Security personnel at least some rudimentary
training in ship=92s gunnery.  While they are generally poor substitutes
for full time gunners, they can keep a large percentage of a ship=92s
weaponry functional until the MFD can be repaired, or the ship can
escape.

   When designing vessels for the Terran Republic Navy or Terran
Republic civilian craft, take into account the additional weapons their
ships routinely carry.

May I humbly discourage GMs from using effects like these. Take it from my
personal experience that any rulings which result in repeatable
time/reality alterations will quickly overwhelm the game to such an extent
is will no longer be recognisable. I\'m not saying it would be a bad game,
depending on the referee, but it will no longer be a Traveller game. There
have been a few games (like Time Lords and GURPS Time Travel) which have
rules to deal with these situations, but Traveller does not, nor is time
travel part of the Third Imperial canon.

When you "wing it" I suggest to keep a few principles in mind:

1. The players are not the only beings in the universe. Anything the
players do will probably have been done thousands of times by thousands of
other people in history. There must be a reason any strange effect is not
well-known and used (it could be lethal, ineffective, or has side effects
the standard methods do not have).

2. The players typically have far less resources than other parties like
the Imperium, megacorporations, or military forces. If new effects require
large amounts of cash, equipment, study, or effort then large forces like
the Imperium will have the benefit of these effects far more than players.

3. Most players are extremely capable in using previous rulings to their
advantage in new circumstances. Hasty GMs can quickly find their campaign
\'unravelling\' because of some spur-of-the-moment ruling.

4. I find it unnecessary to resort to "alternate dimensions" or laws of
physics to get unusual environments or encounters. The Third Imperium is a
large and varied place, there is plenty of room in it for alternate
histories or new rules. For example; a backwater TL 6 world where a fascist
state conquered the other democratic nations and was able to implement its
xenophobic racial plans. A TL 3 planet with a dangerous reptilian carnivore
and an underground trade in high-tech equipment. The carnivore is able to
fly through a combination of psionics and methane production, and can expel
burning gouts of methane through its mouth. The high-tech equipment is
controlled by a secret society of scholars which portray its effects as
supernatural.

While the hull may be of a superdense material, the fittings would not be. 
Hatches, valves and the like would be of normal materials.  Can you imagine
trying to open a superdense hatch, especially a floor/ceiling type?

Some of the CORE members have been working on a ship combat system which
involves more role-playing, i.e. better player interaction, without the
complexity of something like Battle Rider. I believe there are several such
projects (on GDW-Beta?) to get combat at various levels of complexity. Which
(if any) are finally brought out as products by IG is as yet to be decided.
If they don\'t get official recognition, I should imagine they\'ll appear on a
web site anyway or perhaps BITS will be able to publish them.

power generation: try the MHD turbine.
current ideas are to tap off a streamer from the plasma, and throw it into a MHD generator. pity it uses plasma rather than just the alphas.

lanthanum: unlikely... the plasma is hot, so radiates in the UV and higher. and the power radiated out of the plasma goes up as the square of the atomic number. current systems cannot cope with carbon or oxygen contaminants. lanthanum would be at least 100 time worse, at Tl 9-?. Only use if it\'s part of a gravitry confinement.
carbon is used. Beryllium is even better from that view point, but is toxic.

low temperature would be best. thermodynamics mode on, stuff radiates as T^4 I think. so dropping down to a stellar temperature means you can drop the heating requirement by 10^-4.
On the other hand structural failure could be bad.


hatches of superdense : the advantage of SD is their strength goes up in comparison to both volume and density. surely it would weigh less than a normal hatch, and look like a rigid sheet of cooking foil? any edge of it could cut easily, not good for anybody in a spacesuit. try it as a sword insted ;-))

        Forgive me, Andy, but you have to recognize that things were *a bit*
easier for you than for other european people. The difference of languages
keeps the number of traveller afficionados out of the British Islands quite
low. In my country, I doubt there are more than one dozen of CT/MT/TNE refs
(and, to my knowledge, I am the only one with T4). I know the situation is
not spectacularly better at Germany. Austria is almost a Traveller-free
zone. And so on.
        In fact, I would like to ask you a question. Is BITS open to non-UK
people? And, can CORE distribute CT/MT/T4 products in Europe? ;-)

>I\'d probably still be sitting waiting if I hadn\'t done it myself.

        Point taken. You are totally right. In fact, I loved the old DGP\'s
stuff, and after I finally accepted that those products were not going to
continue (sniffff), I decided to do something about it, on a purely personal
level. I am writing an Alien Module (The Geonee) to my personal use that
probably I will non-commercially distribute in one way or another. An
advance (that timeline) is already on the net. As soon as I manage to obtain
a bit of time, more parts will be put to the consideration of the TML.

        Well, I must admit I am impressed. You have a couple more
occupations than me, and still time to be Traveller-active? Please, tell me
the secret ;-)

        Money is the problem :-(. I cannot speak for anybody else, but I
doubt that many people can afford the initial investment needed for creating
a company. I considered the idea some time ago, but the first thing we will
need would be the rights for a translation of Traveller products, starting
with MT (oops, now it would be T4). If I am completely mistaken about the
amount of such an investment, please correct me.

        I agree with you completely, but I do not think old DGP-fans want
new DGP-style products to have the letters D.G.P. stamped on them. I think
that there is just a claim stating "hey, that was the BEST style I ever saw
in a Traveller product". I also agree with this, and I my HUMBLE suggestion
is that all writers, commercial or not, should take this little bit of info
into account. That does not mean to imitate, just to consider those old
products as a benchmark. Thats what I am doing with the Geonee... I would
submit it to YOU when I finish it! ;-)

Yes, thank you Richard for pointing that out.  You snipped the first 2 
suggestions tho, and the list is in order of rarity.  Boom first, then 
Standard Misjump, then Major Misjump.  Altering Space-Time is suggested if 
you have a seroius campain idea for your group and is reccomened for 
experienced GM\'s and Players alike.

>When you "wing it" I suggest to keep a few principles in mind:

Agreed, most of the major suggestions (4-6) are for those adventures where 
the PC\'s are not the owners/users of the tech, rather their patron, a wacky 
scientist or cunning CEO wants the PC\'s to "test" it (heh, heh...)

>3. Most players are extremely capable in using previous rulings to their
>advantage in new circumstances. Hasty GMs can quickly find their campaign
>\'unravelling\' because of some spur-of-the-moment ruling.

Agreed, PC\'s do take advantage of the GM\'s rulings, this is why the GM\'s 
must rule this as a random effect that no one can predict.  And Ultimately, 
It is the GM\'s decision.  Another reason I suggest this for experienced GM\'s 
AND Players.

Actualy, I did something like this at a con a while back.  The PC"s 
crashlanded on a world ruled by "Wizard-Kinges"  One patron on this world 
requested the PC\'s retrieve a "Fire Staff" from a rival "wizard".  Wizards 
were hi-lev psions and the firestaff was a FGMP-21. So Clarke\'s law does 
apply.

I think the Alternate Dimention thing is one of the toughest things to 
create for any Sci-Fi game, it would have to be very very VERY rare for PC\'s 
to crack into one.  Imagine a universe where Light doest travel in a 
straight line, gravity is fatutzed, or Grandfather forbid, an antimater 
universe!
(Use only if you REALY hate your PC\'s!)

Again Thanks to Richard Hough, for pointing out these facts.  I hope this 
has helped to clairify(or confuse further) what one can do, and must 
concider, when messing around with J-drives.

Moral of this story:  "If they stupid blow they up, if they smart (or 
lucky), Misjump \'em!"

I multiply it by their rank number, i.e. pay grade.  O5= gets 5x, etc.  It can
add up to a lot of cash, but somehow I don\'t see the Imperium being too stingy

The 100 diameter safe jump distance seem to be a gross approximation. A
gravity well depends on the mass of a body, and the mass depends on the size
and the density of this body. Assuming that all usual bodies have the same
average density (around 1g/cm3 for most of stars and gas giant and around 5
for rocky planets), the radius is the only changing parameter (Yes, this is
very gross approximation).

White dwarfs have the mass of the sun for a radius of 1/70 Rsun (again this
is an approximation). The density of this rocky stars is around 300Kg/cm3.
The range factor is not the same as above. 

So IMO, the 100 diameter Safe jump should be multiblied by a density factor
just to get \'dead stars flavor\'. I suggest this factor could be around 100,000. 

Because, this is not the precise value which is important, but the white
dwarf star different factor density, this factor could be lowerd for
convienience.


What about that?

It seems that Khankari is a system in the Vland sector, a copy

THis gives me an idea for IG - they should allow people to buy systems
and have them named after them! I wonder if First Survey have gone to

what should be the effects on the planetarty system? BTW, can a novae occure

I was reading the November issue of the Astronomical Journal the other
day and came across some info that might be interesting to some people.
The article was by Luu & Jewitt and they estimate that there are
35,000 kuiper belt objects with a radius greather than 50km.
These objects are at distances from the sun ranging from 30-50AU, with
a 10AU spread in height.  They also say they have a newer estimate
which doubles the number, but also doubles the volume that they are 
spread over.  The do not say if the extra volume comes from more height
or a farther radial distribution.

Another thing they talk about is destruction of kuiper objects.  They
refere to Kawakami et al 1983 J. Geophy. Res. Vol 88 pg 5806
Kawakami et al preformed lab experiments which show that it requires
50Joules/ kg to completly destroy an icy body.  \\
They do not say if this is turning the Kuiper object into a gas or
just disrupting it enough so that it doesn\'t reform, but I would
assume the later.

Just thought this might be useful to the Asteroid hull question and
the refueling in the Kuiper Belt debate.

Yes, that\'s very true. My posting was rather generic so please forgive me
not considering such specifics.

European yes. The CORE web page (http://members.nova.org/~sol/core) gives
some pricing details; post costs will look high because they\'re based on
overseas air mail; please determine what you\'d like to order then e-mail me
and I\'ll work out if the postage costs should be less.

I work to live, not vice-versa, I made sure my PhD was on stuff that I\'d be
paid to work on until near the end of the PhD and I don\'t bother spending
much time on preparation for the RPGs! I\'m sure none of my players have
noticed apart from the other referee in the group who always sarcastically
asks me at the start of each game if I\'ve actually decided yet which
scenario I\'m going to run (whether it\'s Traveller or AD&D).

Starting the company isn\'t costly. The main cost was producing TLWH, since
with a print run of only 200 (are these going to become collectable or
what?!) and my fixed desire for a colour cover, the production costs were
plain silly. That\'s why it\'s only available mail order from BITS because the
distributors and retailers wouldn\'t get more than a few percent of the cover
price! :-)

If you don\'t have some spare cash that you\'re willing to throw at a project
like this (face it, I only did it because I always wanted to and I knew I\'d
always regret it if I didn\'t at least TRY), then I\'d advocate simply writing
stuff and submitting it (JTAS, CORE, IG, whoever); that\'s still a good way
of supporting Traveller and if you start getting paid and your name gets
known then you might be able to make a go of a company.

>need would be the rights for a translation of Traveller products, starting

Rights are a sticky business. I think I can honestly say that if my gamble
on the TLWH had been a flop, IG wouldn\'t have taken us particularly
seriously so we wouldn\'t now be talking to IG about writing some of their
products for them. I saw the market niche (i.e. that one would need an
introductory Milieu 0 adventure to go with the release of the rulebook) but
overall I think we *were* just lucky to do as well as we have.

I would be the first to admit that the general principles of TLWH are based
on the DGP adventures. I think that has been a major influence on its
successfulness. I\'ve used similar nugget-based principles for all the
adventures I\'ve submitted to the Traveller Chronicle and Signal-GK. David
Burden (who originated the majority of TLWH\'s adventure sections) also
prefers that style so it made it easier for us. A general comment on that
style is that it allows you to divide the adventure up into lots of sections
which not only makes it easier to run but also to write. A bit like modular
software, really! Since I\'m primarily a software person, I like the approach!

The 101 books are a different approach, consisting mainly of the innovative
plot ideas that Jo and Lesley Grant have thought out. On average, it takes
me a lot longer to edit and lay out the 101 books than it does for Jo and
Lesley to produce all those plot ideas! Between us, and the other writers
who have since joined CORE, we have a wide variety of writing talents which
will hopefully continue to provide you with quality Traveller products.

However, I\'m already dreading the first TML reviews of Milieu 0... I\'d
better start lining up the excuses... er, IG only gave us 3 weeks to do it,
er, so we needed 7 people on it, er, Jo Grant and I were away in the middle
running the OrkCon stand for IG (ok, so Jo had written his 20-odd pages
about 15 seconds after we were given the job!)... er, the other writers only
joined when we got the job, we never had a fixed contract, we only had vague
guidelines, one of us disappeared, another stepped in at the last minute,

This has become a GM/player call during character generation.  If you want
your Gunnery sergeant to be the Third Imperium\'s answer to a Ranger, spend
the majority of his skill rolls on the Educational and Career skill tables.
If you want Sgt Bilko, use the Social and Mental tables, etc.

This is my preferred method of skill generation, since it allows the player
to direct the direction of his training while still keeping a random element.

I beleieve that the Commando School option for Army Officers is supposed to
be a training tour with the Marines!  The young officer learns a bit about
the Imperial forces and picks up some useful skills and contacts.  This bit
is specific to my campaign, where the "Army" is actually each world\'s
defence force, of which 10% is avalible to the Imperium at any point.

Actually, Jeff, the term is (now) signaller...
It changed in 1992 ish..
BTW me too. I was a signalman in 1992, 
got to dizzy heights of lancejack before fumbling my promotion roll! and ending
up as a signaller!!!

It does take brains to be a Para, btw, there\'s a big pile of them just

Thanks, Andy, you\'re a real pal. =)

Perhaps some folks would be interested in a more serious look at what 
happened.

\'Way back when T4 was just a twinkle in someone\'s eye, Andy Lilly and I 
each got in touch with Ken Whitman (separately) about getting some sort 
of licensing agreement so we could each (separately) produce and sell 
Traveller products.  We were promised this many times, but as the months 
went by we never did receive it.

Along about August or so, Jo Grant got in touch with me, because I\'d said 
something about wanting to produce Traveller products, in one of my posts 
to TML.  Jo said that he had plans to do the same, and that he\'d hooked 
up with Andy Lilly.  So, I joined up with a group that already included 
David Burden, Andy Lilly, and Jo Grant.  

We made some modest plans for what to do in the future.  With no 
licensing agreement, perhaps we would try Gold Rush Games or Sword of the 
Knight.

Then along came Ken Whitman with a project for us: Write the M0 
manuscript (using the outline posted to TML by MWM) in three weeks.  Of 
course, we jumped at the chance. =)

But it meant bringing on some more people, especially since Jo and Andy 
would be out of touch for most of that 3 weeks.  So, at Ken\'s 
suggestion, we asked Dave Golden to join us.  I brought in Michael Barry, 
because he had asked me a few weeks previously to include him in any 
writing projects that may come up, if possible.  Andy brought in David 
Elrick.  We divvied up the M0 outline, and set to work.

Two days before the deadline, we heard from Dave Golden. He hadn\'t done 
any work, and he wouldn\'t be doing any.  "Huh?"  Yeah, that\'s not the 
sort of person Dave is - he would never wait until the last minute.  We 
were doing all this over the Internet, remember.  Dave had sent a message 
about being unable to join the project a couple days after we 
started...only it never got to Andy, and it never bounced either.  So, 
Dave figured we knew all along that he wouldn\'t be part of the 
project...but we didn\'t.  Suddenly, we needed 1/7 of the work done in 2 
days! 

Enter Stu Dollar.  I begged and pleaded with him to help us out, and he 
was gracious enough to do so (his wife Suz had been editing my own 
efforts right along, so I asked her to wheedle him a little, too; he\'s a 
reluctant sort when it comes to writing RPG material (not!<G>)).  In 2 
days, he did the job, and his wife edited it.  So...

...We got it done on time, and it looks like a damned fine manuscript to 
me (but then, I\'m a little biased<G>).  We sent it off to AP&D, for Les 
Smith to edit.  I hope Les didn\'t change much, if anything; I truly 
believe the original manuscript is great (tho there are some punctuation 
problems and whatnot, given that we didn\'t have enough time to get rid of 
the last dozen or so grammar errors).  

Hopefully, you\'ll all like the book.  But, if not, please remember the 
time constraint we were under! :)

OK, so they\'re not.  Let\'s give Roger and his crew a chance before we 
write them off.

If DGP get\'s their Traveller license renewed, I think that we have 
every reason in the world to expect new Traveller product from them.

And, just because it is not the same people as the old DGP does not 
mean that the DGP products won\'t be any good.  We have nothing to 
look at  this time to make that evaluation.

I say, let\'s get behind Roger in the hopes that he can turn out the 
fantastic Traveller products that DGP has turned out in the past.

Besides, a fourth company productin Traveller items can be nothing 
but good for the game.  The more T4 stuff produced, the more exposure 
the game gets.

And I\'m all for that.

Neutrino sensors consist of humongously large pools of water or cleaning
fluid usualy underground to shielf from other particle interactions.
Neutrinos are exceedingly hard to interact with, they just go zipping
right through normal matter. Consider a photon in the interior of the
sun can take in excess .25M years to reach the surface (drunkards walk)
while a neutrino does it at c (in vacuo).

Neutrino \'cascades\' are accepted by astronomers as a good way to search
for nova and similar hi-energy extra-terrestrial events.

Neutrinos don\'t interact because of their lack of electrical charge(like

Down on the Ice at McMurdo, the Cosmic Ray Annex houses "cosmic ray
sensors" of some sort. I don\'t recall the exact particles being
studied, but something in the back of my mind wants to say
"neutrinos".

Sensor data is printed out by a paper tape puncher! Ever see what a
million bits really looks like?

The cosmic ray sensors are encased in blocks of concrete. I also 
recall that "recording" cosmic rays is difficult because they are few 
and far between.

I can check my sources when my contacts are back on the Ice for the 
winter.

I agree!
The problem is sorting the relevant trace particles( of an emnemy ships
reactor) from ambient background neutrinos.  I think that will be
resolves if the basic technology exists.  See my other post on fusion,
PPchain.  This stuff about neutrino sensors being useless is INCREDIBLY

Yeah, that\'s the ticket-and one not addressed very well in FFS.

These technloogies are really far beyond us tecnically, but not
unimaginable.

Could superdense be kept in form without intense grav fields?  Could a
man breath in a car going over the ludicrous speed of 20mph?  I\'m not
certain, but I\'ll bet 3000 years from now our ancestors might know
better.  Or somebody elses ancestors...

With lower tech materials, that was certainly true, and played utter
havoc with early attempts to maintain mothball fleets. Fortunately,
crystaliron displays a magnificent resistance to vacc-welding, as do
coherent superdense and all more advanced material technologies
discovered thus far.

Ship\'s systems and sub-systems are now modular in nature, and filled
with just such an inert gas as you describe to ward off the inimical
effects of long-term storage in space. With modern stellar technology,
one may simply fling open the airlocks, place a (solar-battery powered)
electrostatic field over the doorways, cargo bay doors, and weapons
ports to keep out micro-particulate matter, and viola! One may safely
store a modern vessel for up to centuries, if need be; or recover
combat-disabled vessels after decades or -- in some extreme cases --
centuries in deep space.

Now in some cases, it is true that the funtionality of minor systems may
be degraded IF a ship is stored amateurishly or abandoned in great
haste. If unrefined jump fuel is carried (either hydrogen or water),
then a major cleaning job may be necessary; for there are bacteria
proven to survive in either substance who will set up thriving colonies.
If the seals on the fuel tank slowly give way, and there is even a
micro-atmosphere left within the hull, the entire interior of the ship
may resemble something left for far too long in the back of someone\'s
refrigerator. Bacteria and microorganisms from the bodies of the
perished crew may do the same.

(In one case, a relic ship was found -- a science and exploration vessel
of some sort, apparently -- where just such a state of affairs
prevailed. Even after the ship was exposed to vacuum in an attempt to
kill off the miniature ecology that had set up shop within the hull,
some of the more inimical life forms (descendants of those who had
escaped from the lab) crawled into the IG-sealed subcomponenents and
went into hibernation until the ship was brought into drydock, then ran
merrily amuck through  the shipyard. Nobody was killed, but production
was brought to a complete halt for over twelve hours, sixteen techs were
hospitalized with various injuries, and two companies of Aerospace
Infantry were required to pacify the little brutes. All in all, a very
crude affair).

Batteries may corrode. Dust may infiltrate the life support system. The
interior of the jump fuel tank may resemble a child\'s science
experiment. The hazards of improper long-term storage of aerospace craft
are many, but I hasten to reassure you that vacuum welding is no longer
one of them.

OK. So, Don wrote Starships. Tim Brown wrote Aliens. Greg Porter did
CSC. SSDS & QSDS were done by GDW-Beta members/TML members (exact names
escape me, close enough). SSDS, QSDS & VDS are all based on FF&S,
done by GDW staff who have moved on to greener pastures. Now it seems
that TML gadflies have written Milieu Zero as well. No doubt 
Stephen King did First Survey, just to boost sales with name recognition.

Without meaning to be too negative, exactly what has Marc Miller
done except give people permission to use his copyrights for material
that he came up with 10-20 years ago and hasn\'t touched since? Now, to
be fair, I assume he\'s doing a lot of project management and working 
on coming up with continued financing to do new stuff, but as far
as actual product development work goes, um, he doesn\'t seem to have
done much.

I mention this mostly because the whole idea with Traveller is that 
it\'s supposed to be being driven by ONE vision, Marc\'s vision. It
seems like Marc had a peripheral role in MT (though in all honesty 
I can\'t say I have any idea), no role in TNE and a rather distant
role with T4. Can Traveller\'s "vision" be maintained in this manner?
Or does it matter? 

Hoping this doesn\'t hurt my chances of getting a JTAS article accepted,
Ethan

I\'m sure Marc can answer this better than I can, but I\'ll give it a shot 
anyway. :)   First, Marc\'s "The Traveller Book" forms the basis of the T4 
rulebook.  Second, Marc oversaw the process of updating TTB to become 
T4.  Third, Marc has reviewed and approved every manuscript thus far.  
Fourth, Marc wrote the outline for the product that became M0.  Fifth, 
Marc was obviously involved with First Survey, since he was posting 
sector data and asking for input a while back (until he was flamed, 
anyway).  Sixth, he seems to have been the one who came up with the 
skills list, equipment list, careers list, and so on that went into T4, 
as he previewed them on TML \'way back.

This weekend, Marc is meeting with Tim Brown and Courtney to iron out the 
specifics of the 1997 product schedule.

And, as was reported previously, Marc is also attempting to bring about 
changes to the IG product line, such as bringing on a professional 
graphic designer.

So, while he may not have been doing the main design, he was certainly 
involved with all the projects that have come along.  And he will 
undoubtedly continue to be involved, perhaps moreso as time goes on.  

I hope I\'ve helped to answer your question.  Further inquiries along 
these lines should properly be directed to Marc himself 
(farfuture@aol.com), as he knows a lot more about what he\'s done for 
Traveller than anyone here does. =)

Reloads: 50-round 1.8 kg, 100-round 3.55 kg, 200-round 7.1 kg.
Cost: 1460 Cr.

By my calculations, if the rounds are staggered, the 100-round magazine
ought to measure approximately 15 cm, and the 200-round mag about twice
that.  The 50-round mag ought to fit nicely into the grip.

        Any comments?

One or two interactions a *month*, yes, in a *very* big tank filled with
carbon tetrachloride, yes.

All quite true, and I\'ll buy a magic neutrino-detection technlogy,
especially if we can hand-wave it into the existing complex of
current-physics violations in Traveller, mostly involving strong force and
gravity manipulation, wtih Jump as a piece of pure magic uncorrelated to
anything.

Don\'t have FFS with me (shame on me!), but as I recall, superdense hull
material is only about 5 times denser than steel.  Given that on average a
neutrino will go through 10 lightyears of lead (!) without interacting,
I\'m not impressed by the improved interaction capabilities of a few dozen
meter-equivalents of steel.

You\'d find it the same way you find a submarine in an ocean filled with
ambient sound.  Use filters that strip away most of the background,
leaving only likely targets.  For example, you might look for

- - Neutrinos in energy bands characteristic of technological fusion power
  sources rather than stars and so forth,  (Ummmm...if, that is, neutrinos
  *can* have different energies, like photons...can they?  I\'m suddenly
  unsure on this.)
- - Neutrino sources with high angular motion (hence probably much nearer
  than \'fixed\' background sources).
- - Neutrino sources undergoing rapid modulations in intensity -- people do
  turn power plants up and down, bring them down entirely from time to
  time, and so forth.

There are probably many other tricks you could use.

Nope, neutrino sensors are tanks of cleaning fluid at the bottom of mines
(seriously).  Cosmic rays are incredibly energetic atomic nuclei that come
barrelling into Earth\'s atmosphere at very nearly the speed of light.  60
miles up or so, they plow into unsuspecting atoms in our atmosphere,
annihilating one another and creating a shower of secondary particles with
very short lifetimes which spray toward the ground, sometimes undergoing
additional decay along the way.  These secondary showers are what
ground-based cosmic-ray detectors really "see."  By examining the
constituents and energy of the secondary particles, one can reconstruct
(roughly) the original cosmic ray particle.

A researcher at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center once described
high-energy physics to me as "trying to figure out the workings of a Swiss
watch by firing a rifle at it and examining the resulting debris."  It\'s
an apt summary of the field.

It\'s both, really.  Right now neutrino *detections* are few and far
between because the puppies are so elusive; a whole buncha neutrinos have
to sail through your detector before one of them deigns to interact with
it an give you a signal.  If we had a magical 100%-efficient neutrino
catcher, the problem would reverse; the Universe is awash in a sea of
neutrinos.  Trillions of them are zipping through your body every second.
As I mentioned above, pulling a desired signal out of that would require
careful filtering.

The concrete blocks are a crude band-pass filter; only high-energy stuff
gets through to the detector.  This helps screen out the lower-energy
particles created through radioactive decay at the earth\'s
surface...though actually concrete itself is noticeably radioactive,
thanks to potassium-40 decay.  This process produces beta particles of a
few well-known energies, though; they probably just remove those spikes
from the data.

How about this....

Retirement pay (Ranks) base + rank number times 100
Retirement pay (Officers) base + rank number times 300

This way, Senior NCO\'s are roughly equal to a captain (as they are in pay for the Canadian 
Forces (I was a pay clerk)

I was always under the impression, from CT forward, that the 1:100 & 1/1000
limits were related to the structural integrity of the hull. Sticking more
that 3 dt effective hole in less than 100 dt of hull tended to compromise
the hull\'s ability to sustain damage or tolerate accelleration stresses.

Could be just differences in interpretation.

That is in poor taste.  Vilani is the other OTHER white meat, and should
be served with white wine.  And they don\'t have beans and rice on Vland.

What did the two Vilani say when eating the clown?

done much.

I must say that I was disappointed not to find any word from Marc in the new JTAS.

Oh yeah.  Joe forgot to mention that during the 2 days in the 
question, I was battling a very nasty cold/flu type thing, which 
caused sinus headaches, fever and a nasty ear infection.  The net result of 
this is that my portion of the book is written in Old High Vilani.  
So even if there are errors in proofreading, nobody\'s really going to 
know.  :-)

Coming Soon, Summer 1997 from CORE:  The world\'s first Old High 
Vilani to English Dictionary.  (As soon as we finish translating it 
from Trokh, that is...)  :-)

Stu

PS.  No, no portion of Milieu 0 is written in Old High Vilani (It is 
written entirely in K\'Kreer!)
PPS.  Before you ask, no, CORE is not releasing a Vilani to English Dictionary.
Look however, for CORE\'s 4 volume set, The complete works of William 
Shakespeare, translated into Gvegh.  :-)
PPPS.  Joe may have been exaggerating how reluctant I was to work on 
the book.  The holy water sprinkler and rack were used minimally at 
most.  :-)

But doesn\'t this assume bare metal?  If the surface was painted,
or otherwise coated, I\'m not sure this would be a problem.

Yes. In the integrated, fully consistent, Traveller economics system that
I\'m trying to work out, pensions are 20% of final pay for each term more
than four served, up to a maximum of 100%.

That is certainly as permanent as many human states, indeed, more so than 
many, but it dosen\'t say anything about why it lasted that long. Given the 
descriptions of Vargr psycology my guess is that it governs a lot less than 
an equivalent human empire would. Large groups inside the Thoengling Empire 
would be autonomous or even hostile to it. Vargr governments just don\'t put 
as much store on territory as human ones does.

That depends on how many. The Vargr would have a 50 to 1 advantage from the
TL. But you still need to gather an awful lot of Vargr to outnumber the
defenses of a population A world (that\'s assuming said world hasn\'t done
the smart thing and bought higher-TL defenses elsewhere (there are rules
for that in _Striker_).

What kind of shipyard capacity can you get from a world with 1000 inhabitants?
Even if you assume a large floating population you run into logistical
problems very fast. I doubt that Corridor Depot could build or activate
many ships at a time (Mind you, that dosen\'t make them useless. Most ship
repairs would be carried out by the ship\'s crew assisted by specialists
from Depot. But that only works with active ships). The ships would have
to be activated at the worlds where the shipyards are. So why complicate
things by storing them in another system? (And why store them in a place
defended by only a few squadrons when you can store them in in a place
defended by multiple fleets?)

But the example we should use is whatever the Traveller rules provide us,
unless they are completely unbeliveable. Since we are talking about imaginary 
technologies my yardstick is not whether the rules seem to agree with Real 
Life anno 1700 or 1800, but wether they are internally consistent.

Of course, for stuff that we don\'t have any rules for, Real Life provides
a good takeoff point for discussions. But we should stick to the rules until
we overload our "suspension of disbelief" circuits.

>The major building programs took at least a year to actually start. 

By the same token it takes time for such a program to wind down. Unless you
want to postulate that the Imperium abandoned any ship not finished on day
120-1110.

>Any wartime building program is a major administrative task which takes 
>some time to organise, 

Yes, but whatever the delays are, they must be subsumed in the building
rules. Besides, we can assume that plans exist for reactivating the
reserves, whatever they may be. Those plans only need one message ("We\'re
at war!") to be put into effect. Whatever time it takes to reactivate
those reserves can be used to plan any new buildings. Thus the building
program can be ready the moment the last reserve ship is finished.

>even more so when you don\'t have instantanious communications.

Sure, but you\'re only gaining a few weeks there. Tobia would know about the
war 7-8 weeks after it started (and it would keep up the building program
7-8 weeks longer after it ended, come to think about it).
 
>Now I see the point your making, my apologies. Yes there is something

If you reality check that against what a person need to survive you\'ll find
that the minimum per capita GNP is Cr1800 (Minimum food=Cr60/month, dismal 
lodgings=Cr60/month, and then I\'ve assumed Cr30/month for minimum 
necessities). Note that this would leave nothing over for defenses or
anything else. An average citizen (ie. what the rules call Ordinary level)
needs Cr7200 (Good food Cr200/month, Good lodging Cr200/month, and then I\'ve
assumed Cr200/month for basic necessities). Again, this is without accounting
for community expenses like defense, firefighting, etc (What I think of as
"insurance" expenses). In the integrated Traveller economics system that I\'m 
trying to work out I assume an average GNP of Cr10,000 per citizen, with an 
average expense distribution of 25% each for the four categories (food, 
lodging, personal necessities, and insurance).

>Perhaps the missing figure is crew costs. 

Perhaps. But consider that TCS maintenance figures are 100 times greater
than the annual maintenance alone and dosen\'t include unexpected damages 
(ie. battle damage). You can get an awful lot of support service for the
remaining 99%.

>I know that TCS says they are factored in, but if they weren\'t it would go 
>a long way to rectifiing it.

A way, but not a long way. You could maybe increase the effective maintenance
of a ship by Cr100,000 per crew, but not more than that, IMO.

And every one of these solutions hits the Vargr at least as much as it hits
the Imperium. Unless you let the Vargr get away with smaller crew salaries
to reflect a lack of pension scemes. OTOH, a generous pension would be a
good way for a Vargr ruler to discourage desertions, so I could make a
case for _higher_ personel costs for Vargr.

I still think that the best we have to go on is the Traveller rules and

You mean threatening to set his captives on fire? That certainly was a
highly unorthodox tactic ;-). However, it only got him a ceasefire. It
was the death of the Tsar that made the whole question moot by breaking
the defensive alliance.

No, in 1807 Copenhagen was taken by siege. The fleet was captured with

Which is not quite fair on the British since it is hard to imagine that
Denmark wouldn\'t suspect that an armed neutrality alliance wouldn\'t provoke 
some sort of response.

Length? 100 cm = 1 meter; 1.558 meters long? 5 feet? Wouldn\'t this require
some kind of a minimum strength or dexterity to use, unless it is always
mounted on something?  

I may not have the hang of the meteric system, but a 5 foot long gun seems a
bit unwieldy. Certainly not going to get may places without drawing LOTS of
attention.

	I would have thought that if you\'re going to the touble of painting every
metal surface in the ship, it would be easier to use the inert gas instead
anyway. I mean, the gas would be far easier to get into every part of the
ship than using paint wouldn\'t it? Even spray painting or whatever system
you use to apply it couldn\'t hope to get to as many nooks and crannies as
gas. And removing the gas would be easier afterwards as well, surely.

	Also, someone else mentioned that if vacuum welding did take place, and
the ship ended up useless, wouldn\'t it have some salvageable value? Cutting
it up for the metals for example, or smashing your way in through any
transparent frontages to enter, say, the bridge or some part of the ship
that may have valuable components or cargo. Any possibilities here?

	See ya...

	Yeah, this thing is very unwieldy, though since the design is more
or less equivalent to trying to make a 20mm aircraft cannon into a
hunting rifle, maybe it SHOULD be. This is definitely a rifle that
shouldn\'t be shot without a rest.

	But it also points out one of the many failings of
FFS...regardless of anything else, many parts of the small (hah!) arms
design sequences are broken. Bipods for instance, should NOT mass at 8
kilos!

FFS isn\'t completely broken, it\'s just that the equations all assume a
straight line where there is considerable divergence at either end of the
design scale. Unfortunately, given the \'Big guns...we gotta have BIG
guns!\' sort of attitude most PC\'s have, that non linear region is where we
spend most of the design time.

As a forinstance, I tried to design a Barret .50 Cal rifle...it ended up
quite a bit heavier than the real thing, but when I tried to do my utterly
middle of the road S&W .38 revolver, it cane out bang on the nose in size,
weight, and performance.

Anyone with 3g^3 care to take a whack at this design?

    'body' => 'Something that may be relevant; I posted this what, just before Xmas, and
nobody commented -- must mean you all agreed ;-)

Anyway, its sort of relevant to this topic:-

Something I read the other day got me thinking -- so bear with me for a
moment, even those who would claim its an unusual situation ;-)

Imagine that you have a brand new 1997 model Car (fill in model and make of
choice), just off the showroom floor, in fact - less than 20 ks on the
clock. OK, then imagine that you immediately put it into your garage at
home on returning from the showroom and, without further ado, left it
there. You make no attempts to prepare it for storage - its just sitting
there.

How many months do you think would pass before some vital subsystem would
malfunction if you decided to get into it one day and simply turn the key
in the ignition and drive away? Six months? Twelve months? Two years? Ten
Years? A hundred years?

I think we can safely say that the chances of it being operational without
*much* work after as little as *ten* years would be close to zero; and
after a hundred it would take more work than the machine would be worth,
except as a "vintage" car, to get it running again.

Rubber parts decay, plastics stiffen and crack, fuel evaporates, fabrics
decay or are attacked by insects, metal parts rust.

Even if it was stored, unprepared, in a vacuum, metal parts tend to surface
weld themselves in such conditions over lengthy periods of time, though if
it was a *space* vehicle the overall structure may remain relatively sound.

Try the same thing with, say, a brand new Laptop Computer, top of the line
model. Because it doesn\'t rely as much (in some ways) on moving parts,
perhaps it *might* last a little longer - perhaps not.

What\'s the point? Well, what defines Forerunner Artifacts - *some* of them
(considerable numbers, in fact, *all* Black Globe generators are Forerunner
artifacts, remember!) - still work some hundreds of thousands of years
after being abandoned (for whatever reason). Whether this is *real world*
realistic or not, it is something that evidently *defines* Forerunner tech
(or some of it, at least).

We also know from the Darrian sourcebook that TL16 Starships and related
tech lasts for a 1000 years or more - though this was contradicted in the
Regency Soucebook, something I personally would ignore - but, then, you all
know that I believe that TNE and Virus were a bad joke :-(

Regardless of whether Virus exists or not, the thing defining TL16 tech
seems to be that it, too, is much longer lasting than would normally be
expected.

So this is the question - why?

This is rhetorical, of course! I have a *suggestion* -- one that actually
ties in with the insult to the intelligence that was Virus (though one that
makes what Virus was *vastly* more believable ... the idea of walking
microchips is about as ludicrous and science-fantasy as you can get).

Well, *how* would these items last for so long? The answer seems to be that
they must have some capacity for *self-repair*. In a limited sense they
must be "alive". I would suggest that its the *electronics* alone that are
most likely to be like this - and, while I doubt that they\'d be alive in
the sense that they were in the "Virus" descriptions we have (which seem to
be based on a silly idea by someone who had not a clue about computers and
what they may be like in 3000 years time - OK, I admit it, I *loathed* the
*stupidity* of Virus :-(  -- means that they would have to have some sort
of inbuilt "template" for their circuitry and that this *could* become
corrupted under the wrong conditions ... at least if the "right"
precautions were not taken.

Perhaps it is simply that this was the Imperium, a TL15 culture, making its
first tottering steps towards TL16 ... and eventually to something
approaching the reliability of Forerunner level tech. It certainly puts
"Virus" in a new light - and makes the pathetic anti-computer fears of the
Regency and RefCol just that, pathetic ... superstitious drivel based on a
lack of understanding (and, in the case of the RefCol, perhaps, a lack of a
*desire* to understand) as to where the new tech had gone wrong. But, then,
the Vilani have always had an anti-computer streak that the Terrans don\'t
seem to have had.

Would Darrian computers have been affected by Virus? We don\'t know, as the
Regency and RefCol and their era are years away from ever being broached
again (and it can\'t be *too* far away for me!), and, anyway, since the
Regency effectively cut itself off from the rest of the Imperium to protect
itself from the Virus, thus "protecting" the Darrians from something that
they may never have needed protection against anyway, we\'ll probably never
know.

But would *ancient* level computers have been affected by Virus. According
to the ludicrous way it seems to have been implemented in TNE, *yes*.
According to my suggestion? NO! The Ancient computers would be a *mature*
level of self-repair tech (if they haven\'t gone beyond that, in fact), and
so would probably not even recognise the presence of viral code!

Anyway, its an idea that I thought might be of interest, whether you think
Virus is garbage or not.

- ----
- ----
Actually, in addition to the above, have you noted that in the Central
Supply Catalog that there are several items listed that are basically
salvage from the *Rule of Man* period some what, 800 odd years before! And
they are still usable *and* safe to use. These are listed as TL14. So even
at TL14 there must be stuff -- one of them is a Vacc Suit, IIRC -- that is
self-repairing.

As far as I can see it, it is one of the more reasonable explanations.

On behalf of Imperium Games, I would like to announce that IG has 
added a new service to us, the Traveller internet community.  An IRC 
server is being provided for us to use for our scheduled #traveller 
events.  

This server is *not* connected to the IRC networks in existance in 
any way.  It is a stand-alone system.  The upside to this is that 
we will all be on the same server and the same pair of ports, no lag, 
no kline problems.  The downside for those that connect to multiple 
channels at once, is that you will no longer be able to, while 
meeting with us.  This service is being provided as long as there is 
no abuse of the server. Abuse includes running clones or bots or 
trading warez.

The server will only be open for our use for the scheduled events.  
These events are listed on the IG website under Traveller Chat and 
there is a link to email me from there.  Unscheduled Traveller chat 
will continue to be held on Undernet #traveller.

Please email me if you are starting a new IRC game, have any questions
about the schedule, wish to suggest a topic or event, or wish to 
volunteer your vast knowledge to lead a discussion or teach a Design
Workshop.  Also, as always, email me if you need any help in getting 
on IRC.

The address to the server is:

www.imperiumgames.com, ports 6665 & 6666

Watch the IG site and CmdrX\'s homepage for news on our first Design 
Workshop!  This workshop will take place either late this month or 
early in February.

Thanks to IG for providing this service to us, and to David Bullock 
for all his work in setting it up and keeping it running!

Yes. In the integrated, fully consistent, Traveller economics system that

        Well, yeah.  Note that the title says "Very Large Game Gauss
Rifle", not "body pistol".  You would not want to go strolling down the
streets of Sylea with one casually slung over a shoulder.  For one, the
back strain would get to you after a while...

        This thing basically has Great White Hunter and Ernest Hemingway
written all over it...  I figure that most people with normal testosterone
levels would hire a gunbearer out of the local gym to carry it around the
savannah, and wherever possible fire it using the bipod.  If the recoil
numbers mean what I think, only a complete nutbar would try and fire it
from the hip..:)

        Well, I dunno about the 20mm comparison.  Originally, I tried to
design it at .666 caliber, or about 16.9mm.  I quickly gave up when I
discovered that the reciever would have weighed 30-odd kg.  I was basically
going for a) a caliber that had three sixes in it and b) ludicrously high
muzzle velocities.  At 6.66 mm, it is larger-bore than most modern assault
rifles, but smaller than a lot of hunting calibers, so the projectile is
not terribly big and heavy by 20th century firearm standards AFAIK.  OTOH,
most gauss designs I\'ve seen are in the 4-5mm range, so...  The projectile
is relatively boring; it\'s just the muzzle velocity that makes it so nasty.

        Yeah...  I noticed that the bipod seemed a tad heavy too.  I left
it that way because I know nearly zip about gunsmithing, and because I
didn\'t want to start fudging immediately.  I\'ll probably just adjust the
values before I have people start shooting them at my players ;).

The only way human wave attacks like that work is if you can overwhelm your
target.  The Soviets made very sucessful use of bayonet charges after the
winter of 1943.. they had the manpower to absorb the massive casulties, and
the Germans soon learned that firepower wouldn\'t stop them, so units tended
to rout at the first sign of a wave. >>

Probably the most famous recent bayonet charge was during the Falklands 
War, when the Paras charged up hill, at night, against a superior number of 
dug-in Argentinians. Only a bunch of psychopaths like the Paras would try a 
stunt like that (and get away with it)!

This thread has come up before. Leonard Erikson came up with a good idea 
which uses Gravitational Tidal Forces as the limiting factor to jump 
distance.

See the following Traveller digest for his excellent post:
http://ftp.mpgn.com/Gaming/Traveller/MailingListArchive/Traveller/v1996.n62
4

I will summarize:

The simplified tidal force formula he gave is 

C=GM/R^3

Where C = "Gravitational Curvature" in units of acceleration per meter
      G = Gravitational constant
      M = Mass of body
      R = Distance from body

For Earth:

GM = 3.986e14
Radius of Earth = 6.378e6 meters

Leonard Calculated that for the 10 dia. limit:
>For 10 diameters:
>C=3.986e14/6.378e7^3	C=4e14/6.4e7^3
>C=1.536e-9		C=1.526e-9

>
>And the 100 diameter figure is 1.5e-12. Not bad A factor of 1000
>difference in curvature. No wonder it\'s so much more dangerous!

hmmmm... I never noticed this before, but Leonard used 10 x the *radius* 
of the earth to calculate curvature. He should have used 20 x the 
*radius* to get 10 *diameters*.

(Technically the 10 dia. limit might mean from *surface* to starship, so 
another radius would need to be added -- but I\'ll assume 10 dia. limit 
means 10 diameters from centre of planet to starship, since it\'s canon in 
Book 6: Scouts; see page 42 under "Stellar Radii")

Soooo, my calcs give
C=3.968e14/(20*6.378e6)^3
C=1.91e-10

and the 100 dia. figure would be 1.91e-13

One interesting thing is that since density is mass/volume and volume is 
dependent upon the cube of the radius, the safe jump limit for any world 
with a similar density to Earth would always be 10 diameters! Therefore 
the 10 dia. "rule of thumb" is a valid approximation for worlds of 
similar density to Earth.

To find the safe jump distance (100 dia.), I will use C calculated above 
for 10 dia. and multiply by 10 to get the 100 dia. limit...

r = 10 * cuberoot(GM/C)

since G/C = 6.673e-11 / 1.91e-10 ~= 0.35 the formula becomes:

r = 10 * cuberoot(0.35M)

Where r = distance in meters
      M = mass in kilograms.

quick check:
  Earth r = 10 * cuberoot(0.35 * 5.98e24) = 1.28e9 m = 200 earth radii

Formula seems fine, lets see what happens for other bodies....

Sun
  r = 10 * cuberoot(0.35 * 1.99e30) = 8.86e10 m = 128 solar radii (within 
orbit of Venus)

Moon
  r = 10 * cuberoot(0.35 * 7.35e22) = 2.95e8 m = 170 lunar radii

Jupiter ("typical" Large Gas Giant)
  r = 10 * cuberoot(0.35 * 1.90e27) = 8.73e9 m = 122 jovian radii

Neptune ("typical" Small Gas Giant)
  r = 10 * cuberoot(0.35 * 1.02e26) = 3.29e9 m = 133 neputunian radii

Red Giant (M5 II, numbers from Book 6, Scouts)
  r = 10 * cuberoot(0.35 * 16 * 1.99e30) = 2.23e11 m = 321 solar radii

Since an M5 II star has a radius of 712 solar radii, the safe jump 
distance is within the surface of the star!


>White dwarfs have the mass of the sun for a radius of 1/70 Rsun (again this
>is an approximation). The density of this rocky stars is around 300Kg/cm3.
>The range factor is not the same as above. 

Your hypothetical white dwarf, would have a 10 dia. limit of 127.5 solar 
radii like the sun, just multiply by 70 to get the number of white dwarf 
radii. 

>So IMO, the 100 diameter Safe jump should be multiblied by a density factor
>just to get \'dead stars flavor\'. I suggest this factor could be around 
>100,000. 

Wow. I think I prefer the factor of 70 to your 100,000. IMHO, the safe 
jump limit should depend on mass only, not density; the safe jump 
distance from the white dwarf should be the same distance as from the 
sun, if they have the same mass. The density only affects the measurement 
of distance in terms of *body diameters*.

Therefore, safe jump distance measured in diameters of the body depends 
on the cube root of the density.

Have a similar design in the pipeline.. designed to replace the Gauss weapon
given in CSC for BattleDress, but I can tweak the design down to a hunting
rifle.

BTW:  I\'m currently on a long hiatus from work (I just love having cancer
:/), and so my web pages will be showing some definite changes.. I need some
material for the silly era.. especially bad die roll stories and famous last
words from Traveller games.

An example or two:

"I don\'t care that we\'re only 8 diameters out, jump NOW!"
"Wait, did you say that the Marine WAS or WASN\'T wearing BattleDress?"
"Those can\'t be real Ancients."

Send to the usual place.

The problem I am having is that for ten years and more my

have got very used to Jump-6, FGMP-15, 9/fib, etc as the 
best available tech. The new rules seem determined to 
straighjacket us into TL 12 as tops. All right as a new 
start, but very hard to be knocked down to.

I know the settings is M0 but it wouldn\'t have been too 
hard to extend the design tables to TL15, would it? Then we 
could have used T4 rules and picked our own era. As it is 
we haven\'t bothered with T4 at all.

AFAIK This subject hasn\'t been done to death (D&D? :)). 

I\'d think it a more useful thing for civvie ships than 
military ones. If I\'d just won a fight with an enemy 
vessel, and it had ejected its\' BB, I would surely spend a 
few seconds and a couple of rounds of laser turret fire to 
deny its\' information to the enemy. After all, it would - 
by definition - be easier to locate; it\'d be useless if it 
wasn\'t. 

For a liner, freighter, or merchantman, it would be a good 
idea. Of course, misjumps or similar would leave the BB 
stranded in jumpspace which wouldn\'t be a lot of help.

- ----

Lewis Roberts defends his Liner design;

>> I have to admit I didn\'t know about baggage requirments 
for passengers and crew. If you want to fix this remove 114 
of the High Passengers and use that as cargo room. <<

I would have thought that someone designing ships for the 
second _official_ Traveller publication should have a 
working knowledge of all the rules pertaining to starships.

>> I am a much harsher person than Phil, becuase only the 
Captain and
First Officer are in singles. The rest of the command staff 
is doubled
up, and the crew is triple bunked.   <<

This is not going to make for a happy crew. If you\'re 
running a luxury hotel, you employ good quality staff. The 
same goes for a lux liner. Such top-notch crewers are not 
going to be impressed with double- and triple- occupancy 
accommodation. I think you\'d either struggle to recruit the 
staff you need or end up with second-rate officers and 
complaints from your well-heeled passengers.

>> Don Perrin never told me that ships needed these [rescue 
balls]. Do any of the ships  in the book have these? I 
don\'t recall seeing any.  Also I think they  are pretty 
dopey, and the chance of them being used pretty slim. <<

This bespeaks a lack of co-ordination. The ball has been 
declared "canon", at least as far as this supplement is 
concerned, by the statements in its\' design. And one of the 
supplement\'s authors doesn\'t know this. There should be 
consensus among the authors, surely?

>And note that the idea of a Luxury class passenger sitting 
in a notionally  >4 (or even 8) displacement ton cabin - is 
laughable (its 3 x 6 meters, and  >that doesn\'t allow for 
the 1 ton supposedly allocated to general passenger  
>spaces rather than cabin space - leaving that out, its 3 x 
4.5 meters)!

>> That [staterooms & 1 ton for general passenger spaces] 
is why the design of the ship includes a 9000m^3 Ballroom. 
(Its  about 2/3 of the size of the Ballroom of the Hilton 
in Atlanta. I  figured that out during the Crow II 
presentation at DragonCon Last Year)  The ship also has a 
500m^3 casino and a 500m^3 sports and rec center.  << 

None of this is going to make day-to-day life nicer for the 
passengers, just "excursions" or evening entertainment. The 
extra space applies to cafes, lounges, and so on. 

>> I realize some of the above details aren\'t in the 
Starship books. I  sent the complete design sheet to Don, 
but he didn\'t put any of the  details into the write up.  I 
did write up the flavor piece, but I  figured Don would 
change it around and include some of the details from  the 
design sheet.  I guess I figured wrong, well live and learn.  <<

>> I don\'t really like the new USP, I much prefer the FFS 
design listings  from TNE, it had much more detail to the 
listing.  <<

The problem does seem mainly to be in central 
co-ordination. I am not flaming Lewis here - or anyone, 
come to that. I agree whole-heartedly that the full 
descriptive texts doubtless produced by the designers of 
these vessels should have been included to give more detail 
to the listings. I also agree that the new design rules 
don\'t much appeal, though that\'s really a subjective, 
matter of taste thing. 

No, sorry, Starships isn\'t salvageable. Some of the 
deckplans are usable with much work; I may post up an 
improved version of one to my site if I get the time.

>> Again, there is no good reason why they can\'t publish 
the background  simulteneously or even *soon* (not months 
later) after the rulebook is out  on the street. <<

Except the manifestly obvious need to spend much, much more 
time and care producing the things to prevent the loyal 
customer base saying "bugger this" and peeling off.

I think its a good idea, but I\'m a big character roleplayer.  This would
require some technical/universe knowledge on the players part, good for
indoctrinated players.  

This goes along with making sure your best characters don\'t bite it due
to dice rolls, but is less intrusive.  Maybe you could come up with a
quick "quality" index of descriptivess vs. bonus.

That may be.  However, it may also be that all the "bare" metal is
coated at manufacture to prevent corrosion or that you briefly
fill the ship with a gas that coats the surfaces and then don\'t
worry about maintaining pressure.

Whether this is harder or easier depends on the what coating
agents are available at Traveller TL\'s.

>And removing the gas would be easier afterwards as well, surely.

You don\'t necessarily have to remove the coating.

Easily fixed - a black box which ejects looking like a piece of 
debris, but which does not start to signal it\'s presence for some 
hours, or until a pre-defined period with no active sensors operating 
in it\'s immediate area has occured.

True.  In my own games, the technical stuff, where not provided for in 
the rules, would be something that players would certainly be allowed to 
make up off-the-cuff.  Over time, these things would become standard 
aspects of the game universe I would be running.

Good idea.  A simple chart giving five or so quality labels and 
associated DM\'s, with a few examples provided, would do the trick for any 
reasonably-imaginative referee (and if there are any referees out there 
w/o a reasonable amount of imagination, I don\'t want to know about it 
[G]).

HOW TO GET RID OF THE "WINMAIL.DAT" ATTACHMENT IN MICROSOFT EXCHANGE:

1.	Double-click on the "Mail and Fax" icon in "Control Panel".
2.	Click on the "Services" tab, and select "Internet Mail" from the
	list.  If "Internet Mail" is not listed, click "Add" to add this
	service.
3.	Click "Properties", and then "Message Format".
4.	Turn off the option that reads "Use MIME when sending messages".
5.	Click "OK" and then "OK" again.
6.	Double-click on the name of each recipient in your "Address Book".
7.	Turn off the option that reads "Always send to this recipient in
	Microsoft rich-text format".

Now, once this is done, Exchange will put equal signs "=" at the end of
each line.  To get rid of this last quirk:

8.	Open the "Internet Mail Properties" window, and click on the

For some reason whenever I referee a game of Traveller, the players
who role-play (instead of roll play) always seem to have an easier
time accomplishing things (and often have a chance to succeed when 
others don\'t)!

Weird, huh? ;-}

 That was me that suggested that, and it wasn\'t so much that the
 Helvetica was boring as that masses of it are just too hard for
 my 33-year-old eyes to read easily.  Certainly Times is boring
 - but it\'s _readable_ in quantity, and that\'s what I\'m after.

 I\'ve never seen either of the fonts you name; don\'t take this

 have.  I just don\'t want to end up with a headache after
 reading the entire book cover-to-cover in one sitting.

	I will when I start my campaign soon, although my players are good
roleplayers (one of them currently GM\'s our D&D sessions!)

	Someone once asked about players who just sit there and contribute nothing
to the game in terms of roleplaying, except for maybe some particular
portion of the game, like combat, and what did we call these people. Well,
we call them "Steve", because Steve would just sit there saying almost
nothing during the whole session, and at any time an encounter occured, he
would look up and say those immortal words, "Can we bash?"

	See ya...

	To prevent destruction by the destroyers of the ship that the black box
was in, couldn\'t it be shielded to prevent detection? Plus it could be very
small - it\'s only carrying info - and shoved out at great speed when its
host ship blows, with thousands of dummy black boxes so that the attacking
ships wouldn\'t notice which direction the real one went in, or could it be
hidden among other debris even?

	And so that it can eventually be picked up, could it not be designed to
send out a signal that only an authorised ship can detect, like a code
embedded in the background noise of the static that permeates everywhere? A
bit like that Trek episode where Riker, Deanna and Llwaxana got kidnapped
by the Ferengi, and Riker sent out a signal that rode on the carrier of the
Ferengi ship\'s warp leakage signal thingy that darling Wesley detected.

	Therefore, we could have a black box system that has thousands of dummy
blackboxes embedded in some way in the hull of the ship, and the real one
could be shielded, or there could be say ten real ones, or a number of
black boxes that the attackers don\'t know about. Then each one emits a
rescue signal at different intervals, say, each one 12 hours after the
previous one so not all of them get blasted should they somehow be
detected, or they could be set to two days after the previous one, for
example. How long will the attackers wait around to see if they can blast
all of them? Not for long, that\'s for sure, when they\'ve got others to kill. 

	Also, surely you\'d only need one recorder, and the say, ten or hundred or
whatever storage chips would be linked into the recorder from where ever
they are on the ship (owner / captain stipulates possibly).

	Let\'s go overboard with this...if the destroying ship picks up a dummy
black box, it could contain a virus that makes itself known after they\'ve
downloaded its contents, sending their ship into an uncontrolled flight
towards the local star or nearest big rock (think I\'ll do this with my
players!) or the black box could just say "wrong one suckers!"

	But, all this could prevent a lot of ship combat occuring, which let\'s
face it is a part of Traveller. Or could it actually be integrated into the
whole system anyway? Maybe attackers will only disable the defending ship,
thus preventing the black boxes from launching, and board it instead. Maybe
it would make it all the more interesting, you\'d have ship combat, boarding
action, then hunting the swines down afterwards!

	What d\'ya reckon?

	See ya...

	Yes, good point, and then things like valves and hatches and a few other
things I guess would still be checked just prior to mothballing, just in
case any coating has worn off or got scratched badly, as it could do with
iris valves.

Yep, but I don\'t express it openly, I just apply it and let my *smart*
players figure out that more *roleplaying* leads to better results.  ;-> 

When it comes to fixing something, I\'m big on hidden problems too. A player
that just "fixes it" is likely to end up treating a symptom rather than the
real problem, even if the "fix" seems to succeed it might not last. 
Players that explain *how* they go about fixing something...or at least are
sharp enough to ask me questions about what they see, feel, know...will be
more apt to find the hidden problem and get to a real solution.

Now, let me throw in a little bit about the task system.  I\'ve taken to
adding different Attributes, depending on exactly what the PC is doing, to
the skill to achieve target numbers.  

Example:

The used gravcar your group bought begins to vibrate heavily at airspeeds
above 100kph.  The vibration seems to be coming from the right rear
quadrant,

1. Gravtics+INT to diagnoise the problem.

    Probably a misaligned grav unit back there.

2. Gravitcs+EDU to figure out the fix from the manual, schematics,
   or experience with fixing this kind of problem.

    Remove the grav unit and test the components, replace any you
    can\'t fix and tune the components into sync.

3. Mechanics+STR to remove the heavy grav unit for servicing.

    If the PC is asking the right questions she might notice that
    the flange that the grav unit was attached to is bent out of
    shape (Mechanics+INT).  This could lead down a blind alley...or
    to the *real* problem...or the PC could totally ignore/miss it.
    
4. Gravitics+DEX to test and realign.

    Discovering that the components are all good and seem to be
    still in sync.  
    
If the PC just replaces the unit, the problem will remain, but if he
continues to investigate.

5.  Electronics+INT to recognize the crimped power cable under the
    removed grav unit might be the true cause of the problem.
    
    The power cable is frayed, there\'s an intermittent short.  The
    grav unit is probably cycling on and off rapidly as it tries to
    cope with the shorting cable (Gravitics+EDU).  Maybe, maybe not,
    but it *certainly* will lead to a failing unit if it isn\'t
    fixed.  ;->

6.  Electronics+Dex to replace the crimped (and slightly frayed
    cable).
    
If the player *continues* to investigate...WHY is the cable
frayed?

7.  Mechanic+INT to notice the flange holding the grav unit is bent
    and might be rubbing the power cable.  A bent flange could be
    causing the grav unit to vibrate, and that might be causing the
    gravcar to shimmy (Mechanic+Edu)!
    
8.  Mechanic+STR to bend the flange back into proper position.

    If it breaks, then you\'ve got to replace it! ;->
    
9.  Mechanic+DEX to weld a replacement flange back on.
    
    But why was the flange bent in the first place? 
    
And so on, and so on!  


This might seem like a lot of work, but the Technician and
Engineering PC\'s deserve to have some fun too!  Besides, I hide a good bit
of this from the player, doing the rolls myself based on what the player
tells me that her PC is doing.  The player might stop at any of several
points in the repair, or even continue further perhaps discovering that
this gravcar has a slightly bent frame, probably caused by a *very* hard
landing. ;->

If the player just says his PC "fixes it", I tend to make *poor*
assumptions about how completely the PC is doing the job.  If the PC plays
it out...even if she knows *nothing* about the subject...then I make *good*
assumptions about how through the PC is, and tell the player how the PC is
investigating and solving the problem.  The player learns how to ask the
right questions, make the right tests, and what to look for...for the
*next* time something like this comes up.

Hey Joe! You asked. ;->

        IMOH the gun is long, heavy, and unwieldly.  With a damage of 10.5
(which rounds to 11) who is going to tell you that.  Firing from the hip or
the shoulder will be easy if you only consider the recoil, but unrealistic
if you consider real firearms techniques.  Were it real life (or you play
realisticly) you would only fire it prone or braced (like over a vehicle or
wall.  The recoil of 2 means that a average person (str 6) could fire three
shots controlobly and aimed with the lase sight (using TNE rules--sorry I
don\'t know T4.)  The recoil of three is not overly high, but does rule out
high rates of fire when shot off-hand.  But this shouldn\'t be bad since it
is a hunting/sporting/sniping rifle.  

        If you design it backwards from damage, to muzzle velocity, to
barrel size and reciever size, then pick a velocity, and use it to figure
the round size.  I think you might get a lighter weapon.  But that would
defeat your intention of having a weapon with 666 in it.  If you could go to
TL-13, I know that would make a huge difference in your required energy.   

The size of the round 6.66mm is not large at all for sporting rifles.  A
NATO .233" is 5.56mm and a .308" is a NATO 7.62mm so your round is a bit
smaller in bore.  A .50" is 12.5mm and some big game guns like the .458" and
.416" are up there is size too.  But this is sorta all moot since firearms
and gauss weapons are like apples and oranges.

Also IMHO, I think FFS doesn\'t take well enough into account the advances
that are in materials.  High TL (10+) weapons should weigh a fraction to
comparable weapons of low TL (6-8).  Carbon fiber, and carbon laminate have
higher strenths that steel at the same weight.  So if you need the same
strenght, weigh lots less.  I feel (with a materials minor/concentration)
that their TL modifiers aren\'t what they should be.  

that\'s my 2cr. worth.

Operational Acceleration: special: computer controls Contra-gravity drive
so as to balance pogo stick (within safe operational parameters to permit
some lateral motion) and to nullify 95% of external gravity field save
between moment where spring first enters into contact with ground and when
spring has compressed over 75% (adjustable by parents to provide for more
or less impetus) of its total travel.  Once spring (actually a TL-10
smart-fluid variable resistance shock absorption cylinder) has reached
parentally approved maximum travel point, thrust resumes to completely
nullify external gravity field until spring has reached full extension, at
which point thrust reverts to 95% of external field.

        Parentally programmed safety cutoffs cut drive once maximum
parentally approved altitude has been attained, and adjust velocity during
descent portion of trajectory to remain within parentally approved speed
limits.  Other safety features include deadman switches on the handles to
detect child losing grip, and a safety harness to ensure child remains on
board.  Pogo stick will not operate without harness being attached.

        Theoretical acceleration is 8 G\'s (7.5 or so with child on board).
This is only attainable by tampering with safety overrides and removing the
hardware governor.  FSG&T will not accept any liability arising from such
dangerous misuse and strongly condemns the sort of irresponsible mind that
would contemplate it.

Box: Comes plastered with advisory warnings against tampering in order to
allow child to reach orbit, advisory warnings against operating near
potentially hazardous obstacles such as trees, tall buildings, swamps and
large bodies of water, overhead power lines and airports.


        Design notes: credit for the inspiration goes to Ross Coburn, who
gave me the idea purely by accident, and now sorely regrets it.  I didn\'t
bother calculating the acceleration rating figures; I bet that 50 kg worth
of structurecomp ought to be plenty strong.  I also fudged the volume some
to leave a margin for error, and didn\'t bother doing the numbers for fuel
supply and the glove compartment; they\'re well within the margin for error
in the volume and chassis mass numbers.  And I didn\'t bother computing the
cost of the radar altimeter; this would be a simple device whose cost would
be negligible at TL-12.

       I did this with the beta VDS pdf file I downloaded from Joe Heck\'s site.

1	3		3		0

3	3		9		0
4	3		12		-2 (10-12=-2)

2	5	10	0 (10-10=0)
3	5	15	-5 (10-15=-5)
4	5	20	-10 (10-20=-10)

penalty also applies on the shot which generates the penalty, IIRC.

Low Str characters may not get many shots without penalty.

1st shot is always at NO penalty. (Can\'t recal whther per round or engagement).

Reccomend getting "Small Arms" book for T:2k, as it has the rules for
recoil and damage and pen, and has LOADS of real-world stats.

OF COURSE IT\'S A GOOD IDEA! It encourages ROLE-Playing over ROLL-Playing...

In my own gaming, however, I don\'t apply penalties for poor, just bonuses

Originally, my thought was to help with the task system problems 
(lowering the target numbers significantly - thus the penalties for poor), 
but it worked out to be very unwieldy (DM -6 and such).  Still, I continued 
along the line of thought and started coming up with a table so that 
there would be something concrete.  Then I decided to see if anyone else 
had a specific system they used.

Heheh.  That would be the least of the things one might do to such a 
player. ;)

That\'s a good method, but I was thinking along the lines of some rule

Oy, sounds like Engineer heaven! :)  I\'m all for having less rules in 
general, but at times I think it\'d be nice to have rules as detailed as 
the combat system for a lot of typical character activites.

Over The Edge uses a similar system in combat - as far as I remember, if =
your combat action is "I swing at it" or similar, you gain a negative DM =
for being boring.  If you say "I dodge under his guard and thrust my =
knife upwards between his ribs" then you suffer no penalty.  Of course, =

I\'ve run OTE a couple of times and this rule did seem to liven combats =

Similarly Feng Shui allows characters to try outrageous stunts with only =
a minor penalty.  Repetative actions are also penalised.  This helps to =
simulate the way-out action of HK movies and probably wouldn\'t be =

Hmmm, it depends on how thick the paint is but I think you\'re right;
IIRC, vacuum welding primarily occurs primarily with metal to metal

Phil,
The above makes sense to me. Although I personally found the concept of
self-aware Viruses running all over the Imperium an unlikely stretch,
the idea of self repairing equipment going haywire (ala a cancer) is
much more palatable. An evolution into a self-aware form would be
possible but only, IMO, under incredibly rare circumstances (like a
Referee Special). A Virus-controlled ship would be more of a rabid
animal running amuck rather than self-appointed assassins. In fact,
this behaviour describes the documented actions of the initial Virus
infections rather nicely.

Look for design specs on Commander X\'s homepage, under #traveller:

http://www.magicnet.net/~opp-mag/

Commander X will be giving a walk-thru to the design first, then 
holding a question and answer session after that.  

Look forward to seeing everyone there!

   My impression has always been that the 1:100/1000 figure was just a
nice round number that somebody pulled out of the dark of space.  It is
possible that it was explained away as you indicate, but I can find no
reference to such an explanation.

   I was attempting to explain, in game terms, the change from the
1:100/1000 ratio used in CT/MT to the surface area based system used in
TNE, and why Imperial vessels are basically underarmed for what they
could potentially in the way of weaponry.  It\'s interesting, but if you
use standard turrets, you can comfortably fit three turrets per 100 tons
displacement on a given ship using the TNE rules.  As the turrets in TNE
usually contain one weapon, and the turrets in CT/MT usually contained
three, the numbers sort of balance out, though you certainly get more
bang for your buck out of the TNE version.

Well this is a tall order, and a bit complicated. Parts of this stuff - the
aliens in particular - I suspect will find their way into my science
fiction stories at some point, so I wouldn\'t want to throw them out on the
net just yet. Basically I\'m using the game as a goad to make me flesh out
neglected parts of my on-going future history - it\'s very different from
Traveller (no FTL travel or gravitics, for instance), but the two futures
will overlap significantly in my game universe.

Other parts, such as an article on Clone Societies, I am considering
submitting to JTAS. If they don\'t want it, I\'ll be sure to send it to
Freelance Traveller or other such webzine. It needs another draft before
it\'ll be ready.

Any other stuff that might be useful to other Traveller referees, I will
certainly publish, one way or another. I hate to let all that work go to
waste on just a few game sessions :)

RE: astronomy stuff: you may remember, several months back I posted a
pointer to a very cool website about the Local Interstellar Medium. I don\'t
have the URL handy, but if you search for "Local Interstellar Medium" you
will find it. There\'s also a link to it from the 3-D Starmap site (also a
must-see): <http://www.clark.net/pub/nyrath/starmap.html>

Anyway, the LISM site has some absolutely terrific maps of the local
galactic arm, out to about 500pc. I\'ve finally found the book those maps
were scanned from: _The Guide to the Galaxy_ by Nigel Henbest and Heather
Couper (Cambridge, 1994). Not a cheap book, because it\'s packed with
gorgeous color astrophotography, but it has the best, most detailed maps of
various regions of the galaxy I\'ve ever seen. An entertaining, in-depth
description of the galaxy\'s structure as it is currently understood. Highly
recommended.

Cool Astro-fact for the Day: there is only one known neutron star within
250 light years of Sol, the star \'Geminga\' (short for Gemini gamma-ray
source, though it also means \'does not exist\' in Milanese dialect). Geminga
is about 100 light years rimward from Sol. It is the relic of a star that
exploded some 370,000 years ago.

Interesting idea, Joe, and I know that you are a big roll player.

I\'m a little bit of both.  I think role playing is where it is at, 
but I also like good game mechanics.  Your idea may be a good 
marriage, but I\'m not sure if I would use it.

What you\'re trying to do is encourage roll playing by giving players 
a tangible reward with game mechanics.  The best system that I\'ve 
seen do this is in the second edition of AD&D.

In their experience point system for that edition, they allowed the 
DM leeway in the award of experience points from good ideas from the 
game session and good role play.

During my D&D campaign, my players and I delighted at the end of the 
night when it was time to award experience points.  It was a time to 
ponder the night\'s gaming and reward those for being creative--not 
only give them points for killing monsters, achieving adventure 
goals, or casting spells.  

The AD&D system had an impact on rewarding my players.  They got 
those extra 500 or so points after a game session that put their 
character that much closer to going up a level.  And, as you all 
know, when you go up a level in D&D, your character gets all kinds of 
benefit with the game mechanics--they can hit easier, they get more 
hit points, they get more abilities (spells, more attacks, etc.)

I\'ve always thought that the Traveller experience point system needed 
some work.  One of the enjoyable things about D&D is that you can 
actually grow a character.  That is much harder to do in Traveller.  
Most of the growth of a character is done in character generation, 
which I love, but I\'d like to see a better experience point system 
that would allow a Traveller character to grow.

The ones that I\'ve seen in the different incarnations of Traveller 
just don\'t cut it.  And, I think that this would also be a good place 
to reward characters for creative play and good role playing.

A vacuum is *not* a benign environment for anything designed to be in
an atmosphere. That includes the lifesystem of a ship. For just one
example, in a vacuum volatiles evaporate from plastics, making them
brittle. Fabrics don\'t do well either.

Actually, there are several fun possibilities here, especially if you
have a well stocked gaming library. After the weird effects of the
mistake clear, you are floating in space near a star. As you start
scanning for a nav fix, you get a signal (probably on several *odd*
frequencies at once):

1. "This is Captain _____ of the Federation Starship ________, hailing
    unidentified ship...." (Star Trek universe)
2. "Imperial Star Destroyer Invincible to unidentified ship. Prepare to
    be boarded..." (Star Wars universe)
3. "Babylon 5 to unidentified vessel...."
4. A repeating distress signal. It\'s coming from an ellipsoidal vessel
   10 *miles* long, 5 miles wide and about a mile thick (Metamorphosis:
   Alpha)
5. "Moonbase Alpha to unidentified vessel..." (Space:1999)
6. Morse code light flashes from an odd looking ship with a *propeller*....
   "HMS Intrepid to unknown vessel do you require assistance..."
   (Space:1889)
(I can\'t think of any other SF:RPGs that have a developed background)

But you don\'t paint or coat bearing surfaces, nor do you do it on

Actually, the other star is *not* necessarily a red giant! It can be a
fairly normal main sequence star.

> What, is the probability of occurence in such an association, and

The two stars have to be close enough that the "atmosphere" of the
normal star bleeds over onto the dwarf. Once they are close enough for
gas transfer to take place, you *will* get novas.

The mechanism is that the hydrogen accumulates on the surface of the
white dwarf until the pressure gets high enough to ignite a fusion
reaction. Then *boom*. Depending on how fast it accumulates and other
factors, you get everything from reccurrent "mild" novas to the
collapse of the entire white dwarf to neutron star densities (which
results in total destruction of the white dwarf and a supernova (Type
II?) explosion).

Planets are in pretty sad shape to start with, as forming a white dwarf
means there\'s been some rather nasty things happen in the system
already. Think of it as carpet bombing with nukes.

> BTW, can a novae occure more than one time?

Yep. A number of stars have been observed having multiple novas. 


> 2- Does a neutron star have a planetary system?

Neutron stars form from supernovas (Type I?). This will pretty much
destroy any existing planetary system. Even planets bigger than Jupiter
would evaporate under those conditions.

But recent discoveries show that some neutron stars have planetary
systems that had to have formed from the nebula left behind by the
supernova. These will be *very* strange place, and likely rather fatal
for a ship that jumps in.

> 3- With a presence of another star, to provide light, which would be the
> effect of a neutron star in a system (let\'s say this is a far binary
> system)? (Pulsar effect?)

The *strong* magnetic field, which will *not* be aligned with the
neutron star\'s rotation, will accelerate particles anywhere near it to
relativistic velocities, producing *lethal* radiation levels. Also, if
you are within the magnetic field, it\'ll induce *massive* currents in
your ship, quite likely melting or even vaporizing it. 

From farther out, the jets of accelerated particles ejected by the
neutron star will be quite dangerous. 

The gas densities in the system will be quite high. Collisions with
high speed dust and larger particles will be far more frequent than in
a normal system. And the radiation will be high, partly due to all the
radioisotopes created in the supernova and scattered thru the system.

But the Rule of Man didn\'t reach TL 14! So any TL 14 equipment in the CSC
(which I haven\'t seen yet) must be recently invented prototypes. Or, more
likely, inconsistencies.

Of course, if TL isn\'t "level of technological knowledge" but rather "the
ability to manufacture goods of that level in quantities large enough to 
make them common on that planet" then I suppose it would be possible for 
Sylea to be TL 12 and still manufacture some TL 14 items. But I\'d expect 
such items to be much more expensive than TL 14 items manufactured on a 
TL 14 world. Come to think of it, if TL 14 stuff can\'t be manufactured
locally, then working TL 14 relics ought to be VERY expensive -- does this 
agree with the price of those Vacc Suits and other stuff in CSC? If not, 
then they are definitely mistakes.

I\'d like to point out that Long Pig may or may not have been a taste treat
to the Old Vilani, but it cannot have been the foundation of the food
chain. Somewhere down the chain some person or beast has to chow down on
locally grown food. And if the "food Vilani" can survive on local produce
then there is no _necessity_ for anyone to survive on fellow Vilani, though
a small minority of them _could_ do so if they chose to. But Long pig would
either be reserved for a small elite or it would only be a Sunday treat.

OTOH, it is just the kind of urban legend that could easily arise. "You say
the Vilani can\'t eat the local food? What do they eat, then?" "I dunno.
Each other, maybe?" "Yeah, that makes sense!" :-)

        I\'d figure it was both; most human societies would begin by working
on the local foodstuffs: I mean, between barbequed Ross and a Big Mac, I\'d
have to think a while... and probably go for the Big Mac.  Ross would only
have to start to worry after several weeks of Big Mac.

        So I think that after the Ancients\' automatic pet feeders began to
break down or run out of food, the ancient Vilani would start experimenting
with local foodstuffs, losing a few people in the process, but probably
finding some that met _most_ of their dietary requirements.  Cannibalism
would, of course, occur _occasionally_ to fend off starvation.  Then, after
a while of eating dried pounded washed dried fermented dried Hoogaash root
exclusively, they\'d start supplementing certain mineral and protein
deficiencies in their diet with cannibalism (and possibly do so out of
sheer gastronomic boredom)...  If they preyed on outsiders and deviants,
this would drive a) expansion (see the Aztecs) and b) conformistic,
communalist tendencies (because if you\'re part of the group and follow the
rules, you\'re safe).  All this time, the Shugilli would have a certain
amount of interest in coming up with new local food sources, and
eventually, would reach a point where cannibalism was  unnecessary, and
continued only for taste.

        After the Vilani eventually reached a fair semblance of
civilization (say TL 3-4), I suspect that cannibalism would become less and
less frequent (like Xmas dinner), and victims would be reserved to
criminals and nonconformists.  This would of course continue the
conformist/communalist tendencies in their society.  Further social
progress, and contact with non-Vilani humans, would eventually cause the
practice to die out, although certain secret societies of wealthy, powerful
gourmets would likely continue to eat people on occasion indefinitely.

Given the "team environment" prevalent throughout Vilani culture, I\'d
lean toward the first explanation. After all, it\'s hard to be a team

Folks, the shareware at this site is impressive. There\'s a star system

I would guess that it was a matter of (1) efficiency and (2) sanitation, both
of which would be a little more urgent than revulsion.  I wouldn\'t rule out
major cultural/religious changes, of course, but:

(1)  Humans breed slowly and grow in size slowly, *and* have to be fed on other
     humans.  I have no idea how to check this, but my guess would be that a
     society depending purely on cannibalism for nutrition wouldn\'t be
     sustainable for very long.  Some vegetarians rail against the
     inefficiency of, say, the beef industry, because of how much grain it
     takes to produce a pound of beef.  Imagine if beef cattle, first, had to
     be fed on other beef cattle, second, had a gestation period of 9 months,
     and, third, didn\'t attain mature muscle development for 18 years...

(2)  When your meat animals can pass on any diseases or parasites they carry to
     you, you have a serious public health problem.  We don\'t really have to
     deal with this in our society much, with a few notable exceptions, such
     as pork and trichinosis, mad cow disease (maybe), and so on.  If we were
     eating humans, we would be able to catch *everything* they had.  Some
     tribes in New Guinea practice(d? officially anyway) ritual ancestor
     cannibalism; they wound up giving themselves slow viruses by eating
     their ancestors\' brains.  (Do a Web search on "kuru".)  Especially where
     something like a slow virus -- Kuru, Creutzfeldt-Jacob -- is concerned,
     simply "cooking until the pink is gone" is not sufficient.


If the Vilani wanted to stay cannibals for long, they would have to find some
way to overcome the first problem and mitigate the effects of the second.

In theory, I can agree with you.  I like the idea of a character 
growing and gaining more skills. However, the D&D tendency towards 
building walking indestructable tanks is something to be avoided in 
Traveller, IMO.  I don\'t want to end up with a character with level 6 
everything and able to do anything he/she sets his/her mind to.
  
I\'m not sure what would constitute a happy medium, but you might try 
just being a bit more generous with the points awarded in the T4 
system, and, maybe, extend what skills you allow the points to be 
used  to try to improve.  Allen Shock is generous with his game 
points, he awards them after every session (not adventure) and it 
seems to be working well, if a bit more generous than I would be.

I agree the Vilani probably had more that their share of forbidden
fruits in the past, and maybe even present among some well established
families who have aquired the "taste."  

The food chain does preclude human munchies as the only form of food. 
Big investement in edible resources raising humans.  However, a Soylent
Green scenario may be something to look at.

Perhaps this was one of the reasons the Terrans didn\'t like the Vilani
so well on first contact-they had them over for a feast:)

	You just hit upon the most ticklish part of gm\'ing

don\'t apply a set DM for this sort of thing.  It really depends on what
the action has to do with the plot direction; I roll the dice and if it\'s
\'close enough\' which is an ifinitely variable number depending on
circumstances, I may figure that they got \'close enough\' for the task to
succeed. If not, there\'s another variable region in the die roll that they
fail, but while failing see what\'s really wrong and can try again.

	OTOH, I NEVER penalize people for saying \'I fix it\'...not everyone can

start picking it up when they play with others who do; so I\'ll never
penalize them for that.

Yes you do!  I just thought of this now, but we have a <current> tech
version of this that could be very valulable!

There\'s a lot of research going on now (and not a little commercial
development) over putting diamond coatings on things by \'spraying\'
monoatomic carbon onto surfaces in high vacuum...the carbon crystallizes
out onto the surface in it\'s cubic diamond form. Very hard, very wear
resistant, and, I suspect, very, VERY resistant to vaccum welding, because
IIRC the sticky \'ends\' of the carbon atoms on the outside are exposed to
hydrogen at the last of the process, making inert carbides.

I remember this because one of the practical applications, which is either
available now or \'real soon now\' is coating eyeglass lenses with the stuff
to make them extremely scratch resistant. This is something I need ;-)

A Vargr in my game could identify branches of Humaniti by taste. IIRC, 
Zhodani were slightly spicy, Solomani were salty, and Vilani were a bit 
tasteless.

ISTR that there\'s a minimum rank you need before you can apply to the SAS (and 
presumably SBS). Corporal, I think. The entrance tests are also *very* tough.

Have you noticed that, apart from the title, it doesn\'t mention Traveller on 
the cover at all? It just says \'Science Fiction\'. Plus, there\'s no date, price, 
ISSN, or barcode.

Psionic monsters (oops, spoiler!) are a bit of a cliche now.

Agreed.

Plus cloaking devices and tractor beams. This isn\'t Traveller.

Traveller fiction is pretty rare; I\'d like to see one story (but no more) per

Neither. The local food provided enough bulk, you just ate your neighbour to prevent 
vitamin deficiencies. The Vilani probably turned to cannibalism to survive and the clever 
people (who continued to experiment on local food) eventually weaned them off other 
people as they figured out how to turn inedible fibre into edible food.

BTW, I treat Vilani food as very high in fibre (explains the long lifespan, don\'t it?)
and tasting baguely of formaldehyde

I\'ve looked over the errata on Imperium Game\'s website and I haven\'t seen
the following points posted there.

First off, on page 25 of the T4 rulebook: Merchant Captain "full of bugs"
Jamison, it states on mustering out that Jamison receives a mid-passage?. 
Looking on the Merchant career table on page 31 there is no entry of
mid-passage in the benefits table.  There is however two entries for
low-passage, should the last entry at *6. Low passage* be replaced with
*mid-passage* (I\'m sure a merchant could scrounge a mid-passage ticket as a
benefit).

Secondly, there seems no way for Marines to recruit officers from OTC or the
Military academy?.  The enties for these establishments only specify the
Army .  I presume that Traveller marines are based after American Marines,
and as I\'m British I haven\'t a clue on the workings of American armed
forces.  Are Marines Officers only taken from enlisted ranks?.

I apologise if this has already been covered before.  Can anyone tell me
where a fuller version of the errata can be found?.

Cheers,

Jason

peasantry got by primarily on millet, with some vegetables  for needed
vitamins and meat once in a *long* while.  Perhaps meat was reserved for the
warrior caste, mostly.

Though that could be a sustainable diet, the peasants would be undernourished
- -- hence small and weak.  The reproductive rate would be down, because
undernourished women become fertile at a higher age (18th C. Sweden = 19 years
old, for example) and less of their children survive.

Such a society would be at a distinct disadvantage against one with better-fed
people.  The _shugilii_-equipped society would be able to produce more food,
would have stronger and larger warriors, and would have a *substantially*
higher birthrate.  It would wipe the "protein cannibals" out pretty fast.

In the US, Marine Officers come from three places:  The United States Naval
Academy, Marine Reserve Officer Traing Corps at universities around the
country, and from within the Corps.

Ask any grunt who the best officers are, and they\'ll always pick the
"mustangs" over the "trade school" lieutenants.

I beleive that this was the intention in Traveller.  you can\'t lead Marines
until you\'ve proved yourself a Marine.  Perhaps officers are selected out of
Initial Training, or after 2 years of service...  I\'m currently working on a
history and TO&E for the Imperial Navy Ground Force, so watch this space!

The table for the Merchant career is correct (since it was taken directly 
from The Traveller Book, and TTB\'s Merchant benefits table agrees with 
what is in T4), I would assume.  Rather, it appears the chargen sequence 
on p 25 is incorrect. 

That\'s my take on it anyway.

The one on the web site is quite extensive, and it was actually compiled 
by a TML member (David Joseph Smart) based on submissions by other 
TMLers.  Naturally, that process may have missed a few items.  I believe 
if you send a note to webmaster@imperiumgames.com, David Bullock will add 
errata items to the list.  We can all do our part to make the next 
printing of T4 error-free! :)  (BTW, I\'m CC-ing David Bullock on this 
message so he\'ll know about the error you spotted.)

No, it\'s not. However, it *is* Megatraveller and TNE. Both had tractor
beams and repulsors and both had rules for using black globes as a form
of cloaking device.

        Yup, I agree.  If it was the foundation of the food chain, there
would have been no Ziru Sirkaa.  The local flora and fauna on Vland had to
have been capable of providing a diet that provided (at least minimally)
the nutrients needed to sustain human life.  However, if the dietary
advantages of cannibalism were such that Cannibilani were bigger, stronger,
longer-lived, and healthier than Vegevilani, Cannibilani would have a
serious advantage.  Where you get one group that\'s chronically mal or
under-nourished and one that isn\'t, the well-nourished group should do
better in the long term.  I\'m not saying that Vilani were _exclusively_
cannibals; just that they probably ate other Vilani from time to time in
order to fully round out their diet.

        Absolutely.  However, we know that no human disease organisms
existed on Vland; the Ancients probably thoroughly disinfected their pets
before importing them to Vland.  Thus, the long Vilani lifespan and the
Plague of Duskir.  So this does not preclude cannibalism.

Actually, bearing surfaces contain a coating of grease.  It\'s
just easier to do it that way than to create a lubricating
coating that won\'t wear off.  As to pressure seals, they
certainly can be coated.

Atually the Vilani could not have relied on cannibalism to survive
more than a short time (months? and it is not clear that any records
would even survive from this time to carry on the legend).
A society running on cannibalism is like a person eating
themselves to live.  Someone someplace has to be able to eat
local flora/fauna or the whole thing colapses (and fairly
quickly).  At that point, the Vilani have no more reason to
rely on cannibalism than Terrans do.

=46usion Rocket -  Produces power. Cannot be used close to worlds and
shipping lanes due to radiation. High IR signature.
Thruster plates - Uses little power. No reaction mass. Limited to
proximity to gravity wells of stars and planets. No exhaust to disrupt
planetary atmospheres or nearby objects in docking. Low IR signature.

When we had MT I always wondered why there was thugs to haul larger
starships. But now it makes sense. Would you like to have a 30,000 ton
ship accelerating or maneuvering close to your spacestation if it went
on reaction mass. Much simpler to get a few thugs to maneuver the
starship to its docking position.

The Thruster plates also makes great aerospace fighters as they do not
have to rely on reactionmass to escape the gravity well. Their mission
endurance is extended. And they do not give off too much IR signature
either.

Works well with busy starports as well. Instead of having heavy
freighters with reaction mass drives landing. A few large shuttles
with thruster plates can do the job of freighting the cargo up and
down from the ship. And the starports do not need extremely large
areas for starships to land.

So I don\'t find it strange to have several types of maneuver drives
for the starship construction.

Sure they do-the Vilani didn\'t need to worry about eating their own
society.  They ate the ones they conquered when they were barbarilani. 

You don\'t think they were a "we\'ve grown beyond such barbarous things"
Deanna Troi Star Trek people who would never harm a fly, do you?  I
think they\'ve got a NASTY little secret in their closet. ...NASTY...

Good catch, Jason! This was indeed one we all missed; it\'s been added
to my personal master copy of the errata. I believe someone else was

             A REVISED TASK/SKILL/CHARACTER GEN SYSTEM
                    for MARK MILLER\'S TRAVELLER
                    
                    
Problems I see with the current system:
                    
1.  Impossible tasks aren\'t all that impossible for competent
    characters, and are fairly easy for exceptionally competent
    ones.  This might not be a major problem if the GM insists on
    several small tasks to accomplish a goal, rather than on one
    major task, especially when the Multiple Task rules are applied.
    However, simplicity sake, GM\'s often specify a single Impossible
    task rather than 3 or 4 Formidable tasks.
    
2.  Attributes (STR, INT, DEX, etc) play too important a part in
    determining a character\'s asset level for a skill.  With the
    average Attribute level of 7, the Attribute contributes:  88% of
    an 8 Target Number (Skill 1); 78% at Skill 2; 70% at Skill 3;
    and 64% at Skill 4.  Higher Attribute levels compound the
    problem, Attribute 10:  91% at Skill 1; 83% at Skill 2; 77% at
    Skill 3; and 71% at Skill 4.  Training, ie Skills, should play a
    larger role in determining a character\'s Asset Level.
    
3.  All characters learn every skill equally well.  This is
    unreasonable, as people certainly have varying aptitudes for
    each skill:  some people will pick up a skill very easily, some
    will find a skill extremely difficult to master, and most will
    be about average.  A character should have a specific *aptitude*
    for each skill they learn that determines how easily they can
    learn that skill.
        
4.  All increases in skill are in fixed steps.  No matter how apt a
    character is, there will be times when she learns more than
    normal and times she learns less.  Each increase in skill should
    have a random component that reflects the variability in a
    character\'s ability to learn, reflecting changes in the
    environmental, personal, and professional conditions affecting
    the character.
    
My proposed solutions:

1.  A. Increase the number of dice rolled for each difficulty level,
       and remove the .5d from the standard levels.

    B. Change the number and descriptions for the task levels.  I
       propose that there be 6 difficulty levels:
    
    Automatic (1d6) -   only unskilled characters need worry about
                        these tasks.
    
    Simple (2d6) -  unskilled characters will find these difficult,
                    PCs with some skill will find them easy to
                    trivial.
    
    Average (3d6) - unskilled PCs will find these almost impossible,
                    PCs with some skill will find them challenging,
                    and PC\'s with high skill levels will find them
                    easy.
    
    Difficult (4d6) - unskilled PCs will almost always fail, PC;s
                      with some skill will have problems, highly
                      competent PCs will still find them easy.
    
    Formidable (5d6) - these are challenging tasks for even
                       competent PCs, where they will often fail.
    
    Impossible (6d6) - only exceptionally competent PCs will have a
                       good chance with these tasks, for most PCs an
                       attempt at an Impossible task is an act of
                       desperation.
                       
    C. Tasks of difficult *between* the listed levels are modified
       by the addition of a 1d3.  Ex:  Very Formidable (5.5d); Above
       Average (3.5d); Very Simple (1.5d).
                           
2.  Increase the number of points that Skills contribute to the
    Asset Level (or Target Number).  On average, each increase in
    Skill will contribute 2 points to the Asset Level, but that is
    only the average. The actual number can vary from 0 to 4.
    
3.  Include a new Aptitude factor to the game.  When a PC acquires a
    new skill (or uses a default skill for the first time) they will
    determine their aptitude for that skill with the following
    ranks: 
    
    Low Aptitude (-1) - finds this skill naturally difficult, will
                        have trouble advancing in this area
                        
    Average Aptitude (0) - like most people this skill is of average
                           difficulty for this PC, will advance
                           normally in this area
                           
    High Aptitude (+1) - finds this skill naturally easy, will
                         advance quickly in this area
                         
    To determine Aptitude
    
    Option 1:  [Equal chances] Roll 1d3-2 (-1 to 1)
    
    Option 2:  [Weighted to Average/Low, realistic]
               Roll 2d3 (2 to 6) and consult Table
    
                           Roll   Aptitude
                           =================
                             2   Low (-1)
                             3   Low (-1)
                             4   Average (0)
                             5   Average (0)
                             6   High (+1)

    Option 3:  [Weighted for Exceptional Characters, cinematic] 
               Roll 2d3-3 (-1 to 3)
               
               An Aptitude of 2 makes an Exceptional Character, and
               one of 3 makes one of Legendary proportions.
               
    Option 4:  Use method 1 or 2, but allow a player to increase
               their aptitude for a limited number of skills by 1.
               I suggest the number of skills that can be increased
               be limited to no more than 6.  This allows for *some*
               tailoring of the PCs skills.
               
4.  Each time a Skill increases during Character Generation the
    player will:
    
    A.  Roll a 1d3
    B.  Add that Skill\'s Aptitude to the roll
    C.  Add the total to the Skill\'s current level
    

Example 1: Sol is learning Streetwise for the first time.

    1.  Determine Aptitude (1d3-2), Sol Rolls 1, and subtracts 2.
        His Aptitude is -1, or Low, he will have trouble learning
        Streetwise.  Sol writes Streetwise (-1) on his Character
        Sheet.
        
    2.  Learn the skill (1d3)+Aptitude, Sol Rolls 3, adds -1, giving
        him 2, he learned a lot this term.  He then adds 2 to his
        Streetwise total:  Streetwise (-1) _2_.
        
    3.  Later Sol increases his Streetwise Skill.
        A. Rolls 1d3+Aptitude, 2 + (-1) = 1, he didn\'t learn as much
           this term.
        B. Adds 1 to his total of 2, giving him Streetwise (-1) _3_.
        
    4.  Again Sol learns Streetwise.        
        A. Rolls 1d3 and gets 1.  1 - 1 = 0.  Sol learned *nothing*
           this time, no matter how hard he tried.
        B. Adds 0 to his total of 3 and Streetwise remains 3.
        
Example 2: Min is learning Gravitics this term for the first time.

    1.  Min rolls for her Aptitude (Option 2) and rolls a 5,
        consulting the table she she\'s that she is Average (0).  She
        writes Gravitics (0) on her Character Sheet.  Now Min rolls
        for her skill increase, 1d3=3, adds her Aptitude (0), and
        enters Gravitics (0) _3_ on her Character Sheet.

    2.  Min learns more Gravtics, rolls 1d3=1, adds her Aptitude
        (0).  She reflects that she didn\'t learn much this term, as
        she adds 1 to her total of 3 giving her Gravitics (0) _4_.
        
Comments:

If you use any of these rules, you should use them all.  The
increase in difficulty levels is *too* steep if you don\'t also
increase the number of skill points.  Increasing the number of skill
points without increasing the difficulty levels just makes the
current problems worse.  Simply mandating an increase of 2 for each
skill increase approximates the changes introduced by using all the
above rules, but leads to more boring characters.

These rules make unskilled (and low skilled) PCs less capable.  This
doesn\'t bother me, because IMO unskilled characters *should* have
problems.

Players occasionally will "load up" on certain Attributes that are
used most often in certain classes of tasks.  Frankly, I don\'t like
this kind of minmaxing, and apply the following rule to combat it.
Instead of having a specific Attribute attached to each skill, I
choose an appropriate Attribute for each use of the skill.
Gravitics usually uses EDU or INT, but under my system I might use
DEX (fine tuning a part), STR (pulling a stuck gravitor loose), or
CON (you\'ve been up for 40 straight hours and are exhausted)
instead.

If you use these rules, it\'s best to use a fairly random method of
choosing skills.  A minmax\'er can concentrate on a few skills and
produce PCs with exceptionally high Target Numbers...of course they can
do that with the original rules too.

[Notice how many times INT and EDU are called as the Controlling

target numbers Min *actually* uses.]

I\'m sure you\'ll hear from other, but the short answer is no, all Marine
Officers do not come from the enlisted ranks. Marine Officers in the USMC
come from several sources. Some are graduates of the Naval Academy. A few
are graduates of West Point (Army Academy). Many come through Officer\'s
Training Schools.  Of the ones coming through OTS, some are from the ranks
but most are from entering from colleges and universities.

On first thought, I thought I\'d have to disagree on this one. Case in
point is a comparison of the knowledge maintained in the Library of
Alexandria versus the level of knowledge during the so-called Dark
Ages. The Library is reputed to have had references to theories on
lasers as well as modern astronomy (the earth orbits the sun, etc.),
surgical techniques which make the doctors of the US Civil War look
like butchers, the formula for Greek fire (we *still* don\'t know the
exact ingredients), even atomic particles (well, actually an
unsubstantiated hypothesis).

On second thought, though, I pulled out my handy dandy Hard Times and
realized that the time between the 2nd and 3rd Imperiums wouldn\'t, in
most cases, be near as harsh. Sure you\'d have some worlds become
boneyards or revert to barbarism but given the time frame involved I
don\'t believe it would be nearly as bad as the future (?) Civil War.

By the time the Dark Ages rolled around,

As I understand it, InterNIC messed up the IP routing or something like 
that.  (Yeah, you can tell how web savvy I am[G].)

David Bullock sent out a msg earlier today about it, but it was only to 
subscribers to the web newsletter, and I\'m afraid I deleted that msg. 
(BTW, it\'s highly recommended that everyone subscribe to that web 
newsletter; there\'s a place on the web site to do so - which don\'t help a 
whole lot right now[G].)

At any rate, the site should be available again by Monday afternoon (US) at 
the latest, according to David.

>                    for MARK MILLER\'S TRAVELLER

While I, personally don\'t have a problem with attributes playing a major
role in determining success, I do dislike 0.5-die rolls and the term
"Impossible" for tasks that are actually quite simple for a highly-skilled
character. I do like your new task levels and descriptions, and can even
put up with the reduced importance of attributes. I also agree with the
suggestion of choosing an attribute appropriate for the use of a skill; but
doesn\'t the task system already say to do this on page 49?

It is not true that "all characters learn equally well" and "all increases
in skill are in fixed steps". Since you are rolling dice for skill
increases and you get several rolls each term, characters can learn
different numbers of skills at different rates in the same time.

I dislike the notion of an "Aptitude factor". I just don\'t see the added
overhead of a new attribute for every skill in the game contributing to the
enjoyment of playing. Real aptitudes tend to fall into categories like
"intuitive", "sensing", "aural", "mechanical", depending on which
educational psychologists you believe. I think it is very unlikely every
skill has a different aptitude. In fact, I believe the current method of
basing similar skills on the same attribute handles this problem much more
simply and realistically. The system already provides independent ranges of
skills and you can handle minimaxing by requiring players to roll randomly
for at least part of their attributes.

Also, as a player it would really bug me if, after a year of training, I
rolled a skill increase of 1 which an aptitude reduced to zero. What if I
have a level-0 skill and an aptitude of -1? Am I allowed to roll against
the skill? What if I learned a skill by reading a textbook versus having a
tutor? Do I also add literary versus conversational aptitudes? Can I train
aptitudes? Can I increase them through experience? Do non-humans have the
same aptitudes as humans?

And after all this work the chance of succeeding in a task is still mostly
based on attributes, you\'re just calling a portion of the attributes
"aptitude". I appreciate the effort and thought you put into the
suggestion, Eris, but I really feel you\'re putting a lot of work into
making a cumbersome fix for something that isn\'t broken.

shouldn\'t one of those "outgoing"s be an "incoming"? Shouldn\'t it depend on
the shape of the surface; it\'s much easier to punch out of an arch than

But the Rule of Man didn\'t reach TL 14! So any TL 14 equipment in the CSC
(which I haven\'t seen yet) must be recently invented prototypes. Or, more
likely, inconsistencies.

(Phil replies: So? According to CSC is *did* -- but only in some areas.
Forex, it never achieved Cold Fusion/Fusion Plus *at all*. I refer you to
the description of the EVA-14, page 16, for details).

Of course, if TL isn\'t "level of technological knowledge" but rather "the
ability to manufacture goods of that level in quantities large enough to 
make them common on that planet" then I suppose it would be possible for 
Sylea to be TL 12 and still manufacture some TL 14 items. But I\'d expect 
such items to be much more expensive than TL 14 items manufactured on a 
TL 14 world. Come to think of it, if TL 14 stuff can\'t be manufactured
locally, then working TL 14 relics ought to be VERY expensive -- does this 
agree with the price of those Vacc Suits and other stuff in CSC? If not, 
then they are definitely mistakes.

(Phil Replies some more: Well, its like this. Like I\'ve said all along, TLs
are *MEANINGLESS*. The Third Imperium is TL12, but has Cold Fusion/Fusion +
which the RoM never did, and it was TL12 {IIRC} from previous sources, too
- - and now we\'re told its TL13). Look, the whole TL thingy just doesn\'t
work, and *CANNOT* be made to work in the format it is in.)

   I\'ve seen the same previews.  Looks an awful lot like "Space: Above

I\'ll love this too--but I can already see that the troopers don\'t look
like what Heinlein described in the novel.

Not in the US. In fact, most of the US officer corps (<80%, according to
DOD data in 1987) are ROTC Commissions. Here, the marines come from NOTC or
USNA (acadamy) programs. Most of the "fromer enlisted" officers served 1
term, went to college, and went ROTC, according to DOD. (Was a high-scool
cadet... got lots of data of useless military BS.) US Marines have Highest
OCS enrolment numbers...

But when hashed out 3mo ago, I don\'t recall a real answer from IG/AP/SPA/MM
for the Imperial Marines...

Oh, I agree here as well.  I think that the perfect system, with 
constant gaming, would provide one, maybe two, chances to go up 
during a game year.  And, I think that the top end could be topped 
out similiar to how it is now done in the T4 main book--you make it 
harder and harder to go up a level.  

It is relatively easy at the low levels (but not too easy--you don\'t 
want to have a character with 40 level one skills either).  Then it 
becomes progressively harder to increase, say, from a 3 to 4, or even 
harder to increase from a 4 to 5.

The character may get one or two chances during the game year to go 
up, but if the skill is already pretty high, then it might take him 
one, two, three, or more games years to actually move it up because 
the throw is a hard one to make (over that period of time, he gets 
one or two throws a year until his level 4 skill achieves level 5).

No, I like awarding every session, but I want the points given to be 
less powerful.

Hmm.  I\'m going to have to think about this and come up with a good 
system.

I\'m making this my new project.

Attributes should play a major role in determining success.  They should
not play the overwhelming role they currently play, IMO. That\'s why I\'m
trying to reduce their influence, especially for characters with lots of
training.

> I do dislike 0.5-die rolls 

Can\'t say I much like them either.  Several folks and I have been kicking
around that subject for months.  ;-> I can see a use for them as "tweener"
difficulty levels, though...I can\'t remember who first proposed using the
1d3\'s in that role, but it was early last fall.

A lot of people have a problem with that.  Frankly, an exceptional
character should be able to "do the impossible" in a game, but we\'ve got a
situation where above average characters are exceptional and exceptional
ones are supermen.

Yes, that is an option buried in the text on page 49.  However, I suspect
that was included as something to be used on occasional rather than all the
time.

We disagree here.  You don\'t roll dice for the *number* of skill increases,
or for how much you learn from any one increase.  You roll to pick out a
skill that will be increased, and that increase *is* a fixed amount.

For example, if your character and my character both receive Gun Cbt this
term, we both get 1 point.  You never get no points or 2 points for
receiving that skill.  You never get a different number of points than do
I. 

During a term you get 4 skill rolls, and I get 4 skill rolls.  I\'ll come
out with a 4 point increase in skills (or attributes), and you will
too...except for the strange -1\'s in some of the tables.  <g> Even if we
learn different skills our increases will be in lockstep with each other,
and that\'s not reasonable.  Well, it\'s not what I *want* anyway. <g> 

> I dislike the notion of an "Aptitude factor". I just don\'t see the added

Again we disagree.  Did you try rolling up a character using the Aptitudes? 
I think you\'d find there is very little added overhead.  There is an
additional roll and a notation on the Character Sheet when the skill is
first used/learned, and each time a skill is re-learned a 1d3 is rolled for
the actual amount of increase.

In fact, I find rolling the Aptitude is an exciting step.
"Piloting!  Oh man, I hope I roll High Aptitude on this one."  This method
also makes each skill increase more exciting, the increase varies on the
roll and the Aptitude so there is a question, "Will I get a 3 point or a 0
point increase this time?"  I see this as a feature, not overhead.

> Real aptitudes tend to fall into categories like "intuitive",

<grin> You must not have been around when I was posting about
Aptitudes last fall.  I agree with you and would actually prefer to have a
set of 6 to 8 true Aptitudes as controls on the skills. However, that would
demand a major rewrite of the rules.  

What I\'m presenting here is a compromise that doesn\'t require *much* change
in the T4 system.  The Aptitudes I\'m proposing are total abstractions. 
They *represent* things like mechanical, charismatic, scientific, and
combativeness without actually expressing the actual aptitudes.

Sorry, I can\'t agree.  Right now the Attribute doesn\'t modify the Skill at
all.  All it does is add to the Skill and dominate the Target Number. 
There\'s nothing in the current system to handle a PC who\'s a "whiz" at some
skill but a "dunce" at another...even though both share the same
controlling Attribute.  And if you don\'t use the default Attribute, then
even that tenious linkage is broken.

> Also, as a player it would really bug me if, after a year of training, I
> rolled a skill increase of 1 which an aptitude reduced to zero. 

Yeah, it would bug me too!  <G> That\'s not an argument against it though.  

I don\'t know about you, but on rare occasions I\'ve spent *many* hours on
something...sweated blood...and come out as clueless as when I started. 
I\'ve also known people that spent a years in some job, supposedly
increasing some skills, with no visible results.  I had a boss one time
that always talked about the people whose career could be described as,
"One year of experience, twenty times."  As far as a game explanation for a
0 increase, well the PC could have been ill, distracted by other tasks,
just *didn\'t* get it, or simply goofed off.

> What if I have a level-0 skill and an aptitude of -1?  Am I
> allowed to roll against the skill?

Yes. On level-0 (default) skills you use 1/2 the appropriate
Attribute + the Aptitude...in this case -1.  If you\'re a charitable GM you
might let the PC use the full Attribute+Aptitude if you go to full dice
(Average being 3d6).  The -1 is the numeric indication that the PC has a
Low Aptitude in that skill.  Low doesn\'t mean NO, just less than the
average.

> Can I train aptitudes?  Can I increase them through experience? 

No. Some changes might be possible in *real life*, but with 3
discrete levels in the game I don\'t think allowing increase would work.  So
Aptitudes aren\'t normally increased or decreased.  I suppose a GM could
declare that some psychological event altered a PC\'s Aptitudes...a PC
recovering from brain damage perhaps.  In that case the PC might discover
that while once he loved Mathematics and Astrogation now he can\'t hack
them, and totally against past experience is more suited for combat.

> Do non-humans have the same aptitudes as humans?

Remember with this system the actual Aptitudes are totally
abstracted.  Non-humans would have their own set of real
psychological aptitudes.  Whatever they are they would still map,
abstractly, to the Low, Average, High scale as represented by the skill.  I
agree that non-humans might well *average* differently than humans, but
that\'s something that could be worked out with DM\'s in Alien Character
Generation.

> And after all this work the chance of succeeding in a task is still
> mostly based on attributes, you\'re just calling a portion of the
> attributes "aptitude". 

The Aptitude modifies the Skill, and the Skill actually earned is a die
roll.  You can call the Aptitude an attribute if you want, but it\'s not the
same kind of Attribute as those in T4.  It is directly linked to the skill,
and only that skill, and so it makes more sense to refer to it as part of
the Skill.

Attributes (T4 Attributes) still play a large part in Task
Resolution, just a smaller part.  The portion of the Task Number coming
from the Skill typically becomes the majority of the total at a Skill-3 or
4 level.  My preference would be to reduce the Attribute portion more, or
increase the Skill portion more rapidly, but that causes problems with
Tasks at either end of the difficult levels. If everybody was willing to
accept Impossible tasks being as easy as they are now, I\'d push the Skill
component up faster.

So we disagree, that\'s why they have horse races.  <g> What you see as
cumbersome, I see as an easy and fun addition.  What you see as unbroken, I
see as badly in need of a fix.

Thanks for looking my ideas over anyway.

I hate to say this, but you\'ll notice they waited until after Bob Heinlein
died to make Troopers into a movie.  I don\'t think he\'d have let them do
what I\'m afraid they are going to do to "Starship Troopers."  <sigh>  I\'ll

Great idea, Andrew, but I wonder if it holds water? I would think that the
taste of two members of the same species would depend a lot more on their
individual diet than on their race.

Yes, you\'ve said it before, but that dosen\'t make it true. TLs aren\'t

tad confusing.

But Fusion+ is an example of the difference between knowledge and application.
The RoM could have built Fusion+ if they had happened to invent it, but they
didn\'t, so they couldn\'t. That dosen\'t mean they didn\'t have other TL 12
technologies. The capacitors needed to use drop tanks is another such example. 
According to High Guard you can build drop tanks at TL 9, but those capacitors
weren\'t invented until late in the 11th Century, nearly 300 years after the 
Imperium reached TL 15.

Leaving that to a side, if the TL 14 stuff is sold at normal TL 14 prices
then they cannot be RoM relics. They must either be locally manufactured
or be an inconsistency. Personally I wouldn\'t make them available for my
players (If I was running a Milieu 0 campaign).

Hi Paul,

IIRC, didn\'t they only say they\'d sign the ones that were ordered before 
a certain date?  July 1 or something like that?

The people who are doing the border wars are at the very edge of the old
empire and have not really been in contact with the Sylea people yet (as of
0). By 200, Sylea has expanded its contacts to put it in the thich of the

Before July 1st, as I recall.  I remember because my check bounced and I
made frantic calls to Lake Geneva begging them to give me another chance.

Hmmm...
I think I\'ve mentioned it before, but I really wanna know, which sectors
and subsectors Sylea discovered and WHEN. So everybody playing any
milieu in any year knows, where the edges of "known space" are.
The list could have a format like

imp-date / sector / subsectors
0	core	A-P
....

The date says WHEN the sector/subsector has been discovered/included
into the imperium.

Any better suggestions?

Timelines provide some help, but not detailed enough for me (yes,
sometimes I can be a pain in the a** :).

T4 has the rules on page 56.  My prefered system is to have all the PCs
declare who many rounds are going into the beaten zone, and then when
someone enters that zone, throw dg equal to half the rounds expended.  Every
"1" is a hit.  Tends to shread the first guy, and simulates the natural
tendancy to shift and aim at the first target you see.

   The movie shares the same name as the book, as do some of the characters.
That\'s about it.  No powered infantry armor (too expensive, money needed to
pay Verhoven\'s salary), just a bug hunt.
   Probably a decent bughunt, but don\'t expect any of the book\'s prose to
make it into the script.

        Some folks think that attributes have too much effect on the target
number. Leaving aside for the moment my basic disagreement with this
concept, I see an easy solution: DOUBLE the skill levels. TNE basically did
this, and it seemed to work ok. A level 10 would then be as good as a level
5 is now. The task system might then look like this:

Easy: 2D
Average: 3D
Difficult 3.5D
Formidable 4D
Staggering: 5D
Impossible: 6D

A character with a stat of 7 and what used to be skill 3 would then have a
(7+6)= 13 target number. Admittedly, I\'m no math major, and this idea does
retain the 1/2 die (which doesn\'t bother me), and it also eliminates 2D6 as
the roll for average tasks. 2d was originally chosen because it was the
"standard" roll in CT. I do not think that is a good enough reason to keep it.

Another idea:

easy: 1d if level 0, auto if level 1+
average: 2D
Difficult 3D
Formidable: 4D
Staggering: 5D
Impossible: 6D

Keep the levels the same, just use the above chart. This has been suggested
before, many times I beleive. It also eliminates the dreaded half-die.

Again, I think that it\'s a question of TL representing AVERAGE TL across
many different types of technology - looking at Solomani & S&A, the Terrans,
when founding the ROM had jump-3, but no fusion+. They had more advanced
genetic engineering technology than most of the 3rd Imperium in the 1100s,
but they probably didn\'t have nuclear dampers. They had meson guns, but
probably didn\'t have very advanced gravitics. (I\'d bet that the Terrans,
like a lot of other \'minor\' races bought gravitic technology from the
Vilani and quickly came up with a story about how they had _just_ discovered
it back on the home world...)

Tech levels are obviously simplifications. So are all the Traveller skills,
attributes, cargo prices, world UPPs, etc, etc, etc. I mean, do you
seriously think that just because some character had computer-4 they have
an equal chance of success at any task involving a computer?? Of that
engineering lets you work on any kind of jump drive that has been manufactured
on one of several dozen planets with vastly different technological
infrastructures?

If you want more detail, do what the MT World Builder\'s Handbook does - break 
TLs down into smaller technological fields - Medical TL, Energy TL,
Weaponry TL, Space tech TL, Computer TL, Fork TL, Knife TL, Spoon TL...

Anyways, using a simplified TL rating is no more broken than using
character and planetary UPPs.

BTW i like this list, some of it is way to Techie for my use but
interesting all the same, I agree with the Task system, it does need some
sort of modification, I personally took Andy Lilly\'s sugestion to me at
Euro Gencon and split the task down into subtask\'s but as pointed out
sometimes this is not possible, and you need an alternative method.

I\'ve noticed that we seem to have an awfull lot of Scientist type people on
the list (bods working for NASA/Observatories and such like judging by
comments and mail addresses), i\'m just wondering if all this Science
Fiction will become Science Fact, in the same way that Jeules Verne has
with 2000 leagues and journey to the moon (if i got the titles wrong, i\'m
sorry it\'s been a long time since i read them) - they sparked people\'s
tinkering tendencies. (apaloggies for the spilling but i don\'t trust my
spill chequer, it wants to make Techies into Tetchiest, Colin into Colon
etc.) I use Eudora 3.0 but i\'m not sure if its an internal Spell checker or
external, (although looking at Options i would say internal), However it is
<insert Expletive> annoying.

Sorry if my comments on Weekend stuff are so out of date, but i only pick
the digest up on a Monday morning and it takes till luchtime just to read
the mail, i do skip most of the reposted bits having been reminded what the
post was originally about.

On SAS entry, as far as i know and having read books like Bravo 2 Zero
there is no minimum rank qualification, just an extremly tuff entry program
as i say according to the books it\'s two years training and about 97
percent dropout, that\'s why there is only one SAS Regular regiment with
between 500-1000 people split between i think 3 companies and then there is
also a Territorial Army (TA) SAS Regiment which does a lot of training with
the Reg SAS, for those of you who don\'t know what TA is, Regular Soldiers
normally refer to them as SASS (saturday and sunday soldiers), they are
civilians who play at being soldiers at the weekends and one fortnight a
year, I\'m probably beeing hard on them, but most of the TA i worked with on
exercise\'s in germany were as much use as a chocolate firegaurd, however,
over here they, along with Ex servicepersons who are on the short term
reserve list (i.e. under 30), are the first to be called up in case of war,
and ex servicepersons on the long term list (30-45), i.e. me and thousands
of others are second. If i remember right the TA SAS is another company of
the Reg SAS (D i think), anyway for interesting reading on SAS, i would
recommend the following \'BRAVO TWO ZERO - Andy McNabb\' and \'The One that
Got Away - sorry can\'t remember the author\' both about the same gulf war
mission, but different view points, i recommend both for a rounded insight,
and the other is \'The Nemesis File\' again can\'t remember the Author, but
the author aledges he was part of a SAS Assasination Squad operating in
Northern Ireland in the early 70\'s, all facinating reading if your
interested in SAS, If anybody can recommend any other books about the SAS
or other Special Forces from around the world, fact not fiction, please
e-mail me.

<comments re: SAS snipped>

Many SpecWar operators I know are very wary of the books you mention.  The
general feeling is that the author was pumping up his own crest to get
attention after the Army failed to acknowledge his incredible feat of
getting caught by awarding him the VC or something.

For a good look inside US SpecWar forces in Vietnam, check out "Inside the
LRRPs" and "Inside Force Recon", both by Michael Lee Lanning.  For anybody
interested in modern warfare in general, Tom Clancy\'s non-fiction series
(Submarine, Armored Cav, Fighter Wing, and Marine) give a great overview of
the organization and operation of modern US units.

Collin, one request...  could you pare you comments down into shorter
paragraphs?  I\'d like to quote you, but your stuff is rather imbedded.

Thanks for the comment, Marc.
I think that this sounds like a good change. To me, having things like
FTL radios show up in JTAS articles is much more upsetting than a table
missing from a sourcebook. (Not that missing tables are OK though).

I think Traveller\'s one strong point right now is its large, detailed,
_consistent_ background. A couple of minor inconsistencies are
potential adventure seeds. Big inconsistencies indicate sloppy design.
So far I don\'t think this has happened, but hey, why should that stop
me from worrying about it? ;)

1) Suppose a spaceship has reached a substantial fraction of the speed of
light, perhaps via a HEPlaR maneuver drive supplied by an electromagnetic
(or gravitic) "ram-scoop."  Is there any canonical reason why such a
fast-moving spaceship couldn\'t enter jump space?  According to the old
"C.T. Book 5: High Guard" design rules at least (the only ones to which I
have access right now), the only factor governing jump drive size is
overall hull volume - am I thus correct in thinking that relativistic mass
increases won\'t cause any complications? 

2) Suppose that fast-moving spaceship successfully enters jump space.
When it emerges from jump space, a week later, will it retain its original
velocity and orientation?

3) Does anyone have any idea how one would describe a electromagnetic (or
gravitic) "ram-scoop" in terms of the existing design rules?

4) Starships are supposed to get yearly maintenance at class-A or -B
starports.  If a starship had completely redundant drive systems, and
substantial fraction of its volume was dedicated to machine shops, cargo
bays packed with spare parts, skilled engineers in low berths (and so
forth, and so on), would it be possible to conduct "limited maintenance"
on one set of drives (enough to prevent misjumps and other catastrophic
failures) while the other was still in use?

Basically, here\'s the idea: a one-way colonization flight to the Large
Magellenic Cloud.  Yes, it would take centuries, and the wear-and-tear on
the jump drives would be quite brutal, but given enough redundancy, and
really extensive on-board repair facilities (the biggest "question mark,"
I think), it doesn\'t seem entirely beyond the realm of reason - just
extraordinarily difficult (and expensive).

Of course, this *is* an ambitious project - really long-range survey
missions *within* this galaxy could also be conducted, using the same
basic method.

Yes, you are correct.

That depends on how you play it. In my universe, velocity (which
includes
speed and direction) is conserved relative to the sector map, not to the 
location within a single system.

So, in your case, you\'d have to be careful where your ship materialized
from jumpspace. You could conceivably emerge at a point where you\'d be
heading
out of the system at relativistic speeds.

You should know that (Niven notwithstanding) ramscoops aren\'t really
that 
practical. There isn\'t enough interstellar hydrogen for them to
accelerate to
decent speeds in a reasonable time period.

Aside from that, ramscoop design specs are up to you.

I\'d say that you could use that scheme to significantly reduce the odds
of misjumping. There is, however, no substitute for taking a drive/power
plant
apart piece by piece and putting it back together again. You can\'t do
that 
on a ship, as far as I know.

Agreed. However, given the number of jumps needed to get to the
destination,
the ever-so-slight probability of a misjump still means that you\'d
probably
get at least one. 

Just making up some numbers, suppose you need one million jumps of
jump-6 to
get to some destination. Your odds of a misjump are one in a thousand,
given the
redundancy scheme you propose. You\'ll still have, on average, one
thousand
misjumps during the voyage.

        Note deficiency does not mean total absence...  If a purely local
food diet provides low but lifesupporting percentages of the RVDA of
certain vitamins, over time the Vegevilani are goinf to develop
deficiency-related diseases like osteoporosis (let\'s take calacium as an
example).  However, they are going to have somewhat greater concentrations
of the nutrients, proteins, what have you, than local foods do, because
they\'ve been bopping around concentrating it.  In the case of osteoporosis,
a Cannibilani, even if he just eats bread supplemented with Vegevilani bone
meal, is still going to be getting the calcium he gleans from the local
diet, plus the calcium that the poor Vegevilani managed to glean and fix in
his bones and eventually got eaten for.

        My (very, very, very vague) understanding of how nutrition works is
that you need protein and vitamins to build tissue and bones and keep
certain processes operating, and calories to provide the energy, which
often gets stored as excess fat if you\'re eating a lot of Big Macs.  So
cannibalism here isn\'t just about calories (or the thrill of the chase and
the joys of cracking a few beers and cooking over an open fire), but also
about protein and trace nutrients; the stuff that actually goes to build
human beings, not just keep them running.  Take cars: if there\'s enough
steel and plastic and washer fluid in their diet, they won\'t have to resort
to cannibalism; but if there isn\'t enough steel or washer fluid, in order
to make more cars or keep their windshields clean, they\'re going to have to
start preying on one another.

That\'s a good question. You are correct, in all canon design sequences
that I know of, mass of the vessel is never taken into account when
calculating the size of jump drive required. So, strictly by the book,
relativistic mass increases are irrelevant.

However, pseudo-scientifically, I am skeptical that the mass of a jump
drive is dependent upon the volume of the vessel. It *should be*
dependent upon the mass. IMHO, the design sequences assume that the
density of the ship is "average" (someone bounced around the average
density a while back -- what is it again?) and the tables use the hull
size as an approximation of the ship\'s mass... 

This also makes it more difficult to "jump in" those relativistic
rocks...
<taboo alert!> I\'ll leave the calculation of jump drive performance
degredation as a function of increasing relativistic mass as an exercise
for the reader . . . ;-)

Yes. The problem has always been, of course, velocity and orientation
relative to what? I\'ve always fudged it by saying more explicitly "when

In other words, if it had a vector of 20 m/s moving away from World A,
and jumps to another world B, its new vector would be 20 m/s moving away
from World B. Its exact location is anwhere at 100 dia. of World B, with
a vector of 20 m/s away.

IIRC, Fire Fusion & Steel mentioned something about broussard
ram-scoops, but I don\'t remember if there were any design sequences. It
all would depend on the hydrogen density of local space, energy input,
etc.

I confess to know very little about these things, maybe the physicists
on the list can take a crack at it. (Shadow?)

My Opinion: No.

The yearly maintenance includes complete inspection and/or repair of the
Lanthanum Grid meshed within the hull, and therefore needs to be done
"on the ground" or within some spacestation framework thingy in space
(scaffolding), as parts of the hull need to be opened and inspected.

But hey, it\'s your universe. Handle it the way you want. :-)

Wow, talk about dreaming big! I truly doubt though, that enough hydrogen
exists within the inter-galactic medium to fuel a jump drive with any
degree of efficiency. Not being a Cosmologist, this is strictly an
intuitive statement.

I think that any long range project of this magnitude (like the Zhodani
core expeditions) requires a "line of supply". Generation ships that use
jump drive are just too darn risky, imho.

Relativistic mass increases cannot affect jump drives. If they could,
then they would affect jumps in "normal" reference frames, since these
"normal" frames are relativistic to people in other-than-normal frames.

According to the rules, yes. Note that "one week later" will be in the
reference frame of the moving starship, not of the stationary star
systems. So time dialation will make these jumps longer than one week
in the reference frame of the folks back home.

Not me.

This is a really good idea. Keep in mind two things: the longer jump
times due to time dialation, and the longer jump distances due to length
contraction. Those 6-parsec distances will contract to 3-parsec distances (or
shorter) if you go fast enough. So a smaller j-drive will go farther at
high velocities.

Example: A j-3 ship moving at 87% of lightspeed makes a jump that is 6
parsecs long and takes two weeks in the reference frame of the folks
back home. To the folks on the ship, it takes one week and covers 3
(contracted) parsecs. This assumes (of course) that it is jumping along
the axis of its velocity. If it jumps perpendicular to its velocity,
then the jump will still take two weeks planetside (one week shipside),
but it will be only 3 parsecs planetside (and 3 parsecs shipside); it
will not get the distance bonus.

If you got the ship going fast enough it could make it to the
Magellanics in one jump. This jump would take hundreds of weeks as
measured planetside, but would be only one week shipside.

PS. 

The formula for time dialation or length contraction is

tau = cos arcsin (v/c),

where tau is the factor by which time is dialated and length contracted,
v is the speed of the reference frame, and c is the speed of light.

I too believe that the "volume" rules in HG and elsewhere are an
approximation to mass rules. But please note that this approximation
will work regardless of relativistic mass, since the mass of the ship
does not change in the reference frame of the drives.

An interesting question, but it does not affect relativistic jumps. If a
velocity is constant in one inertial reference frame, then it is
constant in ALL inertial reference frames. So it arrives with the same
velocity vector (whatever that vector may be, depending on reference
frame) regardless of which reference you chose (as long as you don\'t
change your reference frame during the jump, or accelerate it).

Changing your reference frame from one gravity well to another won\'t
work unless they have zero velocity relative to one another. Generally,
you have to chose which gravity well will be your reference and stick to
it throughout the jump. Which one you chose is not important, just that
it be used consistantly. Practically all physics equations assume that
you will not be arbitrarily changing your reference frames while working
on a signle problem.

What are those Fire supression rules and coolness under fire.  Even a brief
explanation of how they work, I\'d appreciate.  They sound very interesting
as I too have found Traveller a little lacking in that area.  Since this is
the whole point of modern infantry tactics, I\'d like to hear what those
other systems came up with.  Espically the Warhammer and 40k..

Also, if you read in the sections of TW2k, Dark Conspiracy, or Traveller:TNE
under automatic fire, there is mention of a danger area and that it can be
used to keep peoples heads down, but the odds are so low of getting hit in
this manner that it never really worked.

Subject: Re: CSC Question (fwd)

Sure, post this to the TML list if you want. I\'m only GDW-beta at the moment.

Clarification:
One-way in the CSC is based on an existing treatment for bulletproof glass,
on the idea that changing the compressive strength on one side of the glass
means that it is harder to penetrate from that side, but if the tensile
strength is not altered, it is easier to penetrate from the opposite side.

One-way will double or add 1cm (whichever is smaller) to the thickness of a
material for determining its armor rating, for purposes of incoming fire
only. Its intended use is to provide some protection to an otherwise
unarmored vehicle, and allow the occupants to fire back out without the
aesthetically displeasing and suspicion-generating qualities of firing ports.
Someone *really* concerned about attack would have a custom armored limo with
blow-out panels over concealed firing ports, rather than relying on the
limited protection that one-way could provide.

It is my understanding that relativistic speed has no effect on jump
vector.  That is determined by the field produced by the lanthium grid on
the hulls of starships.  The grid, however, must be capable of inducing
relativistic motion to a starship, or there would be bad (very bad) things
happening from differing solar orbital speeds on exit.

It is customary for merchant ships to enter and exit jump space at low
speeds (relative to the planet), but that is a holdover from times when
computing a jump point was either beyond the capacity of the ship\'s
computer (use a flight plan from the starport), or at the very limit of
the ships computer.  Reducing the margin of error (the exact point of
entry into J-space) by reducing ships speed is one way of doing that.
Exiting J-space at low speeds allows ships sensors a chance to build a
picture of surrounding space before blundering on.

Let me also say that there is a lot of debate on the
advantages/disadvantages of a merchant exiting J-space at a standstill.
It does leave one open to being jumped, if another ship is in the right
place at the right time.  My personal feeling is that it is safer to come
out at a low relativistic speed, and then build it back up; than to come
out hot and blind and hope that this is not the 1 time in a million that
something is in the way.

Military ships may find it necessary to exit J-space hot, but it is a
risky proposition unless good data is available for the destination point.

I would extend the duration for maintenance, but having spent a number of
years on board a navy ship, I can tell ya...Tenders are great, but when it
comes time to pull the plant and look at the tubes, you have to be in
port.

I do, if the player seems inclined to do so. Some players, like some
people I know, don\'t give a damn about the details behind the technology
- -- they just want to use it. That\'s how I am about TL 7-8 automobiles: I
don\'t give a damn if the vacuum regulator is defribbilating and in turn
is causing my Ford to run rough . . . all that matters to me is that my
pickup is not running right.

On the other hand, I know about computers and electronics and I *do*
care here. If a technically-trained PC asks: "What are the symptoms of
this problem?" and runs diagnostic software -- as a good tech would --
this is good roleplaying and might be worth experience points instead of
DMs.

One advantage of Joe\'s idea is that it will encourage players to learn
the about the game-tech in Traveller: after all, behavior that is
rewarded (with DMs) is repeated.

A lurker is amazed by the odds of misjump stated above.  Even with
the best maintained ship and supurb ship the misjump chances appear
to be closer to one in six, especially on new starships.

Has anyone had there pilot crash land twice in succession (not fatally).
The second on a corrosive atmosphere planet.

The way I play Jumpspace is that the drive creates a bubble around the ship
and rips a hole for the ship to travel to Jump Space through.  Based on
this, I think Jump Drives are based on volume because the issue is how big
the bubble and hole need to be, not at all on the mass of the ship.

The problem in my version of Jump Drive would be that the ship is travelling
too fast to enter the hole.  That is the pilot and astrogator would have to
work well together (it is harder to hit a hole twice the size of the ship
when you are moving very fast) and even then it would be very dependent on
how fast the ship was actually going and on whether the Jump Drive could rip
the hole into Jump Space far enough ahead that it would be big enough when
the ship arrived at that point.

>2) Suppose that fast-moving spaceship successfully enters jump space.

I would have this dependent on how well the Astrogator rolled and how much
preperation he took.  It is supposedly the "tumble" through Jump Space that
determines what the exit speed and orientation would be.  If the Astrogator
rolled sloppily, he might pass up the system altogether if the ship is
moving at relativistic speeds.

I would say that if the systems were sufficiently redundent and if there
were enough skilled workers AND if there were enough materials available for
repairs, then I would say yes.  I think the big issue is going to be the
materials for repairs.

This got me thinking (yes, Suz, it did hurt :)  )

Anyway, i was wondering if anyone has come up with a list of inconsistencies
in Traveller.  I\'m not talking about inconsistencies with the real world
(although that might be interesting), but what I\'m looking for is a list of
places where something appears in the rules or an adventure or whatever that
seems to contradict other rules, adventures, or whatever.

I know we have discussed Jump Torps and the <100dt Jump ships in TNE to
death, but I\'d like to know what other inconsistencies are out there and
come up with fixes for these problems wherever possible.  If no one has a
list of these, I\'d be willing to keep them, but since I have only a little
MT stuff and less CT stuff it will be hard for me to come up with the
inconsistencies myself.

Just a curiousity.

The odds are one in a thousand, "given the redundancy scheme" proposed
by the original poster. See the original post for details. Besides, I
was just making up some rough numbers to prove a point.

It occurs to me that if your voyage is about 50 kiloparsecs long, and your
destination is defined as "any potentially habitable planet in the Large
Magellanic Cloud" (rather than a particular nearby star system), even
being thrown 36 parsecs off course by a mis-jump shouldn\'t be a serious
disaster, provided that a mis-jump doesn\'t involve "tumbling" through jump
space, and thus re-emerging with the starship\'s bow pointed in a random
direction (which would lead to a completely unintentional, but fatally
long, detour through intergalactic space).

I would say that the "grid" on a starship\'s hull has got to be pretty
tough, with a great deal of built-in redundancy of its own.  Military
vessels can, after all, successfully enter jump space even after taking
damage in battle.  I doubt that there are very many micrometeorites in
intergalactic space, and some kind of gravitic "deflector shield" (a
specialized variant of the "repulsor bays" from the "High Guard" design
rules, perhaps) would reduce the amount of hull erosion, particularly if
combined with an "active" laser-based anti-meteorite system.  I suppose,
however, that portions of the grid could "burn out" after being energized
*thousands* of times.  Could an "extra-dense grid" be installed, perhaps
constructed with considerably thicker filaments and narrower spacing? 
Alternatively, some variation of the staging principle could be used. The
starship would have a layered, onion-like "hull," and only the outermost
"layer" would be energized during any one jump.  As soon as that "layer" 
begins to show signs of "burning out," it could be cast off, exposing a
fresh grid. 

I\'m afraid this discussion has strayed from the actual *rules,* and so
there probably aren\'t any real *answers* to a lot of these possibilities,
but it\'s nice that the background material is rich and detailed enough to
make this kind of speculation possible.

	Whatever, the ship rips a hole in space, enters it, and sews it back up
again afterwards, right? So what happens if the ship is destroyed before it
can close the hole up? Or does it close automatically? I\'m sure I read
somewhere that it\'s the ship\'s j-drive that closes it up.

	If the ship is destroyed, will the hole remain open? And for how long?
Will it get smaller or bigger? Could another ship detect energies emanating
from it, thus enabling its sensors to pin the hole down so it can
investigate? If the ship blew up in j-space before the hole was sealed, how
would the physics of j-space affect the explosion? (Difficult I know as
there is hardly any info on this.) Could the explosion be so powerful as to
destroy other ships in the vicinity, or the whole star system even? Could
any beings who might live in j-space find their way into our universe
through this hole whereas they never had the ability to cross that
threshold before? Assuming that if they do exist, although they\'ve never
before been seen during a normal j-space trip, they could be attracted by
the explosion.

	I have no idea if this has been discussed before, so please excuse me if
I\'m rehashing an old thread. And excuse if any of this sounds daft but I
can\'t remember seeing anything about it before, thanks!

	See ya...

No auto-success rule; however, if PC rolls a 12 that fails, allow PC to add

Unskilled Tasks: Increase difficulty by 1 line. JoaT/2 may be added. (so Jack

Exceptional Failure: Fail by 4 points. This is usually a crit fail.
Exceptional Success: Make by 4 points.

6.5+	Truly Impossible	26+  (truly impossible with a +12 limit)


Rationale:

+12 DM: max skill level is 12, since you can\'t raise skills past there
after CGen. Also, due to the approximately 50% increase in number of
skills, I figured a 50% increase in upper limit would be good.

Att/3 Best fit (IMNSHO) of ballancing attributes vs skills. Especially
since I round normally. gives range of 1-5 for PC\'s and old PC\'s may wind
up with a 0 from att.
Raised target numbers by 1 and added staggering. THis meshes with increased
skill and att mods; lower diffs are easier than MT, but not by much, for
experienced PC\'s.

Optional half lines table gives very wide scope of difficulties. Every DM+2
modifier from T4 becomes a -0.5 line modifier.

Also, Joe Average, with skill 1, att 7, gets a DM+3, giving him a 83%
chance of success on routine tasks. A rate I approve of.

From this exchange, I gather that the Ancients were using humans as
something other than labor?  If the humans were an active part of the
Ancients operations, say as easily retrainable labor for running or
repairing the machinery, then humans would have understood the processes
involved in food handling. When the original machinery broke down, they
would have had to jury rig some kind of replacements or find an alternative
way to do an understood process. 

I have always believed that Grandfather & his children took humans because
they were easier to train or retrain than their fellow droyne. Once a droyne
is caste, I am not aware of any way to change the caste. Humans, however,
can be retrained several times. 

Perhaps it was The Grandchildern\'s use of human workers in place of doryne
labor that precipated the conflict with Grandfather. In any case, I can\'t
see the Ancients shipping humans so far and wide, while genetically
manipulating them to fit their new environments just to have a \'pet\'.

long-range (multi-kiloparsec) voyages - to paraphrase another participant
in this thread, every so often, you\'ve got to take your jump drive apart,
spread the pieces out on the floor, and lovingly scrub each one with a
toothbrush until it shines.  Presumably, this takes space.  Space,
however, is something which tends to be scarce aboard starships,
particularly starships which are already packed with colonists in low
berths, spare parts, and redundant drive systems.

After fiddling around with the "High Guard" design rules, however,
something struck me: "Trillion Credit Squadron" has rules for collapsible
fuel bladders.  Suppose you have a very large insulated compartment,
adjacent to the engine room, which is normally occupied by a filled
bladder of fuel.  There are, however, sliding doors set in the aft
bulkhead of this compartment, which are wide enough to admit entire drive
systems (one, for example, of the ship\'s three redundant jump drives).
Presumably, gravity in both the engine room itself and the "fuel
tank/workshop" could be switched off, thus eliminating the need for
substantial cranes, scaffolds, and so forth.  If, for example, a jump-3
drive requires 4 percent of the starship\'s total volume, a compartment
occupying just under 30 percent of its volume should be big enough to give
a platoon of engineers plenty of elbow room.

I suppose the technological horse I\'m beating is beginning to show signs
of fatal injury, and there\'s always "G.M. fiat" to fall back on, but I
guess I just want to "do it right," and develop this odd idea in a manner
as consistant with the canon, as it is understood here, as possible.  If

This makes no difference to the survival of humans on Vland
as a species.  If you divide a species into two groups
the fact still remains that the first group could
only survive on the second group as long as the
second group has something to eat.  But, since they
are the same species, if the second group has
something to eat, then so does the first group.

No, I said that the Vilani had no more reason to be cannibals
than Terrans and there is no _more_ reason that it would be
a part of their past than it was of ours.

First of all, it should be noted that this still can\'t be an arguements
for the survival of the species as whole.  In fact, for this
to work, the prey has to be able to not only survive, but
maintain adequate health to keep functioning (and even then
only a small fraction could benefit from such cannibalism).

Second of all, such malnutrition is not unknown on the Earth.
However, cannibalism is not a common result of malnutition.
In fact, it takes full starvation to the brink of death to
drive people to cannibalism (and even then it is an iffy
thing).

The question arises is what are we going for here?  Clearly
the hitory of Vland doesn\'t require one to expect cannibalism.
Do we want to decide before hand that cannibalism exists and
we are trying to drum up reason for it?  Is this the best
way of making an interesting background?  I find that a
bit contrived.  It would be more plausible (and in many
ways more interesting) to say that the reasoning being
mentioned here has been taken up by critics of the Vilani
and coupled with "certain interpretations" of legends
from the times to allege Vilani cannibalism.

It works for me.  If the point is that you have to make a
"hole" in jump space big enough for the ship, then volume
would be the important parameter.

Note: relativistic effects are not something you "have".  They
are something that other "see in you".  No matter what
velocity you are travelling, you will never see any
change, in you or your ship, (instead you will see relativisitic
effects in things you are moving toward/away from) and
it is a fundamental basis of relativity that your
reference frame is just as valid as any other.

Actually, I think you are mostly right.

However the ramifications of a poor food supply are significant.  I
think the incidence of cannibalism would be higher in general as opposed
to Terrans, who could just as easily shwack a bambi as a human.  The
better fed Cannibilani would be tougher and more dangerous than the
weak, kkree-loving denizens of the woodland forests.  The big guys would
get the women, reproduce preferentially and that would be that until the
meat eaters dominated.  Of course the history doesn\'t say what the
Shugili used to create their treats-it could have been one of those big
lizard/giraffe beasties in DGP\'s Vilani sourcebook.  Plenty of meat plus
some there!

The lack of infectious diseases might also be VERY significant, as this
may  be where our social taboo against nibbling on each other may have
come from.  Similar to the taboo against marrying one\'s own sister-such
bad things happen that the tradition is put to bed real quick.

Without this they may never have developed a revulsion to "feasting,"
although I really think that is a bit TOO alien for my tastes.  No pun
intended:)

I think that is a better interpretation.  Certainly more in holding with
Traveller than the "Attack of the B Movie Cannibals From Vland."  

Instead of looking at it as why the Vilani didn\'t have resort to
cannibalism, look at it as an exercise in preferential evolution-natural
selection.  Would cannibilani have an advantage?  Would it be
widespread?  Where did the ruling families come from and how did they
come to power(Shugili?)  I think I can answer this to some degree.

We\'ve had our Donner Pass and Andes soccer team incidents.  People will
do a lot to survive.  If they don\'t get sick afterwards what is going to
stop them, especially with enemies who provide a tasty, high energy
supplement?  On Earth people die when they continously eat each other. 
It is so taboo and wrong of an issue the Bible doesn\'t even address it
as an unclean food.  I think the Vilani history should address this
issue, unless we can find a better reason for our own taboo against it
besides

"Well, we die when we eat\'em."  

As a rule the species just couldn\'t survive overall on cannibalism
because of the food pyramid.  That doesn\'t rule out the "fittest"
surviving on it.

Opps, I didn\'t mean to send it to the Traveller list :-(

Oh well, since I did.  You\'ll need a java enabled browser and (probably) a

 And, once could stipulate that this could be acheeved by simply turning
off the jump drive mid-process, as well.. Jump gates. 
 I would say that it would have to close automaticley, otherwise nearly
every merchant out there is grossley inefficent(carrying that big jump
drive and fuel), and battle raiders with one \'pathfinder\' ship to open a
hole right before attack would utterly dominate traveller naval warfare..

  I doubt it .. otherwise jump-space mines would seem to be probable. Or
you could postulate that what jump-space location you go into is unrealted
to your n-space location and is a mostly random(or terribley tangled thing
.. say a space 1cm away in n-space might be kiloparsecs away in j-space)
and hence the chance of it being close enough to matter are infatesimal.

 As is Traveller canon, j-space and gravity wells don\'t merge together well
.. so once could assume that any \'life forms\' that would live in j-space(or
native j-space \'matter\') would be even *more* susceptable to gravity wells
and hence would have to stay many parsecs away from a n-space star..
 This could also suggest that you could find yourself jumping into a
thriving j-space community if you did a jump while in intergalatic space or
inbetween the spiral arms of our galaxy...

Excellent point! As a referee though, I\'d force the
J-drive/M-drive/P-plant
to be more expensive (say, 25%) and require a bit (say, 10%) more room.
The extra room goes toward designing the components in such a way as to
make removal in this manner easier.

No, I think that this is a neat idea to play with. Who knows, one day
one of the players in my group might surprise me with a desire to do
this kind of thing. I\'ll be prepared for that!

Finally finding time to go through recent messages, and noticed this, I\'ve
done a little Traveller stuff on my Mac\'s.  If "Dragonfire is up, you can
check my web page, I\'ve got a ClarisDraw library of Traveller symbols that
I\'ve done up.  Gives you Drag-and-Drop templates for your starship
blueprints (Please note you have to have _ClarisDRAW_ to use it).

As far as I\'m concerned ClarisDraw is hands down the best thing around for
doing things like deckplans or sub-sector charts!

I just got KPT Bryce a couple of weeks ago, and I\'m trying to find time to
learn how to use it.  I\'m hoping to crank out some Traveller artwork with
it!

Kenneth,

You may want to look at Call of Cthulhu, White Wolf or TORG for different
ways of handling experience and skills aquisistion/improvement.

In CoC, if you have a skill, every time you do something with a skill you
have successfully, you get a "mark" or two. At the end of an adventure any
skill that you used can be increased by rolling percentiles successfully.
IIRC, the base is 10% and each tick is worth 5% additional.

White Wolf and TORG are both very stingy with points, but they charge a
certain amount to buy a new skill, then to improve a skill a player spends
an amount of points equal to the level they are going to. Most Torg
adventures yield 5-10 points, but they can also be used for re-rolls or to
buy damage off. In White Wolf, they are just for purchasing. Again, in
White Wolf, the TORG pattern holds. There is a start up cost and then a
cost to add skill levels. I run a Mage/WereWolf crossover and it is very
rare I give out more than 5 experience points. I\'ve players that save for a
year of real time (due to sporadic playing at certain times of the year)
for relatively minor upgrades.

I have used this interpretation also.  It makes sense to me to use 
the local gravity wells as the references for a jump rather than some 
"galactic north".  It also explains rather neatly why the standard 
procedure in CT was for ships to decelerate  before jumping.  If you 
did not, you would come out of jumpspace headed outsystem.

If you assume a "galactic north" as the reference, it becomes hard to 
explain why _everybody_, especially merchants, don\'t jump hot as a 
matter of course.  After all, time _is_ money.

There are also some interesting military implications. In the 
gravity-well-reference model, a ship coming out of jump headed 
insystem at a high velocity really had to work at it - by starting 
outsystem in its system of origin and accelerating inward before jumping.  
This would, again IMHO, be considered by the system defenders as an 
inherently hostile act.  They would shoot first and ask questions later.  
In the "galactic north" reference model, system defenders would be much 
less likely to attack an incoming hi-vee ship without working hard to identify it.

IMHO, the implications of the gravity-well-reference model are more 
consistent with the way things worked in the CT universe. And I like 
that consistency.

The Third Imperium is merely a speck in a galaxy billions of years old. As
Cleon\'s scouts, soldiers, and traders venture into this vast new
environment they are going to encounter things they never planned on;
harrowing dangers, fantastic rewards, unexpected rivals. Perhaps there are
description of TL 14 items because somewhere out there are civilizations
(gasp) more advanced than the mighty Imperium! Perhaps those "relics"
aren\'t as "ancient" as you have been led to believe. Perhaps some TL 12
engineering on salvaged TL 16 materials counts as "TL 14" manufacture.
Perhaps not every TL 12 civilization is going to be identical to Sylea.

I would complain if the TL 14 items were described as standard issue, but
they are not. They are described as "beyond current Imperium expertise" and
"recovered from derelict ships". I see them as adventure hooks and ideas
for new gimmicks. If this doesn\'t fit into you campaign, don\'t use them.

Well the general idea of Supression fire is to force the enemy to keep his
head down by filling the area with projectiles.  It isn\'t aimed so much as
sprayed.  Very wasteful of ammo, but if you\'ve got a MG, it\'s worth it.
