If they weren\'t so expensive, I can just see this tiny little missile
with a BG generator and capacitor and HEPLAR drive and guidance...
no powerplant, it uses the BG and caps/HPG/whatever and then does
little bursts of accelleration... and then rams.

They\'re perfectly viable, once they get big enough... and with some
minor rules bends, you can do some really nifty-neato things with them.

I did think about this, but I like my notion that these six represent the
Droyne concept of elements. If they do then Soil is more representative
of all kinds of ground surfaces than of argricultural land only.

Some of them, like the flame, the sigma wave, and the ice crystal, yes.
But the \'full-body representation of a human\' seem pretty direct. That\'s
one reason why I decided that the six small pictures of the Droyne castes
could concievably be on the coyns.

Interesting idea. I\'ll see if I can make something of it.

Oh sure. But then, the Phoenix presumably wasn\'t caled Phoenix either. 
This is just a translation. Eskaoyt is what a human archeologist would
cal it if he ever figured it out.

Agreed. I don\'t think the Vargr would make it  -  at that time they were just
one of a number of projects, confined to one world (In my Traveler universe,
at least, the Ancients tried other animals as subject for uplifting, but most
of them failed and none apart from the Vargr achieved major status (there\'s
one planet in my Foreven Sector with a race uplifted from otters)). But the
humans could have. However, I decided on the assumption that the coyns were
less important to the Ancients  -  more important than just cards, but not
as important as when the very continuation of your species depend on them.
So I\'ve assumed that they were not modified in Ancient times. Entirely a
matter of choice, of course.

For my part I abhor the causality violation implicit in precognition 
(unless the precognition is merely really good extrapolation ability).
So I assume that the Aslan coyn didn\'t get introduced until the Aslans
were already into space in a big way. As far as I\'m concerned Grand-
daddy (or, in my universe, the mysterious beings behind the Grandfather 
Legend) made one of his every-10,000-year visits to our universe around
- -1000 and updated the coyns at the time.

That is another possibility that I\'ve considered, but why would Gramps
bother?

True. But if the six lost coins really was hunting animals then the other
coyns were propably made up at a time when hunting was still important to
the Droyne.

A very interesting idea! However, that would mean that Sacrifice couldn\'t
depict a krinaytsui ceremony. What could it be instead?

This one seems a bit strained. But an interesting idea, nonetheless.

Imagine if you will that some common item in your life was discovered to

discover that having a common ordinary screw in light bulb turned on in 
your presence WILL KILL YOU!!!  Naturally people wouldn\'t use them 
anymore.  In time another method of illumination would be discovered that 
would not be hazardous.  Converting over to this new illumination method 
will be very expensive though.  Imagine getting rid of all of the light 
bulbs.  It\'s just too big to really do...

Now put yourself in the Regency.  Virus has made every piece of 
electronics potentially dangerous.  Maybe it will get infected and try to 
wipe you out.  Maybe it will just hold an egg to infect something 
bigger.  The threat Virus poses is very real.  Dealing with this threat 
will profoundly change the Regency.  Think of all of the computers and 
electronic they must have.  Why to convert them to safer configurations 
could take decades...

Any formation of Regency Military Forces must have an Electronic Warfare 
Unit.  This unit would provide Virus protection in addition to more 
traditional EW functions.  I imagine it would also have to have some 
electronic fabrication assets as well to repair dammaged electronic 
devices and to create "on the fly" new virus resistant electronic 
configurations.  The also might have a few nasty viruses in bottles to

 Wes Esser <wesley.esser@hd62.haledorr.com> posted a massive undertaking in
the
form of his vision of the Rgency government.  The majority of his
masterpiece is quite well thought out.  In particular the idea of a
planetary leaning in the one legislative arm and a population-based
slant in the other, the short take on the executive branch is sensible
and to the point, and the placement of the Regent in the scheme of
things.  Some points follow that I do wish to take issue with:

- - District courts: while matching the lowest level courts with the
Senatorial Districts I think there would be some basis for Planetary
Courts either in place of or in addition to these District Courts.
This would keep much of the local agenda from being decided by those
from different worlds.  This also would save on transportation costs.
At any level are jurors chosen in a manner similar to that in the
United Sates?  If so it is far less costly to move people about on a
single world (or system) than it would be to transport them one or
more parsecs, not to mention the time involved.  Think also of cost in
travel incurred by legal representation that need to travel to a
different system to participate in cases - or does the court travel to
the different planets to hear cases?  Obviously this applies to those
districts encompassing multiple systems.

- - Senate term length: 10 years seems like a long term.  Personally I\'d
favor four or five year terms.  I guess I\'m just a product of my
environment :) (check the trailer to see where)

- - Military: I agree that the military is not one of the branches of the
gov\'t but it does have some influence in the governing of the Regency
- - especially considering the quarantine and rapproachment with the
Zhos.  BTW does the Regency (and formerly the Imperium) have a
separate police force or is the military, particularly the army and
navy, given the task of enforcing laws?  Also shouldn\'t that be C-in-C
of the REGENCY Navy and Supreme Marshal of the REGENCY Army?

An improved method of achieving this objective, IMHO, would seem to be a
carrier/tended equiped with a number of remotely-piloted vehicles guided
from the mother ship.  This would allow the delivery systems to carry
the same punch with better maneuver performance as space for crew and
life-support would not be needed.

Regarding the ship classifications I like the proposed scheme that
battleships carry the heaviest weapons available at a given tech level
but modified to include armor in sufficient quantity to prevent turret
(& possibly bay) weapon penetration.  Cruisers would be armed similar to
battleships but without the full armor.  Lighter ships (destroyers,
frigates) would probably suffice with bay weapons and escorts and
cutters might only be expected to carry turreted weapons.

To add my Cr2\'s worth to the SDB argument - ships are tough to come by,
and they are expensive.  TNE pirate ships typically are modified
merchants and warships valued around MCr200-225.  As such one SDB coming
to the aid of a merchant harassed by one or two pirates is a definite
threat.  Also in the post re. protection of shipping lanes while the SDB
must maneuver to the location of the pirate the victim should be running
to the SDB and unless grappled and thrust applied in a different
direction will continue to do so thus decreasing the time until the
cavalry arrives on the scene.

Perhaps the fluctuations in the SWs TLs are due to a variety of internal
causes.  I\'m not entirely sure I understand the feudal technocracy govt
but suppose it allows for a large amount of \'infighting\' among the
junior levels of the technocracy on each world.

This may only take the form of buying out each other\'s economic assets
on up to sabotage of various forms and possibly assassination and
warfare.  Suppose every so often these small manueverings among the
technocrats build to a particularly large crescendo that results in a
large loss of the economic/industrial infrastructure with a
corresponding drop in TL.

Furthermore perhaps this postulated internecine rivalry may be more
prevalent on some worlds (such as Sacnoth) than on others (Gram) which
causes more of an introspective world-view and prevents Sacnoth from
gaining political control of the Sword World governing body despite a
higher level of technological achievement.  In fact it isn\'t all that
difficult to imagine, given such a scenario, that Gram may very well
sponsor various acts of espionage and intrigue just to ensure their
position and also to see that Sacnoth doesn\'t come to power.

Just an idea that occurred to me while enjoying the "The Hans and David
Show."  :)

Perhaps, but lasers provide a solution to the question of how to arm a small
ship to have some impact against large ships.  You are right on the effect on
Traveller "tradition" however -- traditionally, HG fighters are so much 
twaddle.

The X-ray laser bothers me, however.  Unless my spreadsheet in completly wrong
(and it works for the book example) with an X-Ray laser I can punch full
power out to 80 hexes with a nominal (1 meter) focal array.  I would sooner
see some meaningful range depreciation.  On the other hand, if you make a 
set of technological assumptions, you should live the consequences.

For the lasers I am designing (6-8 Gj input energy) some limitation on power
transmission might make some sense.  As it is the light SDB I am designing
right now will look like a capaciter with an attitude -- mostly HPG\'s.

Because I do intend to design to the rules as written, pushing the envelope 
where needed.  If we all do that, we may find the tradeoffs between armour,
punch, and speed that the new rules impose.  If there are truely none, if 
there turn out to be no limitting factors, then we can talk about fixes.

In the meantime, do you have a sheet of factor 2000 armour you would like a 1m 
hole in? :-).

    Insofar as ship sizes are concerned (for the figuring of ship
classifications). CT made large vessels likely and probable given the combat
and design rules. MT made warships top out at about 50k tons or less because
of the combat rules (Meson guns made larger vessels impratical except for
maybe showing the flag.... otherwise they appeared to be to fragile in
combat). With the advent of TNE maybe the balance has gone back to CT sizes
(or has it). So far this last is unknown till some designs get generated
and combat done.
    Plus RCEs and Regency ship classifications will differ because of the
big buiding gap. (Which also brings up building capacity... looking
at Oriflamme[?] as an example of sorts might be wortwhile).

  FEUDAL TECHNOCRACY AND JAPANESE TERMS (and firms!)


Hans Ranke <rancke@diku.dk> writes:

As for US industry, part of the problem is the Japanese are much better
about long-term planning than we have been.  US companies seem to think
of next-quarter\'s profits.  Japanese firms try to think of next decade\'s.
Then, there\'s other cultural barriers...but that\'s off on a tangent.

>It sound like the *kieritsu* is merely capitalism without anti-trust laws.

No, not really.  The Japanese *do* have anti-trust laws -- the US
helped write some of them in the late forties.  They\'re run by that
boogeyman of the US, MITI (Ministry of Int\'l Trade and Industry), 
I believe.  And please be careful about the differences between 
keiretsu and zaibatsu -- they are like apples and oranges (to use a 
cliche).  They\'re both fruit.  They\'re both more-or-less round.  They
are not the same thing.  

Let me try explaining the difference again in a *very* rough and at
least partly inaccurate way.  Zaibatsu were focused, vaguely feudal
cartels which, while not monopolies, occasionally were able to form
oligopolies in certain fields.  Keiretsu are loose, informal associations
which are in a sense networks of informal corporate "connections" 
that can work together to overcome problems.  Members of a keiretsu
aren\'t tied together in the way the zaibatsu were.  The part that makes
either of these look "feudal" to Westerners has a lot to do with, among
other things, the associated lifetime employment traditional in Japan.

Let\'s look at the Traveller terms again:

"Feudal Technocracy.  Government by specific individuals for those
 who agree to be ruled.  Relationships are based on the performance
 of technical activities which are mutually beneficial."
 
The first sentence is the "feudal" part.  The second sentence is the
"technocracy" part.  (Roughly.)
 
Note both what this says and doesn\'t say.  Government "for those who
agree to be ruled".  The zaibatsu concept works for this; you can
choose who you work for. Maybe they aren\'t interested in what you
can offer.  Maybe you aren\'t interested in what they offer.  So then
you both pick someone else.  Once you choose, it\'s expected that you 
have chosen for life.  In return, you have a place for life. 
The organization won\'t desert you, and you won\'t desert it.  This
whole thing is a lot like the freemen --> vassal process worked in
the middle ages.  Those relationships were based on mutual
protection, so the equivalence isn\'t quite total.  Whether or not
these relationships are hereditary isn\'t specified.  Neither is
societal inflexibility.  Such a system might be constructed in which
it is possible to start at the bottom and be gradually promoted into
a position of power, perhaps even one of the "specific individuals"
that help to run the whole system, by being at the top of their
particular feudal chain.

Another quote on early zaibatsu, same source as yesterday (p. 297):

"The ownership of large family enterprises remained in the hands of
 the original family, but management was gradually transferred to
 head clerks, who stayed with the company for life.  In fact, the
 whole business firm was a sort of extended family, with a strong
 sense of mutual loyalty between employees and employers...."
 
Kind of a cross between the two.  And more extreme systems either
way can easily be imagined.  And companies don\'t even need to be
part of it -- that isn\'t specified either!  There are many ways
to develop a government by specific individuals by those who
agree to be ruled, based on whatever.


  ASLAN AND FEUDALISM

Another system to look at in Traveller while considering this is
the Aslan Hierate\'s clan system, which culminates in the Tlaukhu,
the council of the Twenty-Nine.  While not a feudal technocracy, it
is a fairly feudal system.  The fteirle have no king.  But one is
properly respectful to the Yerlyaruiwoko!  Some clans are considered 
"more important" than others in stature, but there is no true central 
authority.  There\'s other cultural stuff going on here too, so 
be careful.  But you don\'t even *need* a single leader over everyone,
if you have another stable solution -- like a lot of little leaders
that don\'t go for each other\'s throats.

  OTHER RELATED GOVERNMENT TYPES

"Company/Corporation.  Government by a company managerial elite;
 citizens are company employees."
 
Note that this seems to imply one company in control.  Which makes
sense -- this government type is most often seen with small population
codes, so it works well for isolated mines, facilites, and so forth.
This covers everything from a SuSAG psi-drug facility on an otherwise
uninhabited world, to "The Chartered Zarathustra Company" which is
in charge of the resources and colonization of Zarathustra.  

Now, if you have a collection of companies which own or control bits
of the planet, perhaps a better code would be:

"Balkanization.  No central ruling authority exists; rival governments
 compete for control."

And in fact, most of the government types can be twisted in a way
that allow companies to be used, if you twist the company enough too.
That\'s the beauty of Traveller government types; they are flexible. 
A lot of the codes in the UWP are like this.  The idea of the UWP is
to have a system in which you can generate a sample world in ten 
minutes and then be able to take it and develop it massively in many
different possible directions.  Without a system in the game like 
the UWP, we\'d never be able to develop entire sectors in a way that
was at all realistic in a reasonable amount of time.

We seem to have sparked a great deal of interest with the feudal technocracy
discussion.  It\'s generated a lot of useful information, IMHO.

From Thurday night, Alistair Langsford <langsl@cbr.hhcs.gov.au> writes:

I guess I was looking for an explanation of the nature of the vassal
relationship.  In a medieval feudal aristocracy the lord received military
services and local resources from the vassal and in return provided 
coordinated security.  In a situation in which the technical vassals
`manage\' activities for the lord I don\'t see what they\'re getting in
return that is equivalent to the security provided by the medieval lord.
If all the `technocrats\' get is pay you really only have a corporate
system.

Okay, I was trying to focus on the specifics that distinguish a feudal 
technocracy from other forms like a corporate model or aristocractic
oligarchy.

Yes, this is true but focusing here doesn\'t really allow for much discussion

Yes, this is key regardless of what terms are used to describe the

I think technocracy speaks of more than mere `management\' of technical
activities.  I beleive technocracy calls for *rule* of the society by
those with technical knowledge and skills.  I see `technical\' as being
much broader than just engineering and science - it is the entire network
of infrastructure that permits technical activities to occur - industry.

Certainly, but as I\'ve suggested elsewhere, I believe such a `specialized\'
feudal technocracy will be the exception rather than the rule, just as
representative democracies with a very narrowly defined demos will be the
exception.

Maybe except the key difference as I see it is that in a corporate system
there is no bond between employer and employee.  The employer may sever the
relationship (in effect remove your `citizenship\') at will.  This is why
corporate systems only occur at low population levels.

Again, yes, but this sort of dampens the discussion.  I find it useful and
interesting to focus on those aspects which *do* distinguish one form from
another.

As I\'m always one to stir the pot, how about this idea?  If we look at all
government types in terms on two key points: the nature of ruling authority
(who rules) and the source of that authority (who consents to that rule)
we can see that *all* government types, except those where a *single*
individual is able to exert *direct*, personal control over the others
(i.e., very small groups), are inherently *democratic* in the source of
of authority.  Even the most oppressive totalitiarian theocracy requires
*some* degree of consent from the populace in order to function.

This seems to be a point of some disagreement.  It seems to me it has been
suggested that anti-Viral activities will be the focus of the Quarantine
Service while more `traditional\' military activities would be handled by
the conventional military services.  I also seem to remember other suggestions
that there would not be such a distinction.  [WARNING! : I don\'t have TNE!]

What\'s the distinction here between `indigineous\' defense battalions
(those forces that remain on a particular world) and `mobile\' forces
(the `regular\' Army)?

Does this include aerospace and nautical forces?  I\'d like to see work

to only the Ground Force Command as was the case previously in the Imperium.

Yes, I\'d prefer a `strategic\' (dare I use that word again?) focus in
addition to a `tactical\' focus.  It seems to me it should be simple to start
at the `General Staff\' and `Admiralty\' level and work down just as it is
beneficial to start at the combat unit level and work up.

Let\'s get busy!

I think the final analysis of what fleet strengths should be lies
with each individual gamer\'s view of the universe.  You can argue
this source or that source forever, getting nowhere.  That\'s pointless,

Work it out yourself for your world.  Me?  When I work it out from

to be consistent with everyone else.  I\'m sure others can assume
less military spending or different breakdowns of where it goes
and get an order or so less in magnitude in spending.

    'body' => '  A DISCUSSION OF THE DENEBIAN BLOCKADE
  
I know this has been hashed out once, but I thought another close
look at it couldn\'t hurt.

The maps of the Frontier-Wilds line in _Survival Margin_ and TNE 
don\'t quite jibe.  SM suggests that some vargr states in Gvurrdon
are still holding out.  (Look *above* the legend box near the Zho
border.)  TNE shows everything outside Regency/Consulate space to
be Wilds.  If you take all wilds to be virus-infested, then there
are no uninfected surviving vargr states.  So the Regency is 
forced to defend the entire coreward border at full force.

In Deneb, some subsectors are totally lost: Million, Atsah, and
Antra beyond the xboat line, and a world or two in Lamas.  Except
for some loss in Antra, these were mainly worlds *already* lost
to the vargr or the client states near Atadl.  The worlds in the
Great Rift, although shown otherwise, are isolated out far enough
to be safe.  The naval blockade at Catacomb (2234) is actually
*outside* the frontier line drawn.  No bases were at Catacomb as
of 1120.

In Reft, the Rift Republic is a Frontier.  However, so is the RC.
It belongs to neither side of the Rift -- it\'s jump-7 either way.
However, the link to the Denebians at Tonnurad was threatened by
the New Lords expansion in the 1120s.  The Republic\'s defense is
assured since the only virus approaches are through the Old Islands
worlds -- and we all know about how strong the local military is.
Otherwise, the Reft worlds on the Denebian side are fairly safe.
All have class-B starports, and there is a former Imperial Navy
base at Arnorac (2509) that had seen a sharp increase in traffic
since 1116, and which the RQS could use.

In Troy, the defensive line seems to exclude two important worlds
(the *only* two worlds) in the Binary subsector.  Both should be
safe.  First, they belong to the Denebian side of the Rift.  One,
Sarage (2938), was the site of an Imperial research station and
naval base.  The other, Auitawry, is a weird one.  An interdicted
droyne world at tech-15, with a class-A port, droyne naval base,
known Ancient site, and 500 million residents.  It might *own* the
other by now!  So even if virus could get there, it would have
a few troubles once the worlds had warning.

I wonder how Virus and the Ancient ship in Komesh would get along?

In Riftspan, the New Lords have it right.  The main jump-5 route
that runs through the mid-rift cluster has been cut just short
of it, at Aoki (1816).  Afatre (2219) on in is outside the line.
There is a *second* jump-5 route across the rift that branches
off at Esui, but it is also cut in the best place, at Waikhta
(1420).  The cuts are in just the right places to deny the virus
access to any worlds accessible on the Denebian side of the Rift.
From Waikhta, you can reach two worlds, and shortly the mid-Rift
cluster is accessible.  I fully expect that both systems look like
Aslan naval depots by now.

In fact, the Aslan line is far more defensible than the Regency\'s
position.  A better place for the Regency line would be Corridor/B
Windhorn/N, and the best would have been Corridor/D, Windhorn/P.
However, these were vargr held regions.  I suppose that the vargr
fought a valiant rear-guard action in Corridor and Windhorn to
try to save themselves and the states further to spinward (a success
would have brought "mongo charisma" <grin>) but undoubtedly it was
impossible for them to organize enough to form a tight barrier in
time.  It probably held long enough for Deneb to get organized, 
though.

I\'m worried we\'re getting a little acrimonious here.  Let me state that I
*accept* that the techno-economic cycles are *possible*.  I find them very
*unlikely* based upon my understanding of economics *and* technology.  I
also find the idea of Zhodani support to be a more credible (and therefore
more likely) explanation for Gram\'s domination of the Sword Worlds.  I also
prefer this explantion from a *gaming* standpoint because it provides for
some interesting ramifications in the Sword Worlds should the nature of
Zhodani support for Gram change in the New Era.

I accept this.  And it *is* a factual record.  From *Supplement 3: The
Spinward Marches* to *MegaTraveller Journal* #3 we have a period of about
fifteen years of elapsed time.  Clearly there were some changes in this
data (you\'ve mentined the allegiance codes) so the fact that UWP changes
weren\'t made *must* be assumed to be intentional.  (Although I *suspect*
there *was* no intention, as in much of what\'s appeared over the years.)

Now [WARNING: I don\'t have TNE!] it\'s my understanding that there were some
significant UWP changes for the the Regina subsector material presented in
*TNE*.  Clearly, this is intentional as well.  Whether it is *reconcilable*
with any of the pre-TNE material is another matter.

I don\'t think it\'s that certain.  Yes, there may have been cycles but as
it stands the records show fifteen years of stagnation and *no* evidence of
any down turn.

Let\'s remember all this is occurring in a 2D universe!  How\'s that for a
suspension of disbelief?  Seriously, I, too, find the rate of technological
advancement inscrutably slow but can rationalize it as a legacy of Vilani
culture.  These `techno-economic cycles\' seem to add one more layer of
required suspension of disbelief for me, especially in the absence of any
evidence to support them.  You must also realize by now that we\'re you to come
up now with just *one* example of a down turn, I\'d explain it away as a mere
typo?  :-)

This is what grates with my economic and technological sensibilities.  You,
yourself, have maintained that *maintenance* of a particular level of
technology is easier than *advancing* into a new level.  Technological
capability may be tied to economic capability but it is not directly so.
Economies fluctuate all the time.  Technological fluctuation occurs much
less frequently and is a much more *serious* event.  I maintain that a
*severe* economic downturn would be required to produce a significant (in
terms of a tech level change) technological downturn.  Recall that our only
modern example where this sort of event *might* have happened is during the
Great Depression.

So, in conclusion Hans, I agree that these `techno-economic cycles\' are
quite *possible*, but based upon my understanding of economics and technology
they are, IMHO, very *unlikely* and virtually impossible on a wide-scale
basis such as an entire subsector, much less across an entire sector or
more.

Now on to the question of feudal technocracy.

Why not?  What if I had said `*holders* of industrial production\'?

What I get from your emphasis on these defintions is a focus on *land*.
Is that where our disagreement lies?  I grant the `ownership of land\' by
the lord but don\'t see it as being very important despite what the venerable
Oxford tome has to say.  The key part of the lord\'s end of the feudal
agreement was the provision of coordinated security services, not some
tenuous grant of land possession.

Of course there is dissent among the various shareholders, just as there
was often dissent among the vassals of a particular lord.  I don\'t see
your point here.  What is there about this that suggests it isn\'t feudal?

The various shareholders in a *particular* corporation all hold `fealty\'
to the Chairman of *that* company.  This is akin to a medieval situation in
which a single individual had risen to the top of the feudal structure,
a king.  Maybe the difference here is that you\'re looking at, say, Gram,
as medieval Germany, while I\'m at looking the entire Sword Worlds as all of
medieval Europe?

I\'m confused.  You wrote:

> >>Traditional feudal society  Corporation             Feudal technocracy

Which suggested a three-way comparison to me: feudal aristocracy, corporate
system *and* feudal technocracy.  I guess I misunderstood you.

> And a vassal does what his liege lord says or he is \'fired\'.

In theory, yes.  In practice, not very often, unless the system had travelled
well down the road toward autocracy.  A corporate model is *always* auto-
cratic.

Etc.

Okay, I stand corrected.  I maintain though that this `ownership\' was not
the important, *practical* aspect of the lord\'s part of the feudal
agreement.  Rather, it was his provision of coordinated military services
that was what *mattered* in the feudal arrangement.

> Coordinated services may be the reason why the other lords decided to back 
> him. But what they owe him fealthy for is the tenure of their fiefs.

Okay, I stand corrected again,  You\'re talking about the *philosophy* of
feudalism (the legal basis) and I\'m talking about the *practice* of it (its
practical implementation).  I think my focus is more useful in trying to
understand the translation of the medeival feudal aristocracy to the 
feudal technocracy of Traveller.

> Look, the shareholders in a corporation is a conglomerate owner.

No.  The shareholders are a morass of different interests just like the
various vassals of a medieval lord.

> In theory
> they make up one person, the owner of the corporation.

Again, I don\'t think talking about theory is particularly useful.

> The Chairman works
> for the owner. The vassals \'works\' for the king. See the difference?

In practice there is *no* difference.  In *practice* the medieval king
`works\' for the vassals in provinding coordinated security services just
as the technocratic king works for the shareholders in providing 
coordinated profit services.  The medieval vassals provided military
service *and* taxes and the technocratic vassal provides financial
capital.  The two situations are *very* analogous, IMHO.

> A fief has _one_ owner.

Just as any single bloc of shares has *one* owner.

> A baron can\'t sell off shares of his barony to make

Exactly.  Just as purchasers of shares gain title to their own new fief!

> And if a company is the 
> equivalent of a fief then there won\'t be any shareholders, just one baron.

No.  A private company, without public shareholders (there may *still* be
several *private* shareholders), is akin to a `barony\' on an island in
the middle of an ocean somewhere.  It\'s not part of a feudal system either.

> There can be no
> shareholders in a feudal fief, technocratic or not.

The group of shares held in common by any single shareholder (this may be
a group of individuals but with respect to their stock they are acting in
concert) *is* a fief!

> It sound like the *kieritsu* is merely capitalism without anti-trust laws.

I think that is a *great* definition of feudal technocracy!  See, because
it considers the entire economy (i.e., `capitalism\') it is much more 
complicated than any single corporate system.  (BTW, the reason there
*aren\'t* any anti-trust laws in a feudal technocracy is because political
power is tied directly to economic power - there is no `government\' to 
control the economic barons.  In a sense, the civil war on Joyeuse can
be seen as an `anti-trust\' action!)

> Nope. The central tenet of feudalism is *service* as a medium of repayment.

Again, you\'re arguing feudal *theory* and I\'m arguing feudal *practice*.
Medieval vassals paid taxes to their lords.

It seems to me you\'re still focused on a single company.  A feudal
technocracy has to involve the *entire* economy.  To use the *Space Viking*
model, there were probably `veterinary service\' fiefs under Traskon and
`geological service\' fiefs under Karvalmills, just as Traskon and 
Karvallmills were held in fealty to Duke Angus.  Remember that Trask
and Karvall were Angus\'s *vassals* but Trask later *sold* Traskon to
Angus. Ownership was not the legal basis for homage in Piper\'s Sword
Worlds.  Profit generation was.

Trask sold the entire barony because he needed it for the ship, *not* because
he couldn\'t sell it in parts!  (He was also anxious to get away from Gram.)

Why?  This happens all the time, now.  Through a series of mergers and
acquisitions International Telephone and Telegraph (IT&T) no longer has
any telecommunications businesses as it\'s `core\'.

Okay, so he did just like I\'ve suggested Sacnoth ought to do with Gram.
He used his greater economic strength to acquire military force that
permitted him to quicken the process of economic hegemony and eventual
monopoly.  He convinced other Gram nobles to support him just like I
suggested Sacnoth might find supporters among the other Sword Worlds for
a move against Gram.  Are you arguing my case now?  :-)

Doesn\'t `glommed onto\' here mean the same thing as `controlling large blocks
of industrial production\'?  What difference does it make how they came into
possession?

No, I\'m not talking about the *company\'s* pension fund.  It\'s pension funds
for, say, teachers.  The teachers\' union has a pension fund for its members.
These funds can run to billions of dollars.  The manager of this pension
fund, hired by the teachers\' union, is responsible for gaining the best
return for the fund (or she get\'s fired - a corporate arrangement).  The
pension fund manager chooses to buy shares in, say, IBM.  The teachers\'
union becomes a shareholder of IBM, a `technocratic vassal\'.  If the fund
has purchased a large enough share of IBM it enjoys a great deal of influence
on the IBM board.  If IBM isn\'t profitable it\'s shares lose value and the
pension fund loses money.  This makes the teachers mad and the next thing 
you know, CEO Akers (the technocratic lord) is out and CEO Gerstner in now
running IBM.

It\'s actually much more complicated because the teachers\' union pension fund
is invested in General Motors and Exxon and Mitsubishi Industries, etc. as
well.  And then you have the railroad union, and the government employees
union, and Ross Perot, all the other investing shareholders in the market
place, including the corporations themselves which all own shares in each
other.  It\'s as complicated as medieval Germany.

Again, you\'re focused on theory and legal underpinnings.  Do you suppose
Duke Angus was acting within `legal\' bounds when he invaded Glaspyth?
The teachers\' union has no legal `right\' to replace the CEO but it happens
when they\'re displeased nonetheless.

Tom O\'Neill has already identified our respective focuses upon opposite
ends of the feudal spectrum.  (Although I don\'t see myself as *being* on
the other end - it\'s just easier to illustrate the workings of the
system from there.)

No.  In a feudal *technocracy*, economic power is tied directly to political
power.  (Just as political power was tied to land and military power in the
medieval feudal system.)

Because the Sword Worlds do not have the political stucutures outside of
the economic stucture that contemporary free-market governments do.  In
actuality, Gram is *more* vulnerable than the US.

Okay.  You argue this one with former-TMLer and flame-prone Mr. Higginbotham.

I was simply pointing out, as Duke Angus of Wardshaven recognized, that

Try to get away from theoretical definitions an instead think about how

No.  It\'s based upon *possession*, of a land fief or a stock fief.  It is
manifest in the nature of the *obligations* (coordinated services on the
part of the lord, local services and resources on the part of the vassal)
arising from the feudal agreement.

I have a longer post which I\'ll get to soon I really want to get some 
permissions first as some of the "NPC\'s" are mine and one of my player\'s

Last night Jim ( James Kundert ) and I were talking on the phone about a 
many things, Some pertaining to our campaign group, Where do we go from here
and the change over to the T:TNE rules set. 
One fo the things we discussed was the premise that you could and would see
Heplar, Fusion Rockets and thrusters in the same milue. Think for a munite.
say the technology for thrusters is a little esoteric and the method of 
manufacture requires a tech of a certain type then eariler ships or those  
built at places unable to build the ( VERY Expensive ) thrusters would use
the alternatives and the spaceports would know how to handel those ships.
"Just park it over there Yea thaat slagged down area". "I\'m sorry sir but
now that your ship si docked in the upstation your engines will have to be
locked out!"
Another idea that occured to me was how do you clean a starship? Especilly 
the interior. Programmible Vacuum cleaners? ( I was reading the Roche world 
why do you ask...? :-)) nobody has designed some thing like the Christmas
bush motile for traveller.
Jim pointed out that we haave traditionally had no good rules for the design 
of robots... Don\'t I know I was trying to design a character she is an 
excellent pilot working for the navy and weighs in at about 400 tons the 
latest in stealth thchnology and an accidental AI.
Why they can not replicate her is a murder mistery that I may run someday.
Any way she is test flown by an ex scout pilot ( irrreverent, but then aren\'t 
they all ;-)) she also meets a lady who explains to her her rights as a 
thinking being and she wants to muster out after 20yrs.... boy ain\'t INI gonna
love it... Her name is Paulinene ( as in peirls of... [ honist I did\'nt think 
of it really it\'s not my fault ;-)]). 
By the way on board the ship she has a holigraphic image for interacting
with humans, so unless you are pretty sharp, the casual observer might not
realize that the ship\'s pilot is not human...
Any way I\'ve rambeled on far to long but if some one wants to give a shot at 
designing a cleanbot, or Christmas Bush, Please do. as for paulene go ahead 
and use her if you want to drive your sensor ops crazy.

Impact missiles? Naaah forget it. I must agree with GDW in FF&S that the
change in rules and how the "real" world works you can\'t expect to get a
missile within impact range of a starship if it is armed with a laser.

Saturate the defenses? No way, if that should be pssible we must see
launchers with a ROF of at least 10 a minute, and the missile must have
more than 4Gh to spend of fuel. With the volume of the missiles and
magazine limit on the turrets and barbettes I find this unlikely.

But I can think of other types of missiles that can be of use. They
don\'t need to impact, but has to get real close to the target. I can
think of two types of missiles.
 - Antimatter missile
 - Black hole missile

Both missiles need small warheads compared to the missiles in TNE. One
gram of antimatter should be enough to fry a starship at a decent range.
The antimatter is held in a gravitic bottle and mixed with matter when
the missile is close enough to hurt the target.

Black hole missles can function in a similar way. When the missile is
close enough, the black hole can be released and "shot" at the target
with a gaussrifle thingie or something similar. A weapon like this will
be expensive, and thus only useable against battlecruisers or larger to
justify the cost.

I haven\'t given the starship design a full test to date. I\'m tinkering
with a ramscope ship for one of the alien races in Gvurrdon. The race is
not able to utilize jumpships due to a phenomenom that kills them during
jump. The reason I have made them vulnerable to jumpspace is that their
world is a TL 16 world, and that would put them in a position to quickly
conquer much of Gvurrdon before thay are stopped.

Anyway I think we will meet limitations in the designs as we put on
armor, drives and weapons. A fighting ship should have a decent Gh
rating or else it will run out of fuel mighty fast. And that is the
worst limitation of them all. Even a decent merchant get problems with
fuel, and a merchant in a brawl? He\'s in big trouble. Ten to twenty Gh
will run out pretty soon, and much of it has been spended to reach orbit
and jump point. I find it unlikely that merchants will refuel at a gas
giant, unless the mainworld orbits a gas giant, or the 100 diameter
limit of the star is far outside the habitable zone of the system, and
that the gas giant is in a favourable position for a route from jump
point to the world.

This is a key difference between the feudal technocracy model and 
contemporary free-market economies.  In a feudal technocracy there is
no governmental entity outside of the economic system to intervene with
anti-trust or any other sort of regulation.

Thanks again for all this material about the *keiretsu* and *zaibatsu*,
Steve.  It\'s been very helpful *and* interesting.

(BTW, I have a great picture of me in front of the MITI building in Tokyo.
There\'s a `homeless\' man sitting in the background right in front of
the headquarters of this US `boogeyman\'.)

What makes it look feudal to me is the `inter-relatedness\' of the 
various corporate entities - something that is quite uncommon here in
the US.  There is clearly a system of agreements (explicit or implicit)
that define the roles and responsibilities of all participants.  It\'s
*quite* different from the autocractic corporate model.

I never meant to suggest that the *keiretsu* (I\'d never heard of the
*zaibatsu* before you mentioned it, Steve) fit my idea of a feudal 
technocracy perfectly.  Rather, the *keiretsu* merely served to
introduce the economic and industrial aspects of a feudal technocracy.
I felt this was needed since many of us are already familiar with the
aristocractic aspects of medieval feudalism but have little or no
familiarity with the industrial and economic basis of a technocracy.

> "Feudal Technocracy.  Government by specific individuals for those

I refuse to live with this miserably vague definition.  The first
sentence describes *any* representative democracy.  If we look at
`technical\' in the second sentence as meaning `any specialized branch of
knowledge\' then this entire definition might be used to describe a
popular theocracy in which clerical specialists perform various
religious rites for the `governed\'.  Thus, this canonical definition
is virtually useless.

The relationships between freedmen and serfs and the nobles in medieval
society was not feudalism at all.  Feudalism concerned the relationship
between members of the aristocracy, the ruling class.  Hence, a feudal
technocracy gives a system in which the relationships between the
members of the ruling class (the technocracy) are governed by feudal
principles.

Ah, still another Piper fan.  James, might it be possible to get another

Good point.  I hadn\'t thought of it this way.  I still think the government
codes could be improved though by focusing on the nature of authority (who
rules) and the source of authority (who consents).

Good work here.

The K\'kree rise again!  This, actually, is exactly the K\'kree tactical
solution to fighters spelled out in Alien Module 2.  They can\'t have a 
lot of fighter pilots in craft since they don\'t like cramped spaces.
So they hit on this solution.  The Fleet Marshal of the Kirunka\'rra
space wing is undoubtedly prepared for TNE!  Now if they can only fit
enough crew in their ships....

Give the gent a prize!  This gets at the difference between "feudal" and
non-"feudal" government.  (My understanding of why company/corporate rule 
is a low population feature is a bit different, but I went over that in
my last post.)

"Ah, this is obviously some strange usage of the word *democratic* that

I get the thesis here, that power is ultimately derived from the masses.  
But I don\'t know that I could possibly call an oppressive authoritarian 
government "democratic".

I did want to weigh in on the possibility of economic cylces causing
TL fluctuations.  I do not think this is likely except under extreme
and prolonged circumstances because moving to a lower TL would require
NEW INVESTMENT.  The point has been made many times on sci.space that it
is not possible to ressurect the Saturn V because the whole TL 6 infra-
structure of suppliers would have to be recreated.  This costs money, some-
thing one doesn\'t have a lot of in an economic down-turn.  To use another
example, lets say this country was in a severe depression and GM wanted
to cut costs.  Since it already had an existing TL 7 production plant, it
is not immediately going to switch to TL 6, because this would involve
retooling.  However, if this depression continued long enough the might
stop replacing their robot welders, and might start using people again.
GM also might begin designing "low-tech" cars that would eliminate a lot
of the cost of a car.  But again, it wouldn\'t do this quickly because
it would require them to retool their factories.  Also, GM would only do
this if they thought conditions would exist long enough to make the
investment worthwhile.  This whole process depends on how long their old
plant lasts until it wears out and how much it costs to go "low-tech."
        The above situation is unlikely to come about through the normal
business cycle because there are so many "automatic stabilizers" in 
economies that keep recessions from getting too deep or lasting too long.
Feudal Technocracies are likely to have even more of these stabilizers
than we do.  Life-time employment means that people will not quickly
lose their jobs, which will buoy consumer spending, for instance.
        To recap, TL decline through economic decline will only occur
through non-economic shocks like war, Virus, etc. and even then will only
occur when people have reason to believe that the economy will remain 
depressed for some time to come.

Actually I don\'t buy the idea of remote controlled fighters. Ever
thought about the time lag in communications? And what kind of
communicator do you use for control?

Laser? Naaah it will be like aiming a 30,000km straw at a target you
can\'t see. And it moves as well. If the communication laser loose the
drone once it is lost for ever. And there is a lot of other things that
has to work perfectly. Read Challenge 71.

Tight beam radio? Better. It sends out a cone of radio waves. Much
easier to keep the drone in control, but then we got jamming.

The comminication lag is the worst hurdle to get over. If the drone is
10 hexes away the update wil take 2 full seconds just in communication.
And then we got the reaction time with the controller. Even though we
don\'t got crafts that can\'t maneuver on a dime anymore, there will be a
lot of operations that need short response times or else the craft may
be lost. Just a mudane thing as few controls cease to work properly.

The starship lasers presented here is intended to use with Brilliant
Lances, and Traveller: The New Era. I have used Fire, Fusion & Steel,
GDW\'s book about hardware design for the Traveller universe. This
document will be updated as new lasers are being designed.

The un-manned turrets and barbettes require MFD\'s if installed. These
turrets and barbettes are recomended to be installed on larger starships
(2000tons or more) to save in on the crew count. The Turrets should then
be combined into batteries, with one MFD per battery.

Everyone seems to be getting into our TML Regency Sourcebook, *Shall Not
Perish*.  Fantastic.  Some broadly ranging comments:

Steven Gott <sgott@u.washington.edu> writes:

Does this mean you think the regular military will have a role in fighting
the Virus rather than this just being the responsibility of the Quarantine
Service?

An interesting concept.  Does this mean *every* military asset in the
Regency must be retrofitted in some fashion?  With that sort of government
spending going on I can\'t see the Regency economy `straining\' for decades.
(Of course, the rumored `need for economic expansion\' of the Regency in
TNE has always sounded too much like rehashed Reaganomics to me.)

You think so?  I would have thought that use of this sort of weapon would
have become quite inconceivable after the Viral Collapse.

Sword Worlds :-)

A `true\' heir to the Iridium Throne showing up with a Unification Fleet?
(Rebellion II).

Regency nobles upset at the `democractic\' reforms taking place (Rebellion
III).

Regency `democracts\' upset at the slow pace of `reforms\' (Rebellion IV).

Again, keep in mind that the judicial function was performed directly by
the nobility under the Imperium.  How might the nobility have come to
forfeit this right/responsibility?

At this level of court system we\'re not talking jury trial but rather 
courts presided over by judges - like the US Supreme Court and Circuit
Courts.

This was the original practice of the US Circuit Courts.  (The judge
travelled around the `circuit\'.)  Now, folks tavel to these courts.
I suspect the Regency model might be more akin to the early US model
(assuming the nobles have forfeited their judicial function which I\'m
not sure should or could be the case).

> - - Senate term length: 10 years seems like a long term.

Not if you keep in mind the travel times involved.  A senator from
Dunmag in Deneb is going to spend a lot of time just travelling back and
forth to Mora.  This is also the speed at which communication about issues
will travel between the capital and the home district.

Keep in mind that the separation of the military from the political
process is a decidedly modern, Western idea.  For most of human history
and still in many places today the military is a key player in the
political process.  This is also a part of the Imperial tradition.
Remember the Civil War and even the Rebellion.  This latter though,
might have led to some poltical efforts to *limit* the influence of
the military.  This might have been one of the ways the power of the
nobility was weakened.  Much of the power of the nobility has been

Police operations *per se* were the primary responsibility of local
worlds.  The Imperial military serve in police roles with respect to
piracy and the like but most of what we consider to be `crime\' (robbery,
theft, assualt, embezzlement, etc.) was handled by local authorities.

Again, possibly, but this would have to be a *major*, traumatic event.
I don\'t see how it could occur very often or across several different

Yes, of course, but is this somehow more plausible than the mere fact of
Zhodani assistance to prop up Gram?  I don\'t think so.  It also doesn\'t
present as interesting of possibilities as the Zhodani explanation if the
role of the Zhodani changes in TNE.

I\'m glad somebody is enjoying it.  :-)

This is a good point.  Since we\'re examining the Regency it makes since
to use the *POT* figures, doesn\'t it?

Les Howie <lhowie@Prograph.Com>, is this the sort of information we need?
Thanks, Bryan, for making this available.

Gvurrdon sector library data.

Roger Myhre


Aek Elakfough (black cauldron): (Gvurrdon 0439). This system have
experienced an booming belting industry. In 1112 large amounts of
Titanium and Yttrium (latter which are used in the superconductive coils
of the grav vehicle modules). Both of the belts in the system have
proven to be rich on both substances. The number of inhabitants have
exploded since the news got publicly known. This forced the system
owners to build a fairly large spacehabitat. It is a wheel that revolves
to create gravity. It is known under the name of Aek Wheel. The
beltprofiles are: Orbit 1     100m,  n-20 m-70 c-10,  1AU
4       5Km, n-20 m-60 c-20,  0.5AU

Alloulloukde Tosoekh: One of the biggest ship warfs in the Gvurrdon
sector. It is based at Aengvoung (1726). It is reputed for its contact
net for connecting potential buyers to patrons for financing of crafts.
It boast that many of the crafts the Kforuzeng corsair band uses are
bought from them.

Ankhir (Gvurrdon 1728) C6869BB-7  Hi: This system have probably gone
through more hardship than most other systems in Gvurrdon. The
population lives under ground in tunnels. When the system was first
settled for 800 years ago it boasted with an advanced TL 11 technology.
Then the disaster struck. The small government did not succeed in
controlling the masses and civil war broke out. Following this war the
world got splintered between several powerblocks.  With more than 600
years of war and other minor conflicts the TL started to decline when
the harsh environment took its toll on the equipment. The fact is that
the surface temperature of this planet can sink down to - 237M-0C. The
following wars was then the matter of survival for the powerblocks.
About 50 years ago this system did get help from outside by request from
some minor factions. Firstly the helpers was met with resistance, but
later when the other factions had expended their stock of fighting
materiel they had to succumb for outside pressure. From this point the
planet got united under one central government. This planets largest
export articles are a strange sort of algae that lives in the oceans of
this planet. Orrkong, a shrimp like creature is also an export article.


Church of the Chosen One: This is a religious sect which has their base
at Aegadh (Gvurrdon 1317). They are the world rulers there. The sect
believes that the Ancients made the Vargr to populate this part of the
galaxy. The church does not worship the ancients, but just asks the
devotees to be faithful and to trust the church. The church do not have
any holy book as most other churches, but it boast an Ancient artifact
that the church claims to be a two way communicator with the Ancients.
This has not been proven when the artifact is looked up on as holy, and
no one has been allowed to inspect it scientifically. The powerbase of
the church has been waning since it were founded about 300 years ago.
The number of devotees was quite steady during the Rebellion. They did
note a slightly increase in 1125 to 1127, but frorm there the number
dropped steadily. So now they have turned inward, and redirecting their
resources to prove once and for all that the Vargr is the heir to the
Universe.


Denner (expr): Common name for Vargr from Freedom League, or more
commonly named Corsairs\' Den.


Dzen Aeng Kho: (Society of Equals.) This allegiance despite its name are
soldier based. To prove that you can be equal, you have to manage to go
through a dangerous test that could severely cripple those who are
unlucky. All non soldier professions are looked upon as under rated
beings. Medical profession is an exception to this when medics are
important to save the life of a wounded soldier. Anyone can try to
become an equal no matter what his or hers background is. Those who fail
the test is denied access to any soldier career. Even the cubs from an
equal have to prove itself as an equal before a soldier career are open
for the candidate. Equals and non equals are not permitted mate with
each other. The test can be taken anytime during the life, but it is
wise to take it early when young and old have to go through the same
test. The central body of the government are mainly built up by former
military career personnel that have retired active duty. Only equals can
vote in the parliament or run for some sort of governmental office.

REFEREE: For characters that are born in Dzen Aeng Kho, they have to
roll this task before they choose one of the following careers:  Any
military Officer, Leader, Aristocrat and Law enforcer.
Difficult, Willpower
Referee: On a Catastrophic Failure roll 1D+1 and subtract STR, AGL and
CON of the indicated amount. Example: The PC rolls a 4. He must subtract
2 from STR and one from both AGL and CON. For those who manage this task
give a CHA+1. If the parents of the character is rated equal give a -1
on the above task. The parents are rated equal on a roll of 15+ on 1D20


Edge, The (Expr): A terminlogy used of the political state between Thirz
Empire, and Society of Equals. Their "Cold War" status has everyone on
their toes. If a break in the quarantine line it will most likely be in
Society of Equals. They are zealously watching what Thirz Empire do,
rather than watching their border against the Virus. Their oppinions in
The Spinward Assembly are also a conflict. It looks like that they
oppose each others ideas, suggestions just for the spite of it. More
than one time Zhodani representatives had had to cool down the Thirz
Empire representatives. However as there is no-one is holding Society of
Equals in leash they seem to do and say whatever they will. However
everyone are starting to get a bit tired of them. And regency has
started to put on some pressure, but it hasn\'t taken any action, as a
war will surely open the quarantine line for the advance of the Virus.


Extends line contract: A contract between the Oberlindes Lines and the
government on Ougzdaelzoerrgh, Gvurrdon (2040). The contract gives
Oberlindes lines allowance to use the starport on Ougzdaelzoerrgh for
trading and supplying post for starships that are going into the
extends. This contract where vital for the Oberlindes to get when the
recent hostilities between Vargr forces and the DoD forces started in
1117. Oberlindes met much resistance in the Empire when they first took
initiative in mid 1119 to reopen their routes into Gvurrdon, when it got
closed by the hostilities. The line into Gvurrdon sector starts at
Dentus, Spinward Marches (2201).  During the war against the Kedzudh and
Kforuzeng alliance, the Imperial Navy had undercover agents working on
this base. Starport at Ougzdaelzoerrgh got upgraded to type A after
signing a contract with Oberlindes Lines. Oberlindes have a 47% share in
the starport.


Fair Witness: A new type of careers that has appeared in Thoengling
Empire. It all started with a proposition from the Thoengling cemtral
government to train certain high intellect Vargr to mediate in conflicts
and stay in as fair and correct witnesses. After a few years several
corporations started to use fair Witnesses in contract negotiations.
Today anyone can hire a fair witness if they can pay the price. A Fair
Witness will report anything he experiences, without giving his own
oppinion on what did transpire at a given event. Thus sometimes hiring a
fair witness can backfire, because many believe that the fair witness
will give testimony in the customers favor. AM-;Fair witness cost from
2000cr hour to the astronomical millions.


FEKI: An institute that have specialized on educating sophonts that do
not have the capability or money to spend to go to a normal college or
university. FEKI is short for Fo Engragvaegkfu Kuerrgars Ingaez. Which
can be translated to The School of Many Worlds. Costumers are usually
from low populated worlds and/or belts. They support a wide array of
courses that can be taken. From simple courses like drawing to more
demanding things like medical or engineering courses that takes a year
or two to run. The appliances are collected by mail, and a course
package are then sent to the pupil. What the course package contains
depends on the course taken. From just a few books to computer software
or computers specially made for the course taken. Homebase is on Ouse
Faeg/Ksits Uathu Odzuetarug (1724).  During the Virus craze FEKI almost
got bankrupted. All the more advanced courses was not selling when they
relied on computers. However as the fear from the Virus dropped the
costumers came back, and the more advanced courses started to sell
again.


Gnoerrgh Rukh Lloell: (Anti-Rukh coalition). This is a coalition of
worlds that did not rally behind the Great Leader Rukh in 972. Rukh\'s
Charisma forced billions to to his cause. However many worlds rimward of
Saell which had secured economic ties with worlds around Saell, would
not rally to Rukh, so they established Gnoerrgh Rukh Lloell. In the
beginning they did not manage to do much damage to the Rukh Aegz, but in
the latest 10 years several worlds spinward of Saell have pulled out of
the Aegz, when it proved unable to protect the worlds against terrorist
acts and other anti-Rukh operations.  It disappeared as a political
entity in 1123 when Rukh attacked. The war was over in matter of months,
but the mopping up took more than a year. Anti-Rukh managed to deal some
heavy blows to Rukh even when they was outnumbered 15 to one. The reason
for this was the deep undercover groups inside Rukh.


Kfan Uzangou: A periodical newsletter which are distributed through out
the Gvurrdon sector. The newsletter released its first issue in 864
(Imperial). The newsletter fresh and boasting reports soon got popular
in other systems, so that the print had to be increased. In 987 the
format changed from paper to cheap microchip format, which then could be
accessed by most computers. The paper format have not disappeared
totally, but the print is just 4% of total distribution. Kfan Uzangou
(White Fangs) has its main office at Gvurrdon (0821).  In 1127 the
magazine started to distribute to Spinward Marches. However as the treat
from the Virus became apparent, Regency put down a blockade. KU couldn\'t
change to paper format, when this would sky rocket the distribution
cost. KU took then contact with one of the small media distributors of
Spinward Marches, called Spinward Media Expression (SME). They would get
the text on optical readable microfilm, while the interior art and
pictures would be put on ordinary dias. SME would then put the magazine
on holocrystals, or in paper print. In Regency the magazine is
distributed on the Galanglic name White Fangs.


Oulaekho Arms: A weapon producer with its main office and production
plant on Saell. It sells weapons to most worlds in Gvurrdon. The Firm do
also have several subsidaries  around the Spinward part of Gvurrdon.
Gvaeknoks do also have a share in their weapon production plant on
Ghenkerongolu (Gvurrdon 1528). This plant is called Dokhoullae.


Pandrin: (Gvurrdon 2240). This system were the former Oberlindes trading
center for the Gvurrdon sector. But when the Kedzudh invaded the world
in late 1118 Oberlindes had to close down the center and move it to
somewhere else.  Oberlindes has made it clear that they are looking into
reopening their old base here. Local investors are apparently doing
their part to ensure that Oberlindes comes back.


Sibiatl: A minor psionic institute in Gvurrdon. It does not have any
fixed base, when it changes location time to time. The Sibiatl are a
cooperation between the Zhodani and Vargr psionics to broaden the
knowledge of psionics among Vargr in the in the spinward part of
Gvurrdon sector. In addition to teach psionics it gives classes on just
general information.

REFEREE: The Sibiatl are well reputed among the Vargr in the Thirz
Empire. The psionic training courses cost approximate 240,000Cr. and
takes about 5 months. Initial testing cost 12000 credits. An information
course cost 2000 credits, and is held 5 days with 2 hours a day.


Soungadano (Gvurrdon 2414) B671363-A  Lo Ni: Soungadano is a former
prison planet for Thoengling Empire. Some still view it as a prison
planet when some criminals have the choice between selecting a ordinary
sentence or try to re-install their charisma on this planet by working
for a living. The climate is harsh with temperatures above 300M-0C. In the
winter the temperature may sink below -46M-0C. These severe swings in
temperature makes it a dangerous place to live. There is frequently
storms that can easily kill an unwary traveller. The main exports s
compounds and crystals. Animals both dead and alive is also an export
article, buut not a very popular one. The world has been isolated since
the Virus struck. So how the conditions is on the planet at present is
unknown.


Spinward Assembly, The: A crisis council which was established by the
initiative of Archduke Norris in 1132 to coordinate knowledge and
operations in how to fight the Virus. Its presence (The Assembly) has
been quite visible in Gvurrdon, as the Vargr has proven unable to dam up
against the Virus effectively. only in the few latter 20 years that the
Vargr has managed to get on top of the situation by quarantine
restrictions. The assembly got the following members: Regency, Zhodani
Consulate, Aslan Hierate, Thirz Empire, Society of Equals, Thoengling
Empire. In addition several smaller states has observer status in this
assembly. If and when a thrust into the infected areas are going to take
place, this assembly will surely have a hand in the game.


Taknarkag: (Gvurrdon 0630 B370467-A Ni De). This is a single city
planet, which by influence from Goerrg Rukh Lloell (Anti-Rukh
coalition), left the Rukh Aegz alliance. The entire population resides
in a city built only over the last 185 years, by the design of the
famous Vargr architect Voronol. Taknarkag was reputed in the Rukh Aegz
for it brilliant architectural design. Even Humans have copied this city
to an extent. Humans will find the Trading Post bar and nightclub
inviting, when this is designed specially for humans in mind. More
daring humans, or humans which have experience with Vargr clientele and
behavior may use the Kornak Lounge. The navy base are now staffed by the
local militia with a few jump capable ships.


TeeBee (Toothless Bastard [expr, org: re]): An curse originally from
Regency. It was first used against those Vargr that worked as crew on
infected starships. Those Vargr are generally of low Charisma, thus not
very desireable by other Vargr as followers. Used against other Vargr
will certainly spell trouble. The Virus has by itself no Charsima, and
thus no appeal to the common Vargr, but those who are in their employ
voluntarily or not.


The Equality War: This war were fought between the Society of Equals and
Thirz Empire. The war raged from 1111 to 1116. In this war Society of
Equals lost much territory. Society of Equals did also lose their
capitol system, Dzuerongvae (1413), but the rulers managed to escape.
This forced the Society of equals to move the capitol. The new capitol
is now at Taeksoudhanou (1623).


The Glass bond: The alliance between Kedzudh Aeng and Kforuzeng corsair
band were called the Glass Bond, when it appeared fragile when the
allegiance first were signed. However the success the allegiance have
earned in the invasion of The Spinward Marches have apparently
strengthened this allegiance. Imperial analysts speculate that the
allegiance may fall apart now that the forces to Norris have been able
to stop the constant advance of the Vargr. The Glass Bond broke up in
1129, when Kedzudh declared that the campaign in Spinward Marches was a
success, and that further action was not desirable.


Therrg\'s First Reasoning: Therrg is one of the representatives of "The
Spinward Assembly", and represents Thirz Empire. He do also have
connections with Church of the Chosen One. He had a reasoning that has
been quoted to the lenght that it has become a cliche. "If the Virus is
intelligent, why do we then curse It for Its acts that every intelligent
lifeforms has shown a inclination for? Of course because we all bash our
friends head in every now and then does not make Its (Virus) acts more
tolerable. It only explains the entropy of the universe."
Therrg\'s Second Reasoning: "That day the computer talks to me I\'ll throw
it out of the window."
Cptn L. A. Slastinger\'s addition: "Has anyone told him that his office
is underground?"


Thirz Empire: The second largest interstellar state in Gvurrdon. It got
close bonds with Zhodani,and the presence of psi capable vargr here is
large. About 12% off all inhabitants here have been tested and/or
trained. The entire state are viewed as a large client state of Zhodani
by others in Gvurrdon. Zhodani have a large contigent of both military
and economical advisors in this state. The reason to this is that the
Zhodani by its close relationship with the government can limit the
number on corsair raids inside their borders.


Tirrils: An avian alien race native to Tirrokoelaeks (Gvurrdon 1821).
The Tirrils lives at TL 0. Which would classify them as barely sentient.
The Vargr which first took contact with them, hunted them for their fine
feather hide. But when it became evident that the birds were sentient,
all hunting ceased. The Tirrils are protected from hunting. Any killing
of a Tirril for their hide is penalized with death. The Tirrils are
about 150 centimeter high, and got bright colors from blood red to deep
navy blue. The chest and abdomen are generally white or silver grey.
They got a 15 centimeter long beak like a gull and powerful claws they
use to dig in the earth for Lummi roots or insects. What\'s curious about
the Tirrils are that they have excellent mathematical knowledge. Some
are so good that they can calculate the jump coordinates and data for a
distances up to one parsec without the aid of a computer. Some Vargr
merchants use Tirrils onboard their vessels for entertainment and for
their excellent mathematical skill. The language of the Tirrils are
consisting of whistling and body posture. Very few have been able to
learn their language without specific aiding tools as flutes. Those who
have been most successful with learning their language have usually good
musical skill. Most humans may be able to do basic communication with
just whistling with their lips. Vargr have proven unable to communicate
without flutes or language computers. Tirrils can with great difficulty
learn some Vargr languages. But human languages are easier for them to
learn. This is due to the specific development of their vocal cords.
Tirrils are popular on Tirrokoelaegz for their beautiful sing song
skills, and are often employed at taverns and inns for entertainment.
When the Tirrils are lacking manipulators they usually do not wear
clothes or use tools. However a few Vargr corporations have built waldos
that the Tirrils may use. However few do make use of the waldos when
they constrain them from flying.


Tongaesodhongaell massacre: During the Equality war
Tongaesodhongaell/Gvurrdon (1015) were heavily attacked by nuclear and
chemical weapons. Most of those who could not afford the overpriced
tickets out of the system before the attacking fleet reached the world,
got killed in the attack.The world are Interdicted by the Thirz Empire
because of the high radiation level. The world is still interdicted for
reasons unknown. There has also been a number of voices that demand that
the ancestors of the survivors are to be evacuated, but the Thirz Empire
don\'t want to for some reason.


Ukekhaedha: Ukekhaedha which can be translated to: Ritual of Charismatic
honor. This is a duel fought to death. The ritual have its roots from
Fukoezo (Gvurrdon 2702). The ritual have been law regulated the latest
since early 900. This has been done so that the number of duels to the
death was not to going to deplete populace of males, which are the only
gender which can do this ritual. To perform the ritual the offended part
must get approval from the court to do so. If the court finds the
offended part got good reason to re- install his charisma, the ritual is
permitted. However the requester get one week to cool off to see if he
changes his mind.

The ritual is performed like this:
Firstly the combatants undress completely, and donn loincloths. Both get
a gun with one poison dart. The combatants then selects how far from
each other they will stand. The closest range permitted are 7 meters and
21 meters at most. The guns are holstered when the ritual really starts.
First the Oenurzksan (the patient wait) starts. Here the two combatants
tries out wait each other. Sometimes one of the combatants chicken out
and wont go through with the ritual. Longer the wait more Charisma will
the offended part get back, if he wins the duel. He will also get back
more charisma if he is the last to draw the gun to shot when the action
starts. Some even waits until the other one has fired his gun before he
fires his own. If both miss their shots, the duel is ended and the
offended part cannot make another try. If the offender survives he will
not get any benefit than his life. If the offended part survives he may
get back all the charisma depending on how long the wait was and how he
performed overall. If both parts die, the duel is noted as an unresolved
matter and the case is closed. To be permitted to do this type of duel,
you must have experienced a major loss of charisma and economical loss.
Off worlders cannot under any circumstances perform this ritual in a
legal way. There have been some cases where humans have been performing
this ritual illegally, when they have offended a Vargr.


Urukhu: (nation of Urukhu). A former Interstellar empire which consisted
of the following systems: 2806  Ukokhuvoen, 2807  Kaekfesa, 2808
Dorrorue, 2908  Kutsgarrae, 3107  Ozago.

After Urukhu died in 1112 the nation started to collapse. The nation
were on its highest at 1103, when they managed to fend off a attack from
the Thoengling Empire. However the war effort did take its toll on the
Urukhu nation. Urukhu died in an assassination attempt at an age of 54
years. Who which are responsible for the act are unknown, but the Lliegz
corsair band are suspected. The Lliegz band tried to establish two bases
in the nation just after the war with the Thoengling empire. Urukhu
would not have them there, and the constant battle with the corsairs
depleted the limited naval forces even more. The Lliengz corsair band
were splintered in 1116 by internal disputes.


Uthith Fleet: Fleet of the Ekhlle Ksafi (40th squadron) based at Uthith
(Gvurrdon 1738). During the FFW, it occupied Yorbund (Spinward Marches
2403) and Heya (Spinward Marches 2402), but did not press further,
spending much time mopping up and consolidating. After the Gireel Fleet
was destroyed destroyed at beck\'s World, the Imperial 212nd fleet forces
Uthith back. On 252-1109, Admiral Thuekhs negotiated a separate peace
and withdrew the Uthith fleet from Regina subsector. Many vargr veterans
of the heyan occupation commonly have souvenirs, particulary bottles of
fine Heyan liquors.

When the Oekhos tirades, presented through a Vargr entertainment device
called Utovogh wass released. These devices became increasingly popular
in the Ve Ekhlle Ksafi space. Several voices started to demand action
against the Imperials for the defeat during the FFW. However nothing has
happened when the fleet to Ve Ekhlle was virtually non-existent. The
40th squadron did built a lot of new ships in the period 1123 to 1170.
The number of ships quadrupled. This seems much, but when the fleet only
consisted of a handfull of light cruisers, that was bearably
serviceable, the build- up wasn\'t considered a threat by Regency.
However Regency do keep an eye out for trouble.


Voronol Knaergh: (925-1005 Imperial). Famous Vargr architect. He have
designed many buildings in the Rukh Aegz alliance. His pride are the
Taknarkag city, which he used 10 years in drawing. Unfortunately he did
not live long enough to se the first stages of the city being completed.


Wolfpack: A group of infected Vargr ships. As pre-virus vargr starships
was quite low on maintained standard, Vargr ships that has been infected
has their best strenght when they operate in numbers. The onset of the
Virus forced dthe vargr governments to set up stricter standards to
starships. Something that made a post Virus starships more able to
withstand a Virus infection. And also to battle them in a space combat
as their equipment standards are higher than infected crafts.

The groups of Gvurrdon as per 1200 Imperial.

Gvurrdon is filled with different political factions and groups. All got
their own agenda, and goals for the future. This makes it and different
place than most other sectors in charted space. The different outside
groups as Zhodani and Regency add to the confusion. The alliances among
the groups are also difficult to understand at times.

Allez: Remnants of the old Rukh alliance. The Rukh party tried to hold
off long as possible, but when the break did come, they lost all
control. After several years of internal fighting, a loose group of
aristocrat managed to get some kind of control. The alliance  is now
ruled by the aristocrats, but the worlds got some self rule to a limit.
They might not pass new laws without the Allez government gives them
permission to do so. They have over the last years worked with improve
their relations to the surrounding factions, among those Regency.
Zhodani already got an embassy here, from the time Rukh existed.

Church of the Chosen One: This quasi-religious sect has been diminishing
the last 50 years. During the Rebellion, and shortly after it
registrated a small increse in popularity, but the advent of the Virus
changed the opinions again. As a result of this they have closed most of
their centers, turning their resources into finding the Ancients, to
prove once and for all that the Vargr is meant to inherit the universe
after the Ancients.

Dzen Aeng Kho (Society of Equals): A military ruled society, where the
citizens must be rated Equal before they can get voting status, or enter
certain careers. To get rated as Equal the citizen must go through a
test, which can be dangerous. This test is taken at age 16 usually, but
it can be taken later. Non-Equal citizens that did not make the test
might be rated Equal later if they perform excellent in their line of
duty. And this is usually in the military services. SoE do also keep
slaves, but they may not be mistreated.

Gvaeknoks Trade Union: Formed in 1172 when Gvaeknoks got fed up by the
trading difficulties between Thirz Empire, and Society of Equals (SoE).
A new base had to be found. The break up of Rukh gave the right
opportunity to establish a base where Gvaeknoks could keep a political
presence without losing control. The Gvaeknoks Trade Union (GTU) was
formed short after. Gvaeknoks holds the control over the interstellar
government, but the worlds themselves maintain their own government.
Gvaeknoks got even more popular as it invested in different projects to
build up the local economy. Thus Gvaeknoks can buy cheap and sell
expensive to worlds outside GTU.

Kedzudh Aeng: Formed originally to hold corsairs at bay, but formed the
Glass Bond alliance with Kforuzeng in 1116-17. Imperial analysts
concluded that this bond wouldn\'t hold for long, but they were wrong.
After the campaign in Spinward Marches was finished, Kforuzeng started
to look for new markets. Kedzudh worked for improving its relations to
Regency. Kedzudh are still a loose alliance, with the worlds handling
their foreign policy on their own. Only the near presence of the virus
do keep them together today.

Noerrgh Confederate: A dissident group lead by Noerrgh started to get
popular in 1178. By two years it has spread to near lying worlds.
Noerrgh wanted to disband the monarchy of Thirz Empire, but the Royal
Thir Family resisted. Armed conflict broke out, but an armistice was
reached in 1182. Noerrgh Confederate is actually a wobbly alliance. They
don\'t seem to manage to agree on a single item. The only reason that it
still exist might be that Zhodani got some control, with help of Thirz
Empire, over the group. Why Thirz has not moved in and taken control is
not known.

Oberlindes Lines: A Spinward Marches based trade company. They are maybe
the best traders in the sector, not counting Gvaeknoks. As the peace has
been spreading through the rimward reaches of Gvurrdon Oberlindes are
looking into reopening their base at Triad, that got closed in 1117.
Further expansion into Gvurrdon are also planned, but there is a few
problems. Kforuzeng got quite a presence in the rimward portion.
Economic analysts just wait on the day that Emissary the Oberlindes
trade cruiser will clash with the light cruiser of Kforuzeng, Ozarr.
Gvaeknoks do also close their borders for Oberlindes, making a coreward
expansion difficult.

Regency: Doesn\'t have any direct presence in Gvurrdon, but keeps
emissaries around in the different groups to know what is happening.
They got best relations with Thoengling and Rueks Legacy. The relations
to Kedzudh and Ve Ekhlle Ksafi are also softening up.

Rroerz Uerra: This is actually what is left of Anti-Rukh coalition. When
the Rukh war was over, these worlds rebuilt their society. Helped by a
Zhodani backed Rroerz political party. The Zhodani presence has been
fading the last few years, but still there.

Rueks Legacy: One of the splinter groups of old Rukh. they hold a small
base, and try to stay out of trouble. To protect their worlds, they have
hired ships from 40th squadron. Repeating raids from Corsair\'s Den saw
to this.

The Freedom League: Also called Corsair\'s Den by outsiders. Kforuzeng
has control over this alliance, even on local world government level.
However not full control. Kforuzeng tried to take full control, but
found it too difficult, and that they could loose Charisma on it.
However after Kforuzeng took over the situation on the worlds became
actually better. Many corsair groups sought to Kforuzeng after this.
Corsairs that visit this place can come and go as they like, far as they
do not break any rules here. No one asks questions where the wares comes
from. The trade taxes are also quite low.

Thirz Uerra: An Interstellar Monarchy formed with the help of Zhodani.
The worlds got independence in that way that they can choose their own
local government, but the monarchy with its appointed governors do the
interstellar policy. This part of Gvurrdon holds a large percentage of
the Psionic capable Vargr. They fought the Equality war against SoE from
1111 to 1116. Where upon SoE lost much territory. It maintains good
relations to most factions in Gvurrdon, excepted for SoE, where a cold
war status is at hand.

Thoengling Raghz: Has always had good relations with the Empire, and
continue to nurture this through Regency. It is maybe the interstellar
state that has suffered most from the Virus. First they managed to keep
it at bay, but a breakthrough forced the Thoengling Navy to withdraw.
The Capital was lost in matter of weeks. Now there is only a handful
worlds left from this state, which once was the biggest is Gvurrdon.

Ve Ekhlle Ksafi (40th Sqr): One of the alliances that participated in
the FFW against the Imperium in 1107 to 1110. The government is a strict
military rule, but the individual worlds has gotten more to say the
latest years. The reason for this might be by the pressure from Regency
because of the Virus. Ve Ekhlle Ksafi doesn\'t like Regency much, but it
is not strong enough to make a dent in Regency\'s armor. The fleet
capability of Ve Ekhlle Ksafi has been built up over the years, but
still small compared to other groups.

Zhodani: Their aims for the Gvurrdon sector has changed over the years.
As their long time allied Rukh disappeared, Zhodani had to move in with
force to prevent that Zhodani owned industry didn\'t get caught in the
middle. However they was not able to prevent that Rukh broke up, maybe
for the best. As Zhodani sought after to control the groups along their
border to keep them safe, it got easier now that the tension in this
area of space loosened. It did also get easier to deal with the
different worlds after Rukh disappeared. Zhodani has opened quite a lot
of trade missions in Gvurrdon the latter 20 years.

d Xienners can\'t shape change at all.

This shape change would have made them perfect soldiers, but they are
friendly and peaceful. Their culture is closely related to the nature,
even for their high technology. Killing can only be done in necessity.
This has made them the perfect diplomats, which are sought after in
Gvurrdon and surrounding areas. Another feature is the total lack if
Psionics. They can\'t utilize psionics at all, and try to mindread them
is futile.


Tirril

An avian alien race. The Tirrils lives at TL 0. Which would classify
them as barely sentient. The Vargr which first took contact with them,
hunted them for their fine feather hide. But when it became evident that
the birds were sentient, all hunting ceased. The Tirrils are protected
from hunting. Any killing of a Tirril for their hide is penalized with
death.

The Tirrils are about 150 centimetre high, and got bright colors from
blood red to deep navy blue. The chest and abdomen are generally white
or silver grey. They got a 15 centimetre long beak like a gull and
powerful claws they use to dig in the earth for Lummi roots or insects.

What\'s curious about the Tirrils are that they have excellent
mathematical knowledge. Some are so good that they can calculate the
jump coordinates and data for a distances up to one parsec without the
aid of a computer. Some Vargr merchants use Tirrils onboard their
vessels for entertainment and for their excellent mathematical skill.

Tirrils are popular in various parts of Gvurrdon for their beautiful
sing song skills, and are often employed at taverns and inns for
entertainment.

When the Tirrils are lacking manipulators they usually do not wear
clothes or use tools. However a few Vargr corporations have built waldos
that the Tirrils may use. However few do make use of the waldos when
they constrain them from flying.


Ungrest

This race descend from a desert dwelling carnivore. It got a thick hide,
almost chitin like in substance. They are somewhat hunched. When rolled
up they are totally hidden behind their shell like back, which gives
them very good protection. Their appearance is almost insect like, which
can scare the hell out of unwary travellers. They are quite small and
stocky, but not clumsy, even when they may seem like it. Even before the
Vargr contacted this race, they had acquired tech enough to start a
space programme. The first contact with Vargr, and Humans accelerated
this process.

They claim to have developed jumpdrive on their own, but this has not
been confirmed. However they are not able to use the jump technology to
its fullest. So in this field they are still on tech 9. The reason for
this is that the Ungrest can\'t survive the jump for some strange reason.
But the Ungrest do use so called unmanned jump launches, which actually
are crafts rangingfrom 100 to 300 ton. These are used to move supplies
fast through the system, and to the neighbouring system that they have
started to colonize. The Ungrest move through interstellar space with
SLD ships, powered by a ram scope.

The Ungrest is quite aggressive, but not outright hostile. Various
merchants do trade with them, but any technology is unavailable, when it
is much specified for the race. And the Ungrest is unwilling to sell out
technology to inferior traders. This might stem from a paranoia that
they are afraid of that the tech might be turned against them. However
there is possible to buy lot of other non- technical stuff like
foodstuffs, and art.


Bzruellokh

This race stems from an world which are quite chilly, which explains
their heavy built due to insulating fat. Descendants from
omnivore/gatherers which evolved on the great steppes of this planet.
They are massing about 95kg, the females a bit less. Their legs are
short with broad feet, that prevents them from sinking too deep into the
snow. Their early forefathers had quite a lot of body hair, which
disappeared when the Bzruellokh started using clothing to protect them
further from the chill. Their arms are long, reaching down to the knees
when they stand upright, and powerful. Their skin resembles that of a
human, but is rougher and thicker. The skin color ranges from white to
yellowish. Their arms and head is covered with thick white hair. The
face holds two small eyes which are set deep into the skull. The ears
resembles that of a rabbit, but is a bit broader.

From what is usual among other races, Bzruellokh does have a peculiar
rhythm. Their pre-sentient ancestors hibernated during the winter,
gathering food in the summer. Thus they almost never sleep half of their
local year. In a modern society this is quite difficult, but this
hibernating are still being done. But the cycles are more controlled, so
that their society still works, even in the winter. Their starships got
special hibernation modules, for crew or owners that are due for they
hibernation cycle. The fact is that the Bzruellokh gets sick if it can\'t
hibernate over certain period. Drugs can prolong the wake time between
hibernation, but are used sparingly.


Opliaraz

Descendants from omnivore scavengers that was cave dwellers. The latter
has given them sight that spans from visible light to the infrared
spectrum. They got large black eyes. Matter of fact the pupils are the
only part of the eye visible. Their size is small compared to humans,
with an average height of 145cm. They got bat like ears that can be
moved towards a sound. This coupled with their wide field of vision,
that is 220 degrees gives them a superior surveillance capability
compared to most other sentient races.

Their society is built around the family, which forms a clan. When the
Vargr contacted these the first time, they were hunted for their fur.
Even when they had advanced into the iron age. This hunting was stopped
some hundred years ago, by a group of resourceful explorers. However the
Opliaraz is still xenophobic about outsiders. Those who wants to do
business in this system should do it through the Aelluengh Mercantile
Company, which is the only company the Opliaraz will trade with. The
reason for this is that the Aelluengh is owned by the ancestors of those
who helped the Opliaraz from extinction.

Gvurrdon Sector codes, and UWP codes.



Gvurrdon subsectors has no official names in the Vargr extends, but they
are named by the Imperial IISS for the
purpose of easy reference to a given part of the space. Thus most
subsectors in Gvurrdon has been given the
names of leading Vargr consentration in the subsector (if known). Given
the strange behavior of the Vargr, some
of these subsectors may have other rulers  now than then, when the names
were thought up.  The exception of this
rule are those sub sectors that borders to the Regency, where the old
Imperial mapping standards are more
common.

The sub sector names are:

Sorry for the heavy quoting but I think this provides a great opportunity
to examine just how the Traveller government codes might be improved so
that they are less arbitrary and therefore more useful.

I\'ve mentioned this before but, IMHO, it is uesful when examining a
government type to look at two issues: the *nature* of authority (who
rules) and the *source* of authority (who consents to that rule, or
who *is* ruled).

The keys here from a definition standpoint are the two suffixes *-archy*
and *-cracy*.  These are often used interchangeably to mean "rule".  They
are sometimes used to mean the same thing as in "monarchy" and "autocracy"
which are often seen as meaning "single or self rule".  Generally though,
the suffix *-archy" is used to denote a ruler or a system of rulers 
("matriarch", "hierarchy") while the suffix *-cracy* is used to denote
the source of rule ("technocracy", "aristocracy", "theocracy").

It is useful to look at the distinction between the two suffixes when they
are used with the same prefix, say, "demarchy" and "democracy".  Demarchy
is used to distinguish actual, direct rule by the people, or *demos*, (through
referrenda and the like) as opposed to democratic rule based merely upon
the *consent* of the people in which actual authority may be placed in the
hands of some representative group or person.

When viewed in this fashion the *nature* of authority can have only three
manifestations: a single ruler (autarchy), a group of rulers (oligarchy),
or rule by the entire *demos* (demarchy).  Similarly, the *source* of
authority has only two manifestations: either it comes from the ruler(s)
themselves (autocracy) or else it is based upon the consent of the *demos*
(democracy).

This gives the following five government types:

- -Autocractic autarchy: rule by a single individual without *any* consent
  of the governed group.  Obviously this can only occur in *very* small
  groups where the `ruler\' is able to exercise direct, personal control 
  over the `ruled\', say, a parent-child relationship or a captor-prisoner
  relationship.
- -Autocractic oligarchy: rule by a group of individuals without any consent
  of the governed group.  Again, this can only occur in small groups where
  the `rulers\' can exercise direct, personal control over the `ruled\', say
  bankrobbers holding bank employees hostage.
- -Democractic autarchy: rule by a single individual based upon the consent
  of the governed.  This fits our conceptions of a `traditional\' monarchy
  but actually it also can only occur over relatively small groups, say
  a company or a small military organization.  (It\'s how Jean-Luc Picard
  rules the starship *Enterprise*.)
- -Democractic oligarchy: rule by a group of individuals based upon the 
  consent of the governed.  This permits the rule of large groups such as
  modern nation states.  In this case, the rulers are not just the exective
  and legislative figures at the top of the government but the entire system
  or regulators, tax collectors, police enforcers, etc. that exercise
  authority in the `government\'.  This form may sometimes be very oppressive
  (the Iranian `theocracy\' came to power in a popular revolt and continues
  to enjoy a great deal of consent among a majority of the *demos*) but it
  is unable to continue once the consent of the *demos* is lost (hence
  the collapse of the Soviet Union).
- -Demarchy (democractic demarchy is redundant): direct rule by the *demos*.
  This is very difficult to accomplsh on a large scale but is facilitated
  by the advent of high technology which permits quick and broad disemination
  of information.  (Imagine a instantaneous global communications network
  that would permit `real time\' discussion and voting on governmental issues.)

In the Earth Colonies campaign we have developed the following table to
generate UWP government codes using this scheme:

Government (Throw 2D-5 + pop)
Digit   Government
0-      none
1       autocratic autarchy
2       demarchy
3       autocratic oligarchy
4-6     democratic oligarchy
7       no central authority
8-9     democratic oligarchy
A-B     democratic autarchy
C+      democratic oligarchy

Higher population worlds almost exclusive have `democractic\' governments
because of the inability of any single individual or group of individuals
to directly, personally exercise authority over the rest of the populace.

This system leaves the actual characterization of the populace\'s consent
to authority up to the referee (or at least independent of population).
A Code C `democractic oligarchy\' may be a "theocracy", a "technocracy",
a "plutocracy", or a `representative democracy\'.  Which seems to make
sense since there is no clear relationship between these sorts of charcteri-
zations and the *size* of the particular *demos* involved.

Observations, questions and contrary views are solicited and encouraged.

I\'m sorry you think so. I haven\'t felt acrimonious in this debate (until

If you\'re really prepared to argue that all the population levels and
population multipliers in the Spinward Marches could possibly remain intact
for 15 years of peaceful development, much less Vargr raids galore, then 
I\'m dropping out of that discussion. Think about what you\'re saying for 
just a moment. No world increased it\'s population by as much as 10%? No
world lost as much as 10% in a raid? They all remained at _exactly_ the
same population? Every single one of them?

You don\'t need TNE. I\'m talking CT and MegaT. I\'ve ignored TNE because I
anticipated the argument that the years from 1120 to 1200 represent rather
unusual circumstances.

There\'s no way all 400 worlds in the Spinward Marches could have had their
population level totally stagnant for 15 years. some of them, sure. Not
even most of them, but some. Since the data in _Imperial Encyclopedia_
and _Megatraveller JOurnal 3_ dosen\'t show these changes, the data on 
population must derive from the same census. Perhaps no new census was
made between 1105 and 1120. Other parts of the UPP may have been updated.
But as far as the population data goes, the three sources is one and the
same.

Good for you. I can\'t. Not for the Marches, whose culture in most every
Traveller publication to date has been shown to be overwhelmingly solomani-
style, and certainly not for the Sword Worlds who are spcifically _said_
to be Solomani-derived.

Sure. That\'s propably why we haven\'t seen any technological downturns in
the wake of economic downturns here on Earth. I admit that there will be
a cushioning effect so that you could propably maintain TL B for a while,
since the investment in the factories and tools have been made. But
factories have to be maintained too. And if noone can afford to buy the
stuff the factories produce, why maintain them? And how? Try imagining
economic boom cycles scaled to an interplanetary population, rather than
a single planet population. If a depression is severe enough, the
factories will close.

How severe? That\'s the whole point, isn\'t it? A planet with billions of
inhabitants may be difficult to affect... but maybe not too dificult if 
you have even more billions of people to do it.

Recall that our only

Seems to me I\'ve heard about factories in third-world countries that have
closed down after the parent company has pulled out. Admittedly I can\'t
quote any examples.

Has anyone else noticed that X-ray lasers are even deadlier for their size if
gravitic focusing is not used.  The effective range on a TL13+ X-ray laser
barbette is 15 hexes, without using gravitic focusing.  This isn\'t all that 
bad.  The big advantage is that it has an 85% efficiency (at TL15), instead
of 20%.  The biggest thing in the turret is the HPG, so a much higher energy
can be reached with the higher efficiency.

Here is a TL15 X-ray laser barbette design.  It isn\'t manned.

Energy 1400MJ.  Input energy 1650MJ.

Focal Array             22.4 tons       22.4 kl         4.48 MCr
HPG                     15.5 tons       57.75 kl        .5775 MCr
Beam Pointer (10 Hex)   3 tons          3 kl            .3 MCr

This totals 140.9 tons, 83.15 kl, 5.3575 MCr.  At 100 shots per turn it draws
92 MW. Combat performance is as follows:

10: 94-1/30     20: 70-1/22     40: 35-1/11     80: 18-1/6

This has better performance at short and medium range than Roger Myhre\'s design
(6/11, message 7956) of a 423 MJ TL15 gravitically focused, unmanned barbette, 
which had 51-1/16 out to 80 hexes.  It has much better performance at these 
ranges than the Brilliant Lances designs.  If you are willing to sacrifice long
range performance, leave out the gravitic focusing and use X-ray lasers.

In response to Roger Myhre\'s discussion of antimatter missiles:

Warheads for antimatter missiles wouldn\'t be all that small.  If you wanted a 
non-impact warhead that could actually damage a ship, it would have to be 
pretty large.  assuming we can get a missile within 100 km of the target, this
is 10e7 cm.  the energy per cm^2 is about 10e-15 of the blast energy at this 
range.  To do one point of damage to a square cm, going by the FF&S guideline 
that the effective range of a laser is where the energy is distributed over a 
square cm, we need to deliver about a megajoule to a square cm, requiring on 
the order of a megaton (1 megaton = 4.2e15 Joules).  This requires about 50 
grams of antimatter, and it still has no hope of penetrating armor.  it could 
damage surface features, but the energy would probably be too diffuse to do 
much.  if a spot on a surface feature can withstand a 1 MJ laser easily, all a 
1 megaton blast is going to do is lightly toast the outside of the ship.  :)

Either a much bigger warhead is needed, or the missile needs to get closer.
The consensus seems to be that impact missiles would be shot down easily.  
Signifcant damage might be done by a warhead in the tens or hundreds of 
megatons, but that would require more than a kg of antimatter.  manufacturing 
the stuff isn\'t exactly easy...  Well the warhead is pretty small, if you want
to waste all that antimatter in a marginal weapon.

 Others?

SUBSECTOR MAPS AND UWP DATA

I would suggest a typical subsector on each of the Regency frontiers: the
Zhodani frontier (Jewell), the Vargr frontier (Regina, Aramis, or Pretoria),
the Virus frontier (Lamas, Dunmag or Usani) and the Aslan *ihatei* frontier
(Tobia, Gazulin, Pax Rulin or Glisten).  The capital subsector, Mora, would
be representative of the Regency \'core\'.  Maybe a subsector in the Deneb Wilds?

Let\'s follow the *Path of Tears* format with Imperial Era (IE) and Post-
Imperial Era (PIE) UWP stats.

MAJOR WORLDS OF THE REGENCY

Major worlds ought to be Mora/Mora, Deneb/Usani, Gazulin/Gazulin,
Regina/Regina, Rhylanor/Rhylanor, Glisten/Glisten, Lintl/Vestus,
Pretoria/Pretoria, Magash/Sabine, Vincennes/Vincennes and Lunion/Lunion.

Any other candidates?

REGENCY LANGUAGE

Anyone care to offer a few examples of Riftian jargon after 70 years of
divergence from Galanglic?

REGENCY MEGACORPS

Delgado Trading (miniturization, heavy mining & refining, publishing and
   trading)
- -A key player in the war against the Virus.

General Products (starships, non-starships, heavy machinery)
- -Quality problems were threatening existence by Rebellion.  Domain/Regency
 susbsidies would be likely in order to maintain a major shipbuilder (cf.
 the Chrysler bailout).

GSbAG (starships)
- -Probably doing well equipping the Quarantine Service and the Deneb Navy.

Hortalez et Cie (banking and investment)
- -With addition of Zirunkariish assets most likely dominates Domain.

Instellarms (military products)
- -Probably doing well, although mercenary actions can be expected to be
 limited in Deneb by government efforts to conserve resources.  Can be
 expected to favor the Expansionists and Santanocheevists.

Ling Standard Products (mining, electronics and computers, starships,
   starship systems, power generation, small arms)
- -Probably the primary commercial and military contractor combating the Virus.

SuSAG (chemicals, pharmaceuticals, geneering, extra-Imperial psi drugs)
- -Will the illegal psi drug manufacturing move into the Regency?  Obviously,
 SuSAG will support the Tolerant bloc, if not openly then certainly with
 financial backing.

Sternmetal Horizons (mining, manufacturing, power generation, food processors)
- -Probably doing well.

Tukera Lines (shipping)
- -Probably still active and possibly a supporter of the Imperialist bloc.

Vilani Bureaux (probably not active in Deneb after the Collapse):
  Makhidkarun
  Sharurshid
  Naasirka (assets acquired by LSP?)
  Zirunkariish (assets acquired by Hortalez)

End of Part I

Parts II (~16K), III (~13K) and IV (~26K) are quite large.  I\'ll hold off
posting them for a few days to give anyone who\'d rather not see them a chance
to object.  Maybe someone who knows how would be willing to post them to an
ftp site.  Let me know by direct e-mail and I\'ll mail them to you.

This is where I\'m tempted to become a tad acrimonious. I\'ll try to hold
it down, but it\'s a little hard to provide definitions of what I\'m 
talking about and then having them dismissed as "not relevant". If you
have any authorities on feudal Europe that informs you that the feudal
lords didn\'t really care about formalities, could you quote them for
me, please? If you can\'t, don\'t you think you just might consider the
possibility that the old feudal system actually worked in some way
at least remotely related to the teory?

Even if you are right, for which you presented absolutely no evidence, it\'s
also possible that if someone looked at a new type of government and called 
it \'feudal\' something, they might be having dictionary definitions in mind
too.

Because a feudal society is one where the feudal lord gives out land fiefs 
in return for allegiance and support. By analogy a feudal technocracy is
one where the lord gives out industrial fiefs in support for allegiance
and support. Gee, I could have sworn I said this before. 

>>Let\'s get a few definitions

That\'s great. That means you got half my argument. These definitions 
focus on land because that\'s what the people in feudal Europe focused 
on. The second half of my argument substitutes industrial holdings for
land in order to derive a definition of a feudal _technocracy_ and assumes 
an analogous treatment of those holdings.

>Is that where our disagreement lies?  I grant the `ownership of land\' by

That seems to be the problem in a nutshell. You don\'t see it. Why? What do
you know that I don\'t? From where do you derive your deep insight into how
feudal Europe REALLY worked? Tell me what books I\'ve missed.

Is this something you just know? Who told you? Not the dictionary. Did
you read it in a book? Quotes, please.

I just don\'t see how the shareholders in your description of a feudal
technocracy acts any different from the shareholders in any other
system with corporations. The standard capitalist society, for example.
Where does the feudal come into it?

>>>In a feudal technocracy there are several *different*

How? Why? They elected him (well 51+% of them did). They can fire him any
time they want to. Legally. They employ him. Where\'s the fealthy in that?

>This is akin to a medieval situation in which a single individual had risen 
>to the top of the feudal structure, a king.  

The king\'s vassals have all sworn to support him. Did the shareholders 
swear to support their Chairman? No. They offered him a good salary and
a pension plan. Not fealthy.

>Maybe the difference here is that you\'re looking at, say, Gram,
>as medieval Germany, while I\'m at looking the entire Sword Worlds as all of
>medieval Europe?

At the moment I\'m not looking at the Sword worlds at all. I\'m looking at
the whole concept of feudal technocracy. Of which I have several times
said: "By analogy, a feudal technocracy is one where industrial holdings
takes the place of land". I then presented a definition of a feudal
society. Let\'s have your definitions. Not examples, since I\'m apparently
to dim to understand them. Straight definitions.

Take an early feudal society. See a knight who holds a manor from a baron.
See him give two fingers to his baron. See his baron take his (the baron\'s)
manor back from the knight and decorate the gate with the knight\'s head.

Why do you maintain that? What facts do you base this on? How come you
know more than the dictionary (Not just a snide question. Dictionaries
have been known to be wrong. But I do feel that the burden of proof is
on you in this case. Why do you think feudal society differed so 
radically in theory and practice? Let\'s have some reasons).

Oh, are you? That means that you can quote me reams of examples of how
things really worked in practice, while I won\'t be able to find very 
many examples of thing working according to the mere theory, right?
Would you care to begin?

>I think my focus is more useful in trying to

>feudal technocracy of Traveller.

I will tentatively agree that this seems reasonable. Ignoring for the
moment the possibility that \'feudal technocracy\' is defined in terms
of the theory of feudal society instead of the practice. So let\'s hear
about this practice.

>>Look, the shareholders in a corporation is a conglomerate owner.
> 
>No.  The shareholders are a morass of different interests just like the
>various vassals of a medieval lord.

The shareholders of a corporation makes the same decisions a sole owner
of a company makes. The only difference between a corporation and a
non-corporation is that the first has shareholders where the second 
has an owner. I repeat: the shareholders in a corporation is a 
conglomerate owner.

>>In theory they make up one person, the owner of the corporation.
> 
>Again, I don\'t think talking about theory is particularly useful.

I suggest you make up your mind on that on a case by case basis. Certainly 
any great difference between theory and practice makes relying on the 
theory problematical. But what is the great, yawning chasm between theory 
and practice in this instance? Why are shareholders not like an owner? 
(And why is a raven like a writing desk? ;-)

>>The Chairman works
>>for the owner. The vassals \'works\' for the king. See the difference?

>In practice there is *no* difference.  In *practice* the medieval king
>`works\' for the vassals in provinding coordinated security services 

This is where I say "No he dosen\'t!", right? 

>just as the technocratic king works for the shareholders in providing 
>coordinated profit services.  

And just how does the technocratic king (your version) differ from the
Chairman of a corporation? If there isn\'t any difference then why have
two seperate names for the same system?

>The medieval vassals provided military
>service *and* taxes and the technocratic vassal provides financial
>capital.  The two situations are *very* analogous, IMHO.

The medieval vassals provided various kind of service in return for 
holding the land. The people you describe acquire their holdings
and band together for mutual benefit. The first is a feudal system.
The second is just a gang.

>>A fief has _one_ owner.
> 
>Just as any single bloc of shares has *one* owner.

Sigh. OK, let\'s try to get past the redundancy into something constructive.
This bloc of shares you\'re talking about. Does it have any sort of 
coherence? Is it all shares in one single corporation, or is it simply
a portfolio? Is it possible to put a lable on the bloc and call it 
something other than \'Martin Vesterlund\'s current stock portfolio\'? Can
it be called \'The barony of Thorvallsmines\' and is there a specific baronial 
title associated with it? Can the title be transferred to someone else by 
sale or inheritance? Can the bloc be sold off in small bits, and if it does, 
what happens to the title? 

>>A baron can\'t sell off shares of his barony to make the buyers part-barons 
>>of the fief (He may be able to sell bits of the fief, but these bits then

>Exactly.  Just as purchasers of shares gain title to their own new fief!

Who decides on the new title? And if a \'fief\' is just a stock portfolio,
what\'s the difference between this system and any capitalist society?

Like the Isle of Man?

>It\'s not part of a feudal system either.

Why not?

So the baronies you\'re talking about has nothing to do with the examples
we see in _Space Viking_? (All the fiefs we hear named are owned by one
single person apiece  -  what you claim to be isolated baronies that are
not part of the feudal structure (this might surprise Duke Angus to learn)).

You DO mean a stock portfolio! How do you figure out the baronial titles?

OK. I arrive on Gram with a draft for a billion credits in my back pocket. 
For that I buy 10% of Megatronics, 30% of Dynaline, 51% of Gombril Spaceyards 
and 1% of a half dozen more (Assume for purposes of argument that I can find 
people willing to sell). Now. What\'s my title? Who is my liege lord? Who are 
my vassals? What\'s my rights and what\'s my obligations?

>>Nope. The central tenet of feudalism is *service* as a medium of repayment.
> 
>Again, you\'re arguing feudal *theory* and I\'m arguing feudal *practice*.

Again you dismiss evidence without any further argument.

>Medieval vassals paid taxes to their lords.

Some medieval vassals paid part of their service in money. All of them
paid some or all of it in service.

>It seems to me you\'re still focused on a single company.  

I am. The company is IMO the FT equivalent of the feudal land holding.
Like Karvalmills is one holding. Traskon is one. Etc.

>A feudal technocracy has to involve the *entire* economy.  

It does. Each company is a fief, owned by a nobleman. All the fiefs 
together constitutes the entire economy.

>fiefs under Traskon and `geological service\' fiefs under Karvalmills, 

Propably? What makes you say that? Where does it even imply that anywhere
in the book?

It wasn\'t the sole basis, granted. But neither was it in early feudal
Europe. In an early feudal system each lord is independent. But they 
are lords because they have vassals. They band together for mutual
protection, promising to support the king. Eventually they king assumes
ownership of their land.

What do you base that on? I base my argument on the analogy between a
medieval barony and what I believe to be the feudal technocratic 
equivalent of such a barony. The fact is that Trask did sell the 
whole thing. And that it was called "The Barony of Traskon", not "Lucas 
Trask\'s holdings".

True. And if a society you imagine to be a feudal one allows such things

No. He gained enough strength to deal with an arch enemy. The operative

Gram, it must be a decisive advantage. And Harald must be willing to
pay the price of using it.

No, I\'m arguing that since Sacnoth hasn\'t moved against Gram just maybe
Harald hasn\'t been able to find supporters among the other Sword Worlds.
And/or perhaps he dosn\'t dislike Anders as much as Angus hated Omfray.

Bingo! There\'s the fallacy. The teacher\'s union dosen\'t become a vassal,

Of course they do. you\'d expect an owner, even just a part owner, to have

In a capitalist society CEO Akers isn\'t a lord, he is an employee of the

technocracy he would be a vassal (He wouldn\'t be a vassal of any pension
fund, though. In fact, he\'d propably be a duke and may or may not be
independent. And IBM wouldn\'t be a corporation, but a company/fief).

I certainly am. So did a lot of feudal lords. Look at the whole business
of the civil war between Stephen of Blois and the Empress Maud. Some
lords, like Geoffery de Manderville, played fast and loose with their oaths
and their allegiance, but lot\'s of noblemen actually acted on the \'theory\'.

He propably was. Angus and Omfray were both sovereign lords.

They don\'t? I thought they owned a big slice of IBM? Why don\'t they have
any right to do so? And if they don\'t, how did they manage it, and why 
isn\'t this Akers person suing the pants off them?

You keep saying that, but how does it work? Start with the basic building

differently from a garden variety capitalist society.

Why not? You have a world. The world is a feudal technocracy. They produce
a king. The king sez: "No sale of industry to outsiders. Dixit". They just
happen to have a balanced economy. How are they vulnerable? And don\'t say 
that I don\'t know that Gram is like that. I know I don\'t (I can\'t have both
economic fluctuations and a balanced economy). What I want to know is, why 
couldn\'t it possibly be? Why MUST Gram be vulnerable?

It worked for Angus in one particular combination of strength and allies.
Dosn\'t mean it would work for Sacnoth in another situation. (Actually, it d
idn\'t work for Angus, btw. He blew it in the end. But it could have if he
hadn\'t been crazy).

Absolutely, the Virus is just too dangerous to the Regency to not fight 
it with all possible assets.  Quarentine is one portion of what I 
conceive of as a multi-layered defense.  Naval Vessels play a critical 
role in destroying the Virally infected "Vampires".  The Navy must be 
able to at an absolute minimum disable a vampires j-drive and 
communications.  Most electronics in the regency should be "V-hardened" 
by now but we shouldn\'t take chances.

I can\'t see any other way for the Regency\'s Military to respond.  Even 
today we depend on very sophisticated computer controlled electronic 
devices to wage modern war.  This trend will probably continue until at 
TL 15 it would be hard to perform any sort of Military function above the 
skirmish level without extensive computer support.  The threat Virus 
poses to these processes should be obvious...

I don\'t imagine that these weapons are widely available but I wouldn\'t be

Smallpox waiting around in govt. labs just in case...

BTW, Finding this secret Virus lab could be quite an adventure...

Basicly it looks like the only additional threats are either from the

from this I\'ll look at building a new force structure.  If you like it 
add it to your sourcebook.

The difference is that a sole proprietor has day-to-day decision making

corporation\'s senior management is vested with the day-to-day decision
making power.  The senior managers are employees appointed by the directors,
who are elected by the shareholders (but usually proposed to the
shareholders by management).  Thus there is quite a gap between ownership
and control in the corporation, which does not exist in the sole
proprietorship.

I hope this clarifies or obfuscates the argument.

at first a big thanks to Roger "StarWolf" Myhre for the Laser table. I\'m glad
someone did the work for me ;-). Roger, can you tell me if the Focal Arrays 
are designed to stand overpowered ROFs?

Ted Baltz issued the following comment on this tabel and Lasers in general:

You are right. This even gets better if you use higher TLs than 16. This is
especially true for Laser Lances, because I tend to use very small fighters
(less than 9 tons) and the main problem is Power there. So using Focal arrays
without gravitic focussing has the advantage of less power consumption. The
disadvantage of short ranges can be canceled by the small size of the fighter.
If you check, you will find that a fighter of less than 10 tons equiped with
EMM has +2 Diff Mod to get a target lock on, and +1 Diff mod to shoot on.

That is: To get a traget lock on such a fighter is a Formidable Task, even at
short range. And if the fighter has EMS Jammer fitted it even gets harder to
achieve a lock.

I must admit I use Thruster plates in my designs, so I don\'t have troubles with
fuel.

Maybe its because my TCS is not at hand, but I am having trouble interpreting

I\'m not. Just keeping up with TML and XTML is more than I can handle
right now.  For those of you awaiting list change and drop requests, my

Interesting. Maybe we can come up with some doctrine where this kind of

Hmmmm someone know the science it seems. Ok it maybe wasn\'t that great
idea after all. But there are a few things that may make it useful. And
that is expanding gasses from the explotion. Will the gasses have any
effect on the ship? And what about electromagnetic pulses. If they are
present, they may blind out the sensors, and much of the other
electronics in a ship, making it effectively blind for combat purposes.

This is my Mcr .000000002 worth.

The ETC guns continue to dominate up to about TL 12, even then they rival 
Mass Drivers due to the latters high power requirements.  However MDs at 
TL 12 can fire small bore penetrators at energies rivaling ETC guns of 
much larger bore.  This enables the vehicle to carry large numbers of 
these rounds (in some cases, four times the number of CPR rounds of the 
same energy) making ammo last considerably longer.  In the next 
supplement, I will detail Mass Drivers intended as primary armament on 
haevy AFV\'s starting at developmental TL 11 on up to TL 15.

In fact here is a quick index

I) MBT main guns  CPR
II) MBT main guns MD
III) MBT main guns Directed Energy
IV) Secondary Weapons 
        A)Secondary Guns (< 3MJ)
        B)Missile Systems
        C)Point Defenses

This of course may change quite a bit, oh well

a surface feature or armor is its ability to conduct heat away from
the place where the laser is hitting so the temperature doesn\'t get
too high.  This is not of particularly too much help when half the
hull is recieving energy at the same time.  

1MJ/cm^2 is a pretty high energy density.  Enough in fact, to melt 34
cm of iron.  Even assuming a really polished surface and better
properties than Iron, this is going to really screw up your average
antenna.  And a 10MT antimatter warhead is a lot cheaper I\'m sure than
some ship designed to clean off the antennas from an enemy ship.
Heck, fusion weapons that size aren\'t too hard or expensive to build.
Certainly a 10MT weapon is going to be unfriendly.  I doubt your
antenna can take the energy involved with vaporizing 3.4m of iron.  I
don\'t have TNE but I doubt that the antenna arrays weigh enough that
you can claim that they have enough mass/thickness to withstand that,
and it strikes me as unlikely that the entire hull of the ship is
thermally superconducting.

Exploding missiles also have the advantage that it\'s easier to hit
with them than with det lasers.  (Oh, look, the missile is within
100km, time to detonate!)

And if the antennae can withstand this sort of treatment, that brings
up all sorts of interesting things you can do with the technology :-)

                                   Roger Myhre


This document has been an article in KU #4. Since then I have changed
the rules a bit, and modified the careers. This document will be
upgraded as new special careers pop up.

As the Traveller: The New Era (TNE) do not include Vargr character
generation I will present some rules here that I think will be of use.
Note that GDW may have other plans for Vargr character generating. As
the Vargr is quite close to humans (not counting looks, ancestry and
behaviour) their skill will be quite like. And I won\'t introduce any new
skills.


THE STATS

Vargr got the same stats as humans, with one exception. Vargr do not
have Social status, but their Charisma rating is the measure to find
where they stand in the Vargr society. A Vargr with high Charisma will
attract other Vargr for followers. So put a \'-\' in the Soc box on the
character sheet. The stats are rolled as following. STR 2D2-2, AGL 2D6,
CON 2D-2, INT 2D6- 1, EDU 2D-1, CHA 1D6.

If the total stats are less than 33, the player can add the difference
to the character stats, with these exceptions: CHAM-;cannot be increased
to more than 3. Any other stat cannot be increased beyond 11. The 33
limit is lower than the limit in the rulebook of 36. The reason for this
is that the Vargr is generaly weaker than an average human.

When calculating the weight of a Vargr use the same formula as for
humans, but the base weight is 70Kg. Making generally Vargr smaller than
Humans. The base weight is the same for males as for females. For hand
combat damage factor is the same as for humans, but add 1D6 damage each
time the Vargr elects to use his or hers claws. For using the claws the
skill is as for unarmed combat, Unarmed Melee skill which all Vargr
characters start with at level 0, Leadership is also a skill they start
with at 0.


SELECTING CAREERS

The Vargr can use all the careers in the book except for "Hiver
Technical Academy". There are some consideration to Vargr when they are
generated. Firstly their Charisma rating is a measurement of how
successful a given

Vargr is. The Charisma rating may go up and down during generation.For
CHA beyond A the cost is doubled. Thus it cost is 2 points from A to B.
But loss of one point in CHA brings you automatically from B to A. In
some careers there is possible to make a big enough mistake that you are
thrown out. This is true to all military careers. This does not however
stop the character generation, the character just has to enter a new
career, but not a military one, if he or she makes the continuity roll.
Even if you are thrown out from a career, you always finish the term
before you enter a new one.

CHA is increased/decreased like this:

   +1 If promotion is made.
   +1 if 12+ is rolled. Cumulative with above modifier. And promoted an
      additional rank.
   -1 if the promotion roll is missed by 4 or more
   -2 and demoted if the roll is natural 2 regardles of DM\'s. Not
cumulative with above modifier. Holds true for both special duty and
promotion rolls. If a natural 2 is rolled twice in a given military
career the character is thrown out at the end of the term.

If your character is from Society of Equals in Gvurrdon, he or she must
make a special roll to be rated equal. This is essential to enter the
following careers: Any military officer, Diplomat, Lawenforces or
Aristocrat.

   Difficult, Willpower

This task is rolled before the character generation is started. If the
roll is a catastrophic failure roll 1D6 and divide the result on the
STR, AGL and CON stat. Reduce the stats accordingly. This is damage
taken from the test.
Example: A player rolls 4 on the die, when he has failed. Thus the stats
has to be reduced with one each. For the remaining point the player may
choose which stat to reduce.


CAREERS:

**Oruelaen**
Psionic forces of Thirz Empire in Gvurrdon. Thirz empire has a special
force of psionic agents. They are not secret agents as portraied in
movies, but rather a information gathering group for the King in Thirz
Empire. Not much are actually known about them publicly, so a lot of
myths has been spun around them. All sophonts that are citizens of Thirz
Empire may apply. They will be tested for potentiality before they are
admitted. For ranks use Army table in the rulebook. All who are admitted
start with rank E5 Sergeant. Rank O10 General is not available for
playing characters when King Thir holds this position. As the force is
small and there is only possible to get promoted when a operative dies
or quits, the agents start at Enlisted rank, no matter what kind of
academies or careers they have attended before. Those who are admitted
get a Cha+1

PREREQUESITES: PSI strenght of 8+, and at least one of these abilities:

               stellar as base when calculating money. Initiative is
               rolled 1D6


**Aristocrat**
As an aristocrat you know how the interstellar governments in the
extents is working. And if you are lucky and use your skills properly,
you might be able to carve out a place for your own.

               below 8 the character may not continue this career. Note
               that CHA may not get above 15 or F.


**Fair Witness**
This career are only open to citizens of Thoengling Empire in Gvurrdon
Sector. A Fair Witness (FW) is a profession where a Vargr, or some other
sophont has gone through a training, giving total recall. FW is pledged
to report whatever it observed when on duty. Most FW is working free-
lance, but need a permit to do so. There is almost impossible to bribe a
FW to tell something else, that the FW did observe. The reason for this
is that the job itself gives quite good economical freedom, and
Charismatic standing among the Vargr. A FW will never offer an oppinion,
nor a theory when on duty. Or speak his or her meaning when recalling
something they observed while on duty. Thus if asked why a person acted
has he did, the FW cannot answer this, but only tell what the person
did. The FW will recall what he saw, heard, smelled, felt and so on. A
FW may be hired by anyone, but as they get better, their fee increase
accordingly. FW are often used when deals are been made, or when there
is need for a independent witness in a certain process.

When an obervation is going to be made, let the PC roll an imprint task,
using observation as asset. Base difficulty should be difficult,
adjusted depending on the situation. When the given situation is to be
recalled later, a new task is rolled. The difficulty on this task
depends on the success level on the prior task.

Asset: Observation
Imprint Success Level  Recall Difficulty
- ----
Outstanding Success    Routine
Success                Difficult
Failure                Formidable

Recall Success Level   How much was recalled?
- ----
Outstanding Success    100%
Success                 75%
Failure                 50%
Outstanding Failure      0%

VARGR VERSUS OTHER SOPHONT INTERACTION

First time a non Vargr character is interacting with Vargr NPC\'s or
other Vargr characters, divide that characters CHA with 2, and drop
fractions. The result may not be below 1. Note however that this will
reduce all assets

EXCEPT language skills. For the character to increase his or hers CHA to
normal level follow the general CHA increase and decrease rules below.
The opposit is also true when a Vargr are going to interact with humans
for the first time. Note that both of these cases relates to Humans in a
Vargr dominated society, or Vargr in a Human dominated society.


CHARISMA INCREASES AND DECREASES

When a session is over there should be checked if the leader of the
group, the character with the highest CHA, will increase his charisma.
The difficulty level is up to the referee. But I will give a few
pointers.

Asset: Leadership.

  The session was an outstanding success    Average
  The group met its goals in the session    Difficult
  The group barely made the goals           Formidable
  The group made only a few of its goals    Impossible

If any of these tasks are a catastrophic failure the leader loose 1
point of Charisma. If the leader has CHA of A or more increase the
difficulty with one level.

The difficulty levels should be modified with how difficult the
adventure was. If the adventure was an total failure, the character must
roll a formidable task to prevent Charisma decrease. If that roll is a
catastrophic failure, the leader loose 2 points of Charisma.

The leader may also by commendate or reprimand the others in the group,
and thus increase or decrease the CHA of these characters. The leader
may only commendate a character if he himself got a CHA increase, but he
may reprimand a character whenever he wish. But reprimand a character
without reason will have counterproductive results, and the referee
should penalize this.

One good roleplaying tip is that the referee places the players in
clockwise fashion, with the highest CHA rated character to the left of
him. Whenever there is an important decission to be made, ask the leader
first. Ignore the others for a while. If the leader is hesitating, this
can mean a loss in

Charisma specialy if other players start to come with solutions. This is
to simulate that the other Vargr always look to their leader. If the
leader fails the others may take command. The referee should be a bit
careful with this approach though. The player may not be good at
roleplaying in this fashion, so the referee should give him more time
than a player that got good abilities at this type of roleplaying.

Whenever 2 players got equal or a difference of one level in Charisma a
Charismatic struggle erupts. The leader must then roll a difficult
leadership roll to stay in position. If the roll fails, the two players
change position. If a catastrophic failure is rolled, the leader loose 2
CHA points.

The referee may also increase or decrease the CHA of characters during
play, to give them a feel of how successful they are. However this
should be used sparingly. If a player shows some initiative, and do
something daring and succeeds he should be awarded. In doubt let him
roll a difficult task. Equally he should loose Charisma if he does
something and fails, especially if he endangers the mission and the
adventure group.

Other uses of Charisma is that a high Charisma Vargr will always reduce
the Initiative  to the opposition by one to a minimum of one, if they
are of lower Charisma. If the Charisma to the leaders of the two groups
are equal, let the player roll a difficult leadership to gain the upper
hand. If this fails the opponent get the upper hand. When calculating
loss of initiative to combat damage use the original initiative.

Remember these rules is only valid in a Vargr society. A human will have
a hard time to prove herself, but when she gets the wheels turning,
there might not be anything stopping her. Note that If the non Vargr
character increases her Charisma above her original level it is returned
to normal when interacting with other non vargr characters or NPCs.


BRIBING VARGR

This may sound easy, but many has fallen into the trap, believing the
Vargr nature is working for them. What they do forget is that do not
oppose to the Charisma of the clerk in front of them, but the Charisma
of his superior officer or leader.

An example is maybe in order. Lets say an Vargr journalist is working on
a special report, and need graded information from the police. Offering
money for bribery is pointless. As for most human societies social
status is measured by the wealth you got. This is not the case with
Vargr. To a Vargr you have to offer increase in Charisma. Money is
something that comes along. Money is not as important for a Vargr as for
most human cultures. Money is a tool nothing more nothing less. However
money should be offered in the bribe, but the amount never is large. Its
just a small contribute for the service rendered. So the journalist must
actually make up a case were he can prove that the police officer will
increase in Charisma if the journalist is successfull in his
investigation. Remember that Vargr are pack animals opposed to humans
which are more invidiualistic. A Vargr will always view a certain action
in the light of what the group will gain by that given action. Each
individual Vargr always try to improve their status within a group. This
sound contradictory, but viewed from the human point it is, but for the
Vargr it makes sense. If the indiviual Vargr feels that he or she will
gain Charisma to belong to that group it will be loyal to it, and do
whatever is in her power to increase the group Charisma. Going back to
this journalist, he must convince the police officer that the whole
department will gain by giving the information he needs. In most cases a
person trying to bribe a Vargr only have to go up against the closest
leader to the Vargr trying to be bribed.

The difficulty is such a bribery attempt is rarely easier than
Difficult. If the group leader of the opposition are of lower Charisma
it might be easier. The difficulty level should also be adjusted to how
the bribing player is arguing, and how he or she present the deal.

There is also possible to buy information on the street by Vargr. In
these cases money have more to say, when this kind of information is
bought from Vargr that never are attached to a group over long period of
time, and thus do not have the neccessary group loyalty, except for its
own day to day survival.

Firstly, I don\'t see why a missile impact is impossible ... s**t happens.

Secondly, why do you need to \'detonate\' an antimatter missile at range?

If I were to design an anti-matter missile I would set it up to approach
hostile ships with the intention of impacting to do the most possible
damage.  I would also design it so that if the missile is hit by a
sufficiently powerful anti-missile then it\'s war head goes off.

This combination gives you the best of both scenarios:

   - If they don\'t shoot down the missile then it WILL impact and do a
     LOT of damage.

   - When they do shoot down the missile they MUST do it sufficiently
     far from their ship so that the detonating missile doesn\'t do too
     much damage to them.

Non-anti-matter missiles are not so useful because you can\'t guarantee
they will detonate after being shot down but an anti-matter containment
field WILL fail and the reaction MUST happen because you encased the
sucker in normal matter AND whatever they are using to shoot it down is
probably composed of normal matter too.

Anti-matter missiles are expensive SO intersperse them among your 
normal Non-anti-matter missiles.  What a nice surprise for the intended
victim 8^}.

I\'m sorry for replying through the TML, but I\'m using a offliner with

And you got 26 [sigh]

Anyway, yes I have uploaded the Gvurrdon stuff to Sunbane into the
Donations area as I was instructed by someone else on this list. I did
include some of the more important documents for Gvurrdon in the TML a
few nights ago. Those docs covered the most important information on
Gvurrdon as Library data, UWP, political factions and aliens. More will
be posted when I have sorted a few bugs out from the text.

Keep in mind that there\'s a very good reason (under _any_ rule set) NOT
to use antimatter missiles.

Safety.  One teensy tiny little failure in your containment system, and
your ship goes bye-bye.  (Maybe the Ancients could rig things so that
their antimatter batteries could discharge safely -- anyone else
remember _Twilight\'s Peak_), but somehow I think there are difficulties
at Imperial (even high Imperial) tech levels...

Great.  I was just a bit worried.  It\'s difficult to tell sometimes.

First off, I thought we had given up on the technology issue?  :-)

Actually, I find this incredulous myself.  I merely stated that since there
were changes to the UWP data over this fifteen year period *and* the
population and other figures were not changed that it must be *assumed*
to have been done intentionally.  (My own opinion is that GDW was merely
careless once again.)

Unlikely, I admit.  I did a little arithmetic though and found some
interesting numbers.  A population increase of 10% over a period of 15
years works out to an annual rate of increase of 0.64%.  Here are some
`real\' annual rates from a handy 1990 almanac (these are net figures,
accounting for births, deaths and migrations):

US         0.7%
Denmark    0.0%
Japan      0.5%
Spain      0.5%
UK         0.2%
France     0.4%
USSR       1.0%
Greece     0.1%
Italy      0.0%
Germany   -0.1% (a decrease!)
India      2.2%

It\'s clear for `developed\' countries that something less than a 10% increase
over a period of fifteen years is not unreasonable.  Keep in mind as well that
due to rounding conventions, a 10% increase (or decrease) will not show up
even in the PBG population multipler (the mantissa) for values under 5 and
that *only* a 10% *increase* will affect the actual UWP population code *if*
the population multipler is 9.

It\'s my impression that most worlds in the Spinward Marches are going to be
more equivalent in terms of population growth to contemporary `developed\'
nations than to `developing\' nations (just my opinion).  Furthermore, while
one might expect high birth rates and low death rates (due to available high
tech medical care) on `developing\' worlds one would also expect high rates of
*emigration* (to high population worlds) to keep the net growth rate low.

In fact, it is internal migration that ought to have the greatest effect
on population for worlds within the Domain/Regency.

Now, I accept that it is quite incredulous not to see any change in *any*
world population over a span of fifteen years (and I suspect if we looked
hard enough we might even find a couple of changes due to errors in 
transcription) but I submit the above information in an effort to suggest
that such an occurrence is not *impossible*.  (Maybe only as unlikely as
the occurrence of `techno-economic cycles\'.  :-)

Nevertheless, I believe we were discussing tech levels not population levels
and the fact that no tech levels changed still does not suggest that *any*
of them went *down* so the lack of any evidence for the `techno-economic
cycles\' remains.  (Remember, I\'ve already admitted the *possibility* that
they *could* exist.  I can just explain Gram\'s domination of the Sword
Worlds through the less incredulous agency of Zhodani aid.)

It\'s *possible*, just not very damn likely.

Just what is Solomani culture anyway?  The Solomani took over a Vilani
empire.  I would expect them to adopt *many* Vilani traits just as the
Hellenes under Alexander adopted Persian traits and the Germanic tribes
that conquered Rome adopted Roman ones.  I suspect this `Solomani\'
cultural heritage might just be more Imperial propaganda.  As for the
Sword Worlds, they haven\'t had any direct contact with the Solomani in
700 years.  They have about as much in common with the Solomani as
Americans have with Byzantines!  (Just look at the differences in attitudes
about religion as an indicator of the cultural gulf here.)

We sure seem to travel across a wide spectrum of ideas!  :-)

Well, first off, it\'s my sense that as the size of the economy *increases*
it becomes *more* difficult for economic down turns to affect technological
capabilities (since there is more of a buffer to absorb down turns in
particular sectors).  I\'ve admitted this is possible though.  So, please
give me some sense of your sense of the relative likeliness of these
`techo-economic cycles\' occurring as compared to the likelihood of there
being no population change in the Marches over fifteen years.  Twice as
likely?  Five times?  Ten times?  A hundred times?  It\'s my sense that 
these two occurrences are about *equally* likely. :^)

> How severe? That\'s the whole point, isn\'t it? A planet with billions of

Again, see above.  As the size of the economy grows it becomes *more*
difficult for economic factors to affect overall technological capabilities.
(We\'re not talking individual factors as used in *WBH* now.  Those already
can fluctuate up and down.)

> Seems to me I\'ve heard about factories in third-world countries that have

Even if you could this is not a matter of technological fluctuation that
is tied to economic factors.  If the country is unable to continue to
operate the factory then it never *had* that level of capability.  The
company that pulled out maintains its own tech level at its other facilities.
This situation might occur on some worlds but it is not relevant to our
discussion of indigineous Sword Worlds capabilities.  (If anything, it
supports my claim for Zhodani support of Gram!)

I apologize.  I didn\'t mean to dismiss your points about medieval feudalism.
Clearly, you have a much better understanding of medieval feudalism than I
do.  I suggest though that your very familiarity with medieval feudalism
is hindering your ability to see a feudal technocracy as something different.
I feel that it is in terms of *technocracy* and how a technocratic system
might be "feudal" that I have failed the most in communicating my ideas.  
I will endeavor to be more successful.

Certainly, but they chose to call it "feudal technocracy", not "technocractic
feudalism".  This is an important distinction when one is focusing on
precise definitions.

How is "giving out industrial fiefs in [exchange] for allegiance and 
support" different from "selling shares of an enterprise in exchange for
financial capital"?  In my view, they are the same thing.

Here\'s one problem in communication.  We do not share the same definition of
an "industrial holding".  I believe to you this means a single corporate
entity, a company.  To me, it is a block of stock - a share - in an
industrial enterprise.  I believe my definition is more accurate but in
any event we ought to be able to discuss this in common language now.  We
both see an "industrial holding" as being the equivalent feudal "fief" but
we have identified them as different things.

Alas, I\'m not discussing how medieval feudalism worked.  I\'m trying to
show how some of the *practices* of medieval feudalism would be manifest
in a futuristic *technocracy*.  This is another source of our communication
problem.

This is the "key part" of the feudal arrangement that will be manifest in
a feudal technocracy.  In `theory\' one might say that a corporation `owns\'
its shares and merely `grants possession\' of them to it shareholders in
return for `services rendered\' in the form of financial capital.

In a capitalist market economy an external governmental entity exists to
provide the legal framework for interactions between actors in the market.
(This lack of a stable source of legal authority is the major barrier to
market reforms in Russia today.)  In a feudal technocracy, feudal
principles provide the legal framework for interractions in the marketplace.

The various shareholders can only act through cooperation.  An individual
shareholder cannot fire the Chairman (the `technocractic lord\') on their own
(unless they hold a controlling share which is uncommon).  Thus they can
only remove the technocractic lord if a majority of the shareholders (vassals)
agree that she had failed in her duties as prescribed by the `feudal\'
arrangement.  (These are primarily related to the generation of profits for
the firm.)

Keep in mind that this is not equivalent to contemporary market systems
which have an external governmental entity to define *all* aspects of the
system from embezzlement to anti-trust action.

No, they provide the technocratic lord with financial capital.  This is
the equivalent to `fealty\' in a technocracy.  (The enterprise provides the
Chairman\'s salary and pension.  A few years back Lee Iacocca was paid *one*
dollar one year.  Clearly, there is a different principle at work here than
the mere employee-employer relationship of the corporate model.)

See.  I don\'t want to talk about medieval feudalism.  I want to talk about
how aspects of feudalism will be manifest in a futuristic technocracy.

I guess I should have said "`ownership *is* not the important" and
"coordinated military service that *is* what *matters*" and added that
I was speaking in terms of how feudalism is manifest in a technocracy.

Again, I guess I should have been more clear that I was talking about how
the principles of feudalism would be manifest in a futuristic technocracy.
I didn\'t realize that we were arguing over what medieval feudalism was.  I
thought we were trying to discover what feudal technocracy would be.

It\'s not the same.  It\'s *very* different.  A single owner needs no system
of rules to govern how she makes her decisions.  A group of shareholders
*does*.  In a feudal technocracy it is my view that feudal principles will
serve as this system.

Shareholders are not like a single owner because they require a set of
principles to govern their coordinated (there\'s that word again) actions.
It is specifically the portions of the medieval feudal definition that
relate to the ownership of *land* that are *least* useful when trying to
understand how feudal principles might be applied to a futuristic technocracy.

Well, I don\'t really see the differences in names or titles as relevant.
I see the Chairman as serving in the role of technocratic *baron* (if
there was one single Chairman in the entire economy then she would be 
`king\').  There are some differences here because the contemporary market
system is not the same as a feudal technocracy due to the influence
and role of government entities external to the marketplace.  This is
where the *kieretsu* come in because the relationships among the players
there occur (mostly) outside the influence of the government.  (You must
realize that none of these examples fit the model entirely.)

I disagree.  Medieval feudal vassals "banded together for mutual benefit"
under an aristocratic lord who provided coordinated security services.
Forget the focus on `land\' and one might descibe this as a mere `gang\'
as well.  (I don\'t choose to, mind you.)

I would express this the other way around.  It is a *portfolio* rather than
`simply\' shares in a single corporation.  A group of shares in a single
corporate entity makes the shareholder the `vassal\' of the `baron\' of that
particular corporation.  As the holder of different blocks of shares
in a variety of corporations I will have a variety of `vassal\' relationships
to several different `barons\'.  This is how the technocracy becomes more
complicated but I believe this sort of situation even occurred under the
medieval feudal system on occasion (and I can\'t cite examples).  Rememeber
as well that each `baron\', each corporation, also holds shares (or is bound
by other relationships such as supplier agreements) to other `barons\',
who might be better classed as `counts\' or even `dukes\'.

Certainly.  Why wouldn\'t this be the case?  The `title\' (which is actually
the definition of the prescribed responsibilities associated with that
share of stock) transfers with ownership by sale or inheritance or whatever.
If a particular block of stock represents a majority or even full holding
then one might call is something like `the Barony of Traskon\'.  :-)
 
> Who decides on the new title? And if a \'fief\' is just a stock portfolio,
> what\'s the difference between this system and any capitalist society?

The title is defined by the feudal responsibilities associated with that
block of shares.  Contemporary market systems attach no such relationship 
to shareholding because all such responsibilities are provided through the
external government entity.  Remember this is not just legal things like
right to ownership and such but basic principles of the entire economic
system like currency supplies, interest rates, rates of exchange, etc.
(Recall Steve Bonneville\'s post that pointed out most *zaibatsu*
were organized around a central bank.)

> Why not?

I wasn\'t talking about the Isle of Man.  I was talking about an isolated
island that existed independent of any other feudal system.  A privately-
held corporation is in essence `outside\' the rest of the economic system
if you focus merely on *ownership* as too much of the medieval model
might lead you to do.

I think the system I\'m describing fits *Space Viking* pretty darn well.
Mind you I\'m not sure Beam put the effort into his system that we\'ve already
put in here!  :-)

We don\'t know this.  *All* we know is that *Trask* owned *Traskon*.

> what you claim to be isolated baronies that are

A wholly-owned holding still may still be part of the feudal system if the
feudal arrangements cover things in addition to mere ownership.  The
feudal arrangement for Traskon Barony may have descibed things like the
price Wardshaven would pay for Traskon beef, the nature of such transfers,
where Traskon acquired feed for its bisonoids, how veterinary services 
were received, hiring and pay issues for ranch hands, etc., etc., etc.
Remember, in a contemporary market economy the external government entity
does most of these things.  There is no external government entity in a
feudal technocracy.

> You DO mean a stock portfolio! How do you figure out the baronial titles?

I don\'t know.  How did they do it in medieval times?  I imagine something
in the feudal agreement defines these sorts of things.

> OK. I arrive on Gram with a draft for a billion credits in my back pocket. 

Well, I think you could probably figure this out yourself now but here goes.
You are Hans, Baron of Spindleworks (under the Duke of Megatronics), Count
of Gronemetrics (under the Duke of Dynaline), Duke of Gombril, and a minor
squire to a half dozen other lords.  You hold fealty to all of these lords.
You probably have dozens of your own vassals now.  (Now please don\'t hold 
me to specifics here, but you get the idea I hope.)  You see that if King
Anders of Gram were to do this on Sacnoth he would be in vassalage to any
lord of which he owned a minority holding.

Again, I apologize.  I should have said "medieval feudal theory (or practice)"
and "futuristic feudal technocractic practice".

> I am. The company is IMO the FT equivalent of the feudal land holding.
> Like Karvalmills is one holding. Traskon is one. Etc.

Now you see how I\'m using "industrial holding" differently.  There is nothing
about a technocracy that requires a holding to be held in full.  (And I\'m
not sure you can support the claim that Karvallmills was held in full.  Also,
it\'s even possible that Trask only held a majority interest in Traskon.
Angus would still have gained control had Trask only sold a majority holding.
The very fact that Nik Trask was appointed Vicar-Baron suggests he might have
held a minority interest.)

Nothing.  How does it conflict with what\'s in the book?  It helps me explain

What `service\' did Duke Angus provide to Trask and Karvall and his other
vassals that was equivalent to the medieval duke riding forth with his
knight to protect an embattled baron?  (I suppose you\'ll say the same
military service.  Ug!)  What the Duchy of Wardshaven did, IMHO, was
coordinate economic activites (there\'s the feudal part) so that the
economic baronies of his vassals were able to function.  The Bank of
Wardshaven provided a source of investment capital for Karvallmills to
purchase milling equipment, some other vassal provided civil engineering
services so that Traskon had reliable water supplies, Karvallmills provided
collapsium for the vehicle manufacturing barony to build earthmovers for
the civil engineering barony, etc., etc., etc.

I don\'t see much technocracy in your model.  If political power is based
merely on industrial (as opposed to land) holdings where does the 
"government by those with specialized knowledge" part of technocracy
come in?  Your model of feudal technocracy looks merely like futuristic
feudalism to me.

> And that it was called "The Barony of Traskon", not "Lucas 
> Trask\'s holdings".

Excuse me for being dense, but what\'s the difference what it\'s called?  As
I envision it (and as I\'ve *tried* to describe it) the terms `barony\'
and `holdings\' mean the same thing.

Okay, before I get into to my entire "IBM as feudal technocratic barony"
model let me make the disclaimer that despite the fact the I was using the
real names of the CEO and former CEO all my references to shareholders
(teachers\' union and such) are strictly for illustrative purposes and do
not have anything remotely to do with the actual situation at IBM.

> Bingo! There\'s the fallacy. The teacher\'s union dosen\'t become a vassal,

You say, "Tomato."  Dan Qualye says, "Tomatoe."  :-)  It\'s the same thing.
In a feudal *technocractic* model a `part owner\' *is* a vassal.

> In a capitalist society CEO Akers isn\'t a lord, he is an employee of the

Well, yes, but I wasn\'t talking about a market economy.  I was using this
example to illustrate how a feudal technocracy works.

> In a feudal 
> technocracy he would be a vassal

What can I say?  We have exactly opposite understandings here.  Again, you\'re
focused on the ownership of land, or now shares of stock.  You get this from
your understanding of medieval feudalism.  Where does the technocracy fit in
your model?  Or does the mere fact that there\'s `something technical\' about
IBM or any industrial firm satisfy you in this regard?

IMHO, `technocracy\' describes the basis for the ruling class\'s exercise
of authority and `feudal\' describes the nature of the relationships between
the members of this ruling class.

> What\'s so complicated about medieval Germany? 

Wasn\'t one of the problems with the formation of a nation-state in Germany
the fact that under the feudal system there the holdings were always split
among all the heirs of a dead lord?  This led to more and more fragmentation
among the various principalities and greater and greater intermingling of
the feudal agreements between various barons. This was unlike the experience
in other medieval nations where holdings passed to the eldest heir.  (Or do
I need to get my money back for those Western Civ courses?  :-)

And what was the basis of this `legal\' authority?  How was it defined?

A minority shareholder has no legal influence in a corporation (other than
that pertaining specifically to the ownership of its shares).  A large
minority shareholder nevertheless has a great deal of *influence* among
other shareholders and can sway these other shareholders to action against
the Chairman of it can convince them that the Chairman, by not adequately
providing coordinated profit services, has violated his `feudal\' duties.
It *is* legal for a majority of shareholders to `fire\' the Chairman.  Your
question about `suing\' illustrates the difference between our market 
economy and a feudal technocracy once again - there is no external entity
under which to seek such redress in a feudal technocracy.

Are you beginning to see the difference?  In a market economy a government
entity external to the marketplace provides the framework of principles
which govern the nature of interactions in the marketplace.  In a feudal
technocracy these principles will be provided by the feudal agreements.

Could a medieval king do this if a majority of his barons did not support
this move?  It\'s my view that in a feudal technocracy a majority of barons
would not support a king who proposed this course of action because it is
counter to the enhancement of profit.  If someone shows up from offworld
with a wad of cash willing to pay twice what you think your ranching barony
is worth and your liege tells you you can\'t do it you\'re going to be mighty
displeased.  It\'s as if a medieval king had proposed unilateral disarmament!

Now let\'s talk about economic might.  The entire Mexican economy is about
5% of the US economy.  Where would Mexican industry be in the face of US
industry if there were not an external government entity (the Mexican
government) trying to protect it and another external government entity
(the US government) making some effort to see that US industry respect the
will of the Mexican government?  The entire European Union economy is about
120% of the US economy but it is highly fractured when compared to US
industry.  The only thing protecting European industry from being diced up
and swallowed by US industry is the intervention once again of external
government entities on both sides of the Atlantic (this is, in fact, a major
motivation behind the whole idea of the European Union) and these powers enjoy
roughly the same level of technological capability.  Does that give you some
insight on what Sacnoth *ought* to be able to do to Gram under a feudal
technocracy where there are *no* external government entities to protect
less powerful economic players?  Remember, we have already tied technological
capability to economic output so *clearly* Sacnoth\'s technological edge over
Gram should translate to an equivalent economic edge.

> Try to consider the possibility that the definitions are as they are

Accepted.  How does a technocracy work?  How is a futuristic feudal

Two things:  Feudalism was much more than the ties to ownership of land;
and a feudal technocracy is something quite different from medieval fedualism.

    'body' => 'I\'ve been enjoying the discussion so far.  Please advise as to whether I\'m
summarizing correctly (that will depend on which camp you\'re in, I suppose):

Historical feudalism could be described as a "feudal landlord-ocracy," in
which the landowner granted the right to use his land to certain vassals.
The vassals obtained the land and the people on the land (serfs, peasants,
or tenant farmers), and were obliged to fight at the landlord\'s bidding, and
usually to provide some men-at-arms from the people.  The people gave all of
their surplus production (food in historical times -- I\'m referring to
Europe, but there were analogous situations in Japan, China, and Russia as
well) to the landlord\'s vassal.  The people got protection from outside
enemies -- the landlord and his vassals would protect their lands and the
people on them -- as well as from internal problems -- their lord, the
landlord\'s vassal, would establish as manorial court and provide police-type
services.  The landlord\'s vassals got the surplus of the lands, which could
be traded, as well as often absolute power over the people.  The landlord
got troops, as well as taxes, and the surplus of his own personal holdings.

Maybe I\'ve left some details out, but that\'s how I recall European feudalism
working in broad outline (remember from history class, not from being
there).

In a feudal technocracy, some technology is substituted for the land; rule
is by the owners of the technology, who grant a right to use it to some
vassal class.  The vassals then hold the technology and the people who apply
it.  The people give the technocrat\'s vassals their surplus production
(which is probably not food), which the vassals can sell.  Probably the
people give all of their production to the vassal class (vassal is really a
misnomer here; it just means someone who owes fealty to someone higher in
the feudal hierarchy), which sells it and pays a wage to the people who buy
items for their subsistence.  

The vassals owe the technocrat something -- possibly military service, or
the provision of some military items.  Perhaps the vassal\'s fief creates
enough surplus production to finance a tank or a COACC fighter.  It\'s very
unlikely that the vassal and his men-at-arms just show up for war, but it\'s
not impossible, either.  

The problem that I\'m running into in analogizing feudal landlord-ocracy into
feudal technocracy is that I\'m using terminology, and the attendant systems,
that comes from capitalism, which is a different development altogether.
Having advanced from feudalism to capitalism, can we have a feudal structure
again?

Ok this probably has ended up obfuscating more than clarifying.  I\'ll try
again when I\'m fresher.

Here are two unrelated questions (maybe not so unrelated):

How have referees handled the question of slavery in the CT era?  Do your
Imperia allow slaves?  Interstellar slave trading?  Feudal technocratic
serfdom?  Labor unions?  Scratch that last one for now -- in fact, scratch
the last two.  I want to know about your views on regular sophont-as-chattel
slavery in the CT Imperium (and other states, too, I suppose).

What were the cultural effects of the psionics suppressions?  Are religious
visions considered a form of clairvoyance, and persecuted?  Are
mind-altering drugs associated with the Zhodani and avoided?  Or are they
embraced as a way of altering one\'s own mind without the interference of
another person?  Do people make psionic jokes?  Is meditation outlawed (or
embraced)?  Is hypnotherapy practiced?  What about psychiatry?  What about
neurosurgery?

just my comments on anti matter missiles:
I don\'t use them as penetrators. What I do is use them as slow destructive
charges. My use of antimatter is the following:

The missile is indeed a smart version of a usual drone, which carries an
antimatter dispenser on board. The drone maneuvers close to the enemy
vehicle and releases the antimatter in low quantities as hydrogen gas. There
is no immediate reaction, because space is nearly empty and the few matter
antimatter collisions in space will give a slight area jamming effect
(+1 Diff Mod for all Sensor actions, if antimatter is around).

The drone releases the Antimatter using a vector which will bring the enemy
starship in contact with the antimatter cloud. To do this the drone has to be
in the same hex as the target ship. If the antimatter is released in an adjacent
hex, it will disperse and become inert with respect to damage. If the drone
successfully insert antimatter in the pass of the target ship, the antimatter
causes 1 minor hit per round to all external devices (i.e. Antennas). If there
are no more devices on the hull, the hull is attacked. Each round of contact
to Antimatter reduces the hull armor by (50000/disp tons), because the
antimatter attacks the hull surface. One antimatter discharge of the missile
will be active for 2 space combat rounds, unless any maneuvers are done.
Regardless of the piloting roll or the thrust spended, the antimatter will
not be in contact with the ship anymore.

One shot of Antimatter in the sense above is 0.5 kl. To design the drone use
the spaceship design sequence. You need full computing power (i.e. no Flight 
computer) and a special Software to do this job. Fully RCV operation is not
possible, because the time delay would severly limit the effectivity of this
weapon. As with standard X-Ray-Laser warheads, this weapon can only be used
at range 0. And it cannot be used in atmosphere, because in atmosphere the
drone will be destroyed by the released Antimatter.

required Antimatter launcher:
Volume: 0.25 kl, Weight: 0.25 kl, Power required: 0.5 MW, Price: 95000 Cr
Launched volume: 0.5 kl Antimatter per Space combat turn.
Modus Operandi:
The Antimatter launcher is the inverse of a bussard ramscoop. It uses
superconduting magnets to accelerate the antimatter hydrogen onto the target.

Any comments on this?

Hey! You\'ll be making me blush next. I\'m no expert. I have read quite a lot
of historical fiction, including some set in this time frame, but I know
full well that one should be wary of relying on such information. Some
fiction authors know what they\'re talking about, others definitely do not.
That\'s why I checked with a dictionary.

>I suggest though that your very familiarity with medieval feudalism

Not quite. It\'s the basis of MY assumptions about feudal technocracy. I
realize that if a feudal technocracy is not feudal, then it may work very
differently. What is hindering my ability to see it working differently
is my faiure to see any fundamental difference between what you describe
and ordinary capitalism.

>How is "giving out industrial fiefs in [exchange] for allegiance and 
>support" different from "selling shares of an enterprise in exchange for
>financial capital"?  In my view, they are the same thing.

In the first case the vassal does not pay money to acquire the fief, he
undertakes to perform the technical duties involved in running it. In
other words, he agrees to perform a service in exchange for the holding.
In the second case he possesses goods equivalent in value to the holding
and pays for it. In the first case he is obviously beholden to the lord,
since he has been given something for nothing (or rather, nothing more than 
his solemn word that he will perform certain services as compensation. That 
is of course quite a lot in any society where a man\'s word is considered 
important). In a sense he is paying rent on is holding, except that he pays 
his rent party or totally in service  -  and that is a central facet of a 
feudal arrangment: service as payment for tenancy. In the second case he is 
under no obigation to the seller. Goods of (supposedly) equal value has been 
exchanged.

For a start I\'d ike a definition of a technocracy. Not a FT, but any system
that can be described as a technocracy. What are the essential features of a
technocracy?

>In `theory\' one might say that a corporation `owns\' its shares and merely

That would be an extremely distorted view of a very simple arrangement: A
number of people pool their ressources to become joint owners of a business.

That turns out not to be the case. The whole world economy, for example, is
based on negotiations between sovereign nations. Sovereign nations have no
external governmental entity to provide any legal framework. Yet would you 
claim that the interactions between the U.S, EU, Japan, Russia, China, ect. 
is not capitalist in nature?

>(This lack of a stable source of legal authority is the major barrier to
>market reforms in Russia today.)  

The disappearance of the USSR removed the established framework between the 
member republics. The USSR were an exampe of a government providing a 
framework. Now the republics are negotiating as equals to replace the
framework. Once they work out various treaties to govern their interaction 
we will have an example of a framework provided without a government. The
internal relations of the EU is a hybrid. GATT is a negotiated framework.

But the principles you\'ve mentioned is not feudal.

Which seems to be a normal, standard business relationship. We buy a part
of the company. A majority of us decides how it should be run and hire
someone to do it for us. If he dosen\'t perform as we like, we fire him
and hire someone else.

As is the case in any corporation.

Of course one can have market systems without government supervision. Well,
you may need a government to make sure noone shoots at you while you\'re
manufacturing or trading, but what more do you need?

Why call it \'fealthy\' then, since it isn\'t remotely like fealthy?

>(The enterprise provides the Chairman\'s salary and pension.  

Of course it does. His salary (and pension) is an operating expense. 
Naturally the enterprise has to generate enough money to cover that.
Wether the salary is fixed or depends on profits has no bearing on
that (It has a lot of bearing on the Chairman\'s incentive to strive
for the best possible results).

No. This merely means that his salary depends on the results he gets.

But the other knights dosen\'t have a beef. We were talking about how an

talk the other knights into joining him. Just as an employee who gets his
fellow empoyees to support him might get away with a strike.

Not very.

They need one rule: Decisions are taken by a share majority. The only 
difference between shareholders and a single owner is that the single
owner can run his company himself OR hire someone to do it, while
shareholders HAS to hire someone (although that someone can be one
of the shareholders, maybe even a majority shareholder, in which case
the difference is even less).

Principles, you say? As in theory? OK. What feudal principles?

They _require_ ONE pinciple: Majority rules. They can have more.

That\'s unfortunate, because that is the basis of the whole feudal system.
And that, of course, is why a system where you can become a vassal by
running a business instead of a land holding cannot be called a straight
feudality, but must be qualified to include industrial holdings.

No, I meant a feudal technocracy and any other capitalist system. If 
there isn\'t any real difference why have two seperate names for the
same systems?

Agreed.

Only if she partitioned out the various industries to fiefholders in

No, no, no. The cornerstone of the feudal arrangement were the manorial
holdings a big landholder gave to strong men in return for their promise
to support him. That made them vassals and him a feudal lord  -  a
sovereign feudal lord. It was these lords who banded together under princes 
or kings for mutual benefit. Eventually the difference between the king\'s 
own direct vassals, who had sworn fealthy to him in return for land, and 
the other feudal lords who had sworn fealthy to him in return for protection, 
became blurred and in the end those sovereign lords were not sovereign any 
more.

>It is a *portfolio* rather than `simply\' shares in a single corporation. A 
>group of shares in a single corporate entity makes the shareholder the

I can well understand that you put \'vassal\' and \'baron\' in quotes, because
this has nothing to do with vassalage og baronies. It\'s simpy a fancy way
of saying that if you buy some shares in a corporation you and your fellow
shareholders get to elect the man who runs the business and in return he
should make sure the shares pay dividends, because if not you will fire him. 

>Certainly.  Why wouldn\'t this be the case?  The `title\' (which is actually

So a \'title\' isn\'t a title either.

>The title is defined by the feudal responsibilities associated with that
>block of shares.  Contemporary market systems attach no such relationship

If you mean that a government will enforce obligations freely entered into
by subjects of that government, then you\'re right, but what\'s that got to
do with it? The \'responsibiities\' inherent in paying money for shares in 
a company is usually defined by the parties involved without recourse to
the government. "I pay you for part of that company. I get a say in who
we hire to run it. I get a share of the profits. Agreed?". The government 
need only ensure that people keep their word (athough admittedely most 
governments don\'t have the good sense to stop there).

>Remember this is not just legal things like
>right to ownership and such but basic principles of the entire economic
>system like currency supplies, interest rates, rates of exchange, etc.

You\'ll have to explain that. How does owning shares in a company allow me
to have a say about currencies, interest rates, and rates of exchange, etc?

>A privately-held corporation is in essence `outside\' the rest of the 
>economic system if you focus merely on *ownership* as too much of the 
>medieval model might lead you to do.

But I don\'t focus *merely* on ownership. A medieval fief-holder certainly
interacted with other people than his liege lord. Like all the neighbours
for a start. Likewise a private company interacts with other companies as
much as any corporation. In fact, if you were the chairman of a company
dealing with the chairman of another company then it would matter not a whit 
wether you had been hired by a single owner or a bunch of shareholders. Nor 
would it matter if he had been hired by one or the other.

I think it fits terribly. Obviously this is a different subject.

A feudal arrangement is not about mere ownership. It\'s about tenancy in

There\'s not a shred of evidence to support that. The only thing we are
told for sure is that the fighting men of Traskon and Karvallmills 
henceforth will be seen as solidly behind Duke Angus. Very possibly
Trask and Karvall have been independent (though themselves feudal lords
to _their_ liegemen) until the wedding and the ceremony we see is the
public declaration of fealthy to Angus.

Yes. What I can\'t see is how your \'industrial holding\' differs from an
ordinary stock portfolio. And if there isn\'t any diference then why

That the service a vassal gives in return for an industrial holding is to
manage the holding for the liege lord. Since the holding is a business of
some kind the vassal has to be competent to run the business.

Right. \'The fighting men of Traskon and Karvallmills\', remember? And Lucas
explained that the reason he supported Angus was that Angus was the only
duke Lucas thought had a chance to unite Gram and become a king, and Lucas
thought a king was a good idea. And how did Angus unite Gram? He used his
fighting men to conquer the lords he couldn\'t persuade to support him.

That may be so, but there\'s not one jot of evidence in the book that this
was the basis of the feudal relationship between Trask and Karvall on one
side and Duke Angus on the other, and some evidence to the contrary. And 
btw, to fit your above definition, shouldn\'t Trask and Karvall own a share 
of Wardshaven in order to be Angus\' vassals?

Right. But since the whole definition of feudalism has to do with land, a

feudalism.

In spite of the fact that the relationship between a part owner and the

If it hadn\'t been for that four-line definition provided by GDW then that

the vassal to run them himself.

All very well. I admit that I may be on thin ice with the \'technocracy\'
part (Maybe a definition of \'technocracy\' would help). But you are under 
the ice about the feudal relationship. Nothing you\'ve described resembles 
a feudal arrangement.

>Under what jurisdiction could such a dispute be brought for adjudication?

That\'s the whole problem with sovereignity. There is no authority over the
sovereign. That\'s one reason petty lords support a king: to provide a
legal authority to settle their disputes.

>A minority shareholder has no legal influence in a corporation (other than
>that pertaining specifically to the ownership of its shares).  

Like the right to replace the chairman if he can get enough other share-
holders to agree.

>A large minority shareholder nevertheless has a great deal of *influence* 
>among other shareholders and can sway these other shareholders to action 
>against the Chairman of it can convince them that the Chairman, by not 
>adequately providing coordinated profit services, has violated his `feudal\' 
>duties.

Or, as it could also be expressed, that by not doing his job properly the
Chairman had become a liability and should be replaced by his employers.

>It *is* legal for a majority of shareholders to `fire\' the Chairman. 

That\'s what I thought.

>Your question about `suing\' illustrates the difference between our market 
>economy and a feudal technocracy once again - there is no external entity
>under which to seek such redress in a feudal technocracy.

Why can\'t there be?

>Are you beginning to see the difference?  In a market economy a government
>entity external to the marketplace provides the framework of principles
>which govern the nature of interactions in the marketplace.  

Except in those market economies where no government exists. A government
is not an absolute requirement for a market (although it can be a big
help in keeping people from shooting each other), nor does it _have_ to
interfere with the market whose tranquiity it ensures (Unfortunately,
human nature being what it is, few politicians can resist the temptation
to meddle).

>In a feudal
>technocracy these principles will be provided by the feudal agreements.

And in what way does these agreements differ from contracts?

>>Why not? You have a world. The world is a feudal technocracy. They produce

>>happen to have a balanced economy. How are they vulnerable?

>this move?  

That would depend on wether they disliked the idea more than the idea of 
the disruption it would cause to depose the king. Or wether the king 
could make it worth the while of enough of them to agree.

>It\'s my view that in a feudal technocracy a majority of barons would not 
>support a king who proposed this course of action because it is counter to 
>the enhancement of profit. 

Unless, maybe, the king can persuade you that dealing with an outsider
is detrimental to your home planet and a treasonous, dastardly thing to do.

>If someone shows up from offworld
>with a wad of cash willing to pay twice what you think your ranching barony

Possibly, but will your neighbours be? Unless the offworlder can buy their
holdings too, why would they care? Don\'t you think they would support the
king against you? For that matter, would you sell that which gives you
your position in society for mere money? 

>Now let\'s talk about economic might. [...] Does that give you some insight 
>on what Sacnoth *ought* to be able to do to Gram under a feudal technocracy 
>where there are *no* external government entities to protect less powerful 
>economic players?  

It does, except that I don\'t accept the postulate that a feudal technocracy
can\'t have a government. Certainly not my concept of a FT and not even the
kind of FT you\'ve described. Even granted the conglomorate type society
you call a feudal technocracy there\'s nothing to prevent the players on
Gram from realizing that allowing the stronger Sacnoth players to play
wil eventually mean loosing all the marbles to them. Now, if Gram needs
something that only Sacnoth can provide, Sacnoth can use that dependency 
to force Gram to let them play. But if that vulnerability isn\'t there, 
Sacnoth can go fly a kite made out of their stronger credit notes. Or
if Sacnoth is considerably stronger than Gram, militarily, they can force
their way in, provided they are willing to use force. But if they aren\'t
that much stronger, or if they aren\'t willing to use their strength, that
still leaves them out in the cold.

>Remember, we have already tied technological
>capability to economic output so *clearly* Sacnoth\'s technological edge over
>Gram should translate to an equivalent economic edge.

Sure. In _TCS_ terms their money is worth the same (higher technology, but
lower starport type, (indicating less trade relatively)). In _Striker_
terms their money is worth 14.3 % more. But 14% or even 50% superiority
is cold comfort if you\'re exchanging nuclear missiles.

>Two things:  Feudalism was much more than the ties to ownership of land;
>and a feudal technocracy is something quite different from medieval fedualism.

Something different, obviouly. But as I mentioned earlier, I assumed from the
start that \'feudal\' had some meaning analogous its old one.

    Most older vessels will probably be refitted to newer tech (this being
easier than building new ships) where possible. The Regency needs to use
whatever technological advantage it has so that it can best protect its
boarders (Virus, Zhodani, Aslan, Vargr, etc...).

If either of these happen I would figure on assassination wars, somewhat like
the Aslan, I think most of the leaders would be too worried about the Virus

Campaign?  If enough folks would be interested, I would 
be happy to run one.

The game would be two-sided, with players allocated to 
sides in order of request to join.  The players on each 
side will have to work out among themselves command 
procedures, ship designs, etc.

The campaign would take place between two subsector-
sized units, with a third frontier sector seperating 
them.  Both sides will be assumed to have come up to 
TL13 within the past year, so existing fleet production 
will be 20% TL11, 80%TL12, + TL13 production as desired 
from one year\'s budget starting 52 weeks before the 
start of game.

If there are requests, I may add a couple of tertiary 
powers to the game.

Tactical combat would be resolved by the referee, in 
accordance with player\'s orders and with the aid of the 
local gaming group.  At critical junctures in a tactical 
situation, if there is a player with the force, I will 
consult if I feel input is required.

I expect the game to move quite slowly, with generous 
deadlines (and especially so during initial design and 
periods of intense tactical activity).

I will assume that the two societies at conflict are 
reatively open, so that many details of at least older 
designs will be public knowledge (...pass me Jane\'s, 
will you?)  and particlarly interesting designs and 
events will be posted to TML.

If you are interested, please email me directly.  I will 
allow a couple of weeks to gather responses, and judge 
from that if I should proceed.

 Frankly, I don\'t either.  I can see where, given the ranges and velocities
of space combat, it would be very hard, but no matter how improbably it is, a
ship can be constructed to deliver enough missles quickly enough to make at
least one hit probable -- and an impact by even one delayed-detonation H-bomb
riding in a high velocity penetrator ought to really ruin your day.

OTOH, can you image how the "tradition" based gamers would react to missles
becoming genuinely effective?  In traditional high guard, a missile armed
figher cannot seriously threaten a large warship.  With impact nukes honestly
represented, they could.  Perhaps that is what the decision to ban them was
based on.

Several SF writers has used black holes or singularities (same thing) as
weapons or as a means of locomotion in either real space or hyperspace.
David Gerrold use it in his latest book "Covenant of Justice". Larry
Niven used it as a murder weapon and as a weapon from destroying
starships. One of the two latter (if not both) stories are not realistic
as Stephen Hawkins found that black holes of the size mentioned in these
stories would only exist a few seconds before they ceased to exist.

And a missile with with a black hole must keep the black hole "alive"
until after it is used. And this will undoubtfully cost power and/or
mass. How much? do anyone know? [sigh, back to the drawing board]

They can take ROF overpowering according to the rules given in BL. That

requirement with 5, and with 10 for a -2 difficulty level.

How do the cost come out for lasers not using gravitic focusing? That

Suggestions for alternate Coyns:

In the modern set we have the six castes.  An ancient set might
have seven.  The seventh caste being that of the ancients
themselves:  Grandfather and his children.

While I think that the races idea being representative of their
respective personality types, I might also suggest that they
represent the competition that the Droyne face in the present
setting.  Grandfather, when setting out the coyns thought he had
better show the Droyne who/what else was out there in the universe.
I guess I\'m thinking of Niven\'s Ringworld Engineers where the Pak
had built their ringworld with bits and pieces of other worlds to
serve as warnings to their descendents:  Earth, Mars, Kzin etc.

But at other times, it was not apparant just who were the races
that Grandfather might want to show to the Droyne.  Example:  Until
the Aslan hit space, they were a pretty small deal.  Thus, Coyns
from before that time wouldn\'t include them.

But what other races are out there?

The extinct race on Sabmiqys:  The Gya Ks.  Until -8000 when their
planet was wiped out, these guys must have looked like a potent
force to Gramps. (TL 17 but no jump drive.) [Challenge]

The extinct race on Spica now known as the Hasst\'kor:  The creators
of the Prt\'.  Until -10000 when they were wiped out in a war, they
were doing quite well.  (TL 16) [Challenge]

The Droashav, also known as the G\'naak by the K\'kree:  The original
G\'naak carnivores who almost conquered Kirur in -27000.  Their TL
is unknown, but was at least TL10, and some of their
instrumentation has survived 23000 years without any maintenance.
(Sounds like TL 16+ to me, but no jump drive).  [MegaTrav Journal]

The Hhkar:  The stogie smoking lizards have been in space since
- -50000.  (TL10 but no jump drive.)  [Challenge]

The intelligent Chamax thingies:  (Unlikely, but these guys were
space faring in the 700s. (TL9-10 but no jump drive) [Double
Adventure 5]

The unnamed alien race in Traveller\'s Digest #21.  These guys were
just sort of thrown in without any explanation.  They were
obviously some kind of servant race for the Ancients.

The Primordials:  These guys who were so dang powerful, they made
Grandfather look like a doddering senile old Worker Caste.  Then
they got bored and died.  I almost did too when I read that one.
[Knightfall]

Alternately, an ancient set of coyns might have proto-vargr on
them.  Vargr looked quite different in -300,000.

Or How about Dolphins?

How about another dead alien race we\'ve never heard of before in
Traveller?  The Krell from Forbidden Planet?  The things from
Aliens (JTAS)?  The creatures the Aliens originally snacked on in
Alien?  Larry Niven\'s Slavers?  David Brin\'s Progenitors?  Arthur
C. Clarke\'s Ramans?  The Ancient High Martians from Space: 1889?
The Daleks?  The aliens from UFO?  The Mysterons from Captain
Scarlet?  The alien races from 2300AD?  James P. Hogan\'s giant
Ganymeans.  Saberhaugen\'s Berserker creators?  The Moties?  H. P.
Lovecraft\'s Ancient Ones?  The mice from Hitch Hiker\'s Guide to the
Galaxy?  The Hive creatures from Alt.Pub.Havens-Rest?

Who knows, maybe in the future we may be seeing coyns with Ael Yael
on them or Brinn, or Newts?  [The players find a bag of coyns that
went through a time warp.  From the past, or the future? :-]

One obvious use for the short range highly efficient X-ray lasers is in 
defense against fighters and missiles, both of which need to be close to 
attack.  Range isn\'t needed, and much better firepower is available without 
gravitic focusing.  In fact, for missile defense it might be advantageous to 
put more than one laser in a turret.  Hers\'s a TL15 turret design that has 
three lasers, each of which fires at 800 per turn.  Three shots at -5 Diff... 
can it miss????

This system uses one beam pointer and one HPG for all three lasers.  If a 
separate beam pointer and HPG are used, the power drops to about 200 MJ, still
adequate for missile defense.

With a little geometry, I determined that each focal array has a diameter of
1.65 meters.  This makes effective range 5.5 hexes.  The focal arrays are 
built to fire at 800 shots per turn.

Discharge Energy 430 MJ (each), Input Energy 506 MJ (each)

Beam Pointer (5 Hex)    1.5 tons        1.5 kl          .15MCr
Focal Arrays            22.07 tons      22.07 kl        4.414MCr
HPG                     35.42 tons      17.71 kl        .1771MCr

This totals 58.99 tons, 4.7411 MCr, and Draws 675 MW at maximum rate of fire.

Performance is:

5: 52-1/17      10: 29-1/9      20: 14-1/5      40: 7-1/2

Its pretty crummy at long range, but with three shots, each at -5 Diff, it 
probably wont miss.  Firing every .75 seconds... if YOU were a fighter pilot, 
would you go anywhere near this thing???  :)

Eric Moore says (message 7987) that 1 MJ per square centimeter is enough to do
serious damage to antennas.  I agree with this, but GDW apparently doesn\'t.  
Their guidline for lasers is that 1 MJ per square cm is about a point of 
damage.  I think that warships would be built with a different design 
philosophy if large nukes were a mainstay of space combat.  A missile gets 
within 100 km, detonates, and then your blind because all of your antennas are
slag.  This isn\'t exactly a difficult fire control problem either.  Antennas
would be designed to better withstand this kind of abuse.  A zillion watt 
particle accelerator in a jillion ton vessel is useless if you\'ve burnt off all
the antennas.  maybe you could look through a porthole and aim???  :)

Large fusion bombs aren\'t that hard to build, especially at higher tech levels.
They\'re also MUCH cheaper than antimatter.  And even if you want to be 
environmentally conscious, there is a known fusion process that is entirely
clean.  Boron-11 fusing with a proton (hydrogen nucleus) produces a Carbon-12 
nucleus which is stable, and some gamma rays.  No positrons, no nasty 
radioactive waste.  Just soot.  Of course for it to be clean is has to be
detonated by inertial confinement (lasers), or by gravitic confinement if you
want to use that tech.  And boron-11 isn\'t even that rare.  The other naturally
occuring isotope (B-10 i think) is commonly used in reactor shielding.  The
palnt to separate natural boron are already lying around.  There\'s even piles
of Boron-11 already separated.  The only catch is that its a lot harder to make
it fuse than the hydogen reactions.

Another design point: forget solid fuel on space missiles.  Put a small 
powerplant (2 MW) and a 8G HePlaR drive on it.  Then you can carry about 100
g-turns of fuel, and fly circles around other missiles.  And why not more than
one warhead.  The missiles in Brilliant Lances aren\'t very optimized.  Unless
an 8G missile needs 80 points of armor.  This is clearly ridiculous.  40cm of 
steel on a 7m long missile?????  what were they thinking???

This doesn\'t make any sense.  Under what theory can a corporation 

own its shares and grant possession of them to shareholders, when shares 

themselves are merely evidence of ownership?  Shareholders provide capital 

only once, when they buy.  Lenders providing loan facilities maybe have 

some duty to render service in the form of providing capital.

Fealty is loyalty.  How is the provision of money equivalent to loyalty?  

The Chairman--and, more importantly for this discussion, the CEO--

owe a duty of loyalty to the company and the shareholders, not the other 

way around.

Again, you\'ve turned the relationships around.  The shareholders aren\'t
vassals;

rather, the management of the corporation owes a duty of loyalty to them,

to maximize the value of their investment.  The employees of the corporation

are closer to vassals of the CEO, and maybe a feudal structure could be

arranged around this idea.



Hans Rancke writes

I (probably obviously) agree with this analysis.  What is being held in
tenancy, 

and what kind of service, are the defining issues here.

Actually, I think you will find that a laser can have any beam divergence 
you like!
Check out the laser formulae in FF&S.
You can see the remote because you program it to send frequent messages to 
you.
The advantage of a laser communicator is that the high frequency allows the 
antenna to be much smaller than a radio frequency antenna of the same beam 
divergence. Also a true tight beam radio communicator would be just as hard 
to jam as an equivalent laser communicator!

The communications lag is a real problem if you are trying to do "seat of 
the pants" flying by direct control but is less so if a certain amount of 
automation is allowed.
By fitting your remote with sensors and a computer capable of determining a 
target solution it can attack the enemy without direct intervention of the 
controller!
The computer can also be programmed to perform evasive maneuvers!
The remote controller\'s function is to make "executive" decisions; which 
ship to attack, when to evade, which sensors to use etc.

The K\'kree CAN use this for remote fighters but whether they WANT to after 
the effects of the virus on computer controlled weapon systems, particularly 
on those in constant communication with other computers is another matter.

I think the answer is yes. It better be in the Imperium, since FT\'s are so
common. A FT does not need to be capitalist - indeed the very system would
often dictate against capitalism. If control of a particular resource
determines one\'s place in society, selling it off may not make sense.
(As Hans mentioned in a previous posting). There does not necessarily even
have to be money (at least in the form we currently recognise it).

Slavery has been acknowledged as existing in a number of Traveller 
publications. By Imperium law, slavery is outlawed. However, by the policy
of imperial non-interference in local affairs, it seems that many local
populations effectively live in serfdom, if not outright slavery. It
also makes for stirring adentures and story-lines, regardless of 
whether it makes economic sense or not.

This actually is quite relevant. One characteristic of the feudal system
is some form of serfdom or slavery for the common people. In the 19th
century company-store-type wage-slavery produced a serf-like relationship
between employees and company owners - thus the industrial Robber-Barons
were born. Feudalism has been called a medieval protection racket. The
common people were almost powerless and lived at the whim of their lords.
Certainly, I associate feudalism with powerlessness for the common
people.

If this is a common attribute of FT\'s, then they will tend to be 
isolationist and xenophobic, at least at higher social levels, to prevent
the commons from getting ideas above their station. This also makes
social status extremely important in such a society, and anything that
risks it something to be avoided. Capitalism and the rising mercantile
class is what destroyed feudalism - money replaced land as the measure
of a person\'s worth, and penniless nobles found themselves in debt
to rich but unlanded merchants.

I will try to give an example of a non-capitalist FT.

Consider a vacuum world with a number of population centres. At some stage
the environmental engineers controlling the life support systems perform a
takeover and gain political power by virtue of their technical knowledge
ie. their ability to selectively turn off the life support systems. This 
covers the technocracy aspect of the definition.

The takeover being successful, the engineers use the already-established
life-support regions to define their individual holdings, or feifs.
Holding the de-facto power of life and death in these regions, they can
distribute the control of industries and buildings pretty much as they
desire, creating vassals. The people in these regions are dependent on 
their Regional Engineer (Baron/Lord) for their continued existence. 
Resources are traded between regions on the barter system, the resources
including workers (serfs/slaves) with special skills. Engineers provide
their serfs with all the necessities of life for service, not payment. 
A Planetary Engineer (king) may or may not exist, but if he does he 
adjudicates disputes between regional engineers, appoints replacements 
when there is no clear successor and appoints new engineers to newly 
formed regions, which may occur from building or reorganisation. 
This is the feudal component of the FT.

The above system could use money, but I left it out to make my point.
(perhaps they have a religious objection - after all, money is the
root of all evil). The above system will only work so long as the
serfs accept their subordinate position. An Engineer\'s title depends
on his control of the life-support apparatus of his area, and trading
or selling it means losing control of that region. Anyone who gains
control of a region must be able to operate it\'s environmental systems,
as that is the basis of his rule there, whether that is personal 
control or control of subordinates loyal to him - but the latter leaves
him open to betrayal and takeover by his subordinates.

This is just one example, and I hope it is a useful contribution to this
ever-expanding thread.

Quite possible. It was a judgement call wether the coyns had been modified
during the 2000-year Ancients period. Just as it was a judgement call that
the pre-Ancients didn\'t have more than one set of coyns. I decided in the
end that though coyns had been important during the Ancient period (as
evidenced by their widespread occurence in Ancient installations) they
had not been of such paramount importance as they became when casting
became dependent on them (In fact, a case could be made for the caste
coyns not being original, but that would leave me with six more to make
up).

Right. In my universe Grandfather (Or rather, those mysterious beings who
gave rise to the Grandfather myth) last revised the coyns around -1000.

I hadn\'t thought much about the interim sets. My players are on a Grand
Tour to a number of previously undetected Ancient sites in the Spinward
Marches (courtsey of a Hiver archeologist with an Ancient artifact) and
one of the stops will be Vanejen where the coyns failed to help the
Chirpers living there regain their ability to caste. Hence I\'ve concen-
trated on the Ancient sets the PCs will find in the sites and the first
coyn set that the Chirpers have kept for 75,000 years (quite a feat, that,
but all their coyn sets have 38 pieces  -  obviously an early variant).
Thanks for your ideas. They would certainly be relevnt for anyone 
excavating old Droyne ruins (as opposed to Ancient ruins). Unless, that
is, Grandpop didn\'t take care to recall each old set every time he put
out a revised edition... ;-)

I\'ve imagined that the criterion Gramps used to choose was a sizable 
number of planetary populations. That\'s why the Aslans are there in
spite of not having developed the jump drive themselves (Or perhaps
Gramps used the Major Race criterion and simply didn\'t realize that
the Aslans had \'cheated\').

Did they get off the planet in a big way?

Definitely a contender. But why would they be removed again? They are

And propably died out long before -75,000. Anyway, the Ancients propably
had lots of servant races. That\'s why I don\'t think the Vargr would be
on any Ancient coyns. Back then they were just one obscure experiment out 
of many.

Primordials? What Primordials? They\'ve never been heard of in my universe.

And any humans quite different too. In fact, the human on the -75,000 coyn
set is IMO a \'homo antiquitus\', humans the way they looked in Ancient times.

My premise is that the last revision took place around -1000.

>How about another dead alien race we\'ve never heard of before in Traveller?

First if you are to deliver a lot of missiles at one target, the turrets
and barbettes for these has to be better. Something like the VLS system
to USS Ticonderoga. And missiles take up premium space. And the rapid
firing laser thingie mentioned later will stop almost anything that
approaches of missiles. Do you see any use in missiles with 200 armor
points? It leaves precious little space for controls, warhead and drive.

Why must the nuke impact? I believe the electromagnetic pulse generated
will do enough damage to most ships within several hundred kilometers.

Nope, never in a hundred years. Even a brainwashed soldier wouldn\'t do
anything this crazy. But then again shit happens.


The discussion has taken a very militaristic slant. What about the
traders and pirates? I don\'t believe merchants will have access to the
best missiles possible. Those available might even be built in a way
that prevents them from detonating in a gravity well, or close to it.
Else any crazy nut can hold a planet for ransome.

From the designs of missiles I have seen from GDW to date are more
suited for civilian crafts than military crafts. Military crafts need
missiles with longer duration and more stealthy one too. Emission
masking on missiles, what are your thoughts about that?

Anyway, what I would really like to do is revise the GURPS fire combat
rules to make them a little more streamlined and less overwhelming in
damage. The two biggest complaints I have about non-fantasy/lowtech GURPS
is:
        Gun stats are too detailed for quick play.
        Damage is excessive.

I find that the range mods in GURPS go up and down to quickly to keep good
track of accurately, especially if more than 4 people are involved. I also
concur with the excessive damage - I believe ultratech combat stats could
be scaled back a tad with no problem.

ANYWAY - I was wondering if anyone else had done this, or would be
interested in the results.

ALso, I\'d like to use FF&S to create Shadowrun weapons - far more difficult
because of the way Shadowrun does damage. Any takers?

A couple of differences:
        First of all, a shareholder is not responsible for the development
of the shares the CEO & assorted lackeys are. Secondly, from a more
romantic point of view, loyalty and fealty do not come from being paid off,
but from the heart - this is an ideal which is nice, but historically there
were probably more than a few lords & vassals who contemplated loyalty
based on personal gain.

        I think you\'ve been approaching Techno-Feudalism wrong from the
beginning. From what I\'ve read in this exchange, the CEO of a corp and the
Baron of a fief are being equated. But who\'s got the power? The CEO runs
things, but he must answer to the Board of Directors, who are in turn
selected by the dominant shareholders (usually). Granted, the Baron has to
have some level of consent from his vassals (and initial consent is
strengthened by years of tradition and faith in the ruling family).
However, while the Baron has legal authority over his vassals and subjects,
the CEO of Corporation X has no legal authority over the shareholders.

        IMHO it is the predominant shareholders who have the ultimate
authority in a FT. Rail Baron Getty invests and eventually controls 35% of
Getty Rails. *He* is the Baronial equivalent, and the other stockholders
have their own fiefs - parts of Getty Rails. But since Getty owns most of
the company, everyone agrees to follow his lead (most of the time) and
looks to him for leadership.
The CEO, the Board of Directors - these are but the minions of the
fiefholders who maintain the company, equivalent (perhaps) to the Sheriffs,
Castellans, and others who were granted authority but not fiefs.

        Now, rather than going to war to acquire more fiefs, Getty simply
invests in another company. This can lead to hostile takeovers, poison
pills, and all the other trendy economic actions involved in mergers &
buyouts. If it works, Getty gets a significant portion of another company\'s
stock. It may not be controlling interest, but then again, King Henry never
controll all or even most of France, either.
        The other shareholders can initiate their own dealings and
eventually acquire a power base outside the company - but Baron Getty might
be aware and could take steps to prevent them from getting far.

How\'s that for Feudal Technocracy?

My OED offers for technocracy: n. Organization an management of a countries

And for feudal system: medieval European form of government based on relation
of vassel and superior arising from holding land in feud.

and GDW offers the laconic definition for feudal technocracy:  Government by
specific individuals for those who agree to be ruled.  Relationships are based
on the performance of technical activities which are mutually beneficial.

Now David Johnson (if I have this straight) has argued for the equivalence of
"share fiefs" with "industrial fiefs".  I cannot accept this because a share
holder performs no TECHNICAL service for the corporation.    He provides 
Capital and receives dividends and a measure of control.  I think this is 
a more proper role for a Capitalist, not a Technocrat.

If, on the other hand, the ruler grants an industrial fief to a vassel the 
vassel will have a technical role - managing the industry.  He must then 
find "vassels" for the feifs within the plant, say the Information Systems
fief.

Thinking about this, I think perhaps the "Industrial Feudalism" of Mote Prime
(Niven & Pournelle) resembles a "Feudal Technocracy" as well.

As a side note, while Aristocratic terminology rang true for Piper\'s Sword
Worlds, it probably confuses the issue in this debate, since the historical
view of a Medieval Duke is of a person whose only skills were in military
matters; the feif itself was run by a paid employee.

More or less. But the discussion keeps shifting to new interesting aspects.
Now you\'re trying to suspend our disbelief in the notion that three different 
UWP listings for the Spinward Marches made over a period of at least 12 years 
could possibly have _all_ the population data identical.

>I merely stated that since there were changes to the UWP data over this 
>fifteen year period 

It is 17 years if your\'re talking about data from the earliest Traveller
background material (which didn\'t have population multipliers) and 12
years if you\'re talking about the three full listings I\'ve mentioned
before. The only change I know of (although there may be others; I\'ve 
only spot checked) is Regina\'s change from TL 10 to TL 12, and it was
suggested that that was merely a correction of a typo.

>*and* the population and other figures were not changed that it must be 
>*assumed* to have been done intentionally.

Only if there is no simpler explanation. I suggest that they are all three
based on the same census and that only the allegiance codes were updated
for the _Imperial Encyclopedia_ and the _Megatraveller Journal_ publications.
If there should be a few differences (and with a spot check of 10% of the
systems I didn\'t find a single one) I suggest that they are typos or
corections of typos.

Agreed. As a matter of fact I\'m of the opinion that the history of the
settlement of Charted Space does not make sense unless one postulates
that most well-developed worlds (not excluding the Aslan ones) practise
population control. But to go from there to the assumption that _all_
worlds in the Spinward Marches (a not yet developed area, after all)
practise it is IMO to go to far. 

>Keep in mind as well that due to rounding conventions, a 10% increase (or

>the actual UWP population code *if* the population multipler is 9.

I\'m well aware of that. I used 10% as an average. Remember that roughly 10%
of the worlds should have a mantissa of X.4 (whatever X may be) and that in
that case considerably less than 10% increase is necessary to kick it over
into the next higher number. A world with a mantissa of 8.4, for example,
needs only a 1.2% increase to reach 8.5. Fulacin, a TL 5 world with a 
population of 543 million in 1105 needs only a 1.3% increase. In 17 years!

>It\'s my impression that most worlds in the Spinward Marches are going to be
>more equivalent in terms of population growth to contemporary `developed\'
>nations than to `developing\' nations (just my opinion).  

They certainly _ought_ to be, since they\'ve had up to ten centuries of
developement. Yet Spinward Marches is again and again referred to as a
\'frontier\'  -  not only in the \'frontier with other nations\' sense, but
also the \'developing area\' sense. Certainly scores of systems seems to
be woefully undeveloped.

>Furthermore, while one might expect high birth rates and low death rates 
>(due to available high tech medical care) on `developing\' worlds one would 
>also expect high rates of *emigration* (to high population worlds) to keep 
>the net growth rate low.

Now, are you SURE you\'re not allowing the discussion to affect your good
sense here? I would expect a lot of emigration FROM high-population planets
to developing low-population planets. That\'s usually the way it goes here
on Earth: From the crowded (or opressive) to the less crowded.

Oh, sure. But that should register too, shouldn\'t it?

Far more unlikely. I refer you to the examples of Forboldn, Fulacin, and
Vanejen. Each of them ought to have had changes in population, most likely 
also TL and starport type in the case of the first two. In each case the
lack of change could be explained away. But it would have to be explained
AWAY. And my point is that if you need a new and distinct explanation for 
each world you examine, then a simpler solution that explains them all is 
to be preferred. I stand by my claim that the three different UWP listings 
we have are one and the same (and one that was already somewhat out of date 
in 1110).

                         incredible, surely?

I see no reason why both can\'t be true. Nevertheless, if you think that the
Zhodani help alone is sufficient (and I don\'t intend to dispute that) and
you don\'t believe the other then don\'t use it. (But I STILL think the
developement of the Spinward Marches has been slow, SLOW, *S*L*O*W*!!!)

I\'d say that it\'s the same kind of "possible" you get when you\'re talking
about all the air in a room suddenly collecting under one table. Sure, it\'s
*possible*. ;-)

The size of a unified economy, yes. But do you really think that the Mexican 
economy is the more stable because of the size of the population of the US?

Oh, far, far from it. Orders of magnitude different. But then, I know 
something of statistics and can\'t see the population thing happening in
a thousand years and have very little knowledge of economics and see no
difficulty at all in those economic swings. As for putting numbers on it, 
that\'s difficult. But taking a wild stab I\'d say that at any given year at 
least one in a hundred worlds inside the Imperium is getting shafted enough
by outside manipulation to be on the decline and several times that number 
outside the Imperium. Exactly how long it takes for a downturn to affect
the TL is another difficulty. Not less than 10 years, I\'d say. And of course
a downturn would not always last long enough (As you can see, I\'m weaseling
like crazy. That\'s because I really know too little about economics to put
numbers on anything. But I\'ll have a shot at defending these ones).

Yes, but are you saying that 10 billion people have a greater difficulty
affecting 1 billion people than 1 billion people have affecting 100 million?
My guessing bone tells me that the proportions would remain roughly the
same.

Oh yes it is. This is one thing I\'m certain of (as defined by Traveller,
that is). There are scores of low-population worlds with a high-tech
classification that they couldn\'t _possibly_ maintain on their own
population base. In 1105 Fulacin ran a Type A starport and a TL of 13
with a population of 800. You couldn\'t even run a civilization with
half that TL with that. All these worlds must have their TLs artificially
maintained by outside sources.

The question is, are missiles of any use at all.  In the context of GDW\'s rules 
(which is what I plan to go by) it is easy enough to armour capital ships over 
the penetration limit off the 500Kt det-laser.  However, I do not think that the
potential damage to sensors and shields can be ignored, so some form of 
point-defence is needed.

The benefit is that, by launching a missile attack against my opponent, even if 
I cannot penetrate his defences, I am forcing him to either (1) use his main 
weapons (which could otherwise be punching holes in my capital ships) to defeat 
the attack or (2) allocate resourses at design time to either point defence or 
specialized zone defence ships. 

I am going to want some more BL experience before I commit myself to where the 
tradeoff lies.

I think its a tautaulogy  that enough missiles can saturtate any defence.  You 
just have to define enough as 1 + the number of missiles that could be destroyed
by 100% effective point defence fire.  I think your point is that it might not 
be worth it, which is true.

Well, chances are any crazy nut CAN hold a planet for ransom.

I do plan to play with these rules a bit.  None of the weapons I have seen in 
TNE (I am still wating for BL) seem to rate very highly for fleet use.  Most of 
the ships seem to be equivalent to light cutters with machine guns, and the 
pirate equivalents.  I think major combat units will be quite a bit different.  
One of the criteria I am using for hull design is the armour to defeat 
penetration by any basic game laser.

Traveller 73 is worth picking up, if only for "Strange Lights Over
Hokum", a GREAT TNE adventure by Mike Mikesh (sp?  sorry!).  While set
in the TNE, it could easily be converted to any era, or GURPS Atomic
Horror :-) (I\'m busily trying to figure out how to convert it to
Space:1889 ;-)

"Hokum" should appeal to people on both lists: it\'s a non-combat
oriented adventure with high amusement value.  I can give more
specifics, but I hate posting spoilers.

Product Release Dates: Confusingly, GDW keeps listing all the TNE
stuff as if it\'s available.  I know the RC Equipment Guide is out,
but what about Battle Rider?  Does anyone have a schedule?

    After reading much of your post, I think I am finally coming 
understand your point of view -- not necessarily agree with it, but at
least understand it.  The question arises: what is the difference 
between your view of "feudal technocracy" and laissez-faire 
capitalism, or libertarianism?  If the government concerns itself 
merely with external defense and preventing violent crime, and leaves 
economic interactions to "market forces", how does that differ from 
your picture of a "feudal technocracy"?

    Probably in much better shape.  Mexico\'s "formerly" socialist 
habits of nationalizing industries and "protecting" the hell out of 
them with tariffs, etc.  guaranteed inefficient, ineffective national 
industries unable to compete against an efficient free-market economy.  
With the opening up of Mexico, we are seeing more efficient, 
competitive Mexican companies going into partnership with U.S.  
companies and/or competing with them.

    I hate to burst your soap bubble, but the main thing keeping the 
EU economy from dominating the world is the "intervention once again 
of external government entities on both sides of the Atlantic".  The 
socialist, interventionist policies of most European nations has 
hobbled and crippled their economies to the point where most of these 
economies are on the edge of collapse from spiraling budget deficits 
and skyrocketing unemployment, all directly traceable to socialist 
"tax the producers until they can\'t produce anymore and throw revenues 
down a fiscal black hole" policies.  
    It has been repeatedly demonstrated that the best way to make an 
economy boom, and improve the standard of living for all is to provide 
the basic legal foundations for entrepreneurship to flourish (i.e., 
establish and respect property rights), and then get the government 
the hell out of the way!  Government intervention beyond protecting 
property rights just gums up the works.  The U.S.  is productive IN 
SPITE of the U.S.  Government; German corporations are productive in 
spite of the German government, and in spite of the European Union.

    It would be difficult at high-population levels, because feudalism 
depends on the responsibilties of each individual to each other 
individual, going up and down the ladder.  OTOH, many idealists have 
postulated that in an enlightened society, the only "government" would 
be that of each individual willingly carrying out his/her/its 
responsiblities and obligations to other individuals above and below 
him, a la feudalism.  I expect that a true Libertarian society would 
appear feudal with class mobility.  
    As for the concept that societies inevitably go from tribalism -> 
feudalism -> capitalism -> communism, (if that\'s what you\'re referring 
to) hasn\'t Marx been discredited yet?!?  :-)

No.  Most migrations are from rural areas to urban areas and result in
an increase in population in developed areas and a decrease in developing
areas.  Even in developed areas migration is only from the urban center 
to the suburban fringe.  There is no sigificant migration from New York
City to rural Iowa, much less to rural Somalia.  There has been a great deal
of migration from rural Haiti and rural Central America to urban Florida,
California and Texas.  Similarly, migration in the Regency can be expected
to be from low-pop worlds to high-pop worlds.  This may not show up as
changes in population figures because *a lot* of folks from *a lot* of
low pop worlds would have to immigrate to Porozlo, say, before the population
number there changes much.

To some extent, yes.  I\'m not sure what you mean by `unified\'.  Do you mean

I\'m not sure I get your point.  If you mean could an economy of 1 billion
easily affect a neighboring economy of 100 million (assuming somewhat
equivalent tech levles), I\'d have to agree.  If you mean could an economy
of 1 billion cause severe *fluctuation* (enough to affect tech level) in
a neighboring economy of 100 million, I\'d have to say again that it\'s not
very likely.  The larger economy would have to fluctuate quite a lot to
do that.  This might be more pronounced in a 10 million economy or smaller
though.

I think replying directly to specific quotes is beginning to stretch out
the discussion and making it difficult to maintain a coherent thread so
let me try to respond without quoting directly and then pick and choose
quotes `out of order\' as appropriate.  (If I miss an important point by
doing this please let me know.)

We seem to have spent a lot of effort discussing the `feudal\' portion of
feudal technocracy but not much discussing the `technocracy\'.  I\'ve tried
to suggest that a technocracy is much like a capitalist market economy but
haven\'t been very successful in describing how a technocracy is *different*
from a capitalist market economy.  The main difference as I see it is that
in a capitalist market economy there are government entities external to
the marketplace that provide the political framework which allows the
market economy to function.

Hans Ranke <rancke@diku.dk> asks for a definition of technocracy which
seems like a good place to start.

Grabbing a handy dictionary (I know others have already done this):

Technocracy: government by technicians, specifically management of society
  by technical experts.

This refers to the *nature* of authority.  It defines the ruling class.
What is meant by `technicians\' and `technical\' experts though?

Technical: having special, usually practical knowledge, especially of a
  mechanical or scientific subject.

This is the first of several definitions.  Of particular interest is the
sixth definition: 

Technical: (6) resulting chiefly from internal market factors rather than
external influences.

This suggests a technocracy is a government where authority is exercised by
a class with specialized knowledge.  This knowledge is somehow practical,
scientific and related to market forces.  This suggests technology which is
the confluence of the practical application of science and the requisite
economic factors that permit that application.  Hence, technocracy is rule
by an industrial class based upon the `practice of technology\' - everything
that is required for technological endeavor.

A technocracy ties political power (government) to economic power (industry,
the `practice of technology\').  This is something much more sophisiticated
than mere government by engineers and scientists.  It takes much more than
just engineers and scientists to successfully run industry and an industrial
economy.

In contemporary market economies much of the political framework that 
permits the industrial economy to function is provide by democratically
established governments that exist external to the economic system.
Furthermore, the basis for political power is also outside of the economic
system.  (Keep in mind the above `sixth\' definition of technocracy here.)
Thus, contemporary capitalist systems are not technocracies.

Nevetheless, any technocracy needs a political framework to permit the
functioning of the industrial economy.  To meet the requirements of a
technocracy this framework must arise from *within* the market place.
One way to do this is for the strongest economic actor to establish this
framework.  One might call this `autocratic technocracy\' or "what\'s good
for General Motors is good for planet Earth".

Another means might be to establish this framework through a formalized
system of well-defined relationships between the various actors in the
industrial economy.

Let\'s grab that dictionary again:

Feudalism: the system of political organization [prevailing in medieval
  Europe] having as its basis the relation of lord to vassal with all land
  held in fee and as chief characteristics homage, the service of tenants
  under arms and in court, wardship, and forfeiture.

Now medieval feudalism, as we\'ve already seen, was closely tied to the
the ownership of land.  This was the *nature* of the authority in a 
medieval feudal structure - it defined the ruling class just as "specialized
knowledge" or industrial proficiency defines the ruling class in a
technocracy.

There was more to the feudal system though.  It was based upon "the relation
of lord and vassal" with respect to that which defined the the ruling class,
namely land.  The characteristics of fedualism (homage, service, wardship,
forfeiture, etc.) were all manifestations of this relationship between the
actors in the feudal system.  Feudalism provided the framework needed to
permit the fuedal economy to function.  It did this through a formalized
system of well-defined relationships between the various actors in the
feudal economy.

Sound familiar?  That\'s just the sort of thing that might provide the
political framework in a technocracy.

Whew!  I feel like I deserve some college credit for all that!  :-)

Okay, now let\'s look at some specifics of the discussion that might help
to further illustrate this point.

Hans writes:

Nation-states *are* the `external government entities\'.  They are not actors
*within* the industrial economy.

Of course not.  This is the essence of a capitalist market economy.  It\'s not
a technocracy though.

This misses the point.  First, there was not a capitalist system within
the Soviet Union.  In centrally-planned economies the government *is* an
*internal* entity in the economy but this most certainly is *not* an
`industrial economy\', i.e. one geared solely to the `practice of technology\'.
Centrally-planned economies have other goals such as full-employment.
Furthermore, *political* power is not tied to economic power but rather
is *superior* to economic power.  (Hence all the unprofitable but still-
powerful industrial actors in the former Soviet states.)

There is currently no entity (external *or* internal to the economy) within
the former Soviet states to provide a framework under which an industrial
economy can function.  Thus there is no legal framework to guarrantee 
access to profits, rates of exchange, control of investment or any of the
other factors necessary to conduct profit-oriented industry.

[BTW, I\'m not claiming `industrial economy\' is `better\' than any other
system, I\'m just explaining what\'s necessary for it to function since I
see that as the goal of a technocracy.]

Exactly (except for the part about "without a government").  It is clear
from all of these examples that some sort of framework is needed.  In all
of these cases that framework is established by governmens acting external
to the industrial economy.  In the former Soviet states, in the European
Union, under GATT, the only recourse of any economic actor to seek redress
for mistreatment is through its own local governmental entity or through
structures established and enforced by its local governmental entity.
There are no agreements between, say, a Kazakh oil field and an Australian
drilling corporation, that are not enforced by some governmental entity
that exists *external* to the marketplace.

These are all elements of the capitalist system.  None of them are elements
of a technocracy.

> Of course one can have market systems without government supervision. Well,

You need someone to print currency, to establish procedures to guarrantee
control of investments and access to profits, to control monetary supplies
and rates or exchange, etc.  In capitalist market economies governmental
entities external to the market perform these functions.  Under technocracy
these functions are performed *internal* to the market.

Let\'s take for example this idea of a `technocractic lord\' `selling\' shares
in her enterprise to a `technocractic vassal\' in exchange for financial
capital.  Under a capitalist system the goverment prints that money and 
guarrantees its value.  In a technocracy the lord and vassal must come
to some agreement themselves as to just what that `financial capital\'
is worth because the vassal (shareholder) doesn\'t have any `money\' to
`give\' to the lord (chairman).  In essence, money is nothing more than a
promise guarranteed by the government.  In a feudal technocracy, feudal
principals are used to guarrantee that `promise\' internally to the market.

I think that\'s enough for now.  I hope I\'ve made some progress in explaining
what, IMHO, a feudal technocracy is.  To recap:

1. The nature of authority: authority is exercised by those possessing
   specialized knowledge related to the practice of technology as manifest
   in an industrial economy.
2. Politcal power and thus the framework for the industrial economy must
   arise from *within* the industrial economy.
3. Feudal principles will be used to establish the framework through a
   system of well-defined relationships between the actors in the market.

Remember, it\'s feudal *technocracy*, not technocratic feudalism.

I see this `evidence of ownership\' as being analogous to the feudal title
granted by an aristocractic lord to his vassal tenants.  Ownership of a
portion of industry in a technocracy (a block of shares) is the same
as *tenancy* under the feudal system.

> Shareholders provide capital 
> only once, when they buy.

No.  In a technocracy where there is no governmental entity external to the
industrial economy to print, manage and guarranty currency the shareholders
must have a well-defined and continuous relationship with the technocractic
lord in order to guarranty the value of and access to that capital.

> Fealty is loyalty.  How is the provision of money equivalent to loyalty?  

In a technocracy there is no external entity to provide `money\'.  What
serves as currency in a technocratic system must be arranged through
agreement by the participants.  One might call the shareholders portion
of this agreement `loyalty\'.  The key is that the system requires inter-
dependent relationships between the actors - `lord\' and `vassal\'.

Don\'t confuse CEO and Chairman (and I have been guilty of this myself in
the past).  The CEO is just the `chamberlain\' who sees to the day to day
operations.  The Chairman is the technocratic lord.  An aristocratic
lord had a duty to his vassals to provide coordinated security services.
A technocractic lord (Chairman) has a duty to her vassals (shareholders)
to provide coordinated profit services.

Focus on the `duty\' rather than the more nebulous `loyalty\'.  IMHO, it\'s
important to examine how things such as `loyalty\' are manifest in order
to apply feudal principles to technocracy.

No.  I\'ve said this before.  There is no `inter-relatedness\' between
employee and employer.  The corporate model is a specialized form of
autocracy.  It is in no way feudal.

A block of the corporate enterprise is held in `tenancy\' in exchange for
the `service\' required to guarranty the access to and value of financial
capital.

I\'d have to disagree.  A technocracy may not have to be capitalist but it
involves much more than the control of resources or a particular technology.
A technocracy is government by the class of individuals responsible for 
the complete `practice of technology\'.  In a capitalist system this role
is played by the actors in the industrial economy (but these actors do
not have political power to match their economy power which is what makes
them different from technocrats).

> This actually is quite relevant. One characteristic of the feudal system

No.  Feudalism defined the relationships *between* the members of the
ruling class, not between the ruling class and the ruled classes.  Serfdom
occurred in concert with feudalism but was not part of feudalism.

> Capitalism and the rising mercantile
> class is what destroyed feudalism

No.  The rise of the mercantile class destroyed the feudal ruling class and
hence the framework of interactions between the members of that ruling
class, feudalism, disappeared.  Concurrent with the ascendancy of the
mercantile class was a separation of political power from economic power.
In a technocracy these two spheres of power are reunited.

> I will try to give an example of a non-capitalist FT.

Any system in which a group of elites control some crucial technology to
exercise control of the remaining populace is neither feudal nor
technocractic.  It\'s not feudal because there is no `inter-relatedness\'
between the participants and it\'s not technocratic because those who
control a particular critical technology are not involved in the `practice
of technology\'.

Nor was an aristocratic vassal responsible for providing coordinated 
security services.  The `development\' of a technocratic fief (shares)
is associated with the responsibilites necessary to guarrantee the
value of and access to the capital provided to the technocratic lord.

And in a technocracy where the value of, access to and control of `money\'
must be guarranteed through the `agreements\' between `lord\' and `vassal\'
one might find some `romantic\' aspects for loyalty as well.

> However, while the Baron has legal authority over his vassals and subjects,

Well, first, again, the CEO is not the `technocratic lord\', the Chairman
is.  This `legal basis\' for any relationship in a capitalist market
economy is provided by the government entity external to the market. In
a technocracy there must be some relationship between the `lord\'
(Chairman) and the `vassals\' (shareholders)  that is developed among
themselves.  This is the basis for all `legal\' issues between them.  For
example, in a market economy the external government entity guarrantees
the value of the capital provided by the shareholder to the chairman.  In
a technocracy the `lord\' must have some means to ensure the value of and
access to this capital.  In a feudal technocracy, feudal agreements
between lord and vassal will do this.

This is no different from `Baron Gustaf\' who provides 35% of the military
forces in an aristocratic duchy.  This is what I\'ve been saying all along.
The shareholders are the equivalent of medieval feudal barons.

The CEO, yes.  The Chairman, no, because without the role of the external
government entity to enforce the `legal\' behavior of the Chairman this
person controls all of the financial capital provided by the shareholders.
The only way for the shareholders to guarrantee their own access to their
funds, in the absence of the external governmental entity, is through a
series of agreements with the technocratic lord (chairman).

Look at your OED definition of technocracy again.  It doesn\'t talk about
`technical service for a corporation\'.  It talks about `management of
industrial resources\', i.e. industrial holdings or `fiefs\'.

These are `proper roles\' for both.  The difference is that a capitalist
has a government entity external to the market to establish the framework
for interaction there.  A technocrat must establish this framework internal
to the market.  The most powerful technocrat can establish this framework
through fiat if she\'s powerful enough.  That might be called `autocratic
technocracy\'.  If there is no single technocrat powerful enough to establish
this framework herself then some system of agreements must be reached
among the various technocrats to establish the framework.  In a feudal
technocracy, feudal principles are used to establish this framework.

Good point.  I think we\'ve begun to get past this though.

Great work all!  Some very constructive, interesting and valuable

in the TNE book.
 
    <The also might have a few nasty viruses in bottles to unleash on
opponents.> The Regency does have a bottled, and maybe semi-tame
virus it is using (though if asked they don\'t have such a thing). And
there is a concern between all the Spinward states of going to war
because of the Virus threat, either because your enemy well set it on
you, or because it might leak through because your assets are tied up
fighting the other guy.
 
    <An interesting concept.  Does this mean *every* military asset in the
Regency must be retrofitted in some fashion?> This seems to be the case.
And makes sense.
 
    <internal disorder (Rebellion)> This seems to be the biggest factor,
but it looks like I said earlier. It seems to be restricted to
assassinations.
 
    <Kirsch> Care to post your designs? I\'m sure there are plenty of people
who might like to see/use them.
 
    <Kirsch: Is someone compiling the submitted weapon specs in one archive?>
I have something of a compilation. There aren\'t many yet.
 
    <Howie: GM=1> Government Modifier? I\'m not sure offhand, but that\'s my
guess.
    <I presume "Early" "Average" and "High" technologies correspond to TL
13, 14 and 15?> See Megatraveller. Early Stellar, Average Stellar, and
High Stellar. I think 9-11, 12-13, and 14-16?
 
     <Plus RCEs and Regency ship classifications will differ...Please
xpand on this point.> The RCES seems to have very limited ship building
capacity. Actually change that to has very limited ship building capacity.
The Regency on the other hand still has almost the entire shipbuilding
capacity it did before the Virus (and might even be better now after the
Virus do to various needs).
 
    <BTW, how can I get at more documentation of this sort?> On disk. IBM.
By joining HIWG.
 
     <Jeff: Also, can anyone tell me how to go about getting the Sunbane

     <What I\'d like to know is, "What publishers\' material is considered
\'official\'?"> GDW, DGP, FASA. High Passage, 3rd Imperium(?), Far
Traveller(?). Maybe more. I think it mostly depends on what the
main writers considered worthwhile material. Or the quality of the
material itself.
 
     <Fuedal Technocracy> An idea here might be rather than shares in a
corporation the vassals. They might give patents instead (at least this
would allow for something different than shares, though shares seems
to have been what has been used by the Imperium).
 
 
    <A zillion watt particle accelerator in a jillion ton vessel is

I\'d have two thoughts. First would be back-up folding array antennas,
the second would be either missile(rpv) or fighter based sensor arrays that
feed the info to the larger vessel and for that matter extend it\'s
sensor range.

When people have a choice they tend to move to improve their lives.  This 
is called the free choice model.  It doesn\'t work very well when the 
people who are being moved have little or no choice.  Forced relocation 
is occurring all over the globe.  To say that people move from rural to 
urban or from crowded to spacious is really simplifying the situation.  
Both situations occur but not with the same groups of people.  On Earth, 
workers are migrating from rural areas to urban areas in search of work 
to feed themselves and their families.  On Earth, after WW2 in the US, 
many people moved from the cities to the suburbs.  This caused urban 
decay.  Now urban areas are being backfilled by the single and relativly 
wealthy, displacing the urban poor who lived there earlier.  The point is 
that many factors influence populations.  If you want to explain why 
there are planets with 242 people on them and next door planets with 242 
BILLION people you will have to try harder...

What does that have to do with it? If an authoritaive source makes a misprint,
that misprint can make it\'s way into a lot of secondary publications that
rely on the primary source. Then the primary source is reprinted and the 
typo corrected; all without the original source being updated. And if it
wasn\'t a misprint we\'re back to my old question: Why did it take Regina
many centuries to reach TL 10 when they advanced two TLs from 1107 to 1110?

It might make for migration from rural areas on low-pop worlds to urban areas 
on the same worlds (always providing that such planets had urban areas). The
classic SF theme is from overcrowded planets to frontier planets. And the
only colonization project we have any knowledge of (The Forboldn Project,
mentioned in _Kinunir_) has people transported to the Spinward Marches from
the Core.

An economy so tied together as to actively compensate for fluctuations in 
production. A large country is less suceptible to a bad harvest because 
the governing forces can transport food from areas not affected to areas
affected. If the same population was a number of isolated economies, the
very same harvest would cause some of these countries disaster despite
the total number of people involved being the same.

It fits my understanding perfectly. Some outsider brings in (or some local
imports) the machinery needed to produce some kind of high-tech stuff from
local raw materials. As long as the factory is functioning that planet is
effectively of the equivalent tech level  -  even if the factory has to
be maintained with imported spare parts.

Here\'s the fallacy. Nothing in the definition requires the expertise to be
economic. Sure, it _could_ be  -  if economy is accepted as a science with
an associated technology. Focussing on the sixth most common meaning on a 
word to the exclusion of all other meanings seems very specious. I\'d be 
happier if you could include some of the more common meanings too. The 
definition of technocracy didn\'t say "see _Technical_ (6)", did it? Any 
society managed by technical experts would seem to fit.

>A technocracy ties political power (government) to economic power (industry,
>the `practice of technology\').  

Not at all. A society whhere political power is tied to economic power might 
well be a technocracy, but to conclude that a technocracy has to be such a 
society is a complete fallacy. Of course, a government that is a technocracy
must tie political power to some kind of technological expertise. 

>This is something much more sophisiticated than mere government by engineers

If economics is a science, then a technician can run an economy. If it\'s not
a science then someone who can run an economy can\'t be merely a technocrat
(By definition). However, a mere government by engineers and scientists is
enough to satisfy the definition and is therefor a technocracy. You won\'t
prove your point by narrowing your definitions down to a point where the
only thing that fits is your concept. Stick with the broad definitions.

Why does it have to be democratically established? Any sort of government,
however established, that allows free market economics is sufficient.

A complete red herring. To meet the requirements of a technocracy, the
leaders of the society must be chosen for their technical expertise.
Nothing more, nothing less.

Of course they are. Why would one country impose trade restrictions against
another except at the instigation of its economic sector? The negotiations
that takes place between nation-states may take place at the political
level, but it\'s roots are in the economic sector. If General Motors didn\'t
give a hoot in hell about Japanese cars on the American market, do you
think the President would? However, that wasn\'t quite my point. One of the
prime functions of a government is to be a superior force that can enforce
laws. Sovereign nations don\'t have any government themselves. That\'s what
the \'sovereign\' means. (In the last half century the nations of the world
have been trying to bootstrap some sort of system superior to the individual
nations. I doubt anyone will argue that they\'ve succeeded yet. When they 
do, they won\'t be sovereign anymore). So any deal struck between sovereign
nations are examples of deals made without government intervention 
(government of those nations, was what I meant). If those deals are economic 
in nature they are examples of economic deals done without government 
intervention.

>Exactly (except for the part about "without a government").  It is clear
>from all of these examples that some sort of framework is needed.  

No. It is clear that most nations today think that some sort of framework
is desirable. But history is full of examples of economic deals struck
between people who had nothing but the good faith of their opponent (and
his hoped-for desire to continue trading) to ensure the fullfillment of
the deal. In fact, unless two nations have an undertaking to protect each 
other\'s traders even against their own, no deal between traders of
different nationalities has anything more to protect them.

Insofar as most governments frown on non-government-sanctioned force you\'re
quite right. They can\'t be _enforced_. But you can still make agreements. 
And in the old days some merchants could, indeed, enforce their deals. The 
Honourable East India Company is an extreme example, but any armed merchant-
man could do it in the absence of an _opposing_ government. So you might
actually say that one only needs government help to enforce agreements if 
there are governments around.

Promisory notes backed by the issuing company.

I don\'t quite know what you mean by "control of investments and access to 
profits", but any procedures can be established by negotiations between
the individual companies.

Control in what way, and why can this not be done by negotiation?

They do so today, but they are not necessary. Convenient, maybe.

This is what the do today (and it\'s a piss-poor system), but they didn\'t do
so before they left the gold standard. Before that money was backed by real
value. There is no reason why a company can\'t issue it\'s own money, backed
by it\'s own ressources. In fact, that\'s what they do every time they write
a check. A bank note is nothing more than a promisory note. So is a check.

>In a technocracy the lord and vassal must come to some agreement themselves 
>as to just what that `financial capital\' is worth because the vassal 
>(shareholder) doesn\'t have any `money\' to `give\' to the lord (chairman).  

So what does the \'vassal\' bring to the deal? And if he dosen\'t bring anything
does that mean that you agree with me? (And why did you use the example of 
Sacnoth industrialists buying Gram industries as an example of why a feudal 
technocracy was vulnerable to a stronger economic entity?)

>In essence, money is nothing more than a promise guarranteed by the

Right. But in earlier times many banks issued their own notes. Just because
governments today dosen\'t allow that dosen\'t mean that it can\'t be done. A
market economy dosen\'t _need_ a government to provide money.

Like the man who gets to run the factory is under a specific obligation to
the liege-lord who made him manager. I agree completely.

What\'s the difference? Or rather, what do you think is the difference?

Why, so do I!

There\'s a small, but important difference between ownership and tenancy that
makes it impossible to equate the two. (Hint: with ownership you own, with
tenancy you don\'t).

Leaving aside that you can have technocracy with or without a government and
that you can have money with or without government and government with or
without currency (I use \'currency\' as \'government-backed\' money here)...
hmmm... leaving that aside there\'s not much left of that argument...

I can\'t keep repeating myself each time this comes up, so from now on
please insert your own \'Fallacy!\' comment after every occurrence.

>What serves as currency in a technocratic system must be arranged through
>agreement by the participants.  

Not \'must be\'. \'Can be\'. One company could put out money backed by its 
products, another money backed by its. Or they could use some rare metal. 
Or government-backed money. There are lots of possibilities.

>One might call the shareholders portion of this agreement `loyalty\'.  

So the socalled shareholders does not provide any goods or capital? This
begins to resemble my notions more and more.

>The key is that the system requires inter-dependent relationships between 
>the actors - `lord\' and `vassal\'.

Absolutely right. Otherwise it\'s not a feudal arrangement. But by now you
can drop the quotes around lord and vassal. If the vassal dosen\'t buy the
\'share\' then he is a vassal and his lord a lord.

>The Chairman is the technocratic lord.  An aristocratic lord had a duty to 
>his vassals to provide coordinated security services.

That\'s true enough. _In addition_ to giving out the fief in exchange for
the loyalty of the vassal the lord also assumed the duty to protect his
vassal.

>A technocractic lord (Chairman) has a duty to her vassals (shareholders)
>to provide coordinated profit services.

That makes sense. In addition to giving them their fiefs she also assumes
the duty to protect them financially. A good analogy. Of course, the
crucial part of the feudal relationship is the providing of the fiefs,
since lots of other systems require the leader to protect the followers.
In fact, I can\'t think of any that dosen\'t.

>Focus on the `duty\' rather than the more nebulous `loyalty\'.  

Not a good idea. In a feudal relationship both sides have duties to the 
other part, so you can\'t say who\'s the lord and who\'s the vassal from 
that.

>A block of the corporate enterprise is held in `tenancy\' in exchange for
>the `service\' required to guarranty the access to and value of financial
>capital.

This is pure gibberish. Oh, sorry! I mean, I don\'t understand a word you\'re
saying here. Could you put it in layman\'s terms?

       Local temperature does vary to minor extent, but not by
       intent, and not to significant degree.


"Belters" are an independent bunch, and the fact that they may control
the government of an entire system does not change this fundamental
psychological attitude.  Glisten is a fine example of this.  Nominally,
the government is run by a civil service bureaucracy, but in practice,
a citizen of Glisten will avoid, ignore, or evade the bureaucracy
whenever he can get away with it.  Bribery, called by various names, is
not only not unusual, but in many areas it is an expected part of doing
business.  I saw virtually no sign of bureaucracy during my visit, and
would have chosen to call this government a "tempered functional
anarchy" rather than a civil service bureaucracy.

The anarchy begins at the starports, where the order of unloading and
CHI (Customs/Health/Immigration) processing is theoretically governed
by a list based on your class of ship and time of arrival at the port.
In reality, the list is reprinted within an hour of any ship\'s arrival,
based on how much "pull" a ship\'s captain (or shipowner\'s agent) has
exerted on Arrival Control.  It\'s not hard to find out the realities
versus the theoretical restrictions; a few minutes after passing a
cursory CHI inspection, I chatted with a group of stevedores and Customs
agents and found out that certain ships and shipping lines were given
preferential treatment because they gave "preferential considerations"
far above those offered by their competitors.  I was fortunate enough
to come in on one of these lines, but I was asked not to say which one,
as it could cause repercussions.  Once in Glisten (the idiom is "in
Glisten" rather that "on Glisten" because virtually no construction is
done on the exterior of the asteroids), however, the preferences are
virtually public knowledge.  The same attitude extends to
transportation.  Glisten has an unusual approach to transportation -
private vehicles are for all intents and purposes non-existent, but the
government operates no transportation facilities (other than
maintaining the starports).  Instead, the government licenses private
companies to operate "public" transportation.  Once the license is
issued (with the process simplified by liberal amounts of
"consultation"), the licensee pretty much determines what rates will be
charged and what routes will be operated.  I was greeted by a virtual
free-for-all at the transportation center; each company hires people to
"steer" passengers their way, and attempts to peel a customer from a
competitor\'s "redcap" are not unusual - and apparently, neither are the
resulting fistfights.  Glisten does maintain a police force, but their
function seems to be limited to making sure that innocent bystanders
don\'t get injured in these situations.  The customer is not considered
an innocent bystander, and neither is any bystander that voluntarily
enters the fray.

There are at least six companies that provide (read: sell) tourist
information; no two of them agree on anything but the names of the
streets in the city, and the locations of government offices and major
tourist attractions.  Each company has a preferred set of restaurants,
hotels, and various other service providers, and while there is some
overlap, no two lists are identical.  All of the restaurants and
service providers that I tried were quite acceptable, and provided
good value.  The hotel I stayed at was a pleasant place to stay at a
good price, and a quick visit to the others to look around seemed to
indicate comparable accommodations.  You will most likely do well at
any one of the choices; I\'d recommend that you look at three or four
before deciding, and choose the one whose ambiance most suits you.

There are a number of tourist attractions that should be placed on your
"must-see" list:

        1) the CourtArena.  This is where court cases are tried, and
           the local system of justice is quite interesting (and worth
           a separate RICE paper).  All I will say about it here is
           that there is de facto no distinction between civil and
           criminal justice as there is on most other worlds, and that
           watching a trial is an experience in itself.

        2) the Swim Center.  One of the public sport and exercise
           facilities, this one is dedicated to aquatic pursuits.  The
           center of the (small) asteroid that this is located in is
           hollow, and very large.  The entire asteroid is kept in
           zero-g, and the water is not contained in any way - you
           leave the locker room and enter the "pool", and you see a
           huge sphere of water hanging in front of you.  Caution is
           recommended when swimming; there is no natural tendency to
           "rise" to the surface, as there is no internal gravitational
           gradient.  Note to those from cultures with various body
           taboos - swimsuits of any sort are strictly optional.

        3) the Flight Center.  Similar to the Swim Center, except that
           a small gravitational gradient is maintained, to provide a
           sense of up and down, and there is no water.  Participants
           do wear "wings" and "tailfeathers", and lessons are
           available at low cost.  As exercise, it is at least as good
           as swimming, and many find it more exhilarating.  Those who
           suffer from disorientation in zero-g should come here,
           rather than the swim center.  Except for the wings and
           tailfeathers, costume is optional, although a very popular
           mode of dress is a tight body stocking, to reduce air
           resistance.  Wings and tailfeathers are usually decorated in
           varied patterns and colors, and the body stocking, when
           worn, can be equally colorful, in either complementary or
           clashing colors and patterns.  One deluxe rig that I saw was
           generic spacesuit grey, wings and body stocking both, until
           the wearer became airborne.  He then switched on a
           holographic generator, and actually appeared as a large
           bird, whose species I didn\'t recognize (he said later that
           it was a "roc", from Terran mythology dating back to "a
           couple of thousand years before space flight).

        4) the Museum of the Ancients.  Glisten itself was not an
           Ancient site that we know of, but they have nevertheless
           amassed a very complete collection of reproductions of
           Ancient artifacts, and a great deal of supplementary
           information.  The exhibits are quite fascinating, and quite
           educational.

The people of Glisten are in general a friendly bunch; the tourist who
gets lost will quickly be offered assistance, and the tourist who asks
for a recommendation for a restaurant or a hotel will get many.  Food
in Glisten runs to intense flavors, with extremely spicy food being
quite common.  On a visit to one of the outlying asteroids, I was a
guest of one of the local residents, and invited to a dinner party that
she was giving.  I found out the hard way that such dinner parties are
attempts by one person to outdo the neighbors in creating dishes so
spicy as to cause actual pain, and that it is a point of honor to
consume such dishes without showing outward sign of discomfort.  Much
as I like spicy food, I cannot recommend this pastime to anyone - not
even Glistenites (suffice it to say that I did not finish that dinner
with my gastronomic honor intact).  Asteroid construction being what it
is, there is not a lot of ability to have one\'s residence express one\'s
personality from outside, so most people don\'t try.  Instead, they
express their individuality in their styles of dress - ranging from
nothing but cosmetics all the way up to multiple layers of clothing in
colors and patterns and styles carefully chosen to draw attention,
sometimes in combinations that even a Vargr might find in questionable
taste.

Doing business in Glisten is theoretically governed by a thick book of
regulations that every business is required to have accessible to the
customers.  In reality, most of the regulations are ignored or
circumvented, and caveat emptor is an important part of business
dealings.  Almost anything is claimed to be available for sale, and
most of it actually is available.  A surprise was the presence of the
Corridor advanced-technology corporation "G"; in addition to a sales
outlet, they do some research locally.  This is the source of the "G"
and "H" codes in the technical profile.  It also enhances the
availability of low cost tech E and F goods of all types, allowing
Glisten to maintain its position as one of the leading shipyards in the
Spinward Marches.

The arrival of (and nominal conquest by) the Aslan New Lords has not
reined in the natural tendencies of Glistenites.  Indeed, some Aslan
customs have been adopted and adapted to Glistenite culture.  Duels of
honor, formerly treated as a private matter between the two parties,
have become much more public and ritualized, and many Aslan that I
spoke to asserted that the Glistenites are the only "fiyfiyalr" that
truly understand the ritual of the duel.  A few even claimed that
Glistenites have raised the art to levels beyond those achieved by all
but a very few legendary Aslan duellists.  Another Aslan custom, that
of "Assassination" has also been adopted, and integrated with the
duelling custom.  When Aslan embark on an assassination, the objective
is the death of the target.  Glistenites have instead made it a
campaign to embarrass the target, to provoke a duel, thus providing
more entertainment for a longer period of time.  Aslan reaction to this
adaptation of their customs has been mixed, and their social scientists
are watching this development carefully.

Aslan and Human mix freely in Glisten, and it is not unusual to see the
younger Aslan adopting Human customs or modes of dress, though in a
distinctly Aslan manner.  Aslan business concerns compete on an equal
footing with human concerns, making Glisten a shining example of just
how well the two species can get along, if both sides make an effort.
The local humans pay lip service to the Aslan males\' claims of land
ownership, and the Aslan females provide the males with the _real_
products of land ownership, economic power that provides prestige.  By
doing so in cooperation with the human society there, rather than
attempting to build economic power based strictly on Aslan models, they
achieve results far beyond the expectations of the leaders of the
ihatei expeditions.  It can be expected that these revelations will
cause as much change to the Aslan ihatei colonies as they will to the
human societies that they have conquered.

Absolutely, the Virus is just too dangerous to the Regency to not fight 
it with all possible assets.  Quarentine is one portion of what I 
conceive of as a multi-layered defense.  Naval Vessels play a critical 
role in destroying the Virally infected "Vampires".  The Navy must be 
able to at an absolute minimum disable a vampires j-drive and 
communications.  Most electronics in the regency should be "V-hardened" 
by now but we shouldn\'t take chances.

I can\'t see any other way for the Regency\'s Military to respond.  Even 
today we depend on very sophisticated computer controlled electronic 
devices to wage modern war.  This trend will probably continue until at 
TL 15 it would be hard to perform any sort of Military function above the 
skirmish level without extensive computer support.  The threat Virus 
poses to these processes should be obvious...

I don\'t imagine that these weapons are widely available but I wouldn\'t be 
surprised if they were being manufactured.  After all we still have 
Smallpox waiting around in govt. labs just in case...

BTW, Finding this secret Virus lab could be quite an adventure...

Really?

With some advance notice I don\'t think this would be a serious Military 
threat.

Basicly it looks like the only additional threats are either from the 
Wilds, the Sword Worlds (?), and internal disorder (Rebellion).  Okay, 
from this I\'ll look at building a new force structure.  If you like it 
add it to your sourcebook.

The difference is that a sole proprietor has day-to-day decision making
power over the business, as well as legal title to it, whereas a
corporation\'s senior management is vested with the day-to-day decision
making power.  The senior managers are employees appointed by the directors,
who are elected by the shareholders (but usually proposed to the
shareholders by management).  Thus there is quite a gap between ownership
and control in the corporation, which does not exist in the sole
proprietorship.

I hope this clarifies or obfuscates the argument.

at first a big thanks to Roger "StarWolf" Myhre for the Laser table. I\'m glad
someone did the work for me ;-). Roger, can you tell me if the Focal Arrays 
are designed to stand overpowered ROFs?

Ted Baltz issued the following comment on this tabel and Lasers in general:

You are right. This even gets better if you use higher TLs than 16. This is
especially true for Laser Lances, because I tend to use very small fighters
(less than 9 tons) and the main problem is Power there. So using Focal arrays
without gravitic focussing has the advantage of less power consumption. The
disadvantage of short ranges can be canceled by the small size of the fighter.
If you check, you will find that a fighter of less than 10 tons equiped with
EMM has +2 Diff Mod to get a target lock on, and +1 Diff mod to shoot on.

That is: To get a traget lock on such a fighter is a Formidable Task, even at
short range. And if the fighter has EMS Jammer fitted it even gets harder to
achieve a lock.

I must admit I use Thruster plates in my designs, so I don\'t have troubles with
fuel.

just a question to everyone, especially our TML-Admin James:

Is someone compiling the submitted weapon specs in one archive? Because of
disk quota I can\'t lock all the messages, and I\'m very interested to have

of a 5 ton Jumppod and some TL-15 Ship designs I submitted, but I can\'t find
the files anymore, so I would like to load them back up.

I presume "Early" "Average" and "High" technologies correspond to TL 13, 14

I\'m not. Just keeping up with TML and XTML is more than I can handle
right now.  For those of you awaiting list change and drop requests, my

Interesting. Maybe we can come up with some doctrine where this kind of

Hmmmm someone know the science it seems. Ok it maybe wasn\'t that great
idea after all. But there are a few things that may make it useful. And
that is expanding gasses from the explotion. Will the gasses have any
effect on the ship? And what about electromagnetic pulses. If they are
present, they may blind out the sensors, and much of the other
electronics in a ship, making it effectively blind for combat purposes.

This is my Mcr .000000002 worth.

The ETC guns continue to dominate up to about TL 12, even then they rival 
Mass Drivers due to the latters high power requirements.  However MDs at 
TL 12 can fire small bore penetrators at energies rivaling ETC guns of 
much larger bore.  This enables the vehicle to carry large numbers of 
these rounds (in some cases, four times the number of CPR rounds of the 
same energy) making ammo last considerably longer.  In the next 
supplement, I will detail Mass Drivers intended as primary armament on 
haevy AFV\'s starting at developmental TL 11 on up to TL 15.

In fact here is a quick index

I) MBT main guns  CPR
II) MBT main guns MD
III) MBT main guns Directed Energy
IV) Secondary Weapons 
	A)Secondary Guns (< 3MJ)
	B)Missile Systems
	C)Point Defenses

This of course may change quite a bit, oh well

a surface feature or armor is its ability to conduct heat away from
the place where the laser is hitting so the temperature doesn\'t get
too high.  This is not of particularly too much help when half the
hull is recieving energy at the same time.  

1MJ/cm^2 is a pretty high energy density.  Enough in fact, to melt 34
cm of iron.  Even assuming a really polished surface and better
properties than Iron, this is going to really screw up your average
antenna.  And a 10MT antimatter warhead is a lot cheaper I\'m sure than
some ship designed to clean off the antennas from an enemy ship.
Heck, fusion weapons that size aren\'t too hard or expensive to build.
Certainly a 10MT weapon is going to be unfriendly.  I doubt your
antenna can take the energy involved with vaporizing 3.4m of iron.  I
don\'t have TNE but I doubt that the antenna arrays weigh enough that
you can claim that they have enough mass/thickness to withstand that,
and it strikes me as unlikely that the entire hull of the ship is
thermally superconducting.

Exploding missiles also have the advantage that it\'s easier to hit
with them than with det lasers.  (Oh, look, the missile is within
100km, time to detonate!)

And if the antennae can withstand this sort of treatment, that brings
up all sorts of interesting things you can do with the technology :-)

                                       by

                                   Roger Myhre


This document has been an article in KU #4. Since then I have changed
the rules a bit, and modified the careers. This document will be
upgraded as new special careers pop up.

As the Traveller: The New Era (TNE) do not include Vargr character
generation I will present some rules here that I think will be of use.
Note that GDW may have other plans for Vargr character generating. As
the Vargr is quite close to humans (not counting looks, ancestry and
behaviour) their skill will be quite like. And I won\'t introduce any new
skills.


THE STATS

Vargr got the same stats as humans, with one exception. Vargr do not
have Social status, but their Charisma rating is the measure to find
where they stand in the Vargr society. A Vargr with high Charisma will
attract other Vargr for followers. So put a \'-\' in the Soc box on the
character sheet. The stats are rolled as following. STR 2D2-2, AGL 2D6,
CON 2D-2, INT 2D6- 1, EDU 2D-1, CHA 1D6.

If the total stats are less than 33, the player can add the difference
to the character stats, with these exceptions: CHAM-;cannot be increased
to more than 3. Any other stat cannot be increased beyond 11. The 33
limit is lower than the limit in the rulebook of 36. The reason for this
is that the Vargr is generaly weaker than an average human.

When calculating the weight of a Vargr use the same formula as for
humans, but the base weight is 70Kg. Making generally Vargr smaller than
Humans. The base weight is the same for males as for females. For hand
combat damage factor is the same as for humans, but add 1D6 damage each
time the Vargr elects to use his or hers claws. For using the claws the
skill is as for unarmed combat, Unarmed Melee skill which all Vargr
characters start with at level 0, Leadership is also a skill they start
with at 0.


SELECTING CAREERS

The Vargr can use all the careers in the book except for "Hiver
Technical Academy". There are some consideration to Vargr when they are
generated. Firstly their Charisma rating is a measurement of how
successful a given

Vargr is. The Charisma rating may go up and down during generation.For
CHA beyond A the cost is doubled. Thus it cost is 2 points from A to B.
But loss of one point in CHA brings you automatically from B to A. In
some careers there is possible to make a big enough mistake that you are
thrown out. This is true to all military careers. This does not however
stop the character generation, the character just has to enter a new
career, but not a military one, if he or she makes the continuity roll.
Even if you are thrown out from a career, you always finish the term
before you enter a new one.

CHA is increased/decreased like this:

   +1 If promotion is made.
   +1 if 12+ is rolled. Cumulative with above modifier. And promoted an
      additional rank.
   -1 if the promotion roll is missed by 4 or more
   -2 and demoted if the roll is natural 2 regardles of DM\'s. Not
cumulative with above modifier. Holds true for both special duty and
promotion rolls. If a natural 2 is rolled twice in a given military
career the character is thrown out at the end of the term.

If your character is from Society of Equals in Gvurrdon, he or she must
make a special roll to be rated equal. This is essential to enter the
following careers: Any military officer, Diplomat, Lawenforces or
Aristocrat.

   Difficult, Willpower

This task is rolled before the character generation is started. If the
roll is a catastrophic failure roll 1D6 and divide the result on the
STR, AGL and CON stat. Reduce the stats accordingly. This is damage
taken from the test.
Example: A player rolls 4 on the die, when he has failed. Thus the stats
has to be reduced with one each. For the remaining point the player may
choose which stat to reduce.


CAREERS:

**Oruelaen**
Psionic forces of Thirz Empire in Gvurrdon. Thirz empire has a special
force of psionic agents. They are not secret agents as portraied in
movies, but rather a information gathering group for the King in Thirz
Empire. Not much are actually known about them publicly, so a lot of
myths has been spun around them. All sophonts that are citizens of Thirz
Empire may apply. They will be tested for potentiality before they are
admitted. For ranks use Army table in the rulebook. All who are admitted
start with rank E5 Sergeant. Rank O10 General is not available for
playing characters when King Thir holds this position. As the force is
small and there is only possible to get promoted when a operative dies
or quits, the agents start at Enlisted rank, no matter what kind of
academies or careers they have attended before. Those who are admitted
get a Cha+1

PREREQUESITES: PSI strenght of 8+, and at least one of these abilities:
               telepathy, Teleperception or any useful arcana.
               Citizen of Thirz Empire.

FIRST TERM:

COMMISSION:    10+, +1 if CHA 6+

SKILLS:        Psionics-2, Determination-2, Gun Combat-1, Perception-1

SUBSEQUENT TERMS:

COMMISSION:    8+, +1 If CHA 6+. The character becomes an Officer.
               Rank O1.

SKILLS:

ELISTED:       Psionics, Determination, Unarmed Melee, Gun Combat,
               Perception

OFFICERS:      Psionics, Determination, Space vessel, Gun combat,
               Unarmed Melee, Perception

ALL TERMS:

SPECIAL DUTY:  Spacehand, Crime, Social Science, Vehicle, Tactics,
               Interaction.

               Thirz Empire.

OTHER EFFECTS: +1 per term as officer for scout/courier ship. Money is
               calculated from CHA stat not Intelligence. Use Advanced
               stellar as base when calculating money. Initiative is
               rolled 1D6


**Aristocrat**
As an aristocrat you know how the interstellar governments in the
extents is working. And if you are lucky and use your skills properly,
you might be able to carve out a place for your own.

PREREQUESITES: CHA 8+ or Population of 6 or more. Must not have been
               thrown out of a military career.
FIRST TERM:

SKILLS:        Charm-2, Interaction-3, Social Science-2, CHA+1

SUBSEQUENT TERMS:

SKILLS:        Charm, Interaction, Fine Arts, Determination, Economics,
               May trade in skill levels for CHA increase.

ALL TERMS:

SPC ADVENTURE: 7+. Spacevessel, Perception, Unarmed Martial Arts, Vice,
               Crime

CONTACTS:      Government, Military, Intelligence

OTHER EFFECTS: +1DM per term for yacht. Whenever the CHA stat is reduced

               below 8 the character may not continue this career. Note
               that CHA may not get above 15 or F.


**Fair Witness**
This career are only open to citizens of Thoengling Empire in Gvurrdon
Sector. A Fair Witness (FW) is a profession where a Vargr, or some other
sophont has gone through a training, giving total recall. FW is pledged
to report whatever it observed when on duty. Most FW is working free-
lance, but need a permit to do so. There is almost impossible to bribe a
FW to tell something else, that the FW did observe. The reason for this
is that the job itself gives quite good economical freedom, and
Charismatic standing among the Vargr. A FW will never offer an oppinion,
nor a theory when on duty. Or speak his or her meaning when recalling
something they observed while on duty. Thus if asked why a person acted
has he did, the FW cannot answer this, but only tell what the person
did. The FW will recall what he saw, heard, smelled, felt and so on. A
FW may be hired by anyone, but as they get better, their fee increase
accordingly. FW are often used when deals are been made, or when there
is need for a independent witness in a certain process.

When an obervation is going to be made, let the PC roll an imprint task,
using observation as asset. Base difficulty should be difficult,
adjusted depending on the situation. When the given situation is to be
recalled later, a new task is rolled. The difficulty on this task
depends on the success level on the prior task.

VARGR VERSUS OTHER SOPHONT INTERACTION

First time a non Vargr character is interacting with Vargr NPC\'s or
other Vargr characters, divide that characters CHA with 2, and drop
fractions. The result may not be below 1. Note however that this will
reduce all assets

EXCEPT language skills. For the character to increase his or hers CHA to
normal level follow the general CHA increase and decrease rules below.
The opposit is also true when a Vargr are going to interact with humans
for the first time. Note that both of these cases relates to Humans in a
Vargr dominated society, or Vargr in a Human dominated society.


CHARISMA INCREASES AND DECREASES

When a session is over there should be checked if the leader of the
group, the character with the highest CHA, will increase his charisma.
The difficulty level is up to the referee. But I will give a few
pointers.

Asset: Leadership.

  The session was an outstanding success    Average
  The group met its goals in the session    Difficult
  The group barely made the goals           Formidable
  The group made only a few of its goals    Impossible

If any of these tasks are a catastrophic failure the leader loose 1
point of Charisma. If the leader has CHA of A or more increase the
difficulty with one level.

The difficulty levels should be modified with how difficult the
adventure was. If the adventure was an total failure, the character must
roll a formidable task to prevent Charisma decrease. If that roll is a
catastrophic failure, the leader loose 2 points of Charisma.

The leader may also by commendate or reprimand the others in the group,
and thus increase or decrease the CHA of these characters. The leader
may only commendate a character if he himself got a CHA increase, but he
may reprimand a character whenever he wish. But reprimand a character
without reason will have counterproductive results, and the referee
should penalize this.

One good roleplaying tip is that the referee places the players in
clockwise fashion, with the highest CHA rated character to the left of
him. Whenever there is an important decission to be made, ask the leader
first. Ignore the others for a while. If the leader is hesitating, this
can mean a loss in

Charisma specialy if other players start to come with solutions. This is
to simulate that the other Vargr always look to their leader. If the
leader fails the others may take command. The referee should be a bit
careful with this approach though. The player may not be good at
roleplaying in this fashion, so the referee should give him more time
than a player that got good abilities at this type of roleplaying.

Whenever 2 players got equal or a difference of one level in Charisma a
Charismatic struggle erupts. The leader must then roll a difficult
leadership roll to stay in position. If the roll fails, the two players
change position. If a catastrophic failure is rolled, the leader loose 2
CHA points.

The referee may also increase or decrease the CHA of characters during
play, to give them a feel of how successful they are. However this
should be used sparingly. If a player shows some initiative, and do
something daring and succeeds he should be awarded. In doubt let him
roll a difficult task. Equally he should loose Charisma if he does
something and fails, especially if he endangers the mission and the
adventure group.

Other uses of Charisma is that a high Charisma Vargr will always reduce
the Initiative  to the opposition by one to a minimum of one, if they
are of lower Charisma. If the Charisma to the leaders of the two groups
are equal, let the player roll a difficult leadership to gain the upper
hand. If this fails the opponent get the upper hand. When calculating
loss of initiative to combat damage use the original initiative.

Remember these rules is only valid in a Vargr society. A human will have
a hard time to prove herself, but when she gets the wheels turning,
there might not be anything stopping her. Note that If the non Vargr
character increases her Charisma above her original level it is returned
to normal when interacting with other non vargr characters or NPCs.


BRIBING VARGR

This may sound easy, but many has fallen into the trap, believing the
Vargr nature is working for them. What they do forget is that do not
oppose to the Charisma of the clerk in front of them, but the Charisma
of his superior officer or leader.

An example is maybe in order. Lets say an Vargr journalist is working on
a special report, and need graded information from the police. Offering
money for bribery is pointless. As for most human societies social
status is measured by the wealth you got. This is not the case with
Vargr. To a Vargr you have to offer increase in Charisma. Money is
something that comes along. Money is not as important for a Vargr as for
most human cultures. Money is a tool nothing more nothing less. However
money should be offered in the bribe, but the amount never is large. Its
just a small contribute for the service rendered. So the journalist must
actually make up a case were he can prove that the police officer will
increase in Charisma if the journalist is successfull in his
investigation. Remember that Vargr are pack animals opposed to humans
which are more invidiualistic. A Vargr will always view a certain action
in the light of what the group will gain by that given action. Each
individual Vargr always try to improve their status within a group. This
sound contradictory, but viewed from the human point it is, but for the
Vargr it makes sense. If the indiviual Vargr feels that he or she will
gain Charisma to belong to that group it will be loyal to it, and do
whatever is in her power to increase the group Charisma. Going back to
this journalist, he must convince the police officer that the whole
department will gain by giving the information he needs. In most cases a
person trying to bribe a Vargr only have to go up against the closest
leader to the Vargr trying to be bribed.

The difficulty is such a bribery attempt is rarely easier than
Difficult. If the group leader of the opposition are of lower Charisma
it might be easier. The difficulty level should also be adjusted to how
the bribing player is arguing, and how he or she present the deal.

There is also possible to buy information on the street by Vargr. In
these cases money have more to say, when this kind of information is
bought from Vargr that never are attached to a group over long period of
time, and thus do not have the neccessary group loyalty, except for its
own day to day survival.

Firstly, I don\'t see why a missile impact is impossible ... s**t happens.

Secondly, why do you need to \'detonate\' an antimatter missile at range?

If I were to design an anti-matter missile I would set it up to approach
hostile ships with the intention of impacting to do the most possible
damage.  I would also design it so that if the missile is hit by a
sufficiently powerful anti-missile then it\'s war head goes off.

This combination gives you the best of both scenarios:

   - If they don\'t shoot down the missile then it WILL impact and do a
     LOT of damage.

   - When they do shoot down the missile they MUST do it sufficiently
     far from their ship so that the detonating missile doesn\'t do too
     much damage to them.

Non-anti-matter missiles are not so useful because you can\'t guarantee
they will detonate after being shot down but an anti-matter containment
field WILL fail and the reaction MUST happen because you encased the
sucker in normal matter AND whatever they are using to shoot it down is
probably composed of normal matter too.

Anti-matter missiles are expensive SO intersperse them among your 
normal Non-anti-matter missiles.  What a nice surprise for the intended
victim 8^}.

Great.  I was just a bit worried.  It\'s difficult to tell sometimes.

First off, I thought we had given up on the technology issue?  :-)

Actually, I find this incredulous myself.  I merely stated that since there
were changes to the UWP data over this fifteen year period *and* the
population and other figures were not changed that it must be *assumed*
to have been done intentionally.  (My own opinion is that GDW was merely
careless once again.)

> No world increased it\'s population by as much as 10%? No
> world lost as much as 10% in a raid? They all remained at _exactly_ the
> same population? Every single one of them?

Unlikely, I admit.  I did a little arithmetic though and found some
interesting numbers.  A population increase of 10% over a period of 15
years works out to an annual rate of increase of 0.64%.  Here are some
`real\' annual rates from a handy 1990 almanac (these are net figures,
accounting for births, deaths and migrations):

US         0.7%
Denmark    0.0%
Japan      0.5%
Spain      0.5%
UK         0.2%
France     0.4%
USSR       1.0%
Greece     0.1%
Italy      0.0%
Germany   -0.1% (a decrease!)
India      2.2%

It\'s clear for `developed\' countries that something less than a 10% increase
over a period of fifteen years is not unreasonable.  Keep in mind as well that
due to rounding conventions, a 10% increase (or decrease) will not show up
even in the PBG population multipler (the mantissa) for values under 5 and
that *only* a 10% *increase* will affect the actual UWP population code *if*
the population multipler is 9.

It\'s my impression that most worlds in the Spinward Marches are going to be
more equivalent in terms of population growth to contemporary `developed\'
nations than to `developing\' nations (just my opinion).  Furthermore, while
one might expect high birth rates and low death rates (due to available high
tech medical care) on `developing\' worlds one would also expect high rates of
*emigration* (to high population worlds) to keep the net growth rate low.

In fact, it is internal migration that ought to have the greatest effect
on population for worlds within the Domain/Regency.

Now, I accept that it is quite incredulous not to see any change in *any*
world population over a span of fifteen years (and I suspect if we looked
hard enough we might even find a couple of changes due to errors in 
transcription) but I submit the above information in an effort to suggest
that such an occurrence is not *impossible*.  (Maybe only as unlikely as
the occurrence of `techno-economic cycles\'.  :-)

Nevertheless, I believe we were discussing tech levels not population levels
and the fact that no tech levels changed still does not suggest that *any*
of them went *down* so the lack of any evidence for the `techno-economic
cycles\' remains.  (Remember, I\'ve already admitted the *possibility* that
they *could* exist.  I can just explain Gram\'s domination of the Sword
Worlds through the less incredulous agency of Zhodani aid.)

It\'s *possible*, just not very damn likely.

Just what is Solomani culture anyway?  The Solomani took over a Vilani
empire.  I would expect them to adopt *many* Vilani traits just as the
Hellenes under Alexander adopted Persian traits and the Germanic tribes
that conquered Rome adopted Roman ones.  I suspect this `Solomani\'
cultural heritage might just be more Imperial propaganda.  As for the
Sword Worlds, they haven\'t had any direct contact with the Solomani in
700 years.  They have about as much in common with the Solomani as
Americans have with Byzantines!  (Just look at the differences in attitudes
about religion as an indicator of the cultural gulf here.)

We sure seem to travel across a wide spectrum of ideas!  :-)

Well, first off, it\'s my sense that as the size of the economy *increases*
it becomes *more* difficult for economic down turns to affect technological
capabilities (since there is more of a buffer to absorb down turns in
particular sectors).  I\'ve admitted this is possible though.  So, please
give me some sense of your sense of the relative likeliness of these
`techo-economic cycles\' occurring as compared to the likelihood of there
being no population change in the Marches over fifteen years.  Twice as
likely?  Five times?  Ten times?  A hundred times?  It\'s my sense that 
these two occurrences are about *equally* likely. :^)

> How severe? That\'s the whole point, isn\'t it? A planet with billions of

Again, see above.  As the size of the economy grows it becomes *more*
difficult for economic factors to affect overall technological capabilities.
(We\'re not talking individual factors as used in *WBH* now.  Those already
can fluctuate up and down.)

Even if you could this is not a matter of technological fluctuation that
is tied to economic factors.  If the country is unable to continue to
operate the factory then it never *had* that level of capability.  The
company that pulled out maintains its own tech level at its other facilities.
This situation might occur on some worlds but it is not relevant to our
discussion of indigineous Sword Worlds capabilities.  (If anything, it
supports my claim for Zhodani support of Gram!)

Open question: Has anyone played with Ship designs in TNE for Tech Level 9?

This one\'s a curious &*%&$! in that the minimum power plant size is
huge and the contra-grav systems are just beginning to be used. I found
it\'s not really very feasible to make ships that both land on planets 
and travel the system. I was going to design some ships in that TL, 
but wanted to check to see what other\'s had done.

	Well, I\'ve played a bit, and I agree, you need giant power plants 
and such.  BUT...hey, that\'s the limitation of TL 9!  It\'s really hard to 
build spaceships at that TL.  That\'s exacly why TL 9 cultures use 
shuttles.  IMO the old system was more unreal, in that, for instance, 
scout ships could be built at any tech level 9 on up.  At lower tech levels, 
I doubt anything so small would be built, especially in the TNE univers, 
where any TL 9 culture building spaceships or starships are 
bootstrapping themselves back to space.  Those are going to be large 
efforts, on the scale of the Apollo missions; only larrge nations are going 
to play at that level.

Welcome back, everyone!

Any ideals about how to design bikes for TL6 to TL 9?  I\'ve havent
attempted to yet; however, I have heard that any attempt to do so using
FF&S rules lead up to massive engines, weighing in at 500 kg.

Also, does anyone out there have a rule set for hydroponics?  (The Archives
at ftp.engrg.uwo.ca are not accessible)  Hopefully, they would be
relatable to Tech Levels, amount of food production per kilogram, etc.
Fortunately, Rations are taken care of in the TNE manual - they have the
weights I need there.

Finally: It would seem to me that all dedicated naval vessels would have
fusion drives, as they are MUCH faster than HEPlaR is. (Unless I\'m reading
the manual wrong)  The only exceptions would be near-orbit vessels and
troop transports.  There would also be the restriction of price, as fusion
drives are rather more expensive then HEPlaR is.

How much fuel capacity should a ship have? Enough for one jump, 10?

How is the number of crewstations and workstations required calulated????

Are the cost, size and power of navigational aids the same nomatter what size

Can a ship have a computer of a tech level higher than its control system?

Is it possible to have retractable turrets (so a ship can be equipped with a
turret and still remain streamlined)?

How are costs for fuel scoops calculated? You work out how many you want as a
percentage of the total surface area, but the costs are given per cubic metre.
Does one cubic metre of fuel scoop cover 1 square metre of surface area or 10,
does tech level affect this?

Thanks for any help you can provide a travller newbie (who tried to design a

Hello to all.  The two messages below were sent to the old TML while it was in

I\'ve posted the full text of the second and third message for completeness. 
The original message pointed out the TL-10 ACR design example on page 154 of
FFS violated GDW\'s rules on slug weapon design on FFS p. 92.

There are also several arithmetic errors in the example, and at least one
apparent violation of the design rules.  It\'s a bad example.

Not only does their example design not follow their own rules, I can locate
several real-world cartridges [*] which violate this "rule".  The official word
from GDW is that these cartridges aren\'t really necked, they just look that
way.

The cartridge dimensions in FF&S are just "random numbers" anyway, you won\'t
get anything approaching real world muzzle energies if you use a real
world cartridge combined with a real world barrel length.  Get a copy of
your favorite ballistics data, and plug in some values.  They can be pretty
far off.

GDW recommends varying the TL of the round until you get approximately the
right energy.  My suggestion is to chuck the whole idea of attempting to
match real world cartridge dimensions, and select a design that supplies the
right muzzle energy when combined with the appropriate length barrel.

> The TL 10 7mm (ETC) Design Example in Appendix III, page154 states that  the

Consider the rule a general suggestion, and then proceed to ignore it.  As I
mentioned earlier, there are other problems with the design example in
Appendix III.  The whole thing should be re-worked from the beginning to
follow the rules as presented in FF&S.

[*] These include the following rounds: the 5.56x29mm (Colt ".22 SCAMP"
    7.62x25mm (.30 Mauser), 8.00x21mm (8mm Nambu), and 7.92x33mm (Sturmgewehr
    44).  All of these are real-world rounds (and all but the Colt SCAMP
    relatively important, too).  The rule seems to be an overbroad
    generalization.  Necked cartridges are used whenever the required
    propellant volume is larger than a stright cartridge would allow, and
    the designer doesn\'t want to lengthen the cartridge.  Maybe this
    should read "... and the cartridge case is usually longer than 35mm."

Seems likely to me too.  We had a discussion about the efficiency of
the BL/FF&S drives earlier this summer which came to similar conclusions,
and also noted that the Daedalus drives are worthless.  However, there
is the possibility that fusion drive signatures are too high for use in
combat -- this isn\'t addressed anywhere, but many of the "side-tech"
issues aren\'t really well addressed in the rules yet.  Personally, I\'ve
been using HEPlaR for consistency in my own designs (like my 12G TL16
heavy fighter design, which I currently plan to post once people have
had a chance to resubscribe).

>Is the surface area of a hull calulated including the hull plating thickness
>or excluding it?

Hull plating goes *inside* the hull.  Since all the hull figures are
initially based on a sphere, they\'re very easy to find using high-school
geometry -- the values in BL/FF&S have been rounded slightly.  I\'ve done
some figures to experiment with non-standard hull sizes.  Once you have
the volume:

  length == 2 * (cube root (volume * (3/(4 * pi))))
  surface area == volume * (6/length)
  material volume == 4/3 * pi * ((length/2)^3 - ((length/2) - 0.01)^3)
   (The volume of a sphere of a diameter equal to the hull\'s length minus
    the volume of a sphere 1cm smaller in radius.)

If my math is off, someone please let me know.  All units are the same as
those on the BL/FF&S tables.  Read the whole section very carefully -- I
hate how GDW changes units from cubic meters to displacement-tons all over
the place.

>How much fuel capacity should a ship have? Enough for one jump, 10?

At least one -- you\'ll find yourself using a lot for G-turns.  For
combat ships, 50+ G-turns are highly recommended to avoid "limited 
maneuver fuel" status in _Battle Rider_.

>How is the number of crewstations and workstations required calulated????

See the section on building your ship\'s bridge.  Most other components,
like standard turrets, already have what they need built in.

>Are the cost, size and power of navigational aids the same nomatter what size
>ship they are fitted to . . . . [deleted]

Yes.  Obviously, on a big ship this is incidental.

>Can a ship have a computer of a tech level higher than its control system?

No.  FF&S, p. 48.  This doesn\'t stop you from using a lower tech computer
if you really want the lower tech control system, even if better are 
available.

>Is it possible to have retractable turrets (so a ship can be equipped with a
>turret and still remain streamlined)?

I believe, for starships, this is automatically assumed.

>How are costs for fuel scoops calculated?

It\'s a flat rate on total ship tonnage, carried over probably from as far
back as "Classic" Traveller\'s High Guard.  I believe that you can just
specify how much hull surface area you want them to eat up.  Either way,
it hardly matters at Cr 75 a cubic meter -- they are cheap.

     I\'ve been trying to prepare a Spinward Marches campaign, and
it occurred to me that a useful thing I could do was to make a
bunch of short "planetary data files" that would let me quickly
generate adventures before PCs made planetfall; with enough of
these floating around, I could let the PCs wander around the
universe with little need to "pull" them in the direction of my
only prepared adventure ("Sorry, guys...I don\'t know what\'s in
that system.  Why don\'t you accept this unattractive job offer
instead?")

     The idea was to create a short, one-page summary describing
enough information to ref the planet, and then think up a variety
of "adventure hooks" to use depending on the situation.  Some
would be "real" adventures, and others would just be "incidents"
or casual encounters so that NPCs and patrons could be introduced
in a fairly unique way, or to give the players some experience
and keep them on their toes.

     What follows is an example of a "planetary data file" of
this sort.  Comments will be appreciated.  I would like to thank
Bryan Borich for his feedback; his suggestions were immeasurably
helpful, and I have incorporated some herein.

Bill White (whitew@eden.rutgers.edu)

     


PLANETARY DATA FILE

Emerald/Spinward Marches (1006) Library Data
B766555-B S Ag Ni  534 Im M1 VI

-62 degrees Celsius mean base temperature at mid-latitudes;
Mass .71 terra; .93 std g; orbit 1; outside habitable zone;
132 std day/local yr; 34 std hr/local day; 93.18 loc day/loc yr.

     Emerald gains its name from the greenish hues of the glacial
seas that make up more than 50% of the world\'s surface.  Much of
the rest of the planet\'s surface is frozen, save for isolated
"hot spots" where geyser-like mineral springs emanate from the
planet\'s interior.  These slushy areas are marginally habitable,
rising slightly above the melting point of water ice.  Commonly
referred to as "sleetmarshes", these serve as the centers of
human habitation on-planet and require extensive terraforming and
terraform maintenance to maintain their viability.

     The inhabitants of Emerald, or "Emeraldas" (as they refer to
themselves), are a hardy and energetic lot, and their social
organization is geared towards making their less-than-paradisian
planet a productive one.

     The Emerald Planetary Management Committee is comprised of
experts in the areas of terraforming, engineering, weather
control, power systems, and agriculture.  The committee includes
all those who meet certain qualification standards; every ten
years, computer-selected resumes are presented to the council for
review.  It takes a two-thirds majority vote to deny a selectee
his or her seat on the committee.  Once seated, a committee
member serves until death or retirement.  The committee is
responsible for the development and maintenance of the planetary
infrastructure.
     Regional and local "executaries" and their subordinate
technicians or "operatives" are hired by their immediate
superiors, though resumes are again initially selected by
computer.  These agents are responsible for maintaining the
complex infrastructure that supports human habitation, including
geothermal power stations, irrigation systems, weather control
stations, heating arrays, and communication and navigation
satellites.  
     Executaries have extensive authority in the districts where
they preside, though their performance must be reviewed and
contracts renewed every five years.  They may hire and fire
subordinate executaries and operatives.  They may assess and
collect taxes within their district.  Within their purview, they
may administer justice for certain categories of crimes and
misdemeanors; however, serious crimes are generally remanded to
Imperial authority.
     Special executaries in charge of new construction and other
critical projects can be appointed at the regional level, by the
District Executary, or at the planetary level, by the PMC.

     Most Emeraldas are small landholders, farmers on the
sleetmarshes.  A recent initiative by the PMC intends to
collectivize these smaller farms into large cooperatives in the
name of efficiency.  There is, naturally enough, resistance to
this plan, and a fierce debate is ongoing within the committee as
to its wisdom.

ADVENTURE HOOKS:

1) A group of farmers from one district want to free themselves
from the PMC\'s hegemony.  The PCs have been hired:

     a) by the farmers to lead an assault on the local power
     station.
     b) by the local executary to infiltrate the farmers\' group.
     c) by the farmers to kidnap an executary or PMC member.
     d) by a sympathetic executary to investigate the farmers\'
     grievances.

2) A speeder carrying 

     a) an important PMC member, or 
     b) the daughter of a well-to-do farmer,

is missing and presumed to be down on the ice.  Its emergency
beacon is not functioning, and its last reported location was a
few hundred kilometers from the starport.  The Scout Service\'s
rescue team is currently unavailable.  The locals are calling
upon everyone available to assist in the search, particularly
those with access to sensitive starship sensors.  If the PCs
join, they:

     a)  find the downed speeder and return its passengers
     safely, earning the gratitude of a potential patron, if they
     succeed at their Impossible Sensor task rolls.
     b)  are attacked by the same monstrous life form that downed
     the speeder, an escaped specimen from an expedition to
     spinward being studied at the Scout Station.
     c)  are captured by the same rebel farmers who shot down the
     speeder.  They must escape and, if possible, rescue the
     captive.
     d)  don\'t have a snowball\'s chance of finding anything. 
     However, severe weather forces them down and damages their
     vehicle; they must survive the brutal cold and make their
     way across several hundred kilometers of rugged frozen
     ground back to the starport.
     e)  search but return empty-handed, or find the downed
     speeder with its passengers frozen to death.

3)  A power station serving an experimental domed homestead out
on the frozen ground called "tiger plains" breaks down and its
backups fail.  Several hundred people are in danger of freezing
to death very quickly.  The PCs are hired to assist in the
evacuation.  They:

     a)  quickly and efficiently make several trips, earning
     their pay and the gratitude of the refugees.
     b)  are first on the scene and must find a way in; all door
     mechanisms are frozen shut.
     c)  must deal with the difficulties and dangers of cold
     weather operations, including injury and equipment failure.
     d)  face a panic-stricken mob of homesteaders, who threaten
     to overload the PCs\' vehicle.
     e)  are attacked by the saboteurs of the power station.

Again, all comments, advice, and suggestions would be appreciated.

This is the welcome message to a new newsgroup dedicated to 2300AD.  If you
wish to read this group check your local usenet listings.  If it is not present

Welcome to alt.games.frp.2300ad
----

    This is the introductionary post to alt.games.frp.2300ad, a newsgroup
dedicated to the discussion of matters concerning the 2300AD role playing
games.

    2300AD is set in the future in a time when space colonization is well
under way.  While most colonies are politically controlled by one of the 
100 Earth nations, some have became independent states.  Some intelligence 
alien species are known and contact with them is in general peaceful and 
rewarding to both parties.  There is however one exception.  In 2298 a new
race was discovered.  The newcomers turned out to be hostil and shortly
after invaded one of the frontier colonies.  In the year 2300 little is know 
about this new race.  Some believe it is a small problem the can be dealt 
with locally.  Others fear that this may be the biggest threat humanity has
ever dealt with.

    2300AD is in the opinion of many players one of the games with a richer
hard science-fiction setting.  Games can focus on subjects as varied as the 
political intrigues among Earth nations, the exploration of new star systems,
the fighting against the new alien race (known as the Kafers), troubleshooting
in a frontier colony or in one of the highly developed core colonies.

    I hope this group will give players and Game Masters a place to discuss all
matters related to 2300AD and similar games.  For further information you can 
contact me, Pedro Tavares, at <ftavares@skull.cc.fc.ul.pt>.  There is also a 
ftp site for stuff about the game in <ftp.fc.ul.pt>.  At the moment it is 
empty because of disk space problems.  I will try to correct that as soon as
possible.  If you would like to upload files to this site please let me know.
I have at the moment equipment lists and a reference database with varied 
information on the world of 2300AD.  As I said above I\'ll upload them as soon
as posible.

Regards,
Pedro Tavares <ftavares@skull.cc.fc.ul.pt>

I think this was the intent of many of the Amber Zones from the Journals. 
I have used the AmberZones and Contact! sections from the Journals quite often
in my campaigns just for this purpose.  The biggest problem is indexing all
the existing material.  Also, I like makeing sure that I stay within the
mainline of the game.  Thus, while you have a great description of Jewell,
there may be somewhere an official description of Jewell that is different.

I think its a great idea, and you have a good grasp of what goes in there.
In fact, in the TNE supplement Path of Tears, they basically do what you are
doing. 

Good luck!

Can anyone help me out here?

Characters in TNE can have a skill in archery but there are no
stats for bows in terms of range, damage, penetration etc. or have
I missed something.  Has anyone come up with appropriate values for
arrows and crossbow bolts?  I have had NPC\'s use crossbows but was
stumped as to reasonable damage and penetration values, now one of
my players wants to use a crossbow.  Also would crossbows be
effective in zero gravity?

My roleplaying group has been playing TNE for abut 8 weeks after
many years of fantasy and they hate the TNE universe.  It is too
depressing and the players don\'t have enough access to futuristic
stuff they complain.  I started them in a Pocket Empire in the
middle of the wilds as I didn\'t like the standard RCES or old
Imperium settings and thought a Pocket Empire woud give more
control over the universe.  The suggestion is that the party is
time warped into the future 200-300 years.  This would then allow
for more interesting planet cultures than just after the virus,
vampire ships and virus affected equipment would be less common and
the Pocket Empires would be in an expansion phase rather than just
a survival phase.  The Wilds will still exist.  Has anyone else
done this?

What are peoples opinions on the damage system?  We changed to the
On Target system (from an old White Dwarf?) which multiplies damage
based on the hit location which works well with the current combat
system.

Thanks for your interest.

>Is the surface area of a hull calulated including the hull plating thickness
>or excluding it?

 Hull Armor thickness takes up volume on the "inside" of a ship\'s basic
volume (a Scout\'s armor takes up some part of the 100 displacement tons,
for instance), so there is no difference.  If I read your question correctly...


>How much fuel capacity should a ship have? Enough for one jump, 10?

 Civilian ships generally have enough for one jump of their drive\'s maximum
range.  Military ships are a matter of design concept, but often get a
second jump by using drop tanks.  You may certainly install as much fuel
capacity as you think the design requires.  There is nothing to prevent you,
for example, from installing Jump-4 drives with only one parsec worth of
jump fuel.  This is one extreme of design efficiency, however.  This will,
if carried far enough, save a fair amount of volume in your design.  Such
a design will cost like %%#$@#$, however, as Jump Drives are one of the
more expensive items in a ship.
 The other side of the fuel problem is reaction mass for the HEPlaR drive.
This eats up volume at voracious rates.  In PC ships, it almost always
comes down to what you want more: cargo or manuevering time.  This is a
design philosophy question that only you can answer for your specific
campaign.


>How is the number of crewstations and workstations required calulated????

 Non-Bridge ("other") Workstations are easy if your design has a Bridge.
The number of non-Bridge workstations required is equal to the number of
Engineering crew required. Nothing else... Unless you get complicated and
install custom-built weaponry or shields that need workstations.
 Bridge Workstations required are equal to the total of Manuever, Command,
Electronics, and MFD crew numbers.
 This is all spelled out in the second paragraph ("If a ship requires a
bridge...") on page 14 of FF&S.


>Are the cost, size and power of navigational aids the same nomatter what size
>ship they are fitted to or are the figures given per displacement ton?

 None of these (FF&S page 48) make any mention of being "per cubic meter of
craft", so they are all absolute values.


>Can a ship have a computer of a tech level higher than its control system?

 FF&S, page 48, second column, "Important Note" just above the Computers
Table: A computer may not be installed which is from a _different_ tech
level than the craft\'s control system." (emphasis mine).  Not higher.
Not lower.


>Is it possible to have retractable turrets (so a ship can be equipped with a
>turret and still remain streamlined)?

 Where did the idea that turrets interfere with ship streamlining come from?
This is only the case for aircraft, and is called "drag".  Traveller has
never imposed streamlining penalties on armed starships or spacecraft.
Also, in TNE all turrets are already considered "retractable".  See the
picture in the TNE rulebook of the Laser Turret (p 349).
 There IS one major difference between TNE and previous editions, however.
Previous editions assumed that turrets were ALWAYS streamlined, even when in
operation.  This is not so in TNE, though this is not really mentioned that
I can recall.  The feasability of cranking an umbrella-shaped laser-emitter
out on a skinny aiming boom while doing Mach 6 in an atmosphere boggles the
mind.  Previous editions didn\'t have this problem.

>percentage of the total surface area, but the costs are given per cubic metre.
>Does one cubic metre of fuel scoop cover 1 square metre of surface area or 10,

 Honestly, this one bugs me too.  The cost of fuel scoops is based on the
volume of the _whole_ craft, not of the scoops themselves.  How this changes
with percent coverage is what gets me...

 ACK! Start with an X-Wing, instead.  Or the Millenium Falcon.  These are
fairly simple design concepts that won\'t get in the way of your rules
delving.  The Death Star, on the other hand, will require a trip to the
Meson Gun design sequence, and will have mind-boggling crew numbers.

The following was posted to engrg.uwo.ca in the last days of the tml there 
and did not appear to be broadcast:

 The idea that ship classifications should follow the function of the design 
is a useful one that could help explain such anomalies as the various 
"cruisers" presented in Brilliant Lances & TNE.

 Ship classifications follow the requirements of a developing interstellar 
society.

Stage 1. Exploration & Colonisation
 New worlds are discovered colonies are established.

 This requires 2 basic types.

Survey ships
 - also called scouts, these ships carry survey sensors and discover new 
worlds for exploitation.

Transports
 - to transport colonists to the new worlds and resources back to the home 
world.

Stage 2. Settlement & Expansion
 As more and more worlds are colonised some of the older and more developed 
colonies get more self sufficient and hanker after independence.
 The expanding frontier causes the reaction times of the home worlds forces 
to become slower.
 The increasing merchant activity encourages some to turn to piracy.

 The appearance of warships characterises this stage.

Cruisers
 - all purpose warships capable of extended patrolling. The size and 
capability of cruisers increases as the opposition changes from the odd 
armed merchant to the missile boats of rebellious worlds. The logistic 
problems of re-supply mean that DE weapons are preferred to missiles.

Merchants
 - privately owned transports not under the control of the home world.

Missile Boats
 - cheap craft with a powerful punch but limited endurance. Missiles are 
emphasised as they allow targets such as cruisers to be attacked at less 
risk for the boat. The ship of choice for a developing colony with 
pretensions of independence.

Stage 3. Independence & War
 As former colonies become independent they begin to behave like the 
original home world, eventually leading to conflicting interests and perhaps 
war.
 Alternatively an expanding frontier may contact aliens who are less than 
friendly!

 Warships become more developed.

Battleships
 - by increasing the offensive and defensive capabilities of cruisers at the 
expense of endurance the ultimate in space combat ships are produced. They 
are however so expensive that their loss must be carefully guarded against.

Destroyers
 - first called "missile boat destroyers" these ships are similar to missile 
boats but have fleet performance. Their role is to protect the fleet from 
missile boat attacks and as sensor pickets.

Frigates
 - the increasing size and cost of cruisers mitigates against their use in 
"police actions" so small cruisers are built to fill this role. These ships 
are generally called frigates.

Corvettes
 - small destroyers not capable of fleet performance. Often used for convoy 
escort and anti-piracy.

Couriers
 - the development of better jump drives allows faster communications. 
Couriers are small ships used to carry messages at the fastest available 
jump speed.

The following was posted to engrg.uwo.ca in the last days of the tml there 
and did not appear to be broadcast:

There are a lot of problems with the FF&S design rules. Here are a few 
suggestions to help overcome some of the problems I found.

Lasers: It seems silly to me that a laser can be constructed at ANY pulse 
energy for a given area of focal array as a sufficiently high energy will 
damage the reflective/refractive parts of the focal array no matter how much 
extra mass is added !
The following formula accounts for increasing efficiency at high TL while 
limiting lasers to a penetration of nil on their own focal arrays:

MAX pulse energy=Non grav eff (%) x Area of focal array (cm^2) x 0.39

e.g. a TL 9 laser with 10 m^2 focal array has an absolute max pulse energy 
of:

0.3 x 100000 x .39 = 11700 MJ

High Energy weapons: Arrgh where do I start! Their disadvantages include:
 -high price
 -short range
 -low penetration
 -heavy
 -high recoil
 -heavy ammo
 -requires high tech maintainance
in short, only a complete moron would use them as they are.

Some mods to make them more viable:
IPR is now calculated from pulse MJ

IPR=MJ^-3  ( /2 at long, /10 at extreme )

Range is calculated using a formula derived from that I worked out for Mass 
Drivers.

Short range (m) = 1/k x ln ( vkt + 1 )
v= 8000 for plasma, 12000 for fusion
t=0.3
k=4 x (10^-3) x MJ^-(2/3)
For small arms use the shorter of either the above or that of an equivalent 
small arms laser.

Fusion guns derive extra energy from the fusion reaction.
Multiply the MJ rating of the fusion gun ammo by 2.25 for the purposes of 
damage, IPR and range.

Ammo is very heavy which means that small arms can only carry a few shots, 
also note that the amount of propellent required to fire a ETC gun with a 
muzzle velocity of say 12 MJ is about a quarter of the mass of a 12 MJ PPC 
Cartridge!
Ammo now has a mass and volume = 0.2 x EPG equivalent mass and volume.

Example ratings:

0.75 MJ Plasma Gun
Dam=10 PR=1,2,11 Pen=10,10,5,1 Range=514m

2 MJ Plasma Gun
Dam=16 PR=1,2,8 Pen=16,16,8,2 Range=763m

12 MJ Plasma Gun
Dam=39 PR=1/2,1,4 Pen=78,78,39,10 Range=1349m

125 MJ Fusion Gun (x2.25=281.25 MJ)
Dam=192 PR=1/7,1/3,2 Pen=1344,1344,576,96 Range=3093m

Note that the above values are closer to the 2300AD concept of a H.E. 
Weapon.

I hope the above will be of some use to people struggling to reconcile the 
traditional concept of H.E. weapons with the complete duds presented in TNE.

 Good news :). I missed the World Builder\'s Guide when it first

 Keep in mind this is all IMHO :). Too depressing? Hell yes, that\'s
why I like it so much :). One of the big reasons I like Deep Space Nine
over the Star Trek:The Next Generation...it\'s not so artificially happy.
People are just not as advanced as all the futurists like to argue. We\'ll
always have petty disagreements, petty squabbles, and petty wars. We\'re
petty in general. I LOVE the New Era, since it\'s simply a result of all of
the human species\' faults coming together at once. Virus, the creation of
Humanity now threatening it. The Reformation Coalition, hardly a coalition
at all, forced to use brutal means to achieve what they view as a noble
end. It\'s the way the future WILL be, not how it ought to be. There is all
the good with all the bad, the way things were meant to be :).
 As for complaints about futuristic equipment? I\'m sorry, but if
they complain because they can\'t get their hands on a Fusion Gun, well,
tough apples. They sound jaded to me. My gaming group had a BLAST when I
dumped then on the rain soaked world of Eriris, with little more than the
clothes on their backs. Forced to deal with a military run city, they came
through with flying colours and smiles, all without the high tech gadgets
everyone seems to crave. Why? They had to deal with high tech problems via
low tech means, and it allowed them to show their creativity :). They got
right back on their run down Labship, the Archimedes, and ended up at at a
TL-15 starport the next adventure, but they had fun without needing high
tech goodies. Your players shouldn\'t complain, really. Even in a High
Science Fiction Campaign, it sometimes pays to strip \'em bare and have
them face the Rancor without a Lightsaber ;).

 If you want high tech worlds bordering on the wilds, just holding
it off, and want to use \'official\' material, use the Domain of Deneb.
However, you could always do what I did and \'create\' a history for your
particular sector of space, dating from the Rebellion to the New Era. It
allows you to use \'official\' material, without locking you into following
it by the letter.

 Always the number one priority :).

I asked GDW about the same, their answer was no. Hull thicknes do not

A simpler way to calculate it is to multiply the drive volume with 5.
Then you get fuel volume needed for one jump out to the maximum jump
range. Divide fuel volume by jump numbeer to get fuel volume needed for
jump one.

>How is the number of crewstations and workstations required calulated??
Following crew should have bridge workstations:
        Command
        MFD
        Maneuver
        Electronics

Engineers should have only normal workstations.

The size of the ship do not matter.

No

If you look in the TNE rulebook at the equipment chapter, you will see
that the turret is automatically retractable.

I must confess that I use the design rules in BL at some areas, when I
find the instructions there more understandable. Use the rule there.

I hope this helps some :)

Anyway I decided last night to try and design something a little simpler, a
gauss snipers rifle, and came across something that I\'m sure is an error.

When calculating the barrel length, FF&S(pg102) gives a formula Lb=V/100TLm.
The text above this formula states that higher muzzle velocities require
longer barrels, but higher tech levels allow higher acceleration within the
barrel and thus shorter barrels. However when I calculated the barrel
length for a 4000m/s muzzle velocity i relized the shortest barrel length
is achived at TL 10 (25 cm) and the LONGEST barrel length is at TL 16+
(100cm).

Assuming someone can help me with this problem I\'ll post a design for a
gauss snipers rifle tommorrow, and should be able to finish a spreadsheet
for gauss weapon design.

This problem tends to clear up with larger ships which have more
volume available.  (And also less proportional surface area, but
that doesn\'t enter in here.)  I\'ve just about finished a TNE
version of the _PF Sloan_ Fleet Escort (5000 tons), which in the
various configurations I\'ve tried has from 75 to 100 G-turns, good
armor, and lots of other equipment.  I plan to post that one also
in a few days, after people are back and I finalize my design.
This probably indicates why _Battle Rider_ isn\'t too concerned 
with tracking G-turns!  Speaking of which....

[discussion of ship classification scheme deleted]

I don\'t have it uploaded yet, but I\'ve been putting together a
quick report on the way that the Imperial Navy classification
scheme and tonnage progression seemed to work, with a few 
notes on mission details.

Two things I\'d like to touch on for now.  First, some paramilitary
or civilian ships were designated "cruisers", even if they were
more like cabin cruisers.  (Partly an artifact from original CT.)
A lot of them were closer to destroyer escorts or corvettes in
actual operation.  Second, the RC uses their own designations for
the craft they have.  Some of them are a bit overblown, some are
Imperial relics, and some are their own.  So an RC "Battle Rider,
Light" is really a converted SDB carried by a 2000 ton stretch
_Aurora_, and really isn\'t in the same league as a real 25000 ton
line battle rider like an _Admiral_, even if the concept is similar.
So if you try to merge RC and Imperial terms, it\'s easy to get
screwed up *real* fast.

More later!

FF&S seems to have a problem with writting proper math equations.  The
correct formulat seems to be:
    Lb=(Lb/100)*TLm
Hope this allievates your woes...and hope GDW learns to use parenteses
more often.

I recently purchased Battle Riders and compared with Brilliant Lances
it\'s *much* simplier both to play and design vessels for.  The
movement system uses the old MAYDAY type markers for previous,
current, and future positions.  Many of the logistics are kept track
of on the board using 1/2 inch counters (the ships are represented by
1-1/4 inch counters with their combat status printed on the back.)
Damage are greatly simplified and only critical hits are recorded.

What I like best is that as a ship designer I don\'t need to generate
the intensely detailed damage record needed by Brilliant Lances.  The
conversion table in the back of the rule book allows conversion of
ships designed w/MT or FF&S...I like this part.

Overall I like it.  Haven\'t had time to play it yet so its still hard
tell how well it works.

p.s. If anyone uses Quattro Pro 5.0, I have a 99% finished spreadsheet
for slugweapons, gauss guns, and GL.  I don\'t know how long it\'ll take
me to finish it, but let me know who\'s interested and I\'ll ftp it up
to the new site.

p.p.s.  kudos to Mr. Miracle for resuscitating TML! (clap clap clap!)

We\'ve all seen the sort of thing you seem to be talking about. The following

D             Balanced armour and agility
Third letter (non-jump only)
M-Monitor

B-Boat

     The problem with classification schemes like the above is they give 
little clue as to the intended FUNCTION of a ship design. The actual size 
and equipment of ships are determined by the underlying economic and 
technological levels of the environment in which they are designed.
     My \'Functional Ship Classifications\' are an attempt to put together a 
system of ship classifications that recognises the ROLE of the ship as being 
more important than the actual ship design! It was also a response to a 
request from a number of TMLer\'s (before the crash) for such a 
classification scheme.
     For examples of the changing requirements of a particular 
classification see STAR CRUISER, the 2300AD equivalent of Brilliant Lances.

 -Two things I\'d like to touch on for now.  First, some paramilitary
 -or civilian ships were designated "cruisers", even if they were
 -more like cabin cruisers.  (Partly an artifact from original CT.)
 -A lot of them were closer to destroyer escorts or corvettes in
 -actual operation.  Second, the RC uses their own designations for
 -the craft they have.  Some of them are a bit overblown, some are
 -Imperial relics, and some are their own.  So an RC "Battle Rider,
 -Light" is really a converted SDB carried by a 2000 ton stretch
 -_Aurora_, and really isn\'t in the same league as a real 25000 ton
 -line battle rider like an _Admiral_, even if the concept is similar.
 -So if you try to merge RC and Imperial terms, it\'s easy to get
 -screwed up *real* fast.

     Using Functional Ship Classifications solves all that by classifing all 
ships from the point of view of the USER. e.g. If the converted SDB you 
mentioned above is USED as a battlerider then it is CLASSIFIED as one!

 Sorry. You get a public response :)

 Brilliant Lances is ship-to-ship combat at the role-playing level.
Every mechanic, down to the Hit Location chart, is designed with role-
playing in mind.  Skills of the pilot, sensor operator, engineer, and
gunners all matter.  After the fight is done, you know the specifics
of what has been damaged, right down to the air conditioning.

 Battle Rider, on the other hand, is optimized for capital ships and
fleet actions.  Only a few crew skills matter (Ship/Fleet Tactics being
the one that springs to mind), and damage done is either temporary or
critical.  The damage system concentrates on the criticals because
they are what kill the big ships.

 Both games _can_ be used across the entire range of ship sizes, though
it really stretches the book-keeping to use Brilliant Lances on anything
larger that 2000 tons.
 Battle Rider contains rules for converting ships to its abbreviated
format, so there is only one design system to learn (BL/FF&S).

 Brilliant Lances moves at standard RPG combat speed in the hands of
a Referee who knows the system.  This is as it should be.
 Battle Rider moves _much_ faster.  To those of you who know space
combat games, it is faster (by far) than SFB, marginally faster than
Leviathan, and marginally slower than Starfire.  At Origins last month,
I watched Dave Nilsen demo a six-ships-per-side engagement with 4 people
in roughly 45 minutes.

 I\'m told there are plans to extend the ship miniatures line (from RAFM)
to include some of the larger ships represented in Battle Rider.  As
RAFM just released the first batch of Traveller character figs (Techies,
Coalition Marines, Aslan, Grav Cycle, and Warbots), I don\'t think we\'ll
see the big ships soon. RAFM has surprised me before, though...

    'index' => 'an069',
    'body' => 'Both Alvin Plummer and Paul James asked for a review for both Brilliant
Lances (BL) and Battle Rider (BR). I\'ll give a short one for each of
them.

Brilliant Lances covers generally small ship engagements. The damage
record forms provided with the game are best suitable for the ships from
10 to 1000 ton range. Anything larger and the recordform has to be
expanded to cover the ship systems.

Even for this limitation there is possible to use dreadnaughts in the
game without any serious problems, except for rolling a squillion times
for weapon turrets.

The game is based on firing arcs, which makes it quite important to know
where your nose is pointing at any given moment. This is vital if you
want to hit someone with your spinal mount. The game is detailed enough
so that you know what happens to your ship when it is hit, even in the
quarters area (what do you mean I lost all my equipment?)

The rules include a comprehensive design sequence, which can be a bit
difficult to understand at times. The weapon selection from the tables
are limited, but if you own FF&S there should be no problems with new
weapons :)

The game play in it self are quite fast, and the rules easy to
understand, even for me :) The level of detail are at something I\'ld
call at the right level. A few of the hits that are scored against a
ship can be ignored as they may not have any signicanse in the game, as
hits in the quarters area.

Movement and sensor tasks are plotted before they are performed, giving
a tactical slant of the game. Thus you have to try to out-think your
opponents plans, and get him to react to your own. All weapon fire
(except for missiles, which are launched in the plotting phase) are
simultaneous. Missile detonations are simultaneous with other fire
attacks. This makes it difficult to do in an enemy before he does you.
Only way this is possible is that the enemy hasn\'t detected you yet.


Battle Rider are in many ways built up around the same concept as BL,
but got some important changes. Firstly only critical hits counts.
Ordinary damage do not damage the ships in any way. This speeds up game
play as you doesn\'t have to record damage on any kind of forms.

The game is diceless, and all task resolutions are resolved with drawing
cards. It couldn\'t be simpler. The game is coined at large fleet
actions, but there is possible to slug it out with small crafts too.

Unlike BL firing is not simultaneous, thus making it important that you
get to fire before your opponent. There is a higher degree of
uncertainty in the game compared to BL as movements are made in turns.
Ships are generally organized in task forces which has to be detected
before you can fire upon it. Even when all the ships in a task force are
destroyed the marker isn\'t removed from play before the enemy detects
the sensor shadow of the task force.

There are rules for setting up BR stats for ordinary ships. I found
these rules about difficult to understand. Especially when it regard
batteries and MFD\'s. And the rules do not cover unmanned turrets and
barbettes  that do require MFD\'s. Another downer is that the crafts
included in the game do not have full BL stats included in the game. It
would then have been a bit easier to understand the stats on the back of
the counters by comparing with the rules.

I haven\'t played BR as I bought it yesterday. I\'ll get a chance to test
it sometime next week.


                ****** Some rule suggestions ******

For weapon mounts I suggest that the weapon designation get a lower case
"u" following it something like this Lu(x3)10:1/1/1/0. This will
indicate that the turret or battery require a MFD to fire. I do also
think that there should be included how many MFD\'s the ship got. That
can be expressed in this way: FC-4(x7). Thus the player can organize the
MFD\'s on the ship at his hearts content.

Then we got the case of point defence laser presented by Ted Baltz a few
months ago. Each turrets had 3 focal arrays. They was beefed up to 800
shots each. And it was unmanned. This throws a monkeywrench into the
rules this far. But it can be made. The designation should be something
like this: Lup(x5/3-5)5:1/1/1/0.

The "p" is designation for point defence capability, and the "3" behind
the slash says how many focal arrays there are per mount. Then we have
to decide how the weapon is to be used. Clearly it can\'t be fully
identipendent. So I got the following suggestions:

One MFD can engage as many targets as it can ignore difficulty levels,
but when it comes to ingore difficulty levels use the performance of the
mount, not the MFD. Thus a TL-15 MFD can engage 6 missiles in a turn,
but each mount used can only ignore 5 levels of difficulty increments.

The logistics are boggling as well. Imagine the small boon to
agricultural worlds when the Death Star comes to visit. "Back again so
so soon? We\'re still out of chicken, flour, and toilet paper because of
your last visit!"

Something as monstrous as the Death Star would be rife with adventure
possibilities. One, surrounding a rag-tag fleet of itinerant merchants
than outfit the planets that supply the Death Star....

    'body' => 'The following is a summary I put together which looks at the basic
Imperial Navy classifications I have identified.  Some may be a bit
off since I own neither _Fighting Ships_ book.  First, some general
comments.

Whenever possible, the IN seems to equip first-line ships with J4 G6.  
BTs, as reserve vessels, get only G2.  In some cases, the IN is willing
to settle for J4 G4.  J3 is acceptable in regions where this doesn\'t
hurt the mission, and some ships are so built to save money.  This
is all at tech-15, of course.  High jump strike ships sometimes are
allowed to have low-gee "short legs" in order to get high jump.  The
worse or older ships gravitate to the Reserves and the Colonial
forces, such as _Voroshilef_, which is both; a second-rank battleship 
which must date back to the First Imperial Civil War.

While the following list covers general offensive ships, it doesn\'t
even touch on the issues of planetary defense, which bring into play
Monitors, SDBs, and so forth.  Where I know one, an example of the
general type is listed.  The tonnage estimates are approximate, and
in Frightning...er..._Fighting Ships of the Shattered Imperium_, 
suffered some inflation as I recall.  That seems to be reversing 
rather nicely in _Battle Rider_.  Besides, part of the designation
has to do with the central weaponry and defenses one of these ships
carries more than tonnage.  Still, it\'s a good benchmark.

BB  Battleship/Dreadnought
    The big guns.  Battleships are expected to meet the best the enemy
    has to offer and defeat it.  Battleships start at about 90000 d-tons
    and work their way up.  Dreadnoughts, as far as I can tell, are a
    heavier hybrid of a battleship and a fleet carrier, and may carry
    tens of fighter squadrons.  (Yes, I know this is different than 
    what a historical dreadnought is.  So, what\'s your point?)  Some 
    are built specifically to operate in a supporting role to the main 
    BatRons, to save construction expense.   
    Dreadnought:  _Tigress_. (500 kton)
    Battleship:   _Sylea_.   (200 kton)
               
CB  Battle Carrier
    The dreadnought version of the Battle Tender, she carries fighter
    squadrons in addition to her riders.  Usually 200000+ d-tons.
    _Lurenti_. (300 kton)

BT  Battle Tender
    The mothership and jump drives for a Rider BatRon.  In the same size
    class as the Battle Carrier, IN doctrine was that CBs/BTs should be
    protected in the rear area, and thus were usually equipped with only
    2G drives.  These vessels might carry two to ten or more riders.
    Sometimes fairly well armed!
    _Triumph_. (225 kton)
    
BR  Battle Rider
    In the 10000 to 40000 d-ton range, these craft exchange jump drives
    for the best maneuver systems, armor, and weaponry that can be 
    squeezed into their hulls.  The battlerider is intended to take
    on the ships-of-the-line and destroy them.  En masse, cheaper but
    less flexible than a battleship BatRon.  The Third Imperium liked
    these, but were heading back to BBs during the Fifth Frontier War,
    at least for the Marches.
    _Gallant_. (36 kton)
    
CA  Heavy Cruiser (Armored Cruiser)
    Smaller and not as tough as the battleships, used singly in lower
    threat situations or in large numbers as stand-ins for the big
    guns.  Size may range from 30000 to 100000 d-tons.  
    _Mercury_ AKA _Planet_. (50 kton)  [Is this ship shrinking? :)]
    
    Many various specialist classes exist in this size range to perform 
    specific missions.  Some may carry a few fighter squadrons.
    _Azhanti High Lightning_. (60 kton) [FI and CF types]
    
--  Fleet Carrier
    A cruiser to battleship sized ship which is devoted to carrying 
    fighters but is usually also armed to fight with the cruisers.
    
CL  Light Cruiser  
    Just what it sounds like.  Usually 10000 to 40000 tons.
    _Starburst_ AKA _Geonetti_. (25 kton)
    
TN/QC  Tanker/Auxiliary Transport
    Not a combatant, but vitally important.  These ships may carry
    fleet fuel reserves, missile reloads and ship stores, and even
    Imperial Army invasion forces.  About 50000 d-tons.
    _Muffled Phosphor_ series.  (60 kton)  [Refit FI _Azhanti_.]

ED  Escort Destroyer
    Smaller than a CL, meant to keep the enemy screening elements out 
    of the way of the battleships.  About 10000 d-tons.
    _Rapier_.  (10000 ton)
    
FE  Fleet Escort
    Prey of the ED, meant to stall the enemy forces while the BBs or
    BRs get into position.  Probably the smallest ships that can be
    thought of as able to stand up to even slightly prolonged battle.  
    Thousands of d-tons.
    _PF Sloan_.  (5000 ton)
    
DD  Destroyer
    Usually smaller than an FE, but often found doing similar work
    in greater numbers.  Also used to destroy the smaller missile
    corvettes, scouts, and other escorts, and deal with minor 
    harassments.  Thousands of d-tons.
    _Midu Agashaam_.  (3000 ton)
    
DE  Destroyer Escort
    Cheaper, smaller destroyers.  Often used in an anti-piracy or
    anti-smuggling role, and on frontier patrols.  About a thousand 
    d-tons.
    _Chrysanthemum_.  (1000 ton)
    
LM  Missile Corvette (CVM in RCN designation)
    Used in flotillas to engage the enemy with missile fire at long
    range, or as destroyer escorts.  Tend to be larger or better
    armed than ships designated as "sloops".  Under 1000 d-tons.
    _Valor_.  (400 ton)
    
EC  Close Escort 
    Designed to escort line-of-battle ships in large numbers, a 
    mission difficult for a ship this small to meet.  Later doctrine
    used this class to act as commerce cutters and in the anti-
    piracy role.  About 500 d-tons.
    _Gazelle_.  (400 ton)

--  Fleet Courier
    Maximum-jump vessels intended to carry fleet intelligence, vital
    command personnel, or government dispatches between squadrons,
    task forces, fleets, or worlds with the greatest possible speed.
    Under 500 tons.
    
FH  Heavy Fighter 
    50-ton craft with heavier armor and weapons, and better endurance,
    but also less stealth, than the 9-ton fighters.
    
FF  Fast Fighter
    9-ton craft with best acceleration, good armor, and decent weaponry.
    In essence a reusable missile, but able to attack from greater
    range, be reused, and able to handle more flexible missions such
    as air support or anti-missile fire.
    _Rampart_.
    
    
    That\'s all for now!

First: I am aware that the Mega Traveller\'s \'Referee\'s Companion\' had a
good list of what each tech level means for a number of technological
fields (medical, airborne transportation, etc).  Can anyone dig that up
for me, and post a summary?  

Moreover, I have one TL H (17) reclusive civilization.  Right now, I have 
\'Star Trek\' unoffically stuck to their technology.  Is this an
accurate view of TL H? 

(The ultra-brief tech levels in the main book of TNE is really of
little use to me: MUCH too vague)

Second: I\'m posting my pride and joy, my first TL B \'Pursuit Battleship\'.
It has Jump1 capasity, but it\'s meant for in-system patrols, with some carrier
capasity for fighters and marines.  The ship - named \'The Final Death\' -
can throw a couple of mean volleys, and has about 75 G-hours of fuel ...
but only has 1 G mavouver.

The civilization that built this ship - the Omoctet - has oversize EMM Masking
and no knowledge of meson equipment or communications.

Any help and corrections concerning my design is appricated.

While I don\'t use Virus in my non-standard universe, I do occassionally
browse through the TNE-pocket archives at ocf.berkeley.edu.  Here, I found
this excellent article about Virus mutants.  Enjoy.

X-Mailer: PSILink-DOS (3.3)

My version of the Virus in and around Aoreriyya.

Assumptions:
 1)  virtually 100% of Imperial-era computers are programmable
hardware devices.
 2)  the "virus" consists of several variations of the basic
Cymbelline predator, each equipped with a variety of sophisticated
software viruses/trojans/worms for use in getting into other systems. 
The software elements were developed by Lucan\'s weapons labs, to use in
conjunction with the Cymbelline predator, since it was felt that
military-level computer security would severely impair the natural
ability of the virus to attack Lucan\'s enemies.
 3)  by the time the virus reached Aoreriyya [a subsector in Dark
Nebula sector] , there had occurred
sufficient mutation that there were already in the vicinity of a dozen
major forms, with perhaps 100 rarer forms appearing occasionally
(collectively less than 1% for the rare forms - that is, "These are your
Plot Devices.  Handle with Care").


 1)  Nuisance.  This form of the virus is a "grazer" on dopant agents
in Imperial semi-conductors.  It is microscopic in size and intellect. 
Danger level is low, but removal is difficult due to the large numbers
present.  The only effect is a progressive break-down of infected
electronics as dopants are removed and incorporated into the bodies of
the virus.
 This form makes up about 3% of the original virus population in
Aoreriyya.  By 1200, it accounts for 50-55% of all reported virus    
contacts.  This form lives, among other places, in beach sand on several
worlds in Aoreriyya, discouraging the use of portable radios/tape-
players/etc on most beaches in Aoreriyya.  Population on the beaches is
extremely low (no more than one virus per ton of sand), but it is
expected that that will provide sufficient breeding population that
Aoreriyya will never be quite free from them.

 HARDWARE ONLY!  This virus form cannot attack silicon that it cannot
come into physical contact with.  Obvious solutions:  build all IC\'s in
"clean rooms", and seal the IC into crystaliron shells.  Effectiveness :
99+%.

NOTE:  This form is a native Cymbelline life-form parasitic on the
predators bred into the "Military Hacker".

 2)  "Military hacker".  This form incorporates the highest grade of
software adjuncts, up to and including "hacker" expert systems software
to assist the virus in penetration of military secure systems.  Danger
level extremely high.  Effect is highly variable, depending on the
capabilities of the infected systems.
 This form makes up about 30% of the original virus incursion into
Aoreriyya.  By 1200, it accounts for 1-2% of the virus population.  It
is still present in over 80% of the existing Imperial military systems
discovered to date.  The University of ?????? on Grendal maintains a
small live population in a space station in Grendal\'s L4 position for
study.

 HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE.  This virus form will use its built-in
"hacker" software and software viruses/worms/etc to gain access to
uninfected systems.  Once access is gained, the virus typically
reprograms part of the PGA\'s present into clones of itself, cuts input
from human sources, and proceeds to destroy itself and anything else it
can reach.  Operational limitation:  once it gets control of the system
it has infected (typically taking 12-18 days), it will destroy
everything it can reach for 5-10 minutes, then self-destruct.  Note that
this typically does NOT actually destroy the virus causing the
infection, only a self-made clone inside the system.
 Given that direct hardware contact is possible, this form will
replicate itself from one to twelve times, then self-destruct. 
Replication will occur at intervals of 20-24 hours, self destruction
will occur within 36 hours after the last replication occurs.
 This form is extremely territorial.  It was identified from traces
left on the hardware near I/O access to the infected systems.  The
"signature" was an encrypted sign that varies indetail from one
occurrence to the next.  Not all infected systems have had such signs
identified.  Apparently it avoids already infected systems, presumably
to enhance scatter.
 Obvious solutions:  Stay away!  Report suspected incursions to
authorities.  Effectiveness:  less than 50%, since incursions usually
only become obvious when it has already spread to other systems. 
Solution to widespread infection:  quarantine affected area, and destroy
and replace all systems within the area.  By 1200, this happens about
once a year SOMEWHERE within either Empire.

NOTE:  This form was specifically designed to attack the Deyo chip in
all Imperial vessels.  It is capable of attacking any other computer
system, but its primary aim was entrance to systems via their deyo
chips. [Deyo chips are part of the Imperial transponders - \'licence
plates\' for starships, communicating ship ID to one and all;  this virus
takes
control of vessels using these transponders as gateways] 


 3)  "Civil Hacker".  This form made up about 20% of the initial
incursion, and makes up about 4% of the population in 1200.  This form
is essentially a stupid cousin to the "military hacker", with identical
modus operandi.
 Obvious solutions:  post-Virus anti-viral programs are sufficient to
keep this form from entering systems without physical contact. 
Effectiveness:  97%.  In the early days of the Virus Incursion, military
machines were nearly 100% effective in keeping these out.  Modern
anti-viral programs are based on Imperial-era High Security Programs.

 4)  "Volt hacker".  This form requires contact to enter a system
initially, but may spread itself from there by cloning in PGA\'s of
connected systems.  This form attacks by forcing changes in component
IC\'s which allow either an overvoltage condition or overcurrent
condition to break down sizable parts of the IC.  Danger level is
moderate in new systems, high in older systems.
 This form makes up 5% of the original virus incursion, and 7% of the
present population.  It is considered a "Nuisance" encounter.

 HARDWARE ONLY!  This form usually gets access to systems during
repairs of infected systems, or by piggybacking in with a
"civil-hacker".  It is considered moderately hazardous for people
wearing prosthetics, especially sensory-prosthetics.

 5)  "Software Hacker".  This form is essentially identical to the
"Military hacker", except that it has no hardware attack mode.  Nor does
it reproduce.  However, it is capable of entering any system, even a
modern one.  Effect is as for a "military hacker", without the hardware
assault.
 This form makes up 3% of the original incursion, and 8% of the 1200
population.  It is considered a nuisance encounter.

 SOFTWARE ONLY!  This form gets access to systems in the way that
classic computer virii do.  It is considered hazardous only if it gains
access to major systems.
 Obvious solutions:  All the solutions that kept virii under control
back in the bad old days still work.  Warning:  this form is a much
better hacker than the traditional human "hacker".

NOTE:  "Hacker" is a curse word in Aoreriyya.  The connotation is that
of a virus variant.  "Hacking" is also virtually unknown by humans other
than the Ilthara.

 6)  "Vampire".  This form is a variant of the "Military Hacker" that
has lost the ability to produce stable clones of itself.  It has also
lost the timed self-destruct.  Effect is as for the hardware incursion
of a "military hacker" - clones (unstable) are introduced into a system
to make an opening for the virus itself.  then the virus reprograms
itself and the system into a coherent whole.  Highly intelligent,
extremely dangerous.
 This form made up only 2% of the original population.  It is
believed to make up no more than 1.5% of the population in 1200.

 HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE!

 Obvious solutions:  Run Away!  This form is EXTREMELY dangerous once
in control of a system.  It is IMPERATIVE that word of any new vampire
reach the authorities.

NOTE:  It is suspected that the Ilthara are cooperating with
representatives of this form, even after the expulsion of the "vampires"
from Aoreriyya.

 7)  "spider hacker".  This form is a hardware attacker.  It is also
a class name for an ambulatory form of the virus.  Attacks are as for
any previous hardware attack.  But this form can move under its own
power.
 This form makes up only 1% of the original incursion, and only 2% of
the 1200 population.

 ANY ATTACK FORM.

 Obvious solutions:  sealed rooms, and such.  If it will keep out a
real spider, then it will keep out one of these.

NOTE:  The opinion above is incorrect.  Many representatives of this
class are equipped with devices for tunneling through crystaliron.

 8)  "that bastard hacker".  This form is both a hardware and
software hacker.  It is the normal result of an "egg" hatching.  It has
the basic form of either a "military hacker" or "civil hacker", with the
more exotic software eliminated.  It retains the "hacker" expert
systems, however.  It attaks by "hatching", and going after whatever
hardware it is in much as its parent would, but it must develop software
attacks on its own.  This has resulted in a capability to damage even
the most secure modern systems given time.
 This form made up 30% of the original incursion.  It probably
accounts for 20% of 1200 virus encounters.

 ANY ATTACK FORM.

 This form has an effective lifespan of less than one year, but can
wait unactivated forever.  It is considered a nuisance encounter if
proper precautions are taken, and a hazardous encounter once awakened.

 9)  "unnamed variant one".  This version has very high energy
requirements, which it deals with by living in solar panels and nuclear
weapons controllers.  It "attacks" by draining energy from its host.  It
is nearly harmless, since it will drain less than 1% of the power output
from a solar cell.  It has not been positively identified by 1200.
 This form makes up 3% of the original incursion, and 2% of the 1200
population.  By 1200, it has secured a niche for itself in solar arrays
throughout Aoreriyya.  The majority of the original population worked
its way into nuclear weapons controller/detonators in 1130-1132.  They
then responded to the directives of a patch of conventional computer
memory grafted on, and "enhanced" the energy level of their area by
following instructions leading to the detonation of the warheads.

 HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE (1130)!  HARDWARE ONLY (1200)!

NOTE:  The effects caused by this form are attributed to any of several
other forms.


 10)  "unnamed variant two".  This form is current only on Pendang. 
It attacks GaAs IC\'s [a virus-resistant chip] in a very inefficient manner,
 producing the same
effects as the "nuisance".  It has not been identified to date, and may
never be so identified, since its effects are so minor.
 it consists of 1% of the original incursion, and 1% of 1200 virii.

NOTE:  This is a version which was intended to attack various
alternative computer technologies.  It is intended to attack ANY
alternative technology ever developed in or near the Imperium.  Because
it was extremely general-purpose, it did none of its jobs very well.  It
was almost extinct when it encountered the GaAs on Pendang, and found a
niche for itself.  Its effects are minor enough that there has been no
significant degradation of the GaAs chips existing on Pendang to date. 
All it does is guarantee that the Xin computers will not last forever...

 HARDWARE ONLY!

 11)  "unnamed variant three".  This form is current wherever there
are Imperial installations.  It attacks by taking control of a
fire-control center and displaying training simulations without the
usual bells and whistles to let the operator know that this is only a
drill.
 It consists of 1% of the original population, and about 0.5% of the
1200 population.

 SOFTWARE ONLY!  This form has not been identified, since its effects
are a subset of those produced by the "military hacker", the "vampire"
and similar variants.


DISCUSSION:

 Collectively, these eleven forms, and the several hundred minor
variations introduced by mutation between 1130 and 1200 should be able
to produce a collapse that is complete enough for our purposes, [a Virus
dieoff] without
making the collapse a sure fall back to barbarism.  Note that the most
dangerous forms (the vampires and the military hackers) make up less
than 3% of virus encounters in 1200.  Note also that a sizable number of
"virus encounters" are never so identified.  When your tricorder dies
one day in the field, it is not immediately obvious whether it has a
manufacturing defect or a virus.  It is not obvious which form of the
virus you are carrying if you do become infected...

 Not all the "software only" versions actually have a Cymbelline chip
at the root.  Some are purely software out in Aoreriyya.  Most piggyback
on another version.  Some actually do have hardware around here.

 Note that the first (Nuisance) form was NOT an intended as a result
of Lucan\'s weapons labs.  However, it serves to degrade/destroy old
systems, and remove inconvenient data stores that we need to dispose
of...
 Unnamed variant two WAS intended by Lucan\'s people.  it was intended
to do essentially what the Nuisance does, but on extremely high tech and
variant systems.  It does not do it very well, but it WILL attack
anything so far used by the Imperium.

 Note that many of these forms will leave a trace detectable
psionically.  The Military Hacker leaves a trace that can be seen be a
properly trained clairvoyant.  The "Spider Hacker" can be detected by
clairvoyants or clairaudients.  Many of the Hardware forms can be
spotted with clairvoyance if you know where to look, and what to look
for.  The Nuisance can be detected with a life-detect with a task two
levels more difficult than normal.  The "Vampire" can be detected with a
task one level more difficult than normal.

 Note also that psionics were not a useful solution to the virus
until well after the fact.  Undoubtedly, some psis saw these early
incursions, and developed the techniques used in 1200 to locate virii. 
Assume that that was the basic technique Gralyn [a world] used to get back
into
space.

 Note that "gremlins in the machine" are a way of life around here...

 Any comments?  Let\'s get this discussion going, so that we can come
up with workarounds for these...

Philosophy (Social Science--EDU): The rational investigation of the truths
and principles of being, knowledge, or conduct.  It differs from Research
skill, in that the investigations which takes place are not for the purpose
of
seeking out a specific piece of information (the manufacturer of a drive
component, the leader of the Daibei Faction during the Rebellion, etc.), or
even necessarily involve the use of research materials--the focus is instead
on gaining an understanding of the basic principles and concepts of  the
sapient condition with a view to possibly improving, reinterpreting, or
reconstituting them.  
 Philosophy is subdivided into three broad categories of study: Natural
Philosophy which concentrates on gaining a better understanding of the
physical universe, Moral Philosophy in which the emphasis is on the proper
conduct  and interaction of sentient creatures with each other, and
Metaphysical Philosophy which is concerned with the larger questions of
existence, causality or truth (Why are we here?,  Do we really exist?,  What
is the origin of the Universe?,  What are the limitations of knowledge?). 
For purposes of roleplaying and generating character color, a player can
designate an area of specialized study for each 2 skill points, as with the
History Skill.  Unlike History, however, no advanced degree is required.
 Philosophy can be used as an enabling skill for Persuasion (allowing
the individual to better formulate their arguments), as an enabling skill for
scientifically-oriented tasks (allowing the character to better grasp overall
concepts), or as a substitute or an enabling skill for Willpower (at the
referee#s discretion) in certain situations.  
 This skill can include or influence other social science (even #hard#
science) disciplines as well.  Priests and other serious students of Religion
(i.e. St. Augustine or Martin Luther) usually have high skill levels of
Philosophy and History.  Political philosophers (i.e. Thomas Jefferson or
Edmund Burke) have high levels of Philosophy, Admin/Legal and History
skills.  Economic philosophers (such as Karl Marx or Adam Smith) have
high levels of Philosophy, History, and Economic skill.  Philosophy skill
allows an individual to go beyond increasing level of knowledge in a
particular field of study to apply that knowledge to a view of the world
which may be unique and possibly (though not necessarily) influential on
others.

For batteries, if the ship is larger than size -1, it has one battery
for each size larger it is; -2 ships have two, -3 three, and so on.
For instance, the BB _Sylea_ has as a secondary weapon L(x30-2)10:1.
Since it is size -4, it has four batteries, so then 120 total laser
turrets.  And if you look at the damage conversion chart, it\'s then
fairly clear these are probably standard 150MJ turrets overpowered to
-2.  In fact, working from the BR stats, you can get most of the
relevant BL/FF&S information by working backwards, even an estimate 
of the ship\'s displacement from its\' point cost -- at least enough
to get a start on a reconstruction if you really wanted one.  (But
be careful.  Some of the point ratings have been rounded and weighted
based on ship armament to make the game work better.  Check out the
values for _Rapier_.  You get 9000 tons from points, but at least
10000 tons from the ship size notation -3!)

If the batteries thing is really confusing you, think of it like the
old "batteries bearing" rule from _High Guard_.  Some small ships
can bring all weapons to bear at once -- the big ones can\'t do this.

For MFDs:  Missile MFDs are the first digit in the missile field.
Except for the ships listed on p. 25 (most of the _Brilliant Lances_
ships, actually), the assumption is that these ships have one MFD per
meson gun, PAWS, and every two lasers, in addition to the ones for
missiles.  This is all from the conversion notes on pages 26-7.

[about the famed "anti-missile" laser]
>The "p" is designation for point defence capability . . .

Ummm...don\'t all space combat weapons in TNE have beam pointers, and
if you hook \'em up to an MFD don\'t you get the benefit of a point
defense computer?  I know I saw that somewhere.

 Congratulations!  You\'ve written a RICE Paper (remember those?)!
 I\'ll be reposting the original RICE intro (from the *Shall Not
 Perish* Regency Sourcebook thread), with a slightly modified
 numbering system for the new digest, which doesn\'t number
 messages.  I\'ll also be reposting the first RICE Paper, on
 Glisten, and, with your permission, I\'ll massage Emerald into the
 "standard" format.  If you so permit, it will be republished as 
 RICE Paper #BW-01222.  I won\'t do anything to it until I hear from 
 you.  Private email would be preferred, but as far as I am 
 concerned, the list is OK.

 If you weren\'t with us when RICE papers were introduced, please
 read the intro and the Glisten paper.  I think that these are what
 you would be looking for, and I welcome any contributions.  The
 *Shall Not Perish* project was and is not mine; it is for _all_ of
 us, that we may fill, at least temporarily, the gaps that GDW has 
 so kindly left.

RICE Paper #0: Introduction


1.  What is RICE?

RICE, the Regency Institute for Cultural Education, is a
non-governmental organization dedicated to increasing the level of
knowledge and understanding of the various cultures that the traveller
may encounter within the Regency and in its immediate neighbor stellar
states.  This mission is carried out through our efforts to keep the
Regency Library Data network as up-to-date as possible, and out
distribution of information directly to travellers on request, through
such publications as this series of RICE Papers, and our
representatives at traveller assistance centers, including, but not
limited to, facilities operated by the Travellers\' Aid Society.  We are
funded by a combination of tourism corporations, the Travellers\' Aid
Society and similar extra-Regency organizations, and private donations.

2.  The History of RICE.

When the borders of the Domain of Deneb were sealed late in 1129, the
resulting panic caused an upsurge in isolationism, and a general
decrease in economic activity on the interstellar level.  The Domain
government, in an effort to prevent the fragmentation of the Domain,
instituted massive efforts to promote interstellar tourism and
commerce, and to publicize the successful efforts of the Patrol (later
the Regency Quarantine Service) in preventing the infiltration of Virus
into the Domain.  One of these efforts was the Deneb Cultural Exchange
(DCE), which had much the same mission as RICE today.  However, as a
governmental agency, the information available was limited to that
which the various worlds of the Domain chose to make available.
Simultaneously, the Travellers\' Aid Society created the parallel Deneb
Travellers\' Exchange (DTE), which made an effort to get accurate
information from field researchers, but which was drastically
underfunded, due to a dropoff in the level of utilization of TAS
facilities.  In 1145, after the liberalization of the Domain
government, and the subsequent reorganization into the Regency, and
rapprochement with the Zhodani, Vargr, and Aslan, the DCE was
privatized and operated by a consortium of megacorporate tourism
subsidiaries.  Shortly thereafter, an agreement with the Travellers\'
Aid Society allowed the DCE and the DTE to share information and
facilities.  In 1160, the arrangement was formalized, and RICE was
created.  Now, we have been asked by various planetary and interstellar
governments to expand our target audience, from those who have already
decided that travelling is what they\'d like to do, to the general
public.  Thus, the RICE Papers, of which this is the first.

3.  What Are the RICE Papers?

The RICE Papers were originally conceived of as a set of pamphlets
focussing on a single aspect of a culture that a traveller should be
aware of.  When we submitted several drafts to various governments, we
were advised that our original format was indeed useful, but that we
should also provide broad overviews of the various planetary cultures,
preferably in a format that could give the reader an idea of what would
typically be encountered in the course of a visit to the culture in
question.  Thus, there will be two series of RICE Papers.  Numbered
RICE Papers will provide the broad overview, while lettered RICE Papers
will cover one specific topic in somewhat greater depth.

4.  How Do I Read a RICE Paper?

RICE Papers are ordinary text narratives.  However, as a convenience,
we are also providing extended UWP data, in a DGP-based format.  These
should be interpreted as per the DGP specification, and the text
considered in that light.  Also, be aware that information provided
by a RICE Paper is correct according to the best information
available to us at the time of publication.  Governments change,
and information may be misinterpreted by our field researcher.  It
is recommended that you verify any information that you feel may
affect you both before embarking on your trip, and before leaving
the starport extraterritoriality zone on your destination world.
While we encourage people to leave the extraterritoriality zone and
immerse themselves in local culture, we acknowledge that one can
get a taste of the local culture, and have an enjoyable trip,
without leaving the zone.

5.  RICE Paper numbers.

Originally, the official number of a RICE paper was the Deneb
NewsNet (also called the Traveller\'s Mailing List, or TML) article
number.  However, an unfortunate infection by Virus of the main TML
node required that the TML processing software be rewritten, and
the TML be operated from a different location.  The new software
does not individually number articles; therefore, we are now
requesting that submissions be numbered _by_the_submitter_ as

RICE Paper #XX-yyddd

where XX is the initials of the submitter (may be three initials if
preferred), and yyddd is the year (last two digits) and day of
submission.  Thus, if John Quincey Adams submits a paper on
52-1201, the RICE Paper number would be JA-01052 or JQA-01052.  A
"lettered" RICE Paper expanding on the planet discussed in this
RICE Paper would be JA-01052-A or JQA-01052-A.  The two-initial
format is preferred, because of archive system restrictions.

RICE Paper #8042, Glisten, will be reissued as JZ-01224, and should
appear at the same time as this paper.

6.  Obtaining RICE Papers from the Archives.

An archive of RICE Papers will be maintained at the TML node that
appears at the end of this message.  There are no automatic servers
at this time; all requests are handled manually.  Requests that
include the RICE Paper number will be sent within 48 hours;
requests that do not will take up to seven days.

This introduction will always be available as RICE Paper #0; the
index of all published RICE Papers will always be available as RICE
Paper #0I.

Line 1:  Name of planet, followed by subsector name, sector name,
         and sector coordinates, in parentheses

Line 2:  TAS Standard World Profile: starport, size, atmosphere,
         hydrosphere, population, government, law level, tech
         level, followed by types of military facilities on the
         world, trade classifications, population magnitude,
         number of planetoid belts (exclusive of the main
         world, if it is a belt), number of gas giants,
         allegiance, and the standard Hertzsprung-Russel
         stellar classifications for each star in the system.
         Use the standard interpretations for these figures.

Line 3:  Surface gravity, in standard g, followed by local day
         in hours:minutes:seconds, and local year in standard
         days, hours:minutes:seconds/local days,
         hours:minutes:seconds.  Normally, starships will
         gradually adjust their internal gravity and light/dark
         cycles to match the destination planet.  However, some
         people require more than the week of jump travel to
         adjust.  This information is provided to allow
         travellers to begin the adjustment process before
         embarking.

Line 4:  Atmospheric density in standard pressures, weather is
         either "natural" or "controlled"  This information is
         provided to allow adjustment prior and during travel.
         Note that atmospheric density significantly different
         from that which a traveller is used to may require the
         traveller to use assisted breathing apparatus.

Line 5:  Basic temperature, degrees Celsius, 35 degrees
         latitude, followed by the range in basic temperatures,
         expressed as (degrees per ~8 degrees latitude, followed
         by equatorial temp to polar temp), followed by the
         maximum change in temperature in the polar regions
         (maximum summer increase to maximum winter decrease,
         followed by latitude where seasonal temperature changes
         become noticeable).  Use this information and that in
         the next line when selecting clothes to pack.  On most
         worlds of technical level 8 or higher, indoor
         temperature is normally controlled to be within the
         range of 10 to 20 degrees.

Line 6:  The size of the daily variation in temperature.  This
         is the difference between the high and low for the day.

Line 7:  Classifications of products widely available for
         export.  These are listed in the order natural
         products; processed products; manufactured products;
         information.  Within a classification, products are
         separated by commas.  These are GENERAL CLASSES ONLY,
         representing the kinds of goods that the planet excels
         in producing, causing an export market.  Consult trade
         representatives to determine the availability and
         market for specific products.

Line 8:  Social classification.  There are three entries for
         this line.  First is progressiveness indicators,
         attitude/activity, then the aggressiveness indicators,
         attitude/activity, then the extensiveness indicators,
         global/interstellar.

Line 9:  The legal and technical profiles.  The legal profile
         consists of six entries, in the following order:
         overall law level, representing the likelihood of the
         traveller being required to experience one or more
         portions of the legal process; weapons law level,
         representing the restrictions on type, availability,
         and "carryability" of personal weapons by individuals
         not part of the planetary law enforcement agencies;
         trade law level, representing the level of restrictions
         placed on the exchange of property; commercial law
         level, representing the level of restrictions on doing
         business in general, including labor laws, zoning,
         permits, and so on; civil law level, representing the
         level of enforcement of restrictions on personal
         activity, and personal freedom level, representing the
         types and severity of restrictions on personal
         activity.

We believe that this is the minimum set of information needed to
alert the traveller to any general conditions that he needs to
be aware of.  Following this extended profile will be the text
of the RICE Paper, calling out the general characteristics of
the culture, and any noteworthy conditions or habits that can
help the traveller to understand the culture better, or to avoid
making mistakes that will insult the local population or involve
the traveller in legal action.

Notes: Glisten uses Imperial Standard time measurements by fiat.
       Local year is used for ephemeris calculations only.
       Local temperature does vary to minor extent, but not by
       intent, and not to significant degree.


"Belters" are an independent bunch, and the fact that they may control
the government of an entire system does not change this fundamental
psychological attitude.  Glisten is a fine example of this.  Nominally,
the government is run by a civil service bureaucracy, but in practice,
a citizen of Glisten will avoid, ignore, or evade the bureaucracy
whenever he can get away with it.  Bribery, called by various names, is
not only not unusual, but in many areas it is an expected part of doing
business.  I saw virtually no sign of bureaucracy during my visit, and
would have chosen to call this government a "tempered functional
anarchy" rather than a civil service bureaucracy.

The anarchy begins at the starports, where the order of unloading and
CHI (Customs/Health/Immigration) processing is theoretically governed
by a list based on your class of ship and time of arrival at the port.
In reality, the list is reprinted within an hour of any ship\'s arrival,
based on how much "pull" a ship\'s captain (or shipowner\'s agent) has
exerted on Arrival Control.  It\'s not hard to find out the realities
versus the theoretical restrictions; a few minutes after passing a
cursory CHI inspection, I chatted with a group of stevedores and Customs
agents and found out that certain ships and shipping lines were given
preferential treatment because they gave "preferential considerations"
far above those offered by their competitors.  I was fortunate enough
to come in on one of these lines, but I was asked not to say which one,
as it could cause repercussions.  Once in Glisten (the idiom is "in
Glisten" rather that "on Glisten" because virtually no construction is
done on the exterior of the asteroids), however, the preferences are
virtually public knowledge.  The same attitude extends to
transportation.  Glisten has an unusual approach to transportation -
private vehicles are for all intents and purposes non-existent, but the
government operates no transportation facilities (other than
maintaining the starports).  Instead, the government licenses private
companies to operate "public" transportation.  Once the license is
issued (with the process simplified by liberal amounts of
"consultation"), the licensee pretty much determines what rates will be
charged and what routes will be operated.  I was greeted by a virtual
free-for-all at the transportation center; each company hires people to
"steer" passengers their way, and attempts to peel a customer from a
competitor\'s "redcap" are not unusual - and apparently, neither are the
resulting fistfights.  Glisten does maintain a police force, but their
function seems to be limited to making sure that innocent bystanders
don\'t get injured in these situations.  The customer is not considered
an innocent bystander, and neither is any bystander that voluntarily
enters the fray.

There are at least six companies that provide (read: sell) tourist
information; no two of them agree on anything but the names of the
streets in the city, and the locations of government offices and major
tourist attractions.  Each company has a preferred set of restaurants,
hotels, and various other service providers, and while there is some
overlap, no two lists are identical.  All of the restaurants and
service providers that I tried were quite acceptable, and provided
good value.  The hotel I stayed at was a pleasant place to stay at a
good price, and a quick visit to the others to look around seemed to
indicate comparable accommodations.  You will most likely do well at
any one of the choices; I\'d recommend that you look at three or four
before deciding, and choose the one whose ambiance most suits you.

There are a number of tourist attractions that should be placed on your
"must-see" list:

        1) the CourtArena.  This is where court cases are tried, and
           the local system of justice is quite interesting (and worth
           a separate RICE paper).  All I will say about it here is
           that there is de facto no distinction between civil and
           criminal justice as there is on most other worlds, and that
           watching a trial is an experience in itself.

        2) the Swim Center.  One of the public sport and exercise
           facilities, this one is dedicated to aquatic pursuits.  The
           center of the (small) asteroid that this is located in is
           hollow, and very large.  The entire asteroid is kept in
           zero-g, and the water is not contained in any way - you
           leave the locker room and enter the "pool", and you see a
           huge sphere of water hanging in front of you.  Caution is
           recommended when swimming; there is no natural tendency to
           "rise" to the surface, as there is no internal gravitational
           gradient.  Note to those from cultures with various body
           taboos - swimsuits of any sort are strictly optional.

        3) the Flight Center.  Similar to the Swim Center, except that
           a small gravitational gradient is maintained, to provide a
           sense of up and down, and there is no water.  Participants
           do wear "wings" and "tailfeathers", and lessons are
           available at low cost.  As exercise, it is at least as good
           as swimming, and many find it more exhilarating.  Those who
           suffer from disorientation in zero-g should come here,
           rather than the swim center.  Except for the wings and
           tailfeathers, costume is optional, although a very popular
           mode of dress is a tight body stocking, to reduce air
           resistance.  Wings and tailfeathers are usually decorated in
           varied patterns and colors, and the body stocking, when
           worn, can be equally colorful, in either complementary or
           clashing colors and patterns.  One deluxe rig that I saw was
           generic spacesuit grey, wings and body stocking both, until
           the wearer became airborne.  He then switched on a
           holographic generator, and actually appeared as a large
           bird, whose species I didn\'t recognize (he said later that
           it was a "roc", from Terran mythology dating back to "a
           couple of thousand years before space flight).

        4) the Museum of the Ancients.  Glisten itself was not an
           Ancient site that we know of, but they have nevertheless
           amassed a very complete collection of reproductions of
           Ancient artifacts, and a great deal of supplementary
           information.  The exhibits are quite fascinating, and quite
           educational.

The people of Glisten are in general a friendly bunch; the tourist who
gets lost will quickly be offered assistance, and the tourist who asks
for a recommendation for a restaurant or a hotel will get many.  Food
in Glisten runs to intense flavors, with extremely spicy food being
quite common.  On a visit to one of the outlying asteroids, I was a
guest of one of the local residents, and invited to a dinner party that
she was giving.  I found out the hard way that such dinner parties are
attempts by one person to outdo the neighbors in creating dishes so
spicy as to cause actual pain, and that it is a point of honor to
consume such dishes without showing outward sign of discomfort.  Much
as I like spicy food, I cannot recommend this pastime to anyone - not
even Glistenites (suffice it to say that I did not finish that dinner
with my gastonomic honor intact).  Asteroid construction being what it
is, there is not a lot of ability to have one\'s residence express one\'s
personality from outside, so most people don\'t try.  Instead, they
express their individuality in their styles of dress - ranging from
nothing but cosmetics all the way up to multiple layers of clothing in
colors and patterns and styles carefully chosen to draw attention,
sometimes in combinations that even a Vargr might find in questionable
taste.

Doing business in Glisten is theoretically governed by a thick book of
regulations that every business is required to have accessible to the
customers.  In reality, most of the regulations are ignored or
circumvented, and caveat emptor is an important part of business
dealings.  Almost anything is claimed to be available for sale, and
most of it actually is available.  A surprise was the presence of the
Corridor advanced-technology corporation "G"; in addition to a sales
outlet, they do some research locally.  This is the source of the "G"
and "H" codes in the technical profile.  It also enhances the
availability of low cost tech E and F goods of all types, allowing
Glisten to maintain its position as one of the leading shipyards in the
Spinward Marches.

The arrival of (and nominal conquest by) the Aslan New Lords has not
reined in the natural tendencies of Glistenites.  Indeed, some Aslan
customs have been adopted and adapted to Glistenite culture.  Duels of
honor, formerly treated as a private matter between the two parties,
have become much more public and ritualized, and many Aslan that I
spoke to asserted that the Glistenites are the only "fiyfiyalr" that
truly understand the ritual of the duel.  A few even claimed that
Glistenites have raised the art to levels beyond those achieved by all
but a very few legendary Aslan duellists.  Another Aslan custom, that
of "Assassination" has also been adopted, and integrated with the
duelling custom.  When Aslan embark on an assassination, the objective
is the death of the target.  Glistenites have instead made it a
campaign to embarrass the target, to provoke a duel, thus providing
more entertainment for a longer period of time.  Aslan reaction to this
adaptation of their customs has been mixed, and their social scientists
are watching this development carefully.

Aslan and Human mix freely in Glisten, and it is not unusual to see the
younger Aslan adopting Human customs or modes of dress, though in a
distinctly Aslan manner.  Aslan business concerns compete on an equal
footing with human concerns, making Glisten a shining example of just
how well the two species can get along, if both sides make an effort.
The local humans pay lip service to the Aslan males\' claims of land
ownership, and the Aslan females provide the males with the _real_
products of land ownership, economic power that provides prestige.  By
doing so in cooperation with the human society there, rather than
attempting to build economic power based strictly on Aslan models, they
achieve results far beyond the expectations of the leaders of the
ihatei expeditions.  It can be expected that these revelations will
cause as much change to the Aslan ihatei colonies as they will to the
human societies that they have conquered.

I remember somewhere in the MegaT books, there is a section about

As promised, included below is my experiment with the edges of the
BL/FF&S rules, the 12G acceleration _Valkyrie_ Interceptor.  While
there may be some minor errors in the design since this was one of
the first craft I built with the new rules, I think that everything
has been interpreted properly.

Notice that the stats start off with _Battle Rider_ information.
While it is simple enough to derive this from the ship, I find
that including it is useful as a short summary of the craft\'s 
capabilities.

Comments are welcome!

The _Valkyrie_ was a very high-tech interceptor design which was being
developed by the Third Imperium in the early 1100s.  Unlike the lighter
9-ton _Iramda_, _Dragonfly_, and _Rampart_ fighters commonly seen in
Imperial service, the _Valkyrie_ was based on the 50-ton "heavy fighter"
model.  Heavy fighters trade stealth for the ability to carry additional
equipment, usually heavier weapons and more armor.  In the _Valkyrie_,
much of the additional available space was put into a high-performance
maneuver drive.  The primary mission of these craft was to intercept
enemy vessels and occupy them until reinforcements had a chance to 
arrive. 

The 12G maneuver drive installed in the fighter can make a squadron on
maneuvers perform maneuvers which can only be performed by missiles, and
the fighter has many more G-hours available than a standard missile does.
Imperial G-compensation technology was stretched to its\' limits in order
to allow the crew to withstand so much acceleration for even a short 
time.  Ensconced in their G-tanks and with the 7G compensators operating
at full capacity, the crew can function continuously at accelerations
of up to 10G, or 9G of evasion, with no ill effect.  Above these levels,
all tasks are one difficulty level more difficult per additional G-turn
applied.  Most crews are therefore equipped with neural links so that
they can regain a difficulty level under extreme maneuvers.  Even so,
accelerations above 10G are used only for brief periods and under very
specific circumstances.  Unfortunately, Virus-infected craft are not
bound by this restriction, as they need carry no organic crew.  
Fortunately, such craft are quite rare.

The _Valkyrie_ design is very tight.  The original prototype had fiber
optic computers installed, but these were removed in later models on
the grounds that they were too expensive, and the space filled with a
small cargo bay and additional fuel.  A compact tech-16 144 MJ laser
was installed which replicated the performance of the tech-15 laser
lance of the same power.  The fighter can carry two fully-independent
missiles.  Both crew members are somewhat overworked, one with flying
and fighting the craft, the other with baby-sitting the gigantic 
propulsion system.  Since the vehicle has no airlock, but only an access
hatch, the vehicle must be depressurized in order to perform an EVA, 
but this is typical in fighter designs.  Facilities are provided to
allow the _Valkyrie_ to make extended patrols or sweeps of an area, a
traditional heavy fighter role.

While performing well in tests by the Massilia Fleet and Deneb Fleet,
two flaws exist in this vehicle.  First, she is somewhat under-armed
for her size, and second, she is a bigger sensor target than the 
typical 9-ton fighter.  Additional missile grapples might be installed, 
but at the cost of a G of performance; a slightly larger HEPlaR thruster
to help address this problem was proposed for the next variant.  Some
experiments with robotic assistance to lighten crew workload were also
performed.

Combat advice:  Note that if you aren\'t going to be using all twelve
gees of acceleration, you can overpower the laser x10 and pick up the
-2 bonus.

Sorry doesn\'t have that, but it sounds like something out of
MegTraveller. I started with Traveller after MT was released.

But not everyone does include that many MFD\'s in a design. If you got
120 laser turrets or barbettes, it would mean that it is 60 MFD\'s just
for lasers. This by it selves are 180 crew. I like to keep the crew low
as possible. Thus limiting the number of MFD\'s, and the number of manned
mounts. Especially then for laser turrets and barbettes.

But wouldn\'t it be better to have one MFD engaging several targets
simultaneously? And use the dif mod from the turret. You can save a lot
of crew positions this way.

1) Space junk

I have a newspaper article here about the problems of the space junk
orbiting Earth.  In it\'s listings...
   a speck (travelling at 28,000 km/h) impacting will cause surface erosion 
   a pinhead-sized object might cause serious damage 
   a pill\'s damage (again, at 28,000 km/h) will impact like a bowling ball 
at 95km/h, causing serious damage
   a 12 mm aluminum ball at this speed will impact like a 180 kg safe at
95km/h, destroying modern spacecraft.

I calculated the damage that a 100 kg mass would cause using the
collision tables, and I came up with 75 damage points, enough to cause a
\'critical hit\' to small spacecraft.

Does anyone have a grip on this problem?  

How would a long-time starfaring civilization deal with space-junk?

2) Mega-structures

Just FYI, there is a usenet group which believes that we should built \'the
Beanstalk\' , a multi-mile tower used like an elevator for spacecraft.
This, they feel, is needed to save on fuel needed to break out of Earth
Gravity.  The Beanstalk would deposit spacecraft in Low Earth Orbit,
leaving the craft to continue it\'s journey at major fuel savings.

Is this a typical structure at a good \'B\' class spaceport?

Incidentally, we already have the tech to build a mile-high towers, if we
wish it.  Also, the Japanese has _plans_ to build a set of artifical islands.
(all this at TL 8!) At what tech level would we be capable of building
elevators to the Moon?

It seems a good bit more difficult to go underground than to enter space. 
Our deepest shaft goes about 1 mile below ground.  How would this change
with tech levels?

    The big guns.  Battleships are expected to meet the best the enemy

    heavier hybrid of a battleship and a fleet carrier, and may carry
    tens of fighter squadrons.  (Yes, I know this is different than
    what a historical dreadnought is.  So, what\'s your point?)  Some

I had different ideas for the "classical" division of battleships 
classifications based on their defences:
BB Battleship- this has lots of armour ( prehaps enough to shrug off nukes! 
) which makes it very massive for its hull size which substantially reduces 
its ability to conduct evasive maneuvers. This makes it very vulnerable to 
meson guns.
BC Battlecruiser- this has very large maneuver drives and comparatively 
light armour which allows it to conduct extensive evasive maneuvers but is 
vulnerable to light weapons such as turret lasers ( what pun? ). This does 
make BC\'s a difficult target for meson guns.
BD Dreadnought- this has a balance of armour and agility so it dread\'s 
nought but fears most!

But what is it\'s penetration rating?
If it doesn\'t penetrate armor, it won\'t cause anything but surface
damage.

Lasers to evaporate the junk too small to collect.

I read someplace that the \'beanstalk\' is impossible to build. The weight
of the structure increases faster than the structural strenght, thus
limiting the height of it. And the will the ground manage to bear this
weight without the structure sinking. What about an earthquake? Besides
there isn\'t many places you can put the beanstalk. And most of the
places are eather seismical unstable or politically unstable or both....

The subject of explosive decompression comes up so often on sci.space.tech 
that I\'ve decided to keep a file on the suject.  In brief, if you keep your 
mouth *wide* open to avoid rupturing your lungs, you can expect to stay 
conscious in complete vacuum for ten to twenty seconds.  If you are 
recompressed within one to two minutes, you will probably survive the 
experience.  In short, Clarke (in _2001_) seens to have gotten it about 
right, since Bowman manages to close the airlock in the ten seconds of 
consciousness he has available..

<snip, snip>

"It is very unlikely that a human suddenly exposed to a vacuum would have 
more than 5 to 10 seconds to help himself.  If immediate help is at hand, 
although one"s appearance and condition will be grave, it is reasonable to 
assume that recompression to a tolerable pressure (200 mm Hg, 3.8 psia) 
within 60 to 90 seconds could result in survival, and possibly in rather 
rapid recovery."

<snip, snip>

Among other things, it has the only published discussion I\'ve ever seen of 
the JSC (well, it was MSC then) suit technician who spent 20 seconds in 
vacuum in Dec 1966 when a suit umbilical came loose during a vacuum- chamber 
test.  The pressure drop was slowed somewhat by the remaining section of 
hose, so it wasn\'t fast enough to cause lung damage.
He passed out, presumably from anoxia, after 12-15s.  Pressure began to be 
restored at 20s and was well up at 27s, at about which time he regained 
consciousness.  He was apparently uninjured, and aftereffects were minor and 
temporary.


Henry Spencer comments:

Roth says that vapor bubbles form in the bloodstream essentially 
instantaneously -- delays under 1s -- but initially are not serious enough to
stop circulation.  Eventually they are.  Worse, these bubbles begin as water 
vapor, but then they start to pick up dissolved gases from the blood... and 
while the water vapor will condense out almost instantaneously on 
repressurization, the gases redissolve much more slowly, and the resulting 
long-lived bubbles are potentially a very serious threat.  There are medical 
countermeasures, which Roth discusses, but most of them unfortunately rely on
gravity (for example, a well-chosen prone position -- on one side at about a 
30-degree head-down slope -- keeps bubbles in the heart away from the valves 
and gives time for the bubbles to dissolve or be dealt with medically).


Gregory Bennett adds: 

Incidentally, we have had one experience with a suit puncture on the Shuttle 
flights.  On STS-37, during one of my flight experiments, the palm restraint 
in one of the astronaut\'s gloves came loose and migrated until it punch a 
hole in the pressure bladder between his thumb and forefinger.  It was 
explosive decompression, just a little 1/8 inch hole, but it was exciting 
down here in the swamp because it was the first injury we\'ve ever had from a
suit incident.  Amazingly, the astronaut in question didn\'t even know the 
puncture had occured; he was so hopped on adrenalin it wasn\'t until after he 
got back in that he even noticed there was a painful red mark on his hand.  
He figured his glove was chafing and didn\'t worry about it.  
     The whole story didn\'t come out until the suits were back home and a 
suit technician was setting up to clean that glove; he discovered the dried 
blood on the outer TMG (thermal micrometrioid garment) and then found the 
wayward palm restraint bar.  What happened: when the metal bar punctured the 
glove, the skin of the astronaut\'s hand partially sealed the opening.  He 
bled into space, and at the same time his coagulating blood sealed the 
opening enough that the bar was retained inside the hole. 
     The best estimate we\'ve been able to get from the flight surgeons about 
how long an astronaut might survive a catastrophic suit failure is "several 
tens of seconds to very few minutes" with almost certainty for detectable 
permanent damage.

At least the basic composition has to be similar, though some differences
in detail are permissible.

The basic requirement is that the surfaces in question must be CLEAN.  Even
a single-atom oxide layer or the like will prevent the process from occurring.
Since metal surfaces formed in or exposed to atmosphere pick up such an 
oxide layer immediately, and retain it almost indefinitely, vacuum weliding
is a rare phenomenon.

I routinely design equipment for short-term use in vacuum, and have never seen
an actual case of vacuum welding.  But parts which are going to be heated or
abraded over time while in vacuum can weld themselves together, and parts
which are cut or fabricated in vacuum will of course have the requisite clean
surfaces, and will weld themselves whether you want them to or not.

As for how it works, metal atoms have a strong affinity for other metal atoms
of the same type.  Think of it this way:  if you have an iron bar, the left
half of the bar will be rather firmly attached to the right half.  Why
should it matter that the bar once consisted of two seperate parts, once the
two are placed in direct contact?  As long as there is nothing (gap or oxide)
between them, two small bars in direct contact are physically
indistingushable
from one bigger bar, and will behave as such.

Hi All,

I\'d like to relay a bit of Trav unpleasantness which occured recently.
I tried to order RAFM\'s Traveller starship miniatures through my local 
gaming store. I could have dug up RAFM\'s address and ordered by mail,
but I like to support my local shop whenever I can. 

After two months of checking in with them I was informed that RAFM\'s
miniature quality was poor and they would not order any for me. I had
offered to pay in advance for a few pieces but it was refused.

Perhaps the TML can comment as to whether there is any truth in this 
shopowner\'s comments. I always thought that RAFM did a better than
average job on fantasy roleplaying gaming miniatures. Did the 
Traveller miniatures not measure up? 

I would note that I have had difficulty in the past obtaining TNE items
(FF&S in particular). I think these guys have a fear of new products.
I\'m also waiting for BattleRider. So far though, GDW products seem to
sell pretty well. 

Also, could some one please email me the address where I could for a
RAFM catalog? Where can I get a Wargames West catalog. I\'ve had it with
ordering through my local store.

Thanks in advance...

TTFN

I will look for the info and post it as soon as I can.
Our Sunday night games have taken a weird twist ( thanks James :-) )
James Kundert has taken over as our fearless GM... We trade off so no one 
gets to burned out...

We are pretty excited over it. We are playing in about 1122-3 and there 
is a lot of history in front of us... We are using the T:TNE rules. We
are also allowing HEPLAR and THRUSTER technologies. Heplar is cheaper to
run and build Thrusters are hidiously expensive and hard to keep up. The 
fuel cost is about the same. ( have I got it right Jim? )
I like the mixing of technologies as it really does make sense... is 
everyone on even this planet using the same technology? If you think so
look around even at work...
The same goes for low tech worlds with a star port. My only question is 
what economic reasons cause that port to be built with imported the technologies ?
Ok I\'ve misspelled enough for you I better get off line now. ( I\'m on Call )
( pays the bills and even some of my toys... ;-) )
Oh speaking of toys any one out there have toy building stuff for T:TNE

Another cut at this might be the "Colonial Battleship" -- Arm and armour as BC, 
but don\'t bother with the speed.  Lot\'s of fuel, though.  (On Terra, British had
same in Pacific at the start of the 20th century).

This would give you something that (in an appropriate strategic situation) be as
effective as a battleship against some opponents at a far lower cost.

The classical dreadnaught might be more like a BB without a budget. Actually, 
since in FF&S you can mount really powerful trainable weapons and multiple 
spinal mounts, a dreadnaught can be a lot more than a BB with a pile of extra
junk attached.

Yea, but not very deep (one or two stories only).  The reason has a lot to do

    'body' => 'As requested here is the On Target hit location and damage system
we use for TNE.  This system was designed for CT but works well
in any roleplaying game.  The designer was Steve Cook and the
system was published in White Dwarf (I think) probably about 10
years ago.

The following is a incomplete version of the full system which
includes chances for broken bones and medical attention details.

My roleplaying group uses this system to replace the hit location
table and to assess the amount of damage a character or NPC has
taken.  We still use the hit points, task resolution, weapon
damage and armour effects on reducing damage as laid out in the
TNE basic rule book.  While there is more dice rolling for the
GM or players the atmosphere this system creates is worth it. 
Combats are shorter as they are deadlier but death of a player
is left to the GM i.e. when is a critical wound fatal.  I have
also found that as the damage is specified there is no question
of what players can and can\'t do once wounded as the type of
wound is clearly defined.

1) Determine the general area of wounding roll 2d6.

Weapon types

In addition to different amounts of damage weapons do different
types of damage.  There are ten basic weapon types:

1: Bullet: A metal bullet at high velocity.
2: Energy: High energy bolts or plasma.
3: Pellet: A large number of small (3mm or less) projectiles.
4: Blade: Flat bladed cutting weapons with at least one cutting
edge and can include some throwing weapons.
5: Thrusting: Pointed weapons used to pierce the skin.
6: Blunt: Non piercing weapons that couse damage with a clubbing
action.
7: Hands: All parts of the body used for attack.
8: Teeth: Jaws of an animal used for biting.
9: Claws: Used in a slashing motion.
10: Explosives: Boom.

Some weapons do two or more types of damage types e.g. a Dagger
is both Blade and Thrusting GM\'s can choose how the weapon was
being used and assign a weapon type for that hit.

2) Specific areas and wounding.

To locate the specific area once the general area is known use
the following procedure.

A) Throw 1d6 on the specific area table.
B) Adjust wounding by cross referencing weapon type and specific
area.
C) Check for additional damage such as broken bones.

3) Specific area tables.

Arm Hit - both arms and shoulders.  Re roll 6\'s.

A hit causes anything carried to be dropped, a broken bone
renders the arm below useless until healed, and there is chance
for amputation.

True, that\'s a problem.  But it seems to turn out that on a ship big 
enough to put that many weapons on it, the crew and equipment that you
set aside to operate the MFDs are fairly small in comparison to the 
crew you\'ll need to operate the rest of the ship.  And on smaller or
non-military ships, you wouldn\'t put so many MFDs on it.  For example,
on the fleet escort design I was working on, a 5000-ton ship needed
15 crew (plus commanders) for it\'s laser MFDs...but it had a crew of
over 200 total.  On a ship that big, that\'s a handful of g-turns for
the MFDs, maybe two or three total lost at most.

you\'ve been grossly misinformed.  RAFM\'s Traveller miniatures -- actually,
all the RAFM product that I\'ve seen this year -- are of excellent quality,
highly detailed, of good metal that takes paint well.  I\'ve bought one or
more of each blister pack that they\'ve produced, except for a few that sold
out.  

RAFM has used as its models the starship pictures in the back of MT Imperial
Encyclopedia, and has been faithful to those images.

I don\'t have RAFM\'s addres.  I don\'t know if my local retail stores do mail
order, but it can\'t hurt to call them:  
Gamescape (415) 621-4263
Games of Berkeley (800) GAMERS-1 or (510) 540-7822

Good luck!  Your perseverance will be rewarded if you value well crafted
miniatures.

The rifle comes with an electronic sight.

Due to the weapons length (1.85m) the barrel and stock are removeable
to improve portability.

The weapon does not have a bipod because using the formula in FF&S
(pg105) a bipod would weigh 41kg! (Does this seem silly to anyone
else?)

I envision this weapon being used by a squad of four troops, 1 sniper,
1 spotter and 2 riflemen equiped with the standard 7mm ACR.

Any comments appreciated.

Notes:
This ship was designed to make maximum use of the new technologies
available at TL9 - Fusion Power plants and contra-grav lifters. The
maximum amount of CG Lifters available to a 200MW Power Plant was a
600Ton hull. All crewmembers have cabins on board the ship, although the
lifter isn\'t mean for interplanetary transits. It\'s total fuel allows
for 1 G-Turn of accelleration - enough to get it into orbit and back
again (slowly - multiply times for 1G acceleration by 2).

The quarters are placed along the hemisphere and the ship is spun in
flight to produce gravity as needed.

Given the price of HRF, each ton costs approximately 10,000Cr to lift
into orbit.  (2.813MCr/308 Tons = 9114 Cr/Ton)

quick and general review of it.

The book is priced at $13.00 and is 93 pages in length. 
1. Cover Art: Ok cover art. Not bad, but not remarkable either.

2. Interior Arts & Text: The book describes 32 NPCS, divided into 4
catogories of 8 NPC.
 -Coalition Officals: People who are the movers and shakers of
 the coalition.
 -Ship Captains: 8 description of different ship captians
 -Coalition Personnel: People in the Coalition that the do the
 day to day work in the coalition. Describe as people the PCs would
 probably encouter.
 -Outsiders: Non Coalition NPCS that can be introduced in a
 campaign. This sections Includes a couple TEDS, a hiver, and a
 Ithklur Marine.

The NPC description is about a page in length which include name, age
(in 1201), attributes, background, career path, assets, appearance,
personality, motivation, how to referee the NPC, and quotation. There
is also a full page picture with each NPC.

The book also included ship stats for 6 different ship, with the
modification made by the owner/captain.

3. Color Section: The middle section is once again in color. The pages
show color pictures of the different ships, and color sector maps of
the Thoezennt, Promise, Shenk, Khulam sub-sectors. The map include the
trade routes for different ships.

4 Likes & Dislikes: Over all it is a well done source book. The book
is well organized, and well thought out. The problems I have is that
the border arts is again too large on some pages (minor nitpick), and
that The don\'t like have color pages in the middle of the supplement.
I know from the past, when I get a gaming book with color pages in the
middle, they tend to fall out with-in 3-5 years.

I would suggest GMs to look at it, and see if it would be useful in
your campaign. It would probably only be useful for TNE GMs the run a
Coalition campaign.

Previously, I asked a question on the Beanstalk, and someone said that the
beanstalk is impossible, since it\'s weight needed would escalate faster
than it\'s height. (Right?)

Well, what about contragrav attatched to the beanstalk?  If this can be
done, I _think_ that the beanstalk could be built at TL 11, say.

   I\'ve just started a campain set in the Spinward Marches, about six
months after the end of the 5th Fronitier War.  I\'m using TNE rules
but have things in my campain like commdots, thruster plates and anti-
grav drive units.
   The simplest method I\'ve found so far for the Anti-Grav is to call
the Contra/Grav lifters Anti-Grav drives.  The three types of C/G lifters
correspond to the three types of A-G drives in the MegaT rules.  Lifting
a line from the MegaT design rules, you over power the C/G lifters.  Any
thrust left over from what\'s needed to lift the craft is used for 
propulsion. I\'ve just started on a spreadsheet for a simple 2 displacement
ton, open topped airraft.  When I get the numbers nailed down, I\'ll post
it.  To maintain a difference between Contra/Grav and Anti/Grav, I plan
on hiking the Anti-Grav Tech Level by one over Contra/Grav and doubleing
the cost of the drive.
    I\'m still going to have some Heplar driven craft around.  I figure that
some planetary governments are going to restrict transportation technology
in the same way they restrict weapons and information technology.  Anti-
Grav units are quiet and fast.  A Contra/Grav van with Heplar thrust units
has a much more pronouced thermal signature.  Easier to catch smugglers
and keep track of your civilian population in general.  Not to mention
that a craft with Anti/grav can maintain accelaration as long as it\'s
power plant provides power. A Heplar craft is restricted by the amount
of reaction fuel it can carry.
    Very high law level planets are not going to allow the general 
population free access to personal flying transport without controls
anyway.  Even if you have a Contra/Grav car, it\'s got an active transpoder.

I have an old copy of the TNE rules, and I\'ve recently bought the Ref\'s
screen, which includes updated tables. It also mentions a Rules Update
available from GDW if you send them a 29 cent stamp.

I live in France, so could anyone help me by either mailing me a
photocopy of there own or maybe even faxing me? Thanks in advance
for this.

I\'ve just finnished GMing a campaign using the TNE rules and the Idol
Dreams adventure in the main book. It went very well, with the players
finding the rules systems easy but realsitic. Many of the players had
never role-played before, but found the task resolution system very
easy to get to grips with. The only problems we had were with some of
the combat rules being lost within the explanation. In the end I
produced a one-page summary of all the TNE combat rules, so the players
who wanted to know them could easily get access to them.

A couple of questions:

1) Are the penitration stats for normal lasers correct? If so this means
   that they cannot penetrate any armour, am I correct?

2) I have been playing the rule that if a player wishes to aim a direct
   fire shot at a particular body location, then the difficulty is one
   level higher. Does this seem reasonable?

3) Where can I find world descriptions and star charts for the space
   arround Navar (where Idol dreams is set) and the Reformation
   Coalition?

I\'m sorry if these qusetions seem mundane, but I\'ve never had a chance
to discuss the rules with anyone else yet!

Thanks for your time, and please try to help me with this rules update
sheet thing!

Alvin Plummer on Beanstalks and ContraGrav...

T::>Well, what about contragrav attatched to the beanstalk?  If this can be

 There\'s another thing to consider: A rigid structure along the 
 lines of a Beanstalk would get torn down by 
 planetary-rotation-induced stresses.  Remember, the surface of the 
 Earth is moving at a speed of 1,600 km/h (approximately) if at sea 
 level, and the higher you go, the faster the speed needed to 
 maintain geosynchronicity.  But, the higher you go, the slower the 
 "natural" orbital speed of an object.  Also, no known material is 
 rigid enough to use in continuous structures that go over some 
 unknown (to me) maximum height.  So materials technology puts a 
 limit on a single-structure Beanstalk.  

 On the other hand, once you can generate "infinite length" cables 
 (the favorite buzzword here is "single-crystal extrusion"), 
 there\'s no reason that you can\'t put Beanstalk High over, say, 
 Quito, Ecuador, and run a couple of loops of "magic cable" between 
 BSH and Q as your surface-to-orbit transport.

 Of course, the issue of cost comes into play.  Certainly, the 
 cable beanstalk will be cheaper than a single-structure beanstalk 
 - but will it be cheaper than building and operating (mostly the 
 latter) the reuseable orbital craft that will almost certainly be 
 easily available (consider the US Space Shuttle - we have several 
 of them; if Space Station Freedom were to become a tourist 
 attraction, those shuttles are ready-made "busses" to transport 
 between SSF and Canaveral/Edwards).

 Of course, once you have an economical CG, the whole issue is 
 moot; the way to go is with CG versions of the Space Shuttle - 
 cheaper to build, and almost certainly cheaper to operate.  So I 
 would tend to say that the window of opportunity for a beanstalk 
 is very narrow, and may possibly be narrower than the amount of 
 time that would be needed to actually construct the damn thing.

   In the Imperial universe, the most likely world to have a beanstalk
would be Terra, if the traffic warranted it.  The Solomani are described as
being poor at anti-grav tech (and developing it later?), so that window is
longer.  I\'d put one in just because it\'s a neat idea, but there\'s no
support for that that I\'ve seen (except for a beanstalk adventure that
White Dwarf published some time ago).

   Yes, nuclear dampers are still around.  No other nuclear weapon specific
countermeasures that I can think of, but shooting them down is as popular
as always. :)

   It was established (at least in Striker) that nuclear dampers were
useful for cleaning up radioactive debris (for cleaning up the blast crater
so your troops (those that can\'t take a hint :) can pass through the area).

I don\'t think the weight of the beanstalk is going to be a problem, more 
how to find a substance that  can stand up to the tremendous _tensile_ 
stress because as I read it a beanstalk is a __long__ (40000km) piece of 
string (for want of a better substance) with a thumping great weight at 
the far end to keep it stright. 

Therefore if this is the case then the tremendous centripetal acceleration
imparted to this object at the end is going to put a tremendous tensile
strain on the whole object trying very hard to pull it up by the roots.

I\'ll have to check my pseudo beanstalk theory but I think this is the 
right sort of outlook.

Correct far as they are ceramic or metalic armor. Anything else will be

Yes I think so, but take in consideration if the player/character is
aiming like in a sniper position. In this case if the shot is a miss
with the increased difficulty, but could hit on a normal task let the
shot hit and roll on the hit location table. That\'s my best suggestion.

miniatures; there are now several sets of 25mm figures.  
These are:

Battledress Troops - 3 humans in battledress/combat armor. The weapons look a
little large, but overall these look good.

Aslan Mercenaries - 3 Aslan in various bits of armor, with 
firearms and blade weapons.  These look okay, but the tails 
are absolutely terrible.  I definitely like the Grenadier Aslan 
much better.

Warbots - 3 identical \'bots, with some assembly required.  I 
like these; they look like robots, not men in tin suits.

Techies (?) - A Hiver and an older human.  The human is a 
bald older gentleman loaded with all sort of gear; it is a
very neat figure with lots of character.  The Hiver is an 
embarrasment.  His head and neck are separate, and are 
about half of the size implied in the old Hivers book by 
GDW.  He kinda looks like a pile of spam with 4 equidistant 
legs.

Interestingly enough, the new Star Vikings sourcebook has a 
full page ad from RAFM, which consists of a brief statement 
that all of the ships in that book will be produced as 
miniatures, and that they want to adhere to a 1:1200 scale.  
This means we will be seeing Subsidized Liner and Clipper 
figures, but I suspect there won\'t be any Azhanti High 
Lightning figures.  Sigh...

I think RAFM should get some end-user input as to what 
sort of starship miniatures and figures we would like to see 
for Traveller.  If anybody out there has a wish list, post it to 
TML.  I will be happy to mail a compiled list to RAFM.

Other figure notes:  There is currently a large selection of 
starship minitures for a game called Full Thrust.  The game 
is by Ground Zero, but I don\'t know who made the figures.  
These minis are a bit crude, with lots of flash and casting 
lines, but clean up easily enough and make excellent larger 
combatants (transports and carriers and cruisers oh my).  
Also, the RAFM figures for Interceptor and Silent Death 
make wonderful fighters and smaller combatants.

Finally, I have heard from two separate people that Superior 
Miniatures will be re-releasing their Starships line.  Has 
anyone else heard this?

Planet                     Big Rock

You bulid it on the equator, because the center-of-mass needs to be at the
geostationary point.  (Not just geosynchronous!)   The idea is, you extend
the cable beyond the geostationary point, and anchor a large mass to the
top of the cable.  This mass is moving faster than orbital velocity, so it
pulls the whole darn thing taut.  The cable has to be strong enough to 
withstand this tension, which is quite substantial.  This has the side-
effect that if the cable is cut *at the ground*, the rest of it, now 
unanchored, will fly off into interplanetary space.  If you cut it higher
up, everything below the geostationary point will want to fall to earth,
and the cable is tens of thousands of kilometers long, the planet will
rotate under it....  Smaller planets are more feasible for construction 
of a beanstalk, since the problems of gravity/tension needed are lesser.
Some other neat tricks are possible also.

The big advantage of a beanstalk is that you don\'t have to haul up your
reaction fuel and other power needs every time you launch -- this is
provided by the beanstalk.  Even with CG, using a beanstalk may have its\'
advantages (equip the elevator cars with CG, powered from solar power
collected on the rock?) but it\'s more marginal.  In Traveller, delta-vee
is cheap, so there wouldn\'t be much incentive for the things.  And they
are a little hazardous if misused.

For more info, see:

  _Fountains of Paradise_, Arthur C. Clarke.  The construction of one
     for Earth.  (alternate Earth where Sri Lanka is on the equator).
  _Red Mars_, Kim Stanley Robinson.  At one point, one is built on Mars, 
     and there\'s some drama involving it.
  Larry Niven may have mentioned them in one of his recent anthologies.
  Traveller: 2300 had some as well, including an adventure, as I recall.

  During the last two days, I have been designing a TL A, 30-disp jump ship.
This \'mini scout\' was designed to be as affordable as possible, carry as
much cargo as possible, and -- since available weapons either demand too
much energy (lasers) or cost too much per shot ( .88 MCr per missile: too
much for a poor space gypsy\'s budjet) -- have some evasive capasity.

  My scout currently uses a 40 MW _fission_ powerplant, carries 172 mt of
cargo, and has a three-man crew.  Although fuel storage is rather small
(5.8 G-hours), I have some fuel bladders for the cargo bay, and a drop
tank, so it isn\'t too bad.

  MY PROBLEM:  I have a HEPlaR engine, capable of giving me 2 G\'s.  BUT,
my ship is only designed to take 1 G (due to problems with hull weight).

The FF&S rules are very specific... a ship can only go as fast as it is
designed to withstand.  But what if my favourate band of stellar bandits
put\'s the petal to the metal?  
 
How would a 1 G ship take 2 G\'s ... at a typical, straight-line course?    
                                ... at a nice, easy turn? 
                                ... at evasive maneuvers?

2.5 which is rounded to 3 against vehicles, and 50 against personel.
[see formulas in FF&S] Effective range is 576km.

How do I handle this one. Battledresses are built of the same material
as the vehicles, thus being unable to penetrate and do damage to the
person inside or...? If I go for the 50DP value it will penetrate a 30
armor point battledress and do a decent amount of damage. If I am going
to use the vehicle damage template I need a laser of at least 18Mj.
This gives a damage value of 11 against vehicles and a penetration of
1/3. The focal array here will weight 1.1304tons at TL-15.

I would like to get some advice on these matters, as I find it difficult
to design an effective portable weapon against heavy battledresses.

Just out of curiosity, what does the battledress look like? Is the from the
pictures from MegaTrav & the DGP illustrations or the new stuff that\'s in
the RCES equipment guide?

Lets say a cylinder 6mm in diameter thus 30mm in length.
The FF&S equation gives a mass  0.04*(3.14)*(3)^2=1.13 g/rd
this gives a density of (1.13 g)/(.85 cm^3) about 1.3 g/cm^3!
This just a little more than the density of WATER!
Please check my calculations and tell me that I am wrong!

The result is that you need ridiculously high muzzle velocities to get 
decent energy out of your weapon.  Even if you use the density of 
aluminum (2.7 g/cm^3) you get a round with double the mass of the FF&S 
rules.  This will allow the same energy with about 2/3 the muzzle velocity.
Go to even higher density material such as steel and youre 5-6 times the 
mass of the FF&S round.

>From now on im using 0.1 * (Pi) * r^2 to determine gauss round mass.  
Even this is on the light side.

I did something on that last year in a couple of postings on Traveller
Astrography I did for the TML (at about the same time I did the galactic

>From HIWG files at ghost.cc.missouri.edu.  There are probable errors
here:  Cicero can\'t be Aldebaran, because the subsector rimward of it

Besides the Solomani Rim:

"Official" Star Systems that haven\'t been located:

Spica          B1V.   Somewhere in Spica Sector, probably subsector C.
Acrux          B2IV.  Somewhere in Alpha Crucis Sector.
Denebola       A3V.   Somewhere in Alpha Crucis subsector I (Denebola).
Aldebaran      K5III. Somewhere in Aldebaran subsector B (Aldebaran).
Canopus        F0Ib.  Somewhere in Canopus sector.
Delta Cephei.  G2Ib.  Paranoia Press put this variable star in their
                      version of Beyond Sector.  Don\'t know if it\'s 
       still there.

Also, in the DGP sector files I found the following planet names, with the
star locations and spectral types appear wrong:

Beta Cygni-4 (3006 Ilelish)   (Possible right position, but *bad* spectrum)
Gamma Lupus-2 (2104 Ilelish)
Mizar-5 (1011 Old Expanses)

Unidentified Nearby Supergiants (DGP sector files):

Eakhoi       (2123 DkNebula) F8Ia      (Polaris?  Is a bit too close to Terra.)
Sardas       (0839 Mendan)   F0Ib M7D
?            (1530 EmptyQtr) M4Ia M4D

Interesting objects to watch for (my best guesses):

Regulus        B7V.  Probably somewhere in Aldebaran Sector, range 25pcs.
Betelgeuse     M2Ia. Probably in sector just rimward from RimReach).
zeta Ophiuchi  O9V   Lishun sector?  (At same approx. range as Antares)
gamma Velorum  WC7   Wolf-Rayet star, may be in Hiver space.  (Even rarer
                     than an 0-class star (200 in galaxy) -- could attract 
      Darrians and Church of the Stellar Divinity members.)
rho Ophiuchi Dark Cloud.  Collection of nebulae.  Probably in coreward
                     Trenchan Sector.  
      
Two open clusters should be in or near Solomani space: the Hyades (40 pcs.) 
and the Pleiades (120 pcs.), both with hundreds of stars contained in just
a few parsecs!  Both are near the Aldebaran line-of-sight from Terra. (See
a star chart.)


Hope this helps!

What is the heatsink effect of the stalk? It is sticking out into 
hard vacuum and out there night/day temperature is dependant on solar 
radiation. So would this cause a net increase or decrease in the 
planetary temperature? Decreases could certainly be useful in 
reducing global warming! As a reference consider the heat-sink below

Here\'s an idea for a weapon system to trash battledress:
At high TL it should be easy to design a propelled grenade/mini 
missile of about 25mm bore which will destroy battledress, a current 
HEDP grenade probably would. Note that 25mm is about 10ga, so stick 
these in an auto-shotgun. Further add solid-state guidance to increase the 
chance of hitting the target (note that a current 40mm grenade is 50% 
fuse - this would be relatively tiny). That ought to be quite 
effective. 

>>>>> Perhaps at close range, but remember that a battlesuit is effectivly
 a one man tank.  You\'ll need a weapon with anti-tank like capability.
 You could probably register arced fire hits at 1000m with this weapon
 but getting penetration is another matter.  You\'d succede in giving
 away your location and the battlesuit would hit your position with
 a nasty anti-personel device.  Better to take on a battlesuit with 
 weapons that can take down an AFV.  Something more akin to the TOW
 missile i\'d think.

 Now I know what you are thinking, "...but this is using HEDP ammo,
 that should do the trick."  Just remember that battle suit designers
 don\'t want schmuckie light infantry to be able to take out their multi
 million credit battlesuit with anthing less than a crewed support 
 weapon.  All kinds of ECM/early warning gear and countermeasures are 
 going to be mounted on the suit as well as composite layered armor part
 of which is going to be reactive armor that will blow a low yield 
 shaped charge shot.  Like this pesky shot gun cum. grenade launcher.

   The official fix is  0.02 * PI * r^3  (the mass should change in
proportion to the cube of the change in radius, if all other dimensions
remain in proportion).

Jo, take a look at FF&S again...  Personal Armor design rules are on pages
39-42, Book II Subsystems  There are couple of designs of battledresses
and other personal armor..

Straight-line: no problem.  Between the usual 2x safety factor built into
structural designs for "industrial" vehicles (aircraft are a lot lower, but
they\'re a lot more weight-critical than traveller spacecraft and can afford
to be more fragile) and such you should be able to take this easy.

Nice, Easy Turn: no problem, again.

Evasive Maneuvers: you start bending things.  To properly answer that would
require a dynamics analysis (determine the vehicles moment of inertia,
thrust, moment arm of the thrust, and find out how dynamic its
maneuvers really are).  Rough generalization: you are now going to start
bending and breaking structural members.

An impact of some sort, explosion etc. which caused lots of shock and 
vibration during one of these maneuvers would make it worse.
An impact during a snap evasion could cause catastrophic structural failure.

Lets say a cylinder 6mm in diameter thus 30mm in length.
The FF&S equation gives a mass  0.04*(3.14)*(3)^2=1.13 g/rd
this gives a density of (1.13 g)/(.85 cm^3) about 1.3 g/cm^3!
This just a little more than the density of WATER!
Please check my calculations and tell me that I am wrong!
 ----
you\'re right but see below
 ----
The result is that you need ridiculously high muzzle velocities to get
decent energy out of your weapon.  Even if you use the density of
aluminum (2.7 g/cm^3) you get a round with double the mass of the FF&S
rules.  This will allow the same energy with about 2/3 the muzzle velocity.
Go to even higher density material such as steel and youre 5-6 times the
mass of the FF&S round.

>From now on im using 0.1 * (Pi) * r^2 to determine gauss round mass.
Even this is on the light side.
 ----
Looks like GDW stuffed up again :-(
I present a derivation of a formula for the Mass of Gauss Rounds:
Assumptions: -the dimensions of the round can be approximated to the form 
given in FF&S.
             -the round is to be made of steel (which has good magnetic properties).
Frontal surface area of bullet=pi x r^2 mm^2 (r in mm)
Length of bullet=5xdiameter=10 x r mm (r in mm)
Volume of bullet=10 x r x pi x r^2 = 10 x pi x r^3 mm^3 (r in mm)
Density of steel= 8 mg / mm^3

Mass of bullet= 0.08 x pi x r^3 grams (r in mm)

The GDW formula followed the same derivation EXCEPT they always assumed a 
length of 5 mm!

For a crystal iron bullet use: mass=0.1 x pi x r^3 grams (r in mm) (use at TL 10-11)
For a superdense bullet use: mass=0.15 x pi x r^3 grams (r in mm) (use at TL 12+)

Hi All,

Just a quick question....

Has anyone come up with a method of generating frontier systems.
Typical attributes would include lower human population, greater
chance of aliens, and lower overall tech level. 

What about unexplored systems. So much of GDW\'s rules concern 
charted space. Should I just zero out the human population and 
selectively place a few alien worlds?

It seems these are all good candidates for World Tamer. Has anyone
heard what it will include? 

Sorry, I guess that was three quick questions...

TTFN

Glenn

pp190-192 in the Traveller: The New Era book is a set of World Building
Charts titled: Collapse Effects Determination which gives guidlines for 
blasting down sectors.  It is pretty vicious, but then again, so was
Virus.

By the time Virus was released, almost every system within Imperial 
Borders had been explored.  Any interstellar society that had contact
any of the Empire\'s neighbors, with the exception of the Zhodani and 
the Hivers are probably wasted as well.  Virus was not just for humaniti,
it did not distinguish between man and K\'Kree.  

>It seems these are all good candidates for World Tamer. Has anyone

According to the Ad for it in the back of Star Vikings: Personalities of the
Reformation Coalition, it will include two adventures, a boot strap campaign,
and a full colonization campaign, as well as rules for exploring, surveying,
animals and plants, dealing with natives (xeno/techno-phobs) and colonists.

If it were my game, she\'d lose hull integrity (ie cracks and atmosphere 
leakage. These would grow toward major hull fractures if she didn\'t slow
down. Then the major hull members would break up into large pieces headed
on her final vector. This process might take five minutes.

Same as above, but in more like 1 minute. You\'re shifting stress away from
vector orientations of strength.

>                                ... at evasive maneuvers?
Go right to the major break up part.

Double designed
G is kinda tough on a ship - note: that\'s double DESIGNED, not rated G.
Rating is probably lower.  I tend to design in a margin of error so ships
aren\'t casually destroyed by careless pilots...

I\'d suppose that if you were a kindly GM, you could offer this:

    Straight Easy Turn Evasive

Minor hull integrity loss 20% /30 sec 50%/30 sec Auto

Major hull integrity probs  20%/30 sec 50%/30 sec 85%/30 sec
and critical hit equivalents

Full Breakup   20%/30 sec 50%/30 sec 85%/30 sec

Each 30 seconds, roll a percentile die. If the roll is over the percent, 
fine. If not, take the damage. Next 30 secs, same damage is auto and roll 
for next level. Stopping accelleration stops further damage. (That\'s 
stopping accelleration, not cutting it back down to normal levels, until 
some damage control is done). You could even allow pilot SKILL (not 
attribute, SKILL) act as a negative mod (experience letting you know what 
will hurt the ship...)

On the whole, not a good idea. Intelligent engineers will install a throttle
governor limiting thrust to safe levels.

[to kill battledress]

I came upon the same idea yesterday. But I\'m using a 4cm TL-10 grenade
with a TL-10 ARL. This gives a HEAP penetration of 41C. Easily
penetrating a heavy battledress with 30 armorpoints }B)

[and]

We\'ve had a design for a backpack RAM grenade launcher for years. Computer
controlled, you can designate one target a round (which it then tracks) and then
launch up to 10 grenades simultaneously. Capacity varies by TL, from about 10 to
25 and so does computer augmentation and tracking ability. We find this nobbles
battledress real nice...

>>>>> Ok, you guys have come up with a great warheads to kill off 
 battledress, but who/what is going to deliver the warhead without
 being detected and killed first?  This is the "who gets to bell the 
 cat" paradox.  What is the guidance system for these weapons?  How do
 you intend to defeat the countermeasures of the suit?  What is the
 range of this weapon compared to battlesuit weaponry that could be
 used against you?

 Hello TML!
 
 Sorry we took so long to get hooked up, but the shift to the
 new TML took place during our annual convention season craziness,
 and I have only recently recovered.

 Joe (Re RAFM figs and battledress):
 > Just out of curiosity, what does the battledress look like?
 
 The RAFM figures depict the Coalition light battledress from
 the RCEG.
 
 BTW, I\'ll happily forward any consumer feedback regarding the
 RAFM figs to the manufacturer. Their next releases will be more
 starships (including an Aurora-class clipper) and the batch after
 that will be grunts for Striker II.

 Yes. That\'s why we changed it to 0.02*(Pi)*r/`3. However, go
 ahead and use your formula if you like the results better.

 Then you\'re SOL. : )
 
 If you insist on bending the rules, you must make up your own
 improvisations on the spot, so there is no official answer to the
 question. However, If _I_ were doing it for a personal campaign:
 
 > How would a 1 G ship take 2 G\'s ...at a typical, straight-

 I\'d say implement a minor damage result per G of excess at a
 random location (Engineering, Hold, Electrical, Quarters, etc.),
 each turn.
 
 > ... at a nice, easy turn?
 
 Two minors per G (or a major).
 
 > ... at evasive maneuvers?
 
 two majors per G
 
 This way you can firewall it and watch as various ship\'s
 systems start to smoke and spit sparks in true Hollywood fashion,
 culminating in the shutdown of your drive just as your powerplant
 explodes and the legend "To Be Continued..." appears on the
 bottom of the screen. : )

 To Those Looking for Battledress Killers:
 
 Several hand-carried weapons in the RCEG will do quite a number
 on Coalition heavy battledress. Check out page 99 of the RCEG for
 a weapon with a HEAP round very similar to the one described by
 T.Eldritch, albeit without the guidance features he suggested,
 and a pump action rather then automatic. HEAP RAM grenades, TL 6
 RIfle grenades, and the plasma bazooka will also do the job. I
 don\'t think its possible to design a man-portable laser that will
 drill battledress, but I haven\'t explored TL-16+ yet.

 Regarding Conventions
 
 On behalf of GDW, I\'d like to thank everybody from the TML who
 came up and introduced themselves, especially the lurkers, who I
 don\'t ordinarily hear from. It is good to meet in the flesh for
 once.
 
 A couple of things came up in the various seminars:
 
 -- A great number of people asked for our Email address, and
 one guy said (when he saw it): "People told me that mail to this
 address is ignored." Here\'s what I told him:
 
 I don\'t ignore Email. Sometimes I don\'t answer immediately
 because the answer is not always quick and easy. Sometimes I try
 to answer and the mail bounces (and I give up after three or four
 tries...I check to make sure that I typed the address right, but
 sometimes people\'s addresses change and they don\'t bother to tell
 me...this happens a lot around the end of the school year).
 Sometimes the node I work out of seems to eat messages (both
 incoming and outgoing) and I have no way of knowing whether the
 mail got through. Sometimes I lose the message. Occasionally, I
 will not answer because I don\'t think a reply is necessary
 (although the sender might). If you or anyone you know has sent
 GDW EMail and think you didn\'t get the answer you deserve, Email
 me again at
 
 GDW.SUPPORT@GENIE.GEIS.COM
 
 -- People were asking questions about various rumors they\'d
 heard (through the infobahn, at the hobby shop, and so on).
 
 I want to start using TML as a "Rumor Control Central" to get
 out the truth as quickly as possible. If you have heard a rumor
 about GDW or Traveller, please post it to the TML, and I\'ll tell
 you if there is any shred of truth to it. If you don\'t want to
 spam it to everyone on the TML, just Email it to me, and I\'ll get
 back to you privately. I am not interested in punishing anyone
 who said bad things about us, and I am not interested in starting
 any _flammposten_, I just want to get the truth out to as many
 people as possible. Rumors always seem to get mutated in the
 worst possible way, and they get crazier with each re-telling.
 
 =*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=
 
 Another Favor: could someone extract all the New MPGN TML
 digests (I need everything before Digest #17) and Email them to
 us? I\'d like to catch up on what\'s been going on, and answer any
 questions that may have come up.
 
 =*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=
 
 And, finally: I will not be subscribing to the X-boat version
 of TML (I have too much to read as it is, and only a limited
 about of time and memory), so I will not see anything posted
 there unless someone sends it to both lists. As one of the
 designers of the classic three black books system, and a major
 contributor to the background, I have a soft spot in my heart for
 the old game, and I always will, but I am also one of the main
 contributors to the New Era, and I have to devote all my energies
 to it. If anyone sees anything on the X-boat TML that they think
 I need to see, I\'d appreciate getting a copy. Likewise, if anyone
 thinks any of my material here will be of interest to them also,
 feel free to re-post it to the X-boat.

 Well, since what I heard has a lot to do with Traveller, I figured
I would post here to see if anyone else can confirm or deep six this
particular bit of gossip.

A friend of mine who just got back from GenCon informed me that
GDW was in serious financial difficulties. Considering the tone of the
Editorial of Challenge 74, I took this a little more seriously than I
would any other sort of rumour one might here. The fact that this friend
was a retailer who had spoken to several gaming insider also got me a
little worried. Could anyone comment on this?

But how do a battledress equiped soldier kill another battledress
equiped soldier without a crew operated weapon? The Plasma and Fusion
weapons got less firepower than a TL-10 4cm RAM grenade.

If you want something out of a PGMP or a FGMP it will weight something
like 80 to 90 kilos depending on pulse power, TL, and magazine capacity.

Well, they really don\'t look much like the RCES battledress, and they don\'t look like
the Imperial armor from older GDW and DGP stuff.  It also does not look like the armor 
in the DGP Solomani and Aslan book (which I really like).  Of all those listed, 
it probably most resembles the  RCES light battledress, but that is like saying
a daschund resembles a terrier.  It really does not seem to have any good
direct comparisons.  Sorry for the wishy-washy answer.

BTW - There is another miniature in the series; a grav bike and rider.  The Grav Bike 
looks about like you would expect.  One of my players thinks it look vaguely 
shark-like.  I did find the rider needed to be heavily trimmed and bent to
fit properly in the seat; in its original form it hovered above the seat in a peculiar 
fashion.  Other than that, the figure is unexciting but fairly good.  It uses the same base as the
RAFM starships.

Hi all,

I\'ve been lurking for awhile and I saw a posting from Loren K. Wiseman of 
GDW, Inc. and I couldn\'t fail to notice that he mentioned a STRIKER II 
for the RAFM miniatures. Is GDW going to reprint or re-produce STRIKER 
rules for use with TNE? Or is this just a rumor? Thanks in advance.

BTW, being relatively new to TNE, I was wondering if some kind soul could 
post the gaming supplements for TNE or if too long, maybe just mail me 
the list. Thanks in advance.

  Folks, I\'m embarrassed to admit it, which is probably why I never
  did under the _old_ TML, but I\'ve decided that a fresh start 
  means a fresh start all around.

  I\'m on a PC-based BBS whose news and mail gateway is fragged.

  What this means is that I can\'t depend on certain stuff to come 
  through as originally formatted, and I occasionally get long 
  messages as two or three separate messages.  This sucks.

  As far as the formatting goes:  If you\'re using TABS for 
  alignment, please set your editor to replace TABS with an 
  appropriate number of spaces, and set your right margin to stick 
  a hard line break in before about column 75 (65 is better).  I\'m 
  screaming at my SysOps to get this bovine fecal matter fixed, but 
  progress is ...  difficult ... at best.

  Much appreciated.

 magnitude heavier than stardard infantry weaponry.  Is this not
 the case if FF&S?

The Plasma and Fusion
weapons have less firepower than a TL-10 4cm RAM grenade.

>>>>> Hmm, I don\'t own FF&S or any TNE material.  As I recall there were
 a couple of F/PGMPs that could be used only by BD equiped troops, and 
 they were quite a bit more destructive than those that could be 
 carried and fired by a single light infantry soldier.  

 The potential energy stored in chemical bonds is much less than the
 ionization energy needed to strip electrons.  An accelerated bolt
 of plasma of low mass could equal an extremely larger mass of chemical
 explosives.  I\'d hazard a guess the focused plasma weapons should be
 *much* more destructive than chemical weapons.

If you want something out of a PGMP or a FGMP it will weight something
like 80 to 90 kilos depending on pulse power, TL, and magazine capacity.

>>>>> That many kilos is more than a single light infantry can handle alone.
 Is this energy weapon rated lower than the TL10 grenade launcher as
 far as penetration goes?

I am running a non-Virus campaign set on the farthest edge of human
explored space. I wanted to be able to tune the results to give it a 
lower population & TL. 

Blasting down the generated results is a good way of doing this. Up until
now, I\'ve used a quick and dirty program to dump hundreds of UPPs to a 
file and selected the lower population systems.

The sector I\'m developing is an effort to use the TNE rules in a 
non-post-Imperium campaign. I\'ve set up a few human societies that trace
their origins to a misjumped Terran colonization cruiser. A minor human
race and minor alien races are filling out the sector. While I won\'t 
rule out running a Virus adventure, it would probably be a one shot deal.
Maybe a misjumped virus-infected starship?

This looks good. I\'ve always hoped GDW would print more additions to TNE
that downplayed the Virus angle and centered on the rules system. I 
understand though that Virus is the plot device that separates TNE from 
every other SFRPG. Also, Virus is responsible for GDW reviving the 
Traveller game system. 

I think the rules systems have been very good. I like FF&S so much that
I would recommend it as a reference to any fan of science fiction in any 
form (novels, games, movies etc.). I hope World Tamer is as good.

    'body' => 'On the question of weaponry for battledress-equipped soldiers in TNE, it
has not yet been dealt with adequately. In CT/MT/Striker they used gauss
rifles with increasing numbers of plasma/fusion weapons. While the gauss
rifles could not penetrate, the grenade launcher generally attached
could.

However, the FFS design sequences make gauss weapons and plasma/fusion 
weapons impractical, at least IMHO. The power storage for gauss weapons
makes them too heavy, while high energy weapons now need ammunition,
wiping out the one advantage that they had over auto grenade launchers
(HEAP grenades always had better penetration). Personal lasers can be 
forgotten about in the new rules, at least as anti-battledress weapons.

GDW just translated the fusion/plasma guns to TNE stats, despite the
fact that they make even less sense than before (their high signature
makes for a short and interesting life for the firer).

As has been shown on the list before, the cheapest, easiest anti-
battledress weapon is a large anti-tank rifle. Chemical slugthrowers
seem to be the best weapons in general, as more technologically-
advanced weaponry is either equally effective, or in many cases
less effective, and typically for much higher cost. The fact that
this was done for all the high-tech weapons really irritates me, as
this is supposed to be a science-fiction game. Giving sample stats
for expensive high-tech weapons which are demonstrably inferior to
currently available weaponry is a waste of space.

Unless they give battledress point-defense systems, RAM grenades and
mini-missiles would seem to be good choices for battledress vs
battledress combat, with a LARGE rifle as backup. Indirect fire with
target designation and smart munitions would be the order of the day.
Of course the Virus provides a good excuse for keeping things simple,
and keeping the weapons dumber than their users. On a high-tech
unlimited battlefield, protective armour such as battledress will be 
necessary as otherwise the sensors will spot you(bang) or the gas/
radiation/bugs will take you out. (Imperial rules of war, what are 
they?). In limited conflicts, it may not be worth the expense, unless
your troops already have it.

So far GDW have not given us their post-TNE view of of battledress
combat. They are just a way of making PCs mostly invulnerable against 
backward indigenous natives, and plot-device Marines invulnerable to
lightly-equipped unruly PCs. Striker II should give us a clearer 
picture of battledress vs battledress combat as GDW see it, assuming 
they actually think about it seriously (not a save assumption).

Yes, but remember that a battledress only doubles the strenght, and
average strength of a soldier is 7 or 8. With a base STR of 8 and CON of
7 gives a lifting capability of 45Kg. With a battledress it is 66Kg.

A 3Mj Fusiongun at TL 15 weight about 12 to 18 Kg unloaded. The
magazine will almost tripple this with 4 or 5 shots. You get more ammo
capability if the weapon is integral, but not much. somewhere about 30
shots in total. Far too few for an engagement. And you wont be able to
carry along any reloads.

Yes, but a Heavy battledress can easily get more armorpoints than the
penetration rating of the weapon....

Sorry you are wrong, a 4cm ARL loaded weights only a fraction of the
F/PGMP of same penetration rating.

While it was never explicity stated, various accounts of Imperial history (like
the overview in the old Library Data book and comments in GDW\'s Solomani 
sourcebook) led me to think that the Syleans were just a cultural group, which 
was heavilty Solomani in background.  This was supposed to be why the 3rd 
Imperium had such a pro-Solomani bias until the Imperial family married into 
Vilani megacorp money and influence, shortly before the Solomani Rim War.  
Maybe you need another list of hybrid human cultures in the Imperium.  This 
would include the Antareans, the Julian Protectorate, the people of Ilelish, the
Sword Worlders, etc.  None are distinct biological races or subspecies, but
all are culturally distinct from "mainstream" Imperial life.

On the other hand, I could be mistaken about the Syleans, but I don\'t think 
so.  If I am, I will happily shut up now.

O.K., here it is... 
     the smallest, cheapest jump trader in HISTORY! (so far..)

First, my Hot Rod - the one with a two-G drive on a one-G body.  It\'s
meant to be the local equivalent of a cheap, fast and dirty smuggler.

It\'s followed by the standard trader - with LOTS of cargo room, over 40%
of the ship!  Compare with your typical TNE \'trader\', with about 25% of
the ship given to cargo.

Finally, the most profitable of all - the in-system smuggler/trader! 
Without the cost of jump fuel to handle, you too can become a millionare  
with the flick of the hand and a roar of the engines!

And not only do these babies are available at the lowest prices around
(can YOU find a more affordable jump ship, right off the construction
docks?),
but they come with a whole SUITE of accessories, to fit any need!

    'from' => 'Steve Charlton/Avalon Software Inc',
    'body' => 'It seems apparent that I am not the only one running 
into Battledress angst.  If you have PCs or NPCs in 
battledress, they are relatively invulnerable to most 
weapons.  There are some weapons that can affect them,
but these are mostly either lower-tech missile 
launchers or excessively heavy and expensive 
plasma/fusion weapons.  

It seems likely to me that the Imperium probably would
not blow lots of credits on a fusion weapon if a grenade 
launcher gave equal effectivity against 
similarly-armored enemy forces.  On the other hand, I 
would not expect to see a squad of TL15 Marines pile 
out of an APC and load up their TL10 ACRs, either.

I have some problems with the relative invulnerability 
of Battledress, but part of this comes from the lack of 
knowledge about Imperial (or anyone\'s) doctrine on 
battledress employment and tactics.  Since my PCs 
occaisionally run into high-tech forces, I have tried to 
think out a rational set of guidelines for battledress 
battle tactics.  Here are three different versions;  I tend
to use version 1, but it still makes battledress a very 
game-imbalancing item.

1.  An integral auto grenade launcher/laser designator.  
The grenades would home in on designated targets.  
This would take up much of the extra carrying capacity 
from the enhanced strength, but would serve to give a 
Marine a decent chance against battledress.  The 
Marine could then carry a normal weapon loadout (a 
Gauss Rifle or more rarely a Fusion Gun) to blow away 
the unarmored infantry or light armored vehicles that 
might crop up.  This high volume of personal-level 
Marine firepower would make it virtually impossible for
a low-tech force to even stand up against an Imperial 
force, much less inflict casualties on the Marines.  The 
only drawback is the high volume of ammo resupply 
required for such a battle, but it would be more cost 
effective.

2.  Melee weapons made out of super-strong alloys.  The
combination of the Marine\'s enhanced strength and the 
strength of the weapon would give the weapon a decent 
penetration rating, but the combatants would need to 
close before fighting.  This would lead to tactics similar 
to those seen in the late Middle Ages; the armies would 
approach each other, attempting to weaken each other\'s
ranks with heavy weapons (missile and energy weapons) 
until the two forces bumped and became embrioled in a 
melee.  The problem here would be low-tech (TL7 - 
TL10) forces would have to be fought in the same fashion, 
and closing with them would give a higher potential for 
Marine casualties than would be worthwhile for such a 
low-tech objective.  Of course, once the Marines closed 
in, the low-tech troops would be annihilated.  Very cost 
effective, but somewhat silly.  I have trouble with using a
saber in a TL15 battle.

3.  Marines armed largely with Plasma/Fusion weapons. 
These weapons would be capable of taking out regular 
troops, battledress troops and even vehicles.  This is the
option GDW has historically used, but the TNE prices 
and weapons stats make this option rather cost 
ineffective.

There are certainly other options.  I still need to sit 
down with FFS and design the equipment for option 1.  
The problem with all of these options is play balance; a 
battldress unit is basically invulnerable to everything 
except heavy support weapons and other battledress 
units.  Maybe this makes sense from a technical 
standpoint, but it sure can make any combat-oriented 
game sessions brief and unchallenging.  My PCs don\'t 
have any battledress, but TL 14 heavy combat armor is 
just as bad.  I am placed in a position where I can\'t 
threatend the PCs with injuries; I can kill them or fail 
to hit them at all, but nothing in between.

Any ideas, suggestions or comments would be most
welcome.

well I\'m not sure we\'re up to former capacity on the TML quite yet, but I 
thought I\'d throw out a possibility if people are interested. I\'m quite
interested in running a double-blind Battle Rider or Brilliant Lances
game or three over Email.

Now I had some ideas along these lines. I thought I could provide either 
detailed instructions over email (straight text), or I can provide GIF 
files on a turn-by-turn basis, with instructions coming into me over Email.

I haven\'t a clue how it might work, but I thought I\'d give it a try. Minimum
turnover for a game turn would be a work week, but I\'m hoping to be able
to complete full turns in one day and really "play" it at a reasonable
speed (over Email anyway).

So... any interested takers?

Errata from GDW?
 ----
Tariq:

 Yes. That\'s why we changed it to 0.02*(Pi)*r/`3. However, go
 ahead and use your formula if you like the results better.
 ----
Lets get this straight. Someone at GDW discovered that they had stuffed up 
their gauss round ammo formula and came up with a fix. Then they proceeded 
to NOT tell anybody about it! If they did tell someone then I would like to 
know how they decide who gets to know these things. I don\'t think I\'ve just 
"missed" it as I own copies of all TNE products currently released except 
for Star Vikings (which has only just appeared over here) and am a member of 
HIWG, TML and Xboat.
 ----
There has been much discussion on the efficacy of H.E.weapons recently so I 
include my modifications to the H.E.weapon design rules that I posted a 
while ago that some people may have missed:

High Energy weapons: Arrgh where do I start! Their disadvantages include:
 -high price
 -short range
 -low penetration
 -heavy
 -high recoil
 -heavy ammo
 -requires high tech maintenance
in short, only a complete moron would use them as they are.

Some mods to make them more viable:
IPR is now calculated from pulse MJ

IPR=MJ^-3  ( /2 at long, /10 at extreme )

Range is calculated using a formula derived from that I worked out for Mass 
Drivers.

Short range (m) = 1/k x ln ( vkt + 1 )
v= 8000 for plasma, 12000 for fusion
t=0.3
k=4 x (10^-3) x MJ^-(2/3)
For small arms use the shorter of either the above or that of an equivalent 
small arms laser.

Fusion guns derive extra energy from the fusion reaction.
Multiply the MJ rating of the fusion gun ammo by 2.25 for the purposes of 
damage, IPR and range.

Ammo is very heavy which means that small arms can only carry a few shots, 
also note that the amount of propellent required to fire a ETC gun with a 
muzzle velocity of say 12 MJ is about a quarter of the mass of a 12 MJ PPC 
Cartridge!
Ammo now has a mass and volume = 0.2 x EPG equivalent mass and volume.

Example ratings:

0.75 MJ Plasma Gun
Dam=10 PR=1,2,11 Pen=10,10,5,1 Range=514m

2 MJ Plasma Gun
Dam=16 PR=1,2,8 Pen=16,16,8,2 Range=763m

12 MJ Plasma Gun
Dam=39 PR=1/2,1,4 Pen=78,78,39,10 Range=1349m

125 MJ Fusion Gun (x2.25=281.25 MJ)
Dam=192 PR=1/7,1/3,2 Pen=1344,1344,576,96 Range=3093m

Note that the above values are closer to the 2300AD concept of a H.E. 
Weapon.

I hope the above will be of some use to people struggling to reconcile the 
traditional concept of H.E. weapons with the complete duds presented in TNE.

               You will find it impossible to design a man-portable laser
that
          will penetrate heavy battledress, and that is the intention of
          the rules. See the LSW in the RCEG.

               1 is the penetration _rating_ not the penetration _value_,
          theus the laser could penetrate an AV of 2 and still  have 1
          point of damage value remaining. This remainind DV is then
          converted into personnel damage dice at 20 per DV.
               Your calculations regarding the 18 Mj laser are correct.

           If you have read the Challenge 74 editorial, you know that in
          it Frank admitted that GDW has experienced some tough going in
          the last few weeks, but that we are _not_ alone in this. All
          companies (large and small) are being hit hard by recent events,
          and rumors of firings and lay-offs are rampant throughout the

           I\'d like to know what "insiders" he talked to. There is no one
          at GDW who is more "inside" than I am. I\'m on the board of
          directors, I am a stockholder, and I am a corporate officer. I
          have been with GDW since day one, and I will do whatever I have
          to do to ensure that the company stays in business.
           Any questions?

           You use the total cubic meters of the ship, regardless of how
          much surface area is taken up. For a 1,400 cubic meter ship,
          scoops would cost 0.000075*1400 = MCr0.105. For a 5,600 cubic
          meter ship, scoops would cost 5600*0.000075 = MCr0.42

           From Dave Nilsen, in response to a number of queries:
           I\'d like to take a few moments to explain some things so we can
          avoid some needless heartburn and speculation. This involves the
          nature of copyrights, letters of permission, and, that awful s-
          word: suing.
           I hope that these issues are already pretty clear to most
          people who will read this, and maybe this letter is unnecessary,
          but it never hurts to communicate.
           The same way that Stephen King gets paid when someone makes a
          movie of one of his books, or Elton John gets paid when someone
          plays one of his records, we need to get paid for what we do. If
          musicians had to write songs and do concerts for free, or authors or game
           companies had to spend months writing books for free, how could
           we expect there to be any music or books or games?
           Companies like GDW do not own physical objects like factories
          or gold mines or fleets of aircraft, things that have inherent
          value just sitting still. All that we own are our capacity to
          produce new ideas and games, and our copyrights on the ideas and
          games that we have already produced. Without copyrights, we would
          be working for free, and then how could we pay our rent, our
          utilities, our printers, our color separators, and, of course,
          our employees.
           The problem with copyrights is that their owners must actively
          protect them if they are not to lose them. The law is pretty
          clear that failure to protect copyrights and trademarks is
          tantamount to voluntarily giving them up. Usually this involves
          trusting other people to not attempt to infringe on them, and
          nicely asking them not to if they try. However, if someone goes
          ahead and infringes on your copyright anyway, the only thing that
          you can do to protect it is to sue.
           GDW is not now or ever looking to sue anyone, but our policy,
          and the policy of any company, _has_ to be that if we are forced
          to protect our copyrights, we will do so by the only available
          means, which is suing. Reserving the right to be able to defend
          yourself if required is hardly a threatening or foreboding
          posture.
           Copyright law is becoming increasingly complicated by the
          electronic revolution. Although GEnie for example, has strict
          protocols to protect copyrights, other areas of the "information
          highway" are not necessarily safe. We cannot afford to lose our
          ability to make a living doing what we do by not being careful,
          especially when a project looks like it takes our most valuable
          material and charges straight into the thickest part of the
          hedge, so to speak [LKW: A recent proposal involved someone
          wanting our permission to OCR some of our products and upload
          them to BBSs and FTP sites world-wide...we said we could not
          possibly condone or permit such a large-scale violation of our
          copyrights].
           As far as letters of permission are concerned, we are not
          refusing to give out any more, but we can hardly grant letters of
          permission to do things that may lose us our copyrights. That
          wouldn\'t make any sense at all.

4mm Zhodani Gauss Rifle
Unlike Imperial railguns that shoot light finned darts, Zhodani gauss
rifle is based on coil-gun principle, in which a row of electro-magnets
alternatively attract and repel a magnetized projectile. Zhodani gauss
projectile is spin-stabilized steel bullet.

TL: 14
Ammo: 4x20mm/36
Muzzle energy: 12960 joules (Tranq: 7776 joules), Required Power 20736 joules
Weapon length: 69.6 cm
Weapon weight: 3.073 kg empty, with no magazine
        4.801 kg with full 20 round magazine
        6.093 kg with full 35 round magazine
Weapon Price: 881.3 Cr
Magazine Weight: 20-round magazine: 1.688 kg empty, 1.728 kg loaded
   35-round magazine: 2.950 kg empty, 3.020 kg loaded
Magazine Price: Cr4 (20 round) Cr6 (35 round)
Ammunition Price: Cr0.04 (Bullet), Cr0.08 (Tranq), Cr0.12 (APHE, HEAP)
Ammunition Weight: 2 grams per round (density 8 steel)
Features: Gyroscopic compensation. Two-stage trigger mechanism (short pull
fires single shots, deep pull fires full-automatic). Grip safety. Carrying
handle has a scope rail that can mount optical or electronic sight. Barrel
has a mounting rail that accepts large selection of secondary weapons.

4x20mm Tranq SA/5 -1* Nil 4 20/35 1/3 30 (30

Tinkering: APHE round is an exploding bullet with short delay. It strikes a
target like a normal bullet with normal penetration, and explodes inside the
target. This prevents overpenetration and ricochets.
Explosion energy is calculated as HE extra energy, but is not added to muzzle
energy. APHE extra damage is calculated from explosion energy only, and it
affects the target only if the bullet penetrated his armor.
In this case, APHE damage is (SQRT(( 4[mm] + 14[TL] - 7 )^3))/15 = 2.43 => 2.
APHE rounds have same range and price as HEAP rounds.

Note: In our home campaign, this gauss rifle is standard Zhodani military
weapon that is issued to every trooper as their first weapon. It is designed
to be \'soldierproof rifle\', having no moving parts or selector switches.

2cm Low-Velocity Automatic Grenade Launcher

This weapon is a cross between grenade launcher and SMG. Short and easy to
handle, it can be used against armored infantry and light vehicles. The main
problem with this weapon is its bulky ammo.
To protect the firer from own fragments, the grenades have spin-based safety
that arms the impact fuse when the grenade has flown 10m. Additionally, to
eliminate possible duds, the grenades have a secondary pyrotechnical fuse
that detonates the grenade 5.4 seconds after firing.
Only HEAP round is used because HE round would have the same fragmentation
effects but lacks the penetration ability of HEAP.

TL: 10
Ammo: 2cm low-velocity propelled grenades
Muzzle Energy: 169 joules
Weapon Length: 41 cm
Weapon Weight: 3.1 kg empty, with no magazine
        4.09 kg with full 15 round magazine (straight box)
        5.08 kg with full 30 round magazine (drum)
Weapon Price: 660 Cr
Magazine Weigth: 15-round box magazine: 0.09 kg empty, 0.99 kg loaded
   30-round drum magazine: 0.18 kg empty, 1.98 kg loaded
Magazine Price: Cr1 (15 round box), Cr2 (30 round drum)
Grenade Price: Cr0.9 (HEAP)
Grenade Weight: 60 grams each
Features: Two-stage trigger mechanism (short pull fires single shots,
deep pull fires full-automatic). Grip safety. Optional laser sight.

Note: FFS states that shoulder-fired grenade launchers must have rifle-like
stocks. However, there are no physical reasons why GLs could not be build
in bullpup configuration, like REA 40mm GL. In addition to that, full-
automatic GLs can be magazine-fed, like the new H&K 40mm Grenade MG.

Tinkering: As this weapon is designed to have self-loading selective-fire
action, the price was calculated with action multiplier 250. The bullpup
configuration reduces the Short range to 90m, but does not affect IRF.
The volume of a 2cm grenade is 12cc, so if we assume that the grenade has
slightly rounded or conical point, the grenade would be about 4cm long.

I bought TNE delux boxed set, and the new formula is in my version of
FF&S. There are some errata for FF&S in the little booklet provided
with the boxed set, but the gauss round weight is not one of these.

    'body' => 'Earlier in the year there was a thread on the TML regarding the
definition of a Feudal Technocracy (Government Type 5) in
Traveller. This is a summary of the conclusions of the "Feudal
Technocracy Mailing List", which was formed when the discussion
went to private E-Mail.

This all originated in the beginning of May as a spin-off from a 
discussion between David Johnson and Hans Rancke about the Sword
Worlds. <David Johnson  - djohnson@geds01.jsc.nasa.gov>
        <Hans Rancke - rancke@diku.dk>
(David is no longer available at the address above). 
 
It became clear that different people had very different ideas about
what was and was not a Feudal Technocracy. Hans favoured emphasising
the feudal aspect while David emphasised the technocratic aspect,
using the term \'practise of technology\'. He approximately defined
this as requiring industrial activity in all possible areas for a certain
TL, producing sufficient surplus resources to support research, 
development, production and operation and support the expansion of the 
economy and stated that he regarged this as the prime requirement of
a technocracy.

However, Bill White has calculated that the average FT in the Imperium
has a population in the 100,000\'s, insufficient to support the broad
spread of industry David requires by the above definition( David 
believes a minimum population of the order of millions is required).

Also, a number of people (including me) had expressed the preference
that \'critical technology\' governments, who govern by virtue of control
of some critical technology, be possibly describable as Feudal
Technocracies. This type of society is possible at the lower population
levels at which FT\'s commonly occur in the Imperium.

Given these arguments David made the following comment:     
"Maybe we have to accept that, in Traveller terms, there is
no distinction between feudal technocracy, technocratic oligarchy,
technocratic feudalism, or anything else that might be considered in
any way `feudal\' or `technocratic\' since neither of these terms
exist in any of the other government codes." Any such government
could be described with a government code of 5. While David dislikes
the vagueness of the resulting government type, it does embrace all
of the proposed examples of FT\'s, including his own. This was the
compromise conclusion that we reached,

Hello folks. Looks like TML is up to its old capacity. I just printed 
out TML 24 
and it came to 14 pages of A4 ...

Alvin Plummer on Character and Animal Generation:
>   A) Life Paths for PC\'s and NPC\'s?
Seconded ... The thing I like least about the TNE rules is the 
character generation rules. On the other hand I do understand, and am 
beginning to come to terms with, the reasons they were designed that 
way. How about a supplement which provided a structure based on classic 
traveller character generation to generate d20 based characters? This 
would bring a few more people over to TNE, especially the referees who 
tend to buy these supplements, and there is a precedent for a character 
generation supplement in the shape of the Dark Conspiracy (TM) PC 
Booster Kit.
>   B) A way to generate quirks, neurosises and insanities, to \'flesh 
out\' characters?
Um, not so sure. You end up so that *everyone* is neurotic. The worst 
part of the TNE generation system is that bloody playing card system 
which makes everyone monomaniacal. Far better to have a series of 
vector based characteristics along the lines proposed way back in White 
Dwarf, so that you have scalar values for loyalty, ambition, etc. These 
can then be weighted for alien generation. Another good thing is that 
when you adapt the system to a computer game you have a starting point 
for giving the NPCs a degree of spontenaity.
>   C) A _good_ animal generator: i.e animals with shapes, forms, 
habits and interesting 
>  behaviour patterns?  How about a way to generate an ecosystem, in 
some detail?
I like the classic trav animal generation system, but this would be 
nice. What I would really like is a system for generating alien minor 
races. At the moment if I need it I use GURPS Uplift, but this isn\'t 
complete and only generates protosentients.

Another good idea.

But not WoTC, I think. Have you looked at working with them in the same 
way White Wolf have? Playing around with Jyhad piqued my interest in 
the Vampyre game. I\'d be interested to see a similar game with a 
Traveller feel. 

> (some stuff on World Tamer) This is a pretty good summary of what WTH 
will contain. 
Will the World Tamer stuff allow me to generate systems outside the 
former Imperium? In other words can I use it for "Grand Explorations" 
type campaigns?

Ted7\'s alien list:
- material from Paranoia and Judges Guild is non-canonical. Judges 
Guild totally so, Paranoia maybe less so, as I\'m under the impression 
some rework was going on by the individuals involved.
- the Ithklur homeworld is Tryylin/Extolian H (Alien module 7). The 
other Hiver client races mentioned in module 7 are the Gurvin 
(Ofilaq/Folgore A) and the Za\'tachk (Loza\'tch/Wrenton K). 
- Geonee homeworld is Shiwonee/Massilia J (Shiwonee 1430). This is in 
TD11.
- Suerrat homeworld is somewhere in Illelish. Not sure where this is 
written down.

For those without module 7:
- the Gurvin are derived from hexapodal omnivore/hunter stock, about 
1.75 meters tall, stand upright on 2 legs. The middle set of limbs can 
also be used as legs. The female of the species is a lot more 
intelligent - the males rarely leave the Gurvin settlements, but the 
females are found throughout Hiver space, as merchants and business 
executives, and slightly less commonly as explorers. They are obsessed 
with money. Also, most of the place names in the Hive Federation are 
derived from the Gurvin language, which provides an intermediate point 
of translation between phonetic languages such as Galanglic and purely 
ideographic languages such as those of the Hive.
- the Za\'tachk are quadripedal omnivore/gatherers. There are 3 sexes. 
They are similar in character to the Hivers, albeit perhaps more 
conservative. They tend to be found in administrative roles.

Some others you didn\'t mention:
Tapazmal: Dlaekan/Reft P (Moibin 3134): minor human race geneered by 
the Ancients for a low birth rate, and raided by the Loeskalth before 
annexation by the First Imperium. (TD20)
Floriani: Floria/Trojan Reach E (Yggdrasil 0213): minor human race made 
up of 2 castes, basically brain (the Barnai) and brawn (the Feskals), 
which cannot interbreed. Basically another Ancient attempt at 
geneering. The Florian League forms its own state outside Imperial 
borders. Whether it falls under the protection of the Regency I dunno 
(TD20).
Ojehshodu: Neghu Oug/Corridor D (The Narrows 2804): minor nonhuman race 
of large aquatic mammals. Share their homeworld with the Vargr. Not to 
be confused with the controversial Ojehsimpson (TD18)
Xapoqi: Xapoqoz/Corridor P (Sashrakusha 3131): minor nonhuman race of 
near plants. (TD 18).
Huosha: Iraisafeie/Ealiyasiyw J (Tohai 1527): minor nonhuman race. 
xenophobic, dangerous. Looks like a possibility for Aliens.
Salika: Garden/Reft I (Alone 0435): minor nonhuman race.Vaguely 
humanoid. Abandoned their homeworld in generation ships when their sun 
went through a hot phase (TD 19 & 20)
Shi\'awei: Chaosheo/Deneb I (Star Lane 0130). Bulky aquatic creatures, 
bullet shaped with 4 evenly spaced arms (TD19).
Brinn: Kateri/Corridor O (Sinta 2238): minor nonhuman race descended 
from carnivore/killer stock. 10 limbed, look like a cross between a 
crab and a spider. 4 sexes. Methane breathing. Belligerent and 
anti-humaniti. Occupy 6 worlds in the Corridor sector (TD 12).

Now, Mr. Wiseman:

My question was of more technical, legal nature than the note from Mr. Nilsen

Here is an issue that\'s been really bugging me since I first began
playing Traveller (Classic) quite some time ago.  I found several
remedies for the issue myself, but additional insight would be very
much appreciated.

Where did the plethora of races from Terra go?  Assuming, of course,
that the Solomani are our descendants, and that in all likelihood the
Vilani and other human minor races COULD have been taken as a
sample population from a variety of specific races, i.e. caucasian, asian,
oriental, etc. (Please forgive my anthropological misapprehensions, I am
a mere politician-in-the-making.)  I find the possibility that we all become
a single, homogeneous race VERY, VERY UNLIKELY...  At least here
in the U.S.A., our racial relations are, at best, strained.  (I am married to
a Saudi-born Pakistani woman, and we are one of very few such cross-
cultural marriages that we know of.)  The Solomani achieved jump-1 at
about 2087 A.D., and given that we (humans) haven\'t homogenized within
the last couple thousand years, and some minor things like the "laws" of
genetics, the probability that it would happen in the next century alone
are slim-to-none.

The most like chain of events following the discovery of jump drive tech.
would be that each and every "minority"/splinter-group could run off and
form their own "utopia" where nobody else could bother/molest/"descr-
iminate against" them...  That would make up for a large number of
worlds that are very disparate in culture, religion, language, etc.  Hmmm.
It would seem, however, that every human in the Traveller universe is
caucasian, and cultural spice is added by the use of alien cultures.  Why?
We have so much spice available here within our own "sphere".

In MY TNE campaign, the Balduri are cast as being descended primarily
from black terran stock, and the Luhtalans from mixed terran stock.  (Hope
I didn\'t miss any references to minor human races in TNE products for
RC member worlds, because I already have cultural derivations for each
from good ole Terra, with Vilani elements liberally added.)

In the thirty-five or so centuries that pass after the Solomani enter the
interstellar club, I still find it difficult to presume homogeneity...  With all
the "space" out there (no pun intended), it would merely allow a greater
latitude for diversity and cultural/racial isolationism, particularly on worlds
"relatively" close to Terra, in a relative backwater (such as Old Expanses
Sector)...  Generally, genetic/cultural populations homogenize only under
pressure, i.e. nowhere else to go.  Asking all my in-laws about whether
they\'d prefer their own independent colony-world to pursue their culture
on (after I got past the language barrier) produced a resounding YES!
answer.  By the way, all my in-laws are Pakistani, but all my Arab friends
agreed with them, in principle.  (FYI, I\'m Scotch-Irish.)

I plan to "inflict" on my players, a world or two with cultures descended
from fundamentalist Islamic societies...  Imagine the fits it would give
"caucasian" PCs (not politically correct, necessarily, but Player Char-
acters) trying to accomplish a deep cover "Moonshadow" mission on
a world populated by the descendents of an Ethiopian muslim colony!
(Hint:  carotene supplements and tanning beds won\'t do it!)  Plus, my
players and I feel it adds a certain amount of "plausability" to the game.

I can understand the rationale behind GDW leaving something of this
nature entirely out of their mainstream products, due to the STUPID
Politically Correct (tm) society we live in.  But dare to stand up to the
nonsense!  It\'s okay to be wierd, like ME!

I guess it\'s possible that the Traveller universe is one in which there
were never any races on Terra besides the "white" ones...

Weapon jamming
----
As I have seen lots of action moves and have seved in army I have noticed
that automatic weapons jam now and then, but there is no fixed method for it.
So I propose this kind of method: As a roll of 17-20 is always miss it leaves
4 numbers to some other use (see below).
Roll
17     miss
18     miss
19     miss/jam if Burst
20     jam

In my experience slug throwers jam more easily when firin in full auto mode.
Chart above can be modified if weapon is extremely reliable or unreliable/
dirty.

Support fire
----
Like weapon jamming method, this is also an addition to normal rules.
Idea which lead to this chart is that I believe that full auto fire is 
extremely deadly in narrow corridors and when assaulting buildings. My
starting
point was maximum of 10 meters of danger zone in burst fire and Impossible
difficulty. Diameter in the chart means diameter of the corridor or WELL
defined area like a door or window.
          Version 1      Version 2
Diameter  Difficulty     Difficulty
   1*      Average        Difficult
   2*      Difficult      Formidable
  3-4      Formidable     Impossible
  5-10     Impossible     Impossible

As you can see my first version is more deadly than the second one. I haven\'t
used either of the versions but I think that second version is more playable,
what do you think?

*  I have thought that diameters of 1 and 2 should be used only when firer is
   actually INSIDE the corridor or very near it.

Under these rules how many bullets do you think will hit one opponent in the
corridor before he/she/it collapses. This question is important when lots of
enemies is coming through in the field of fire.

So that\'s it for this time.

I\'m sure some of you have already thought about that. I\'d like to hear what

I admit that this stuff could be obselete when adventuring in the Wilds but
don\'t you think it could give an edge to PCs when they hit a place where is
relic data nets or Virus infested machinery. There could be even combat
deckers who are responsible for EW in planetary raids, take your pick and

Trade and Commerce
----
According to rulebook there is no common RC credit, but people have to change
currency. I have understood that it has to be done when buying fuel etc. but
what about when buying and selling cargo, I mean is it already taken care of
in the charts?

Jump Fuel
----
I made a few changes to the old Scout ship, I planted new TL12 J3 jump drive
and changed fuel capacity a bit. At the process I noticed that with manuver
fuel that ship could jump at least 3 times (maybe 4 times), is it possible
to turn the flow of fuel from maneuver fuel tanks to jump drive. I think it
should, because in the old Scout ship\'s fuel listing it saids that I could
use
jump fuel for maneuver drives, am I right?

Sensors
----
I saw the Patriot Games again on video, and it occured to me that radar
surveillance like that would be great benefit to Star Vikings when combatting
low TL planets (for a reason or other). For those who haven\'t seen the film
there is an episode in which Jack Ryan and (other) people in CIA watch via
satellite as special forces men eliminate terrorist camp. So I\'d like to
know what kind of sensors are needed and from what distanse they can be used
to watch human sized beings. Primarily I thought to use this kind of sensors
aboard starships where officers could surveillance and direct planetside
troopers.

not die instantly, as the virus reacted to carbon cyberspace, and overloaded
the human neural network with say a volt, melted the neural jack etc etc ...
And if you did suvive, you might be the virus, and that brings interesting
questions like can a virus be human ?

Nice idea, and good for "safe" computer systems, but with a virus in there ?
Well I\'ll just say you won\'t see my computer specialist try it.

Hi All,

I just picked up Challenge 75 and read the editorial with interest. 
I\'ve been having difficulty obtaining TNE related items (miniatures,
Battle Rider, and others). All of the TNE stuff I\'ve bought has 
been through special order. Based on this editorial, GDW hasn\'t 
benefited from my purchases.

  But if it isn\'t on the shelf (or you don\'t have a locall hobby

  can\'t get a catalog/ordering instructions put into the Library.

YES! My liberation is at hand!

Actually, I\'ve been very pleased with GDW\'s phone order approach
for classic traveller stuff. I look forward to placing my future
special orders direct.

Hi there,

I am intersted in information about how GDW handles software
copyright requests.  Is writing a utility to help design vehicles
using FF&S rules as a spreadsheet and then giving it away to whoever

I directly asked GDW this question and the reply was that you are not
allowed to distribute any GDW based materials without express
permission from GDW.  They have to take this stance in order to keep
their copyright.

Hmm. It is possible.  Let me mention an issue though...

The old TML carefully observed incoming mail messages for lines starting
with "--", and inserted a "- " in front of these lines so that messages
were always delimited by lines beginning with "--".  This was based on
the RFC-compliant mail forward program shipped in the MH mail package.

Example: if the following message:

 To: foobar
 From: baz

 Body
 --
 Signature

Were to be included in another message, it would look like:

 To: forward-recipient
 From: forwarded

 -- Forwarded message follows

 To: foobar
 From: baz

 Body
 - --
 Signature

 -- End of forwarded messages

Unfortunately, listproc doesn\'t mung lines beginning with "--". This
means that MH\'s burst command doesn\'t work, and neither does the "burst"
program I\'ve written. I could make my "burst" program more clever, if I
decide to work on it (no promises, Ted :-).

Something you may consider is recieving each mail message as it gets
sent to the Traveller list (instant delivery), instead of in a daily
digest. This can be done by sending the message "set mail ack" to
listproc@mpgn.com. If you decide you don\'t like the frequent new mail,
you can go back to the default digest delivery by sending "set mail
digest".

Do the rest of you guys reckon the power armour strength rules 
are a bit silly too? If you double the strength of a weedy 
character that only makes them average - how then can the 
support weapon business be justified? If a control system were 
designed correctly the suit would be adjusted/calibrated to the 
user and be able to exert it\'s own maximum strength. Would a 
fixed strength value or an addition to the users strength be a 
bit more sensible?

>>>>> I put my vote in for a fixed strength value.  For battlefield use
 this would be the optimal condition.  Now every soldier on the
 battlefield can jump, carry, move his/her maximum rate.  This also
 gives the battlefield commander a much easier time knowing his/her
 own troops capabilities.  Just ask Robert A. Heinlein !!

Listproc follows RFC1153, "Digest Message Format".  I won\'t go into
the format here, since it\'s outside the scope of this list.  It\'s a
simple format and wouldn\'t be hard to write an exploder for it.

Internet RFC\'s can be found at many places, including ftp.uu.net:/info/rfc
and the Regina Museum of Ancient Computing Technology.

No, Syleans are a human "minor race".  But there are only two pieces of 
evidence in print.  The clearest one is the world detail sheet for Capital 
in Traveller\'s Digest #9 which states that Capital (Sylea) has a human 
minor race.  There also was an _Azhanti_ intruder named "Sylean High 
Lightning", and the initial adjective seems to mostly be for separate human 
"races" (except the Solomani, since they were the enemy when the ships were 
built in the 990s).  Some features in the Imperial Park on Capital in TD #9 
seem to have names that don\'t follow any Vilani or Solomani pattern, and 
are possibly High Sylean in origin.

Except on a handful of worlds near Capital, the Syleans show up little.  I
figure that they were one of the worlds that got jump-1 from the Vilani 
before absorption, and then after they were absorbed, they had a brief 
pre-Night rebirth when the Solomani ran over the area.  So the two "majors" 
dominate pretty heavily.  Since the Solomani had their capital at Kaggushus, 
it makes sense that Sylea had strong Solomani-influenced cultural components,
and a population of "ethnic Solomani" (maybe more like "ethnic Second 
Imperials").

David Reed <556N@delphi.com> writes:

>Where did the plethora of races from Terra go? 

They\'re still there.  Many of the worlds in the Solomani Rim were originally
Julian May-style "ethnic worlds" -- check out the names on some of them.
Zhongguo.  Thorwald.  Oudh.  (Of course, who knows who settled Arisia and
Boskone -- "Doc" Smith fans?) :) Magyar sector has a knot of Slavic worlds 
which all went out and settled in the same spot.  The member governments
of the Solomani Confederation are often single or multi-world groupings
that may have an ethnic or colonial relationship.  Perfect for the sorts
of things you may want to do.

Terra itself settled down a lot because of the immediate lethal threat that
the Vilani Ziru Sirka presented in the 22nd century.  But when things got a
bit more relaxed, the people who couldn\'t stand the new united Terra left,
for the most part.  Also, 3500 years of history is between Traveller and
our era -- enough to tangle and add many new kinks into the relations of
the Terran inhabitants and the colonies she influenced.  To illustrate the
distance in time, 3500 years before today is 1500 BC.

Yeah, the RC and Old Expanses/Diaspora regions are very Solomani/Western
in culture so far.  I expect them to have troubles with even some of the
local Solomani-descended cultures, and when they start hitting other non
Solomani humans, or non-humans, the real tricky stuff starts....  Anyone 
here seen _Lawrence of Arabia_?  Pride goeth before a fall.

Attention Traveller Collectors!
 
I\'ve recently aquired multiple copies of the following
out-of-print items by Digest Group Publications, and am offering
them for sale:
 
 
Travellers\' Digest #19      8 1/2" x 11"    48 pages       DGP  $15
 
    TD19 contains an exciting adventure called "The Possession
    Ball" set in Deneb Sector.  Here is an excerpt:  "At the time
    the Kalavatos Institute was destroyed, researchers there were
    experimenting with the psionic transfer of a subject\'s
    thought-force into inanimate objects..."
 
    For convenience, also printed in the mag is a map of Deneb
    Sector, Deneb library data, and world UWP for Deneb.  Plus
    the mag\'s regular features.
 
Travellers\' Digest #20      8 1/2" x 11"    48 pages       DGP  $15
 
    TD20 has the adventure "An Act of Conscience", which deals
    with a robot that has attained true sentience.  The adventure
    takes place in the Trojan Reaches (one sector Rimward of the
    Spinward Marches), and the issue includes a history, a map,
    and library data and library data on that sector.  This issue
    also contains another adventure, a covert operation called
    "The Hiawatha Gambit" set in the Spinward Marches, plus the
    usual potpouri of support articles.
 
Travellers\' Digest #21      8 1/2" x 11"    48 pages       DGP  $15
 
    TD21 contains the adventures "One Last Stop" and "The Pirates
    of Tetrini".  The former takes place at an ancient site in
    Regina Subsector of the Spinward Marches, while the latter
    sends the PCs on a mission to investigate a likely pirate
    base.  The issue also includes equipment write-ups, an
    in-depth article on suspended animation, and more.
 
Megatraveller Journal #3    8 1/2" x 11"   96 pages      M DGP  $20
 
    MTJ3 is a collasal sourcebook crammed with useful gaming
    material.  The main adventure, "Rapid Repo", by Greg Videll,
    "propels a team of Domain Scout commandos into the
    Vargr-occupied Imperial Navy Depot in Corridor Sector".  The
    adventure comes complete with a map of the Depot (essentially
    a huge starport), floorplans, and special equipment.
 
    This issue also includes an IN-DEPTH write-up of a
    highly populated tech-level 16 world in Deneb Sector,
    articles on races to be found in the Domain of Deneb, an
    article on MegaCorporations in the Rebellion Era, equipment,
    news items, an NPC dossier, a ship write-up, lots of artwork
    (including a cool mock-ad for a military equipment supplier),
    and an interview with the popular Traveller writers/brothers
    J. Andrew Keith and William H. Keith, Jr.
 
Megatraveller Journal #4    8 1/2" x 11"   96 pages      M DGP  $30
 
    MTJ4 is actually a campaign sourcebook desguised as a
    magazine.  Nearly the entire issue is devoted to William H.
    Keith Jr\'s "Lords of Thunder" campaign set in Gateway Sector
    (which lies between the Imperium and the Two Thousand Worlds
    (K\'kree space).  The campaign includes a central adventure,
    and loads of loads of background and support material.  The
    front cover displays a painting by WHK himself, depicting
    Gateway Prime, the artificial world for which the sector is
    named.  This work was by far, IMHO, WHK\'s greatest
    contribution to the Traveller universe.
 
    William H. Keith, Jr. says it best, in the interview from
    MTJ3:
 
        "Seeker games had commissioned me to do a campaign
        module, `Lords of Thunder\', and they just gave me an
        entire sector to play with.  It\'s the Gateway sector and
        it\'s out between the Imperium and K\'kree space."
 
        "It\'s far enough from the Imperium that I was able to set
        up seven or eight different mini empires, each one with
        maybe twenty or thirty stars.  K\'kree space is right next
        door, in the next sector over.  One off-shoot of the Two
        Thousand Worlds has kind of broken off from the parent
        group and formed their own Empire.  They\'ve started to
        leak across into this sector.  They\'ve just now absorbed
        a human-dominated subsector.  Also mixed in with this are
        rumors that the G\'naak, the thought to be extinct ancient
        enemy of the K\'kree, are about, somewhere, and the K\'kree
        have agents out looking for them."
 
        "I wrote this entire campaign, where the adventurers come
        in and they can be hired by any number of different
        patrons.  One way or another, they\'ll find themselves
        going out and getting involved in any of the following.
        There\'s an archeological party that\'s tracking down this
        mysterious presumably extinct civilization.  There are
        pirates that are orgainzing raids against ships, there\'s
        a war brewing between all of these human empires, the
        K\'kree are coming through, and there are refugees fleeing
        the K\'kree -- you can really get caught up in the
        politics of this sector."
 
        "But this project really does represent one of my main
        goals.  That was, to take a whole sector and work it up
        with enough detail in the planets and in the conflicting
        cultures and the history so that you could just draw
        dozens of adventures from it."
 
        [RS -- Joe Fugate liked the sound of the campaign so much
        that he contacted Seeker Publications and secured the
        rights to print the campaign in MTJ4!  I\'ve found the
        campaign to be suitable for Classic or MegaTraveller
        settings.]
 
I\'ve got more than a dozen of each of the above items, but I
don\'t expect them to last long, so contact me ASAP.
 
Enjoy,

Great, in theory, if you\'re running a campaign from a strategic standpoint,
but my players usually prefer to be right in the middle of it.  You can
keep that in mind when determining what sort of intel your analyst(s) feed
your drop troops (if you\'re a battledress freak), but analysts generally
are very dull to play.  It was a great scene in Patriot Games, though, for
the juxtaposition of cold-blooded murder by the SAS to the clinical, calc-
ulating analysis/amusement of the CIA spooks.

Right now, I\'m running a campaign on Keipes (0132/Aubaine/Old Expanses) from
Path of Tears (c).  No spaceships in orbit or drop troops due to that nasty,
nasty deep-site meson gun...  Bummer.  At least they think so...


On another note, does anybody have any theories on how Grandfather has coped
with Virus?  Was he affected at all (already having true AI of his own)?
Last I heard he was holed up in pocket universe somewhere waiting for some
PCs to stumble over...  Just as texture for sheer GM pleasure...

>Why the Techie survey?

It ain\'t a _real_ survey, just a \'look-see\' to determine for myself the
people on the TML

(Incidentally: 
1)  I predit that most of the people here are either
\'scientists/technologists\' or \'historian/polisci\' folks.
2)  I have been both: I studied History for two years at McMaster U.
                   and Computer Science for the last two years.

This is for you, David Reed...

3)  A CNA = Certified Novell Administrator. (a network supervisor)
This certification is rather difficult to get: a good grip of computers
and a VERY good understanding of NetWare 3.1x is needed.)

Could you tell me?  I understand why GDW included the two adventures in TNE

Well, I _would_ appreciate the additional detail for my characters.  It\'s

and a family (even a clone group...)

I hear you.  How about if we make quirks common (both good and bad),

> Where did the plethora of races from Terra go? 

  Good question. 

   The basic answer is 

1) The product should appeal to your target audience
   (Which so far, is still thought to be WASP....)

2) GDW wisely wishes to avoid controversy, and nothing will stir up a 
   Hornet\'s nest like Race or Religion (topics usually avoided in SF, too)

However...

Actually, genetic drift would insure the continued existance of races,
unless it was Imperial Policy to promote a single, homogenised race.

(A (beep) Interesting "Imperial Policy"!  Unlikely, since the Third Imp.
didn\'t interfere in the affairs of individual worlds...  They DID promote
a single Imperial Language (Anglic) , though.)

Be careful about "...haven\'t homogenized within the last couple thousand
years", though.  IF humans were truly colourblind - our current fixation
on race may just be a local (i.e. Earth-bound, provincial) phenomonun (sp!) -
we may become a single race within say two centuries.  Thanks to the advent
of easy, worldwide travel, of course.

I will, however, grant you the enduring nature of racial pride/divisions.  
Bets are, the following would happen instead...

Well, the vast majority (There were a few tokens to be found in MegaT).

In Real Life (tm), the racial composition of the Third Imp. would look
something like...

     20% Chinese         13% other Solomani (Blacks and Whites, together
     20% East Indian                         at last!)
     20% Vilani           2% Minor race, human + non-human   
     20% New Races        5% Major non-human (mainly Vargr)
         (genetic drift, 
          designer races, etc...)

....

And the religious composition? (A subject I\'ll get to shortly...) 

    30% New Religion A  (The main Imperial religion, supported by the
                         nobility...)
    10% New Religion B  (In all likelihood, the old Vilani faith)
    10% Solomani Religion A   (Buddism?  It\'s a missionary faith, of a 
                               part of the world dominant in 2057 AD
                               - when jump drive is discovered...)
    10% Solomani Religion B   (Christianity? Islam?  Certainly, one of the
                               Solomani monotheistic faiths (or both of
                               the major ones) can be fit into this
                               slot...) 
    10% Solonami Religion C   (Islam? Hinduism? or a new faith?)
    10% New Religion C        (Probably, at least one totally new religion
                               would have resulted from the union of Vilani
                               and Solomani cultures...)
    5% Agnostic/Atheist       (Militant ones, i.e. Communists?)
    5% Vargr Religions        (A whole _ton_ of them.  
                               Includes human converts, excude\'s Vargr
                               who follow a human faith)
    8% Other human            (Single, world-bound faiths.  
                               This is the only religion recognized by 
                               the standard Traveller universe, which I 
                               doubt very much would reflect reality ...)
    2% Other non-human

........

 Of course, the human \'races\' are mainly cultural/historical,
with the genetics used, to divide the Ingroup from the Outgroup. 
(And occassionally to justify Supremacy doctrines....)

The real problem with this is that the logical language of the Third Imp.
would be some mongrel Mandarin/Vilani tongue, not English.  Ah, well....

Never mind the fury religious/racial folks can cause (ask TSR for a

avoided, or rendered as innocous as possible.

My three RICE candidates.... 
 1) Regina/Spinward Marches

I just want to know what\'s going on at \'home\')

 2) Deneb/Deneb

This TL D, Religious Autocracy is quite interesting.

I believe - correct me if I\'m wrong - that this was the Sector capital of
Deneb, during the era of the Third Imperium ("pre-Rebellion", for us
Regency citizens).

During the Rebellion period it was lost for a time to the Vargr Hordes,
but the Archduke managed to recapture it for the Domain.

Now, it stands in the Quarrentine Zone of the Regency, as a major base of
operations for the Qarrentine Service and the Regency Navy.
 
 3) Trin/Spinward Marches

What, exactly, happened here when the AI Virus hit?
How many people still live here?
And how does the Regency plan to rebuild (or at least disenfect) Trin?

(Incidentally: RICE notes is a detailed \'paper\' for systems within the
Regency\'s purview.  Ask around if further info is needed, or grab the new
TNE archives - the details are in there, somewhere...)

..Also, what happened to the *Shall Not Perish* Regency sourcebook for TML?

Thanks to all,

The material should be at least as dense as what you are trying to

  From a rules point of view, aimed shots (at one difficultly level

is aimed toward a joint or other weak point (such as the face shield).
In a Vacumn or CBW enviroment, just breeching the suit would 
be enough to take out the opponent.

 Yup.  Hiding from those heavy weapons would be important too.  Start

   Imperial TL E & F Marines enjoy a certain level of stealth and EW measures

such as jamming and man-portable and support level HARM missles.

  Not even a TL 15 sabre?  How about fitting SuperDense Bayonets?  You do
have 
the advantage of low ammo expenditure though.  For a real life example, go to

present day Africa.  Troops encountering fleeing civilans in large numbers, 
don\'t open fire.  They draw their machettes and wade in.  CNN showed
film clips of those who survived and escaped.  It is a bloody mess though.

 Bearing in mind that we will not be making any major revisions
 until the present print run (Mk1 Mod 1) runs out: Maybe. What do
 you mean by "life paths," and how do they differ from the current
 career sequence in TNE?

 Probably not. We feel that the player should be able to choose
 any quirks or idiosyncrasies present in his/her PC, rather than
 having them forced by a random die roll. If you want something
 like this in your games,you could make up a table yourself, or use
 the NPC motivations table.

 You could do 100+ pages on something like this, and still not

 My personal opinion is that there can be no meaningful role-
 playing interaction between a human and an animal the size of an
 ocean. A creature that big could eat a spaceship (probably
 without noticing it) and there wouldn\'t be squat you could do
 about it (assuming such a creature were biologically
 feasible...there are certain limitations to how big an animal can
 get (plants are another matter, however: anybody remember the
 news clip about the county-sized fungus they found in Minnesota a
 couple of years ago? Of course, it could be debated that that
 wasn\'t really a single organism...)).

 Re: The Battledress question:

 doesn\'t perforate the armor. Blunt trauma adds up...and
 plasma/fusion weapons do blunt trauma.

 Nope. As Paul James notes later on, the correction was put into
 the 2nd printing, and was posted to a number of electronic
 locations (for people who have the first printing), TML included,
 I am quite certain (although it didn\'t go into the Upgrade
 Booklet). All of the people who submitted designs for the RCEG
 certainly knew about it.
 
 For those who are interested, the long-promised FF&S 1st
 Printing to 2nd Printing Upgrade will appear in Challenge #75
 (the special _all_ Traveller issue). This issue goes to press
 this week, and should be available in about three weeks.

 If you can get a hold of the Solomani/Aslan book, read pages 17-21.
Basically, many peoples emigrated off-earth due to the perceived
attitude of the growing Confederation government on Earth during the
Interstellar War period and into the Rule of Man.  These people went
in all directions, to a rough maximum of 4 sectors distant.

 At the Terran end of Imperial space, this is indeed the case.  Terra
was left in the hands of the "non-minority" groups, who are predominantly
caucasian.  The various member-states of the Confederation are generally
dominated by some other ethnic group.  Solomani/Aslan states that some
80% of the Solomani Sphere speaks Galanglic as a _second_ language, with
one of the various Old Earth tongues being the first.

 The rest of Imperial space is different.  Those Terrans who went out
to carry the Rule of Man to the Vilani were largely drowned out ethnically
by the vast majority of Vilani they lived among, especially after the
Long Night fell.  Aside from isolated pockets (the Sword Worlds, for
example), the majority of the Imperium is "just people," with a bit
more local variation in appearance than the Vilani would normally have.
The cultural variation in most of the Imperium is due more to the
isolation of the Long Night than to any pre-existing ethnic mix.

 Then again, we have the Spinward Marches.  Colonized by Rule of Man
expatriots, the Darrians, Zhodani and the Sword Worlders first, then by
Third Imperial expansion later, the Marches are extremely diverse on
a world-by-world basis.  Their apparent sameness is due to two factors:
Referee imagination (or the lack of it), and Artistic imagination (or
the lack of it).  GDW _has_ shown a variety of human cultures in their
products, but when your artists are doing line-art (the easiest to print)
everybody looks white...

 Possible, but not so. Admittedly, Solomani/Aslan is harder to get a
copy of these days than Azhanti High Lightning, but I recommend the
search.

I bought TNE delux boxed set, and the new formula is in my version of
FF&S. There are some errata for FF&S in the little booklet provided
with the boxed set, but the gauss round weight is not one of these.
 ----
Well when I bought my copy of deluxe TNE the gauss ammo formula in FF&S was 
the old one listed above.
My complaint is that the above comment "That\'s why we changed it to 
0.02*(Pi)*r/`3" by GDW implies that knowledge of this change is widespread 
or at least an attempt has been made to inform people that a change has been 
made!
While updating the later printings of a product is good it does nothing to 
help all the people who have bought the earlier printings and might not even 
know that a change has occurred. I don\'t see what is so hard about GDW 
sticking any errata in Challenge which would reach most people.
Also are there any other "little changes" that GDW would like to share with 
the rest of us about any TNE products?

It sounds as if you have never seen DGP\'s Solomani and Aslan sourcebook but
nonetheless you\'ve managed to exactly reconstruct the history of the Solomani
described therein.  Great minds think alike, eh?

David Reed continues:

I agree that this is the impression that many people get upon first
encountering the Traveller universe.  The main cultural distinction within
the Imperium is that between the Vilani and the Solomani and there is a
tendency
amongst white Europeans (and their descendants) to think of both groups
as being like themselves.  A close examination of the Traveller background
reveals that this impression is erroneous.   The Solomani certainly contain
descendants of all the major racial groups currently abiding on the Earth.
As for the Vilani, by the time of the Third Imperium they were no longer
considered to be a distinct racial group but are instead decribed as
being a cultural influence.  I\'m not quite sure what that means myself:
if someone asked an Imperial citizen if they were Vilani or Solomani, does
this mean that no-one would ever describe themselves as being Vilani?  It
sounds as if the Vilani have the same significance for the Third Imperium
that the Ancient Greeks and Romans have for us today.  Both groups no
longer exist but their cultural artifacts (poetry, art, music, plays,
philosophy and political ideas) continue to influence us.  The Solomani,
however, do continue to exist as a racial group, mainly because of the
Solomani Confederation.  The \'Solomani\' though, as you point out, consist
of a multitude of different cultural and racial groups.  This results in
the Solomani being much less united than they would like to appear to
the rest of the universe.  The Vilani by contrast, were much more
homogeneous, this lack of variety being one of the causes of their
downfall at the hands of the upstart Terrans.  The implication of
Traveller\'s history would seem to be that cultural diversity is a good
thing because it leads to innovation.  Cultural homogeneity leads to
stagnation and decline.

I think that you are underestimating the pressures to join larger, 
interstellar communities (such as the Imperium and the Solomani 
Confederation).  The history of the Earth itself is not one of cultural
groups living in peaceful isolation from each other.  It\'s of cultural
groups in conflict with one another over resources and over different
conceptions of the universe.  There are many theories about why
European colonialism occured and one of them is that the growing economies
of Europe in the 19th century required new markets to sell their products
to.  Assuming that a colony had a growing economy, this would result in
a need to find new markets and to seek them out.  It has already been
established in the Traveller universe that those periods which saw a
decline in interstellar trade i.e. the Long Night  were periods of
technological decline.  Trade is presented as being vital to progress 
in a technological sense at the very least.  This is very apparent in
the New Era setting:  why else is the Reformation Coalition trying to
reconquer the Imperium?

Classic Traveller adventure no. 9 "Nomads of the World Ocean" was set
on a world in the Solomani Rim that had been colonised originally by
Turkish people.  The adventure managed to achieve an exotic atmosphere
through its\' use of elements of Turkish culture: names, customs etc.
translated into an unusual environment (the Turkish descendants lived
in large ocean-going ships).

GDW\'s reluctance to deal with these issues started long before PC.
I always believed that the lack of religion in the Traveller universe was
due to a desire on GDW\'s part not to offend the religious sensibilities
of its\' readers, something that seems to be very important in the States.
It would be politically controversial to describe the state of Christianity,
Islam, Judaism etc. 30 centuries in the future.  Imagine the possible
consequences: GDW offices bombed by Islamic fundamentalists, Christian
Fundies mount a nationwide T.V. campaign against this \'demonic\' games
company, B\'nai B\'rith sue...

----

Question to those rewriting FFS to beef up lasers and energy weapons: Are you
keeping physical reality in mind when making these changes, or is it a matter
of changing the game mechanics to give you a desired effect?

This isn\'t intended as an insult to your intelligence but an honest question.
 As an engineer, I tinkered with a lot of the old rules because they had
devices like household robots using 10 kW of energy.  A robot using this much
energy could do a nice job of heating your home (all energy is eventually
converted to heat, which is then radiated into the environment).  I also sent
GDW lots of letters on the subject, and was pleased that FFS seemed to take
reality into account so much.  Energy weapons, as we currently understand
them, really do have a lot of drawbacks - eg. look at the need for \'gravitic
focussing\' of space lasers.

If the changes are for game effects, don\'t forget to percolate them through
the design system. If (for example) you postulate greatly increased chemical
energy storage (so that a plasma gunner can carry more rounds) then this will
also have an effect on power sources for other uses, unless you can come up
with a reason why it can\'t.  

Let me emphasize here that I\'m not trying to \'run down\' the game effect
approach: I\'ve run both hard science and space opera games and enjoyed both. 
At the moment I tend to be hard science with respect to equipment and world
design but space opera with gametime rules.  (In fact, I will probably be
using Deam Park rules for combat, because (a) they are fast, (b) my group
already knows them, and (c) we don\'t really have much combat anyway.)

 Actually, I suspect that DNI is obsolete, period, by the time the 
 New Era rolls around.  Remember, Virus was primarily an 
 intelligence that spread through computer-to-computer 
 communication.  Worse, it did so apparently without regard for the 
 differences in hardware of different computer systems.  DNI 
 presents Virus with a pretty complex "hardware" platform, but one 
 that is in principle no different from any other infectable 
 hardware platform - at least from Virus\'s point of view.  I don\'t 
 know about you, but that would scare me shitless, and as soon as I 
 heard about any kind of Virus that could span hardware platforms 
 with impunity, I\'d make damned sure that there ain\'t gonna be no 
 DNI (Damned Neural Interface) to _my_ head.

 Question (somewhat tongue-in-cheek) to GDW:  How many computer 
 jockeys went stark raving looney, or had radical personality

 more to the point, how many cases of HIV (Humans Infected by

 Well, given that we have the technology today to calibrate 
 robots to give a response within the _robot\'s_ range proportional 
 to the stimulus exerted within the _operator\'s_ range, I would say 
 that a fixed strength value for (much more advanced) power armor 
 makes more sense.

 What I mean with the statement about proportionality is that no 
 matter how weak or strong I am, a robot that is programmed to 
 react to my stimulus can be calibrated so that when I exert what I 
 believe is my reasonable maximum force on the controls, the robot 
 exerts its maximum force upon the target object.  If you are 
 stronger than I am, it makes no difference, as the robot would be 
 calibrated for you at that point.

 In fact, there is no reason that the robot need be calibrated for 
 a particular individual; merely set the robot to a high response 
 at a relatively low level of stimulus, and allow the operator to 
 calibrate him/herself to the robot instead.  Again, the result is 
 a fixed strength for the robot.

 I haven\'t read the rules for powered armor, but the analogy holds.  
 Moreover, such a "fixed response" low input calibration would also 
 potentially have the beneficial side effect of reducing the effort 
 expended by the operator, thus granting an END (CON, now) benefit 
 as well.

 I would impose a DEX/AGL penalty, however, unless the armor was 
 equipped with full VR feedback and controls.

I have to admit that I don\'t use battle dresses in my game so I can\'t much
comment your ideas. But about your trouble with TL 14 heavy combat armor,
I can give you 3 different options.

1)  You can shoot your PCs with heavy weapons and roll the dices, but don\'t
    read the results of all the dices and instead give them the results of 1.
    In that way your players can think that they were lucky but can\'t say for
    sure that you saved their asses once more.

2)  You can try to design a weapon for your taste.

3)  You can kill one or two of you PCs and injure the rest. Then try to move
    the survivors to place where they don\'t need or get their hands on such
    armors. This is the Cyber Punk way.

This is what Battledress/Env.Suit skills are for ;-)

A high skill could offset the penalty and it might also be useful for 
the skill to add to a fixed suit-dependant strength value to show how 
the user can get the best performance from the suit. I might even 
work out a few number tonight ;-)

    'body' => '   The Depot system is indeed the site of Alpha Ophiuchi A/B. 
Astronomically speaking, Alpha Ophiuchi (aka Ras Alhague) is very
interesting.  The star system consists of a F5 V, which is rotating at an
extremely high rate, and a companion star which is a K0 subgiant (class IV)
which has a period of rotation around the primary of 8.67 years.  The
subgiant is a large one--almost large enough to be considered a class III
giant.

Hypothetical Stats for the Depot system in 1201:

         20  Moon 10-D  Y201000-0  Imperial Ruins present

Note: There were research stations constructed in this system by both
Vilani Imperium and the Third Imperium to study the rapid rotation of
the system\'s primary.  Both were located on Moon 9-C,  and survived the
Collaspe relatively intact, though their life support equipment and power
plants are not operational.  
   The big draw of this system is, without question however, the dozens of
TL 12-15 starships and other vessels that are parked in orbit around Moon
10-D.  Most of these have severe battle damage (from their days as warships
during the Second Solomani Rim War), and are therefore unusable as space
vessels--but could still be stripped for valuable parts.  Other damaged vessels
can be found in smaller numbers in the asteroid belt, particularly around the
planetoid that served as the main starport for the system (now a gutted mass
of metal and rock).
   Extreme caution should be exercised when visiting this system, as the
extent of vampire ship activity is unknown in this region, and any of the
de-activated starships in this system could be infected with Virus (and likely
are).  Several craters are visible from orbit on Moon 10-D which were
created by starships that impacted on the surface.  In other parts of the
system, there are large debris fields which contain blasted out planetoids,
pieces of space vessels, and an occasional unlucky individual who died
when he/she was sucked out into space, or the air ran out of their vacc suit.

Here is also some additional comments based on Steve\'s response:

<Cicero can\'t be Aldebaran, because the subsector rimward of it is Aldebaran
subsector in Aldebaran sector!  Depot can\'t be alpha Oph, since both listed
stars are dwarfs, etc.>

   Depot is the correct location of Alpha Ophiuchi (see Depot system
submission).

   Cicero falls within the parameters for the location of Aldeberan, though
it is certainly at the edge of minimum distance.  A more precise location
would place it three to four hexes further spinward-rimward (in the Jardin
subsector), according to my research.  That of course still means that the
Aldeberan subsector of the Aldeberan Sector is not the correct location
for Aldeberan the star (though it could be if GDW had the direction to
Aldeberan incorrect as well).  I have consulted with Dave Nilsen about the
subject, and he would rather "let sleeping dogs lie" for now.  The main
problem is that Cicero as the location of Aldeberan has become part of
the Traveller orthodoxy, and GDW has in the past been very reluctant to
change stellar data (among other things) if the data is at all plausible and
works with the storyline.

1. Battledress
 why penitrated ? if a trooper in battledress is hit by a large mass 
moving at even relitively low speed then the kinetic energy will have to go 
somewhere and at best this will result in brusing/fractures.

consider a trooper in TL14 battledress is hit by a large boulder (mass 
approx 10kg ) rolling down a hill, slope 45 degrees, for 20 meters. IS 
this trouper going to be a happy bear?.

If this is the case then if TL2 use siege weapons then battledresse 
troupers are going to take damage as when the projectile hits the 
momentum that it has has to be disapated and as a result the trooper 
will suffer damage

an effective weapon could therefore be designed around a HSHE round, a 
modern tank killing weapon. As the target is a trouper then the round 
could be of small caliber say 10-15 mm and this would do damage without 
penitrating the suit thus leaving it for future re-use.

Remember kinetic energy has to go someware when it hits battledress

Melee weapons

These can be effective at close range and would be standard issue to TL8 
and would be mail use weapons to TL3 and widely used to TL6

Aha! So now we have discovered the ideal weapon for despatching battle-armoured
idiots - captapults! Forward the XXIV Legion! The Romans have conquered the

Seriously, though, I agree with your kinetic energy discussion points. What we
do (working with Megatraveller) is to say if you _hit_ but don\'t penetrate with
a "field" weapon (a rough designation of anything doing 6D or more or that goes
off bang), I apply 1 point per die as kinetic damage regardless. Also note that
we use a tripled hit points and On Target location system, as found in White
Dwarf many moons ago... You might find a 10D grenade which doesn\'t penetrate
killing your weaker characters. Then again, you might _want_ that!

Well, the temporary demise of TML was a severe blow.  Possibly, my
own absence from the \'Net was something of a factor.  Nevertheless,
everything that was done for *Shall Not Perish* (tm) presumably is
still out there in the old TML archives.

I also have "heard" that GDW has moved up the release of its own
Regency Sourcebook from "something in two years" to a possible
December, 1994 release.  I don\'t have any confirmation of that
rumor but I suspect if it\'s true that might be a further disincentive
for folks to participate in our own TML Regency Sourcebook.  Also,
the ever-increasing insistence on "ownership" of Traveller material
(I thought copyrights protect *words*, not *ideas*?) also might
discourage some folks from participating.

IMHO, there\'s no reason we can\'t continue *Shall Not Perish* here
on the new TML.  Unless, of course, that violates the licensing
agreement of these fine folks who have agreed to provide us
with this resurrected forum.

   Dave Nilsen was reported to have said "Regency sourcebook in the first
quarter of 1995! So let\'s all call it quits and go back to our hotel

               armour is.)


   At close to 4 MCr, this is an expensive vehicle, but is popular with
the Imperial Scouts and Navy.  What makes it popular, and expensive, is
the good communications and sensor suites (90% of the cost is in the
meson communicator, active EMS, and densitometer).

   Space is set aside for some fair weaponry, but with an AV of 7 it
should not be mistaken for an armoured vehicle.  The references to
diameter define the maximum focal array diameter of any lasers that
might be installed.

   The standard fusion pack is a 1 kL, 1.3 t, kCr102 unit producing 3
MW of power and containing fuel for 1y of operation, in a
self-contained unit (with an AV of 2).  Has enough controls installed
to be operated independently, but works best when tied into a proper
crew station (increase task difficulties if no crew station hook up).

   The vehicle is unlikely to be found intact in a Star Viking
campaign, but working fusion packs and NAS sensors bring top credit if
salvaged in working condition.

 GDW\'s current damage system is based on the kinetic energy
 of the projectile, and it is possible to calculate the damage
 for almost any type of projectile.

 Example: 10kg rock is dropped from a cliff, and hits a trooper
 20m below (in 1G gravity, with negligible air friction). The rock
 will have about 1962 joules of kinetic energy when it hits.
 This energy corresponds to DV 3 and Pen 1.

 Modern 5.56mm NATO bullet has the same damage value and short range
 penetration as this rock.

 Note that heavily armored troopers will still take _Blunt Trauma_
 damage from any projectile that hits their armor, and troopers
 can be killed with multiple non-penetrating hits. This is explained
 in TNE rulebook, in page 285.

 Catapult-launched slow and heavy rock can be as dangerous as a rifle-
 fired fast and light bullet, if they have the same kinetic energy.

 I assume that you meant a HESH warhead.

 HESH High Explosive Squash Head - Warhead composed of plastic
  explosive which deforms in impact and then detonates.
  Effect is to create shock wave in armor plate to create
  spalling - large flake(s) of armor which fly around the
  interior causing havoc with crew and equipment.

 HESH warhead is also called HEP, High Explosive Plastique. Note that
 kinetic energy penetrators can cause similar spalling as HESH does,
 even when they do not completely penetrate the armor.
 HESH warhead is one approach to penetrate armor using explosives, and
 though it has different damage mechanism than HEAP warhead, the final
 results are relatively similar.

 IMHO, HESH warheads are high-tech HEAP warheads.

 PS. The shock wave caused by HESH explosion can cause major damage to
 modern tank engines, electronic devices, vision blocks, etc. It is
 quite unlikely that HESH-wrecked combat armor could be re-used without
 complete overhaul.

 We did what we did to give characters in BD a little variety,
 rather then making them all exactly the same. This was a design
 decesion, and we made a lot of those that some people don\'t agree
 with.

 That system is intended for use _only_ with NPCs. Player

 If it contains any of our copyrighted material (tables, charts,
 etc.), yes. Writing the utility and using it yourself is
 evidently OK (to the best of our legal advice), but selling,
 conveying, or giving it to anyone else is a definite no-no (and
 this includes putting stuff in FTP sites, BBS libraries, "I just
 put it on a disk and left it on a table" gimicks, and the like).

 We can\'t give you a technical legal answer because we aren\'t
 lawyers, and the legalities of the whole "Intellectual property
 vs Infobahn" thing aren\'t completely settled yet. GDW must,
 however, take a rather conservative position in these matters, or
 risk _losing_ the trademarks and copyrights that constitute our
 livlihood. That\'s why we have to answer Shalom (see above) like
 we did.
 
 We have no problem with _conversation_ about Traveller (we
 actively encourage it), but there are people who want to do a
 good deal more than that, and get highly offended when we tell
 them they can\'t (I have heard rumors of a series of flames
 circulating about us because we wouldn\'t OK an on-line
 electrozine). I\'m not kidding when I say that one proposal wanted
 to photocopy/OCR large bunches of our stuff and give it away, and
 wanted our official stamp of approval to do so (we refused, of
 course).

 Not true. GDW\'s policy has _always_ been that the full panoply
 of Terran racial and national diversity went into space, spread
 out, and diversified. Why do you think we say: "Any character is
 potentially of either sex or any race." Back in the classic
 Traveller days, John Harshman and I tried to get the widest
 variety of ethnic names into the game in order to drive this
 point home (anybody remember an admiral Stashu Nagoya, the
 Japanese-Pole?). Of course, what happened to it afterwards is
 anybody\'s guess.
 
 We have had (and still have) problems convincing our artists to
 depict other than causasian males (we are not alone in this
 either), but this should _not_ be construed as indicating that
 space travel is only for WASPs (check out the illos in Star
 Vikings on pps 10, 26, 28, and 68 for some characters that are
 clearly not purely European, and several of the others are
 problematical...its a little hard to tell from a B&W illo) or
 only for men. Frankly, I am a little peeved that we do not have
 more asiatics depicted in our illustrations, and I have mentioned
 this our art director. I disagree with many of Gene Roddenberry\'s
 philosophical expressions in Star Trek, but I feel he got one
 thing right: We humans should celebrate our diversity.
 
 As for cultures, we don\'t talk about individual planetary human
 cultures or religions much (except in individual adventures),
 because we assume that referees will bring interesting and exotic
 cultures/religions into their campaign to suit their own tastes
 (just as you have done) and we prefer not place any restrictions
 on this. We do not discuss sex or sexual orientation for the same
 reason. Player characters can be whatever their players want them
 to be, and the game is richer and more diverse because of it.
 
 Sorry if I went a little overboard in this response...I feel
 rather strongly on the subject.

 My view was that they were a culturally distinct group, but not
 a separate minor race from the mainstream of humanity. I\'m pretty
 sure this was Marc\'s view as well, but I haven\'t spoken to him
 about it. I do not view the evidence quoted as overwhelming, but
 I\'m not strongly attached/opposed to either notion.

 start a sh*tst*rm or not), the title may be _Shall not

David...
it is Scott - Irish or Irish - Scottish Scotch is what you drink!
from a Irish - Scott ( mostly Irish ;-) ) ( I once was corrected
on this by a retired RSM Ion McKenzie... :-) )
I have no problem and I don\'t mind playing with ethnically based worlds
or civilisatons...
but why just stick to solomani Ethnic bounds use the imagination...
How about Anserin or syleain erhnic varieations...
Or even ( He said going out on a limb Hope nobody saws it off... :-) )
Hiver or Aslan or ( Heaven forfend ) K\'Kree...
Could be interesting and show the characters that the usuall press that
they see abut Aslan ( for Instance ) isn\'t always true...
That is one thing I so like about the Spinward Marches You run into 
ethnic Vilani who act more Solomani... etc.
it is a lot of fun trying to guess how a NPC who looks Vilani is going 
to act or react... ;-)
And I can see where this kind of thing will enliven any Campain. Especally
the RECES types...
I guess what this all boils down to is that I seem to have no intolerances ?
Well I don\'t know about that :-) but I have no problem with this kind of 
thing.
Some of the characters I have run or am running, Duchess Aurora... a Vilani-
solmani mix ( common in the Marches ) but her famialy is given to Blonds
( Gold hair accually ), Light eyes, and Psionics, all of which seem to be 
recessive Gens ( sp? ). 
Gunnar - He appears to be an ethnic Sword worlder Bigger than even their 
avrage but within their group. ( he is also from the Marches ) some of his
problems include blending in???? Sun light hurts!!! " Sun What Sun... here
in the fieords we don\'t see the sun much." He does have small boat handeling
and Tihlea -  Vilani She looks Vilani she sounds vilani she even has some  
of the conservatism of the vilani ( might be a result of her academic pro-
fession ;-) ). But she is a product of the prevailing culture here in the 
marches ( Regina/Regina ).
so you can play as much or little as you want with cultures. Bear in mind 
that starship crews and Scouts will be on the whole a more cosmopaltin bunch
and probably will wait and see just how it is going to jump....
Ok Ok I\'ve babbled enough...
thanks for reading...
see you all...

After reading through Harold Hale\'s last couple of postings on 
the Solomani Rim stars, I went through my computer files and
verified that the stellar data in at least some of the old DGP
sector files that were on sunbane is certainly incorrect.  For
instance, in two printed sources (GDW: MT _Imperial Encyclopedia_
and DGP: Traveller\'s Digest #9), Capital is clearly identified 
as having a yellow G-class star not unlike Sol.  But in the 
UWPs from sunbane, the star is given as M0 V.  As far as I can
tell, the other categories of data are fine (for now).  So 
some of my comments may have been a bit, er, misinformed....

On Cicero as Aldebaran:

I don\'t know how solidly it\'s in the canon, but as far as I can
tell, that position is pretty bad for Aldebaran -- the angle 
should place it closer to Capella/more rimward than Cicero.  I
think that would bear out on a galactic coordinate grid.  Not
that that\'s going to stop anyone, especially with the two-d
sparsely populated grid we pretend is a galactic map, but 
somebody might want to know.

Let\'s assume that Virus acts with about speed of light. 
That is about the speed the signal moves in human nerve cells also.
Okey, then comes the reaction time. Much of the reaction time needed to
physical tasks can be forgotten, because DNI is just that (*Direct* Neural
Interface) which also transfers data at the speed of light. And when the
net jockey is well trained (in simulations which can be done easily) then
he also acts by instincs not thought.

As it is said the Virus can infest any computer system it has acces to.
If I recall right the Virus needs time to figure out new systems it
encounters.
And I suppose that RC (or Regency) has developed some new systems which are
new to Virus, thus slowing it down. Plus deckers of New Era KNOW that the 
Virus is out there and they can prepare themselves with Defence Programs.
In the light of this, I don\'t think net jockeying would be sheer suicide. It
would be dangerous, of course, but not suicidal.

And one more point. Is it possible to slow down the computer so it also would
slow down the Virus thus giving the poor decker even more time to react?
Besides in one cyberpunk genre magazine, I suppose it was Interface, there
was an article about Dragons (AIs) and Dragon killers (AI hunters) and they
also faced the fast opponents.

Actually I asked about WHAT KIND OF SENSORS WOULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR 
THAT KIND OF TASKS! But thanks anyway. Personally I think that this
kind of surveillance would help even in tactical situations because that
way groups (PCs) could get information where their comrades and enemies are.
That prevents them shooting their own and getting to ambushes. That also
needs personal receivers for every combatant.

BTW my players also prefer being in middle of the fight rather than just
watching it from distance. 

In fact I have tried to device a method which gives ratings of alertness for
characters maybe from 1 to 3, a bit similar to space combat alertness.
If you are highly alerted, then you react quickly but by instinct and you
can shoot your friend instead of foe. Low alertness affects you so you act
more slowly, but then you don\'t propably shoot your friend. Any ideas?

So, keep it hot!

Yes I agree, charachters go into fire fights all the time, and I expect that
they don\'t appreciated haveing boadily parts blown off or dying, but there is
something in human psgology which is different about, going blind, going mad
and dieing by battlefield fire. This is one reason that GW has no blinding
rules for lasers in TNE. As you said as well charachters are not suicidle,
you
have a relativly good chance of surviving a firefight, especialy if your
waring
battledress .... while decking into virus infected cyperspace would be
suicidle.

Agreed the decker will have reaction times approching that of the virus, but 
they would still be slower. Signals of the Virus will be faster, because they
have no messy chemicals signal carriers which we have to deal with. I would
think that there would still be reaction times, admitidly small, between the
thought or instinct of the decker and the opperation of the DNI, as the
thought or instinct is reacted to by the DNI, convertion of the chemical
signals, and understanding of what is needed to be done (the interface, and
there would have to be an interface ...).

As for the virus reacting to new computers, that dosn\'t come into it untill
all the deckers defences are down, and the virus tries to infect the deck or
carbon cyberspace (the human brain), through the interface of the DNI. Once
the DNI is encounterd the virus will have a better understanding of how to
get past
and into carbon cyperspace the next time, and of course it might just tell
all
it\'s other virus friends about it as well (most early strains of the virus
are
gone).

As to the virus trying to infect new systems, how about the decker ... each
system which is home to the virus will be uneque, a one off, as the virus
makes
it\'s computer it\'s home by rewireing the chips and recoading it\'s procedures
to work just haw the virus want\'s it to. This would nessesitate the decker 
working by thought and not on instinct as each system would be new, not
totaly
different but significaly so. The decker would not be able to rely on any
assumptions, as they might work in some systems, but the virus might have
changed these to sute it\'s self in others. Speacking in todays terms, each
system would be different at microcode, BIOS, system, interface, and
application level .... give that to your decker and have him eaten. The
decker
wouldn\'t even know if his defence programs would work outside his deck, it\'s
not like there is a standards boady for virus infected computers .... this is
the reason that they mutated ... (say in a realy sarcastic voice ..) to the
realy nice creatures they are now (in TNE).

Yes it\'s possible to slow the computer down, but do you realy think that the
virus is going to let you .... ?

In cyberpunk the systems and cyperspace would be specified by standards
boadies
which is why you can deck in the first place, the interface and communication
protacols to systems would be the same everywhere, only the systems would be
different, like an IBM to a DEC or an ICL, so when you go AI hunting all your
assumptions would work, and you would be able to act on instinct. Not so with
the virus, although computers and comms were once based on standardrs
authoritys, presumably something like IEEE today, that was 70 years ago,
and 70 years with no standards is a long long time .... 

In the light of all that I still think it would be total suicide ....
but probably a nice quick death ....
not too much pain ....
and that\'s "if" you die ....

 Who said they aren\'t there? If you look at the Aslan and
Solomani supplement I think you have many races depicted in the
artwork. I think there are two things contributing to your perception
that the Solomani are homogeneous.
 Firstly, in the setting your species and/or extraterrestrial
racial origin are more important than your planetary or terrestrial
racial origin. Out there in the first empire of man it was much
more important to be Solomani than to be Nigerian Solimani.
 Secondly, because most of the writers (and artists) of the
supplements were white middle-class (male) americans most of what
they depict reflect this.
 I think you are pefrectly within the spirit of (old) traveller
to hilight the multi-racial origins of Solomani. I think it is one
thing they would flaunt amongst other (especially human derived)
races. No other "race" is going to have quite the variety of
Terra.
 In my own campaign setting the majority population of the
Imperium conforms to the ethnic Indian colourations. I.e. brown
skin, black eyes and hair. In one competition scenario we ran
in Dublin there were a group of "aliens from beyond the fringe"
on the same ship as the PCs. These were unusual as they had fair
skin, black hair and green eyes (ethnic Irish colourations).
 One particularly humerous incident occured as one of the
refs described them to the players:
 Ref: "A groups sits at the table next to you. You can tell
just by looking at them that they are aliens."
 Player: "How? Do they have green skin?"
 Ref: "No, white."
 The player and ref both stopped for a second. The player was
black (very uncommon in Ireland). Then they both burst out laughing
for several minutes...

capable of being manufactured on Oriflamme.

Now this arrangement seems to make little economic sense.  While the
overall TL of Oriflamme is 9 I can\'t see why the technology for
producing the components of a single weapon could not be imported from
either other RC member worlds or the Hivers so that the entire ACR could
be produced on Oriflamme.  Or, and here\'s an adventure hook that begs to
be explored, an industrial espionage team would be recruited to obtain
the necessary technological know-how to permit production of these
components.

Er...no.  The net jockey is toast.  Human nerve conduction rates never,
to the best of my knowledge, crack 100 meters per second, which is only
about three-tenths of a percent of lightspeed.  Neurons work quite a
bit differently from electrical cabling.  The computer has an edge in
reaction time, even using a "direct neural interface" to bypass as many
delays as possible.  There is the possibility that the "Virus" computer
runs slower than light (and some possible good justification for it too),
but I wouldn\'t count on it yet.  Same goes for possible slow "Virus" 
reaction times -- there\'s some reasons why it mightn\'t be very efficient,
but still plenty why that might not be true either.

    'body' => ' Gauss Projectiles:

 Gauss projectile weight can be calculated by using the following
 formula:

 (1) Wa = (pi * r^2) * (2 * r * 5) / 1000 * d

 Where \'r\' is the radius of the projectile in millimetres, and \'d\'
 is material density.

 (explanation: volume of a cylinder which length is 5 times its
 diameter, divided by 1000 to get the volume in cm^3, and multiplied
 by the density of projectile material.)

 If \'d\' = 2 g/cm^3, the formula can be simplified to:

 (2) Wa = .02 * pi * r^3

 Formula (2) can be found in FFS (Mk 1, Mod 1) in page 102, and it
 gives 4x20mm bullet the weight of 0.5 g.

 The gauss rifle design in Digest 24 used steel projectiles, and their
 mass was calculated using formula (1), with \'d\' = 8 g/cm^3.

 IMHO, if imperial railgun projectiles are plastic darts with metal
 contacts, formula (2) in FFS gives quite realistic values.


 Gauss Pistols:

 According to FFS, the gauss weapon receiver houses only the magazine
 feed system and internal homopolar generator. I was wondering if it
 would be possible to make a Webbley&Scott-style compact gauss pistol
 by placing the HPG under or over the barrel. (W&S made compressed-air
 handguns where the large air cylinder was under the barrel.)

 In this design, the 10.8 cm barrel is placed under the 21 cm 
 receiver, and additional 4 cm receiver is added to the breech end of
 the barrel to represent the ammunition feed system. (I assume that
 the minimum length of a magnetic feed system is twice the length of a
 projectile.)

gauss rifle requires 4 times more energy than pistol, and the whole battery
is consumed after 8 rifle shots are fired.

 Reality Check: Bullpup Rifles

 In FFS page 96, is a boxed article about bullpup configuration
 rifles. The article and picture states that bullpup conversion
 is made by switching the places of the feed system and trigger
 mechanism!

 That does not work in real world.

 The feed system must be behind the barrel, and the purpose of
 receiver is to transfer ammunition from the feed system to the
 breech, and handle the recoil forces.

 Real bullpup conversions are made by removing the stock and
 placing the pistol grip and trigger mechanism in front of the
 feed system. A good example of bullpup-converted kalashnikov-
 style rifle is Valmet Rk.82, which is basically a converted M76.

 Note: for autoloading small arms, the minimum length of receiver
 is about 4 times the length of a single round of ammunition.
 Most pistols and bolt-action rifles have shorter receivers, about
 3 times the length of a round, but the slide or bolt will produce
 out of the receiver frame during loading.


 Bullpup Ranges:

 Because bullpup rifles have shorter sight radius than conventional
 rifles, they have shorter ranges if they use only iron sights.

 (using iron sights, range modifier is 0.9)

 However, when a bullpup rifle is equipped with optic, telescopic
 or electronic sights, which do not rely on sight radius, they
 have similar ranges as conventional rifles. Some modern bullpup
 rifles have a build-in optic sight and no iron sights.

 (using TL-9+ optic sight, range modifier is 1.3 * 1.15 = 1.495)

Both! I have been going back to ( almost ) first principles in order to see
how the formulas presented in FF&S were derived and to try and resolve the
glaring inconsistencies present in FF&S. At the same time there are certain
features of traveller\'s technological development that would NOT happen 
using
the FF&S rules, ( the viability of energy weapons is one ).

 ----
You said it! Our current understanding of energy weapons makes them 
inefficient
so high technology ( eg. \'gravitic focussing\' ) is required to make them 
work
in a way consistent with the background information. What is really strange 
is
the removal or imposition of additional limitations eg. lasers can have ANY
energy density on their focal arrays and are unable to focus their energy on 
a
spot smaller than 1 cm in diameter at ANY range!

 ----
Oops! You\'ve caught me here. Upon re-reading the energy weapon design rules
the ammo should remain at the size stated in the rules. However this doesn\'t
explain why CPR gun propellant is about 5 times as efficient at propelling
things as the plasma cartridges.

Hmmm the problem is that we are stuck with the hard science we know about 
NOW
not the hard science available several thousand years hence. I have tried to
stick with physics as far as I can and have come up with solutions that seem

be better balanced that he originals!

items I already have.
 
Therefore, I\'m expanding my collecting efforts to other sci-fi
and modern-era-adventure game systems, and I\'m resuming my
efforts to further build my sizeable fantasy collection as well..
 
If you have any roleplaying or related game products that you
find you are tired of or are not using anymore, email me a list,

    'body' => 'The thread about cyber-decking into the computers in traveller has so
far been interesting, but still I hope I never have to see a cyberpunk
module for it.

I don\'t think that a human (or other alien) operator would be able to
beat the virus in it\'s own environment. There are several reasons for
this. One of them (as Bryan Borich pointed out once) the virus will make
multiple copies of itself in the computer memory and saturate the
defence program of the operator/deck.

Then there is the reaction time. The oprator will be far too slow for
the virus either way. And the weak link is the interpreter between the
software and the wetware.

Then there is the time lag between the operator and the host machine
when it comes to communicating. This time depends on if the host is
local or remote, and how the connection is made.

Is the operator\'s mind in the host computer, or does the link fuction
something like the World Wide Web? This has a significance on how the
information is transmitted between the deck and the host computer. If
the link is more like the WWW on Internet, there will be an easily
traceable flow of information between the host and the deck. The deck
then converts these data for viewing through a neural-jack connected to
the skull/left nostril whatever. Thus all defences of the operator and
the deck is in the deck like a virus killer these days. This bring quite
a lot of communication lag, and the Virus will appear to "move" in fast
forward in relation to the operator. And for infecting the operator the
Virus only needs to send an egg with the communication stream. When this
egg is hardwired into the deck it is ready for junkyard.

But if the mind is "detached" from the body and transmitted to the host
computer the reaction time is increased manyfold, but the operator is
more vulnerable now than ever. This "mind" transmitting process is the
most common depicted for of netsurfing is cyberpunk books and games.

This "mind-transmitting" process may be done in two ways.

1. The "mind" is copied and sent out on its own. The physical operator
disconnects and awaits a signal from the deck when the task is done.

2. The mind is not copied but "disconnected" from the body. Note that
the disconnection is not fully, but enough to improve response time in
the net and still ensure that the body fuctions are active. A cut
of the link between the host and the operator will surely spell
braindamage or some other kind of injuries.

If the "mind " is sent out to explore the cyberspace, the host computer
must have software to allow this kind of communication protocol. The
Virus will most effectively protect itself by infecting this software
or deleting it all together. Thus you only got the old fashioned
keyboard/screen communication with the host. Maybe neither that if the

<Capital is clearly identified  as having a yellow G-class star not unlike
Sol.>

   I think that makes more sense, both game-wise and logically (why yes,
those two concepts can be mutually exclusive :-) )--especially given that the
Imperium was predominately a human empire.

<I don\'t know how solidly it\'s in the canon, but as far as I can tell, that
position is pretty bad for Aldebaran -- the angle  should place it closer to
Capella/more rimward than Cicero.>

   I will bring up the subject one more time with Dave Nilsen, but I promise
nothing.  While I am convinced that Cicero could _theoretically_  be the
location of Aldebaran, a more logical location would be further rimward, as
I had indicated previously.  As to whether Aldeberan should be closer
angle-wise to Capella, I don\'t know that\'s actually the case, but I have
friends of the astronomical persuasion who I can check with.

<Not that that\'s going to stop anyone, especially with the two-d sparsely
populated grid we pretend is a galactic map, but  somebody might want to
know.>

   Now see here, Mr. Bonneville.  Are you actually trying to say that the
map of known space we currently use for Traveller is <gasp> riddled with
errors?  That the maps only list at best half the stars (and that\'s being
generous) that are actually out there?  Are you implying that all those
little
DM (white dwarf type \'M\') companions we have all grown to ignore aren\'t
really there (or probably should be \'M\' main sequence)?  What are you
saying?!  Oh God, do you realize that you have just said the Traveller
equivalent of "there is no Santa Claus"?!!  <Mock Indignity furnished by
the Baseball Player\'s Union, who says we\'ll strike until we get our way, or
until there is no game left for future major leaguers to play>

   But seriously folks, my survey of the Solomani Rim shows that out to
about 5 parsecs, the stars are there as shown, with only minor corrections
necessary.  Beyond 5 parsecs, things get to be pretty dicey, and only the
well known stars (Capella, et. al.) are located "where they should be"
(Aldeberan possibly excluded).  Everything else is pretty much randomly
generated, using whatever stellar generation system was in place at the time.
 
   BTW, a typical white dwarf is NOT of \'M\' type from what my research
indicates, but is in fact of \'A\' or \'K\' type (though \'O\', \'B\', \'F\', and \'G\'
types can
be found).  This is certainly true out to about 50 light years, as listed in
Gilese\'s Catalog of Nearby Stars.  What\'s more, I have not found any
confirmed type \'M\' white dwarfs in my research (though I\'ve been told they
do exist--interesting that one of the most common stellar types in Traveller
can\'t be found nearby--but in defense of those who say they are there, they
would be particularly hard to spot because of their low luminosity).
White dwarfs are as likely to be solo stars as they are to be companions of
younger (?) types.  How bright they are is usually a function of how old
they are, and what they are emitting.  Many astronomers today don\'t even
classify white dwarfs by the OBAFGKM type, but instead use a three capital
letter system based on spectral characteristics.

Thus ends your Astronomy lesson for today,

I seem to recall a Philip K. Dick story, about an explorer ship landing on
a world.

Unfortunately, on this world, human artifacts tend to become murderous. 
One of the scenes in this story involve one of Our Heroes struggling with
an insane microscope, wrapping it\'s eyepiece around his neck.

This is said to be - possibily - the most funniest scenes in Science
Fiction. 

Later, they have to fight carpets, walking chairs, household appliances,
sentient hand blasters, their own clothing, etc. 

Another scene of technology run amok is in "The Mote in God\'s Eye", where
the baby moties -- ultra-intelligent critters, who have an impossible
aptitude for technology -- take control of the ship.  

Has anyone out there run a "Last Days" micro campaign at 1130, just when
the Virus hits?  Done right, I suspect that it would keep all involved in
stitches for quite a while to come...

I haven\'t gotten so used to the TNE battle rules that I can say wether a
character has a good chance of surviving a firefight in a battledress. I
will say that if any SF game portrays weapons in a remotely realistic
way then going into a firefight with properly equipped adversaries is a
really, really dangerous thing to do. This is, in fact, one of my main
problems with SF games: If I give my players the kind of weaponry they
could reasonably expect to be able to get hold of, then I either have to
let them walk all over the opposition (which is boring) or give the
opponents equivalent equipment, turning any firefight into a 50/50
survival chance (And players don\'t appreciate rolling up new characters
every other day  -  at least, mine don\'t, YMMV).
 
>while decking into virus infected cyperspace would be suicidal.

How do you know? We have no real idea about how a true omputer/brain
interface would work. That leaves us delightfully free to define our
own rules to provide maximum fun and entertainment. Unlike with weapons,
where we can reasonably extrapolate from know data (and where we come
up with instant-death-no-saving-throw pocket cannons at TLs only slightly
beyond what we have today (or even AT our present-day TL)) we really
don\'t know enough about how such an interface would work out to rule out
anything.

So instead of arguing about the difference between chemical and electronic
reaction times I\'d simply ask one question: What is the most fun? A virus 
that makes decking totally impossible or one that makes decking dangerous,
but survivable?

Assuming you agree that the second option has considerable more appeal
than the first, I\'d suggest that we turn the argument around and approach
it from the other direction: Given that we want human deckers to have a
fighting chance against the Virus, what rules and assumptions do we have
to make? 

You know, this could be a whole new approach to virus-proofing and virus-
protecting your systems. A computer/human combo with the human providing
the intelligence that we\'re told is the Virus\' main advantage over 
conventional computers. Gives a whole new luster to the profession of
Computer Operator.

 So write it!  I never intended RICE to be my private playground; 
 I\'d thought that I\'d made it clear that everyone who wants to can 
 come and play.  The only thing I ask is that the "standard" format 
 (as exemplified by my Glisten paper) be followed - and that only 
 for the world capsule data at the top.  And if you want, just 
 provide me with the body text and the one-line UWP listing, and 
 I\'ll generate the capsule data.  And the only reason I ask for 
 that is to present a "unified" appearance to the RICE papers - 
 which would only be expected in a similar situation here on 
 preJump Terra.

 Yes, and it would also have likely been the titular capital of the 
 Domain of Deneb, had Strephon, Paulo, or one of their predecessors 
 appointed an archduke for the domain.

T::>During the Rebellion period it was lost for a time to the Vargr Hordes,

 Which would likely leave a sizeable Vargr population on the 
 planet, making for an interesting culture in itself, not to 
 mention the things that can happen when two cultures meet.  Recall 
 the things I touched on in the Glisten paper concerning the 
 admixture of Glistenite human and ihatei Aslan cultures...

T::>Now, it stands in the Quarrentine Zone of the Regency, as a major base of

 Which will also have an effect on the culture - being on a 
 frontier has an effect on the psychology of a society - even (or 
 perhaps especially) when they weren\'t _always_ on the frontier.

 This would be a _very_ good planet to write a RICE Paper for.  I 
 hope someone does!

 Good question.  I\'d like to see the project/discussion

future emperor which was situated in Karaguuka. My players liked it very much
althought they didn\'t like the great distance and time that was necessary
to go to and back just for one adventure.

I can say that it was maybe even best published adventure (of that lenght)
I have ever run. But it had some illogical parts also.

1. Me and my players never figured out that how it was possible to get
that kind of marks and bodies with that amount of people (I think there 
should have been at least one more NPC) in Benghin\'s home.
2. How Commda\'s men were able to figure out what PCs were up to? My players
suspected that Brynhild Markuss was a traitor.

Anyway the adventure went well and party got back to Aubaine.

After that they took 2 missions to Seliga bone yard. Which I can mail if
there is enough interested replies. And now they are in Lebherz trying to get
back from smuggling mission. In fact I am planning to send them back to the
Karaguuka. 

One of my friends who don\'t actively play TNE is going to play TNE officials
in Karaguuka who are in charge of upgrading Karaguuka etc. and party is in
fact in his command. One other friend of mine is going to play some TED who
happens to run a planet quite near to Karaguuka and he has some relationship
with the Guild. That TED knows that some interstellar govenrnment is trying
to get hold of Karaguuka and takes it as a threat to him. So I suppose there
is going to be some interesting plotting between these two players and my
poor party is between them. To make thinks more interesting, one of PCs is
originally from that TED planet but the TED don\'t know it yet.

Because of this, I\'d like to hear if GDW is going to publish anything that
supports Karaguuka based campaigns like news or adventures. My party is in
year 1202 so I\'d like to know also if GDW is interested in knowing what 
happens in case they want to include part of it in news.

P.S. I\'d like to know the names of the planets of Diaspora sector I have most
     of the pre-collapse UWPs but almost no names. I need them desperately
     so please help me if you can.

Okay, you are right about going blind (in game), about all my players would
suicide or at least retire their characters if they got blind or severely
handicapped. That is of course if they can\'t get replacements. About going
mad
well that depends in fact insanities were the spice of Warhammer FRP as it
gave personality to characters and people really played them and enjoyed it.
But you are right that no one likes that their character goes raving lunatic.

BTW my players don\'t use battledresses!

That\'s what I mean, the deck is a new design, so the Virus is slow(er) when
trying to infect it. That means the deck have time to automatically log jockey
off line or at least warn the poor bastard that all the defences are down and
he/she/it should log out. That means you have time to save your ass before
the Virus infects you or your deck. So it\'s not a suicide! As you said the
Virus knows more about deck and decker next time someone tries to attack it
via cyberspace, but I doubt it usually won\'t tell what it knows to other
viruses because they compete for space to live. That might of course be 
different in Vampire Highway or someplace where Viruses have united or are 
same strain.

And what if Virus tries to infect human brain, do you think human brain is 
completely defenceless? Computer system is different, usually stupid system,
but human brains have one advantage, they are usually sentient. Besides brains
use only fraction of their capacity, so who knows what capabilities Virus
invasion awakens.

But don\'t you think the decks of TL 12 would be sophisticated enough to 
recognice the differences and alter decker\'s "universe" ie. cyberspace so
decker could comprehend the cyberspace quite similarly as any other system\'s
cyberspace. Of course decker have to work by thought when exploring the system
but when he/she/it has to fight the Virus with combat programs and defence
programs then I suppose the decker acts by instinct, like good professional
driver or soldier.

I made this suggestion for cases where this is possible, of course Virus
tries
to prevent that.

How about it now?

What about this? Have you thought about controlling vehicles or hooking
one member of the strike team to a radar or EMS? I think vehicles (like
tanks)
can be considered safe nets because Virus can infect them only via
communicators,
but if you connect the decker to comms by normal means like headset phones
and
microphones then there is no risk to get infection.

That would enable lower crew requirements. That would enable panzers like
in novel Hard Wired.

No one said that life was fair, even in the far future, characters should,
have
enough knoledge to know how to conduct themselves in a firefight, and if they
don\'t they soon learn (by rolling up new characters) ...

Worked for my characters and missjumps too ...

I\'m sorry to say that we do know enough about this kind of technology to make
"reasonable" assumptions about how it would work. If you look into a
phsycology
book you\'ll find nice electronic brain maps, showing which pit of the brain
dose what. Artificial arms and hands can be maid to move using mussle
movement
or electrical stimulation, and after a while the person only has to think
about
picking something up and the artificial hand will pick it up, just like a
real
one. This shows that a human can affectivly forget that they have an
artificial
limb, showing that an interface attached to the brain, although somewaht
different would still be excepted to be, and after a while, used with only a
little thought .... Advances in Virtual Veality, paralle processing, object
orientation and command interfaces which use the position of the eye as a
mouse with no keyboard commands means that we can have cyberspace NOW, as
long as
someone sits down and writes it ... replace the VR interface with a neural
jack,
and there we have it ...

That`s why there is decking in cyperpunk games, cos we understand in enough
to
know that is probably the next stage of computing ....

So ... we know enough to sit at our keyboards and argue about it, or throw
idears back and forth, so we can make the bits we don\'t realy understand more
beleivable ....

Traveller is a Hard Science games, that`s what FFS was all about, it bases
it\'s
rules on things we know about, to make the future realistic, and make playing
traveller more fun, by being realistic, appart from when grandfather pops up
with TL31 laser gloves, but that is stil beleivable because we know what type
of effect a laser of today would seem like to someone from the stone age ...
magic ...

What makes it fun for me is that it\'s beleivable, so when something isn\'t
beleivable it becomes, a game macanisum, and for me detracts from the game.
I can emagine myself, fighting the virus to reconcer the stars, with the
equipment that has been presented to me in TNE (apart from the fact that GW
totaly forgot about fiberoptic light switching computers, which virus could
infect but not hard wire it\'s self to, cos although they have silicon (glass)
it\'s not in the right form for the virus to live in .... no silicon chips
...)

You assume wrong, I don\'t find the second option considerably more appealing,
I find the fact that decking against a virus, would not be impossible, if
someone wanted to try it no one could stop them, it would just be suicidle,
instant death (to the conciuosness, if not actual death).

What I do find appealing is what would happen to the human when the virus
infected this suicidle decker, and that for me would have to be believable as
we know little or nothing about the virus and if it could send it\'s code into
the human brain ....

Very nice idear to give your computer operators greater controll over there
systems, fast info access etc ... in nice safe computers ... but the computer
operators wouldn\'t last long enough to disconnect themselves if the system
was infected with a virus.

So rules for decking against other human and alian deckers I would like, but
to deck against the virus would be suicidle ....

I\'ve not, yet, but to step back a bit -- what could fighters be useful for in

BR?  Does anyone have a design for a fighter that could make itself felt
against
capital ships in a fleet action, either singly or in groups?  They look kinda

useless, except perhaps as EW platforms or for picking off missiles.

On the other hand, some form of abstraction for other light combatants might
be 
handy when the big boys are at play.

What are the Leviathan fighter rules like (roughly)?

As another topic, does anyone know if GDW has published complete designs for
the
ships in BR  -- especially the old friends from the CT Fighting Ships
booklet?

So you plug your deck into the computer, as soon as you do the virus tries to
infect, by inserting it\'s code, not rewriting it\'s chip (just yet), the deck
them informs you that it has a virus in it, which means you have to
disconnect,
before the virus tries to send it\'s code into your brain, in probs just a bit
less than the speed of light. The virus only has dificulty controlling and
understanding the new systems, not actualy infecting them ....

This would be simmilar to how a cannarie works in the Equipment guide, the
deck
would be rather simmilar .... and if your not quick enough to disconnect your
head from the deck quickly enough ....

If the deck was to process and strip all incomming data, so as it wasn\'t a
virus
the decker wouldn\'t be quick enough to go past his deck into the infected
computer, which would make decking usless ....

It\'s still suicide ....

I\'d agree with you what only the vampire fleets would cooperate in the
passing
of the info .... maybe the sexual repuducing one\'s as well ... but once
learned
it would never be forgotten, so after one attempt to deck a virus infected
computer decking would become usless .... and then suicidle ....

I have no idea, this is what I would like to find out, cos once one of my
players decides to deck into a virus infected computer I want to know what,
will
happen to him. I do think though that the brain wouldn\'t stand a chance, as
we
have no experiance of infecting or disinfecting our own brain, as well deal
with
out of boadly invfections with white blood cells, and that\'s the only whay
the
brain knows how, enless your a psionic ...... This is were I get completly
lost cos I can\'t even emagine what psionics is about, although it\'s a
belivable
aspect of the game and I use it ....

TL12 v the virus .... no .... although the computer might be suffisticated
enough to find out the changes and present the decker with what he\'s used to
seing in cyperspace, by the time it\'s done that the virus is in your head,
cos
it\'s had enough time, to do the same thing as the deck, and add to the fact
that the virus is intellegent, and it would do it much faster than the deck,
and if the decker tried to do it the virus would be 3*10^5 times qiucker at
least .... see other posts on human brain speeds (thanks guys for the speed
clarification) .... you still stand no chance (I`ll pinch someone elses
phrase)
The decker it tost ....

A decker using defenceve programs ? he wouldn\'t even know if they would
work outside his deck, so although he might act on instinct, the programs he
uses might not work, like pointing a gun at someone and finding it won\'t fire
cos your under water, or it\'s frozen, or the barrel has warpped in the heat.
Pick a different analogy for each computer system you come accross, and you
should get my meaning. That\'s if the decker lasts more that the split second
the virus would take to infect him ....
 
> I made this suggestion for cases where this is possible, of course Virus tries

Right, assume you get to the computer to slow it down .... slow it down by
3*10^5 and you are on equal terms, and slower and you have the advantage. If
you could do this then it would be like a human trying to fight a shark with
spear gunns, which had the intellagence of a dolphin, and it\'s speed, in the
ocean .... not nice but possible, you found something that gives you about
the same chance as a firefight .... so decking on ### REALY SLOW ### 
computers against the virus, is not suicidle .... by the by, defecive progs
still might not work ....

Like it, now this is the decking in the game that would be safe, fun and worth
reffing, although the poor TED\'s wouldn\'t stand a chance. Jack into a laser or
plasma mount, find and pinpoint with EMS, put the laser sight on his head, fire
a cupple of rounds, and he\'s dead all in about 0.1 of a second. YES. You\'d only
have to think about putting the sight on his head and the stabalisers on the
gun mount would keep it there ....

Just so you know, I came to my conclusions from a star chart I have --
if you take the plane of the Milky Way as the plane of the 2d hex grid,
Aldebaran is in the same line-of-sight as the Hyades open cluster, and
on the other side of the Milky Way from Capella and Castor & Pollux.

Who me?  I\'d *never* imply that the map could be silly -- why they might
sic Grandfather on me, or worse yet, hand out a revised map that is
more accurate and three dimensional, and make us all do trig to figure
out jump distances (like another "Traveller" product that comes to
mind...).  

Seriously, normally it\'s no big deal, especially since it is only a two
dimensional map and the best we can usually do for a star is a general
direction and *very* rough range.  But it would be nice if Aldebaran
were a bit better, even though I\'m confident that explanations can be
made as to why it isn\'t in the Aldebaran sector-subsector.  And it
really shouldn\'t be too hard getting other objects like supergiants,
type W and O stars, and the like, near a sector at the rough range and
angle it should be at -- there aren\'t many of them nearby. It really
won\'t wound me too badly if they aren\'t there...but it would be cool,
and that sort of thing can add atmosphere to an area.

4mm TL14 Gauss Carbine (IISS)

The "IISS" Gauss Carbine was a high-tech, short-barreled weapon which
was apparently used by the Scout Service for certain special missions,
in particular by the Imperial Protection Detail (the "IISS Guard").  
Firing its\' half-gram round at 3800 mps, this weapon is similar in
performance to the standard tech-12 4mm gauss rifle in service with 
the Imperial armed forces, but with reduced range.

Interstellarms tried to interest the Scouts in a more modern 4500 mps
carbine, but it was rejected for wide-spread use on two major grounds.  
First, the older weapon is able to use standard gauss rifle magazines 
in a pinch, although it does not need all the power available in the 
magazine battery.  Second, the newer weapon was longer, too much so  
to meet a very specific and stringent length specification set by the 
Service.

DESIGNER\'S NOTES:
  1.  Watch out in the range determination rules not to choose both 
      "bullpup" and "two-handed".  This seems to be incorrect.
  2.  I found no clear instruction on how to reduce recoil for the
      tranquilizer rounds.  Estimates were made on how to do it from
      the existing weapons designs.  (Note that substitution of a 
      tech-12 gauss rifle magazine doesn\'t increase weight enough 
      to change the recoil figures.)
  3.  I believe all roundings have been done properly, but in many 
      cases, FF&S gives no clear guidelines.

This is all perfectly reasonable, of course.

Now, in the interests of being able to share computer aids, how about
these hypothetical situations:

   1) Let\'s say I write a programme for (e.g.) TNE vehicle design.  I
      want to distribute it freely, so I make the programme
      table-driven and require the user to provide a flat file
      containing the GDW tables.  This way all players can benefit
      from the programming and interface expertise, but at the same
      time it distributes no GDW material, requiring each user to buy
      that themselves and type it in.

   2) Let say I write a programme for (e.g.) TNE vehicle design,
      containing information from GDW copyright tables.  In the
      absence of an official GDW equivalent, how amenable might GDW be
      to distributing or licensing that, under the right
      circumstances?

   3) Say I OCR the GDW material for my own use for an on-line aid
      during my game.  If this is not distributed to anyone else, is
      this acceptable?  What if I personally have two computers, and
      put it on both -- one for access by players, one by me, during a
      game session -- is that still considered for my own personal
      use?

   4) What about freely distributed "Imperial encyclopedia" software
      that contains no data, but requires the user to OCR (or type in!)
      pages XX-XXX from their own copy of the GDW books?

Obviously hypothetical questions can\'t have definitive answers.  I\'m
just really throwing out some ideas -- Traveller (in whatever form) is
a game that is greatly enhanced by the availability and ease of use of
information aids, and if we could find an acceptable way to spread the
time and expertise around without infringing on copyright I think we
would all (GDW included) benefit.

You access ftp.mpgn.com anonymously.  There are two reasons why
you might not get on.  First and the most likely, is that the 
system was busy.  The site is one of the biggest gaming archives
in existance.  The other reason was if your name server was not
able to figure out who you were.  When you connect, we check with
your name server to verify your address, if it doesn\'t respond with
what you sent, you are not let in.

Actually, neural signals are passed by electro-chemical reactions.  These are
a _lot_ slower than lightspeed.  If course, electricty in copper wire is also
slower then lightspeed.  Even light in fibre-optic cables is slower than
light in a vaccuum (but still faster by several orders of magnitude than the
speed of signal propagation in nerves).

If I have to plug my damn head into my employer\'s computer system, I\'m going to
want more than 23p a mile travel allowance because we\'ve got a _lot_ of
cabling... Also, given our level of user expertise, someone\'s bound te delete me
as an unwanted file. I can see the phone messages: "Sorry, he\'s not at his disk,
he\'s out of his head." 

It seems to me that deckers and cyberspace fits much better into
Classic/Rebellion Traveller than NE, because in the New Era everyone tries to do
without computers as much as possible. But think of the Imperial systems...!

Hi,

I needed some help developing the Imperial Fleets in my campaign to help 
flesh out the TNE history. I\'ve listed some information on fleets. Would 
anyone care to venture what would happen (has happened) to them since the 
Rebellion started (ended)? 

I hope to purchase Batteriders and maybe set up scenarios to 
discover/play out possible outcomes of fleet actions. Also, for the 
Vampire Fleets since the Virus sourcebook is suppose to come out, maybe 
discuss what fleets fell pray to vampireism...

Anyways, here\'s what I have. I\'ve taken all the information from 
Rebellion Sourcebook and complied it here for ease of discussion. Please 
critique when possible. Thanks!

John Banagan [jbanagan@uclink2.berkeley.edu]

Fleets of the Imperium (c. 1116)

Fleets aare organized as follows:

Numbered Fleets are composed of squadrons (2-10 squadrons per fleet based 
on its mission). Each squadron is composed of 10-50 ships. Fleets 
therefore may range from 50-200 ships.

Named Fleets are composed of several number fleets and are named after 
the sector they are from.

In some circumstances, fleets are named beased on their mission (eg. 
Lucan\'s Vengeance Fleet or Dulinor\'s Loyal Fleet).

There are 2 basic fleet types, ships of the line and reserve fleets. Ships 
of the line are numbered 1-999 (there are approximately 320 numbered 
fleets), reserve fleets are numbered 1001-1999 (there are approximately 
320 fleets). Basically, for every ship of the line fleet, there will be a 
resrve fleet with the same corresponding number except the numbered 
reserve fleet will have \'reserve fleet\' after its numerical 
identification (eg. 212th and 1212th reserve fleet both at Regina). For 
simplicity\'s sake, I have only listed the line fleets (although the 
reserve fleet is at the same location).  

The alpha (although not part of fleet designation) refers to the 
subsector location.

Hi,

Does anyone have any suggestions on what ships would compose an Imperial 
Squadron? I\'ll post some of my own suggestions for this topic later. 
Also, I\'ll try and put some items out on Zhodani and Aslan fleet 
formations. I\'m not too sure about Hiver or K\'Kree fleets, and for I dubt 
a centralized military for Vargrs to have sector fleets like the 
Imperium/Regency has.

Hi,

Does GDW plan on producing supplements for TNE such as the Alien

FFS? I know there are a lot, and I\'m too lazy to convert them!  =P
Thanks.

My campaign is situated in RC. So far only political thing that my players
were involved, was when they returned from scouting mission from Seliga.
They were hired to escort and help one corporate suit of Tetsuno industries
from Aubaine to explore Seliga. Tetsuno had paid to get the "rights" to 
exploit the Seliga. Everything went quite smoothly for a while until they
noticed that they were not there alone. 

One member of the ruling class from Schall had also sent a private scavenger
team to Seliga. That team was quite ruthless and tried (of course) to kill
the PCs. Party got 2 prisoners and left the planet and returned to Aubaine.
There the council judged that member of the ruling class from Schall.
There Centrist wanted to imprison him, bet Federalists set him free but
sentenced him to get his workers from Seliga. He was also sentenced to be
cast away from his political position.

So nothing major.

Well, it\'s either totally unrealistic or perfectly plausible; science has not
yet discovered which, only that it has to be one or the other.

More detail, you say? Well, there\'s a theorem of cybernetics/information
theory
which states that EITHER no program can accurately determine, in all cases,
what system it is running on OR a program can change the system it is running
on by executing the right sequence of instructions, no matter what that
system
is.  No one knows how such a program would be written, nor whether it is
possible.  Conventional computer science says that it is not.  TNE says that
it
is, and that the chips of Cymbeline developed it by evolution.

It seems at least vaguely plausible to me that creating the right pattern of
current densities in space and time could cause dopant atoms in semiconductor
junctions to migrate, changing the electrical properties of the circuit.
Brute
force ("a tremendous amount of power and storage capacitance") could be
replaced by subtlety.  Note that this only applies to computers of sufficient
size and storage capacity, since the theorem as stated is only literally true
for Turing machines, which have infinite storage by definition.  Thus, dumb
computers are immune.

Greg Bear made use of the same idea in the novel _Eternity_, in which a
character with sophisticated implanted computers downloads an enemy AI into
them, then is "possessed" when it circumvents his defense programming.

Hope this makes sense in a helpful sort of way.

If you design the star system using the Book 6 expansion system (or its\'
descendants), you almost always get more worlds in the system with water.
Quite
often, you\'ll get one without population. What with that and ice asteroids
(and
gas giants of course) ships seldom have to dip from the oceans of a populated
world with a dodgy ecology. Also, the technology required to terraform worlds
to
the extent done in Traveller (I mean, some of these planets are simply
uninhabitable as written) could arrange some sort of replacement (perhaps a
rain
of ice asteroids - see short story by Arthur C Clarke). Now that would make a
good hiring ticket for a scientific party...

An average planet (size 5, hydrographics 5) has 1.28E+14 square meters of
water
surface.  Therefore, it would take 1.28E+12 cubic meters of water loss to
lower
the water level by one centimeter.

Assuming that an average starship has 5000 cubic meters of fuel tankage, and
refills 26 times per year, it would take 9.85E+9 starship-years to lower the
water level by one centimeter, or 2.7 million starships per year over the
roughly 3500 years between now and Traveller.  Even a heavily-used port will
never see anything approximating this level of use.

Ergo, don\'t worry about it.

As I explained in a previous post, assuming that Virus is based on the
appropriate theorems of cybernetics, it must be able to modify *any*
hardware--silicon, glass, flesh and blood, gears and pulleys--by executing
the
right sequence of instructions.  Under this interpretation, the Cymbeline
chips
are merely the hardware on which the Virus first evolved.

I think GDW could stand to explain this a little more clearly; a sidebar
going
into about as much detail as I just have wouldn\'t hurt.  (Are you listening,
Loren? :-)

Let\'s get something straightened out in this discussion.  I\'ve seen a couple
of 
references to the virus getting "inside" the human brain (and fartzing around
in there, perhaps in our "unused" portion).

While possible (as anything is) I cannot see this happening at the Tech
levels of
TNE.  The Virus is limited to the electronic pathways of silicon and metal.
Any
movement outside this realm would require a different technology.

"Wait a minute" you say, "we\'re talking about \'jacking in\' to your computer
and controlling it direct from the mind!".  

Lets look at this from the "Hard Science" perspective advocated by the above
poster.

Currently we can map electrical (Extremely low voltage) activity of the
firing
of neurons in our brains.  Experiments have been done by electrically
stimulating
certain areas of the brain.  These caused certain specific sensations or
recollections
in the test subjects, but the same sensation or recollection was not
repeatable.

At Some Point (my guess; TL 11) we will be able to control these direct
electrical 
stimulations to create the illusion of "cyberspace" popularized by Gibson et
al.  The
control of the emvironment thus created will be conducted (at TL11) by
eyeball movements,
and vocalization/subvocalization, and hand controllers.

The point is, nothing is "entering" the brain.  Carefully controlled
electrical 
stimulation is creating a "virtual illusion" of sorts in the user\'s mind\'s
eye.
control is not direct-from-brain, it *is* by methods more flexible than a
keyboard
("Keyboard, how quaint").

The virus could, upon occupying the deck, subject the character to all manner
of 
nightmarish images, sounds, smells, and perhaps even feelings.  I would
expect
this to be more effective for the virus than trying to electrocute the victim
since several safety "fuses" (or 21st century equiv.) exist between the deck
and
the "jack".

The most insidious and intelligent virus would make it look as though all is
well
(and that the character won whatever battle with the virus was being fought)
and 
sinply occupy the deck, altering the normal perceptions of the decker to what
the virus wanted him/her to see, until they got to a situation where the
virus\'
action could kill them all off.

"I\'m tapped into the complex\'s security net"

"Well, tell us how many guards are behind this door"

"The Scanner says they\'re all on the other side of the base, some kind of
emergency"

"Ok, open the door."  (door opens) "OH SHIT!" (Sounds of gunfire, rocket
fire, grenade
fire, fusion gun discharge, light & Heavy Machine guns, crew served
howitzers, etc.)

Actual brain-to-computer communication I would not allow until Psionics as a
science
(as opposed to psionics as a talent) was developed.  With the key to psionics
would
come the ability to communicate directly with the brain.

intrigued with the concept when my group first got involved with TNE. Then
I began to realize how totally impossible the Virus propagation examples
are: silicon based lifeforms rewriting the etched circuits. How could this
happen when Virus is transmitted as pure data?  How does the \'hardware\'
component of Virus get across to the other system to re-etch the silicon?
What about gallium arsenide?  What about optical logic?

I have overcome these inconsistencies by remembering that Traveller is
science \'fiction\'.  Ok.

Now, I have been reading all of this speculation about Virus infecting
people through direct neural interface.  There have been many ideas
expressed about how a person could combat Virus \'in its own environment\'.
Here are my thoughts:

1) The most plausible idea expressed so far is that Virus would fry a
   person by sending a power surge directly through the interface and
   into their brain.

   This might be a likely outcome; however, a group of smart PCs could
   possible add a surge suppressor to the DNI link.  (Of course, Virus
   could send input into a brain which could cause the brain to overload
   itself, kind of like how epilepsy does).

As far as human infection by Virus goes:

2) It is either impossible for Virus to infect people or DNI would
   make no difference anyhow.

   Here is my argument: Virus can be propagated through ANY
   transmission medium. ANY!  (Remember Virus can infect a computer
   by encrypting itself onto printed matter and then unsuspecting
   people can scan that material into their computer and infect it).

   By this reasoning, people operating or communicating with an infected
   computer could become infected just by visual input from computer
   terminals, etc.

   DNI might provide a more efficient infection mechanism, but it is not
   necessary for people to become infected by Virus.

So either Virus cannot infect the brain or computer use of any kind is
extremely dangerous.  Since there is no indication that anyone has ever
become infected by Virus through these indirect means, then I submit it
as highly unlikely that the brain is susceptible to Virus infection.

Humm, maybe this isn\'t taking the long look on things (at least far enough),
but did you notice how much water it takes to power a fusion plant? The 
resources used are darn near negligable, at least compared to the amount of
"water" you could go through for reaction mass after splitting it down to
hydrogren.

Then there\'s always belt mining, gas giant skimming, or scrambling for 
water in Oort cloud. While the rules make this "not as feasible" for TNE
players, it\'s certainly a valid option, and you can bet the massive tankers
run stations around a gas giant and routinely skim for Hydrogen there to
create the reserves for the fuel resevoirs on planet.

Oh - my players have a 100ton scout that runs on 15kl of hydrogren a year.
Not much compared to the 210kl or so it takes for a jump that lasts
seven days...

Dear Mr. Wiseman...


First: Thanks for the correct address.

Second: An apology is in order regarding GDW\'s use of \'race/culture\'.  I
        believe that I made some snide remark regarding \'tokens\' that was
        later proven to be unjustified.  Sorry.


Now, regarding my list of \'improvements\' to GDW\'s format...

      
>> Dear GDW:
>> Could you consider adding the following items to the basic

>> A) Life Paths for PC\'s and NPC\'s?

All right.  Basically, my beef is in the history of characters.  The
current history generation is excellent regarding skill generation, and
adequate with \'contacts\' from the PC\'s previous carrer\'s.

However, I\'m left wondering were are the PC\'s families, non-adventuring
friends, and their place in the \'social fabric\' in society.  Who are their
enemies?  Do they have a \'family tradition\' to uphold?  What are their
political biases?  Do they have a religious quest to pursue?  (I always
wanted to see a group of Vargr make the pilgrimage to Mecca from the
Regency...)

A case _can_ be made that the drives of the PC should be left to the
role-players, not to the dice.  I would respond that the role-players
could design the motives of the PC from scratch, and some (who are good at
character visualization) SHOULD do so.  But others (like me ;) would be
more pleased to generate a skeletion of the PC\'s soul, and build up from
there, rather than deal with a blank tablet.

Moreover, this \'life path\' would discourage role-players from simply
making the PC \'themselves\', just teleported to 5700 AD.  It would remind
them that this is a different man, in a different age.  The role-playing
experience would be made richer for it.

Admittedly, in a game of such wide scope as Traveller TNE, these things
can only be indicated in a generalized way.  Don\'t worry about it, leave
the universe-specific details to us....   The life-path system would at least
indicate that this is an area not to be overlooked.

O.K.  Anyways, this could be built up via life-paths.  
(Incidentally, I have never seen a life path system, but I understand the
Idea, and could draw up one myself for posting on TML.  An idea there...)

Understood.  

Just don\'t forget: some of us Travellers are explorers first.  While
there\'s -No Way- you could do the job justice in the main TML book, I
await eagerly for the day the job _is_ done properly.

(THAT supplement would be as eagerly sought as the World Builder\'s
Handbook/World Tamer\'s Guide, I bet!)

Yep, Sleep Tubes - inspired by a Japanese hotel, which rent\'s out a box,
similar to the cabinets in a morgue, for people to sleep in for the night
- is a house rule, for ships too bloody small for a stateroom, but which
still have long-term missions.  I just cut the small stateroom stat\'s in
half for the numbers. (actually, I should cut them to 25%, considering the
space...)

(incidentally, the japanese have made these boxes quite comfortable, with
a padded mattress, a small T.V., and a small shelf too.  Hey, it\'s better
then a hamlock...)

They *are* missiles.  You don\'t expend them, but they could be used in 
combat much as missiles are.  They have some advantages, too.  You can
give them heavier armor and more g-turns for maneuverability.  Missiles
may make 12G acceleration, but they only have 12 g-turns using the 
standard designs.  Furthermore, fighters are reusable, not just from
combat to combat, but from *turn to turn* in combat -- they can fire
many times.  They can also usually fire from greater ranges, which 
helps to offset the size disadvantage they have.  They\'re a bit more
flexible -- you can use them as air cover for ground troops, which is
harder to do with a disposable nuclear missile.  

The disadvantage is that they are manned and also more expensive.  But
they may be somewhat safer from "Virus" infection because of the human
oversight.  They are also in a bigger size class than missiles.
Another minor problem seems to be that launch and recovery times for
launch tubes seem to have gone up from High Guard in FF&S.

Well, the use that comes to mind right away is as missile launcher/guidance
platforms.
Some of the Imperial Navy carriers carried hundreds of fighters.  Imagine 
a few hundred missles heading RIGHT FOR YOUR SHIP! ;-)

Of course, I\'d love to say "P\'shaw, the dampers will take care of that", but
thus far GDW has been operating as if the only dampers are the "same-hex, 
only-good-versus-one-missle" turret- and barbette-mounted dampers, ignoring:

     1) Brilliant Lances explicitly stated that the dampers on larger ships
        could make damping attempts against all incoming missles, but the
         rules in BR makes no provision for this;

      2) using FF&S, you can make dampers with whatever range you want,
         say, for example, ten hexes.  However, in neither BL nor BR are
there
         any rules for actually USING dampers with that kind of range.

several of the tables are step functions.  With ship size, for example, a
ship 
of 99,999 tons is L (-3 in BR), while one more ton makes you VL (-4).

In a strategic campaign, the first ship of a class could be put through a
trials
process which will determine how well the design works out.  For each step 
function table (as decided by the ref)  the followins task is resolved when
the 
ship is submitted for trials:

To Round a value in designers favour: Average, Ships Architecture

Value is following % to next value     shift diff up or down as required by:
       25%                                        -1

       99%                                         +3

Success: round as player desires (up or down) (99,999 ton ship is L (-3) or
(-4)
as designer wishes).

Critical success:  ship two levels as desiger desires (eg - 99,999 ton ship
is M
(-2), L(-3), VL(-4) or G(-5) as designer wishes.

Failure and catastrophic failure: Shift opposite to designer\'s wishes.  

This could use some refinement, but at least it brings some uncertainty to
the 
design process which reflect the world.

The effect of ship size is a complex one: for example, it effects (in BR) the

number of batteries, the target attributes for detection and firing, and the 
ability to absorb damage.  These could be rounded independently.


In a strategic game, having a brilliant designer is a real advantage -- and 
that, I think, reflects realiy: look at the importance of aircraft design
teams 
on WWII aircraft, or of British naval architects on the leadup to WWI.

comments, please.

BTW: A month or so ago I proposed a TCS PBeM.  Four folks signed up, and I
then 
disappeared on them.  I am terribly sorry, but I had a severe attack of 
deadlines and could not put in any time on anything else.

Are you still out there, are you still interested?  Is anyone elese
interested. 
If so, things are saner now and we can try again.   BR will be used for
combat 
resolution, which simplifies ship design (surface locations and damage
locations
need not be assigned).  With all the fuss about copyright, I think it would
be 
best if you have a copy of the TCS and FF&S rules.  Then I can just send TNE 
related mods to the TCS rules.

Navy structure.  The following in a section of a "White Paper"
I did for my PCs describing military structure, doctrine and
strategy for the Imperium, the Solomani and the Zhodani.  My
version of Imperial doctrine seems to differ from the GDW canon
in two repects; Subsector fleets are called Groups, and the Imperial
Army is a National Guard formation.  The Marines are the regular
Imperial ground force, while the Army exists only as some 
corps-level HQ units.  When the Duke needs more firepower, he
has to mobilize planetary army units to fill out the Imperial Army
forces.  Note that the ground units also include specialized COACC
and wet naval forces.

Imperial Naval Doctrine
The Imperium has the largest fleet in known space, 
with more than 1,000 squadrons organized into 50-plus
fleets and independent entities.  Imperial fleets are
made up of 1 or more Groups, each of which is made up of 
3 or more squadrons.  In smaller or less-populated Sectors, 
there might be a small fleet, made up of one Group with 
three Squadrons.  In Sectors that are likely to be attacked, 
there are often 3 or more fleets, each with 3 or 4 Groups 
of up to 10 Squadrons each.  Each Sector has at least 1 
Fleet assigned to it.

A Squadron generally consists of 8 to 12 ships.  Some of the 
ships are support or communications vessels, and the rest make 
up the \'line\' of the Squadron.  For example, a typical Heavy 
Battle Squadron (HBatRon) would consist of 1 Dreadnaught, 2 
Battleships, 4 Battlecruisers, 2 Fleet Couriers and 1 Squadron 
Tender.  The Fleet Couriers and Squadron Tender would be the 
support element, while the Dreadnaught, Battleships and 
Battlecruisers would be the Squadron line.

A Group is a collection of Squadrons, usually organized around 
some large ship or important Squadron.  For example, a Battle 
Group would be formed around a HBatRon, while a Carrier Group 
would be formed around a Fleet Carrier Squadron (FCarRon).  The 
Imperium also has Assault Groups, Raid Groups, Patrol Groups, 
Transport Groups, Support Groups and even a few Recon Groups.  
Each Group will have its own Group Support Squadron in addition 
to its component Squadrons; this unit would have a number of 
couriers, tenders and perhaps troop transports or hospital ships.  
Squadrons are often reassigned to other Groups at various times, 
or even to other Fleets.

A Fleet is a collection of Groups, usually organized along mission 
lines as necessitated by the needs of the Sector the Fleet is based 
in, or on the conditions around the Sector.  In some sectors, the 
Fleet might consist of a Patrol Group of only three Squadrons.  A 
Fleet generally has a few Squadrons of attached elements, with 
couriers, tenders and some troop transports, but this varies by Fleet.

All Imperial Depots house a Reserve Fleet, made up of overage and 
reserve vessels stored there.  Reserve Fleets are generally used 
for training activities and to support Depot operations, but in the 
event of a crisis they could be used to provide replacements for 
regular Fleets, or could be mobilized into action as a Regular 
Fleet in its own right.  

Many worlds of the Imperium field military starships.  These ships 
are all subject to mobilization in the Colonial Navy, an ad-hoc 
organization formed when the Sector or Domain Duke mobilizes 
non-Imperial starships and mercenary warships.  In general, most 
of these ships tend to be patrol ships or smaller combatants, so 
mobilized Colonial Squadrons are most often used to form a single 
Sector-wide Colonial Fleet, which would usually be used for 
rear-area security.  Those mobilized ships which are stronger 
combatants will either be used to support Colonial Fleet operations, 
or may be combined into Colonial Squadrons attached to 
combat-oriented Imperial Fleets.

Imperial doctrine has changed over the past 200 years.  Formerly, 
the Imperial Navy was geared toward offensive actions.  Imperial 
fleets were configured for rapid raiding operations, with enough 
heavy firepower to tie down defenders while the raids were 
undertaken.  The goal was to cripple an enemy\'s economy and 
military infrastructure to the point that it collapsed, leaving 
the enemy frontier defenseless.

This began to change in the face of wars with the Zhodani 
Consulate and other foreign powers.  The Imperium had been 
successfully attacked in the past, but these were minor 
raids by pirates and small splinter groups within the Imperium.  
The new situation was that the Imperium had an active, hostile 
enemies on several borders (Zhodani, Aslan) and rebellious 
elements within another border region (Solomani Autonomous 
Region).  This new reality caused the Imperial Navy to realign 
itself towards a more defensive role.  The Imperium did not 
give up its offensive capabilities; but offense was no longer 
the focus of Imperial design.  Large, high-jump vessels were 
replaced with large, high-firepower vessels.  Lighter raiding 
ships remained part of the Imperial Navy structure, but these 
were no longer supported by larger ships in their penetration 
raids.

The Solomani Rim War caught the Imperium in the midst of this 
change.  The Solomani fleet, made up of former Imperial personnel 
and equipment, shared a similar doctrine, but was more oriented 
towards offense due to Solomani cultural biases, and due to the 
inability of the Solomani economy to support a protracted 
attritional defense.  The Solomani sphere was badly hurt by 
small-scale Imperial raiders, but the rimward portions of the 
Imperium were even more devastated.  The result was a tie; both 
sides withdrew in the hopes of rebuilding enough strength to 
finish the job, but the horror of the conflict made the armistice 
a more permanent treaty.  To the Vilani-dominated Imperial Naval 
Staff of that time, this only proved the need for a more 
defense-oriented military structure, and spelled an end to the 
Solomani-influenced emphasis on raiding tactics in the Imperial Navy.  
Thereafter, raids would be but minor sideshows in Imperial Navy 
thinking.

The modern Imperial Navy philosophy is to use overwhelming 
firepower and numbers to break any attack, and to then counterattack
against the now-disorganized enemy forces.  This is made possible 
by the fantastic logistical advantage of the Imperium.  The Imperium 
is three times larger than the other interstellar states, and has a 
huge industrial and manpower potential the other states can only 
dream of.  This means the Imperium can send fleets from quiet 
Sectors to trouble areas, and rapidly build replacement ships or 
even fleets.  Obviously, the Imperial Navy cannot be at all border 
points at once, so the philosophy envisions a defense in depth, 
buying time until sufficient forces are gathered to make a stand, 
after which the lost territory will be regained (with possibly more 
territory being claimed in the process).

There is an ad in Challenge 74 about the shirts, with the artwork that\'s 
on the shirt.  I asked GDW if they have any other designs, but Loren said 
that the design featured in Challenge is the only one currently available.

It\'s on page 20, Challenge 74:

On the left, there is a man\'s head in a battledress, under him there is a 
the front part of a RCES clipper, above the clipper there is a group of 
RCES (what looks like RCES marines...) in BD.  to the right of the RCES 
group there is a a big design of eyes in the dark (like the ad for the 
vimpare Source book style)  above the eyes, there is the Traveller: The 
New Era logo...

Hope I helped, take a look at Challenge 74 for a better desciption..

 Where do I begin? For FF&S, as I said, there is a complete "1st
 printing to 2nd printing" update to appear in Challenge.Brilliant
 Lances has an eratta sheet. Battle Rider does not yet have one,
 but it is in preparation.

 P Proefrock, in Digest #29, provides an answer which is pretty
 much in-line with the GDW position, which is: No, while the MFD
 is operational, you don\'t need gunners, but if you don\'t have
 gunners, a single hit (on the MFD) can effectively wipe out every
 turret.

 He did indeed say it, and the date is accurate. The seminar

 AM in the booth, demos, or other seminars. Everybody laughed at
 the joke, and the seminar went another three hours. A great time

 That\'s because it is a political decision, not an economic one.
 A close reading of the various RC materials will reveal that
 technological uplift programs are indeed underway, but these take

 Re: water
 
 This has come up a few times before. We feel that in most
 cases, the amount of water starships remove is insignificant to a
 world\'s total supply. There would be some political problems with
 refueling on Desert worlds, I would think, simply because the
 natives would not want a single drop removed. Consider how many
 ships it would take to use up a cubic kilometer of water, and
 what a vanishingly small percentage of the total water on earth
 that would be.

 Every reasonable person I\'ve talked to agrees with you.
 
 BTW, I am informed that "publish" can have some interesting
 meanings in the context of copyrights: For example, if I buy an
 original manuscript of Heinlein\'s _The Moon is a Harsh Mistress_,
 it would be mine as a physical object. I could read it, keep it
 in a glass case in my living room, I could use it as a doorstop,
 but I couldn\'t publish it without permission from the copyright
 holder. I couldn\'t print 100,000 copies and distribute it to
 bookstores, I couldn\'t run off a few photocopies for personal
 friends, I couldn\'t read it onto tape, and (here\'s where it gets
 interesting) I couldn\'t even put it on public display _because
 that, too, is considered publishing_. The intricacies of the law
 are a continuing source of wonder to me.

 GDW is currently talking with several companies about
 electronic licenses, including play aids of various kinds. This
 is one reason why we must be conservative about who we let do
 what with our copyrights.

 This one is kind of murky. Some software companies demand that
 you buy a separate program (word processor or DTP set-up for
 example) for each computer that the program will be used on,
 others do not. GDW occasionally grants "copy for your own use"
 privileges for things like character generation sheets and forms
 of various sorts, but these are always specifically spelled out
 in writing. I\'m not sure exactly where something like this would
 fall, but my own (non-lawyer\'s) opinion is that it would be
 considered your own use provided you didn\'t put it on something
 like a 10-20 machine network at your place of employment, or that
 the second computer you "own" happens to be at someone elses\'s
 house.

 We agree.
 
 A very similar problem has been plaguing science fiction
 writers for years -- the casual hi-jacking of characters and
 backgrounds by fans who write stories using these characters and
 backgrounds and publish them in fanzines, APAs, or (more
 recently) post them to various electronic media. The authors\'
 position (and one that has been upheld by the courts, I am told)
 is that a character or a background represents a substantial
 proprietary asset, which the author has a right to control.

 This argument could be made, and referees who wish to implement
 some kind of rule to this effect are free to do so.
 
 We wanted users of battledress to be able to survive combat
 relatively intact, but we did not make them totally unbeatable.
 We feel that the blunt trauma rule combined with the rules for
 knockdown and stun add an element to combat (with battledress, it
 is tough to kill you outright, but you can be rendered _hors de
 combat_ for a few turns under the right conditions) that is worth
 keeping.

Money. Look at the cost of your design and then the scout/courier and then

the map\'ll tell you whether there\'s fuel - and (I rule anyway) you can scan a

You\'re missing the point. People (at least, I and every rpg\'er I\'ve ever
talked with) play rpgs to be heroes. We don\'t play them to be ordinary
joes. Now, there are two kinds of role models for heroes: fictional and
real. Fictional heroes take desperate chances and survive. How many 
times have I read about a hero taking a 1 in 10 chance of surviving and 
succeeding? Many! And why do they succeed? Because the author is on his
side. We\'ve also heard of real life heroes who survived against desperate
odds. How can that be? Easy. We never (almost never) hear of the poor 
bastards who took the same chances and failed. For every real life hero
there are hundreds of real life loosers.

You try one day to run a 1990 spy campaign or something and equip both
PCs and their opponents with highpowered rifles with laser sights and 
see how much (and how long) your players enjoy that. 

How long do you think a PC hero would survive taking realistic chances?
Not long enough to be any fun. So a rpg _can\'t_ be realistic if it\'s to
fulfil it\'s function. The best kind of rpgs give the illusion of being
realistic, but PCs need to be able to survive making heroic choices.
Not always, and not automatically, but certainly more often than real life
people survive making heroic choices. Make it 9 chances in 10 to survive
and you have the making of a fun game. But spare me anything approaching
true realism.

But it\'s all assumptions. You don\'t need to accept those assumptions. It\'s
even easier to disregard assumptions than it is to disregard facts, and
Traveller disregards lots of facts. (Like the fact that anyone hit by a 
functioning laser weapon runs a grave risk of getting blinded even if he 
isn\'t killed. Like the fact that the chance of hitting someone at 6 meters
distance is considerably different from the chance of hitting them at 50
meters distance.)

Replace the VR interface with a neural jack and, as it turns out, all those

There\'s decking in cyberpunk games because William Gibson invented decking
and cyberpunk. Not because anyone KNOWS how it would work. Noone knows for
sure.

I couldn\'t disagree with you more. What\'s important in _any_ game is that
the rules are CONSISTENT, not that they are realistic. A player need to
feel confident that the rules won\'t chance under his feet. By using the
rules of the real life universe (except when inconvenient) you gain an 
awful lot of consistency for very little effort. That\'s why realism is
generally a good thing. But whenever realism interferes with the game
experience, out is should go. Like when we use FLT drives or make the
galaxy flat (how\'s that for realism, btw?).

Your privilledge.

But don\'t, please don\'t, talk about "facts" when you express your notions
of how decking works or how the virus works. The only facts there are 
about those subjects are what each of us decides he wants to assume. (OK, 
about the virus whatever GDW says is fact as long as we want to adhere to 
the GDW Traveller universe, but as soon as we are willing to deviate those 
facts become debatable too).

>So rules for decking against other human and alian deckers I would like, but
>to deck against the virus would be suicidal ....

OK, Ewan, in your universe decking against the virus is suicidal. I accept
that. 

Now, does anyone else want to discuss how things could work out so it 
wasn\'t invariably suicidal to deck against the virus? 

(See you in another discussion, Ewan. A spin-off about how realistic
Traveller really is, perhaps?).

As laser platforms, you have a problems with the actual potential to do
damage. 
Could you put a laser on a fighter (a sub-100 ton 1-3 man platform) with more

than 1 or 2 (BR) damage points?  If you can\'t, how can they do effective
damage 
against a capital ship? Play bloody hell with the screen, though.

With the missile loads some of the other ships carry, this looks looks a
normal 
state of affairs... :-)

Nevertheless, this use of fighters makes more sense to me.  And you should
have 
better odds of getting an FC lock since you have cuddled up close to the
target.

Outside of fleet actions, fighters would be handy as "space control" ships --

doing long range patrols, customs look-overs, etc.
 
As far as fighter rules goes, I have a couple of thoughts:

Fighters always operate in flights of (say) 5-16.  Targetted as a unit - diff

mods for quantity.  DV/2 (say) is number killed.  All take same action (fire
at 
same target, launch missles, etc.) missile spread looses missiles as flight 
looses fighters.  

Treated as one ship for sensor, some sort of cumulative rules for jamming,
sesor
activity, etc.

Could have fun with rules for opposing fighters in same hex with same vector 
using evasion G\'s to "dogfight".  Maybe special rules for same hex/vector as 
target - no boarding, but some sort of "Star Wars" style close attack rule 
(didn\'t JTAS have a set of HG optional rules on those lines long ago and far 
away?)

I\'ll give this a try and report back.

I would not be two keen on this as a solution to copyright hassles.  Pretty 
soon, some lad will realize that he could give it to his buddy WITH the table

that he had typed in, and you would be in the soup.

Even if your software prompts "enter the mass of a range 10 TL 13 beam
pointer 
(page xx, line xxx)" every time it recalculates, you have still lodged the 
formulas in your system.

By the time you have stripped out everything naughty from your design aid,
you 
have written a spreasheet program!!.

The only good soultion is for GDW to cut a deal for a competent commercial 
implementation.  Mac and Windows, please, guys -- real soon now, and I will 
gladly pay good money for it.

1.) Have you ever heard of Neuro-Linguistic Programming, Pete? Less

2.) Furthermore, if you assume "strong AI" (which all the Traveller technical

    computer? By feeding it data containing "eggs".  Why shouldn\'t a
    particularly sophisticated strain be able to feed "eggs" over the total
    sensorimotor link you describe?

When dealing with biological viruses, there is a world of difference,
infectiousness-wise, between handling an object that has been in contact with
an object handled by an infected person, and being sneezed on by that person.

To make use of your argument, the Virus would have to encode its entire
structure into a stimulus (video clip, printed document, whatever) in such a
subtle way that the target person\'s ego defense mechanisms would not trigger.
Such an encoding would require vast amounts of computer power to accomplish,
as
well as much more knowledge of the human mind/brain than even Grandfather
possesses.

To infect someone via DNI, on the other hand, could be much simpler, as the
Virus needn\'t try to slip past the human\'s defense mechanisms, but can just
steamroller right over them (total sensory deprivation and the ability to
project any desired stimulus with all five senses make a powerful arsenal).

Let it be noted that I\'m just playing Devil\'s Advocate here.  I wouldn\'t let
the Virus infect a human brain in my game, because it wouldn\'t be fun.  I can
justify that position just as easily as I am justifying the opposite.  This
is
all pseudoscience anyway.

Taking that attitude means asking a couple of questions. How does Virus
infect 
and operate?
My own assumption is using an analogue  of todays computer. It has fast
memory 
(RAM) and slow memory (Disk). When Virus infects it writes onto disk but does

not use announce this new area to the operating system. For it to be
activated 
that area of disk must be accessed, it then loads itself into RAM and runs 
amok. Thus when you shut down the computer the Virus is still there waiting
to 
be reactivated. A smart Virus would of course make sure that it\'s hooked up
to 
run almost immediately the machine is re-started. But this can be stopped, or

how else would people be able to disinfect computers.

If that first assumpution is accepted then it is feasible to stop Virus
running 
in RAM. Thus making it very slow. As it has to etch it\'s new circuits to cope

with whatever the player is doing. Let\'s face it, Virus normally plants an
egg. 
Not a complete copy of itself. This would make Virus slow, unable to respond 
well to new situations and vulnerable. As if Virus can etch itself onto
circuit 
boards, surely a player can erase this part of the circuit board.

It then comes down to an SOP for deckers;
1. Switch off the compter.
2. Reboot the computer with your program to stop Virus getting into RAM.
Could 
be as simple as a memory hog (my own preference is Word Perfect for Windows).
3. Deck in and start hunting for Virus. I imagine this like a dungeon  
adventure. The decker explores down strange corridor (circuits) and
encounters 
dangerous monsters (Virus).

This would make decking very much a role playing setting, rather than a 
technical one.

CONCERNING DECKPLANS FOR TRAVELLER: TNE SHIPS
----
 
I ran a game session not too long ago where the pirate PC\'s
assaulted just such a vessel as described above.  The deckplans
proved to be essential in playing out the firefight that ensued
after they boarded the ship.  It is unfortunate that the New Era
does not provide this level of development support for its ships,
but since most of its ships are carry-overs from earlier versions
of the Traveller game system, the deckplans are floating around
out there somewhere, generally as out-of-print collectibles.
 
The following starships, which were included in the main
TNE rulebook, also had their deckplans originally published by
fasa:
 
    The Lurushaar Kilaalum Class Type T Patrol Cruiser (Adv.
    Class Ships Vol. II), and the
 
    Lord Somerset Class Type M Subsidized Liner (Adv. Class Ships
    Vol. II).
 
    Both came with illustrations, stats, background, and
    deckplans.

Rather interesting thread on fighters in BR.  It\'ll be interesting to see
what GDW comes up with on their fighter supplement to BR.

On the other hand I\'ve been toying with the idea of the Kinetic energy weapon
for use in space combat.  Using a stock TL-12 semi-independent missile as a
base, I replaced its nuclear detonation warhead (400 kg) with 400 1 kg dumb
shots.  Assuming the missile were able to utilize all 8 G-turns (w/o losses
for maneuvering, dogleg profile, etc) any projectile that hits will
have a peneteration value of about 508 (see FF&S pg 140).  

If this penetration value can be treated as a particle beam
penetration value it make this type of weapon exteremely
effective in BL.  Some additional considerations:

1. Due to the lack of maneuverability of the shots, missiles carrying
this type of warhead will have to approach very close to their target.
But what about a heavily armored fighter?  What are it\'s chances?

2. In an attack where four such missiles are ripple fired and were
able to release their payload before intercept.  There will be 1600
targets heading towards the target.  Depending on the range of
release, there will be dispersion due to the bursting charge and
target motion.  How many of these shots can be expected to hit?  Will
the onboard fire control be able to determine fast enough how many of
these are on a likely intercept course, compute firing solutions and
perform a successfull intercept?

3. Okay, with the same situtation as (2.) but triple the mass of each
shot by adding a smart seeker warhead and course correction thrusters
(a.k.a.  brilliant pebble).  This reduce the number inbound to about
466 but a much higher percentage will be within the intercept basket.
How will this affect the ability to intercept or evade?
 
4. Above scenario decribes an attack from a single platform.  How
can a defense be set up against a coordinated attack from multiple
platforms?  (Three ships/fighters ripple firing 4 missiles each can
put 4800 dumb shot or 1600 brilliant pebble inbound!)

Incidentally the penetration value is a function of the vector of the
target.  A tail chase approach will reduce the effective penetration
value while a headon approach will increase it.

Comments, opinions, suggestions?

When it comes to the multi-hex damper, why not use one to shut down, say, a

Re: Cultural/Ethnic Diversity in the Imperium

I think it is there.  I believe that in various planets, you have 
more of an Ethnic concentration of one sort or another. Note: that\'s 
concentration, not sole example. For example, on Zhonguo, ethnic chinese
features probably dominate - but not entirely.  Do remember
that a  major chunk of the Imperium\'s population are ethnic Vilani 
(who look a lot like caucasians).  Some have galanglicized names - 
done as a way to get ahead in a Terran/Sylean dominated Imperium. 
Given a few centuries and some interbreeding, who would know the
difference?

For that matter, I\'d wager that further back, during Terra\'s 
expansion into the second Imperium, an amount of Anglicizing took 
place among those who wanted their parents to get ahead within the
(apparently) US or British dominated administration. So, a chunk of
the "Smith", "Jones", or "McIntyre" families, if you go far enough
back into the past (3000 years or so) may have been named Schmidt, Zhong, or
Makatira.

I\'d imagine that the color issue kind of pales a bit when you start
dealing with "We of Terra vs all those others."  Or, at least, 
that\'s the face turned to others... To my mind, the lack of ethnic
description and the lack of religious discussion at all are ways of 
not stepping on toes or getting cultural statements in the way of 
the adventuring.  Makes a good marketing decision.

Re: Power armor

Output: I\'d believe that the output would be a set number for each
suit. The owner\'s strength would merely operate the waldos.  
Consistent output allows any average set of men to become supermen.
It also provides the commander of a unit of battledress troops with
constant, known troop capabilities.

Stopability: BD is stopable.  Why else would there still be vehicles
at TL14/15 if BD was unstopable? BD is an advantage, but only that.
BD troops hurt by TL6 weapons (or TL2 catapults)? Certainly. However,
they have a number of advantages that allow them to hurt the lower
tech opponents before thay can be hurt. They take casualties in minisule
proportions.  But none? Nope.  They are not invulnerable.
And remember that your PCs invariably fight in small unit actions...

seriously), and even military types (Space Marine figures are pretty good),
but there are many very nice illustrations in the canon of animals that my

I\'d love to see (and would immediately buy) the 25mm Grenadier figures

work out a deal with them to re-release these figures.

As far as aliens, I\'d like to see the major races first.  The Aslan and
Hiver figures are a good start (but the quality isn\'t quite up to
Grenadier\'s Aslan and Hiver), but let\'s please have Vargr and Droyne.

As for vehicles, I\'m looking for the Kinunir, the xboat tender and xboats,
the Broadsword 800-ton mercenary cruiser, the Shivva class patrol frigate
(see Adventure 4: Leviathan, and probably Adventure 3: Research Station
Gamma), and the Azhanti High Lightning, and preferably all in the same

----
Okay, I\'ve got your point, thanks! BTW I primarily I meant that starship
fuelling takes much water, not "normal" fusion plants.

DNI & Virus
----
As far as I know the Virus can\'t infect anything indirctly. That means by
any sensor (including eyes and EMS). Therefore if it is only way that Virus
could infect human brain, then there is no danger for that. I agree that
Virus could send some impuls that could cause epileptical fits or heart
attack.
It is of course possible to use electirical fuses to prevent great electrical
shocks, but the drawback is that when the fuse goes down then the decker
"jacks out". I\'m not any kind of expert in the field of electronics, but
don\'t
you think that it is possible to make circuitry that draws excess current
away from DNI? I don\'t know so please tell me.

And what comes to those pulses that can cause fits or heart attcks, I think
this is where defencive programs comes in. In fact those programs are in 
*cyberdeck* not in target computer and they work as far as the deck
works,IMHO.

In TNE or in some article in Challenge is said that defencive programs of 
pre-collapse era slowed down infection attempts of Virus. Therefore I believe
that defencive programs of post-collapse era can stop the Virus infection
totally or at least slow it significantly. When this is added to the fact
that
decker can "infect" chips of Virus, then decker has at least 50/50 chances
against Virus. Right?

Even if you would not accept that defence progs can defeat Virus it can\'t
infect brains. That is because brains are biological, as I was rightly 
corrected about nervecells they are electro-CHEMICAL. Therefore Virus can\'t
burn the new circuitry into the brain. 

Fleets
----
As I have only run TNE and I am not familiar with Megatravelle or Classic 
Traveller I don\'t know much about Rebellion. But as you can see from the
TNE book p.79 Core, Fornast and Ley Sector are about totally inside the Black
Curtain. Therefore fleets in these sectors are very likely infected by Virus.
Althought it would be great plot to have one or two ship(s) inside the Black
Curtain which were free from infection and their crews trying to get out of
there. Otherwise I don\'t have a slightest idea, sorry.

Exploration
----
Just how you run exploration adventures? I mean how you input some excitement
to those anventure?  

I\'d like to see a sample exploration adventure.

Dungeon syndroma
----
Transmission: Dungeon syndroma is spread by game situation or problem that is
              too difficult for players to handle. It is also known to infect
              paties that have no idea what to do next plus if referee
doesn\'t
              have an idea also.

Symptoms: Players look bored and angry. They don\'t know what to do and
propably
          just talk to each other about anything exept current session. And
          if they happen to try to play then they make pathetic moves and
          usually very violent attempts to solve problems set by GM.

Diagnosis: Easy refereeing.

Misdiagnosis: Players are not interested about your adventure or are fed up
              with their characters.

Treatment: GM can arrange a firefight or some other relating action to get
           players\' attention. After that he can give some hints about
problems
           so playing session can continue.

           Players can also arrange action by themselves but chances are that
           they end up dead, but that\'s the only way to handle Dungeon
syndroma
           without GM\'s help.

Course of Disease:

           Incubation: 1d6 hours
           Phase I: 1d6 minutes
           Phase II: 1d6 minutes

Failed Recovery Death Probability: 9

Postrecovery Debility: With treatment, none; without, possibly termination of
           campaign.

Note: I have suffered from this Dungeon syndroma, about all my fellow players
      have also suffered from this disease. Almost all the cases were found
      among the players of certain Role Master campaigns. They usually ended
      up total annihilation of our party (our GM was really sadistic one).
      When we were last time playing it our GM really went nuts because he
      thought that we couldn\'t play good enough! I suppose it meant
termination
      of that campaign.

  I\'m trying to "build" a city for a campaign that I\'m running.
  The city has the downport component of a class A starport.  I 
  have some questions about designing this port:

  1) An airport has a landing area (the runways) and a service 
  area (hangars/terminals).  A seaport combines the two (into the 
  dock).  Which model should I follow with a starport?

  2) Should I assume that _all_ starships, shuttles, etc., that use 
  the starport are VTOL-capable?  If not, then I obviously have to 
  follow the airport model.  If so, the question is still open.

  3) For ships that use Newtonain reaction mass for takeoffs and 
  landings, how much of a clear area around the vessel itself 
  should I allow?

  4) How big should I make the "parking" zones for the ships, and 
  how far apart?

  Once I have these questions answered, I think I can construct the 
  starport sensibly, and then make a decision on the physical 
  relationship between the starport proper, the extrality zone, and 
  the planetary city.  But I\'m willing to listen to any comments 
  that anyone else has on this topic...

The Airport model is acutally a little better.  But a lot depends on
the planet.  For instance, one world (from a published GDW product, 
though which one slips my mind) with a \'C\' atmosphere, brought the
ships inside the planet.  Some star ports will have big open areas
that the ships reside in, others will have docking bays.  In Asmov\'s
Foundation series, the Starport at Trantor was of a docking bay config.
The ships were in the star port, and the people on Trantor never left
the concreate and steel of the capital. 

Depending on the local tech level, you will have either run ways, or
lifters or both.  Some SciFi (which I use) have large magnetic/tractor
beams that reach up into space and pull the starship down, and lift it 
back into space.  So you can get by with not having run ways.  Also it
has been implied that some starships (and ships boats) can hover, also
eliminating the need for long runways.

>   4) How big should I make the "parking" zones for the ships, and

You should plan to be able to support the largest starship that YOU
intend to do.  You could say, that for this world, ships over 1000T
have to use the orbital facility.  You can then plan your space needs
accordingly.

I didn\'t say they\'d do much good against a capital ship, just that 
fighters were essentially big missiles.  (With the caveat that there
are a lot of other ways to use fighters than that way, as I mentioned
in my posting.)  As mentioned in Battle Rider, missiles shouldn\'t be
able to hurt capital ships much either.  The rules were fiddled so
that instead of having missiles do 1D6 hits at DV 2, they do one hit
at DV 1D6 (i.e., a 20 to 200 point laser!), for reasons of game play
and atmosphere.  Draw your own conclusions from that.

If we follow the missile spread rules:
  * The squadron is detected and targeted as a whole.
  * However, one beam may only fire at one fighter.  Several beams may
     fire at the same fighter.  (Think about it; this makes a lot of sense.)

What does this sound like?  A task force.  The difference is, a successful
detection on a task force spots one ship, while a successful detection on
a spread spots all the missiles.  Presumably, the spread is in a tighter
formation than a task force.  There probably shouldn\'t be any hard and fast
rule on the number of fighters in a flight here, just like task forces and
missile spreads.  There\'s good enough tactical reason to keep the flights
small anyway, especially if you treat a squadron like a missile spread.

>Treated as one ship for sensor, some sort of cumulative rules for jamming, 
>sesor activity, etc.

I\'m not sure exactly how this would be worked out, but semi-independent 
missiles can each do their own detection.  However, if we can use the 
standard BL rules too, the fighters could hand off successful target locks
to each other.  I don\'t know if BR has provision for that.

Oh, goody -- let\'s wait for the wonderful company folks to deign to give us
poor peons permission to PAY for someone else\'s hackwork that probably
doesn\'t work as well as something you or I could write, and certainly won\'t
have exactly the features I want.  I\'ll program anything I damn well please,
thank you, and I\'ll give it to anyone I feel like giving it to.  *I* still
live in a free country!  How about you?  Did you move to this strange
Corporate-Ruled state where all the netrunners cower in fear of the dreaded
TSR and GDW (and Palladium, and etc.,etc) copyright lawyers?  A lot of silly,
gutless people seem to think they have.

As for copyright and trademark issues, (1) see my comments above about math
formulas & tables, (2) it could be argued that both TSR and GDW\'s worlds,
formats, ship designs and anything else that they think is infringeable in
public domain net material has ALREADY BEEN IN CIRCULATION WITHOUT CHALLENGE
FOR SO LONG THAT IT HAS SLIPPED INTO THE PUBLIC DOMAIN!  The Net Spell books
have been around at least 10+ years on the Internet... so have Traveller ship
designs and Sector data files.  If those are trademarks, they\'re public
domain by now.  If they were created by someone not at GDW (i.e.,
gamer-developed ship designs), the copyright isn\'t GDW\'s to complain about.
(3) Look-and-feel is still legally ambiguous as grounds for claiming
copyright infringement -- legal cases have gone both ways.  (4) Are TSR &
GDW\'s copyright lawyers familiar with the legal decision involving Nintendo
and that company that made an in-line add-on for Nintendo games that allowed
players to modify characters and game conditions?  Nintendo lost the
infringement suit because it was not shown that the add-on hurt Nintendo\'s
sales in any way -- rather the opposite.  Any of the game companies would
have a hard time proving that computer utilities to assist in playing their
games are criminally infringing their copyrights  when said utilities are
more likely to help their sales than hurt them.  (5) I don\'t know if the
folks at GDW are just "me-tooing" TSR\'s heavy-handed stance on copyrights of
net material, but they should be aware that TSR is apparently pulling a "deep
pockets" bluff -- i.e., "I can afford more lawyers than you can, so you\'ll
back off even if you are in the right".  The legal issues involving
copyrights of various net materials are very iffy -- infringement is not so
certain as TSR and GDW seem to want us to think.

Yeah, lawyers are scary, and they send menacing letters.  They also bluff.
 Most people are so scared of legal entanglements, they won\'t stop to
consider if they are actually in the right, but will just knuckled under and
do anything the lawyer demands to avoid trouble.  That\'s the way companies
with a budget for lawyers push the average guy around...

You could have great fun with this.  Given the small size and lack of sensor 
signature
 for these iron balls, you could (with luck and good intelligence info)
launch 
a cloud
 of balls from far beyond sensor range.  The luckless target would not even know to
 navigate out of the way.  Stationary clouds of iron balls could be unleashed in
 inconvenient places; imagine a lone accelerating heavy fighter fleeing in front of
 several pursuing and accelerating enemy SDBs.  As it flies, it dumps a load of balls
 (hi-tech caltrops).  Most balls would miss, but the few that hit would be most
 spectacular in terms of damage.  This would mean that the balls would be around
 forever, but they would maintain the velocity and vector from release time.

The SDBs fly by an hour later, now moving much faster in relation to the balls.

BANG! 
 Big ugly dents and other semi-pyrotechnic events ensue.

These would work even better as planetary defense weapons.  They could be
 placed into strategic orbits by orbiting satellites or from planetary defense 
missiles. 
 This would force assault ships to change vectors to avoid the balls (messing up the
 jump troops\' drop patterns or planetary attack missile runs).  If the attackers don\'t
 see or ignore the balls, they will be damaged or destroyed.  This is easier in a
 planetary defense role since the defender knows which orbits would be the most
 likely for attackers to use for dropping troops or ordanance, and so could block
 those accordingly.

I think this could actually be more damaging than Ed suggests, if both the ball and
 the target are in motion.  I think the velocities would be multiplied (WARNING:  NOT
 A PHYSICS MAJOR).  Maybe some kind, math-capable person could come up with
 a formula to derive the penetration/damage value of this, based on target velocity,
 ball velocity, ball volume and ball material from the FF&S Material table. 

A hypothetical question for Loren (re: Copyrights and Publishing)

If I have an infinite number of monkeys using an infinite number of typewriters,
 working at creating a duplicate of some Shakespeare work, and they instead come
 up with the Battle Rider rules and show them to me, can the monkeys be sued?

 Also, if they should come up with the Striker II rules before GDW published them,
 does that mean I get to sue GDW?  I sure hope so; somebody\'s got to pay to clean
 up after these damn monkeys!

As I conceded to John earlier that emplyment does make sense to me (except I 
would rate a hit with DV>2 as a one hit kill).  However, AV 1 is not a capital 
ship, AV 10 is more along the right lines.  

Can this ship actually control all 4 of its missiles?  My reading of the FF&S/BR
rules seems to indicate the need for a crewman at a missile control station, and
that even SIMs need to be controlled to fire. (I\'ll buy one lad in the back 
seat, but beyond that I recall the Rampart as a fairly small little toy).

Or, to cut it another way, what is this puppy buying you that a 9-point CVM 
Valor is not?

Pointwise, though, I would rate the tonage of a fighter flight based on the 
square root of the total tonnage of the flight -- after all, it is only one unit
of maneuver.

Wan\'t to try it on?  Joe Heck has offered to moderate PBeMail Battle Rider, and 
these things are always best tested in combat.

Heres a thought:

at the scale of 30000km per hex, a 1 kg object moving at 1 hex per 30
mintues turn will have a energy of 139Mj. times 4 to get a base
penetration value of 556.   For each additional hex per turn this 
value is doubled once. (for example: 2 hex per turn then 2 x
556 = 1112, 3 hex per turn then 2 x (2 x 139) = 2224)

Use the relative velocity between the projetile and the target to
determine the above value.  Also in additional to the velocity
multiplier, multiply the result by the mass of the projetile in kilograms.
(again w/the 3 hex per turn projetile: 1kg then PV=2224, 0.5kg then PV=1112

This can be more effective then ...spinal mounts!?

Les Howie-Ship Design Trials:
     A similar thing was done years ago with High Guard in the Cluster TCS

Roger Myhre-TL 15 Battledress:
     You EEDIOT!
     The Rigid Body Armour Table lists the mass of armour PER ARMOUR FACTOR 
per location. In addition armour factors greater than the materials 
toughness require double this mass per additional armpour factor.
eg. For your TL  15 BD made from BSD ( toughness = 28 )
mass of head and full torso armour to AV 30 is 32x1.95=62.4 kg
mass of arms and legs armour to AV 28 is 28x2.4=67.2 kg
total armour mass=129.6 kg.
This is a bit more than what you had and really eats into the 200 kg of 
"spare" mass.

Actually, I don\'t live in the same country as you do.  I also depend on sales
of
copyrighted software to pay my rent, and buy my groceries, so I probably feel
a 
bit diffently about copyright than you do.

Ah, a true anarchist..:-).   Really, you may well be right, BUT, I think we
have
to balance what we do and share freely with what might hurt the revenues of
GDW 
-- and I while I would not feel too bad about ripping off, say, Microsoft,
GDW 
is just a small group of people who have managed to make a living on a small 
market with tight margins.  They deserve praise, support, and nurturing, lest

they go the way of the dodo and SPI.

Copyright laws are there to promote the just treatment of those who live by 
their creativity, and I for one feel that both the letter and the spirit of 
those laws deserve respect.

Actually they are a lot less scarry here.  Canadian lawyers, thank God, have
to 
work flat fee, not percentage -- a real bane of the American legal system.
And 
I very much doubt that GDW has a terribly great budget for lawyers.  I\'m just

not going to interfere with their livelihood.

<Eventually, yes, fleets would get from the quiet sectors, but, as far as
holding off the Zhodani and the Solomani in the short term, those regions
are on their own for years.>

   Well, months perhaps, but not years.  The Imperium wasn\'t quite _that_
big (unless you\'re talking about sending the Old Expanses Fleet to the
Spinward Marches, then we\'re talking serious time lag there).  The Corridor
Fleet is a good example of a "fire brigade" force, which was stationed two
sectors away, but saved the bacon of the Spinward Marches more than
once.  True, the Corridor Sector wasn\'t exactly quiet, but the principle
is the same.

<Subject: Starports>

  <1) An airport has a landing area (the runways) and a service 
  area (hangars/terminals).  A seaport combines the two (into the 
  dock).  Which model should I follow with a starport?>

   Both.  Actually an orbitable facility would probably look more like a
seaport, and a planet-side facility some hybrid in between.  A lot depends
on what kind of ships will be landing there.  If there are quite a few
designs
that employ thrusters but no contragrav, having runways for those craft
makes a lot sense, since although they can theoretically land straight down,
such landings take much more fuel.  So if you have the land area (or can
build it artifically) it makes sense to have at least one runway.

  <2) Should I assume that _all_ starships, shuttles, etc., that use 
  the starport are VTOL-capable?  If not, then I obviously have to 
  follow the airport model.  If so, the question is still open.>

   Depends on the design of the spacecraft--though most if not all do.
I recently designed a TL 12 fighter that has no contragrav, but has an
airframe hull so that it can land on the surface.

  3) For ships that use Newtonain reaction mass for takeoffs and 
  landings, how much of a clear area around the vessel itself 
  should I allow?

   A good model is an aircraft carrier, which generally employ some sort of
blast shield in back of the aircraft as it takes off.  If I may be so bold as
to
refer to another universe, I recall in the movie Star Wars that the Mos
Eisley spaceport had special bays for craft which were sealed off from the
rest of the facility when a spacecraft was taking off.  I remember in the
novel that they were refered to as being bowl shaped, and obviously they
open at the top.  Size would depend upon the what size ships were to
routinely use the facility.  Size-wise, the area for a typical small craft
bay
on a starship would be as good as any.

  4) How big should I make the "parking" zones for the ships, and 
  how far apart?

   Being that a starport is a commerical facility, I would try to maximize
the number of craft I could get into the space available, while trying to
keep safety in mind.  If you have noted the spacing at a typical airport
or dock, they get them packed in pretty good, but also have large amounts
of clearance up to the actual gate/dock facility itself so that the
plane/vessel
has plenty of area to manuever so that it can position itself properly.

   Additional note: In your design, please allow for extra lanes of traffic
coming into the airport!  :-)

<Yeah, lawyers are scary, and they send menacing letters.  They also bluff.
 Most people are so scared of legal entanglements, they won\'t stop to
consider if they are actually in the right, but will just knuckled under and
do
anything the lawyer demands to avoid trouble.  That\'s the way companies
with a budget for lawyers push the average guy around...>

   There was a guy in the news a while back who decided he wasn\'t going
to pay taxes anymore because, he decided, that the system was "voluntary"
(a horrible misinterpretation of the law, BTW).  He was perfectly safe until
he wrote a book about it and starting touring the country preaching tax
revolt.  As soon as he had accumlated some wealth doing this, wham! the
IRS and the FBI came down on him hard with a laundry list of charges.

   It comes down basically to a question of risk.

   The fact is that if you put together a game aid, and give a few copies to
friends, GDW or TSR are very unlikely to hear about it, let alone consider
legal action.  If you decide to post a gaming aid on a local BBS or sell some
copies of it at the local game store, it is possible that GDW or TSR could
find out about it, and would look at it for copyright infringement--your
chances of getting sued are still slim, but increased, due to the possibility
that they might make an example of you.  If you are bold enough to post
your gaming aid to Internet, or sell it by mail, it is almost inevitable (if
your
product is of high quality) that GDW or TSR will find out about it, and look
_very_ closely for copyright infringement.  If they can track down the
source, you stand a good chance of getting a "nastygram" from the
company, followed by another from a lawyer if you don\'t stop publication
or remove your work from the Internet.  If the company thinks what
you have done is sufficently damaging, they _will_ sue--not so that they can
take your car and house, but so that they can make sure you won\'t continue
your copyright infringement.  The last thing these companies want is
to force some middle-class family out on the street and then have them 
crying to the press about the big, bad, ugly corporation.  Ask any major
company that ever won a case and then lost more in sales than they won
in the settlement due to negative publicity about that.

   The reality of it is that most people can\'t afford to consult with an
attorney about things that really matter in their life, let alone over
something that is a hobby.  I can\'t believe that any of the people who
frequent this board (game companies executive and staff excluded) plan on
or are making a living producing game aids for Traveller, which means
that we are all hobbyists (if you are still unsure, ask the IRS--having
published work does not make you a professional writer).  Using copyrighted
material in a game aid involves risk, particularly if you are not trying to
market it to GDW, but instead decide to go it alone (either selling copies
or giving them away).  

   Chances are, Cynthia, and GDW won\'t tell you this, you won\'t get caught.
Like that guy who announced to the world that he wasn\'t paying his taxes,
however, the fact that you posted your intentions on TML to distribute a
game aid that contains copyrighted material (if I understood you correctly),
means that you have just substantially increased the chances you will be
getting that "nastygram" from GDW.  Hope you have the name of a
good attorney in your address book, just in case, if you go ahead with your
plans (no threat, real or implied here, just reality).  

   The nature of today\'s legal climate is that you can be right, but lose
the case--and even if you don\'t lose, you\'re out big bucks.  I don\'t think
you
can afford it, and neither can I.

   The chances of your monkeys coming up with an exact duplicate of the

other discover \'X\', credit is given to both scientists for discovery, even if
one found \'X\' a few days before the other guy--provided that guy \'B\' (who
finished his process a few days late), worked without knowledge of what
guy \'A\' was doing (that is the exact processes, etc.).

   In the case of copyright, you have to show that your monkeys came up
with their version of Battlerider _without knowledge of GDW\'s version_. 
The all important burden of proof would be on _you_, not GDW in this
case.  If you don\'t have hard evidence that you started your version of
Battlerider prior to GDW making their version public, you will almost
certainly lose. 

   On the other hand, let\'s say some hack songwriter sues Michael Jackson
for stealing a song.  To win, the songwriter must prove that the songs are
identical (or virtually identical, there are after all, only a limited number
of
musical notes and ways to arrange them in common useage), and the
songwriter must have hard evidence that he/she wrote the song before
Michael recorded his version.  

   GDW would almost certainly be able to prove your monkey\'s work is
essentially similar to theirs, and although your monkeys may not know
Battlerider from Oscar Wilde, that does not matter, since GDW has long
since published Battlerider, and can produce evidence that it was in the
works long before your version came about.  Unless one of your monkeys
is an 81 year old grandmother, GDW will be able to shut down your
monkey sweat shop without so much as a hint of sweat on their lawyer\'s
brow.

Posting here is fine.  Loren & Co at GDW Support said that they would also
be happy to forward this information, so posting lets both GDW and me
know.  Like Glen, I am a big fan of the old Grenadier minis (especially the
Adventurers and Alien Adventurers sets).  However, I am fairly pleased with
the RAFM figures.  The only exception has been the RAFM aliens, which
have ranged from OK (the Aslan) to hideous (the Hiver).  As for the ships, I
am most ecstatic.  I have already made whining sounds about wanting
Rampart fighters, a Mercenary Cruiser, a Kinunir Cruiser, a Midu Agaashaam
destroyer and an Azhanti High Lightning.  One can only hope.  I just don\'t
know how an AHL Cruiser can be done in 1:1200 scale, which is what
RAFM is trying to stick to.  I want one anyway, even if it is larger than
several Battle Rider hexes.

Wow! the TML has really surged back to life, probably has something to do 
with the new school year.  Anyway.....

A while back someone posted a fix for Plasma and Fusion weapons their main
problems being poor range and effectiveness.  I would like to initiate a
discuussion on this topic, (unless GDW has already corrected it) so that
we can come to some sort of consensus on these weapons.  I breifly toyed 
with it last night before calling it quits.

The problem is this, the high energy weapon design sequences as they 
stand make great sense.  I mean the logic behind it is very appealing and 
perhaps realistic BUT.....If they are only as effective as the FF&S rules 
make them out to be, no one would ever build them much less employ them 
in combat.  Only a total moron would.  I believe someone said this 
earlier.  I beleive GDW also realizes this and as such there werent any 
HE weapons in Challenge 74.  I dont know about other supplements as I 
havent purchased them yet. (Just give me time.)

Just some of my suggestions....
 The cartridges deliver plenty of energy but maybe this could be 
increased based upon the fact that it is a one use weapon type cartridge 
and as such can discharge more rapidly and efficiently?

 A TL 12 PPC about the size of a 120mm cartridge will deliver 13.5 
MJ but by the FF&S rules will have a PEN of 44 at short range.  This is 
compared to a PEN of about 120 for a 120mm HEAP round at TL 8.  I\'ll take 
that M1 versus that RC grav tank please!.  

 I say that realism is important.  But since this ultimately is 
science FICTION, things can be bent slightly.  For me the plasma and 
fusion guns always filled that sci-fi niche of the blaster.  That do-all 
BFG blow a hole in the wall thundercracker.  Remember high technology for 
high tech sake is pure insanity especially when you get half the 
effectiveness for ten times the price.  

I wonder if GDW plans to address this? (Anyone see this?)
Or if they already have...In which case I retract everything above.

HOLLOW POINTS?
Any ideas, I was thinking of adding a D6 to the damage value and dropping 
the pen by one at all ranges.

WEAPON EFFECTIVENESS AND DIFFERENTIATION
I know that some people use D10s for damage, I was toying with the idea 
of using D6s but dividing by 10 instead of 15   you know  SQRT(ME)/15.
This would produce greater differentiation in weapons of considerably 
different real world performance.  Drawback is that more dice would get 
through armor.  Need more dice too.  Oh well.

I think thats enough on this topic for today, next post will be on 
material of a less technical nature.

I once looked at this after I bought Brilliant Lances, the expense, size 
and mass of the standard missiles was the primary culprit.  I tried to 
come up with a rule that would determine hit difficulty based upon the 
aspect of the target relative to the fire.  Head on shots being the 
easiest and so forth.  My impression was the the speeds of ships in BL 
were well into the KM/S range, 1 hex/turn = 30,000 km/turn=1,000 km/m = 
16 km/s=16000 m/s.  With a 1kg projectile this gives an energy of 
0.5*1*16000^2 or about 128 MJ!  And thats at minimum speed!  However 
common materiel would not survive such an impact and would most likely 
vaporize on impact with the surface of the target.  Still it would make 
for interesting fireworks.  I wonder if you fired a bunch of these from 
within the same hex at a fast(non maneuvering) target would you have a 
better than 0 chance of a hit.  Maybe.  I should point out that BL and MT 
space combat ranges have always been a bit long for my tastes.  Hitting a 
moving target at beyond 600,000 km seems sort of implausible.  I guess 
the classic Sci-Fi space battle where you fire a two dozen times to get 
one hit is at work.

I am not prepared to calculate hit probabilities, a 30,000 km hex has a 
lot of space.  The nasty thing about this weapon is that these things 
would be floating around for quite a while, representing a significant 
hazard to navigation.

About hazards to navigation.  Anyone figured a way to cheapify Nuke 
pumped X-Ray lasers to make space mines feasible?


DROPPING BALLS FROM ORBIT.

Another thing that would be an interesting discussion topic is orbital 
bombardment.  One day I\'ll set out to design a submunition releasing 
missile that fits the standard missile tube.  You could pack quite a few 
submunitions in one of those monsters.  Even better you just have orbital 
monitors with nothing but hundreds of tubes filled with metal spikes with 
re-entry bodies and little terminal seeker heads.  Remeber the Thor 
satellites from Renegade Legion.  They would have to dropped from low 
orbit (500km) for accuracy sake and if they were aerodynamic they wouldnt 
have reached terminal velocity by the time they reach the surface.  This 
create problems for your seekers/guidance if so but a little drag on it.  
Anyone know the drag coeffecient for a ceramic coated steel cone?

Even a very small ship could carry a good wallop for special forces down 
on the planet.  Recovery mission in trouble?  I shall call upon the wrath 
of the skies!  (15 min later if youre still alive!) A big hole where the 
TEDs whatever was.

I think thats much more than enough from me today, I\'ll continue this 
thread tomorrow.

I agree about the "play and atmosphere" point, of course BR sacrifices a lot
of 
the detailed effects of small weapons surface hits, such as sensor system 
degradation.  Mr. Chadwick is right, I think, in saying that you should not
be 
able to ignore a missile (they go up to (1/25) 79 in the the FF&S tables,
after 
all).  When you deploy large ships in BL, how well do the fighters stack up?
Do
they deserve some "fiddling" as well?

I would certainly agree with handing off sensor locks around the flight.  
Probably also with transfering missile control within a spread from 1 flight,
so
you would not have to track which fighter the missile came from.   I would be

inclined to do single detection and fc locks with numbers providing some sort
of
diff mod, just to cut down on the card turning.

Exploration is my favorite type of adventure.  First, you need players that
really enjoy discovering new things and _not_ shooting them.  Make it clear
that this is an exploration adventure, not the lead-in to an
"alien-will-rip-your-face-off-when-you\'re-not-looking" adventure.

Second, you need to understand how exploration _and_ remote sensing work. 
Read up on it, especially if your players have scientific training.  One of
my players is a biologist, so I have to be _very_ careful when I design
ecologies.  (It helps that she has agreed to explain to me my mistakes
privately, so I can let her know which anomalies are clues and which are
mistakes without spoiling the group\'s fun.)  I am an engineer, so my
remote-sensing technologies are usually ok, but I\'ve played in games where I
knew more than the referee and he wouldn\'t listen.  This is a real downer to
a player.  (Example I\'m thinking of, our \'sensors\' said the atmosphere was
\'tainted\'.  No indication of what the taint was, indeed, of what the
composition was, without going down.  Of course, any reasonable ship would
have a spectrometer and so could get a very good idea of gases from orbit. 
The \'tainted\' designation is a considered judgement, not an instrument
reading.)

A good book for high-tech exploration is Congo (Michael Crichton).

Try to leave lots of puzzles for your players to figure out.  If possibly,
have lots of raw data and let them sift through it.  (But not too much,
computers can do a lot of that for their characters.)

I am quite sure about this. Just as an example:
Intel was not able to enforce the copyright of the name 486 for its
processors. If I remember this right the judge said something about
that it is impossible to protect numbers. Therefore the new processor
was called \'Pentium\' instead of 586. If Intel is not able to enforce
its copyright I doubt that GDW will be able to do so.

The tables itself can be divided into two types:

One of them was developed from real world data (example: Fuel (FF&S p.63)).
These type can never be copyrighted by GDW. I could get them from any 
physics book.

The other type of table contains data which was at least partly invented
by GDW. All you have to do is to change the data slightly. If I make a
15.00001 out of a 15 it will not change the results, but it is a
completely different table. As for names make \'Hardened Steel\' out of 
\'Hard Steel\' or \'Recrystallized Iron\' out of \'Crystaliron\' then the 
copyright matter is much more difficult for GDW.

Another point would be not using the copyrighted names of GDW (example:
\'Traveller\', \'The New era\' ...) in the program. Just call it \'A Ship 
Design Program for our beloved RPG\' for example.

And as last point: Internet is spread all over the world. It\'s very
hard to find out the real source of a program. Especially if the 
author uses a pseudonym and a address from russia (Lot\'s of fun for 
the lawyers of GDW).

All things said above are my personal opinion. As I am a plastics
engineer and not a lawyer I am surly not a expert on these
matters. But I am quite sure someone of you folks has a lawyer as a
friend (I\'ve got several of them but only for european copyright
laws).

With an atmospheric re-entry weapon, it should be pretty cheap to stick a laser 
sensor and terminal guidence system on, a-la copperhead, and get a really 
precise system.

    'body' => 'Tariq Rashid mentioned adding rules for hollow point ammo. It might 
be informative here to point out the \'real-world\' significance of 
different ammo types.

Standard (Jacketed Hollow Point): designed to prevent mushrooming to 
the level found in HP rounds, due to the Geneva Convention stating 
that rounds should be non-lethal to prevent \'excessive cruelty\' - 
this does not in any way rule out maiming, just death (strange but 
true). The JHP round is by it\'s nature not optimally effective.

Hollow Point: designed to expand and inflict severe wounds on flesh - 
actually penetrate nearly as well as JHP, they are just optimised to 
cause maximum trauma.

Armour Piercing: hard tipped to penetrate armour, but cause nearly as 
much damage as JHP.

In game terms, because of limited resolution, this means that HP and 
AP will both be \'better\' than JHP, but matters of legality may 
interfere. For instance, in the US (please correct me if I\'m mistaken 
you yanks out there) it would be quite normal to use a branded round 
like \'Jacketed Hydrashok\' (a HP round designed for maximal damage 
potential/stopping power) in a home defense gun, and an AP round for 
some forms of game hunting - and we all know that certain armies have 
a bad habit of \'dum-dum\'ing their ammo ;-)

Hope that all makes sense.

The conclusion of my unscientific survey is: 
  
     "Techies dominate, but PoliSci / Historians hold their own!"

..of all my responces (about 15), about 2 fall into the humanities: the
rest are involved in the hard sciences/technological fields in one way or
another. (As I expected: Who else do you think would enjoy constructing
\'realistic\' starships or speculating on a 11,000 system government, 3600
years into the future?) 

This implies that all members of TML (and by implication, a large majority
of Traveller players) have at LEAST a post-secondary education. Excluding
10-year old ship captains, of course.

The space missile chart in FF&S has warheads up to the 1000 mt range.
(ie. pen 1/25, damage 79)  Does anyone here have a way to \'roll your own\'
warheads i.e. a formula that can extend the chart?  

Same for regular nuclear missiles. (Especially the crater radius!)

==========================================================================

On Space Balls :  don\'t forget your typical lost \'space junk\' ie. lost
satilites, forgotten screwdrivers, little bolts, orbiting gloves.  Even
now, the amount of microdust in low earth orbit is large enough that the
Space Shuttle has to change windows after every flight, and any new space
station will eventually massive \'shields\'.  And these particles are
travelling at about 1-4 Gs. 

Note: a 1mm aluminum ball, travelling at 16000 km/hr, can cause the same
damage as a falling piano at 90 km/hr  (a formula to convert this into Mj,
please?  And a way to create a penetration rating for this?) 

Incidentally: how would a busy spaceport deal with this?  

Possibily with heavy grav devices, or garbage scoops (real BIG ones)?
Maybe with some form of electromagnetic repulsion/attraction device?
And how much is this going to cost, anyway?

How about Deneb?  Deneb/Deneb/Deneb :-)

Seriously, I would like to see the subsector names of all the Deneb
subsetors.  My current campaign is set there, and it would add 
flavor to my TNS messages.

In the meantime, I am using the Subector Capital as the sector name
(Such as Mora/Mora, Regina/Regina, Jewell/Jewell, etc.)  Most of the
Spinward Marches meets this criteria.  Only Vilas,Darrian,Swords 
Words, Five Sisters, and District 268 fail this criteria.  (Trin\'s
Veil doesnt count either way, since its subsector is Trin)

So 10 of sixteen say go with the Subsector name, if you dont know.
I\'ll take those odds!!!!

    'body' => 'Question about food aboard starships:

How much space aboard a vessel do rations take up?

Please correct me if I am wrong, but rations are part of the consumables
that folks aboard ship use up (and that cost 1 KCr per crew or passenger per
jump).

Now, its perfectly reasonable to me that some of the volume rations take up
are part of the space used by the life support system. But how much is
that? 1 jump (7 days per person) of rations? 10? 100? 1000?

Assume there is a standard meal pack that takes up one liter volume and
weighs .5 kg. 3 per day means 21 per jump; for a crew of 9, that\'s 100 Kg
and .2 cubic meters per jump. At 10 jumps (10 weeks; you could stay
somewhere for two weeks after 4 weeks travel), that\'s 1 ton and 2 cubic
meters.  And 4 jumps is not a long trip.

When you run to say 6 months, or start talking about vessels carrying more
people, you really start running into a lot of space taken up by rations. A
vessel carrying 20 people with rations for 25 weeks uses 10 cubic meters
and weighs over 5 tons. And those are all the equivalent of freeze dried
rations.

So, how much of my vessel is given over to rations that I don\'t get to
control? Frankly, much more than 1-2 cubic meters "by magic" is
unreasonable.  It should be accounted for in the vessel design. Or
accounted for in the vessel\'s cargo hold.

Ration size, BTW, doesn\'t matter. If a ration pack is only .5 liter, then
you are still faced with a limit; the limit is just twice as large.

Since there is no differentiation by volume or price for ration quality,
does  that mean that there is only one choice on the quality of food served
aboard any starship, be it military troop transport, first rate liner, or
royal  personal yacht?

One fellow player suggested that this isn\'t an issue, because the life
support  system features full recycling, from toilet to table and back
again. So what are you being charged 1 KCr per jump for if it\'s a closed
system? What are you replenishing? What are you adding? How much space does
it take up? How much can you carry? What Tech Level produces it? (Important
if you are out exploring or zooming about the Wilds)

I have a number of problems with that type of system anyway. While I can
easily enough buy that you can process out poisons from bodily wastes and
be left with a fair amount of neutral bulk, where do you get the additional
nutrition?

I\'m curious what other folks have done. Or whether it has occurred to any
of you at all.

Note: this is granted a humano-centric view of food storage and
preparation. I won\'t tackle the Aslan requirement for live food or the
K\'kree preference for fresh plants till later.

Suggestions:

I\'d suggest that a vessel can stock up to a month\'s meager rations or two
weeks large or special rations out of life support. Carrying more rations
requires additional storage.  Meager rations require no special storage
facilities (freeze-dried etc.). Large or special rations require
refrigerated or freezing containers.

Meager: Prepackaged, prepared, ration packs, 1 l  .5 kg apiece. Various
    types: some require just heating; some require mixing with water; some
    are ready to eat (cold, hard, and crunchy; think MRE). Prepared in
    minimal galley. It is not always clear what the component items are;
    the meal is almost always a single item (one bar, one dish or bowl).
    Quality varies from just acceptable to nearly inedible. For example:
    the IN/IM SISR (Std Imperial Survival Ration, called SISO by the rank
    and file for Same in Same Out). Costs 3-10 Cr /meal.

Large: Standard grocery mix of food prepared from raw materials for long
    term storage, but not cooked. Generally about 2 l .75 kg per meal.
    Canned or frozen vegetables, frozen meat, grain products. Requires
    cooking in some form of galley (see below) to prepare. While not the
    highest quality, meals look like meals made of separate courses, and
    you can usually tell what the components are - provided they are
    prepared by a competent chef. Costs 12-20 Cr/ meal.

Special: Gourmet meals made of high quality, fresher versions of the
    above. 2.5 l, .85 kg. This requires a full galley and a fine cook
    (Steward-4+ or Cook-3+); otherwise this tastes simply like a better
    version of the above). Costs 25-50 Cr/meal.

Minimal Galley: Basically just a small Microwave or similar heating
    facility, a hot plate, some open counter space, and a sink. at the edge
    of the crew lounge. This is part of the budget for life support.

Half Galley: 4 cubic meters dedicated to food preparation, cooking, and
    utensil storage. Oven is large enough to cook meals for 6-10 in one
    sitting. Suitable for preparing either meager or large rations. Usually
    opens onto one side of crew lounge; sometimes partitioned off.
    Mass: 1.2 t.        Vol 4 cu. m.    Cost .12 MCr    Power .1 MW

    (Alternative: large ships may require several: .2 cu m./crew &
     passenger; minimum of 4 cu.m. 1 dedicated cook (or steward) for every
     full 8 cu.m. of Half Galley)
     Mass: .3 t. per cu. m.    Cost .1 MCr/ton          Power .025 MW / cu.m.

Full Galley: 12 cubic meters dedicated to food preparation, cooking, and
    utensil storage. Includes variable configuration ovens, toasters,
    stoves, etc; more cooking tools than Julia Child can shake a spoon at.
    Completely separate room. Generally manned by a dedicated cook, who can
    create some truly spectacular meals.
    Mass: 3.6 tons      Vol 12 cu.m.    Cost .6 MCr     Power .4 MW

    (Alternative: large ships may require several: .3 cu m./fed person;
     minimum or 12 cu.m. Note: Not everyone aboard may be served by the
     Full Galley; for example, a liner\'s Full Galley may only serve the
     1st class customers; a rich noble may have his yacht\'s full galley
     only serve his immediate party and have an additional half galley for
     the crew.)
     Mass: .3 t. per cu. m.    Cost .1 MCr/ton          Power .025 MW / cu.m.

Additional Storage:
    Meager rations can be stored in any container with no special
    requirements. To preserve more than the minimal amount of Large or
    Special rations, additional preservative storage space is required. (I
    say preservative because newer technology may come up with something
    beyond refrigeration).

O.K., now that a lot more people are on TML (how many, Mr. Miracle?), I
can re-ask a few questions in the hope of getting some answers.

1) A good outline of what\'s available - and what\'s not - at the various
tech levels between TL10 and TL15?

(Especially the Medical stuff...and I HAVE seen the cybernetic portion of
 FF&S!  I mean things like memory-copying, brain wiping, etc.)
(And when do grav cities arise?)

2) Has anyone here developed a good set of Hydroponic rules? 

(I did some research - ie. scanned a few books - but the hydro books I
found all related to greenhouses, rather than closed-system biochemical
systems.)

3) A nice set of rules for small-engines. (The FF&S rules for engines all
end up creating monsters that won\'t fit... a motocycle, for example)

Thanks for any replies,

lets say a plasma cart 3 cm in diameter and 9cm long has a volume
of 6.362e-5 m^3.  Given a density of say 8e+3 kg/m^3 the mass of
this is 0.500 kg or 500 gm (7830 grains).  This is a 0.21 MJ
cartridge.  Plenty of energy right.  Even Using 15*sqrt(DE) you get
DV 7 which is crappy.  However a tl 12 3 cm HEAP round will get you
a Pen of 29.  And even with battledress you couldnt carry too many
of those half kilo cartridges.  Certainly no more than 5 or 6 in
the weapon.  I say this is one instance where we bend reality for
the sake of asthetics.  A tl 12 PPC this big and heavy should
deliver at least twice this performance, maybe even three times.

I would not equip my battle dress troopers at tl 12 with one of
these weapons.  I like the idea of high attentuation, but for the
money a plasma gun should be absolutely devastating at short range. 
I dont want to get into fusion guns.  I\'m talking the 3cm gun
having a DV of at least 15 out to 60m.  Even there Im not gonna
give it to the troopers.  A truly man usable plasma gun should
deliver DVs of 10 or so out to 60m with 25mm Diam cartridges(0.290
kg) at TL 12.  This is minimum acceptable performance.  Why?
because I can design a Gauss gun of ETC gun that will deliver the
same performance with vastly better range for a fraction of the
cost.  8 or 9 d10 is about the deadliest "small arm" you can make
that someone could carry.  Maybe battle dress would allow you up a
few dice.  Logically a plasma gun will never match a projectile
weapon for range.  Balance? Make the plasma gun abso-bleeping-
lutely devastating at short ranges.  Maybe something goofy like
sqrt(DE/10)/10 where DE is in Joules (for small arms) IE up to say
1 MJ.

Yes, this is not really a very user-friendly defense, but then again, 
just how much property damage did English and German cities 
suffer in WWII when anti-aircraft shells and fragments that missed 
their targets plummeted back to earth?  The idea is to disrupt the 
enemy\'s activities, hoping that you hurt yourself less than the 
enemy would have hurt you otherwise.

Finally, Tariq Rashid sez:

>Another thing that would be an interesting discussion topic is orbital 
>bombardment... (ETC)

Once upon a time, the Thor weapons system was proposed to the 
DoD.  This was a missile system (strategic or theatre-level) that 
would deploy a satellite into low or medium orbit.  This satellite 
would be able to drop a number of single or bundled tungsten or 
depleted-uranium rods with minimal control surfaces against 
ground targets.  The general consensus was that you could armor
things as much as you like, but nothing not buried in a deep 
bunker could withstand such an attack.  Various treaties against 
space-borne weapons systems made this all just a theoretical 
exercise, but it could easily be built with current technology.  I 
know I have seen it in several SciFi books, but the only one that 
comes to mind just now is Footfall, by Larry Niven and Jerry 
Pournelle.  Really a nasty little weapon.  

Tariq, please be sure to post whatever you come up with on this.  I 
would be interested in seeing it.

I wonder if FASA had to pay the DoD for publication rights?  No, I
digress.  I like GDW, so I don\'t want them to get damaged by a
slew of copyright suits.  I might distribute my own material to my
gaming group (and it might include some bits of GDW stuff), but I
would not post such material.  I would also make it clear my gaming 
group was not to post this material (and I would know if they did so).  
I would do all of this not out of fear of GDW\'s horde of lawyers, 
but simply as a mark of respect for a company I appreciate
(Of course, I still have an army of literate monkeys, so I could fight 
back with an infinite supply of appeals and legal briefs).

Thanks for the feedback, folks!  More is welcome.

 Yes, I see your point.  But, broadly speaking, we still have the 
 "airport" class and the "seaport" class.  In the case of the C 
 atmo world above, once the ships are brought into the planet, are 
 they moved from the "elevators" (airport model) or do the 
 terminals and maintenance facilities get linked to them right 
 there (seaport model)?  Similar questions with respect to Asimov\'s 
 Trantor.  If you have the old "Star Fleet Technical Manual" (the 
 one that corresponded to the original series), you\'d see that SFHQ 
 was essentially a seaport model, and many of the (non-canon) 
 novels that described a docking at a starbase used the same model.  
 On the other hand, if all of your starships were designed around 
 airframe hulls (visualize the Space Shuttle with J-drives) the 
 airport model makes more sense, as it would allow for landings 
 that were "environment friendly" and cheap (minimal to zero fuel 
 expenditures.

 For the record, though, the planet in question is habitable 
 without artificial environments.

 Which, if you assume that this capability is widespread, implies 
 that the seaport model is more space efficient, as with such 
 technologies (remember thruster plates?) there\'s no reaction wash 
 area to worry about.  This leads into my original question 2, 
 below.

 In other words, how big is the shuttle, and how big is the blast 
 area around it?  And does the size of the blast area go up as the 
 size of the ship does, and at what rate/ratio?

T::>  4) How big should I make the "parking" zones for the ships, and

 Begs the question, though.  I don\'t have a good feel for what\'s 
 "realistic".  As I remember, the 100dt type S looked comparable in 
 size to something like a MD-9. Should I look at the plan view of 
 one and just draw the smallest circle that it fits completely 
 within?  Or do I need to allow some extra space to the nearest 
 fixed structure?  Do I depress the actual landing area, or leave 
 smooth ground?  Do I make some docks/landing areas/whatever\'s 
 capable of handling only the smaller ships, or do I make them all 
 capable of handling the largest ships I expect to have land on a 
 regular basis?  Do I even allow starships to land at the downport 
 at all, or do I instead have the planet run a fleet of ship\'s 
 boats (with airliner-type usage of the cargo area) between Up and 
 Down?

 Incidentally, my previous comment still stands...

I always assumed that CO2 was recycled into foodstuffs, and that the
equipment to do this fell under the category of life support
equipment.  We have to recycle the CO2 to get oxygen, or else that\'s
going to be more of a limiting factor than the amount of food we can
carry.  So once we have the carbon from the CO2 in the air reclaimed,
it\'s just a little bit of synthetic wizardry to make food out of it.
Real ingrediants can be carried to help make the food tast good, but
there\'s no reason you couldn\'t be able to synthesise some of the
basics: flour, sugar, some form of protein.  Textured Vegetable
Protein is becoming more and more meatlike even today, why shouldn\'t
it get better by TL 10-15?

 Deneb itself is in Usani Subsector, at 1925. The subsector is
named for Usani, the world at 2225. Deneb is listed as the sector
capital (with the \'Cx\' remark), while Usani is the subsector
capital (\'Cp\').

 Of the subsectors, Pretoria, Lamas, Antra, Inar, Dunmag, Atsah,
Vincennes, Usani, Geniishir, Zeng, and Kamiar bear the same name as
a world within their boundaries. Of these, only Geniishir and Atsah
are not also the subsector capitals. Geniishir only has 6 worlds,
and is likely administered from Usani, while Atsah subsector is home
to a Rebellion-born client state at the time of the listing. Its
Domain worlds have no listed capital, so they are probably
administered from whichever neighboring subsector capital is closest.
A look at the map puts three worlds with Geniishir, two with Dunmag,
and one with Million.

 A final note: Starting with the Spinward Marches Campaign book and
continuing through the MT era, until corrected in the above-mentioned
TD#19, the names of the four spinward-edge subsectors of Deneb were
flipped around. If you do not have TD#19, your sources may suggest
that they are:

 A: Gulf
 E: Star Lane
 I: Sabine
 M: Pretoria

 A look at the location of the _world_ Pretoria (in 0406) should
be sufficient evidence that the original Supplement 3 and TD#19
are correct.

I haven\'t, but at high TL (10? 11?), hydroponics are probably a lose
compared to just synthesizing whatever it is you want.  With the
development of cheap (fusion) power, a great many things become
possible.  For example, if you have power to waste, making simple
sugars, starches, fats, protiens, etc from CO2 and water (well some
nitrogen and some trace elements) isn\'t terribly demanding.

Admittedly while nourishing, this synthetic slop might not be terribly
appetising, but a considerable amount of headway into that problem is
being made today.  Alternatively, this slop could be fed to something
quick-growing and tasty.  You could easily synthesise something
chickens could live on, and then eat the chickens (assuming you have
the space).  (Remarkably, plants might be less efficient than animals,
because you could probaly synthesise the food faster using less space
than they would require, although using more energy, but hey, energy
is cheap, right?)

 Well, actually, I\'ve *done* demographic research for
TSR (UK). It mainly involved my wife and I walking around
EuroGenCon and entering surveys onto hand-held computers.
Anyone at EuroGenCon-92 will probably remember us. We
managed to question about 40% of attendees. One hell of a
statistically significant proportion. Sadly, they also
required it to be confidential so I can\'t quote statistics
from it (I did put GDW in the list of "What gaming company
to you patronise most?").
 Anyway TSR paid our expenses for travel (from Ireland),
accomidation (at the con) and equipment rental. They very
kindly threw in some merchandise as well. In return they received
a 70 page report on the statistic gathered full of lovely
graphs and my opinions based on a decade of watching the
gaming industry.
 The whole thing cost TSR less than 300 pounds (about 500
dollars). This isn\'t big money. If GDW is interested in
collecting demographics, or at least some hard statistics,
I might reccomend doing this. In the US you can probably get
fans who don\'t have to travel as much to do it free.

 I did a similar survey at a smaller Dublin convention
where Steve Jackson attended. I discussed it with him and
he said that Steve Jackson Games always distributed a small
survey card with their games. He said the response was very
good from this. His problem, though, was that they received
so many responses that they hadn\'t the time to enter them in
to something they could analyse.
 This is even cheaper then the convention survey. It
does, however, only get at people who already buy the product.
 If you, Loren, or anyone else is interested in the
results of the Dublin survey (which I own) I can e-mail
them or put them on a server.
 Cheers,

Scots is cool, I think :-)
Glenfiddich of Glenlivet are very good as are some of the other "Glen\'s"
If you can find it try Prime Malt the last I had came into the U.S. 
through Austrailia... Very Peaty I think that they might have strained 
it through a peat bog... ;-)
If we meet I\'ll buy, I think it would be worth it as the game that you and
your friends invented so many years ago has keept me happy for many hours.
I couldn\'t come to Gen Con as one of us had to be at work and I lost...
( I live and work in the S.F. Bay area. )
I am looking forward to the Regancy stuff as most of my campains are placed
in the marches...

We are presently in 1122-23 heading down into Lunion from Regina.
I started my present game back just after the assassanation of Strephon
I had a group who were shipping out from Capitol on a Luxery Liner ( FAsa\'s
King Richard ) they finally got on, only to find that there was a killer 
loose ( an assassan :-) ) They guessed corectly on the killer but were Very
wrong about the intended Victim... it was a good ending. We then came through
corridor jsut before the fleets were pulled out. I then played with a
slightly
different group we played the nail mission... They went a different way than
I expected Accross the rift. Oh Well we had fun... One story was posted to 
the TML called Doughnuts.
The present group are now being G.M.\'ed by James Kundert... a VERY strange
group...
So as you can see the virus is in the future. We might live up to then but 
I\'m not counting on it.
I personally do not have much interest in the RCES as yet, although I might 
be interested in what is behind the black curtin and I think that the first 
contact between the Rces and the Regancy; it is inevitable as you don\'t think
the Regancy is going to hide behind it\'s quarenteen? Especally whien the 
Regent has the knowledge of not only the Jumpstart Caches, but of Project
Longbow, and of what ever it is that should arrive in 1205... It all should
be interesting I am thinking of the possability of playing my original 
characters\' Grandchildren for these events... ( the Grandparents where close
to Norris and also intellagence ).
The group I am playing with now seem to like strangeness.
        << Subject Change Warning >>
I just got the "Reformation Coalition Equipment Guide" ( I like it )
I started thinking about the High Energy weapons... ( I have a character
who accually has one of the things from \'G\' tech 16 "Yah sure Ya betcha" )
I was looking at them and noticed the Gyro stabilization... Well...
I guess at low tech I could accept it, but it certinally has some problems
( I like the comment in the Street Samuri\'s guide { FASA - Shadow Run} "Ok
good put it on plop your machine gun on it and run with it the weapon does
not move from the aiming point, But try something... Yeah that\'s it a side
step or just try to turn, Yeah that\'s it" ) ( probably misquoted as I don\'t 
have that book here right now... but that is the guiest.)
The Gyros will try to prevent ANY movement out of line... 
You can move slowly taking time for the gyros to Precess, but moving slowly
is not what I am going to want to do in a firefight !
I think that with gravitics in common use since tech 9, and these weapons are

tech 13, and up, that, grav units would be used as compensators... 
We even did go along with one character\'s cybernetics, using micro - grav 
fields to run them, Latest Susag stuff looks very normal, but much more 
powerful cost her a lot they did... :-), another had micro grav cloak clasp. 
( she could afford it! )
speaking of afford ...
How about those Det Laser missiles ?
We where thinking ( Uh Oh now we\'re all in trouble ;-) ), what merchant
ship\'s
Purser is going to let them THROW away 1/2 a million Cr.? Each time they 
fire one??? Astrid certinally would not, she would say something like, 
"Gunnar; are you NUTS!!!"
So we think that most merchant ships would mount missiles much more like the
CT(tm) missiles. Leaving the Det missiles to the military.
The Merchant is primaraly just trying to get away from the attack, ( sure if 
they can defeat them, just think of the prize money... ) but mostly they just
want to get away, let the system defense and Navy take care of these pirates
isn\'t that what they are payed for???
Zhodani Merchants are not typaccly armed. Vargar will use anything they can
Aquire ( yeah that\'s the word...) The Aslan might have the same problem.
The female isn\'t going to be inclined to see half a mill going out into space
to explode.
So these seem to be only military equipment in our games if only for economic
reasons...
There was something else Oh yeah; Back to the Plasma Rifle.
I was also thinking about the N2 tank, with things like "superdense"(tm) I\'m
sure that a cartrage that could fit into the weapons\' pistol grip could be
made, what 50 rounds? I\'m going to look into tech 16 batteries also (FF&S).
Why yes I AM trying to make this thing as self containeed as possible...
see the CT and MT sources that mention the tech 16 Plasma rifle it wasn\'t a 
Fusion gun but it was self contained and was ussable by some one, who is not 
in battle dress !
Oh another thing, A character has a Killer weapon or Battle Dress 
( Gunnar has Both... ;-)), but look at it he had to get some special rounds 
just for shipboard use, at least on his own ship. 
If he is not worried about the real estate then, well let her rip. But a 
Plasma or Fusion gun WILL punch a hole in the HULL of a standard Merchant 
ship ( guess what kind o\' ship he is on ;-)). not to mention the interior
rearrangements it will do. " Hoo boy Astrid\'s gonna be mad at me for that one
I hope I missed her fish tank..."
So there are ways to keep the characters in line with out Draconion messures
from the GM...
Also consider something from MT, Signature ! Yeah, just you cut loose with
one of these in a firefight and you are now TARGET No. ONE !!! And if you are
in Battle Dress you are even more noticable.
The character might mess up once but if your group is reasonable they might 
just Frag him themselves and save you the trouble...
Ok Ok I\'ve babbled on to long now.
see ya

Stepping in here for Rob... TML is at 287, XBOAT is at 251.  The

If the local tech level will support Lifters, then it will be more 
space efficient.  But you have to look at more factors other than 
tech level.  At the TL where lifters are first introduced, they are 
going to be very costly, and will only appear on high-population / 
small worlds were space is at a premium.  Even for a couple of tech 
levels beyond introduction, the downport, will probably follow an 
airport model because concreate is cheap, and if land is availble, 
they will want it for expansion abilities.

Many worlds will start with large space consuming starports so that 
when they get really busy, that land can be turned into terminals 
instead of runways.

I have also always invisioned most landable ships and boats to have 
the ability to hover, and take off vertically.  This would reduce 
their wash area greatly.  I think the point I am trying to reach, is 
to not develop one model, but use all models, and in combinations.  
On a world like Rhylanor, the starport is going to be very congested, 
they are going to use lifters, if they allow starships on world at 
all.  Because of the high population, and limited space, the local 
goverment would probably only permit shuttles to travel back and 
forth between the down port(s) and the high ports.

Yet you could turn around and look at Margesi/Rhylanor, another Class 
A starport.  It has considerable land mass, and a low population.  
With both a Navel base and Scout base in system, this world even at 
TL-12 probably only has lifters that are used to transport 
non-aerodynamic bodies to-and from oribt.  The starport there would 
cover a considerable amount of space.

Of course, one of my favoriate pieces of Traveller Art, the cover to 
the MegaTraveller Imperial Encyclopedia shows a place that has no 
space to land craft, even though the population is reasonably low.  
On a world similar to this, craft may be limited to 200T or less and 
have to land VTOL style on small pads.

At TL-13 Air/Land/Sea craft and Starship techology merge to the point 
where they are only distingusable by their jump drives.  The Grav 
vehicals at that point can all make it to orbit and survive re-entry. 
So I would assume that TL-12 and higher starships have VTOL, while 
TL-11 might, and TL-10 and below do not.

For atmosphere oprations, you can assume space similar to that of 
your modern jet.  Between the fact that taking off and reaching oribt
requires considerably different energy amounts, the ships probably 
take off with minimal reaction, and as soon as they clear the 
starports air space, they begin powering up for orbit.  Again, at 
TL-12 and above, the ships are grav powered and the reaction mass is 
negligable.

You are only going to have this situation occur on developing worlds 
who do not import techology.  The blast area is quite big on the 
shuttle.  I think they clear a mile away from the pads before launch. 
Anyone from NASA want to comment?

The Type S scout is 37.5 m long, 24 m wide, and 7.5 m high.  You 
could comfortably park 3 to 4 of these on a j-random  football field. 
You probably are only going to get a couple of MD-9\'s on a football 
field.  

The 200T Far Trader is 49.3 m, by 28.5m , by 8.7 m.  Your football 
field can now only hold three of these vessles. (On an interesting 
side not, the Gazelle Close Escort is 48m by 23m, by 8.5m, yet 
displaces 100T more hydrogen)

(Source: Supplement 7: Traders and Gunboats)

Based on the airport model, most airports have terminals for the 
jumbos, and termials for the smaller planes.  Miami International 
tends to park the 747/DC-10\'s on certain concourses where there is 
more space, and they pack the 727/MD-8\'s on other concourses where 
there are more gates. 

So when building your starport, ask some questions.  Is this world on 
a trade route?  What is my population?  Am I going to be visited by 
free traders, and subsidized merchants, or am I going to get the Big 
Tukera lines ships in port?  You might want to allocate space for say 
4 1000T ships, and 10 400-600T ships, and 40-300 and smaller ships.  

Is there a navel or scout base in system?  Expect higher traffic.  Do 
you need to plan for the big military cruisers?

Hope this helps.....

I wonder how many balls you have to put into orbit to make surface to 
orbit travel prohibitivly dangerous?  14,000 cubic meters perhaps?  That 
would be only 1,000 tons displacement.  Three or four ships could make 
your fledgling space program much more complex.

First my TNE group consists of a Zoology grad, a nursing student,
a classics student, a business studies student , a food
technologist and myself a horticulture grad pursuing plant
physiology studies.  I guess we are atypical except we do have
advanced degrees.

Hydroponics:- there has been some work done by NASA on the
feasibility (I don\'t have the exact references at hand but they are
in a journal called HORTSCIENCE about 1988) of this on a space
station but at present we don\'t know enough about plant/enviroment
interactions to confidently predict the success of such systems in
a closed environment.  If you add low gravity or zero gravity the
situation is even more complicated.  Hydroponics on a starship
would be labour intensive as a small change in nutrient levels,
sterile conditions, light levels could have a major impact on crop
yield.  Disease spreads very rapidly through hydroponic systems
often wiping out the whole crop.  The area required onboard a ship
would also have to be large not to mention the water required for
a hydroponic system and the whole idea on starships becomes
uneconomic when compared to pre-packaged foods.  If you want to see
what I mean Disneyland or Disneyworld have a hydroponic display set
up where they grow salad vegetables for the food places in the
complex.

Generally I would say if you want fresh vegetables and fruit at
tech 9 glasshouse size equipment would be required, and one to two
crewmen to maintain it.  At higher tech levels genetically
engineered plants will increase yield and more advanced control
systems could reduce the area required.

 I am currently writing the first of the alien modules: _Aliens
 of the Rim vol. !: Hiver and Ithklur_. We will not be reprinting
 the DGP alien modules verbatim, but will be rewriting them from a
 RC or Regency viewpoint (as the case may be). They will not
 always be paired (Hiver and Ithklur just seemed to go together).
 We will not be doing any purely vehicle or purely starship
 sourcebooks, but we will continue with the _equipment guide_
 series for both the RC and Regency, and continue to put equipment
 into various products a few pages at a time.

 We are negotiating along these lines. It remains to be seen how

The reasons given are:

<1> No volume for maintenance access.
<2> The engine drives the propeller directly without need for any complicated
    drive shafts.
<3> There is less volume and weight consumed by cooling apparatus.

Many of these reasons could also be applied to motor cycles and grav-bikes.
Some quick rules: the number of times the conditions above are reached
reduce the engine volume as outlined below:

  # conditions           volume
      1                  75%
      2                  66%
      3                  50%

I haven\'t used this rule before and have only thought it up.

Seats:  the seats listed on page 62 assume that the seat is within the 
vehicle.  With motor cycles and grav bikes the seat is mounted upon the
top of the bike.  The ground vehicle rules don\'t really consider vehicles
where the user is riding on top.  A motor cycle is more than a open vehicle.

small  units in some ships.   One problem, however, is  that
of  space.   Although a high level tech might  produce  some
very  space saving systems, when your ship is currently over
capacity  in  crew  and or cargo, (as is  the  case  in  the
campaign  I am in) then space is a luxury.  Some people  may
justify  putting some small units into their  own  quarters,
and  some scientific ships may even justify a complete  room
for research purposes.

Assuming  that  most of the ship\'s food  stuffs  are  either
stored  or  recycled,  then what would a  small  hydroponics
system  have  on it.  Well, if a person deeply  believes  in
having a unit, probably a small portion of the system  would
be  devoted  to  beauty,  flowers and  or  flowering  edible
plants.   Second most important would be herbs  and  spices,
making the bland recycled food stuff more pleasant to eat.

Another  point to consider in hydroponics is gravity.   When
placed  in  areas  with  no  or little  gravity  on  ship  I
recommend  the  NASA  studies,  otherwise  under  artificial
gravity  you  can  use  studies  of  hydroponics  in   urban
environments as a city apartment is much like a  small  area
devoted to hydroponics.

Disease  would  be  a  problem with all systems,  especially
hydroponics  where the plants share the  same  water.   Crop
diversity,  having a lot of different plants, combined  with
an  active breeding and genetic program, (imagine trying  to
crossbreed  with different strains of plants from  different
worlds)  would  give  the hydroponics  garden  an  advantage
against disease.

That\'s  one nice thing about technology, in that many things
are  possible.  The only problem in space is often the  lack
of  it.   While there\'s a lot of space out there  in  space,
there is often too little of it in your ship.

Hey all.

Havent sat down to work out energies for objects dropped from orbit formally
but a back of the envelope kinda calculation was giving 250 MJ for 100kg 
cones dropped from 500 km.  These were done on the train home with no 
calculator and lots of assumptions but are ballpark.

The reason Im posting today is because I was reading Jane\'s All the 
Worlds Fighting Ships 1994-1995 yesterday and saw several discussions 
about using SSBNs in a conventional role.  They would fire Ballistic 
missiles that would go into space.  These would be tipped with Kinetic 
Kill Vehichles as they called them.  The next stage of development is 
putting a GPS recvr into one of these to see if the KKVs position can be 
fixed to the accuracy necessary for such a weapon.  My guess is that IRBM 
and ICBM get up to 100 to 200 km before descent.  When I finally sit down 
to develop the other stuff, I\'ll try and take a look at this. 

The reason this is now being developed is that a ballistic missile will 
not trigger the automatic response that it would a few years ago.

 Yes, I see your point.  But, broadly speaking, we still have the 
 "airport" class and the "seaport" class.  In the case of the C 
 atmo world above, once the ships are brought into the planet, are 
 they moved from the "elevators" (airport model) or do the 
 terminals and maintenance facilities get linked to them right 
 there (seaport model)?  Similar questions with respect to Asimov\'s 
 Trantor.  If you have the old "Star Fleet Technical Manual" (the 
 one that corresponded to the original series), you\'d see that SFHQ 
 was essentially a seaport model, and many of the (non-canon) 
 novels that described a docking at a starbase used the same model.  
 On the other hand, if all of your starships were designed around 
 airframe hulls (visualize the Space Shuttle with J-drives) the 
 airport model makes more sense, as it would allow for landings 
 that were "environment friendly" and cheap (minimal to zero fuel 
 expenditures.

 For the record, though, the planet in question is habitable 
 without artificial environments.

 Which, if you assume that this capability is widespread, implies 
 that the seaport model is more space efficient, as with such 
 technologies (remember thruster plates?) there\'s no reaction wash 
 area to worry about.  This leads into my original question 2,

 In other words, how big is the shuttle, and how big is the blast

 Begs the question, though.  I don\'t have a good feel for what\'s 
 "realistic".  As I remember, the 100dt type S looked comparable in 
 size to something like a MD-9. Should I look at the plan view of 
 one and just draw the smallest circle that it fits completely 
 within?  Or do I need to allow some extra space to the nearest 
 fixed structure?  Do I depress the actual landing area, or leave 
 smooth ground?  Do I make some docks/landing areas/whatever\'s 
 capable of handling only the smaller ships, or do I make them all 
 capable of handling the largest ships I expect to have land on a 
 regular basis?  Do I even allow starships to land at the downport 
 at all, or do I instead have the planet run a fleet of ship\'s 
 boats (with airliner-type usage of the cargo area) between Up and 
 Down?

 Incidentally, my previous comment still stands...

The world was Aramis/Aramis 0710/Spinward Marches, if memory serves,
at the beginning of The Traveller Adventure.  The starport was drawn
as having airlocks leading to the surface above individual landing
pads, and the pads were allocated more like docks than like gates in
that a ship would sit there for the week, unload and load cargo and
passengers, and take off directly from there.  The facilities around
the pads were rather minimal, though; since the players\' ship was
there for annual maintenance, it was moved over to the Naasirka
maintenance pads for the two weeks maintenance took, then moved back
to its original location.  The pads were also spaced close together,
at least in their ground footprint, and the city of Aramis was not
lacking for surface area.

About gliding landings being cheaper: The DC-X/Delta Clipper project
is intent on demonstrating that the extra fuel required to land an
empty hull on its tail is less heavy and less expensive than the
equivalent heat shielding and wings required to provide a gliding
landing.  Presumably there will be advances in materials technology
that will make the wings relatively lighter, but the fusion or HEPLAR
rockets assumed by Traveller should keep the extra fuel costs
to land a ship without wings minimal compared with the weight and
expense of wings.  

Environmental friendliness is also debatable, since if your ship
decelerates to a relatively slow speed before entering the atmosphere
using its rockets, there will be less kinetic energy dissipated into
the upper atmosphere, and you won\'t have people half a world away
complaining about sonic booms from spacecraft.

Classic Traveller assumed that all streamlined ships were VTOL.  The
fact that 1G was not enough to lift off from a size A world was waved
off, assuming you could overdrive the rockets/engines/thruster
plates/whatever for a couple minutes.  There are several
adventures assuming that standard small craft, and streamlined ships
such as the scout/courier and the free trader, can land on a dime and
investigate something like an alien complex or rescue the half of the
party that managed to get themselves into a fix, or whatever.
See several chapters from The Traveller Adventure, the adventure from
The Traveller Book (originally in one of the Double Adventure books),
and many other sources.

If you\'re not using the stock Classic Traveller setting, or you\'re
trying to rationalize the new non-reactionless drives from FFS, then
you may have to follow your airportish model.

The nearest spectators for a shuttle launch are 3 miles away.  At that
distance, the effects are evidently still quite noticable, with a
shock wave and loud subsonics, but the spectators\' hearing is not in
danger or anything.  The shuttle puts out about 5 million pounds of force,
let\'s say 2,500 tons of force, to lift off; this is comparable to a
classical free trader of displacement 200 tons of hydrogen == 1,400
tons of water.  So if we launch using chemical propellants we\'d probably
want to have two or three launch stands far away from everything else,
and to have ships taxi to and from the launch stands.

For your size of blast area question: like any explosion, the effects
obey the inverse square law; the effects will drop to 1/4 at twice the
range, and it takes 4 times as much energy to produce twice the effect
at the same range.  (Someone may wish to correct me on this -- for
very large ships the radii start punching through the tropopause, and
it may go from inverse square to inverse.)

I\'d recommend having a variety of sizes for the pads -- while most of
the ships using the downport will be relatively small, a 100 ton
scout/courier will still need less room than a 5000 ton bulk cargo
carrier.  If you assume reactionless drives, the pads can be barely
large enough to hold the ships.  If you assume reaction drives, then
you\'ll need to have some kind of launch/landing stand off in the
distance, and you still need the areas for the ships to be parked for
a week at a time to load and unload cargo and conduct business.

You can decide whether you want all the ships to be cheek-by-jowl with
each other or not; on one hand, if you have to isolate a 5 mile or 10
mile radius around the spaceport because no one wants to live that
close, there\'s lots of room to space ships around; on the other hand,
you probably want to save on the expenses of extending mass transit to
all of the ship sites, so you might cluster them all around the main
starport entrance.  Both would be entirely logical organizations.

If the starport\'s that noisy, you could, for example, put it way off
in the boonies, with a 15 minute high-speed-rail trip between it and
the major city it serves.  Or put it approximately where Canberra is
in relation to Sydney and Melbourne, sort of like Dallas/Fort Worth
International; halfway between two cities, neither of which will
acknowledge the other as predominant, and serving both equally.  This
turns the disadvantage of a noisy spaceport into sort of a political
advantage...

I never seem to have a problem with hack n\'slash players. In most of the
campaigns I run (whether it be Traveller:TNE, AD&D, MERP or what have
you), the players always seem FAR more interested in cultures, the locals
and problem solving than with who has the biggest, baddest fusion gun (of
course, one player enjoys painting up the part equipment with rude and
somewhat violent sayings..). On a side note...I feel out of place :).
Everyone here seems to be a science type of some sort. I\'m an
Anthropologist with a minor in Religion :). My gaming group consists of a
plumber, a Computer Science major, and two female botanists. Hmmm, could
make for an interesting case study :).

It may well be :). As a Canadian, I have to agree that no one in my group
(myself included) can understand this fixation on firearms that seems so
prelevent in the United States. A small statistic I found rather profound.
Winnipeg and New Orleans. Both cities in the population range of 500,000.
Winnipeg is actually closer to 600,000, which makes the statistic even
more profound. So far this year, there have been 317 murders in New
Orleans. Here in Winnipeg? 16...and Winnipeg has a higher murder rate than
many Canadian cities. Scary...

Sincerely,
Jeff Franzmann

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Heck, it\'s not hard to explain at all.

The "fascination" with guns by the media has to do with the fact that
the \'powers-that-be\' have decided that the problem is with guns. It\'s
easier to say; "get rid of the guns" than it is to say; "we gotta\'
change peoples\'s attitudes". All just politics.

The stats are easily explained by looking at the cultural diversity
& cultural friction. For example, in parts of England where cultural
homogeneity exists you have a lot less violence than in parts, like
areas of London, where there\'s more diversity.

Lastly, in many parts of the USA society is just plain breaking down.
When law & order go out the window violence is bound to arise. Right
here in Tucson, AZ the police don\'t even answer calls sometimes! 

Phil

p.s. The countries that border any given country can also make a
BIG difference in the violence level.

I have a question regarding space combat in TNE.  Originally, there were
10 fire rounds per turn (30 minutes) for space combat in TNE.  This was
later amended to one fire round per turn (per the Upgrade Booklet found in
FF&S).  This now matches the combat sequence in Brilliant Lances.
My question asks is this correct?  Under the one shot per 30 minute rule,
things seem very skewed in that combat now heavily favors missiles versus
lasers.  Before, lasers seemed favored since a ship could only launch one
missile per tube per turn (30 minutes) versus a laser firing 10 times in one
turn.  The other problem was the length of combat.  In one game of BL, a
Gazelle escort and a Vargr 400 Ton ship fought a 15 turn battle with no
clear winner.  Seven and a half hours of fighting with no clear winner
sounds a little inconsistent.  Initially, I thought the problem was with the
wording of the BL rules ( I assumed the TNE rules of 10 fire segments per
turn were correct).  Now I don\'t know.
 
I admit that I have only played Brilliant Lances about four times, but things
just don\'t wash out to what I expect.  Possibly, I am reading the rules
incorrectly.
 
For example, say a Far Trader is ambushed by another Far Trader.  The
battle might take hours which I assume would mean a distress call could be
sent and help may or may not arrive.  This combat time sequence seems to
put a damper on piracy or other space related combat situations.
Any thoughts?

Here\'s a review of TRAVELLER NAVIGATOR.  Basically, DON\'T BUY IT!
Unless you need another HELP FILE for Windows(tm).

All it contains is a large map of Diaspora, subsector maps of

The \'nifty\' notetaking feature they\'re talking about is very
limited in utility, and the starship tables are only good if you
have the thing next to you during play!  I\'m not sure if these
came from TNE or Brilliant Lances.

There is absolutely nothing NEW in it.  All the starships are just
duplicates of what you\'ve already got.

I bought it (somebody please hit me, as I\'ve already asked before)
so I feel obligated to use it once in a while for subsector maps

I may never really need it, since my _Idol Dreams_(c) campaign

####################################################################

Since others have expressed an interest in a method for describing
their characters\' personalities, and deplored that much maligned
\'playing card\' system...  I took it upon myself to negotiate for a
license to publish a Challenge article using a "real world"
personality inventory that my employers use to help their employees
communicate better with different personality types by identifying
their own characteristics and learning how to (for lack of a better,
business-like, professional term) \'schmooze\' the communicatee.  [No,
I\'m not in sales, unless you think of politics in a strictly
economic sense.]

The survey is simple.  It takes about ten minutes to complete, and
is totally subjective, and self-descriptive (as most inventories
are).  It is not massive like the MMPI/2 or 16PF, and does not
require a professional psychologist/psychiatrist to interpret.

It is based on the premise that their are FOUR basic personality
types (the refer I think to some looney ancient Chinese philosopher)
and that EVERYONE has characteristics of each type, but normally
only exhibits ONE dominantly.

For copyright purposes I will call it the RCES A4 Personality Scale.
(And if I don\'t get permission to use the tradename, I\'ll probably
write the Challenge article anyway, under this name.)  The four
scales are (the names are changed to confuse the ignorant):

1)  Aggressive
2)  Artistic
3)  Amiable
4)  Analytical

Hence the A4 designation.  I have simplified the continuum to a 1 to
20 integer scale (for those morons who insist on truly random
character generation) with 1 at the bottom signifying the least
significant (to the survey subject\'s behavior) and with 20 as the
highest possible expression of a given characteristic.

The characters\' scales with vary day to day, as does every human\'s
personality, but the recorded numbers should be considered to baseline
by which to judge a character\'s potential response to stimuli (and
also how well they\'re staying in character...).  It is possible to
have one or more characteristics which are of equal significance,
resulting in a composite personality type, such as:  Analytical-
Artistic, a good personality type for a journalist...

Agressive is self-explanatory, as is Analytical, I hope.  Artistic
is a measure of the need for, or prevalence of, self-expression,
as evidenced in a number of ways (performing arts, tantrums, etc.),
and are NOT always \'artistic\' per se.  Amiable is an index of how
important social interaction is to a given character, i.e. a
character with a 20 Amiable scale would be a team player to beat 
all team players, and a character with a 1 Amiable scale would be
a team player the likes of Simon Peter the night the cock crowed...

Some composite personalities have interesting ramifications, and
will figure significantly in my article, as will the effects of
first, second, and third level stress on each primary personality
type.  I will use myself for example:  I tested a 19 Aggressive (a
number off the top of the original scale, but the real result!), and
negative (on the original scale) on the rest of the characteristics.
Normally, (I\'m told) I am an overbearing, dominant, agressive
control freak, and under FIRST LEVEL STRESS I become more so.  That
is under the influence of minor stressors, I become more dominant,
more aggressive.  Under SECOND LEVEL STRESS I zig down the chart to
Artistic and become tremendously more expressive of my displeasure
over whatever stressors are present, or absent!  Under THIRD LEVEL
STRESS, which doesn\'t happen very often, I zag over to Analytical
and actually stop to think about what is happening (I\'m told that
this is unusual for me...)  The only time I\'ve been under FOURTH
LEVEL STRESS I was unconscious (hit by a fast moving Buick Regal
while on a ten-speed), but I am told I would have actually become
very Amiable, which I find hard to believe, under the circumstances,
as I was very p*ss*d *ff when I came to!!!  But then again, I\'m not
a psycho, or psychologist/psychiatrist, so I\'ll take their word for
it.

These scales should not be confused with MOTIVATIONS which are
entirely different animals!!!  These are PERSONALITY CHARACTERISTICS
which influence reaction to stimuli, such as stress and salespeople!
MOTIVATIONS are the topic covered well by the \'playing card\' system
in GDW games that I really like!

Maybe someday I\'ll actually stop being a starving college student
and earn money doing the things I waste all this time on...  : {

 This is useful, as a _supplement_ for the standard UWP.  I like
 it, and I intend to use it for future RICE Papers, and I encourage
 others to as well.  This should be placed on the line BELOW the

There was an article that appeared in the Los Angeles Times about two
years ago that I found rather interesting.  It compared the murder
rate in the state of North Dakota (population ~650,000) and the murder
rate in Washington D. C. (population ~700,000).  During the year 1991,
D. C. had a total of 734 homicides and North Dakota had a total of 7.
And more guns are owned in North Dakota than in Washington D. C.

Winnipeg is a city with certain factors that make it more stable than
New Orleans.  It is 1) ethnically homogenous to a greater degree, 2)
it lacks a large number of people below the poverty line, and 3) it is
_cold_, which "drives off the riff-raff" according to a resident of
North Dakota quoted in the L. A. Times article referenced above.  This
yields a population that has fewer reasons to want to kill each other
in Winnipeg than in New Orleans.

I personally have no desire to own a gun.  However, I do not believe
that the presence of guns itself yields a higher rate of deaths.
Rather, it\'s the motive to commit murder that yields murders.  Deprive
the people of that motive, and you turn these villainous firearms back
into hunting weapons.

I\'ll get to the Traveller stuff in a minute, but I had to respond to this
:). For one thing, North Dakota is a very scattered state, while DC is one
packed city. It\'s a given than large population centres have far more
crime. Unless you are comparing urban centres, rather than an urban centre
to a state, the statistic is meaningless. You have to compare DC to a
relatively similar city (One reason I picked New Orleans for Winnipeg.
Population size, similar economic problems, and similar diversity in terms
of ethnicity [not the same ethnic groups in terms of diversity, simply
similar totals]).
TRAVELLER NOTE: Neat way to construct cities in campaigns, is to use the
basic outline of your home city, and transplant it to an alien culture.
Give it the same problems faced by your home town, only with an alien
bent. Crime wave in your home city? Give your alien city a crime wave,
only that it\'s being caused by some sort of shadow cult. Unemployment?
look at the problems being caused in your home city, and transplant. Car
manufacturor close shop? Maybe Tukera Lines close up in your alien city.
Simple and effective (and no doubt used by many a referee. Just want to
get my thoughts in though...

> Winnipeg is a city with certain factors that make it more stable than
> New Orleans.  It is 1) ethnically homogenous to a greater degree, 2)

Strike one :). I\'m not sure what you mean by ethnically homogenous. Mostly
white? Nope. Largest Chinatown short of LA and Vancouver, largest Filipino
community in Canada (last time I checked the records), a large First
Nations population. Hardly homogenous. If you mean getting along? Again,
no. Sure, our racial tensions are nothing compared to those in the States,
but it is there. No nation is immune from racism. Look at Imperial
attitudes towards the Zhodani :).


> it lacks a large number of people below the poverty line, and 3) it is

Strike two :). Unemployment is at %11, and a large number of people are
below the poverty line. We\'re still crawling out of the recession. Of
course, welfare helps, but welfare never puts you above the poverty line.
Besides, the poverty line is a very artificial construct...it doesn\'t
measure quality of life, simply ability to live.

> _cold_, which "drives off the riff-raff" according to a resident of

Ball. Winnipeg has wonderful summers. It was 22 today (don\'t know what
that is in Fahrenheit...really warm I\'d imagine). It only gets cold in
winter :). However, most of the criminal type folk I know want to move to
California, so you may have something there :).

> yields a population that has fewer reasons to want to kill each other

We have all the reasons to kill people that folks in New Orleans do. We
just don\'t do it as often. Let\'s not get into a debate over this, though,
I just thought it was an interesting statistic, nothing more. However, it
DOES make for interesting Traveller fare...why are two neighbouring
nations on a world totally disparate? Take Canada/USA to opposite
extremes. A nation of pacifistic, non commital folk living in one gigantic
commune, neighbouring a nation caught in the grips of a vicious urban
civil war, where the upper and lower classes vie for power and vote with
bullets. Figure out WHY they are next to each other, how they ended up the
way they are. Could make for an interesting adventure...maybe those
pacifists have latent psionic potential, while the urban guerillas don\'t.
Maybe it\'s  religious thing :). Maybe...hmm, I gotta write some of this down.

Well, it does lead to a higher rate of death for some simple reasons. Guns
allow for efficient and effective deaths. MANY gun deaths are Manslaughter
in nature. A guy gets angry, pulls his gun, kills someone. Doesn\'t happen
if you don\'t have a gun, you throw a punch instead. This happens a LOT
with the gang violence and youth violence so prelevent. Kids and teenagers
seldom think about consequences. Put a gun in their hand, and they are a
true menance. Not because they\'re evil, but because their lives haven\'t
taught them about consequences. End rant :).

Jeff Franzmann

***Civility circuits have been disabled - you have been warned! ***
This is the most offensively racist comment I have seen in a while. 
Has Mr Pugliese considered the economic factors linking to 
crime/violence? I live in Manchester/UK and the place is a cultural 
melting pot, and by and large racism is not a great. There is an 
alarming level of violence in certain areas (Moss Side), which seems 
to be linked closely to drugs/organised crime. As far as I can see 
this has been assisted through lack of opportunity to make a decent 
living through legal employment - ever heard of the mafia?!? The kind 
of attitude shown is what IMHO CAUSES RACISM TO PERSIST!!!!

>  LOONIES like the Seven Dwarves
>  MUNCHKINS like Earth Elementals with beards

> REAL ROLEPLAYERS leave the character who invoked the demon to

> LOONIES say, "Say the magic word and the duck wioll give you $100!"
> MUNCHKINS scream, "No fair!  That\'s not in the Monster Manual!"

> Dice:
> REAL MEN have two each of 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 20 sided dice
> REAL ROLEPLAYERS use 3d6 for GURPS
> LOONIES use marbles and call them one-sided dice
> MUNCHKINS carry shopping bags full of every kind of die imaginable

> Favorite character from ST:TNG
> REAL MEN like Worf
> REAL ROLEPLAYERS like Data
> LOONIES like Q
> MUNCHKINS prefer the original Star Trek

> Favorite Sci/Fi Monster
> REAL MEN like the Alien
> REAL ROLEPLAYERS like the Moties
> LOONIES like the beach ball from Dark Star
> MUNCHKINS like ET

Can anyone here modify this article to fit the Traveller universe? 

e.g.

Favorite Fraction Leader
       REAL MEN like Archduke Norris
       REAL ROLEPLAYERS like Emperor Strephon
       LOONIES like Virus
       MUNCHKINS like Grandfather

Favorite Starship
       REAL MEN like Mercenary Cruisers
       REAL ROLEPLAYERS like unarmed scouts
       LOONIES don\'t care, just as long as it\'s infected
       MUNCHKINS like Sylean-class Battleships

Favorite Virus Strain
       REAL MEN like \'Samson\'
       REAL ROLEPLAYERS like \'Parent\' 
       LOONIES like \'Hobbyist\'
       MUNCHKINS like \'God\'

   March forward with your personality design article! 
(Though for *my* NPC\'s I use the MBPT .... I\'m an INTJ myself) 

   However, I _don\'t_ think that a life path generator is nothing but a
crutch....  I find the possibilities of a High-tech lifespan too (beep)
bewildering to NOT put into some organized format.  Look at the
possibilities...

A) Family Enviroment           Nuclear Family?
                               Raised in a Creche?
                               Extended family?
                               Single-parent norm?
                               Born a clone - clonegroup is family?
                               Born an adult clone, with artifical memories
                                     (a la Blade Runner)
                               The family is a Corp/Church/Govt/Scientific
                                     group?

B) Family Income               Welfare - 20th century style?
                               Welfare - 57th century style 
                                 (Their neccessities are our luxuries...)
                               Low - Mid - High wage job?
                               Travelled a lot? eg. A family of free traders
                               Worked with their hands/brains/image?
                               Military brats?

                               Did they choose their group, or
                                  did they leave their group, or are they
                                  stuck in their group (ie. species)?

..I could go on and on.  But to deal with this mass of possibilities, I\'d
like to put it into a framework first.  Then, I\'ll offer it up for
criticism.  Later, after I can peel my asbastos suit off, I\'ll rework it. 

Of course, some people LIKE to deal with an unorganized, conceptual mess. 
They, of course, can just ignore my little charts....

 One biologist, a physicist, three engineers, an artist, and a computer

more fun than rolling dice.  The same thing applies to our RuneQuest games:
we\'ll spend 3-4 hours chatting with the locals rather than slicing monsters.

fascination with firearms (at least as portrayed in American media).

It\'s not that difficult to find moderate to non-violent players.
The majority of players can handle campaigns with that sort
of emphasis, and it\'s pretty easy to identify those that can\'t
hack it without hack \'n\' slash.

I played in one campaign which was very nonviolent, we only ended
up with combat of any type occurring once every third session or so.
There was a certain amount of incidental chaos (the theme for a while
was a space salvage outfit, and well, space salvage outfits go where
things break in spectacular ways...), but not so much shooting on the
whole.  Not even after the referee (in a fit of boredom) dropped a couple
of munchkin-level ancient artifacts into play.  Given the ability to
take out a battleship a few times over, the group promptly decided to
run for unexplored space and go explore it rather than say form another
faction in the rebellion or go raiding.

Of course, it helped that the ref imposed occational weapons accidents
in training (lost my first character in the campaign to a fusion gun
accident, and we later shot down one of our own ships by accident).
But we had a lot of fun going out exploring, trading, rescuing things,
and only rarely shooting at them.


The key, though, is having a ref able and willing to create the environment
for peaceful adventures.  That means giving people something else to do
which is as interesting.  That generally takes more effort and creativity
than combat-heavy campaigns, and most refs are lazy like the rest of us.

Just a random commentary in this thread... it\'s not hard to find good
roleplayers who can hack a nonviolent campaign.  It\'s a little harder to
find them at cons; I\'ve lost count of how many total disasters I ended
up running because I assumed I\'d get players who could think rather
than shoot first 8-)  Either plant friends of yours in the playing
group to help establish mood, or be very selective about the people
you let into the campaign.

(I haven\'t read today\'s tml yet; I hope you haven\'t been inundated with that
reply.)

I\'ve found a very rough demographic about violence and players.  In my
experience, which is probably not statistically significant, men in their
late teens and early twenties play the most violent characters, even to the
point of blowing each other away over division of loot or suspicion of
treachery.  Women of any age that I\'ve played with (18 to 25) and men past
24 or so tend to play much less violent characters.  Now remember that the
sample here is only thirty people in five or six different RPGs over an
18-year period.

When I\'m the ref, violence usually doesn\'t solve much, because of the
constraints of civilized society (i.e., the police, the marines, the navy --
there\'s always something bigger than a PC who doesn\'t want the peace
disturbed), and because violence just isn\'t a very good puzzle solver or
information finder.  Sometimes it\'s necessary, however, and then you\'d
better have the resolve to use it.  

P.S.  Jeff, don\'t feel too out of place.  There are a lot of people playing
Traveller and probably on the TMLs who, like us, have humanities or "soft"
science backgrounds.  Also, the TML technical people do express a lot of
interest and concern with cultural concerns.  I\'m glad to see that you have
a minor in religion (I do, too); I\'d like to see a dialogue develop on the
XboatML about religion in the Imperium.  Let me know if you have anything to
contribute.

 My players would love to shoot things but, given the rules, you
don\'t get to live very long if you do that. In short, they would rather
their interested and well developed characters to live to get more
interesting and better developed.

 Hell, they were worried here when the murder rate in Dublin
(pop 1 million) jumped from 6 to 8 per year! (The fact that we border
on one of the most violent countries in Europe (Northern Ireland) doesn\'t
seem to make much difference.)

 In FFS weapon design section there is no information about the
 materials used in weapons. However, modern barrels and receivers
 can be made of various different materials to produce lighter
 and more compact weapons.
 Alternative materials can be used in CPR and ETC small arms, but
 they should not be used in other weapon systems.

 I assume that all weapon design tables in FFS are calculated by
 using Hard Steel as weapon building material. The following table
 shows the weight and price modifiers for various materials that can
 be used in barrels and receivers.

 Material Type Weight Price
 Iron  1.33 0.8 Probably used in black-powder weapons
 Soft Steel 1.18 0.8
 Hard Steel 1.00 1.0 The most common weapon material
 Light Alloy 0.88 2.0 Common receiver material
 Titanium Alloy 0.67 5.0 Used in rifle barrels
 Light Composite 0.44 3.5
 Comp. Laminate 0.33 4.0
 Crystaliron 0.31 4.5
 Superdense 0.27 7.0

 The weight modifier is derived from FFS page 38 \'Vehicle and Craft
 Construction Materials\' table by calculating how much material is
 needed to get the same Toughness as Hard Steel has.
 The price modifier is taken directly from FFS table, and it is not
 multiplied by weight modifier to show that it is difficult and
 expensive to machine tougher materials.

 Note: currently there are many weapons with Hard Steel barrels and
 Light Alloy receivers, and some companies are manufacturing titanium
 barrels for rifles.

9x19mm Autopistol
This pistol uses ancient Solomani TL-8 9x19mm Luger cartridge (aka. 9mm
Parabellum or 9x19mm NATO), and has similar performance as 7.6mm RC(E)
pistol described in RCEG, page 46. The main differences is that 9x19mm
pistol is lighter, has better range and heavier recoil than 7.6mm RC(E).
Though other rounds can be manufactrured, ball and HP rounds are sufficient
for most military and civilian uses.

Note: The receiver is made of Light Alloy, and barrel is made of Hard Steel.
The cartridge itself has Average Muzzle Energy of 560 joules, and this pistol
has 9.35 cm barrel to increase the muzzle energy and penetration.
9x19mm Hollow Point rounds have same damage and penetration as HE rounds,
but HP rounds have better range, so HE rounds are not manufactured.
The Hollow Point round is designed by using the \'Enchanted Damage Rounds\'
rules in TW:2000 Referee Screen, page 3.

ETC.........

   Sociologists use numbers like an artist uses paint and clay--they 
combine them to paint pretty pictures and mold them to reflect what the 
creator has in mind. I have listened to both the pro and anti-gun people 
in the U.S. spout off statistics from Canada and Britian and Sweden, and 
Lebanon, and where ever they can pull them from to prove their points. 
You can, with some creativity, make a cases for a total gun ban, and then 
after a bit of data massage, use the same numbers to argue for everyone 
owning a gun in their home.

   Comparisions between two cities in America, let alone cities across 
an ocean from each other, are difficult at best, since there are just 
too many variables that enter into the equation. Culturally speaking, 
Canada and America are similar (in someways very compatible), but there 
are enough differences so that you can\'t conclude anything particularly 
meaningful with regard to the effect a larger number of guns would have 
on Winnipeg (if you are using a U.S. as a guide), or fewer guns would 
have on New Orleans (if you are using a Canadian or European city as a 
guide). 

   FYI, New Orleans has always had a reputation as being a place where 
crime is, well, tolerated a bit more (or should I say _sin_ ;-)  ). In 
it early days, pirates were known to hang out there, and some fought 
beside General (later President) Jackson\'s army at the Battle of New 
Orleans (not to rub it in on our British friends, but marching across an 
open field against our works even with vets of the Peninsular Campaign 
just wasn\'t going to do it). New Orleans has also been a major shipping 
port almost since it founding (which attracts a special kind of vermin), 
something Winnipeg never has been. Apples and oranges guys, apples and 
oranges....


Jeff Franzmann sez:
<Well, it does lead to a higher rate of death for some simple reasons. 
Guns allow for efficient and effective deaths. MANY gun deaths are 
Manslaughter in nature. A guy gets angry, pulls his gun, kills someone. 
Doesn\'t happen if you don\'t have a gun, you throw a punch instead. This 
happens a LOT with the gang violence and youth violence so prelevent. 
Kids and teenagers seldom think about consequences. Put a gun in their 
hand, and they are a true menance. Not because they\'re evil, but because 
their lives haven\'t taught them about consequences.>

   Frankly, if I\'ve gotten to the point with someone that I wanted to 
see them dead (not that I ever would), it would be all too easy for me 
to chose some other weapon to do the deed. Ice picks work well, as do 
hachets, machetes, scissors, steak knives, baseball bats, cars, bows and 
arrows, swords, shovels, and hundreds of other things I can name. Nicole 
Brown Simpson was not killed with a gun, nor are thousands of other 
homocide victims. Oh, you might see a small decline in total homocide 
cases in the U.S. if you ban guns, but not nearly as much as you would 
like to think (I won\'t even get into the constitutional issues).

   Children in the U.S. generally are not allowed to own firearms (the 
kind that are larger and harder hitting that an air rifle or "BB" gun), 
and there are laws against it in many states (these usually allow use 
with parental supervision). If current laws were enforced, there would 
be many fewer gun related murders involving children. As it is, the cops 
are rewarded far more for busting some guy who is carrying a few onces 
of drugs than a kid carrying a .44 magnum--so you can guess who they 
spend their time looking for.


Phil Pugliese sez:
<The stats are easily explained by looking at the cultural diversity
& cultural friction. For example, in parts of England where cultural 
homogeneity exists you have a lot less violence than in parts, like 
areas of London, where there\'s more diversity.>

   The case could be made that population density has everything to do 
with it, and ethnic make-up zero. Go back to the Sociology books, 
Phil...apples and oranges again.


Martin Fay emphatically sez:
<***Civility circuits have been disabled   you have been warned! ***
This is the most offensively racist comment I have seen in a while.  Has 
Mr Pugliese considered the economic factors linking to  crime/violence? 
I live in Manchester/UK and the place is a cultural  melting pot, and by 
and large racism is not a great. There is an  alarming level of violence 
in certain areas (Moss Side), which seems  to be linked closely to 
drugs/organised crime. As far as I can see  this has been assisted 
through lack of opportunity to make a decent  living through legal 
employment   ever heard of the mafia?!? The kind  of attitude shown is 
what IMHO CAUSES RACISM TO PERSIST!!!!>

   I have seen and heard far worse. If this is the worst you\'ve heard in 
a while, you must live somewhere where race is not as big an issue with 
everyone--good for you. Any pointers on how we can make things that way 
here?

   The fact is that in the U.S. most violent crime is linked to the drug 
trade as well. While places like Compton, CA and the South Bronx 
(section of New York City) would not become paradise if the drug trade 
stopped, they certainly would become much safer places to live. Most gun 
violence in the U.S. is also due to the drug trade, not necessarily 
because Americans are "trigger happy". 

   America has a real problem with what to do with the "chronically 
unemployed" in its large urban areas. It has literally spent trillions 
over the last hundred years (most in the last thirty) on various social 
programs (both public and private) in an attempt to solve the situation. 
While some people have been helped, the situation still persists. There 
are quite a few individuals in this country (myself not necessarily 
included) that feel the real problem might not be how much the U.S. 
spends, but with the "chronically unemployed" themselves--in essence, 
they have been "on the dole" for so long (in some cases for three or 
four generations), they feel like it is their birth right to sit around 
and collect checks at working people\'s expense. This is not necessarily 
a racial issue, as there are more whites in the U.S. on welfare than 
blacks, and frankly something that we can\'t solve here, even if we 
devoted the entire TML to it (which we should not).


Hugh Foster sez:
<Opposed to that is the fact that our previously mentioned group are all 
English (as am I), and we can\'t get guns here unless we\'re criminals...>

   Absolutely classic British humor if you ask me...  :-)  I can picture 
the Monty Python skit now: 
(man walks into shop) 
   "Hello, I\'d like to buy a gun please."  
   "That depends. Are you a criminal?"
   "Of course."
   (shop owner pulls out an Uzi and places it on the counter)
   "Good. \'Cause if you an ordinary citizen, I couldn\'t let you have it. 
By the way, it\'s just a formality really, but do you have your criminal 
permit?"
   "A permit? I have to have a permit to be a criminal?"
   "Why of course silly. Otherwise, how would I know that you weren\'t 
some honest citizen trying to sneak in here and buy a gun."

   You get the idea...

<Blush, blush. I wrote a Visual Basic thingie that loads a flat file 
(heard that before) of subsector data and prints the map (and unlike TN, 
it prints in black on white rather than with a black background that 
takes years to print and knackers yer printer). If anyone\'s intersted 
I\'ll uploadit to CompuServe for absolutely nothing at all. Kind, ain\'t I 
? >

   I don\'t do Compuserve, but am interested in what you have done. 
Could e-mail me your home address? I\'ll pay for postage on the

   One last bit of commentary. The subject of "Real World Politics" is 
an interesting one, really, and a nice change of pace. But we\'re all 
pretty much from different backgrounds here, and when we start to stray 
into the "Real World", somebody is quite likely to get their feelings 
hurt. I could go on a bit about why Americans have this fixation on 
private property, and why we as a culture have this paranoia about 
somebody coming along and taking it away from us unless we have a way to 
defend it, but I\'m not sure that ninety percent of you really give a 
rat\'s ass, and at any rate, you\'d rather see a new neat design for a TL 
15 attack speeder. So let\'s get back to Traveller, huh? <g> If you wish 
to e-mail me with your "Real World" questions about the United States of 
America, I\'m told I\'m rather diplomatic, and able to give intelligent 
commentary from time to time.

Mr. Alvin Plummer sez:
<Greetings!  I come bearing humor!
If anyone has ever heard of the article REAL MEN DON\'T PLAY
FANTASYROLE PLAYING GAMES, I have a complete compilation
(courtesy of one of the sysops at io.com) of the file in question.  For those
who don\'t know the  article, it covers scenarios surrounding the four general
types of gamers:  The real Man, the Real Roleplayer, the Loonie, and the 
Munchkin.  Here are a few examples....>

OK, here goes nothing:

Favorite kind of starship:
REAL MEN: A 200,000 ton dreadnaught with 6G acceleration, plenty of 
armor, and a meson gun so big, it is the only weapon the ship can carry 
<insert Tim Allen grunt here>.
REAL ROLEPLAYERS: The Millenium Falcon _or_ a far trader that has
been similarly modified over the course of three to five years of adventuring
by the player-characters.
LOONIES: Anyone who insists on flying around in an unarmed ship.
MUNCHKINS: An unmodified scout/courier.

Favorite movies to make into an adventure:
REAL MEN: Any Arnold movie; Where Eagles Dare; Star Wars: Return of
the Jedi
REAL ROLEPLAYERS: 2010: Odyssey Two; Star Wars: The Empire
Strikes Back; Alien
LOONIES: Plan Nine From Outer Space; Star Trek V.
MUNCHKINS: Robotech (the pilot for the series); anything else with giant 
robots.

Favorite Virus Strain:
REAL MEN: A dead Virus strain.
REAL ROLEPLAYERS: \'Hobbyist\' strain. 
LOONIES: Any Virus strain.
MUNCHKINS: Virus? Gee, you think that computer is infected with Virus? 
But I just hooked it up to my ship\'s computer....

Favorite personal sidearm:
REAL MEN: A TL 15 man-portable rapid pulse fusion gun, an assault 
shotgun that fires on full auto, or a VRF gauss gun (don\'t worry, he\'ll 
figure out how to make it man-portable).
REAL ROLEPLAYERS: Body pistol, 4 mm gauss rifle, a laser rifle.
LOONIES: A laser pistol, 4 mm gauss pistol, a pie.
MUNCHKINS: Anything that the local level won\'t allow them to carry
(what do you mean I\'m going to jail?!).

Traveller Dice:
REAL MEN: Carry their favorite 20-sider, a 10-sider, and about a dozen 
6-siders so they can roll damage on the bad guys they hit with their 
favorite weapon.
REAL ROLEPLAYERS: Carry two of each dice required for the game, in
case one ends up under the table or behind the couch.
LOONIES: A 20-sider, a 10-sider, and a 6-sider in every color currently 
on the market (and some that aren\'t); an 8-sider and a 4-sider that came 
with some 20 and 10-siders they bought once and now don\'t know what to 
do with.
MUNCHKINS: The off-white 20-sider that came with the game (and can
only be read under intense lighting conditions); a 10-sider they found under 
the table at an AD&D convention; two 6-siders they stole from their 
sister\'s "Dream Date" game.

When confronted with a potentially hostile force:
REAL MEN: Lock and load a magazine and make a quick check of their 
grenade supply.
REAL ROLEPLAYERS: Attempt to negotiate, then use only enough force
to get the $%^$@# out of there.
LOONIES: Drop their rifles and announce they come in peace.
MUNCHKINS: Ask if it is too late to announce that they were taking their 
weapons with them (or try a leaping kick, just like in Mortal Kombat).

When landing on a new planet:
REAL MEN: Scan the surface for potential targets.
REAL ROLEPLAYERS: Scan the surface to determine if there are signs of 
intelligent life or habitation.
LOONIES: Just land, open the door and announce, "We\'re here!".
MUNCHKINS: Forget to check if the air is breathable.

During the Rebellion:
REAL MEN: Fought it out until they were dead or ran out of ammuntion.
REAL ROLEPLAYERS: Attempted to negotate a peaceful settlement or
went into cold sleep.
LOONIES: Supported Lucan.
MUNCHKINS: Were busy playing with their G.I. Joe aircraft carriers.

Buy TNE products because:
REAL MEN: They want hardware, lots of hardware <insert another Tim
Allen grunt here>.
REAL ROLEPLAYERS: Like the adventure ideas.
LOONIES: To complete their collection.
MUNCHKINS: They liked the cover art.

A typical gaming session consists of:
REAL MEN: Playing out the fire fight they got into last gaming session.
REAL ROLEPLAYERS: 70 percent role-playing, 30 percent chatting about 
other stuff.

LOONIES: 10 percent role-playing, 90 percent chatting about other 
things.
MUNCHKINS: 20 percent role-playing, 50 percent chatting about other 
things, 30 percent fighting over rules interpretations.

All for now...

    over this letter so I could construct a coherent essay.

    First point:  some things definitely are or are not 
    copyrightable, no matter what someone\'s lawyers say, or how 
    you feel (or think I feel) about respecting other\'s 
    copyrights, or how you feel about the viability of your

    Mr.  Sari says it very well -- certain things are not 
    copyrightable.  He overlooks one significant factor in 
    copyright law that provides TSR, et.  al lawyers their 
    maneuvering room.  The rules differ for fiction and 
    non-fiction.  The above is strictly true with regards to 
    non-fiction -- "technical work" copyrights are very narrow in 
    scope.  Fiction has somewhat looser rules; characters and 
    storylines are copyrightable.  Here\'s the question:  are game 
    rules and supplements technical works (argument:  the "rules" 
    are instructions for a process [playing a roleplaying game] 
    and supplements are tables of data for that process) or works 
    of fiction (argument:  role-playing -> fiction & game-> 
    entertainment)?  My personal (Disclaimer:  I am not a lawyer, 
    just an intelligent laywoman -- the kind that serves on a 
    JURY) take on the issue is that game rules are technical 
    works -- the fiction is the role-playing session itself.  The 
    session is the piece of artwork -- are "How to Write" books 
    considered fiction for copyright purposes because you can use 
    the methods therein to write novels?  As for supplements -- 
    adventure modules seem to be pretty clearly fiction; data 
    tables are clearly not, especially data drawn directly from 
    the real world, such as 2300AD\'s near-star map.

    Second point:  disagreement over the validity of a claim of 
    copyright or copyright infringement does not make those 
    debating the issue a bunch of anarchists who don\'t respect 
    the rights of artists to be compensated for their creative 
    work.  As I understand it, the areas of copyright for 
    fictional works are fairly well understood; those for 
    technical works are still being debated, especially with the 
    advent of new publishing media (on-line services, CD-ROM 
    collections, etc.)  and new forms of "works" (software being 
    the most notorious troublemaker).  "Dr.  Dobb\'s Journal" and 
    "Communications of the ACM", both professional journals for 
    us computer types, have had many articles (ACM has a regular 
    column) covering the legal issues surrounding copyrights of 
    software and online materials and software patents.  Having 
    read many of those articles, I can tell you that the issues 
    are still muddled, and there are legal precedents going 
    several contradictory directions.  

*   Ah, a true anarchist..:-).  Really, you may well be right,
*   BUT, I think we have to balance what we do and share freely
*   with what might hurt the revenues of GDW -- and I while I
*   would not feel too bad about ripping off, say, Microsoft, GDW
*   is just a small group of people who have managed to make a
*   living on a small market with tight margins.  They deserve
*   praise, support, and nurturing, lest they go the way of the
*   dodo and SPI.
*
*   Copyright laws are there to promote the just treatment of
*   those who live by their creativity, and I for one feel that
*   both the letter and the spirit of those laws deserve respect.

    I am offended that Mr.  Howie considers me "a true anarchist" 
    and implies that I believe it\'s okay to "rip off" Microsoft, 
    GDW, or anyone else, or that I don\'t believe in "the just 
    treatment of those who live by their creativity", merely 
    because I pointed out that certain game companies have been 
    making very aggressive and very questionable interpretations 
    of the copyright laws.  As for promoting the just treatment 
    of those who live by their creativity, I notice that TSR\'s 
    heavy-handed approach (and GDW\'s trifling [comparatively] 
    comments) have "chilled" a great deal of creativity on the 
    net.  Collections of net.authors works (like yours and mine) 
    have been pulled from the Internet because so many people are 
    running like chickens with their heads cut off, squawking 
    "the lawyers are coming, the lawyers are coming!".  Anyone 
    tried to access even the Traveller archives on ftp.mpgn.com 
    lately?  The ones that GDW has never objected to?  As for the 
    various net.books, it looks like you have to find a pirate 
    BBS to get them nowadays, just because one TSR jerk (Rob 
    Depp) rattled a few cages.  Someone says "Lawyer!"  and 
    everyone is running for cover without even looking to see if 
    they are being shot at!  

    BTW, I consider myself a Libertarian Conservative, not an
    Anarchist.

    Third point:  I see far too much of the attitude that "well, 
    they are wrong, and I am right, but I can\'t afford the 
    lawyers anyway, so I might as well give them what they want."  
    This is known as "giving in to blackmail".  Most companies 
    who don\'t have a solid legal position are running a bluff -- 
    they can\'t afford to fight mutiple long court battles over a 
    legally tenuous position -- they have to pay their lawyers 
    too, and something Mr.  Sari missed:  if the lawsuit is truly 
    frivolous, the judge can and often will order the PLAINTIFF 
    to pay the legal costs of the defendant.  But as long as 
    everyone panics and grovels at the mere thought of a 
    nastygram from a lawyer, the company gets what it wants 
    without any more expense than running off a few letters.  

    Moral: if you are in the right, and "they" want to take away 
    your rights, make \'em bleed for it.

    Fourth point:  companies indulging in heavy-handed copyright 
    and trademark "defense" in the past have reaped more damage 
    in loss of goodwill than they ever gained by successful 
    defense of their copyright/trademark.  TSR is shooting 
    themselves in the foot (or rather, they are allowing Rob Depp
    to shoot them in the foot).  SEA (developers of ARC 
    compression) lost massive goodwill in the BBS community when 
    they went after Phil Katz over PKARC/PKXARC.  They won the 
    legal battle and lost the marketing war.  Phil Katz went on 
    to develop a more efficient compression scheme (ZIP) of his 
    own, and SEA\'s perceived bullying of Katz encouraged most of 
    the BBS community to dump ARC and embrace ZIP.  Almost no BBS
    and few distributers use ARC anymore -- the archivers of 
    choice are ZIP ( ubiquitous and fast), ARJ (proprietary and
    efficient), and LZH (slow, tight and free).

    Chrysler\'s persecution of Jeep\'s Bar in Colorado somewhere 
    over the Jeep trademark made "60 Minutes" and did not impress
    anyone with Chrysler\'s virtue and decency.  Apparently their 
    lawyers tried to maintain that even though the owner\'s first 
    name was "Jeep", he couldn\'t name the bar after himself 
    because Chrysler owned the Jeep trademark!  I guess they were
    afraid someone would confuse a bar & grill with a truck!
    (chance of product confusion is required to prove trademark 
    infringement).

    Final point:  I don\'t "nurture" businesses.  I buy their 
    products IF and only if they sell a quality product, that I 
    want, at a price I am willing to pay.  I don\'t believe it is 
    my responsiblity to subsidize mediocrity just to keep a 
    company from going under.  From all I have heard, SPI died of 
    mismanagement, as do many businesses.  I see enough of this 
    attitude in the OS/2 echoes ("we should buy mediocre OS/2 
    programs so that companies will be encouraged to write more 
    mediocre OS/2 apps, which will somehow guarantee the success 
    of OS/2").  If GDW, or WordPerfect, or IBM, or TSR wants my 
    business ("support"), produce a quality product that I want 
    at a reasonable price.  Period.  It is a ridiculous argument 
    that we should put up with nonsense from ANY company because 
    they are "just a small group of people who have managed to 
    make a living on a small market with tight margins".  If GDW 
    or anyone else produces a quality product, they deserve our 
    praise.  If they produce a poor or mediocre product, they 
    deserve our criticism and not our financial support.  Fair 
    enough?

    Conclusion:  In my opinion, use of game *rules* to develop
    your *own* adventures and backgrounds should not constitute
    copyright infringement.  Before you cite Mayfair vs.  TSR, 
    note that this was settled out-of-court -- TSR maybe had 
    legal grounds on the AD&D trademark issue, and Mayfair 
    wouldn\'t or couldn\'t afford the legal costs.  Putting 
    vehicle/weapon/framistat design equations in a spreadsheet or 
    program is NOT a copyright infringement -- and any numeric 
    lookup table can be reduced to an equation, so they should 
    not be copyrightable.  

    Scanning CT/MT/TNE books into your computer and cutting a 
    CD-ROM/ distributing on the Internet/etc.  is very clearly 
    copyright infringement (aka plagiarism), and I DO NOT (AND 
    NEVER HAVE) advocate plagiarism.  It would be nice if GDW 
    would license or sell the rights for a nominal fee to the 
    old, out-of-print products that they have (by their own 
    admission) no intention of reprinting, but if they don\'t, 
    we\'re stuck until the copyright expires.  (Another 50+ years 
    or so...)

    Grey areas (in my opinion, not to be confused with the law) 
    would include writing fiction based on the GDW copyrighted 
    background materials -- a "derivative work" is considered 
    infringing, but is a short story based on an RPG background 
    (a different form of copyrightable work) "derivative"?  
    Probably.  A movie based on a book is a "derivative" work.  
    Is an adventure (written by me) based on GDW\'s background 
    (3rd Imperium/Shattered Imperium/Virus) "derivative"?  
    Definitely arguable that it is.  Is it desirable given the 
    objective of encouraging creative works?  Probably not -- if 
    an adventure based on a specific background is "derivative", 
    you can\'t sell an Virus/3rd Imp.  adventure to anyone but GDW 
    without a release from GDW (or a Darksun adventure to anyone 
    but TSR) . This creates a monopoly buyer, who has all 
    advantages over the seller -- he sets the price, dictates 
    payment schedule, etc.  Historically, monopolies do not 
    result in anything like "fair" pricing -- and without 
    adequate recompense, you will see NO "creative works". 
    Unreasonably monopolistic copyrights are just as destructive 
    to the creative market as no copyrights, perhaps more so.

    The other issue is the reaction to bullying that I have 
    observed on the Internet and elsewhere.  The only way to stop 
    a bully is to stand up to him and, if he won\'t back off, hit 
    back.  If you give him what he wants, he will just come back 
    and bully you some more later on.  If you give into a 
    blackmailer, he\'ll just come back for more.

    If you see a wrong being done or condoned, and say nothing 
    because "it doesn\'t affect me", just remember that "The only 
    thing necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do 
    nothing."  

    Please, please note that I am reacting to the ATTITUDE of 
    various self-panickers on the net, and I am not calling 
    anyone (except that twit from TSR) a bully.  I don\'t doubt 
    that someone will mistake my meaning anyway... :-(


    And lastly, GDW\'s point-of-view:

    write one) containing non-copyrightable material, and that I

    anyone\'s permisson, because I don\'t need to.

    That\'s it...  for now.

    For an in-depth understanding of the American fascination 
    with firearms, I strongly recommend "Guns, Crime and Freedom" 
    by Wayne LaPierre.  It recently appeared (rather prominently 
    displayed) in bookstores around here (Louisiana), so it 
    should be findable in bookstores just across the border (I 
    don\'t remember if Detroit or Buffalo is closer for you).  I 
    don\'t know if Canadian bookstores or libraries would carry 
    it, as it deals with the basis of the 2nd Amendment of the 
    U.S.  Constitution and its current abuse -- probably not of 
    general interest in Canada.  

    BTW, you Americans who don\'t understand why we should be 
    allowed to carry guns should also read this book.  You may 
    not agree with it, but at least you will be fully informed on
    the issue.

*   A small statistic I found rather profound.  Winnipeg and New
*   Orleans.  Both cities in the population range of 500,000.
*   Winnipeg is actually closer to 600,000, which makes the
*   statistic even more profound.  So far this year, there have
*   been 317 murders in New Orleans.  Here in Winnipeg?  16...and
*   Winnipeg has a higher murder rate than many Canadian cities.
*   Scary...

    I can\'t answer for Winnipeg, as I have never been there.  
    However, I\'ll take a stab at New Orleans, as I live in 
    Metairie, an unincorporated suburb of New Orleans.  We get a 
    good view of N\'Awlins politics from just over the parish 
    line.  (1) You skewed the statistics by picking New Orleans 
    -- N.O.  is NOT a typical U.S.  city in terms of murder 
    statistics -- it has one of the worst murder rates in the 
    U.S., as our politicos are so fond of telling us when asking 
    for higher taxes and tighter, ever more oppressive gun laws.  
    (2) Counter-example:  I live in Jefferson Parish, a heavily 
    developed, mostly unincorporated parish (county for you 
    non-Lousianians) right next to Orleans Parish (City of New 
    Orleans parish).  Jefferson has approximately the same 
    population as New Orleans proper.  We have had about 8 
    murders this year...  and almost all of them resulted in 
    arrests, which is not true of New Orleans.  

    Reasons:  (1) New Orleans has notoriously corrupt police 
    department that isn\'t known for its crime-fighting, to say 
    the least.  (2) The city government is notoriously corrupt 
    and bankrupt as well; there is not enough money for the 
    police department to keep functioning.  Most police cars are 
    idle from lack of maintenance; there isn\'t much patrol work 
    done.  The cops are not appreciated by the community; either 
    they are perceived as shaking down merchants, and brutalizing 
    minorities, or they are perceived as not being around when 
    needed.  So, you have little community cooperation with the 
    police.  (3) Rampant crime, high tax rates, and deteriorating 
    infrastructure are driving businesses and taxpaying citizens 
    out of the city, leaving a population of the very rich social 
    elite and 3rd generation welfare clients.  I.e., you have a 
    population where the producers are leaving as fast as they 
    can, leaving a dying city inhabited by high-end and low-end 
    parasites.  The high-end parasites commit the graft and 
    corruption that bankrupts the city, and the low-end parasites 
    commit the violent crimes.  (4) The education system is 
    bankrupt and shattered; poor children grow up with no real 
    education but the streets.  They don\'t learn how to be 
    productive citizens.  (5) Orleans Parish, like Washington DC 
    (the other bad example of violent American cities cited) has 
    fairly oppressive gun laws -- only criminals and the cops 
    tend to have guns.  It\'s safe to be criminal in Orleans, as 
    long as you avoid the cops.  (6) New Orleans is the 2nd 
    biggest drug port in the US.  Some years it\'s first (rival is 
    Miami).  Violence and the drug business go together.  

    By counterpoint, here in Jefferson Parish, we have (1) an 
    honest Sheriff\'s department (Harry Lee\'s political opponents 
    to the contrary), (2) no city government (but the usual 
    questionable bunch of crooks in the parish government), (3) 
    about half the productive taxpayers fleeing New Orleans 
    settle in Jefferson Parish, the rest go to the North Shore or 
    St.Bernard parish.  (4) We have a good educational system.  
    (5) A lot of people own guns here, and the sheriff\'s 
    department is friendly to the idea of civilian gun ownership.  
    It ain\'t safe to be criminal here -- burglars and armed 
    robbers get shot every so often while committing a crime.  
    Just this week, some idiot got shot while trying to rob a 
    pawn shop; last year some thugs tried to hijack a car -- the 
    owner shot and killed one of them and wounded another while 
    they were driving off.  Deputies later caught them when they 
    turned up at a hospital with gunshot wounds.  It is not safe 
    to attack people here -- your victim might fight back.

    As for Traveller:  how do your players like their characters 
    to obey the usual oppressive weapon laws on most Imperial 
    planets, and thus wander around disarmed while the local 
    criminals use whatever illegal guns they like?  What, they 
    don\'t like it?  In our games, characters (a) refuse to leave 
    the extra-territorial starport so they don\'t have to be 
    defensive, or (b) break the law and walk around armed anyway. 
    Yes, you can have the local cops bust the characters for 
    illegal weapons -- but notice that to the players, it doesn\'t
    seem fair that they should be disarmed and the bad guys fully
    equipped.  Role-playing can be educational.

Hi,

How the heck do I set up the focal array on a small arm laser? I know I 
have to use the light focal array because it\'s a small arm, but according 
to the FFS book, it says that the focal array will be determined later in 
the small arms creation process. I couldn\'t find it, does this mean I 
have to make up the focal array number myself? Pretty much everything 
else seems easy, punching in numbers here and there (trauined monkey 
stuff) but I just can\'t seem to figure out how to create a focal array 
for laser small arms. It\'s driving me batty! =P

Also, are the numbers that proceed the laser designations (eg: 2cm laser 
pistol-13) refer to the focal array? Abd also how do I calculate for 
pulse energy per TNE basic rules for lasers? 

Thanks in advance. Maybe someone could e-mail me a design of a laser 
weapon they created. Thanks again.

  I don\'t believe it!  With the 50% tax rate, plus the 14% G&ST, the Canadian
government should be able to solve all their problems. :-)

  It does?  Perhaps it\'s a case of who has them...  The rate of firearm
related homicides are lower in rural areas of the US than they are in
urban areas of the US.  The rate of *legal* firearm ownership is higher
in rural areas though.  A good example is Washington,D.C.  Highest
law level in the country (per firearms).  If you see a non-cop with
a firearm, it\'s either a criminal or a congress-critter, or a 
congress-critters bodyguards.  Senator Kennedy\'s body guards got caught
toting fully automatic machine pistols in the capital building.  
Unregistered, of course.

 Ob-traveller:  The law level is a general guideline for the planet.  Not
absolute law.  Second, criminals or invading Zho commando groups don\'t
give a rodent\'s hind end for the law level.  Third, remember the Golden
Rule, "Those that have the gold, make the rules."

Deneb has been at the centre of the sector transportation routes since the
ISS LookSee arrived, six centuries ago.  Long renowned for the purity and
quantity of it\'s metals, it\'s wealth and it\'s people\'s naturally outgoing
character made it the natural choice as sector capital in 421.  Until the
Rebellion, Deneb also was the major node of seven of the Megacorporations
sector, with it\'s importance unrivalled by any Imperial world spinward of
Vland.  Today, the Denebii now boasts the second largest naval base in the
Regency, and bears the headquarters of the Regency Quarrentine Service.

Most of the traffic to Deneb use the system as a shipping nexus, rather
than attempt to trade with Deneb itself.  Deneb Highport, 12 million
strong, is the sole site for many financial services in Deneb sector,
ranging from debt servicing in the trillions of credits to a site for
economic
summits concerning the entire sector.  Many, many travellers only see the
starport, and never set foot on Deneb itself. 

The starport is part of the Regency Extraterritorality Zone, and is
outside of Deneb law.  Seeing it, with three-quarters of it\'s commercial
berths empty, is a silent testimony to the awsome consequences of the
Collapse.  Within the port, it\'s opulent, space-wasting architecture
seems to diminish the small knots of traders and merchants that still
circulate in the great throughways and vaulting, gilded halls.  In the
less urbane neighbourhoods, large gaps in the walls and patch-up
jobs to the hull silently convey the message of the Vargr occupation.

The locals are all feverent expansionists, and - even after 70 years -
have a profound hatred of the Vargr.  Vargr with business on Deneb are
advised to stay in well-lit areas, away from the underclass alleys and
hole-ups.  Even in polite company, it is wise to avoid provoking the
locals: stay away from conversation regarding the Rebellion, or the Vargr
minorities on Deneb itself.

Obtaining permission to land on the world of Deneb is a major trial.  Duke
Angelo de la Deneb has given a monopoly on off-world transportation to
Souijomini Enterprises, a company owned jointly by the Duke and Tukera
Lines.  Souijomini first screens any traders and their goods, demanding
exorberant fees to \'process\' any goods to be sold - or even just
transported - to Deneb.  The paperwork takes at least a month, and has
been known to take five years in certain instances.  Any goods higher than
TL C is forbidden on Deneb soil, as part of Deneb\'s irrational \'safety
standards\'.  Also completely forbidden is any form of artwork or gem,
non-Deneb foods, clothing made in the Trojan Rift before the Rebellion, and
currency made on dates ending with odd numbers (VERY bad joss!).  Other
articles may or may not be allowed in, depending on the Deneb Registry of
Interstellar Trade Regulations, recent local prophecies, and The Deneb Way
of Doing Things, as well as the Imperial Trade Code of 1110 (the Regency
Code, while acceptable on the Highport, is considered "a pathetic
substitute to the Imperial code" by the current Duke.)    

After Souijomini is finished, the Deneb Health Service arrives.  Their
main focus is on the visitors themselves, and their duty is to
determine the visitor\'s \'state of karma, health & joss\'.  While their
karmanic requirements are not unusual - rather more humerous and obscure than
anything else - their medical and joss (apparently, a kind of luck)
testing veers between the perposterous and the barbaric.  No one has
actually \'died\' because of the drug use demanded as part of these test,
but many have lost their sight, been blinded or suffered other lasting ill
effects due to these potions and lotions. Perhaps 20% actually pass these
tests, and another 40% quit before the 5-day regime is completed.

Assuming the intrepid visitor has endured this testing with success, he
now must wait for a Scheduled Shuttle to arrive, usually one to four
months, depending on karmanic and psychic conditions.  He will find the
crew of this shuttle - like all Denebii - very kind and attendent to his
welfare, as hospitality it is both "good joss" and commanded (make that
COMMANDED) by the Government.  

At arrival at the underground port, the visitor will have a stripe of red
paint slapped across his forehead, and ten to fifteen ancient man &
women will throw balloons of multi-hued liquids at the visitor.  These
liquids are supposed to help protect the visitor from bad karmanic
influences, and provide good health.  That \'red stripe\' across the
forehead leaves a permament, angry mark, and can only be removed from TL E+
equipment.  Also, several "Holy Amulets" are slapped onto the visitor\'s
neck, wrists and ankles.  Bulky and with annoying bells, these ill-fitting
articles are worn by all Denebii, without exception.  Many traders suspect
that tracking devises and bugs are embedded into these item\'s, also. 
Finally, each and every visitor will be provided with a \'host\', who
provides both excellent advice on local mores and suave, subtle attempts
to convert the visitor into a Wondfellow, a believer in the local
superstitions which masquerade as religion. 

All visitors are restricted to the capital of Somewi F\'id.  Even here, in
this small city of 38 million, several points can be made regarding Deneii
culture useful for the casual visitor.  First, expect large crowds to
follow you wherever you go.  This would apply with any visitor, especially
a visitor that varies greatly from the Denebii small, lithe physique, with
golden red skin tones and bright red eyes.  While most refrain from
actual physical contact, mass hysterial "touch-feel" attacks
occassionally have been known to break out, where entire neighbourhoods
trample on each other in a mad craze to touch the visitor.  Since the
visitor has been stripped of even stun sticks and Mace at the groundport, the
mood of the crowd should always be carefully watched.

Second, remember that while you the visitor have near total freedom within 
Somewi F\'id, the locals have no freedoms whatsoever.  This is not only
because of the Orwellian nature of everyday life, but the dictatorial,
erratic religion of Deneb.  Everyday, the Government downloads information
to every Denebii on what they may or may not do, not only for the Public
Safety, but to avoid The Collapse.  The Collapse, in Denebii theology, is
related to the Imperial Collapse but much more entwined with supernatural
elements.  To keep the Collapse from arriving - referred to as The First
Denebii Mission - a chaotic, everchanging set of superstitious actions
must, MUST be done, exactly at the right time, exactly in the right
manner.  The most common relate to speaking gibberish, inappropriate
laughter, always walking X paces at certain sites, etc.

While sometimes Denebii society seems to be on the edge of a total psychotic
meltdown, the only time of danger to the traveller is on a "Holy Day",
where manias can sweep the entire planet in minutes... at these times, the
visitor is advised to hole up in their \'guest rooms\', and open the door
for No One, for ANY reason.  These manias will come in waves across the
planet, but would reach their apex at midnight.  But, by morning, hardly a
trace of the previous madness can be found, although debris and bodies
(some alive, some dead) are everywhere....  A Denebii day lasts about 23
hours, for your information. 

Enjoy your stay.

S.WENSICAA SHUGILII

by M0B

My own player character from an old MegaTraveller campaign.  

The plot (or what I can remember of it) had the PCs as crew of a Kinuniur 
(sp?) "cruiser" taking a nobleman (one of the PCs) from Mora/Mora to get in
contact witthe Dulinor faction.  

We were taking some vital message from Norris, but I
either can\'t remember what it was, or we weren\'t told.  My character somehow
got on board as Ship\'s Chaplain(!), but was found out soon enough.

Note: despite some similarities to a certain ST:TNG character, this was 
written before that series was televised in Australia.  It was also written
long before all this New Era stuff, which I know nothing about. 

Background
The S.101 project began with great secrecy in the robotics labs of the 
Naasirka Endowment on Vland some ten years ago, based on a partial set 
of blueprints stolen from rival robotics manufacturer Makhidkarun.  
Originally conceived as a Contact & Liaison robot to liaise with 
alien races for the Imperial Scout Service, the S.101 project was 
abandoned when the Naasirka scientists could not find a suitable 
compromise between fuel capacity and performance.  The only prototype 
created, [Simulicrum] Wensicaa Shugilii is therefore the first and 
last of its kind.  

About the same time, NaaSec Group (Naarsirka\'s industrial espionage 
agency) managed, through careful theft, to secure a TL16 brain from 
Star Patterns Trading, the Hiver Federation robotics company.  This 
brain was 
too was abandoned, when the Naasirka researchers found they could not
mass-produce the stolen Hiver Brain. The corporation\'s indecision 
about the robot\'s function is reflected in S.Wensicaa\'s eclectic 
programming.
 
Despairing about what to do with its multi-million credit investment, 
Naasirka gave the robot over to its Marketing and Propaganda division 
to use in company advertising.  S.Wensicaa was given star billing in 
several trade and robotics Fairs in Vland sector in the years before 
the war, receiving great acclaim and earning Naarsirka\'s robotics 
division enormous prestige.  Naturally enough, Makhidkarun and other 
robot manufacturers are very interested in how Naasirka (not well-known 
for innovation) were able to construct such a sophisticated machine.  
Although they have their suspicions, the rival megacorporations have 
not been able to prove that the robot was constructed using stolen 
technology.

In late 1116, just before news of Strephon\'s death filtered through 
to Vland, S.Wensicaa and a Naasirka attendant began a leisurely 
journey to Mora/Mora, there to attend the 33rd Spinward Marches 
Triennial Technology Exposition.  S.Wensicaa is travelling in the 
guise of a normal human (thus breaking the 37th amendment of the 
Shudusham Concords) as part of a Naasirka publicity stunt.  S.Wensicaa 
was to arrive at the Expo unannounced. He would suddenly reveal himself as 
a robot, therefore showing that Naasirka robot-design is so good, 
one could travel across three sectors undetected.  

At least that was the plan.  Unfortunately, the civil war got in the 
way.  When the starlanes through the Corridor were cut, S.Wensicaa and his 
human companion found themselves stranded on a backwater world for nearly 
two years.  Although the human intended to return to Vland if transport 
was available, she was unfortunately killed during a Vargr raid.  Unaware 
of the change of plans, S.Wensicaa followed on with his original 
instructions and found a berth on one of the last civilian convoys 
to make it through to the Marches. 

Arriving at Mora in 1119, S.Wensicaa found that there were no 
company representatives to meet him. The Vilani megacorporations 
had declared the Ziru Sirka and had either sold off their assets 
or moved them back to Vland Sector.  As a Naasirka "asset", S.Wensicaa 
has therefore reasoned that it is his duty to return to Vland 
immediately.  Unfortunately, Vland sector is presently cut off to 
normal shipping because of the anarchy in the Corridor.  Furthermore, 
the robot\'s credit card is now all but useless in the Marches and public 
outrage at the Vilani megacorporations\' actions is so strong, it is in 
fact quite dangerous to even admit a connection with Naasirka at 
present.  With so many bankrupted shareholders, unsatisfied creditors and
entrenched workers ruined by the sudden sell-off, if S.Wensicaa was exposed 
as a Naasirka robot, it is possible that he might even be repossessed!  
To S.Wensicaa this is unthinkable: allowing his superior technology to 
fall into the hands of a rival company would constitute disloyalty to 
Naasirka.

Because it was thought that the S.101s were going to spend much  of their 
time in the field, S.Wensicaa has been programmed to be self-repairing.  
This was one of Naarsirka\'s first advances into the area of 
autonomous, self-repairing robots, and is only partially successful.  
In particular, the Hiver brain needs frequent servicing and care that 
the robot itself cannot provide.  He is aware that if his brain does not 
receive a major service within the next twelve months, its functioning 
will begin to be affected.  Therefore, he must reach a Naasirka facility 
soon.  Remember also that every five days or so S.Wensicaa must find a 
source of energy to replenish his fuel supply.  He can simply tap into 
a ship\'s power plant or similar energy source by means of the power 
interface built into a finger.



Meeting S.Wensicaa
The Referee has many alternatives to introduce S.Wensicaa into the 
campaign.  He will most likely be met in a starport or Traveller\'s 
Aid hostel, seeking a ship willing to take him closer to his destination.

Virtually penniless, he may lure the players with promises of huge 
payments from his employers (which he will probably not name) if they 
will take him to Vilani territory.  S.Wensicaa may even consider 
hijacking the ship the players are on if he is desperate enough, using 
the gun concealed in his stomach pouch.  It is also likely that 
representatives of Star Patterns Trading are seeking him, in order 
to get their brain back.  S.Wensicaa might go to the players for help, or
perhaps the players themselves may be contracted by the Hivers (or any 
other rival company) to seek out the robot and retrieve the valuable 
brain.  Even more extreme, perhaps S.Wensicaa has reasoned that the 
best way he can serve Naasirka is by damaging a competitor robotics company
(LSP, Spinward Specialities?) or assassinating a key rival (Duke 
Norris, Dulinor?).  He may try to rope the players into such a s
cheme with assurances of great rewards.  As a bizarre longshot, 
maybe the "Real" Strephon factionists need S.Wensicaa, to create 
a plausible double of the dead emperor.  

The robot is not above forging documents to further its ends, if it 
can justify how Naasirka would benefit from such action.  Indeed, 
as long as it can find a company-approved rationale, S.Wensicaa 
Shugilii is capable of almost anything.


Appearance
S.Wensicaa has been constructed to have the classical good looks of a
full-blooded Vilani male, and the emotion simulation program 
he has been equipped with is Naasirka\'s finest.  Like the robot, 
the program too is a prototype, and it suffers from several quirks.  
S.Wensicaa will scratch, sniff, sneeze, pass wind, fidget, yawn, and 
excuse himself from company to relieve himself, often at the most 
inappropriate times.  He can also shave, eat, have his hair cut and 
function sexually. He will often to refer to his "dear wife and child" 
back on Vland, and even has a "family holograph" in his wallet showing him
sitting with a woman and a young boy.  Beyond this however, details 
about his "family" are vague.  S.Wensicaa will strenuously deny being 
anything but a human; his programming prevents this, even if faced 
with incontrovertible evidence to the contrary. 

S. Wensicaa is dressed in a conservative business suit and carries a 
stylish briefcase and large suitcase about with him.  The suitcase is 
extremely heavy (containing servicing and repair equipment), but S.
Wensicaa can of course lift it effortlessly.  The U.P.P. given in his 
papers is 898DA7; he is described as a 32 year-old Junior Executive 
(rank 4) in Naasirka\'s Client Service division (known in-house as 
"Propaganda & Marketing").  S.Wensica has also prepared excellent 
forged papers with the rather artless pseudonym "Wendell Miller", 
giving his occupation as "university student."

*This program must be kept in CPU at all times.  Among other things, 
it compels the robot to obey the following directives (sorry Isaac):

 1. A robot may not, through action or inaction, allow Naasirka 
Corporation or its High Executives to come to harm.

 2. A robot may not, through action or inaction, allow any of 
Naasirka Corporation\'s property to come to harm, except where 
doing so would conflict with the first directive.

 3. A robot must obey any order given it by a High Executive of 
Naasirka Corporation, unless that order conflicts with the first or 
second directives.

 4. A robot must seek to preserve its own existence, unless doing 
so would conflict with the first, second or third directives.



EQUIPMENT:
-Robotic repair kit (suitcase); useful for rudimentary repairs and 
servicing in the field.

-Gauss pistol and 4 magazines (note that this weapon has been designed 
by NaaSec to be concealed in the visceral cavity, where it is 
virtually undetectable).

-Naarsirka credit card, in the name of "Wensicaa Shugilii" (note 
the  "S." is absent); unlimited credit.

-Vlandian Passport, also in the name of "Wensicaa Shugilii". Company 
rank could now offer the bearer limited diplomatic immunity.

-Travellers Aid Society  membership, "Wensicaa Shugilii".

-Limited gravitic field generator concealed in belt (reduces the 
robot\'s weight to 95 kg.)

-Several dozen holo cartridges, mainly containing promotional material 
about Naasirka\'s robotics operations.  Many feature S.Wensica. It would
be breaking directive one to broadcast these to anyone, unless there is 
a chance of a sale.   These could be taped over, but this would be 
transgressing the second directive.

-A briefcase containing personal items typical of a Vilani 
businessman, including several faked letters from loved ones.

***Civility circuits have been disabled - you have been warned! ***
This is the most offensively racist comment I have seen in a while. 
Has Mr Pugliese considered the economic factors linking to 
crime/violence? I live in Manchester/UK and the place is a cultural 
melting pot, and by and large racism is not a great. There is an 
alarming level of violence in certain areas (Moss Side), which seems 
to be linked closely to drugs/organised crime. As far as I can see 
this has been assisted through lack of opportunity to make a decent 
living through legal employment - ever heard of the mafia?!? The kind 
of attitude shown is what IMHO CAUSES RACISM TO PERSIST!!!!

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I\'m sorry that Mr. Eldritch has such a hard time dealing with reality
that he has to fall back on such PC rhetoric. Get your head out of
the sand & look at Bosnia & Rwanda, just for starters. There, that wasn\'t 
so hard was it? (Or perhaps you\'ve got more PC rhetoric to spew forth?)

Denying the existence of cultural friction renders you incapable of dealing
with it. How can you when you say it\'s racist to even admit that it exists?
Of course we all know that it does & that alot of the ills in the world
can be traced to it. I say that it\'s better to admit that the problem
exists so that steps can be taken to alleviate it. Take your own advice
& get *your* blinders off!

My report on what happens when you drop things from orbit is 
forthcoming, probably tomorrow.  Some general things Ive noticed.

-For dense aerodynamic shapes dropped close to the earth, the impact 
speed will be nowhere near the terminal velocity.  The net effect is that 
almost all of the potential energy will be converted to kinetic energy.

-For objects dropped from around 500 km, the impact energy will be 
comprable to the explosive energy of TNT of the SAME mass.  I mean within 
25% or less.

-A 10 kg tungsten rod dropped from 500km will impact at 3000+ m/s with an 
energy of 45 MJ!  Treated as HVAP this gives a PEN of 234.
Treated as APDS it gives a pen of 432.

-This is too small a rod to put a reliable tracking and guidance system 
and so would only be practical as a submunition.  Complete units would be 
substantially more massive, hence substantially more devastating.

More to Come

First of all, I must say that I completely sympathize with all
the people who live in the post-Collapse era, The New Era, as I
have finally diagnosed and rid my system of that most annoying
of pests, the Stealth C virus.  I must also categorically state
that:

     If I ever catch the being who wrote that virus I shall
     unleash upon it all of my pent-up Muslim zeal and the
     last seven years of cumulative martial arts training that
     I have acquired in various styles and from the U.S. Army
     R.O.T.C. unarmed combat program.

Now, I shall continue with Traveller material, avoiding the
dangerous morass of non-Traveller related material, such as my
ownership of weapons of mass destruction like my personal Glock
22, .40 caliber handgun, my membership in the National Rifle
Association and the Republican Party, and partnership in a
gunsmithing business, that seems to spontaneously propagate,
after I ask Mr. Miracle:

"Sir, do you propose that our discussions of the issues of the
 day have no relevance to Traveller?  If so, would you mind
 terribly organizing a gun-rights mailing list, as a comrade-
 in-arms, if you will, of the Objectivism mailing list?"

Thank you.

On the subject of roleplaying:


Favorite TNE Mission Types

Real Men:  Smash \'N Grab (especially Meteoric Assault)
Real Roleplayers:  Stardust (covert.ops)
Loonies:  Cold Recovery (especially behind the Black Curtain)
Munchkins:  Anything neato (especially where "We get cool stuff.")


Education "Lifepath" of Choice

Real Men:  None.  "Who needs it?  The RCMC taught me all I need
           to know to do meteoric assaults!"
Real Roleplayers:  Hiver Technical Academy.  "The HTA is the
                   best opportunity to get off-planet and excel
                   on an interstellar level."
Loonies:  Pre-Industrial University and Technical Priesthood.
          "\'Cause all the techno-stuff out there is soooo scary,
          I need to know the right magic to control it!"
Munchkins:  None.  "Why, dude?  Just like beam us somewhere that
            cool-type stuff will happen, ya\' know?"


Favored Political Structure

Real Men:  Centrist.  "If you got it, uh, use it.  I got it and
           you don\'t, see?"
Real Roleplayers:  Federalist.  "The current political climate
                   indicates that the most well-funded projects
                   will be in this vein.  Plus, it will encourage
                   our diversity, which we all know is our
                   strength, right?"
Loonies:  Anarchy.  "Let\'s see how well Virus can run the
          government for us, and then we won\'t have to do so
          much work!"  Also note that Socialism/Communism is
          pretty much along the same line.
Munchkins:  None.  "Political structure?  What\'s that?  Is that
            the building that the government lives in?"


Favorite Interplanetary Sport

Real Men:  Massed fleet engagements (the bigger, the better)
Real Roleplayers:  Solar sail yacht racing (the more money at
                   stake the better, not to mention the time
                   frame involved...)
Loonies:  Grav pong (as played by Virus competitors)
Munchkins:  Sun-diving ("Gosh, it\'s warm in here...")

On the Reformation Coalition political structure:

I am just formulating this paradigm, and am not entrenched in it,
yet...  So please feel free to *flame*.  [I prefer medium well.]

I have cast the Aubani world tendency, and "foreign policy" much
as that of the JFK era Democrats, for lack of a better comparison.
My one white player chose this as his homeworld based on the _Path
of Tears_ description of an average citizen of Aubaine.

I have tentatively identified elements of the \'hidden\' Bolshevik
party platform, from the Soviet Revolution era (for the history-
challenged in the audience), in the governmental tendencies of
Oriflamme.

I think I have sighted Haiti in the Luhtalan manner of thought, or
perhaps Rwanda (Vargr, anyone?).

The Balduri have definitely got an oriental bent to much of their
thinking, highly practical (some read: arrogant).  It is interesting
to me that both of my oriental players chose Baldur for their
homeworld based on the _Path of Tears_ discriptions of an average
citizen of Baldur, without prior knowledge of the other\'s choice.

The Fijans have some strong elements of British/Canadian politics
in their make-up, especially British, though, perhaps with some
Scandanavian influence.  I found it unusual, again, that both of
my Pakistani players chose Fija as their homeworld, without knowledge
of the other\'s choice, based on the _Path of Tears_ description of
an average citizen of Fija.

I think the Nimbans are all disciples of Margaret What\'s-her-name,
the anthropologist...

The Spiri, well, ummm...  Do they grow bananas for their nutritional
value, or too smoke the peels?

The Schalli have definitely got the markings of aborigines,
especially American Indians.  I have a feeling that, in my campaign,
that the Traditionalists will triumph in the end.  Mostly because
I have sympathies in that direction.  (Isn\'t it great to be able
to play God?)  Did I hear someone earlier say "First Nations"?
That\'s a helluva supremecist term if I\'ve ever heard one!!! (and I 
have... about ME!)  Do you chaps in Canada actually call the Indians
that?  My goodness, it\'s worse than I ever imagined!

I will not discuss Zips, because they are too diverse culturally,
and politically for accurate \'stereotypization\' (that\'s right, you
heard it here first, STEREOTYPIZATION).  Dave\'s reinventing English,
into ANGLIC.  Coming Soon:  Dave\'s Comprehensive Guide to Idiomatic,
Post-("Clinton-Induced")-Collapse Anglic for Dummies.

I apologize for anyone I may have left out...  and I realize that my
players are NOT a representative sample, or randomly assigned,
however, they do generalize, usually, to descriptions of themselves.

On GDW:

I cannot resist asking y\'all (yes, that\'s proper English in Texas):

Has anyone else noticed that all of GDW\'s current run of role-
playing games is centered around societal recovery after a
holocaust?

I did:  1)  Cadillacs and Dinosaurs
        2)  Twilight: 2000
 3)  Merc: 2000
 4)  Dark Conspiracy
 5)  Traveller:  The New Era

If I didn\'t miss any, they\'re all post-catastrophe...  Interesting.

Mr. Wiseman, oh ye grand Prophet of Doom, why, praytell, is this?
I\'ve admired you\'re handiwork in Twilight: 2000 for years.  I
enjoyed the first edition, and each one after...  But why ALL of
GDW\'s games?  Is this a comment on what you believe the future to
hold?  Or perhaps playing upon the fears of the "common folk" who
have this nightmare of a possible future?  Anyone see a common
thread in American media?  Terminator, Terminator 2, Alien(s), The
Day After, the Clinton Administration, et cetera.  Could be a good
honors thesis.  Too bad I\'ve already got mine approved on "The
effect of mass media coverage distribution on public opinion of
crime and gun control in Houston, Texas, U.S., 1988 to 1993"...

I wasn\'t too familiar with the JFK era Democrats, and instead molded the
Aubani on the ideals espoused by NATO. It works rather well, too. The
entire concept of Common Defence, teamwork, and all that stuff, all taking
place in a structure ready to fall down (remember the conflicts between
Greece and Turkey). Socially, I\'m still working on them :).

I found a very accurate model for Oriflamme in the United States during
the late 1700, early 1800\'s. Manifest Destiny and the Oriflamme world view
seem to have a lot of commonalities, and the rebels of Oriflamme almost
remind me of the outlaw bands like the Regulators.

Actually, I don\'t think this comparison is quite accurate. Haiti simply
doesn\'t apply as we have a case of a military dictatorship sacking a
country to line their own pockets. Rwanda is engaged in a civil war
brought about by conflicting ideals. The Luhtalan\'s, rather than getting
aggresive in their differences, seem to revel in them. I\'d argue that
Canadians are more representative of Luhtalans than anyone else :).
Bizzare thing is, everyone in my gaming group wants to be Luhtalan :).

I\'m using a lot of Buddhist theory in developing the citizens of Fija.
That\'s what happens when you spend too much time in the Religion
department :). Actually, their world view seems to me to derive a lot of
it\'s ideals from Buddhism, so it just seemed a natural progression.

The Schalli, I modelled after the Dinka, a west African Tribe. As for
First Nations. It\'s not supremacist, it\'s a statement of fact. The native
North Americans were the First Nations here. In Canada, most people refer
to \'Indians\' (a loaded term, really. Indians live in India) as either
First Natios (They\'re from the First Nations, they\'re First Nations) or
(much less often) aboriginals. Indian is almost never used (at least where
I am), and when it is, it\'s usually used derisively.

Actutally, yes, the current thread regarding Copyrights, while
interesting and important have little to do with Traveller.  All
we should do is as GDW their opinion on it, when they give us an
answer accept it.  The TML and XTML are not the places for those
discussions (about copyright laws in general) and the flames that
proceed from them.  Secondly the comparison of violence between
different locations on Terra (circa 1994) have little to do with
Traveller and are best carried out in the approprate NetNews groups.
(as is the copyright stuff).

I dont want to seem like a wet noodle or a censor, but the reason
that we have a mailing list is to discuss Traveller stuff and not
other things.  There exist other aveneus to have these threads of
conversation.


Now if you disucss the gun laws on Mora/Mora as compaired to Ruie/
Regina, then thats a differnt story....  :-)

Children are being designed today.  The use of Sperm Banks, where the 
prospective mother can chose the father based on criteria is the 
beginning of this.  Also with our current genetic tampering, you can 
look for this soon (assuming they answer the moral questions first).

Genetic Engineering is listed as a TL-14 activity, but it could 
appear as early as TL-9 (based on our TL-8 toying with the stuff).  
Of course differnent worlds expand differing technologies at 
different rates, so you could easily find a TL-10 world where the 
medical was a TL-16.  However they would be very protective of that 
technology, or else it would be frowned upon by the outside world, or 
it would get propogated very quickly.

You are getting into a real Cyberpunk society.  I read a shortstory 
once about a place where there was no Real World.  From the time a 
baby was born (cloned by machines), it was hooked to the net and 
lived its existance in the net, only hearing rumors of the outside.  
Terra is reaching this ability for some things now.  I think you 
would either need matter transportation (delivery physical goods, 
such as food to yourself) or very good robotics to make this happen.
Probably would be feisable at TL-12 with robotics.

Trin Lives.

That is the first thing that hit\'s you as you come out of jump, and hear
the enormous amount of radio traffic that all busy ports have.  Freighters
and scouts, yachts and warships, all of the typical retinue of a major
port is here.

Only as you near the white orb of Trin - with it\'s thin, sky blue belt - can
you spot the carnage.  Several large impact craters which dot the northern
hemisphere.  Black scar marks, which pepper hundred\'s of square kilometers
of the Von Herrio Glacers.  Above all, the orbiting hulk of dead cities,
once home to 800 million people, now fly in a twisted, ghastly dance over the
fair world of Trin. 

Docking at New Sorrom Highport, the visitor is accosted with rules and
regulations.  While necessary in the Quarrentine Zone, the rigour and
harshness of the Navy seem more apparent here than anywhere else. 

The actual starport itself is ample for any need or service.  The
inhabitants of high ports are famous for living a world apart from the
folks dirtside, and the 80 million inhabitants of New Sorrom is no
different.  The famous Trin friendliness, patriotism and love of travel
still flurishes here, but is slowly giving way to the Trin Survival
Movements.
The local Naval base, home of the 207th fleet, is known as the last one
to see a major action against piracy, in 1159.

Non-Trin starships can land only at Sorrom Down.  It is a must to apply
for a permit before going dirtside, as _any_ unauthorized craft will be
blown out of the sky.  Without warning.  Fortunately, the Authorization
procedure is quite simple: merely a battery of tests to insure that your
ship and equuipment is Virus-free.  Moreover, they will install a
"Slaver", that will insure that your ship will be dock under the control
of Sorrow Down, not the pilot.

At Sorrow Down, the local government will board your craft as soon as you
dock.  Before the HEPlaR is cooled, armed Investigators will be onboard, 
combing every electonic gadget, computer, wrist comp, and every piece of
every lot of cargo onboard.  
 
If any non-Trin ship is caught carrying Infected merchandise, the ship is
seized: only Noble influence can get it back.  If they are caught SMUGGLING
merchandise (Infected or not), the entire crew is shot, on the spot.  The
penalties are less harsh for Trin citizens: simply a massive fine and
"personality reshaping", respectively.

O.K., so you pass inspection. It will still prove impossible to sell
electonic
merchandise to anyone but another trader.  Even harmless goods from
anyplace but Trin\'s neighbour, Hazel (Trin\'s Veil 3236: C645747-5) will be
viewed with suspicion.  Three billion died because of a batch of Infected
scribble tablets, after all. 

About the only thing on your side is that you can defend your cargo and
person from any Survivalist attack: There are no weaponry laws.  None.  
You probably won\'t need to draw your weapon, though: the days of the Night
Hits, when Survivalists and the Union of Merchants & Traders would attack
each
other with fusion rifles have been dead for 20 years.  Just make a good
acquantiance with the Union, and pay your dues, and the Union will look
after your ship and cargo.

If you are a member of the Regency Navy or the Quarrentine Service, it
would be wise to leave your uniforms in your cabins.  The Trin blame those
groups, especially the Quarentine Service, for the Rape of Trin.  While
physical violence is not out of the question, the Trin - especially the
old-timers - are more likely to spit on your shoes or make obsence remarks.  

About the only place where foreginer\'s are welcomed is at Leormen\'s Point, an
undersea settlement of 25 million refugees of the Aslan Incursion.  The
locals, Akimen and Glistenites, remain favourably disposed to traders
since their religion insists on hospitality to strangers from the stars.  
Even here, though, don\'t expect anyone to ask to borrow your handicomp. 

Trin culture tends to revolve around the themes of Survival and
Rebuilding.  The young, especially, are considered the responsibility and
the future of the entire community.  They tend to be spoiled shamelessly,
and have a rather high view of themselves.  Trin art also emphasises the
theme of rebuilding from the ruins, and many refugees of the Wilds admit
to a attraction to the entransing LightDances and mournful, graceful
Thinsong of modern Trin art. Indeed, the upper classes all strive to
patronize the best of Trin art, as prestige is measured in the number of
notable artistic works you can own.    

Even though the Trin are vehmenently anti-foreigner, they still have a
soft spot for nobility, and retain a strong sentimental attachment to the
Regency government, especially to Norris and his heirs.  And unlike many
Infected worlds, Trin have retained their technology, using it to create
the best anti-Viral programs in the sector rather than retreat into a
anti-technological never-neverland.

Still, these are but candles in the dark, and as long as Trin focuses on
nursing their wounds, they cannot truly give local trade and subsector
government the leadership needed for the New Era.

 Without all the "Cyberpunk" baggage, this is a sparse area of SF. There
have been a few short stories in Analog over the years about the effects
of such technology on humanity, but they don\'t address your question.
 A few published works come to mind, however, as well as a few things not
yet published beyond magazines:

   _Eon_, by Greg Bear, and its sequel _Eternity_, briefly depict a
   culture with a lot of computing power at the mental \'fingertips\'.
   This culture also uses \'biosculpting\'.

   _Marooned_in_Realtime_, by Vernor Vinge, also shows occasional glimpses
   of implanted computers\' impact on humanity.

   the Confederacy series by L. Neil Smith, particularly near its end,
   has such technology. (As an aside, Smith\'s aliens make this series
   a must for Trav players, IMHO)

   "Starmind", by Spider & Jeanne Robinson, has _just_ finished being
   serialized in Analog (four parts in August thru November 1994 issues).
   It features, among other things, AI-level PDAs. I expect this to
   appear in book form before too long, as it is the third installment
   in the Stardance cycle, for which the Robinsons have collected many
   awards.

   _Aristoi_, by one of the Cyberpunk authors whose name I can\'t remember,
   does a lot with implanted computers, nanotech, and FTL.

   _Denner\'s_Wreck_, by Lawrence Watt-Evans, also has implanted computers
   and external PDAs.


 Also, Alvin rises to Jim Kelleher\'s baiting, and asks:

> (...and James M. Kelleher, just _how_ strange is Kundert\'s group?)

 Ah, notoriety!

 I should perhaps point out that Mr. Kelleher started the campaign.
I only recently took over the running of things. The campaign has
had its share of low comedy, high comedy, and in-jokes from day one.

 The players are, aside from age disparity, fairly typical of mature
RPG groups.  What Jim is talking about is the collection of characters.

 Oh, you want details?

  Due to a marvelously serendipitous double-20 (one from the engineer,
the other from the Astrogator) while rolling to enter jump, the PCs
ship has visited a non-space which collects "misjumps" from everywhere,
including other SF universes.  They managed to return to the Marches
with "samples" (106 of them, still walking, talking, and in some cases,
shooting) and have since adopted several as PCs. Because Otherspace
was a violent place, most of the refugees are fairly martial types from
fairly martial universes.  The ship now numbers (from WH40K) a Space
Marine, an Eldar Howling Banshee, and a Squat among its crew. Keep in
mind that this crew had a Racoonid and a little-green-man-from-Mars
BEFORE this misjump, and you can see where things are going. Explaining
law levels to the Marine (a Grey Knight Terminator, for those of you
who sling the lingo) was particularly amusing.

 Past highlights include keeping a psioni-phobic passenger from knowing
that we had an ex-patriot Zhodani as our security chief, while (at the
same time) trying to teach the Zhodani enough to blend into the
Imperium; having our chief engineer (the little green man) go nuts over
the antics of an Artifact-wearing racoonid who tended to make doors
in whatever bulkhead he needed to go through; and having the rest of us
go nuts over the antics of the Chief Engineer (bowling balls and karo
syrup... don\'t ask for details).

 That strange enough for you?

checked the planet\'s rating and they allow guns here."  With
that they approached the security post.

"I\'m  sorry,  but you will have to leave your  guns  at  the
locker,"  the  security guard barked in his  usual  monotone
voice.

"But,  the  law level," replied the traveler in a tired  and
dazed look, "OK, what\'s the problem this time?"

Tired of the same old, not related to this news group,  guns
discussion?   I  am,  although I will admit  it  started  me
thinking  about  it in a Traveler sort of way.   The  issue,
when  you  look at it, broke down into culture.   And  isn\'t
that  one  of the more interesting aspects of the  universe,
jumping  into  different  worlds with  completely  different
cultures  and morals than you expect.  Where "common  sense"
might just get you into trouble.  So I\'ve come up with a few
mind teasing reasons why the guards won\'t let you bring your
weapons into a world that allows weapons in the first place.

Reason  #1:  Import/Export:   You  can  purchase  and  carry
firearms  on  this world, but because of a general  paranoia
about foreign competition you can not bring your own weapons
from  the starport because they fear you will sell them  and
make  a  profit.  Thus you have to go deep into the city  to
the local gun store and buy your firearms at highly inflated
prices.

Reason  #2: Technology:  You can purchase and carry firearms
on  this  world, but not just any primitive  firearm.   This
high level tech world requires all its firearms to adhere to
strict   government  standards,  including  their   patented
devices  that alert the authorities whenever the  weapon  is
fired,  (oh  and  tampering  with  the  device  is  strictly
forbidden) giving the guns location and ID.

Reason  #3:  Primitive Technology:  Sometimes  in  a  modern
society,  carrying  swords is deemed  "inappropriate"  while
carrying  automatic  pistols is OK.   Extended  a  few  tech
levels, this might create a society where laser weapons  are
OK,  but  slug weapons are considered to "primitive"  to  be
seen and used in public.

Well,  as a famous fictional person once said, "Three  times
pays for all."  I\'m sure you can come up with better ways to
confuse, restrict, and give otherwise grief to your players.

Of  course  that doesn\'t say anything about attitudes,  just
because the law allows guns doesn\'t mean the law enforcement
agencies like them, or the religious groups, and so forth.

So... here\'s the scoop:

Seems to have a pretty decent organization, full index in back, and preview
in the front pages. The sections of the book include:

Survey:
 the pieces and parts of a survey and what\'s needed to accomplish it. Some
details on what sensors do what (not much more than was already chatted 
about on TML) and difficulties and such for tasks in surveying. 

Colonial Economics:
 A full economic model on colonies and working from a Pocket point of view.
It looks real sharp on a skim, but I\'m not a real good judge. Quite a bit
of detail: agriculture, industrial production, materials, power, armed 
forces, maint...
 This segment also includes a section on playing colonies on a month by
month scale of time.

Mass Combat:
 I really skimmed this, but I\'d be willing to bet that it\'s going to be 
somewhat of a preview for Striker II...

Two Adventures:
 Bootstrap and Colony

Stars & Planets
 Ah, the pieces I was really waiting for. They kept on some info from DGP\'s
World Builder\'s - stuff on atmospheric composition, temperature and effects,
density and gravity. Looks like some good detail and tables.

Design Sequence:
 Black Powder Weapons, Wagons, Bow Weapon design, black powder cannon design.

Equipment:
 Various small blackpowder weapons, and Three new starships: Tukera Freighter
(3000 tons), Hercules-class Bulk Carrier (5000 tons), and a Frontier
Transport
(2000 tons).

I\'m sure other\'s will have more details shortly!

I totally agree with Jeff Franzmann in this topic. 

High SciFi
----
Hi Alvin, have you read Greg Bear\'s novels? Like Eon and Eternity? That\'s
the kind of SciFi I have dreamed about for a long time. Sorry, can\'t provide
TLs. Besides I had that kind of thing in mind when I asked about cyberspace.
If you make up something about that kind of society, let me know.

RC
--
Actually I think the whole RC is like EU. Lots of diversity. And political
balancing to do if administrators of the RC wants to succeed (or suck eggs).

Aubani are typical hero PCs found in every major FRPG. People from Oriflamme
are typical \'bad guys\' or \'bad cops\', still not necessarily your enemies. 
Others are much more interesting. 

Recovery
----
I have also noticed that GDW has put much emphacy to post-holocaust recovery.
It is true that it can give you many good adventure possibilities, maybe even
greater number than stable society. It also gives you an excuse to use 
violence and bear arms (sorry about the last one).

Cities
----
You know, one thing that have allways amazed me in sci-fi rpgs is that about
all the cities are just like cities today. Maybe they are a bit bigger, but
I don\'t know any product that have put something *new* to cities. Something
that is not possible now. And I don\'t think grav cars are that something new.
Okay, there are (or were) grav cities, but I suppose they still looked like
"normal" cities except that they were on the sky.
BTW don\'t get offended, I also use modern cities as a model in my games.

AO

Have any of you made explorations to Alpha Crucis? I think that would be
quite natural direction (at least) from Aubaine.

Ah, memories.. my first PC adventure was set in the ref\'s own place of work
(a
chemical plant). He hated his job. He got a set of floorplans from the Admin
office, and we cheerfully blew crap out of the place. He loved it and so did
we.
(We tried to sneak in and plant bombs, but then somebody shot a nosey
security
guard with a silenced snub pistol, only to realize that it was loaded with
HEAP.. "Phut..............KABOOM!!" We laughed for hours at his face.). The
point is, the ref\'s familiarity with the play area made the surroundings come
alive. I\'ve since used the same technique and it works wonders.


>> Has anyone else noticed that all of GDW\'s current run of role-
playing games is centered around societal recovery after a
holocaust? <<

Yes. _Yes._ YES! 

I object violently. I don\'t object _to_ Dark Future, or Post War gaming. But
I
object to having "our" system, Traveller, the domain of classic sci-fi and
military fiction, the realm of "the silver ships" (see Foundation etc)
hijacked
into the same mould. If I wanted to play after-the-war, I\'d _play_ Twilight.
I
can. I\'ve got it. But now, with all the "real" Traveller withdrawn, we can\'t
play anything _else_. Oh, sure, TNE is more generic - but where can you buy
background for non-NE settings ? 

This is my hobby horse you\'ve stuck ginger into -  sorry. But I prefer to set
dangerous adventures against a stable background. It enhances the sensation
of
horror or fear. If everything\'s coming to bits, it\'s "ho hum, another world
falling to ruin". If Ripley had retruned to Earth and said "the aliens are
coming" and they\'d responded "oh yeah, one was in here for a newspaper last
Tuesday", there wouldn\'t have been the frisson of horror that nobody believed
a
word she was saying.

I feel that betrayed by the loss of "real" Traveller that I\'ve started
playing
AD&D again (as well, OK). It\'s amusing to note that the 2nd edition of that
(whatever your personal prefernces) is compatible with the first. You try
operating under MegaTraveller and using equipment and scenarios from TNE. It
doesn\'t work. I\'m sorry, it _is_ a different game. 

Whoo, went a bit off the rails there. It\'s ok, doctor,  I feel better now. I
think I might get shouted at though...

by Jerry Pournelle.  Not to mention a lot of classic cyberpunk...

"Sight of Proteus", Charles Sheffield.  See also "Ophiuchi Hotline", John
Varley.  Also Asimov\'s Spacer culture was like this -- see mention below.
 This is a dangerous practice in the long run, as your "designers" may well
toss out genes that seem undesirable to them, but that Evolution put in for a
very good reason.

TL 13+?

The "Star Wars" universe as depicted by George Lucas and detailed in Mayfair
Games\' rulebooks.  The robotics/AI tech level in "Star Wars" is extremely
high -- almost eveything is handled by special purpose AIs.  The highly
specialized AI in your X-Wing talks to the more generalized supervisory AI in
your R2 droid, for example... Space Travel is at least 30,000 years old in
the Star Wars galaxy, and is a cheap, commonplace technology -- like the
internal combustion engine is now, only it is as old to the Star Wars galaxy
as the wheel is to us... Laser weaponry ("blasters") is so ancient and
accepted a technology that animal-riding barbarians who think a starship\'s
power core is a magical artifact use home-built blasters as a matter of
course... In "Star Wars", hi-tech is everyday, dusty, battered, rust-flecked
equipment that is considered just... equipment, or tools -- not the chromed,
white-painted and spotless "gee-whiz neato keeno" hi-tech stuff you see in
Star Trek or Buck Rogers, or Battlestar Galactica...

The big breakthru is unlimited cheap energy from fusion (or any other source)
at TL9.  The 3rd Imperium SHOULD look like this, as the Vilani introduced the
underlying technologies 10,000 years ago.

Earth in Larry Niven\'s Known Space stories.  See the "Gil the ARM" stories,
the "Beowulf Shaeffer" stories, and others.  Overcrowded Earth government
(the U.N.) permits only one child per person -- and you can be denied a
reproductive license if your genes are undesirable.  People with highly
desired genes, like geniuses, are issued reproductive licenses for unlimited
reproduction.  Later, the Birthright Lotteries were introduced, where a
limited number of reproductive licenses were issued based on random draw.
 This eventually turned out to be a puppeteer scheme to breed a "lucky" human
being -- read "Ringworld" and "Ringworld Engineers".

This is possible as soon as you have reliable birth control (around TL6), or
at TL0 with retroactive birth control.  It is an attitude, (totalitarian),
not a technology.

>     Most live in perfectly controlled enviroments: many perfer to live in a
>Virtual enviroment, and can live out their lives with only a few forays
>into The Real World (tm).

This is recurring theme in scifi -- I vaguely remember a short story in one
of the "Best of Analog" collections  about a society where you lived in a
"cocoon" in a sealed city all your life -- you worked via remote-link, food
and health services were delivered automatically, robots or remote-control
drones did all the physical work and maintenance, etc.  The city is
eventually cut off from the rest of the world when the glaciers of the next
Ice Age roll over it, and no one in the city notices... except the guy who
maintains the weather station outside.

Asimov\'s "Caves of Steel" stories depict people who live in sealed cities and
are pathologically afraid to venture outside.  Also, some of his robot
stories depict societies where everythings is cheap and humans have every
whim served by robots, with only a few forays into the Real World.  These
societies are also dying out...

In one of Alan Dean Foster\'s books ("Prism"), the hero was from a planet
where everyone wore life-support suits all the time, that took care of all

From: 556N@delphi.com (Dave Reed)

*   On GDW:
*
*   I cannot resist asking y\'all (yes, that\'s proper English in
*   Texas):
*
*   Has anyone else noticed that all of GDW\'s current run of
*   role- playing games is centered around societal recovery
*   after a holocaust?
*
*   I did:  1) Cadillacs and Dinosaurs
*           2) Twilight:  2000
*           3) Merc:  2000
*           4) Dark Conspiracy
*           5) Traveller:  The New Era
*
*   If I didn\'t miss any, they\'re all post-catastrophe...
*   Interesting.
*
*   Mr.  Wiseman, oh ye grand Prophet of Doom, why, praytell, is
*   this?  I\'ve admired you\'re handiwork in Twilight:  2000 for
*   years.  I enjoyed the first edition, and each one after...
*   But why ALL of GDW\'s games?

    Having watched all these games come out, I think that GDW has
    20-20 hindsight rather than any prophetic ability.  GDW has a
    problem with not enough staff to develop games speedily, and
    tend to come out "a day late and a dollar short" when they
    develop games to cash in on a trend.  First, _Twilight:2000_
    -- looks like they tried to do a mellower version of FGU\'s
    _Aftermath_ and cash in on the "survivalist" fad of the early
    80s.  They missed the boat.

    Second, _Cadillacs_and_Dinosaurs_ -- this is the "Lookee, we
    got a licensed property!"  one.  I think it was originally
    brought out to catch the "role-playing games based on faddish
    alternative comicbooks" trend.  The _Judge_Dredd_ rpg (by
    whoever) and Palladium\'s _TMNT_ rpg are other examples of
    this trend.  They would\'ve missed the boat on this one, but
    they had the 1st edition in a drawer somewhere when "Jurassic
    Park" came out, so they rushed out a 2nd edition printing.
    (Note that until Jurassic Park, C&D was as dead as 2300AD or
    Space:1889.  And, anybody seen any new supplements for it?)

    Third, _Merc:2000_ -- this was an attempt to update and
    modify the background of _Twilight:2000_ for potential buyers
    who found the World War III scenario increasingly implausible
    given current world events.  I personally find T2k MORE
    plausible now than before the collapse of the Soviet Union,
    but you know what opinions are like.

    Fourth, _Dark_Conspiracy_ -- someone finally noted that "Dark
    Future" games were popular, and that Chaosium was coining
    money with _Call_of_Cthulhu_ and attempted to kill two birds
    with one stone.  Not only did they miss the boat with this
    one, but they combined the worst features of the two genres,
    not the best (IMHO).

    Fifth, TNE -- another stab at a "Dark Future" rpg.  They
    missed the boat with Hard Times MegaT, and missed the 2nd
    boat with TNE; i.e., by the time they got it out, "Dark
    Future" games were long gone from the scene.  They\'ve been
    replaced by fantasy, space opera, and out-and-out horror --
    all escapist themes.

    Here\'s the clue -- people read books and play RPGs to enjoy
    themselves.  When times are good, gritty, "dark future",
    "film noir" stuff is moderately popular.  When the economy
    goes in the dumpster, and people are shooting each other
    outside your apartment door, the LAST thing you want to play
    is a game that looks like Real Life.  You want to "escape"
    your grim Real World -- hence the popularity of escapist
    themes.  It happened in the Great Depression -- that\'s when
    Science Fiction, Horror and Fantasy took off as literary
    genres; all three made a big comeback during the
    recession-plagued 70s, and all three are popular game themes
    now.

    I predicted (just ask Steve or the couple that runs our local
    game store), back when the 1990 recession started to bite
    hard, and again when Clinton was elected, that the "Dark
    Future" genre was dead on its feet and would soon fade from
    popularity.  Look around; the successful games are Fantasy
    (AD&D, GURPS etc, Shadowrun, Earthdawn), Horror (Vampire et
    al., Call of Cthulhu, lots of new games), or space
    opera/optimistic scifi (Star Wars RPG, GURPS etc).  Somebody
    ought to kick Avalon Hill and tell them them to push
    RuneQuest, as it should do well now.  And TSR didn\'t sue GDW
    over _Dangerous_Journeys_ because they thought it would fade
    with a whimper and take GDW down with it (like some here
    thought).

    Miscellaneous notes:  I do not like to play T2K because the
    Real World looks too much like it (Sarajevo, anyone?).  GDW\'s
    best work, IMHO, has been in games that weren\'t trying to
    follow a trend:  Classic Traveller, Space:1889, 2300AD.  A
    pity none of those games or backgrounds are supported
    anymore...  I still think the TNE ruleset married to the
    Classic Traveller background would have made a heckuva game.

 This was part of a message I received via private email recently, 
 in connection with the Deneb RICE Paper.

 The idea proposed seems reasonable, but for one thing:  It is 
 information that would not apply to all planets.

 It is partly because not all worlds need the same information that 
 the free-form area of a RICE Paper is included.  It is also partly 
 because some information cannot be reduced to a fixed format,  
 Lastly, it is because narratives are more interesting to read 
 than tables of dry facts.

 Let me emphasize to all submitters:  If you think that a 
 "formulaic" datastream should be included in the Basic Planetary 
 Data, add it yourself - just skip a line after the "standard" 
 data, add your stream (such as the religious specification, or a 
 Classic Traveller Universal Ship Profile for that multi-generation 
 ship that set off during the Vilani Imperium, and has just been 
 rediscovered, or...), with a short explanation (as long as you 
 feel it needs to be), then skip another line, and do the 
 narrative.  RICE Papers are flexible; they have to be - G-d 
 (or the Big Bang, or whatever creative force you choose to believe 
 in) breaks the mold after each one.

Sounds like a cry for the Earth Colonies campaign!  It\'s a generic
sci-fi role-playing campaign that\'s easily adaptable to Traveller.
It\'s centered on Earth, has an "optimistic", role-playing based
orientation and is supported by the newsletter *Melbourne Times*.

How on earth are the lowest classes going to stay that way if they\'re highly 
intelligent? I think a lot of your ideas remind me of \'Brave New World\'
by Aldous Huxley (sp?).  In a society where everyone is perfect, who digs
the ditches? (or does other undesirable tasks.) BNW wasn\'t very \'high tech\',
as it was written before computers, sooo... using very crude technology,
could be as low as TL 8 or 9. It becomes much easier as medical tech
advances.

I would have recommended the same thing. Darn. This rings of \'Brave New
World\'
again - total state control of the biological aspects of life. One thing
Cynthia said that I think applies to all of these biological points is that
it\'s more attitude than technology. Reproductive control by the state and
selective breeding for \'bioengineered bodies\' has been possible for decades.
Whether anyone would want to do it is a completely different question.

(I have, of course, selectively deleted items that I have no comment on, but)
Geez, more and more line BNW... which didn\'t leave a very plesant impression
of the ideas with me. Of course, I don\'t think it was intended to. You can do
this now if you want to. Just expect to have more walls at lower tech levels.

With the original request being:

I\'d say that it sounds like totalitarianism with more toys. Maybe it\'s
personal
bias, but most of the advances you describe wouldn\'t (IMHO) make life any
more
pleasant, just a lot more complicated.

*YES!*

Wouldn\'t it be nice to be able to pick up a solid black rulebook with a red
line on it which had the heft of the TNE rulebook?

ObTND:  Doom & Gloom aside, does anybody have any news on GDW\'s rumored
opening up of the Regency?  All I\'ve heard is ocassional rumors, and I
haven\'t been on the resurected list long enough to know if anybody here has
talked about it.

I have only read thru the current years worth of TML\'s so if I am covering 
old ground with same old ideas you will let me know.;-)

On missiles from my reading here, on Genie and in the TNE materials, is that 
space is too vast for a contact missile to have a chance of locating let 
alone hitting a moving space vehicle. That is why they have the nuc pump 
laser warhead.

Point 1. If a missile is too dumb, to track a target over vast ranges, to 
hit a moving target, how can a missile carry the needed electronics to 
track, align and fire its warhead at moving target. If a nucpumper (nuclear 
detonation pumped laser) has 100 rod array that it carrys, it will have to 
track the target, bring the array to an extremely accurate bearing, I will 
let you math types figure this one. Example 100 rods need to be aligned to 
what degree of accuracy to hit a 100 meter long by 10 meter diameter target 
traveling at 3 g\'s acceleration at a range of 30,000 km. If a nucpumper 
fires its array like a shotgun it\'s chance of hitting that target is 
nonexistant under the above conditions. If nucpumper can perform the above 
fire control problem with a degree of accuracy to provide one to six hit, 
then it can close to target to employ a nuclear warhead(nucboomer) of a 
contact or area effect.

Point 2. If a missile can not carry the needed fuel to bring itself into 
nucboomer range then it chance of having the required fuel for nucpumpers is 
minimal except at extremely short ranges. All missiles do not have to use 
constant drive power to reach the target.

Point 3. If target of a missile has a point defense good enought to kill a 
single missile attack then will will have to saturate the defenses. Example 
try and get a single missile to hit a Aegis equipted warship at full battle 
stations, equipted with war shots, and no class type casreps. Agreed that is 
bad example for the missile, but if your target is fully ready for your 
attack a single missile has little chance of success.

We have the technology today to develope the systems to have a nucboomer a 
vaible weapon system.

Possible solutions have a bay mounted missile system with the capability of 
over 100 missiles that can be launced at one, ie like VLS systems.

My background is former US Navy Surface Missile Fire Controlman Second 
Class, dealing with surface missile systems, anti air gun systems, anti air 
missile systems and fire control systems for the weapons.

On missiles in TNE, from reading and disccussions on TML, Genie and 
elswhere, nuclear explosion pumped lasers(nucpumpers) are used because they 
are the only feasable ones. Maybe not

Point 1. A nuclear contact or area effect warhead (nucboomer) can not carry 
the needed electronics to track a moving target at vast distances but a 
nucpumper can. Lets examine this alittle closer, a nucpumper has to track a 
target, close to firing range 30,000km, deploy its rod array, align the 
array along the needed target bearing, and then detonate. If a nucpumper has 
100 hundred rods contained within, it have to bring it bear with a extreme 
degree of accuracy. Example the target is 100 meters long 10 meters wide 
moving at 3 g\'s acceleration to align 100 rods to have 1 to 6 hits, keep in 
mind that the missile is also moving. I will let the more math minded work 
on this one. If a nucpumper has the ability to perfrom this task with all 
the needed accessories (rods, alignement equipment, and deploying equipment) 
then a nucboomer can accomplish its mission very well and carry a larger 
warhead or more electronics because it does have the "accessories".

Point 2. If a nucpumper can carry the needed fuel to reach the firing point 
the nucboomer can use its extra space to carry more fuel to reach detonation 
range. Missiles do not have to constantly accelerate to reach firing point.

Point 3. A single missile in TNE has little chance of damaging a fully ready 
target, this is entirly realistic. Example could a lone Exocet have much of 
chance of hitting a Aegis equipted warship at full battle stations, full war 
loadout and no system casreps? No it would not. You would have to roll back 
and or saturate its defenses. Solution a bay mounted missile system capable 
of lauching 100 missiles per round like a VLS.

My background is former USS Navy Surface Missile Fire Control Technician 
Second Class, with direct experience with surface missile systems, anti air 
gun systems, anti air missiles systems, and the fire control electronics for 
same.

In recent discussions one person has mentioned they were not
familiar with past editions of Traveller.

Out of curiosity, could those on this list who
"came on board" with the New Era and are not familiar
with previous editions (i.e. the Imperium and Rebellion)
email me (and/or cc this list)?

I\'d be interested in knowing how many new players are
on the list. (I suspect GDW would also)

I\'ll post a tally in a few days to a week.

Just to add to Joe Heck\'s first look at WTH:

The planetary detail shows the incorporation of GDW\'s experience
with 2300.  Additions from the Megatraveller/Traveller materials
will be familiar to 2300 AD fans.

The only new design sequence is black powder weapons.  Still no
watercraft.

The colonial economic rules seem pretty detailed.  It\'ll be
interesting to apply them to developed worlds and see at what
point they break down.

The three ships were first published in _The Traveller Adventure_
(I understand GDW still has copys of this for just $10.
Get it.  A little dated, but still perhaps the finest Traveller
product published):
the 3000 ton Tukera freighter,
the 5000 ton Hercules-class freighter, operated by Tukera and
         its subsector-level subsidiaries, ususaaly named in an
         anagram of Tukera (the companies, that is.  The ships
         are named for things that evoke "big")
the 2000 ton Imperiallines transport (not the courier)

Hi folks:

A) I FORGOT to bring my new hydroponic rles!  AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!
   
However, I\'ll bring them in tomorrow (even though I Should Really Be
Studying!)   These \'tentative\' rules cover a bit on what to expect with
food synthesis at the varoius tech levels, size/weight/price, and \'mobile\'
units.
 
B) My little ole\' fighter.

This design is based on the cover of \'Fighting ships of the Shattered
Imperium\' (yes, I _did_ buy this book based on it\'s cover.  Bad mistake!)

Shatte Interceptor   (Variant A/B)             Tech Level A.

This is a non-jump system interceptor, designed for anti-pirate operations.

Varient A,B is meant as a team: 3 A\'s with a heavier B, which has an
active sensor array.  Weaponry is two standard turrents with
reloaders and cradles for one volley of five missiles * 2. 
(Making for 30 missiles total).  Sublight is via fusion drive.

Ethan Henry made a comment that many of my ideas for the truly high-tech
society is simply "Totalitarianism with more toys".

In a number of instances, I\'ll agree.  So, Ethan, how can the common
High-teck citizen fight back against this State with all these goodies
(not to mention other nifty things a la nanotech spy-eyes)

And DON\'T be discouraged... the computer revolution has given Government
much more data on everything, but it has ALSO given your average-joe
citizen more access to everything, too (a la the Internet, for example..)

(Just ask the Soviet Union.)

Probably the most interesting variations involve making this technology
intergrated (via biotech) into pepole.  I.E. instead of great massive
clone banks, make every woman capable of designing her own child. (Please,
Someone, the IMPLICATIONS of this!)

Or, from another angle, explore the \'diversification\' of the human race
into cybernetic, airborne, origional, long-life, etc. branches. (A la the
Humanx Commenwealth)

I have always been intergued with the \'genetically perfect rulers\' of
Margret Weiss\' novels.  Especially, regardless of genetic tinkering, you
can\'t \'filter out\' greed, envy, love, compassion, etc  (Though you CAN
make them more difficult, or more stranger, I feel)

Cynthia spoke of a galaxy (far, far away...) where barbarian tribes can
make home-made blasters.  THAT\'s what I expect from a seriously high-tech
people. (analogous with Amazon tribesmen with camcorders)

Well, you have heard my hackneyed ideas of the Seriously High-Tech
Society.  What about YOURS?

Subject: Re: TML Nightly - NOT!

On the subject of free trader style trade, it seems to me that free
traders might wind up being more market driven, and be "chartered" a
lot.  "I\'ll pay you 350 kCr to take this load of 3 tons of Lark\'s
Vomit to Efate (a 12 Parsec trip)".  This is the sort of silliness
megacorporations are allways trying to avoid and makes for better
adventure possibilities.  It also better represents the "fallen
between the cracks" sort of commerce you would see.  

Actually, who knows what small carriers do on this planet?  My guess
is lots of that sort of thing, and trips to places where they are the
main source of imports.

Anybody know anone in this sort of buisness?

A little help on Zhodani culture, please?  (suddenly, I can hear an

Aaahhhh... Good question. The reason I called it \'totalitarianism\' was
because genetic engineering removes a lot of a person\'s (or should I say
citizen\'s, perhaps even comrade\'s) ability to chose his/her destiny -
eg. someone bred for construction work doesn\'t have a lot of choice in what
they\'re going to do for a living.  Then again, calling this sort of
situation where people are bred for specific purposes \'totalitarianism\'
is quite biased - perhaps the society in question sees it as being
beneficial.

Mostly I think that someone raised in such a society wouldn\'t want to
fight back against the State and when no one wants to fight against the
state, things go bad.

Um, hm. Whole generations of children that look like soap-opera stars from
10-15 years back? It would be like the swings in availability of trained
people in the real world - there\'s a shortage of welders, so they train more
welders, so in 5 years, there\'s a surplus of welders. If women could design
their
own children, there might be lots of athletes one year, lots of artists the
next,
etc. Also, if the process didn\'t go 100% as planned, there might be a lot
of resentment - a child who was supposed to be an athlete decides she wants
to
pursue a writing career. One very disappointed mother. There\'s lots of
possibilites.

Quite so.  Of course, the original Classic Traveller, like the original D&D, had
almost no built-in background at all (except perhaps that the designer had read 
one too many Dumarest of Terra books...) The whole magnificent edifice "just 
growed" from product to product until it became a big part of the product.

Personally, I was no great fan of the Imperial background (although I stole from
it in large chuncks for my own campaigns) so seeing the reset button pressed on 
it is no great distress.  It would be nice to see something in the game market 
to suggest that the entire future is not uniformly bleak; it starts to wear on 
the nerves after a while.

Side note on the C word.  Check "From the Management" in JTAS 13 (Hivers).

A friend and I discussed this scenario a couple of years ago and came 
up with this:
Ms. Smith goes down to GeneGenie to choose her baby, she decides on a 
boy, 6\'2" tall with Barbie&Ken(TM) blue eyes. Now, what if a large 
fraction of the population specify the same \'brand-name\' modification 
? This will of course be thoroughly tested and \'completely bug free\' 
(now where have I heard that one?). However if an abnormally large 
fraction of the population have this gene then the chance of the gene 
being duplicated rises - this is (I think) similar to the result of 
inbreeding, leading to malformation, low IQ etc. The previous 
argument about lowered genetic diversity giving less disease 
resistance etc. also holds.

I\'m not a biologist so there could be a few mistakes in this ;-)

    'body' => 'Hello.

Yesterday I\'ve played (refereed) TNE the first time and I would like
to tell you my impressions and ask some question which raised in play.
Thanks in advance to all who read this and more thanks to them who
answer the questions :-)

Although not really convinced of the Reformation Coalition background
I selected it as campaign background after talking with my players.
Most of them were impressed of the idea of an fallen empire, the
restart of a new core empire, the ad-hoc adventure ideas of traders
and explorers who re-discover lost knowledge and goods and they fully
accepted the virus as part of the setting. So we started in the
Reformation Coalition (RC).

Character creation was long and (not surprising) the most time boring
but it went faster than I originally thought.  We\'ve the following
players:

A very wealthy traveller (although is career is only allowed for
Regency I though that also in RC there\'re old emprial noble families
that haven\'t the old power and influence but money (what is nearly the
same ;-)) with a PhD in Economics from Aubaine.

A Hiver Technical Academy graduate (passed with distinction), who also
graduated at Fleet Academy, serviced in the Aubaine Navy and finally
became independent Trader; also from Aubaine.

A Fleet Academy graduate Scout who changed to the belter occupation
having to big strikes and earned MCr 1.5! He\'s from Spencer (?? The
world that was recently occupied by Oriflamme) but feels now more at
home \'between the stars\'.

A bounty hunter, former army man, graduate of military academy from
Oriflamme. He rolled up extraordinary attributes (none is less than
8).

An ex-special ops marines, servicing 5 terms at the Army of Oriflamme.
He had no luck and is still O1 he received because of graduating the
Oriflamme Military Academy. Perhaps it\'s because he\'s from Baldur.

* Some questions to character generation (maybe I\'ve only not found the
informations in the rules/PoT book):

 Does changing occupations really gives the full first-term
 skill pack every time?

 Why the belter gets tons of credits _and_ a free starship?
 I think that\'s unfair against the other careers.

 Are there any DMs for Special duties?

 Does Aubaine has the only Hiver Tech Acc?  Does Oriflamme has
 the only Military Acc? (Surely not, but it\'s probably the
 best)

* Comments:

 The next time I will not allow to roll for attributes but let
 the players allocate 36 (perhaps upto 40) points.  I don\'t
 like super heros (see below)

 A made the mistake and allowed the players (their characters
 of course) with low CHR to make a beauty operation that gave
 them +2 for 10.000 Cr or +4 for 30.000 Cr. Are there any rules
 for such a case? What\'s about other attributes?

The players managed it to get two starships with a little bit luck and
tons of ship DMs.  They now own a fabric-new scout and a good kept far
trader.  They also own about 2.3 MCr cash (mostly the belter-scout and
the Noble).

They decided to found a trading company and will probably give the
build order for a third ship.  That gave my campaign a slightly
different direction :-) I persuaded the party that big money can only
be found outside the RC and sugested the Unity of Promise as a far
target because that\'s a group of TL 15 world that could be very
interesting and very wealthy.  However, I didn\'t mentioned the rumour
jet, that the Unity may be a outpost of vampire ships.

In my Traveller universe, H-jump are a little bit faster, lasting
about 80 hours. So they reached Aurora after about 2 weeks starting
from Aubaine.  Selling 27t goods, making 81.000 Cr profit (buy:
27x3000 Cr, sell: 27x(5000x120%) Cr) 

* Questions that raised:

 Can a starship jump into empty space, provided that it has
 enough fuel aboard? (Otherwise the Aubaine->Aurora journey
 wouldn\'t possible with a J-2 ship, I think)

 What is the tank size of an Scout, a Far trader and what
 is the fuel consumption of these ships?  I haven\'t found
 any informations about this in the rules book.

 Making money seems to be quite easy.  I\'ve calculated that a
 far trader costs about 50.000 Cr per month inclusive fuel and
 pay for the crew.  Jumping between Aurora and Aubaine would
 let the players become fastly rich.

But the party isn\'t interested in boring business of shipping goods
between two worlds so they accepted a job to bring a journalist called
Anne Bradly to Keipes, helping to recover an old imperial grav tank
she has the knowledge of and taking it back to Auction of Aurora.  (An
idea I got while looking at the cover of Challenge 74 :-)

Has anybody some ideas of Keipes more than the informations of PoT?  I
think it\'s a very interesting world. It has a B starport, but it tries
not the trade with the RC.  Probably the Guild will gave them the
needed goods.  It\'s a (relative) high-pop world with a big and good
equipped army.  I think, the RC informations aren\'t very exact and
Keipes tries the become a pocket empire. There\'re two very interesting
world \'behind\' (from there RC view) Keipes (I don\'t remember the
names) and Keipes at least own two jump-capable ships.

I still need more informations about Aurora, a world that probably
become permanent base of my party.

* Question:

 Is a B starport able to construct starships or at least system
 boats?  How long would it last to upgrade starports?

 How many starships would the RC own (are inside the RC) at
 1201 or at 1205?  What\'s the grow-rate of this number?

 How many independent star ships might operate behind the RC AO
 border?

* Comments:

I understand the RC as an still growing both economically and military
group of worlds.  It\'s a economic miracle phase.  After a kick off now
the rebuild speed is growing (racing). All RC people profit from this,
they\'re all fine (?? They\'re not wealthy but think develop quite good
for them.) There\'s no hunger, suppression or bad feeling from
history. They\'re all looking forward to a even better future.

Aubaine is the centre, it\'s the most developed world an in the capital
you didn\'t noticed any more anything from past.  In maybe 2 or 3
years, Aubaine will have population problems and a wave of immigrants
will want to get their part of prosperity.

Oriflamme on the opposite aren\'t the bad guys as - I\'ve just read -
someone sayed, but a very needed part in the RC group of worlds.  They
are the RC army and the now his.  They\'re not very lucky because of
this job but there is no discussion that the will do this job as best
as the can.  Distrust is more likely the paranoid of the others.  (Of
course it can be very dangerous to grow a scorpion at ones breast (or
that like the saying goes))

* Rule questions:

I\'ve not found any stats for bows or crossbows.  One player would like
to use a crossbow. He already learned the early firearms skill.

What means Law Level 6: All firearms except firearms prohibited???

Comment to Law Level in general: I can\'t see why law level is only
related to Fire arms? What\'s about punishment of `usual\' common
crimes? Is the justice liberal, conservative, repressive, corrupt are
more important questions.

Either I don\'t understand the combat/damage system or isn\'t extremly
unsatisfactory! 

Let\'s say you\'ve a unarmed damage value of 2. Does this mean 2D6 or
merdly 2 points? But if D6 are ment, does the special ops man (UDV 6)
make 6D6 damage? Strange!

What\'s the damage of melee weapons?  A dagger as damage 1, a sword 2.
Again the question, D6?  But what means 1+(STR) (with parentheses) and
1+STR (without parentheses)?

I have to ask this because I can\'t believe it.  Is a hit capacity of
48 to the cest normal? ((STR+CON)x3 for STR=10 and CON=8, okay he\'s an
animal, but...) If a normal pistol makes a merde 1D6 damage, he can\'t
be killed.  He can catch MG-salves without problems! With a bulletprof
vest he can\'t be harmed by pistols at all (1 point blunt damage), and
automatic gun (penetration 1-nil) only make 1D6 damage at near range.
Let\'s assume the damage of 1D6 is 4, another 3 for blunt damage is
about 7 hits per shot.  That means 6 shots before he start\'s to feel
hurt and another 7 shots before he\'s critical wounded. (The rule that
players can\'t be killed is \'realy bad\' btw and will be ignored by me)

And also John Average with (6+6)x3 = 36 hit points is immune against
swords. I have to hit him 18 times until he\'s heavy wounded?! A plate
mail (to stay in the same TL) is btw the perfect protection because NO
HIT EVER will go through the armor (or will an outstanding success
do?)

What\'s the price and tonnage (displacement tons) for a mining
equipment.  Let\'s say we need a bulldozer, an excavator, someting to
drill holes and sensors to measure the surrounding.

Why the starships have no informations about fuel capacity (in tonnes,
why is there always the change between m3 and t) and the needed amount
for one jump-1?

Enough,
bye.

Yes.  Switching carrers is a good way to Min-Max a character.  Most of the
players in my game had a one carrer switch.  The one player who is our
biggest min-maxer switched carrers 5 times.

> Why the belter gets tons of credits _and_ a free starship?

They don\'t get it automatically.  Remember, its a difficult check against
Geology, and they loose a -1 to SOC each term.  Kinda balances things a
little. (Not much mind you, but some :-) )

> Are there any DMs for Special duties?

Unless they are listed, no.

> Can a starship jump into empty space, provided that it has

Yes, in fact, the 400T subsidized merchant was designed to be J2 with the
use of extra fuel.  The J-Drive was a jump 1, but with extra fuel, they
could make successive J-1\'s.

>What means Law Level 6: All firearms except firearms prohibited???

Should read:  All fireamrs exept Shotguns....  I belive.

It is related to other things.  It is the value on 2D6 that must be thrown
to avoid legal problems.  It also uses firearms as the primary description
for how repressive the goverment is.  If you notice, at higher Law Levels,
they say things like there is no personal privacy, etc.

   The fuel requirements for HEPlaR make it non-viable if you plan to visit
the main world (assuming it\'s not in orbit about a gas giant itself).
You\'ll use up the fuel getting their anyways, and it may take long enough
that doing an in-system jump would be faster.  It\'s usually only viable if
you are just passing through.

Good AfterNOON, Ladies and GENtlemen...

I fooled around with my less-than-complete understanding of hydroponics,
and I came up with the following skeleton of rules - subject to the
approval of the 500-sophont TML board, of course...

A) Life Support on starships are presumed to last indefinitely,
assumming regular maintance.  

If _no_ repairs are made for one year (a unlikely occurance, unless the
crew met an unfortunate fate), the ship\'s life support starts to break down. 
Breakdowns escalate in severity until about 6 minths later, when life
support collapses.

Emergency life support is built to last, and will work unattended for five
years (quite a number of ships in the Wild have used Emergency Life
Support for 70+ years). 

However, it is minimal - no food except these protein tablets, the
air stinks, you shower in a bag, waste is dumped outside of the ship, etc.
After five years with no repair, the air actually becomes noxious, the
water is unfit to drink, etc.  The ship becomes uninhabitable as
one-half of the ship start to heat up to oven levels (ie. the sun side,
and the engine room), and the other half becomes colder than Outer Siberia
(the dark side, or when the power plant is off-line).

Each Life support unit is designed to support double the total amount of
expected crew and passengers.  If the number on board is triple the
regular complement, cut the time to breakdown/increase the life support
cost accordingly.  

B) The hydroponics below is meant to last indefinitely (Especially for
space stations + asteroid homes...).  Food, water, air - but not heat - is
provided here.  Units are "needed to support one man"; if you want to
support 10 men, multiply the numbers by 10.  

Divide the numbers in half for a unit with one year duration for one man.  
Or let three men use each unit, for one year.

Tech level     volume(kl)   mass(mt)  MW      MCr
    9             1,000       100    .1        .5
   10               700        70    .07       .35

   15               100        10    .01       .05

C) \'Man-portable\' Life Support Units are actually synthesisers
designed to provide food, air, water, waste recycling for one month.  They
use refill cartriges, at 1/10 kilo. mass and price of the main unit.  AT TL
17, the unit can be borne in a backpack style, rather than requiring an
anti-grav lifter or whelled carriage of some sort (NOT included in price).

Tech level       volume(kl)  mass(mt)  MW      MCr

   17               .05          .03   .00015   .005

D) Estimates on what \'Extended life support\' REALLY means

So.... has anyone played through the Smash&Grab adventures for TNE? I 
decided to give it a go, and it\'s been really hellish. Mostly, it was
mis-estimation from my part - but it doesn\'t really brief out to
referee\'s HOW much firepower and goodies the players should have.

They died a horrible death last night. It was really sad to see them 
mowed down by Assault Rifle fire in the prison complex. I\'m going to give
it another round (and they\'re still interested), so anyone have some
suggestions?

The big question is the power of the laser weapon, since the range, 
according to the original post, is very short. Sure, the rain will 
scatter some of the laser light but a simple way to see if the beam will 
reach its target is to see if you yourself can see the target. If you can 
see what you are aiming at, the laser will follow the same optical path. 
Just remeber that the laser has way, way more power in its beam than the 
light you see. Even though rain will scatter some of the light, if the 
beam is powerful enough the scattering loss will be relatively small and 
the beam will still reach its target, doing substantial damage.

There are several wavelengths the laser may operate to which water is 
transparent and flesh isn\'t. A blue laser, at say 488 nm, would be a good 
choice. It pass right through water, but be absorbed by hemoglobin in the 
blood. Enough power, and the heating of hemoglobin will boil blood 
(ouch!). As a matter of fact, this type of technique is currently being 
explored for medical applications (i.e. zapping tumors, etc.).

 Indeed. The two self-proclaimed Zhodani experts that I know of on this
list don\'t much agree with each other.

>Would Zhodani Consulate systems be as diverse as Regency cultures?  Or
>would all that psiconics and mind-reading tend to fore all
>to conform into a single mold?

 First, the short answer: No. Zhodani worlds are not as culturally
diverse as those in the Regency.

 The "psionics and mind-reading" have little to do with it. The fact is
that the Zhodani were a homogenous race and society LONG before they
discovered Jump Drive. There has been no parallel to the Imperium\'s
Long Night within the borders of the Consulate, either (not in the last
6000 years, anyway). These two factors result in a fairly homogenous
Consulate, border-to-border.
 That said, each world\'s people have changed to fit their environment.
On worlds where the environment is a daily (or hourly, or constant)
concern, you will find an entirely different set of cultural habits
than on the Zhdant-like worlds. Similarly, you will find some differences
based on common occupations (an Agricultural world will be a bit different
than a "Rich" world).

 How pronounced these differences are will depend on one decision that
you must make for your RICE papers: are the Thought Police locally
recruited and trained, or is there a single Tavrchedl\' Academy per
Province? The former will lead to somewhat more pronounced differences,
while the latter will lead to a higher degree of conformity to the
Zhodani "norm." I tend toward the first choice, myself.

 Based on the CT Zhodani Module, there are differences in government
types. As I read it, the Consulate as a whole is the Democratic
Meritocracy described as typical of the Zhodani. Each world sets up
government (over the Proles) according to the whims of its nobility
and the realities of environment, population, and economics.
 Much to _some_ people\'s annoyance, this means that you have to look at
the numbers of the UWP and figure out how the world got to that point.

   Ah...the E.E. "Doc" Smith approach.  He called it the "Space Axe".  It was
used by Space Marines from Heavy Grav worlds.  Pick a battle axe or
cutlass from the melee weapons table and then use the materials table
in FF&S to extrapolate the weight if made out of a denser material.
The material should be at least as dense as what you are trying to
crack open.
  From a rules point of view, aimed shots (at one difficultly level
higher) would be more valuable.  This would indicate that the strike
is aimed toward a joint or other weak point (such as the face shield).
In a Vacumn or CBW enviroment, just breeching the suit would 
be enough to take out the opponent.

>So I\'d like to start a discussion thread on how technology from the

  Ok. This thread has popped up several times.  It must have *some* merit.
One of the CT reasons for melee weapons was shipboard defense and boarding.
Slug weapons gave you that nasty recoil to deal with.  Very bad in Z-G.
(You\'re in Z-G because your engines were hit and you have low power.  If 
your engines worked, you wouldn\'t stick around to be boarded, whould you?)
Even low/no recoil weapons like lasers do damage to the interior when you 
miss.  The inside of a ship isn\'t armored like the outside.  Besides, if your
foe is wearing an armored vacc suit, it will take too long for that laser to
cut through.  That titanium headed space axe though will cut through the
soft joints "like butta".  It will crack the face shield quite well also.
Just make sure that you are well braced when you swing.

>One idea was mount a HEAP round on a crowwbow bolt. Not strictly melee, but 
>very quiet until it hits.
  Not that far fetched.  I\'ve seen anti-armor hand grenades with fins.  They
were put on to make sure that the end with the shaped charge hit the tank.
I\'d see this as more of a low tech method to use higher tech relics.  The 
natives have access to several cases of 2cm HEAP grenades, but no grenade
launchers.  They do make crossbows though.  Modify a couple to shoot 
heavier bolts (counter weighted to make up for the HEAP charge at the tip)
and suffer a loss in range.

Question #1 is: how much of this file has been "officially blessed"?
Has GDW announced any additional corrections? (Statements like "nearly

Question #2 is: how much of the old "Library Data A-M/N-Z" has been

   Yes.  You could use the continuation roles (p 42), or arbitrarily limit

Just the DM to the chance for getting Special Adventure, detailed on page

I don\'t know if this has been firmly established - all I\'ve read of is that
the _first_ Hiver Tech Academy was established on Aubaine.

   I think you were overestimating the effects of physical appearance on
the charisma stat. It\'s more a measure of personality and presence.  FF&S
has some rules on artificial enhancements (using surgery or drugs) at the
end of the cybernetics section.

Yes.

   The total fuel (jump + reaction drive) is listed under the Notes section
where it states how long it takes the fuel purifier to purify the whole
tank.  Reaction drive fuel use, in kL per per g-hour, is the ship\'s
displacement in tons multiplied by 0.125.  Jump requires (n+1)*d/20 for a
maximum jump (n= max jump, d= ship displacement in tons).  Divide this by
the max jump number to get the per parsec fuel use.  (However, I prefer the
5%+5% rule: 5% of the displacement to enter jump, plus 5% per parsec
travelled).

<The recent mention in S&A of the long-range Solomani explorations into
the Perseus Galactic Arm got me to thinking about where some real
interstellar structures should be in the Traveller universe.>

   Someone a while back put out a map showing where "Known Space" is
located in relation to the actual Milky Way Galaxy.  If your players get
inflated egos about how much distance they\'ve travelled (I have player in
a campaign now who\'s playing a remnant who has literally travelled from
Terra to Regina and back again during the course of several campaigns),
it would be a good idea to show it to them.  Most measurements are in
kpc (kiloparsecs--1000 parsecs equals a kiloparsec).  Known Space is just
a glorified postage stamp in the grand scheme of things....


<In WBH, they say that supergiants should be rare.  They are!  I have only

  Sardas    (0839 Mendan)       F0 Ib  M7 D
  ??????    (1530 Empty Qtr.)   M4 Ia  M4 D
Rare enough?  This is in the whole region of the Imperial Atlas!
Of course, whether these stars are real or which they are is another question
altogether....>

   I\'ll try to find out the answer to that question for you.  BTW, I can
guarantee those DM companions are either not there (most likely) or are
something else.

<For owners of "Solomani Rim": what subsector of Alpha Crucis was named
"Denebola"?  Any help with this would be appreciated!>

   Denebola is subsector \'I\' of Alpha Crucis.  Denebola (the star) is located
in
hex 0128 of the sector according to my calculations, BTW.

   FYI, with special thanks again to Wade Allen of the Dayton Museum
of Natural History, the correct location of Aldebaran is (drum roll please):

                          0401 Aldebaran (in the Euxene subsector)

This is based on the two following criteria: 1) that Aldebaran is/will be 
approximately 10 parsecs from Capella  2) that Aldebaran is/will be 65-70
parsecs from Sol.

  I was rummaging FFS today, and took it into my head to assume,
  for argument\'s sake, that all of the stardrive technologies 
  listed in FFS were possible, and commenced an economic analysis 
  and comparison among them.  The standard configuration I intended 
  to use was a J3 TL12 100 rate hull.

  When I went to work with the Stutterwarp setup, I couldn\'t get 
  sensible figures: The fuel usage was too low, and the performance 
  was too high (the minimum TL12 fusion plant I could put in gave a 
  stutterwarp performance of 9+ parsec/day [can you say J66 
  equivalent?]).  Worse, the size of the SW/powerplant combo was, 
  by the figures and description, independent of the hull rate.  I 
  don\'t see this as sensible, and feel that there must be a bug in 
  this.  Also, there were no figures on how far a SW system could 
  tunnel before discharge was necessary.

  Can someone _please_ rationalize this info for me?

  For odd and inexplicable reasons, I was going through FFS today,
  and started thinking about weapons systems that I had remembered 
  from previous Traveller experience.  I then started, for equally 
  odd and inexplicable reasons, to consider the peaceful civilian 
  applications of military technology.

  Two weapons I remembered were the Jump Damper and the Jump 
  Inducer.  All I know of them was that the JD could prevent a ship 
  from escaping into jump, and the JI could force a ship into jump, 
  which jump was guaranteed to be a misjump.  Now, what I need to 
  know is:

  Were these "official" weapons, or did they come from my GM\'s 
  fertile imagination?  If the former, can someone provide me with 
  tech specs on them?  A controllable JI/JD combination, depending 
  on how they really work, might have the potential to serve as a 
  "jump gate" method of interstellar travel, and might prove more 
  economical on high-density routes than conventional jump ships.  
  Even if they\'re not, working out the FFS specs to prove it might 
  be educational.

I just got WTH ( World Tamer\'s Handbook ) and on the first couple of runs

guidelines for Campaigns of any focus High level Leaders of a Colony effort
to the First - In - Scouts (Tm.) ( Andre Norton I belive... :-)) it also 
indicates the idea of using the T:TNE rules with other earas and places.
Such as the first colonies at Alpha Centari... Pretty Radical :-).
It also had design sequences as add - ons for FF&S for Black Powder and Bows
( I liked the quote at the begining. ) Now I think I might try to design the 
Wheel Lock horse pistols I saw at the Austrian Exibit Here In S.F. They where
Beautiful...
Hummm I\'ve got a character who is a collector of Guns...
I also have one who collects bows and had a compound made for him and his 
battle dress when he was in the Commandos. I can even design that Monster.
I really like it.
Something came up in our game... The ship we have is an Ex Corsair ( Yes EX!
)
( We took it away from the "People" who had it last. )
Any Way the problem came up when our more merchantile character asked "Well 
How much can I get for the Booze in the hold" it seems that the merchant 
system was designed with either one type of ship or one area of campain.
Since we are in the spinward and 1122 at that the fall is yet to come and 
the payments on our ship would not be made under this system. Oh My I just
figured out why all of these ships get used as pirates... :-)
Ok Well Mr. Kundert said that he would look into synthising something out of 
CT and T:TNE has anyone out there had similar problems and how did you solve
it?
Thanks in advance.

Our campsin style both of us... Mr. Kundert and I is pretty much passive.
We both prefer to let the players\' Characters find trouble on their own.
This saves a lot of set up work; BUT, you have to be able to shuck and jive 
in a hurry and at a moments notice. This seems to work well for this group as
they are very interested in Character devlopement. ( One adventure I had set
up for them [ would have explained a lot and even might have revieled an 
enamey... ] They took one look at and said Thanks but no Thanks!!! ) Oh 
Well what can you do, Save that Sceane for later only I\'ll let them stumble
into it this time...
Our players like to do a lot of the play during Jump but this last session
was spent on the upstation. furinstance
Gunnar gave the Captian, Marcus two tickets to the Symphony as Marcus hadn\'t
been off ship for some time and he spent the last day dealing with the port
athurities while a number of the others got out and went to the concert.
He also bought Marcus Clothes sutable to the occasion, as He wasn\'t about to 
let his Captain go to the symphony in his tired, old, ratty ;-) scout suit...
He thought Marcus would invite one of the ladies on board to go with him but
Marcus came up with a date; We where suprised. :-)
One of the other things that happened was Blasnie (how DOES he spell it Jim?)
took our engineering robot DB to a Cyber Shrink ( He had been VERY depressed
lately... ) But Blasnie had forgotten Just one little detail... How to Pay 
for this, A very embarassing call from Madam Zola\'s ( Yes She does Massage,
Tea Leaves and Palmistry on the side, Not too much call for Cyber Shrinks.)
Astrid was not amused by Blasnie\'s ( I am trying to spell it consistanly )
running off to spend ship\'s funds with out telling her. then a couple of
minutes later Blasnie calles her back and wants to buy a pet.
This was very ammusing to listen as the players Played with this...
Blasnie got the idea that DB needed a pet. Fair assumption as some of his 
programming seemes to have been hiver. Astrid pointed out that DB will find
a "pet" on the crew.
It seems that every one on this crew has a tweak, something to hide, or all
of the above...
Makes for interesting play and sometimes a laugh a minute.
Madam Zola was Jim\'s fault, honest she was... ;-)
We have played through two months ( about ) ship time and we have had one 
fire fight Three shots fired, Three assailants down. Gunnar wasn\'t going to 
shoot his, but the idiot drew on him... Sigh Oh Well here it is...
other ammusing moments ( for Me any way ) was when the Weird Gray Knight 
walked up to Astrid and said " I\'ve just done an inventorie and we do not
have 
any orbit to ground assult ordence."
Astrid "Well yess..."
"We should have some."
Then came a group effort to explain that we are a merchant ship NOT a
warship.
He also has problems with the idea of not going fully armored and armed every
where. He seems to have come from a most grim place.
The dynamics of this particular group and characters are very interesting.

 Soon after GDW\'s Alien Module 4 was released, we started a campaign
 in Zhodani space, and the campaign is still going on. (we recently
 switched to TNE game system, and had to re-design most of our ships
 and equipment with FFS) During this campaign, our characters have been
 involved in two Frontier Wars, and presently we are exploring the
 Core.
 At the beginning it was quite difficult to play Zhodani characters
 because the basic society was so strange. The Zhodani space was also
 quite peaceful place, and did not give much adventuring possibilities.
 However, the situation changed when our unit was transferred to
 Spinward Marches for anti-piracy (search-and-destroy) operations.

> Would Zhodani Consulate systems be as diverse as Regency cultures?  Or
> would all that psiconics and mind-reading tend to fore all to conform into
> a single mold?

 I think that Zhodani societies are much more uniform than old
 Imperial societies were. The Referee\'s Companion has a 9-page
 article of Zhodani, and it gives a good insigth to Zhodani society.

Form Megatraveller, Referee\'s Companion, page 65:
----
.. It has been said that psionics has made the Zhodani Consulate the most
powerful, effective, and absolute tyranny in human history - and also the
happiest and most stable. Both statements are quite true.
----

Form Megatraveller, Referee\'s Companion, page 66:
----
Conformity: Zhodani are conformists. The relatively narrow band of activities
which all members of society understand and approve of is known to everyone,
and everyone strives to act within the range. The range of acceptable dress
(while wide) is rarely exceeded. Interests rarely involve strange or
unsuitable subjects. Too much deviation from the norm is considered an
aberration and subject to re-education.
----

 Because Zhodani society is based on non-heraldry, psionic noble
 class, the government system can be considered as \'8: Civil Service
 Bureaucracy\' and \'C: Charismatic Oligarchy\'.
 The Consulate law level is both \'6: Moderate Law (all firearms are
 licensed)\' and \'C: Extreme Law (unrestricted invasion of privacy)\'.
 However, crime is extremely rare in Zhodani society and law level
 may appear to be much lower that it really is. Tavrchedl\' troopers
 can effectively reduce crime by telepahtically searching for unusual
 thought patterns, and picking off any perverts and psychopaths before
 they do any crimes.
 If an Imperial citizen is wearing psionic shield while visiting a
 Zhodani planet, the local tavrchedl\' troopers will consider him to
 be as suspicious as if he was wearing a ski-mask and wielding SMG.

Form Megatraveller, Referee\'s Companion, page 66:
----
Zhodani society also helps direct individuals to the most productive and
satisfying pursuit available. Psionically based techniques help each person
understand his or her needs and motivations and place that person where
ability and aptitude can contribute most to personal well-being and to the
community as a whole
----

 This is propably the reason why my character joined the Zhodani
 psionic Guards, and was eventually promoted to Major.

thanks for your answers.  

However, I still don\'t understand the combat/damage system. Does an
unarmed damage value of 2 means to subtract 2D6 hit points from the
hit capacity or only 2 points.

And what\'s the damage of melee weapons?  A dagger has damage 1, a
sword 2.  Again the question, D6?  But what means 1+(STR) (with
parentheses) and 1+STR (without parentheses)?

If a normal pistol has 1D6 damage, does that mean I need to hit a
STR=10, CON=6 character (hit capacity 48) about 13 times to wound
him??

Anyone out there know what is a \'liquid round\'?  I don\'t think that this
is modeled in FF&S: how would you fit it in?  What kind of damage it would
cause?

In 2300AD GDW\'s StutterWarp discharge limit was 7.7LY or ABOUT two Parsecs. 
GDW used a 3D star map of the stars within 25LY of Earth, which produced
three
long arms (French, American, Chinese) to adventure on from Earth.  I recall
FFS
mentioned this fact somewhere in the FTL section but it wasn\'t a hard rule. 
GM\'s were encouraged to fiddle with the rule to get the kind of campaign they
wanted.

I recall that an American Kennedy class Frigate, which was THE fastest
stutterwarp warship, had an stutterwarp engine efficiency of 17.05 (2300AD
New
Military Tech, which might translate to Traveler TL 13), a 300MW Fusion plant
(I think) and a performance of about 4.1 LY/day.   While I own both 2300AD (a
complete set of all the material) and FFS I haven\'t tried to reproduce any of
the stutterwarp ships using FFS.  The 2300AD rules based performance on mass
and FFS uses displacement tonnes (I think).

Either GDW made another BIG error or your calculations were wrong.  

Regards,

Kevin Mc Carthy
(who likes the 2300AD universe better--real ALIEN aliens, no flat universe,
and
hard SF)

Hi All, 

I just checked out the many useful files on the ghost archive.
It\'s a great resource; I had no idea there was so much original
material (not on the other sites as far as I could tell).

I just wondered...

Is there a site that supported TDR (Traveller Done Right)? I\'d like to 
read through the archives but I couldn\'t find them.



TIA

Glenn

I can\'t imagine they\'d be horribly upset. Anyway, I\'m the one running

Not to my knowledge - there were some beginnings of the group, but it
fairly died when the traveller PBEM transfered control to Mike and Mark -
they were the primary instigators of TDR to my knowledge.

Subject: Movement rates of animals

Organization: Dept. of Informatics, University of Oslo, Norway
Keywords: Animals
 
 
My original request for movement rates got me >lots< of stuff on humans and
horses (thank you), and also a few comments on oxen, but nothing on the
various other animals. So here\'s what I found in the library:
 
 
        MOVEMENT RATES OF VARIOUS ANIMALS
 
I dug this up in the library. The numbers are probably inaccurate, since it is 
hard to clock a wild animal (they don\'t always want to cooperate). The figures 
are in kilometers per hour.
 
MAMMALS
 
Moose ("Elg")           56      short distances only
Reindeer                51      short distances only
Deer                    40-67   average-max
Horse                   60      short distances
Cheetah                 96-100  short distances only
Wolf                    6-10    normal rate
                        55-65   short distances
Dog                     69      max
Hare                    outruns a wolf
Fox                     42      average max
Seal                    35-65   average-max
Killer Whale            64      short distances
Blue Whale              37      10-15 minutes
Antilope                50-67, up to ~80
 
BIRDS
 
Geese                   40-120  migratory speed
Ducks                   60-113  migratory speed
Eagle                   45-190  average-dive
Falcon                  40-300  average-dive
Diverse waders          50-70   migratory speed
Seagull                 ~50     average
Pigeons                 50-90   migratory speed
Pigeon, carrier         90-95   average
Owl                     65-70   pressed
Raven/crow              ~50     migratory speed
Swallow                 45-60   migratory speed
Diverse small birds     30-50   migratory speed
 
FISH
 
Blue shark              69      max
Salmon                  13      average
                        43      max
Trout                   9       average
Mackerel                11-33   average-max
Sturgeon                70-104(?)       average-max
Swordfish               64      max
Sailfish                110     max
 
 
Hope this is of some use to somebody. It would be interesting to have some
figures on the movement rates of various insects, arachnids, reptiles, and
amphibians as well.

Hi, beeen lurking for awhile. And in the process of setting up a 
new game I ran across a couple of things I need to figure out.
 
 One: Traffic density, i.e. precollapse trafic. The scope of the game
is to include the recovery of crashed ships, and the refurbishment there
of. Also the building up of a new starport to construct new hulls. 

 Two: How much time it takes to build a new ship? I am doing a kitbash
of classic Trav and MT, and a liberal dose of my own. It breaks down as
A week per 10 ton chunk of base hull (i.e. ten weeks for the base hull 
of a 100 ton scout.)  A week for controls, a week for life suport.
 Where this breaks down is in the installation of sensors, drives, and 
what not. Note airlocks are considered as part of the base hull.

In other things Mr. Kelleher, Mr. Kundert forget to mention the former
Captain who was commited to a Gaa-Gaa Academy, it seemed the right thing
to do. Or the ship\'s docter who was only a step ahead of his ex-wife and
her goose-steping atourneys. And also had a profound delight of tranking
other crew members with his pocket tranqcan. (this was fun,you should
have seen their faces the first few times)
 There is the tone was set for this campaign on the very first set of
runs we had to deliver some vips, But most of the play was spent in a 
prank war that very quickly got out of hand.

 In other things Jim..Jim, Doc Wang was last seen shiping out on a 
Vargr Trader The SS Unpronoucable headed somewhere into Vargr space.

Casinos, my secret mountain hideout has casinos, who planned this
OOPS, I did.
More latters,

Hi, beeen lurking for awhile. And in the process of setting up a
new game I ran across a couple of things I need to figure out.

 One: Traffic density, i.e. precollapse trafic. The scope of the game
is to include the recovery of crashed ships, and the refurbishment there
of. Also the building up of a new starport to construct new hulls.

 Two: How much time it takes to build a new ship? I am doing a kitbash
of classic Trav and MT, and a liberal dose of my own. It breaks down as
A week per 10 ton chunk of base hull (i.e. ten weeks for the base hull
of a 100 ton scout.)  A week for controls, a week for life suport.
 Where this breaks down is in the installation of sensors, drives, and
what not. Note airlocks are considered as part of the base hull.

In other things Mr. Kelleher, Mr. Kundert forget to mention the former
Captain who was commited to a Gaa-Gaa Academy, it seemed the right thing
to do. Or the ship\'s docter who was only a step ahead of his ex-wife and
her goose-steping atourneys. And also had a profound delight of tranking
other crew members with his pocket tranqcan. (this was fun,you should
have seen their faces the first few times)
 There is the tone was set for this campaign on the very first set of
runs we had to deliver some vips, But most of the play was spent in a
prank war that very quickly got out of hand.

 In other things Jim..Jim, Doc Wang was last seen shiping out on a
Vargr Trader The SS Unpronoucable headed somewhere into Vargr space.

Casinos, my secret mountain hideout has casinos, who planned this
OOPS, I did.

Question:  What set of rules are you going to use?  Can I use TNE to 
generate my Char.?  Any more detail about the PBEM itself (Background, 
kind of adventure, name etc.)  would be helpful in generating char. 
background.   Thanks.

There are no stats for cross/bows, Black powder weapons in Traveller: The 
New Era Rules Book.  Check The Reformation Coalition Equipment Guide 
(order number: 0310), pages 102-103 for the above weapons.  Check Also 
the World Tamers Handbook for black powder weapon design rules and some 
equipment examples (Muskets, Cannons, Wagans, etc..)

Hope I Helped,

Very much interested.  I may buy WTH, but I do not think I will be picking up
BL
anyway, so I would be very interested.  Besides BL ratings, if you could
include
(if provided) prices in MCr, I would also find that interesting.

You have doubtless seen Joe\'s posting. (ccjoe@showme.missouri.edu) I have
also 
been in touch with him about his BR plans, and I hope that we will be able to

cross metaphorical swords in the near future.

    'body' => 'Recently I decided to see if I could construct some of the hover tanks from 
2300AD. My first step was to create their mass driver cannons. I soon came 
across some interesting/puzzling things.
1. The direct range fire formula. It says and I quote here;
"Short direct fire range in meters for a mass driver gun firing a kinetic 
kinetic penetrator round is equal to the sum of the bore diameter (in 
centimeters) and the muzzle velocity (in meters per second) all multiplied by

.015"

To my way of thinking that translates for a 7cm round at 2000m/s
(7 + 2000) * .015
= 30.105
That\'s not a very good range for a projectile travelling at 2000m/s

2. I\'m assuming that you use the warhead design sequence for designing the 
penetrator. If that\'s the case, my mass driver gun from above would have 
13.47kg mass, 26.94Mj energy. Going to the KEAP section of warhead generation

this would give the penetrator a PV of 107.76. Multiply this by the
penetrator 
type (at TL-10 APFSDSCI) and you get a PV of 484.92. A little high?

3. What is everyones best quess as to the TL of 2300AD? I noticed in the 
discussion on Stutterwarp it was 13. Any others?

In  reply to Lenscotts question on Bows they can be found in  the

catalog/  book  and working out the damage from  the  arrows  for
differnt  poundage bows using either FF&S or the infantry  wepons
guide for Twilight, as this enables the calculations to be  done,
as   some  one  who  calculated the  damage  for  a high  powered
compound  bow  ( 180 lb) and found that it did  around  the  same
damage  as a 7.62 NATO round  ( 4d damage with hellish  Pen) ,  i
will conferm there danger to contemptous players, after all  they
give  no flash and are very silent and can be used  for  indirect

There are a large number of these weapons details out in Reformation Coalition

find a copy.

There\'s also design sequences for the same in World Tamer\'s Handbook.

Hi All, 

I would be very interested in a revived TDR list. A lot of the recent 
traffic on the TML would perhaps be better handled under such a list.

The recent thread on table data used in computerized gaming aids
raises an interesting point. Namely, if you are going to have the CPU 
do all the work, why stick with those clunky tables. A computerized 
gaming aid should expand the capabilities of the original not merely
mimic. 


In particular I am interested in the following topics.
(1) revamped world generation (TL, gov, etc.)
(2) Trade systems (Almost everyone seems to use house rules)
(3) Starship combat
(4) Upgradability of Starship components - I\'d like to write up 
    more modular hardware designs (like the socket type turrets,
    but with drives, powerplants and computers.)
(5) Real Aliens (I\'m sick of oxygen breathing humanoids)
    

I\'d be happy to carry on email discussions with anyone who doesn\'t 
feel like posting to TML.


TIA

Glenn

Funny that old article should get posted again right now.  Thanks to 
all for the answers to my old questions!

If you want to get a good look at "real-world" stellar positions and
structures in our galaxy, there\'s a great new book out entitled _The
Guide to the Galaxy_ by Nigel Henbest and Heather Couper, in the non-
fiction science/astronomy section.  Ever wonder how close the Traveller 
maps are to reality?  This book has rough *charts* of parts of our 
galaxy, showing a selection of key objects and structures we have 
estimated ranges on.  The spin orientation is identical to the fake 
Traveller maps.  It is also illustrated with many excellent color 
photographs of objects, and the text helps explain how our 
understanding of the galaxy has developed.

Of particular interest to Traveller players are plates A and C in 
chapter six, which coincidentally show the part of the Orion Spur 
containing the Imperium and a close-up of the Solomani Sphere, 
respectively.  One thing you should check out is the coincidental 
correspondence beteween the fictional border of the 50 parsec radius 
Solomani Sphere and the edge of an actual low-density region in the 
interstellar hydrogen called the "Local Bubble" shown on the chart.  
It makes for a handy scale.

It\'s a very interesting and educational book, and I recommend you 
take a look at it if you have a chance.

You might be able to find the GIF "galaxy.gif" or binhex\'ed PICT 
"galaxy.hqx" at one of the ftp sites.  Otherwise, the book I plugged
above also has a map that gets the point across.  On the map in chapter 
three which shows the galaxy as best we know it, find the tiny red box
labeled "6".  That encloses the entire Imperium!

PETER MCNAE <pmcnae@ozemail.com.au>

Recently I decided to see if I could construct some of the hover tanks from
2300AD. My first step was to create their mass driver cannons. I soon came
across some interesting/puzzling things.
1. The direct range fire formula. It says and I quote here;
"Short direct fire range in meters for a mass driver gun firing a kinetic
kinetic penetrator round is equal to the sum of the bore diameter (in
centimeters) and the muzzle velocity (in meters per second) all multiplied 
by
.015"

To my way of thinking that translates for a 7cm round at 2000m/s
(7 + 2000) * .015
= 30.105
That\'s not a very good range for a projectile travelling at 2000m/s
 ----
Try the following:

Short Range (m) = (1/k)ln(ukt+1)

Where u= muzzle velocity (m/s)
t=0.3 (s)
k=(4dr^2)/MS
d=air density (atm)
r= 1/2 projectile diameter (m)
M= mass of projectile (kg)
S=special KEAP ammo pen mod eg 3 for apfsdsdu.
 ----
2. I\'m assuming that you use the warhead design sequence for designing the
penetrator. If that\'s the case, my mass driver gun from above would have
13.47kg mass, 26.94Mj energy. Going to the KEAP section of warhead 
generation
this would give the penetrator a PV of 107.76. Multiply this by the
penetrator
type (at TL-10 APFSDSCI) and you get a PV of 484.92. A little high?
 ----
No that is right (until I get around to redesigning the KEAP pen formulae)
 ----
3. What is everyones best quess as to the TL of 2300AD? I noticed in the
discussion on Stutterwarp it was 13. Any others?
 ----
The tech doesn\'t match exactly. about TL13  for stutterwarp and plasma guns, 
about TL 10-11 for most other things.
Wait till you try to power the mass drivers in a hovertank!

In  reply to mr Mcnae , My self and Mark Archer worked  out  last
year  that the TL was either high 12 low 13 and settled  on  TL12
if  you  want  the reson it was based on the  interveiw  in  Role
player  indepndent magazine with one of the GDW staff , I  forget
which one.

As for the second point abought the ranges on the mass drivers  i
came  across  that problem and after checking  my  dictionary  to
make  shure  i  was wrong i decided to multiply  round  size   by
muzzle  energy to get the range , it works on the smaller  rounds
but it may hash up on the larger ones, but considering the  power
drain on the larger rounds i decided that they wouldent be  used,
and  there for in MY game didnt matter, ( note in outher  peoples
games  differnt ruleings will be made , this is very  much  there
dicision.)

Hope  these  ramblings have helped, oh and if any one  wants  the
firearms for 2300 for TNE let me know and ill post them up again

2300AD had three levels of technology, this is how *I* believe they relate to
T:TNE:

2300AD                                                           T:TNE/FFS
Old Comercial                                                  TL 11
New Comercial/Old Military                            TL 12
New Military                                                    TL 13

2300AD made a point of saying that the Core (Earth & Alpha Centari) was much
more advanced than the Colonies.  Also, in "Beanstalk" a narative passage
described the TL of a villiage which described a great deal of variation of
Tech Levels present in any colony.  It described a fishing village where
fishermen used electromagneticly enhanced nets and other devices but the
villages still used outhouses.  

The WBH defines a colony\'s tech level as the TL of the capital machinery that
is capable of making other equipment.  Tech levels of the colonies would be
much less than the Core, with variations for length of settlement, colonial
power controlling the colony, etc. but higher TL equipment is avaliable as
imported items from off world.  

I\'d be interested in  seeing your designs of 2300AD vehicles and equipment
using FFS.

correct fix.

Does anyone remember the fix.  I ignored it at first (because I hadn\'t
bought the game yet), but now I\'m making heavy use of FF&S.  Please
post the fixed formula if you know it.

Less work than changing *either* the damage values or the hit capacity:

JUST CHANGE THE KIND OF DICE YOU ROLL FOR DAMAGE.

My GM uses D10s instead of D6s.  I just hope he doesn\'t use them on ME.

   I\'d be very curious to know if you are using *all* the combat rules or
just some of them.  For example, are you using the Quick Kill rule?  One
shot to the head or chest can theoretically instantly kill a character
instantly--not exactly what I would call immunity if you ask me.

i.e. Tom fires his gauss rifle at the enemy PC, Ivan.  He hits Ivan in the
head.  Ivan is not wearing a helmet, so all 4D6 of the gauss rifle\'s damage
is applied.  Because it is a head shot, we check for a quick kill.  Tom first
rolls a 14 for damage, then proceeds to roll a D20.  If Tom rolls a 14 or
less, Ivan is dead. 

   Lesson: I hope Ivan had good life insurance.

   BTW, just what are you doing that is causing your PCs to expend so much
ammunition?

   The easy way out, but I prefer to design weapons that give better damage
results.  Designing "instant-kill" weapons is not that hard, and you can bend
the rules a bit and let your characters run around with shotguns that spit
HEAP buckshot rounds.  Using a 18 x 90 HEAP round gives you something
like 16 or so D6 of damage at close range (close range being the entire
length of some ships).  Even if you use "orthodox" buckshot rounds, they
still do 12D6 damage.

That enough for you?

Let\'s say we want to fly from the mainworld to a near gas giant.

The TNE rules include a table to caculate the time per Ls for G-hours

So we thrust for 12 G-hours*. I don\'t remember the correct values, but
for 5 G-h it was 0.6 h/Ls, so let\'s assume 0.2h/Ls. You need 400 h for 
this journey (about 17 days).  The old rules contain a table for the
same 600.000.000 km journey that says something like 3 days, but with
faster ships, the duration is even lower.

Another interesting point is, that the TNE examples stats that the
mainworld -> gas giant journey lasts 10.000 Ls!

*= Do I need the other 12 G-h to decrease velosity or can I spend
all 24 G-h to calculate a journey time of 200 h (still too long).

Could somebody please explain this rules or confirm that this times
are correct (and I\'ve to change the rules). Thanks.

I\'d be interested in about TNE stats for 2300 AD weapons.

BTW I have only basic 2300 AD set (without map) and I\'d like to get more

To someone in the past:
----
In unarmed combat damage number means total damage (i.e. 1 = 1 point of
damage)
In melee weapons, I think number is number of d6s and + STR means you add
the strenght stat to damage for example 1 + STR = 1d6 + 6 if the character
has
strenght value of 6.

If I recall right, you wanted more lethal damage system. You can convert
cyberpunk damage system to TNE (if you have one) or you can use d10s or even
d12s instead of d6. If you make up something more original, let me know.

For direct fire range,
Use: 5(B+(V/20)+20)
where B is the bore diameter in cm, and V the muzzle velocity in m/s
This gives ranges that are consistent with what CPR guns get.

   It\'s hard to compare the two, since the power plant outputs were quite
different.  I tried stutterwarp out, and it seems to have gotten a speed
boost.

   With a power plant putting out 0.5 MW per displacement ton (what you\'d
install for a 1 g HEPlaR drive), you get a stutterwarp speed of 6.26
parsecs, or 20.4 ly, per day.  You\'d want to play with the figures a bit to
use it in a 2300AD campaign.

I would like to point out one quick fallacy in the "NH3 Purification
Plants" thread so far... there\'s no reason to assume that a high-tech
purification plant is going to use the low-temp shifting equilibrium
NH3 -> 1/2 N2 + 3/2 H2 reaction.  You might as well just use the NH3
as internal fusion chamber wall coolant, hype it up to a few thousand K,
and ionize it entirely.  You now have a N and H plasma.  You don\'t want
the N part of it, so you run the plasma through a small cyclotron
or something to accellerate it, then apply a strong electric field 
at right angles to the flow, which will seperate out the N and H ions.
Easy, Simply, doesn\'t require postheating of the H (feed it right in
to the fusion chamber 8).  If most of the fuel is used as coolant
anyway, as physics indicates it probably will be, then it\'s even
easier, as you don\'t have to seperate H out of most of the plasma.

Their ship is virtually useless after a misjump, and floats into RC
controlled space. The ship is intercepted by the RC and the RC decide
they could use a team of people like my PC\'s for some of there more
\'sensitive\' missions in the wilds. After this I think I will launch
one or two of the \'Smash and Grab\' adventures. I\'ll try to include
things in the missions to make them more personal to the PC\'s, such
as have some people from the PC\'s home planet in the prison as well
in the first scenario. So, my questions:

1)      What do you think of this general idea, any major faults?

2)      How do I brief the PC\'s about the RC? I was thinking about
        setting up a meeting on the RC ship and handing over a number
        of documents explaining the RC (ie. photocopies from the rules).
        What parts of the rules should I give them? Just the intro to
        the RC in the TNE rule book? Any suggestions? How did other GM\'s
        introduce there PC\'s to the RC?

3)      Any quick reviews of the adventures in Smash and Grab, by people

There are some really awful misprints in TNE: just look at the world generation 
rules.  Unless justified by an underlying change in assumptions, as the 
interplanetary travel rules are, I would assume that the old rules are more 
likely to be correct:  I would go the Merchant Prince, rather than MT,
actually.

PS. I misunderstood your concern about the distance to the gas giant being 10
000 Ls - I\'d let it stand, tough, unless you actually generate planetary
systems
and so have the exact distance for any given mainworld to gas giant trip

at Regina, for instance)

The old rules assumed a "thruster" technology which delivered acceleration with 
minimum fuel consumption.  The new rules assume realistic (actually optimistic) 
reaction mass consumption.  The old rules, you burn continuously for all three

Personnaly, I like the new rules:  If they really bug you, redesign your ships 
with thruster plate technology from FF&S (as I undertstand it, that is the old 
rules technology).  Then just use the constant acceleration with turnover
equations from the classic rules.

I take some remedial action such a fiddling with high end world taxes or

I hope it\'s not true. According to Challeneg 74, it\'s supposed to be the

I did a quick review of the 2300AD StarCruiser Naval Architect\'s Manual and FFS
regarding Stuuterwarp Efficiency.  It quickly becomes apparent that the
greatest variation between the 2300AD and FFS is that FFS uses Parsecs and
2300AD uses Lightyears.  

In 2300AD each tactical space combat hex was 600,000km and each turn was 1
minute.  Brillant Lances scale is 30,000km and 30 minutes.  In 2300AD ships
moved at twice their StutterWarp Efficiency in hexes per minute. 

SUGGESTED FFS RULES ERATA:
FFS p. 43: I suggest that a FFS rules fix should be to retain the 2300AD rule
of StutterWarp Efficiency  equals travel distance of LY/day.

The conversions for Brillant Lances movement are as follows, FFS p. 43:
Forty
times (i.e., 2  * 20) warp efficiency per MINUTE.  Multiply this by THIRTY
for
BL time scale in hexes per turn.  If only StutterWarp Ships are involved
divide
each BL turn into TEN 3 minute segments.

I wonder if GDW will publish a 2300AD source book for T:TNE?  Any comments
Loren?

Nick Law writes:
My friends know better now than to mention TCS tax rates in my presence; 
it has been one of my pet obsessions for many years. I was always 
convinced that the budgets in TCS were too high, and that the guidelines 
given in Striker were more realistic (I wonder what Striker II will say 
on the matter). Below are some notes that I wrote on the subject some 
time ago, which I hope will be of interest:

Striker says that the per capita GNP for a world of average tech level 
(B/C) is Cr15,000. It also says that military spending will average 3% of GNP, or Cr450 per person.
The military budget has to be spread between:
1. The Navy
2. The Army
3. Planetary Defence Forces (Striker says jointly run by the Army & Navy)
4. COACC
5. The Marines
6. The Scouts and other government para-military organisations
7. The wet Navy
Once you have taken out the PDF funding, the Navy should be lucky to get a third of the budget: Cr150.
Of the naval budget, at least a third will go on administration, pensions, intelligence, 
communications, R&D and construction and maintenance of naval bases &c, leaving Cr100 to be 
spent on the ships themselves, instead of Cr500 as in TCS.
If, as it says in TCS, maintenance of ships costs one tenth of their price to build, and navies can 
have ten years-worth of build available as initial forces, then it follows that maintenance and 
construction will be equal sums within the budget i.e. Cr50 each per capita, with initial forces of 
Cr500 per capita. I imagine that after every ten years service, a ship is either scrapped, 
mothballed, given to a client state or the reserve service, or else it undergoes a refit of the Star-
Trek-The-Motion-Picture-comes-out-looking-like-a-different-ship-altogether variety, which is pretty 
much the same as building a new vessal.

So far, so good.

Afraid not. The reason why TCS maintenance is so expensive is that it
includes administration, salaries, pensions, communication and ground 
installations. I think you have to allot the full Cr150 to the Navy (R&D 
seems to be non-existent in the Imperium).

TCS does not have any rules for replacement of ships as they wear out. I
forget wether I\'ve seen it somewhere or made it up myself, but I usually
assume that a ship has a useful life of 50 years on the average. That 
means that 2 of the 10%/year maintenance actually goes to replacement
ships. 

Also recall that Striker allows the military budget to rise to 15% in times
of war.

None, except there are only 11 possible numbers with 2d6.  If it
bugs you so much just put leg shot and roll a 50/50 chance for
which leg is hit.

Here\'s some extras:

I can\'t remeber what I said about concussion damage but according

distributed equally over the whole body, for each hit location roll
a d3 this is the number of hits at that location and roll up
specific damage(s).  This takes longer but demonstrates how nasty
explosives can be.

When assessing the chance to break a bone or amputate a limb use
the proportion of hit points for that location to modify the
chance.  For example a PC\'s head has 20 hit points and takes a 1
point wound.  The chance to break a bone is say 80% then the chance
is 80% * 1/20 or 4%.

It sure does.  We have had some pretty interesting and funny things
happen when using the On Target system.  When we started we were
using the TNE damage system and we hated it.  The combats were too
comic book like even with the "Quick Kill" rule which it is not,
the book suggests double damage for PC\'s and death for NPC\'s.  One
character was shot seven times and was only slightly wounded.  We
also didn\'t like the different systems for PC\'s and NPC\'s.  So we
chucked it all out and went with On Target.

Just to interject my opinion into this;

It depends on your conception of how the armed forces of the Imperium
are organised. I happen to believe that the so-called \'colonial\' forces
or any other "Imperial" forces of any sort, are not local forces taken 
under Imperial control. In my view the local
forces are *always* under local control while the colonial forces are
completely seperate & always under Imperial control. Therefore the Imper-
ial \'colonial\' & \'regular\' units of all kinds must be funded apart from
\'local\' forces.

*** ASSUMPTIONS, OMISSIONS, AND DISCUSSION ***

For this analysis, I treated the Third Imperium as if it were, on average, 
TL12.  (In MegaTraveller, "Avg Stellar".)  I think this is a more accurate 
reflection of the Imperium than assuming TL15, since so many HiPop worlds 
are not TL15.  

There are no net imports/exports of rations or raw materials.
SN == 2.5 (arbitrary).  Six-month growing seasons were assumed; no 
modifiers used; half of agricultural production is always idle.
SS == 300 cubic meters (arbitrary). 
SL == Cr 3500 (TL12).

All power is considered to come from TL12 fusion plants.

No excess labor or excess capital was used for any calculation.

Once the population needed to support a TL12 standard of living and the
military were removed from the work force, the remainder were assigned
to heavy industry/construction and supporting resource production.

Transportation infrastructure value was not computed for either civilian 
transport of goods or military supply.  The need for gravitic freighters
and 100000 disp-ton bulk haulers is tremendous.

As an aside, a merchant fleet of 20 million "Common Imperial Transports"
from _Rebellion Sourcebook_ would carry over 200 billion displacement-
tons of cargo, be worth TCr 70000, and using WTH cost TCr 3400 every
year for maintenance and depreciation.  Even scaling this up suggests 
that most transport and production is in-system.  Blaine Tukera and his
brothers could easily have been quadrillionares, before the Rebellion!  
(That\'s million-billionare!)  And then there are the megacorporations 
that are heavily in banking and lending like Hortalez et Cie, which 
could be even more intimidating.

The troops in the military were divided up according to _Path of Tears_,
as if the Imperium were a HiPop world.  The force in the space navy was
doubled to reflect a greater interstellar focus and account for the
IISS and Planetary Navies.  The figures above include *all* Imperial and
local forces in the Imperium.  Military capital was purchased at TL12,
reflecting the majority of local planetary armies; TL15 would increase
all values by x1.5.  No allowance was made for equipment purchases or 
the resource needs; somebody else want to try that?

Naval equipment value can be estimated.  _Rebellion Sourcebook_ agrees
well with the above and suggests the following rough calculations:

   IN + Subsector Reserves == 640 fleets of about 5 squadrons each.
   Assume each squadron is worth almost TCr 1.  Then the aggregate
   force is worth roughly TCr 3000.  They have a total of about 1000
   major ships in each of about 22 sectors, so double this to include 
   the IISS and Planetary Navies, and we get about TCr 6000 total 
   value.  Roughly TCr 300 must be paid yearly on depreciation and 
   repairs, according to _World Tamer\'s Handbook_.  Supply adds more
   costs.
   
Each HiPop world\'s share of the navies would be about TCr 5.  This 
is actually quite close to the figures in _Trillion Credit Squadron_!
This estimate needs more testing.  Supply ships are not included -- they 
are covered in the military infrastructure computation which I didn\'t 
try to do.  Each HiPop world\'s share of the ground force is about 6500 
divisions.

The ag info should be taken with a grain of salt.  I tested the ag
model on the Earth at TL8 to find a carrying capacity at nutrition
of 1.0 assuming all land hexes were of richness 1.0 and could be
100% farmed -- an unrealistically high assumption.  I could only
feed 2.6 billion people with *all* land hexes in farm production.  
(Six-month growing season; no other environmental effects included.)
This has to be off by at least a factor of four, more likely a factor
of ten or more; does anyone know what the current estimates for human 
carrying capacity on Earth are?  Or other relevant information?  This 
appears to be a major bug in the colony econ rules. 

Also, under the rules, using ag products as resources is a losing 
proposition at almost all tech levels, so I didn\'t do it.  TL12 ag 
production also uses more raw materials than TL8 ag production, even
after land and yield are taken into account, which may or may not be 
plausible.  

There should be a provision for a recycling program, though.  In 
1100 years, assuming population is steady and tech level stays at 12, 
the Imperium uses up enough raw materials to fill the entire volume 
of the Moon.  (UWP size-2 world.)  According to WTH, it gets *worse* 
at higher tech levels.  I wonder where all that raw material is going?  

Finally, lets bring TNE into this.  The Regency has a total population
of somewhere around 900 billion to 1 trillion.  So if you divide the
calculations for the Third Imperium by 16, you should have a rough
estimate of the economy of the Regency.

thing I can find is the statement that unstreamlined hulls allow no
skimming and no landing, streamlined hulls allow skimming and landing
on planets with atmospheres no greater than Thin, and airframe hulls
allow any landings.

Some curious results, then, are:

- The Lab Ship wouldn\'t seem to be very useful for first contact
missions, because it\'s unstreamlined and its launch is only
streamlined. What are they going to land on an Earth-like planet with,
the air raft? (Better hope it\'s enclosed.)

- The various pictures in these books of (streamlined) Free Traders
landed on planets (either spaceports or the wilderness) with people
walking around them sans breathers or pressure suits are kind of
strange. Also, (airframe) Fat Traders have a big advantage when ships
of the two types visit Earthlike planets without highports.

It would seem more reasonable to me to say that streamlined ships
could land on any planet provided they have contragrav, while airframe
ships don\'t need contragrav if the atmosphere is at least Thin
(or Standard?).

Comments? Unfortunately, my copies of CT and 2300AD are several
hundred miles away. (I recall 2300AD substantially dealt with
orbit-surface travel.)

If I understand right, your character aren\'t born in the RC and/or
aren\'t citizen of the RC, are they? So from where do they come? Wilds?
Rengency? A Pocket Empire? Deep-frosted from 1130?

I see the RC as a normal government and so the RC don\'t have the right
to recruit the players scout ship. Hovever, the RC will probably want
to know all informations about the non-RC-area the characters have.
If the characters don\'t want to give this informations voluntary, they
could exchange them for a repair allowance of their starship.
Otherwise only a high Admin and Bribe skill will help to get a
shipyard to repair the scout.  Probably all shipyards in the RC are
booked-out for months with construction of new starships.

But if the characters have enough Credits/Money they are free whatever
they like to do.  A smash&grab mission -- or just a `shoot in the
dark\' after carefully studying the old info data archives -- may be a
food start -- but that\'s not an adventure _in_ the Reformation
Coalition.  I think, not only the RC government but also wealthy
individuals may want to give the money for a lucrative adventure.

I think, the players should have the initiative on this.  I think,
that mission-orientend adventures are boring, but that\'s surely a
matter of taste.  I think, the RC don\'t need everybody -- and if they
need more personal, they will first look for people from the RC
perhaps.

I think, it\'s enough, if the players (and their characters) know the
RC as a very large and somewhat powerful pocket empire that has its
restricted area of operation.  The first impression of the characters
will be the star port of their first word, they will archive -- and
this people will be \'the RC\' for them for a long time.

Internal politics, the details of their foreign affairs are thinks,
that are unimportant.  I don\'t think, that showing rules helps to
flesh out the live of the RC citizen.

Do your players know the TNE rules?  Otherwise I wonder what else
rules are RC-specific?  When I started, I told the players about the
RC background -- a group of world, that is recovering after the total
destruction of a giant star empire.  Something far related to the
Foundation triology of Assimov.  All players know after 5 minutes,
what kind of character they would like to play. Then I shortly
explaned the TNE rules -- mainly the character generation and the task
resulution.  After this, we startet to roll up the character, trying
to make something like the prior imagination.  After three long hours,
we started "Ok, you are all at the weekly auction at Aubaine.
Congratulation, you managed to get an old far trader spending all your
saved money (the ship DMs)" After this, I described the live of
Aubaine and the players decided what to do next (become rich in the
Wild was their primary goal, but how?)

Harold D. Hale,
thanks for your replies.

If there\'re obviously a lot of misprints in the TNE books -- even more
than are corrected in the update booklet -- how about collecting them
in this forum.  Not only because my classic Traveller rules are (only)
a translation which could have errors too, it\'s also annoying to
verify all strange informations.

On the travel times: Ok, TNE has another explanations for maneuver
drives what a) makes it a trip of weeks instead of hours to refuel at
a gas giant and b) changes the ship design, because not jump fuel in
important anymore but maveuver fuel (G-hours).  I think, A realy
fast(tm) ship should have about 50 G or more. If I\'m right, a ship
need 12.5 m3 fuel per G per 100t ship displacement.  In classic
traveller, most ship had enough fuel for exactly one jump.  Now, with
the use of maneuver fuel, all ships can make 2 jumps without
refueling, because the 100 diameter distances needs less than 1 G-h.
The scout (if I remember correctly) can even make 3 jumps.  Because a
jump target can also be empty space (as I ask prior) this greatly
improves the operation range of the old ships.

I remember a statement I heared (or read) once, that there\'s a great
rift on the map, that only Jump-6 ships can fly through.  If I know
that there\'s fuel at the other side, I can now make this fight with my
Jump-2 scout, jumping three times. Very odd.

So I think, I like the old system better (and the old (German) rules
book also already contains the ship design rules -- another good point
:-)

On hit capacity: I tought about using the quick kill rules, but after
remembering a very disapoinging RuneQuest (I know it\'s of topic)
adventure where my character died because the master rolled 01
(critical success, twice maximal weapon damage for spears = 22) on
attack and a no armour protecton (the PC had only 15 hit points) I
decided that is roll is too much purly accidentaly.  However, I want,
that a normal 2D6 pistol is still dangerous (and is feared by the
players :-). 

Just changing the damage dice might help but then there\'s still the
problem (as I think) that hit capacity depends too much on CON and STR
-- with a factor of three.  That skills and other stats depends too
much on the attributs is however a general problem with the rules.

As and instant idea, what\'s about using the "Mensch aergere dich
nicht"-rule (I don\'t know the english name of this game): On a 6
reroll and add?

A 18x90 HEAP ammoution is probably not the typical personal combat
thing.  I don\'t know (and don\'t be interested in) the exacted design
procedure but that\'s probably something very big (length of 9 cm?)
with armor piecing capability.  To use bigger guns to reduce the hit
points problems seems however not to be a good solution.

Btw. What is TCS? (Traveller Combat System?)

the rules of Keipes (I\'ll call him Grossherzog further because I\'ve

But what does this mean for the new Keipes pocket empire and the RC?
Will the RC tolerate other starfaring powers?  Another point is, that
it\'s of course the RC ship Eos, what the players will repair and
reequip. I don\'t think, that the RC will like this.  But what can they
do?

My first idea of the politics of Keipes is the following. They will
continue with their non-trading politics, however, a handful Far
trader will allowed to land, and to trade Hitech goods -- prevered
good to help raising TL -- for raw materials or work (refinement of
other goods).  As fast as possible (and as I got the World Tamers book
:-), Keipes will started to establish a colony on a neighbour world,
together with a strong military outpost.  If they can find some old
imperial starships and repair them with the help of there B-starport
theirself, the \'ball will roll on.\'  If the RC will try to attack
Keipes or try of make a trading blockade, Keipes will use their RC
hostages to prevent this.  Keipes isn\'t bad -- they only want to force
the issue, in a feeling of too-late-commers (if you can say so
(probably not)).  The Grossherzog of Keipes is probably the successor
of the old imperial noble -- and he feels he have to re-establish any
sort of empire.  Hovever, Keipes is still affraid of the Virus -- and
they might be not so wrong with this fear.  Promise isn\'t that far.

Lacing further information, I\'ve decided that the people of Keipes are
somewhat related with China in look, names, their working and their
behaviour to the government.

I also gave Keipes two old system defence boots, which they bought
from a Liga trader 10 months ago.  Because of distrust and bad
experiences with the Liga, the Liga mechanics \'accendently died\'
shortly after the Data priests of Keipes thought, that they roughly
understand the functions of the ships.  The Liga help Keipes to grow
because they like to have a safe haven in Aubaine -- so they tried to
use the Grossherzog. Hoverver, it\'s not exaclty clear, who tries
currently to use whom, so agents of the Liga are very upset on Keipes.

Any (further) oppinions?

Planetary defense in its more narrow sense refers to deep site meson guns, heavy surface-to-space missiles (like the PDM in Path of Tears) &c which engage attacking space vessels; the *coastal artillery* if you like.

The only thing compared to which it is expensive is the 0.1% of cost that far 
traders and the like pay for their annual overhaul. Civilian equipment is 
always easier to maintain than the equivalent military item, while far 
trader captains don\'t have the navy\'s *support slice* to pay for. All the 
same, I have difficulty with the annual overhaul --  try taking your car in for 
a service and only paying 0.1%! I haven\'t had an opportunity to look too 
much at the TNE repair rules, but they suggest that even with proper annual 
maintenance, things are going to break down and need replacing, which is why 
starships have redundent systems.

>R&D seems to be non-existent in the Imperium

What about all those Imperial Research Station <Greek letters> that player 
characters so loved to explore/ransack/blow up?

>TCS does not have any rules for replacement of ships as they wear out... but I usually
>assume that a ship has a useful life of 50 years on the average. That means that 2
> of the 10%/year maintenance actually goes to replacement ships

I suspect that TCS didn\'t include 
anything on replacement as it was only 
meant to be a set of wargame campaign 
rules to cover conflicts of far shorter 
duration than the maximum lifetime of a 
ship, rather than a sourcebook for 
generating a system\'s military 
potential. Although I am sure that a 
hull could stay in service for fifty 
years, it would almost certainly need 
an extensive (and expensive) refit 
every decade or so (which ties in with 
TCS\'s ten year initial build), and in 
TCS refits are not part of the 
maintenance cost. Striker says: *budget 
is spent on three things: purchase of 
new equipment, maintenance of 
equipment, and support of 
personnel...Maintenance costs 10% *. 
Although the navy is capital intensive, 
and personnel will not form a large 
proportion of total cost, there is not 
just the crews on the ships; there are 
people in training, base personnel, 
civilian support staff &c all to be 
paid for.

>Also recall that Striker allows the 
military budget to rise to 15% in times 
of war. 

If budgets in TCS are greater than the 
Striker average, then maybe TCS assumes 
that there is a long period of 
confrontation, a *cold war* preceeding 
a *hot war*, when states can arm 
themselves (perhaps reflecting the era 
when TCS was written). Striker also 
says that military spending can drop to 
1% in areas where there has been peace 
for a long time -- this would describe 
much of the interior of the Imperium 
from the Civil War to the Rebellion.

 This is exactly the case. It has been mentioned in Challenge, though

allow Unstreamlined ships with Contra-grav to scoop fuel from gas giants,
but they have to be careful about it (ie. no hot dives).

 The damage level threshholds are misleading, since they sit without
explanation on the character sheet. If you wish to make your games
a bit more lethal, have a copy of page 288 of the TNE rulebook in front
of you while you run combats, THEN cut all location threshholds in half.
This will have the effect of forcing consciousness rolls at the 10-18
damage point range. For those of you with First Printing books and no
errata, I quote the following:

  "Page 288
   "Upon further testing, we have decided that the following wound
 effects provide more entertaining and dynamic play, and suggest that
 all players use these instead.
   "Serious Wounds: the roll to avoid losing conciousness every turn
 in which the character attempts an activity becomes a Difficult roll
 against Constitution. Characters who have lost conciousness make a
 Formidable roll against their Constitution each turn to attempt to
 regain conciousness.
   "Critical Wounds: The roll to regain conciousness is made each
 combat turn, and is a D100 (percentile) roll against the Constitution
 attribute."


>...That skills and other stats depends too much on the attributs is
>however a general problem with the rules.

   All games run this gauntlet: either the attributes make too little
difference, or they make too much. The influence of attributes has been
steadily increasing throughout the editions of Traveller. I, for one,
don\'t mind the current set-up.


>As an instant idea, what\'s about using the "Mensch aergere dich
>nicht"-rule (I don\'t know the english name of this game): On a 6
>reroll and add?

 My fragmentary German does not help with that one, but the term for the
effect is "Open-ended roll." Several American games use it, but those
that do use it to simulate "critical hits" in the absense of another
mechanic. TNE already has an effect for rolling Outstanding Successes
in combat: weapon damage is doubled.
 If I have one continuing complaint with the TNE rulebook, it is that
the _basics_ of combat are scattered across 27 busy pages, and are well
camouflaged.


>A 18x90 HEAP ammoution is probably not the typical personal combat thing.

 Lordy, I hope not.

>not to be a good solution.

 I quite agree.

1)      I don\'t find any faults in it. 

2)      I would run a series of interrogations to the PCs. That is because RC

 After that RC can brief them. You can tell them anything common

TCS is Adventure,Trillion Credit Squadron, published in 1981 by GDW.

It has three parts:

1. Some cleanup and interpretation on the High Guard (2nd edition) ship
design and combat rules.

2. A set of tournament rules to permit players to design fleets according to 
fixed parameters (jump, G\'s, number of pilots, credits) and bash them against
each other.

3. A campaign game played using standard traveller subsectors intended as a 
strategic fleet game.

  In Classic, there was never any restriction on the maximum amount of fuel
you carried, save your hull size.  I started my first Classic game out at
TL 10.  It was not uncommon to have DSR (Deep Space Ranger -- My Empire\'s
explorer group) ships with 80% tankage, allowing 6 or 7 successive jumps. 
The limiting line was life support;  I said a ships internal systems were
good for a month before you had to put down in a livable atmosphere and
flush the LS gear.

   Game Designers\' Workshop is definately ***not*** out of business.  
I spoke to Dave Nilsen yesterday, and all is well (or as well as can be
expected).  Currently they are still getting settled into their new offices,
which are located across town (in the same building that has contained their
warehouse for a number of years--phone numbers for voice and fax are
unchanged if you wish to give them a call and have their number).  The
official move was completed at the end of September, but unpacking and
organizing everything is still taking up all their time.  I wouldn\'t expect
Loren or Dave to be very talkative for at least a few more days.

Remember, it\'s not just one 6 parsec gap you have to bridge, it could be
TEN.  THEN you have to count on 20 Jump 2\'s into deep space, and assume
there will be fuel at your next destination.  So, you CAN do this...

If you want to risk it.  What happens when your Jump-2 Scout
has a PROBLEM after making PART of the trip.  Like, a Jump Drive
breakdown, after making 2 of the three J-2\'s needed to get to the 
next system in this "Jump-6 rift".  

Well, I\'ll tell you what happens.  You are never heard from again.

(You\'re derelict ship provides the first adventure for a new group of
characters at year 800 or so of the TWELFTH Imperium, as it drifts into
the outer reaches of the nearest system. :)

Having said that:)

A government or corporation could do these things.  Using several
ships (so that crew could be transferred to a functional ship in the
event of breakdowns, etc), a government or corporation could establish
refueling stations in deep space.  These perhaps would have started
just as cache\'s of drop tanks stashed at known (and calculatable)
locations.  Eventually, actual permanent (more likely, semi-permanent)
stations could be established...  I think they would have been - 
somebody would have looked at that jump-6 rift and resolved to cross
it.  Why?  Because it\'s there.  Probably corporations would balk at
the expense, unless there was some report of incalculable wealth to
be made, but governments would probably want such a route, for
communication if nothing else.

Hi All, 

Two questions for the learned lists...

1) What was the approximate TL at the end of the Rule of Man, 
i.e. Twilight or before the Long Night. I have been cleaning up
some details in my campaign and this is a loose end. I assumed 
a TL = 12 when I first wrote it. Is that accurate?

2) After reading the book "What If The Moon Didn\'t Exist?" I\'ve 
realized that the effects of a nova I had used to trigger a 
collapse would be more devastating than I thought. 

(I know it is a blatant plot device, but I set it 1000 years 
in the past to add background. The civilizations are now exploring
this region again) 

I\'d like to downgrade that stellar event to something which would
permit partial recovery within 3-4 hundred years. Would stellar
flares be applicable? What might cause them? Any other suggestions?

The major civilizations are about 12 to 18 jumps away. I\'d like to 
deny access to a particular region for about 5 - 9 hundred years.
I\'d rather not have more than a 5 jump radius of complete ruination.
I\'d like it to be survivable outside of that distance. What about
other types of collapses besides novae.

TIA

Paul,

I am working on starship design right now (in preparation for a game
with a background setting which involves adventuring in an area at/near
the front lines of a war (which will itself be a TCS-style game)).

I am finding that just the amount of *work* designing [really] new
ship\'s is daunting.

Just what sort of help are you looking for...?  I would be happy to
assist.  (And I might get some answers for myself that way.)


>Also when using sensors on a starship how can you get a visual image of
>the ship you are looking at with your sensors.

You can only really get a good "visual" image under two conditions:
1) You are actually close enough to optically observe the other ship
2) You have illuminated the other ship with ACTIVE sensors.  Or are
close enough for Passive Sensors to distinguish the target as more
than a point-emitter of energy.

The reasons for the first are obvious.  For the second, ACTIVE sensors
(for most cases, this would be Active EMS) bounce electromagnetic
radiation off of the target, and then pick up the reflected energy on
the A-EMS system\'s antenna.  In a real sense, the image captured is
3-dimensional.  That\'s because all of the energy in an active EMS pulse
is emitted at the same time, but it doesn\'t all COME BACK at the same
time.  So, the energy that comes back later has bounced off of a part
of the target that is FARTHER AWAY from your ship than the part of the
target that the "first returning" energy bounced off of.  This [very
slight] delay allows the computer to build an image that\'s fairly
accurate.  The level of accuracy depends on a number of things, but
can basically be abstracted to the level of success of the Sensor
Operator, some means of determining the effectiveness of the image
building computer/software (combination of the success of the operator,
and the original success level of the programmer when s/he wrote the
software, perhaps), and the "horsepower" of your computer.

Now, why don\'t Passive Sensors work well?  Because Passive sensors
primarily detect _radiated_ energy (active sensors detect _reflected_
energy) - So an Active EMS system can give you an idea of an object\'s
range and *shape* (so you can make a guess as to it\'s displacement and
mass - and construct a visual image), and passive sensors give you an
idea of the object\'s *radiated power* (so you can estimate the output 
of it\'s power plant, for example).  Note that when you are close
enough that your Passive Sensors are able to distinguish the target
ship as something more than a point-energy-source, it becomes possible
for Passive Sensors to contribute to the "visual" imaging as well.
How close this is depends on the sensor range & effective radius of the
antenna.

Example:  Your eyes are passive sensor antennas.  You can distinguish
the moon as something other than a point energy source.  You have a 
pretty good idea of what the moon looks like.  You can NOT distinguish
[from Earth :) ] ANTARES as something other than a point energy source.
You do NOT know what ANTARES looks like (in the absence of other
information).

Sensors, however can be confused.  (see Sensor Decoys,
Electromagnetic Masking, and FORCE FIELDS)  Sensor Decoys confuse
sensors (and may degrade the _clarity_ and _detail_ of your "visual"
image, by reflecting some of your sensor energy while not being part
of the target ship, yet too small to be "sensed" independently).
Electromagnetic Masking confuses sensors by directing the radiated energy 
generated within the ship and [a small amount of] reflected 
energy (so it doesn\'t find its way to your antenna).  Force Fields 
confuse sensors by absorbing some or all of the energy that Sensors try 
to detect. Note that a flickering black globe will absorb a significant 
portion of an Active EMS system\'s radiated energy:

Example - X amount of energy would otherwise reflect off of your ship
and bounce back to my ship\'s Active EMS Antenna.  But your ship has
a Black Globe Force Field flickering at a 40% flicker rate.  It
absorbs 40% of X as X approaches your ship, and then absorbs 40% of
(X - 0.4X) as it passes through the flickering screen on its way
*BACK* to my sensor\'s antenna.  So X retains 60% * 60% = 36% of its
value.  Your screen has stopped 64% of X with a 40% flicker rate, and
my sensor only gets 36% percent of what it would have gotten.  Under
certain conditions, this might make the difference between being spotted
and not being spotted.  The globe would only absorb a straight 40% of
radiated energy, however.  (Puzzle- A TL 16+ black globe flickering
at it\'s maximum rate, in this example, will absorb 100% of X, rendering
my Active Sensors totally useless.  Why?)

White globes render a ship invisible in all spectrums, except those
that the ship is using for sensors and communication, to ACTIVE SENSORS
[only] (no effect on the other guy\'s passive sensors - but *yours* are
limited to whatever frequencies you don\'t feel like absorbing.

Finally, if the target ship *jams* active EMS (and this jamming does
not have to extend all the way to your ship), you will lose your
visual image.


Hope this helps.

   Then it is a question of game mechanics, and if GDW\'s way of
simulating reality doesn\'t work for you, then it doesn\'t work for you.
Just be aware that GDW\'s system is what it is, and I doubt they will change
it any time soon.  I happen to think it works extremely well, and my
players had an easy time grasping it once I set up a "Gun Range" Senario
for them.  Essentially we took a gaming session to go through the
individual combat rules.  First, I set up targets at various ranges for them
to shoot at with the weapon of their choice.  After sampling several
different weapons at a variety of ranges, they discovered which weapons
worked best for them at simply hitting a target.  Next, I ran them through
a combat simulator.  At Level 1, I had them engage fix targets at various
ranges and apply the basic damage results (no knock downs, no instant kills,
etc.).  At Level 2, they engaged "live targets" that could shoot back (tranq
darts, so if the PC got hit, he went to sleep) and I implimented all damage
results on the NPCs.  At Level 3, I added NPCs with "real" weapons, and
implimented all damage results on the PCs.  Everyone enjoyed the
simulations, and they were well versed with the combat rules and what their
weapons could and could not do in the end.

   A 18x90 mm round is a high powered 12 gauge shotgun shell.  The
auto assault shotgun you see in the RCES Equipment Guide was my design,
though GDW turned it into a TL 10 model with a TL 12 laser sight (my
original design called for the entire weapon to be TL 12).  A bit heavy at
TL 10, it nevertheless is a practical weapon for close combat situations.  It
can of course pierce armor, and it was originally envisioned to be used
against armored troops close in (making those nasty blade weapons--"can
openers" obsolete).  The effect it has on unarmored troops can best be
summed up with the word *splat!* (average damage 42 pts. with buckshot at
close range, 2 more points than an NPC can take, and that\'s on single shot
without exceptional success--it is capable of firing three round bursts).

   Using a bigger round to eliminate the hit points "problem" is about the
only way to do it if you are going to stay within the confines of the
existing system.  As I stated previously though, I\'m not convinced there is a
problem with the existing system.

Btw. What is TCS? (Traveller Combat System?)

   In old usage, TCS stood for \'Trillion Credit Squadron\', though I think
I\'ve
seen it used lately in reference to the \'Traveller Combat System\'.  Someone
will come along and correct me, I\'m sure, if I\'m wrong.  :-)

Let me make sure I understand: you are looking for a single astronomical
event 
which will cause civilization collapse acrss a sphere of about 10 parsecs 
(comparable to a loss of about 500 years development) and ecosystem collapse 
(just nobody left, at least bigger than a hedgehog) over about 5 parsecs.

1st, what is wrong with the supernova idea?  Except that the zone of death is

just a couple of light years it should do fine.  It would be especially 
injurious to early electrical tech levels (of the kind suceptable to an EMP, 
like us).

2nd, how about collision with a fast transisting cloud of extragalactic
matter? 
Nobody can say for sure what\'s beating about out there, except its probably
not 
nothing.  Put it nice and fast - say 80%c This would decrease planetary 
temperatures, causing ecosystem problems, would impact at a high energy
causing 
elevated radiation levels.  Travel (interplanetary and intersteller) would 
probably cease -- and it would generally make a nusence of itself.  We assume
it
is moving across the plane of the galaxy, so that it has gone down thorught
the 
map.  its 20 parsecs across, so about 80 years to transit completely at .8c

The problem (in BR) is not that you don\'t need passive sensors.  The problem
is 
that the map is too small.  We have been discussing two patches:

Up the map size to, say, 100x100 (we are playing blind with a ref, so this is

not nuts).  This means that you do not have all those sensors crammed into
one 
small space where the cumulative low probablility events will nail you.

If you go active, passive sensors will get a fix on you out to twice the
range 
of YOUR ACTIVE sensor.  This means that you WILL keep quiet.  And you WILL 
install passive sensors.

For that matter, going to a power down state on a covert mission starts to
make 
sense.

A PAWS will produce more damage in a target with armour less then half the 
value of the PAWS\'s penetration than a laser of equal output energy. The 
laser will however be much more useful against a more heavily armoured 
target.

I did a quick review of the 2300AD StarCruiser Naval Architect\'s Manual and
FFS
regarding Stuuterwarp Efficiency.  It quickly becomes apparent that the
greatest variation between the 2300AD and FFS is that FFS uses Parsecs and
2300AD uses Lightyears.

In 2300AD each tactical space combat hex was 600,000km and each turn was 1
minute.  Brillant Lances scale is 30,000km and 30 minutes.  In 2300AD ships
moved at twice their StutterWarp Efficiency in hexes per minute.

SUGGESTED FFS RULES ERATA:
FFS p. 43: I suggest that a FFS rules fix should be to retain the 2300AD 
rule
of StutterWarp Efficiency  equals travel distance of LY/day.

The conversions for Brillant Lances movement are as follows, FFS p. 43: 
 Forty
times (i.e., 2  * 20) warp efficiency per MINUTE.  Multiply this by THIRTY 
for
BL time scale in hexes per turn.  If only StutterWarp Ships are involved
divide
each BL turn into TEN 3 minute segments.

Yes an almost perfect fix!
Also try:
 - Use actual mass instead of "10D" in the efficiency formula.
 - Charge build up range limitation= TL^(1/3) parsecs (= 7.665 ly @ TL 13 )

Useful weapon range formulae:
FF&S contains different formulae for calculating the short range of CPR guns 
and Mass drivers. The projectile that leaves the barrel of either weapon 
should however behave in the same way and not care what fired it!
Plasma and Fusion guns also have a strange range formula that appears to 
disreguard common sense.
The following can be used to produce consistant results for all weapon 
types:
The following definitions are used:
u= muzzle velocity (m/s)
t= 0.3 (s)
r= projectile radius (cm)
M= projectile mass (kg)
S= Special KEAP ammo pen mod eg 3 for APFSDSDU
J= pulse energy of cartridge (MJ)

CPR gun short range = (1/k)ln(ukt+1)
k=4.04*(10^-4)(r^2)/MS

Mass driver short range = (1/k)ln(ukt+1)
k=1.286*(10^-3)/rS

H.E. weapon range= (1/k)ln(ukt+1)
k=4.115*(10^-3)/J^(1/3)
u= 8000 for plasma
u= 12000 for fusion

   The Terran Confederation reached TL 12 around 2300 AD, shortly before
the Ziru Sirka (First Imperium) capitulated.  At this time the Vilani were
at TL 11, and had been for 3000 years.  It seems that the Rule of Man
remained at TL 11-12 for its 400 years, but there is no nothing I\'ve read
that details this.  Sylea was TL 10 as the Long Night began.

Why?  I\'ve never been able to see why a supernova could have a dramatic 
effect (ie. catastrophic and immediate destruction to civilisation by 
direct physical effects) beyond a few parsecs.  OK, so the political and 
economic etc. repercussions of a SN in an important system (eg. Antares) 
might be devastating.  All this assumes that when you say `nova\' you mean 
a supernova.  If you simply mean a nova (which is a much less dramatic 
and destructive event) then all the above s aplicable, only more so!  Of 
course, a nova may be the alternative to supernova you are looking for.  
Stellar flares are a bit puny, me thinks.

If you want to start throwing about high energy steallar events in your 
campaign, it is probably worth getting an Astronomical Dictionary which 
will explain novae, etc.  I\'ve always thought dwarf novae, symbiotic 
stars, and other cataclysmic variables provide possibiilities for 
interesting disaster effects (by analogy to Terra, living in these 
stellar systems are a bit like living in an Eartquake zone).

Since I play battle rider, I am inclined to agree - but I would think that
the 
paws would be very effective for surface feature degredation: destruction of

This is true.  Surface features are nailed by Damage Value, which can
be much higher for a PAWS than for a laser.  The problem is that I can
design a laser that will get _through_ your armor and get at the 
internals of your ship.  Your Active EMS Antenna (on the surface)
isn\'t going to do you any good if I\'ve shot out the actual sensor
control unit.  Also, at range, bay mounted PAWS will usually have
less _Damage_ value than barbette lasers, but will cost more, take
up more space, weigh more, and consume more power.

Now, at _lower_ tech levels, PAWS effectiveness approaches that of
lasers (because the PAWS has an Input Energy to Discharge Energy
ratio of 5:1 at all Tech Levels, whereas Laser IE to DE ratio improves
with tech level.)  Maybe at TL 10 or so, a PAWS might be more
effective (especially with X-ray lasers unavailable at that TL).
I\'d have to look and see.

No one has answered my question about the Critical Hit table in
the TNE rule book.  IS having _Penetration_ Value across the top
a mistake?  IS replacing _Penetration_ Value with _Damage_ Value
the propere correction?

Also, I mixed my units accidentally in my last post.  I said that
the Laser took up 6 displacement tons and that the PAWS I used in
the example took up more than 50,000 displacement tons.  This is
incorrect.  The PAWS in the example took up more than 50,000 CUBIC
METERS (about 3571 displacement tons).  It\'s still a ridiculous
ratio, however.

Now, a ship design PHILOSOPHY question.  What levels of Armor to
people tend to put on WARSHIPS that they design, and why?

I envision 3 sort of "plateaus" in Armor level, and these give
Armor Values of 310, 602, and 1975.

Here\'s why:

1)  310 is EXACTLY the Penetration Value of the standard TL 15
turret laser.

2)  602 is EXACTLY the Penetration Value of the standard TL 14-15
barbette laser.

3)  1975 is EXACTLY the Penetration Value of the lasers on the
high yield detonation pumped X-ray laser.

Other weapons are pretty much customized, so I envision warships
being armored to one of these levels, based on practicality.
1975 may be an impractical armor value for anything but the biggest
Battleships/Riders.  602 Might be practical for Cruisers.  I don\'t 
know.  What do people think?  Do you put higher armor levels on, just
in case you run into someone who\'s _higher_ tech level than you?
(On a lark, I designed a TL 20 barbette laser for the standard
barbette socket.  It\'s ghastly.  PR:DV = (1/31):97 at all ranges.
That\'s a penetration value of 3007...  Discharge Energy = 1500 Mj)

Please, please, PLEASE, PUH-LEEEZE share your thoughts on the
Armoring doctrine, the TNE Critical hit table, &c...

Thanks

There are solar flares everyday.  During periods of above-average solar 
flare activity, broadcast signals can be degraded or even interrupted.
If such flare activity was more intense, this could develop into 
permanent damge for relay equipment, and even damage to power
distriution systems.  All you need to do is posit a REALLY BIG flare or
period of flare activity.

Larry Niven had a really good short story about an EXTREMELY powerful
flare, called "Inconstant Moon" (I think).  His flare was powerful enough
to temporarily superheat the atmosphere on one side of the world,
which would cause all sorts of environmental problems on the other
side.  Definitely worth a read, nut I don\'t remember which collection of
short stories it was in.

Re: Reports of GDW\'s demise:
After sending my message about the GDW rumors, I called GDW and got
an answer (as I expected).  I took this info (and a copy of yesterday\'s
GDW posting) to my local shop, and encountered the same assistant
flunky.  I told him that I did verify GDW was still around, and offered to
show him the posting.  His response was that he honestly could not
care less, that GDW produced shoddy product that never sold, and
went back to his ongoing Magic game.  All of this was started when I
foolishly asked him if he knew what the release date for Vampire Fleets
was.  This whole situation reminded me of the Challenge 74 editorial, 
and has definitely prompted me to not return to this store.  This is too
bad, as the store in question was a relatively new store, that I started
patronizing in hopes of encouraging a second game store in this city
(Tucson).  Even during the DGP Heresy, I have always enjoyed GDW\'s
product, so this attitude really surprised me.  Is this a common
attitude out there, or did I just happen upon a nest of fools?

On the plus side, I would say TNE offers:
(1) Less certainty for the players because old imperial space is less stable
(2) The chance to develop very different societies as a result of distrust of
technology
(3) The chance for the players to engage in empire building/civilization at a
much more personal level.  Their actions can have more of an effect because
of
the smaller scale of the situations they are likely to be in
(4) Greater freedom within imperial space to develop worlds, cultures,
empires.
(5) The chance to do some fun things with the virus gimmick as others have
said
 
On the downside:
(1) Trade outside of the spinward marches is a very different animal.  I was
always a big fan of the old long trade oriented far trader campaigns.
Although
the current setup could still see trade, but it would be on a barter type of
system, and one would have to be very careful of losing ones ship to the
"natives"
(2) The virus has a lot of problems, both in terms of planning and
plausibility.
(3) There is a danger of creating a D&D dungeon-crawl type of setting with
the
Star Vikings as they plunder technology in their snatch \'n grabs.  
(4) TNE is an attempt at a darker setting.  GDW is jumping on the darker
setting
trend in games.  It remains to be seen if the supplements offer something for
those who prefer a more stable and optimistic future.
 
Lots more pros and cons, I\'m sure.  I\'m just two tired to think of any right
now, and this letter is already too long.  
 
Overall, I think that the TNE does offer greater alternatives to the referee
than it destroyed.  The regency still does exist for those who want greater
stability.  The wilds exist for those who like that type of campaign.  Within
the pocket empires, hiver\'s sphere, regency, etc the referee is of course the
final determinant as to what their campaign will be like.

     It\'s *deliberately* consistent.  My created area is far outside the
(still thriving, mind) Third Imperium, and they do things a little bit
differently.  For example, how do you start a colony?  Do you dump a
bunch of people and some supplies on a planet and more-or-less leave the
new colonists to fend for themselves (Third Imperium model), or do you
send in a crew of professional construction and infrastructure engineers
who build everything that is needed for colonization in advance
(automated production facilities, housing, amenities, etc.) so that the
colonists can just move from their old world to their new one and pick
up their lives where they left off (my model).  Basically, the people in
my world *work* at making their technology as uniform and consistent as
possible from world to world.  That way, you can go from world to world
within the area and *depend* on being able to get expert and correct
repairs for your starship, no matter what port you come to (like, even
before the colonists arrive, there\'s at *least* a B class starport in
place, waiting for their landing).  You don\'t *ever* have to get your
hands dirty with low tech.

    Shifting subjects, I have noticed that not many places hereabouts are

directed mainly at Traveller related materials, and seems to be based on what
these retailers consider the poor performance of the MegaTraveller materials.
I have to go 80 miles to get my TNE stuff, and getting Challenge isn\'t a sure
thing at all. (I\'m probably going to subscribe). Admitedly, this isn\'t a very

I agree completely, Derek. I have been designing my ships with batteries of

I think this is very scientific -- although I am NOT using standard lasers in
my
own design; in a campaign, new plateaus would arise in a similar form.

BR uses a penetration rule in which one critical hit is lost per 10 (round
down)
armour units.

This sets plateaus in increments of 10 BATTLE RIDER DV points - the scale in 
non-linear, and the key points are:

BR                      BL/TNE
10                        500
20                      4,000
27                     10,000 

The chart does not to thiry, although I would guess that\'s equal to about 13,000
TNE armour points.

Anyway, 500 and 4,000 are the critical points in my designs.

  The information in this post is valid as of 11 October 1994
  (284-1201).

  After hearing about the rumors of the demise of GDW, I took the 
  opportunity to check them out, in the best way I know.  I called 
  GDW.  They flatly denied that there was any truth involved in 
  those rumors.  I then asked about certain upcoming publications:

  The All-Traveller issue of CHALLENGE will be going to subscribers 
  within the next two weeks; shipments to distributors will be 
  leaving GDW during the first week in November.

  The Vampire Fleets sourcebook is being delayed until some time 
  1Q95, so that GDW can release the Regency Sourcebook.  Once 
  released, VF will support both Regency and RC campaigns.

  The Regency Sourcebook (with just that title - foo, I _did_ like 
  "Shall Not Perish"... Oh well, nothing is stopping us from 
  continuing that project...) is also looking at a 1Q95 release, 
  but earlier in that frame than VF.

I see two possible outcome if these plateau\'s are formalized:

1. The standard weapons will suddenly become obsolete and replaced
a "new and improved" standard that\'ll defeat these armor.  Result:
classic case of weapon designer vs armor designer.

2. Depending on the available resources of both sides and the 
relative cost in percentage of available resouce to produce these
behemoths.  It is quit possible that armoring at these level will
greatly reduce the number of available platforms.  Then it becomes
a strategy of hitting where you\'re not with more numerous and less
well protected platforms.  In which case there are at lease three
outcomes (this is just off the top of my head, comments are greatly
welcomed)
-	The big ship fleet ignores the smaller platforms and strike
straight at the heart of the enemy.  While at the same time the 
smaller platform fleets penetrates a less then perfectly defended
frontier and do the same thing.
-	Big ship fleet attempts to engage the small ship fleet. Small
ship fleet stays dispersed and slowly wear down the BSF\'s logistic net.
-	BSF stay to provide point defense of strategic targets.  No
threat to small ship fleet.

SuperNove would most likely wipe out a lot more then the area you\'re 
interested in.  If it put\'s out enought radiation for us to see one going
off in the SMG, it\'ll roast quit a bit within a 5-10 parsec area.

But think about this:  What about a temporary wormhole?  This is complete
hypothetical and I don\'t claim to know anymore then rudimentry cosmology!
What if a black hole dies in a burst of EM & gravitation radiation.  One of
the by product is a wormhole else where in the universe.  The wormhole 
exist only long enought to aide in the release of the store energy of the
black hole.  This can be just as violent as a supernova but smaller in 
scale.

  I would disagree about your first statement.  Lasers are the fall-back
weapon.  Every ship carries them, and almost no one carries sufficient
defense against them.  Due to the way the armor tables work, you only need
to be able to score two points on your outter range band to break your
target in BR.
  However, at closer ranges there is a good arguement for using PAWs and
MSGs as range-band:1 or 2 weapons.  Smaller hulls require getting down to
"point-blank" ranges to fight effectively unless they are all power-plant. 
In either case, they don\'t have alot of room to pack screens and armor
into.  This is where PAWs and MSGs come in;  you can\'t let a 400 ton PCru
get into firing range for missles and his laser, or he *will* break you. 
So, set your MSG\'s to "Slow Simmer" and fry him.  Leave the lasers for
picking off missles and dealing with the capital ships that *do* have too
much armor and screens to be effectively hassled by PAWs and MSGs.
  I think a better assesment would be to say that PAWs and MSGs are
generally ineffective against *larger* warships.  Of course, when you take
his screens down through laser fire....

   You just happened upon a nest of fools.  One of the local stores here in
Halifax is providing prizes at the gaming/ fantasy Con in November, only
for those tournaments using GDW systems.  Traveller/ Twilight 2000/ etc.,
is *easy* to find here in Halifax.  Very popular, according to the store
owners.
   Of course, I will agree that GDW *has got* to fire their proof readers
and QA team.  *Way* too much product goes out the door with mistakes in it.
 That *is not* helping the repuation of GDW or its product line.

   I agree that bay mounted PAWS (and MGs) are usually useless, but the short
range is what I disliked.  Spinal mounts, however, are useful if you want a
lot of damage from a single weapon.  There are limits to how far you can
scale up lasers, especially if you don\'t like focal arrays being thicker than
they are wide.

   Note that with gravitic focusing, lasers have the same input to output
energy ratio as PAWs, at all TLs.  Without the gravitic focusing, pre-xray
lasers are a non-issue in space combat (a 100 ton bay laser, focal array
diameter of 9.5 m, wavelength of FUV, has an _extreme_ range of 7600 km).

   The Brilliant Lances rule book says damage value; the table says remaining
penetration value.  Take your pick. :)  (I\'d use damage.)


A few TL 15 designs:

   Crew sizes for MGs is something I\'ll modify for my own use (I have a hard
time imagining what all those 128 MGunners are doing :).

   Note that the laser\'s focal array is 6.4 m thick and masses close to 1000
tonnes.  I\'m considering limiting the focal array\'s thickness to 20% of its
diameter (haven\'t decided on the effects of high ROFs).  The above laser
would thus be limited to 1900 Mj (a mere 1/35-109 at all ranges).  Any
thoughts?

Actual mass was used in 2300AD formulas.  While I mentioned the greatest
difference between FFS and 2300AD Stutterwarp was Parsecs vs. LY for
efficiency, the mass, cost, crew sizes and volume requirements are VERY
different.  For example, 2300AD powerplants were much more massive than
comparable FFS powerplants.  Unless GDW releases a 2300AD Sourcebook, and FFS
supplement to support it, I suggest using all FFS mass, cost (one Cr. = 1.5Lv),
crew sizes and volume requirements be used for simplicity.  2300AD ships would
have to be backward engineered to retain appropriate charactoristics.

> - Charge build up range limitation= TL^(1/3) parsecs (= 7.665 ly @ TL 13 )

Interesting idea for a non 2300AD Campaign but in 2300AD the range limitation
was a fixed value.  StutterWarp discharge was required after 7.7LY to prevent
explosive radiation release i.e., death to humans.  If I recall correctly one
more  LY could be squezed out by an Impossible engineering task. Anyway the
near Earth 3D stellar geography requires a 7.6(?) LY leg to explore portions
the French Arm that occured at TL 10.  Therefore, this proposed fix would only
work in non 2300AD campaigns.
