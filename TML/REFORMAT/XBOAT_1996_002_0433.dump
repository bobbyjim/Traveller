"Best" for *what*? Each type is going to have good points and bad
points. So what may be good for *some* things might be lousy for
others. 

As an example, take the Habegger gates F. M. Busby has been using in
recent works. You stuff things in one end, and it comes out the other
end. No time passes for anything in transit, but two years pass for the
outside world. And they don\'t have a range limit.

So they\'d be great for bulk cargo, and for colonization. But they\'d be
lousy for general travel, and for urgent cargo. They\'d be a dead loss
for most military uses. 

They\'d make little difference in the Imperium (and in fact, they\'d
explain the lack of bulk cargo carriers). And the X-boat routes would
still be very important (who wants two year-old news, if you can get it
only a few months old?).

This is an extreme case, but most FTL drives in fiction have limits of
some sort, if only because it makes for better story possibilities.

Since it\'s a computer program, I\'d rather have it do *all* the calcs
and store them in some sort of *compact* record format. Then be able to
select the level of detail I want to see when browsing.

I think all the physical stuff (or at least *most* of it) should be
generated together, as it tends to be somewhat interdependent.

I also think we need to have routines for generating sectors (only
gives stellar type, and maybe gas gaints), routines for generating a
system given the stellar type info (including GG if the sector routines
generate that), and routines for fleshing out the system.

I base this on the "three" levels of data we seem to get:

1. stellar type
2. UPP for mainworld
3. detailed system

We need to be able to generate the lower levels starting from any of
the higher levels. And that includes "adjusting" the detailed system to
make the mainworld fit.

Actually, there\'s no reason to suppose that there is only *one* way to
do something. Consider flight. There\'s lighter than air, aerodynamic
lift, and overwhelming thrust. For interplanetary travel, there are
reaction drives, solar sails, etc.

Which you use depends in part on what you want to accomplish. For any
particular task, one method is usually much better than the others. But
that doesn\'t mean that you can\'t do it other ways.

There may be several ways of achieving FTL. Certainly the current
theories sugest at least two *different* methods (wormholes and the
Alucubierre drive).

And as a previous post suggested, if you are careful to adjust the
performance and limitations of various technologies, you can have
multiple drive types with no real problems.

Heck, it could even turn out that after the "warp drive" and "jump
drive" folks get to know each other, they\'ll both think that the other
is *nuts* for using the drive they do. 

"If that warp drive breaks down, you\'re stuck out in deep space and
have to hope someone can find you."

"So? At least they\'ll know *where* to look for us. If that Jump drive
of yours mis-jumps, you could wind up *anywhere*!"

(and round and rond they go... :-)

How about the following:

HPGL (A size) \\___ (I\'ve got a 7475A plotter)
HPGL (B size) /
Tek 4010      (I have a Tek vector display)
CGM	      (this is "standard" *scalable*, *vector* format)

I like vector formats, because they can be scaled, even if they don\'t
have built-in support for scaling. And most decent graphics packages
can handle CGM.

Small Craft: 5, Command: 7, Stewards: 2, Medical: 1, Marines: 48

Mission:
The Ajax Frigate is designed to "show the flag" and discourage piracy. As a 
representative of Imperial might, it can patrol systems where wending a 
cruiser would be uneconomical and/or overkill.
However, it should be more than capable of seeing off a corsair or two with 
its particle accelerator and missile barbettes, whilst defending with 
sandcasters & laser turrets.  It is not  designed to fight larger craft, so 
no meson screen is fitted.

Mission:
The Conveyor is a hastily refitted Atlantic class cargo transport. It was 
converted at short notice under orders of the hard-pressed local Navy.
The original cargo bay was partitioned off to create extra accommodation, 
workshops and launch bays.
It provides extra fighter support in fleet actions and always operates with 
escorts to shield it from enemy craft.

I don\'t have the ref handy, but they were presented

Now, no sane human would use this drive ("I\'m not going
to take 6 yrs to go Jump-1") for interstellar travel,
but there are a few larger systems where it could be
used for interplanetary transport.

There is actually a good range of possibilities that can
be covered in this way, but you have to watch out for
"incompatible" FTL methods.  Maybe under-powering a Jump
field generator only warps the space instead of penetrating
it, allowing for "slow" FTL, maybe there is a different
drive geometry involved, or a different type of energy
field.  Overpower your meson screens and perhaps you get
a boost to your manuever drives ;)  The possibilities
are nearly endless.  It is just a matter of finding a combo
that works.

   Stutterwarp would tromp all over any drive that requires acceleration.
It doesn\'t accellerate, it just moves. So it can change direction
instantaneously and literally stop on a dime.

   As an aside, it would be fun to run a beer & pretzels game that had
both Jump and Stutterwarp. The way I\'d do it would be to give Jump and SW
similar performance, but make SW *extremely* expensive so that only
governments could possibly afford them. You would rapidly see an
interesting dichotomy - military vessels would all get SW, while civilian
and commercial vessels would make-do with cheap Jump Drives. Civilian combat
with military vessels would be a joke. Pirates would have a hard time,
unless they managed to get their hands on a bootleg, possibly defective
SW drive. In which case, they would be *real* dangerous - until the drive
broke down. <g>

   The way I see it, this means SW drives will probably be strictly
controlled (no reason for civies to have one) and probably booby-trapped
to prevent missappropriation by "non-superpowers" that don\'t have SW, or
pirates.

  Yep. These people that keep trying to artificially limit the game
are dreaming. There just going to have to live with it, and try to think
about we\'ll be dealing with these problems in the future. Heck, that\'s
what s/f is _about_.

   Players are *always* going to find ways to ruin the referees day.
It\'s much better to just keep the game simple and assume that Things
Happen and have a rational system set up to deal with the potential
problem. Trying to drop a PB? Have a patrol cruiser *just happen* to be
in the Right Place at the Right Time. If you\'ve already got the players
used to the idea of an patrol presence, they shouldn\'t object to it.

   Such a game is *much* more fun than a game where the referee says
"hmm, I don\'t like that - sorry you can\'t do it"

   What *is* the difference betwen dropping a rock at 50km/sec and
dropping a rock at .1c? In either case, they are guilty of war crimes
and would be chased to the ends of the universe, in my game.

   Players should be discouraged from doing things like this, but there\'s
better ways than "you can\'t do it".

You might go with Word 5.  A lot of people, esp. Mac users, haven\'t
bothered to "downgrade" to Word 6.  That way the number of people
that can get formated text will be greater.

I haven\'t been following that closely.  Are you dropping that dumb
rules where a cargo costs the same regardless of how far it is
being taken?

  Traveller digests appear in XBoat digests as well.  I cannot at
  this time think of a single topic that is currently being
  discussed on either list that is not also being discussed on the
  other.

  Additionally, all of the current traffic seems to be on various
  topics associated with Traveller, a product line yet to be
  released by Imperium Games (as opposed to Traveller, a product
  released about 20 years ago by Game Designers Workshop).  I do
  not contend that this is a bad thing.  Far from it - it signals
  that there is quite a lot of enthusiasm for the forthcoming
  product line, and much involvement in seeing that it succeeds,
  from both a technical and marketing/social perspective.  I
  support this concept wholeheartedly.

  I do contend that the duplication is unnecessary, both to the
  recipients of the lists, and to the administrator of the lists.

  I am therefore formally requesting that discussion on
  reunification of Traveller and XBoat be opened, with the proposed
  name for the combined list being "Traveller".

  This is not to be taken as an objection to redivision, or a new
  division, once the new products have become available - if there
  is truly a legitimate need for a separate list to support one or
  more of the superseded product lines, I will support the creation
  of that list.  I simply feel that at this time, the focus is
  clearly on the forthcoming product line, to the apparent
  exclusion of all else, and that given this focus, the separate

As a dedicated fan of Classic Traveller who doesn\'t own MT nor T:NE, I 
support a reunification of the lists.  I think people can refrain from 
flaming others\' tastes in Traveller flavors.  (Besides, we should all 
agree to police this sort of thing, and hopefully Rob will boot truly 
abusive folks off the list.)

I don\'t know how difficult it would be to create another list if it 
becomes necessary after T4 is introduced, though.  Maybe Rob would rather 
not go through that, eh?  Might be easier for him to keep Xboat around, 
which he can then designate as the CT/MT/TNE list, leaving the Traveller 
list for T4 (or whatever division seems logical at the time).

What do you say, Rob?

What is bad is when you are also on GDW-Beta where the ship design stuff
is being designed.  I frequently get the same message three times.

I don\'t know, but there are ways to make it happen.

Actually Paul, the list ADMIN could issue an edict similar to:

>From your ADMIN:

     The Traveller Mailing List is for discussions about any Traveller
     version of Traveller.  All discussions regarding T4 should be 
     discussed here.  

     The Xboat mailing list is for discussions of Classic and Mega-
     Traveller.  TNE and T4 discussions are not permitted there.
     Any one on Xboat who wishes to discuss T4, or follow its development
     should subscribe to Traveller as well as Xboat.

     Cease and desist any further posts to Xboat that relates to T4 or MMT.
     
     Cross posts should be kept to a minimum, and should only address specific
     issues that are important to both list such as administravia, or questions
     of a generic nature such as "Why was there no Grandmother for Grandfather"
     that needs the input from multi-era people.  Announcments of Web sits, and
     other things that are of the common good are ok to be cross posted.

Now these two lists have very specific missions.  T4 seems to be important to both
lists, but specifically by the charters of the two mailing lists, T4, while its 
roots are CT/MT, is clearly to be discussed in Traveller, and since its not CT/MT
should not be discussed in Xboat.

Discussion?  Do we need a list to discuss the RFD?

     Personally, I\'d prefer that not happen.  I only subscribe to the
Xboat list, because I don\'t *ever* want to hear *anything* about TNE
(admittedly, some comment about that filth occasionally leaks over into
Xboat, but life is much better here than on the original TML).

     If the lists were consolidated, I\'d have to completely unsubscribe,
and as one of the original members of the old TML, I don\'t think I\'d
like that too much.

I completely agree. (Sorry, I usually dislike \'me too\' postings, but in =

Actually, there\'s a patch that will let Word 5.1 on the Mac read and write
Word 6 files. It goes in the Word Commands folder, and works
nicely.Admittedly, I haven\'t had much call to use it, but it did let me
help out my cousin, who had typed her resume on a PC/Word 6 in Washington
and needed it printed off here in OK.

If anyone\'s interested, I can mail it as an attachment.

I\'m not sure what you mean.  I meant Word 5.  A lot of people upgraded
on up to 5, but Microsoft screwed up version 6 (at least on the Mac)
bad enough that a lot of people stopped there.  It\'s bad enough that
MS took out ads in Europe apologizing for how it came out.

As specified in 2300 and FFS you are right.  <g> However, if you
require several seconds to bring the sutter up to speed or to actually
turn it off, say for mechanical reasons, then it will have very fast
pseudo-acceration and psuedo-decelleration.  Then throw in a limit on
the speed that you can slew the direction of the stutterwarp dirve,
say because it needs to be firmly secured to a framework in the hull
you can only change direction by 10 degrees per second, and it takes
18 seconds to reverse direction.
 
Would it still run rings around reaction and standard thruster plates? 
Sure would!  <g>

Of course, you could further limit the stutters.  They could take
longer to pseudo-accelerate.  The turn rate could be even worse, say
the stutter can\'t turn at all, you\'ve got to rotate the ship by other
means...just how fast can you flip a 2000tonne neddle with gyros?  You
could cap their pseudo-speed at lower k/s by making the number of
jumps per second lower and/or the distance per jump smaller.  

I\'m going to play with making stutterswarps sub-c only (or maybe max
them at low c), and use them in the same game where jump is the
standard FTL.  Stutter would be the standard MDrive, and a backup FTL
if you lose the JDrive or something.  <g> I\'ll see how this plays out.

Oh BTW, how does a Stutterwarp match orbital velocity with a planet? 
Or even worse, how would it match velocity with deep space base?  It\'s
got to have some *real* thrust coming from somewhere!

I agree.   I get the digest version, and whichever I read second
now takes next to no time to skim through, as I have already
read most of the articles.  I wouldn\'t want to unsubscribe from
one as I  wouldn\'t want to miss the odd article that\'s only posted
to it.

I would second this.

To me, the idea that there can\'t be any kind of cross-fertilisation
between the different flavours of Traveller is ridiculous.  Don\'t
like the TNE stats for an interesting NPC?  Substitute some CT/
MMT stats instead.  The real work is there in the ideas of the
description and character.  Stats are easy.  Don\'t like the CT
description of a long endurance stealth intelligence cruiser
because the CT description doesn\'t include the dimensions of
the waste water pipes in the plumbing system?  Maybe the
posting might inspire you to design your own version of the ship.
Maybe you could just skip over it.  Personally, I have to confess
that I am not too interested in the rock-velocity-planet-boom
thread, but hell, it\'s relevant to Traveller, and if people want to
discuss it that\'s fine by me, I\'ll just skip to the next thing that
does interest me.

This is getting a bit much like the Wars of Religion for my liking.  Is it
really that much of an effort just to move on to an article that does
not offend your principles?  I think that if we all got this blinkered we
could end up with a proliferation of mailing lists - CT, MT, TNE, MMT,
CT with planet killing rocks, CT without planet killing rocks etc etc.  If
we all tried really hard we could end up with a list each that suited us
perfectly.  You could then be master of your own domain, where the
things you weren\'t keen on never darkened your RAM.  Conversation
would be a bit dull, mind.

Reality check:  It is only a GAME, much as we all love it.  A bit of
toleration for the things we don\'t like but others do might make
the list a more productive and interesting place. (Apologies for
sounding like the end of a Disney film..)

So, I would support a trial of a merged list.  After a while perhaps
we could all be invited to comment on what has really annoyed
us all and what we have liked most.  This might indicate the most
appropriate ways of splitting the lists should we need to.

I for one like things the way they are. I don\'t subscribe to the Traveller list
because I never purchased TNE, but I do appreciate hearing about T4 on
the Xboat list because it directly relates to CT/MT. The Xboat list fills my
mailbox enough. I don\'t want to subscribe to both. Can\'t we save the

Sorry. I was bringing my PC baggage with me. I didn\'t realize there was a

The one thing that you need to remember here, as an Xboat only is just how
much TNE is being discussed on Traveller: none.  zip.  zilch.  There are
however TNE vs. CT vs. MT and which one will MMT favor.  There has been so
little TNE (specific questions to that system, virus talk etc) that it has
become so minor, it shouldn\'t bother CT purists.  Most of the TNE content
messages on Traveller are currently being posted to Xboat any way.

I want people to use the lists as they are chartered, which has MMT being
discussed in Traveller and not Xboat, since MMT is not CT or MT (may be very
close, but . . .)

The rules governing stutterwarps in 2300AD required that ships spend around
40 hours discharging in a gravity well every 7.7 light years travelled. 
This well had to be higher than .1g, at which point the warp efficiency
plummeted to "poor chemical thruster" levels.  In my campaigns using this
system, much of the time spent discharging was used alternatively
free-falling deeply into the well and stuttering back to the .1g limit
again.  The net effect of this is to accumulate a new (real space) vector
of the right amount for your next destination.  For a high example, forty
hours at 1g is certainly enough (144km/s) for most nearby stellar
velocities and well over anything required within systems.

I\'m not a CT purist; I use both CT and MT when it suits my needs. My only
real concern here is the amount of messages going to my mailbox. I went
to PC Expo on Wednesday, so the mail piled up in my mailbox. When I
came back to work on Thursday, I had so many messages (most of them
from the Xboat list) that it took me over an hour to go through them all. At
work, I can\'t afford that kind of time. I can\'t imagine what would happen if
I subscribed to both lists--every day I would have that situation, I
suppose, while with just the one list I only had to deal with it because I
missed a day in the office. 

I guess that causes me to change my point: I am in support of ONE list that
I can subscribe to, where I can get info on CT/MT/T4 (since I have already
ordered an advance copy). The Xboat list has been serving that task for
me nicely; I just don\'t know what goes on in the other list. If we can have
a situation like that, I\'ll be happy, no matter what you call the list.

Maybe, if you want to unify the lists, we can let people on the Traveller
list talk about CT/MT too, not just TNE and MMT. If that were to happen,
perhaps the Xboat list would phase itself out. We\'re mostly (I think) adults
here, I\'m sure that CT enthusiasts can check their flaming of TNE people
and vice versa.

CT and MT are more than welcome to be discussed on Traveller.  That is the
purpose of the list.  Traveller has been and always will be open to discuss
anything with the Traveller name on it. 

Xboat was formed because the CT/MT purists (which I consider myself btw) got
really pee-ed off at TNE and virus and they wanted a TNE free zone.  Traveller
did not exile CT/MT purists, but they left on their own.  Everyone on
Traveller welcomes any and all Traveller discussions.

Now about the volume of mail:  It is probably at an all time high right now
for this list with maybe the exception of when TNE was released.  The
biggest problem is the cross-posting.  Many people are on both lists which
means they get both groups and doubles on every cross post.

The solution:  All T4 traffic on Traveller only, and no cross posts.

> How was the Imperium organised during its heyday? Was it an elective

Actually, for the most part, the Imperium was dynastic.  There was 1 
period when this ceased to be true.  The Civil War of 604-622 
occurred when Olav Hault-Plankwell, Grand Admiral of the Marches, 
assassinated Empress Jacqueline.  Olav was the 2nd Emperor to succeed 
by right of assassination.  The first, which had removed Cleon the 
Mad, had been sanctioned by the moot.  The murder of Jacqueline 
kicked off a 2 decade period where basically any admiral who had 
control of a few fleets, a lot of ambition, and more nerve, could 
move his fleet into the Core sector, kill off the last admiral to 
kill the Emperor, and become Emperor himself.  These Emperors were 
the so called Barracks Emperors.  This might have gone on in indefinitely, 
except for Arbellatra, who knocked off the last of the Barracks 
Emperors.  Arbellatra, unlike her predecessors, knew that she would not be 
immediately supported as Emperor.  She proclaimed herself Regent, 
promising to rule only until a legitimate heir to the throne could be 
found.  Of course, anybody with any sort of legitimate claim to the 
throne was basically freeze dried meat in space, or 2 meters 
underground at the time, so the net result was that Arbellatra 
became Emperor a few years later.

This restored the principle of dynastic succession, which continued 
until the assassination of Strephon in 1116 by Dulinor.  At this 
point, the Imperium ceased to exist as a single, unified entity.

Theoretically, the Moot is supposed to approve Imperial candidates, 
but with about 3 exceptions, it acted as a rubber stamp body. 

1)  When Cleon the Mad became emperor, the moot actively plotted his 
assassination, and his murderer was proclaimed Emperor by right of 
Assassination.

2) The vast majority of the Barracks Emperors were never approved by 
the Moot.

3)  The Moot never got an opportunity to approve or deny Lucan\'s 
claim to the throne after the deaths of Strephon, his heir, and 
Varian (Lucan\'s older brother) during the Rebellion.  Lucan fearing 
what the Moot might have to say, dissolved it for a year, and then 
began to stuff the Moot to his favor by disenfranchising numerous 
nobles who opposed him, and granting new titles and fiefs to a number 
of his lackeys.

The Imperial family had vast holdings in most of the megacorporation, 
as well as fiefs on numerous worlds.  Don\'t know about your comments 
on raiding the Imperial treasury, but if their holdings in the 
megacorps amounted to what they should, I doubt any of the Emperors 
ever wanted for money.  Somebody else could probably 
answer this question better than I could.

Message is as follows:

Don\'t know if this has been brought up before but it might
make a change from rocks and mergers....

Has anyone looked at the nitty gritty differences between the
Aslan race of Traveller and the Klingons of Star Trek?

My *impression* without having an \'alien volume\' on the
Klingons is that while they might \'physically\' be different,
in outlook etc there are a lot of similarities.

Anyone need a dissertation topic?

Ok, so what you\'re saying is that the Traveller list is for all versions of
Traveller: CT/MT/TNE/MMT. Then Xboat is only for CT/MT, with absolutely
no discussion of TNE/MMT. However, if you have a topic that can also
apply to CT/MT, and you\'re on the Traveller list, you want to cross-post
your message so EVERYBODY gets the message. 

I may be new to this list, but that sounds dumb to me. How many CT/MT
purists can there be out there that can\'t just delete a message when it
pertains to TNE/MMT? Most of the topics I\'ve seen have to do with things
that can apply to all versions, or have to do with MMT, which should be of
interest to all. And, it seems, that most people here on Xboat do have a
healthy interest in MMT. In light of all this, it seems, that Xboat should be
deleted, and Traveller set up as the ONLY Traveller list. That way, the
Xboat people could talk about CT and MT all they want, and their
messages could just be in the mix of the rest, and things would be simpler
for everybody.

Does this sound right, or am I starting to make enemies? :)

I\'m not certain the Klingons have quite the preoccupation with land 
that the Aslan do.  I can see the "honor" comparisons right off...  
Actually, the way they\'ve been portrayed in later series, I see 
almost as many comparisons to the Vargr as the Aslan (as long as you 
substitute "charisma" for "honor")

On the other hand, if you think about it, the way Klingons have been 
portrayed in Star Trek is inconsistent.  

In the original Star Trek, they were cardboard cutout villains...no 
depth of character whatsoever, no explanation of motives...  Only 
goal was to kill men in red uniforms, and be killed by bridge crew of 
the Enterpoop...

In Next Generation, they were portrayed with kind of a Code of 
Bushido air to them (honor was more important than life, etc).

Now in DS9, they\'re portrayed almost as a race at war with itself, in 
a near constant state of turmoil...hence my Vargr comparisons...

More likely, it used 3rd derivative forces. But that gets into a *long*

Here\'s a good idea.  How about switches that allow for complete viewing 
of the detail of the main world then the rest of the worlds are fully 
generated but the detail levels are set by the user.  ie. exaustive, 
plenty, enough, bare minimum.

The problem still remains that you have to be able to feed in the main 
world\'s UPP and TPP (?) and get a system that makes sence to these 
readings.

Right now here is a rough break down (guestmates actually) of the traffic of
the combined list (if someone wants to go through the digests and count them
feel free to):

    System Comparison:  30%   (i.e. I like CT better, no I like TNE)
    MMT Related         40%   (Skills, weapons etc.  Carries a lot of the above
                               with it)
    TNE Related:        3%
    MT Related:         3%
    CT Related:         3%
    Generic to all:     10%
    Admin:              10%
    Other:              1%

Right now, about 50% of the traffic (not all of the first two catagories) is
being cross posted.  If the lists are used like they should be, only the
Generic and Admin should be cross posted.

Personally, I like the idea of one list -- it makes my life easier.  But I
am not objectionable to more either.  However, we don\'t know what T4 will
look like.  When TNE came out it alienated a bunch of people.  When T4 comes
out it could: a) Tick off the CT/MT crowd again, b) Tick off the TNE crowd,
or c) make the world a happy place (which is the one I am cheering for).  At
the point that T4 comes out, we may want to create a TNE refuge, just like
we did for Xboat.  But it doesn\'t change the Traveller Charter, which is to
discuss Traveller regardless of version.

So in the mean time, until T4 comes out, I don\'t want to make any changes,
but the level of cross posting is out of control, so I am reminding people
of the charters of both lists.  My recommendation is instead of combining
the lists, limit MMT to one to reduce the large amounts of cross posts and
let the lists do their thing and serve their charters.

Well, first of all, the immediate thing that you probably wouldn\'t know
about the Aslan sans Alien module is the gender division.

Aslan females outnumber Aslan males about 3 to 1.

The females take on a variety of non-combat roles - including all
medical, financial, technical, technical support, educational,
etc, etc, issues.

Aslan males deal almost excusively with leadership, politics and
warfare. According to the skill slisted, Aslan males are
unable to deal with even simple concepts like _money_ without
having a special skill to do so.

The Aslan will often ignore a non-Aslan\'s true gender and refer
to a being using a gender selected on the basis of that being\'s
job or skill set. E.g. a ship\'s captain will always be refered
to with male pronouns, a ship\'s doctor or engineer will always have
female pronouns used for them. This faux pas is probably more common
among males than females, as females get educated at least.

This is very unlike the Klingons, who are all ass-kicking
types apparently. Also, Klingons seem to have a more 
"human" sex ratio - men do everything, with the occassional
female character so the producers can throw a pair of breasts
onscreen. (ST and all its offspring still have the most awful
females roles.)

Isn\'t this what both the Aslan and the Vargr serve to do in Traveller? ;)

Yes, this is fairly Aslan.

I think the idea is that there\'s a big battle for control of the Klingon
race... this is actually not unlike the Aslan, where there are
various competing clans, who fight not only outsiders (Imperium/.
Solomani) but each other. There are distinct, clear clan lines
that can be drawn for the Aslan however, unlike the Vargr, who,from
a human perspective, seem to fight with anyone.

I think the Aslan are motivated somewhat by the Kzin (Kzinti?)
of Larry Niven\'s "Known Space" universe.

If I was to risk being a cynic, I\'d also note that both the Aslan
and the Vargr suffer badly from the "humans in rubber suits"
syndrome. The K\'kree are a bit better, then the Droyne and the
Hivers are probably the most alien aliens. Though none of
the Traveller aliens could be described as "bad head jobs"
(well, not much).

Only if you are playing them as humans in furry suits, which is the 
way Star Trek portrayed the Klingons, for the most part...  :-)

I\'ve used Vargr and Aslan in my campaigns on quite a few occasions.  
As I run them, they have very clearly defined motives which go beyond 
opposing the players.  They just may not be motives as humans would 
define them...

Actually, the K\'kree are probably the least human of all the aliens 
in Traveller.  The thought of killing a sentient lifeform because 
they MIGHT be a threat, is difficult for me to comprehend.

Your point is taken about the rubber suit syndrome.  But hey, what\'s 
a space opera without a few humans in funny suits... ;-)

  I haven\'t noticed any lack of CT/MT talk on the TML.  The Traveller list

Yes, I\'m aware of that rule in 2300, however flitting around orbit for
almost 2 days matching orbits isn\'t a viable option in most
Travellerisk games.  I could stick a Grav drive on the ship for real
velocity change near planets, but there are problems having
stutterwarp and grav drives powerful enough to match orbital
velocities in the same game. Still thinking about it...

When you think about it because of the way stutterwarp works.  Micro 
jumps.  Could you not simply accumulate momentum in a forward direction 
then as the ship is jumping turn it slightly the momentum would still be 
in a forward direction (as far as the ships concerned) then you just have 
to match velocities with the planet drive around it and come at it from 
the right angle.  THis is similar to what was mentioned before but 
faster.

Land ship, offload cargo, load cargo, go to orbit, engage stutterwarp 
with orbital velocity entact, adjust velocity to match new planet, arrive 
new planet, land etc.

   I do NOT agree.

   The division of the lists exists for a reason. The solution is to
   convince people to stop cross-posting.

   Is there really any reason to post QSDS designs in all three mailing
   lists? Pick ONE list and mail to it - anyone who gets annoyed at
   multiple posters PLEASE send the offending parties mail, I\'ll start
   doing the same. Hopefully things will calm down and mailing list
   volume will drop to sane levels.

   Actually, I\'d like to propose a list called "Continuing Threads",
   that way threads that are beating the horse to death can continue
   without annoying too many people. To make this work, all we need
   is a little cooperation.

   *THINK* before you crosspost.

I assume that during the Civil War, venality figured as much as power-lust
in many, if not most, of the attempts to seize the throne.  As rich as
admirals no doubt were, the wealth controlled by the Imperial family would
be orders of magnitude greater, and thus tempting.  The ability to raid the
treasury to finance repair, upgrading, and additions to the
Admiral/Emperor\'s fleet would also have some appeal.  In addition, while
probably all of the admirals involved were nobles, the power of the emperor
was orders of magnitude greater -- including the ability to make new nobles
- -- and also tempting.  

Other than during that period, however, I think Stu is right that the
emperors never wanted for money (for themselves or their families).  Raiding
the treasury was probably unnecessary.

No, they acted like any superpower, trying to get non-aligned worlds to join
their empire by whatever means.  For example, in The Trouble with Tribbles,
they poison the quadrotriticale to cause a famine on contested worlds that
only they will be able to help.  In A Dirty Little War, they\'re slowly
increasing the tech level of the lowlanders so that they\'ll come to dominate
the highlanders, and will join the Klingon Empire.  
You\'re correct that their personal motivations were never explored, which
was one of the shortcomings of the series.

You\'ll have to decide if these fit the tech level, but off the top of
my head:

o	mass-spectrographic analyzer
o	various "scanners" for examining objects and surfaces at high
	resolution and various wavelengths
o	possibly nanotech "ants" that search for traces of hair, skin,
	fiber, oils, etc under the control of the cpu in the kit


Basicly, you set the thing down, describe the area to search (room,
structure, area of ground) and it sends out the "ants", to look for
anything that might bear checking out. They record the location of
anything small enough to carry and bring it back for analysis. Larger
objects are either called to the attention of the investigator or
carried by multiple "ants".

So the tiniest drop of blood or strand of hair will be found, and a DNA
analysis run, giving you a rough picture of the person. Sure, you\'ll
get *lots* of data, but so what? As with fingerprints now, you\'ll get
samples from the people known to have been in the area, and try to
track down the unknowns.

Of course, *professional* criminals will have similar kits to "tidy up"
the scene. :-)

Luckily, professionals are rare.

No, more like the Hani in C. J. Cherryh\'s "Pride of Chanur", the Chanur
Trilogy, and the latest book (I can\'t recall the title).

Try reading some Cherryh! Hani are *not* human, though comprehensible
without too much trouble. The Sstho are weird. The Mahendosat are odd,
the Kif are *really* weird (by the end of the trilogy I could managed
to (sort of) comprehend the Kif worldview. That was *scary*). Then
there\'s the K\'nnn and the T\'caa which are just plain *alien*. 

She has a few other alien races floating around too, but these are the
ones she\'s written the most about. She also has some *human* cultures
that are different enough to make Zhodani, Vilani and Solomani look
like brothers.

Actually, since I work nights, I get to see very little of it.  Our

No, I haven\'t seen DS9\'s finale...

Personal motivations was what I was talking about...  Your points are 
valid as well...

IMHO, even though people wax nostalgic about the original serious, 
the successor series have had a lot more meat on their bones in terms 
of true science fiction...

But, I still like the original series, anyways...

Well, in that case, this is my last post to Xboat. I will be joining the
Traveller list, not for TNE info, but for T4 info, since I am interested in that
as well and have already ordered an advance copy, and it seems clear
that this is not the place to discuss it.

Sounds like many of you are also subscribed to Traveller. If so, see you

I hadn\'t considered this but on reflection you\'re right.  Is
this because they\'re a dynamic, \'evolving\' (not in a
Darwinian sense) race or because they hadn\'t been thought out
well enough to begin with?

One of the (many) things I liked about early Traveller was
the work done on the aliens.  From the first (Aslan as it
happens) alien module, a lot of thought and detail went into
making them.  (Which reminds me, was the name \'aslan\' a
tribute to C.S. Lewis or did he get the word from somewhere
else yet?)  I still think the two MegaT alien volumes are
incredible pieces of work.

I seem to remember a David Gerrold book letting us know they
flatulated in air-locks!  (I think this was demonstrate how
*really* nasty they were.)

But given Classic Trek was ahead of its time anyway, it\'s a
bit much to expect super-detailed aliens right off.  (Though
one would have thought they could have improved over three
years worth of series)

This is certainly what I was imagining was similar to the
Aslan.

I see what you mean. I hadn\'t considered that maybe other
races would have their Star Trek comparisons too!  (though I
don\'t recall seeing anything hiver like - unless you count Q
manipulating!)

Surely the idea that they are \'humans in rubber suits\' only
comes about if they\'re not being role played well.  With all
the background, history and culture developed for T (starting
with the Alien modules), there has long been the opportunity
to have \'alien\' aliens.  As for looking humanish, I thought
that was why the whole thing with the Ancients was brought in
- - to provide a rationale for that.

At least they\'re not as \'samey\' as Star Trek TNG aliens which
simply seem to involve lumps of make up here and there.  (Was
that Ethan was referring to as \'bad head jobs\'?)

Many thanks for the tip on someone who sounds well worth
checking out.  For all the rubbish in my attic I don\'t think
I have any of her books.  I\'ll keep my eyes peeled.

The power consumption for thrust-plate maneuver drives was wrong.  It should

using 1Mw per displacement ton of drive - too low by a factor of 14.

I\'d have to say that the 2 races that are most unique in the game are 
probably the K\'kree & the Hivers...  I haven\'t seen anything similar 
to them in the SF I\'ve read, but maybe I just haven\'t read the right 
books...

Actually I don\'t beleive they refference the origin of the name Aslan.  
Though the Aslan themselves have a different name for themselves.  The 
humans refer to them as Aslan, for reasons they don\'t fully comprehend.

You\'ll have to decide if these fit the tech level, but off the top of
my head:

o     mass-spectrographic analyzer
o     various "scanners" for examining objects and surfaces at high
     resolution and various wavelengths
o     possibly nanotech "ants" that search for traces of hair, skin,
     fiber, oils, etc under the control of the cpu in the kit


Basicly, you set the thing down, describe the area to search (room,
structure, area of ground) and it sends out the "ants", to look for
anything that might bear checking out. They record the location of
anything small enough to carry and bring it back for analysis. Larger
objects are either called to the attention of the investigator or
carried by multiple "ants".

So the tiniest drop of blood or strand of hair will be found, and a DNA
analysis run, giving you a rough picture of the person. Sure, you\'ll
get *lots* of data, but so what? As with fingerprints now, you\'ll get
samples from the people known to have been in the area, and try to
track down the unknowns.

Of course, *professional* criminals will have similar kits to "tidy up"
the scene. :-)

Luckily, professionals are rare.

Well, the \'rubber suit\' comment comes from the fact that
morphologically (ie. shape-wise) they\'re far too similar
to humans. It\'s a bit more realistic (did I really say that?)
too have aliens that are a bit less human.

The Ancients do explain the Vargr, but the Aslan, well, they\'re
just lucky I guess. Though, the coyns had pictures of the
Aslan _before_ they went to the stars, didn\'t they? Hmmm...

I wonder if there are any alien races in Traveller that reflect

racial wars, etc...?

The Answer:

Actually, I asked this same question a year or two ago, and the response
from Loren K Wiseman was that yes, that is indeed where the name for the
Aslan came from. I\'ve got the mail backed up on a floppy somewhere if you
want more substantial proof :)

I wonder if Marc could help us out here as I\'ve long thought
that \'Aslan\' was a name coined by C.S.Lewis for his Narnia
books.  If he took the word from prior source I\'d be
interested to know.

As he (Lewis, not MWM ASFAIK!) and Tolkien knew each other,
the whole \'world\' of old european languages (and probably more)
may have been available to him.

I\'ll second that!  Although I am not a fan of \'official\' background
I realy did enjoy the first few Alien Modules.  With the exception
that is of both the Zhodani module and that horrid hatchet job
on the Droyne.

I assume that during the Civil War, venality figured as much as power-lust
in many, if not most, of the attempts to seize the throne.  As rich as
admirals no doubt were, the wealth controlled by the Imperial family would
be orders of magnitude greater, and thus tempting.  The ability to raid the
treasury to finance repair, upgrading, and additions to the
Admiral/Emperor\'s fleet would also have some appeal.  In addition, while
probably all of the admirals involved were nobles, the power of the emperor
was orders of magnitude greater -- including the ability to make new nobles
- -- and also tempting.

Other than during that period, however, I think Stu is right that the
emperors never wanted for money (for themselves or their families).  Raidin=

the treasury was probably unnecessary.

While I\'m all for having really \'alien\' aliens, I would have
thought that in Traveller (and Star Trek for that matter)
human\'ish\' aliens were almost a prerequisite for having
conflict/interaction/role playing possibilities.  (After all,
an \'energy blob\' might just about make an NPC but is possibly
not going to be the height of fun for a PC.  (Though I stand
to be corrected.)

It seems to me that if we did reach the stars and find it
well populated, we would be more likely to have on-going
dealings with the more \'human\' aliens.  Anyone care to argue
that the K\'Kree and Hivers are on the limit of being
reasonably \'playable\'?

I thought someone mentioned the coyns might have been faked
(or added to by Grandfather at a later date) - can\'t say this
is a speciality of mine though so I may be wrong.

>"Another new alien race? Hm, we\'ve used pointy ears, pointy
>noses, and pointy cheeks, how about big cone shaped heads?"

You\'d have thought it would be cheaper to concentrate on the
alieness of their societies rather than bodies (considering
that they\'ve got to played by Earthling actors).  But even
their societies often seemed to be simply means for
portraying some particular aspect of (American) culture.

Sorry, I wasn\'t here all that time ago! (Work only got e-mail
about a year ago and it took me some time to find you guys!)

Don\'t worry about the \'proof\', I\'m quite content to believe
that LKW took the name from C.S. Lewis.  However, I checked
my Turkish dictionary this morning to discover that \'aslan\'
is in  fact the Turkish for \'lion\'.  So, I assume that Lewis
got *his* idea from this.

(I take no credit for finding this out, someone e-mailed me
direct with this suggestion which made me check my dictionary
collection.  As s/he may wish to remain anonymous for
whatever reason, I won\'t embarass them - but thanks!).

Hell, many aliens (and *most* players) are not just "humans in funny
suits". They are "contemporary Western Culture humans in funny suits".

I\'ve seen enough "role-players" who couldn\'t even take into account the
way that *humans* from a different culture react differently, to say
nothing of considering *alien* motivations. As an example, an idiot
who got in an argument with a "samurai" type character over some action
the group was taking. The idiot was about to state the the "samurai\'s"
word wasn\'t good enough when he *literally* got tackled by the less
idiotic types. This guy would probably offer a K\'kree a hamburger...

Players who *can* handle different cultures manage to handle aliens
moderately well. But they are rare. <sigh>

Gordon Dickson has written some books that have aliens who are truly
alien. That is, they are logical, reasonable beings. But the very basis
of their thought/culture is quite different. In one case, the main
difference between us and them was that our culture is "based" on
"rightness". That is, a thing is good or bad depending on how "right"
it is. For the aliens, it was "respectable/not respectable" or at least
that\'s the closest humans could come to the concept. Not that this is
*not* "honor" it\'s something more than a little different. And unless
you could keep it in mind *all* the time, the aliens would keep doing
the unexpected.

Then of course, we have C.J. Cherryh. I\'d *love* to see what\'d happen
if you placed her "Compact" just the other side of the K\'kree and
Hivers. K\'kree trying to deal with Kif would be fun. And Sshto and
mahendosat trying to deal with Hivers (and vice versa) would be almost
as good.

Aslan was lifted from C S Lewis as a descriptor of a feline / lionoid race. I
used the term at GDW for some time prior to inserting it in Traveller. ASAIK,
published material in Traveller have always said "No one knows how this name
came to be applied to the "Aslan"."

I agree that it\'s a realistic explanation.  We don\'t have much direct
canonical evidence for it.  There are occasional references to entire
planets held as reserves by wealthy families, and the Imperial family owns
significant stakes in the biggest megacorporations (which in itself makes
them wealthier than any other individuals).

The easiest solution (and one that involves no change to existing QSDS designs)
is to note that QSDS power plants contain fuel for only 6 months, not 1 year.

Since starships will ordinarily refuel after every jump, the duration is not
expected to be a major concern.  Designers should install twice the listed
amount of fuel if they require an unrefuelled duration of a year.

Can I just apologize to xboat readers for managing to repost

While we\'re back on the subject, can I suggest Psicology
rather than Psionicology?  It may be too late but I\'d vote
for this for two reasons:

a) it\'s a nice subtle distinction between it and psychology
       (indeed the pronounciation is the same which might
make for interesting misunderstanding as well endless
possibilities for (supressed) psionics to confuse issues).


b) it\'s much less of a mouthful

Ok, here\'s a bit more info on the sort of thing I like to use for
my MT character generation; sorry I took so long, I didn\'t bring my
Traveller stuff to the hospital. <green-faced>

The Single-roll career generation:
==================================
Instead of rolling separately for survival, commission, promotion and
special duty, I find it faster to use a single roll with the
results indicating wether this was a good or bad term.  It removes a
bit of generation details on the one hand (for example, you can\'t
have
both a commission and a promotion in the same term, but on the 
average the number of skills should be about equivalent.  I haven\'t
done the maths to prove it though)  but it can add a lot more details
on the other hand.

The base roll is 7 for ALL careers.  I picked that because it seems
to
be a fairly good average of all the other rolls for all the careers.
It might seem like it removes the danger from taking the more
daunting
careers but in fact, what matters are the DM\'s applied to the dice
roll.
Here they are:
Career          DM+1 for each of
Navy            Edu 8+,Int 7+,Soc 9+
Marines         Edu 7+,End 8+,Soc 8+
Army            Dex 7+,Edu 7+,End 8+
Scouts          Str 8+,End 9+,Int 6+
Flyer           Dex 7+,Edu 6+,End 7+
Sailor          Edu 6+,End 6+,Int 7+
Law Enf         Edu 7+,Int 7+,Dex10+
Doctor          Dex 8+,Int 7+
Diplomat        Edu 8+,Int 6+,Soc 9+
Bureau          Edu 6+,Int 6+,Soc 5+
Scientist       Int 7+,Edu 7+
Noble           Edu 9+,Int 10+
Merchant        Str 6+,Int 6+
Belter          +1 per term
Pirate          Str 9+,Int 8+,Soc 7+
Rogue           End 7+,Int 9+,Soc 8+
Hunter          Str 7+,Dex 7+,End 7+
Barbarian       Str 7+,End9+,Int 6+

The roll of the dice determines how good/bad your term was.
(Roll+DM)-(Base+Setbacks)       Result
- -3                              Major Setback (counts as two)
- -1                              Minor Setback
0                               Survives and reenlists
+1                              Special Duty (+1 skill)
+2                              Promotion    (+2 skill)
+3                              Special Duty (+3 skill)
+4                              Comission    (+4 skill)

Where Roll is your dice roll, DM is the DMs above, Base = 7 and
Setbacks is the total number of setbacks this character has had.

When 12+DM < Base+Setbacks, then your character MUST quit active
duty.

When you roll a +2, your character receives BOTH a promotion and a 
special duty.
On a +4, only a Commission is received.

Term Effects: (added to improve role-playing depth)
=============
When you\'ve determined what kind of term you got, you must choose
from the following tables what exactly happened:        (note, these
aren\'t complete! :) 
Never pick the same result twice. 
Retirement is only possible if you had a positive result on this
term.

Major Setback: (things that happened to you. These are very BIG
screw-ups,
that go beyond simple career effects, and should be part of the
adventures/background/etc).  
So as to avoid heaping too much trouble on the PC (it would be
unrealistic) the referee can decided to change further Major Setbacks
to either Demotion, Forced Retirement or something appropriate.
The point is to convince the PC to quit while he\'s ahead. :) 
1- PC dies: PC is a clone, or has had a stroke, brain damage, etc.
2- PC screws up on a galactic scale: Might lead to 1, as she\'s made
        a major ennemy.
3- Excommunicated: You did something that really pissed the
Intemporeal.
        (ex: Mentally undressing a Zhodani Woman in a Zhodani church
:)
4- Racial group victim of genocide: You had to drop everything and
escape.
5- Comitted a crime.
6- Became allergic to your homeworld environment.
7- PC crashed a ship on a major urban center.
8 - PC part of a Scandal involving members of the Moot and a group
of, mh,
   \'entertainment\' androids. 
9- The PC\'s whole family dies.

Minor Setbacks: Things that happened to your career and affected
no one else.
1 - Wounded; Reduce one stat by 1, unless PC has enough money at the
end
    to pay for a repair job, cybernetics/cloning/etc at homeworld TL.
2 - Demoted:  Lose a rank
3 - Chased out of office, no more promotion until Commission rolled
again.
4 - Routine: No more special duty until Promotion/Commission.
5 - War: You get drafted into military service.
6 - Bad investment: Lose benefits for this term.
etc etc.

Promotions REDUCE Setbacks by 1 (minimum 0).
Commissions CLEAR all setbacks.

Special Duties are treated like the Service Skills in MT advanced
character generation.
Each career gets his list of services.  Roll the service the PC gets
enrolled into.  Then consult THAT Service\'s skill table, and let
the player PICK the skill in that table.
The rationale is that you might not be able to choose where you end
up (unless you volunteer :), but once you\'re there, you try your best
to retain the skills you were interested in.

Anyways - obviously that\'s not a complete system but I find it
interesting
and fairly well-balanced.  It gives the player the chance to have
some control over the direction the character is taking, and adds a 
layer to the role-playing background.
I see this as a middle ground between point-based systems and
completely
random systems.  Random systems should be ancient history - they
don\'t
really let the character evolve in your mind as you\'re creating it,
so you end up playing a character that might be cool, if you\'re lucky
or which you might not like at all.  Anyways. :)

Here\'s a few generation traces:
===============================
Underdog 444444,Average Joe 666666,GI Joe, 888888
The characters keep going till they can\'t possibly do anything good
anymore, which isn\'t exactly how things go during normal generation.

In the Navy:
The first number is the dice roll, the 2nd is the DM, the third is
the base (7) and the 4th is the setbacks.
Underdog:  Final score: 6 terms (he could have quit before)
                     7 skills. (reasonable, especially since even
losers
                     as supposed to be VIP\'s in Traveller).
                      2 setbacks, 2 major setbacks.
                                           
Average Joe:  Total: 3 terms, 6 skills. 2 major setbacks.

Gi Joe:  Total: 13 terms (70 years old), 4th rank, 26 skills (more
than
                HIS maximum.  Not taking into account the aging
                process. 1 minor, 3 major setbacks (by stretching
things)

Three Joes as Diplomats:
Underdog Joe: 
       total: 4 terms, 6 skills.  Pretty good. 3 major setbacks
(stretching)
       
Average Joe: 
            Total: 3 terms, 4 skills.  Poor guy. 3 major setbacks.
            
GI Joe: 
       total: 5 terms, 9 skills.  Not very good. 2 major setbacks.

Three barbarians:
Under: 
      Total: 3 terms, 6 skills. 2 major setbacks.
      
Average: 
        Total: 10 terms (not bad for a barbarian!), 19 skills.
                2 minor, 1 major setback.
                
Conan: 
       Total: 12 terms, 30 skills!!! 1 minor setback, 3 major
setbacks.


The morale is, don\'t get into a career you\'re not suited for, cuz
you\'ll
screw up before you\'re 30!


Real Example:
===============
Now we\'ll see how the system helps us be creative, and is really a 
lot faster than having to roll 4 times for everything.

Vacc Suit-1, Electronics-1, Computer-1, Engineering-1,
Ship\'s Boat-1, Tactics-1

Steroi, an opportunistic, boisterous man, hoped to make a quick buck
selling inferior goods to inferior minds.  It didn\'t go as easily as
he\'d hoped.  Eventually, his bad trading habits came back and bit
him hard - he was sold inferior replacement parts for the ship he
was serving on, which misjumped into a Red Zone system.  Out of this
event, he made 3 major ennemies - the folks he\'d double-crossed and
who\'d quadruple-crossed him, the local Imperial Noble who had not
recommended a Red Zoning for nothing, and the Ship\'s Captain
because they had to abandon ship, and took the ship\'s boat back to
the
local noble\'s place, for evacuation.  

Massive and lumbering about slowly, he has become more tolerant of
others as he ages.  However he\'s been planning to get back to 
his ennemies, and been studying ways to do it in secret.


Anyways, I hope you like it.  Please comment/etc as I\'m sure you
will.  The results are probably very skewered, in the sense that
it\'s easy to make a total failure or a killer-char, so if you notice
it and think of a fix, let me know. :)
There are a few scenarios that aren\'t possible anymore (say, get
a promotion and then be thrown out) but usually that\'s for the
best (why promote someone if you\'re going to fire him?)

1) Vague and ambiguous:  Writing in what language?  from how long before the
Long Night? just before?

2) How intelligible without applying translation software?  By TL 12 (I
think that\'s Milieu 0), known languages will all be freely translatable by
computers; written forms will be the easiest because most consistent.  So if
the adventurers are in communication with a starship, or if they have a
computer with translation software with that language with them, they will
be able to read it as easily as their native language (which I assume is a
Sylean dialect of English). 

3) While the advent of general literacy has slowed the evolution of language
(at least of grammar; vocabulary changes constantly), the complete
dissemination of audiovisual recording equipment and records, in a culture
that relies on them constantly, will bring such evolution to a near
standstill.  

Between 2 and 3, if the pre-Long Night writing is English, the PCs will have
a pretty easy time reading it.

I don\'t recall seeing that, but the Imperial family does have

My advice is to quit playing silly language games and call the field
"Psionics". That\'s the *standard* meaning of the term (c.v
"electronics", "avionics", "gravitics", "physics", etc)

Psionics: (n) sy-on-ix.

Rob,

I\'m forwarding this to the lists not to increase bandwidth usage, but 
because I think it is important that others see your message and my reply.

First, let me say that I have not been inflexible in the amount of 
quoting I do.  When I saw the first post in XTML that complained about 
the amount of quoting, I began paying more attention to that.  While I 
may have occasionally slipped since then (I\'ve been on-line 
for many years, and old habits die hard), I feel I\'ve done a good job of 
keeping the quoting to that necessary to allow everyone - even those who 
haven\'t seen the original post (for instance, new subscribers, those 
who have been away on holiday, or those who simply, for whatever reason, 
didn\'t read the message I am replying to) - to follow the conversation.  

When I originally subscribed to these lists, I posted many of my house 
rules in Xboat, as you may recall if you subscribed at that time.  I have 
also tried to contribute meaningfully to the conversations ongoing.    
But, I noted that there were increasing complaints from some XMLers 
regarding the level of cross-posting and the number of lines quoted, so 
I stopped posting to XTML for the most part.  All of my new material 
appears only on TML.  

Since I want to have the widest possible audience for my contributions, 
it makes the most sense to post to the "all games welcome here" TML 
rather than the splinter-sect "Only CT and MT" XTML - even though I\'m 
primarily a CT referee.  

Now that I\'ve received your email complaint regarding the amount of 
quoting I do on TML, I\'m beginning to wonder whether posting to these 
lists is worth it at all.  Who needs to hear the numerous complaints 
about wasted bandwidth, when I\'m spending my free time trying to join in 
with the many other great people here who are enhancing the Traveller 
experience?  It\'s not like I quote entire posts and add only "yeah, I 
agree."  Every time I post, I try to add something meaningful to the 
discussion.  I may or may not succeed, depending on your perspective, but 
that is always my attempt.

I have been on-line for many years, and have developed a style of 
posting that I think conveys the most information in the best method.  
Others feel differently, and that\'s OK.  But I do not believe in the 
theory that X lines of quoting is going to work every time...no matter 
what number you substitute for X.  Some say 2 lines, and others would 
rather see no quoting.  I try to quote enough so that anyone coming into 
the conversation without having access to older posts will be able to 
follow the conversation.  I do this because I believe what we discuss 
here is that important.  

I admit that the current humor thread has perhaps too much quoting, but I 
took that as a part of the humor of the situation.  That thread is a 
parody of all the arguments we\'ve had recently, and I\'m enjoying it.  The 
fact that it\'s gotten to seven or so levels of quoting is part of the 
humor precisely because of people such as yourself who have posted to the 
lists asking for less quoting - another type of flame, which is being 
parodied.

If I\'ve been out of line in my quoting style because the mailing list 
culture is different from usenet and BBS culture, then I apologize.  If 
the people who contribute to this list feel that is the case, then I will 
change my ways.

Quoth Jamie Young:

> zone be like?

Much more temperate than Earth\'s.  With no mountain ranges or thermally-
active coastline barriers, the atmosphere would form just two convective
Hadley cells rather than the multitude that Earth has.  Water is also a
wonderful leveller of temperature variations: in past geologic eras on
Earth, the continental arragements that have allowed the greatest oceanic
circulation both north-south and east-west have tended to foster the most
consistent and idyllic climates.

No: Jupiter gets those bands because of its horrific rotation rate. I\'m
unsure whether they\'ve yet decided (perhaps Galileo will help?) whether
the ?solid? body of Jupiter rotates faster than does its atmosphere.

> Would the oceanographic/atmospheric interaction be unstable
> leading to global ice-ages?

I\'m not sure what you mean by this.  Could you elaborate?

> How would the climate differ between two

The shallow one\'s climate is likely to vary more, as subsurface mountain
ranges, volcanoes, etc. will have a greater effect on global circulation
patterns.  So you\'d possibly get significant regional variations (like
ice caps).

> I understand that photdisassociation of atmospheric water would give

Free oxygen is pretty durn reactive stuff.  I suspect much of it would
come out of the atmosphere to be dissolved in the world-ocean, which it
would in turn depart to oxidize seafloor mineral outcroppings.  You
wouldn\'t get a significant fraction of atmospheric oxygen unless and until
life arose.  As for the end ratio.... the main brake on our current level
of atmospheric oxygen is the danger of fire at high levels, but that
wouldn\'t be as much of a danger on a waterworld, so perhaps it would hit
the upper 20%\'s?  (That\'s a hand-waving guess).

They\'d form latitudinal bands like *Earth*. That\'s what the tradewinds
are. Ditto for the "doldrums".

You\'d also get some mondo storms, because tropical cyclones (hurricanes
& typhoons) wouldn\'t ever run into land masses. They\'d only die out
when they hit *really* cold water.

Hmmm. Good question.

Not sure. I think that what you need to worry about is what the ocean
currents look like, which depends a lot on the sub-surface topography.

> I understand that photdisassociation of atmospheric water would give

> of the resulting atmosphere would be oxygen?

Depends on the starting composition of the planet, among other things.
You\'ll have some nitrogen and inert gases there. The amount of oxygen
depends on how much is left over after oxidizing everything it can get
at. 

In an extreme case you can have enough oxygen to make the place a fire
hazard. But that requires starting with *lots* of water.

Pierre-Louis Constantin has developed what appears to be a very workable 
system.  I rolled up a few test characters using it, and found that it 
worked well.  One of its strong points is that it encourages more 
imagination on the part of the referee and player when generating a 
character.  Having to come up with Major and Minor Setbacks, as well as 
Special Duties, is a good spur to creativity.

When I was rolling up those characters, it made me be a bit less likely 
to go for "one more term" in the hopes of finally getting that last 
promotion.  If you stop getting promotions, the negative DM\'s start 
piling up and you realize you\'d better quit while you\'re ahead.  I like 
that. 

Pierre, in your write-up you mentioned that it wasn\'t complete.  If you 
ever get the chance, it\'d be great if you would write up the complete 
system and share it with us.

Thanks for posting it!

I\'m no eco-scientist, but the first thing I thought of when I saw
this question was the carbon-cycle which tends to regulate temperature
on Earth. The general idea, and somebody with more schooling can feel
free to correct me if I get it wrong, is that carbon-dioxide plays a
huge role in determining how much heat your atmosphere retains. The more
CO2 is the air, the more heat is retained. The cycle works as follows:

1. CO2 is on the upswing, the atmosphere is heating up, which causes the
   weather system to accelerate, meaning more rain, which washes the
   CO2 back into the soil where it gets stuck for millions of years in
   the form of various carbonates, meaning that your planet cools off
   again.

2. CO2 is on the downswing, so the atmosphere cools down and the
   whether patterns slow down. Fortunately, since Earth is geologically
   active, some volcano erupts somewhere and spews out lots of CO2,
   and so the planet gets to heat up again.

Now, it gets a lot more complex than this, but for a thumbnail sketch,
this is my understanding of how Earth stays at roughly the same temperature
year after year. #2 is a constant pressure, and #1 is the opposite pressure
which due to the weather system tends to perfectly offset #2. The problem
with a water world, of course, is that #2, the constant pressure of
volcanos spewing millions of tons of CO2, is pretty much non-existant
as far as I can tell. I suppose they could be spewing CO2 from underwater,
and that it could rise to the surface in the form of bubbles, but I
wonder what percentage would be captured by the water on the way up, or
trapped under ice assuming the world went into an ice age? Another question
to consider: Without a freestanding soil, would the #1 effect, the washing
down of CO2 and trapping it various carbonates, be able to occur? If so,
as what rate as compared with a terranorm world?

Any chemists/environmentalists want to take a stab at this?

Earth\'s oceans are already our largest CO2 reservoir, holding far more 
than the atmosphere.  In fact, one of the big questions in greenhouse
warming is just how much more CO2 might dissolve in the oceans at 
equilibrium rather than stay in the atmosphere.  So, yes, underwater
volanoes would contribute to atmospheric CO2: their effect would just
be muted/slowed by the need for gas diffusion through the oceans.

Again, dissolved CO2 might have a similar effect on seafloor deposits 
(especially new and unoxidized minerals flung from the aforesaid volcanoes).
But the need for diffusion through the ocean again slows the process down:
the waterworld might be vulnerable to wide temperature swings before its
slower feedback process brings the climate back under control.

I don\'t have a modula-2 compiler, so I didn\'t speak up.  I\'d *really*

The albedo of the WaterWorld would be higher than Earth\'s, leading to a
reduced surface temperature, but water is a greenhouse gas leading to
increased surface temperature.  I wondered if one of these effects would
dominate so much that either a global ice age or a global sauna (or even a
runaway greenhouse) would develop.

Ice Caps: I read somewhere recently that if global warming occurs as
predicted the arctic ice cap of earth may become a seasonal feature.

Ya but if a starship has a particularly nasty name, "Relentless, etc."  
It makes the characters want to get away all that much more.  Plus, if 
keep having them run into "Relentless, whatever" it builds a mystique

HI Time to De-Lurk (Turn off Shadow Ship Cloaking Field)  (
shhhsshhshsskkkkk)

	To be honest, in Great Science Fiction books and Shows, StarShip 
names give an Air of completeness to the universe, All our present day 
Carriers, BattleShips, Cruises, Destroyers have names, as do most private 
craft.  For those of you who Watch Babylon 5, would it be as interesting as 
it is, with out this completeness?  Tink about some of the names, Hmm 
General Haig, commanded the Alexander (Double meaning for that ship, Named 
after Alexander the Great, And Alexander Haig?)  There is the Space Liner 
Asimov, and The deepspace Explorer Cortez.... All of these ships have 
special meaning behind thier names, and when you hear them mentioned in the 
Show, an image pops immediately to mind.  This is the same sort of Fullness 
naming your ships in the game can give to your roleplaying experience.  
Just think about it.  This is the making of a much richer game if you try 
to do little things like this.

Just My humble Opinion.

ago."

"Really, what\'d he do?"

"Nobody\'s really sure anymore."

While its a nice honor to have a ship named after you most people do not 
have names that sound "heroic" enough or have a really good mythos 
involved with their creation.

Here\'s a couple of names I\'ve used in my campaign

Artemis
Dyonitia
Athena
Aries
Hecate
etc.

Any God\'s name, with a few possible exceptions makes a good ships name.  
If the people know what the god stood for they can generally work out the 
ships purpose.

Ishtar:  Is a good name, unfortunately some fool in Hollywood made a 
totally crappy movie with the same title, forever ruining the name for 
the rest of us.

Large Imperial Vessels I generally give formidable sounding names.  
Something that strikes fear in the heart of god generally works well.

Vengence
Formidable
Victorious
Relentless
Intrepid
Triumphant
etc.

Thou these make more Solomani sounding names they\'ve got that edge that 
makes players think that something is bound to go wrong.  Merchant ships 
are probably the easiest ships to name.  Just about any name will do.

Drop Dead Red
Void Runner
Astral Waters
Silent Explorer
Ted\'s Ship
etc.

I don\'t know maybe I put to much thought into it but runnig into the same 
ship several times tends to build a sence of comaradarie.

"You slide into port there\'s (roll roll roll) two subsidized merchants 
and a far trader in port"

"You slide into port there are three ships in port, a pair os subsidized 
merchants you\'ve never seen before and the "Mistress of the Dark."

You don\'t even have to tell the players what the "Mistress" is if they\'ve 
encountered it twice before they\'ll remember the ship and it\'s crew.

"Say that\'s Captian Rumm\'s ship isn\'t it?  200ton TL-15 far trader."

"Yep, the original puking dog."

I always keep around a list of the starships my players have encountered 
and when I\'m playing I always keep track of the starships I\'ve 
encountered, type, captian and notible features.

It adds a feeling of continuity to the game that\'s often hard to find.

Your answer really depends on your height.  Being a couple inches over six foot 
and more than 250 pounds of strapping manhood (oh lord, that sounds great), I 
find that I can wear a good-sized XL T-shirt, but the things are usually not 
long enough.  To get a decent length, I find myself getting a 2XL, or even a 
3XL as often as not.

Thanks for mentioning the shirts; I\'ll need to get one.

This is a good idea which I, too, have implemented: continuity of 
characters and objects.  Now, some may say, "Gee, what an amazing 
coincidence that we always seem to run into someone we know no matter 
where we go."  Or, as the local movie critic said of Independence Day, 
"It\'s just a little too coincidental that everyone in the movie meets 
everyone else, even though they are spread over two coasts and have 
disparate jobs.  The computer geek who can crack the alien\'s code just 
happens to have a wife who works for the President, who happens to..."  
[quoted from memory, not verbatim]

In my estimation, however, this sort of thing gives the story (be it a 
book, a movie, or a campaign) MORE believability and likeability.  Sure 
it can be overdone.  But in moderation, use of previously known people 
and objects in future adventures is a good idea.  I strive for a sense of 
familiarity in my campaigns.  Not only do the players enjoy it, but that 
makes the truly strange or unfamiliar seem even more so.

I would think that the name of the big navy ship would be very important
intelligence to the PCs.  

>From the deposition of Enli M\'Tavish in SuSAG, LIC v. Porodgram, LIC:

Q:  What happened next at Zircon?

A:  After we finished the job at the SuSAG installation on Zircon, we split
in the Slewfoot. On our way to jump point, SuSAG called the Imperial Navy
ship Revenger -- then orbiting Zircon Prime -- and identified us as wanted
criminals and spies.  

Q:  How did you know that?

A:  SuSAG used a radio, unscrambled.

Q:  Then what happened?

A:  Revenger swung out of orbit and hailed us.  When her sensors locked on
us, we jumped, even though we were risking misjump.  

Q:  Where did you jump?

A:  That jump took us to Gougeste ... 

[deletion]

A:  From Gougeste, we made Emerald, stopping in deep space at 0207/Jewell
midway.  

Q:  What did you do at Emerald?

A:  When we stepped out at Emerald and made contact with the starport, the
first thing we wanted to know was the identities of other ships that had
called there in the last two weeks.  Revenger hadn\'t been there, so we had a
little comfort that we weren\'t known yet.

YAY!  I hated that fact that the old TNE shirts never got any larger than
XL.  My wife is 5\'4" and under 120, and wears a XL (she likes them baggy).
 I am 6\'1", and more than I would care to admit.  I wear a XXL but prefer
a XXXL for length.  I say More power to IG for getting shirts out now.

You do get CO2 from underwater volcanos. It pretty much goes into
solution. *But*, the the concentration of CO2 in the water has to match
that of the atmosphere. This is actually shifted a bit by solubility,
but the basic idea hold. The CO2 content of surface water depends on
the amount in the air, and the temperature of the water. The CO2
content at depth depends on the temperature, and the content of any
adjacent water, modified by how fast CO2 diffuses. 

Given the lack of exposed rock, the carbonate formation would only
happen to exposed rock on the bottom. CO2 makes water acidic, so it
will react with basic rocks, resulting in carbonates. Also, calcium
carbonate is a favored structural material of some life forms, so they
will create it from the calcium dissolved in the water. 

The carbon cycle change more slowly, asnd thus be more capable of
taking large swings if some sudden change happens, but it should still
work out.

Remember that the main reason for the runaway greenhouse on Venus is
the *lack* of water. 

As I recall from discussions of Ice Ages, a water world is less likely
to do this. The reason we have so many is because of all the land in
the northern hemisphere. When the continents are more spread out, we
don\'t get ice ages.

There are two reasons for this. First, when water gets to 4C, it
reaches maximum density and sinks. That causes a circulation pattern
that moves surface waters north (and coriolis forces turn this eats or
west, depending on hemisphere), and deep waters move south. If you do
manage to freeze the surface water, it has to be in a land-locked area
like a lake or the Arctic Ocean. On a water world, you\'d have to get
most of the oceans *volume* to 4C before it could *start* to freeze.

And once the surface freezes, it insulates the deeper whater against
further heat loss. So as long as the equilibrium temp of the planet (as
determined by solar radiation) is above freezing, you\'ll have at least
some open whatever, barring so *really* weird occurences.

Andrew,

In a way, you are right that the rules are, in many ways, part and parcel 
of the Imperial setting.  For example, the oft-cited price fixing for 
cargo and passage rates.  

But, here\'s another look at the issue:

The Traveller set I first purchased was the Deluxe Starter Edition (two 
8-1/2 by 11" booklets, with Adventure 0, Introduction to Traveller, and 
the Spinward Marches map.  We hadn\'t used prepared adventures since the 
D&D days, so I didn\'t actually read Adventure 0 until about 10 years 
later (!).  I don\'t recall reading Intro to.., either.  So, we set about 
playing Traveller using only the core rules.  I made up planets as I went 
along.  There was no "Imperium."  
Then I bought Supplement 3, The Spinward Marches and that gave me data on 
the planets on my map.  But there still wasn\'t an Imperium.
It wasn\'t until a few years later that I had enough Supplements to piece 
together an idea of what the Imperium was like.  Gradually, our campaign 
environment came to resemble the official Traveller universe.

Now, did our play suffer from not using the Imperium?  No, it didn\'t.  As 
a matter of fact, we had other sci-fi games (notably Star Frontiers), and 
we preferred Traveller to Star Frontiers /even though we didn\'t know 
about the official Traveller setting/!  The rules, the clarity, the 
professionalism...these things made Traveller the superior product it was 
for us.

Now, obviously Marc Miller is going in the direction of giving Traveller 
distinct characteristics outside of the rules (ie, the discussion of 
symbols of the Imperium to be used to clearly indicate a given drawing is 
of a Traveller setting).  So, I think the official Traveller setting will 
be even stronger than before.  I think this is a good idea.

But I still hope the rules will be separate from the setting - even if 
only separated into sections of the same book.  That way, people will at 
least have the clear choice of making their own setting.

This is all moot now, though...we\'ll just have to see what the game looks 
like in a month!

Well....not always bad. :)  Depends on your intent.  I think the occasional 
ship named something like "Mr. Happy," "Pattycake," or "The Mortgage 
that Wouldn\'t Die," would be fun. :)

One of the Norse sagas involved a ship called the Nameless.  During
construction, the Viking leader said something to the effect of "Why call a
ship Land Ravager when it is destined never to ravage land?  Let us call it
the Nameless and see what it does.  Then we shall give it a new name when it
has proven itself."

The Viking raid turns out to be a complete disaster, with the men getting
separated from their ship, dying of cold and disease instead of in battle,
and running across northern Europe with their tails between their legs.
Near the end of the book, the leader and a few survivors are running,
exhausted and hungry, from pursuers, and they reach the edge of a cliff
looking over the sea.  There below them, being dashed by the surf onto the
rocks, is the wreckage of the Nameless.  The leader says something like, "I
guess a ship lives up to its name, not the other way around."

I\'ve forgotten the name of the saga, having read it in translation when I
was in junior high about 25 years ago.

Ha! I\'d bet that Vilani generals would all be jockeying to be on the ship
named after the oldest hero in memory - the older, the better! An no self
respecting Vilani crewmember would dare step on board a ship without 
studying the history of the ship and it\'s name first.

Historical value, historical value, historical value!

You know I can see the Viking\'s doing this.  It\'s probably where the 
mystique, changing a ships name is bad luck, came from too.

See the ship knew it was going to have it\'s name changed.  A name is 
everything, it\'s not just a handy little rack to hang your hat on 
it\'s everything when it comes to personality development.

Interestingly enough, in one of the Star Trek novel, the author suggests that
Romulans feel the same way about names. The commander asks Kirk which great
Enterprise the ship is named for. When he replies that it isn\'t for any
specific enterprise, just the spirit, the commander is not surprised that
the ship gets into so much trouble. Call a ship Intrepid, and it will
forget how to fear (especially if you crew it with Vulcans), and get into
trouble.

With this in mind, I\'ve always been tempted to have ships pursuing PCs
called things like \'Relentless\' or \'Eternal Vigilance\'. Pirate ships get
names like \'Going Shopping\' or \'Bargain Hunter\', while PCs end up in
ships with names like \'Trouble, here we come\'.

Do recall that studies have shown that most people in the US are no
more than *5* acquaintances from anyone else. The average is more like
three or four.

In other words, I probably know someone, who knows someone, who knows a
friend of the president.

I\'m going to disagree with you, Andrew! <g>  

It\'s not the background, exactly.  It\'s not the rules, or how the
background and rules work together either.  It\'s the FEEL of the game.

Yeah, but how many of us have developed house rules for this, that,
and the other thing...like price fixing and passage rates.  I bet if
we add up all the house rules, you wouldn\'t recognize the *rules*, but
you would recognize the feel of the game.

Mine was the original Black Box with 3 little black books that never

Having never owned either, I haven\'t either.  <g> Actually, I think

Right! Traveller could be anything you wanted...still can.

When I bought Supplement 3 I\'d never seen a map.  It provided a

developed several star systems by then and just integrated them into
the Spinward Marches.  Those were the days my friend!

Actually, I started seeing it referred to in JTAS, and Book 5 (High
Guard) actually *assumed* some sort of remote centralized government.
I think they were calling it the Imperium even then.

>Traveller universe.

I guess mine did too, but we never got too close to the official
history.  Remember how we all felt when WAR! splashed across the JTAS
cover?  <g> It was very exciting, but my games never got involved in
the 5th Frontier War...and we skipped the rebellion, the civil war,
and the V\'thing in their entirety.

>Now, did our play suffer from not using the Imperium?  No, it didn\'t.
 
Absolutely not!  

I *loved* the Traveller News, went there first in every issue of JTAS
and Challenge, but all that was happening in a different universe.  A
similar universe, with similar technologies and star systems, but
still a different one.

>The rules, the clarity, the  professionalism...these things made

You got that right!  I just turned and look up at my bookshelf saw
GURPS, Aftermath, Space Opera, SpaceMaster, Star Trek and
StarFrontiers all sitting there..along with CT, MT, TNE, TW2K, and
2300AD.  <G> (The rest of my stuff is in another room) They are all
grist for the mill!  

Only Traveller keeps rising to the top.

I do to.  I keep going back to TNE, looking at the rules, and dang it!
There are some really good ideas in there.  It\'s just so *hard* to
find them among all the setting stuff.  

Give me the rules!  I\'ll come up with the setting!  Ok, you can give
me the setting too..just make it easy to separate the two.  <g>

Yeah. "I don\'t know what it is, but I know it when I see it." :)  Being 
unable to put ones finger on what is so great about something you like is 
a rather embarassing situation to be in, but I agree with you.

I didn\'t own the 3 little black books until just a few years ago.  In 
going back and collecting all the CT stuff I missed, I\'ve found it best 
to divide my collection into three sub-collections: one collection of those 
things that I want to preserve, which are never touched (I know, how 
anal!  But I live in fear of someday being without an original copy of 
the Traveller rules, thus the redundancy and care); a collection of things 
that I have only one copy of but which I will go ahead and use (ie, 
Group One items, etc.); and a third collection of items which are used 
without overmuch concern for their condition (essentially, multiple 
copies of the stuff in the first collection, which just happens to 
comprise what I see as the core rules (books 1-8, Supplements 1-13, and 
The Traveller Book)).  
Anyway, the point of saying all that was to show that I use books 1-3 about 
equally as often as The Traveller Book.  Depends on what mood I\'m in, 
strangely enough.

Hmmm.  I don\'t remember it from JTAS.  Might have been Challenge.  Now 
that I\'ve read it, it /is/ a nice piece of work.  I just didn\'t seem to 
need it back when we first started playing.


> Right! Traveller could be anything you wanted...still can.

Yeah.  That\'s just it.  I never had trouble coming up with scenarios for 
Traveller, while in other games I either got into a rut or simply got 
bored and stopped playing.  With thousands of worlds, many alien races 
(some detailed, some less detailed, and still others not even mentioned 
- -- and thus open for your creation!), any tech level you can imagine, and 
everything else available to you, there really is no end to the adventure 
possible with Traveller.  No matter what the size of your Traveller 
collection. :)

I\'m sorry, I should have been more specific. I meant, "There still wasn\'t 
an Imperium in my campaign."  I knew of the Imperium by that time, of 
course.  I just didn\'t know enough about it, and I didn\'t really have 
much interest in changing my already-working setting, at that time.

We did something similar to that.  We played in the Rebellion when MT came 
out...until we decided the setting, while undeniably exciting for many 
people, wasn\'t for us.  So we went back to CT, and the universe that had 
grown up around our characters through the years.  

Like yours, ours wasn\'t a truly canonical version of the CT universe.  The 
Imperium was almost completely uncaring.  It was an entity capable of 
producing overwhelming force whenever it felt like it...which was usually 
in wars that most of the population felt were unecessary and petty; the 
result of the Imperial nobility\'s hubris.  

Speaking of the nobility, Strephon and the rest of the nobility were off 
in the background somewhere, feasting and piddling their lives away when 
not involved in something horrendously wasteful like war.  So, they really 
didn\'t enter into the picture. More important to the characters were the 
local governments, the overpowering MegaCorps, the super-rich/powerful, 
pirates, and organized criminals.  

Or, in our less-ambitious campaigns, the most important things all 
happened on one planet, and concerned ordinary people affected by their 
neighbors and rivals.

Oh!  This reminds me of a question I wanted to ask of those who refereed 
more than one campaign (I know some of the folks have run the same 
campaign since the beginning):  How much continuity, if any, was there 
between your campaigns?  Did previous characters\' exploits affect 
subsequent adventures?  Were previous characters even known about in 
subsequent campaigns?

Right on.  I read the Traveller News ("Yet another Imperium-wide benefit 
of membership in the Travellers\' Aid Society") to the players each time 
I received my new issue.  It was an on-going story we all followed, but 
only rarely did any of those events happen in my universe.

I\'m all for a strong setting with tons and tons of background information 
detailed to the last chromosome of each Alien.  Just, please, make it all 
separate from the game mechanics.

  That should be fine. If the code isn\'t understandable, I am happy to
interpret too. Have a look at it before deciding to port it though, as it 
does contain a fair bit of Amiga specific stuff.

You should find the two files there. Unfortunately there are no docs for the

done. I will see what I can do in copious amounts fo spare time! :-)

Wasn\'t / Isn\'t Aslan the name of a lion in some novel?  I thought 
that was written in Canon somewhere (probably in a Digest Magazine).

The only novels I know of with a lion named Aslan are the Chronicles of 
Narnia series by C.S. Lewis (which, incidentally, were the first novels I 
read all the way through of my own accord, and which were a big reason I 
learned to enjoy reading as much as I do!  After them I read C.S. Lewis\' 
sci-fi trilogy, from whose main character I get my handle.  From that 
point onward, I\'ve read mainly those two genres (sci fi and fantasy), 
which lead me to role-playing games.  So, it can be said, if it wasn\'t 
for C.S. Lewis I might be a very different person...and I wouldn\'t be 
here annoying you with chatter that is tenuously related, at best, to the 
subject at hand! :)  ).

As I understand it, yes.  Early Traveller had a number of jokes of
this sort inserted in.  As I recall, the official line was that the
Aslan were named by the early Solomani explorers who were the "first"
to contact one of the Aslan starfaring clans.  The meaning of the
name "Aslan" is lost in obscurity as far as Imperial citizens are
concerned.  :)  

There are other examples of such things in old Bestiary articles.  
For instance, there\'s an animal called a "bloodvark" that looks
like a cross between a bloodhound, aardvark, and canister vaccuum
cleaner, and is trained to find fugitives on many worlds.  On some
of them it is called a "hoover", but nobody knows why....  (Hoover
being a well-known vaccuum cleaner brand in the US.)  This was in
one of the old JTAS issues.  There\'s probably other examples, too.

The idea seems to have been to have subtle, plausible jokes for the
20th century players that the 57th century characters wouldn\'t get.
(Both the Hoover Vaccuum Cleaner Co. and Narnia books could easily 
survive into the Terran Confederation era, for instance.)

  Joe Walsh asked some leading questions over on TML which
quickly lead to a thread that rapidly diverged. I\'d like
to bring this back to the quiet civility of XBOAT and the
original point.

Joe Walsh asks a number of questions about hand computers:
Physical:
>Are they notebook-sized?

User Interfaces:
>you do something similar to flipping a page to get it to 
>display the next page?  Or do you say, "flip page?"  
>Would you say the display is very much like ink-and-paper

External Interfaces:

>can they be used as communicators?  Can you link them together
>into a temporary network, allowing every user to see what is

  Physical was interestingly discussed on TML, mainly around
the (wierd) ideas of flexible computers. What I\'d like to
expound upon is ideas around the user interface.

  Lets try to get away from the "box with buttons" idea. There
are better ways but lets, for the moment, think of our "hand
computer" as a pair of glasses. They sit on the bridge of
your nose not merely correcting vision but giving you the equivalent
of a "heads up display". This can be adjusted from completely
transparent to opaque depending on user preference and activity
(eg sitting at a campfire or driving a air/raft).
  Now, go further. Most conventional HUDs are static. Ie. they
project what they project independant of the attitude of the
head. However why not tie it into where your head is pointing?
(There are several ways to do this I won\'t bore you with.) So
when you look right, you see more screen. Same for up, down,
etc. The size of your virtual HUD grows further.
  Even more so, the corelation between head movement and screen
scrolling doesn\'t have to stop there. Just as a small movement
with a mouse produced a large movement across a computer screen,
moving your head 20 degrees to the right might rotate your
virtual display 40, 60 or 80 degrees, depending on sensativity
settings. (Cherryh\'s battledress works like this.) Thus your
virtual bubble world ends up being a sphere bigger than 360
degrees around (the maths gets a bit wierd, but there _are_
equations).
  With me so far? Next step.
  As the computer is sitting on your face, it has a pretty good
view of your eyes. It can tell exactly where you are looking.
If it wants to display a mouse-like cursor on the screen it can
put it just where you look (gee, I _really_ wish mine did that).
Not only that but since the angle of your eyes is slightly
different depending on how "deep" you are looking than it can
also not only detect direction but depth as well. Thus you have
a 3D "mouse".
  A lot of human non-verbal communication is done through facial
expression. We have quite developed muscles there for a wide
variety of nuances. Your Fabulous Facial Friend ("hand" computer)
can pick up on these. As simple as using different squints to
"right or left click the mouse" up to rather more complicated UI
interactions our immersion in present technology prevents us from
even guessing.
  And for my finale...
  I\'m an old keyboard jock. Mice are grand but try typing in this
article with one. Even with "Expression Entry" I still anticipate
the utility of keyboard-ish manual entry. After all, no matter how
versitile our faces are, our hands are more so.
  So far we have just looked at our "Eye Computers" looking in.
Well there is no reason they can\'t look out just as effectively.
They should be able to determine the exact attitude and placement
of your hands as effectively as your pupils. Say then that in your
virtual HUD a "keyboard" is displayed along with analoges of
your hands. You can then easily "type". (Wasn\'t there a scene like
this in Jonny Mnemonic?)
  Not only that but the keyboard is infinately versitile. You can
add keys, split the keyboard in ergonomic ways, and add bits all
over your virtual environment.
  Similarly the ear-rests can catch the vibrations of your skull
as you sub-vocalise and interpret that as further input for those
even too lazy to use the virtual keyboard...


  So lets wrap up with a bit of colour (and leave external interfaces
for another day)...

  Sid Viscous walks back from the customs house to his ship. He
stops in a park to check out the forms he\'s uploaded. He unfolds
his "hand" computer and places it on his nose. He closes his eyes
briefly and slowly opens them, activating the display to full
opacity. A number of textured portals litter his viewing area.
With a gesture he sweeps them off to his "sides". "Search by
recent", he mutters and a list of the more recently modified
data appears. Glancing and clicking he brings up the recently
uploaded customs lists.
  Grabbing one of the forms he drags it larger and a 3D display
starts explaining the form and its uses. Sid, however, has seen
this many times and, a few blinks later has axed the 3D playback
and is left with the textual representation of the regulations.
As his eyes scan down the document it scrolls more into view.
With various lip gestures he marks places of interest in the
hyper-texed fine print.
  With another eye-gesture he minimises the display and presses
a special "function button" that brings up his ship\'s manifest.
Eye flicking through this he eye-circles sections, and eye-drags
them to bits around on the desktop.
  When he is done with this he re-activates the form and drops
the info into requisite spots. One, however, red-lights, requesting
additional clarification on the containers he has entered as
"footware". He knows the Yasidians have an ankle taboo and that
the sandals he is importing are rather risque\' but local standards
and subject to strict government controls he had hoped to avoid.
  He ponders how he is to fill in this particular section as
a wrong answer could be costly and endanger his lisence. After some
time he is suddenly surrounded by large portable densiometers
soaring on vast pennons through the waif like atmosphere of a
gas giant. His "screen saver" has activated.
  Pulling himself together he dismisses the densiometers (which
flap bashfully behind activated panels) and start calling up
local dictionary translators. They have no real on-line services
outside of customs so he has to rely on data uploaded from there.
He drags screens around and flicks his eyes over definitions trying
to find one that adequately describes his cargo yet doesn\'t trigger
any legal warnings.
  His workspace quickly becomes cluttered and expands from 90
degrees to 180 and up to 270. He ties in several repeated actions
to facial macros and tries to organise his data.
  Suddenly the whole workspace shudders and he feels a heavy
pressure on his shoulder. Closing his eyes and rapidly opening
them set ths computer back to transparent mode. He blinks
repeatedly at an old gentleman poking him with a stick.
  "Are you all right there son? Thought you were having a bit
of a fit. You have to watch the UV around here. Good day, so."
The old mans wanders off in one direction and Sid goes in the
other. There is a Traveller\'s Aid Society around here somewhere.
They might have better dictionaries or old-hands who know the
ropes...

Hi, I just signed on to the XBoat so I missed the earlier comments on Campaign
Cartographer.

I have a copy of CC ($70, version 1.2 by ProFantasy Software, London; an earlier
version?). My package runs under DOS and included everything needed. The only
other module I\'ve seen was to add additional fonts.

I bought CC for drawing maps, but it included a starship template with standard
Traveller symbols for hatches, etc. You can also design your own symbols. CC is
a very flexible CAD program that lets you draw in color on multiple layers, edit
drawn shapes, do fills, etc. I\'ve used other CAD programs and CC compares very
well, especially for drawing maps (rivers, coastlines, ...). A step-by-step
tutorial is included. There are several export formats including Windows bitmap,
BMP (no GIF or JPG).

I have very limited experience with using CC for deck plans; I\'ll let you know
how my first full attempt goes.  I have seen deck plans drawn using CC at some
web sites.

Many years ago, I read a science-fantasy book called Solo Kill. The story took 
place on an alien world populated by several intelligent species, one of which 
was a technology-oriented amphibian river-dweller. It had invented numerous 
gadgets, such as the gas-powered engine and the aircraft, but not gunpowder. It 
used compressed air for its fire-arms, mainly rather unwieldy machine-guns (the 
most advanced smallarm was the crossbow). Another species operated at night and 
preferred silent weapons. Their glider plans were equipped by some sort of 
flechette-style bombs that were deadly against their unamoured opponents.

There *are* limits to this. You see, vision *requires* constant
movements of the eyes. If your eyes don\'t move you can\'t see anything.
So a visual "mouse" has a *lot* of "jitter".

Check out the entry system severely handicapped people like Stephen
Hawking use (there was an artical about it in byte about 10 years back.
It uses a set of icons and as you select them they change. They\'re
organized such that it takes *very* few icon choices to get to a word
or phrase. That\'s how Hawking, using something *considerably* less
useful that a mouse can speak in almost real time. Anything that fast
can be made faster with the sort of display you are talking about.
Especially since you\'ll start "memorizing" the movements required to
get common words and phrases, just like a typist can think "the" and
have his fingers hit the proper keys in the proper sequence.

Actually, the standard keyboard is *way* sub-optimal. And I\'m not
talking about things like the Dvorak keyboard. Check out what the call
"chording" keyboards. You have a key or two for each finger and
generate characters by using combinations of the keys. They don\'t take
much longer to learn, and they are *faster* once you learn. They can
also be set up to avoid carpal tunnel and the like.

The *most* common chording keyboard is the one used on "braillers".
These are intended to let the blind take notes, and they have six
buttons arranged like the dots of a braille character. There are a
couple of other controls, but I forget what they are. 

You just enter braille direct. You\'d think that there are just 64
possible characters. That\'s only partially true. The "braille alphabet"
you see in encyclopedias is what\'s known as "level 1 braille". Level 2
uses some otherwise unused level 1 characters to modify the meanings of
level 1 chars, giving things like multi character groupings or short
common words. Level 3 braille uses 2 and 3 character sequences to
represent entire words and phrases. 

Or consider the keyboards used by court stenographers. They have only
10 or 12 keys, yet they can transcibe damn near anything (it\'s called
"machine shorthand").

Given the above, there\'s no need to bother displaying a keyboard.
Select "text input" and then just flex your fingers in the right
patterns. You don\'t even have to flex them all that much, just enough
for the sensors in your glove (or attached to your wristband) to pick
up. 

> With various lip gestures he marks places of interest in the

With hyper-text storage and any sort of decent search program (using
even contemporary levels of "AI"), "fine print" becomes a meningless
concept. Instead, if someone is trying to be tricky, they\'ll have to do
it via setting up interrelationships between widely seperated
regulations. But slipping that past any sort of computer analysis
requires that you use a computer & software that are better than the
people you are trying to trick have. And the GCLU (Galactic Civil
Liberties Union) has some *good* people trying to find such things.

Yes, hypertext and computer aided searches may actually bring about the
return of the days when you could *understand* the laws affecting you!

> This is because originally the keyboard was set up to slow down the speed 
of the typist.  The first keyboard developed, back in the 1800\'s, was an 
extremely fast keyboard the problem was if you typed at maximum speed the 
striker type arms all got jammed up at the type place, who can remember 
this?  So someone came along and redesigned the keyboard to make it more 
difficult to type on, ie putting letters that ususally came together in 
places where they required more effort to reach.  This stopped the arms 
from jamming up and made typing faster.

Hm. I\'d argue that Brass->Iron is more of a leap than Iron->Bonded Superdense,
but I\'m not sure how.

Probably lots. if there\'s one thing that human have gotten better at over
the centuries (millenia!) it\'s keeping records. We know as much as we
do about Ancient Mesopotamia because they kept such good records on clay
tablets and such. Modern people produce such vast amounts of information
about themselves that we\'ll probably go down as the greatest narcicists (sp?)
in history... Oh wait you said _average_ citizen. Probably nothing.
The average modern person is lucky if they can place Sri Lanka on a map.
It will be possible for an average university-graduate type to know 
a lot about the 20th century, but it probably won\'t be common.
("I majored in 20th century history." "ooh, database archaeology, huh?")

Some figures will remain on the tips of everyone\'s tongue. Some names will
be forever lost. Name 3 Egyptian Pharoahs. Now, which one had his
burial crypt found intact, which one is a major brand of condoms and
you must have stayed awake in history to remember a third name. Now,
who built the Great Pyramid?  That\'s tougher, but you could do it.
Which pharoah imposed the greatest tax burder on his people? I doubt
anyone will get that one (without making it up or having a PhD).
(Note my use of the Egyptian metaphor as I don\'t know a thing about
Mesopotamia! Case in point.)

The average 58th century native Terran will probably know that John F.
Kennedy was an American president, but it\'ll be doubtful if they know
anything more than that he was shot. (Though by then, they may have
figured out by whom...)
 
> Comments (and PhD titles :-)) please.

I think that Terra would be unusual in that after the Rule of Man,
almost every human occupied planet in known space would have access
toa fairly complete Terran history. Vland and Terra would be the two
best known planets in all of space, perhaps even overshadowing
local historical stuff.

The Solomani aliens book by GDW had very little about Terra at the time of the 
Third Imperium.  The Solomani & Aslan book by DGP had some more, but one of the 
best sources of Terra info wound up being the Invasion:Earth board game by 
GDW.  This game was a simulation of the invasion of Terra at the end of the 
Solomani Rim War in 990.  In addition, I believe there was a DGP adventure 
(from the Megatraveller Journal?) set on Terra.

One of these books specifically mentioned the New York was still around, 
preserved under a dome.  Apparently, Washington DC also survived, as the 
Smithsonian was mentioned in one of the two Solomani courcebooks in passing.  
The ruins of ancient Egypt were also still around; the adventure was actually 
set in that area, IIRC.  The GDW Solomani sourcebook had an adventure which 
gave some info about Terran history, regarding the restoration of an Indonesian 
(?) royal family that was exiled after some sort of global vote around the time 
of the 1st Interstellar war.

From Invasion Earth we get some overall details.  There were three major 
starports;one each in Australia, North America and North Africa.  The one in 
North Amreica, Starport Phoenix (located near present-day Phoenix, Arizona) was 
renamed Paolo by the Imperium during the occupation, as it had too many 
connotations with the Solomani Phoenix Project (an intended anti-Imperial 
guerilla campaign).  The starport in Africa was called AECO Downport.  I recall 
reading somewhere that AECO stood for Africa-European Cooperative Organization, 
which would imply some sort of political or mercantile union between Europe and 
Africa.   

This game also gave us some indication about the big cities; really these were 
big megacities.  Not surprisingly, western Europe, the East and West coast of 
North America and Japan were all shown as vast city complexes extending for 
several hundred miles.  In addition, there were large blobs of megacity 
scattered in central China, Australia and Central America (Mexico City, I 
imagine).  I seem to recall that Africa was relatively clear of city blobs in 
the middle, but there were some in North Africa and in southern Africa.

In addition, there were some global changes.  The Mediterranen was larger, and 
the coasts of Northern Europe and the Americas were slightly changed; it looked 
as though the average sea level had increased.  This might imply some global 
warming and melting of icecaps, but I don\'t recall any specific statement.

I think the Terran of the 57th century would know far more about us today than 
we know about ancient Mesopotamia.  Unless there is some total breakdown of all 
Terran civilization (not just a drop back to TL9 in the Long Night) many 
records of nearly all facets of life will still be around centuries from now.  
Even if such a collapse were to happen, the sheer bulk of these records makes 
it much more likely to have a significant portion to survive.  Of course, this 
will still be the purview of scholars rather than the "average joe," but even 
the average guy will learn something in school.

The way I see it, our ability to store information has increased 
dramatically from the distant past you mention to today.  That is, in our 
distant past there wasn\'t a whole lot of information stored in the first 
place, so of course not a whole lot of that still exists today.  On the 
other hand, we store so much of our information today that even in the 
distant future (barring disasters too horrible to imagine) they will 
still have a great deal of our accumulated knowledge.

That\'s my take on it, anyway.

Sure!  Unless the batteries all went dead during the "long night."  Or
the Virus gets...ooops wrong echo!  <g>

Seriously, I do agree with you though.  Technology on planets like
Earth wouldn\'t fall far enough to loose access to their knowledge
base...and that raises the question:  Why did the "long night" last
over a thousand years?

OTOH, I\'d be just as happy to drop rocks on all the major planets and
let everybody restart from scratch....ooops rocks again!  <g>

Me!  Me!  I learned to type on a manual typewriter, complete with
striker arms. 

Derek\'s right about the keyboard layout.  The typewriter was invented
in 1871, and every manufacturer had his own layout, each better and
faster than everybody else.  The problem was the men (women weren\'t
allowed to type...their fingers were considered too delicate <g>) kept
jamming the keys.  In 1878, I think it was, a committee decided on a
standard keyboard layout..that we call QWERTY..that every manufacturer
*could* use.  The QWERTY layout was designed to slow typists down and
particularly move certain key combos to locations requiring a reach.

Today with electronic typewriters/keyboards we don\'t need the QWERTY
layout, but it\'s unlikely to go away.  Typing teachers know QWERTY, so
they teach QWERTY, and their students become the typing teachers who
teach what they learned...QWERTY. <G>

Dr Dvorak developed a much better layout in the early 1930\'s.  His
layout was tested against QWERTY:  2 typists typed the same documents
during an 8 hour day with movie cameras recording their finger
movements, the distance their fingers moved during the the 8 hours of
typing were measured.  The QWERTY typist\'s fingers moved more than 3
miles, while the Dvorak\'s typist\'s fingers moved around 1/2 mile.

Curved barrels are decidely non-optimal for any kind of projectile
propelled by a push. They\'d be hard to aim, and the wear on the outside
of the curve would be extreme. They\'d also have a tendency to blow up.

Missile weapons progress through several somewhat parallel sequences,
and gun powder comes in fairly late.

electromagnetic:

I can\'t think of any missile weapons that don\'t fit one of these
categories (except maybe the boomerang).

I can\'t really see torsion/tension weapons going much farther than they
did. Ditto for pressure and rocket. You run into materials limits
pretty fast. 

On the other hand, there *are* some possibilities with centrifugal
force. Take the old "turbine" that Heron invented in ancient Greece. It
never got used for anything. But imagine someone noticing the way that
anything "loose" near the ends of the nozzles flys off pretty hard.

With a some work, you could come up with a gizmo that dropped stones
from a hopper into "boxes" one the side of the "turbine". Remember, it
spun about a *horizontal* axis. Sort of like a miniature waterwheel
attached to the same shaft.

It wouldn\'t be very effective, but it\'d be enough to make people keep
tinkering with it. Eventually, you\'d wind up with a *nasty* little
weapon. A steam turbine coupled to a set of appropriately curved
compartments that get fed balls at one point and eject them down a
barrel after say half a revolution or so. Look up the rpm of even an
19th century steam turbine, and figure out what sort of velocity we are
talking about with only a meter radius.

It might even be possible to design one around a compact gas turbine,
in which case you\'d have a rifle like weapon with the soldier packing
around a small fuel tank (propane?) and having this weird circular
bulge near the stock of the weapon, and an exhaust port somewhere
spitting out hot gases.

  Um, that\'s the end result of the configurability I postulate.
In case you didn\'t notice I\'m not talking about anything as primitive as
a glove either. One optical sensor should do the trick.

  Oh, ho, ho, ho! Not a chance. "Fine print" just takes on a new meaning.
Take airline reservation systems. Once they were computerised everyone
thought that we now were going to have fair and equal chances for any
airline to get tickets. Then some airlines started changing their departure
times by a few minutes in different directions so that the search software
put them on the top of the list for commonly used search engines.

  Laws will always complexify themselves to the point where you need
professionals to interpret them. Ever since good old Hamurabi carved
that stele there have been lawyers. There always will be.
  Hypertext contains no magical solution. If you make it long enough and
with enough cross references you will need a professional to interpret.
It is just that it allows you to express much more complicated laws than
cuneiform.

  So, guys, instead of discussing 20th century technology just assume the
future deals with this stuff. Get back to the original gimick and lets hear
some plot ideas...

This is an awfully good point!  One of the things that I didn\'t like about
the New Era is that they seemed to forget about this: 20th century
references abounded, and for no real reason.

Just the sheer volume of history (even assuming that it was all preserved)
and historical data will overwhelm someone who was trying to research it.
Naming US Presidents would be a lot like naming Egyptian or Chinese rulers.

A reference to "Aslan" would be as obscure in the Far Future as a reference
to "Ninkasi" is today (would you drink from an unmarked, opaque container
labelled "Ninkasi"?).

Exactly.
"Yah, database archaeology.  Did you know that for most of the 20th century,
 they didn\'t have full-text searching?"
"No way, get outta here, man!  How did they ever find things?"
"Aparrently they didn\'t.  I\'m doing a paper on their early space travel, and

 I can\'t find any refernece to it in contemporary military histories."

And they\'ll probably remember Washington and Lincoln (but I\'ll bet a lot of
people will confuse Kennedy and Lincoln - after all, they were both "the one
that got shot").

Unless someone is _really_ interested in it, the most detail that
anyone will ever go into would probably be like Larry Gonick\'s (excellent)
_A Cartoon History of the Universe_.  There\'s just too much information for
anyone to be more than casually aware of it.

Planets like Earth didn\'t loose their knowledge base - Earth was the core of
the Old Earth Union, a space-faring trading group that lasted through the
Long Night.  It\'s the other, less-optimal worlds that didn\'t fare so well.

Remember, the Long Night was triggered by a currency collapse: interstellar
banks started to refuse to honor notes and drafts on "far away" branches.
It doesn\'t take much of this for trade to become a local (or even
non-existant) thing.  Once trade collapsed, only worlds with a friendly
ecosystem and a population that could be locally supported remained.  These
worlds are fairly few and far between.

The end result being that there was no _point_ to going off-world; many
economies suffered a long depression or stagnation even on the best worlds.
Add to that a number of groups with working starships that decided that the
best way to deal with the financial problems was to take what they wanted
from those less-well-armed, compound it with Fear, Uncertanty, and Doubt,
and pretty soon nobody goes trading anymore.

This jogged a memory loose. I\'ve seen plans for something very similar
to this in a 1940s vintage _Popular Mechanics_ or _Popular Science_.
The gizmo used an electric motor to spin a tube around it\'s centerpoint.
Each end of the tube was curved into something like a Jai Alai racket
shape. A hopper fed BBs into the hub of the tube, centrifugal force
spun the BBs out through the tubes. There was some sort of interruptor
mechanism to ensure the BBs would release from one point.

The photo showed a happy home handyman playing with his electric indoor
BB machinegun, punching holes in paper targets in the comfort of his
den. The whole mechanism was pretty small, and there were some cautions
on building one bigger, with a faster motor, etc., because this could 
scale into a nasty little device pretty easily.

Our ability to store information for short periods of time has increased
by leaps and bounds over the past ten years but noone is thinking of long
term storage. The lifespan of information on magnetic tape is less than 20
years and on optical disk it probably less than 100 years. This is without
regard to data layout and character set encoding which brings up a whole
other set of issues. So even if a CD-ROM would last until 5700~5800 AD it
would be difficult to decipher without a contemporary ASCII table and
printed copy of the CD-ROM data layout books as rosetta stones so to
speak. I think it\'s foolish to assume that we will employ a significant
portion of the earth\'s workforce in the endevour of constantly converting
databases which are meaningless out of context from "obsolete" formats to
"modern" formats every twenty years or so. 

What this means is that _some_ historical data will be saved. A list of
American presidents provided that when we get around to creating one-world
government it\'s not the Japanese that end up with the most influence 8-). 
Land records and trades will be meticulously maintained for as long as we
can buy and sell land. There\'s probably a tonne of stuff that\'s I\'m
missing but the point is that it\'s foolish to think that it will be
possible to look up a twentieth century individual\'s credit rating and
local buying habits more than 20 years after his death even though that
information is meticulously collected, stored and maintained now. Also, 
forget this information storage if there\'s a short war to interrupt this 
"golden age" of information in which we live. Computers and information 
have become so important that they will certainly be first line targets 
in the next war.

Night\' is mostly  Cleon-ist propoganda, and refers mostly to the lack 
of a centralized Government, most places did not fall into barbarism.

     But, here\'s an idea...The long night was mostly an economic 
phenomenon, brought about by two major factors...the long supression 
of technology by the Vilani, and the over heated, over rapid 
expansion of the Rule of Man.

      The former guaranteed that the majority of worlds were dependent
upon imports from select high tech planets for a large amount of
their infrastructure.  This is well in line with the conservative,
monopolistic practices of the Vilani. Thus very few worlds had the
ability to maintain their current tech level (meaning interstellar
travel), and since knowledge was so supressed by the Vilani, even
the ability to recreate the tech was not there.  These planets would
have had to go through the equivalent of the Renaissance, the
Enlightenment, and the Industrial age, all over again to get back to
where they were.

     The Terran rule probably made things worse.  The rapid expansion 
probably stretched and broke what infrastructure was there..again, 
leading to significant dependence on technological imports.

     When the economy collapsed, everyone drew back to smaller and 
smaller spheres of influence. Star travel never died out, but trade 
was economically unviable in many areas. These areas were never quite 
lost as much as ignored.

     With economic collapse, as surely as summer follows spring, comes 
warfare...fighting between the remaining starfaring groups probably 
destroyed even more of the advanced technological base.

     This could well have led to a rather isolationist viewpoint on many 
many of the worlds involved, again supressing interstellar trade 
and travel.

     With the combination of a lack of technical resources, the lack of 
knowledge, and isolationist policies, it\'s not hard to figure that 
the Long Night would fall.

     Why did this state persist for a thousand years? I dunno...I\'d be 
more likely to think of it in terms of a few hundred, unless by sheer 
fortuitous luck, no one in the entire known universe with the drive, 
and resources of Cleon I existed until he did.

Good question.  I dunno.

Oop.  That won\'t make for a good post, now will it? :)

Lemme see...perhaps, just prior to the long night, all knowledge stores 
had been transferred to some storage medium that was inaccessable when 
tech levels dropped.  No books, just high-tech storage that relied on 
technology prone to failure and which no one could repair any longer.

Yup, that\'d require a bit o\' handwaving, but that\'s all I can come up 
with right now. :)

It depends on what the information is.  A business that coverts to a new 
storage format will transfer all of its current customer database into 
the new format.  Non-current customers\' data will probably not be 
transferred.  So, over the long term, you are correct: none of this 
information is likely to be available very long after the customer\'s 
death. 

But, really, I wasn\'t referring to such "knowledge" at all.  Loosely 
stated, I am referring to the type of information one could find in a 
library.  

Will this sort of information be converted?  I think you\'ll grant that 
the "core" stuff (meaning, the stuff that is most often accessed) will 
be.  There will also be items which, although not frequently used, will 
be determined to have historical importance (that importance, of course, 
being determined in the then-current context, which will undoubtedly 
exclude some items that would be considered VERY relevant 200 or 2000 
years from then) and will therefore also be converted - perhaps by 
privately funded organizations, or even by business-sponsored 
conversion.  

The rest?  Sure, it may fall by the wayside.  It may not be converted, 
and will eventually deteriorate beyond usability.

Nonetheless, the point of my post was that we have HUGE stores of 
knowledge (again, referring to library-type knowledge) in comparison to 
even 200 years ago.  Not only do we have a lot more knowledge stored, we 
also have more copies of that knowledge - and those copies are scattered 
all over, under the care of many different people and organizations.

So, even if we assume that 90% of our knowledge will be wiped out due to 
lack of conversion to subsequent storage methods (something I consider 
highly unlikely, but for the sake of argument I stipulate it), the 
remaining stores will still dwarf what we have of the knowledge base from 
3000 years ago.

I\'d say that\'s a good analysis

I suspect star travel did die out over *much* of the area.

That\'s what I figure finally broke the whole thing down.  A
*dependent* world with a starship or two tries to take what it needs
from a higher tech world, and everybody ends up with broken equipment
and a lot poorer.  If this kind of think happened over and over, you
would grind down the remaining infrastructure leaving very little to
rebuild with.

This probably wouldn\'t happen on the *home* worlds, like Terra &
Vilin, for instance, but their sphere\'s of influence might contract to
a very small area.  

What I don\'t quite get is the loss of tech levels on planets like
Vilin or Terra, so that the expanding 3rd Imperium have Jump 2 or 3
and Tplate tech and the old centers of power don\'t!  The only thing I
can think of is they *really* were wreaked by war sometime during the
dark age.

    >Why did this state persist for a thousand years? I dunno...I\'d be

...or several thousand!  If it was mainly economic, then a few
hundred.  If *massive* wars spread across the whole area taking out
virutally *all* areas of high tech, AND continued happening until
everybody was knocked down so low they couldn\'t get at each other,
then several thousand to rebuild and come back.  

One other thing I thought about is that maybe there\'s some material or
element needed for Jump and maybe TPlate tech that is missing in
almost every system.  So even if System A retained the *knowledge*
they might not have the material, and System B might had the material,
but no longer had the knowledge.

Over the centuries, maybe several seperate cultures would emerge at
about the same time..not unreasonable if they are all starting from
about the same level..and killed each other off.  This might have
happened over and over, until one *didn\'t* get killed off, and we call
that last one the 3rd Imperium.

Sounds right to me, too.  War goes hand-in-hand with economic collapse.  
In some areas, it would be horrific levels.  In others, it would amount 
to hit-and-run/smash-and-grab type actions.  But it would be everywhere 
it would be possible for one needy world to reach another world.

Again, I agree, IF those worlds remained powerful enough to ensure 
economic stability for surrounding worlds.

Could be. If they retained anything worth having, and if someone else had 
some firepower and wanted that stuff, then devastating war would be a 
possibility.

I agree.  But, goodness, didn\'t even ONE world survive relatively 
intact?

Another good thought.  It could very well have happened that way.  Plus, 
it makes for good reading, should someone want to write the history of 
the Long Night. :)

The standard QWERTY layout was NOT designed to slow down typing, it was
designed to put common characters far apart on the board so that they
wouldn\'t jam. Jams ocurred more frequently on nearby characters. The fact
that we are still using this stupid layout is for backwards compatability
which is the bane of all progress but probably good for the profit margin.

I endeavour to tell you about some practices here in Sweden to preserve=20

stored at one or two other similar sites, too.) These shelters are so well-
designed that it would required a direct hit by a nuclear warhead to destro=

The Stockholm Tolkien & fantasy society to which I belong was once upon a t=

Last night I get the official timeline from TNE and calculated the
"equivalent" times in Earth-history.  I.E. in 1117 the Imperium is 1117
years old.  1117 before 1996AD is 879AD.  Take an example from "local
history": 879 is approx the time that Kenneth MacAlpine unified Scotland.
How many people, even here, know that, or care?  At high school history
lessons skimmed over everything before the industrial revolution (:-()
giving only the broadest strokes before getting to the "relevant" stuff.  I
would guess that education in the Imperium would have a similar bias towards
"recent" events, and every planet would have its own spin on what the events
meant.  The foundation of the Imperium would surely be a semi-legendary
event to most people, perhaps like the origins of China to modern people
living there.   I think that the average Imperial citizen might view the
rise of Terra and its conquest of the Ziru Sirka in much the same way as we
view the arrival in Greece of certain iron-armed tribes from the steppes:
very important to the origins of our culture but not really relevant nowadays.

I agree that records would survive into the far future, but I\'m not sure how
complete they would be.  For example, how many history books will make it
onto CD, and how many of those will eventually make it onto holo-cube and
subsequent media? How many scholars will dedicate their careers to studying
the history of pre-fusion Terra?  On Earth itself people might know (for
example) that their was once a great country called the United States, and
that it had presidents and that one was called Kennedy, but I would guess
that practically no-one would know which order the presidents served or what
they did, just as very few people know which order the pharoahs ruled in.
On other imperial planets people might be aware that there was once a world
called Terra (barbaric name!) and that much imperial culture was orginally
derived from there, and that the Terrans claimed to be the original humans:
I wonder if they would be aware of much more.  But think of the
opportunities for future Cecil B DeMilles - "Thrill as Neil Armstrong, his
glamourous sidekick Valentina and the heroic soldiers of Nasa battle against
viscious Aslan raiders on the sands of ancient Luna" (subtitles in Anglic) :-)

Canon says that the TC grew out of the United Worlds, which itself
grew out of the UN.  There is a Challenge adventure (I forget which
Challenge, or the adventure\'s title) about an early Terran explorer
who some how survives to the 57th Century, and her experience of the
TC was that it was fairly liberal - the racist ideals of the Solomani
(who claim her and her preiod of history as role models) disgust her.
Of course, the hawks in the TC were gaining power, and the TC probably
became a military-inclined nation shortly after she left the scene (in
a misjump induced by the first shots of the First Interstellar War, I
seem to remember.)  Whoa, just reread your post - do you mean the new
Terran Confederation, ie. post-collapse?  In that case the TC is
fascist, if it derives from the Solomani Confederation.  Doesn\'t the
latest Traveller Chronicle cover this area?

No way! Let me tell you a little secret - the US of A doesn\'t exist in
the 58th century!  Unless your citizen comes from Terra, this
knowledge is going to be entirely unknown, and even then it would
probably be relatively common knowledge for North American citizens.
Don\'t underestimate the average man\'s ignorance of history.  I\'m
hardly average, but about all I know is that Washington was a general
and later the 1st President, Lincoln had something to do with slaves,
wore a top hat, and was shot, and JFK was also shot, and owned a
rocking chair (or was that his missus).  I\'m not even 100% sure on any
of this (so don\'t flame me if I\'m wrong on my US history, because that
just makes my point stronger).  A human from Sol region might know
important leaders of the Terran Confederation or The Rule of Man, but
in canon references the only pre-Long Night leaders mentioned are the
1st and 2nd Emperors of The Rule of Man!

How many average people can name Roman Emperors?  Caeser? Not a name,
but a title (although I think the distinction was a little blurred
then).  We know who the Emperors were, fairly closely, but almost no
one without a specific interest will be able to name many of them.
The same is true of ancient Terran governments in the 58th century.

If one accepts this for starships it is interesting. Since we know how much
starships cost, how long it takes to build them, and the salaries of engineers
we can calculate _how many_ people are needed to build a ship.

Sticking to classic, Book 2 puts the average starship engineer at a salary
of 4000Cr per month. First lets assume that the average starship _constructor_
earns the same. Second lets assume 100% loading. Ie. that the administrative
cost of a person is equal to their cost in salary (true for the software 
industry,
the only experience I have).

By Book 2, the standard scount costs 29.43MCr and takes 9 months to build.
Thats a cost of 3.27MCr per month. Of that 1.635MCr is labour. Removing
the loading leaves 817.5KCr cost in salaries. Dividing by the normal wage
implies that it requires 204 engineers working full time to build a standard
scoutship.

Applying this to the rest of the standard ships we get:

Free Trad     211
Sub Merch     451
Sub Line      673
Yacht         290
Merc Cruis   1115
Pat Cruis     987

So, for example, if a starport wins a contract for making a subsidised liner
that garuntees jobs for over six hundred workers for nearly two years. You
can see how governments might subsidise such vessels not just for
garunteed freight service but also for the employoment it ingenders.

In fact you might say that such subsidised vessels are primarily built during
slumps in commercial shipping. Rather than have loads of ship yard workers
laied off and either degenerate or move away, commissioning a subsidised
ship keeps them gainfully employed and their skill sets current. The trickle
down effect benefits the rest of the economy. For this the government gets
a ship that must service their shipping requirements and probably at a very
good price, since prices would drop during a slump.

"Ah yes", said the old starhand, "The Willful Wallabie here was built during
the depression of the 1030s. She may be old but you will find no problem
getting spare parts. There are thousands like her that the governments
were churning out. In fact they say that the economic boom of the 1040s
was caused by the increase in shipping tonnage due to all the subsidised
ships on the market place. And she can be yours for the excelent price of ..."

In the private sector, companies would mainly be concerned with keeping
their facilities in full production for as much time as possible. (Assuming that
construction engineers are permanant rather than casual hire. Not necessarily
valid comparing to today.) Consequently there would probably be _less_
shipyard space than demand would indicate.  It is more profitable to have a 
medium
sized shipyard that is always busy than a large one that stands idle 
occasionally.
Shipyards would only expand when they were really certain they could support
it. Competing shipyards would strive to get someone "book in" to slots in as
far advance as possible. So they might give attractive discounts to a 3 year
contract which work may not start on for 1 year (or more!).

Inbetween the public and private sector you would have unions or other worker
"representative" bodies. Their main concern is not profit but increased wages
and numbers of workers. They would likely lobby at increasing the size of
shipyards whenever possible. In good times they can use the threat of strike
to try to drive the salaries of their members up and in bad times they might
cut deals promising not to strike and fix wages in return for lump-sum 
donations.


Gee, this is begining to sound like all the debate around Welsh Mines in the
80s. Am I too fixed in my century or do some things never change?

Consider also how much information can fit in just a single CD-ROM
today, and DVDs are expanding this. How soon will it be before every
"important" book ever written will fit on a single optical disk?
I don\'t know how long a CD-ROM will last (it\'s probably longer than
100 years if its shrink-wrapped :-), but all that it takes is for
somebody to reprint it every so often. Even if you have to spend
some time figuring out a disk format from 200 years ago (which isn\'t
really *that* hard), the knowledge from one disk would be worth it.

1, and I\'ve noted the continuing improvement in quality with pleasure.  
While still not up to the production values and content of JTAS, 
Challenge, or Traveller\'s Digest, the last few issues of TC are quite good.

  As others have noted, the primary focus of Issue 10 is the Solomani Rim 
in the New era.  16 subsector maps with data for systems for both 1117 
and 1202 occupy 16 pages, with another 10 pages of text describing 
significant features of the sector, are very well done - certainly as 
good as any of the sector supplements produced by GDW and others.  With 
an index and other information, the Solomani Rim section makes up 36 
pages out of 56.

  According to the editorial, future issues will detail the major polical 
entities of the Solomani Rim and provide equipment and ship designs for 
Classic, MT, and New Era settings - it looks like this will be Sword of 
the Knight\'s pocket empire for the near future.  The Terran Republic, a 
pocket empire centered on Earth, seems especially interesting, as a 
non-fanatical religeous empire.  I\'ve always thought that religion was 
one of the most neglected aspect of Traveller - I\'m looking forward to 
the next issue.

  One interesting piece of information is in the writeup for Arcturus 
Subsector on the planet Cymbeline (the source of the Deyo chips used in 
Imperial Transponder circuits and Virus).  This mentions that Vampire 
ships make "pilgramages" to Cymbeline (to visit their ancestors?) and 
come away with altered programing, an "Evangelical Doomslayer" strain 
that wants revenge on Lucan for nuking Cymbeline in the late stages of 
the Wars of the Rebellion.  The altered Vampires then head Coreward to 
try and find Lucan.  This explains the "Vampire Highway" from the 
RC material.  I have not seen this explanation in print before, though I 
may have missed it, and I rather like it.

  The remainder of the issue is an adventure.  One nice aspect is that 
the setup provides three settings - Reformation Coalition, Regency, or 
the Traveller Chronicles own Far Frontiers.  A typical rescue scenario, 
the adventure is well written, though the final resolution of the mystery 
brings those naughty Ancients in again.

  Overall, a solid effort, though the interior art is still substandard 
(nice cover, though) - well worth the purchase price.  Most useful for 
TNE GMs, though for folks without the old GDW Solomani Rim supplement 
this is a cheap way to get that data.  Two thumbs up.

Not entirely true. A lot of archivists, Library type, and even some

Computer tapes 20 years old may be hard to read. Cassette tapes that

It doesn\'t take *that* much of the workforce. Plus, there are some
storage formats being worked on that look to be a lot more stable over
long periods.

But now you know why businesses are so strong on hardcopy records.

Another factor just coming into play are the legal aspects. There are
court rulings that make such things as email by government employees
"public records" which must be stored indefinitely.

And folks like Project Gutenberg are working hard to get a lot of stuff
into machine readable format. And that stuff *will* keep getting moved
to new formats.

I intend to track down a machine readable listing of the level 3

Only if it\'s an imaging sensor. Simpler (and much cheaper and more
reliable) sensors can detect things like mucle contractions or joint
flexes. I think tension of tendons would work well as that\'s
proportional to the flexing of the fingers, and can be easily measured

Won\'t help them with me. Last time I used the OAG, I selected start and
end points, then the date of departure and the *prices*. I\'m *real*
flexible on time, and it was a "one hop" flight. :-)

But I meant "fine print" in the sense of "concealing" info.

I suspect that we\'ll reach the situation described in an Analog story.
Everyone will have their personal AI, and it\'ll download the local laws
as you enter the jurisdiction. Then it\'ll advise you on what you need
to worry about.

Lawyers and laws haven\'t gotten a lot of attention from computer
science types yet. But it turns out that the notation used for computer
langauge syntax diagrams works *very* well for laws. And the result is
both more compact and easier to understand. 

Lexical analysis is going to make things *very* different. It\'s a
relatively new tool, and hasn\'t (yet) been applied in this area. 

As for plot ideas, how about a "practical joke" by a "friend". He loads
a program into your "glasses" that does to your vision and hearing what
things like "jive" and "valspeak" do to text.

You could get into a *lot* of trouble before you took off the glasses.

   I overheard in interesting conversation the other day while sitting in a
local theater waiting for the movie ``Independence Day`` to start (by
the way, I highly recommend it--it\'s not ``Sense and Sensibility``, but
then it doesn\'t try to be--it is vaguely reminiscent of the Star Wars trilogy,
however).

   A person brought up the name Clark Cable during a conversation.  The
other said, ``oh yeah, he was an actor, wasn\'t he?``

   In a conversation with my sister a few years ago, I brought up the
name Elton John.  She, being ten years younger than me, had no idea
who he was.

   Information and historical data will no doubt be available in quantity
about 20th century Earth in the 58th century.  The real question is, will
anyone care, or will certain myths be accepted as fact.

   We know from Survival Margin that Strephon quoted Lincoln, so at
least some American influence continues on.  The Third Imperium is
described as having a substantial middle-class, and that Imperial culture
is similar to ``that of late 20th century America`` (then again we should
remember that the authors of Traveller are late 20th century Americans,
so we shouldn\'t be too surprised).

   One twist that is part of Traveller canon involves the worship by
a certain Solomani religious sect, of Elvis Presley.  While probably just
thrown in for comic relief, remember that there really *is* a group
currently in existence that calls itself ``The Church of Elvis``, in which
believers treat Elvis Presley as a holy man (these people claim to be
nominally Christian).

   Now on to Jamie Young\'s comments:

   Good point.  It is likely that the average Imperial citizen doesn\'t know
Lincoln from Washington.  Someone with `History-1` might know that
they were great American Presidents, someone with `History-2` might
also know that Washington was the first U.S. president (some with
History-7 would know that John Hancock was technically the first
president, but he was President of the Continental Congress), and that
Lincoln was President during something called ``The American Civil
War``, which they might wrongly conclude was similar to the Imperial
Civil War and that characters such as Lee and Jefferson Davis were
generals trying to seize the Presidency from Lincoln.  You get the idea.

>I would guess that education in the Imperium would have a similar bias

   While certain facts was be consistent because to the influence of
Imperial culture, it is likely that if you want to study American history
(or British history, etc.) you would have to do your own independent
studies, or take an Ancient History course down at the local university.

>How many scholars will dedicate their careers to studying the history
>of pre-fusion Terra?  

   Probably large numbers of them, just as there as large numbers of
Egyptologists today.  Rancorous debates would probably take place
between Imperial and Solomani ``Terraology`` scholars about the causes
of World War II, what country baseball originated in, controversial 
interpretations and translations of ancient Terran texts (remember folks,
it is very unlikely that the people who speak Galactic English are
speaking the Queen\'s English--Lord knows if anyone still speaks Italian
in any form), etc.

   Rachel Strider was her name.  As I recall, the ending of the adventure
left it open as to whether she was the real thing or an imposter trying
to embarrass the Solomani government.

   Hundreds of years of war created a ``warrior elite`` who were
responsible for the prosecution of the war.  Looked on and idolized as
heroes, no doubt, unfortunately one of them decided that the
Confederation government had no business treating the Vilani Imperium
as spoils of war, and decided to instigate a coup....

>Doesn\'t the latest Traveller Chronicle cover this area?

   The latest Traveller Chronicle (#10) covers primarily New Era material
for the Solomani Rim (the Terran Republic), though there are references
to pre-Collapse history.  The next couple of issues of Traveller Chronicle
should go into more depth about pre-Collapse matters.

   Nor does the UK, at least as we known it.  There are administrative
districts called `England`, `Scotland`, etc. but they exist as a way to
divide the planet for governing purposes only.  There are probably
cultural regions, where tourists can gawk at ``Californians`` and
``Germans`` (who probably aren\'t those things any more than residents
of Rome are Ancient Romans), but that\'s as close as you\'re going to get
to being home.

>Don\'t underestimate the average man\'s ignorance of history.

   You\'re comments about Washington and Lincoln and Kennedy prove
the point I was making about Clark Cable and Elton John above.

   BTW, President Kennedy owned the rocking chair--he had a bad back
and the chair helped.  Lincoln freed the slaves (actually Union troops and
the slaves themselves did the real work, but you get the idea).

   I wonder how many Americans can name even three UK Prime
Ministers?  We\'ll worry about the royals later....

   Actually Caesar, and it was both a name and a title (as was
Augustus).  The original Caesar was of course Julius.  Later on during
the Empire it became a title.

   Of course I know much of the above because I was a History major
in college.  Others may not know as much.

This is a BIG (Read: HUGE, ENORMOUS, GARGANTUAN) assumption.  First off, you
wouldn\'t be using what Traveller calls Engineers (at least not what we first
think of).  The only real place we have for these guys in our ship yard is
in the Maintenance Dept, and they rarely work on ships.  Some of your cost
is going to people who in Traveller would best be described as Business
Professionals (could be Engineers) with a high Starship Architecture skill.
Starting pay for these types IIRC is $25K with top levels being as high as
$50K to $75K.  Most of your cost is going to go to Construction workers.
These fellows make $6.00 to $13.00 an hour.  We typically work the yard
48-60 hours a week depending on how far behind we are.  In our ship yard
(and I think as the norm) we have welders, fitters, painters, and helpers
(the yards that do vessels as opposed to jus barges add electrical and
mechanical).  The experience of the worker is going to determine how much he
makes.

>Second lets assume 100% loading. Ie. that the administrative
>cost of a person is equal to their cost in salary (true for the software 
>industry,
>the only experience I have).

This is not true at all.  The software industry must have a high overhead
rate!!  In our shipyard, we have about 200 employees whose pay is charged to
the job, and about 25 "overhead" employees who don\'t charge their time
directly to a job.  As I\'m in purchasing, I don\'t know the actual pay
figures for people, but my guess is that our overhead pay is close to $70K
to 80K per month.  Our job direct employees would be in the neighborhood of
$450K per month.  Of course, since I\'ve been here we have never had fewer
than three hulls in the yard, and about every other job is a multiple hull
job.  A typical contract is for $8 to 10 Million (8,000,000) per hull.  This
is for a barge with no propulsion or crew quarters.  Just a bunch of cargo
space and painting and , depending on the type, we also add piping, pumps,
and generators or engines to run the pumps (for cargo handling).  Anyway,
the point is, that I would consider a typical ship yard to have overhead at
20 to 25 percent of job direct labor.  Of course, I wasn\'t including Labor
in my figures the other day, and whil they were slop figures and very
conservative, the excess wouldn\'t be enough to cover the entire overhead
figure.  Also, most yards would probably be part of a corporation that had a
main office that charged overhead.  That overhead wasn\'t in my figure
either, and I have no idea how much that number would be, but I do know that
it would be split between at least two yards (although only two or three
yards centralized overhead would probably be run from one of the yards.)

These figures are all costs, the price would only be 15 to 25 percent of
that, and you should use the price figure to come up with the accurate labor
numbers.  Also, I\'m curious what the "cannon" time to build these other
ships is.  I don\'t think I agree with the 9 month figure to build a Std
Scout.  I would probably list is as at least a year and consider it a quick
project.  I mentioned in my post that it was going to take almost 3 years to
build a 600Td hull (Barge only, add at least 6 mo for a ship).  This is a
typical time for Government jobs.  Civillian Jobs take a bit less, maybe two
years.  This time is pretty standard for hulls from 250Td to 900Td.  The
smaller hulls would take probably a year and a half on average.  I\'d be
interested to see how your figures match the current norms based on what I
believe to be a more accurate construction time.  I\'ll get with the
Production Controll guy here and get some numbers on manhours for different
size hulls, and post that later if the interest continues.

Shipyard workers are very migratory.  For example, Down here on the coast,
many of our yard workers quit during shrimp season and go out to run their
shrimp boat until the season is over, at which time they come back and hire
on again.

The shipbuilding community usually runs on a three to six year cycle, that
is every three to four years there is more work than there is yards.  The
idea is to get work lined up for your yard to last throughout the coming
slump.  Its not easy, but that\'s what makes the estimators hair grey.  ;)

This is true to some extent, but I\'ve never seen a shipyard at 100 percent
capacity.  Naturally, you want to make the most of every inch of your
facility, but this really isn\'t practical.  I\'d expect the average to be
around 55 to 60 percent capacity.  Of course, often a good 25 to 35 percent
of your capacity is taken up by repair jobs.  Repair jobs are a different
story altogether.  The fariance in repair jobs is so vast, that it is
difficult to even set a standard.  For example, a simple job, like blasting
and repainting a set of deck barges is usually a cash cow for yards.  Other
jobs, like re-outfitting a barge, can take your shirt along with all your
money.  It is an art to know which jobs to bid on and shich to refuse.

The reality of the Shipworkers unions is much less dramatic than that of the
United Railworkers Union, the United Autoworkers Union, or any of the other
"highly visible" Unions here in America.  In reality, the Union does the job
it is supposed to, that is working with management as a representative of
the employees as a whole to improve working conditions.


Sorry to those of you who aren\'t interested in this stuff, but finally the
topic has come around the circle to something I know about and can talk
somewhat intelligently about.  Hope this helps folks better understand
Traveller shipbuilding.  When I find the time, I\'m gonna try to work up an
information type document on my take on Traveller starship construction.
I\'ll post it to the list for comment

Calculating how many people it takes to build a starship is a cute idea,
but your examples have some big wholes. Is the price of a vessel the
wholesale or retail value? You make some pretty large assumptions - that
everyone gets paid the same and that salary costs are equal to
administrarative costs.

Sorry to put a damper on things. Like I said, it\'s a cute idea, but there
are two many huge assumptions for it to be even a rough estimate.

easy for them to expand and incorporate surrounding worlds and

Another possibility for destruction:  Perhaps this is solely an American 
phenominon, but it seems that there are always groups who enjoy burning 
books, recorded music, etc. that they disagree with.  If such a feeling 
were to sweep the nation for whatever reason, there would be mass 
destruction of all kinds of material.

Probably will never happen...but, I fear, it is no less likely than all 
of your country being razed by a nuclear barrage. :(

references into Traveller.  You have to give the people something 
familiar that they can hang onto.  Look at any movie and you\'ll see 
something familiar, something that people can realate to.  If there\'s 
nothing to relate to there\'s no connection and if there\'s no connection 
you\'ve lost the audience before the first reel is half over.

Movie\'s have it easy, there\'s tons of visual clues that give you a 
feeling of familiarity reguardless of the surroundings.  On the written 
page, you have to convey that feeling with words not with images.  It\'s 
there so that players and GM\'s can loose themselves in the alienness of a 
world but still find something that they can latch onto and call their 
own.

Lets face it a game that refers to the angry chords of the 45th century 
guitarist Kensley Charles isn\'t going to mean squat to us, however a 
refrence to the disillusioned angst of the "Smashing Pumpkins" gives us 
something we can all relate to, the music pops into our head, assuming 
we\'ve heard it, Kensley Charles means nothing and conjours no images.

I like it!  The label "Long Night" was put on the period by 3rd

The problem isn\'t the density of the data storage medium it\'s the 
lifespan before that medium is unreadable. The magnetic domains in 
computer tapes "print-through" from layer to layer over time. After 
fifteen to twenty years the amount of "signal" from print-through is 
higher than the noise threshold on the tape. This makes it difficult and 
expensive to read the tape and extract the data from it. This isn\'t a 
problem if you know what\'s on each tape because you can pick and choose 
which tapes to process. But after you\'re gone and the only thing left is 
a box of mag-tapes...

The second problem is data format and it\'s even bigger. In many cases 
tape is easier in this regard because it\'s a serial stream of "words" 
recorded across the tape surface. CD-ROM is harder because it\'s a serial 
stream of bits so the wordsize information is encoded in the CD-ROM 
reader which certainly won\'t exist n * 10^3 years from now. 

Think of it this way. In the year 5700 AD any CD is going to be a 
curious little disk with a very long serial bit stream encoded on a 
piece of aluminum sandwiched between two layers of acrylic plastic. No offense to 
anyones musical taste but without the label and/or a CD-DA/ROM reader, 
how do you tell the difference between "Frampton comes alive" and 
"Project Gutenburg"? Even if they only encoded data on CD-ROM how do you 
tell the difference between "Project Gutenburg" and "Northbrook Vehicle 
taxes assed - 1996"

When you layer on top of this the fact that every CD-ROM that\'s pressed 
isn\'t going to survive from now until the 5th frontier you\'ve got to 
admit that alot of information is going to be lost. 

Now don\'t forget that this assumes that the storage method (CD-ROM/DA 
is just an example) doesn\'t suffer from some sort of bit rot over time 
like magnetic tape does.

Cassette tapes that old are worse. You can hear the print through on a 
twenty year old cassette as noise in between songs where there was

It depends on the storage format of the original material and the 
cost that the vendor of the new information system assigns to data 
conversion. It also depend on whether or not the customer is willing to 
pay the vendor\'s price. This is highly variable. The hospital that I used 
to work for had medical records dating back to 1826. They had on-line 
information dating back to 1987. The online data is simple to convert so 
it stays but the paper information is purged once it\'s confirmed that 
the the patient has died and the info is no longer needed. This is the 
typical case.

Hardcopy records are _currently_ difficult to save. In many cases they 
are not stored on acid free paper so the storage medium itself is 
degrading (like magnetic tapes).

Don\'t confuse indefinitely with infinitely. You are observing a current
law which is up to the whim of the contemporary court system. A reversal
of the decision that this information must be stored "indefinitely" could
result in it\'s lawful erasure on privacy grounds. And there is only a 
finite amount of time and money that we can spend maintaining this 
information. Eventually someone will deem it useless and toss it into the 
cirular file.

Actually I disagree with you a little bit here.  Every bit of 
canonical reference points out to a general disruption of commerce, a 
decline in technology.  Yes, some areas survived as Pocket Empires, 
but I recall Vilani & Vargr stating that Vland even slipped far

Actually, from the way I read what we\'ve been presented by IG, the 
Syleans are the ONLY ones with TL12, giving them some very real 
advantages...

This part is sounds very plausible to me...  The choices presented to 
them in the early years would be join a stellar empire with obvious 
edges in technology and commerce, or get squashed like a bug...

technology or squashed, gee, which is it going to be?

I\'ll take the technology, thanks... :-)

OK, more clarification.  The Labor percent (Avg: 30%) includes Overhead
(Both Corporate and Yard), Engineering, and Actual Construction Crew.  Each
of these four divisions use about 7.5% of the labor cost.  This fixes the
problem I refered to in my last post.

Also, using the Starship Salary rates from the TNE main book, and
considering someone with skill level one as a laboror, and assuming the pay
listed would be 1/3 of someone not serving onboard a ship (with free room
and board) the average dollar value could be converted directly to credits.
I have the calculations if anyone is interested.  (It actually converts to
the low pay in the yard, and the higher skill levels would be payed higher.)

I\'ve figured out the problem.  Most of it came from the fact that Iwas using
the entire 30% for yard laborers working on the vessel rather than the
overhead, engineers and all.  Anyway, I came up with the following figures
for the standard ships in BL.

The Construction Time Column is for a single shift (48hrs/wk, 52wks/yr).
Add 2 Months of Engineering lead time at the beginning of the project.  Add
1/4 of the time for "sea trials" at the end of construction (More for
military vessels).

I\'m working on the rules system to explain Starship construction Costs and
Times, and I\'ll post it as soon as its done.

I bet you that they hold the data until *years* after the patient dies.
If not, they will, first time there\'s a lawsuit and they can\'t produce
the records.

All too true. But businesses count microfilm as "hardcopy". I have a
friend whose job used to be microfilming bank records all day long. And
this was for a medium size "local" bank.

Actually, Lincoln only freed the slaves in the states that had formed
the Confederacy! It was intended as a tactic to help disrupt things
down there. Slaves in states that stayed in the Union weren\'t freed
until *after* the war.

Just off the top of my head, Chamberlain, Churchill, and Thatcher. And
I *think* the current one is Majors.

As for the royals, there\'s Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Phillip, and Prince
Andrew (again just off the top of my head).

I\'m not a history major. But I have a mind that retains trivia, and

ability to produce starships (pretty much any planet which depended
heavily upon imports, since trade was disrupted, and the large scale
economy collapsed).  However, the long night was a political and economic
event.  Any worlds which were in a position to be moderately
self-sufficient could still build starships.  I doubt much knowledge was
lost on many worlds.  Production capacity, sure, but not knowledge.  Also,
the Long Night was *long*.  In the immediate wake of the collapse, when
everyone\'s economy went to hell it\'s easy to imagine that even Vland would
be in sorry enough shape to no longer be producing starships.  Their
economy simply couldn\'t afford it.  However, all their extant ships would
still exist.  I see the Long Night as not only less extreme that the
Virus, but in many ways, as less extreme than the later stages of The
Black War (no one was pounding hundreds of worlds into oblivion at the
beginning of the Long Night). 

Sure, the first few decades of The Long Night would be economic chaos for
everyone, and non-self sufficient worlds would likely die off or collapse
into barbarism.  However, any civilization who survived the first century
would (IMHO) be ready to look beyond the borders of its star system again. 
The whole Gateway sector was colonized during the later part of the Long
Night (and not by the Syleans).  I see lots of folks doing the same thing,
exploration, limited traded, local colonization efforts, but no true
empires, and the constant threat of pirates (ie your unfriendly stellar
neighbors whose worlds also have starships) as well as near total
ignorance as to the current state of other worlds.

I\'d ammend this to the only ones with TL 12 in their immediate area.  The 
Darrians were probably back up to this level, and I\'d imagine that some 
of the worlds near the Solomani Rim were doing equally well.

inspirations and sources for the Imperium.  The authors are helpful, but 
also quite limited.  You have vast stellar empires which are not terribly 
culturally different from the US 1950s/60s.  Also, the focus is primarily
political/military.

I\'ve a few alternative recommendations for folks to look at, for a 
different view.

George R.R. Martin: 

Dying of the Light, Tuf Voyaging, Sandkings, and Nightflyers (the later
three being anthologies).  Dying of the Light, and Tuf Voyaging, as well
as most of the stories in the later two books are set in a mileau which is
*remarkably* similar to the Imperium (mostly human dominated space
recovering form a prior collapse...).  Martin\'s culture\'s and worlds are 
very rich and imaginative.  Each world, and each culture is strange and 
wonderful.

Elucki Bes Shahar: 

Hellflower, Darktraders, and Archangel Blues:  These books are in a
setting which is almost *identical* to the Imperium, however, the plots
involve theft, trade, and intrigue more than war and politics.  Also,
culturally, (and in the details, technologically) this setting is very
different form the modern day, wonderful stuff). 

Joan Vinge:

Snowqueen, World\'s End, Summerqueen:  Wonderful books in a setting which 
has some similarities to the Imperium, and would be great to borrow from. 
Once again, the level of rich detail is wonderful.

Enjoy!

(and add to the list if you wish)

...something about Starships consuming all the jump fuel on the
instant of jump...

>>This is cannon, 

How I hate that term! 

But if you must use it, use it correctly!  A cannon is a large mounted
piece of artillery.  Canon is a law or body of laws...generally of a
church.  The Church of Traveller?  <G>

Now back to Jump Theory....the following is not CANON, it is ERIS! <g>

=================================================================

                    How Jump Drives Work

Jump Drives have two separate components, the Jump Coil and the Jump
Grid.  Both are required for a ship to complete a jump.

The Jump Coil is a large device located somewhere inside the ship.  It
rips an opening between normal space and jump space large enough for a
ship to enter.  The opening persists for less than a minute.  Creating
an opening is an electro-mechanical action that requires a huge amount
of energy in the form of electricity.  Even so this uses only a small
portion of the fuel a ship carries.  Capacitors (or other storage
mechanisms) are often used to build up the required charge needed to
energize the Coil.  Preparing for a jump normally takes several
minutes while the capacitors are charged, the Coil is set in the
correct configuration, and the engineers make sure the electrical and
mechanical components are all working correctly.  Once a ship has
entered jump space the Coil is shut down, cooled and often serviced by
the engineering staff.

The Jump Grid is built into the ship\'s hull.  Its purpose is to
maintain a barrier between jump space and normal space.  This barrier
is required because, as you know, humans (and all known aliens) suffer
madness and death if exposed directly to the effects of jump space.
The Grid is energized before a ship enters jump space, exhibiting the
trademark violet and blue shifting patterns as the ship moves into the
opening into jump space.  The Grid runs continuously while a ship is
in jump space.  The Grid uses a substantial portion of the fuel a ship
carries.  Loss or reduction of power to the Grid is very dangerous,
and its function should be continuously monitored.  Most ships are
built so that the Grid overlaps to compensate for hull or Grid damage.
As you would expect, warships incorporate much more overlap than
civilian ships.

                   Why a Starship Needs Coolant

Starships produce huge amounts of energy as they travel through space.
Most of this energy eventually turns into internal heat that must be
removed to keep the internal temperature at acceptable levels.  Ships
generally regulate internal heat by circulating coolant through large
radiators.  A good deal of this coolant is inevitably vented into
space. Ships in jump space continue to produce heat internally, and
while in jump space they must continue with heat regulation.  In jump
space, as in normal space, the most effective method for cooling the
ship is venting heated coolant.

=================================================================

Like I say above, this is ERIS, ie. it\'s the way I do things.  If you
belong to a different church, feel free to do things differently. <g>

No doubt you\'re right.  If Shakesphere didn\'t write a play about them,
they are a little hard to remember. <g>  

The interesting thing is that Bill\'s stuff was "pop culture" when it
was written.  It would be the 16th century\'s equivilant of "MASH", "LA
Law", and "Star Wars."  I\'d guess several movies and TV shows will
reach classics status..eventually, but I wouldn\'t hazard a guess which
ones.  Maybe "Monty Python" *will* be known in the 57th century...or
maybe it\'ll be "The Young Ones." <g>

METHODS OF CONSTRUCTION

Methods of Construction

Typically there are three methods of construction in shipyards within the
Imperium: Frame Construction, Hull Construction, and Modular Construction.
While each of these types of construction affords certain benefits for
different construction facilities, perhaps the most popular is the Modular
Construction Method.

Frame Construction:  A shipyard using the Frame Construction method
generally will begin construction with the creation of the internal
structure and framing of a starship.  After the basic frame structure is
created, the various components are added in place, and where necessary
floor, wall, and ceiling plates are installed.  When all, or the majority,
of the components are added, they are all connected and the remaining floor,
wall, and ceiling plates are installed.  Finally, the hull is added to the
outside of the structure, and any external components are added.  This
method of construction is particularly useful in the construction of open
frame hulls, small hulls, and hulls with few exterior components.

Hull Construction:  The Hull Construction method is typically used with
military and other government hulls (*1), odd hull configurations, and hulls
with specialized internal designs.  The basic process in this type of
construction is to start with the basic structure of the hull, and add the
internal structure and components as necessary.  With the aid of
anti-gravity technology, the actual hull is held in place until the
appropriate internal structure and armor plating can be added.  Once the
internal structure and additional armor are added, the internal plating
(floor, wall, and ceiling) and the components are added.  Finally the
components are connected and initialized.

        *1 - Typically only military and government hulls that will require the
             installation of components that have been developed secretly for
             the government.

Modular Construction:  Modular Construction is used profitably for any type
of hull, but extremely reduces the cost of standardized hulls.  In Modular
Construction, the base of the hull is laid out, and modules are added as the
hull is built up.  For example, in a simple design, the bottom of the hull
would be manufactured, and teh engineering modules would be added to the
bottom deck, then as the fore and aft hull was being added on, the second
level floor would be added, and on top of it, the quarters modules.
Finally, the hull would be sealed, the components would be connected, and
the hull delivered.  While it is typical for the hull to be created from the
bottom to the top, it is not necessary that it begin with the bottom.  In
fact, some shipyards will only begin a modular construction from the aft.


CONSTRUCTION WORKERS

Welders:  The welder is the worker who adds the final securing to the hull
and internal structure.  After a fitter (see below) has placed the building
materials where they belong, the welder comes in and attaches these
materials with a permanent weld.

Fitters:  Fitters are responsible to place the plate, angle, channel, and
other structural and hull material in the proper place.  Typically the
fitter will secure these pieces with a few plasma welds until the welding
crew comes to finish the welding and secure th peice in place.

Electricians:  Electricians are responsible for running the electrical
cables throughout the ship.  These cables provide both power and data
transfer to and from the systems of the ship.  In addition, the electricians
are responsible for installing the electrical components onboard the ship.

Gravtics:  The gravtic crew is responsible for installing the gravity
systems (both contra gravity lifters and ship gravity) on board the ship
and, in some cases, the maneuver drive.  This crew is also responsible for
connecting these systems to the power and data cables provided by the
electricians.

Engineers:  The engineering crew is responsible for installing and
connecting the remaining systems.  This includes jump drive, power plant,
life support, quarters, hanger, and, on civillian ships, weapons.

Weapons specialists:  On military ships, this crew is responsible for
installing and connecting the weapon system.

Painters:  This crew is responsible for coating the hull (interior and
exterior) with the appropriate color shceme as well as the proper protective
paints.

Material Handlers:  This is the crew that actually gets the material from
its location in storage to the place wher the installation crew needs it.

Foremen:  These are the supervisors.  There are two groups in this heading,
the job foremen and the yard foremen.  The job foremen are assigned to each
hull and responsible for coordinating the construction from start to finish.
The yard are usually assigned to multiple hulls at once and are responsible
for overseeing the various crews in the yard (ie, welding foreman, fitting
foreman).

Laborers:  This crew is assigned as needed to assist the other crews.  Their
responsibility varies from getting welding material to unloading material to
mixing paint.  Typically this crew is responsible for the final clean up on
board a vessel before trials begin.

Architects:  This is the crew that actually designs the ship based on the
customers specifications.  They are responsible for determining the best
system to fit the customers requirements as well as designing the location
of equipment within the customers guidelines.  This crew provides the yard
with the blueprints with which they construct the hull.  This group also
include the specialists who help the customer determine what will work and
what will not work.

Office Employees:  This group includes the purchasing, accounting,
personnel, and management departments.  Also included in this group is the
sales and marketing staff as well as company laywers and project management.


CONSTRUCTION PRICES

Price:  The price listed for starships in most packages is the actual final
price for the vessel.  Typically shipyards will offer a ten percent (10%)
discount for customers willing to use standardized products rather than
specialized equipment.  Many shipyards have also implemented a standard
practice of allowing a twenty-five percent (25%) discount for ships built
using "off-the-shelf" components, that is components that are either in the
shipyard inventory or standard items available within weeks from a vendor.

Cost:  The cost of a starship typically runs between 80% to 95% (Avg: 85%)
of the actual sale price with 25% to 35% (Avg: 30%) for labor and overhead,
and 75% to 65% (Avg: 70%) for materials.  The 30% average for labor is
typically divided evenly between actual yard workers, designer/architect,
yard office, and corporate overhead (each getting 7.5%).  Here is a simple
breakdown of the starship cost:

     Cost Breakdown:
             Labor                      
                         Job Labor -  7.5%
                  Design/Architect -  7.5%
                     Yard Overhead -  7.5%
                Corporate Overhead -  7.5%
             Total Labot                        30%
             Material                           70%
                                              ----
             Total Cost                        100%


CONSTRUCTION TIME

In a typical shipyard, working 48 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, operating
only one shift, the construction time for a starship can be calculated using
the following formula:

        Tc = (.208 * P)/(D^0.5)

        Where:  Tc = Construction Time in Years
                 D = Displacement Tons
                 P = Price in MCr

To this figure, add .16 years for typical design time.  For civillian ships,
typical trials time will be twice the displacement divided by one hundred
months.  Military ships use the same formula only using four times the
displacement.  The formula for the number to add to construction time is:

        Tt = ((F * D)/100)/12

        Where:  Tt = Trials time in years
                 F = Multiple factor (2 for Civillian, 4 for Military)
                 D = Displacement Tons

The final time from contract signing to delivery of a starship would be:

        T = .16 + Tc + Tt

        Where:   T = Total time in years (contract to delivery)
                Tc = Construction time in years
                Tt = Trials time in years

These formula assume a single shift 48 hour work week and an average pay of
13Cr per hour in the yard.  It also assumes a 52 week per year schedule.  If
additional shifts are added (up to three shifts), simply divide the Tc
(Construction time) number by the number of shifts used.  Trials and Design
are not effected by additional shifts.

If any of the other factors are changed (ie, hours/work week, weeks/year, or
average hourly rate), the formula will not work.  As these are the averages,
this will be the typical time throughout the Imperium; however, if any of
these norms change, the following extended method can be used to determine
the construction time:

Step            Action                                  Result

 1.             Multiply 90% (or cost percent) by 
                 7.5% (or labor cost percentage) to
                 determine Job direct labor cost 
                 factor.                                Labor Cost Factor

 3.             Divide Labor cost factor by 1,000,000
                 then again divide by 13 (or average 
                 yard hourly rate) to determine man-
                 hour factor.                           Man-Hour Factor

 4.             Divide man-hour factor by 48 (or
                 number of hours worked per week) to
                 determine man-week factor.             Man-Week Factor

 5.             Divide man-week factor by 52 (or
                 number of weeks worked per year) to
                 determine man-year factor.             Man-Year Factor

             This number is:  the number of years it would take one man, or
                              the number of men it would take one year
                to build the ship, and must be adjusted based on the number of
                workers able to work on the ship at one time.

 6.             Determine the square root of the
                 displacement tons.                     Crew Factor

 7.             Multiply crew factor by 10 to
                 determine the maximum crew able to
                 work on the ship at one time.          Max Crew

             The initial formula for Construction Time is the Price of the
ship times the man-year factor divided by the max crew.  Again this is for
one shift, for more shifts divide the construction time by the number of shifts.

This just proves you are *not* average, which probably holds for
everyone on this list!  The *current* royals are easier, as they are
media targets.  Can you name the royals since say Queen Victoria, or
Henry VIII (please don\'t, I\'m just pointing out that naming them is a
long way from knowing anything about them).  What did Augustus or
Octavius actually do?  The point is that even if such information is
preserved into the 57th century (a debate I *do not* want to get
involved in) almost no one will care enough to learn. and schools will
have more important things to teach!

Someone said "neither will the UK" in response to my point that the
USA didn\'t exist in the 57th century.  I agree, I don\'t even expect
the UK to last long into the 21st century.  This wasn\'t my point - it
was the assumption that all Imperial citizens would know what was
essentially history trivia of some little nation of only 500 million
people, which ceased to exist in any meaningful sense millenia before
- - this, to my mind, showed a certain lack of realisation of quite how
distant the Imperium was from Terra today in terms of both time and
physical scales.  I also agree that references to contempory culture
etc. *do* provide a reference point, but I prefer references that are
seriously warped from reality as we (most of us) see it (a la "Saint
Elvis") - warped by both time and the different perspective of
Imperial citizens.

"Terran history in the 20th century was an ongoing series of
world-wide civil wars, with generals such as Churchill, Stalin, and
Kennedy fighting for control of the United Nations.  Some scholars
have attributed the rise in technology over that period to the
constant need to arm and cope with the consequences of numerous civil
wars, although this view has been discredited by Mattitian
sociopolitical theory.  This period is viewed as the end of the
`Terran Dark Ages\', prior to the `Golden Interstellar Age\' staring in
the 21st Century."

The writings of say Lincoln, or the speaches of Churchill may still
exist, but they will be interpreted in a modern context, and so
certainly not understood as they were at the time.  The writings in
the Bible, which are to some degree an historical account, are not
wholly understandable, and often it appears to contradict itself.  The
problem isn\'t only keeping a faithful record, but also the correct
understanding.

"Government of the People, for the People, by the People".  Did
Strephon really understand this in the same way as we think we do?
His government relied on inherited power, and provided an independence
to the nobility which in no way ensured fair government for his
subjects.  He refused Dulinor\'s democratic reforms (hence the
assasination), and whil he may have been right that the Imperium
wasn\'t ready for, he couldn\'t really believe (as suggested in Survival
Margin) that his empire related to Lincoln\'s view of government.  The
words may be remembers, even the achievements of those who said them,
but the understanding will change.

Hmm.. okay, yes there was a George V and a George VI.

William I-IV. William I was William the Conqueror, William II was not long
after, Willaim III was William of William and Mary, William IV was just
before Victoria. All being well, Prince William will become William V.
There was also a Stephen not long ofter William I. William I himself beat
Harold. Queen Anne was the daughter of William and Mary.

Lots of Henrys, and Mary was the daughter of Henry VIII (who wasn\'t
beheaded - that was Mary, Queen of Scots, beheaded by Elizabeth I, Henry
VIII\'s other
daughter).

Plenty of Edwards too, VIII of them.

There were 2 Charles, Charles I was beheaded by Cromwell, Charles II
defeated Cromwell\'s bunch and restored the Monarchy. Cromwell could have
become Oliver I had he wanted, but he refused the crown.

There were 3 Richards, the third of whom was beaten by Henry Tudor at Bosworth,
who them became Henry VII.

The James. There were 2 of these, but it gets a bit complicated here. James I
of England was James VI of Scotland, and James II of England was James VII of
Scotland. This also leads to Elizabeth II of England being Elizabeth I of
Scotland. James II was overthrown by William of Orange, who became William III
when he married Mary.

There has never been a historically documented Arthur, and there\'s never likely
to be another one, as every time the heir to the throne has been called
Arthur he\'s died before ascending the throne. As a result, it\'s considered
a very unlucky name for a royal. THE Arthur was probably a Romano-British
war-leader who resisted the invasion of the Saxons. Most of the romantic
legends are probably Breton in origin (Brittany in France being Lesser Britain,
as opposed to Great Britain).

Prince Albert was the only Prince Regent; Prince Phillip is the Duke of
Edinburgh.

Have I missed anyone out? If I have, my apologies, I\'m am engineer, not a
historian. :)

Some people have a problem with the physics of certain things in
Traveller - I have a huge problem with this.  Three and a half thousand
years of development, contact with a variety of alien races, intermixing
with a variety of human races, all with different cultural and historical
backgrounds - and the predominant culture is \'similar\' to late C20
America?  Please!  This makes virus look like a well thought out,
likely and consistent plot development.

I never got the impression from CT that this was the case, but it certainly
seemed to come out in the TNE materials I read, and I think that it
was one of the weakest parts of the mileu.  This isn\'t for any anti-US
reasons, just for reasons of credibility and believability.  The authors
of Traveller may well be late C20 Americans, but then the majority of
SF writers are late C20 Americans, and that doesn\'t stop some of them
producing believable, interesting yet different far future cultures.

Oh come on!  The Imperium numbers some 11,000 worlds. Many
Imperials will be of Vilani or mixed Vilani/Solomani descent.  Many of
those who are of Solomani descent who are able to or willing to trace
their cultural ancestry will be from non-American stock.  Nearly FOUR
millenia will have passed since today.  I would suggest that the vast
majority of Imperial citizens would have no knowledge of the US\'
existence.  Why would somebody whose ancestors have been living
on world x for 2000 years be bothered about the early history of one of
the nations which was part of UNSCA which eventually became the
Terran Confederation etc etc.

There probably would be a few specialised historians who would be
historians of pre-spaceflight Terra.  But not many.  The average
Imnperial historian would be much more interested in the history of
their world, their subsector,their sector, their Imperium, than they would
be in that of a pre-spaceflight nation on Terra.

   I tried to pattern the stats as closely as possible after the work done
in The Regency Sourcebook (with one notable exception, see below),
the gold standard IMHO (if only they hadn\'t tried to cram 112 pages of
material into 96....eeech!), and previous classic GDW Traveller
publications.

   The concept here is that we\'ll give you enough stuff up front to get you
started, then continue to present material down the road.  The
concentration initially will be on the New Era setting, but other additional
material for the Second Solomani Rim War, Year Zero, etc. will also be
included as time/space/Kevin Knight\'s budget permits.

   Mechanics-wise, the vehicles and equipment will be FF&S based.
As Imperium Games publishes modified design sequences for T4, I\'ll
endeavor to convert everything to the new standard, and present new
T4-based designs as well.

   It was a concept I felt strongly enough about to continue developing,
even as GDW slid into oblivion.

   This explanation is the one presented in the Vampire Fleets
sourcebook.  I of course expanded upon it somewhat in creating the
description for the remainder of the subsector.

   I\'m glad you enjoyed TTC #10.

   For those of you who are interested in meeting the author of Children
of Earth, I\'ll be at Gen Con this year checking out the Imperium Games
booth and participating at many of the Traveller events.  I hope to see
you there, even if the whole convention is controlled by the Evil Empire
(tm)  (aka TSR).

   Also, someone has pointed out that the 1202 world UWP stats appear
above the 1117 stats, and that in other GDW publications (most notably
the Regency Sourcebook), when dual stat listings were used, that the
1117 stats appeared above the 1201 stats.

   While I apologize if there was confusion on anyone\'s part, this was
an area where I departed from the RSB standard.  IMHO, ergonomically
having the 1202 stat on the same line as the rest of the UWP information
makes it easier to read, particularly if you are interested in what the stats
are *now*, and the 1117 stats are of secondary interest/importance.

   And here we are in the 20th century, some 2000 years later, after
contact (and mixing) with a variety of other human cultures and
races, all with different cultural and historical backgrounds--and yet we
still quote Julius Caesar.  For that matter we still quote Moses, and he
dates back some 3500 years, give or take.

   Discounting ``Sneaks and Geeks``, for apparent reasons, the rest of
the TNE material is no more or less riddled with American references
than say, any of the material published from 1982 to 1992.

   The majority of science-fiction writers produce material that is no more
or less riddled with Anglocentric remarks than Traveller is.  A few, very
good writers have been able to create material that transcends the
limitations placed on us by our background and environment.  The few
very good writers out there do not write for RPGs, at least not for very
long.

   They would, for the same reasons that people in the US and Brazil
have knowledge of Ancient Greece or Egypt.  They might not know all
the particulars, and they probably get some very basic facts wrong,
but they would know that there was this thing called the `United States`
or more likely just `America` on Earth a *long* time ago.

   Fortunately or unfortunately, the United States of America is currently
*the* predominate cultural and political power of Earth, has been since
1945, and will continue to be so well into the 21st century.  After that,
how knows?  But try to find a corner of the planet where you can\'t find
a picture of Walt Disney cartoon  character in someone\'s possession.
Or a rock-n-roll recording.  Or American cigarette (probably being used
as a form of currency).  

   Anyway, the US is the Athens of this era.  While we managed to
defeat our version of Sparta (the USSR), and didn\'t engage it in open
warfare (thank God), because of our status, we will be remembered
for many millennia to come.

   The UK?  ``They were a power that pre-dated America by some years,
in fact the original Americans were UK colonists.  Eventually the
Americans revolted and established their own government.  It wasn\'t
until sometime later, after the Americans increased in power and the UK
began to decline, that the Americans and the UK became friends and
allies against a series of tyrannical enemies that arose on Earth during
the chaotic 20th century.``

   If you were a professor at a university in the Third Imperium and one
of your undergrad students gave that as an answer to the above
question, you would be happy he or she knew so much about that
aspect of ancient history.  You further suspect that the student was
of Solomani heritage.

>There probably would be a few specialised historians who would be
>historians of pre-spaceflight Terra.  But not many.

   We could argue over the numbers, but my guess is that there will be
more pre-spaceflight Terran historians than Old Earth Union historians,
if for no other reason that the pre-spaceflight era was just so darn
interesting in comparison.  World Wars, brink of nuclear holocaust and
all that.  On the other hand, I\'m sure that there will be a much larger
number of Sylean/early Third Imperium historians, as their early history
would be of more relevance to modern Imperials.

>The average Imperial historian would be much more interested in the
>history of their world, their subsector,their sector, their Imperium, than

   I don\'t disagree here (as noted above), it\'s just that it would appear
from canon that the people of the Third Imperium have empathy for the
nation-state known as America.  If my explanation isn\'t satisfactory,
then there has to be another besides ``it isn\'t possible``.

Of course, a great deal of information will be lost. The point is
that a great deal of information, especially important things like
great literary works and "accumulated knowledge", will not be lost.

High-density media will virtually guarantee that *somebody* will
take the time to keep a current copy of this data. Also, it makes
it worth your while to take the time to decode old media if there
was a lapse for some reason. Also, if there is lapse (for example
due to a war), people will likely be taking time *afterwards* to
recover a great deal of this "lost information", so the format of
the data will be known anyway.

However, even if you needed to decode a 20th century CD-ROM which
was somehow intact (frozen in dry ice?), it really would not be
*that* hard to do. Analysis under a microscope makes it obvious
that the data is stored as "pits" in a circular fashion. The data
structure can easily be detected by looking for patterns. Even
the 8-bit ASCII character set can be easily determined using some
simple cryptographic methods (the same goes for compressed data,
images, etc). So if you had a copy of Grolier\'s Encyclopedia, you
can at least figure out what *data* is on it. What you do with a
3700-year-old copy of Windows 95 is your problem, though. :-) :-)

  Actually, this is one of the reasons I liked GDW\'s 2300AD so much.  By 
setting things three hundred years in the future, one could logically 
postulate a linkage to present-day culture and political forms, with some 
odd changes (the French as the dominant world power!?).  You\'re right, it 
doesn\'t work as well for TNE.

  I feel the need to disagree, at least with respect to Millieu 0.  It 
has not been long since Europeans (and Americans for that matter) spent a 
large amount of time studying Greek and Roman language and history.  In 
the United States, at least, some degree of mastery of Latin was required 
to enroll in college until the late 19th Century - the rise of 
engineering is really what did that in finally.  I remember being taught 
latin and greek roots in high school so as to prepare for language 
tests, and there are some schools (mostly Catholic ones) that still 
stress latin and greek in their curriculum.

  Why did this situation come about?  Prior to the late 19th Century, 
Roman civilization and Roman civil engineering were in evidence all 
around.  As European societies expanded and organized themselves, they 
did so in the shadow of a Roman empire that had spanned a greater area 
than any one country, and that had moreover managed to build civil works 
(walls, aqueducts, roads) that outmatched anything contemporary society 
could accomplish.

  To my mind, the Syleans are in much the same situation.  As they expand 
to the stars, everywhere they are reminded that they are not the first, 
that the First Imperium and the Rule of Man preceeds them.  Moreover, I 
would imagine that engineers would study old records for a hint on what 
could be done and how to do it.  To my mind, Sylean exploration teams 
would include data-recovery specialists, trained in the operation and 
interpretation of First Imperium records.

  As a result, the history of the First Imperium and the Folks from Terra 
who Ended Their Glorious Rule will probably be a part of the average history
curriculum in Millue 0, or even later.  Of course, by the time period of 
Classic Traveller, much of that history has probably been cut out of the 
curriculum, to make room for the study of all those Emperors of the Flag.

The North Pier is a big building just north of the Loop that houses a

each other on the surface in battle suits.  Then you can watch it on video.

One of the things which the MT collapse supplement ("Hard Times" ?) 
pointed out was how many planets are dependent on off-world 
technology or off-world resources. Many TL 6-8 worlds are going to be 
borderline at best when it comes to sustaining their life support 
systems. Many non-agricultural worlds are going to have problems 
supporting themselves (dependent on food imports). Also, many 
low-population planets which lose contact with the local starfaring 
culture are going to be in serious trouble -- think of the problems 
they will have with a limited gene pool (interesting adventure 
scenarios: think of "Deliverance"). Milieu 0 explorers are likely to
find quite a few dead worlds, with ruined settlements.

True, but they might not remember all of this well enough to teach it 
in year 0.  Remember that its been 18-1900 years since the Syleans 
were in contact with Terra at Year 0.  Also, I would suspect the 
emphasis in study for most people is going to be on the period 
beginning with 1st contact for the Terrans, and the Interstellar 
Wars.

Your right here MedicoLegal had some say in how long the information 
was kept after the patient had died. I think it was in the 
neighborhood of seven years because after that time it was difficult 
if not near impossible to sue the hospital. The amount of time 
doesn\'t matter. The point is that people stayed at our facility in 
1826 but no-one there could tell you anything about them because in 
nearly eveyone\'s opinion that information was without value and but it 
cost\'s money (warehouse space) to keep and maintain.

This is true too but how long does information on microfilm last before 
it has to put on another media. Will microfilm last 3700 years or will 
someone have to take the volumes of data that on it and convert it to 
something else every couple of hundred years. Going back to my hospital 
keeping the medical records of people who attended in 1899 isn\'t 
necessary because: They\'re not going to sue and the art of medicine was 
so primitive back then that we don\'t think that we are going to learn 
anything from it. Given that it cost $25.00 / square foot for warehouse 
space (cool and dry to reduce degradation) the business decision is to 
throw that information away. This is model that I think most things will 
go by. It\'s harder to envision this happening to the government and 
historical information but that\'s because over our lifetime the 
Government of the United States is a very stable entity and will perceive 
some value in maintaining its history. Some time after that changes, some 
time after the U.S. Government goes away by whatever means the 
details of the history of this regime will be lost. In 3700 years 
historical scholars will be able to figure out that the United States 
existed and who the president was in 1963. But this information won\'t be 
required reading for every Imperial Citizen and it won\'t be the easiest 
information to find either.

I would moderate my position slightly with regard to milieu zero.  My
original posting was referring to the New Era, and I would stand by
my assertions fully in regard to that.  I do feel that even in Milieu 0 the
history and pop culture of the US would be less important than you
believe.  The twin foundations of \'Western Culture\' have for centuries
been defined as the culture of the Greeks and Romans.  These
cultures are far  more important to our development on this small
world than that of one nation of a balkanised world in an Imperium
of many many others, large numbers of whom owe their culture and
history to the Vilani, not the Solomani.

Even many citizens of the Imperium with Solomani roots will feel that
they owe their allegiance, history and culture to their home planet,
not to where their gene stock originally came from.  We are all
descended from Mitochondrial Eve who bounced about the
Kenyan or Tanzanian plains at some point - how many of us owe
our sense of identity to Africa, rather than the US, UK, Canada or
elsewhere?

Simply because the US is the dominant power, and American pop
culture is to a large extent world culture at the present, doesn\'t mean
that this is what will pass on to our far descendents as representation
of Terran culture.  150 years ago Great Britain was THE dominant
world power, with perhaps greater (certainly more direct) sway over
the world than the US has now.  Now we are a small, reasonably
successful island state, with an international importance that probably
owes more to our past than our present, and a lot of mad cows.

150 years before that the Spanish and the Dutch were major world
powers, etc etc.  I would expect any Terran popular culture which
passes on into the future firstly to be mutated almost beyond
recognition, and secondly to owe its origins to a polyglot, polycultural
world.

I would still argue that any histories of Terra taught to non-specialists
would concentrate on Terra\'s role after first contact, and would be unlikely
to delve into the early presidents of one of its nations (which is where
this thread started).  Of course, future history is probably likely to prove
us all wrong. ("Few 20th century analysts could have predicted the
amazing rise to world domination of the Glorious Belgian Empire, and
the rapid Belgification of global culture..")

Although it\'s not much to go on, there is some evidence that Terran culture
will continue to have a major influence on Imperial culture as a whole.  The
official language of the Imperium, and one that is spoken and understood by
all starfarers (and a majority of it\'s citizens, at least according to all
available evidence) is "Galanglic" - a descendant of modern English.

How close Galanglic is to English is debatable, but from the available
evidence (not much, unfortunately) modern English is at least as
understandable to Imperials as Chaucer is to present-day readers.

On the other hand, Great Britain has had a large influence on the cultural
background of all of the English-speaking countries of the world.
Shakespeare, Dickens, Conan-Doyle, Gilbert and Sullivan.  The King James
version of the bible, even.   By the time of the Imperium, perhaps old
Terran works will be more a matter of curiosity (and modern
"interpretations") than popular culture - on the other hand, there are
several different copies of Beowulf in print right now!

It\'s a known fact that at least some of CS Lewis\' works survive into the
world of Traveller - because that\'s the origin of the term "Aslan" for a
certain race of aliens.  I can\'t imagine that Tolkien (for example), will
ever go out of print, and I\'m sure that others can think of a long list of
other works that will remain in print for as long as there are people to
read them.  While perhaps not so politically important, culturally the
influence extends as far as the English language.

So, I can see a lot of reason for there to be influences from current
popular culture - on the other hand, I think those influences should be
subtle and not overdone (and it\'s very easy to over-do this).

The easy answer is playability, but I see that as a cop-out.  Most players

other fantasy settings with extremely foreign cultures.  Why must SF look

True.  Many people may quote (or misquote..) Julius Caesar, albeit some
without realising it.  That is not necessarily the same as knowing the
history of the Roman Empire.  And I\'m sure that many people are
familiar with the characters from the bible without knowing much about
the history of the Middle East.  But don\'t forget that we\'re all on the one
planet here - would someone who has been living on one of thousands
of other worlds whose ancestry is maybe predominantly Vilani be as
interested?

I\'d agree that this is possible.  My original posting was in response to

I think pretty unlikely.

I wouldn\'t argue with that either.  It\'s just that I believe that the US is 
a
great power among many, preceded by some, undoubtedly
followed by others.  In a believable science-fiction setting many
years in the future I\'d expect to see a culture influenced by many, or
at least several of these powers, rather than one.

Alas, the fate of a once proud nation.  To be considered only as

If any historian of pre-spaceflight Terra was examining remaining archives
of the first primitive computer networks and found somebody\'s copies
of the TML they\'d get a shock.  Nostradamus wouldn\'t have a patch on
us.

If canon is what is produced by GDW then canon states that after the
introduction of the Virus (see flame wars passim for arguments about
its unfeasibility) multi-mega-credit sophisticated FTL spaceships
were flung into the mathematically and topographically complexities
of j-space and emerged at their destinations parsecs away by crew
members shouting Red Thirteen Blue Four down the Far Future
equivalent of speaking tubes to each other...

I wouldn\'t say that the people of an 11,000 world sociologically
complex state some three thousand years in the future (with a
mix of ancestry that includes Vilani as well as Solomani) having
a particular empathy for the 20th century nation state of the US
was impossible.  I would say that the likelihood of it puts many
of the arguments about the likelihood or not of the physics behind
much of the Traveller technology into the shade.

I don\'t intend any disrespect to the US or any of its citizens on the
mailing list by my arguments.  I think maybe being British gives me
quite a good perspective of the transience of power and cultural
dominance...

I don\'t think pre-starfaring Terra would be taught as "history\'" at all. It
would
be taught as an entirely different subject, the 57thC equivilent of Classics
or Antiquities, perhaps even Archeology.
What is taught as history tends to break down into three major groupings:
    1) Local history - i.e. a child on Regina will learn of the colonisation of
Regina, the development of the colony, how it\'s social systems evolved etc.
    2) Case studies - These are studies of how other cultures have dealt with
common problems. Thus in high school in New Zealand I studied the history
of Ireland as a case study in conflict.
    3) Background history - This is basically local history given a deeper and
wider coverage. Thus our Regina school child might learn of the colonisation
of the Spinward Marches, the development of the Imperium, the social changes
brought about by the Civil War etc.

Almost all of what is taught before tertiary level is either local history or
case studies. Obviously, unless the history is being taught on or near
Terra, local history will not concern itself with Terra. Case studies tend
to restrict themsleves to the previous 100-200 years so as to remain
culturally relevant.

So this leaves only background history to concern itself with 20thC Terra.
However I don\'t think it would. Background history concentrates on how
past trends have influenced modern culture. The Long Night provides a
logical break, much as the fall of the Western Roman Empire does now
to act as a starting point for History.

Here I disagree. While I would think that the study of 20thC Terra (and the
Terran Confederation, Rule of Man and Ziru Sirka) would not be classified
as history. I think 19thC and 20thC Terra would be quite a popular period
to cover. Primarily because of the rapid rate of change during this period. One
only has to look at the rate of technological change, from TL3 to TL8 in
200 years whereas the Imperium has only managed from TL12 to TL15 in
over 1000 years.

I also think that 20thC Terran history would be widely though very very
superficially know in the 57thC. Since it would not be history as such, it would
be free from the political overtones that invariably go with "history". It would
have become as much a part of their pop culture as classical Greece and
Rome have of ours (Can just see the holo series now "The legendary
adventures of J.F.K." or even "Maggie Thatcher, Warrior Princess").

Hm. Well, as I was re-reading \'Solomani\' last night... The Syleans
were largely of Solomani origin. Sylea was one of the final capitals
of the Rule of Man, thus justifying Cleon\'s formation of the Third
Imperium.

Anyhow, \'Solomani\' states that a large part of the Imperial Nobility
and most of it\'s Naval Officers of the Flag are _pure Solomani_.
Even in 5700+AD they can still trace their heritage back to Terra
for _every single ancestor_!!! If they\'re this obsessed about
racial purity in the very diverse 3rd Imperium, in the 58th century,
they must still be pretty hot to trot for Terran history. Heck,
even the Emperors were pure Solomani until the mid 600\'s when one
of them married a Viliani woman. Under the Rule of Man, Viliani
nobles took Solomani names to fit in better with the new power structure.
No doubt the Viliani, who loooove all things old, all brushed up
on their Terran history in an interesting blend of cultures.

I think the Rule of Man, short though it was, left a pretty considerable
mark on the universe. Traveller is maybe more Terran-centric
than we think...

America. Considering the distances and lack of instant communication (FTL

expansion from 1850-1900 A.D.. 
 Example: Many Germans settled in the area of Milwaukee, with them they
brought their language, culture and politics. They had a common language of
English with Americans outside of Milwaukee, but in Milwaukee, among their
own community, they still spoke German. The only reason German culture has
been reduced in influence is it\'s direct exposure to American Culture (The
Mix) for an extended and continuous period of time. 
 Now imagine if Milwaukee was a planet on the fringe of the Imperium. Changes
in the Imperium; Styles, entertainment, and Ganglic slang would take a year
at minimum to work it\'s way out to the Isolated planet of Milwaukee. 
 The Isolation then becomes more then distance, it becomes cultural.
Milwaukee ends up building it\'s culture that is based on their German orgins,
other planets nearby, a slight Imperial Influence and on what they need to
develop in the face of changes on the local level (Events and Environment).
This being true for 11,000 seperate systems, I would think that only a
handful universal cultural characteristics would exist in the Imperium unlike
the nearly universal cultural characteristics in the U.S..

An alternate explanation exists: I believe "Aslan" is Turkish for "lion" 
(or so Loren Wiseman explained, IIRC).  A quick Web search via Altavista
turns up Ismail Aslan, assistant head of the (pro-Kurdish) Turkish People\'s
Democracy Party, and a Turkish librarian named Huryasa Aslan, so it\'s
certainly a regionally correct name.  We already know that many ethnic
types from Earth strove mightily to preserve non-Anglic language and
cultures.  So I don\'t see anything odd with a far-future Turk being one
of the first-out scouts spinward from Terra at first contact.

The \'different squints\' method is quite okay today - eyetracking as a computer
input is what my PhD thesis was about. Just look at an icon to activate it,
none of this keyboard business. Of course there are still problems, but I won\'t
bore you all with a diatribe on them here. :)

Interestingly enough, speech therapists are beginning to see a new problem
being refered to them. People are arriving with voice strain due to operating
speech recognition systems. Think of it this way, if you\'re operating a computer
by speech alone, you\'re putting vour voice to under a lot of stress, using it
far more than normal, so it starts to cause problems. And what do you do if
you lose your voice? How do you operate your machine then?

Overall I think that we\'re still likely to have keyboards of some sort, although
not the qwerty design we\'re used to at present. Intelligent predictive
systems will minimise the amount of typing that needs to be done, but the
fingers will still be the main input medium.

related items for a reasonable price...  :-)

1 of them I picked up I already had.  I bought it with the intention 
of giving 1 of you fine folks an opportunity to add it to your 
collection for what should be a fairly reasonable price...  :-)
The item in question is the CT campaign, The Traveller Adventure, by 
Marc Miller...

The book itself is in good to very good condition.  The only visible 
wear is a bit of fraying along the edges of the spine...  The binding however is 
intact, and I suspect that somebody used it a few times to run the 
campaign, then resold it...

My intention is to put it up for auction.  I am not here to rape 
people though, so I intend to conduct the auction in the following 
manner:

1) I will be accepting 1 bid and 1 bid only from each person!  Make 
your first bid the most you would be willing to pay for this 
wonderful campaign...

2) Minimum bid shall be $10 US (which is what I paid for it...)  Bids 
shall be taken in $1 intervals only.  If you don\'t want to pay $10, don\'t 
bother sending e-mail to me...

3) Bids will not include shipping.  US customers can expect $3 for 
priority mail, maybe slightly less if book rate or something of that nature.  
International customers, I\'d need to find out at a later time.

4) Payment may be by money order, or check (US customers only).  
Money orders I\'ll ship out as soon as I receive them, checks will 
wait 2 weeks to clear...

5) All bids should be sent to me at:

For the sake of bandwidth, absolutely NO bids will be accepted 
that are sent to the mailing list...

6) I reserve the right to change or modify the rules to this auction

Don\'t be too literal -- "Saint Elvis of Terra" could refer to an  
entirely different person by that name such as: 
 
Elvis Larson, founder of the Society for True Humanity, 
a spiritual/self-improvement movement popular during the period 
of the Nth Interstellar Wars. Depending on the local activists, 
the movement was part religion, part philosophy, and part scam. 
The scams died out, the philosophy was absorbed into later 
movements, and the religious aspects fragmented and formed the 
basis for numerous local religions throughout the Solomani 
Sphere and regions of Solomani expansion (including the Imperium). 
Many of the religious sects canonized Larson as "Saint Elvis". 
Due to the fragmented nature of the religion, local practices 
vary in the extreme, often quite contradictory to practices 
on other worlds.

Ah, now then (he says, finally delurking about nothing to do directly with
Trav at all. Tsk. Typical.), a few years ago I saw a televison item about an
airline that was experimenting with a voice recognition system to handle
telephone bookings. It was doing very well taking the booking details during
a demonstration until, as an experiment, the caller deliberately sneezed
violently. There was a pause and then the computer blithely booked the
flight for Tuesday.

The problem is, there are *very* few games (especially successful ones)
that *really* use a different culture. Most players *do* play those
other cultures as being just "our" culture, perhaps with a few rules
changed. 

So at least the "core" culture needs to be familiar. For the other
cultures, the problem becomes detailing them. Look at what it takes to
detail a culture such as Tekumel, Glorantha, or whatever.

While I don\'t have a definitive answer, I rather suspect that microfilm
is *at least* as durable as paper, if not more so. Given "reasonable"
storage conditions, the means of degradation I see as most likely are:

1. oxidation (*very* slow, acetate film is damn stable)
2. migration of dye (the "dye" that the film uses may slowly migrate
   over time)
3. adhesion/bonding (the adjacent pieces of film may adhere if kept in
   contact long enough)

I\'m guessing that these would be stable over 500-1000 year periods. And
given that they were incorporated in some deliberate "time capsules", I
suspect that they are thought to be good for even longer.

Of course, if the data is on microfiche it\'ll take up a *lot* less
space. You get what? 200 pages per fiche?

Barring some *major* disaster, I think that newspapers and magazines
(on microfiche) will survive in the libraries. And given the interest
that sociologists and even anthropologists show in stuff that\'s only a
hundred or so years old, I expect that the data will be converted to
"modern" storage every so often. If only by research assistants to a
person doing his Phd on "sports trends in the United States of America
(19th through 24th cent.)"

They\'ll be able to read Time, Newsweek, The New York Times, The London
Times, etc for the whole of their existence.

Depends. I rather expect that any of it that has been converted to
"modern" storage will be readily available *if* you care to look.
"Periodicals, Terran, 20th century, nation, ....."

And given the sheer *number* of scholars needing *something* to do
research on, I rather expect that much of the data will be converted to
"modern" storage formats. I also expect that much of the conversion
will have been done by scanning the originals, and then using text
recognition algorithms on the scans. Which could lead to some
interesting errors untill and unless someone *familiar* with the
language of the period compares the scan and the "text" extracted from
it. Ditto for what will happen to images digitized at the wrong
resolution (you would not *believe* what can happen to a halftoned
image if scanned at the "right" wrong resolution)

   Fair enough, and as I cannot currently read the author\'s mind, nor have
engaged him in conversation about the subject, you could be right.

   But, when one evokes the name Elvis, no last name, just Elvis, it is
assumed you\'re talking about Elvis Presley--not Elvis Grbeck of the
American football San Francisco 49ers, or Elvis Costello, rock-n-roll
star.  You could say that when a 57th century person hears the name
they immediate think of the religious leader, but remember that the author
is writing for 20th century readers while pretending to be writing for
ones in the 57th century.  To use Elvis\' name in that manner while
making reference to someone else entirely would be confusing.

   If I\'m not mistaken, isn\'t there a St. Elvis of Terra reference in ``Survival
Margin`` that quotes a line from the song ``Suspicious Minds``?  I\'m pretty
sure there is.

Regards,

Harold

Let me be clear: "Elvis Larson" is my own invention of 
who Strephon was talking about. 
 
_DAve Nilsen_ was obviously referencing Presley, but it was

Actually, a J-torp doesn\'t need to be NEARLY that large.  That 15 ton figure includes fuel,
controls, power plant, and just about everything needed to have a miniature little starship.  For
not much more, you could add crew, a fixed mount weapon, and a little bunk: PRESTO you have
a miniature little jump capable fighter craft.  Someone ought to design one of these, just for kicks.
:) Sort of the Traveller version of the X-Wing fighter.

But a J-torp needn\'t be nearly this complex.

All you need is a little computer and a jump drive.  No power plant or fuel is needed.  The drive\'s
capacitors are charged by the launching vessel, which also imparts inertia to the torp through its
launching mechanism.  Once it reaches it comes in-system at the target location, it can sit around
like a little Nav buoy and wait to be picked up by dedicated tender vessels.  The end result is a
replacement of the generic X-boat courier line with unmanned J-torp message couriers.

A device like this would have tons of drawbacks.  For military courier use, its basically worthless
since its unsecure and not tactical (bad idea to send one of these to communicate with someone
hiding in an enemy system).  They\'d be nice for launching as a log buoy in the event of some
catastrophic emergency on the starship.  The sheer size of one of these things (still in the 5-10 ton
range) means that only larger vessels are likely to carry any at all, particularly since the launching
mechanism has to be custom designed into the starship as well.  Only the larger ships of the line
are likely to carry more than a small handful (2-4) of these things.  Like the X-boat, J-torps
require dedicated tender vessels to care for them.  Just about anything with a cargo bay might
concievably pick up one of the things, and maintenance could be done in the cargo bay, but
getting the thing back into its launcher tube would be tricky, and best performed in port (unless
you\'re a tender, cu!
 stom designe
   d for the mission of
 launching and retrieving drone J-torps.

Without much extra work, a drone could be designed that has just enough of a robotic brain to
fire some simple thrusters and home in on a target planet.  Designed with an airfoil, some terminal
guidance software, and a little turbine engine all you need is a warhead to create a J-Tomahawk
cruise missile.  Such nightmarish devices could (in sufficient numbers) be the scourge and plague
of inhabited systems throughout the universe.  Of course the only reason those goofy Vampire
Fleets don\'t just annihilate all human life in the former Imperium is because they don\'t have the
manufacturing capability to produce such weapons, since Imperial shipyards all conform to the
100ton limit.  Still, 100tons of automated Scout/Courier hell could carry one enormous fusion
warhead (strip fuel, vehicle, and crew space, charge Jump capacitors externally, and fill all
remaining space with one incredible bomb).

Hmm . . . does anyone remember Darkstar?  :)

     Um, well...no.  It\'s not.  Not by a long shot.  I work at a data
center that, among other things, does COM (Computer Originated Microfilm
[and fiche]).  We recently got some ten-year-old fiche in to be
duplicated (masters are archived--duplicates are used for everyday
access), and they were almost unusable.  Decayed to the point that they
had to be babied by hand through the duplicator.  We eventually got
decent duplicates, but the quality was very poor.  And that\'s after only
ten years.

     It certainly is--too bad acetate isn\'t used for microfilm or fiche.
It\'s 15-mil (average) polymer (at least, the Kodak film we use--the
Diazo dupe film is slightly thicker).

     This isn\'t a problem--the film is old-fashioned silver wet-
processed.  Modern photographic dyes aren\'t used.  We even run our used
chemicals through a silver recovery unit--enough there to be worth the
effort.

     This doesn\'t take very long, depending on the quality of the newly-
made masters.  If they\'re packaged together wet, they stick together
within *minutes*.  If they\'re properly dry, they should be okay for 15
years or so.  It depends on the storage environment.

     If that\'s the case, then I\'d suspect that the stuff used in time
capsules was produced specially for that use.  Regular film won\'t last
anywhere *near* that long.

     Depends on the magnification used.  Up to 400 with a 72x lens.

     But, I\'ve probably just given out more information on fiche than
anyone would want.  ;-)

Weird, I have stuff close to *20* years old, and it\'s showing no signs
of degradation. I suspect that the company "cheaped out" on the media
and used the stuff intended for applications like daily info listings,
instead of the stuff intended for archival use.

Some of it uses an aniline dye process. The "grain size" is the
individual molecules of dye!

Like I said, I *know* that there is microfilm (and microfiche) that
lastys a *lot* longer than the stuff you are using. Libraries would
*not* be happy if their microfilmed newspapers and magazines only
lasted 15 years!

I happen to be more aware than most of the ins & outs of
microfilm/microfiche as I stumbled across a fiche reader for $5 and a
microfilming camera (feed in sheets of paper) for $15 back around 1975
in a secondhand store.

I gotta get the camera serviced one of these days, but it\'s almost
certainly a missing screw and it costs $90/hr just to bring it thru the
door of the local Kodak service center!

We were taught that the rough duration of archival-quality microfilm was
300 years or so, if stored in the right conditions.  Acid-free paper will
last for more than a thousand years (we\'ve got paper that old).
Parchment will last longer (we\'ve got books dating back to the 3rd and 4th
centuries AD; no reason it shouldn\'t last a few centuries more).

Modern computer media (disks, etc.) is too new to have much experience
with yet; I suspect that much of it will be gone within a century, if
not within mere decades.  Lack of reading machinery is probably a more
pressing problem (there are _two_ machines in existence today that 
can read the 1960 U.S. census data tapes.)  OTOH, if you made a CD-ROM
out of pure aluminum instead of plastic-and-aluminum it might well
last for centuries, if not millenia.

If you really want long-term storage, though, carve your words in 
granite, or put them on baked clay tablets.  Pottery is virtually
indestructible (OK, it\'ll shatter, but the fragments will stay
around), unless you physically destroy it (as in, grind to 
powder.)  Stone tablets, likewise.  

In the Far Future, this means that the past history of most planets
can be learned by archaeologists up until the point when they
gotinto the Plastic Age...

     Well, again, no.  The company didn\'t.  "Archival quality" is one of
the buzzwords.  Also, the equipment we use is some of the best in the
industry (the XFP-2000--stick data in one end, get collated fiche out
the other).  What really matters is the photo developing chemicals.  If
the chemicals are fresh, then you get archival quality fiche that last a
*lot* longer than average.  If the chemicals are overly used, then the
quality suffers quite a bit.

     Also, there isn\'t any difference between "daily info listings" and
"archival use."  Same film, same chemicals, same processing.

     We also produce CD-ROM disks, which are a great deal more useful
than fiche.  The only reason that our customers still want fiche is that
the fiche aren\'t alterable once made (without it being noticable), so
they meet legal requirements for records retention.

     Doesn\'t say polyester on the label--I\'d have to call Kodak to get
any more detailed information.  I might do that--they *do* have an 800
number...

     You probably have the luxury of using fresh chemicals all the time,
then.  We\'re in production 24 hours a day, and have to run as fast as
we can just to stay in place.

     That\'s actually quite reasonable--our field service department
charges $150.00/hour (double that for off shift service calls).  Even
if the equipment comes in to us.

One of the *big* problems is that the media only holds those differing
domains for so long. They tend to "blur" around the edges after a
while. Which is why tricks like using DD media for HD are a bad idea.

Another *major* problem is the binder used to hold the ferrite
particles to the plastic. Some of those fail all too easily. A friend
had a BBS that in the early 80s used the floppy drive *heavily* (it was
essentially an online text editor, and the text was stored one line per
128 byte sector). He found that some brands of floppy failed in a
matter of *hours* on his system. He kept one of the worst examples. It
has large patches where you can *see* through the clear plastic because
*all* the coating came off!

Personally, I have a 3.5 few disks that are unreadable because the
media was *glued* to the metal hub, and the glue failed!

It\'s not just the drives. I can find lots of drives that\'ll handle 5.25
DSSD and DSDD media. But the *format* can be a problem. Try finding
software that can let your PC read the disks created by my Model 100
DVI. They are "normal" 5.25 DSDD disks, 40 track, 18 256 byte sectors
per track. But just *try* getting from there to the directory and file
structure. :-)

And forget the *single* density disks. Many of the floppy controllers
out there can\'t read single density anymore. Forget trying to figure
out the format, you can\'t even get the *bits* off the media.

As for the kind of thing you mention, I bet that in 15 years you\'ll
have to hunt to find a ZIP drive.

Or just use micro-lithography to copy them onto silicon wafers. At
micron level lithography, you could use a 5x7 character matrix (add one
dot "space" between characters both horizontally and vertically to get
6x8 "cells")  and that gives you a bit over 20 *billion* characters per
cm^2. And they too will endure for a *long* time. And one of the things
that has come out of semiconductor research is the ability to coat
things with a layer of *diamond*. That\'ll protect the surface nicely.

And like your stone tablets, these with last a *long* time.

I\'d arrange a long term archive with some sort of "plates" of something
durable with incised or etched text. They\'d explain how to read the
next level of archives, which would be "microfilm" sized text and
pictures on something like artificial diamond "grown" around the text.
The next level would be the micron level stuff. And if we ever come up
with a *stable* means of storing data more densely than that, we can
have a fourth level. But we *could* do the first three levels now.

In the old adventure "Expedition to Zhodane", there was 
a device to "overlay" a false personality over one\'s real 
one, to move about Zhodani society without appearing 
"wrong" to the Thought Police. 
 
So imagine if a player suddenly discovers that their  
personality is just such an "overlay", done without their  
knowledge, and the auto-probe suddenly clues them in 
that they\'re not who they think they are. 
 
But the impressions of the "real" personality are vague, 
so you have a whole series of adventures based not on

     "Tonight on _It\'s The Mind_...." 
     -- 

Ever since I saw "Total Recall" I\'ve thought that I had to write a RPG 
adventure sometime that explored the issue of "who am I?".  There was a 
Babylon 5 episode recently (well, recently in the UK) where a monk started 
having nightmares about terrible murders.  It turned out that he had 
committed the murders before being caught and having his personality 
suppressed - he now didn\'t *know* he\'d murdered anyone.  Relatives of the 
victims had hired a psionic to break down the memory suppression, so that 
he would realise what terrible crimes he had committed before one of the 
relatives killed him.  After the monk had been killed, the relative that 
did it was also given a mind wipe, and ended up joining the same religious 
order, since they now had a "vacancy".
It was all done much better than I have described, especially the scene  at 
the end of the episode where the Captain (who was friendly with the monk) 
meets the murdering relative after his mind wipe and has to be reminded 
that he was no worse than his friend, the monk.

Of course, I\'ve never gotten round to writing a scenario on this theme, 
though I did write one on "AI" based on ideas from Bladerunner.  Actually, 
it was a fantasy adventure where a magically animated wooden doll was being 
hunted down by its creator to be destroyed, because the "experiment" hadn\'t 
quite worked right.  The players became involved initially to try and stop 
the damage this doll was doing in the market, but ended up with them having 
to decide whether to give up their captive to its creator.

Oops, I\'ve written a bit more than I meant to, but this is one of my 
favourite subjects.

Cheers,
Liam

*** Nowhere Man spoiler ***


Am I losing e-mail again, or has nobody compared this to Nowhere Man
yet? Somehow I ended up watching most of the last season finale, even
though I\'d only seen 1-1/2 other episodes.

For those that don\'t know the story, the premise of Nowhere Man is
that the government has erased this man\'s identity and completely
covered everything up. He remembers things from the past, but there
is no evidence that it ever happened. In the last season finale,
they explained everything and it was completely different from what
you were being led to believe. The star apparently was a government
agent in an agency that had the capability of completely replacing
people (faces, memories, and all). He had built this personality
and history for himself and it was never real.

There are many ways this could go. Did he do it to test the limits
of the technology, as has been suggested? Was he forced into it?
Did he intend all along to subvert the agency, but this was the
only way they\'d let him out? All three? Does he have an entirely
different personality from before he became/was made into a spy?
Is he really the president of the universe, only in hiding?

So Tom Vail is/was a government agent who tried to retire from the
  Mysterious Agency?

*sigh*  The "creators" of this series seem to have given up any
  pretense of not STEALING the entire concept of the show from the
  much praised British series "The Prisoner".  Instead of being
  locked away in the Village, Vail is locked outside of normal
  society.

I\'ve noticed the similarity since the pilot episode, but what really
  made me groan was one scene where Tom is in a lineup, and they\'re
  told to count off... he, of course, winds up with Number Six.

Go watch "The Prisoner."  It\'s original.  It\'s better.

ObTraveller:  As noted in a now out-of-print GURPS worldbook for the
  setting, the Village of "The Prisoner" can be dropped into almost
  any genre of campaign.  However, it should probably be kept to a
  brief guest appearance, as one of the themes of the series (the
  futility of escape from the prison) will wear VERY thin on your
  typical players after a while.

    'body' => '"How do you get the ideas for plot developments in your game?"

I was asked this once by a player and absolutely horrified him with my
response.  I told him that, every week, a book full of plot ideas was
dropped on my doorstep.

Going to the television, I picked up the program listing and proceeded
to read the "one line" synopsis of movies playing that week.  After
finding one that "felt right" I proceeded to warp the description by
substituting characters and events in the game for the stars and
elements of the movie.

For example, for the Superhero game I was running at the time:
    STAR WARS: Old wise man tells young farmer he is heir of fallen
    hero.  The boy joins the rebellion and helps beautiful rebel
    princess attack overwhelming Imperial battle-station.

    Hmmm... Let\'s start with the "new weapon" for the bad guys.
    Maybe someone discovers Soulweaver\'s old base on the moon.
    Someone that knows enough to use what they find, but not
    enought to be to subtle.  Sounds like a job for Ravenwing. Now
    we need a "fallen hero," preferably one connected to the
    Liberty (the PC hero group) that has "gone bad," since *we*
    know what happened to the fallen hero in STAR WARS.  How about
    this "Lion" guy from the Rhodesian Super-SWAT team?.  Oops, no,
    he\'s dead.  Hmmm...  Double Hmmm... even better.  We can turn
    the "father of farm boy" into "mentor of young super" and make
    Thunderbird (PC and member of Liberty, ex-member of the
    Rhodesian Super-SWAT team) central to this plot.  We need
    someone to find out about Ravenwing and bring the information
    to Liberty.  Perhaps a daughter or grand-daughter of one of the
    Rhodesians.  Ur... Teufulhund (Note: Need to look up "Devil
    Dog" in German or whatever it is they speak in South Africa) a
    beautiful young girl that knows of Thunderbird.

    OK, how\'s this.  Ravenwing and Co. find Soulweaver\'s lair on
    the Moon.  They discover something that makes them Too Powerful
    and they start trouncing their enemies, possibly including
    Liberty.  (Scenario #1:  Ravenwing attacks) Teufulhund brings
    information about the source of Ravenwing\'s new abilities to
    our heroes, perhaps Ravenwing is "mopping up" her mother\'s
    super-team and she comes to Thunderbird for help.  I wonder
    what TBird\'s wife will say, not only about the beautiful young
    girl that has attached herself to TBird, but about his
    ..unseemly..  past?  (Scenario #2: Ugly past and Untimely
    Angst)  Eventually, our heroes will contact enough folks and
    dig up enough Power or Subtlety to confront Ravenwing.
    (Scenario #3 & #4: Figuring out what is going on and beating up
    the bad guys.) Sometime during these last two, Liberty
    discovers that Ravenwing is being helped by Daedalus, the
    Master Planner, who is actually TBird\'s old leader, Lion. (The
    rumors of my death have been greatly exaggerated.) Oh! The
    Horror! :-)

There is at least six sessions (six to eight weeks) of gaming in this,
and all the gross plotting was just done off the top of my head, and
took about fifteen minutes.  Do one more, weave the plots around each
other, and you have almost six months of general plot line ready.

While this is a superhero scenario, I could have just as easily started
with any other movie in the book and warped the story elements into a
science fiction game.  I\'ve done it before, and you can too.  And it
Really, Really works... :-)

Hope this helps...

Now that\'s one I never thought of. Heck, you could pick up one of those 
huge "TV Movie Guides" that have thousands of movie synopses, and have 
enough plots to draw for the rest of your life. 

Nicely done!  Thanks for posting that.

Oh thank God!  I was afraid I was the only total fanboy around here who did 
things like that.  I plan on using the dogtags to frighten people once I\'ve 
almost convinced them that RPGs are not a bad thing.  Of course, _I_ still have 
my original GI Joe Club dogtags from 1969.

I\'ve been thinking about this issue a lot since Bruce first brought it up (and 
even earlier, when I was submitting and resubmitting ship designs).  I really 
HOPE the rules set is solid.  I have a strong suspiscion that the starship 
combat portion will be the weakest part, and will probably be the second thing 
I toss from my own campaign (the first thing being range bands.  _Range Bands_, 
for heavens sake!  I have never played Traveller with a group that did not 
ditch range bands as soon as the playing started.

I am looking at this a bit more philosophically.  There were two sections of 
the original 3-book rules that were basically lame, and that I quickly replaced 
with my own systems; personal combat and starship combat.  In both cases, GDW 
later came out with a better system that I adopted (Azhanti High Lightning and 
High Guard, respectively).  I know for a fact there is a plan to come out with 
advnaced (presumably better) starship rules later.  I strongly suspect that the 
combat rules will either be something I can modify to suit my needs, or that 
Imperium Games will come out with a compatible but better system later (perhaps 
in JTAS).  If it comes right down to it, I\'ll cook up my own system and submit 
that to JTAS.

I\'m like Joe in this; I want IG to succeed so bad it hurts.  I was looking 
through some old Space Gamer issues over the weekend (garage cleaning day - I\'m 
keeping the magazines).  One thing that really struck me was the fact that 
EVERY issue had one, two or even more Traveller articles.  There were other 
gaming magazines in the pile also, ones I did not subscribe to but bought 
individually, and all of them had Traveller stuff also.  This was a very 
respectable stack; maybe 100 magazines in all.  For whatever reason, that level 
of fan commitment stopped, and I truly think that more than anything else 
_that_ is what killed GDW\'s Traveller.

So, I have made my own personal pledge.  Starting this week, I intend to submit 
something once per month to JTAS.  In fact, I already made this month\'s 
submission; mailed it yesterday.  Rob Miracle says we have more than 500 TML 
members.  If only 10% of you do the same thing, IG will be getting 50 
submissions per month.  Even if they only accept 10% of what is submitted, 
there would be 10 JTAS articles by TML members in every bimonthly issue.  Look 
at some of the _REALLY_ cool stuff that hits the TML.  The RICE Papers.  The 
ship designs.  The adventure ideas.  Even some of the "throwaway" comments like 
the one a few months back about the fate of Lucan - forced to live forever by 
his robotic servants and tortured with undying agony.  Even some the technical a
rguments that show up here could make good material; the infamous RockDropper 
thread, summarized into a 4-page article, would provide a wealth of information 
for players and GMs.  The bio-warfare stuff Bruce Johnson did.  The 
Majesta-class ship and background history (was that Alvin Plummer?).  And so on.

Look at the Imperium Games website for submission information.  I think Andy 
Lilly\'s BITS site has the information as well.  If you are not web-capable, 
write to IG and JTAS to get submission information.  Hey, if you\'re really 
ambitious, ask them for guidelines for submitting an entire adventure or 
supplement.  And remember also that IG and JTAS are not the only fish in the 
sea.  To really make Traveller thrive we need to get it exposed in some of the 
"general-purpose" gaming magazines.  I know Dragon is now a TSR-only organ, but 
what about some of the others.  And of course, there are a lot of really good 
"indie" Traveller magazines out there; Traveller material in those magazines 
might be "preaching to the choir" in terms of expanding Traveller\'s popularity, 
but support of any kind is what makes games grow.

OK, I\'ll get down off my pulpit now.  I just want the new Trav to stay around, 
grow tremendously and piss off TSR and people like Phil Pugliese.  I want it to 
be something we can both enjoy and participate in.  Think of this as something 
like an election:  If You Don\'t Vote (or write), Don\'t Bitch

This is a temporary state.  We all are waiting on T4.  IG and MM arn\'t
dropping discussion topics in that spawned a lot of discussion like some of
the earlier threads.

I suspect that about the time GenCon ends (maybe a little earlier when
people rush to GenCon to get their T4 book and leave to come back and do a
review) we will see a sharp increase in traffic.

I couldn\'t figure out how to use the d*mned things when I first got 
Traveller.   So, I came up with my own system.  (Meaning, your theory 
holds true in my case.)

Huh.  I agree on the starship combat note, but I love the personal 
combat rules.  They are perfect for the way I like to run combat.  But 
then, I\'m not into detailed combat.  I just want it quick-n-deadly.

That\'s the attitude! :)  Perfect.

I\'ve read a theory that what made the original D&D so great was that it 
was broken.  That is, each group had to puzzle it out for themselves, 
designing rules and whatnot since the game was severely lacking in 
elegance and detail (excusable, since it was the first of its kind).  
Perhaps, as Traveller grew and expanded, the lack of areas for unofficial 
expansion had something to do with declining usage as well as the other 
well-known reasons.

Good points, all.  I\'m certainly willing to submit material once I have 
the game in my hands.

    'from' => 'Derek Wildstar wildstar@qrc.com',
    'body' => 'Here\'s a few news items that might be useful for Traveller referees.
Both are from the latest issue of Aviation Week & Space Technology.

1) The loss of Ariane 5 was caused by a software error in the intertial
   guidance units.  The units had been used in Ariane 4 without problems,
   and were installed in the new rocket without modification.

   The problem turns out to be twofold: A calculation which is needed when
   the rocket is on the ground was continued in flight for 40 seconds (the
   data is not needed or used in flight).  During this 40 seconds, the
   value overflowed (became too large for to calculate), causing an error
   indication.

   The error indication was assumed to be a hardware failure, and the
   guidance unit was automatically taken off-line (and began sending
   diagnostic data to the flight controls, instead of guidance data).  The
   backup guidance unit was identical, and failed in an identical fashion
   slightly before the main unit.

   The value never overflowed when the units were used in Ariane 4 because
   the older rocket flew a different trajectory (which kept the values
   within bounds for the first 40 seconds of flight).  Because the unit
   worked in a large number of Ariane 4 flights, it wasn\'t extensivelu
   tested for Ariane 5.

2) An Airbus plane being flown by Chineese pilots was lost due to the
   combination of poor training and software faults.  At low altitude in
   a landing, the co-pilot accidentally triggered the automatic throttle\'s
   "go-around" lever (this causes the throttle and autopilot to perform an
   automatic abort so that the plane can go around and try landing again.

   The pilot instructed the co-pilot to disengage the automatic throttle,
   and - since the plane was now off the glide-slope for landing - engage
   the automatic pilot to get back on glide-slope.

   The automatic pilot was in "go-around" mode (because the lever was hit
   by the co-pilot).  As the plane\'s nose came higher and higher (for the
   go-around) the pilot and co-pilot began fighting the autopilot.  As they
   pushed the nose down with the elevator, the autopilot brought it up with
   the trim controls.  Eventually, the aircraft stalled at low altitude.

   Almost any other aircraft would not have crashed in this condition; they
   automatically disengage the autopilot when the pilot moves the controls
   a significant amount.  The Airbus doesn\'t, on the theory that the pilot
   might accidentally move the control column during an automatic landing
   and cause a crash.  The Airbus also doesn\'t have a warning when the
   autopilot adjusts the trim.
   

How does this apply to Traveller?  Well, item 1 could apply to almost any
piece of computer-controlled gadgetry (even gadgetry that worked fine
before, as in this example) on a new starship, or when any ship is operated
in conditions that it\'s designers never experienced.

Item 2 could certainly apply to high-tech spacecraft, where (as in the
Airbus) the autopilot\'s programmers think they know better than the pilot
does what the aircraft should be doing.

It should hit the shops somewhere around the 10th of August. That\'s what I

Think of it not as a rip-off, but... an "h\'omage". :)

The Prisoner is pretty popular among the TV-literate (god, what
a concept). For instance, there\'s an episode on Babalyon 5 where
Garabaldi meets an old enemy (or something like that) and when
Garabaldi leaves the room, the bad guy goes "Oh, Garabaldi...
be seeing you" and gives him the old Prisoner wave. Very cool.
As another example, in LambdaMOO, the base class for the wizards
is #2 and the base class for regular players is... #6. The Prisoner
is everywhere. Work him into your next campaign.

Not an insult to the Prisoner, which is cool, but isn\'t TV-literate 
kind of contradictory?  Kind of like military intelligence???  :-)

I refereed a few Traveller PBEMs. You can find some info
on one of the games in http://astro.sns.it/~mstiavel/Traveller/tpbm.html

My experience was:
- -it is useful to prepare a rather detailed description of the 
scenario/campaign (2-3 pages), so that players who sign in will not drop
off after a couple of turn because things are different from what they 
expected.
- -it is dangerous to have more than one turn per week (too much work for the
referee, this is the reason why we stopped the game)
- -it is useful to have pregenerated characters that the players can select
- -it is necessary to enforce strict turns (start/end etc) otherwise
players go off on different timelines

This is just my experience and need not to be representative..of my
players only two had a lot of Traveller experience.

         Cheers,
              Massimo

P.S. depending on when you start ( I am very busy in the next couple of 
weeks) and how often you plan to play I may be interested in joining
you PBEM.

Dave covered these pretty well.  The executive summary is that laser power
was limited; thrust plates are back as standard technology (and cheaper),
and fusion power minimums were raised to support milleu 0.  The change to
contra-gravity is minor (allowing you to get thrust from it, too).

> 3.  What are the most recent versions of SSDS and QSDS?

The most recent version of QSDS is v1.3, and it\'s on my Web site at
	http://www.qrc.com/~wildstar/qsds
When new versions are available (there will almost certainly be a v1.4,
unless IG tells me to cease and desist) the will appear on the same site.

> 4.  What are the "known errors" in QSDS and SSDS?

There are two known problems with QSDS v1.3:
1) The power plant table gives fuel requirents for 6 months, instead of the
   FF&S/SSDS standard of 1 year.
2) The HEPlaR drive table is completely wrong with respect to the input
   power required by HEPlaR drives.  The power requirement should be 14
   times the listed amount (it\'s a displacement-ton versus cubic-meter
   conversion error in my spreadsheet).

> 5.  What are the fixes for the known errors?

See above.  When T4 arrives, I\'ll compare QSDS 1.4 with what was printed,
and produce a definitive errata list.

I can\'t promise to answer promptly, but questions that are e-mailed to me
(instead of appearing in the TML, which I sometimes read and sometimes just
delete without reading) _will_ get answered, sooner or later.

Well, I did some digging.  The unmodified ship\'s deckplan seems to be lost
and gone forever (and I _know_ I did it) - oh well.  I did find two versions
of the Falcon (one at TL-12 and the other at TL-15), as well as a bunch of
other ships.

The problem with the deckplans is that they\'re 11x17 and were drawn in
color (buying Azhanti High Lightning had a big influence on the way I drew
deckplans forever afterwards); I don\'t have a scanner that can handle that.
I\'ll be posting the High Guard designs in a little while, though.

If folks are interested, there is some other material there, including a new
and different weapons list for folks who were usign the original STRIKER.

    'topic' => 'Notes on T4',
    'body' => 'I\'ve posted some info on T4 to the Traveller Mailing List, forgetting to 
add Xboat so that the CT/MT-only crowd can see the info.  So, here\'s a 
quick overview of the system:

System Overview:  T4 has errors; some are serious, most are not.  T4 is 
not TNE Second Edition; the only thing it has in common with TNE is the 
starship systems (and even that has been changed from FF&S).  T4 truly 
is, as IG claimed, "CT updated based on 20 years of RPG experience."  
Take "The Traveller Book," add a new task system, some more character 
classes, a new die-rolling convention or two (1/2 dice, X- targets 
instead of X+ targets), a consolidated and updated skills listing, and the 
aforementioned modified TNE starship creation system, and you\'ll have the 
essence of T4.  


T4\'s Known Errors:  

1)  Lots and lots of typos.  Words that are plural but which should be 
singular; vice versa; sentences like "use your Compute skill" instead of 
"use your ComputeR skill"; etc.

2)  Some awkward phrasing here and there.  Not as bad as the 70s-era 
"English" instructions in Japanese-made products, but still poor form for 
a professionally published work.

3)  The mustering out process explanation doesn\'t jibe with the ranks 
tables.  They kept the "Traveller Book" explanation, which bases the 
number of additional rolls on whether the character has achived rank 
1,2,3,4,5 or 6, while the rank tables go from E1-E10 and O1-O7 or 
O1-O10.  Not difficult to change for those of us with High Guard, 
Merchant Prince, etc.  But newbies will be confused by it.

4)  The Skills List and the Skills Descriptions are supposed to have some 
skills in italics, which is to connote those skills which may be used at 
level-0.  Unfortunately, no skills are listed in italics.  Therefore, 
there is no way to know which skills may be used at level-0.

5)  In the services portion of character generation, the skill tables 
do not have cluster/cascade skills listed in bold (they ARE listed in 
bold in the schools/colleges section, though).  This will confuse people 
at first, until they memorize which are clusters/cascades and which are not.


Things I Like About T4:

1)  I love the addition of the colleges and schools.  There are eight of 
them, but some cannot be entered into directly.  That is, you have to go 
to College before you go to Graduate School; you must graduate with 
Honors from a Military Academy before going to Commando School; and so 
on. 

2)  I like the addition of basic skills.  An age 18 character will have 
from 4 to 7 skills, depending on the tech level of his/her home world.  
This makes sense.

3)  I like the fact that characters have far, far more skills than their 
CT (basic) counterparts.  4-7 basic skills, plus 4-6 skills per term, 
plus default skills.  Basic character generation is almost as quick as 
with the CT basic rules, but the character generated this way will be on 
par with a CT Advanced (Book 4-7) character.

4)  The skills list is right for a basic book.  There are enough skills, 
but not so many that it becomes unweildy.  Additional books may (and 
should) expand on this list, but the basic book has the right amount to 
keep experienced players happy while not demanding too much of newbies.

5)  The task system is simple and logical.  There aren\'t umpteen 
exceptions as there are in most other task systems.  It\'s 
straight-forward and robust.  I can get used to 1/2 dice (matter-of-fact, 
I got used to them after just two games of Traveller Starship Battles at 
Gen-Con).

[Next time, I\'ll cover combat and whatever else I\'m able to read and 
playtest before the weekend is over.]


Some Andy Rooney-ish musings about T4:

1)  The ships look different.  It\'s not a big deal, but I\'ve always 
pictured Traveller ships as they appeared in CT.  It will take a while 
for me to adjust my mental pictures.

2)  The splashy Chris Foss interior art could have been dropped, esp. if it 
would have affected the sale price at all.  I like the b&w art by Larry 
Elmore, though.

3)  Every time I look at IG\'s Imperial Sunburst logo, I think of Mattel.

4)  T4 is definitely the official abbreviation for the game.  On the back 
of the book, in the bottom right-hand corner, is a graphic of "T4."  
Under that it says, "Marc Miller\'s Traveller 4th Edition."

5)  The book is the right size.  TNE was way too big.  A return to three 
little black books would have been rediculous at this point (no matter 
how much I love those books).  192 pages (including many pages of splashy 
art, the index, and even an advertisement for some role-playing magazine 
on the last page!) is just about right.

6)  The type font is nice.  Good size, and easy to read.

7)  That character sheet has got to go.  For one thing, it doesn\'t give 
enough room to list all the skills one will undoubtedly get under this 
system.  Heck, you can\'t list all the skills the example character 
("Alexander L. Jamison") has!  For another thing, you can get rid of the 
Mustering Out Cash/Items box (this stuff should be lised in the normal 
cash and items sections).  I think some enterprising third-party could 
make some easy money by coming up with a more usable character sheet.

8)  Including a picture of the design team was a good touch.  

9)  I miss the "Note on Gender and Race" that was included in previous 
versions.  That struck me as a good thing to include.  On the other hand, 
these days it would probably be vilified as too "Politically Correct."  
On the third hand, maybe it would be vilified as being not PC enough.  
I guess that\'s why they didn\'t include it.


More later, as necessary.

it covers just about everything you\'d want it to (in a basic book), from 
hand-to-hand to artillery, tanks, robots, and other forms of ground combat.
It is possible to cover all of this (in a basic way) in 8 short pages 
because of the robust task system.  I\'m impressed.

Quick Summary:

You can still tell Traveller has its roots in wargaming.  :)  The 
original rules shine through in this section, and their flavor is 
retained.  However, the consolidating effects of having a task system has 
vastly simplified the combat rules over what appeared in CT.  Once you 
memorize the task system, combat will go very quickly.


Errors:

The only error I found in the section is in the section discussing 
explosives.  They don\'t mention whether a grenade is thrown at a target 
HEX or a target INDIVIDUAL.  Since the system uses range bands, I guess I 
can see why they didn\'t mention it.  But, it\'ll be hard for inexperienced 
players to resolve hand grenade attacks.  They can figure damage, but not 
to-hit.  Most will probably be able to puzzle it out though.


Cool Stuff:

1)  Multiple actions:  A character can now make a number of actions each 
round up to his or her related characteristic score, but at a penalty.  A 
person with Strength 8 can make 8 Brawling attacks per round, for 
instance, but each attack will have relatively little chance of 
succeeding (unless the character is very highly skilled).  

2)  Called Shots:  You can do a called shot for increased damage (two 
kinds), decrease damage (two kinds), or to disarm.

3)  "Holding" your actions is covered well.

4)  Special rules.:  In addition to the Tactics Pool and Endurance rules 
that are familiar to most of us, there are also Strength and Dexterity 
Pools.  Strength pools allow one to increase the damage done by 
non-ranged attacks.  Dexterity pools allow one to avoid being hit by 
non-ranged attacks (no dodging bullets, darn it![G]).

5)  Initiative:  Initiative is done more logically (I got a taste of this 
in the Starship Battles game, and it works well) now.  The side that 
wins the initiative moves LAST but attacks FIRST.  That way, they can 
react to the other side\'s movement, then fire attack before the other 
side does.  This is more playable than realistic, but from experience, I 
know it does work well.

With the exception of one book ("The Last Planet" aka "Star Rangers" or
some such) the patrol is always "The Patrol". In that book it *may*
have been "the Space Patrol".

Also, it\'s "the Guild", not "the Theives\' Guild". Which gives it a nice
flavor. If someone mentions "*the* guild" with no qualifiers, everybody
knows *exactly* what they are talking about, but it\'s impossible to
*prove* it. :-)

"The Zero Stone" and "Uncharted Stars" also have a good bit of some of
Norton\'s other major "props". Namely the Forerunners, and the
Zacathans. And I think the First-In Scouts make an appearance as well.

Well, in Norton\'s universe the Free Traders are at least loosely
organized (which helps), plus, since they deal with the "frontier"
areas more, they tend to be a *lot* more experienced when it comes to
combat. And they\'ve got better excuses for going armed. 

Add in the fact that the Patrol does *not* approve of the sort of
illegal stunts the corporations would *like* to pull on the Free
Traders, and you have a workable balance of power.

BTW, that book I mentioned ("Star Rangers"/"The Last Planet") would
make a good example of how to write a neat adventure based around the
aftermath of something like the Civil War that ended the Third
Imperium. The basic idea is that a governor how didn\'t want the
detachment of Star Rangers around to get in the way of his plans
ordered them out to re-survey some planets in an area nobody had
visited in centuries. And he sent them out with inadequate spare parts
in an old ship. The story opens as the ship crash lands on a planet.
Later we run into the passengers from a liner that got lost while
trying to avoid the fighting, and refugees from a Patrol base that got
overun in the fighting. All of these get mixed together while they try
to figure out just why the planet seems to keep "bothering" the humans,
and what happened to the high civilization that used to be there.

Heck, given that Norton wrote a book based around D&D and has allowed
some use of her fantasy stuff in RPG\'s, I think that IG might want to
consider asking for permission to do a "Norton Sourcebook" for T4. Her
drives aren\'t *that* different. They even include mention of something
that sounds a lot like misjumps. And the technology is otherwise not
*that* hard to integrate. The races and backgrounds would be a nice
addition as an alternate universe to play in. And it\'d save a lot of
info that may otherwise disappear for good when she dies (I\'m assuming
that she\'d have a fair amount of input).

	But, the .5d6 is being used in 3/5 of the \'standard\' difficulties
(since you only roll for Easy in you are using a 0-level skill).  In the
Traveller Strategic Battles ar GenCon, where range=difficulty, half of
the range bands needed a .5 die.  Add this to other rools which are
rolled on 2d6 only (sensor rolls), and the results are clear:

	1) The .5d6 is integral to the T4 task system and is used frequently
(almost half the time)
	2) The T4 task system is *not* a task system, it is a system much more
kin to the Classic Traveller system of arbitrary numbers needed to
succeed, except the number of dice rolled is used instead.  IMHO, the MT
task system is vastly superior, in that it is more consistent, easier to
use, and I *don\'t* have to be reminded how many dice to roll. 

	It looks like I\'ll continue to play Traveller the way I have been, the
MT task system and modified FF&s for equipment. (Although, I\'ll probably
write up rules for using the MT task system in T4)

I\'m sorry to hear you won\'t be joining with those of us who will be 
moving on to the T4 system.  I\'m sad that there will be yet another split 
in the Traveller group, but I suppose it is unavoidable.  <sigh>

Frankly, the task mechanic in TNE is superior to MT,IMO (can\'t say about T4
until I have it in my hands).  I\'ve never been mistaken for a TNE fanatic,
but I always thought it\'s task system was
outstanding.  Every roll was against a single 1d20 and the task levels
could be pre-generated, ie.

                                  x4    x2    x1     /2    /4
Skill       Level+Attrib=Asset | Easy  Avg   Diff  Frmdbl Imps
==============================================================
Pilot         3      9    12   |  48    24    12     6      3
Astrogation   2      7     9   |  36    18     9     4      2
 
I made up character sheets like this with a place for each task difficulty
level already layed out.  When a character was created we filled in each
row.  From then on it was just a matter of:  a. calling out the difficulty,
b. rolling a 1d20, and c. comparing the result against the proper row and
column of character sheet.

Isn\'t this just a *little* unfair?  We\'ve had *three* different
varieties of 
Traveller to play with the last twenty years, and the best they could
come up
with is a mostly re-edited and re-formatted version of CT?

I will contiue to play Traveller, I will continue to purchase T4
materials ( I\'ve
got *three* copies of the T4 book, (one with me, two on order)), my wife
and I
are working on articles for submission to JTAS, and I am delighted at
the sneak peaks
of the T4 vehicle system by Greg Porter.

I\'ve been using MT\'s task system since \'88, reading TML since \'90 (and
continue to
read both TML and XBoat), and using FF&S since it came out.  

Its true, I didn\'t like TNE, I don\'t like Virus, and I believe FF&S
needs tweaking.

*But* - 

I am not part, nor have I ever been part, of the split in the Traveller
group.  I
believe there is room for all of us, regardless of what flavor Traveller
we play.
The only *real* problems I have are with those who have problems with
that.

How is this superior to the MT task system?  All I have to do in MT is
keep
track of my skill level, and add it to 2d6.

Yeah, it was unfair of me.  I\'m sort of binary in my outlook.  I\'m either 
seeing doom-and-glom or I\'m looking through rose-colored glasses.  No 
middle ground for me! :)  As I mentioned in another post, I\'d been 
anticipating and dreading (doom-and-gloomishly) a split in the Traveller 
fan base like what occurred with TNE.  Seeing your proclaimation that you 
would be sticking with MT, I jumped to the conclusion that my worst fears 
were coming true.

I\'m sorry I did that.

Well, yeah.  :)  As a CT fan, I can honestly say that I can find no fault 
with IG\'s use of CT.  To me, it really is the best they could have 
possibly come up with. :)

Same here.  Suckers, aren\'t we? :)  IG should give little awards for 
"Most Blindly Loyal Customer" or something like that. :)

One can only hope that everyone will see it your way.

For those who care (and those who don\'t), here is how I play Traveller:

1.  "Basic" character classes (MT)
2.  Character generation (TNE)
3.  Task resolution (MT)
4.  Vehicle/ship construction (MT)
5.  World generation (as published on the \'net by Jeff Zeitlan and others)
6.  Time Period (CT)
7.  Various other tidbits taken from a variety of sources (Traveller

So basically it is MT with a twist.  

Like many others, I will still buy T4.  However, it will probably not be
played in its true form.  I\'ll pick it apart and keep what I like and
discard the rest.

But..but...What about the unbalancing effects of changing things?  Didn\'t 
Gary Gygax\'s numerous warnings about this stop you from changing the D&D 
systems?  Good God, man!  Are you nuts?!?!  [big grin]

Wow.  What a melange!  I guess I\'m too much of a purist (or, a chicken?) 
to mix the systems that way.  As I mentioned earlier, I like using a 
mixture of simple and complex systems for CT, but all were made for use 
with CT.  Mixing between "eras" of Traveller makes me shudder. [G]
[BTW, this is not meant as a slight to you.  I\'m not disparaging your 
method, I\'m just saying it\'s too much for /me/.]

I did the same thing with my use of the Atari 8-bit.  When I started 
re-buying all the stuff I used to have, I did "serious" work on the clone 
box, and mostly just played games on the Atari.  But I got tired of 
having some things on one computer, and others on another.  So, I moved 
entirely to the Atari.  

I guess I\'m just a purist at heart.

(Strangely, though, using a 14.4Kbaud modem with the Atari doesn\'t bother 
me.  Nor does adding systems to Traveller that are developed by me or 
others on this list.  Hmmm.  I\'ll have to work on reconciling that.)

I wonder whether IG will care about such use.  On the one hand, they\'d 
undoubtedly rather you bought every single T4 item they will ever make.  
On the other hand, they\'d probably rather sell you a few items here and 
there than sell you none at all. :)

In the Traveller seminar with Marc Miller and Ken Whitman, Marc said he 
wants to replace all previous Traveller material with new, T4 material.  
Well, not all of it.  He did say he\'d ignore some of the stuff (and, 
presumably, expect others to ignore it).  The stuff to be ignored will 
probably (this is me theorizing here, not anything Marc said) be the 
more obscure third-party stuff, such as that put out by Judges\' Guild, 
Group One, and others.

first time through.  On going back over the Skills listing, the error I 
noted therein is actually far less serious than I had originally thought.

It is true (as I noted) that the promised italics used as an indication 
of skills that may be used at Level-0 are missing from the Skills List.  
However, in the actual Skill Descriptions, such skills /are/ noted.  The 
method is using the word "Default" after the skills, such as:

Acting (Performance Cluster, Default)    Int or Soc

I had mistaken the intended use of italics to be in the Skills 
Descriptions as well as in the Skills List.  This is not the case.  So, 
it /is/ possible to know which skills may be used at Level-0.  It is not 
as easy to discover as it would have been had italics been used, but this 
is certainly not a serious error.

My misunderstanding stems from the last paragraph on page 37, which states:

	"[level 0 skill use is] possible only with skills listed in 
	italics on the Skills List.  (The heading for each of those skills is 
	italicized in the individual skill descriptions as well.)"

But then in the Skills Description section, just prior to the beginning 
of the actual descriptions, it reads:

	"As in the Skills list, those skills that can be used at level 0 
	as a default are noted, as are cascade skills."

The use of the word "default" in that statement led me to re-evaluate 
what they meant by Default in the Skills Descriptions.  I had originally 
thought it meant that the skill was not a cascade skill.  In fact, there 
are many non-cascade skills listed without the word "Default" in their 
heading.  I conclude from this that "Default" must mean that the skill is 
usable at level 0.

This conclusion is borne out by the types of skills with the word 
"Default" in their heading and those that do not.  Acting, 
Administration, Athletics, and Blade Combat are "Default," while 
Artillery, Battle Dress, and Demolitions are not, for example.

I apologize most humbly to everyone for making this mistake.

As it stands, T4 now has only one known serious error: the problem with 
Mustering Out rolls.  All other errors are minor and unlikely to affect 
play (ie, typos, grammatical errors, missing bold face and italics, etc.).

Different strokes, I suppose. 

With MT you had to remember 3+, 7+, 11+, 15+ and what they went with.  You
had to add the, what was it 20% of the attribute to the skill to get your
number, but that could be pregenerated.  Then add that number to one of
those level numbers and compare to a 2d6. Easy for you! <g>

Harder for me. <shrug>

Truth to tell, T4\'s system would be OK with me if it wasn\'t for the darn .5
dice!  No matter what Joe says I *know* I\'m not going to like them. <g>

Eris

ps.

I wrote a Traveller-4 Die Roller this afternoon.  That\'s one reason I
wanted the know whated the details on the task levels, I knew I had this
afternoon off to work on the program. <g>

It works nicely, just hit the button for the task level and it generates a
number for you.  As long as the computer rolls the .5 dice for me, the
system is just fine.  <g>

I\'m doing something similar:
1.  \'Basic\' character classes and generation - MT, but I\'m leaning
toward 
	changing this to T4.
2. \'Advanced\' Character Generation - MT detailed system - for those
people who
	want to know almost *everything* about their character background (me
	included).  I\'m definately going to add the colleges rules from T4.
3. Task resolution - MT
4. Personal combat - MT, modified with ideas from Friday Night Firefight
and
	Phoenix	Command, along with personal rules for character damage.
5. Vehicle combat - Task-based Striker (the original), with personal
rules
	for damage.
6. Starship Combat - MT Task-based Brilliant Lances, with some minor
changes.
7. Weapon/Vehicle/Starship design - FF&S, modified with Striker/MT stuff
	- T-Plates from MT
	- Armour/Penetration ratings as Striker
	- Using high-speed discharge batteries instead of HPGs
	- Lowering the weight of Battledress \'skeletons\'
	- Changing some descriptions
	- Adding rules for grav-focused, starship-mounted plasma/fusion guns 
	- etc, etc
8.  World generation - mostly MT, but using the WBH from DGP for real
detail.
9.  Time Period CT/MT - my campaigns have ranged from 1105-1130
10. Various other tidbits taken from a variety of sources (Traveller
	Chronicle, Challenge, other games, etc).

As various parts of T4 come out, I can see my switching numbers 5,6,7,
if the
new rules are to my, and my players, liking.  If not, I\'ll change them.

I\'m already in the process of \'salad bar-ing\' (take what you like, leave
the 
rest) T4.  I\'ve been known to do this will all the games I run.

   One possible source of inspiration would be the British Magna Carta,
which spells out the rights of nobles.  The Imperial version of this
document would certainly do that as well.  Additionally it would spell
out the rights of commoners--here the U.S. or Canadian constitutions
would be of assistance.

   You can count on there being something that states something along
the lines that the word of the Emperor is law, something akin to Papal
infallibility.  Ideally it would also address the issue of Imperial 
succession, and the Moot\'s role in it (you\'ll also want a loophole allowing
for the possibility for succession through assassination as well with an
eye toward the Barracks Emperors and the Rebellion yet to come).

   It probably would not address a detailed government structure, as that
probably isn\'t an issue in the early years (everything centers on the
Emperor in any event).

   All I can think of at the moment.  More later if I come up with anything.

Regards,

Harold

    'body' => 'Here is the errata/potential errata I\'ve found so far:

Step 2, the text directs you to "select a hull from the table on the next
page".  The actual chart it is refering to is on page 107, which is 15
pages later.

Step 3, the text says, "on the following table, cross-index the jump level
desired with the size of hull".  There is no such table, not below nor
anywhere else in the book, making it impossible to design jump capable
ships.

Step 6, the text indicates that missile launchers "do not have to be
crewed when operating as part of a missile battery under the control of
a master fire director", but in Step 9 the text indicates that "one gunner is
required for each weapon, sandcaster and nuclear damper battery
installed".  For missile batteries, is this gunner in addition to the one
required for the MFD?  The two statements seem to contradict each
other.

   Also, I now know why people *really* loved the Third Imperium so
much--missiles were free, shoot all you want!!!  No where have I been
able to find any mention of the *cost* or *displacement* of spare missiles,
which presumably you will need after you shoot off the ready missiles
provided in the turret or barbette (which I guess are also free).

Step 7, Small Craft External Grapples are described, Small Craft Hangars
and Launch Ports (table for which is on page 112) are not.  Fuel
Purification Plants are mentioned on page 89, but not in Step 7, which is
presumably the section they belong in (the table for them appears on
page 111).  Ditto Shops and Labs, which rates a chart on page 111, but
no explanatory text beyond what is on the chart and a brief mention of
Sickbays in Step 9.

Step 10, the text indicates you should, "multiply the number of crew
members that need workstations by the workstation characteristic
above".  One big problem: there is no characteristic above.  The chart
you need is actually located on page 112.

Chart section problems 

The Standard Military Controls table on page 105 indicates that the crew 
requirements for such controls is 0.0 at all tech levels.  Given that the
Standard  Civilian Controls table on the same page gives some number
from 1 to 3, it appears that the crew numbers for SMCs are incorrect.

The Thrust Plate Drive Potential table on 108 is rather awkwardly labeled,
giving one the impression that the Gs column starts at 100!  Easy enough
to figure out that 100 refers to displacement and that Gs run from left to
right, but this should have been done better.

Additional Criticisms

   The beginning of the Spacecraft section promises, "with the systems
in this chapter, a player design nearly any type of spacecraft, up to 5000
tons displacement".  Avoiding a criticism of the grammar used, we
discover that while the Standard Hull Configurations chart does go up to
5000 tons, there is very few options in the configurations you have to
choose from (at 3000, 4000, and 5000 tons there is only one type). 
Also, the minimum size hull is 100 tons displacement.  This means you
can forget designing your own small craft, fighters or jump shuttles for
now.  I would have much preferred that this chart be taken out to a full
page, and a wider variety of standard hulls be presented.  Surely some
company in the Third Imperium makes standard small craft components!

   While it appears that the wholesale errata that plagued MegaTraveller
(aka MegaErrata) has been avoided (thank the Divine Being), this section
is probably the most  poorly laid out of any of the four attempts (classic
T, High Guard, MT, TNE) to present a ship design system in Traveller.
For example, the charts for weapons and defensive systems
(something one would assume you could find all in one place) are
scattered over four separate pages in the charts section.  In attempting
to assemble a 1000 ton TL 12 destroyer (an attempt thwarted by the
lack of a proper jump drive chart mentioned above), I found myself
frequently flipping back and forth between pages to find the proper 
chart or instructions.  While the actual work involved in putting the
ship together was much less than with FF&S, the constant page flipping
was very annoying.  Were I to use this system on a regular basis, I
would end up photocopying the entire section and redoing the layout so
that it was in a more logical sequence.  Those responsible for the
actual layout of this section (who now will never admit it in public) should
be ceremonially flogged with a piece of wet spaghetti.

   Well that\'s what I\'ve found on the first run through.  If anybody else
has any errata they have found (particularly in the charts), please post
it here.  If someone at IG would like to respond to what I\'ve found so far,
I\'m sure everyone would like to hear it.

Harold

   It is MIA.  Thanks for the info--now I can finish that destroyer.

   As a matter of fact it was also missing, still another piece of errata
I\'m afraid.  Thanks for posting it.

   The problem is that missile launchers and laser weaponry are treated
differently in the book.  While laser weaponry is preorganized into
batteries (sometimes consisting of just one weapon), missile launchers
come in two types: turrets or barbettes.  There is no discussion of
organizing launchers into batteries, only how many missiles can be
controlled by a MFD.

   A clarification statement of some kind should handle the problem.

>No.  The manning requirements are per _battery_ (MFD), not
>per _mount_ (launcher).

   At higher tech levels, it is possible to have multiple missile turrets
organized into seperate batteries under a single MFD (this is generally
not an issue at TL 12 or below, because MFD control factors aren\'t 
usually high enough).  Thus, MFD and missile battery are not necessarily
synonymous, and thus the source of the confusion.

   Also--I\'ve designed several ships using FF&S, so I\'m familar with how
things work under that system.  What I\'m attempting to do here is
approach things as though I know nothing about FF&S, and I\'m picking
up T4 with no prior knowledge (just as a new player would).

   Standard FF&S missiles displace 7 cubic meters and weigh 7 tons--
that fact is not stated in T4 however, though it certainly should be,
as should the time it takes to reload missile launchers.  I\'m afraid we\'re
back to the classic T pre-Special Missile Supplement rules, where
missiles are much less powerful, but you never have to worry about
reloads or running out of them.

>A hangar is a hangar, y\'know.  A place to keep your small craft, kind of
>like a garage.  

   As I stated above, I\'m familar with the concepts, but someone picking
up the book with no prior knowledge of TNE might not understand the
difference.  The difference may be explained elsewhere, but I couldn\'t
find it on my first run through.

>I didn\'t really provide any explanatory text for any of these items.  The

   How could shops, labs, and sickbays be controversial?  and if you\'ve
gone to all the trouble of putting them in the game, why wouldn\'t you
include a description of them?  I\'m not accusing you personally of
anything, I just don\'t understand IG\'s logic.

>Fuel purificaion plants turn raw fuel <snip>

   This is the explanation that a newbie needs, and it should have been
included, but wasn\'t.

   Absolutely.  If you are going to the trouble of including a *very* basic
ship design sequence, then you owe it to your public to make sure that
everything is spelled out as clearly and concisely as possible, and that
it all works as seamlessly and effortlessly as possible.  Afterall, you\'re
trying to *encourage* non-gearheads to design a ship, not discourage
them.

>I believe the controls (both civilian and military) do not require any crew.

   Well the columns were definately there.  On the SCC, at TL 9: 3.0 crew
are required, at TL 10: 3.0, at TL 11: 2.0, at TL 12: 2.0, at TL 13: 2.0, at
TL 14: 1.0 and at TL 15: 1.0 are required.

>That\'s mainly due to space limitations.  For the same reason, the table

   Interesting, as the chart does not indicate that all the hulls are from
one universal tech level, though that would certainly make sense in
retrospect.

  Time for a *minor* correction on my TL 12 destroyer\'s hull....

>As it was, I barely finished the system in time to be included in the book;

>made it miss.

   Then it was probably a good thing that you left it out.  Better a limited
system that can be expanded later than a total diaster unsuitable for
use by sane people (i.e. MegaErrata ship design).

>Remember, T:TNE _didn\'t_ have a ship design system in the main

   True enough, we get a slightly simplified TNE system in Brilliant Lances
(not included with the TNE manual), and then the full blown system in
FF&S (which you could purchase seperately or with the TNE manual as
part of the boxed set).  I beg to differ on the space problems though--
there appears to be more than adequate space available in the section
so that the tables could have been layed out in a more logical format.
Also, someone decided that inserting three full pages sketches that
have nothing to do what-so-ever with ship design in the ship design
section was a good idea--for future reference to whom it may concern,
it was not.  Neither was putting six pages of ship design examples
and illustrations between the ship design instructions and the tables
you need to carry out the instructions.  While having the examples
close at hand in the book was OK, they should have been put at the
end or the beginning of the ship design section so that you don\'t have to
flip past them as you go back and forth looking up information for your
designs.

>Again, pending the permission of IG, you\'ll be able to download a
>much-better-organized version of the system from my Web site.

   I look forward to it.

>Remember, I don\'t work (or speak) for IG; I just wrote the system ...

   Nearly as good  (and in some cases better).

   For the record, I\'m not trying to trash IG here or the new ship design
sequence.  I\'m merely trying to point out where the problems are, so
that they can be fixed.  I want everyone to be able to use this system
so that they don\'t feel like they have to fall back on Book 2 or High Guard
or some other such thing, or worse still, not design a ship at all.  One of
the things I appreciated most about TNE was that GDW was very open
and upfront about where mistakes were made, and they were 
generally quick to fix them (and no smart ass remarks about Virus being
a mistake they didn\'t fix, OK?).  Hopefully IG will continue this tradition.

Harold

First, the list has run on ns.mpgn.com ever since we switched to majordomo a
while back.  The weekend of the 11th of August (I think) we lost ns to a cpu
failure.  This was a DecStation 5000 running Ultrix 4.4.  To get our name
server (which was the key role of this machine) back on line, I grabbed the
one machine I had avaialble, which was a Dec Alpha running OSF 1.3.  I
copied all the majordomo stuff from the drives on the 5000 to the Alpha and
brought the list back up.  Now that history is past us:

The messages coming from ns.mpgn.com instead of mpgn.com are probably some
sendmail configuation difference between the two machines.  I will try to
get this fixed in the near future, but it is a pretty low priority.

The Mime-headers seem to have gone away.  Personally I like this.  I use Elm
from home and it doesn\'t like Mime-messages very well.  Any reason to go
back to them?

I have gotten a lot of returned mail, but they all seem to be ligitamate
bounces, mail boxes full, user unknown, etc.  I just went through most of
TML and removed the bounces I have been getting.  I will try to get to Xboat
later today.

As far as the anonymous remailer bounces you are seeing, can someone forward
me a copy and I will try to track down the source of the bounce. (a
difficult task no doubt)

Any way, I would like to appoligize for the recent problems.  Its not my
fault that that 5000 had to go conk out on me :-)

To be honest with you, xboat is almost dead...  Not been a lot of 
life here since it became apparent that T4 was going to be closer to 
CT than TNE...

I thought X-Boat was CT not TNE...  I mean there are no X-Boats in TNE...

That\'s true.

I think what Stu was saying is that a lot of us CT-ers have moved all of 
our discussion to TML, since that\'s where discussion of T4 take place and 
T4 is so close to being CT...

I\'m really beginning to think it could be a possibility.  If 
anything, there might be a need for a 2nd list for TNE holdouts...

Yup, but a lot of former xboat CT/MT hardcores are now posting on TML 
since T4 is better discussed there...  This is my point...

people long, I didn\'t get a copy.

Therefore ... I could use some help getting QSDS cross-checked and some
definitive errata made up.  If any of you have the current (v1.4)
edition of QSDS (available from my web site, http://www.qrc.com/~wildstar/qsds/
in lots of different formats), could you please cross-check what I wrote
with what was printed ... I\'m mainly interested in the tables: which ones
were omitted, and which ones don\'t matche the tables in QSDS 1.4?

Thanks!

Send it to: majordomo@mpgn.com, and in the body of the message give your 
commands, such as:

subscribe traveller your_address
or
subscribe traveller-digest your_address
or
unsubscribe xboat your_address
or 
unsubscribe xboat-digest your_address

You can give more than one command, but each must be on its own line.

power the grav vehicles and ground cars.  Given that the 4 ton (metric

cold fusion plants I doubt that they take up 5.6 cubic meters.

So, what are the stats for cold fusion plants, and why aren\'t they being

This is just a guess, but the smaller cold fusion plants will probably be 
in with the vehicle/small craft design rules.  Given the space 
constraints on QSDS, they probably had to make a decision as to how small 
of fusion plants to include, and decided that those smaller ones had to 
be left out.

I could try, but you will probably get better results doing a search on Alta 
Vista (http://www.altavista.digital.com).  I did one and got 3k hits, the 
first page of which looked promising.  The URL for the search is 
http://www.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/query?pg=q&what=web&fmt=.&q="cold+
fusion"

[Be careful of the return my mail app probably inserted between "+" and 
"fusion".]

When you insert metal alloy rods of a special configuration into ordinary
water and then run an electric current through the mechanism, the metal alloy
rods serve as a catalyst (that is, they promote the reaction, but are
unchanged by it) which promotes fusion of hydrogen into helium.

The result is a production of energy as a current flow from the mechanism
without the need for high temperatures, containment fields, or high energy
inputs.

The output is affected by the specific composition of the metal alloy rods,
the purity of the water (including the isotopic composition), and other
factors.

2. All About The Traveller Mailing Lists

   There are two Traveller Mailing lists, these are TML and XTML. Both of
   these lists exist as a means for the Traveller Player/GM to exchange
   ideas and discuss the various aspects of the Traveller System, and its
   universe.

   The Traveller Mailing List (TML) is open to discussions on all aspects
   of Traveller. This includes Marc Miller\'s Traveller, Traveller: The
   New Era, Mega Traveller and Classic Traveller. This also includes the
   background.

   The Xboat Traveller Mailing List (XTML) is for discussions relating to
   Classic Traveller, MegaTraveller and the Traveller universe dating
   prior to the Rebellion.

  2.2. How Do I Unsubscribe?

   To leave the TML, send a message to majordomo@MPGN.COM and in the body
   put the lines:

   unsubscribe traveller
   unsubscribe traveller-digest

   This will ensure that you are no longer subscribed to either real time
   or digest mode.
   To leave the XTML, the body of the message should be

   unsubscribe xboat
   unsubscribe xboat-digest
     _________________________________________________________________

3. What are the etiquette rules for the lists?

   Here are a few guidelines for posting your thoughts to the TML. Please
   note that they are only guidelines. They are intended to make
   everybody\'s life easier by keeping the noise level down and keeping
   the content high.
     * All messages should have a meaningful title. Please don\'t use "Re:
       Traveller-digest V1996 #2" or anything similar.
     * Any message which is over about 150 lines should be labelled as
       LONG in the title. This gives a warning to those running terminal
       sessions over slow links.
     * If you have a very long message that is not relevant to everybody,
       please consider making it available on an FTP or WWW site instead.
       Then announce it\'s existance on the list. A good example of
       material suitable for this is program listings and scripts.
     * Flame wars should be quickly extinguished or moved to personal
       email addresses.
     * When quoting, please follow these guidelines:
          + Please quote the minimum amount possible to show what you are
            responding to. Remember, everybody has already read the
            original message, they just need to remember it! :-)
          + Please don\'t paste in 5 generations of replies on a
            particular topic, or an entire 150 line message. Excerpts
            work best.
          + Don\'t quote signatures.
          + Don\'t quote a message just to say "me too"
     * Signatures should be limited to around 4 lines please.

        I figure a futuristic radar setup would have both ground sensing
and air-sweeping radar. For Ground radar, you will be able to detect (and
possibly image) any moving object within line of sight (less than 100m in
forest, greater than 2km in desert). Air-sweeping radar will detect out to
the horizon (70km) in perfectly flat terrain (calm ocean), significantly
less in rough terrain (1-2km), and virtually nil in a depression.
Sophisticated radar systems will also be able to recognize pre-programmed
objects (enemy tanks, aircraft).

       Attack radar is usually a seperate system, though by 5700ad I figure
scan-while-track will be common. I figure a sensors roll (range and terrain
dependant) will be necessary to obtain a lock-on. Once locked on, all
radar-assisted guns (with balistic computers) will fire one level easier,
and guided ordinance (missiles, etc) will hit 80-90% of the time.

        Radar detectors will also be activated both by the sweeping and
attack radars. This will allow the pilot/driver to jinx, deploy ECM, or
fire anti-radiation missiles (missiles that home in on the radar signal).
The effectiveness of this is up to you. The strongest consideration should
be the Tech level, I would say each tech level difference reduces
effectiveness by half (for both radar, and countermeasures).

                                                                Matt

    'body' => 'Hello there,

My name\'s Glenn and I\'ve managed to stay "clean" for twelve years. No
wasting time on rpg\'s in all that time (well, a relapse or two, just for
old time\'s sake). But, uh-oh... Some of my friends want me to run Traveller
again... I resisted at first but... oh, the temptation... Now I\'ve fallen
completely off the wagon. I went out and bought T4.

A fine book. Excellent Chris Foss reproductions. Dull but readable
typeface. Better organized than the Traveller Book. Too bad somebody didn\'t
proof-read it too closely, but as an editor I know how it is - deadlines
and such.

And the game seems to have been immensely improved while I was away. I
stopped playing after The Traveller Book, so this is my first exposure to
the Task system - seems very cool indeed - and the armor rules make much
better sense this time round. My favourite RPG seems to have just gotten
better.

But there are those nagging inconsistencies in the Imperium universe which
have always bothered me. So this time out I\'m biting the bullet and
developing my own future history and setting. Maybe someday I\'ll dump big
chunks of it onto somebody\'s ftp site, once I\'ve got the bugs worked out.

In the meantime, here\'s a question I haven\'t seen discussed in the XTML
digests I\'ve been skimming in the MPGN Archives... 

What ever happened to radio-spectrum CETI (Communication with
Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence)? You might point out that the Imperium\'s
got FTL X-boats, what do they need with those old, slow radio waves, right?

Well, it\'s clearly a crowded universe, including scatterlings of Old Terra
all over the place; so there must be a HUGE number of other civilizations,
major races and minor, in all that vastness beyond Known Space. The
Imperium\'s been around a long time, off and on; they could certainly be
carrying on centuries-long radio conversations with other species in the
Orion Arm, not to mention the Perseus and Sagittarius arms. Heck, you might
pick up the occassional "We\'re Here!" beacon transmitting from another
galaxy. IF you\'re listening. If you get bored, it wouldn\'t be so difficult
to set up automated listening stations.

Because maybe... just maybe... somebody out there, 90 degrees away around
the Milky Way\'s disc, has discovered the secret of tachyonic travel. Or at
least a Jump-7 drive. Or a really great Taco recipe. And maybe they want to
share...

In the future history I\'m working on, I plan to have a truly galactic,
Saganesque network of radio civilizations, conversing slowly about such
matters.  At the very least, far-flung civilizations might want to trade
data on supernova chain reactions, or galactic plasma jets, or other
galactic "weather hazard" reports. However, I do suspect any tech-17
societies are going to keep their best techno-goodies close to their
chests, partly for advantage in trade with their closer neighbours, but
also to avoid calling too much unwanted military attention to oneself.

Slightly off topic,
    For those of you I met at EuroGenCon who expressed an interest in the 3D 
star viewer
I had on display on the BITS/Traveller stand, the last release version is 
available via

    'body' => 'TRAVELLER SUITE - A collection of on-line utilities for Traveller
    For EuroGenCon-96 I produced a demo version of a concept
for a Traveller Suite, similar in market positioning to the
recently released TSR CD-ROM. The features of the demo included:
    * On-line rules
    * On-line library data
    * Star maps of the imperium allowing viewing from sector
down to system level.
    * Character and NPC design and generation
    * Starship construction
    * Animal Encounter generation
    * Ship Deckplan Design
    * Planetary Map Editing
    * Language Handout Editing
    * Trade Account Management
    * A dice roller (including 1/2 d6 support)

   The demo elicited a very positive reaction from both players and
distributors and I received a large number of requests to make
this demonstration publicly available.
    Additionally Imperium Games have given us the go-ahead to take
this to the level of a potential product. We are currently in
discussions with them about licensing considerations and market
positioning.
    Although no one actually managed to crash the software while on
display (although many tried!) it is still only an alpha test
version. Its main purpose is to solicit feedback on what a final
product should look like and include.
    In order to best gather this response I would like to set up
a web site containing a number of pages:
    * A release page for ease of access
    * A user feedback page where people can add their comments and
suggestions
    * A Known Bugs and Workaround page where users can track problems
in the alpha version and how to live with them.
    Due to access problems I cannot maintain these pages from my
current account. I would be highly appreciative of any volunteers
from out there who can set this up for me!

    The development manager of this software is Jo Grant who can be
reached at jo_grant@crd.lotus.com. The project manager is Andy Lilly
who can be reached at A.S.Lilly@nortel.co.uk. This product is brought
to you by the CORE Traveller development group, in association with
Imperium Games, and is intended to compliment our range of upcoming
Traveller supplements.

Getting the message across.

The X-Boat network in Traveller.

What is it?

The X-Boat network is the main means of sending messages across the vast 
Imperium.  It
was established 624 (Imperial) and covered the entire Imperium in 718 
(Imperial).  The
backbone of the system is a small craft capable of a maximum speed of Jump 
4.
Administration of the X-Boat system is the responsibility of the 
Communications Office
division of the Imperial Interstellar Scout Service (IISS).  Although the 
maximum speed of an
X-Boat is jump 4, not all jumps are made at that speed.   Because of the 
way the network is
laid out, the average speed a message travels is Jump 2.6.

How it operates.
The best way to describe this process is to do it as an example.  Say I was 
staying at Capital
and I wanted to drop a message of to a close friend of mine on Regina.  I 
would address it in
the following fashion:
*John Smith@Regina/Regina.TASNET.JS584866

So breaking it down, starting with the far left.  The * informs me that 
John is a registered
voter on Regina then his name.  The @ means located at.  Regina is the 
system name,
Regina is the subsector capitol.  The next part TASNET is the computer 
system name and
the last part is his identity on that system followed by his UPP.

Common computer system domains include:
TASNET:_Traveller\'s Aid Society.
EDUNET:_Educational.
GOVNET:_Local government.
IMPGOV:_Imperial government.
COMNET:_Commercial businesses.
PRIVNET:_Non business.

These are the main ones.  Major corporations\' names are added after the 
network name and
before  the user ID.

I record my message to John using my terminal in my room.  I have the 
option of Video,
Audio, or text.  The only difference in them is the quality and cost.  
Video is 30 credits for
each ten minutes per jump, audio 10 credits for ten minutes and text one 
credit for ten pages.
Mixed text and pictures\' costs one credit per page.  If I was not using a 
terminal in my room,
there are public terminals located in most starports.  Although video 
transmissions are only
available on class A starports, audio class B and C or less is text only.
Billing is in Imperial credits and worked out with the jump speed of 2.5.  
If he was not on the
main route, the message would be passed to the Imperial Courier Service 
(ICS) for final
delivery.

I have finished my message and instruct the terminal to send.  The terminal 
then gives me
the option to have my message encrypted, this doubles the cost of the 
message.  From here,
the data is compressed and passed to the local communications system for 
transmission to
an X-Boat station or passed to the ICS for delivery onto an X-Boat route.

An X-Boat drops into realspace.  The pilot then activates the recovery 
beacon and aligns the
communications array to the X-Boat station.  An X-Boat station is 
constructed close to entry
points of Hyperspace and contains fuel, pilot stations and communications 
arrays.  The
station dispatches an X-Boat Tender with a fresh pilot and fuel.  Once it 
has reached the
boat, it recovers it, changes crew and refuels it.  This process takes 
about four hours.  The
record for this routine is seven minutes.  A single tender can deal with up 
to six X-Boats at a
time.  In busy systems, many tenders can be seen working at once to keep 
the network
going.  Once re-fuelled and a new pilot aboard, the X-boat is released and 
gets ready to
jump.  While all this activity is going on, the X-Boat is still getting 
data and messages.

Once all checks are finished aboard the pilot shuts down the communication 
array and
departs the system.  The pilot from the X-Boat is given another job, 
whether this be aboard
the tender or at the X-Boat station.  After a week in normal space he is 
reassigned to another
X-Boat and his job starts again.

What is the ICS?

The ICS maintains a fleet of type S scout/couriers.  It is they who take 
the messages to
systems off the main network.  They are mostly modified with the passenger 
compartments
removed and replaced with extra computer storage and extra fuel tankage.  
They depart at
different speeds taking their messages to wherever they need to go.

How do I collect my mail?
Usually this is just  case of connecting up to the planet\'s data net and 
accessing it that way.
If you are on the move, this can be tricky.  Copies of mail are held at 
subsector and sector
capitals and at TAS hostels.  The last option only applies if you are a 
member of TAS.  Mail
is also archived at scout bases, this option requires an administration fee 
of about 100 credits
and a week to accomplish.  You also need to produce proof of identity.  A 
standard Imperial
bank card is usually all that is required.

What else does the X-Boat system handle?
You can make bank payments at an X-Boat office.   The information is 
encoded and then
sent to the back of your choice.  This has become a standard way of paying 
for starships.

Does the X-Boat carry military transmissions?
Yes, unless the transmissions are secure.  If they are secure then the 
Imperial agency
sending the transmissions uses an Imperial courier vessel.  Imperial 
courier ships are rated
at Jump 4 with a few being capable of Jump 6!


What about parcels or paper transmissions?
To some, a letter is the ultimate secure transmission.  You cannot drop a 
letter into a
computer and scan for a phrase.  Someone has to read it all the way 
through.  Letters are
handled by the ICS except they are not X-Boat sent.  Instead the message is 
accepted at the
ICS office and then passed on with other letters and parcels to a cargo 
ship.  Letter post
costs one credit per 100grams of weight.  Parcels on the other hand can 
make licensed
carriers a tidy profit.  For ease of packing aboard ships, parcels must be 
sent using a
standard design.  The boxes are available at starports everywhere at the 
cheap price of a
tenth of its size in credits..  The smallest box is a 10cm plastic cube and 
this costs one credit.
The postage for this item is 5 credits.  A cubic metre costs ten credits 
and postage costs 500.
The formula used to calculate this is: (size*size*size)/6*10.  Size= size 
in cms.  So the metre
box is 100*100*100 =300/6=50*10=500.  Postage is charged per 2 jumps or 
fraction thereof.
The parcels are collected and dropped into a cargo container for a sector.
So, I decide to send John a litre of water.  The water fits into a metre 
cube and I take it to the
ICS office.  There I pay my 2500 credits for it to be carried 24 parsecs.  
The package is
loaded into a cargo container along with nine other metre cubes for Regina. 
 Each cargo
container will hold ten cubic metres for each ton of displacement.  Once 
loaded, a licensed
trader is contacted for delivery.

Note:  Since the ICS has limited ships available, they rely upon licensed 
carriers.  Obtaining
a licence is not easy. First an application form has to be filled out and a 
fee of 500,000
credits is paid.  Then the applicant is given a thorough background check 
if anything looks
suspect then their application is refused and the fee is kept.  If all 
looks good, the applicant is
granted a licence.

ICS regulations prevent more than five tons of a ships\' cargo space from 
being used for mail.
This prevents unscrupulous captains from running off with mail and also 
means there is a
steady flow of carriers.  Each ton of space nets the carrier 5000 credits.

If a group of governments is pitching together for a Subsidised Merchant 
and the ICS thinks it
will suit their needs then they will throw in one fifth of the cash for it. 
 The merchant is usually
given first pick of the cargo.

The cargo is then transported to its destination in its pod.  It may along 
the way make stops
to drop off mail pods and collect more.

MegaTraveller.
The X-Boat system operates at full capacity until about 1120.  Once fleets 
start to diminish,
many systems start to lose contact.  The Aslan\'s hold off attacking X-Boats 
because they
present no threat.  Many ships and pilots where lost in systems that had 
major battles as they
became easy targets for stray missiles.  Once the virus starts to rampage 
through Imperial
space many X-Boats become infected.  They become carriers of the Virus.  
Since they
contain only enough fuel for a jump 4 they drift aimlessly.  It is during 
the rebellion the ICS
makes the bold decision not to spy on enemy systems.  This leads to Lucan\'s 
and Dulinor\'s
fleets to intentionally destroy X-Boats in enemy territory.  Vagr pirates 
prey on them for
spares and the long range jump drives.

New Era.
There is not the personnel to maintain something as complex as a network of 
ships.  A vague
communications network exists but it lacks the range of the old X-Boats.  
Many have been
found in systems, dead and lifeless.  They are boarded and scavenged for 
spares.  Since
they have no manoeuvre drive the hulls are just left to decay.  No X-Boat 
ever became a
Vampire ship simply because they could not refuel.

I\'d go with jsmith@whatever.tasnet.world.subsector, mainly because the
internet sorts that way for a reason.  I favor eliminating the UPP from the
address because its a game mechanic, not something I visualize being used
for an id, especially because it changes as you age - I wouldn\'t want my

Check the date _very carefully_ against the Civil War material.  I don\'t
think that the network could have been established until Arbatrella
was  in full control (at least as Regent, if not as Empress).  Include
a paragraph or so about how Arbatrella intended to reduce the chances
of another Civil War by tying the Imperium more closely together. 
(Background is always good.  Book 9: Fighting Ships was about 300%
more useful than  Fighting Ships of the Shattered Imperium because
it included a couple paragraphs of actual _text_ about each ship,
as opposed to just the stats.)

The section about "X-boats didn\'t become Vampire ships" should be 
deleted.  Sure, they couldn\'t refuel... but the computer might very
well be infected with Virus, which then goes dormant as the power
fails.  And I\'m sure X-boats had anti-intruder measures just in
case a pirate dcided to start preying on the communication lines.

HEY!

Flooding gets you nowhere!

Now, did you ever once perhaps read the little automatic message sent to you
after you subscribe to a mailing list?  You know, the one that tells you how
to unsubscribe, and, it tells you NOT to delete it!

Perhaps in the future you\'ll pay attention a bit more...and, as I said,
flooding gets you nowhere...each one of your messages has been forwarded
back to you by myself...I hate getting floods.

To unsubscribe:

send a message to majordomo@mpgn.com

unsubscribe xboat (-digest)

That\'s it...got it?

Well If I was building a naval base I\'d put a few *big* meson guns and lots of 
turrets. I\'d have mines in thhe area and satellites that could fire missiles, lasers 
etc. (No crew as well they will not last long in a real fight.)  

If it\'s a base there will be a lot of ships in the area as well SDB, passing battle 
ships etc. 

And of course the whole area will be seeded with sensor satellites. 

( Note if some of the satellites stop transmiting a careful commander might think 
that there was an emeny ship interfering with them.)

If I was in the PCs I think I would be trying to get in to the base and destroy it 
by some form of sabotage. (Poison, Reactor accident, Reprogram the space base 
defences to attack the base or *all* incoming ships)

Dear Traveller Afficionados,
 
I\'ve  noticed some  speculation over  the past  few weeks  on the
mailing lists pertaining to DGP\'s future role in Traveller, and I
thought you might appreciate an update...
 
DGP has been  in negotiations with the managers  of Traveller for
almost 10 months. Those guys sure are busy.
 
Even though  I\'m not as enthusiastic  as I was 10  months ago, it
looks like a deal may be able to be worked out. Keep your fingers
crossed.
 
We are seeking  a renewal of DGP\'s Traveller  license, so that we
can rerelease  our extensive Traveller archives  in various forms
as  well as  produce brand  new Traveller  works for  your gaming
pleasure. We love  sci-fi, and we look forward  to being involved
in Traveller development once again  and working with Marc Miller
and Imperium Games.
 
Wish us luck!
 
I\'ll keep you posted.
 
Sincerely (floating somewhere in limbo),
 
    Rodge
 
Roger Sanger
Digest Group Publications
 
 
 
P.S.:  Out of  curiosity, which  of DGP\'s  publications were your
absolute favorites?
 
What  in particular  did you  like about  DGP\'s works compared to
other game supplements?                                        RS

Dear Carlos,
 
The Geonee  were presented in detail  in DGP\'s Travellers\' Digest
(magazine)  #17.  They  were  the  special  focus  of  the issue,
introduced  as  the  main  non-player  characters  in the feature
adventure  "Missing in  Transit" in  the Digest\'s  epic series of
adventures: "The  Grand Tour". There are  plenty of illustrations
showing their size and their garb, including the cover painting.
 
Shiwonee, the Geonee Homeworld is  also presented, in DGP\'s Grand
Survey  (World Builders\'  Handbook) format.  A tech-level  G (16)
world,  Shiwonee is  an interesting  place to  visit, though  not
nearly as interesting as the arrogant and essentric Geonee (among
other things, they keep their women under lock and key, including
their posessions  - even crewmembers  who belong to  them!). They
claim to be a "Major Race", not by virtue of discovering the jump
drive  (they  didn\'t),  but  by  virtue  of  being  the  Ancients
themselves!  This claim is ignored by the official  six (that is,
five *)  Major Races, but the  Geonee actually do have  a special
relationship  with the  Ancients -  chirpers are  integrated into
their society and  have a very central role  in their culture. Of
course,  the  Geonee  are  first  to  brag  about  their superior
technology, and they act as superior beings at every opportunity,
despite their  diminutive stature (they  aren\'t much taller  than
chirpers!).
 
The  feature adventure  comes  complete  with a  diabolical plot,
Ancient Artifacts, and even a love interest.  :)
 
As with  most Travellers\' Digests, the  astrography of the region
is  also  presented,  complete  with  library  data.  Of  course,
as in  all TDs, character  descriptions of the  PCs of the  Grand
Tour series (Akidda Laagiir,  Dur Telemon, Dr. Theodor Krenstein,
and the AI robot AB 101) are included.
 
 
 
Travellers\' Digest 11 also presents  a system survey of the world
Far  Trinity in  the  Massilia  sector, "Project  Blackheart" (an
ultra secret  EYES ONLY naval  adventure set in  the aftermath of
the Fifth Frontier War  against an imposing Zhodani technological
threat),  an  entry  in  the  regular  feature  "Medical  Digest"
covering  TL  9  to  TL  12  human  medicine, detailed "Traveller
Arsenal" descriptions and illustrations of the PGMP-12, the Gauss
Pistol,  and  the  Gauss  Rifle,  a  "Tech  Brief" on information
processing,  Traveller  Q\'s  &  A\'s,  and  a  couple  informative
articles  for  use  with  GDW\'s  2300  game  ("An Overview of the
American Arm" and "Exploration: American Style").
 
 
 
* Special  Note:  In Travellers\' Digest  #17, in  the Grand  Tour
Feature Adventure "The Blade of Koiyehk", it is revealed that the
Aslan are  not a Major Race!  Not only did they  not discover the
jump-drive  for  themselves,  but  they  learned  about  it  from
humans!) Their honor would certainly be threatened if this secret
were  to become  public  knowledge.  Will our  hearty adventurers
escape with the secret and their lives? (Cliffhanger ending...).
 
:)
 
I hope I\'ve been of help.
 
Food for thought,

Subject: Getting DGP stuff reprinted?
Status: R

Hi there,
    Since your the fellow with all the copyrights for DGP... I have to ask.
What are your chances of getting all that stuff reprinted?  There\'s a bunch of
stuff from DGP I never got a chance to get and I\'d happily pay to pick up
reprints of the stuff.  Not to mention that it would instantly boost sales of
T4 to have all that support matterial out there as well.

Stephen

Dear Stephen,
 
The managers of Traveller seem  very enthusiastic about DGP being
involved in  the development of  Traveller once again,  including
the possibility of  DGP archiving all of its  material on CD-ROM.
They have remained enthusiastic throughout our negotiations.
 
Unfortunately (or quite fortunately, dependending on how you look
at it)  the managers of Traveller  have their hands full  and are
extremely  busy.  This  means  they  are  working  hard  to  make
Traveller  the best  that it  can  be  -- something  we will  all
benefit  from.  I\'m  thoroughly  impressed  with  what  I\'ve seen
(including what\'s going on behind-the-scenes).
 
As for  placing a % probability  on DGP\'s chances of  getting the
official  go-ahead, it\'s  more a  matter of  when rather than how
likely, and  that\'s anybody\'s guess.  Though I\'m sure Marc Miller
and his associates will get around to us just as soon as they are
able to.
 
Keep your fingers crossed.
 
Sincerely,
 
Roger Sanger

     This would, of course, be just too cool.  Does this include the 
     possibility of finishing things that wasn\'t finished (the rest of the 
     Alien books, for example) or just the previously released stuff.
     
     Would the info being re-released be changed to use the new T4 rules or 
     the MT rules set?  How \'bout the new stuff?
     
     If the new stuff is to use the MT rules, could you add conversions for 
     use with MT (heck, I\'ll even volunteer to do those conversions).

     Had \'em crossed since GenCon.  They\'re beginning to hurt...

Greetings Sapient!
This printed guide is an abstract of Imperial Publication 03-8462872, "Guide
to Supplies, Consumables and Trade Opportunities in the Imperium". It
contains information compiled from over 70 trade and survey expeditions to
worlds that have been out of contact with the Imperium for over 1000 years.
While each world is unique, certain technological developments have been
fairly predictable. This publication lists that subset of items which
explorers have found most useful to have on hand for convenience or trade
purposes, and those which have been most commonly encountered on other
worlds, and which are of note either for economic potential, hazard or
curiousity\'s sake.

This guide is broken down into the following cross-linked sections:
 Imperial Surplus
 Personal protective gear
 Exploration tools
 Personal mobility
 Communications
 Commercial goods (uncategorized)
 Vehicles (plus design tools)

Full specifications, suppliers and case histories of use for any item can be
downloaded via references in this guide for a nominal fee. Mention of an item
in this abstract does not imply endorsement by an Imperial agency or any
guarantee of performance, either express or implied. All comments by end
users are guaranteed to be representative of the majority opinion for the
relevant item, but are not guaranteed to be reliable. Individual reference
locators are current at the time of download in case personal contact is
desired.

In game terms, this abstract is a single sheet of paper that can be
downloaded from any general purpose Sylean news kiosk for the cost of 5Cr.
The full specifications and contact list is 50Cr, but purchasers of the
abstract get a 5Cr discount.

LAV-10
The LAV-10 is a tracked utility vehicle superceded by fusion-powered antigrav
units and removed from secondary service in year -21. Normal role was as
prime mover, non-combat troop transport or light weapons platform. 

The Central Storage Depot at Port Sidon has a large number of LAV-10 utility
vehicles for sale for export or metals reclamation. No warranty is expressed
or implied as to usability except for a guaranteed recyclable mass of 3,600kg
per unit. LAV-10 units are available for 2500Cr each in minimum quantities of
10 and have a shipping mass of approximately 6,000kg each.

The surplus LAV-10\'s may be missing tracks, engines or instrumentation. While
they are sealed for use with life support, it is not currently installed, and
while wiring and data paths for military electronics are intact, all sensors
and communications gear has been removed. On average, five units can be
disassembled to get one LAV-10 in good used condition and a lot of spare
parts. This process will take about 200 man-hours in a vehicle repair shop,
and this time can include retrofitting with a Fusion+ unit for an additional
1500Cr in parts and labor.

EVA-11
Current manufacture hostile environment suit, applicable for industrial work
in zero-g, vacuum, or non-breathable environments. It contains state of the
art systems to increase the safety and efficiency of the unit and costs
approximately 100KCr new. Used or reconditioned units may be available from
mining or construction companies for a discount of up to 60%, but may be
close to or past their warranted operational lifetime of 2000 hours use. The
normal suit masses 100kg, which includes a current manufacture Fusion+ unit
and antigrav harness so that when activated it has zero weight. However, its
mass is still significant and should be taken into account.

The EVA-11 has full atmosphere support for the minimum 72 hour duration of
the power plant fuel, sufficient fluid reserves for 48 hours of normal
consumption and sanitary hookups for similar duration, provided they are
attached. Normal entry is accomplished from the back, takes only a few
minutes and can be done wearing normal clothes. However, a special EVA
undersuit ("suit skivvies") is recommended for long-duration use to avoid
chafing and blisters (-1DM to Intelligence from distraction after 6 hours
without them). 

Performance figures vary by manufacturer of EVA suits, but the EVA-11 is
capable of 2g acceleration, has continental range communications (nominal
range 3,000km), transponder, inertial navigation and autopilot, a full suite
of on-board environmental sensors including multispectrum visual and
discriminatory audio, built-in biomonitoring, self-sealing of punctures, and
a flexible outer shell for micrometeroid protection, with a rigid optically
compensated helmet (armor rating of 3). Note that non-penetrating impacts may
cause damage to the fabric, thermal distribution and insulation underlayers
of the suit. Acquire documentation of authorized repair of any apparent
damage to a used suit you wish to purchase. This will be listed in the
service record of the suit\'s log computer.

The wearer of an EVA-11 or equivalent suit takes a -2DM on all Dexterity
tasks due to the mass and thickness of the suit, and -3DM to Endurance tasks
if forced to use the suit in a gravity well (contragrav may negate the suit
weight so that you do not have to walk, but you still have to move the heavy
arms and legs of the suit under your own power). If they do not have Vac
suit-0 or better, any action taken in combat requires an Average task on
their default to avoid a fumble or mishap.

"If you want to make yourself look impressive and be easier to spot on ship\'s
sensors, I recommend the reflec option. It doesn\'t affect performance much,
and most outfits doing mining or construction with heavy lasers get their
EVA\'s that way from the factory. It adds some cost, but it\'s cheaper than
paying off death or dismemberment benefits."

Neural Activity Sensor-13
Developed from tech level 12 psionic helmet theory, the neural activity
sensor (NAS) was first used medically. It remotely detects the electrical
activity of a life form\'s central nervous system and classifies it according
to amount and complexity. The data system compares the activity pattern to
known types of life, especially intelligent life. The unit requires some
skill to properly calibrate and operate, but once normal lifeform readings
for an area are gathered, an on-board expert system aids classification and
interpretation of data.

Detecting complex neurological activity in a target area is handled as a fire
combat task with a short range weapon (which may be aimed). This works vs. a
specific area the size of an outdoor square. Scanning a 30x arc is a -3DM and
aiming does not apply. In areas with a high density of life, the NAS may be
set to a certain threshold, which corresponds more or less to the size of the
creature (within 50%).

The portable unit consists of a backpack and a handset with a retractable
parabolic dish focuser. The handset in fact is not attached to the backpack,
and it can be operated up to 100 meters distant, which further extends the
range. The NAS runs off a pair of .5kg battery packs, which last for up to 20
hours of use. An optional scanning head (2500Cr) will allow unattended use of
the NAS (with an effective skill of 6) and scans a 30x arc per turn (the -3DM
is taken into account). These units are not available on Sylea, but limited
manufacture on other worlds has been reported.

****

Grav belt-12
Contragrav technology has finally reached a point where personal "jump belts"
are possible. These consist of a body harness and several contragrav moduules
arrayed around the body, with a small left or right hand mounted control
stick near the waist, and a power pack usually mounted near the lower back.
To get the low thrust and fine precision required, a dedicated computer
interface is used in conjunction with sensitive inertial sensors. Otherwise
the belt would only be capable of full thrust (3g) or none at all. The grav
belt is controlled partially by use of the stick, and partially by the wearer
shifting their weight. While a grav belt can be used in zero-g conditions
(within 1 planetary diameter), the lower of zero-g or grav belt skill is used
to reflect the increased difficulty. Top speed of a normal grav belt is
around 280m/turn or 168kph, with a normal endurance of 1000 hours between
refuelings and maintenance.

Increases in technology will increase the performance and decrease the mass
of the belt, but operation remains largely the same. Typical options
available at all TL\'s include:

Voice interface - Allows hands-free control of the grav belt, but lacks the
fine precision of manual control. Adds 500Cr to cost.

Roadgrid interface - Required for use in Sylean metropolitan areas. Includes
voice interface and remote control to automatically take you to your
destination. Adds 1000Cr to cost.

Emergency parachute - In the event of catastrophic failure, the single-use
parachute will deploy fully at any altitude of 100 meters or more, and the
user will usually only suffer minor injury (1D damage, armor does not
protect). Adds 500Cr to cost and 3kg to mass.

Backup power supply - A high-discharge battery capable of powering the grav
belt for 30 seconds (6 turns) in the event the main power plant fails.
Standard feature, no extra cost or mass.

****

Companions-12
These are a fairly recent development of the robot-makers art, and fall more
under the heading of androids. They are fully anthropomorphic robots designed
around an artificial duplicate of the human (or other) skeleton and
musculature, giving them a very realistic appearance and movement pattern.
Linked by several Comm channels to a central computer, they are capable of
mimicing human behavior in a variety of fields with the exception of eating
and drinking. Note that this is not in any sense an artificial intelligence,
but a very adaptable expert program system. The high cost of development and
programming has limited the market for Companions, and it is expected they
will remain a luxury item for the forseeable future. Purchase price includes
a 1 year warranty on all parts and software, and yearly maintenance contracts
are 25KCr per year.

Companion-12 80 liters 80kg 250KCr

<sidebar>
In game terms, a Companion is detectable as artificial on an Average
intelligence or Engineering task, modified by any visual obscurement like
heavy clothing, helmet, etc. At higher TL\'s, the difficulty of this task will
increase. Stationary, they appear very lifelike, but when moving, the very
subtle differences become apparent to humans who have seen "the real thing"
all their lives. A Companion\'s stats are 7695-0. Intelligence represents the
flexibility of the programming. Education is irrelevant, as a Companion has
access to any information available on its central computer (or on the global
net if on Sylea). This computer has a rating of 4 for purposes of mimicing
human behavior, and a rating of 2 for general purpose tasks. The processor
inside the Companion is a specialized rating of 2, just for communications
with the central computer. Companions may be controlled by a virtual reality
harness, though this is not a standard option. Social Standing is always 0,
as they are not considered anything more than a fancy tool. For accomplishing
complex tasks or using skills, Companions can have any Dexterity skill at +1,
and any Intelligence skill at +2, so long as the task does not require
genuine creativity (note that "Acting" could be the Intelligence skill,
making the  "hey, it\'s a robot!" check have a -2DM. Normally a Companion
comes with up to 4 skills, and more can be acquired at the cost of 10-20KCr
each, as they are exceedingly complex programming tasks to develop, and any
skill which does not have a mass-market application will cost at least
100KCr, as it will be developed just for that single customer. If access to
its central computer is lost, the Companion is not capable of independent
action, and will usually remain stationary and power down except for
communications links.

Legally, Companions have no status, and like any other tool, the owner is
responsible for any misuse. So, while a Companion is sophisticated enough to
go out and buy your groceries, if it hits someone with your car, you will be
the one charged with manslaughter or negligent homicide. Current laws
regarding robotics are applied to Companions. No cases that touch on their
unique complexity have come to trial, but in this eventuality, changes or
modifications to existing law are expected.

For combat purposes, a Companion is treated as a character with the
appropriate skills. They have an inherent armor of 1 for purposes of being
impaired, although any damage may mar their synthetic flesh. They do not take
blunt trauma damage, and are only rendered "unconscious" when Endurance (i.e.
power source) is reduced to zero. They are immune to vacuum, water depths up
to 2 atmospheres, and can tolerate corrosive and insidious atmospheres for
several hours, though all of the above will affect their synthetic skin.

Dear Traveller Afficionados and TML\'ers,
 
It  has  never  been  the  intention  of  MM  or  DGP to create a
situation in which background for the game was barred from future
reference in the game.
 
That is, DGP was given an  open hand to draw upon GDW\'s Traveller
materials, and in return gave MM and his associates equal freedom
to design new Traveller game  materials based upon the background
presented in  DGP\'s works. DGP  entered into this  agreement with
the  full  awareness  that  Marc\'s  rights  of  derivation  would
continue even  after DGP\'s right  to publish game  material under
the  Traveller trademark  expired.
 
Of  course,  the  scope  of  the  agreement  was  limited  to the
publication  of  materials  for  the  Traveller role-playing game
market. Any use of DGP\'s materials outside that market by Marc or
his associates would require a new agreement with DGP.
 
 
Under this  arrangement, once something  integral to the  setting
was created  -- such as  a key person  (the Emperor, a  planetary
leader, the head of a  major regional corporation, etc.), a piece
of equipment, a class of ships, a planet (or culture, government,
or organization),  etc. -- these  things could be  represented in
new game works because they comprised the background of the game,
that  is, they  DEFINED THE  MILIEU. The  text and  illustrations
themselves could  not be reprinted,  but any idea  that fell into
the category of "background" could  be drawn upon in the creation
of new Traveller game products.
 
The notable  exception to the reprint  restriction concerns data.
Most  of  the  data  presented  in  the  game  consists  of  pure
background,  and can\'t  be presented   in any  other way  than by
reprinting it  verbatim. Planet names, UWP\'s,  sector data lists,
ship  class  names,  ship  statistics,  and  other  data  can  be
reprinted directly in new Traveller  game products (by Marc or by
whomever he designates).
 
The  copyright  limitations  mostly  concern  foreground.  Player
characters, adventures, NPCs  insignificant to the superstructure
of  the milieu,  their personal  activities, specific encounters,
etc. Even though  these persons and events could  be mentioned in
passing,  neither MM  nor DGP  would ever  consider reworking  an
adventure  done  by  the  other,  or  making  use  of  their star
characters, without getting permission first.
 
As you can see, the distinction between foreground and background
material  is highly  subjective, and  relies upon  the trust  and
goodwill between  the parties involved.  For instance, throw-away
references  were  often  picked  up  and  fleshed  out in greater
detail, even some that could be identified as "foreground".
 
One  thing you  need to  understand about  Marc is  that he takes
pride in being the creator and leader of Traveller, and we at DGP
have always found him to be a fair and honorable ruler. You don\'t
have  anything  to  worry  about.  Marc\'s  main  concern  is  the
happiness of his customers and followers.
 
We at  DGP are very  happy that Marc  is in control  of Traveller
once again, and we feel that it is a position he truly deserves.
 
Sincerely,
 
Roger Sanger

I can\'t take you off the list because I\'m just a list recipient like
you. You have to take yourself off by sending the right command to the
right address.

You sent the right command, but you sent it to the wrong address.

The right address is:

>>>>>>>>>>>>>	"traveller-request@MPGN.COM"	<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<




This is a message I got from LISTPROC, it may help you:

To unsubscribe to xboat, send the command:

unsubscribe xboat

in the body of a message to "traveller-request@MPGN.COM".  If you want
to subscribe something other than the account the mail is coming from,
such as a local redistribution list, then append that address to the
"subscribe" command; for example, to subscribe "local-traveller":

subscribe xboat local-traveller@your.domain.net

A digest version of this list is also available; to
subscribe to that instead, replace all instances of "xboat"
in the commands above with "xboat-digest".

Think of it as ablative armour for your ship. Any energy discharge through
it is forced to vapourise the sand before it can vapourise the ship.

Personally though, I like to use it as an anti-personnel weapon while
dirtside. :)

Book Three? Which version of Traveller are you using?


>Is the sand shot in space to form a shield or is it shot at an enemy
>target to protect against their shots?

IIRC, in Classic Traveller when sandcasters are fired a cannister
full of ablative particles is ejected into space and a cloud of
ablative particles forms (nominally between the defending ship and
the attacking ship). This cloud travels with the defending ship until
that ship changes its vector at which point the cloud either breaks
up or continues along the original vector depending on whether or
not you want to keep track of it on the playing area.

Later versions of the Traveller space combat system change how all of 
this works.

I used DM -3 per cannister (rightly or wrongly :-). I don\'t recall
what the Traveller game "Mayday" (long out of print) has to say
about all of this.


>Also, if a ship travels through a field of sand does it take damage?

Certainly possible, but I can\'t find a rule about this in CT. So as 
far as the rules are concerned, it\'s probably safe to ignore (unless, 
of course, it lead the players into an interesting adventure -- in 
which case, have at it!).

Shot into space around your ship.

I think that sand covered the hex your ship was in when you fired it.
And it kept moving with the vector your ship had when you fired it.
Thus if you manuevered, you\'d leave the sand cloud behind, following
your old course. Note that "manuevering" includes accelerating in the
same direction..

I don\'t think they assumed a ship wouldn\'t take damage, but to be
realistic, I\'d say that it depends on how fast the ship is moving.
Obviously, sand can\'t damage your ship, so that means that moving thru
it at a relative velocity of 6 (ie doing a 6 g burn to get out of the
cloud you\'ve released) has to be harmless. For anything faster, there
should be damage. How much is a good question.

Note that a lot of the above is based on the Mayday rules, which made
things a bit clearer.

Bruce,

This issue with sensors has been IHMO wrong. To arrive at FCS(Fire Control
Solution) you only need three things -Bearing, Angle Theta, And Range
Rate(Rate in which target is/is not closing to the firer). You do not need
to resolve?(not a FC term) to hit a target. 

With Passive EMS it seems to me that everyone is fixated on the IR spectrum.
A Passive EMS sensor will weight in heavily other emissions that a target
might have such a 1 Gigahertz emission when the HELPAR/Thruster Plate drive
is used, the change in frequency when the drive changes speed. A Passive EMS
sensor could also pick the toilet being flushed so too speak, or even your
communications gear in standby mode. We might look at vehicles as to what
emmissions it might have.

A vehicle (Space or not) emitates vast amounts of Emmissions across many
spectrums. If you say that such emmissions are to faint, by todays tech your
WRONG. Today police can tell if you have a radar detector in vehicle just
simple piece of electronics. Do you now how much emmissions your radar
detector puts out lets say it in the milliwatt range, the police can detect
them at over a mile. Today from some satellites, very faint emmissions
(picowatt range), can be detected from orbit to within half a meter. EMM
will reduce but not eliminate a vehicles emmissions. The only way to stop
the emmissions is to turn off the source.

AS for missile a Semi Active homer homes in on the reflected emmissions off
the target. The source of the reflected emmissions could the firing ship or
another. As for how the missile deciding when to detonate, today a lot of
missiles use "Doppler Rolloff" to detect when to go boom. What is "Doppler
Rolloff", well we are all familiar with it, say a ambulance is approaching
you, you hear the siren, after it goes past you, the siren seems to have
changed sound that it makes. 

Also passive sensors always will have greater range than active. But passive
require a greater tracking time to arrive at FCS.

IMHO the only way to use missiles in combat is to use all the different
types ie KKM, Nuke Det Laser, Nuke Contact, and Explosive Contact. If you do
not I design a point defense system that will stop it cold. 

As to the debate on limiting Thruster plate drive it to certain size, it
will not work, people on this list have already given very good examples. If
you feel that thruster plate missiles will be over powering, there is an
elegant solution, use a Grav Sensor. A high acceleration thruster plate will
distort the local gravity scene in proportion to the amount of G\'s that the
missile is accelerating. The greater the distortion the greater range it can
be detected.

Certain EW gear that we have today can track, classify, and evaluate a
target in less time than you would believe. All from extremely small
emmissions that a target gives off.

Nice post, Leonard.  I\'ve been following this discussion to get my own brain thinking in 
the right direction about sandcasters, and as I remember, you are right.

I must also say that I like the improvement in T4 where the sand particles are 
magnetised so that the sand cloud can be moved with the ship by a magnetic beam (and, I 
assume, the highest desity of the cloud can be placed between the ship and incoming 
fire).

In my universe, I think I\'ll use both ideas.  One is for lower tech ships, and one is 
for higher tech ships.  Just like Heplar and thruster plates.

Kenneth.

I\'ve got a friend who\'s been collecting comics, and for years, he\'s been buying many
from this guy who operates out of his house.  So, I\'m with my friend the other day, and
he decides to stop by the comic guy\'s place to get his monthly fix.  I\'m there for the
first time, and what do I find?

Traveller Stuff!  Yes, beautiful, mint condition, never been purchased before, original
CT Traveller Stuff.  I was in heaven.

I purchased all he had.

I got the first edition of Snapshot, unopened, still in the wrapper!  I just love it.
Ain\'t life grand?

The guy said life is funny that way.  He\'s had it since it was published in 1979.  It\'s
been through two stores that he\'s owned, and nobody has ever bought it.  He saw how
flabbergasted I was, and he mentioned that it was just ironic that he\'s had it all these
years only to have it fall into the hands of a true Traveller fan--someone who can
really appreciate it.

Well, I\'ve filled in some missing holes in my collection, and I let my gaming group pick
their spoils.  To my dismay, I still have some items left.

And, like my Snapshot boxed set, I thought that I would give these wonderful pieces of
literature a chance to find a home with someone who would really appreciate them.

What better place to do this than on the Traveller Mailing List?

So, sharpen your pencils for your Christmas lists, I\'m going to do my first Traveller
Auction.

All items (but one) are in mint condition.  The auction will last until November 21st,
and I\'ll post updates at least once per week.  Only US currency can be accepted, and
postage will be over and above the bid price.

E-mail all bids to me directly at dreamer@brokersys.com.  If two equal bids are sent,
then I will look at the time sent as the deciding factor.  The auction is open to
everyone, and you don\'t have to be on this list to bid.

OK, so here\'s the golden find:



Item#1  Original CT Traveller game.

        Ya, know, the little black books in that little black box.  Stuff about the free

Chris,

I don\'t know.  Tractor beam, magnetic projector?

I guess I worry about that the first time my group gets into a nasty space battle.

Want to be an asteroid miner? Know someone who does? Please visit
astrodeeds home page at http://www.opo.van.wa.us/astrodeed.html 

We are selling Mining Claims and Deeds to mine the asteroid belt. You
can pick your asteroid or we will find one for you. Claims are issued
for stellar wind mining, specific planets and homesteads on the planets
of a star that you select. As the first homsteader you get to name the
star.

A gag? Of course, but still a nice gift. Our certificate is printed on
heavy 20-lb parchment paper, with a gold seal, and recorded in our
database.

The Mining Claims look good framed and on your wall.

Specimen data for Vland Sector for inclusion in First Survey (circa Year 0)
(accompanies Sector Map).
Best viewed in Courier (monospaced font).

This data reflects the information currently (Year 0) available in AAB. World
Size, Atmosphere, and Hydrographics have not changed for worlds in the
sector. Blanks indicate Starport, Population, Government, Law Level, and Tech
Level (all of which cannot be reliably determined after more than 1,700 years
of Long Night). Historical names are reflected, although they may have
changed. The referee has two options: generate the missing world data using
T4 (and enter it in the listing); or consult the more complete data for the
territory (provided online).

At the same time, there is available some world data which is reasonably
current. This information (which is available to any travellers who inquire
at the data base or library or starport) is reflected (for example) in the
entry for world 0921. This entry shows complete information.

Players (groups, ship crews, etc) can enter the data in their own copy of the
Survey as well as record the routes their exploratory voyages take.

Vland data file is missing some stellar data and gas giant information, which
produces the anomalously low Gas Giant presences.

This example reflects only a partial list in order to conserve file space.
This is not the final run, so some data (including names) may change. Names
ending in a period(.) are newly generated; original names do not end in
period.

Guy Garnett was kind enough to give us some values for converting T4
armor ratings into thicknesses of steel plate. I asked him to do this
and promised this list a table for converting High Guard and Striker
armor values to T4\'s. Here it is.

This is for those of us who want to run T4 games with all the
equipment we used in previous (CT) games.

Note that my High Guard armor values are different from those that Guy
posted. This is because the language used in the Striker errata was
ambiguous; it can be interpreted in two different ways.

The columns are:

1) The striker penetration value. This number is roughly compatable to
the penetration value found in MegaTraveller.

2) The High Guard armor USP rating as interpreted by me (Rob).

3) The High Guard armor USP as interpreted by Guy (Wildstar).

4) The T4 personal armor rating (in dice).

5) The QSDS and RPSC armor rating from T4\'s Universal Ship Profiles.

(Note: This table contains Tabs. Tabbing is set to 8 spaces.)

FORMULAS:

There are formulas for converting these armor values to the equivalent
thickness in steel plate. I used these formulas to make these tables.
"A" is the armor value. "T" is the thickness in centimeters of steel.

*** Striker Penetration:

Striker uses 1 inch steel plate as its standard. For armor less than 1 inch
thick, Striker uses a linear progression with A=10 equal to 1 inch. So
A=1 is one tenth of an inch and so on. For armor thicker than an inch,
Striker uses an octave binary progression (it doubles in steps of eight)
so 18 = 2 inches, 26 = 4 inches, 34 = 8 inches, etc.

For penetration values less than ten, the thickness in cm of steel
is:

T = 0.25 * A

For values of "A" larger than 10, then "T" is:

T = 2.5 cm * 2^( (A - 10)/8 )

where the "^" sign is the exponential operator (like in BASIC),
equivalent to FORTRAN\'s "**".

*** High Guard:

High Guard uses a one to one correlation with Striker as shown on
the tables. Because of vaguely worded errata, there are (at least)
two interpretations for conversion, as was noted above.

*** T4 personal combat

As Guy mentioned, T4 uses the following formula:

T = (A/6)^3

*** QSDS Armor

For values of "A" smaller than 30:

T = 10 * 2^(A/10)

For values of "A" larger than 30:

T = 4 * A - 40

Hope this helps all the other old CT holdouts on this
list 8^).

I wrote a  detailed letter about DGP\'s  copyright policies on TML
awhile back  (with which Marc Miller  concurred), but there still
seems  to be  some lingering  confusion concerning  the matter in
public  Traveller  discussions,  so  I\'ll  clarify  the situation
again.  I think you are going to love this:
 
MARC  MILLER HAS  DGP\'S PERMISSION  to use  background data  (UWP
lists,  planet names,  sector  maps,  etc.) from  DGP\'s Traveller
works  in  any  way  that  he  sees  fit  in  printed Traveller 4
publications!
 
In addition, Marc  Miller has been given a free  hand to dip into
DGP\'s Traveller archives for inspiration in developing background
material for  his new incarnation  of the Traveller  role-playing
game. This way, he can keep  Traveller 4 consistent with what has
come before!!!
 
The  races  (the  Geonee,  the  Brinn,  etc.), the places (Vland,
Shudusham,  Capital), and  the things  (robots, equipment,  etc.)
which  you loved  from DGP\'s   works still  exist in  the overall
Traveller  milieu.  I  don\'t  believe  Marc  has any intention of
changing this  (he\'s DGP\'s number  one fan!).
 
Traveller has been around a long time, and it would be a shame to
invalidate the thousands of pages  that have been written for the
milieu. Marc knows what he\'s doing, and he knows what you love. A
lot of  what has come before  will not exist in  Milieu Zero, but
the future has not been erased. ;)
 
And the best years are yet to come.
 
Sincerely,
 
Roger Sanger

A Note on Magazines:  While additional issues of many listed magazines 
(i.e., Travellers\' Digest, JTAS (as Challenge), etc.) were produced, 
they are not included here because those issues contained material related
to games other than Classic Traveller, even though they did contain some 
material usable in the Classic Traveller system.  This is also the reason 
certain issues of Space Gamer, Dragon Magazine, and others are not listed.
