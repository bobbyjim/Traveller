Well, they are inside the hull and are only full on the way to the jump point,
so not that much of a liability, especially if you do a running jump.

They would need to last at least 50 refills to actually work out cheaper than
fixed tanks.

Presumably they would be useable for any bulk liquid or powder transport, if
such an opportunity presented itself. 

Hmmmm, ISS beer contract anyone?  Probably need a fair size fleet for that :-)

This means that they\'ll need multi-airlocked connector modules, if any
larger space station is planned. Something with 1 at each end and 3-6

I was thinking on the lines of a revolver bay with 6 modules per section.
Because of the basic module shape the connectors will also follow it. And
instead of a different shaped central dome I think I\'ll use one made of
several modules that are designed to be linked into one larger cylinder.

As a GM, this presents me with so many *EVIL* possibilities, I\'ll just HAVE
to use it!  The concept of a engineer failing his skill roll while
reconfiguring the fuel tanks for cargo is *just* delicious!!  (CAPT to ENGR:

A lot of things change in 1100 years.

IMHO, The Sylean Cadre core of the Imperial Army in Milieu 0,
would eventually become primarily a bureacracy, responsible for
maintaining the standards and training of the entire Imperial Army.
By 1100, each sector, or at least domain, should have its own
Military Academy (such as the Military College of Mora, GT:BtC p. 115),
but there would still be *The* Imperial Military Academy (at Arpaget in
T4.1/5).

[There are chargen implications here - it should be more difficult to
enter the Imperial Academy, than other Military Colleges.  Off the
top of my head I\'d say admission should be:

The Imperial Military Academy: [T4.1 Beta material]
Prereqs: End 8+, Int 8+, Edu 4+, Soc 8+, Age 19-
Admission: 5-; DM -2 if Int A+

A Domain or Sector Military Academy or College:
Prereqs:  End 8+, Int 8+, Edu 4+, Soc 7+, Age 19-
Admission:  6-;  DM -2 if Int A+

A Planetary or Subsector Military Academy of College:
Prereqs: End 7+, Int 7+, Edu 4+, Soc 6+, Age 19-
Admission: 6-;  DM -2 if Int 9+

I\'d have a similar system for Naval Academys.

Alternatively:  You could base the determination of which
Military Academy is entered based on the roll for THE
Imp. Military Academy.  Fail by 1, Domain/Sector;
Fail by 2, Subsector/Planet (maybe with a required
term of Army service as well).  This may be merited by
the integrated nature of the military bureaucracies.
E.G., Eneri Soldier, a native of Rhylanor, attempts to enroll
in the Imperial Military Academy.  He has no DMs and rolls
a 6 on the enlistment roll.  He is informed by the Imperial
Army that there is no space for him in the next class, but
that there is a spot open at the Military College of Mora,
which he may have.]

To ensure uniformity of training and standards, the Sylean Cadre
would command those institutions as well as serving some function
with larger unit sizes for the same purposes.  In this way, with little
real trouble, I think these desk soldiers would be members of the
Sylean Cadre.

I would distinguish this from the Emperor\'s Guard, or whatever
name is appropriate, which IMTU would be an elite unit comprised
of combat veterans from throughout the Imperium.  Surviving soldiers
in these units would go on to teach at military acade

 Automation is here. It\'s here to stay. It\'s only going to get more advanced
 as time goes on. There\'s alot of interesting research being done into the
 discipline of automation right now. In real life it has revolutionized
 nearly every aspect of our society, and it will continue to do so.

Yeap.

 There\'s a belief that with AI levels of automation, people will become

 waiting on that one.

That, of course, will hold true as long as the attacker wants to take the

point targets worth BCr or TCr - well, they may cover large areas, but will 
still be "point targets" compared to the area a starfleet can burn. A TL15 
planet that\'s lost it\'s starport, top ten spaceports, top ten population centers
and top ten factory complexes will certainly suffer a loss in ability to 
support the war effort, and may even suffer a degradation in  tech level.

If the invader had a plan long-term enough, this could be a viable strategy - 
say, the High Archon\'s orders to the Admiral of the Invasion Fleet: 
"Do no damage that can\'t be fixed in a century or two, we might want to
add that planet to our empire someday. Yes, remove it from their war
effort for *this* war, but don\'t make the planet uninhabitable. I know those
factories and such could be useful to us, but we plan on this war being
over - one way or the other - long before we could invade that planet
and get the factories working for *us*."

It sucks to go to war with someone, and discover that they\'re playing
by a very different set of rules than you\'re used to.

Probably the same reasons that Doctors seem to all have their billing set
to Medicaid/Medicare coverage plus co-payment, or maximum insurance
"Customary and Reasonable" plus copayment... The vast majority seem to be
subsidized by governments; many government subsidies prevent you from
charging more than their fixed rate, but likewise, do not require a lowest
bidder situation.

If the prices are established by imperial payment schedules, and the
imperium constitutes 30% or more of shipping, you can bet almost everyone
will be around those numbers. Since we know that the TAS rates match up,
I\'d figure some 30-60% covered rates.

As for the longer jump mechanism, there is no incentive for carriers to
have J3 vessels, under subsidy rates, so there won\'t be many, and they will
be booked up quick...

First of all, it had nothing to do with Star Wars, and didn\'t even seem to
be especially futuristic. It all took place on this desert planet, and
everything seemed to revolve around a cantina called "Rick\'s Cafe
Americaine." The leads were played by Humphrey Bogart and Claude Rains, and
Ingrid Bergman was the love interest.

Frankly, I was disappointed. No decent special effects, the costumes were
nothing like the previous SW movies, and the whole thing was done in black
and white.

I don\'t think you\'ll find the one playing in theaters to be superior in
any way at all to the version you describe.  ;)

A couple of years ago the Guardian ran a story about sweatshop-type
operations using contract labour, being run in US protectorates. Apparently
they had armed guards and barbed wire to keep people inside (until they had
paid off their transportation costs, and any additional costs for
room-and-board).

The reason for doing this in a US protectorate was that the clothing then
could have a "Made in the USA" label.

Since I was 10 in 1977, I didn\'t rush out to see Star Wars. I was however, 
reading Heinlen, Niven, Clarke, Pournelle, and anyone else I could get my
hands on. Traveller fit right into this "Golden Age of Science Fiction",
no light sabres, no creatures living in vacuums, lasers were light beams and
didn\'t make the noise you get when you hit a cable supporting a telephone
pole with a piece of metal, and when ships exploded in space: they made no
noise!

I didn\'t see Star Wars until I was in my 20\'s, and was not surprised that
what I had read about it was true: It did more damage to science fiction
than any other movie before or since. (Now Bladerunner, Outlands? (Sean 
Connery, Jupiter), 2001, ... they were SF movies!)

OK.  Got any numbers showing profitability at 950/ton with a normal (i.e., 
*NOT* a \'drop tank special\') ship?

The courier vessel RSN _Outreach_ arrived in the Jokelyn system today, 
bearing reports from the government of Sansterre (Old Islands/Reft Sector) 
that the entire Islands Cluster had inexplicably moved to a war footing. 
Due to the extreme isolation of the Islands Cluster from the Imperium,
no independent confirmation of the situation is available at this time.

There was little detailed information presented to the media, but 
representatives of the Sansterrean government were said to be meeting
with the Imperial Governor in charge of the Jokelyn outpost. Other 
Sansterrean diplomats were seen boarding an Imperiallines charter
vessel, said to be bound for the Imperial Navy Base at Rampart
(Limon/Reft Sector) and points deeper within the Imperium. There are
also reports, though unconfirmed, that representatives of at least two
major StarMerc organizations were travelling with the Sansterrean party. 

A press release from a Sansterrean spokesophont follows:
- ----
"The free peoples of Sansterre have been deeply disturbed by the 
current troubles in the Islands Cluster. Once upon a time, we were
all peaceful worlds, seperated by distance but bound together by
our common roots. Our time of war came with the introduction of
the Jump Drive, but the Imperium aided us in redressing the balance
and bringing peace to the cluster, a peace that has been long and
fruitful. 

Now, there is again the rattlings of sabers, the passage of warships.
It is apparent that, once more, we must ask the aid of our peace-loving
neighbors, the Third Imperium, in bringing a just peace to the spacelanes
of the Cluster. Let our history bring us closer, and mutual action make
us allies in this chaotic time.

The government of Sansterre hereby volunteers itself to the cause of 
peace in the Islands Cluster. With the technological and material aid
of the mighty Imperium, we know that the Sansterrean Fleet can
seperate the belligerent and demilitarize the militant. It will be a long,
hard struggle, but with fortitude and cooperation we will see the end of
war and a just peace in the Cluster, for all our children and our
childrens\' children.

Thor Heyrden
Ambassador of Her Majesty\'s Government

Well it\'s bare-bones so far.  I viewed it with Netscape Communicator
4.60 and your MIDI failed to play - Netscape was fooled into thinking it
needed to search for a new plug-in, which it didn\'t find.

So I fired up Internet Explorer 5.0 and it responded with "The data that
the plugin requested, did not download properly."

What\'s "mars.mid" sound like?  Is it from "Holst : The Planets"?

Ah, but the real test is if you still use the default floating point
variables.  I (fortunately) have had many many years of C to eradicate 
those from my habits and have fallen into the d and f (double and 
float) variation.  FWIW, I\'m pretty i j and k are used in thoughout
K&R.

(and this is probably the only thing constructive I could post to 
this thread).

I still always think of \'the next string high than a d-string.\'
Having played bass, I\'ve always wondered if that was the origin of
that item.....

And as another synchronis aside, when the mention of i j and k was
made, I thought of cursor movement....

I was thinking of Marines that had light saber tradition rather than

considering (MT stats) of having a Dmg of 3 and Pen of 20 (Like a TL laser

What about ancient artifiacts? Certainly the ancients could have devised

I consider myself lucky. My wifes friends brother who knows a guy that works
at the theater (this sounds silly) convinced his manager that if he presold
400 tickets they would make an extra showing of Star Wars on Saturday at
7:30am. I snatched up 6 tickets before they were all gone. I didn\'t think
I\'d see the movie for atleast a month after it came out... I never would
have though I\'d see it on the fourth day.

As for all the critics... I don\'t care. I\'m going to go see the new Star
Wars and it\'ll be good no matter what. :-)

One way to work light-sabre-like weapons into a Traveller setting,
without doing _too_ much damage to the technological setting, is to
postulate that a light sabre is actually a set of monomolecular
filaments, held rigid by a visible gravitic beam.  Since Traveller has
gravitic manipulation, and monomolecular filaments are not _too_
implausible, one can avoid the problems that might arise from, say, a
laser-based light sabre (e.g., why does it only reach out to a meter or
so in length...).  This would also explain such oddities as the fact
that one light sabre can block another.  It could even be stretched to
the point of explaining the _sound_ of a light sabre moving through the
air....

Power cells aren\'t the problem.  The problem is to get a beam of energy to
limit itself to a specific length and be solid against itself!  Just a
flashlight laser won\'t do.  It would have a long range and if you tried to
parry it with itself, the beams would just cross (uhmm... that\'s a
different movie... oh well...).  You really need to make something entirely
different...  Maybe high-energy plasma contained by a gravitic field?  and
the gravitic fields can\'t pass through each other?  (The plasma, of course,
is just there for the cool glow...)

I really think the only way to do this is with a total handwave (Ancients
tech _is_ a total handwave).  IMHO, light sabres are inappropriate to the
Traveller universe, but YMMV.  For a (slightly) less handwaved version,
consider monowire or hyperdense weapons.  when wielded by a battlesuited
trooper they can be quite effective.

Or play the Star Wars RPG, which is fun too.

It\'s a cool book about several generashions of astronoughts.  It starts with 
a ship leaving Earth under matter/anti-matter drive, it then goes back to the 
launching of the US hab to the space station and the crash.  I don\'t rember

	These are damage tables for TNE or Brilliant Lances. For surface
hits, you roll 1d20 to see which area you hit. Then consult the SH
column to find out what\'s in that area. If there\'s something there,
roll again to see what you hit, or if you missed everything that was
in that area (they don\'t necessarily occupy the whole area: on a roll
of 18, above, the air lock only occupies a small part. On a roll of 1
you hit the airlock, otherwise just the bare hull). If you damage
something, subtract its damage rating from the attack. If the
remaining damage is greater than zero, there\'s enough energy left to
go into the armor. Multiply the armor by the weapon\'s penetration
rating to determine how much of the attack is absorbed by the hull,
and subtract that from the remaining damage. If anything is left
over, the attack penetrates to the corresponding internal location
(18, in this case). Roll again to see which portion of the internal
space you hit, and apply remaining damage there.

	If you\'re using a meson gun, ignore surface hits and armor, and
proceed directly to internal explosions.

	To create the table: buy FF&S (v1) or Brilliant Lances.

Sound like it is not to hard to adapt for T4.  I assume that you just take 
the total area and take the percentage that each componet takes up, and the 
same for internal?  The question is what order do I but them in?  If there is 
an order to put them in what modifiers are there for it?  
Does the damage that the hull abosords get subtracted from the armor rating?  
and does this use the real values or the USD values?

  The format following should be easily recognizable by now - I even put in
the correct USP for the F-5! A close look at the drop tank numbers will show
a very ironic trend :)  Last time I checked Cr ~465 was lower than Cr 950.

F-1 1kt JumpExpressCo Main Liner XR-A411121-050000-55000-0  MCr 187.2  1kt TL F
        Cargo=728. Passengers=17. LHyd=110. EP=10. Agility=0. Low=0. Crew=8.

F-5 1kt JumpExpressCo Fast Liner XR-A451552-050000-85000-0  MCr 452.4  1kt TL F
        Cargo=196. Passengers=17. LHyd=550. EP=50. Agility=1. Low=0. Crew=10.

  Calculations are approximate - maintenance at 0.1%, wages, life support, 
and fuel are ignored below. Cargo charge is low, as some portion of revenue
is from passage charged at a similar premium.
 Unit  Mortgage/a.  basic rev./a.  Premium  Cargo charge
  F-1   MCr  9.36      MCr 31.08      -69%     > Cr   305
  F-5   MCr 22.62      MCr 12.46      >82%     > Cr 1,820

DROP TANKS - 50% cost recovery of tanks:
 Unit  Ops. Cost/a.  basic rev./a.  Premium  Cargo charge
  F-1   MCr 11.11      MCr 34.58      -67%     > Cr   350
  F-5   MCr 31.37      MCr 32.20      = 0%     ~ Cr 1,000

NZ release date is June 10, how come UK is so far behind ?

My eldest son is going to the very first showing with his mates, which is at
12.05am, just after midnight. The rest of the family is going 5.45pm with
about 30 of my roleplaying mates and their families, thanks to one of our
number who went down at 5.00am on the day ticket sales started.

Both of these _are_ Turing machines, they are just different implementations
of the same concept
The original layman\'s description of a Turing machine,  the one talking
about paper tapes and such, describes an analogue device.

There\'s a reason the Turing universal machine is called that, it\'s because
_any_ machine, can be desribed by it, irrespective of how it is constructed.

I would agree they don\'t have a  von Neumann  architecture, but that\'s a
different thing, it may be that which you are thinking of.

>Quantum devices - also not Turing machines -

Not entirely true. The SQuID is a quantum device and was originally produced
in the 1980\'s

Which, btw, are also Turing machines. (just extremely complex ones)
And which has already been done at least once on this planet.

I think you\'re being a bit hard, AI is TL16 according to Traveler, so if
we\'re on the threshold of it, even TL10 sounds a bit low.

  Well we do have that now (its been around since the early 60\'s. Its called..

core ram (it uses iron ferrite cores on a matrix of lines) once the data is written it stays till changed. But it is really too bulky to use in todays PC\'s but can still be used on Mainframes.

This is like a "French Old Guard" model but there are others:

	Third in line children of the nobility (the first in line become
	a planetary governors, the second in line become fleet admirals)
	This would help tie the Imperial family to the nobility,
	alough it does risk the possibility of advancement by

	A hereditary guard, this would promote the loyalty of the guard
	to the Emperor. The guard has no loyalty to the nobility.
	Dismissal from the Guard would be a punishment that destroyed
	the birthright of all your successive generations.

	A "standard" mercenary ticket. Allows the optimisation of cost
	versus performance. (The TL16 unit from FFW would be my choice.)
	This would surely fit the ethos of "economics is everything."

	One small planet, particularly noted for its fighters (because
	its a frontier world with severe geography) provides the
	guard who uphold not only their own honour but that of their
	entire planet.

I believe that all of the above methods have been used by countries
here on Earth. The main problem of using combat veterans is that:
	(a) it weakens the units they are drawn from,
	(b) they might not be the most suitable for the ceremonial
	    standing around that is required,
	(c) you end up with all your best troops in a unit that is
	    too valuable/high profile to use in combat.

Lucas obviously was going for more of a "classic film" feel with this one.
Did you know that Ronald Reagan was originally supposed to play Rick in The
Phantom Menace?

IMTU, the Darrians once held a monastic order of Zen-like 
quasi-psionic martial artists, simply called "Artists" in the 
current parlance.  Kind of a cross between the Jedi Knights and the 
Siblings of the Shroud (from Steve Perry\'s Matador series), these 
Darrian Artists held much the same role in society as the Jedi do in 
the Star Wars milieu.  After the "Maghiz" (sp?), much of the 
technology to build "plasma sabers" was lost, except to a small 
handful of masters who had limited access to the process of building 
the sabers.  These secrets have been passed down from generation to 
generation, and only a few surviving Artists remain.  Most Artists 
follow the Quest of Enlightment, while their enemies, a distant 
branch of Artists known collectively as the Hand, follow the Path of 
Darkness.  (I never got around to coming up with better sounding 
Darrian names for them.  My apologies.)

Their "plasma sabers" were based on the premise from the Darrian CT 
Alien Module that depicted a TL 16ish art form called plasma 
sculptures.  Plasma sculptures use gravitic fields to control the 
flow of plasma to arrive at some very beautiful and potentially 
deadly artforms.  Used in a military capacity, a small hand-held 
generator was designed to produce a sword-like field of plasma, which 
was rather devastating in its effectiveness.  (Thankfully, they are 
not mass-produced.)

Some say that the Order of the Artists may be making a return to 
Darrian culture, but not with the recognition that they once had.  
Only time will tell.

As for game system stats (weapon stats, chargen notes, etc), I have 
them buried somewhere at home.  If anyone\'s interested, I\'ll attempt 
to find them and present them.  They are, however, in MT format, and 
I may have to convert them.  I can do the chargen, but I don\'t use 
the T4 combat system, and so don\'t know how to convert the sabers 
over.  Any thoughts on that would be cool to see.

Thanks,
Jason

I very much doubt that either Blade Runner or Outland would have been made
without the success of Star Wars to pave the way. Before Star Wars, there
was very little SF being made on film. 2001 was a rare exception, and that
was in 1968, 10 years before Star Wars. What Star Wars did was to show
the powers-that-be in the movie industry that one could make money in SF
films, which was thought to be too small of a niche market beforehand.

Incidentally, it was the success of Star Wars which also made Paramount
decide to turn Star Trek into what became a series of big-screen films
rather than go ahead with a second tv series with the original cast...

In the first session of the GURPS Traveller campaign which I started
recently, 
the PCs had busted up a drug-manufacturing plant and had captured some of the 
people responsible, including a minor planetary official who required
hospitalization. The day after the capture, one of the PCs went to interrogate
said official... when the official remained uncooperative, the PC took out a 
small bag of iridescent white powder (looking very much like the finished
product of the drug processing plant) and threatened to spike the official\'s
IV with it. The official spilled his guts and told him everything... at which
point the PC started eating the poweder, which turned out to be just some
powdered candy...

It\'s one of the fun tricks you can play on recruits.  Get them to hold down

There are already critters like this in use in the mining industry.  Some
ores are extremely difficult to recover the desired mineral from (gold from
arsenopyrites spring to mind).  There has been a fair bit of work done with
various greeblies in an attempt to get them to eat and remove the gangue
minerals.  Such an organism could cause huge amounts of damage to a ship.

No offense taken.  For Computer/Robotics TL information, I am looking 
in the CT LBB Book 8:Robots, under the article entitled the Computer 
Brain; CT\'s Grand Census extended benchmark Technology profiles, 
divided into specific branches of technological concerns; and MT\'s 
Referee\'s Companion, in the Technology article.  In another post, I 
gave some specific page numbers, if you need them.

That would be CT LBB2 or LBB3, right?  (Can\'t remember which one.  My 
bad.)  Under the extended tables of CT\'s Grand Census, the computer 
model numbers have been allocated to the "associated technologies" 
column, meaning that these are additional technological achievements 
commonly associated with a technology, but are not the benchmark 
technologies used to determine TL classification under those 
categories.  That was my viewpoint on my assumptions.  Based solely 
on the limited TL profiles granted very early on in CT, without 
looking at later LBBs and additional supplements, then model is the 
sole determinant of computing power.  Using that aspect only, you are 
entirely correct in assuming a current TL12 for computers.  However, 
I like the more evolved extended TL tables based on accomplishment of 
benchmark technology, which tends to put processing power as an 
associated technology, not as a determining factor in achieving TL 
classification.  A matter of preferences.  MTU only, YMMV.

> I don\'t see a Tech Level table in the MegaTraveller books...

See MT Referee\'s Companion for more details on technological 
advances.  It\'s under the Technology article.

> I don\'t have the TNE rules, so can\'t check that.

Neither do I, but if such info exists, it is most assuredly based on 
the CT material as set forth by Grand Census and, for matters of 
computers and robotics, Book 8: Robots.

Such year ranges are given as guidelines only, and it explicitly 
states such in the text explaining the tech tables.

<sarcasm>

If we don\'t have stardrive technology in ten years, then I would
like to make a motion that we consider the dates listed on the tech
level table of CT, etc, to be guidelines the authors _wished_ we\'d
be at by then, and ignore them as references for determining current
or advanced technology within our Traveller games.

</sarcasm>

Even canon supports the fact that they are guidelines, as the OTU has 
Earth gaining this technology in 2087AD, not 1990-2000, as Jump-1 (TL 
9) is explicitly listed under the tech tables.

Just an observation.

Point taken on the non-volatile memory.  Obviously, the technology 
exist, but I don\'t see it as commonplace.  However, if you believe 
that it is sufficient to qualify for the TL 9 benchmark, as described 
(material quoted in a previous post), then that\'s cool.  We\'re at TL 
9, with novelty technology at TL 10, possibly higher, based on your 
assessment of the equipment available at TL 10, 11 and 12.

<Rest of Bruce\'s excellent example of TL10 Voice recognition snipped>

Exactly my point.  The technology is in its infancy, but it is there. 
 Once it becomes capable of our perceptions of TL10 Voice Recognition 
and once it becomes commonplace, as your example described, then we 
will have made that transitional benchmark regarding TL10 advancement 
under the Computer/Robotics technology.  We are still a long way from 
it, but not that far away, all things considered.  :)

Thanks for the entertaining discussions, everyone.  This has been 
very cool.

I had once upon a time worked a light saber into the game.  I used a slightly
modified version of the "SnapShot" and added blasters and light sabers.  

The biggest problem is that they go out of scope from Traveller\'s Sci-Fi 
background to more of a "Space Opera/Science Fantasy" setting.  The weapons
really didn\'t fit in.  I\'m in Texas now and my books are at home in NC.
If I can find my "Chart", I will try to upload the data.  I built a chart 
mixing in weapon and shield adjustments to form a simple look up table.
It was something like: (I\'m making this up, just showing you the layout)

Weapon Damage  No Armor       Cloth        Battle Dress
               C  S  M  L     C  S  M  L   C  S  M  L
9mm    2D      3  5  9  11    5  9  11 15  9  13 18 21

The CSML is the range (Close, Short, Medium, Long) and the number is what you have
to roll on 2d6 + mods to score the Damage in data.  Its been several years since
I have even looked at the stuff.

Any way, back to your question, what might be more practice is to introduce a 
mono-filimant or vibro-blade.

A scientific way to build one is to have a mono-filimant wire attached to a spool
and a mirror.  When you turn the light saber on, the energy pushes the mirror out
to the length of the mono-filimant wire.  The mirror and one built into the handle
act as a focusing reflector to concentrate the beam.

However it would be an energy sword.  A light saber in the hands of a jedi does
a lot more than hack through things.  I don\'t want to spoil the movie for any one,
but the light saber is a most interesting tool.  These things are a lot harder
to build into Traveller.

There were plenty of sci-fi films before Star Wars came along. You can take
a peek at the internet movie database if you don\'t believe me
 http://www.imdb.com ). Much of the sci-fi films of the era (between the
late 60s and the late 70s) dealt with apocalyptic themes, either what might
happen after we blew ourselves up, or how we would get around to blowing
ourselves up... some films were about what might happen if we didn\'t blow
ourselves up but what might happen if we continued to become dehumanized.
That genre was beginning to dry up by the time that Star Wars was made.
Historically, a good number of sci-fi films either carried a message or
conveyed some sort of social commentary.

In one fell swoop Lucas proved that a sci-fi movie could be brainless (and I
mean that in a nice way) and lots of rip-roaring fun. Although I\'ve never
heard Lucas\'s own comment on the subject, I don\'t think it\'s an accident
that the introductory text to Star Wars starts with "A long time ago, in a
galaxy far, far away..."  It was futuristic, but it wasn\'t the future.

The good guys were really good[1] and the bad guys were really evil, unlike
alot of the movies from that era.

The popularity of Star Wars is a mixed blessing for sci-fi (and movies in
general). While it paved the way for films like Blade Runner and a host of
others, it also paved the way for stuff like Independence Day and
Armageddon. Whiz bang special effects could be substituted for story, plot
and character development...

Not that Saturday Afternoon Matinee films are a bad thing. Sometimes it\'s
fun to leave your brain at the door and watch lots of explosions and
gorgeous effects.

[1] Note: Despite the supposedly egalitarian society of the rebellion all
sentients are not created equal. Everybody but Chewbacca gets a medal for
their work against the empire at the end of Star Wars. Maybe the good guys
aren\'t really as nice as we think they are.

Considering that some of us may not get to see the movie for a

restraint from postings that do not directly relate to Traveller.
For instance, compairing Coruscant to Capital/Core would probably

Well, no , not unless it was a very, VERY old mainframe. Modern mainframes use
conventional DRAM.

Amazingly enough I was going to post about that this morning. I\'m reading
"Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins of the Internet" and they were
describing very first routers, IMPs (Interface Message Processors) which were
Honeywell 516 minicomputers with 12k of core memory. The authors said that the
average personal computer, if it used the same core memory as theoriginal
IMP\'s, would cover a football field. They would configure and test them at BBN
in Massachusetts, turn them off, and ship them to whereever they were being
installed. They would then , basically plug them in and turn them on, and
they\'d start up right where they were turned off in Mass. 

However, that got me to wondering. They\'re doing some amazing things with \'not
quite nano\'technology these days, microscopic gears, electric cars half the
size of a rice grain, arrays of aimable mirrors, etc. I wonder whether ferrite
core memory would work on that scale. While this would _still_ be a lot more
powerhungry and larger than conventional ram, it would be a lot smaller than
any handmade core memory (and it was _all_ hand made...I don\'t think they ever
automated that process). It would make computers much larger. It would also be
a severe bitchkitty to make, at least the first few times. Fortunately it
doesn\'t depend on round conductors, so I would think it could be done using
current etching and deposition technology. But IANAEE, so I don\'t know.

CLOSE ENCOUNTERS

The search for extraterrestrial life is not an easy task. In order to
detect the weakest signals that may lie within data collected by radio
telescopes, an incredible amount of computing power is required. Instead
of contracting a super-computer for the job, SETI@home (the Search for
Extraterrestrial Intelligence at Home) has created a screensaver that
will harness the power of thousands of Internet-connected computers in
its quest for alien intelligence. The project wants to borrow some of
your PC\'s processing cycles; using the Internet, the screensaver will
request a chunk of data gathered from the Arecibo telescope in Puerto
Rico, analyze it, and report the results back to SETI. The analysis takes
place only when your system is idle, so the program never impacts your
work or play. The software keeps track of where each piece of work is
done, so if your PC is involved in the detection, you can be listed as a
co-discoverer.

Yes...they\'re called diamonds. Also synthetic rubies, sapphires, etc. Nylon
monofilament is a monomolecular structure.

Yes, they\'re using synthetic gems in all sorts of industrial applications.
Nylon monofilament is used in a host of applications.

Actually, I know where you\'re leading, to Niven\'s General Products Monohulls.

The problem is, even if you did make a gigantic monomolecular polymer mass, it
would not be much stronger, if at all, than conventional polymers of the same
mass. Molecular bonds can be strong on a _molecular_ scale, but on a macro
scale they\'re still pretty weak.

Nylon monofilament _is_ strong, but on a macro scale it\'s relatively easy to break.

In many cases Van Der Waals forces are stronger. If you tear a piece of paper 
or break a monofilament fishing line you\'re breaking molecular bonds, mostly
covalent bonds, as you tear the fiber(s). 

If you poke through a piece of polyethylene film, you\'re breaking primarily
Van Der Waals forces (if I remember my organic chemistry) as such polymer
films are exssentially, spaghetti-like aggregates of long molecular chains
which get the majority of their strength from Van Der Waals attraction of the
uncharged polymer strands. You\'re poushing your way through the mass of
strands whihc slowly give way to your finger. If you poke through it with a
sharp objct you go through it far more easily.

Niven Sinclair monofilament, and GP Monohulls have their bonds artificially
strengthened, somehow, and so are equivalent to bonded superdense. Yes you
_can_ make starship hulls from bonded superdense all in one piece.  The
problem then arises: what do you do when you have to access something from the
outside? Do you dissolve the entire hul? Cut holes in it and and re-weld them
somehow, Or do you build the thing out of separate fastened sections so you
can get at stuff 60 years down the line when you have to replace the Jump Drive.

Here\'s one I put together when I first bought GT.  It\'s really a
frontier prospecting vessel that might easily fall into the hands of
P----s.  The numbers should be okay, but I must warn you that I\'m not a

Enerison Spaceworks has been manufacturing vessels for slightly over one
hundred years.  Their most 
famous design is the "Fred C. Dobbs" class, a typical example of a large
belt prospector.  Having 
been in service for decades, the "Dobbs" class has a favorable
reputation among the belter 
community.  Standard onboard facilities include a geology lab used to
examine ores and a fuel 
processor capable of refining enough fuel for a jump 1 in 2.5 hours. 
But the most noted feature of 
the "Dobbs" is its large spacedock/cargo bay, affectionately termed the
rockdock.   With its doors 
opened to space, and with skillful and careful maneuvering on the part
of both pilot inside the ship 
and vacc suited belters outside, the rockdock is quite capable of
swallowing whole asteroids. 



Hope it works for you, at least until GT Starships comes out.

Surely, a Turing Machine can describe an analogue computer; but an
analogue computer need not be able to describe a Turing Machine.

Lucas has repeatedly stated that the main inspiration for Star Wars were
the old \'Saturday Matinee\' adventure movies and serials. As such, Star
Wars has got a lot more in common with "Captain Blood" and "Robin Hood"
(the Errol Flynn version) than it does "2001", "Silent Running" or
"Planet of the Apes", \'social message\' films each and every one.

Star Wars is better pigeonholed as Science Fantasy, but stating that it
was the \'death\' of Science Fiction films is a load of hogwash. It didn\'t
do that any more than Apocalypse Now killed the heroic War Movie genre,
even though popular film _still_ resonates mightily with the tone and
imagery that Apocalypse set, much as Star Wars did for SF film. 

If I _ever_ see another ripoff opening shot of sillohuetted helicopters
moving in slow motion, moody music not quite drowning out the \'whop\'
\'whop\' \'whop\' of the blades, I\'ll scream,even though, in its way that is
as powerful an establishing shot as the entrance of the Imperial Cruiser
is to Star Wars. Witness the number of people ripping it off.

She was better in BBCTV\'s \'Jude\' and it had a depressing ending ;-)

As in Hardy and \'the Obscure\'.

Star Wars vs Titanic? Maybe
Empire Strikes Back vs Titanic, ESB wins.

That\'s *precisely* what happened.  Survival Margin (pgs 69-71 or thereabouts).

Mmm... SM is pretty clear Lucan did that, just because he didn\'t want anyone 
trying to do any parallel r&d.

Yeah, kinda.  The Cymbeline chips are the ancestors of Virus.

Yup, that\'s why there\'s an "evangelical doomslayer" strain that goes coreward 
along the Vampire Highway to go "kill Lucan."

Of course, I don\'t have any journals from the future... but you might want to

Sensor data?  What are you talking about?  It has physically come along (in 
whatever state it\'s in... as EM energy) by commo, to either the transponder 
or the tight beam commo system, thence into the main computer (both of which 
have a connection).  It\'s not in a data format.  Excepting "eggs."

I\'ve never called it sensor data "like a picture."  I don\'t recognise anyone 
having said anything like that, actually, though I\'ve went through about 30 
digests in a maybe 2 or 3 hours.

No.  Virus is consistent with the internal rules that have been attributed to 
it.  Not whether it makes to TL-8 computer science.

Since you\'re the one attempting to debunk it, you have to prove that they 
will.  Of course, it\'s impossible either way.  I just happen to think the cs 
in your Traveller game is boring.   We\'re not much higher than TL-9 (canon 
for optical data storage) or maybe 10 in computer tech (as a novelty maybe) 
today.  That we\'re TL-12 or higher is ludicrous given the attributes (though 
not the corny 70s capabilities from CT) ascribed to Traveller starship 
computers (especially as opposed to personal hand/wristcomps of which there 
has has been little).

Given the homogenous state of not just Imperial space, but practically 
everyone except the Vargr and Aslan (though much more than Vargr, due to 
clans, etc), it\'s equally likely the others are too.  Those are precisely the 
areas that Virus was slower, precisely due to those reasons.

It\'s physically altering the circuitry to make the hideyhole. Don\'t need to 
know anything about the OS.  It watches and learns after it\'s safe.  No 
(noticable) activity till it\'s ready to take control.  That\'s where it\'s 
relation to the Cymbeline predator plays in, though it is not an exact 
Cymbeline predator.

Virus is not the chip, though.  It\'s a distant descendant.  It doesn\'t need 
the chip body anymore.  It\'s capabilites operate on the similar manner, but 
not identically.  It\'s evolved more.  Could u buy that?  Or at least think 
bout it?

What you call a strawman is not a strawman.  A strawman is something put up 
to be knocked down.  Something to lure u in deeper.  U want to call apples 
oranges lemme know and i\'ll play.  Randomly changing the definition words can

Whatever works, slick.  :-)  As has been mentioned, an abacus fits the 
dictionary definition of computer. 

Computer (kem pyoot \'er) n.  a person or thing that computers; specif., a 
machine that performs rapid often complex calculations or compiles, 
correlates, and selects data: see also analog computer, digital computer, 
synaptic computer.

Ok.  The last one is my addition. ;-)

That\'s alot of room for Virus to fit in.

That\'s the fundamental problem w/ your understanding of Virus.  It is not a 
program.  The name "virus" is a misnomer.  It\'s a life form that lives in 
electronics like a fish lives in water.  The Cymbeline chip is it\'s greatly 
primitive and distant ancestor.

Nah.  Just yanking your chain.  I do typos and deliberate (and lazy)

Not w/ synaptics, you don\'t.  Nor with holographic crystal storage.  Nor 
with... etc, etc.   I respect what you do, but you\'re mistaking that things 
will never change or develop.  It\'s entirely possible you\'re right, but 
that\'s pretty durned boring for a far future rpg IMO.

Cause it\'s crazy?  Cause it wasn\'t done when it was accidently released?  The 
thing you haven\'t been grasping is it\'s not just a Cymbeline predator.  It\'s 
beyond it.  The capabilities are based on, but not identical to.  Though, of 
course, I disagree on your particular identification of "stupid" qualities.

That\'s all it took.  It spread and spread and spread until practically 
everyone was infected, before the tech started to rebel.  If you got the news 
about the rebeling technology, you got the Virus (since the Xboat network got 
infected, too, as well as Dulinor and Lucan\'s fleets, and the couriers sent 
back to report, etc).

From the transponder through the direct and unimpeded access to the main

That\'s different than turning into a Vampire.  They did not do that.  Your 
memory is faulty.  Plus, those two fleets were an exception because the Virus 
was purposely beamed straight into Dulinors main comp (and SM explicitly says 
he disregarded advise against data contamination) because he wanted to 
analyze the "weapons data" not realizing he had the actual weapon.

Didn\'t miss it at all.  It can have physical contact, as we talk about in the

Can I safely assume that SJG used the emblems I designed for them?
I haven\'t heard a peep from Loren since I put them up on my web

As for making them available in GIF or JPG, you only need to get Loren\'s

Derek Stanley, who\'s here on and the on TNE-RCES posted this once upon a 
time.  Though i haven\'t asked permission, i\'m relatively sure Derek won\'t 
have a problem (and can flay me later if he does).

I ran an adventure once awhile after I read this.  Was hella fun, though also 
had large elements of tragedy.

I\'ve been doing a great deal of thinking about the effects of the
collapse and I think we\'re taking a great deal of things for granted.

********************************************************************

Imagine if you will.  You\'re living on the planet Nubnub near the core
of some Imperial noble\'s territory.  Now there\'s a war that\'s been going
on for nearly a decade, you\'ve never really seen the war, well not much
just a few beat up ships and injured soldiers on the Vid\'s, pictures of
war but nothing local.  One morning you wake up on your own, damn alarm
didn\'t go off because there\'s a power outage.  Now this isn\'t out of the
ordinary so you\'re not terribly alarmed.  You pick up the phone, or
whatever the local equivilant is to tell your boss you\'re going to be
late and you notice that the phone acting up, this wierd sqealie noise.

So you hustle it to get to work, cold shower, water heater operates off
electric power.  Cold cereal, you close the fidge quickly, don\'t wan\'t
to lose any of that cold air.  You\'d prefer hot oatmeal but the cookers
are all electic so you suffer in silence.  Rushing out to your grav-car
you notice that the local traffic net is down and there\'s only a
fraction of the traffic you\'d expect to see on a monday morning.  Five
minutes later you show up at the office, no power again, what you
thought was just a local outage seems to have effected the whole city.
So you walk up the thirty floors to your office, there\'s no coffee, no
tea just cold water.  None of the computers work, due in large part to
the power outage so you and your friends sit around for most of the day
listening to a portable radio someone abandoned in the lunchroom decades
ago.  One of the girls had a spare set of battaries in her desk and
aparntly the radio station is running off a generator in their basement.

You start to hear stories, apparently the main powerplant for the city
went critical sometime during the night and destroyed most of the
underwater parts of the town.  Emergency vehicles are everywhere trying
to put out fires caused by drivers trying to log onto the traffic net
and having their cars go wild and apparently a huge chunk of the
Whiteside Arcology collapsed in the middle of the night when all three
sets of back up gravitic generators failed to come on line.  Things are
looking bad so you and the people from work decide to pool your
resources and spent the night at Dale\'s place because at least he has an
emergency generator.

On your way home the sky is thick with smoke, somethings really wrong
and you watch in horror as a public transit airfilm jumps it\'s tracks
and tears through four blocks of industrial complex and residential
housing.  At home you quickly throw all you\'re perishable\'s into a bag
for transport to Dale\'s house, working quickly you grab some clothes and
a heavy parka, winter\'s just around the corner and you never know how
cold it might get tonight.

Two hours later you show up at Dale\'s.  Three of the ten of the ten from
the office never show up.  The fires continue on through the night, you
watch in horror as the cities secondary power plant suddenly comes on
line.  Lights up half the city to a million candle power before going
critical and nuking the entire south side in a blinding flash of
supercritical plasma.

Four day\'s later you\'re begining to run low on food, the police had
instituted a dusk till dawn curfu in an attempt to control the rioters.
Dale suggests making a quick trip to your house to grab all your canned
food and the remainder of the hydrogen from your grav-car\'s fuel tank to
keep the generator running.  When you get home you discover that most of
your neighborhood has been systematically looted, a two day old corpse
lies in your living room and anything of value has been systematically
removed.  Fortunately they were just after material goods and not food
so you quickly clear out the cupboards and basement.  Dale for some
reason grabs all your knives, an old fashioned set of binoculars your
grandfather gave you before scooping all the medical supplies he can
find in your bathroom.  Though you ask him why, Dale just grunts and
tells you to grab the warmest clothes you can find.  Twenty minutes late
you finish loading up his truck when Edward and Delilah return from
scouting out your neighbors houses.  Dale looks happy with their prizes
and you all hop back into the truck for the return trip.

On the fifth day things have gone from bad to worse, the authorities
stopped trying to put out the fires when chuncks of the orbital A-Class
starport began falling out of orbit.  Though much of it burned up on
re-entry a large chunk of it fell on the mountians to the south carving
out a kilometer long scar in the planets surface and starting thousands
of fires.

It\'s now ten days since the power went out.  The sky is dark now, and
the smell of smoke is everywhere.  Pieces of the starport still streak
across the skies at regular intervals.  Dale shut off the generator
nearly a week ago and packed you all up into his truck with the remains
of your food and supplies.  The looters had showed up the day before
that and you\'d killed ten of them before they finally fled, Dale decided
he\'d had enough and it was time to leave.

It\'s been fifteen day\'s now the burned out wreckage of a thousand car
pile up chokes the Freeway in front of you.  That first body in your
house shocked you, you couldn\'t help but throw up, you\'ve seen so many
bodies now they don\'t even phase you.  Sarah from accouting still
cringes but you\'re numb.  You have to abandon the truck and start
walking

Nearly a month has passed, you count yourself among the lucky, you\'re
still alive, finding food has become increasingly difficult and the
canned food you started with ran out over a week ago.  A pair of soldier
joined up with you last week their unit had been over run by a starving
mob.  They\'ve got rifles and some extra ammunition, your handgun\'s
running preciously low.  The hill top you\'re standing on overlooks a
small town burned to the ground.  A dozen empty vehicles lay abandoned
on the side of the road.  To conserve his lighter Dale\'s been pulling
one of the lenses out of your binoculars and using it to light fires.
He\'s a pretty smart guy that Dale, you probably wouldn\'t have made it
this far without him, but winter\'s approaching and you still don\'t have
any shelter or long term supplies.  Dale says not to worry, but you
can\'t help it.

The first snow fell last night, you feel pretty sorry for anyone not in
door\'s like you and the rest of Dale\'s people.  Dale knew about this
small town nestled in a remote valley near the northern edge of the
mountians, he had friends there, family you might say.  Dale had always
been afraid it might come to something like this so him and a group of
his Scout Service buddies had made arraingements.  Stockpiled enough
supplies for a season, seed, some weapons and even a few other
essentials.  It\'s been more than two months since you\'ve had the
electricity to shave, but at least you\'re safe here, for a while at
least.  Who knows about tommorow, but today at least you\'re safe, warm
and alive.  Thats more than you can say for half the people on your
planet and winter\'s just coming.

********************************************************************

Think about it carefully, you\'ve got no power, how many things do you
rely on that use power?

Could you make power?  How?

Could you aquire food?  How about perserve it?

What would you consider the bare essentials for survival?  The clothes
on your back?  The clothes in your closet?  A gun?  A knife?

How long could you survive on a weeks rations?  How would you build
shelter?  Keep warm?  Could you start a fire with the contents of your
pockets?  What about in two months when your lighter runs out of fuel,
what would you do then?

Think about it and we\'re only TL8, now imagine falling from TL15.  Look
at the contents of your pockets.  Key\'s flat little pieces of metal yet
we\'re totally screwed with out them, imagine if everything your life
depended on suddenly stopped working.  What would happen then?

Hey! Welcome to Dallas!

The *best* gaming store is in Valley View Mall located on
the north service road of Highway 635 and just east of the
North Dallas Tollway.

Step 1)  Get a map of Dallas if you don\'t have one; you\'ll
             need it.
Step 2)  Your goal is to get on 635 and go east towards
             Dallas. You probably need to take 121 to 114, &
             then to 635 but check your map.
Step 3)  Once you\'re on 635 going east, go *past* the
             Tollway and take the Montfort exit.
Step 4)  Take a left onto Montfort (go north) and the
             huge place to your right is the mall.
Step 5)  Park on the south side of the mall.
Step 6)  Enter the mall and look for a store called
             "The Gamechest".
Step 7)  Ask to speak to Kevin; I\'ve had him put your
             name on a copy of "First In" and hide it behind
             the counter.  BTW, there is NO obligation to buy.

You can call the Gamechest at (972) 490-7814 if you need
better directions. If the Mall is too far out of your way,
feel free to just not show up; they\'ll put the copy back in
stock in a few days.

I know what you mean.  That lightsaber fight was incredible.  Unfortunately, 
I had spoiled the outcome by skimming a bit of a graphic novel beforehand.  : 
|  

Also makes me want to do some musings on Traveller psionics.  ;-)  Also to 
whip out my "Tales of the Jedi Companion" by WEG.

I\'d have to agree. I didn\'t find him very amusing till he got his tongue 
numbed.  Then I actually noticed I was laughing at alot of his scenes.  He 
was hilarious as a "general," too.  His hijinks actually saved alot of 
Gungans...

As far as understanding him... I could understand bout half of what he said.  
I listen to a 120mm main gun go off nearby all too often, too and have 
notoriously bad hearing.

I dunno bout the next game... but definately coming up.  Course, I\'ve already 
done speederbikes and swoops.  ;-)

>Worth the money. No question.

I concur.  I\'ve heard alot of people bashing hte plot (and we all know how 
valuable the opinion of professional critics are, don\'t we?), but it did 
accomplished any possible goals it had.  Did it well, in fact.  It\'s actually 
too subtle in places IMO, though not if, as it seems, it\'s drawing on 
knowledge of the Episodes IV through VI.

The cinematography is outstanding, w/o a doubt.

The OS is the method that would be needed to make tyhe change.  If it did
not control the OS it could not make the burn without direct physical

No, not at all.  It violated to many laws of physics.  The only way the

No it does not.  Have you read it?  The abacus is a memnonic tool for the

Look you are mixing your paradiums.  If it is not a program it can not
\'possess\' a computer without physical contact to burn itself in.  If it is
transmited it is a program.  

There is no third state unless you are preposing a purely energy creature,
like a ghost, that just happens to need a host like a computer.  If that is
your paradium them it is a psionic entity as I suggested.

Why do you think it is boring?  What limits do you think it would put on the
virus that would make it boring.  You must be skimming my posts.  One of my
complaints is that the virus is not a powerfull as it should be.  It should
be much worse than it is portrayed.

Also Traveller chose to discribe the virus in 20th century terms.  As the
authers made that choice I would say that is pretty much how it works.  The
authers also use other 20th century terms to discribe traveller computers so
those terms must be acurate as the writter are the creaters of cannon.

So it is an \'electrical\' ghost and able to manipulate it\'s energy \'body\' to
cause the effect discribed?  If so then your discrition is self consistant
as logical.  What I would like to know is what creature they crossed with

Not really, I conseeded that one fairly quickly once Bruce and some others

Frankly if I was in the pirates shoes, I take up smuggling.

Depends on your assumptions.  With analog controls of the commo gear the

That is not PHYSICAL contact.  It has to be Silicon to silicon according to

Yes they are.  That is how you get a system immune to the emp.  It all works
on light.  In effect it\'s light based transiters.  They would be emmune to
the burn in effect as they do not conduct electricity in the logic and
memory curcuits.  A Virus controled computer could probably kill the FIB if
it couls gain control of robots or the main power bus controlers, assuming
the FIB is powered when not in use.  If not then only a physical attack
could take out the FIB.

That is not physical contact.  See the chip adventure for how they

Cool.  Love to see it.  But I don\'t see a light saberish weapon as being out 
of the scope of Traveller; AAMOF, I see Traveller as a great canvas *FOR* a 
\'space opera\' setting.  Where else can a handful of people affect things on a 
Galaxy-wide basis?

One of my players in my first campaign ended up with a \'plasma blade\'.  It was 
heavy (about 3 kilos), and created a \'blade\' of plasma contained in a 
projected magnetic field from the \'hilt\'.  Took 1 combat round for the \'blade\' 
to extend or retract.  Did about as much damage as a laser rifle, needed 
strength *and* dex to weild properly.  And the girl didn\'t know it, but you 
were *supposed* to wear a special glove (not included!!) to keep your hand 
from \'cooking\' from the discharge.  It could be \'active\' for about 15 mins on 
1 charge, could be recharged from a standard power tap in a starship in about 
an hour (adapter not included!!).  It was a TL16 artifact IIRC, produced in aa 
culture to spinward of the Imperium that emphasised dueling and honor...

Her plasma blade could deflect other plasma blades, of course.  Though it 
*wouldn\'t* deflect a plasma gun burst or anything (course, I didn\'t tell *HER* 
that!!!!).  First time she pulled & used it on somebody, the target said "What 
the hell *IS* that???", to which she replied "Efficient." and promptly burnt 
him to the ground.  Needless to say, they weren\'t that common a gadget...

Actually, I originally joined for Classic Traveller, but I realize no

Bite your tongue!  Then visit www.downport.com and check out the "CT
Resurgence" link.  And if you really get an itch to play, I\'ll load up the
back of my Buick and trundle "down south" for a session.  We might even be
able to get a few old timers from the Boston area to join us, what?

My main character, "Lucas Trask", is a sword worlder as well.  :)

Yeah, load the car up and come down.  I\'m in Manchester, New Hampshire.

  I may have missed something later in this thread, but why not restrict
each grouping to one "in-system box (/location) per week? TCS already does
this already (in part) with the refuelling rules.

  By adopting this a spread out defense forces the attacker to estimate
resources needed at each target (based on limited tac-intel) without even
knowing whether a given targets defenders are indeed outclassed or whether
they will to stay put for the supposed battle - the safest disengagement
by acceleration is when your enemy is decelerating and you head off at an
acute angle to their course :>

  And that\'s before allowing for defending SDB\'s sitting quietly in a
position to interfere with an action.

This was the problem I was explaining to people here at my game session last
Saturday.  Star Wars, and this new movie is no exception, is NOT science
fiction.  It is fantasy.  Pure and simple.

It takes place in space, past that, thats it.

BTW, I saw the movie and I loved it.  You just have to go with the right
frame of mind :)

of technology is TL:That or TL:Other. I\'m specially thinking about
the various computer treads and the Terra TL tread. I think much of
the problem is caused by the different interpretations of capabilities of 
the TL is caused by the way TL have been described.

I\'m now thinking about several posters (no malice intended but I think your 
reasoning is faulty) who have claimed that todays computers are TL10-12) or 
that Earth\'s novelty TL is 10. It often seems like they have looked at the 
TL description and said:

- - Well, voice control of a computer is TL10. We have computers/programs that 
can handle voice control therefore we have computer TL:10.

I have a friend who had a, IIRC, 486 20MHz (back in the good old days)
that used voice recognition. Would this mean that a 486 is a TL:10
computer? Of course it wouldn\'t.

Voice control at TL7-8 (whatever a 486 should be) and other supposedly 
higher TL items (the F-117 for example) are mostly either experimental, 
"cutting edge" or novelty tech. They are however still TL7-9 something. 
Disclaimers for slip-ups, truth is strangers fiction, 22 year old edition of 
our favourite game etc apply. (Hey this game is older than me! :) Wonder if 
it will outlast me?)

Most if not all the TL descriptions I have seen (I got TNE, T4, GT and some 
MT) give me the impression of describing _common_ technologies not the first 
introduction of said technology. By TL10 the mouse/keyboard have been 
replaced by voice control thats why it has been described as a TL10 
technology.

Novelty tech is novelty tech and doesnt rate a special mentioning in the 
description of TL:s so there is really no canon TL for those.

The other problem is that the OTU and many other (personal) TUs have 
different assumptions on, for example, how hard AI is to achieve but that is 
another ballgame and YTU can be anything you like. It is however difficult 
to come to a consensus when everyone uses different assumptions and so we 
get endless series of 30k mails about these subjects.

Now I will stop before this turns into another 30k post.

Look up Lone Star Comics in the phone book.
Several locations - one should be close.
But I\'d call about Gurps stuff.
The other two places I know are in North Dallas
in Prestonwood Mall and Valley View Mall.
Don\'t recall the names.

I haven\'t seen a canon mentioning of this ever. It would be important enough 
to be warrant a line or two somewhere. The Imperium subsidies
ships not tickets so the supply/demand/cost of interstellar traffic should 
determine the price of the ticket.

If they fill up quickly you definitely have a market thus they would be 
(more) common.

However, that got me to wondering. They\'re doing some amazing things
with \'not
quite nano\'technology these days, microscopic gears, electric cars half
the
size of a rice grain, arrays of aimable mirrors, etc. I wonder whether
ferrite
core memory would work on that scale. While this would _still_ be a lot
more
powerhungry and larger than conventional ram, it would be a lot smaller
than
any handmade core memory (and it was _all_ hand made...I don\'t think
they ever
automated that process). It would make computers much larger. It would
also be
a severe bitchkitty to make, at least the first few times. Fortunately
it
doesn\'t depend on round conductors, so I would think it could be done
using
current etching and deposition technology. But IANAEE, so I don\'t
know.

>>>> (end quoted material)
One possible technology that might fit what you are thinking of is
Magnetic Domain Memory (at least that is the name that sticks in my
memory).  It is also called "bubble memory."  This was supposed to be
the next big memory wave in the early 80s, but never came about for some
reason.  Probably the sticking point was that it was significantly more
expensive, and the initial demand wasn\'t high enough to get
manufacturing streamlined and large scale.  I understand that a limited
amount is still made for some military applications, but haven\'t heard
specific units it might be in.  Bubble memory is also non-volotile, and
could be turned off and turned back on at the exact same point in a
calculation (no hard drive needed).

 Yes, but as I tell the other game company that I do mail order business 
with, I prefer to support my local game store(s) whenever possible. Mail 
Order is nice, but without the FLGS this industry will just be dust very 
quickly...

It\'s nice when someone "gets" my screenname, it\'s actually a nice bilingual 
pun.

	Ave Nelso is Latin for "Hail Nelson", but it\'s also "Dave Nelson" 
minus the first and last letter, so its easy for people to remember (one way 
or the other depending on to whom I speak).

I have a good friend who\'s wife is a theater manager.  She got the movie in
Monday and was required to put their two copies (two of the fourplex cinema
showing it) which she spliced together all the reals.  She then had to
preview the movies to make sure they were okay. She had her husband invite
about twenty of us in for a sneak preview on Tuesday morning (a day ahead of
release.)  No lines, no crowds and a day early, first time it ever happened
to me.  The group that went chipped in and got them a gift certificate at a
good restaraunt as token of our appreciation.

I was NOT disappointed.  It was Star Wars, nothing more, nothing less and I
had a great time as did my friends I watched it with.

I just got my hands on a DEC ALPHA 21164 LX mother board and a 600Mhz EV56
CPU.  I will be loading LINUX on it Monday.  I work in the prototype lab at
Compaq in the Alpha Developement Group.  We are building Dual Processor
21264 (64 bit CPU) computers using up to 4 gig of ram running from 466Mhz to
667Mhz on the EV6 CPU.  We actually have fired up a few using a special
cooling system to 1,000Mhz in tests using the EV67 CPU.

I\'ll let the TML know how my project goes with LINUX system.

Hmmm.   I\'ll grant you both that #3 and #4 are peculiar to CT and MT, and
that I just got bit by #5.  <blush>

Let\'s call #6 a draw, BUT even in Milleau Zero you\'ve got to put up with #7:

   Just how do you maintain operational security in the vicinity of a
   Psionics Institute?

   How do you keep your PC\'s butt from getting stomped by that little

No, it ran smooth enough, and quite fast too. The problem is that the
explanations in the rulebook are poorly written, and it requires jumping
around too many pages to check everything. As well, the ship record sheets
should have come pre-filled-out for the ships used in the scenarios.

Shalom & I found that when we got to the third game we were playing at a
fairly fast clip, to the stage where filling in the record sheets before
the game was a significant portion of play time (which we solved by filling
in a sheet for each ship type, and xeroxing).

Well, I\'m just glad that I got an HP 7475A plotter (A & B sized paper)
*cheap* some years back. 

BTW, does anyone have nice plans in HPGL format sized for B sized paper?

At one place I used to work, if I\'d asked nicely (and supplied my own
paper, no doubt) I\'m pretty sure the guys in drafting might have let me
use the E size plotter and the blueprint machine. 

Of course, E sized plans are just a bit hard to use on a normal table. :-)

Mercedes Lackey has a *wonderful* short story with such types trying to
free some "cloned" dinosaurs. It\'s titled "Last Rights" and is in the

Well, actually we are now fairly certain that wormhole based time
travel won\'t worked. Someone (Stephen Hawking?) has shown that once
there\'s a time difference between the ends, moving them close enough to
travel even *microseconds* into the past will cause an effect similar
to Hawking radiation in black holes. In this case instead of the event
horizon causing the virtual particles to become real, it\'s the wormhole
allowing them to go to a different time. And the energy output in
*this* case has a positive feedback effect, such that the energy will
cascade until the wormhole is destroyed.

Congratulations. You described Magnetic Core memory. 

However, unless the CPU *and* program* are designed for it, what you
describe can\'t happen. You see, the *cpu* is not non-volatile. And it
is what stores things like current program state, and the address that
the program is currently processing.

In fact, I don\'t think a non-volatile CPU is possible, or at the very
least not *desirable*.

Want to bet? Scooby Doo was *originally* late 60s/early 70s. Traveller
wasn\'t until 1977.

  What do you mean "no one plays CT anymore"?  <grrr>

  And there are some sick ideas too...

  At TL F you can actually make asteroid-hulled freighters that are more
efficient than anything except a dispersed (open-frame) hull - and has
superior integral armour at no cash cost. Also good for people who can\'t
afford higher start up costs (-25%) but don\'t expect to need the ~800 Dt
payload of a typical 1 kt F-1. Amusingly, at yet higher TL\'s these units
become _more_ competitive as the lower power plant costs make the lower
payload % more acceptable.

F-1 1kt JumpExpressCo Liner Rock RZ-A811121-350000-55000-0  MCr 139.92  1kt TL F
        Cargo=528. Passengers=17. LHyd=110. EP=10. Agility=0. Low=0. Crew=8.

  Calculations are approximate - maintenance at 0.1%, wages, life support, 
and fuel are ignored below. Cargo charge is low, as some portion of revenue
is from passage charged at a similar premium.
 Unit  Mortgage/a.  basic rev./a.  Premium  Cargo charge

Outlands flunks due to the "explosive decompression" scenes. It
*doesn\'t* work that way.

Oh, I believe you. I *know* there were plenty of SF films before Star Wars.
But a large number of them were B-movies, and by 1970 they were a dying
breed. Sure, there was the odd "mainstream" SF film such as 2001 or
Silent Running, but the real explosion in SF filmmaking for the mainstream
theatrical releases came after Star Wars.

Restricting the IMDB\'s search engine to include only movies made in the 
USA and excluding anything made for television, in 1976, the year before 
Star Wars was released, there were 5 movies classed as SF. In 1978, the 
year after Star Wars, the number climbs to 13. In 1987, ten years after
Star Wars, there were 32. (In 1998, 39.) Going by decades, 1966-1976
had 105 (yes, I know that\'s an 11-year span). 1978-1988, 232.

Just for fun, I used IMDB\'s search engine to get a list of SF movies
from 1960 to 1970. Movies with messages or some sort of social commentary
include The Astro-Zombies (1969), Attack of the Giant Leeches (1960),
The Brain That Wouldn\'t Die (1962), The Beast of Yucca Flats (1961), and
Mars Needs Women (1966). 

Seriously, there were a lot of good SF films in that era. But for every 
Charly (1968, based on the classic SF story "Flowers for Algernon") or 
Fantastic Voyage (1966), there were dozens of films like Frankenstein 
Meets The Space Monster (1965) or Zontar The Thing From Venus (1966). 

Star Wars made SF on film acceptable and accessible to the mainstream
moviegoing audience, breaking it out of the genre.

>The good guys were really good[1] and the bad guys were really evil, unlike

I don\'t know. Though I haven\'t seen it, I\'m sure that the title character
of Zontar The Thing From Venus wasn\'t the good guy...

If "90% of everything is crap", as someone once put it, then the other 10%
is worth watching. More SF films = more "crap", but also more good stuff
as well.

BTW, I myself have a personal movie-review website, with capsule reviews
of nearly 1,000 films, with a disproportionately large percentage of them
being SF films...

I was thinking about this too, but how about having the RESET be
different than the power. Then when my home experiences a power 
outage I don\'t reboot when I turn the computer on (and lose whatever
I was working on), I just resume where I left off.

Of course if this were not possible (at any tech level), a software
solution could be implemented similar to the clean/dirty flag on your
hard drive.

When Kirsten was still a manager at the Centurt Park Googleplex in Redwood
City, they held a similar viewing for Jurrasic Park.  The CP sits at the
edge of a slat water marsh, and the building attracts rodents.  Big ones.

Remember the scene where the lady paleobotanist finds the engineer\'s arm?
At that moment a huge rat decided to run down the wall and on to the arms
of one of the other managers.

I have never heard so loud a shriek in my life.

Huh?  Here are a few films made between 2001:ASO and Star Wars

Planet of the Apes (and sequels) (1968-74)
Andromeda Strain (1971)
The Omega Man (1971)
Silent Running (1971)
Soylent Green (1973)
Dark Star (1973)
Westworld (1973)
Rollerball (1975)
Logan\'s Run (1976)
Wizards (1977)

I know I\'m missing a few, but the early/mid seventies were a great time for
SF on film.

Oh this is certainly true.  It\'s just that after a month of having some
book on "Special order" I get tired of waiting.  Of course the day after I
order it he gets a copy in....  

My post was mostly for people that seem to have chronic trouble obtaining
SJG products because they are in an area without good game stores (like
mine....).  It seems silly to drive several hours to a game store for
something you can mail order.  But if you are willing to do that to support
the industry, kudos to you.

 During combat or contruction?

 Combat uses a weighted chart with about half of the surface locations 
listed. Which chart you roll on is determined by facing.

 Construction allocation is done by assigning enough spots to all surface 
features. The number of spots on the chart that, say, a large cargo hatch 
takes up is calculated by dividing the total surface area by 20 and then by 
20 again. This gives two numbers which represent the surface area of the 
primary chart locations and of any needed subdivisions.

 This may sound complex, but if you do ship design with any of the Traveller 
systems other than Book 2, then this part of TNE ship design is trivial...

  OK - there isn\'t such a niche using disposable tanks; although they might
be close to metal-hulled drop tank using J1-2 ships it\'s hardly relevant as
those are much more expensive to operate than internal tankage ships unless
drop tanks are made effectively re-usable (an exceedingly bad idea, IMHO).

As much as I liked BL, I got to think it was too detailed in ways it
shouldn\'t be. Facing was important in damage resolution and fire,
for example, but i dont think it should have been given 30minute
turns--I ended up liking the notion of "Batteries Bearing" better.

Also, from a scaling standpoint it was odd that a scout ship had 400
surface hit locations, but so would a destroyer 10 times the size.
But still fun.

There are 1d20 big areas, so you roll to hit surface area 2 say,
then roll a d20 to see what part of that area you hit. The latter
roll looks like my example above (with different systems in the
different areas. if there is noting on the surface you see if it can
penetrate and then do damage inside.

Some numbers to consider :-
Your desktop computer has perhaps 10 million linear
switching elements (transistors).
The human brain has 10^11 neurones, each with an average of
1000 synapses. Some neurones in the visual cortex synapse
to 10000-50000 other neurons!

Charles P. : Neurons are trinary or ternary devices (no
impulse, excitatory "+1" and inhibitory "-1" potentials). The 
biology is fascinating, but not in the immediate sphere
of discourse of the TML.


If we rate the desktop machine as "1", and increase
computer complexity (by switching element count) by
10X per Tech Level, we get computers equivalent in
complexity to human brains by TL 14.
This rough calculation ignores the several orders of magnitude increase
in the number of possible paths an impulse could
take through our synaptic network vs. the Wintel system.

<random musing>
I\'d go for a 10X increase in computing power per Tech
Level. This tracks back pretty well to the first
machines (TL 5 machines ~1/1000 the capacity of TL 8)..
and does the least damage to canon.

Looking for a system to simplify rating computers and robot brains, I remain

I have an Intel "experimentors kit" for Bubble Memory. It has a 256k
(byte) module. It\'s a bout the size of a pack of cigarettes and is
*heavy* (several *ounces*). It\'s also slower than even an *old* hard
drive.

Mag Bubble is just fast *sequential* storage medium.

However, as I posted a wek or so back, they now exploring other types
of magnetic memory that *are* workable on microchips.

Single molecules aren\'t as "special" as many SF stories have led us to

It\'s the one I still remember. I\'m sure the plot was full of the usual

1985: TRS-80 Model 100 (first practical laptop)

The 100 could be turned off in the middle of a program and would resume
when you powered it back up. It also had an autoshutdown feature based
on time & system inactivity. As well as the ability for a program to
turn off the system.

The Model 200 a year or two later had the ability to not only shutdown
under program control, but also to set a time to restart! 

Of course, these aren\'t "true" power downs. The RAM and CPU state were
preserve by *very* low power "standby" modes. This used about twice the
power of being *truly* off (which still had power applied to the RAM,
as it used a RAM based file system). 

But the system would run for 8-20 hours on 4 AA batteries. It\'d
maintain everything on "standby" for several *months*, and maintain
files in the "off" state for at least a year.

About 60-90 volts of fun.

The trouble is, it\'s *far* too easy to "induce" allergies to drugs. So
anybody with *good* secrets will go into shock and die if you try truth
drugs on them.

Then you get into the realm of "idiosyncratic drug reactions". A good
example being Miles Vorkosigan\'s reaction to fast-penta. :-)

For those not familar with the books, when Miles gets dosed with
fast=penta instead of being forced to answer truthfully, he babbles.
Extensively. But not about what you asked him.

And they are also being developed to leach dangerous metals from

So if a ship lands near the wrong *old* mining site, leftover "cleanup"

If you are going to have an NPC do the questioning "off camera", have
him ask to be left along with the prisoner (who shouls be tied to a
chair or table). As the door is closing, tell the PCs that he\'s taking
what looks to be an ordinary teaspoon (ie small spoon for use at the
table *not* a measuring spoon) from a pocket. And mention that the
prisoner looks scared out of his wits when he sees the spoon.

After the door closes, have the sound of the NPC talking quietly (ie
you can\'t understand anything he says). And lots of *loud* pleading
from the prisoner. Then more quiet talk. Finally, have *loud* screams
from the prisoner, followed by sobbing. 

The prisoner *should* talk about this point, unless he\'s a real hard
case. If not, go for more screams. At this point it\'s unlikely he\'ll
talk. But any *other* prisoners in the room are likely to spill their
guts. 

Anybody care to guess what the NPC did? No fair replying if you\'ve read
the Horseclans book where Milo describes this trick.

Of course.

Any _particular_ Turing machine is highly unlikely to be a universal Turing
machine, which is a theoretical construct  with the word "infinite" in it in
at least one place.

For those people who like thinking about these things, here\'s a question I
got on a post graduate exam paper, as near as I can remember it. I remember
it because I was one of the few to get it exactly right, which surprised me
a bit.

Consider four machines.

1 has both finite tape size and finite number of states
2. has an infinte number of states, but a finite tape.
3. has a finite number of states but at an infinte tape size
4. has both infinite tape and infinite states.

List the machines in order of ability and state why

Well when you concider the vast size of Traveller computers compared to their
computing power, that size problem makes sense.  If, for some reason, you
*MUST* have absolutely non-volatile memory and battery back up isn\'t good
enough, then you use the bulky, slow and expensive non-volatile stuff.  But if
you can afford to have some down time, like say in a flight computer, the
cheaper, less bulky stuff can be used.

It\'s unclear how many "strains" were in the original transmission.
Remember, as much data as possible was beamed over the the
flagship - it could well have included primitive suicider strains, more
advanced vampire strains, even strains that had evolved beyond the
knowledge of the original researchers. Everything from images of 
original Cymbeline predator chips to the later, weapons-grade variants
could have been in those data files.

The suicider strains would have had some of the earliest and most
evident manifestations - they are the simplest strains, and thus 
probably reassemble and run themselves sooner than other strains
will. 

Considering the mutation rate of the strains, it\'s even possible that all
forms of Virus came from one suicider strain - it errored out to copy
itself repeatedly instead of copy once then suicide, some of the copies
evolved as they were rebuilding themselves in other computers.

Except that the scout would probably have some survace target on every

could take a hit without losing some vital antenna.

That\'s one of the things I liked about BL, you can scrub off surface
features and win a fight without ever penetrating the enemy armor belt.

I kind of like asteroid ships - must be those Saturday mornings wasted

IMTU, I don\'t allow a class discount on asteroid hulls. Each rock has
different centers of gravity, fracture lines, overall shape, etc., so it
didn\'t seem appropriate that mass-production techniques would apply

Next wednesday, my gaming group will begin their actual sojourn to 
Barnard\'s Star, arriving in-system and encountering the Vilani for 
the very first time.  :)

As a referee who likes to be prepared, I wanted to ask the TML what 
their thoughts of the sound of a Vilani accent might be.  I try to do 
different voices and mannerisms for major NPCs; I think it adds to 
the distinction of the characters for the PCs.  (_The Phantom Menace_ 
has some good examples of this.  The Trade Federation aliens sound 
like American caricatures of Hispanic accents, and Jar Jar Binks 
reminds me of a combination of a bad Jamaican accent and a child 
learning to read by pronouncing all vowels as long vowels, using 
wrong tenses, etc.)

I understand that Old High Vilani has some similarities in sound and 
sentence structure to ancient Sumerian.  Since I can\'t find a 
language tape on Ancient Sumerian, does anyone have any suggestions 
of an accent and/or speech pattern I could emulate for the Vilani?

Thanks in advance for your assistance.

1.) I never said that Star Wars was the death of sci-fi films. I merely said
it\'s a mixed blessing... for *all* films, not just science-fiction. Story
and character development are rare animals these days, and often the bigger
the SFX budget, the less we see of those beasts.

2.) The difference between science-fiction and science-fantasy is an
academic one, at best. It\'s all fiction, and it\'s all fantasy.

ObTrav: What is the face of science-fiction like in the Imperium? Where do
Imperials see themselves in 10, 20, 50, 100 or 200 years? What social trends
are there that show up in their science-fiction? Where do they see their
technology a few years down the line? Do they have quasi-modern "conspiracy
thrillers" and the like?

ALthough "custom hit charts for each ship" is a cute idea, it was a painful
step in the design process - you can write a spreadsheet to automate
everything else in the design, but not the hit chart (at least not unless
you\'re as good as Andrew Akins, and even he hasn\'t done it yet.)

Nice things about BL: an interesting variant on vector movement (somewhat
simpler than Mayday, but made complex again by tracking ship facing as
well as movement direction.) Tracking ship facing makes for more tactical
flavour in combats with short-ranged weapons. Semi-reasonable sensor rules.

Bad things: maybe a hair too complex in resolving damage (you had to look
at a bizzare table to convert the damage rating of your weapon into a
number of "minor" or "major" hits - rating the weapons directly on this
scale would have speeded things up.) Badly laid-out ship record sheets.
Classic GDW problem with using Really Big Counters and REally Big Hexes
so that the map is physically huge but game-scale undersized (as a
result the sensor rules don\'t matter for military ships, which can detect
each other past the edge of the map.)

Still, overall, a very nice game. Recommended for campaings with lots of
space combat. With a little tweaking you can split ship management up
(seperate pilot and gunnery officer and sensor officer and maybe captain)
to give a party of PCs something to do.

Umm, actually any naturally occurring mineral can be a single crystal.
There have been single crystals of quartz (SiO2) found up to one metre in
length.  Many synthetic materials can also be grown into a single crystal.
Some turbine blades, IIRC, have been grown out of a single crystal to add
malleability and strength to the material, as well as lowering the
brittleness.

Due to nylon being one long polymer chain.

Part of the problem would also be actually growing the things.  Most of the
larger crystals made in an artificial environment (lab, factory, etc) have
to be cooled at exactly the right rate for them to grow.  While I can
forsee advances in cooling technology and mass production/industrialisation
that would possibly allow this, the laws that govern the production of
metals/polymers are fairly well set in stone.

Cutting holes in the structure would also make it inherently weaker.  Given
the outward pressure on any hull in space, cutting square holes without any
form of reinforcement is just asking for disaster.  Witness the Comet
disasters in the 60\'s (???) when square window holes resulted in fractures
and ultimately the loss of several aircraft.

Yes, but to increase the overall visibility / prerformance of the GT-Line
we need to ensure that the SHOPS carry the books
If we all go and direct order, the shops will sell less, order less, and
so, less people

    'body' => 'The Plasma Sword (AKA The Artist\'s Brand)
*** System: MegaTraveller ***

The Artist\'s Brand is a TL16 personal melee weapon based off of the
personal military applications of pre-Maghiz Darrian Plasma Art.
Used by a reclusive Darrian order of psionic martial artists, the 
Artist\'s Brand initially appears as a silver cylinder approximately 
0.3 to 0.4 meters in length (12"-16"), with a black padded grip along 
the lower half of the cylinder.  An impellor disk caps the upper end 
of the cylinder, and a number of configurable controls exist on one 
side of the cylinder, between the grip and the impellor disk. 
Artist\'s Brands usually possess a D-ring or similar connection at the 
lower base of the cylinder, to enable the weapon to be carried from a 
belt or baldric.

When activated, the impellor disk projects a brand of plasma
approximately a meter (3\' 4") in length, which is held in check by
gravitic fields generated from the impellor plate as well.  Close
proximity to the brand\'s "edge" produces a feeling of heat. 
Actually breaking the brand\'s surface exposes the obstruction to the
intense heat and destructive force of the plasma contained within
the gravitic fields.

While the Artist\'s Brand makes a highly effective personal weapon,
the configurable controls allows for the user to adjust the overall
length of the Brand, making it an effective tool at times.  Due to
its high penetration, the Brand can, over time, be used to cut
through the interior bulkheads of a starship, although the superior
armor of a starship\'s external hull would take longer to penetrate. 

The average Brand can remain active for up to an hour, and requires 
four hours of recharging from an external power source (using a 
recharger pack) to become fully charged again.

Artist\'s Brands are very hard to find, as the secrets of their 
construction belong to members of the Darrian Order of Artists, and 
is passed down only to trained members of the Order.  As Artists 
consider it a grave dishonor to the Order and to themselves to allow 
a non-believer to possess a Brand, they will often take great risks 
to retrieve or destroy a Brand in the hands of a non-believer, and 
extend great honor to one who returns the Brand of a fallen comrade. 
 While rare, Brands can occassionally be found on the black market, 
starting at ten times the value listed below, and are sought after by 
exotic weapon collectors for their rarity and efficiency.

The use of the Brand in combat requires the Sabre skill, which should 
be considered part of the Blade Combat cascade skill group.  Only 
Artists with a Sabre skill of 3 or greater are taught how to 
construct a Brand.  Until then, an Artist must depend on his/her 
Master for a Brand.

To construct a Brand from raw components:
Difficult, Gravitics, Mechanics, 1 day (fateful, hazardous)
Referee:  The character should have a Sabre skill of 3+, or increase 
the difficulty one level.  The use of components of TL15 or less 
increases the difficulty by one per TL drop.  This task is effected 
normally by adverse work conditions, inappropriate parts, etc.  If 
unsuccessful, the amount of damage determined from failure will be 
the amount of damage inflicted when first activated, as the Brand 
discharges and melts the interior of the weapon into useless slag.

To construct a Brand Recharger from raw components:
Routine, Gravitics, Mechanics, 1 hour (fateful, hazardous)
Referee:  The character should have a Sabre skill of 3+, or increase
the difficulty one level.  The use of components of TL15 or less
increases the difficulty by one per TL drop.  This task is effected
normally by adverse work conditions, inappropriate parts, etc.  If
unsuccessful, the amount of damage determined from failure will be the
amount of damage inflicted when the Recharger is first activated, as 
it causes the Brand to discharge and melts the interior of the weapon 
into useless slag.

Combat Statistics:
Plasma Sword:  Penetration 15, Damage 4, Block 2

(TML Statistics:  Penetration 20, Damage 3, Block 2.  I prefer the 
lower pen and higher damage, since interior bulkheads are AV30, while 
external hulls are AV40, and I wanted it harder to cut through the 
outside of a ship than an interior bulkhead.)

Equipment Statistics:

Plasma Sword:  TL 16, Mass 2.5 kg, Volume ~1.2 L, Cr 30,000
Plasma Sword Recharger:  TL 16, Mass 2.0 kg, Volume 1.0 L, Cr 1,000

[Disclaimer:  Anyone is allowed to use the information herein for 
campaigns, etc.  The only two things I ask are: 1) you have fun with 
it, and 2) if you use the concept of the Darrian Artists in a

Actually when all pressure is removed the gasses in your body start
expanding, including those in your veins.  At JUST 5,000 feet they double in
pressure inside your body.  Every 5-10,000 feet they double again. I would
think that if you stepped out in vacuum you would probably explode.  It very
well could mean that your eyeballs pop out because they are expanding
rapidly with all the blood in and around them. Who knows positively what
happens to the human body in vacuum.  I certainly don\'t want to be the one
used to find out.  I went through the Air Force High Altitude Pressure
Chamber in Wiesbaden Germany and the smell as they lowered the pressure was
pretty bad as everyone was farting and belching to beat the band.  I seem
to recall they said that above 50,000 feet your blood would literally boil
from all the gas pressure building up in your ENTIRE body.

Well, this is beyond my knowledge of the field (I\'ve only studied state
machines with finite number of states), but my guess is that 1 is the
weakest, followed by 3, which of course is the "normal" Turing machine.
I\'d guess that 2 and 4 are identical, since with infinite state I don\'t
think the tape matters much.  Am I right?  What\'s the real answer?

I would also urge you all to refrain from personal attacks, use of various

*** System: MegaTraveller ***

The Order of the Enlightened Art existed on Darrian before the
Maghiz, as advisors to nobles and protectors of the Darrian
populace. With the Maghiz and the insuing collapse in technology and
society, the Artists found themselves becoming extinct.  Where once
a proud and honorable Order stood, the surviving Artists of the
Maghiz retreated into a more monastic existence.  The numbers of the
Order became less and less over the generations, until only a mere
handful remain today.  A few Orders have kept the Artists\'
traditions alive in Darrian space over the centuries, but have 
remained secluded until recently.  In 1109, a prominent noble of the 
Darrian subsector was assassinated with the traditional weapon of the 
Artists, the plasma sword known as the Artist\'s Brand.  Determined to 
resolve the dishonor on Artists everywhere, Grandmaster Kon\'l of 
Darrian began investigating the attack. His hard work uncovered a 
rogue Order, called the Black Hand of the Maghiz, or simply the Hand. 
 The Hand now uses the teachings of the old Artist Order to perform 
assassinations and obtain political power.  The Order of the 
Enlightened Art and the Black Hand of the Maghiz are now mortal 
enemies, and are often found behind the scenes, working to hinder one 
another and destroy their rival\'s Order.

The following basic character generation system can be used to 
develop members of the Artists or the Hand.  It is handled exactly 
like the prior careers from the MegaTraveller Player\'s Manual, except 
that beginning characters determine their psionics score at the 
beginning of character creation.  If the character successfully 
enlists into this career, then determine the psionic talents the 
character can possibly learn using the normal process described 
in the book (they may have none), and give the character skill level 
one in each talent.

Skills are earned as normal:  2 for the first term, 1 per term 
thereafter.  One skill for commission, one skill per promotion, and 
one skill per special duty.  Making a commission, promotion, or 
special duty roll by four or more grants an additional skill level, 
as well.

New Cascade Skill Group:

to increase one of their psionic talents by one skill level, or they 
may select to gain a skill level one in a psionic talent they do not 
yet know (with the exception of the Special talent.  If a character 
doesn\'t have the predisposition for Special psionic talents upon 
character creation, it\'s really difficult to obtain training to bring 
it out after initial training.)

[Disclaimer:  Anyone is allowed to use the information herein for
campaigns, etc.  The only two things I ask are: 1) you have fun with
it, and 2) if you use the concept of the Darrian Artists in a
publication or on a website, I just want an honorable mention.

For those of you who like the concept of the Darrian Artists, and are
considering their use in the Spinward Marches, I have another thought
regarding integrating them into YTU.  Not too long ago, I learned of
the Irklansa (JTAS #23) here on the TML, a sect of psionic ninja
types.  It might be worthwhile to consider using the Irklansa in
addition to, or in place of, the Black Hand of the Maghiz, as an
enemy of the Order of the Enlightened Art.  While they do not use the
Artists\' Plasma Swords, the Irklansa also have their secrets and
their code of honor to observe.  The cultural conflicts might be very
interesting and, as the Irklansa are located within the Imperium
proper, you are not as tied to a Darrian-centric campaign as the
original scenario I described might lead to.  Also, the use of the
Irklansa ties into the canonical OTU a bit better, which may or may
not be a good thing, depending on your viewpoint. :) 

Just another thought on a possible plot idea.

Enjoy,
Jason

They had a project in one of the Color Computer mags back then about using a 
256K bubble module or 2 for external storage.  It\'s been a few zillion years 
since I got rid of them all (and right now, I wish I *haddn\'t*; there was an 
article on simulation programming I could rilly use right about now...), so I 
couldn\'t tell you what all was involved besides the modules, a wire wrap card, 
& a few ICs for glue.

I\'ll take a stab at you meaning Harvard University in Cambridge, MA.

Right in Harvard Square, in the Garage Mall, Pandemonium Books & Games.

Look up Lone Star Comics in the phone book.
Several locations - one should be close.
But I\'d call about Gurps stuff.
The other two places I know are in North Dallas
in Prestonwood Mall and Valley View Mall.
Don\'t recall the names.

Lone Star Comics definitely is a decent
chain in Dallas and they\'re starting to
ramp up their GURPS inventory (finally!).

However, Valley View Mall\'s game store,
called the Game Chest, carries every
GURPS supplement in print. G:T is turning
into a big seller for them (YES!)

Prestonwood Mall shut down completely last
year and will be bulldozed. The store that was
there, Games Unique, has moved to a location
on Arapaho just west of Hillcrest. They
have copies of a number of TNE supplements
in stock, including the Regency Sourcebook
and the one covering Regency combat vehicles.

This is a good example of how limited nanotech can be used in
the Imperium.


First Artificial Muscle Arrays From Carbon Nanotubes 

New developed sheets of single-walled nanotubes were shown by
scientists from the Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research
in Stuttgart/Germany, from the USA, Australia and Italy, to generate
higher stresses than natural muscle and higher strains than
high-modulus ferroelectrics (Science 21 May 1999). 

<snip>

Carbon nanotubes are very thin and long tubes. Their diameter is only
one or a few nanometers, which means that they are not thicker than
typical molecules, and their length can be several micrometers and
even millimeters. In electronics, these nanotubes are discussed as
quantum wires and quantum dots. They can be used as components of
nanostructured field effect transistors and single electron
transistors. Their mechanical strength enables applications in
nanocomposite materials and, because of the large surface area per
weight, nanotubes are good candidates for all sorts of gas absorption,
including hydrogen storage for sustainable energy supplies. 

From X-ray investigations of graphite we know that the honeycomb
lattice expands if the graphitic sheets are electrically charged.
Quantumchemical calculations predict that this is also true for carbon
nanotubes: The tubes will increase their length if we change the number
of electrons sitting on a tube. This effect can be used for
electromechanical actuators. Actuators are the moving parts in robotics
("artificial muscles").

<snip>

The actuator effect of carbon nanotubes has been demonstrated by a
multinational cooperation, funded by DARPA and lead by Ray Baughman,
involving teams at AlliedSignal Inc. in Morristown, USA, at the
University of Wollongong in Australia, the University of Pisa in Italy,
the University of Florida in Gainesville, Fl, USA, the Georgetown
University in Washington DC, and the Max Planck Institute for Solid State
Research in Stuttgart, Germany. For this purpose, a strip of bucky paper
has been dipped in salt water and electrochemically charged by changing
the potential to +/- 1V versus a standard electrode.

[Note: Bucky paper is a free standing film of bundles of nanotubes.]

The length expansion has been made visible by sticking the bucky paper
on a piece of inert material (e. g. scotch tape). If the bucky paper
expands, the bi-strip bends and the motion can easily be seen by the naked
eye. 

Therefore, the new actuators open a vast field of potential applications,
both by using bucky paper as a macroscopic material, and by using ropes
or even individual carbon nanotubes for micro and nano actuator devices.

Huh??  I dont think so.  Hmmmm, lez see

1920s (?)
Metropolis ( a _wonderful_ silent film, ala blade runner, if you ever can
find it, watch it )
Frau im Mond ( another silent film )

1930s and 40s (?)
The Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers serials ( if you can include SW, then
these count as well )

1950s
War of the Worlds
Forbidden Planet
The Thing ( the original film version )

1960s
Silent Running ( well, maybe, too close to the 60\'s pop culture in space
perhaps )

Any others anyone knows of?

Well, how about Alien? Wasn\'t that made in 1977 or so? I remember that vaguely,
because Jaws and Alien were playing at the same theater. My best friend and I
paid for Alien, and then when that was done we snuck next door and saw Jaws.

I know Alien is more of a horror show than sci-fi, but it made a lasting
impression on me, and had one of the best catch-phrases:

In outer space nobody can hear you scream.

All I did was concentrate on *one* sector in *one* time frame and build from there.  The result?  Hyphen gave me 4 stars, & I\'m not *DONE* yet.  <grin>

So?  Most of my site was assembled from the works of others.  I melded a few other ideas I shamelessly took (and fully credited) in, and came up with some flashy starmaps using a freeware program that I put a link to.

It\'s not hard.  Just don\'t give up before you start.  And you\'ll know you had a good contribution to the effort when somebody *else* starts looting your files for *their* site.  (Hi, Derek!  <grin>)

T4, p.37
Cluster = pick 1
Cascade = pick 1, all other skills in cascade at -1 from picked skill.

The only Cascades are:
Aircraft
Blade Combat
Gun Combat

Spacecraft (Pilot and Ship\'s Boat) is a hybrid:  Its cascade if you pick
Pilot, its cluster if you take Ship\'s Boat, i.e,
Ship\'s Boat Skill Level = Pilot Skill Level -1.

All of which are pretty much in debt to "Destination: Moon" which was
very loosely based on Heinlein\'s "Rocket Ship Galileo" and had Heinlein
as technical advisor.

And keep in mind the *biggy* "The Conquest of Space". This was a
psuedo-documentary on how we\'d build a space station, go to the moon,
and then on to Mars.

"Robinson Crusoe on Mars". A lot of hokey stuff (especially the "air
rocks" and "air pills") but still interesting. You could even
transplant it to Traveller without too much trouble.

"Marooned", based loosely on the *original* version of "Marooned" by
Martin Caidin. After the film a new edition was released that matched
the film. Your basic "astronauts in orbit, and the reentry pack won\'t
fire" story.

Somewhere, I have (or used to have, it may be on the HD that died a few
years back) a Pascal "code obfuscator". What it does is goes thru and
changes all variable, constant, function and procedure names to
arbitrary character strings (AAAAA AAAAB AAAAAC etc). Then it removes
all indentation from the code. And finally, it combines short lines
into long ones (after all the ";" is the statement seperator), while
removing any blank lines. Oh yeah, it removes all comments too. 

It started out as a way to turn "sensitive" code into something that
could be sent into Borland to demonstrate a compiler bug without giving
away anything important. 

It got "expanded" so that the more paranoid programmers could supply
source code to units without too much risk of their ideas being stolen.

As a general rule, plugging something into something 2 TLs older will
*fry* the newer device. Examples:

Hook a 20ma current loop device to RS-232.
Hook RS-232 to TTL
Hook 5v TTL to 3v TTL

Obviously, this breaks down when you go from electronics to photonics. 

BTW, the IBM 2311 disk drive used *hydraulics* to drove the head
positioning mechanism!

Nope. Totally false. The pressure inside your body matches the pressure
*outside*. At sea level, that\'s 15 psi. 

If you get dumped from a 15 psi habitat into a vacuum, the pressure
inside will *still* be 15 psi, dropping rapidly.

We\'ve got *tons* of experimental data on chimps, as well as some human
data from a few accidents.

That *is* one thing that will happen. You\'ll damn near *spray* out the
contents of your colon.

Long before that happens, you\'ll pass out from lack of oxygen. And it
actually takes a fair amount of time for bubbles to form in your blood,
because the circulatory system is pretty well isolated from the
outside. 

But skin is a *lot* tougher than we given it credit for. It\'ll hold
together, even though you *will* swell up pretty bad. 

Col. Kittinger holds the record for a parachute jump. He exited a
pressurized capsule carried by a balloon somewhere around 100,000 feet.
That\'s more than high enough to be a vacuum as far as physiological
effects are concerned. He was wearing a standard Air Force high
altitude suit. But he forgot to put on the gloves before jumping (or
they got torn away as he jumped, I forget which)

It takes 55 seconds to drop from 100,000 feet to 50,000 feet. So his
hands got *lots* of exposure to vacuum. The effects were swelling due
to fluid entrapment, lots of burst capillaries in the surface layers,
and a bit of damage similar to bruising. 

And the other studies tend to bear this out. You won\'t get a lot of
damage even with prolonged exposure. At least not *externally*.
Internally, some time *after* you lose conciousness, your lungs will
fill with fluid and said fluid will start to boil. Your eyes will dry
out, and maybe even start to freezing. And there\'s a chance of things
like ruptured lungs if you tried to hold your breath, or ruptured
intestines if you tried not to let everything go out the other end. 

BTW, that *is* the one really "unglamorous" side to being a member of
the "Vacuum breathers" club. The mess in your pants. At least it\'ll be
vacuum dried as it comes out. 

Oh yeah, I *can* see something like a fresh scar from abdominal surgery
popping open under the stress. *that* would be ugly.

I still like the idea in the old SF novel "Gallagher\'s Glacier". It
involves an "asteroid" hulled ship. Made of *ice*. 

It\'s a great idea. The ice makes tunneling easy, and you can use it for
fuel. 

He spun the ship for gravity, and as time went on, all the rooms and
corridors tended to work their way towards the outer hull. And a void
appeared in the center. So every once in a while he\'d melt surface ice
and pump it back to the center. And he\'d then re "drill" the corridors.
The rooms could be moved by judicious melting and levering. 

Oh yeah, he smuggled. The customs inspectors never quite figured out
the idea that he could make a compartment in the ice that wasn\'t
attached to *anything* and then later, spend a few hours digging to it
to unload. :-)

Solar cells, wind or water generator. (all of which I intend to have

>>Could you aquire food?  How about perserve it?

Yes, to some extent. Huntiung I can do. And with care, my ammo supply
will last a *long* time (I\'ve got 1000 rounds).

Preserving? I know how to smoke meat. And if I can find salt, I can
always salt it (I\'m not counting on being able to get to the coast)

Drying works for a lot of veggies. And we do have a fair number of nut
trees in the vicinity.

But veggies *will* be one of the things I\'d have to look hard for.

More stuff than I currently have. If I can combine with a few friends,
we\'ll be in pretty good shape. 

>>How long could you survive on a weeks rations?

A *long* time, though I wouldn\'t like it. I\'m rather overweight, so as
long as I have some vitamins and water, I could keep going. I wouldn\'t
*like* it, but it\'d be possible.

>>How would you build shelter?

I\'ve got the "tarp" type "rescue blankets". Add some brush, and that
would do for a start. Next we progress to a lean to. Or find a good
rock overhang. For that matter, I know where there\'s a dugout shelter
in the woods that could be refurbished without too much trouble. Or I
could build one (basicly, dig a hole, line with pine branches or the
like, place poles or small logs over the top, annd branches, cover with
dirt, leave hole at side for entrance). Sod huts work in areas with few
trees.


>>Keep warm?  Could you start a fire with the contents of your

I have a kit that contains a *large* magnifying glass (which I have
used to start fires), to different sets of "flint" and steel, both
magnesium powder and chunk magnesium to shave for "tinder", a "solar
cigarette lighter" which is basicly a curved mirror with a bracket to
hold something at the focus. It\'ll work for tinder just as well as it
would for cigarettes. 

It\'s also *possible* (though not recommended) to start a fire with a
cartridge. 

I still need to lay in a supply of tinder for the tinderbox, as well as
make a "fire carrier". Being in the SCA is sometimes useful. :-)

Oh yeah,. I also have a waterproff container of matches, but that\'s
cheating.

There will *always* be both "survivalist" types, and folks into various
sorts of "historical recreation". And things like boy scouts. All of
these people will have large chunks of the knowledge and equipment
required to keep going after things go to hell. 

Even so, most won\'t make it. They\'ll either succumb to bandits, or run
into a situation they *weren\'t* able to handle. But some will make it.
*Which* ones make it could have quite an effect on the future of the
world. 

Consider worlds were the "survivalist" and "militia" types managed to
make it thru.

Now consider one where the "boy scouts" wound up as the dominant
"culture". 

And how about ones where the historical recreationists did? (SCA
crossed with buckskinners?). 

Or where the Amish were the surivors (actually, I\'m not sure that they
are *quite* that self sufficient). 

Now consider the results of all these societies after they make it
*back* from the "Long Night". I can see cultures that decide *not* to
go with anything that isn\'t maintainable with *local* resources. By
that, I mean "within a days walk/ride". 

And others that do allow higher tech stuff but only as long as they\'ve
got measures in place to do without it if it breaks. Imagine a planet
where for a week each season, they drop the high tech stuff and make
sure that the standby methods work. Or where they\'ve *got* modern
conveniences, but mostly live in small towns and villages set up so
they can do without at need. 

BTW, that last one, combined with a bit of camoflage for the high tech
stuff, would make a *great* defence against raiders. Look like you
don\'t have anything beyond "chicken stealing" for the "Space Viking"
types to go after, and most will leave you alone. 

Hmmm. This *could* explain some of the low tech worlds. They don\'t
*want* a higher TL. That\'s a pretty alien viewpoint for us, but look at
the Amish.

Everything. They basicly had vacuum turn you into a pile of shredded
meat. Doesn\'t work that way. Your skin is a so-so grade of *leather*.
Upon exposure to a vacuum, you\'ll get fluid trapped in the tissues just
under the skin, leading to *lots* of swelling. You\'ll also get burst
capillaries near the surface. Fresh cuts may bleed into vacuum (an
astronaut accidentally punctured his glove and his hand on an EVA on
the Shuttle. They only discovered it after the mission when they found
blood in the glove liner)

Eyeballs will have *lots* of burst capillaries, and may bulge out some.
You\'ll have some *real* problems with abdominal bloating, and you\'ll be
spraying gas, liquids and solids out your ass.

But only the flimsier surface features on your body are going to have
any chance of rupturing badly. And even *they* won\'t look like the
messes they showed in Outland.

Well, you\'re more depraved than I am. I and my friends had encountered
folks being *threatened* with a spoon in a couple of books and not been
able to figure what the threatr was. Not until we read the rather
graphic description of actually *doing* it.

There are *two* problems with that idea. First, it takes *effort* to
cut hard materials. 

Second, you\'d better have the cable *anchored* to something harder than
what you are cutting. 

Piano wire and monofilament fishing line both demonstrate the problem
nicely. With the fishing line, it\'s quite possible to cut yourself.

I always thought that the 197th\'s motto was "dick in a vise", based on
their unit patch.  ;-)  BTW, were you with the 197th during the Gulf
War?  (I was attached to the brigade S-2 section as an interrogator.)

From my (admittedly limited) experience working with infantry units,
battalions of the 82d Airborne Division, each of whose brigades were
"regiment-pure" as regards infantry battalions, displayed more
regimental pride than other infantry battalions, which belonged to
brigades containing units of more than one regiment.

ObTrav:  IMHO, keeping soldiers assigned to the same regiment, all
battalions of which are in the same brigade, would be _much_ easier than
similar assignments in the US Army circa  AD 1999.  After all, according
to FFW, all regular Imperial Army units of corps size or smaller add up
to less than two field armies, while there are eight numbered Imperial
Field Armies.  Given units of such size, serving together, maintaining
regimental cohesion seems a simple matter.

It surely does.  After all, the thruster still has to push _itself_
along with the rest of the ship.

Using High Guard, the acceleration of a ship is a TL-based percentage of
the ship\'s volume.  External drives would still require volume, and thus
would affect acceleration.

In FF&S2 (and, I suspect, in FF&S1), acceleration is based on mass,
rather than volume.  In this case, the mass of the thruster would need
to be accelerated, and would again affect ship performance.

Bottom line is, TANSTAAFL (There Ain\'t No Such Thing As A Free Lunch).

Right, just like that...

I have to tell you that the reason this thread started:

ObTrav: Traveller really kept a hard science fiction background,
and though I was young and believed in Jump drives, stasis swords
(a Niven thing) and it made perfect sense that there would be
galactic empires, that was what attracted me to Traveller most.

I have been lately thinking that IMTU there will no longer 
be empires (well, there currently aren\'t, but that is only because
there are only 5 colonies), and Jump drives will start working 
somewhat like rec.arts.sf.science, or the physics faq says they
should.

My suspension of disbelief gets harder to invoke...

It\'s got the exact same USP as the Sylean class heavy fighter listed in The
Spinward Marches Campaign; probably the same design.

Nope, the "Bite The Bullet Brigade" is what we called it, and I was long

One advantage of mixed regiment brigades is survivability.  A brigade in a
n isolated post can be wiped out without taking an old and honored unit
with it.

Since acceleration is determined by mass, yes.  In the design sequence,
items held by grapples do count against the total displacement of the
craft.  The Camel Frieghter on my webpage (plug) is listed as a 1200 ton
ship, but it\'s really a 600 ton ship with the ability to attacj 600 tons of
cargo pods.

Hell, my website was originally just Traveller: The Silly Era.  Most of
that was culled of the list.  Today my site includes:

The Silly Era.  Still mostly the work of other list members

The Departure Lounge.  Slavaged for the wreck of the IG pages, and my own
wanderings on the web

Gridlore Technologies.  My own ship designs, and the weapons pages mostly
converted from 3G3.

T4 Errata.  Pulled directly off of IG.

Software.  None of it by me.  I just host it.

Marine ranks.  This is the one page where every single item comes directly
from my imagination and work.

  If it\'s just on the hull then no - and there shouldn\'t (IMHO) be a discount
on the hull-work. According to the rules there is a discount on the rest of
the ship (the drives/plant being all that really counts), which probably makes
a fair chunk of sense - they\'re merely adjusting the configurations of some
components to fit any variations that drilling the "hull" couldn\'t deal with;
later stages of most ship-building processes have had issues liek this.

Volume should only be important with Gs of thrust when you are using volume
as a proxy for mass. Mass is what gets pushed - volume is only relevant for
jump drive efficiency.

I\'d rule the answer should definitly be \'yes\', regardless of whether or not
the boost pack is being dropped before jump or not.

I missed that book.  But in the \'Trigon Discontinuity\', some ancient Solomani 
made starships out of an ice isomer.  Since their culture roamed Terra, a 
*lot* of their technology was ice-based because it was readily availiable.

All he had to do was drop some dirt or something in the water and it wouldn\'t be visible any more.

Beats me.  It\'s been over a decade since I saw a copy of it.  A *lotta* brain

I dunno.  I see Walt\'s point on this, & I\'m tempted to agree with him.  Rocks 
are just too randomly constructed.  No two are alike.  The class discount I\'d 
always regarded as having to do with that shipyard\'s familiarity with the 
nuances of the class design.  I.E., if they discover that you *have* to lay 
down the control fibers in the bulkhead *before* you mount the fusion bottle 
and button up the hull instead of trying to snake them through after the 
bottle\'s been mounted & discovering that it just won\'t go, then you know that 
in the next ship of that class, you lay the fibers down first.  They won\'t get 
any where *near* the precision that a metal hull will give them as far as 
parts placement goes.  I\'m not talking precision on the order of 0.0001 mm, 
I\'m talking precision on the order of mebbe .5 mm.  I just don\'t see an 
asteroid being able to get down to this level of tolerance.

  Some Military systems and older businesses still have computers with core ram in them. It takes decades for some systems to be upgraded.

  Oh one of the other advantages of core ram (if I remember correctly Please correct me if I am wrong) is that low to mid EMP blasts have no effect on this type where as CMOS and EPROM would be fried with even a low level EMP or Electro Static exposer.

 With sub micron stuff they could make it today (be really really expensive) and would be susceptible to Static and EMP.

??? Most missile racks are designed to be reloaded with full-sized
missiles. Why wold you want to use a smaller one? 

The details of this sort of thing depend heavily on what design rules
you\'re using, and there are several to choose from. I\'m really only doing
GT, where this isn\'t really worth bothering (a GT missile rack has 70+
reloads.)

There are some plot elements borrowed from _Hidden Fortreess_ but to say
that _Star Wars_ is based on _Hidden Fortress_ is stretching the point
pretty far.  The style is pure matinee adventure movie and very, very
different from _Hidden Fortress_.  

There are other sources too.  Some of the space combat scenes are taken
from various war movies, including one line that\'s a direct homage to _The
Dam Busters_.

Well, for diamond, I have seen them. At the Tucson Gem and Mineral Show a few
years back (one of the worlds largest) I saw a number of \'perfect\' octahedral
diamond crystals: you only get a crystal of the base crystalling form with a
single crystal. All the bonds in a diamond are covalent bonds, ergo, a single
perfect crystal of diamond is a single molecule. Manmade diamonds are also
single molecules.

I\'m not sure...EMP would induce currents in all of the lines, which in some
cores are quite long. I would suspect that ramdom currents passing through the
wires would scramble them quite well, as it didn\'t take much current to flip a
bit. Things with longer conductors are _more_ susceptible to EMP currents than
small ones, as the current induced by a given EMP is proportional to the
conductor length. The reason modern solid state electronics are susceptible is
that they are simply unable to handle uch current at all. Th reason tube-based
electronics are resistant to EMP is that they\'re self-limiting, after a
certain point, all more current does is make the thing glow a little brighter.
They also handle quite high currents anyway, which is why they are good for
high current switching applications.

> With sub micron stuff they could make it today (be really really expensive) and would be susceptible to Static and EMP.

You\'re probably right. Though the expense _would_ go down as production increased.

As far as I know, you don\'t have to be _invited_ to join the
webring, and you don\'t have to put up a superfantastic site - it
just has to be a site supporting the topic of the ring - that is,
any version of Traveller.

There are none that I\'m aware of; the only thing I can recall

That\'s what _I_ thought concerning myself lo these many years
ago.  It\'s a crock, although I didn\'t start to realize it until
the early RICE papers started to draw reactions from other
people...

Jory, a word of advice - take your ideas and POST THEM.  Ask what
people think.  Decide whether their comments are worth anything.
Revise as you feel necessary.  Post again.  Post questions about
things you\'re not clear on.  Post your ideas.  Post stories about
what happens at your gaming sessions.  We\'re not better than you;
we\'re just most of us here longer.  Now, prove it!

Down Massachusetts Ave. a couple of blocks (towards MIT & Boston)

Kurosawa\'s _The Hidden Fortress_, I think, provided most 
of the plot, and, oddly enough, the characters of C3PO and 
R2D2. But that of course was not the sole inspiration; the 
aforementioned adventure movies and Campbell\'s nonfiction 
myth-analysis book _The Hero With A Thousand Faces_ were 
critical to the development of Star Wars.

Now, of course, the most important inspirations to draw 
upon for Star Wars movies are marketing\'s plans for adorable
toys. *cough*

Thanks, I areally appreciate that.  When I first started this list a

I recall an old Arthur C. Clarke\'s short story (don\'t recall 
which, maybe in the "Solar Wind" antology) where a *lot* of 
people had to leave a spaceship to save their lifes and board 
another, in hard vacuum. For whatever the reason ,there was no way to 
connect both starships, and only a few vacc suits around.

As the story went, somebody convinced the people about the toughness 
of their skin, and convinced them to expel all possible air  of their 
lungs, close their eyes, and "jump" through vacuum from one ship to 
the other, for a short vacuum exposition...

Makes you remember who the masters of hard SF were.. and makes for an 
interesting Traveller situation.

 ??? Most missile racks are designed to be reloaded with full-sized
 missiles. Why wold you want to use a smaller one? 
 
 The details of this sort of thing depend heavily on what design rules
 you\'re using, and there are several to choose from. I\'m really only doing
 GT, where this isn\'t really worth bothering (a GT missile rack has 70+
 reloads.) >>

What I\'m going for is a fighter (10-20 ton) that has a few light missiles for

And a destroyer has a lot more scrubbable targets, too.  While with a
scout, every hit nails something vital. (At least, it does when _I\'m_

 Here\'s an easy one. Start with ONE page which is your own
personal launchpad to the Traveller websites you find most
useful/fun/whatever. Do this as a page instead of as a set
of browser bookmarks. If the page duplicates Traveller
Webring sites completely, so be it. If it contains even ONE
site beyond the Webrings related to Traveller (like NASAs
public stuff, for example, or that SOF site mentioned last
week) then you have a useful site for others to peruse.

 One of the easiest ways to give the site content (as opposed
to links) is to organized some portion of your own play
notes. The "Worlds of the Spinward Main" page on my
site is a good example. It started as my own collation of
published info-bits about the worlds my players were likely
to visit (or had visited), and acquired other notes as play
progressed. Names, places and events that make them
YOUR worlds. Sure, my versions of these worlds isn\'t
the one, true version since "G:T Behind the Claw," but
so what? It\'s the reality my players know, and it is
interesting and useful to us, and hopefully to others.

This number of reloads is precisely why I\'d be looking to redesign the
missile bay into something smaller and potentially single-use.

My Gurps guru is designing something on these lines, but imagine if you
have 10 reloads, 2 firing ports and 2 crewstations. You double your combat
RoF, and lets face it, who could use all 70 reloads anyway ?

Of course, missiles are insanely design-system dependant - do people want a
repost of the Famile Spofulam Anti-Shipping Missile/Customs Cutter (comes
with three warheads - det laser, conventional laser and auditor) ?

	It really *doesn\'t* matter that each hit location is much bigger on
the destroyer than it is on the scout. What matters is the chances of
hitting a specific item. And since that depends on the *proportion*
of the item\'s area to the overall area of that ship, this scaling is
*correct*.  Anything else would be broken ...  And note that,
proportionally, a single antenna winds up with a much smaller hit
probability on a destroyer than on the scout.

I\'ve always maintained that Stroustrup called his language "C++" instead
of "++C" as fair warning that he hadn\'t finished tinkering with it yet.

For the non-C types on the list:  "C" followed "B" alphabeticly, but "C++"

It makes a difference whether the "++" appears before or after a variable:

     y = x++;                   y = ++x;

A few years ago I had a book by the head(?) of the C++ team (Bjarne
Strousup?) about the derivations through to C++ - really interesting
reading.

A refers to assembly, B refers to \'B\' computer programming language.  Ken
Thompson decided A sucked (not platform independant) while writing unix on
the PDP-7, and up popped \'B\'.  Dennis Ritchie upskilled \'B\' and they renamed
it to \'C\' about the same year I was born <grin>.  Famous last words "This
capability [C\'s low-level-high-level-mix], however, can cause problems if
the programmer is not careful".

A+Ken->B
B+Ritchie+Kernigan->C
C + SIMULA + little bits of algol and ada -> C++

The hardest thing I found going from C to C++ was working out just why it
was *better* than what I had (note the upgrade obtrav here).  It started
with single-line comments and function pre-declarations.  Operator
overloading made me really want to use it, then classes became kinda
addictive.  Funny how it took another two or three years after its inception
to actually catch on - I remember looking at it around 1990, iirc.  Ansi
didn\'t stamp (on) it until about 1989.

I wrote a C version of that - called corncob (CORNy Code OBfuscator) - did
the BBS circuit, not really the internet.  Remember those \'do the most in x
lines without it looking like anything recognisable\' competitions?  I wrote
it for that :)  Some other bugger wrote a code-un-obfuscator as well, that
commented things too...

One of my areas in RL is making 1999 stuff plug into 1960\'s stuff -
interfaces and the like - such as plugging Westinghouse 0/-16v
26-bit-wide-busses into telephone modems for CAD systems.  I guess that
third-device interfacing will always be possible regardless of the TL gap.

Ouch!  It would suck if the positioning feedback mechanism stuck <grin>
Re-aligning the first voice-coil 8" drives was fun - get the opto in the
wrong place and they could almost break the housing off the back of the
drive!  Not what you\'d call minimum moving mass heads :)  Bloody hurt when
you got a finger in the wrong place, too.

Let\'s not forget artistic licence now.  "Dante\'s Peak", not a bad yarn
after all is said and done, showed both kinds of lava flowing out of the
same vent.  That\'s never actually happened on Earth.  Still, good effects,
and effects are one of the major points of selling sci-fi films.

How is that? The only problem with Jump drive that I\'m aware of is the

You\'ll find it in the novel "Earthlight". It\'s also in one of the
stories about constructing the first space station. There\'s an
accident, and some of the modules break loose. By the time they\'ve
managed to reach them, one is getting low on air due to a slow leak.

Based on his experiences scuba diving, he realized that 15 psi of
pressure difference is the same regardless of the *absolute* pressures
involved. So the effects of sudden exposure to vacuum are mostly the
same as those of being brought to the surface suddenly from 30 feet
down.

Sorry, but we can get that sort of tolerance in cutting rock *now*.
Check out the amount of error in joining up various recent tunneling
projects like the Chunnel. Over a span of *miles* the error was only a
few inches.

Lasers are very useful. They let you measure distances with extreme
accuracy, and maintain straight bores with equal accuracy.

But those tunnels aren\'t flying around in space.  What I\'m saying is, an 
asteroid probably isn\'t gonna be homogenous throughout itself.  There\'s going 
to be flaws and defects.  They\'ll have to be taken into account.  And not 
every rock will have the same defects in the same places.  Some of these 
defects will affect the strength of the rock around them.  IMNSFBHO, that\'s 
why the 20% wasted space rule is there.  If you can\'t place a vital component 
like a manuver drive or a fusion bottle in the exact location as every other 
boat in the class because of a structural defect in the rock, you\'re going to 
have to work a bit longer to place it.  Otherwise, it could crack the rock 
from the added stress.

True.  But you\'re not drilling a tunnel for an aqueduct or a car tunnel, you\'re boring out a random chunk of raw rock for a space/star ship.

Pebble is a standard cylindrical 25 DT ships boat that also operates as a fuel

Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...

I can see them as cheep monitors in systems where you *need* heavy metal but don\'t want jump-capable ships, like on picket duty in an interdicted system like Coventry (Reavers\' Deep 1723), an exile colony for the Confederacy of Duncinae.  I can even see a couple \'factory ships\' building these cheep monitors on site in the end user\'s system, packing in the needed components like computers, armaments, and drives, and manufacturing other things like bulkheads and wiring on site.

Whatcha think?

You could *possibly* land an ice hull, if you sprayed it down with ablative

But you *can* see the outlines of stuff if it\'s less than a foot or 2 inside the ice, or it\'s a *BIG* object.

Not really. C wasn\'t any different than any other procedural language
available at the time, it was merely a matter of learning the syntax, and a
few idioms. After that, all the skills I used in Pascal, assembly, and other
procedural, languages were applicable.

C++ was much harder to master, because to use it properly you have to
understand a different programming paradigm, which at the time no-one really
understood, and many still don\'t. The number of C programmers now claiming
to be programming in C++ but still writing C code is larger than you might
think.

Then Bjarne Stroustrup was either telling a fable or is just wrong.

Maybe, but that has no relevance to the derivation of the name C

Which was based on BCPL, a language Ken liked.

I was born <grin>.

And the reason they named it \'C" is because it was the next letter in the
name of BCPL. There is a reference in the C FAQ to a transcript of a talk
where either Thompson or Ritchie explains the origins of the name C.

There were considerations at the time C++ came out that it should have been
called \'P\', but as there was a thing known as the \'P-code\' interpreter
running around at the time, so it would have been too confusing.

Oh, and BTW, I was programming in Algol -W about the time you were born

What do you mean by this?  All my experience is mainly in BASIC, with a
little script language (QmodemPro and Telemate Script), but I bought
Visual C++ 6.0 a bit ago planning to learn it.  Did I get in over my
head?

That actually sounds very economical and reasonable. One heck of a, if

changing them from a town into a ship capable of moving throughout the system

5)  Given time, and it might be a few centuries, if the town/ship has been

 I\'ve always figured that given several centuries of incremental

Isn\'t it sad when the primary focus of an artistic endeavour is
the potential for marketing tie-ins? I remember a segment from the
Garfield cartoon series in which Garfield wakes up in the wrong
cartoon, a futuristic SF show with giant robots. At one point, when
Garfield is causing much collateral damage with a giant robot, one
of the characters says something about "the toy company will not be
pleased".

ObTrav: Toys in the Imperium. Are there toys like Imperial Navy
or Marines action figures? Perhaps based on a popular fictional
character in one of the services, a 54th-century G.I. Joe? I can
see it now -- G.I. Giiragu action figures, with allies such as an
Ithklur commando, and enemies such as a Zhodani operative complete
with turban and glowing eyes to designate his evil psi powers at 
work...

(I can also imagine plush, furry, stuffed toy Hivers...)

As far as I know, you don\'t have to be _invited_ to join the
webring, and you don\'t have to put up a superfantastic site - it
just has to be a site supporting the topic of the ring - that is,
any version of Traveller.

That\'s correct. I\'ve two sites up on the webring (BITS and my own, which is
somewhat content lacking at the moment).

Just follow the link to the webring homepage and follow the log on procedure.

Some of the older webring pages still point at the old ring homepage, but
the links from http://www.bits.org.uk/ (on the webring symbol and in the
jumpsites page) are current.

  The difficulty I have is that at this point (#5) the townsfolk are flat out
better off buying a starship - their "ship" (well, "rock") will cost a fortune
to equip with proper power plant and jump drives, with no series discount and
a pathetic cost:payload ratio once you remove the volume dedicated to their
permanent living quarters and economy.

  OTOH, it must have been done occasionally if only for social/cultural
reasons; I wonder if you can rent a battle-rider tender if yoy ask nicely?

I can see a Rogue masquerading as a pilot for a few months like this,
but for an entire four-year term? That seems a bit far-fetched to me.

What if he masquerades as a member of the Imperial Navy? Think _anyone_
could fake that for a four-year term?

    Silent Running was great.  The Forests were only one one ship, Bruce
Dern was great as an insane crewman who saves the trees & kills his fellow
crewmembers.  Hughy, Dewy, & Louie are great, proto-R2D2s.  The ships look
good & real.  That movie has everything, excepting big budget special
effects & that makes it all the more better to me.  It seems more real to
me, more gritty because you do not have aliens attacking & it is a perfect
movie for seeing what TL-9 ships look like.
    And do not get me started on Darkstar, Benson, Arizona, or the talking
bomb.  Loved that movie as well.  Almost the perfect movie for Traveller.
And, the talking bomb steals the show for me.
    As to Star Wars, well I have to admit I compare every movie I see to it
because it was the first movie I ever saw.  And, while it did have great
special effects, I am not a big FX fan.  I do like FX, but Star Wars, even
with its FX, Silent Running, & Dark Star are about the characters & story.
You can retell Star Wars in almost any time period you want to name, as well
as Silent Running, but I cannot see you doing it with Darkstar.  Sorry, but
it is a SF film all the way.

	How do you folks handle "spear carriers",  i.e., nameless brigands, 
enemy soldiers,  pir----err scratch that one, hireling soldiers in mercenary 
campaigns.

	My practice has been to make them incarnations of "Joe Genero", with 
stats being 7 across the board for the physical stats, with  INT, ED and SOC 
sometimes a point or two lower for criminal types.  I used something likee 
the draft T4.1 for assigning skills--i.e., most are one term  or two terms 
with skills assigned from correct lists.

	I have been thinking, however, that for mercenary hirelings and other 
soldiers, that perhaps they should have physical stats of 8 or so, and I\'\'ve 
seen some soldiers in published adventures with really high DEX or STR for 
everyone in the unit.

	I think it would be nice to have a standard set of NPC\'s to  use in 
these situations, and have made sevarl versions myself over the years, but 
keep running into problems--such as are soldiers "average guys STR 7"  or is 
that a rating more in line for shopkeepers and clerks?

	So my question is, just how do you handle setting up your "Spear 
Carriers" in your actual games, what works and what doesn\'t?

True, but what about on a Battleship where a single surface feature
might well be smaller than the smallest hit area. Then you chances
of hitting it are over estimated. Another factor is that a hit area
on a large ship could easily  be as large as the presented area of a
smaller ship--can you then aim at scout sized areas on the
battleship? :-) (good for fighters)

I\'ve been known to pull mine straight out of \'1001 Characters\', or just think 
for a minute or two about what they\'d carry, throw 2D6 four times for their 
physical stats & intelligence, then 1D6-2 for appropriate skills for the 
weapon they\'re carrying.  I write it down on a 3x5.  I \'gear\' \'em up with a 
1D6; 1-3, no armour.  4, jack, 5, mesh, 6 cloth.  I don\'t worry about their 
EDU or SOC; they ain\'t likely to be around after the PCs get done with them.  
This gives me a quick assortment of spearchuckers with variable weapons 
skills.  If a particular chucker wants to do something out of the normal, like 
call for backup, I roll 2D6 against his INT.  Under, he thinks of it.  Over 
it, he doesn\'t.  "GM specials\', i.e., clues like maps or pieces of hardware, i 
just give \'em.  I *WANT* the PCs to get the \'specials\' for whatever reasons 
cross my warped lil mind...  <grin>

A Jump 2 battle rider?????  Whyfor????

The idea for building came about after reading about the increased security at Coventry (Reavers\' Deep 1723) when they exiled a popular admiral after he attempted a coup.  They\'d want more ships around it to keep any supporters or rescuer wannabes away, but *not* want to commit massive fleet resources on a long-term basis (about a hundred years; long enough to *ensure* the admiral was dead, dead, DEAD).  They don\'t have to be jump-capable.  They really *DON\'T* want them to be jump-capable just in case the exiles *do* manage a breakout and escape offworld.  And they want them *cheap* so they don\'t break the bank.  I can see them using surplus components a TL or two lower than the Confederation\'s mainstream for them as well; they don\'t have to be cutting edge, they just have to *work*.  They wouldn\'t need 6G monitors for rocks in orbit.  1G rocks are just fine.

Land in the polar areas. Of course, you\'d still have trouble with it

Actually, there\'s every reason believe that a rocky or nickel iron
asteroid *will* be quite homogenous. That\'s because of the way they are
formed. Essentially, when they first accumulate out of "dust" in the
early stages of system formation, there\'s enough radioactivity that the
heat first melts the "ice" and lets the stony and metallic components
settle to the center. Then they metal and the stony and metal
components sort out by density. The asteroid then cools over millenia,
giving you a quite well annealed hunk of rock & metal with an icy
shell. 

The ice won\'t stick around in the inner system. And collisions will
break off large chunks. These days, we\'ll have broken off chunks,
bodies that have had chunks broken off, bodies that hit hard enough to
fuse but not hard enough to shatter, and finally, "gravel banks" -
bodies that consist of a lot of smaller pieces held together by their
mutual gravitational attraction.

Only the first two types are going to be suitable for building ships
from. And flaws can easily be detected by "echo sounding" the rock. But
given the nature of the rock, and the types of collisions, I\'d bet that
the flaws will tend to be major or insignificant, with nothing
inbetween. 

The 20% waste space is simply the space required to give a *big* safety
margin for structural integrity.

Ah! But it *won\'t* be random! No more than a sculptor starts with a
random chunk of rock. It\'ll be selected for the size and shape. Then
they\'ll attach some probes and sonar map the interior. After that,
they\'ll start killing the spin (a job that will take a while and some
skilled workers). And then they move it to where the construction will
take place. 

They map the interior *before* spinning down and before moving because
a major flaw could result in the rock coming apart during either
operation.

	IIRC that\'s why the table generally doesn\'t go down to "single"
items--TNE groups things together for the damage tables, and once you
hit a group, then you pick which item you hit. For example, the chart
won\'t list "Port Laser Turret #3."  Instead, it has entries for
"Weapon."  Then you decide _which_ weapon is hit.


	Still, I\'m sure there are flaws in this scheme ... but it comes damn
close. Every system below full simulation will have pathological
cases. If your megatanker only has a single weapon, I suppose a
purely mechanical generation of the damage tables would leave it
invulnerable.

  The same reason why properly designed SDV\'s will have them in a drop-tank
friendly universe - vastly increased strategic flexibility for trivial cost
in cash and performance. IIRC my "Rabid Poodle" from last fall used this as
well. Another good reason (IMHO) why drop-tanks should be shown the door.

  Oh, and with the accompanying tanker(s) it\'s still both cheaper _and_ more
powerful (i.e., cost-effective) than an internal tankage warship.

I used to get NPCs several ways. First off, I had a computer program
that could generate characters (don\'t ask, it was for a different
system, and is buried somewhere). I\'d generate a few more random
characters every week or when I was bored.

I\'d also swipe NPCs from published adventures. And finally, I\'d keep
the sheets of PCs who got killed or left the game.

So I\'d have cards for each character in a file box, divided by class.
And by "how good" they were. That is, low stats and skills first,
better ones later.

Any that survived encounters got their stats (and gear where
applicable) adjusted accordingly, and put back in the box. Ones that
were killed, just got put back in (but facing backwards, so I wouldn\'t
re use them unless I ran low).

When it seemed right, I added any "quirks" (often the result of random
reaction rolls, or "throwaway" stuff from interacting with PCs) to the
card. At some point I might have given them a "real" name and a full
fledged character sheet. 

But the basic idea is to start with lots of *semi-generic* NPCs, and
let them *acquire* "personality" in play. Most won\'t. But a few will.

Well, as I recall, there were *definite* "limiters" built-into the
mechanism. 

The whole thing was about the size of a dishwasher.

That\'s assuming you\'d *want* jump-capable ships on picket duty in an 
interdicted system.  If you\'re trying to keep the indigs safely sealed up in 
there, you *DON\'T* want them to have access to jump drive, so you *wouldn\'t* 
put them on the picket ships.  This way, if the indigs *should* capture a 
picket ship, they can\'t jump out of the system.

Characters in games I run rarely employ hirelings. However, for NPCs in
general I usually generates lists. When I run Traveller games, I usually
have several pages of names: terran first names and last names, usually from
a variety of different cultures and languages. I also have a page or two of
vilani names. I categorize first names by gender usually...

I also usually have lists of stats in case an NPC is important enough to
warrant their use. When the time comes that I need stats and a name I just
pick them and random and *voila*... Instant NPC. It works well enough for
me. My players usually can\'t tell the difference between a scripted NPC (one
that I\'ve specifically written into the adventure) and an off-the-cuff NPC,
so I guess I\'m doing something right.

If I\'m caught completely unaware, it\'s not hard to just pop stats out of my
head.

Yup.  The book I learned that from was "The Late Night Guide to C++" by
Chapman.  Great 1st C++ book, it assumes that you are already a competent
programmer, so it doesn\'t go through "This is what a variable is" that many
other intro to a language books do.  And then of course the Stroustrup
books ("The C++ programming language" and the ARM).  

ObTrav: What are the standard reference works that every programmer (and by
extension, every starship) would have handy?  What material do they cover?

I thought the \'P\' code as short for pseudo-code, i.e. half-compiled.  I\'ve
got a script language I wrote based on that idea (more like good ol\'
m-basic, really) where keywords and variable names are precompiled for
speed.  I\'m in the process of converting it to windows to preserve a bunch
of old code...  Back then I didn\'t comment things enough (a trick that
younger players shouldn\'t forget).

  I was assuming that having everything be within a couple feet of where they
might be on another ship of the class would work - it\'s the same drives going
in the same places, and I doubt that the precise placement of conduits will
matter that much (or that the supposed exact copies produced by sentients in
normal shipyards would be that nearly identical either).

  As it happens asteroid-hulled starships make for uneconomic freighters at

it\'s sufficiently odd to not be worth the dubious benefit, although there\'s
probably a case to be made for a novelty passenger liner or ten.

  FWIW, the rules are currently quite explicit that warships do get the
discount.

Many years ago (12?) I was looking through some commercial software
written in basic that had done something similar.
The difference was that this version of basic was case sensitive
(the variable AAAAA was distinct from AAAAa, etc.) so it only
had one variable name...

The compression utility also played tricks like the max line length was
255 characters (plus 1 byte to hold the line length) but the internal
format replaced each basic keyword with a 1 byte token so that the lines
were more than 255 characters long when displayed on screen.

from a different machine:

	LET X = VAL(1)

sums it up I believe.

While in PC situations you usually only need a couple of shots, remember
that in a protracted military situation a warship may need to expend
hundreds of missiles and maintain the ability to fire for hours at a time.
And at least IMTU, most ship weapons the PCs have started out as military
designs (whether surplus or just a "New! Special Civilian Model!").  So the
70+ reloads makes sense to me.

And of course, for those who have telescopes...both Mars and Venus are still 
in good positions for actual viewing!

While Mars has passed it\'s best opposition point, and is starting to recede 
in size again, you can still get some good views if the atmosphere is steady 
(not true today in NJ, where it\'s clouds, rain and hail expected!).

Venus has been yielding some very good sights (it\'s the very bright "star" in 
the western sky, around 1/3 up, while Mars is the not quite as bright reddish 
"star" in the eastern sky--Mars is parallel to another dimmer but slightly 
reddish real star, that might help you pinpoint it). Some folks (using 
colored filters) have reported seeing streaks in the dark portion of the 
disk--there\'s a lot of debate, like the canal debate of whether these are 
real or not!

Coming up to bat later this summer will be Mercury (in the low morning sky) 
and Jupiter (in the low morning sky now, but gradually getting higher and 
higher each morning before dawn).

You don\'t need a huge telescope to see details on some of these (plus 
Saturn). A "mixed lens/mirror" design such as a Cat or a Mak as small as 90mm 
will give you good views of these, plus the stars and galaxies and the moon 
(of course). Refractors as small as 70mm will be useable, and reflectors as 
small as 4" can work on some of these targets. Of course, "aperture is power" 
and the bigger the scope, the better the view. My point is that you don\'t 
need the 200 inch Hale telescope to see things!

And it\'s kind of neat to see this stuff and show it to your players of your 
Traveller game!

I used to do a combo of ways:-

1)  Really fleshed out, to return often or key regular (ship\'s crew) NPC\'s
I\'d roll just like a normal PC in every way.
2)  Just like the NPC supplements did it.
3)  Un-used NPC\'s from adventures, magazines, or that other\'s had rolled up
for me.
4)  Winged it.  If I needed some and didn\'t have any within reach (left at
home when at another venue, or in the study and I was to lazy/busy to walk
down the hall), I\'d roll 3-sets of 2D6 and wing the rest according to the
situation... not always difficult to do ;^)

And don\'t forget "Aliens", the sequel to "Alien".  "Aliens", IMO, was
not only
hard-core sci-fi, it was hardcore _Traveller_.  From what I can remember
of
the Colonial Marines characters, the writer just had to have played
Traveller
at some point in his life.

One of the best one-liners from that show that\'s a permanent part
of my campaigns occurred when the Marines were ordered to continue a
hostile-area patrol without ammo. One of them replied:

One design they talked about has the  potential to be a cheap (or cheaper)

one 5.0. two 4.5 and one 4.0 would become a 5.5. Is that a valid 
rules interpretation? 

I need to know these things so as to create a valid picture of

The First Annual TML Vilani BBQ at Denny\'s will be Friday, May 28th, at
around 1800.  This time is very flexible.  Anybody who is attending should
contact me by Wednesday to let me know how many folks you\'ll be coming with.

Hmm... I wrote before thinking. The jump drives do work similarly to
what The Quick and Dirty rec.arts.sf.science FAQ 
http://www.sirius.com/~treitel/rass/qdfaq.html 
which pretty much points to The Relativity and FTL Travel FAQ on
this point
http://www.physics.purdue.edu/~hinson/ftl/FTL_StartingPoint.html

say they should, but I get a hokey feeling about the 100 diameter
limit (what does the diameter of a planet have to do with it\'s effect
on space-time?) and the fact that it takes one week to jump any
distance, no matter what the power of the j-drive. hmm...

But in Ringworld, someone who has just returned from a century long
ramjet missions says to someone (Frederick Wu?) "Our theories say
the speed of light cannot be exceeded.", and he replies, "We have
different theories." I thought that was amusing.

Ever hear of Stanley Clifford Weyman?  In the early 20th Century, he
successfully impersonated state department officials, Naval officers from
several different countries, An Army Air Corps officer, a doctor, a member
of the Royal Court of Norway.. and those are the ones we know about!

His finest moment came in 1926, when he was the "doctor" for Rudolph
Valentino\'s girlfriend, Pola Negri.  In this guise, he was interviewed by
dozens of newspapers, and even signed Valentino\'s death certificate!

The only thing that tripped him up was his greed and love of publicity..
sooner or later he either stole too much, or attracted too much attention.
A more circumspect faker could pass for years.

IIRC, in the first edition of High Guard there was a limit on how much
armour you could add to a ship. Asteroid armour didn\'t count against this,
so when you combined the two armours asteroid hulls had the maximum armour
(at a given tech level).

Mind you, I could be wrong...

Dark Star is a wildly funny and dark low-budget film about the crew of the
Dark star, a ship sent out to to destroy planets that are in rogue orbits
and might threaten otherwise habital planets.

They\'ve been out there for *years*, and are all a little nuts.  But they
only have one more bomb to drop.. if they can convince it to leave the bomb
bay!

Well, actually, there\'s been considerable discussion about this on the
list, and it turns out that tidal force (the rate of change if the
gravity field) is probably a better indicator of where you can jump
safely. For the average planet that works out to just about 100
diameters. Go to the archives and search on \'tidal flux\' it\'ll eb in
there somewhere, but I don\'t have it handy So the "100 diameter rule" is
a rough rule of thumb.

one week per any distance is handwaved away by supposing that we\'re
jumping to different energy levels in jump space...like electron shells
in atoms, there are definte whole \'jump numbers\', but the transition to 
and from each jump number to the ground state in our universe is the
same, regardless of what level you jumped at.

a modern dogfight, where a ship with a good manuever rating

Since then, I\'ve watched a couple of specials on the history
channel, and seen a number of missles on the news, so I was 
thinking - if a gunner (perhaps pilot?) was guiding the missle
dodging could be more difficult.

Of course I am talking about the vector based starship combat
system from LBB #2.

And if I really wanted to get in trouble I could bring up
jump torpedoes with warheads instead of mail. They could be
programmed with system and world maps. You would then have
a J-space cruise missle. But I won\'t mention it, because I
don\'t believe in jump torpedoes.

I don\'t have my LBBs with me, but I seem to recall that missiles have a 6G
accel, and for game purposes, hit the turn after they are fired.

As a referee, my favorite line from a sci fi movie: "Apology accepted,
Captain Needa."

The evil emperor Lucan often used a line similar to this in a Star Warsish
Megatraveller game I ran some while ago now (Star Wars: The Shattered
Imperium). After seeing TPM, I am certain this is to be the next type of
game I\'ll run. After the upcoming Morrow Project: Reign of Steel campaign I
have planned, that is. A MARS team on an Earth ruled by robots -- woo hoo!

I\'ve just downloaded and checked out Jim V\'s Calendar program, and I 
like it a lot.  Not only can I use the Gregorian calendar for my 
First Contact campaign info, but it also has the Imperial Calendar 
for games set in a more traditional Traveller setting.  (And it\'s 
versatile enough to handle adding a new calendar designed for my 
fantasy world, the next time I set up to run games in it.)

Thanks very much, Jim.  I\'ve also enjoyed your Galactic 2.4, and am 
eagerly awaiting the development of the next version.  Combined with 
Stuart Ferris\' World Builder Deluxe, the two make it very easy to 
create and keep up with a sector\'s worth of data or more, as detailed 
as the PCs want to get.  :)

    'body' => '     The recent discussion on the command structure of the
Imperial Army and Navy brings to mind some thoughts on
megacorporate structure.  Although these are usually less
strictly organized than the military, hierarchies have some
similarities wherever they occur.  Here are some suggestions:

     Most corporations, whatever their line of business, have the
equivalent of an "enlisted" class.  These are the ordinary
laborers or wage-earners.  

"Ranks" would be:
E1 Laborer
     (Unskilled or semi-skilled employees, skill level 0 or 1)
E2 Skilled
     (Regular employees, usually skill level 2)
E3 Assistant Foreman
     (skill level 2 or 3)
E4 Foreman
E5 Senior Foreman
Possibly higher ranks in larger organizations.

Professionals
     Some organizations consist chiefly of skilled professionals,
such as engineers, physicians, lawyers, or accountants.  These
positions usually require college level education and skill level
2, with appropriate certification by some credential-recognizing
body.  If employees, these are more often salaried than wage-
earning.

O1 Trainee
O2 Journeyman
O3 Senior Journeyman

Supervisors
     Most organizations also have an "officer" class, which
consists of salaried professionals.  These are either promoted
from laboring positions, or transferred from professional trainee
(O1) or higher positions after a couple of years of staff
experience.

O1 Assistant Supervisor
O2 Supervisor
O3 Shift Supervisor

Both
     Above O4, the professional and supervisory tracks merge, and
follow the T4 Bureacrat career titles as in Pocket Empires. Only
the titles are the same: the particular skills vary from one
profession or corporation to another.

O4 Assistant Manager
O5 Manager
O6 Senior Manager
O7 Executive
O8 Senior Executive
O9 Assist. Director
O10 Director.

The names of these ranks would differ from one profession to
another and from one company to another, but most organizations
have something similar.

Employees are also organized into groups of various sizes.

1. Crew. 2 to 6 employees, led by an E2 or E3. (O2 or O3 for
professional offices).
Typically one vehicle, one machine, a small retail establishment,
or professional office. Independent entrepreneurs and business
owners (even 1 person offices) are considered at least O2.

2. Team.  2 to 5 Crews: 10-25 employees. Led by an E3 to E5,  or
O1 or O2, depending on the job and the company. (O3 or O4 for
professionals)
Companies using unskilled labor often use large labor crews of 20
or so with a small supervisory crew. Complex tasks such as
production lines will use teams composed of crews of different
specialists.  Professional organizations make one of these a
secretarial or administrative crew. If composed of workers of one
specialty, a team is more often called a "staff".  Niche and
specialty manufacturers are often of this size.

3. Shift. 3 to 6 teams, 50-100 employees. Led by an O3 or O4,
assisted by E4, E5.  (O4 or O5 for professionals)
A common maximum for workers at one site at one time. A shift
will usually include teams of various types. Usually include
administrative and maintenance crews. Medium-size retailers,
small industrial and manufacturers.

4. Site. 3 to 6 shifts, 200-400 employees. Usually led by an O5.
Shifts are sometimes actually differentiated by location rather
than time. Common size for a large retail establishment.

5. Plant. 2 to 6 sites, 600-1500 employees. Usually led by O6.
Medium-scale industrial or manufacturing establishments.

6. Works.  2000 employees or more. Only the largest industries
have this many employees at any one site. These are major
employers and there should be no more than one or two of these
per million population or so.

Isn\'t there a large meteor crater near the town mentioned in the song?
In the movie _Starman_, I think they had the Starman land (and leave)
from that crater. It made me think the crater was either famous, or the
makers of _Starman_ really liked _Dark Star_.

I always thought it was "Winslow Arizona", but my hearing was never
very good.

    'body' => 'Greetings, All,

For some strange reason this weekend, I had the bizarre thought of 
preparing a UPP describing myself in Traveller terms for my Project 
StarRise website.  (I think it was someone\'s sig file that finally 
latched on to the creative side of my brain; either that, or it was 
the article in Traveller\'s Digest 21, which described the staff of TD 
in Traveller terms.  Not sure which.  :)  It brought to mind some 
games I\'ve played in and run in the past where the players played 
themselves expressed in the game system\'s statistics.

Not having done this in Traveller, I thought I would ask if anyone 
has run a game like that under any generation of the Traveller 
rules (including GURPS, although I\'ve been there and done that, but 
not in a Traveller setting), set somehow in a Traveller milieu?  What 
was your gaming experience like?

(Despite how bizarre the idea might sound, most of the people who
have played in my "Play Yourself" games had a great time, despite the
fact that they may have entered play with a character background they
would otherwise not have played.  You get a lot of roleplaying 
fun and character development under this approach.  I\'ve also had a 
blast playing versions of myself in AD&D, GURPS and HERO systems.)

Anyway, just some wandering thoughts I had.  Thanks for your time.  I 
now return you to your regularly scheduled thread, already in 
progress...

Happy Travelling,

Wow, someone\'s actually reading the my designs... <G>

Named after famous reefs and other maritime hazards from Earth Oceans
and Terran maritime mythology, btw...Scylla, Maelstrom, etc.

As I said, it was an experiment. I tried it with the maximum armor rating,
had a volume problem, used a spreadsheet to optimize things downward
a bit, used the space left over from rounding to fit in a fighter wing.

It should be interesting to see how they do. Their agility is pretty low,
but they should take a while to go down. Since HG doesn\'t use
firing ship\'s agility as a modifier, they make a nice and stable
weapons platform for those Meson spinal mounts of theirs. <G>

Of course, the Sansterrean Defense Fleet would be happy to complete
the campaign with no shots fired in anger.

The song is "Benson, Arizona", but the famous meteor crater is Meteor
Crater, far to the north. It\'s just off I-40 about 30-40 miles east of
Flagstaff. I do believe it is closest to Winslow, which is a bit farther
east IIRC.

Quote from my wife, who I dragged to see it on a recent vacation: "GO
BACK!! It\'s just a big HOLE in the ground" ;-)

I have NO clue why that song is in Darkstar, unless someone associated
with the movie is from there. It was original for the movie, too, IIRC.

AMEN!! These three pieces of software have made
my running a campaign *so* much easier it\'s
incredible.

You can even have two separate calenders for players
and the GM by placing copies of the Calendar software
in separate subdirectories and building a shortcut
to each one. This allows a GM to toggle between the
two during play (assuming he/she has access to a
desk/laptop during play).

In Toronto I\'d recommend Hairy Tarantula. Julie and Leon are great folks,

I\'ve still got my program for generating MegaTraveller characters. Select
the career, click the generate button, and out comes a fully-generated
character, complete with physical description, psychological profile, and
motivations. Options allow for limiting the terms served (to get a bunch of
young grunts, say, instead of retired generals) and batch generation.

I\'d disagree here. Aliens is hard-core 2300AD, not Traveller (with the
possible exception of the Chamax).

Alien:Resurrection is hard core Traveller (which is sad, considering that
it is the weakest of the four). The PC\'s, sorry, mercenaries behave just
like a typical Traveller group. Shame it was played for humour though. I
prefered Alien^3 to Resurrection (I know some will disagree).

Interesting, but I would break the rank structures up a bit more.  E1-E3
being unskilled/apprenticeship, E4-E6 being skilled/journeyman and E7-E9
being master/supervisory.

Then the \'O\' levels could be reserved for management, O1-O3 being managers
(day to day responsibility), O4-O6 being operations (focusing on quarter and
yearly goals), O7-O9 being corporate officers (VP and up) focusing on the
long term goals and directions of the company.

I figure that "fortresses" built into kilometer thick or better nickel
iron bodies ought to be a feature of many systems. Give them minimal
thruster capability (say .001 g) both to move them from the belt, and
to prevent them being stationary targets for *big* kinetic kill
projectiles. Small ones they can pretty much ignore. 

And with such *huge* bodies, if you can keep the interior layout a
secret, meson fire is going to be *really* ineffective. You\'ll have to
either fire at random, or else try laying down a pattern of fire
throughout the entire volume of the body. That\'ll take a *long* time.
And since it can mount a *bigger* meson gun, you\'ll be in range before
it is. :-)

I\'m one of the folks that says it\'s just a "rule of thumb". The *real*
limit is based on the curvature of space being below a certain limit.
It\'s just that for typical planetary *densities*, that limit works out
to about 100 diameters. 

If you want to work out the formula for yourself, work out this:
	X=M/R^3

Where M = 1 earth mass and R = 10 and 100 diameters of a size 8 planet.
That\'ll give you the curvature value for those two distances. Then you
can work out the "real" limits for other bodies by plugging into this:
	R=cuberoot(X/M)

You\'ll get the same "10 diam" and "100 diam" answers for planets with
"standard density" as given in the rules. For things like stars and gas
giants, that have *lower* densities, the limits will be much closer in.

"Obviously" a quantum effect of some sort. :-)

Remember, these bodies aren\'t *like* terestrial rocks. These formed
from a single melt, cooling slowly. No intrusions of other rock types.

The stony types may have a transition from one type of rock to another
(different minerals crystallize out of the melt at different temps, and
there is a gravity gradient to let the crystals settle to the bottom of
the melt). Though such transitions are likely places for the rock to
have seperated when a collision spalls chunks off of the colliding
bodies. 

Nickel iron bodies are going to be *very* uniform. And for ship sized
bodies, you can set up solar mirrors to *melt* the nickel iron and let
it cool at an ideal rate for annealing. That eliminates cracks and
flaws. It does add to the construction time, but that\'s about it.

BTW, when you chop out that "odd" chunk of rock, what\'s to stop you
from *filling in* the space with rock you\'ve removed from elsewhere?
With *current* technology, you could rig a "plasma sprayer" that\'d
spray droplets of molten rock into the cavity, where they\'d quickly
fuse with the rock. You just spray back and forth and build up a layer
of "normal" rock. The end result will be a "patch" of nice, uniform
rock.

I got the idea years ago after watching "High Risk", a pretty cheesy late 
70\'s movie in which a gaggle of down on their luck ordinary joes head down to 
South America to rip off the Mr Big of the cocaine cartel.  For me, the key 
was that character generation was a group activity where the players had 
ample opportunity to challenge some of the players delusions of grandeur, but 
also allowed the players real world skills to come to the fore.  It does help 
if you have an interesting group, as we always did.  
As a general rule, I\'d tell them that the average adult is a 7 in all stats, 
then we\'d go from there.  For skills we used the rule thumb that a level 0 
implied familiarity (i.e. a Red Cross certificate for first aid allowed a 
medic-0) up to 3-4 for professional level knowledge.  Very seldom did anyone 
push for more.  

After creating the stats, I\'d set the stage by telling them that it was a 
saturday night and they had gathered for some Traveller action, then reveal 
my secret plan which would make them all rich.  The trick was, the plane was 
leaving in 3 hours, and if we missed it the scheme would collapse.  That 
started it with a bang and helped to prevent too much "organizing" by the 
players.

A few fond memories include:

The frantic hustle to prepare, as players maxed out their credit cards buying 
gear, swiped guns from family members, and assembled a motley assortment of 
camoflage and costumes.  I was always impressed that at least one guy would 
insist on staying comfortable in shorts and t-shirt while the rest did their 
best commando impressions.

"I" almost always got killed, and the players usually agreed I had it coming 
for getting them into such a spot.

The guy (not a regular member of the group) who wanted to know what his 
social standing was based on the fact that he grew up in one of the most 
depressed areas of town, dropped out of high school, was dishonorably 
discharged from the Army, worked in a travelling carnival for several years 
before going on unemployment.  The group consensus was "2".  

The time the players opened the safe and were in a hurry to leave.  I said 
that it was so packed with money that it would take several minutes to stow 
in their bags. Then, the guy who was a bagboy at the local market forcefully 
said "I have a Sacking skill of 4", so they were soon packed and gone.

Numerous examples of the use of weapons, riding beasts, and attempting 
communication, in other languages, and parachuting with no skill.

The time I returned it to Traveller\'s sci-fi purpose by allowin them to get 
deep in trouble, and then allowing the aliens from Pournele\'s "Janissaries" 
to show up offering them such a deal!

The use of flaming attack chickens to provide for a distraction.

The player, a real estate saleman in real life who took along the tools of 
his trade, and bluffed his way into the baddies compund by showing up and 
knocking on the door.

I could go on, but won\'t.  I can say that they guys I know always love these 
sessions, and look forward to them as special events.  I recommend that you 
give em a try.

I\'ve never played MP, but a roomie ran it for a while. He had me help
him with details on a surprise for the players. A *functional* Thor
system (orbit to ground kinetic kill). 

I don\'t know if it was on automatic or being run by baddies on the

We did the Thor routine in one of the campaigns.  After it snuffed their
base, on player remarked, "Now that I gotta have!"

I\'m not sure this would be as strong as the original rock.  We\'ll have to see this one happen in real before I\'ll believe it...

It uses two pre-generated tables, one with a list of attributes, another
with a list of skills.  Different tables are pre-generated for different NPC
types.  Usually the entries clustered around the middle of the table are
more common than the ones at the extremes.


(1)  Roll 2d6 twice:  first for attributes, second for skills.

(2)  Modify attributes and skills by desired NPC level.

(3)  Use common sense to force-fit to situation.  (eg:  Substitute Laser
Carbine skill with Shotgun if that\'s what you feel the NPCs would be armed
with.)

Example:

Guards and Soldiers Table

Attributes
2     ST:  9  EN:  8  DX:  A  IN:  8  ED:  6  SO:  7
3     ST:  8  EN:  9  DX:  9  IN:  9  ED:  7  SO:  8

         :
12     ST:  A  EN:  9  DX:  8  IN:  8  ED:  9  SO:  7

         :
12   Laser Carbine-2, Small Boat-1, Survival-2, Cutlass-3

NPC Level:  Novice: -1  Experienced:  0  Veteran:  +1


As to what is an appropriate level to rig the tables at - I usually consider
that typical military types will have slightly superior physical stats (say
888777 or 898777) while typical sedentary workers will have slightly
decreased physical stats.  (say 666887 or 565898).

Elite military types will tend to also have all stats elevated (say 9A99A7
or BA8898).

On the whole however, I find that spear carriers with 777777 stats can be
much more of a challenge than CCD9B9 if the 777777\'s are played as trained
and therefore act intelligently versus highly rated but stupidly portrayed
NPCs.  Overriding all this is the requirement that the NPCs be so balanced
as to give the players an enjoyable and appropriate challenge.

And so does a Death Star... which was my point.

I\'m willing to accept that Star Wars is the peasant hero myth cycle and can
be told in any time period or genre. There are plenty of mythological and
literary parallels to Dark Star. I\'m not going to go any further because it
is beyond the scope of the list and a potential spoiler for folks who
haven\'t seen this excellent film. If you\'d like to discuss this further, I\'d
be glad to in e-mail.

  If the attacking meson gun is big enough then the main issue will be
one of light lag and its effects on firing solutions, in which case the
effectively stationary weapon platform may still lose to even a single
battlewagon.

in the 1980\'s, had the players do just that -- according to the rules, 
the players used their own selves as templates for their super characters 
(then had a bunch of random tables for power generation). 

Most of the time, we ignored this rule and just rolled the stats 
randomly, but we did try once to do a super group based on the rules.
What I was most afraid of beforehand was having arguments about what
levels our stats are. ("I do *so* have a 14 Intelligence!") (on a 3d6
scale, with 10 as the baseline for the "average" person). What we got
was quite the opposite... ("You\'re a very personable kind of guy, I 
don\'t see why you can\'t have a 16 Charisma...") 

More recently, some fellow gamers and I came up with the GURPS advantages
and disadvantages for ourselves and a few other people we knew. (eg, "Bad
Sight" for myself, being blind as a post without glasses or contacts. Also
a 5-point caffiene addiction.) But we never actually used that in a game.

ObTrav (sort of): the challenge in using the players themselves as PCs
in a Traveller game is how to get the characters to jump forward in time
nearly 3500 years to the time of the Imperium...  :)

Turning this around: has anyone reading this ever run (or been in) a
scenario in which the Imperium-era PCs wound up travelling back in time
to present-day Earth?

That level of trade is only 10-50 dtons a year - the other thing to think
of is the holding costs. Sure, you could wait until the bi-annual
Boondocks-Back\'O\'Bourke Express comes around, or you could send it the long
way on the monthly freighter from Boondocks to Big Smoke, and then from Big
Smoke to Back\'O\'Bourke. This might be more expensive, but if it\'s fifteen
months faster ...

I\'d say no. The two 8.5s would add to about GCr 1.5 - bottom of the 9.0
level. You could add ten 8.0 routes (total GCr 2.5), and still be in about
the middle of 9.0 territory with GCr 4.0.

The three-for-one is a bit of an approximation. It\'s a log scale, so three
MCr250/8.0s should add to a MCr 750/8.5 (a "frequent minor" route) rather
than to a MCr1000/9.0 "feeder" route.

As a general case, I\'d say no. Two x.5 routes should round up to x+1, but
you need ten x.0s or five x.0s and a x.5 to turn into an x+1.

Because of the log scale, I\'m inclined to think it wouldnt have that much
of an effect. You would need about a hundred 6.0 routes to turn into one 8.0.

I\'m very interested in what you come out with btw :)

The key to a successful missile attack is to overload the target\'s point
defense. The number of missiles a target can deal with is often known as
it\'s "saturation number". Generally speaking, a target can deal with up to
it\'s saturation number until the cows come home, but saturation number plus
one will equal one hit, saturation number plus two will equal two hits etc
etc.

Therefore, the key isnt so much sustainability of fire, but getting enough
missiles onto the target in a small enough window of time to saturate their
defenses and hurt them.

Thus for starship combat, you want to maximise RoF at the expense of
sustainability. Doing anything else than this just results in their
point-defense crews getting target practice.

From what I read before the release of Aliens4, the makers and writers
wanted to pretend that Aliens3 never happened in the 4th movie... I was
hoping, but they mad reference to it, so it wasn\'t a dream sequence or
anything...

From what I was lead to believe, mostly hard-core sci-fi buffs really loved
it (as they needed a s/f fix... anything man!!!!!), but that\'s not a bad
thing either.  Cinifex (spelling?) at the time, said they never made 3 the
way it was intended, and didn\'t even film 30% of the script!  Maybe it could
have been great.

I do agree that A4 was the most Traveller-like of the lot!  The humour was
less than what one might find in an actual RPG session of any game.

correct, at TL15 you can have metal armour 15, factor 18 if it is a planetoid
and factor 21 for a buffered planetoid.

Buffered planetoids also have the best configuration defence against
Meson Guns of any armoured ship (ie better than needle/wedge, almost
as good as dispersed structure.)

The downside is having to move all that "rock" around (35% waste space).

This is true for High Guard 2nd edition as well.

However, if you\'re using FF&S or later, you move the ship around by mass
instead of volume, so things should improve. Against this, the upper limits
on metal armour disappear.

We were playing D&D and the "setup" was being told that during a game
one of us made the usual disparging remarks about "gods" after beating
one (we\'d been playing in the same campaign for 10 years, we actually
had *non*-munchlins that copuld take on that sort of thing). Anyway,
the roof peels back and a voice says "You think it\'s easy?" and we wake
up in a D&D world.

Don\'t try this with me sand my friends. We could oufit a few mercs
without going out and buying *anything*. And my late friend the
gunsmith had all sorts of stuff we\'d never be able to buy.

In the D&D game, the GM learned the hard way that some of us had lots
of obscure stuff memorized. For example, not only was I able to
describe how to make gunpowder from *scratch*, I also knew how to make
various acids, and several other things. 

I made a small fortune by building explosion proof lamps for the local
miners. You basicly order "cloth of copper" *gauze* from the weavers
guild, and use it as screening around the flame. I also introduced
carbide lamps (have a mage throw some lightning bolts into a trench
full of mixed coke and limestone. The result is calcium carbide).

Our GM started getting worried when I proved that I remembered enough
of the process to be able to produce phosgene with a bit of trial and
error. The final straw was when I and a physics major started planning
on how to build a nuclear reactor. We planned on handling work in "hot"
zones by using expendable personnel. Mostly orcs and condemned
criminals. Our bombs would have been low yield, and dirty as hell. But
they\'d have worked. 

The GM decided we should do something else... :-)

They use essentially the same process to make synthetic rubies and

This should be highly tech level dependent.

Rare at low tech, at industrial age tech multi-thousand employee
sites should be quite common and form a significant proportion of
the workforce.
As tech increases, diversity of production and the improved ability
for remote working reduces the size of a works.

A balance to this are works (such as an office block) where many
companies share the same building.

Not in Traveller, but in Call of Cuthulu (and not all the players,
but the fax repairman played a fax repairman with very similar
skills and stats.

I\'d used some of his workmates as NPCs but found the player-NPC
interaction somewhat lacking...

And of course the all-time favourite exchange  :

"No. How about you ?"

Or :

"Hey lieutenant, is this another bug-hunt ?"
"There may be a xenomorph involved."

It\'s the bomb\'s job to destroy something so that others will be saved.
This mission has become confused - the bomb believes the self-
sacrifice is important, rather than the desired end result (a safe star
system). This perverted ethic of self-sacrifice is common in war
stories - the officer who is determined to die with honor and glory,
rather than do his job, for example.

I had a GM try taking our D&D players, as themselves, to a fantasy
land on a quest. Some of us knew chemical formulas for things like
gunpowder, and we brought along backpacks full of books and
chemicals swiped from a local college laboratory. Some of us had
read the Cross-Time Engineer series, so we were ready to *rule*!

Our GM had done some reading as well. After we crossed over, I
looked at one of our books - and found the writing to be illegible (as
per _Doomfarers of Coramonde_ and _Starfollowers of Coramonde_).
It was like I had crippling dyslexia, though later I found I could read
the local "common tongue". Perhaps we could have had a mage or
cleric cast a read languages spell to decode the books, but that
didn\'t do us much good at the time.

Then we looked at the chemicals. Some of them had changed color,
or smell. A few had things moving in them, some kind of energy or
bizarre lifeform. Yeah, we had some basic knowledge of chemistry...
unfortunately for us, the reigning materials science of this world was
magically-oriented alchemy. We didn\'t stay there long enough to
figure out the rules of alchemy, it seemed that the rules of chemistry
worked for some things (brewing, baking, tanning, metalworking) but not
others (explosives, mainly). And when they didn\'t work, they usually
didn\'t work in a spectacular and unpredictable fashion.
(For "spectacular and unpredictable", read "embarrasing and dangerous")

We had a rifle, two shotguns and a couple of pistols, with a couple of
hundred rounds of ammo each. For some unknown reason, the bullets
that were already made worked - we just couldn\'t make more gunpowder.
Instead of being high-tech rulers of the planet, we were a bunch of
know-nothing zero-level wimps with some noisy ranged weapons.
By the time the GM took pity on us and sent us home (by having us
meet our own characters), we were more than ready to go.

My game is in hibernation (recharging the creativity batteries) but it\'s
not far below the surface.

We have 6 Traveller players on the hook, including Jo Grant and Kenji
Shwartz, of list (and published) fame.  Note we are, in fact,, playing
games twice a week (most of us); an AD&D game by Jo, and my Traveller
campaign which, while on hiatus, is replaced by a GURPS (Cyberpunkish - but
toned down) campaing run by another person.

So you say that it should always round up to the low end of

While that might be so, that is not how the rules read. They talk 
about jumping up to the next highest route type, not the next highest 
BTN. I am working on a cannon trade map. I have to use the rules as 
closely as I can. If the rule needs to be errata\'d, great. I can live
with that. If not, then I need to find out the way that our Traveller 
Economists think this needs to  be. As written, it is unclear and 
limiting my ability to work up a detailed map.

Then I would certainly be open to a valid method of combining them as
written into the rules. If the above is a valid mesthod, then the
combining of large routes needs to be changed to match. Otherwise, it 
becomes an excercise in futility.

Not acording to the examples above. 10 6.0\'s, 2 6.5\'s, 10 7.0, and 2 
7.5\'s. That might seem far fetched but as I am seeing right now just
how many lower level routes go from one place to another, it is not out
of 
the realm of posibility. And if our Economist folks do decide that the 
rule needs to remain as it is and incoperates the lower level routes as
well, that will have a large impact, as well.

You can see why it is very relevent to the question. On these small 
matters, the path and addition of small route (and large one\'s now 
that you mention them) swings the balance of trade in a subsector. 
 
> I\'m very interested in what you come out with btw :)
 
I will be most happy to share the results once I am done.

Once I have the rules correct and work it out by hand, then I can 
try my hand with the database I have finished and see if I can create a

set of queries that will do it correctly. That is my end goal.

People I know inside the greater Boston area refer to the area outside 495
as "Sleestac Territory" and the farthest out MBTA stop as "the last pylon".

If you understand these references, you watched too much TV (on Saturday)

Damn, its never an hour!  It\'s a half hour at non-rush hour and 1 1/2 to 2
hours from 3:30 to 7pm weekdays.

Oh, and its three hours on fridays in the summer before a long weekend,
being the route to Vacationlands to the North.

I have an Excel 5.0 spreadsheet that works relatively well.

For various copyright reasons I feel I must inform you that, to use it, you
really need the Megatraveller Referee\'s Manual.

The spreadsheet can be downloaded in its latest public form at;

http://web.mit.edu/pbrenton/www/mtsdpb10.zip

Someday I\'ll get around to uploading a newer version and will inform the

There are several other MT spreadsheets out there, but I do not recall ever
seeing a standalone program.

Jim Vassilakos\' Galactic 2.4 software and Calendar

Stuart Ferris\' World Builder\'s Handbook Deluxe software
is at:

http://freespace.virgin.net/stuart.ferris/index.htm

Choose Stuart\'s "TAS Resource Centre" link.


NOTE: Both require a PC (i.e. won\'t run on a Mac). Also,
Stuart is in the process of making a major upgrade to
his software; you may want to wait a couple of weeks
before downloading his stuff.

For Mac-based software, check out Rob Prior\'s talented
work at the BITS site:

Makes me wish I had a Mac. \'sigh\'

BTW, everyone, there\'s one caveat with using Jim\'s Galactic
with Stuart\'s WBD software. Galactic is DOS based; WBD is
for Win95/98. WBD can write all its info to text files
readable by Galactic *but* WBD uses the _long_ naming
conventions allowed by Windows. Galactic can only read
standard DOS-named files (i.e. 8 characters. followed by a
period, followed by 3 characters).

That means all WBD-generated system data file names need
to be changed to fit DOS\'s limitations. Given that there
are an average of 9 bodies per system and there are about,
what, 500 systems just in the Spinward Marches, that\'s
*alot* of files to rename.

And neither Windows95/95 nor DOS provides a pattern-based
"Find & Replace" function/command. So we\'re talking at
least 12 hours of keyboard work..and I\'m a *fast*
keyboarder (calling me a "typist" will a near-C rock lobbed
at you).

A gaming buddy of mine has offered to write a Perl routine
which should be able to perform this function. I\'ll let
you all know how it goes, if you\'re interested.

Well, I have to admit, you\'re absolutely right on all counts, Dom.

Of course, I was playing in a military Traveller campaign at the time
Aliens was showing so it hit very close to home for my group at
the time.

But, gamewise, you\'re absolutely right.

Well, two methods immediately jump to mind:  temporal stasis (Ancient 
technology) and cryogenics (low berths.)  The discover of an Ancient 
device that no one else has found or will find for 3500 years is, 
IMHO, pretty lame.  That can be worked around by having some "greys" 
pick the PCs up one night and experiment on the device using them as 
guinea pigs.  But it\'s still weak, and hard to fit into canon.

Low berths are also a bit rough on canon, but otherwise they are the 
ideal option.  Traveller Digest 21 covers the use of such technology, 
and offers the social aspects of low berthing by "Timers," those 
individuals who, for whatever reasons, decide to invest some money 
and put themselves into cold sleep for a period of time.  Some are 
longterm "Timers" staying under for decades or centuries.  The oldest 
Timer Society started in the late 2200\'s (Terran dating) here in the 
Terran system, and continues until the Imperial present of 1120 
(Imperial dating) and beyond.  Some of the original members of 
this Timer Society were those who had been placed into cryogenic 
suspension for illnesses that could not be treated in the early 21st 
century.  (The article actually lists the early 2010\'s, but research 
was probably done before, and the PCs could have been "volunteered" 
for the process.)

According to the article, a person under Cold Sleep loses one point
from one physical characteristic per 25 years of suspension,
recoverable by 1d6 days of hospitalization per point lost after the
person is revived.  Death results is all physical characteristics
reach zero.  Thus, longterm cryogenics use can be dangerous, so the
PCs would have to wake up every so often.  As the average person has
physical characteristics of 777, then that means death occurs after 
(21*25=) 525 years suspension for Joe Genero.  My guess is that most 
Timer Clubs would bring people around every 400 years, just to insure 
their survivability.  This gives the GM an opportunity to run 
vignettes of different time periods for the PCs, showing them 
first-hand the transition of humanity and interstellar civilization 
over time.  This process would also give the players a greater sense 
of connection and continuity with the background of the 3I, and gives 
the GM the chance to explore some aspects of the OTU that he hasn\'t 
had the chance to examine.

Now, according to the article, the last of the original Cold Sleep
survivors that made up the first Timer Club died in -1999 (Imperial
dating).  To get around this point, when the PCs are revived at some
time before this date, they could be forced into a position where
they have to change their identity.  Perhaps, with all their wealth,
they simply pay the Timer Club officials a hefty bribe to change
their records, saying that they died on being put under, while they
actually live on under a pseudonym, avoiding debt collectors (the
interest on those would be killers) or media attention, whatever. 
Perhaps, a PC marries a fellow Timer and his/her name is changed
based on some local custom.  (A mate addicted to the Timer concept
would also give the PC and his friends an excuse to keep putting
themselves under.)  The records could have gotten lost or switched. 
The PCs are fleeing some enemy during a particular time line, and go
into Cold Sleep under false identities to outlast their foes.  The
possibilities can provide some very interesting adventure material
for a creative GM.

Time Periods that would naturally arise from a 400 year cycle would 
include:  the middle of the Interstellar Wars, the middle of the Rule 
of Man, Twilight of the Long Night (where the PCs wake up with much 
less money, due to the collapse of 2I), midnight of the Long Night, 
during the formation of the Old Earth Union (Long Night), during the 
early 3I days of recontacting the Solomani or during the heyday of 
the Solomani in the Imperial court, during the Crisis of \'99 and the 
Psionic Suppressions, and Imperial present day (1100-1200, depending 
on the game you\'re running.)

Emergencies and equipment failure can be used to pull the PCs out of 
Cold Sleep prematurely if the GM has an adventure he wants to run in 
a particular time period.  The big thing for a time-spanning campaign 
like this would be to provide the PCs with a reason to keep putting 
themselves under.  Good PCs can probably find reasons once they get 
the gist of the campaign flow, so a GM\'s work may not be that 
difficult for them.  Depends, I guess.

(The quest for immortality might be a good reason, too.  Anagathics 
are TL15, and won\'t be available to the PCs until around 1000 
(Imperial dating).  So Timing might be the only way to make it until 
then.)

Roughly nine to ten stops at around two years apiece, means the 
characters will age about twenty years over the course of the 
campaign.  Should be pretty interesting.

I hope that this helps give some creative suggestions for a campaign 
designed around the concept of PCs playing themselves.  It also gives 
me a great idea for an NPC "Historian" that the PCs might meet up 
with someday.  :)

Thanks for your time.  I now return you to your normally scheduled 
thread, already in progress...

Ottawa? Lake Ontario? I gotta check out an atlas sometime...
anyway, in Ottawa there\'s Fandom (Fandom II?) which is basically downtown
somewhere, near the main downtown public library branch IIRC. Ottawa is
not a big city, so I think this is your best, if not your only bet.

In Toronto, the best suggestion I can make is the Sci-Fi Cafe at 1600 Steeles
West - which I seem to recall is best reached by going north on the Allan
past the 401, a bit further north, left on Steeles and then right into one 
of the strip malls - the cafe itself is behind a Tim Hortons - which, I may
add, should be your #1 destination at all times in Canada. You cannot get a 
decent donut in the US. I\'ve tried. It\'s just not possible. (Some of you
may mock my interest in the pastry sciences...). There are lots of other 
comic stores in Toronto that have decent RPG selections, but none stick
out in my mind. There\'s a decent one on Yonge just north of Dundas on the
west side whose name I forget, but if you walk from Dundas to Bloor up Yonge
on the west side (which is semi-fun in and of itself) you should go by
at least a couple comic/game shops (and a lot of other shitty shops).
There\'s also the Silver Snail, which has a much smaller RPG selection and
almost no OOP stuff, but is located in the much hipper Queen West area
(Queen St west of Yonge to Spadina).

As for Niagara Falls, stick to the wax museum. There isn\'t much to be had
there as far as I can tell. Go to Niagara-On-The-Lake as well. It\'s
just as touristy, but a lot nicer than Niagara Falls.

If you want to be exhaustive, http://www.toronto.com has a pretty good 
listing of comic shops, which is where you should start looking.

A major works of any kind has to be supported by many different
enterprises to supply food, housing, transportation, medical,
cultural, educational, and other services to the employees and
their dependents, not to mention suppliers and customers for the
works itself. It is the ability to provide these services that
limits the size of a works.  If employees live in company housing
and have company plumbers, the company will employ a greater
proportion of the society than if they live in private housing
and pay independent contractors, but the number of plumbers
needed does not depend significantly on where their paycheck
comes from. Spaceports and shipyards come to mind as examples of
"works" that may well increase in size with TL.

Many 2000+ employee companies, such as governments, school
districts, and corporate chains have several distinct "plant"
sized or smaller sites, and cannot be considered a single works.
I didn\'t consider sites such as malls or office blocks where
employees are in separate corporations with separate managements
as works because I was looking at the structure of one
corporation, not several in one place. The headquarters complex
of a sufficiently large organization would probably be a single
works.

     I tried to follow the general pattern of rank advancement in
T4. I took descriptions of military structure and tried to give
the ranks approximately similar levels of responsibility. I also
went by RW experience with low-level employees in several
different industries.  In T4, advancement from E1 to E2 occurs
after two years, and then one E rank every four year term after
that. That sounds very roughly OK.  After about 2 years on the
job, someone should be familiar enough with it to be considered a
"regular", at least semiskilled.  Employees at E2 are often
assigned to help train or supervise new hires or temporaries.  It
might take a couple of terms to rise to a foreman (E4) rank, but
not too much longer than that. Only large organizations would
make much use of E6 or higher ranks.  Perhaps union officials in
US industry might be considered as high-ranking "enlisted"
employees.

     The O-levels are intended to be principally management, but
must include educated professional employees. These have to be
treated more like lower-level management than unskilled labor,
and in some cases they do have wage-earning employees as
assistants. I could see merging the O2 and O3 ranks. This would
mean adjusting the responsibilities for the various officers (O3
where I have O4, etc.)  

For a megacorporation, rank titles with an appropriate time focus
might be:

O3 Assistant Manager     day-to-day
O4 Manager
O5 Senior manager        month-to-month
O6 Operations Director
O7 System manager        year-to-year
O8 Regional manager
O9 Vice president        decade-to-decade
O10 President or CEO

Smaller corporations often omit intermediate ranks and give high-
level titles to their highest level officers. The extreme case is
the O2 who is president and CEO of his corporation of two
employees. As another example, I would consider the CEO of
General Motors to be about an O7 or low O8 on the Imperial scale.

Well, last time I looked Win95/98 actually created 8.3 filenames, and
stored the long file names as "hidden" directory entries. So I take it
that the 8.3 names aren\'t suitable for some reason?

As for pattern based search and replace:

dir /b > file
editor file
ren file file.bat

Just use an editor with the desired pattern recognition capabilities. :-)

That\'s it, but I no longer go there. One of the owners (the bigger David)
was very rude the last few times I was there, selection was poor, prices
were more expensive that Hairy Tarantula or Fandom, and they sold the items
they promised to hold for me (and telling me "next week" for months).

The shop is Hairy Tarantula. It\'s just above the Money Mart, two blocks
(and a bit) north of Dundas on the west side of Yonge.  Pet the cats, and
chat politics with Leon.  He and Julie are good folks.

The Snail is also pretty expensive.

appears to be the only mention of annual maintenance in the draft jump
rules.

This appears to mean that if I, as starship owner, never get an annual
maintenance for my ship but I always use refined fuel, I will not suffer
any penalties. By inference, ships with purification plants don\'trequire
annual maintenance. At least, not as far as misjumps go, anyway.

Am I missing something?

2. Under the Jump Mishaps Effects table, what does the Lateral result

3. Under the same table, what does the Misalignment result mean?

Yeah, our GM had gunpowder have a "critical mass". So firearms didn\'t
work. But grenades, mortars, and the like did. BTW, in the campaign
where we *weren\'t* playing ourselves, we once found a cache of weapons
from Earth. One guy died by properly role-playing an attempt to figure
out a mortar. Since we were familar with traps that fired crossbow
bolts, and were loaded by pushing the bolt into a tube against a spring
until the spring latched against the trigger mechanism, he figured the
big tube and the finned projectiles worked the same way. He inserted
the tail end of a mortar round into the tube, and then *pushed* it
down. With predictable results.

Easy. Modern weapons don\'t *use* black powder, which is what you guys
were trying to make. Modern smokeless powder is a lot more complex.

I think *all* of us were SCA members. Heck, the games we played at
home, we sometimes took new players outside to the practice pell to
show them that a sword is a lot harder to swing than most folks think. 

We also had an "archway" between the living room and dining room that
was 10 feet wide (same as a "standard" corridor in most people\'s games)
We\'d line them up in the archway and ask them to *try* swinging
(practice) weapons. They quickly agreed that 3 people across in that
much space was about the most that could manage to fight...

Yes, we actually *did* have people who thought that 5 people could
fight in that much space. Sheesh!

Actually, there\'s another way. Cryonics. That is, being frozen at the
point of death or shortly thereafter in hopes that you can be revived
in the future and that your condition can be cured then. This has been
going on for at least 20 years.

It avoids a lot of the problems of low berths, though it adds some of
its own. 

Pluses				Minuses
- ----	----
no loss of points over time	you\'re dead at the start
available now			could be a long time before they can
				revive you, much less cure you

I\'d guess that *some* cryonicly preserved people will be revivable by
the time low berths are invented. But it could take some time *after*
low berths are invented to be able to repair the damage from freezing. 

For some somewhat more extensive info on the subject, grab a copy of
"The First Immortal" by Halperin. 

Once low berths are avialable, cryonic suspension will no longer be
done. But there will be a lot of cryonicly preserved people
(corpsicles, to use Niven\'s term) awaiting revival for some time.

I\'m the RPG coordinator for ShoreCon \'99, which will be held on
September 9-12 1999 at the Hilton in Cherry Hill, NJ. In that capacity,
I\'m making a final plea for GMs to run Traveller events (Classic,
MegaTrav, New Era, GURPS, you name it!) at the convention. The best way
to get people interested in the game is for them to -play- the game, and
a convention is one of the easiest and most visible ways of
accomplishing that!

The deadline for event submissions is June 1st, and by visiting our
website at <http://gameconventions.com/ShoreCon> you can find complete
information on hotel accomodations, online GM registration (now
guaranteed to work!), and even get on the mailing list to have our
pre-registration book sent directly to you. If you are interested in
GMing an event, the time to sign up is now!

This year ShoreCon will will be having several special guests, including
Peter Adkison (President and CEO of WotC/TSR), Steve Jackson (President
of Steve Jackson Games) and Jolly Blackburn (creator of Knights of the
Dinner Table)!

We\'ll also be boasting Target Games\' 1st Annual Games Expo, several
LARPs (Vampire, Star Wars, and Toon!), as well as a large selection of
RPGs, CCGs, Miniature events and Network Gaming!

Thanx for your time...

The rules also state that you should bump up trade routes
where it makes sense to do so, if the numbers don\'t exactly match.

Jim is the trade route wizard but I think your interpretations are
mostly fine.  Combing 2 8s and an 8.5 to make a 9 seems to
fit the numbers fine.  What doesn\'t is 1 8 and 2 8.5s making a
9.5.  Thats too generous, as the combined trade route would
be 2.5GCr Max / 1.75 GCr Avg.  But a lone 9.5 is 5GCr
Minimum!

What you need to remember with the BTN table is its log nature.
Each integer increase is an increase in scale size.  To keep things
manageable, I would just look at the Min and Max ranges of the
combined Crs/Year and see where that falls.  Three Minor
routes; (8.0-8.5) will range from 300MCr to 3GCr.  Close
enough to call it a 9.0.

This reminds me.  I made an effort a few months ago,
to transplant a Morrow Project type setting into
the OTU.  I wanted to try running a PBeM.

I tried to link it to the Solomani Phoenix Project.
I even tried looking for a suitable ROM setting, which
would lead to the Long Knight.

Ultimately, I concluded that no matter how I spun it,
it would only be a superficial non-Virus version of TNE.
And TNE did that kind of setting fine.

So much for trying to be original.  ;-)

Easy. Modern weapons don\'t *use* black powder, which is what you guys

Ah-hah. The smokeless powder was too complicated for the alchemy
spirits to understand, so they left it alone.

I think it had more to do with the bullets being "complete" - to us, at
least, or perhaps to the bullets themselves. Same thing with the guns,
our wriistwatches, etc. The chemicals *knew* they were ingredients for 
other things, so didn\'t have enough identity to remain unchanged. There
were other inanimate objects that had some kind of self-awareness - 
I think the GM\'s view of alchemy was based on this concept.

That\'s just a guess, I hadn\'t talked out the logic with the GM. It may
be he just liked the idea of our (limited) ammo supply working, but 
didn\'t want us making big barrels of explosives or revolutionizing the
local economy.

The only problem with this is the 300,000 sleepers on the ESA Long Range
Colony Mission, who survived up to 2,463 years in low berths, with only one
interruption (Adv 5: Trillion Credit Squadron, p. 40).

The background of the Islands Clusters Campaign makes a good "cicada"
campaign, although not quite close enough for the players to play
themselves. You start before 2050 (post-Cyberpunk), prepping for the
journey. You go to sleep, wake up somewhere along the way for 5 years --
somewhere interesting, no doubt -- go back to sleep, and wake up in the
Islands Clusters. Once there, you start a colony on an untouched world
(World Tamers).

If you really wanted, you could postulate that some sleepers with "special
talents" were kept on ice, and revive them in the 5640\'s to deal with the
threat of invasion from outside -- from the Imperium.

OK ... each major corp in an area gets 1% of Gross Product for that area.

For megacorps, thier area is the Imperium. Makhadurin and Tukera thus have
1% of Gross Imperial Product, which is very, very, very gross. Trillions.
Many trillions. More than I wanna count.

On the other hand, Oberlindes only gets 1% of the Spinward Marches. Call it
6 TL15 planets 10 billion pop, thats ummm one percent of 15 000 per capita,
times 10 bill, times six, which is 1% of 90 trillion, or call it a rough
trillion credits. Thats turnover, of course. Profit is proably a small
chunk of this.

Jamison Factors run a tramp trader, dont they ? Maybe five mill turnover,
absolute tops.

Kinda puts things in perspective, doesnt it ...

Agreed.

What I meant was that at current TL, the town where I work only
has *one* "Works" for about 170,000 people. Improved automation
means that very few workplaces would qualify as bigger than a
"Site" (more machines but fewer people).

Go back two TL and a population of 100,000 might have perhaps
half a dozen "Works".

I think you need something larger than "Works", eg "Major Works"
which employs more than 10,000 people in one place. This is the
size that is at the one per million people rate at current TL.

I figure that Imperial military interrogators have an attitude similar

prisoners...for information.

This is about what I figured. However, keep in mind the main direction
of
the acceleration and provide support for soft body areas (i.e. the
abdomen)
with that in mind. The back of a human acceleration chair isn\'t really
providing support for the "back"; it\'s providing support for the skull,
spine,
the back of the ribs and pelvis, and the kidneys. These then provide
support
for the rest of the internal organs. Fortunately, there\'s nothing hard
and
dense in front of the kidneys.

With K\'kree, if the push of acceleration is from the floor and they\'re
lying
belly-down on a cradle, this would be the equivalent, in terms of
acceleration affects, of a human lying perpendicular to a jet\'s
acceleration
while facing backwards. The soft abdominal organs will be between the
force of acceleration and the spine.

As for what effects this may have on these organs, I\'m clueless but
having
one\'s abdomen crushed between a couch surface and one\'s spine can\'t be
comfortable. Any medical/physics specialists out there what to expand on
this?

It seems to me, though, that the skull must be supported (the
K\'kree have *big* heads) and in such a way as to allow speech, sight,
and hearing. Because of a K\'kree\'s muzzle/snout (compared with a human\'s
relatively flat face), would turning the head may be more difficult or
dangerous than a human performing the same movement? \'shrug\' Just
something
to think about. Also, make sure the couch/whatever helps keep the blood
in the brain or provide the K\'kree with their equivalent of G-suits.

BTW, the placement of controls must also be such that they can be easily
monitored/manipulated without requiring a great deal of movement of the
head or limbs. I admit I\'m assuming the worst accel to be 6Gs. One way
of making the controls rather unique is to take advantage of
the K\'kree "hoof" design by placing control surfaces in an arc/circle
around a central cup/well that the hoof\'s central bone is placed in
during high G maneuvers. This well would allow the hoof to remain in
place with a minimum of effort while allowing the hoof\'s manipulative
digits\\tendrils\\whatever to interact with the control surfaces.
Have multiple cups/wells for different control arcs/circles and make
the control surfaces themselves slightly recessed. This would allow
a hoof to slide along the control _panel_ surface from well to well
without accidently interacting with the control surfaces themselves.

Have the control panel surface angled in such a way that it slows down
limb movement as the limb is pulled away from the direction of
acceleration and it helps limb movement as the limb is moved in the
direction of acceleration. Basically, angle the control surfaces so
they help offset the acceleration affects. There\'s nothing wrong with
having the control panels automatically change this angle as the
force of acceleration changes; mount them on hi-TL equivalents of
gimbals.

All of the above ideas are from my non-scientist/physicist brain. They
really need a sanity check from those TMLrs who are more knowledgeable
than me.

Sorry about the length, folks, but Andy and Doug B. pushed an analysis
button I didn\'t know I had. It\'s their fault, it\'s *all* _their_ fault!

That was my only problem with it, too, after reviewing my info.  
Unfortunately, I no longer have a copy of the Darrians Alien Module, 
and was not able to generate appropriate names before posting the 
info to the list.  I like your explanation, and the choice of 
Zar-tis, as it flows off my tongue better than Ya-ri-zdet.  I will 
perform a rewrite shortly, and will incorporate your suggestions.

I recall the article - "The Whitechapel Werewolf", or something like that.
A Vargr combat-drug addict breaks into a top-secret research installation 
and travels back in time to Victorian England. The heroes, professional
troubleshooters, are equipped with equipment that looks period but
isn\'t, and are sent back to deal with him.

Since the Vargr is a little out of his head, and a devotee of a rather
bloody death-cult, and very sneaky, he gets to start both a werewolf
rumor and the legend of Jack the Ripper. They included a very nice
timeline for the adventure, linking the activities of the mad Vargr to
the reported odd happenings of the time. The also included a
newspaper article or two, with reports of an invulnerable were-beast
(a Vargr in cloth armor, hyped up on combat drugs). It looked like
an interesting change of pace for a Traveller group, but I\'d be very leery
of adding a gov\'t time travel project to MTU.

Thats a GM decision. The breakpoint is 8 to determine if those chunky DMs

Yes. It isnt 100% clear because they are guidelines ... as Jim said, it\'s
both an art and a science. It could be errata\'d ... but a better idea is
for someone to achieve Guru status by actually doing it for the Spinward
Marches *grin*. Me, I say \'Mixon et Frere\' is a great name for a

OK, this is the way I\'d deal with this. You start from top-down, not from
bottom up. The 2 7.5s dont round to an eight, so the rest never occours -
unless you want to use the exemption on the top of p19 to give it one. You
have to have a route to make a bigger one, and if it\'s smaller than BTN 8,
it isnt a route ... I\'d also rule that \'exemption\' minor routes and
\'combination\' routes dont count for three-into-a-bigger route.

OK. This is how I\'d do it. Go from top down.

Get a big map of the Marches, with starports, trade codes and WTNs on each
world, and x-boat routes inked in.

Every time you calculate a route, type it into a datbase.

Start with Mora, and link it to the Golden Worlds - Lunion, Strouden,
Glisten, Porozolo, Rhylanor and Trin.

Given you are connecting a 6.5 system to a bunch of 6.0s, we have Major
Routes for everything 29 parsecs or less, and Feeder Routes for the rest.

Next, connect the Golden Worlds to each other. Feel free to pencil in some
jump-4 Express Routes (eg Mora-Carey-Strouden-Lunion), and if it\'s 19
parsecs or less, it\'s a Major Route in any case. There should be a Feeder
Route between each, given that 2 6.0 worlds create a Feeder Route out to 59
parsecs.

OK, we now have the solid bones of trade in the Spinward Marches.

Next, the arteries. Jewell, Efate, Adabicci, Aki are at 5.5, so link them
to Mora, then to the Golden Worlds, then to each other.

Now, we should have all the long-haul Major Routes established, so it\'s
time to calculate the capilleries. Go subsector by subsector for 5.0 and
Amber Zone 5.5 worlds - a 5.0 will have a Feeder Route to Mora if it\'s 29
parsecs or less, and a Feeder Route to a Golden World if it\'s 19 parsecs or
less (Major if it\'s within 5 parsecs). Remember to adjust BTNs for Ag and
Ex or NAg ... there is the odd WTN 5 Ag world.

OK. Now we should have close to all the Major routes, most of the Feeder
routes established, and the economically important worlds of the Marches
burned into our collective skulls. People at work will ask you if you\'ve
seen Karen, and you\'ll say \'Five Sisters. Five flat. Ag Ri. Minor route to
Glisten\'.

See if any triple-Feeder routes upgrade to Major status, then see if any
triple minor routes upgrade to a Feeder.

Madness now lurks. Minor routes. By this time, you\'ll be looking at a map,
going *bang*, thats a Minor route.

Do it subsector by subsector. First the 4.5s, then the 4s. Most of the
routes to the Golden Worlds should get sucked into bigger existing routes
at this point. You might get \'lateral\' routes - 2 4.5 worlds with a +1/2
Trade Code Mod can make a Minor Route if 9 parsecs apart.

Now the payoff. We now now how much trade there is in the Marches. Knowing
this, we can calculate exactly how much shipping there is, and how many
Free Traders.

Whoever figures that out gets guru-hood in my book.

*thinks* the Bridge at the One True Rowany Site was about ummm seven feet
wide. Most fighters I ever saw in contact in that space was about fifteen.
Cramped front rank of four using short weapons defensivly, lots of pikes
and halberds and such behind them. It\'s very very messy, but doable.

From what I understand, 1000 of the 10,000 people onboard were 
revived every five years for five years of contact with the 
descendants of the original descendants.  This lot was rotated, which 
would give every one five years out of every fifty.  Doesn\'t work 
very well for keeping the first generation young enough to be viable 
once they arrived at the Island clusters.  (In fact, they\'d be dead, 
as they would have aged 300 years in the time it took to finally make 
it to the destination.)  If I misremembered the numbers and it is 
somewhat less, then at only 100 awake at a time, the entire frozen 
generation population gets recycled every five hundred years, and the 
volunteers are only 30 years older when they arive in the Islands 
cluster.  That\'s forseeable, but not a preferable solution.

As for the implied difference between the recorded events behind 
TCS\'s Islands campaign and the TD21 Medical Digest article, the TCS 
adventure was written well before the TD21 article, so it becomes a 
matter of preference on which one would take precedence.  Older 
versus newer, GDW vs DGP, adventure vs article.  Varies from TU to 
TU, I would suppose, although the general consensus will probably be 
to support the TCS background, as canonical references tend to win 
out over rules systems.

Which removes the restraint of having the PCs wake up at various 
times throughout history.  With that concept in mind, then the PCs 
could be put under, and brought out at any point in history when the 
Referee would like to have them come into play.  Works for me.

BTW, Shadow, in regards to your previous reference to cryonics, the 
TD21 article does refer to the same process as cold berthing (as 
opposed to chill berthing), and defines that as the basis for low 
berth technology until TL 11.  I guess that, if a Referee dislikes 
the UPP point loss per 25 years rule for cryonics/cold sleep, then 
that ruling could be applied to the TL11+ gravitic manipulation 
methods detailed, and increase the difficulty of the revival task one 
level because the subject was frozen at the point of death for TL 
9-10.  Just a thought...

Thanks, everyone, for the feedback.

When presented with two possible paths to follow, the rules 
say to follow the one with the most trade already on it. That 
makes sense. However, a common sense question. For example, 
there is a world that has a BTN with a neighbor that is a 9.0 
and is two hexes away. However, the path with more trade going 
that way detours and would make it a 6 hex path. That would 
drop the BTN to a 8.0. You can see that would probably create 
a niche market in ships to fill that route and not follow the 
path rule as in Far Trader. My question is, at what BTM loss point 
would that start taking place?

So, the way even the larger routes are would follow this as well? 
Good, that is the sort of clarification I needed. I was unsure

I just wanted to be certain that the same sort rule for the big boys
applied to the little fish too. That makes sense.

Assume 1G = 10m/s^2
I am rushing towards the spot I want to protect at 60m/s, and I
suddenly detect my enemy travelling towards me at 60m/s. I don\'t
react until we have passed each other, and I fire a 12G missle,
and it launches at 120m/s, leaving it at an absolute standstill
relative to my enemy. It cannot hit in the next turn. How fast
does it accelerate now, and what is its homing mechanism?

I get the idea that you don\'t think it has any acceleration, so
it is more like a cannon than a missle, in which case the enemy
escapes.

Ok, revision time. The "hollow" in the "couch" I described must act
more like a water bed. That\'ll provide support *without* crushing
anything. 

However, for "high" acceleration (and I suspect that the K\'Kree can\'t
handle really high acceleration), they\'ll not only need support for the
head & neck, but they\'ll also need *forced* ventilation. That is, some
sort of breathing mask, and something in the couch to help the lungs
expand (collapsing is no problem!).

Herbivores only need to turn their heads to look *directly* behind
them. 

Speech will be somewhat restricted by K\'kree accel couches. But there\'s
not really a choice, that sort of body *can\'t* operate for more than a
very short time "on its back".

Well, that\'s where the K\'kree body plan has an advantage. Their
*normal* range of movement has to include their head against the ground
for grazing, their head held at maximum height (to watch for predators)
and everything in between. Therefore, having their head on the same
level as their body isn\'t a strain. So just the legs need "g-suit" type
fittings.

It\'s kinda hard to see *how* it could decrease. There\'s *zero* chemical
activity going on (they are stored at liquid nitrogen temps). So they
can\'t "spoil". The container is sealed, so that prevents sublimation of
fluids in the body ("freeze drying"). 

The only thing left is radiation damage to cellular structures, and
that adds up very slowly.

A rectangular "block" rising from the floor, with a curved depression
in the middle. They walk up to it and either straddle it, which allows
use of the feet on control "pedals", or they "kneel" into it, which
leaves the legs folded.

The body is supported by the "couch", the legs don\'t need much support
as long as they aren\'t supporting the mass of that body. 

The neck/torso is probably supported by an extension of the "hump".
Since the K\'kree are grazers, they should be comfortable with the head
straight out in front of the body. This also gives the maximum G
tolerance as the head and the heart are on the same level. For high G
manuevers, the legs will be in a sort of "g-suit to prevent blood
pooling. The rest of the body can make do. 

Oh yeah, given the nature of herbivores, the couch *will* be fitted
with sanitary connections. And a "feed bag". Their digestive systems
*will* require a lot of bulk, meaning that high fiber foods like "hay"
have got to be provided, not merely high quality foods like grain. 

When under normal acceleration, I expect that there may be a series of
"wraparound" displays placed at diferrent levels, you can select the
display by raising or lowering the head. 

And when I say wrap around, I *mean* wraparound. While the K\'kree
*must* have binocular vision in at least part of their field of vision
to be good tool users, being descended from herbivores, it\'s likely a
narrow zone directly in fron of the head (say a 30 degree field). But
the eye placement gives them monocular vision out to almost 45 degrees
from straight *backwards*.

                        30
                      \\    /
                       \\  /
                        \\/
               120     /  \\    120
                     /      \\
                   /          \\
                       90

Given this sort of visual field, you can see why I specify "wraparound"
displays. In the 30 degree field, their vision ought to be as good as
humans. In the 120 degree fields, it\'s good, and include a special
sensitivity for motion (like our peripheral vision, only more so).

I suppose that there are also some sort of arm rests for high
acceleration. 

And yes, this stuff means that a human would be hard pressed to operate
a K\'kree ship, It might take two or three humans per K\'kree crew
position.

What about the toys of non-humans?  OK, we all expect young Vargr and
Aslan to play with chew toys (well, so do very young humans, I guess). 
Hivers don\'t pay attention to their juveniles, so have no toy culture. 
Do Ael Yael have lots of flying toys?  I think a merchant would do well
selling frisbees to them.  K\'Kree are basically mammalian, like humans,
Vargr, and Aslan, so I\'d expect to see some things that are pleasant to
hold, but as they are vegetarians, probably won\'t have stuffed animals
- -- too much like holding a corpse.  Droyne toys would be interesting. 
Many probably help the immature Droyne with casting.  

The only canonical reference to toys that I can recall is the robot in
Adventure 1: Annic Nova.  It had an IR sensor and would follow a
character around.

Nitpicky point...LN2 temp is way above the \'zero chemical activity\'
temperature, which is absolute zero.

I think that you were aiming at zero _enzymatic_ activity, which will be
pretty close to the truth.

There actually will be a fair bit of chemical activity going on, even at
LN2 temps, and that\'s what causes the slow degradation.

The weight of bone is that much more.  The weight pressing down on
the organs at the bottom shouldn\'t be much more than the other way
around.  Though our breathing moves in an out the front so there
is an issue about having a low acceleration cutoff before you can\'t
breath.  However, I think lack of blood to the brain is the main
issue.  I would think that the couch would just have to be well
designed to support the soft underbelly evenly (and there isn\'t
much you can do unless you put the K\'Kree on their backs and they
would _love_ that...  :-)

Neat question.  Actually somewhat parallel to the TSR Star Frontiers issue
of \'what do Vrusk sit on?\'  (the Vrusk being a 10 legged Insectoid race).
The illo\'s I\'ve seen show a long contoured \'bench.\'

Now the K\'kree are quite a different creature.  I\'d it\'d either be like a
comfy, high tech deer nest <the actual word escapes me at the moment>, maybe
on a raised dias.  Controls would be arranged around them, holographically
projected, along with some pylons around the perimeter.

For smaller workstations you\'d probably have the Vrusk style bench with
holographics displays to the sides and a cool instrumentation console ahead
(with a large HUD).

Stations would be arranged as per the functions.  Commo and Command in the
center, sensors fore, defenses and weapons around.  Pilot and astrogator
somewhere in the middle front.

It\'d probably look more like a restaurant than a bridge...

Conversely, I think \'Alien\' could be either 2300 or Traveller. Aliens is
2300, A^3 is err. Hmm

ISTR playing 2300 soon after seeing Aliens and it just clicked. I really
liked it. I was sad when I realised that T2300 and Trav where different
games.

Not necessarily, many small companies have Master craftsmen who did not
go the management route and are hourly employees.  One example: master
tool and die makers, normal promotion route,
1. apprentice machinist
2. journeyman machinist
3. senor journeyman machinist
4. apprentice tool & die maker
5. journeyman tool & die maker
6. senor journeyman tool & die maker
7. master tool & die maker

There should be otherjobs that require journeyman level skills before
allowing apprentice.

1) They need to have the weight taken off their limbs.  Unless they want to
rest on their back or side (awkward for controls), then then need to rest
on something along their bellies.  It should curve upward to cradles
their bodies with places for their legs.  The front problably has a place
to rest their upper bodies against unless they lay out flat.

I kind of like asteroid ships - must be those Saturday mornings wasted
watching _Jason of Star Command_ and _Space Academy_(?). :-)

IMTU, I don\'t allow a class discount on asteroid hulls. Each rock has
different centers of gravity, fracture lines, overall shape, etc., so
it
didn\'t seem appropriate that mass-production techniques would apply
as written. In some ways, each asteroid ship must be custom made.

Hey!  I have Jason of Star Command in MY Traveller Universe, so hands
off :-) thank you very much.  Actually I have a friend whose name is
Jason, and we were busy playing Traveller in \'79 when that show was on
TV.  We both liked the show, so it was a natural fit for my campaign. 
The Star Command IMTU ended up in one of the empty hexes spinward of
Tureded in a large grouping of asteroids.

I believe the rules in HG indicated that asteroid hulls didn\'t get a
volume discount for similar reasons to what you gave.  I don\'t have that
book with me here at work so I can\'t confirm that precisely.

so a possible conclusion is that a K\'kree acceleration couch might be the
otherway up?

IE like a contoured padded box on the ceiling with the K\'kree\'s upper
torso strapped to the vertical part and their lower torso strapped to
the horizontal bit.

Another reason why they don\'t like fighters.

For most K\'kree ships, I would assume that they either stand all the time
(like horses) or kneel down (like cattle). In the latter case, the panels
will be lower (ie normal human height) and there might be a padded area
for them to lie on.

I\'d go with the K\'kree not actually using acceleration couches to allow
higher G.

I don\'t think it is THAT grand but I have some hopes of making

Doing that. It will keep track of from world to world for each

Good point. I have the Cronor subsector done and am ready to move

This is a good plan of attack. Thanks for the advice on that. 
I feel energized. <g>
 
Thanks. I will keep the list posted and possibly post an intirim

Perhaps a bench that they straddle?  It could have a "back rest-like"
fitting that they back their rear-end up to, then "arm-rest-like" braces
that manually or automatically fold out from the bench (between the front
and back legs) that "braces" them from lateral movement, that may or maynot
have built-in controls/buttons/displays/etc.  I never imagined seatbelts on
a grave couch for some reason, so there would be no need to "buckle-up" with
one of these either?  Damn it!  Never had to think about it until now...
hope it helps??

I was reading Behind the Claw yesterday, and I have a question: how do you
get the background of your pictures to be fuzzy, while the foreground is
sharp? (eg. the starport bar scene). Do you draw two pictures, scan in and
"fuzz" the background and then overlay the foreground?

The other question arises from "Dead Meat" in the FT book: do you have
captions for all your pictures?

I think John means the one where the party is in London chasing a
(renegade?) Vargr, at the time of the Ripper killings. They have to avoid
undue attention of the local bobbies, at a time when *any* unusual activity
(even their own) is likely to be investigated. Is the Vargr the Ripper? Is
it someone else? Can the brave PC\'s find the Vargr before the police hunt
down the repoted "werewolf"? etc.

And no, I can\'t remember the issue number, either. Just that it was early.
Way before it became a lead miniatures catalog. Try asking Andy Slack (his
website is linked from my links page)!! Alternatively, there are a few
"Ultimate Guides to Traveller" on the \'Net that should list the article.

Jeff.

Do you have a copy of the MT Astrogator\'s Guide to Diaspora or the Hard Time\'s
adventure set in the Unity of Promise?  (Name eludes me)  Operation Vigilantie?
Or something like that.

Gimme a shout if you\'d like to learn about these.

>What about the toys of non-humans?  OK, we all expect young Vargr and
>Aslan to play with chew toys (well, so do very young humans, I guess).


I think that Aslan would have quite violent toys for their male children.
Toy pouch pistols and the like would be quite popular. I would imagine that
many of their games would be extremely active and physical. Some of their
toys would help to instill in their young the Aslan honor system and their
distinct gender roles.

Young females would probably be indoctrinated with... er... rather play with
things that would heighten their sense of numeracy (am I using the word
properly there?). Play money might be popular, for example. Counting games
might get more complex as the female children age. Toy computers and such
might also be quite popular.

Young males would be video game addicts. They\'d love the high-tech
equivlants of games like Quake and Robotron 2084. Fast-paced twitch style
games.

(I\'m already getting a very cool image of an group of Aslan computer game
fanatics, like the kids who make mods for first person shooters. The females
in the group do the coding and stuff along those lines, while the males work
on the art).

Vargr pups would undoubtedly be *extremely* fad oriented. One visit into
Vargr territory would reveal a totally different universe of toys than
another visit a few months later. I\'m imagining that the Vargr Extants would
be filled with young pups pulling on their mothers\' arms screaming "Buy me
this! Buy me this!" Once a popular kid got a toy, all of the other kids
around would absolutely *need* to have the same toy... to an extent. The
backlash would be brutal as a new kid rockets to popularity with different
toys. In literally days, Vargr toys might be red-tagged to bargain basement
prices.

I don\'t see why this would be the case. Baby dolls have been popular among
humans for ages. Despite the fact that dolls are often positively creepy,
they are still massively popular... and very few people liken them to the
corpses of babies, although they share similar characteristics to corpses.

It\'s possible, but I doubt it. I don\'t see the Droyne as a really big toy
culture. If anything, play would likely begin *after* they were casted.
Sports would be confronted with all manner of puzzles and various games of
skill and ingenuity, while other casts would be "trained" specifically
through the use of toys.

Of course there\'s the Vilani, Zhodani and a host of minor human races that
would play in different ways with different toys.

I think that high-tech toys would be *vastly* popular among all starfaring
races.

I have a few toys on my website under the "Culture" section. The link is

It\'s sort of a Rip van Winkle thing.  You\'re visiting the Great Pyramid,
get lost inside, fall asleep, and when you awake, you are in an auto-doc
in Cairo Arcopolis.  Or maybe you are driving in the Nevada desert to
meet a confidential informant when you are stopped by military
vehicles.  As you present your identification to the unpleasant, heavily
armed men wearing camouflage uniforms without insignia, a bright light
passes from east to west across the sky.  You feel queasy, but you\'re
not sure if it\'s the light or the presence of all of that firepower
without accountability.  They let you go and you turn back, but the road
is all bumpy and overgrown now.  Later you meet the bewildered Area 51
perimeter team in the ghost town that used to be Lovelock, wondering
what happened to all of the roads and what are all of those little boxy
things flying silently overhead?

I haven\'t done that, but in my Traveller universe, the Roswell incident
involved a Vilani ship.  I haven\'t decided whom to blame for Tunguska. 
Vilani? Hivers? Droyne?

20 years ago today ... certainly not 25.  It was released in 1979.  I
remember it well as the only movie that my then-girlfriend stayed awake
all the way through.  (She said that movies and tv sort of hypnotized
her and she fell right to sleep.)

I think it\'s more like:
"Hey Lieutenant, are we seeing real action against an opposing army, or
is this just another bug hunt?"
"There may be a xenomorph involved."
"A what?"
"A xenomorph, an alien life form."
[chorus] "Bug hunt!"

Of course, my favorite line isn\'t suitable for a family mailing list. 
It\'s the exchange between Vasquez and I think Hicks that ends, "Anywhere

I disagree, and this is the kind of nagging mercenary mindset that alot of
folks still associate with Traveller and old school Dungeons & Dragons (and
roleplaying in general).

I\'m not fond of using money as a scorecard in my roleplaying games. It
usually works better as a McGuffin than anything else, at least in my
opinion. Cash counting just seems so mundane in a world of science-fiction
adventure. In my opinion money works best when its general and vague to some
extent. I don\'t like to keep track of every purchase my PCs make (well, you
took the informant out for dinner, and that was a total of Cr120 plus a 20%
gratuity), and I don\'t expect them to do it either.

Then again, my players seem to enjoy adventure and excitement more than the
monetary rewards they receive as a result.

I also try to be inventive with rewards as well. When my players worked for
InterstellArms, they often received as much as 80% of their payment in
stocks. I kept track of the growth and decline of the stocks behind the
scenes. Sometimes they\'d get paid in material, maybe a prototype piece of
equipment, a laser turret for their scout, stuff like that.

My players seem to find that information is just about the best reward.

  OK, one or two works per million probably is too few: make it
on the order of one per hundred thousand or so. I probably do
need the "major works" category.
  I don\'t have my demographic information at hand, but the county
where I live has about 250 thousand population, and between one
and three employers that qualify as "works".  The local
university employs over 10,000 people, but over half of them are
part-time student help.  Reduce that to full time equivalents and
it just misses being a major works.  The local steel mill could
still qualify as a works, since it had over 2000 employees before it 
laid off 30% of its workforce this last year.
   Improved technology will probably reduce the number of people
and the size of plants or works of any given type, but this may
be countered by the tendency to create new types for the more
complex equipment and systems introduced at the higher TL.

I think you are right. 

Put the control area in the center of the big domed ship, surrounded
by simulated pasture land, with several couches for the "bridge
crew" to kneel on, and control units built into simulated rocks and
bushes.  The rest of the herd can wander in and out of the area and
keeping the crew company.  I suspect they\'d put a "water hole" in
that area too.  

Standing in this control area would look like you were standing in
the middle of a pasture surrounded by hills or plains.  It would
look nothing like the inside of a human/vargr or even aslan ship.

Don\'t you picture a K\'Kree ship that way? ;->

What makes you think they sit at all?  I think the K\'Kree spend
virtually their entire lives standing, except when rolling on their
backs for exercise or to relax those muscles.  So they wouldn\'t have
acceleration couches at all.  Rather, they would have very good gravitic
compensators to make sure they didn\'t feel any acceleration.  

They might have pads under their bodies on which they could rest to take
some weight off their legs.

I think the same would be true of the Virushi.

	The plot of Isaac Asimov\'s "Pebble in the Sky" has an ordinary person

He merely crosses a stray beam from the experiment and finds himself in a

At the time Aliens came out *most* of the audience had never *heard* of
Starship Troopers, so I wondered what they might have thought this line

	All the turn-over figures I\'m aware of are ratios (eg. sales/inventory).  I\'m guessing 
what you really mean is revenue, which is how much money a company takes in.  In that case, I\'d 
imagine that a sector-wide shipping company could easily have revenue on the order of MCr1,000s.  
If you look at the expenses for an average freighter(~3,000dtons) and multiply that times the 
dozens of ships (at least) such a company would have MCr1,000s seems reasonable.  Really big 
companies could be several orders of magnitudes larger than this and for megacorps the sky is 
the limit.
	Note that this money will be tied up in on-going business concerns and spread all over so 
the resources a company could muster locally on short notice could be much more limited.  This 
is a good thing because it means that they might be desperate enough to do something like hire 
PCs or might not have the resources immediately available to crush the PCs like the bugs they 
are :-)

Wow. I\'m actually qualified to answer this one. When I saw Aliens I had
heard of the book Starship Troopers, but pretty much only knew it introduced
powered armor into the science-fiction world. I knew nothing of bugs or
other creatures.

However, when I heard the line, I imagined that the Colonial Marines were
frequently called out to protect colonists from all manner of different
nasty situations. I figured that sometimes they\'d fight armed insurgents who
were rising up against corporate oppression. However, I figured that most of
the time they\'d be whisked across space to hunt down some sort of dangerous
or semi-dangerous critters that happened to be menacing local colonists.
These "xenomorphs," no matter how dangerous, were never a match for them in
anyy way.

Whenever I hear that line, I still imagine the marines slogging through
dense jungle cursing the candy-assed colonists while looking for a dragonfly
with a wingspan of a meter or so. I imagined when they asked if it would be
a stand-up fight, they were thinking more of guerillas and such.

I\'m not sure that it works as a Starship Troopers reference because...
well... Heinlein\'s bugs are pretty damned dangerous and would probably fall
into the stand-up fight category. Of course, your own mileage may vary.

Sorry, I wasn\'t very clear.  The K\'Kree, being extreme vegetarians,
might find stuffed animals and dolls too corpselike and creepy.  Vargr
and Aslan and other carnivorous or omnivorous mammalians would probably
have dolls and stuffed animals, which are pleasant for a juvenile to
hold.

I\'ll have to check out your web site.

Money details can sometimes add a lot of atmosphere and opportunities
for role-playing, but I don\'t find money itself to be a good reward for
players.  Rather, Chris\'s statement seems in general to hold true for my
players (or myself as a player):

>"fuzz" the background and then overlay the foreground?

Yep, all my illustrations are drawn in ink on paper, then scanned and
manipulated in Photoshop on my trusty Mac. In the case of the starport bar,
I planned from the outset to fuzz the background, so to simplify things I
drew it separately. I selected the window areas, pasted in the background,
then used the Gaussian Blur filter to make it seem out of focus. I also use
Photoshop to clean up the inks, overlay a haze of smoke, put in lens
flares, gradiant fills, or whatever other effects I need. When the illos
are finished, I send \'em to Loren by e-mail.

I\'d only begun using Photoshop on my illustrations with these GURPS books,
so I was still learning new tricks with Behind the Claw. The bar picture is
a particularly elaborate case of Photoshopping: the three Vargr were also
drawn as a separate element and dropped over the rest; the middle distance
is just slightly blurred while the far distance (outside the windows) is
blurred more; the "Iskendur\'s Red Zone" sign was drawn black-on-white but
then Reversed and blurred (to make it glow like neon); the text on the
video screens is actual text -- dropped in and distorted to give it the
proper perspective -- listing departures for various systems in the Regina
subsector(!); and the Vargr\'s Imperial Sunburst insignia were dropped in as
well.

I used tons of Photoshopped text in the first G:T book. The \'holographic
display\' text, various computer screens, the security doors behind the
Naval Guards. I actually created two "alien" typefaces just for this
purpose -- actually I simply took two existing fonts into Fontographer,
then chopped up and modified each letter (one of the fonts was originally
Crillee, the "ST:NG" font;). If you\'re really crazy, you can take a
magnifying glass and try to transliterate those screens -- they\'re mostly
full of lyrics from various punk songs that happened to be on my CD player
while I was drawing ;) Bits of Buzzcocks, Ramones, and NoMeansNo lyrics, to
be precise.

Sometimes I use Photoshop to move, flip, rotate, stretch, or re-size parts
of a drawing, or even re-draw whole figures -- much easier now that I have
a Wacom ArtPad tablet and stylus. Incredibly, the drawings in G:T, BTC, and
Alien Races 1 were all Photoshopped using the mouse!

>The other question arises from "Dead Meat" in the FT book: do you have
>captions for all your pictures?

Did they put that caption under it? (I still don\'t have my copies of the
book! Loren has been slow getting my copies to me, and recently a courier
shipment disappeared en route...)

All of my illos have filenames, of course, and the
butcher-with-K\'kree-warrior drawing happened to be called "Dead Meat".  I
have a pretty free hand to make up subjects for illos. So naturally I\'m
drawing lots of gags. "Dead Meat" is a favourite, and I\'m very happy with a
couple from First In.

Thanks for paying such close attention to my work!

I think it is just after the Millenium Falcon clamps itself to the
Star Destroyer and the Imperials can\'t find it.

The Star Destroyer\'s captain mutters something about small ships not
having a cloacking device and DV decides the second in command needs
a development opportunity.

I disagree with your disagree.

The point is that a "proper" Traveller PC group would use the money
to upgrade their ship\'s computer, replace the laser turrret with
dual fusion beams and buy FGMP-15s.

Then they\'d go and "Nuke" Jabba.

It\'s not like D&D where you need the cash for experience, so the PCs
either hand it over to buy training or go to sleep on piles of the stuff.

In Traveller, you either need the money to pay the bills, or to buy
the nice toys that make the next adventure so dangerous...
to NPCs and the infrastructure. :-)

Personally, I like the Shadowrun system, where you have a lifestyle cost
(eg cross off 5k each month or eventually you get kicked out of your
 apartment, your car reposessed and your middle class friends stop talking
 to you.)
That way you don\'t have to keep track of every can of soft drink they buy
from the local store.

However, finding the money to replace a broken jump drive...

	It\'s funny, but I thought that they used "bug hunt" as a synonym for 
"wild goose chase", i.e., everytime they had gone on a "bug hunt" there 
turned out to be no real "bug" to hunt.  That\'s why they were really 
surprised by finding real "bugs" this time.

	My point was rather, that they can actually BUY something with the 
money.  If you give them money and take it away or don\'t let them buy 
anything, then it isn\'t a motivator.    If you play a Star Trek style game 
with everyone in active service in the Navy or Scouts, then no money is not 
going to have much impact, but yuck, who needs that.
	As Steve jackson games has pointed out, the two most popular sorts of 
Traveller campaigns are MERChants and MERCenaries (notice the same root, 
refering to comMERCe).   To me both of these .games are interesting because 
the players do actually have to make a living, watch their expenses, plan 
ahead in order to make the bank payments, or improve the quality of their 
unit equipment and recruits.  Money isn\'t the goal, but is the measure used 
for them to move their enterprise along.   These sort of games are to me what 
separates Traveller from other RPG\'s and what I find appealing about the 
game. (I mean we don\'t know how expensive the Starship Enterprise is, but we 
sure know the bank payment on a Beowulf free trader).
	While in D&D players end up with huge piles of cash lying around, 
without much for them to buy, in Traveller you can never have too much money. 
 There is always an improvement to the ship, new set of combat armor for the 
third squad etc, that\'s just out of reach.   This again, is different than 
most movies and TV shows, where the underlying infrastructure (redundant, 
can\'t have an overlying infrastructure or underlying super structure) remains 
the same.  Most of the time if something changes in a show or movie, it\'s 
serves a cute plot point or cast change, not as an actual developement of  
the action.

This is pretty much the take I had on the reference too, thanks, you put it
into the words I couldn\'t scratch-up.  Using 20-20 hindsight, I can see a
kind of reference to the ST bugs, but as you say, these bugs (the ST ones)
are not the kind one would snidely remark "It\'s a bug hunt" about IMHO...
I\'d go as far as saying, if it were a reference to ST, that the quote should
have been, "Bug hunt!  Oh f@#k ME!!!!!"  :^)

White Dwarf again, number in the high thirties. Non standard Traveller

I think it was called Green Horizon, but I am not sure.

The PCs in the adventure where aliens and looked like gnomes of Norse myth.
The heavy water (Deuterium for the p-plant?) was of course up in the
Telemarken where it was being readied for transport to the German atomic
bomb program. In reallife(tm) the allies tried bombing the plant and when
the germans tried shipping a couple of railroad cars full of heavy water
the Norse resistance blew the ferry up and sank it. Thus no atombomb for mr
Adolf.

What\'s wrong with that? I run a campaign in which the PCs are a group of
IISS scouts, and they\'re having a great time of it. Of course, the PCs
are part of an ultra-secret intelligence unit within the IISS who pretty
much have carte blanche to do what\'s necessary when the security of the
Imperium is threatened. Which means they get to travel more or less where
they want (with the odd assignment tossed their way), they don\'t have to
worry about expenses (the IISS takes care of it), and they get to shoot
things: drug dealers, the stormtroopers of a local dictator, terrorists...

The Empire Strikes Back. Captain Needa is the unfortunate commander of the
ISD _Avenger_, which loses track of the _Millenium Falcon_ while pursuing
it out of the asteroid field.

Captain Needa: "Track them! They may come around for another pass."
Sensor Operator: "Captain Needa, the ship no longer appears on our scopes!"
Needa: "They can\'t have disappeared," to First Officer "no ship that small
   has a cloaking device."
Sensor Operator: "Well, there\'s no trace of them sir."
Communication Officer: "Captain, Lord Vader demands an update on the pursuit."

Dramatic pause.

Needa, to First Officer: "Get a shuttle ready. I shall go explain our
   situation, and apologize to Lord Vader for losing them. In the meantime,
   continue to scan the area."
First Officer: "Yes, Captain Needa."

The next time we see Captain Needa (a few scenes later) he is gasping his
last breath out while Darth Vader uses the Force to strangle him.

Vader: "Apology accepted, Captain Needa."

Advancement in the upper management levels of the Imperial Starfleet is
pretty quick.

Lucan didn\'t have the Force, but any number of high tech tortures work just
as well . . .

Of course you read it, it\'s a *book* (and only a book when Aliens came
out). I presume a high percentage of the TML has read it. That wasn\'t the
point of my statement above - I was referring to *most* of the audience,
not to the small percentage of hard core science fiction readers.

	the enemy will have moved -36 km, and the missile will have
	moved -21,564 km and reached a velocity of -72,000 m/s. The

A case could be made -- and has been made -- that he blew his money on
upgrades for the Millenium Falcon (adding such things as chrome handlebars
and such). See

http://www.synicon.com.au/sw/mf/

for an entirely too in-depth view of all aspects of the Millenium Falcon
(and some pretty kewl deckplans that may or may not be of use in a
Traveller campaign).

It is true that money is a story element in movies and is handled
differently in RPGs. This has to do with the fundamental differences
between movies and RPGs, though (story telling v. shared story creation).

Actually, for the record the gold=experience thing has been gone from the
AD&D rules for 10 years now (since the printing of AD&D 2nd edition).

I don\'t know. I\'ve found ultimately that the toys are secondary. Then again,
I don\'t run combat heavy games...

That\'s almost what I\'m talking about. Money gets moved to the background.

That\'s fine, and frankly that sounds more to me like a McGuffin than simply
just chasing after money.

I wasn\'t sure it wasn\'t me, I use Netscape 4.60 and it sometimes doesn\'t
load pages unless you hit RELOAD several times.  No idea why it does
this.  Since the AOL buy out, its gotten more and more buggy.

If we\'ll recall, Han was preparing the Falcon for departure from Hoth at the
beginning of Empire to go pay Jabba off.  (I believe it was a discussion
between him and Luke and involved a quote about "there\'s a price on my
head".)  Of course, he was a little side-tracked, and by the time he got
things under control again, Jabba was in no condition to demand payment. 

One could then presume that he gave all of his money back to the Rebellion.
Or maybe he didn\'t... things didn\'t settle down enough to see what he might
do with it before the end of Jedi. 

What it comes down to is, Han never had a chance to spend the money that we
saw.  We don\'t know what he did with it, but there\'s no more evidence for
either spending or not spending.

This has always been a failing in Book 8, although the prices and weights
quickly add up to limit your robot.

In general, the best way to interpret the entries is to get Megatraveller
and crosswalk whatever item you are looking at to the equivalent item iin
the Referee\'s Manual (most stuff is there).  For those which are not in
that other reference (or in the Imperial Encyclopedia, which has general
equipment and weapons) use the weight in kilograms as volume in liters, or,
in certain cases, treat the volume as negligable (i.e. visual sensors which
arent active, audio sensors, memory & CPU, add em all up and consume 1
liter)

And remember this miniaturization rule of Thumb (Stolen from Jo Grant);
Anything (within reason) can be made half the volume (or weight, but not
both) for ten times the cost.  This can be done once for each TL above
introduction of the item (so at the exact TL, no miniaturization is
possible).  This is a special order, so may take time to build.  Apply this
with common sense, as with all things.

That was where I misunderstood you - I thought you said the missle
was _launched_ at 12Gs, not that it had an acceleration of 12Gs.
(In other words, I thought IYTU it was only accelerated by the 
launcher)

Um... hmm... er... well, I guess you could get a copy of White Dwarf #62.
Or borrow one.  Or ask Andy Slack about who Jae Campbell is and if there is
a source for his Traveller articles on the web (Andy has posted his own).
There must be other options, but for some reason I can\'t seem to think of
any at this very moment while I\'m typing this very public e-mail message.

	It depends.   Money is a McGuffin when the GM says, oh, by the way 
your Jump Drive\'s broken and you\'ve got to fix it.   This is "story-telling" 
type gaming (or Railroading).   Money is not a McGuffin when the PC\'s ship 
has its Jump Drive damaged by Pirates (although this is of course impossible) 
from either a plannned or random encounter, through regular use of the combat 
system.  I much prefer it when the game provokes the story rather than the 
story leads the game, which is why I like the economic aspect of Traveller so 
much.

This is exactly my original point.   Money in movies is just a McGuffin, used 
to set Han Solo\'s character into the fray, but the minute it is no longer 
needed as such it is dropped.   In Traveller, that money continues to be 
important, since it can be used to upgrade the PC\'s footing.      In Sci-Fi 
movies, nobody hads to worry about making a living, but in Trav they do.   
I\'ve always fantasized about a Trav-based TV show, where the mortage on a 
Free Trader had to be paid by the end of each episode, I think\'d be 
entertaining and fun to follow. (might teach a few people about money and 
business as well----not that I\'m an expert)

To the contrary, Starship Troopers had been published some twenty years
before, and had been in print more or less continuously ever since. 
It\'s a pretty popular piece of classic science fiction and was very well
known to the audience of the mid-1980s.

I stand corrected.  As soon as you mentioned it, I remembered the
article and illustration.  It\'s an interview with a K\'Kree ambassador,
and ends with the interviewer being rudely escorted out after feeling
(and thus giving off the odor of) fear when the ambassador casually
describes killing a human woman and child with his feet during a
battle.  ("To conserve ammunition, we killed them with our feet.")

So that\'s a good source for seating for the starship bridge.

Lucan, if anyone, would be playing a Darth Vader-like role in conquering
the Imperium, and would strive for dramatic and supernatural effects
(probably achieved through technology rather than psionics).  The
prevailing attitude toward psionics in the Third Imperium would make him
even more frightening, and Lucan was certainly a follower of
Machiavelli\'s principle that it is better for a ruler to be feared than
loved.  

How might he have achieved the Captain Needa Apology Effect?

They\'ll also give the 10% discount if you\'re a writer in the game field.
After Far Trader, I get the discount there.  But no discount if you use
a credit card, and no checks.

They carry a medium amount of Gurps stuff.  The other day they
had 3 copies of First In, 2 of Far Trader, 2 of Traveller.  I\'ve
never seen Star Mercs or Aliens I there.

That was long before he had the power and resources of the Iridium
Throne. 

His actions that day were simply the snap evaluation of the situation,
and the immediate execution of a pragmatic plan to get him into power.

While clearly a sociopathic fratricide and regicide (after all,
unconfirmed or not, Varian _was_ emperor when he was killed) Lucan, from
the description, was quite cool and collected when he shot everyone in
that room. 

He decided that he could simply finish what Dulinor\'s goons had started,
cover himself in glory for the "heroic, though tragically unsuccessful"
(as the newsmedia would put it) attempt to drive off the assassins, and
grab the throne for himself.

Once in power he would take pains to make himself seem unreachable by
assasins bullets...to enance his standing as the One True Leader of the
Imperium.

As to how, that\'s a good question...I would guess that he had some
trained psions on staff, carefully kept on leash by some means. (feed
them a poison in their daily diet, for which you dole out a daily dose
of the antidote. If they displease you, you give them a sugar pill
instead of the true antidote.)

I read a statement similar to this in one of the GT books.  You know... I\'m
not sure if I should find this statement frightning like I did when I first
read it or if I should find it hilarious like my players did when they read
it.

I have been running a very successful set of Traveller games here in the
Chattanooga, Tennessee area on and off since 1985.  I started off when I was
15, running a group of adventurers through lots of simple " dungeon-crawl "
style adventures.  It was very popular and a great deal of fun, but was
simple by most of my standards today.

Later in college (1988) in Athens, GA , I took up a different campaign in
the early Rebellion years.  It consisted of a group of 5 college friends and
one of the orginal group from above.  It was made more sophisticated than
the first game with more character development.  The basic plot was that the
characters had helped rescue James Windhook from the assassination and was
generall in hiding along the war front of the Solomani/Imperial border.
This lasted until 1991 and again was quite popular.

When I got back to Chattanooga (1992), I was asked to join a game at a local
hobby store ( now defunct ) that was an ongoing merchant campaign.  I played
in this for almost 6 months ( once a week, Monday nights at the store )
before I had almost lost all of my hair because I pulled most of it out in
sheer boredom.  The game consisted of the GM and the Captain of the ship
going over figures and counting the money they were making.  Then they would
figure out how to make more money by changing trade routes or what materials
would make more money in which starport, etc.  This was by far the most
boring experience I have ever had.  When I asked the other players about it,
I found quickly that they were mainly playing out of friendship to the GM
and they were more bored than I was.

After that game went belly-up, I was asked to run a game of Traveller there.
After much convincing ( I was afraid they wanted me to run another game like
the above one ), I finally relented and ran a very Star Warsish game set in
the Rebellion.  I ran this game for a year and a half and it was so popular
that I finally cut the group off at the high mark of 19 players, usually
with at least 10 to 15 watchers watching the game.

Since then, I have ran several more games for basicly that group ( minus a
few, add a few ).  I\'ve ran them as criminals, scouts, active Navy, active
Marines, active RC, active Domain of Deneb.  I ran the Arrival Vengeance
campaign for quite a while ( ok... I added a lot to the basic campaign ).
We have been, and are still having, a blast. :)  Currently, I\'m running an
active Navy campaign in the Fifth Frontier War ( using Full Thrust rules ).

Since 1992, we had one more game ran by the same GM as ran the boring game
above.  It came to be known as " UPS in Spaaaaaaaace " by the group.  It
rivalled heavily the boredom experienced in the first game and lasted for
three weeks.  So both myself and my group have a heavy bias against Merchant
games.

As for the Mercenary end, that same above GM of boredom suggested that we
try a mercenary campaign.  We all decided that maybe this was his chance to
shine, and after all, he was our friend.  We all showed up, expecting to be
part of a rollicking Merc company.  We got to the starport and he told us we
had no ship, no weapons, no other mercenaries than the four of us that had
decided to play.  We had the clothes on our backs.  We\'d just have to make
some money to build that company.

Two of them got up and walked out of the store in disgust.  Two of us stayed
and talked it over with him.  He just couldnt understand why we didnt like
his concept.  My friend replied merely this:

"  How many people would want to see a movie where Indiana Jones spent all
his time in the humdrum world of going to college to get his degree?  No
one.  Everyone wants to see, and in this case play, someone who is there.
Someone who is out adventuring.  Someone who is chasing after the Ark, The
Holy Rocks, The Grail.  No one wants to be a real life student in a
role-playing game. "

He refused to ever run another game again.  Frankly, no one misses them.

I\'m sorry this is long, but I feel that there are probably others out there
who feel like me.  I just dont understand the excitment of being a merchant.
I dont understand why anyone would want to play a game of book balancing.

Just my .02 credits worth.

Good point. I\'m not as familiar with such trades. Experienced and 
highly skilled hourly tradesmen such as T&D makers should indeed 
qualify for corporate E5-E7 ranks. These should still have supervisory and
training roles over those in the same trade, but not the wider
focus that a manager needs to have.

A merchant game doesn\'t have to be about book keeping... and probably
shouldn\'t be.  Go read CJ Cherryh\'s Chanur series (Pride of Chanur, Chanur\'s
Venture, The Kif Strike Back ("Never, ever joke about titles: your publisher
may use one" - CJ Cherryh), Chanur\'s Homecoming and Chanur\'s Legacy.)
You\'ll find the Hani to be much like Aslan, and the Kif are Vargr-like in
their society, but even more so.  (Though they aren\'t dog-men and are
distinctly different... but they\'ve got this concept of \'sfik\' which is much
like Vargr charisma, but scarier because there aren\'t any "nice" Kif.)  

The Chanur are a Hani clan, and the main characters are the female crew of
the Pride of Chanur, their clans trading vessel.  And despite being free
traders, the crew of the Pride get involved in adventures worthy of any
mercenary.  It\'s one of my favorite SF series, and is what my upcoming
Traveller campaign is based on. 

The key to the free trader campaign is to remember this:  the best money is
to be made on cargoes that people are in a hurry to move, quietly, and no
questions asked.  They don\'t even have to be illegal cargoes.  Picking up
mysterious cargoes, even when you know they\'re on the up-and-up, are
wonderful hooks into adventures when somebody else wants that cargo, or
wants to stop its delivery, or just wants to cause trouble for the owner for
some reason.  

One thing to watch out for... free trader campaigns can turn political.  If
you don\'t like politics, you have to be careful how you handle it.
(Pyanfar\'s (Captain of the Pride) motto is, when confronted with vastly
intelligent, aggressive politics: Do something totally irrational and let
the enemy
think himself to death.)

One of the things I like about the net is that if any of the players *do*
want to play with the day-to-day business of making money, we can do that in
email and not waste real game time figuring out how to pay the bills. 

(Huh... I\'m going to have to go read these again over the holiday weekend.
Get me all fired up for my new campaign.) 

When you\'re done with those, jump over to her Alliance-Union books...
they\'re set in the same universe, but very, very far apart.  (One of the
characters in the Chanur series is a "lost" human... the first to ever
contact the alien races.)  A-U is an all-human affair (as I recall) but it\'s
very Traveller-like, IMO.   One set of books is referred to as the
"Merchanter Novels", which are "trading ships and commerce after the Company
Wars."  If Cherryh can write books about merchant ships and make them fun, I
don\'t see why we can\'t play merchanter games and do the same. 

Some of her books have won Hugo\'s and Pride of Chanur was nominated for one.
If you\'ve never read any of her work, I recommend doing so.  Good stuff. 
http://www.cherryh.com

(And it\'s pronounced "cherry".  Her parents and brother don\'t have the \'h\'.
Seems it offended her sensibilities to be a woman named "cherry".)

The players were interested in being merchants, and I was between
prepared scenaria, so I let them have their head and do some
"clean" trading for a session or two.  However, just to annoy
them with respect to the bookkeeping, I required them to manage
their money in the local currency on the planet that they were on
that session.  Then, I gave them a _really_ nasty currency to
deal with:

The local "Ringal" traded (that week) at par with the Imperial
Credit.  However, prices are quoted in combinations of any of the
following units (plurals in parens):

Tal   (Tals)  at 20 to the Ringal
Pan   (Pyn)   at 12 to the Tal
Ruub  (Ryben) at 4 to the Pan

Pay   (Pays)  at 13 Tal 4 Pyn
Skad  (Skuud) at 21 Tal
Corn  (Kyrn)  at 5 Tal

Grain (Grain) at 4 Pyn

There were also three units with the same name, Fal (Fyl), but
different values.  Which value was meant depended on the
conditions of the transaction:

1 Fal at 2 Tal: (sometimes called the "Lesser Fal")
     Purchases of foodstuffs from vendors not holding a Royal
     Warrant

1 Fal at 6 Tal: (sometimes called the "Greater Fal")
     Purchases of non-foodstuffs from vendors not holding a Royal
     Warrant

1 Fal at 6 Tal 8 Pyn: (sometimes called the "Royal Fal")
     All purchases from vendors holding a Royal Warrant.

Royal Warrants were specifically set up to generate money for the
Crown - the only thing that they got the holder was the right to
use the 6T8P Fal as a pricing unit.  They had to be renewed each
year, and they were quite costly.  The reason that the Fal was
used locally at all was to make it easier for local merchants to
do "triple-entry bookkeeping".  Tax enforcement was pretty lax,
as long as the Crown made budget each year.  If the Crown ever
decided to crack down, the Fal would disappear like a snowflake
in hell.

Merchants would quote prices in all sorts of interesting
combinations of these units, and the players would have to keep
their books straight, because the merchants weren\'t interested in
much more than fleecing the offworlders.

"Half skad a pay two ryben, yer change is a grain" was a typical
price for something like, perhaps, a large tankard of beer in a
local tavern.

	Oh God, sounds horrible.   But you can have intensely boring 
experiences in "cinematic" roleplaying experiences as well.  There was one 
game I played in where the referee was so taken with his plotline and story

talk, talk, talk.   It was get on the railroad or else.   "No, you don\'t want

talk to the butler in the garden!"  Finally I had my character bash in the 
head of another character with a lead pipe,  His dying words were "God bless 
you."

The reason you didn\'t like the Merchant games was because the GM was a
lousy GM. A GM has to balance his gaming interests with the players.
Clearly the GM, and the Ship\'s Captain player were having fun; it\'s up
to the players to tell the GM that it\'s not fun for them. 

It doesn\'t mean that that genre of campaign is boring.

Check out the BITS Web site.  There\'s a downloadable file there (in PDF

speaking from much first hand experience when it came to merchants.    I\'ve 
almost always run Mercenary games and most oftne wanted to play in mercenary

merchant games is that everybody in the party can really join in the fun.   
Compare Merchant and Mercenary "jobs" for PC\'s:
	
	1)  The Captain:
	Mercenary:  gives orders, buys stuff,  BLOWS STUFF UP
	Merchant:   gives orders, buys stuff,  does the books.

	2)  Engineer:
	Mercenary:  lays mines, sets traps,  BLOWS UP BUILDINGS
	Merchant:  fixes old pipe fittings

	3) Doctor
	Mercenary:  patches sucking wounds
	Merchant:  hands out space-sickness pills, chucks out dead Low 
Passengers

	4) Executive Officer
	Mercenary:  somewhere the Captain isn\'t, BLOWS STUFF UP
	Merchant:  repeats Captain\'s orders in loud voice
	
	5) Shuttle Pilot
	Mercenary: dodges missiles, uses beam laser to BLOW STUFF UP
	Merchant: dodges port inspector, uses hand cart to unload stuff

	6) Ordinary Guy
	Mercenary: fires rifle, throws grenades, BLOWS STUFF UP
	Merchant: cleans up passenger puke, moves boxes around.

So I can see why the guy was bored to death in his merchant game, maybe he 
should have waited a bit on the merc game.

It\'s too bad that was your experience with a "merchant" game.  It
isn\'t mine, not anywhere near what I would call a merchant game.  

Most of the games I have run over the years fall into the merchant
game category.  At least, the players are, or are attempting to be,
crew of a ship engaged in trade.  From your description, I think
that, might be, the only part of your experience that would match up
with mine...or my players...I HOPE!  ;->

In every game, I try to use everything in the environment as an
invitation to adventure.  It\'s not the bookeeping part of trade that
is exciting, but that\'s just a tiny part of what is happening around
the characters engaged in trade.

They have to find a cargo, and finding a cargo isn\'t a matter of
consulting a table, it\'s interacting with brokers, factors, and
crooks, labor unionists, and government agents, and competing with
other groups for the same cargos.  None of the players (and most
assuredly none of the characters) have access to tables or charts
that tell them what to buy here and sell there, they have to find
that out themselves.  That means getting out onto the planet and
meeting people and finding out what they want to buy and have to
sell...and just when they think they have it figured out "things
change."  ;->

Shipping a cargo (and carrying passengers) isn\'t a "dead week in
space", it\'s dealing with gamblers, hijackers, run away lovers (and
children), cargos that "get loose."  And yes I have...um...ethically
challenged groups for them to encounter as well, along with customs
agents and corrupt officials, and honest ones too.

Selling the cargo is more of the same...and I haven\'t even gotten to
all the *other* things that happen when interesting people get a
chance to travel and see interesting things while in new places.

So, the PC\'s are spending downtime in a port...that doesn\'t mean
rolling some dice to see how much repairs will cost and how long it
will take.  In one of my games it\'s finding parts and people with
the skills to do the maintenance or repairs.  It\'s *also* meeting
people in bars, cafes, libraries, even on the street that want the
PC\'s to "deliver a letter", "protect me from those thugs", "find my
missing son", "liberate us from that evil empire..." ;->

Ok, it isn\'t always *that* obvious, but any adventure could show up
in front of my erst-while merchants...ANYTHING!  They don\'t have to
take the bait, but if they turn this one down there will be another
one coming along tomorrow.  And my back-story keeps playing out, so
what they turned down today might come back and *insist* on their
attention later.  ;->

To ME that\'s a "merchant game!"

BTW, I *really* don\'t have a problem with a "four guys just
mustering out and looking for adventure" scenario.  They go to the
Starport hiring hall and look for an employer, finding several
prospects.  They investigate the prospects and meet with a potential
employer in the Ubiquitous Bar and find out what he/she wants them
to do. 

A. They take the job and an adventure begins...

B. They turn the job down, but when they leave the bar a kid being
chased by K\'Kree bowls into them and begs them to help him.  They
do, and that leads to...
  
    1.  Fighting the K\'Kree or
    
    2.  Hiding the kid and fast talking the K\'Kree
    
.Later the Kid tells them why the "Cows" were after him and leads
them to "a patron" with a job offer.  If they take it, the adventure
begins...

C. I\'ll let you think this one up. ;-> 

See what I mean?  Anything can lead to adventure, and adventure
leads to fun.  It\'s the GM\'s job to give the players an opportunity
to go looking for the adventure, it\'s the players job to put their
characters in the adventures way, and it\'s everybodies job to make
the most of it when they find it.

At least that\'s my opinion.

The Captain tells his 2IC to take over, and to prepare a shuttle so he can
apologise to Lord Vader personally. Next scene with him has him choking on
the floor at Vader\'s feet, then collapsing. Vader then says the quote and
walks off as the body (?) is taken away.

Survival Margin has a section on what happened in the prince\'s quarters
in the Palace that day. Dulinor\'s men burst in and shot the place up but
were killed by the bodyguards in the room, leaving a shaken Lucan,
Varian, their consorts, their body guards and a junior INI officer
standing there. Amidst the general \'Holy sh*T what\'s happening\' Lucan
calmly picked up an smg and shot everyone else. 

The INI officer managed to boogie out before he was shot. He also
managed to get his sorry doomed butt onto a fast courier leaving the
palace, and, as the story went \'used all of his skills, talents,
resources and favors\' getting to the Solomani Rim, out of Lucan\'s reach.

Lucan promptly spread the story that this officer (last name Windhook,
IIRC) had been in on the assasination plot. Windhook is the only other
living person who knows what happened in that room that day. It sure
sounded like that came straight from someone\'s campaign...that\'s exactly
what a PC would do.

Cleon the Mad = Caligula, certainly. Lucan, I don\'t know. While the
original Tricky Dick did kill the boy Princes, I see Lucan as less like
him and more of a Macbeth figure ...woefully unprepared for the mantle
of Empire, and progressively more psychotic as time went on, as the
pressures of the war and his consience wore on him. Exact literary
comparisons are difficult at best.

the Doc to do).  In her spare time she finds time to doing research

boxes and in those swamps, marshes and mountain peaks where he
always seems to find himself.  Also happens to be an archaeologist
who travels with the crew mainly so he can look for and investigate
ancient sites.  Strange how they often show up in those swamps,
marshes and on mountain peaks.  ;->

With *that* GM, he would have been bored in ANY game, I\'m afraid.

I think the Chanur series is the best source for understanding the
female Aslan point of view, and make sure that anyone wanting to play an
Aslan in my games read this series.

Both the Chanur series and the U-A series are good background material
for a merchant campaign.  as is the Solar Queen series by Andre Norton.

I\'ll have to stick my 0.02 cr in here. Eris\' PBEM is one of the best
games I\'ve ever played in, and it\'s (roughly) a mechant based game. (we
will, too, Eris if we _ever_ get ahold of that damn ship!)

Plenty of excitement and action, and my character, in roughly two years
of playing (oh lordy, it _has_ been that long!! I just looked at
Ricardo\'s original character sheet, it\'s dated 5/16/97) has fired his
weapon for the first time just this week.

It hasn\'t _seemed_ like two years...but Eris is right, we haven\'t spent
much time at all on book keeping!

successful first session of my Mercantile campaign, I\'ll toss a couple of
points in.

In my opinion, routine merchant operations really is boring, unless you
like accountancy.

What I find interesting is developing markets, and long-haul, high risk
trade. Go rent \'Smokey and the Bandit\'. Get a book out about the history of
the British East India Company, or the Silk Route through Turkestan, or the
Spice Trade. Read a history of Hawkins in the Caribbean - he actually spent
more time trading with Spanish colonies than raiding them.

You want risk, fun, politics, and stuff like that. Plus the odd gunfight -
we never said piracy was impossible. We said piracy around mainworlds with
signifigant trade or economies was next to impossible. But if you want to
try and make money by trading with those tiny, desperate mining colonies in
the Outsystem, well ...

My campaign is set around the players being the crew of a ship that is
trying to pioneer a new, fast route between Collace and Narsil, just after
the Fifth Frontier War. Narsil is an Imperial client state, and Narsil is
one of the Sword Worlds, and the crew includes people who were on both
sides of the war. Their patron arranged for passports for them - the Sword
Worlds usually only allows 2 lines, Chaperon Blancs and Stellar Transport,
to service them (the Imperium wanted a peace treaty more than it wanted
\'free trade\', and the Sword Worlders *really* didnt want the megacorps to
get their claws into them).

The route tries to go right up the guts of District 268, saving a jump by
refuelling at Flexos and Faldor, both of which are very poor lo-tech worlds
with very rudimentary starports.

When I say \'very poor\', I mean it. Flexos is TL6, has an Exotic atmosphere,
60 000 people, per capita income of about Imperial Cr 600 a head, and total
exports of about 40 million a year. The ships\' engineer has already raided
their spare parts locker to help out the locals, and the purser has put
together a list of what they need. The long-term plan is to \'pad out\' any
space that freight customers havent booked with speculative cargos bought
at Collace and Narsil, and to take in exchange the barely-refined exotic
compounds the Flexii scratch from the surface in their ethanol-and-LOx
powered sealed ATVs.

Another key is to create interesting and detailed cargos (*shameless plug
for my Extended Spec Trade rules for GT:FT*). These guys are carrying a
*huge* piano, twleve dtons of very valuable, exceedingly flammable
buckyballs (note to chemists ... is buckminsterfullerine flammable ?), and
about 8 dtons of house pets. Any time things get boring, you can toss in a
delicate situation ...

A long-term idea as well is to get into the Polo Poni business. One of
Tarsus\' exports is Polo Ponis, usually to the teams that play on Glisten\'s
Polo Grounds (you know how much it costs to run that place ... an entire
ecosystem with artificial gravity in an asteroid belt, dedicated to
creating fine, even grass that the dedicated Polo conniseur just *knows* is
needed for a good game). The idea is that Polo catches on in Regina
subsector ... imagine what they\'d pay for a string of the finest Tarsus
Ponis ...

Nope, buckyballs aren\'t overly flammble. In fact, soot from candle or
acetylene flames are rich sources of naturally occurring fullerenes.
They\'ll probably burn readily, though...the current cheap way of making
them is to burn a carbon arc in helium, and chromatographing the soot.

I don\'t think you could make them _exceedingly_ flammable, except by
dissolving them in gasoline or something.

An MSDS (http://www.carbon60.co.uk/pages/page9.html )I found for mixed
fullerenes does not indicate flammability; and in fact mostly treats it
the same as carbon black, which is not classed as flammable.

Welcome back.

In the official universe, Dulinor was attacked by an automated piece of
farm machinery, and he bailed.  (sorry)  

In the GURPS: Traveller alternate history, Dulinor was killed on his way to
Capital in a mysterious explosion, Strephon is still Emperor in 1120, and
Grand Princess Iphengia and Prince Varian are touring the Spinward Marches.

One proposed use for buckyballs, I think, is as a way of trapping
and containing volatile substances allowing for easier transport.
I\'m thinking the carbon atoms form a cage holding the volatile
molecule in a cage where it can\'t react.  If this is *true* then it
might not be the buckyballs that are extremely flammable, it might
be what they are carrying.  As long as you don\'t crush, burn, or
otherwise break the buckyballs everything is cool, but if you
do...all heck breaks loose.

Of course, I could have this all wrong and if so...never mind.

Honestly Eris, at that point, I think we all saw that if we went into that

This is the sort of thing that would have been ok with us.   I\'ve just never
heard of it being done before in " The Merchant Game ".  Its a bit more
refreshing to know its out there.  Although, I think my players would NEVER
go for it.  All they can remember is the " Bad GM " and his UPS in

Damn straight.  Which is why no one misses the fact that hes not running
them anymore. Although it sounds like I\'d love to be a part of yours.

  I wonder about that - ISTR that they grabbed him by the shoulders and

  Ok guys/gals be nice to me I am still new to this Email list....


  In front of me (It took me about 2hrs to sift through all my Traveller related game magazines) I have Challenge #28 which was put out by GDW. It has a pretty extensive article (BTW I didn\'t even know what a K\'Kree was till I joined this list) called "K\'Kree Starships: a human perspective" It describes a K\'Kree merchant vessel in depth. They are Huge ships that waste most of there Volume for a "grazing" area that is quite large. It\'s a 6000tn ship with a 2-jump and a 1-G capability. and only has a standard Cargo capacity of 34tns.

  Now for what I found it for it describes the bridge of this ship as.....


 "The K\'Kree bridge is larger than one might be on a human ship. Obviously, K\'Kree are larger then men and they wish to be as comfortable as possible while on duty. The ceiling of the bridge is clear ceramic, giving the bridge crew a striking view of the stars around them. This also gives the room a very open feeling it would loose to walls and bulkheads."

  "The bridge area is characterized by its interesting K\'Kree work stations. Each station is recessed into the floor (a metal floor in the bridge) into which the K\'Kree sits with his four hind legs.This leaves his forelimbs free to operate the control panels spread out on the floor in front of each station."

  "The captains station is in the center of the bridge and can rotate as necessary. The navigational and engineering stations are fanned out in front of him. Scientific stations are located on either side of the bridge."


  I couldn\'t find any reference to G-Couches. But interestingly enough the fire control is located in the center of the "Simulated" grazing field by a central tree.


  (The above excerpt was from Issue Challenge magazine #28 page #23       )

  (paragraph 10 under the heading \'The Bridge" published by GDW.          )

  (Thanks to the authors  "Rob Caswell and Timothy B. Brown" which        )

  (I didn\'t know how to ask for there permission and hope they don\'t send )

  (lawyers after me. Thanks wherever you are.                             )


 Like I said I am new to this. 


  Hope this helps?

   Ok I finally found the article on Biotechnology.

 It is in the "Traveller Chronicle" #13. On page 32 with the Title 

  "Bio technology in Traveller" written by Matt Geisler. Its an extensive article 4 pages long breaking down all the advances in Biotechnology Levels (BTL) from BTL-8 to BTL-15. I think it was written so you can use it in all the forms of Traveller.

  Also I found the Article on Cyber Wear. its in "Traveller Chronicle" #9 on page #26 Titled "Hardware: New Cybernetics" written by Andrew Doull. It\'s 7 pages long and lists new stuff for Cyber\'s for the TNE rules.



  BTW I wish I had knew about this mag sooner, maybe my little contribution of the Subscription would have helped keep it going. All of them I have are real good reading. As far as I can tell from the web site http://members.aol.com/swrdknght/ttcinfo.htm  #13 was there last issue.

 If I am wrong someone please tell me...

Or you could try a reference to Pepin the Short and his two sons, though in
this case Charles didn\'t directly
It\'s amazing how few people have heard of a guy who ruled most of Europe for
nigh on fifty years.

No, I was thinking of the more mature Lucan of the later years of the

  I think a book I read, which I am trying to find again, bears somewhat on this. It was a "Honor Harington" something title. Where she is piloting a less capable ship against a far superior ship. I forget the specifics (bad memory and read too many books) but I know that how the different fire rates and load outs of the ships made a big difference in the outcome. I think she had more but slower rof and enemy had faster rof but less missiles. Or vise-versa.


 Its late and I babble.... :)


  BTW 

Has anyone tried making conversions of different genres (Like Starblasers/Robotech/Space Opera/Captain Harlock for example) into Traveler? I have been trying to find my Old notes on the readout of the ship Captain Harlock used that I made for traveler. BTW I used CT rules for it. And still play CT rules.

Actually, stuffed animals are a *very* recent introduction in the world
of toys. Teddy bears started after Teddy Roosevelt "rescued" an
orphaned bear cub. They were *widely* decried as perverting the
mothering instincts of young girls.

Toy animals that represent *working* animals (dogs, sheep, cows,
horses) or animals to be *hunted* are much older. But they tended to
not be cuddly. 

Dolls, on the other hand are very, very old. I\'m not sure if they\'ve
found any in Paleolithic sites, but I\'d be willing to bet that they\'ve
found them in Neolithic sites. Which would make them around 30,000
years old.

It\'s also the name of some sort of "combined force" unit (maybe real,
maybe made up). There was a comic about them in the late 60s early 70s.
It was from one of the smaller companies. 

It\'s *also* the name of a *real* military program. I think this one is
using ham radio operators to relay messages from isolated bases to
family members. And in wartime they cut in as a last resort comm backup.

I refer both of you to the scene in the book "Starship Troopers" where
Juan demands an inventory beforing accepting responsibility for a bunch
of gear. 

Even in the Scouts, you are going to have to account for equipment that
is lost, destroyed, or damaged. As well as consumables (such as ammo
and explosives) used. 

If the folks in the accounting department aren\'t happy with your
explanation, they will charge *you* for the cost of the items. And you
could get your pay docked for the rest of your unnatural life. 

This shouldn\'t happen often, but every once in a while, usually after
some "neat trick" your PCs that are actually serving will need to sit
down and come up with plausible explanations for things like where the
air raft went (they had to leave it with a native who rescued them from
someplace they can\'t admit to having been).

There are times when having to pay for your own gear is actually a
blessing. :-)

Just a thought. As a fine powder, if you transported it in tanks and
moved it between tanks by connecting a hose and pumping air through
then wouldn\'t the resulting mix be explosive if the hose ruptured and
the powder/air mix escaped?

Ok, so you should have removed the oxygen from the air used for pumping.

   I\'m happy to announce, that the above is not the only wild and wacky
mercahnt campaign out there. I\'ve played the assistant engineer in a Hard
Times Neworld sector merchant campaign for something like two years now
(both game time and real time), and in that time we have:

  Been thrown into a five mile deep canyon on a near-vacuum planet,
_whitout vacc-suits_, because someone thought we were pirates. (Just for
the record: we\'re not.)

  Rescued a 250-year old AI-construct of a legendary mechanist painter
from slavers. (For a pretty buck, I might add.)

  Gotten caught in three (yes, three) different local wars, and nearly
gotten ourselves killed each time.

  Escaped fron an embargoed starport dodging TL-7 tank cannon rounds
during one of the above. (Guess we won\'t be going back to Bianbi anytime
soon.)

  Recovered the remains of a Hiver/Gleruxian scout, that hit something
living inside a gas giant.

  And these are just the ones I can explain in a few compact sentances.
Free trading can indeed be a fun and interesting (not to mention
life-threatening) career. (Just as a side point: througout all this mayhem
we have been making huge profits all the time.)

I thought it was also in the context of BEM - Bug Eyed Monsters - linked to

No reason it couldn\'t have been both. The Colonial Marines are in
business to protect innocent colonists from the evil Bug Eyed Monsters*,
there could still be 99 false alarms for every dangerous alien encountered.

The Marines end up spending most of their time as constables, 
peacekeepers and corporate muscle (union-breaking, anyone?) - real
action against real people, though of course people who are very
outclassed (which will make the Marines very cocky).
The usual "bug hunt" turns into a wild goose chase, where they get
no opportunities to bust heads, feel macho and impress the farmer\'s
daughters.

Therefore you\'ll have the Marines thinking of BEM\'s when they go after
a xenomorph, but expecting to waste time and be bored.

*They could get this job (anti-BEM squad) before any BEM\'s are ever
encountered. All it takes is an ex-Marine in the government, desperately
looking for a job for his beloved Corps now that there aren\'t any 
terrestrial enemies to shoot at.

I\'m recalling the elaborate armament on the big exploration ship in
Disney\'s _The Black Hole_. No aliens had ever been encountered,
but the governments building the _Cygnus_(?) had visions of hordes
of BEM\'s lurking in the dark of space.

I still have the ledger from a solo merchant campaign that I ran with a
buddy aboard ship back in 1984.  We covered about ten years of game time in
ten months and kept very detailed records.  He started with one ship and
three NPCs and grew to three ships and over twenty crew.  Most of his
"adventures" were the struggle against competitors or the challenge of
hammering out a trade deal.  He did use one ship to run some risky routes
outside of the Imperium and he did operate for awhile across the battle
lines of the FFW, but we stayed with sensible trade tables and still had a
good time.  The "glory" was that of building a going concern from humble
beginnings.  I admit that this probably would not have held the interest of
a group of players, but for one or two it can be quite satisfying.  Um...,
one small thing.  Did I mention that his wife was a CPA? ;-)

For those who enjoyed MegaTraveller, the Traveller\'s Digest #13 had 
an excellent article on the use of prosthetics and bionics as 
replacements for lost limbs, and detailed the rules needed to 
integrate cybernetics into your campaign.  (#14 dealt with cloning

Tritium, or more correctly, tritiated water. In this case, however, and in
general use, heavy water refers to D2O, deuterated water, as the heavy water
was purified from ordinary water, and the tritium content of ordinary water
(at that point in history) was zero; it is not a naturally occuring isotope.

It would be microscopically higer today, as we\'ve now had working nuclear
reactors for the last 65 years or so, and considerable production of tritium,
some of which would have to have escaped into the environment. TMI, for
instance, released several curies of radiation (IIRC) most of which was
tritium gas.

Tritium is produced in reactors, deuterium, as it is a stable isotope, is
purified from ordinary water. It\'s relatively cheap, I used to buy 100 mls of
it (99.99% D purity) for < $50-$100 (it\'s been a long time, so my numbers may
be way off) We used it for a aqueous solvent for proton NMR work.

Just kidding!

For fictional sources, in addition to those already suggested, I would take a 
look at Andre Norton\'s "Solar Queen" and "Free Trader" stories. I would also 
look at Elizabeth Moon\'s stuff (the "Sporting Chance" books--three now, I 
think and the other series set in the same universe--two books, I think). 
While not a merchant campaign, it does give you ideas. 

The game should not be just bookkeeping. That would be like running a merc 
campaign where you are constantly in battle, rolling dice for damage results. 
A merc campaign or a merchant campaign or a exploration campaign has to be 
well rounded!

Damnable treasonous lies spread by Margaret\'s allies. Strephon was still

Facsinating point of succession law, then...if one kills the Emperors
stand-in to claim the throne, using the Right of Assasination, when
everyone, Moot included, believes that the person you killed _is_ truly
the Emperor, what happens?

Had Dulinor succeeded as he had planned, and won the day in the Palace,
he would be legally Emperor, confirmed by the Moot(at gunpoint or not,
it matters little), would he not? 

This would be _particularly_ relevant if Strephon\'s double was really a
clone...genetic analysis on the corpse would \'prove\' he was indeed
Strephon.


Of course, this brings up yet _another_ variation on the scenario:
Dulinor succeeds, Lucan _does_ kill his brother, and claims that he is
the rightful heir to the throne. He would have to flee, and raise his
armies away from Core. 

Since he so desperately wants power, would he flee to rimward and strike
a deal with the Solomani Confederation? It would make sense, he wants
the throne, the Solomani want Terra back, but probably aren\'t all that
interested in expanding further into the Imperium...right now, that
is...they\'re still trying to rebuild from the last war, and if they
retake Terra it will be a cheap, but important morale building victory.

Then rumors start popping up that Strephon is really alive, then more
substantial reports, then some people take up arms to \'restore the
rightful Emperor\'

The Rebellion wouldn\'t have become the all-encompassing war it did, but
there would be two low level insurgencies happening, Lucan, backed by
the Solomani, and Strephon, backed by, who? 

The Zhodani, in return for data from Longbow II. After all, hard data on
what was about to engulf them (The Empress Wave) would give them
desperately needed time to plan ahead; Strephon might even be given
assurances that the Zhodani didn\'t really _want_ the Imperium. 

Norris could well have supported him, too, had Strephon proven his
identity to him. (relatively easy, considering Norris\' aide Dilgaadiin
is a telepath) This would have provided him a strong base of support in
the Deneb. I don\'t know whether Dulinor would have appointed Norris Duke
of Deneb, but I doubt it...of all people, Dulinor does NOT want a smart,
popular Archduke beneath him. Never can tell what\'ll happen the next
time he comes to visit, after all!

Brzk and Margaret\'s factions would likely never exist, Daibei and the
Vilani wouldn\'t have seceded.

And all the while, Dulinor\'s plans are being sidetracked by matters he
didn\'t think he would have to deal with, delaying his vision of
integrating the Imperium into a state more responsive to it\'s citizen\'s
needs. (or extending Imperial tyranny, depending on whose propaganda you
listen to) He extends Imperial control over the member worlds just as
he\'ll need to institute more repressive measures due to the growing
insurgencies.

Nice little Imperium we\'ve got here :->

Small amounts of tritium are released on a daily basis from operating
commercial nuke plants.  Their licenses give "allowable" levels, which they
stay well below.  The release data is logged and reported, so may be
available under "right to know" laws from the NRC.

Heavy water is deuterium oxide, D2O.  Water is protium oxide, H2O
(predominantly).  Tritium oxide occurs as a result of atmospheric
nuclear testing, IIRC, and is radioactive.

Allegedly.

The future King Henry had as much reason to want them dead.

A verdict of "Not proven" I think (summed up by someone as "the jury

I think the simplest answer is to compare what happens if a det laser/PA
hits the powerplant or if it hits the small craft bay. I always design my
warships with thin basic armour and then thicken it up over the vitals. Its
much more important at lower TL (when armour is just so much bulkier
and heavier).

Is there any chance you could find a web page to put it up on?  I\'d like to
see this if possible, since I\'m doing something similar for my new GT
campaign.  Mine may be less generally applicable though, since I\'m
compressing the history of the Imperium a lot.  I want to maintain the
Milieu 1100 setting, but move things like the Civil Wars into the much more
recent past.  For example, the Civil Wars are going to be only about
150-200 years in the past and the renewed imperial presence in the Marches
less than 100.  I think this will give things more of a sense of urgency,
without tearing the whole structure apart like the Rebellion/Virus did.

While the characters were originally conceived by Bob Clampett, the first
cartoon featuring the pair, The Goofy Gophers (1947), wound up being
directed by Arthur Davis. Clampett had finished recording the soundtrack,
but animation had not been completed when he left the studio in 1945.

The characters were based partly on the super-polite Edward Everett Horton
and Franklin Pangborn, including their rather "prissy" mannerisms, and also
on Alphonse and Gaston, two early comic strip characters created by F.P.
Opper who were also super-polite. Mel Blanc and Stan Freberg provided the
characters\' voices.

The gophers have come to be known as "Mac \'n\' Tosh" -- apparently in a spoof
of the Disney characters "Chip \'n\' Dale" -- but these names was never used
in the classic era cartoons.

Filmography:

The Goofy Gophers (Davis, 1947)
Two Gophers From Texas (Davis, 1948)
A Ham in a Role (McKImson, 1949)
A Bone for a Bone (Freleng, 1951)

ObTrav: The Imperial Encyclopedia. We are all familiar with the Imperial
Encyclopedia, it introducing us to many aspects of the official Traveller
setting. How is the Encyclopedia used in actual play, though? Is it an
in-depth overview of everything in human knowledge (like the Library of
Brin\'s Startide Rising universe)? Or is a much more fallible edition, with
more in common with the Hitchhiker\'s Guide to the Galaxy?

How big is the full edition of the Encyclopedia, anyway? Will it fit onboard
a single ship\'s computer?

IIRC What CJ Cherryh herself said in the intro
to one of her books was that her publisher
or agent suggested she change it because
Carolyn Cherry sounded like the name of a 
romance author not a science fiction author
and that this could hurt her sales.

It did not offend her sensibilities it hurt
her chances of being published & selling well.

PS: Carl was quite right to recommend Cherryh,
especially the Chanur series.

The problem with this scenario is that fighters just dont work in
anti-miltary ship roles without torpedos.

Three key elements cripple fighters for military roles.

The first is the square-cube law. The square-cube law means that the same
commitment of mass as a percentage of ship mass will provide more armour
for a bigger ship.

The second element is the mejajoulage limit on lasers - it is simple to
build a big ship whose armour is proof against lasers. Yes, you can try to
scrub the surface, but that is what redundant sensors are for. A related
fact is the fact that length is the main determinant of effective range for
PAWs and Meson Guns.

The third element is nuclear dampers. A fighter cannot, generally speaking,
carry a nuke damper, which makes them excessivly vulnerable to detonation
laser nuclear missiles.

Now, if fighters do not carry spinal mounts and nuclear dampers, then they
will be essentially unable to harm military ships. There may be a role for
\'defensive\' fighters - rapid fire laser platforms, designed to avoid the
hardpoint limit for point defense lasers, but these will stay within the
protective envelope of the \'real ships\' nuclear dampers.

The analogy for fighters in the Traveller universe is not the torpedo boats
of the 19th century, or their cousins the bomb-, torpdeo- and
missile-carrying aircraft of the 20th century. It is the coastal gunboats
of the late 20th century, useful for police and customs role, but on no
account to be put anywhere near the line of battle.

>Just kidding!

An example of where pirates are viable is somewhere like Trexalon\'s
asteroid belts.

Trexalon (District 268-1339) is a pop 8, TL 12/GT10 independant world with
3 asteroid belts. It is outside the Imperium, and is therefore limited to
it\'s own defenses.

Now, imagine you have found a workable site on an asteroid somewhere in
those belts. It is 3 AU from the mainworld. Ten megacredits or so will buy
a couple of fusion guns to protect the actual mining site, and it isnt that
hard to put most of the facility underground to defend against bombardment.

The mainworld should be able to detect traffic in or near that asteroid,
but it will take at least a day to respond. This is probably long enough to
defend against an actual raid on the site.

If you choose to develop the site, then anyone coming there would know that
they are risking meeting up with someone they\'d rather not meet. Therefore,
they are going to have to be paid to take that risk. Rather than paying
them Cr 725 to ship the output to your market on Collace, you offer a flat
Cr 1500.

This is pretty bloody tempting if you own an upgunned Far Trader.

Therefore, all conditions seem to be met to allow piracy ...

Not even allegedly, really.

Everything I\'ve seen suggests he had someone else do the deed for him, the
most common suggestion being a certain mercenary captain whose name I\'ve
temporarily forgotten.

One source even suggests they were never actually killed, just walled up
alive.

>The future King Henry had as much reason to want them dead.

Of course, most people think Richard is a nasty sort with a physical
deformity because of Shakespeare\'s propaganda, in fact he was physically
able and probably a much nicer person than Henry.

I actually like John M.Fords version in "The Dragon Waiting", where they
were killed because they were vampires.

 I have seen that game at the comic shop (only one in our little city).

What is it about?



 Has anyone tried to figure out how to use the Shields that were in the honor book in traveler? The were sort a like real dense gravity wave that pulled light along its effect and dispersed it. But it only covered 2 sides from stem to stern. (I think that\'s how you say it.)

  Aren\'t Bucky balls those things that have near 0 friction against anything? If they are, Imagine spilling them in the cargo bay. I think it would make for some good slapstick comedy.

 I play CT pretty much exclusively for my space games. (I\'ve even started play testing variant rules for generating characters for Battle Tech using the CT gen rules) Has anyone here made any Careers tables for other types of characters not covered by the LBB\'s or the Spinward Marches book?

She\'s not the only author to do this. I seem to recall reading

She\'s got a couple other series that have interesting aliens, and, in

Actually, getting shot down isn\'t your fault *unless* they can show

being shot down.

More like a grain-silo explosion, in which the dust from the
normally-nonexplosive grain mixes with air.  This can result in "an
Earth-shattering ka-boom."

No need to scan it, it is all digital. I can save it as a jpg

I have some confused ideas about copyrights. I am uncertain that 
I should be making pubicly available that map without sjgames 
permission. I have sent them what I have and what I am doing 
and asked for that permission. Still waiting...

Actually, he\'s thinking more along the lines of a a grain silo. Flour, or
grain dust is also _quite_ explosive when dry and finely divided. They blow up
all the time.

An old set of encyclopedias I used to have had a child\'s demonstration of the
effect. Take one cardboard oatmeal canister with a small hole in the top.  Dry
a teaspoon of flour in a low oven for (IIRC) about an hour. Put the flour into
the box, and shake it up. Hold a lit match near the hole in the top. 

BOOM!

Mom comes running into the kitchen, thinking you have killed yourself to find
fine white powder drifting throughout. Now you _do_ wish you had killed yourself...:-)

Oddly, the encyclopedia ended _it\'s_ description at the BOOM part...

While possible, it is far more difficult to make an effective FAE from
powdered materials.

Unless you can invent a non-canon weapon for your campaigns that uses the
small fighters ability to get closer to the enemy. I would like to suggest
one, taken straight from the pages of Traveller: 2300.

Submunitions.

To all intents and purposes these are missile warheads without an attatched
missile motor. The fighter closes range (to "very close" in T4, same hex/
range band in TNE etc.) and drops the weapon (or many) which detonates
almost immediately (2 seconds after launch in T:2300 but speeds are much
greater) and so bypasses point defences (and depending on which version of
Traveller you are playing nuclear dampers as well).

<snip 3 excellent reasons why fighters can\'t fight>

Without a major shipkilling weapons system, which would be better mounted
on a larger more survivable ship, unless necessity demanded a small craft
(back to submunitions).

No, a MacDraw file, at a guess. At least, Bryan has a whole bunch of my
drawing for the CD, and his PC stripped off the resource fork so they no
longer worked.

As well, it renamed all ".html" extensions to ".htm", hereby breaking a lot
of the links in the web pages he included. Those of you who have got a lot
of 404 errors looking at the web pages on the CD might want to try manually
changing the URLs (which is a tedious workaround, but it does work).

Actually, it is Shipbuilding/TL (Starship)

It is a TL dependent skill.

Question: How would the standard GURPS TL penalties for learning 
it at TL affect the only two "canon" starship TLs in GT?  Normally, to 
go from 10 to 12 is a -10 penalty and from 12 to 10 a -3 penalty.  
But there isn\'t anything in the middle.  Would you guys treat it as a 
single step or two?

"By thunder, those guizels are stealing the Mae Lee!" Yeah, I 
have to agree that in the merchant game Eris runs, everyone gets 
as involved as they care to be.

Only some of the below have happened, but I expect the rest to

....figures out how to keep the archaeologist from stealing 
the local treasure, in the name of science. Gets blindsided 
by the enemies of the discharged chief engineer when they show 
up looking to make sure he stays out of the navy\'s way. Tries 
to figure out how in the blazes he is going to beg, borrow or 
steal the funds to pay for the "great" cargo that his various 
crewmen have found.

Buckminster Fullerines, a very complex carbon molecule whose "geodesic"
shape remind you of Fuller\'s domes.  Because of their "hollow globe" shape
other molecules can be carried "inside" the buckyball.  There are currently
some medical and industrial applications being tested.  The whole idea is
bizarre.  Not that I\'m an authority on the subject, but I had to listen to a
great debate on the subject when I worked in a chem lab several years ago.

Thanks to all for the information on this query.


Now are there to be many deckplans for GT Starships ?

And can we be expecting SJG Cardboard Cargos and Mix
and Match Deckplans in a separate book.

The main point is support by the military as far as I can tell.
Most the military seemed to be stunned and angered by Stephon\'s
death (he was generally supported by the military) and would
have probably refused to support Dulinor.  That means he is
unlikely to be able to force the Moot to confirm him.

NMR = Nuclear Magnetic Resonance.  It is a techniqe that analyzes
samples by putting them in a magnetic field and
looks at the energy (typically radio wave energies) needed to
flip the spins of nuclei of certain elements.  If you are doing
protons, you
don\'t want the solvent to swamp the signal from what is dissolved
in it. There for you generally use deuterated solvents.

There\'s another one more recent than Weyman: Ferdinand Waldo
Demara, aka "The Great Impostor", who succeded in impersonating
(among other things) a monk, a prison warden, and a Navy doctor
aboard a Canadian navy ship during the Korean War. A movie starring
Tony Curtis was made about Demara (The Great Impostor, 1961). The
creators of the current series The Pretender acknowledge Demara as
one of the inspirations for their show.

ObTrav: someone with the skills of a Weyman, Demara, or Jarod would
be able to get away with a lot more in the Third Imperium. Since
communication is only as fast as travel, the Imperial Pretender could
just keep moving on, assuming new identities on new planets. Of course,
he would need to be able to update/fake his ID credentials, but someone
with an appropriately high skill in the right areas (Forgery, Computers)
could pull it off.

The penetration ratings vs armour values in FFS2 are quite clear on the
matter. The problem is that IG went broke before they did a \'real\' space
combat system.

But small fighters dont *have* an ability to get closer to the enemy.

They get within range, they go *boom*.

Look at the Signature class laser. 600 megajoules at a shot per 2.5
seconds. How many fighters are you going to need to get one in range ?

Given that \'point defense\' is det laser range (30-60KKM), I\'d say the laser
point defenses are blowing up the fighters at a bit before that, and our
own counter-missile missiles would be happily doing their thing as well.

Waving a nuke damper over the fighter at range would also help, although I
would concede that a fighter should be able to carry damper boxes to
protect the warheads.

\'Famile Spofulam Releases New Laser Turrets\'

\'Enigmatic business tycoon, Hengabar Sofulam, today released the latest
release from Famile Spofulam\'s High Energy Solution labs - the Signature
class X-ray lasers.

The weapons, a TL13 rapid-fire X-ray lasers, are designed to fit into
Imperial standard 3 and 6 dton turrets, and are capable of firing at a rate
of 24 shots per minute, and are capable of sustained, accurate fire out to
500 000 km.

The turrets include beam pointers and a crewstation, and are designed to
slot directly into an appropriately sized turret socket.

The first is a 200 megajoule laser unit, and masses 47.75 t and is quoted
at costing MCr 2.2, including the 3 dton turret. The second is a 650
megajoule laser unit, massing 115.5t and costing MCr 3.1, including the
6dton turret.

Hengabar\'s neice, Ditzammer Spofulam, met with reporters after
demonstrating the lighter weapon by carving her initials in a X-tek XTF-4
Delta Fighter at a range of 120 000 km. The demonstation of the heavier
version was terminated after 7.5 seconds fire, as the target had been
turned into plasma by that time.

Her comments were \'Weeeee reckon that if you only have spaceie-wace for one
laser-waser, then it oughta oughta oughta be a good one. Weeee reckon that
the the the baby Signature-wignature can put out as much megajoulage as
eight nooormal civilian laser-wasers, an an an can solve most
problem-woblems\'.

The Imperial Ministry of Justice has issued a temporary restraining order
against sale of the heavier model to civilians. It is understoof Famile
Spofulam\'s legal team are planning an appeal.\'

****************************************************************************
*******

The 200 MJ laser has a damage value of 51 (2.5 cm of superdense), while the
650 MJ laser has a DV of 92 (4 cm of superdense). Both have a minimum delay
between shots of 2.5 seconds - eight times the RoF of a \'standard\'
shipboard laser. Precise ratings depend on the combat system you use, and
the RoF your power plant can maintain.

These babies burn up a lot of power - you need [MJ/(0.65*delay)] megawatts
to keep shooting them. Note that you can reduce the output of the laser to
increase the rate of fire, which could be important when using them in a
point defense role.

The cost is actually dominated by the 500 000km beam pointer, which could
be cut down to 50 000km by cheapskates.

Note that one of these lasers is, in general, as effective as 8 lasers at
the \'standard\' rate of fire of a shot every 20 seconds. Lots of luck
powering the big laser at maximum RoF though (370 MW ... ouch).

At TL13, they are very cutting edge for the early Imperium, but are
technically obsolescent by the 1100s.

    'body' => 'I have just received my copy of First In.  As usual I headed straight for the
starship section.  I have a few problems with the designs. As there are no
errata available, I address my questions to the list.

1. XBoat

I know it is canon, but I still find it hard to believe that a ship would be
built with no manouver capablity at all,  Is there a beleivable handwave for
this?

2. Donosev. 

My calculations give an LMass of 751 which is about 23 stons above the design
spec, and a cost of about 116 MCr which is about 24 MCr below the design spec. 
Why is this?

Why does the ship have two fuel processors when its fuel skimmer also
incorporates two fuel processors?

3. Khadumir 

The Khadumir has 5 fuel processors which is excessive.

There is no cummunications module listed for this ship, which seems necessary
for its role.
 
4. Xboat Tender

I calculate 79 Cargo rather than 82 Cargo as listed.

5. Pytheeas Cruiser.

I am in agreement in all aspects except cost, which I calculate to be about 140
MCr higher than the listed price.  This is almost exactly equal to the cost of
Radical EM cloaking & Radical Stealthing combined. Has radical EM cloaking &
stealthing been included in the cost?

6. Xboat tender deckplans 

At the top of page 43 the cargo deck & vehicle deck are reversed. 

According to the design the vehicle deck should be 60 percent of the ship, but
the deckplans show it as less than half of the ship.

7. Communications module storage capabilities

Why is the storage capability of a GTL10 comms module below that of a real world
top of the range disk drive?
500 Gigabytes is less than a thousand real world CD-ROMs. Real world computer
capabilties seem to have been way underated again in Traveller.

I think that Lucan\'s intelligence service was responsible for the
assassination of Brzk. That \'Superioriti\' mob was almost certainly a
front-group.

I can forgive Lucan for killing Varian - he probably was as spoilt and
obnoxious as Lucan, but I can\'t forgive Lucan for killing Brzk.

(NB:  Brzk died before the release of Virus.)

Still, in the GT alternate universe - BRZK LIVES!!!!

  How many G\'s will the fighter and/or submunition be pulling for the

minimum before auto-hit/ROF stuff starts?

Ummmm... No. "Story-telling" type gaming does not have to be "railroading"
anymore than mercenary and merchant games have to be micromanagement of the
ship\'s books. Just keep on reading though.

Nothing you\'re saying is incompatible with what I am. Not in the slightest.
I\'m suspecting that you\'re being kind of sarcastic, but I can\'t be sure.

Money can easily still be a McGuffin  when the PC\'s ship has its Jump Drive
damaged by pirates from either a planned or random encounter, through
regular use of the combat system.

In fact, I\'d be quite happy if my players ended up with a broken Jump Drive
(especially if it happened near the end of a session).

It depends. If you happen to be a GM who\'s good at that, then go for it. If
your players happen to like that style of play, more power to you. From your
comments, it seems like the types of games that you like to play (or run)
are relatively simple (in the sense of straightforward) and involve alot of
explosions.

The type of games my players like to play in seem to be more geared towards
exploration and intrigue as opposed to blowing things up and then going home
to figure out if they have enough money to get bigger weapons to blow things
more things up the next time they find a patron.

By and large it\'s their choice, not mine. I run more story oriented
campaigns and am a big fan of Marc Miller\'s "push & pull" style of play that
appears in the Traveller Book and T4 (and likely other places). Basically,
there\'s a larger backdrop against which the players adventure that players
learn about through a series of adventures (either related or unrelated).

However, at the beginning of a campaign I always give my players the option
to simply blow things up. They never take it.

<shrug>

I dunno. If money becomes an object in a campaign, I\'d rather it become the
something like it is in the films Kelly\'s Heroes, The Usual Suspects and The
Sting. Personally, I would find it boring running a game in which my players
do jobs, get paid and then buy more stuff to do more jobs. My players seem
to think that it would be boring to play that way as well.

It\'s something that I carried away from the way that my brother would run
campaigns in AD&D. Treasure was rarely simply money, it was often
(non-magical) tomes, jewelry or other things. In one adventure we found a
series of tomes that were a detailed bestiary of aquatic creatures. They
were worth several thousand gold pieces, but were actually much more
interesting (so I kept them). They led us on another adventure several
sessions later.

On the other hand, my PCs in a Traveller game went on a subsector-wide
scavenger hunt with merely the promise that if they won they\'d become famous
among the local Impie scouts. This also happened to be one of the most
entertaining campaigns I ran.

Anyway, plotted adventures don\'t have to equate to railroading.

Not really. We may not know whether or not he spent it (although there
*were* changes made to the Falcon between Star Wars and Empire), but we do
know he didn\'t spend it paying Jabba the Hutt off.

Since he didn\'t spend it paying Jabba the Hutt off, the storyline went off
on a tangent with lots of adventure and excitement. Anyway, the money still
had an effect on the storyline, even if you didn\'t personally happen to see
it.

I disagree. I would assume that the crew in Alien had to worry about making
a living, or they wouldn\'t have been interstellar truck drivers hauling ore.
If they weren\'t worried about making a living the engineers wouldn\'t have
been balking about their shares.

Okay, so maybe in Star Trek or Star Wars they don\'t, but the dynamic is
entirely different. In the case of Star Trek, the reasons are obvious. They
don\'t need to lust after money as (1) they\'ve got replicators and (2)
they\'re in the employ of a huge interstellar government.

In Star Wars, the main characters are all involved in an interstellar
rebellion that has the considerable backing of many worlds throughout the
galaxy.

Here\'s a crazy idea: What if the players\' interaction with society actually
was the gauge for how well the players are interacting with society?

I know that\'s a zany idea and all. Why does there have to be any sort of
gauging going on in the first place?

I mean, let\'s look at some examples:

A young noble who starts out rich and goes on a trek across the imperium to
sort of figure out his place in the Traveller universe. By your standard,
he\'s already attained the top of the heap, really.

A suit working for a megacorporation in an upper management position. He
makes a sickening amount of credits per week. I imagine that such a
character could be interesting to play in certain circumstances, I don\'t
imagine it\'s most folks\' cup of tea. On the other hand, by your gauge he\'s
really interacting well in society, even before a player has sat down behind
his character sheet.

A conniving rogue who can\'t seem to hold on to more than a few credits. He
uses his wits, charm and guile, not to mention his healthy Jack o\' Trades
skill, to work his way across the Traveller Universe. He\'s not interacting
well with society at all, although such a character might be more
interesting to play for a good number of people.

Silly me. I thought that the fun that the players and GM are having playing
the game should be the most important gauge in the game.

As a former PBO (Property Book Officer) for a combat engineer company in the

time losses.  I remember when someone in the Air Cav Squadron lost a pistol
in the field.  The Commanding Colonel kept the whole Squadron out in the
field a extra six weeks looking for it.  They never did find the darned

a supply Sargent who claimed that if the Vietnam War had lasted a bit longer
he would have retired a rich man.  It seemed that he was in charge of a
supply depo in country where the goodies were kept; steaks, booze etc.  He
and his buddies  were selling the stuff on the black market and covering
their losses with a little bit of artistically placed "war damage" after
each mortar attack.

Now that\'s something I\'ve been thinking about.  During the first Civil War
nearly all the (temporarily) successful claimants to the throne were
military rather than civil leaders.  During the second war (Rebellion), all
the claimants were primarily civil leaders - Dukes, Archdukes and so on.

(This difference would be important in a Milieu 600 game.)

Yet another alternate Imperium would be one in which Dulinor\'s coup
succeeds, but in which he gets overthrown in a military coup.  This would
then lead into a rerun of the first Civil War, with lots of dubiously
legitimate Barracks Emperors.  If it continued long enough, it could
shatter the Imperium into a lot of warlord ruled splinters, just as the
first Civil War almost did.  

Preventing a new Long Night can then become a major project.

Ditzie has a new concept. A ground motorbike that uses hypergolic fuels
rather than an air-breathing engine.

Basically, the engine works through a hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide
reaction. It\'s designed for use in exotic atmospheres, where air-breathers
dont work.

Now, the key is that the fuel pod and reaction chamber should be simple to
protect from the atmosphere, and the rest of the bike can be cheap lo-tech
construction - when sufficiently corroded, get a new frame and install the
rocket pod on it.

Does this make sense to people ?

 Here\'s a crazy idea: What if the players\' interaction with society actually
 was the gauge for how well the players are interacting with society?

xxxx
And how the socity changes becouse of them.
xxxx
 
 I know that\'s a zany idea and all. Why does there have to be any sort of
 gauging going on in the first place?

xxxx
So that the PCs can see that they are doing something.
xxxx
 
 I mean, let\'s look at some examples:
 
 A young noble who starts out rich and goes on a trek across the imperium to
 sort of figure out his place in the Traveller universe. By your standard,
 he\'s already attained the top of the heap, really.
 
 A suit working for a megacorporation in an upper management position. He
 makes a sickening amount of credits per week. I imagine that such a
 character could be interesting to play in certain circumstances, I don\'t
 imagine it\'s most folks\' cup of tea. On the other hand, by your gauge he\'s
 really interacting well in society, even before a player has sat down behind
 his character sheet.

xxxx
Now if some one was trying to kill said person...
xxxx
 
 A conniving rogue who can\'t seem to hold on to more than a few credits. He
 uses his wits, charm and guile, not to mention his healthy Jack o\' Trades
 skill, to work his way across the Traveller Universe. He\'s not interacting
 well with society at all, although such a character might be more
 interesting to play for a good number of people.

xxxx
He would be more interesting becouse of what is need to survive.
xxxxx
 
 Silly me. I thought that the fun that the players and GM are having playing
 the game should be the most important gauge in the game.

True, very true.  Win32 does not require the use of the DOS \'8.3\' filenames
- -- but, for whatever reason, Billy\'s boys will readily
sacrifice the conveniences offered by their attempt at a Mac GUI for the
sake of remaining compatible with ancient, Model/1bis
boxes.  Oh, I mean MS-DOS.

Mac users need to be aware of the fact that their files need some \'cleaning
up\' before they can be used properly on a PC.  Especially before
Toasting an ISO 9660 CD.  Strip all the resource forks and rename all the
files into 8.3 format.  Images should be saved as GIF, JPEG, BMP,
or something that anyone with a cheap DOS box can read.  Leave the fancy
TIFF, PDF and EPS files to the people who have spent a little
money on their system (or have a newer system).  Do not give a PICT file to
a Wintel user.  Though Mac is able to read PC files (except
executables if you don\'t have VPC or equivalent), the reverse is not true.

Thinking along these lines (and striving lamely to steer on-topic -- sorry),
has anyone come up with a system for CT computers that has been
\'revised\' to account for some of the more obvious technical advancements
that have been made since HG was printed?  Speed, storage, raw
processing power, data compression, parallel CPU arrays, \'Moore\'s Law\' (or
similar \'geometric curve\' tech progress
phenomenon/theories), the incredible plunge in the cost of complex silicon?
Or does Naasirka levy a tax -- er, license fee -- that would make
His Grace, Archduke Gates III of Terra wince -- making newer computer
technology unfeasible due to excessive cost?  Or just acquiring and
sitting on tech innovation (a la the auto/oil industry)?  What would the
megacorporations fear from allowing newer tech into the
mainstream?  Individual independence, perhaps?  (I\'m just saying...,
history, you know...)  The megacorporation\'s greatest market asset are
their respective distribution channels -- by far the most expensive part of
the Traveller universe, starships.  And lots of them.  Any little
podunk company that happens to develop a useful application for a tech
breakthrough simply has no chance to compete with that much
entrenched access to the masses.

So the trend would be for all the small companies and concerns to work
toward being bought-out by a megacorp.  Kind of like a rock band
trying to get signed by a record label.  In \'real life\' there are only six
major labels that own ALL the others: Warner Bros.; CBS/Columbia
(Sony); BMG (Atlantic, etc.); MCA (Geffen, etc.); Siemens (RCA, etc.); and
EMI (Capitol, etc.)  The main difference between these six
companies and the hundreds of independent labels is DISTRIBUTION.  Trucks,
planes, shelf space in every city at once, etc.  The
independents can only take an artist/act so far -- then (with much luck) if
that act becomes even slightly known beyond its home town, the
major labels may take an interest and make an offer the artist simply could
not refuse.  Leaving the independent is a no-brainer: do you want
to sell your tapes at the nightclub\'s door, or would you like your CD on the
shelves of every Tower, Best Buy, Walmart, Sam Goodies,
Warehouse, every shopping mall and department store in 23 countries?-- only
a giant distribution infrastructure and plenty of capital can
offer that kind of saturation.  Back in CT: on an Imperial scale, just
replace cities with star systems, and the same model takes shape.  Except
that the steep curve of high-tech advancement seems to have hit a brick wall
in cannon rules.  The \'future\' as seen from the 1970\'s is quite a
bit different from the \'future\' as seen from the 1990\'s.  Hell, the
difference between 1998 and 1999 is greater than the whole decade between
1970 and 1980.  The five thousand years before the 18th century saw as much
progress as the one hundred years after.  And the curve goes on,
higher and higher.  People say "Well, _obviously_ that cannot last
indefinitely..."  But how do we know?  My grandfather could not have
possibly dreamed of the world in 1999 back in the \'30\'s.  (The \'60\'s didn\'t
even show up on radar until it was upon them, who could have
known?)  I know, CT is a parallel universe.  No sense in making it conform
to ours.

Except I like it better when it\'s as real as we know how to make it.  The
group I game with is quite intense about this (two Davis
physics/math grads among them, but no ideas for the game, per se, mainly
complaints about the math).  >:-[  When Marc Miller set out to
pen the original Traveller, he deliberately chose to cast the setting and
game rules with \'reality\' being the standard.  Not Tolkein, it was not
supposed to be like D&D.  He wanted the physics to be correct -- up to the
point where he, like every interstellar SF writer, had to deal with
Einstein and his bloody maximum theoretical speed through a 4-dimensional
environment where gravity is the topology of the
non-Euclidean \'surface\' of space-time.  Ok, fine.  That\'s gotta go, if you
want to have the setting interstellar --  yet interactive.  (It\'s easy to
travel to extremely distant stars, in the math at least.  The problem would
be the time dilation as you approach 85-90% of C.  Can\'t have
much of an interactive community or economy if the trip only takes you a
month, while your destination passes through 80,000 years.)  So,
viol la -- the Jump Drive.  Whose to say it isn\'t possible?  (Besides my
physics buddies -- but hey, they keep trying to include "h" into the travel
equations; there is a limit, beyond which is madness.)

I personally like the Traveller Jump Drive idea.  It\'s much better that the
majority of SF\'s \'workarounds\' to the "Einstein Bug" that
continually plagues all the Faster-Than-Light drives out there.  The stuff
Miller had to completely manufacture for game convenience is not
a problem to me -- by departing from General Relativity, he now has the
freedom to construct his own physics in his \'jump\' realm.  I like it so
much because it\'s so conservative -- as if, "...if we\'re going to have to
break this piece, let\'s try and do as little damage as possible to all the
other pieces," eg, fuzzy logic theory doesn\'t show up in normal \'non-jump\'
existence very much.  This is good: if people started beaming in
and replicating their Fuzzy Navels in crystal goblets while talking on the
sub-space laptop to their friends 1500 light years away in realtime
- -- I would quit gaming and watch TV.  Anti-gravity is another invention that
makes many aspects of the game convenient -- however, there
are plenty of current theories in the journals describing all manner of
bizarre behavior on the part of gravity (and our perception of it),
leaving quite a bit of fertile, undeveloped acreage in the quantum field
theory (which describes the properties of \'gravitons\').  So Miller is
making things for future tech levels that do not depart too much from the
theoretically possible.  My difficulty is with those areas in CT that
are NOT fictional, and that can be observed right now, today, by anyone,
anywhere.  Most confounding is the TL chart, of course.  It was
terrific when I first played Traveller in 1982 -- but things have really
changed since then.  Especially in regards to our perception of the
future, much less the \'far future.\'

Much apologies for the needless rambling length of this post.  I\'m going to
stop now.

I though so.  Money-Some say that it makes the world go \'round, some say that 
it is bad for RPGs, some say that it is good from them.  I think that money

That\'s why I asked it as a question, I don\'t know if it would work.
However if it did you wouldn\'t have to take the special precautions
in storing and transporting AM that you would have in other cases.

The idea is that the electrons of the carbon would repel the
anti-proton suspended in the center of the buckyball from all
directions locking it into place where it couldn\'t come in contact
with matter.  You could store the BB\'s at room temp, ship them, and
bounce them around them around as long as you didn\'t "break the
eggs."  Then when you are ready to "burn" the AM, you toss the BB\'s
into a reaction chamber with plenty of matter and break the
eggs...so to speak.

This is probably an unworkable idea, RW, but it might be interesting
in a game.

 Actually, he\'s thinking more along the lines of a a grain silo. Flour, or
 grain dust is also _quite_ explosive when dry and finely divided. They blow 
up
 all the time.

My dad did a sci-fair project about that long time ago, 1E years ago, and I 
did something simular at a camping trip...Flour dried by the camp fire and 
then blowing it into the fire...

 An old set of encyclopedias I used to have had a child\'s demonstration of the
 effect. Take one cardboard oatmeal canister with a small hole in the top.  
Dry
 a teaspoon of flour in a low oven for (IIRC) about an hour. Put the flour 
into
 the box, and shake it up. Hold a lit match near the hole in the top.

Sounds simple enuff, I think I\'ll do this, sounds sainer than the camp fire 
idea.

 BOOM!
 
 Mom comes running into the kitchen, thinking you have killed yourself to find
 fine white powder drifting throughout. Now you _do_ wish you had killed 
yourself...:-)

Don\'t do it when she\'s home.

 Oddly, the encyclopedia ended _it\'s_ description at the BOOM part...

Actually there are a range of them, Mass spec analysis has shown them to range
from about c20 on up to c128 and larger. The most stable (abundant and first
identified) is C60, there is also c70 which is just about as stable, but is
shaped more like a rugby ball than a sphere.

I don\'t know...but I don\'t think so. wouldn\'t electrons and anti-electrons
attract each other? Or do they still both have negative charges? And if they
do, how do you get matter/antimatter to interact, or does annihilation occur
at longer than electron shell distances? (I\'ll admit this is where my physics
training comes up really short)

Actually the work done with using buckyballs as \'containment\' vessels isn\'t so
odd. Zeolite crystals (a widely used industrial catalyst compound) work in
roughly similar fashions. Onme of the things they\'re trying is sticking
various substituents onto some of the carbon atoms, some outside the ball,
some inside. The first compound so synthesised had two short alkane (iirc, may
have been alkyne) chains sticking off of it, on two close or adjacent carbons.
Promptly dubbed a bunnyball :-P

Medical scanners, among other things.  One such scan helped diagnose me as 
post-polio (lotta missing & dying nerve tissue), the one I had most recently 
pinpointed the area where I had a mild stroke a couple weeks back (they think 
a piece of blood clot broke loose; all it did was take out a bit of my \'spam 
filters\' and left me a touch autistic; therapy *should* retrain the \'filters\', 
or so they tell me...).

Ah, well, okay: Starfire is a tactical wargame (alto there is a strat game 
called Imperial Starfire) were a player can control anything from a small 
shuttle(target) to massive Leviathans.  Each ship is part of a ship class, 
with a turn mode and a number of engines needed for 1 movement point.  There 
are fighters, lasers, troop transports, assult shuttles, ALL sorts of 
missiles, data links, CICs, ect.

Exsample ship:
SHX(I)Qs(I)
This is a very small ship (Exploror size) the S in the ship line is a shield, 
to protect the small ship from solar raditaion.  The H is the hold to store 
the ship\'s maintance supplies, the (I) are each engines and the Qs is the 
quarters.  In my words as complex as a wargame should be.  
xxxx
 
 
 
  Has anyone tried to figure out how to use the Shields that were in the 
honor book in traveler? The were sort a like real dense gravity wave that 
pulled light along its effect and dispersed it. But it only covered 2 sides 
from stem to stern. (I think that\'s how you say it.) >>

The "Side Walls" would just act as a super heavy armour that gegerated to

filter _out_, I want to filter _in_, so that it becomes easier to
find good stuff for Freelance Traveller (which means that it
becomes available that much faster.  Freelance Traveller is now
averaging about 125 hits per week, thanks to all you folks who
write good stuff).  If people use tags on certain kinds of posts,
it\'ll be that much easier, even given that I receive the digest
rather than individual messages.

I\'d like to suggest the following:

[Ship] - Specifications for starships, spaceships, space
stations, small craft, etc. - essentially, anything that would be
good material for Freelance Traveller\'s Shipyard.  Optionally,
include a code indicating what format - HG, High Guard; FS,
Fighting Ships (for CT); SS, Shattered Ships (for MT); FFS, Fire,
Fusion, and Steel (TNE); FFS2, Fire, Fusion, and Steel 2 (T4);
GT, GURPS Traveller; et cetera - I\'m sure I missed a couple of
systems in there...

[Weap] - Specifications for personal weapons.  Does _not_ include
the system abuses of Famille Spofulam or the Sayat Board for
Optimization and Operationalization of Munitions; those aren\'t
weapons, they\'re combination suicide machines/terror devices for
the insane.  Use [Gag] or [Abuse] for those. :)  Weapons will
eventually go into a new section, "The Armory" (or maybe
"Arsenal").

[Adv] - Adventures and outlines.  Great fodder for "Active
Measures"

[Rules] - Deviations from the printed rules, or rules articles
covering areas not anticipated by the published rules.  Great for
"Doing It My Way"

[Story] - Stories from the POV of the characters.  May be
whole-cloth fiction, campaign writeups, vignettes, "lost
diaries", and so on.  For "Raconteur\'s Rest".

[Culture] - Any sort of background material that
defines/illustrates a Traveller universe culture.  For
"Kurishdam".  I\'ll open new sections as needed, beyond "Games
People Play", "At Home, We Do It Like This", and "Art and
Entertainment"

[People] - Profiles of individuals that may (or may not - anyone
want to write up Empress Arbellatra?) be encountered in a
campaign.  For "Up Close and Personal".  Groups, such as the
fictitious "Knights of the Great and Powerful Oz" should be
labelled [Culture], although individual members of the order, if
profiled, are [People].

[Stuff] - If it\'s not a weapon, and it\'s not a ship, but a player
could go out and buy it, it\'s a consumer good, i.e., "stuff".
"Stuff" can be found "In A Store Near You".

If you have multimedia files that you\'d like to make available,
write privately to jzeitlin@cyburban.com or freetrav@hotmail.com
to make arrangement to get them to me.

Note: I\'m not proposing this as any sort of a mandate, either
"legal" or "moral".  I\'m just saying that if you do this, it will
make it that much easier to find the good stuff for Freelance
Traveller.

Incidentally, Traveller is now getting its own subsection under
Roleplaying at About.com (formerly MiningCo.com).  Submit your
favorite Traveller sites to roleplaygames.guide@about.com.

Pain is there for a reason:  it lets us know when we\'ve had something
bad happen to us.  There are people born without any sense of touch;
they have to be _really_ careful, _all_ the time, or they don\'t notice
that they\'ve hurt themselves until it\'s too late to repair the damage.

Physical torture yields very unreliable intelligence information.  After
all, if I don\'t believe your answer, and inflict pain upon you to prove
the point, you will eventually tell me what I want to hear.  How will
you know what I want to hear?  Whatever you told me that made me stop
_hurting_ you....

Now, if I have tortured you until you told me what I wanted to hear, how
reliable is that information?  What if you had told me the truth the
first time out, and I just didn\'t believe you?  This is more likely than
is seems; from World War II through Vietnam, over 90% of prisoners of
war told US interrogators the truth as they knew it, simply for the
asking.  (Grenada, Panama, and Iraq have, as far as I can tell, provided
even higher numbers.)  As a 97E4P (airborne qualified US Army
interrogator, rank Sergeant First Class), I know whereof I speak on this
matter.

Besides, as I posted earlier, only amateurs torture prisoners _for
information_.

  I think that would be a cool game for a solo (GM vs 1 Player) campaign.

I at least think I would have a blast playing. Of course I would play mostly science or technical careers.

  As a GM for that kind a game I would have to really plan on doing my homework.

 Well I haven\'t seen T4 yet because I am the only one in the group that buys traveller stuff. And I don\'t have the money to just throw at another game system, when what I got works just fine (Although it is dated).


  The one thing I disliked about Mechwarrior generation is that 2 of my players always make the same character time and time again. I even try and make adventures that play into the weaknesses of their characters, but when they DIE or make up new ones they just change one skill for another, and still wind up with a One dimensional character. And I fear since GT:Traveler is a BUILD you PC system they would just do the same thing.

  So hence the conversion to traveller rules. Now this is only for Generation of the PC\'s in mechwarrior. We would still use the BT rules for mech combat and MW rules for personal combat. Since CT combat rules have nothing to compare with BT.

 Cool \'dogfight\' missiles. I\'ve never seen them in any of the CT rules I have (Which ain\'t many) but you could use regular rules for the fighters but either make it were they have twice the load of missiles or have 2 missile launchers with the same amount of loads. As for the combat damage and to hit chance. Make them ignore the size difference of the fighter, but also make them not do any or little damage to larger ships.

Probably not.  OTOH, flour can be produced at TL: very-low, while
appropriate hydrocarbons for FAE bombs would require TL:
not-quite-as-low.

It\'s no weirder than the hoops you have to jump through on a Mac when
the file "type" is unknown. 

In both cases, the OS is making the *assumption* that files are in

That won\'t prevent the allergic reaction.

If you are proposing this as a means of making them immune to torture,
you\'ve got some major problems. To give you an idea, *all* that leprosy
does is knock out the pain nerves in pretty much the manner you are
thinking of. 

All the horrible scars, rotting, lost fingers and limbs, etc are *all*
due to the simple fact that the leper can\'t feel pain (and certain
other strong sensations. They damage themselves and *don\'t notice*. 

A couple of examples. A man discovered he had leprosy when he fell
asleep while smoking. When he woke up, he noted an odd smell. He\'d been
holding a cigarette between two fingers. It\'d burned down and charred
the hell out of the fingers. He hadn\'t felt a thing.

Another case was a doctor at a leper colony. He was having trouble with
a key, because the lock was stiff. One of the lepers tried and did get
the key turned. He also ripped the hell out of his hand from turning so
hard.

It\'s much simpler to just *carry* oxygen for a "normal" engine.
Hyper-golic fuels are *too* energetic. 

Also, for a ground vehicle, hydrogen peroxide might be a better choice.
It\'s a good monopropellant. Pass it over any of a number of catalysts
and you get a mix of superheated steam and free oxygen. 

You either use the steam straight to run pistons or even a turbine, or
you use the H2O2 as an oxidizer and bring in the exotic atmosphere to
work with it. 

That last is actually a fairly old idea. "Trouble on Titan" (an *old*
SF novel) has a jet plane flying in Titan\'s methane atmosphere. It
sucks in and compresses the methane and sprays in enough *oxygen* to
cause combustion. The engine needs some adjustment, but not nearly as
much as you\'d think. All it cares about is the methane/O2 ratio in the
combustion chamber, not which came from where.

Almost all "exotic" atmospheres will be either oxidizing or reducing.
In an oxidizing atmosphere, you use the local air and supply fuel. In a
reducing atmosphere, the air is "fuel" and you supply the oxidizer. 

The cases where you need self-contained units is a nitrogen/CO2
atmosphere (earth before photosynthesis, Venus now)

Anyway, if the local atmosphere is oxidizing *or* reducing, engines
that use the local atmosphere are both possible, and simpler than
self-contained units.

Self contained units are probably fairly common for use on worlds with
"neutral" atmospheres, and on worlds with vacuum or very thin
atmospheres. I\'m not sure if self-contained or superchargers would be
better for "thin" atmospheres.

But in any case H202 is a *lot* safer than hydrazine or nitrogen
tetroxide. Hydraxine is *highly* toxic. Nitrogen tetroxide is actually
listed as a poison gas *and* is corrosive (add water and you get nitric
acid). 

With all three you are going to get a nasty mess if you spill fuel or
crack the fuel tanks. With Hydrazine and nitogen tetroxide, you have a
*poisonous* mess, and if they contact each other, it goes *boom*. 

With H2O2, it\'s not poisonous, though it will eat organic materials
given half a chance. And there *is* a fair chance of a spill going off.
But you can "tame" H2O2 by mixing in some distilled water. 40% is
probably *too* tame. And 80% is pretty damn lively. 

Oh yeah, hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide bioth contain a *lot* of
nitrogen. Which tends to be one of the harder to get life support
gases. Hydrogen and oxygen are easy.

	Okay, everybody seems to be missing my point--remember I\'ve said "an 
important part of the game"  and "a way of gauging"  not "the most important 
part" or  "the best way of gauging".   The way  money works to gauge player 
interaction with society is as follows:  The imperium is defined as a 
economic community of worlds.  When a traveller manages to make money on his 
travels he has used the Imperium for the intention it was created for.  When 
characters use money-making opportunities and actually make money they are 
aligning themselves with the forces of the econmies of the worlds, fufliing 
needs and desires of the citizens and are being properly rewarded for it. 
	
	A mercenary company who works pro bono to support a revolution and 
goes broke because of it, is bucking the status quo, and because it has run 
out of money it by definition has "not interacted well with the society".  
This is not the same thing as saying they haven\'t done a good (or perhaps 
evil) thing--separate questions entirely.  There\'s nothing to say that a 
character or characters really want to interact well with society either.  
They may be loners or commies or something like that and only get their joy 
when the Imperium is thwarted, they won\'t interact well with society and so 
won\'t make any money.

	My original point is that in a Traveller game, the players must plan 
ahead to see if they can afford the munitions and salaries to support the 
unit during the revolution; this is a real concern of the players as they 
plan.  When a movie is made, the money required to do this (in the story) is 
not a real concern of the author/director --if the story requires them to 
have enough, they have enough and vice-versa.

Falkenberg\'s Legion)?   Money is the means to achieve the building of the 
unit, and it is the objective gauge of how far their goal has come.

My aim in running a game is to make the PC\'s feel that they are in control of 
their destinies.  I almost never have one single adventure or path set up in

rewards will be different based on that choice.  If you don\'t give the pc\'s 
the ability to take or refuse jobs based on economic considerations, they 
don\'t feel free, like they\'re pursuing their own agendas.  I guess having

	One player has said that in most games the players react to what the

games the players are forced to act, and the world reacts.  That\'s my aim, so 
the player\'s goals run the game--because that\'s the kind of game I\'d like to

Belief isn\'t the point - legally Strephon is still Emperor, Dulinor is
wanted for murder of the Imperial spouse and heir, plus the Aslan
ambassador. Lucan is an opportunist murderer. The Moot will not be
suspended if Dulinor succeeds because it would be the opposite of his
beliefs, so the evidence that Strephon lives will surely come out.

This will probably come to civil war anyway, with Dulinor squaring up
against Strephon. The big issue is whether the Moots supports him or not...

I\'ve always thought a varient on the 2nd civil war, (or even the same as
canon) with hard times coupled to it was more interesting. Virus kind of

Very OT - Anyone play Myth:TFL out there? I\'ve got two problems at the
moment - 1) I had to clean reinstall my system a month or two ago and only
have copies of the files from the \'save folder\' (MacOS version). I can\'t
get the system to acknowledge them. Anyone know how? 2ndly, how do you
complete the 5th(?) scenario - the one where you are escaping from the
city, and start by the walls. You get hit by a three sided attack amongst
the craters, which is survivable, but the road out runs past a hill with a
horde of Gridaksma Balde wielding Myrmidons. I suspect that winning
requires luring them to a crater where your archers and or dwarves can
finish them off, but haven\'t managed to do it. Any tips welcome! (Please
respond off list).

Well, if you look at B5 several of the episodes were drive by people
wanting to make a profit, especially those involving Alien artifacts.
Smuggling also came into it. The main characters were pretty much untouched
(being employed by the Station) however examples of financial issues
include:

1) The crew pulling a scam to keep their larger quarters when ordered to
pay for them.
2) Zack Allen joining Nightwatch for the extra money.
3) Lyta Alexander trying to set up as a freelance Psion for business to
keep her income.

of course, once the station broke from the Earth Alliance we had Ivanova
trying to set up commercial deals with smugglers etc to keep funds and
supplies coming.

You could argue that B5 isn\'t a film, but it does have 3 TV Movies...

Looks like there will be at least a half-dozen, plus some small craft. 
Starships includes both an expanded design system (more modules at
different TLs, plus more options for hull design and so forth) and a
section on typical "adventure-class" ships, including deck plans.  

To Loren or anyone else at SJG reading this: Please put a text description
of the deck plans in Starships.  It\'s absolutely infuriating to look at a
deck plan and not have any idea what some spaces are.  (See especially the
Broadsword in Star Mercs.  Utterly incomprehensible.)  On a related point,
try lightening up the hex pattern; as printed now it is sometimes hard to
see bulkheads and doors when they coincide with the hex edges.

ISTR that Starships will have deckplans clipart in lieu of some of the
traditional SJG illustrations.  I\'m just hoping the eventual Pyramid
designer\'s notes will include computer versions of same.

This is technically correct.  However, if you are interested in maintaining
a CT feel, I\'d tend to ignore the TL modifiers for GTL 10-12 (roughly CTL
11-15), at least in operator skills.  There seems to be a large degree of
standardization in interfaces and so forth at those TLs, with most systems
being refinements of older tech rather than using new basic principles. 
Also, it really simplifies game play.  otherwise, your ex-Imperial Navy
pilot (Pilot/TL12-15) is just barely competent to fly a TL10 freighter
(effective skill 12).  Not too much fun.

I don\'t think this would work. IIRC the field intensity inside a charged
sphere is uniform, so there would be no net force holding the antiproton
anywhere.

Aaaack blech! read the book \'The Dogs of War\', \'tis vastly better than the

closer to the flavor.

While on the subject, read \'Day of the Jackal\'...someone recently posted a

No, my version doesn\'t end with the Moot suspended; Rather, it confirms
Dulinor, based on the right of assasination, as the Emperor. _NOW_ what
happens...if Strephon shows up you have two duly recognized Emperors.

When Dulinor has Strephons body, with the correct genetic map right there in 
evidence? It will be up to the \'erstwhile\' Strephon to prove who he is.

in the Spinward Marches before and into the 5th Frontier War.  The game
could be classified as a mercenary campaign with a covert agenda, they
crewed a Broadsword class Merc cruiser indirectly owned by Norris.  As with
most GMs there  were a few items added to the game, typically weapons
systems, which were nonstandard. It was my theory that as a general rule of
weapons design and play that any innovative weapons system introduced should
have technology specific counter measures introduced approximately one tech
level behind it.  Thus for example the introduction of jet engines in WWII
was followed by the introduction of heat seeking missiles within
approximately one tech level.  I assumed, based on the above stated model,
that with the introduction of grav vehicles approximately one tech level
later crude "grav seeking" missiles would appear.    I had intended to write
up an article "Weapons of the Fifth Frontier War".   I am curious if anyone
would be interested in corresponding privately on the subject.

I believe that\'s what MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) used to be 
called. Maybe patients didn\'t like the "nuclear" part.

(I heard it as a joke that they changed the name because patients asking

Make it s GIF instead.  Basically, JPG is better for lots of colors,

Asking for permission is always a good idea.  But if you made the
map yourself, not necessary.  If you use the wrods "Traveller" or
"Gurps: Traveller", I recommend you include (R) symbol and note
somewhere in the fine print that those are registered trademarks
of Far Future Enterprises and SJG, respectively.

The database is yours if you created it.

Profit is not necessarily correlated with size.  There are economies of
scale on one side (increasing profits), but IIRC from my Anit-trust Law
courses, excess capacity and management overhead tend to decrease
profits (increase costs) as well.

Average profit be anything.  Most economic analysis is done at the
a minimal profit level.  A MegaCorp making .01% profit is still
profitable.  It may not be generating enough profits for increased
capitalization or expansion, but its still a profitable business.

Sustainable profit isn\'t really a useful term.  Whats important is the size
of
the market.  That limits your expansion because you can only sell what
the market will buy.  If you increase supply too much, you\'re wasting your
resources.  In the abstract, the monopoly is the most profitable route to
go, if you can afford the costs of creating and maintaining one.  You have
to be in a position to undercut all rivals and potential rivals, so much so
that
it wouldn\'t be profitable for anyone else to even enter the market.  That
means you\'ve got to keep your price low and that will limit the profits
you can gouge from the consumers.

One thing to remember in the Traveller context.  The 3I is a very
slow growth economy.  So low sustainable profits are probably
the norm for the MegaCorps.  If I were running Oberlindes, or Tukera,
etc., I had a stable 1% profit rate, I\'d be very happy.

Jim and Ian can comment more accurately I\'m sure.

I have put the far trader costs & revenues into a spreadsheet and come up with
profit figures on large optimized ships* in excess of 100%. This is not the
figure you should be looking at however.

You should be looking at return on investment (ROI). Effectively this is the
interest rate you get from investing your money in the business.  For a starship
your investment is 20% of the ships price tag, in this example about 600 MCr.
The profit per year is about 400 MCr so ROI is between 60 & 70%, which is very
nice indeed. Long term gains in the real world stock market would be around
15%.  Though I suppose some reduction should occur due to the overhead of the
shipping lines ground based operations.  

If this is typical then Imperial corporations are growing at around 60% a year
and someone is getting very rich indeed!

Have I missed something here?  This sounds a little too cosy.

Note that jump masking and the time you spend in port makes a huge difference to
the figures. If you choose only unmasked routes and spend only 2 days in port
then your return on investment would approximately double. So you would put huge
amounts of effort in ensuring you take minimally masked routes and minimizing
port time.

You can see a preview of the Chronor subsector at:

It will be black stars on white background with grey

Actual size will be about 22" x 34" with border.

Two things I need:
1) Proofers.  I\'m using GT:BtC and the SM map from

Navy bases.  (In the example above, I know I need to
move some Zhodani navy bases so they aren\'t obscured
by the X-boat routes)..

2) Ideas for border text.  Primarily the bottom.  The side
border will have the subsector grid and name list as well
as the map legend, but there will still be some space
there:  19" x 5".  I might trim that space a bit for a big label,
but its still plenty of space for some useful text.  I was thinking
a timeline might be nice there. But any other ideas (and writers)
are welcome.

3) Opinions:  Political borders or not?

Once its all done, it would be very easy for me to add
trade routes.  But I\'m not going to do the trade routes
myself, and I understand others are working on that.

The 20% investment is only the down payment on the ship.  You have to
continually pay off the mortgage.  IIRC, the total amount invested in a
ship ends up being 220% of the purchase price.

Yes.  I intend to  But only for the parsecs that have systems.
Putting them off until the end.  I\'ll have to experiment with
superimposing them over X-boat routes (and trade routes)
or simply omitting them (ala the SM map in Darrians AM).

The other thing missing is Tech Level.

Ages ago I went through my Book 8 and added errata as I found them, basing
a lot of stuff on the figures in the MT Ref\'s manual. Since the same people
wrote both books, I thought this was a reasonable approach. ;-)  Here is my
(non-exhaustive ;-) list.

- -+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
TRAVELLER _BOOK 8: ROBOTS_ ERRATA

The errata shown are only the *changes* or *additions* to what is in the
book, the rest of the surroundng text is unchanged.

NOTE: I have noted the source of each errata item. If it is in [brackets]
is is IMHO; all others are official.

p 26 "Wheels require at least 1.5% of chassis volume."

p 26 "Tracks require at least 2.0% of chassis volume."

p27 [mine] Multiply all chassis prices by 0.4, e.g. URP A should only cost
Cr1400.
(I think this is from comparing Bk8 with Striker or MT)

p27 [mine] Chassis Configuration Table
URP 1 Box Price Mod 0.6
URP 1 Needle/Wedge Price Mod x1.2
URP 2 Cylinder Price Mod Nil (Cone still 1.1)
(based on MT config table)

p27 Locomotion: Suspensions (Grav, Air Cushion)
URP C only available at TL 7
URP D only available at TL 9
URP E only available at TL 10
URP F only available at TL 12
Note that the values shown are for one unit of each suspension type (i.e.
these are the minimum values).

p27 Locomotion: Suspensions (Legs, Tracks, Wheels)
            Power
Each Leg    40kW
Track           30kW
Wheels      20kW
Each unit is per kW of power plant output.

8    Arm, very light
7    Arm, light
6    Arm, medium
5    Arm, heavy
12   Tentacle, very light

11   Tentacle, medium
10   Tentacle, heavy
Note that touch sensors are already built into all arms and tentacles.
(_101 Robots_, p2)
Volume = weight.

p29 Fundamental Logic Programs [mine, based on the text and MT TL tables]
Low Artificial Intel TL 16
High Artificial Intel TL 17+
Note that CPU = Parallel + Synap; e.g. URP 5, 30 CPU = 2 Parallel + 28

Apart from the listed figures, volume = weight x 2.
Note that Touch Sensors are already built into all arms and tentacles; the
values in the original table are only for the remainder of the body. This
explains why these figures are multiplied by the chassis size. (_101

have a volume = weight x 2). This should be volume = weight (included in
the _Book 8_ errata, above).

Sure, cost and bureaucracy.  Arbellatra\'s original x-boat network was a
huge undertaking, so they pared costs to the bone.  M-drive was one victim.
  (A survival low berth for the crew was another.)  Since then,
bureaucratic inertia has stalled the introduction of a revised design.  The
main "argument" is that adding an M-drive would enlarge the number of spare
parts the x-boat network would have to stock and require M-drive mechanics
aboard the tenders, making the whole system more expensive to operate. 
Besides, new J-6 x-boats with limited M-drive are just around the corner. 
Of course, they\'ve been just around the corner for centuries and no, I
don\'t want to start that particular debate again.

Of course, the GT version doesn\'t have the second problem; a stateroom
includes extended LS that will last as long as the power supply holds
out(c. 200 years from activation)

 Physical torture yields very unreliable intelligence information.  After
 all, if I don\'t believe your answer, and inflict pain upon you to prove

 you know what I want to hear?  Whatever you told me that made me stop

 Now, if I have tortured you until you told me what I wanted to hear, how
 reliable is that information?  What if you had told me the truth the
 first time out, and I just didn\'t believe you?  This is more likely than
 is seems; from World War II through Vietnam, over 90% of prisoners of
 war told US interrogators the truth as they knew it, simply for the
 asking.  (Grenada, Panama, and Iraq have, as far as I can tell, provided
 even higher numbers.)  As a 97E4P (airborne qualified US Army

 That\'s why I asked it as a question, I don\'t know if it would work.
 However if it did you wouldn\'t have to take the special precautions
 in storing and transporting AM that you would have in other cases.
 
 The idea is that the electrons of the carbon would repel the
 anti-proton suspended in the center of the buckyball from all
 directions locking it into place where it couldn\'t come in contact
 with matter.  You could store the BB\'s at room temp, ship them, and
 bounce them around them around as long as you didn\'t "break the
 eggs."  Then when you are ready to "burn" the AM, you toss the BB\'s
 into a reaction chamber with plenty of matter and break the
 eggs...so to speak.

xxxx
Ah, the positron, yes, I do belive that it would work.

 This is probably an unworkable idea, RW, but it might be interesting
 in a game. >>

There are a lot of people on this list who are much more quilified to respond

Greetings again Paul,
I own the same CD, and I have a program concluded the txt files that were with
the files with no extentions were indeed Mac Word files, so I will assume the
graphic files with the txt files are Mac produced as well. I could not open and
view them with nothing that I own. However, if you go one directory up, you
will find all the graphic files in GIF format.

Why go to all the trouble of rewiring peoples\' nervous systems to remove
or limit their response to pain, when I\'ve already pointed out that
information gained through physical torture is unreliable?  Only amateur
interrogators will expect to get reliable information by using physical
torture, and amateurs are unlikely to know how effectively to question
prisoners to gain the desired information.

Just take it as a given that, without specialized training (little of
which has to do with enduring physical torture), nine out of ten
prisoners of war will answer any questions, truthfully and to the best
of their ability, without any need to persuade them to do so. 
(Unfortunately, I can\'t describe the US Department of Defense approved
resistance to interrogation techniques in this forum [they\'re
classified].)

Of course, the 90% figure applies to 20th century Solomani, and would
need to be adjusted (either up or down) to other societies and/or
species.  I wouldn\'t expect the numbers to vary more than, say, ten
percent in either direction, although a given interrogator would need to
be extensively schooled to detect deception in races other than
his/her/its own.

> 
> Other than drugs how do you get info out of them?

Simple:  I ask questions.  The enemy prisoners of war answer them.  It
seems counter-intuitive, but prisoners of war generally _will_ answer
questions without any attempt to resist or deceive.

Trouble is, dust explosions need to be confined to be effective.  That\'s
why the experiment earlier in the thread required the cardboard oatmeal
box.  You can take out a building or other confined space, but not a
target in the open.

There are other methods of maintaining a monopoly.  A couple that may be
relevant include:

- - controlling the relevant patents (and so preventing the competitors from
entering the market) and
- - have an exclusive right to a particular market  (Does the Imperial throne
have this power?)
- - engage in non-price based competition to keep competitors out.  This could
include anything from adding new features to an existing product to keep the
competitor looking old to outright attacks (rumour, innuendo and sabotage).

The last could provide some good plot hooks :)

It\'s hard to find references to freezing points at other than
"standard" (1 atm) pressure. 

But CO2 should definitely freeze out on at least *part* of the planet.
It *may* be liquid in some places, but I\'m not sure. 

I\'d advise going to a library and thumbing thru the CRC Handbook of
Physics and Chemistry. It\'s got two *huge* sections that are useful for
this. One is properties of Inorganic chemicals, the other is properties
of Organic chemicals. 

The properties you want to check are the "critical temperature" and the
"critical pressure". A gas *cannot* be liquefied at temps above the
critical temperature. And the pressure required to liquefy it *at* the
critical temperature is the critical pressure.

Freezing *generally* doesn\'t depend on pressure. 

I\'m pretty sure that things like oxygen and nitrogen *won\'t* freeze
under the conditions specified, heck, they probably won\'t even liquefy.

But the CO2 might prove *very* interesting. Methane and ammonia are a
couple of other things to check, but they *shouldn\'t* be present in an
atmosphere with any substantial percentage of oxygen. 

BTW, don\'t forget that at 25 atmospheres, the percentage of O2 in the
air had best be *very* low, or else it\'ll be *toxic*. 

Lets see. 1 atm = 15 psi, so 25 atm = 375 psi. You only need 3 psi of
O2 to breathe comfortably, 3/375 = 1/125 = .8%. So .8% O2 is all you
need to make the atmosphere breathable. At a guess, more than 3% will
make it toxic. 

Oh yeah, if the characters are either wading thru a pool of liquid CO2,
or get caught in CO2 "rain" (unlikely) the CO2 evaporating from contact
with their environment suits out to be a significant hazard. Even if
they are still getting enough O2, the CO2 is what triggers the
breathing reflex. So they could start panting or hyperventilate. And
CO2 is toxic in sufficiently high concentrations. 

Oh yeah, if they are going thru an area where the conditions have
frozen out the CO2, it *may* be possible for them to have breathing
problems due to the low CO2 level. Not likely, but possible.

Nope. It\'s just the same for gravity. The net force inside a hollow
sphere is *zero*. It takes calculus to prove, but what it amounts to is
that for *any* position inside the sphere, the forces from the near
side and the far side are opposite and equal. 

It\'s even stranger for a solid sphere of uniform density. Assuming that
you are a "ghost" that can pass thru the material without any trouble,
inside a solid sphere, you\'ll find that the gravitational attraction
varies *linearly* from full strength at the surface to 0 in the center.

Given the fact that the attraction inside a hollow sphere *is* zero,
it\'s not hard to work out that second result. You can just ignore the
portions of the sphere that are farther out than you are. 

You can even work out the attraction for a sphere of *non*-uniform
density this way. If we had an idea of how the density of Jupiter
varies with the radius, we could work out how the gravity varied as you
moved from the cloud tops to the core.

	Actually, it has *everything* to do with Winblows ... I\'ve run into
this problem several times. Lord Bill and his evil minions decided
that the standard for long file names on CDs (ISO 9660 with Rockridge
extensions) wasn\'t good enough for them (translation: everybody else
used it, and would be able to read it). So Winblows deliberately uses
a different way, AND can\'t read the standard. Which sucks when most
thirdparty stuff is written to the standard. So if I\'ve got a CD
(several, actually) with documentation in HTML on it, I can\'t use it
... when I click a link, the browser properly asks the operating
system to please fetch "Newfile.html" ... because that\'s what the
link is.  But the operating system, ignoring the LFN extensions,
can\'t see that file.

It\'s certainly getting there, closer every day.  I just got through installing 
SuSe 6.1 on a virgin HD.  I was a bit miffed at all the *JUNK* it wanted to 
put on, and sendmail *still* isn\'t the easiest thing in the world to configure 
and deal with, but the KDE interface is intriguing, and GIMP *finally* works 
correctly for me now.

FWIW, I usually use Red Hat 4.x, and will probably end up going back to Red 
Hat 6.0 Real Soon Now.  IMNSFBHO, a Linux system that *needs* 5 CDs to 
*install* is a bit much, but it\'s got *everything* anybody could concieveably 
want...

I did draw the map myself. It took a bit and you would be surprised 
at the number of errors I found. Most of the Far Trader eratta 
for the trade info, I found and a slew of mis-numbered hexes and 
a mis-spelling or two. Maybe I will get an hinorable mention in

I will see that they have the apropriate copyright notations and

I suggest leaving the borders out. That way, the map can be used for more
milieu. Personally, I\'m very much looking forward to its completion, because my
group is about to enter the Fifth Frontier War. Having borders on the map would
confuse things.

Since you\'re interested, I\'ll list my _Far Trader_ illustrations below,
with a short description of each. The names are just filenames, really,
rather than \'captions\' per s, with only the occasional bit of irony thrown
in:

"Robots" -- Crazy Liaashi\'s Used Robots

"Hand Warmers" -- Customs inspector and Captain opening cargo container
full of, uh, "Hand Warmers"...

"Cargo Drop" -- Far Trader on the tarmac, with Vargr crane operator
accidentally dropping crates.

"Biohazard" -- K\'kree with leaking cargo containers marked with biohazard
symbols.

"Crew Lounge" -- The common area of a trader, full of bored, cranky
crewmembers, in mid-Jump. The Vargr and crewman are playing some kind of 3D
strategy game (Gheta?). The "movie" on the big screen is actually one of my
illustrations for Star Mercs.

"Lost" -- two Travellers with map, arguing over which way to go in
maze-like low-tech city.

"Outpost" -- a Far Trader landing near a frontier outpost, with jubilant
space-suited figures. The suggestion being that ships from outsystem are
extremely rare here.

"Hijacking" -- Trader captain with pistol, reacting to security alert on
monitor.  (I was watching the film "Naked" on TV while I drew this, and the
Captain is loosely based on British actor David Thewliss -- who is utterly
brilliant in the film. Not that it has *anything* to do with the
illustration...)

"Paperwork" -- Trader captain in cramped quarters piled high with paperwork.

"Arms Fair" -- K\'kree arms dealer with various firearms.

"Bar Fight" -- Two-fisted action, flying beermugs and all.

"Dead Meat" -- Stupid butcher offering a freshly killed duck to a Kkree.
Note the four-legged chicken on the chopping block.

Best,

Glenn

A better solution might be to make the CD in dual-format.

I just assume that the operating system, like Windows, chews up most

Gravity wave detection is something that has been dealt with in Bruce
Macintosh\'s Definitive Sensor Rules.

Basically, they are too big to put in missiles. However, the bad news for
grav tankers is that a fairly cheap sensor (MCr100 or so) individually
resolves grav tanks at continental range.

One would assume you then use other weapons to actually blow up the
preumably point-defense armed tanks.

Ditzie has got the TL12 fusion-gun armed helicopter nearly finished. It\'s
designed to solve this problem by not using grav or nuclear technologues.

I\'m interested. Under what conditions ? What design of ship ? How many

Yes. This is part of why jump masking sucks IMO - it results in lots of
additional complication, for very little result (the market would of course
adjust rates to masked and non-masked worlds - if it takes 11 days to get
to X and 7 days to get to Y, you will be paid about 11/7 times more to go
to X than Y).

Missiles in Trav generallywork by using X-ray detonation lasers - you just
cant get an impact against military ships doing anything else. I suppose
you could build a short duration \'dash pack\' missile, but I think it owuld
be more effective to use in a counter-missile role (missiles dont tend to
mount point defenses). A cheap combustion laser can be built under FFS2,
and replace an x-ray det laser.

If you want a light fighter, many many moons ago I put out a RFT for the
10-20 dton Wasp design. A very helpful person designed it for me, but I
lost the design when my old hard drive with my mail archives died - does

What I want is something that is possible at TL6, cheap and insanely

One of my theories is that the Flexii have a workable deposit of nitrogen
tetraoxide somewhere near their sealed city - possibly in a volcanically
active area.

I\'m figuring piston ignition. It isnt an actual \'rocket bike\', although the
Tourist Model might be.

I\'m not a chemist. Is chlorine oxidizing or reducing ?

OK. Give me a reaction that works for a piston engine in a chlorine-rich
Exotic atmosphere (Flexos is listed as \'exotic\' rather than \'insidious\', so
I\'m inclined to think it isnt a horribly lethal chemical soup, just a
reasonably lethal chemical soup).

Well, IMTU, it works sorta like this:

Most worlds have one or two bars near or in the extrality zone that cater
to scouts and ex-scouts (IMTU, the SM has a chain called "The Dead
Spacer"); all dead spacer\'s are run by a local ex-scout, but owned by a
private-stock company with the bylaw tthat only a scout may buy in. They
will serve anybody. Most scouts on a world will at least check in at the
spacer... additionally, it serves as a point of contact for many scouts
who\'ve settled down: Ask the barkeep for the contact list (names only),
tell him who you want, he calls them, and gives them your contact info.

  I thought the Det-lasers are a new addition to the rules (TNE on). I\'ve
always IMTU had the CT missiles compared to the missiles of today. With
very fast engines (10-20 G\'s) with superior handling and ECM/ECCM built in.
If a sidewinder missile could catch a fighter going mk1-2 and jigging and
zagging and hit, why couldn\'t a Hi-Tech missile in space do the same thing?
Besides a Det-missile waists a lot of it\'s warhead strength (at least it
would seem so) in converting it to a laser. So it would seem that if a
missile were to deliver its warhead directly more damage would be done for
the same size warhead.
  But then again, I am not a scientist or engineer. And the fact that we
don\'t have any real world example\'s of Det-Lasers to go by I could be
mistaken.

Problem #1: the effect of jump masking is a function of time -- the
configuration changes as the mainworld goes through its local year. 

Problem #2: the effect is different for every system within jump range
[this is an assumption based on a 3D model, but as there is no evidence
either for or against it, it will have to do].

The math isn\'t terribly complicated (especially if you assume circular
orbits) but without some kind of conversion from 3D reality to 2D Traveller
map there\'s no good way to represent it. Hence the random walk method. 

If we were starting over from oh, say, 1982 (before the publication of Book
6: Scouts) and assuming jump masking is here to stay, I\'d lobby for skewing
the stellar frequency table for inhabited systems heavily towards the F5
through K5 stars. This would represent the small fraction of stars that are
actually present on a Traveller map, provide some justification for
colonies on cruddy worlds ("Well, the *star* was nice, anyway..."), and
incidently cut the occurance of jump masking to less than half. It\'s all
those M-class stars that make the average so high.

Even a circular orbit could be "unmasked" depending on the normal to the
system\'s orbit.  This particularly applies to 3D where you might enter a system
from "below".  In fact, unless the star\'s 100D limit encompasses the target
planet, a "random" orbital normal will rarely mask a target planet.  Those jumps
that do result in potential maskings (where jump vector is near the plane of the
ecliptic) can be charted and timed so as to avoid those pesky accidental
maskings.

As to the 3D conversion of the 2D maps, I\'ve got a method to convert the 4 digit
2D coordinates into 3D space, but "close" systems may not be so in the
conversion and you can just about forget about those rifts.  For those making
random sectors, you\'d have to come up with new stellar probabilities because the
existing ones would almost  guarantee a system within 3 pc even in a rift.

 It\'s even stranger for a solid sphere of uniform density. Assuming that
 you are a "ghost" that can pass thru the material without any trouble,
 inside a solid sphere, you\'ll find that the gravitational attraction
 varies *linearly* from full strength at the surface to 0 in the center.

Interesting, eh?  Now if you compact it...

 Given the fact that the attraction inside a hollow sphere *is* zero,
 it\'s not hard to work out that second result. You can just ignore the
 portions of the sphere that are farther out than you are. 
 
 You can even work out the attraction for a sphere of *non*-uniform

  Oh. But when do PDL\'s become available? Is that something introduced in
MT or T4? I know that I have allowed my players the opportunity to fire
there lasers at Missiles in lew of firing at the other ship, but as I see
it. Firing at a small object that is using active Evasion maneuvers would
be extremely hard to hit.

I generated up a sector map for a wargame I was running (Fifth Millennium)
- - basically, it was the Solomani Rim. I tried a number of formats (TIF,
GIF, JPG and BMP) and was lucky to get the map less than 1.5Mb in size. I
think the smallest I managed was 800kb when I\'d Stuffed it after generation.

I then switched to Illustrator and generated the map as a vector file (took
a while to do) and saved it out as a PDF which was <500kB on completion.

This was helped a lot by someone on the TWG (Andrew Akins IIRC) who posted
the sector and subsector grids as an EPS file).

There\'s an example of the subsector file on the BITS website Archive page
(Sylea in MO).

I checked with Marc Miller if it was okay to use the map. He responded that
as long as it was not for profit, and I put the FFE disclaimer on
trademark, it was okay. I suggest you contact him and check. He responded
within a week, IIRC.

The problem is in the Laws of Physics:

speed of light             (c) 300,000 km/s
acceleration of missile    (a)   1,000 G
target range               (r)   1,000 km
time available for evasion (t)     6.7 ms
maximum evasion distance   (d)      22 cm

where t = 2r/c
      d = (1/2)at^2
        = 2ar^2/c^2

The problem is that the r^2/c^2 term dominates all realistic values
of acceleration until the distance is into the significant fraction
of a light second.

And if you haven\'t heard of PDL\'s in CT, then I haven\'t heard of 1,000G
missiles  in CT either. Your standard 6G6 missile can evade by 22 cm at
a distance of 13,000km.

And don\'t forget, this is maximum evasion - max acceleration perpendicular
to line of flight in one direction for the entire period between lidar
pulse and laser pulse.

This also tends to be along the longest dimension of the missile and
most long range missiles will be more than 22cm long.

The net result is that PDLs destroy contact missiles (including those
that fragment at a few hundred km) at a rate equal to their ROF.

My assumption is that in High Guard, this is why your factor 1-4 laser
turret defends against a factor 1-2 missile attack from a fighter as one
die roll. To get factor 2 missile, your fighter fires ALL its missiles
in one go.

"Broken" fighter designs which fire dozens of missiles are not legal
under High Guard and are easilly dealt with by FFS laser turrets that
can destroy *thousands* of missiles per turn.

Yes I thought of this, but the mortgage payments are subsumed in the operating
costs of the business. So you are getting a return as soon as you have paid the
initial 20%, and your revenues are covering your mortgage payments the same as
any other cost.

I have just checked with my accountant sister-in-law and she says that if I want
to do it this way then I should use cost to date, including all direct costs
(e.g. maintenance, spares, etc.) to calculate the return. No lets not do that...

I think this means we are both right but at different times!

oxidizing, just not as good as oxygen but the combustion byproducts

1x H2 + 1x Cl2 = 2x HCl (just add water to get Hydrocloric acid)

1x CH4 + 4x Cl2 = 4x HCl + 1x CCl4

Tetrachloromethane, the solvent used in dry cleaning?

And if there is incomplete combustion, several possibilities, including:

1x C2H6 + 3x Cl2 = 3x HCl + 1x C2H3Cl3

The last of these has several forms, including 1,1,1-Trichloroethane
which is the solvent that seems to have been banned from all those
liquid paper products.

Considering also that chlorine is used to make bleach: it might
not last long but at least your uniform will be clean. ;-)

In gif format, the full sector is 224k. This is, of course, with 
the trade routes partly done.

You can.

You probably have to.

It\'s probably already in the calculations.

Unless your jammer missiles have decent manoeuvre, my point defence
can destroy them even further out than the real missiles.

So you might as well save the money you spent on the electronics,
in much the same way as KKMs save money by not having warheads.

The problem is one of cost. Beyond a certain point, it will be cheaper
to attack your enemy using a beam weapon which has effectively infinite
reloads rather than giving them target practice with some missiles.

There are plenty of good reasons to have missiles:

	to attack installations without manoeuvre,
	to finish off crippled ships,
	to attack ships that don\'t fit lasers "\'cause there\'s no point"
	to attack J-1 civilian free traders.

The J-1 free traders are particularly vulnerable because they don\'t
have a lot of free power for weapons - especially when trying to
jump or evade.

Civilians in general are good targets, especially if you assume that
Famile Spofulam products violate Imperial Laws regulating the civilian
use of military weapons, or that the use of FS equiped freighters
on the Imperial borders could be considered an act of war. ;-)

Does it have an emulator that can run my games (DOS, Win3.1, Win95)? If not,
then it doesn\'t have everything *I* want. I want an OS that will run the

some of my
game and multimedia software.)

ObTrav: In the 3I, is there one universal standard computer OS (like there
seems to be in Star Trek, Babylon 5, and other SF universes) or are there
competing OS from which people can pick and choose?

Already taken into account in the math that produced the tables in Far

Your sense of scale is off somewhat: the 100D limit of a star is *huge*,
and it may take months for an average planet to move in and out of the
mask.

Sidewinders do not have to worry about lightspeed interception.  Lasers
used as missle defence will destroy most missles before contact.  The
loss in efficiency in Det-laser warheads is more than made up by the
increase in hits.

Yes, how they\'ll do it in the Imperium: Grav technology. It should be trivial,
once you have the technology for making grav compensation in floors, to make a
grav container for AM, possibly even a sphere turned inside out, where the
gravity potential is highest in the interior.

Just make really sure the vessel is holding a really good vacuum, and the
power doesn\'t fail.

In fact, it\'s likely that AM could be used to produce the best vacuums
possible. you could probably achieve extremely high vacuum efficiencies by
injecting small amounts of AM into the vessel. As it reacts with normal
matter, the vacuum gets better and better. At sufficient TL\'s this will be far
greater than what you could achieve with pumps alone.

What you would _do_ with such near perfect vacuums? I don\'t know.

I tried to be as standard as possible in my design, and as simple as possible in
delivery strategy, for example:


Ship Design: GTL 10, 20000 DT USL, 100 DR, 200 turrets (empty), Command Bridge,
Engineering, 40 Utility, 927 Manouver, 600 Jump, 4000 Fuel, 15 Fuel Processors,
45 Staterooms, Cargo 14632 (including turret spaces).

5 Bridge Crew, 39 Engineers, 1 Cargo master.

Emass 14006.7, LMass 87166.7, Cost MCr 2736.998, HP 420000, Hull Size
Modifier:+12
Accel 0.43 Gs (2.65 Gs empty), Jump 2, Air Speed  0


Delivery strategy & Economic Parameters:

Cargo transfer from Highport/Orbit to Highport/Orbit. 
95% loading.
70 Hours Manouvering per Jump (transfer from source orbit/highport to Jump point
& destination jump point to highport/orbit - assuming average jump masking)
60 hours in port (probably too long - I used 48 hours in the original posting)
28.3 Jumps per year (from above)

Revenue/Jump: 15290.42 KCr (14632 Cargo at Cr550 per Parsec minus Cr20 per jump 
lighterage fees.) Cr550 is around the mid-price quoted in Far trader for liners. 

Costs/Jump (KCr):
    28.67 Salaries (might be a bit high)
  4843.85 Mortgage
   400    Fuel (unrefined - not mentioned in Far Trader)
   193.75 Maintenance & Spares set-aside
   400.5  Berthing & Starport fee

  5866.78 Total Cost per Jump

Giving a profit of 160.6 percent, and a first year return on investment of
around 50%. 

If you don\'t use jump masking then this same design would be making 34 jumps
per year and 206 percent profit.

Design Notes:
 I have included standard software.
 Having empty turrets increases profitability.
 Optimal m-drive size comes out at around 0.4 Gees (trade off of cargo space v
more jumps per year). Fewer, heavier laden, jumps are probably cheaper on ground
support facilities too.
 You could stay less time in port, increasing profitability.
 You could make the crew share staterooms, increasing profitability.
 I have not included any sub-craft, e.g. a ships boat/lifeboat.
 I haven\'t including any costs for ground facilities, insurance, etc.
 A more complicated delivery strategy, could perhaps increase profitability.
 I used 100% loading in my acceleration figures, 95% would increase jumps per
year.

What else do you want to know?

Tell me what I have missed, and what you think are sensible parameters. I will
feed them into my spreadsheet and see what it does to profitability.

Unfortunately, that means it has to be mastered on a Mac, as Toast is the only

so for the next version it can be done as a hybrid. Long filenames can be done

number of Linus programs for making CD\'s that serve as front-ends to that
program. 

Probably the easiest is to stick to cross platform file formats. (which do, by
now, include pict and PDF files...someone stuck with a 286 DOS platform will
have to upgrade somewhere along the line.)

Mac .sit and .bin compressed files live happily without resource forks, as do
almost all Mac data files.

Generally the only reason yould compress a Mac file anyway is to compress an
executable, they\'re of little interest to the PC-folk anyway.

I\'ve been thinking about this quite a bit lately.  Well, computer tech in
general, not just OS\'s.  

As large as the Imperium is, as long as it takes to get information from one
side to the other, imagine trying to get everyone to use the same OS?  Are
you willing to wait a year for your bug report to reach the programmers, and
another year for the patch to reach you?  Obviously, Open Source software is
going to be better here, when you can get someone local to fix it... but
consider what that does to the code base.  Open Source software works only
with the aid of *rapid* communication (i.e. the Internet)...  I can\'t see
doing Open Source software on any scale outside of a system... the best
communication rates are two-week turn-around.  

So I\'m thinking about hardware...  hardware develops more slowly and doesn\'t
lend itself to Open Source development anyway.  How do you coordinate
hardware compatibility across several systems, let alone an entire Imperium?
Yeah, you could have an Imperium-created standard... but in the time it
takes them to *tell* some far system that they\'re working on a standard,
that far system has created and implemented its own.  It\'s even a problem
with communication protocols...  I expect that there\'s a compatibility
problem in just making computers talk to each other.  

And we\'re not even looking at newly-met races, who have been developing
their own technology independently all along.  

In wondering about data storage incompatibilities, I\'m supposing that we
have something like electronic books, which would be a self-contained
computer and data storage device meant for carrying and displaying
information.  You can\'t count on every place you go having the ability to
interface with your Ship\'s Papers, for instance... so your Ship\'s Papers
include their own display device, making them independent of the receiving
end\'s technology.  

In the end, I\'m really picturing a huge mishmash of protocols and interfaces
for machines to talk to each other.  If the video display card on your nav
unit loses its smoke, you probably can\'t just pick up a new card at any old
port... you\'re going to have to find one compatible with your computer
system, which may turn out to be nearly impossible out here in the Vargr
Extents

The problem with this is that your chaff has no thrust, so I move my ship
away from your current flight path and as soon as your missile makes a
course correction, either I hit the IR signature or my doppler LIDAR
can ignore the chaff.

The difference is that the drop trops are on a ballistic trajectory, the
same as the chaff.

I\'m not saying it can\'t be done, but all the missile designs that work
seem to be a) big and b) expensive. Not the sort of thing civilians carry
dozens of in one missile turret.

IIRC, there in a section in FF&S explaining why det lasers are used.
In summary: "there are no small cheap missiles anymore".

I can understand how you design a combustion laser missile, but I remain
to be convinced that you wouldn\'t be better putting the laser in a
turret on the ship. (Possibly still using chemical energy if you don\'t
have spare power.)

This is definitely contradicted by canon. Throughout the Traveller
Literature there are references to the \'Standard Imperial Data Package\';
plans on building everything from spanners to starships. Sort of a
real-life FF&S ;-)

Undoubtedly there are protocol definitions in there...if they\'re smart,
that\'s all they are "Here is how the parts are supposed to talk to each
other" This allows for a several TL-range of components...presumably one
could build a TL-8 video card to work in your TL-14 flight computer. It
may be slow, it may be monochrome, it may display all text in one font
and all uppercase, but it\'lll work.

Outside of the Imperium things are a different matter.

To not speak of the Plot Device, which I will NOT say is called Virus,
this is one reason that that particular PD spread so rapidly throughout
the Imperium. When it hit Aslan, Vargr and Hiver territory, it slowed
considerably, as there they _do_ have a wide mishmash of incompatible
systems.

The Imperium is a hybrid Solomani/Vilani run commerce oriented political
system. Damn straight there\'s going to be a Standard Computing Platform.
Anything else would really affect the bottom line adversely. It probably
won\'t even arise from decree, just the old saying "No one ever got fired
for specifying Ling Standard Products!"

We can only hope and pray it is NOT called Windows 5679 :->

Which would result in very slow technological development.  This wouldn\'t be
too bad if all innovation were done at the distribution point of the Data
Package, but it can\'t be.  It may take months for my new designs to reach
the Data Package coordination point, months for committees to approve the
inclusion of my design into the Data Package, and then months more to
distribute that Data Package to the rest of the Imperium.  In the meantime,
I\'ve designed, built and am attempting to sell ships using my new designs...
but either nobody\'s buying because they\'re (rightly) afraid of not being
able to get parts, or they\'re later breaking down and unable to get parts
when on the other side of the Imperium.  

Canon or not, I find it very, very hard to believe that the Imperium can
maintain any kind of standardization without slowing innovation to a near
stand-still.  The Imperium is based on creating a stable economy, and
business in the technical world means getting your designs to market as
quickly as possible.

As long as you\'re building things in the Data Package or designing
everything to be compatible with the Data Package, you\'re okay.  But that
stifles innovation... the Data Package becomes like unto MS-DOS.  The entire
Imperium ends up being backward-compatible with MS-DOS 3.1 in order to keep
things running.  :)

And I find that Plot Device to be so utterly bogus that you couldn\'t get me
to play in that version of the Traveller universe if you paid me to do it.

How are you going to enforce it?  While the *government* (and therefore its
starports) may be standardized, I don\'t see how they\'re going to force every
computer in the Imperium to run the same OS. 

We can\'t even manage under five flavors of Linux in a world where
communication is, for all intents and purposes, instantaneous.  How are we
going to manage to make thousands of worlds that are months apart in
communication use the same operating system if using that OS doesn\'t fit
their needs?

I also seem to remember the use of gravic repulsers as a point defense
weapon against missiles. Was that TNE?  The G:T book says that gravity beam
weapons are not available,(thou I intend to use them IMTU as a Hi GTL12 or
GTL13 device as point defense weapons for Darrian and Imperial capital ships

My question is how do these weapons stand in OTU?

 I was wondering if anyone has every played the Computer game "Mantis
Experimental Fighter"? It was put out by MicroProse 1992 and was highly
underrated and didn\'t sell. Also the story line for it was kind a corny,
and overused. But, the fighting part of the game was IMHO the best that I\'d
seen. For those that never seen it, part of the reason it didn\'t do too
well was because it was really hard to fly. Because it used real Newtonian
Physics. It wasn\'t flight Sim in space like Wing Commander and Tie fighter
(Although I liked them too). The reason I am bringing this up, is that in
that game it was really hard to use missiles effectively. But when you did,
it was well worth it. Now in that game you could shoot down in coming
missiles, but it was hard and you had to concentrate on doing just that. So
that means if you were pursuing a target or defending from a target, you
would spend valuable time and power on taking out a missile while the
target either gets away or gets a good lock with weapons fire. So using
missiles is like any other weapon, it takes time and practice to know when
to shoot them or when to hold them. Note that in this game also, the large
ships did have some kind of point defense system, but it didn\'t cover all
of the possible arcs, which to me is realistic because it would be near
impossible to put 360 deg spherical coverage on a ship.
  Also what I like about this game is that you can give good examples of
closure speeds. 
 Example: I\'m trying to close with mother ship accelerating at 8G\'s Mother
ship dispatches interceptor. It is closing at 8G\'s also. When the
Interceptor is within my weapon ranges (which are long in this game) I have
only 1 to 1.5 seconds to shoot before he has passed me and is out of range
again and forget about using missiles then because before it could hit or
even get close to the target, it would run out of fuel. But against the
mother ship, missiles can close, but they tend to get blown up, unless you
can attack from a aft vector.

  Well there I go again rambling on. But back to Traveller. I try to use
examples from games and books that I have read to explain to my players
(non of them including me have a College degree) So I have to explain the
intrinsic\'s of space travel to the best my knowledge. So when they are
trying to shoot down a missile I tell them they are trying to hit a target
that moving so fast and erratic that when they shoot, by the time the beam
gets where they fired the missile isn\'t there. But if they could have a
fully automatic self targeting multi laser PD system (Aegis with lasers)
then it would be easier, but a Ragtag crew with little in the way of money
trying to keep there ship together can\'t afford that luxury.

 One of the players has nick named the ship "Barely Jump #3" after his
first two ships of a similar name "Barely Jump" and "Barely Jump #2"

 Well hope I didn\'t bore ya all.

  The only place I have ever heard of them was in Star Trek (I think
Repulser beams) But hey, I have Traveller games I call "Side Treks" Where
they either get popped into (I.E. misjumped) into an alternate reality
where Shields, Warp drives, Tractor beams and Transporters are the norm. Of
course I use the "Historical" scenarios from StarFleet Battles as the basis
for the adventures. Usually I use the ones where the feds get destroyed or
its a major engagement where the PC\'s can play a small but important part
in the battle.

I have to comment on this. *All* the PC programs I know of for reading

present as a "header". They can\'t *recognize* the file if it is not

The big problem is that in space you *don\'t* go "jigging and zagging"
the same way you do in an aircraft. You have to change course with
*engine* power, there are no "control surfaces".

Get a copy of Mayday, or at least a good description of the vector
movement system, and play out a few missile attacks. 

Also keep in mind that it\'s *hard* to build something as small as a
missile that has high accel *and* can maintain it for many turns.
That\'s why most missiles are rated in "g-turns". That is, a 20g-turn
missile can boost at 20 g for 1 turn, or 10 g for 2 turns, or 15 g for
1 turn and 5 g for the next, etc all the way down to 1 g for 20 turns.

The main reason for the "det laser" warheads is that they can score a
"hit" without getting close to the ship. Given any reasonable sort of
laser point defence system, a ship should be able to get 100% kill
rates on any missiles that get within *thousands* of kilometers. 

You see, to be able to hit the ship, the missiles have to be under
power (or very lucky). If they are under power, they stand out like a
sore thumb on sensors. If they are coastying, they can\'t dodge, and the
ship *can*. Plus the target solution for a coasting missile is easy.

DOSEMU runs just about anything that\'s DOS.  They\'re still bringing WINE up to 
Win95 specs, but DOSEMU can run Windows 3.1.  So it\'s *getting* there.  
Somebody came up with a full-tilt Win3.1 emulator called WABI, forget who, but 
it ran on Linux, and they stopped producing it.
 
There\'s a new emulator out called VMWare that\'ll run a *lot* of the Win95 
stuff, too.

Probably one \'standard\' OS that runs emulator software.  Ain\'t that the way 
the Vilani would do it?

Exactly...how long does it take the Imperium to advance a TL?? 300-400

Again, exactly. While this system _does_ stifle rapid tech advancement,
it does promote a stable Imperium.

And the point is? In a system where it takes years for an \'upgrade\' to
filter out far enough to be widely used, I think you are seriously
overestimating the value of technological innovation. 

Bluntly you\'re looking at it through eyes colored by a) instant
communications, b)near instant travel time  and c) that common habit of
low-tl cultures, thinking that we\'re the acme of innovation.

Take a long hard look at the advance of computer technology in just the
last 30 years...how much stuff is strewn along the roadside, obsolete,
and never used. When you can\'t get your innovations out, and in use
rapidly enough for them to become even mild standards, you have chaos,
and chaos is bad for business. While the IDP\'s do stifle innovation
somewhat (though properly designed they shouldn\'t do too much) if there
is no standardization nothing worls together. Each starship becomes a
one-off design pretty much. can you imagine how much of a hassle _that_
would be? Nowimagine that you\'re in the Spinward Marches. under your
model, this week SEVEN mutually incompativble computer architectures
ahve arrived in the marketplace from seven different sectors. All of
them are new all of them are advertised as this weeks bees knees.

You\'re the chief information systems analyst for Glisten Starships LLC,
and you have to decide which one is going to become the standard in your
new line of container freighter ships, a line you conservatively
estimate will be in production for a hundred fity to three hundred
years.

What do you specify: one of the 7 new things to come along _this_ week,
or the IDP, the standard you know is spread throughout the Imperium,
parts available, fixes appliable?

Even the PHB would have a hard time blowing that decision.

It isn\'t enforced, any more than (more or less) the Wintel standard is
\'enforced\' today, ie: by the marketplace. MicroSloth _does_ break the
rules (and, figuratively, a bunch of kneecaps) keeping alternate systems
out of the mainstream market, but on the whole, the reason that there
are so many wintel systems in the world is that, on the main, that\'s
pretty much what everybody else uses. The IDP will be the same way.

The big value of Linuix (and Open Systems) is that changes can be
implemented readily, by anyone. In a world of instantaneous
communication, those changes can be rapidly spread through the installed
base, but in the main, those changes can be applied to just about any
version.

The IDP is the ultimate Open Source. You have the entire source code to
everything from software packages to starship designs, with the rules on
how they interact. A lot of innovatiopn is possible there, but due to
the nature of the Imperium, it\'s spread and acceptance are going to be
glacially slow by our standards....

This doesn\'t mean that the Imperium is a stunted, backwards place...what
it means is that it\'s big...really, really mind-bogglingly big. 

The Imperial Data Package contains designs from TL-9 on up. There are
9126 worlds in the Imperium TL-9 or greater, with a combined population
of about 4 x10^13 people.

That\'s 40 TRILLION people. 

It takes a long time for advancments to move around that many worlds and
that many people.

There was a cheat floating thru here awhile back.

Hmmmmmm.  I\'m beginning to consider intalling DOSEMU here & trying it out 
again.  Been a few years since I played it.  What the hell, I have 2 hours a

The evasion manuevers are limited. First by the laws of physics (vector
movement). Second by the fact that the missile *has* to be spending
most of its time coming at you. It can\'t *spare* much deltaV for
dodging. 

And they\'ll be pretty useless. At 1500 km, the speed of light lag time
between what the sensors report and where the laser hits is .01
seconds. At 12g, a missile can change position by 6 *millimeters* in
that time. Which means the laser *will* hit.

At 15,000 km the lag time is .1 second. At this distance the missile
can move all of 60 cm in that much time at 12g. That *might* be enough
to generate a miss. But the laser can fire several shots in a second,
covering most of the likely positions.

Evasion isn\'t much help against lightspeed weaponry. Not up close.

To make a significant deflection, these things would have to induce
*huge* accelerations. So huge that boarding a ship that still had one
active would be impossible. Which would be a major change in
background.

That sort of works against radar at ranges of say, 100 miles to 20
miles. Working against lidar is much harder. And in most situations in
space, the active jammers merely act as target aquistion aids!

A missile against the ocean or the land is hard to spot on radar, and
not a lot easier on IR. A missile against the sky is easy to spot on
radar, and somewhat easy to spot on IR. A missile against *space*
stands out like a sore thumb on any sensor platform.

The ones that are accelerating. As I recall, it takes a "discriminator
circuit" that consists of something like one transistor and a couple of
resitors to reject non-accelerating targets.

But in an atmospheric drop, the chaff *and* the capsules will be moving
at the same speed (terminal velocity for the capsules). 

In a missile attack, the chaff will *coast* at constant velocity, while
the real missiles continue accelerating towards the target. You obly
need to worry about *non*-accelerating targets when they get *really*
close. 

Also, any sort of "multi-spectral" sensor suite will be able to
distinguish chaff from real missiles. *Radar* returns may be the same,
but only at certain wavelengths. At other radar wavelengths, and with
IR and lidar, the chaff will look *very* different.

You might note that chaff is *never* used to protect missiles in the
real world. It\'s used to provide decoy targets *for* missiles. And in
attempts to overload radar.

Neatly sucking in radar-guided antimissile missiles.

Which is why you\'d want a flight of \'glue\' missiles out in front to suck in the antimissile missiles.

Say whatever you want about the Soviets, but they weren\'t *dumb*, just technologically challanged.  <grin>

I think the CT orginal starship construction rules reflected this kind of

an underlying commonality to the systems that would allow repair parts

Of course, you\'d have the quirks - things that were designed a little

Just consider how well current Navy anti-missile measures work. And
they can only see the targets for the last few miles. If they could see
them coming for *thousands* of km, they\'d do even better.

Add lasers, which don\'t have the range and aiming restrictions of
anti-missile missiles, and it gets *really* hard to account for the
*lack* of a 100% kill rate.

The exception would be if you were able to saturate the defenses. But
given the ranges, that gets *very* difficult. The missiles are going to
take a turn or more to get there. That\'s what, 15 min? 30 min? A
*million* missiles can be killed in 30 min by point defence with a kill
rate of less than 600 per second. Now consider that a *thousand*
missiles is going to be pushing things. 1000 missiles can be killed in
30 min at a kill rate of a bit more than one every other second. And
since there are likely a dozen or so lasers doing the killing, that
brings it down to something like a couple of shots per minute per laser.

See why we figure that missiles are dead meat?

My point is, *why the heck are you waiting years for an upgrade when you can
develop your own faster?* 

If someone developed a jump drive that somehow shortens travel time to one
day, and your competitor was using it... would you wait for it to filter
down through the IDP, or would you start buying it directly from the
manufacturer and using it as soon as possible?

No, I\'m looking at it quite plainly.

That\'s a gross exaggeration.  No matter how fast your innovation, you can\'t
reasonably move fast enough to make each ship a one-off design, or even
anything close to it.

Why are we planning on producing the same model for over a hundred years?
Why won\'t my competitor have something better well within twenty?  Why won\'t
*I* have something better in twenty?  Are we so far out there on the curve
that there\'s nothing new to invent?  Evidence of the Ancients implies that
we have much to learn.

Depends on the cost/risk of implementing something new vs its benefits.
What kind of an edge am I going to get by using one of these new things?
How much benefit is there compared to going with the tried and true IDP
systems?  Show me how my company can use your new system to get an edge over
my competitor and that the risk is acceptable, and I\'ll buy your system in a
heartbeat. 

I just did that very thing in my own company.  I bought a Windows NT product
for a HP-UX-only shop, and am putting NT workstations on certain people\'s
desktop, despite its incompatibility with all of the other workstations,
because that one product is far superior to anything we\'ve been able to find
on HP-UX.  It\'s costing us in hardware/software purchase, retraining, and
time integrating datasets (because we have to take data from the HP\'s to the
NT\'s and back to the HP\'s smoothly).  But the drawbacks were outweighed by
cost.  

Your argument implies that the cost of innovation is always outweighed by
the stability of standardization.  This can\'t always be true. 

>It isn\'t enforced, any more than (more or less) the Wintel standard is

And the guy in the cube next to me is using a computer that\'s not compatible
with mine.  And in my own cube, I have two screens... one is a computer, the
other is a smart-terminal that connects to a server that\'s incompatible with
the computer in my cube.  And that server is incompatible with the server
sitting right next to it in the lab, and incompatible with the server next
to it, which is incompatible with the next server over.  All in all, I\'m
running five different, *incompatible* servers sitting in the same room.
And that\'s in the same *room*, in the same building, on the same continent,
on the same planet, in the same system, where communication is
instantaneous.   While they\'ll all talk nice to each other, I need different
parts from different vendors to upgrade or repair any of them. 

Now how do you imagine that spreading out across the galaxy, with
communication delays of 
weeks and months, is going to *improve* this problem?

That\'s pretty much what every *home* user and every office-work machine
uses. Wander away from games, spreadsheets and wordprocessors, and you
quickly get into variously incompatible VMS, Unix, OS/400, etc. machines.

Which is part of my point.  In a single system, you can still have this kind
of innovation going on.  I\'m starting to picture relative run-away
technology in individual systems, while the starship network becomes more
and more dated because it can\'t afford to move away from standardization.
(There\'s still an incredible amount of stuff to do with technology that
won\'t affect or be affected by an interstellar society.)

Problem is, when you\'ve got the source *right here*, are you going to wait
*years* to get changes that you can implement yourself in only weeks?  I see
this leading to my patch, your patch, his patch, her patch, everywhere a
patch-patch.  We\'d try to keep things compatible, of course... but at some
point, in some field, there have got to be a place where abandoning some
compatibility is going to get some benefit that\'s worth it.  And the moment
that happens, big business will latch onto it and put it in the field.  If
the field is interstellar, maybe it\'ll mean putting spare parts on the ship,
or going out of your way to push a parts distribution through the system to
support your ships, over-engineering the part so failure is very unlikely,
or just living with being stranded if it comes to that... but if the
*benefit* is large enough, it can outweigh the cost.  

>This doesn\'t mean that the Imperium is a stunted, backwards place...what

Yep... mind-bogglingly big.  Which is why I find it highly unlikely that
something that *big* can have something that *standard* across the whole of
it.

40 TRILLION people... many of which are capable of making improvements to
the system on their own.  What keeps them from doing so?  What happens when
I invent some new technology here, set up a standard for it, and start
selling it to neighboring systems... I\'m not incompatible, because it\'s
totally new and I\'m the only place to get it.  But at the same time, someone
across the way has created the same technology, except he\'s using entirely
different protocols.  By the time our designs make it to the IDP committees
(I can\' t use that word without hearing it in Queen Amidala\'s voice) we\'ve
got established customer bases and somebody has to sort the mess out.  Or
not.  If our two realms never (or rarely) meet, it might not even be a
problem.  

>It takes a long time for advancments to move around that many worlds and

But you seem to imply that advancements are only going to go to that many
worlds through the IDP, and that nobody is going to use it until it\'s in the
IDP.  The advancements are going to *start* in all of those worlds.  Many of
them simultaneously, many of them at odds with what\'s already in the IDP,
but still beneficial or commercially viable.  Companies aren\'t going to want
to wait months or even years for a design to get into the IDP when they\'re
ready to put units in the field right now.

Getting carbon to "burn" in a chlorine atmosphere is *hard*.
Hydrocarbons generally burn to HCl and free carbon (aka "soot").

I\'ve actually done the experiment where you burn a candle in chlorine,
and read about buring methane in it (ie a specially rigged Bunsen
burner in a tank of chlorine). Both give off copious amounts of soot.

Actually, Open Source works fine either way. It\'s just that the "base"
software won\'t be uniform. Different patches for the same bug will
radiate out from the point where they are discovered. If one is
superior, it\'ll *eventually* replace the other. If not, they may
co-exist for a *long* time, whith some areas using one, others using
the other. 

Luckily, the rate of change for both hardware and software is a lot
slower. So perhaps once every 10 years, a conference goes thru all the
patches that are *more* than 10 years old and haven\'t been "reconciled"
and announces which one will be standard, with a 10 year lead time (ie
it\'s to be implemented before the *next* conference).

Actually, I think the key *is* communication protocols. Define those,
and have all the "parts" be smart, and things actually get easier.

Sure, they\'ll be a major incompatibility. But they\'ll start adopting
Imperial tech, and if they\'ve got any really neat tricks, those will
eventually migrate into Imperial tech.

Hardcopy will still exist for a lot of stuff, especially things like
ship\'s papers. 

Storage? Even now we have essentially two kinds. Text and binary. Text
is likely to use something like Unicode (a 32-bit character set that
holds all know characters sets with lots of room left over) and some
descendant of html. 

The various binary formats will still be as arbitrary as ever. Though
one can hope that they\'ll have had time to decide which of many formats
is "best" for a given job. That\'d mean that there might only be JPEG
and PNG for graphics storage (one "lossy", one "exact") instead of BMP,
GIF, RLE, JPEG, PNG, etc. And so on for other file types.

That\'s where uniform protocols come in. I doubt that there will *be*
such a thing as a "video card". Instead, the display will be smart
enough to use a common protocol to talk to whatever it is connected to.
So in essence, it\'s being told what to display where in a "high level"
exchange. 

So you connect a "display" to the network, or directly to a "device"
and they find a common protocol and start exchanging data. The display
sends its capabilities, and the sensor or computer sends the "commands"
to generate the proper image. 

You may not *worry* about sub-assemblies of the "black boxes". If
something goes wrong, you pull the display and plug in a spare. It has
a different ID, so the boxes that where communicating with the old one,
renegotiate with the new one, and away you go.

I figure this is pretty much inevitable. And with properly designed
protocols, several different "generations" of equipment can work
together. It also makes life simpler for the players and the ref. 

At worst, you might have to stick a "protocol converter" between the
replacement display and the rest of the system. Much like the AppleTalk
to Ethernet converter for hooking my Mac into my PC network.

The PCs see an ethernet connection. The Mac sees an Appletalk
connection. Everbody is happy.

First off, you\'ll find that all the published materials *do* show
technological progress as being very slow.

And second, once technologies *mature*, you don\'t *get* new designs all
that often. Look at the auto industry. The differences from one model
to another are *not* technological, they are mostly artistic. The
remaining differences tend to be a matter of which of the several
mutually exclusive "properties" of a car were picked as most important.
Size, mileage, capacity, cost, etc.

True to some extent. And necessary to some extent. Just remember, this
is being done with *mature* technologies. Which is something current
computer tech *isn\'t*.

Since TL6 is 1940 to 1969 (according to The Traveller Book), then
carrying your own oxygen *is* possible. Heck, it\'s possible at 1900
tech levels.

Insanely dangerous? Well, if you insist. Oxygen tanks (LOX *or*
pressurized) are dangerous. On a vehicle they are more so. Just
consider the fun if an oxygen line springs a leak. If there\'s a spark,
it makes like a blowtorch. And in an oxygen atmosphere the metal in the
engine will burn. :-)

Peroxide engines are even more fun, because a *lot* of randome
contaminants will catalyze the stuff. So the result of a speck of the
wrong thing getting into the peroxide system is "boom".

Nope. It\'s too chemically active to be found naturally. Ditto for hydrazine.

Peroxide is a good choice then. The other combo is too explosive for a
piston engine. You could either do the "smart" thing and spray the
peroxide thru a catalyst grid in a "steam generator" chamber and then
pipe the steam/oxygen mix the results to the pistons, or you could get
really crazy and spray peroxide thru a catalyst grid directly into the
pistons. I don\'t recommend that technique simply because it\'s *too* apt
to screw up, and I can\'t see *how* you\'d throttle it.

BTW, with the seperate steam generator, if the piping runs are kept
short you can "supercharge" the engine by spraying *fuel* into the
piston, where it can react with the oxygen in the steam/oxygen mix.
Sort of like a nitrous oxide boost, but backwards.

Hydrogen will burn in chlorine quite well. You get HCl (hydrochloric
acid). So will simple hydrocarbons like methane. Except that the carbon
*won\'t* burn, so the flames are *very* sooty. Not recommended for an
engine (can you say "instant carbon deposits"?).

CH4 + 2 Cl2 -> C + 4 HCl

<see simple experiment at the bottom of the message>

Water is not terribly stable in a chlorine atmosphere. It\'ll absorb
chlorine, becoming "chlorine water" which is *just* as corrosive as
aqua regia. In other words, it\'ll corrode things like gold and
platinum! Anti-corrosion measures will be important. Though the
chloride "rust" that forms on exposed metal will generally be ok, since
it\'ll get exposed to HCl most of the time, not to water.

Plastic and rubber type materials may degrade more easily, but I expect
that most will be fluorocarbon based (ie teflon related) and thus safe
from chlorine. 

Geologically, the planet will be *weird*, because to have more chlorine
than oxygen will require some really unlikely things during its
formation. This will likely be *why* people are there. The high
abundance of chloride minerals makes refining ore much simpler in some
ways. And the rocks will tend to be very colorful, as many chlorides
are a lot more colorful than their oxide counterparts.

There should still be a fair amount of oxide rocks, but they should be
in the minority. 

And you\'ll find that the air is *very* hard to see thru for any great
distance. Chlorine is *not* terribly transparent. More of a thin,
yellow-green fog. 

If there\'s native life, it\'ll find oxygen to be as dangerous as we find
fluorine. And water will be a hazardous acid to them. They\'ll also find
our lighting to be "strange". 
- ----
Simple home experiment. Take some sodium bisulfite ("SaniFlush " brand
toilet cleaner) and some bleach. Combine a small amount in the bottom
of a widemouth jar (say a gallon pickle jar). The jar will fill with
chlorine, easily visible as a greenish yellow gas. Do this outdoors on
a calm day, *not* indoors.

Take a birthday candle and rig a sort of wire holder so you can lower
it into the jar while lit. Light it and lower it into the chlorine.
It\'ll keep burning, but the flame will become orange or even red, and
will give off *huge* amounts of soot. Hydrocarbons burning in chlorine.

When you are done, set the jar on a solid surface and gently spray
water at it from a distance. The water will help absorb the chlorine.
When there\'s no more trace of it, fill the jar and dump it down the
*toilet* not the sink. And flush several times.

Unfortunately, what\'s in the published material isn\'t necessarily the way
things *should* work.  (i.e. you can\'t point to the fictional work as a
first principle.) 

Now there is a lot to be said for following the published material, even if
it\'s not technically accurate.  I\'m just exploring the issues of accuracy.

Oh?  Fuel-injection.  Lighter aluminum blocks.  Computer-control, monitoring
and diagnostics of the engine and transmission.  Better handling of
emissions.  More efficient stream-lining.  Air bags.  Side air-bags.
Anti-lock brakes.  The uni-body design.  Body designs created to direct
impact energy away from occupants.  Tire tread with better handling
capabilities.  Suspensions with better handling capabilities.  Paint that
doesn\'t fade as readily.  Rigid plastic body panels.  

Cars have come a long way in just a few short years... and I\'m not even a
car person.  I\'m sure someone more familiar with them could come up with
even more technological innovations that we all take for granted. 

And garages have had to improve with them... mostly in the area of computer
diagnostics and training.  (But training is just as important as anything
else in our information-dissemination problem... even if they\'ve got the
parts and the tools, if they don\'t know how to work on it, you\'re outta
luck. :)

The automobile is a mature technology, but look at how much it\'s advanced in

Jump masking *adds* 30.6 hours per jump to the average trip, at each end.
You should use 110 hours = ((30.6 + 5.5) hours / sqrt(0.43)) * 2. There\'s a
reason for using 1g freighters...

Too short. "Average" cargo loads and unloads at 264 dtons/hour (a weighted
average by type -- I should have mentioned it specifically in FT, but
forgot). Breakbulk cargo (the only kind that will fit in turrets) loads and
unloads at 30 dtons per hour. Assuming 600 dtons in turrets, that\'s
(14032/264 + 600/30) * 0.95 * 2  = 139.0 hours to unload and load again.

20.1 jumps per year.

Costs break out to fixed (annual) costs and variable (per-jump costs):

Fixed:

Yes, KCr 811/year is too high. Crew members receive a minimum of Cr800 per
month (p. GT107); the average is more like Cr1,200 per month. Salaries are
at least KCr432 per year, and KCr648 is more realistic.

Call it KCr136,849.9 per year.

KCr5,473.996 per year.

Total fixed costs: KCr142,971.896 per year, or KCr7,113.0 per jump (at 20.1
jumps per year).

Variable:

>    400    Fuel (unrefined - not mentioned in Far Trader)

Assuming unrefined fuel is available for purchase; refueling operations
will require 40.7 hours, which is within the port time. If unrefined fuel
has to be skimmed, time in-system increases enormously. FT included refined
fuel in its freight rate calculations.

>    400.5  Berthing & Starport fee

This assumes that the freight is carried for some other owner, so wharfage
and handling tariffs do not apply. This is okay for a pure shipping
company, but should be corrected for megacorporate operations. The freight
rates in FT were set with both wharfage and freight handling included.

Total Variable: KCr800.5 per jump

>   5866.78 Total Cost per Jump

KCr7,913.5 per jump.

KCr7,098.9 per jump, or 89.7% profit. Annual profit: KCr142,687.9, or about
26% first year ROI.

If, on the other hand, your loading is only 65% (typical in the real
world), your profit goes down to KCr3,413.0 per jump (23.6 jumps per year).
This is a first year ROI of 15%.

You should probably consider amortizing losses in your figures. The
disaster rate in GT (p. 121) is currently far too high: even assuming an
expert crew (Skill-15), one jump in 1,400 results in disaster (complete
destruction of the ship, not just misjump). A proposed revision for the 2d
printing would reduce this to 14,000. Even so, at 20.1 jumps that\'s a 0.15%
chance of total loss per year. The replacement cost is KCr205.3 per jump;
under the current rules it would be ten times higher.

This does not address losses from other causes: conventional accident,
piracy, tradewar, etc. The contemporary loss rate for surface shipping is
2-3% of all hulls per year.

If you don\'t use jump masking, you should recalibrate the freight rates

I\'m not sure about this -- 1g came out close enough to optimal when I was

At the cost of handling premiums, which will have to be paid by the ship

I assumed this would be the case.

All the example starships in FT have sufficient seats in small craft for
all crew and passengers. As a GM, I would consider a ship that didn\'t meet
that standard uninsurable, but YMMV.

Neither did we.

That\'s what LASH is all about, and even then it\'s a close-run game.

You and I live on opposite sides of the Imperium.  We both build jump drives
for a living.  Simultaneously, both of us develop some new technology that
makes jumping inside the 100 planetary diameter limit safer... but we
implement it in rather different ways, and start selling our newly-modified
drives.  A year later, one of my competitors a few parsecs away
reverse-engineers my modification, sees how it can be improved ten-fold, and
starts selling an even better design based on mine.  Meanwhile, your design
has almost finished the process of entering the IDP and will become an
"official" design.  Meanwhile, starbases clustered around my shipyard have
crew trained to repair my drives, and even my competitor\'s drives... but not
yours.  And the same on your end... as long as I stay within ten parsecs of
your general distribution hub, I can count on someone knowing how to fix my
ship, but outside of that it becomes iffy.

Where does it go from here?  No central committee can consolidate these
things and eliminate the differences in the existing drives, and those
drives have a fair customer base after ten years. 

Is it possible to keep this kind of thing from happening to start with?  I
don\'t think so.  

The problem is even worse with newly-contacted races... how long does it
take to "integrate" them technologically.  How long do we have to put up
with them being "incompatible"?  

I have a feeling that travelling citizens of the Imperium put up with minor
incompatibilities with moderate frequency.  Generally nothing major, but
here and there they run into things that don\'t talk properly to each other,
or find that nobody in the system knows how to repair the thing that\'s
broken.  Maybe it generates a "What do you *mean* that nobody around here\'s
heard of the X-32 inverted pulse-array jump drive?  I knew this place was
backwater, but I never imagined they were this behind in tech.  *Now* who
are we going to get to fix it?"  Once in awhile, it\'s something to center an
adventure or part of an adventure around, as someone pointed out with the
Star Wars example.  You\'re most likely to encounter it on the fringes (as in
Star Wars), but I can see it happening. 

>Actually, I think the key *is* communication protocols. Define those,
>and have all the "parts" be smart, and things actually get easier.

That had crossed my mind, and I\'m sure you\'re right... for data
communications, common and "smart" protocols are going to be essential.  But
how far can it reach?  That\'s part of what I want to explore. 

>Hardcopy will still exist for a lot of stuff, especially things like
>ship\'s papers. 

I thought that at first, but then I started thinking about Smart Paper-type
technology... the advantages of paper, with far more flexibility, like being
able to render the text in any language it knows about, as well as other
visual and audible modes.  Unless it\'s fragile or has some other flaw, I
think it\'d probably replace paper. 

>Storage? Even now we have essentially two kinds. Text and binary. Text

I\'m not worried so much about formats... the comm protocol is what\'s
important.  What I\'m curious about is storage *capacity*.  Just how much
info gets carted around on an Xboat?

They don\'t call it Plug-n-Pray for nothing. :)   Though I figure what you\'ve
presented is probably pretty accurate, I have trouble imagining it being
universal enough to never run into problems.

  I have to comment on this. *All* the PC programs I know of for reading
  MacPaint(?) type files *require* that the (128 byte?) resource fork be
  present as a "header". They can\'t *recognize* the file if it is not
  present.

I\'m talking about burning an ISO 9660 CD-ROM (PC standard).  This protocol
defaults to old MS-DOS filenames and a single data fork
(except it\'s no longer a \'fork\' if there is only one...)  Additionally, I\'m not
talking about a file (text or image) that is saved in a Mac specific
format (like MacPaint).  This is why I would recommend that the file be saved in
a format that is natively readable by a PC, e.g., GIF, JPEG,
ASCII Text, PDF, Excel, Word, EPS, etc.  There are numerous options for saving
in these formats (and many others) on a Macintosh, and
should be used instead of native MacPaint, ClarisWorks, Quark, the Mac versions
of MS Office or Corel or Adobe or anything else that a PC would have any
difficulty with.  Most PC users have a copy of Word, at least, and Windows can
read standard ASCII  and bitmapped images -- no need to burn a CD with files
saved in a format specific to a Mac application -- especially when these Mac
apps offer the option of
formatting them into PC-readable files.  Unless, of course, the CD you\'re making
is only going to be used on Macs.

Another comment was make on this issue: Mac users can always choose to burn a
hybrid CD.

(Since Mac is still a niche-market machine, and Wintel sits on 85-90% of
desktops, it is the Mac users who need to accommodate that vast
majority, not the other way around.  This is why MacOS offers these kinds of
options -- Apple knows that we live in a Windows world.  For
now.)

At the risk of starting another 50 MB flame war on the specifics of computer
technology that only a hyper-computer geek could love: You\'re IMHO thinking
about this all wrong. If you can believe that you can get parts for GTL10
jump drives from The Trailing Isles to the Spinward Marches then why is it
so hard to believe that computers are any different?
I believe it\'s because too many Traveller players are involved in 20th
century computers. This makes them lose their perspective on things. I\'ve
been programming since the 1970\'s, and the software and hardware advances in
that time have been unbelievable. No technology since the dawn of the Ice
Age has advanced at such a pace.
That having been said, let\'s move out of the 20th century and into the 57th.
The Vilani discovered Jumpdrive in 4714 BC. It was 912 BC before they
improved it to Jump 2. They never did discover Jump 3. That was the Solomani
a couple of thousand years after that.  What we have here is a very stagnant
society.
Some Megacorp probably holds the patents on storage media and processor
integrators, as well as what ever passes for an operating system in 1100
Imperium. That means that nobody can even attempt to improve them, not
unless they want to face extensive litigation and a couple of companies of
mercs come to defend the owning corporations rights to all legacy
technology.

Of course You\'ll be able to pick up a replacement card for your video. The
design probably hasn\'t changed since Cleon III.  As for changing software I
don\'t believe that the old software/hardware division will be used in
Imperial Computers, otherwise you could just copy data from one machine to
the other, something I seem to remember couldn\'t be done in CT. And you
could just erase software. And if you could VIRUS wouldn\'t work, (which
doesn\'t really bother me. I\'ve never used Virus in a game, and probably
never will.)

I support the concept that all Traveller computers are neural-net which must
be programmed by teaching or via hard-wiring in the net. This would make
Traveller computer science skill completely different from present day
programming skills and explain why Computer/Computer Tech skills include
repairing both hardware and programming, since they\'re the same in firmware.

As said in my previous post, I\'d say a two GTL rise in 1100 years is a
pretty good indication of a society whose level of innovation is pretty near
to zero. Business in a technical world means totally owning the complete
rights to the product that everyone has got to use. Just ask Intel or
Microsoft.

My response:

I guess I had something different in mind.  I assumed that a grav source
would produce a "signature" some what akin to a small but rather massive
object.   As a Professional Geologist I\'ve had occasion to over the years to
become familiar with existing geophysical instrumentation, interpret some of
the results and to investigate in particular gavametric sensing technologies
in the scientific literature.   I know that rather small variations can be
mapped with hand held instruments utilizing 60\'s era technology.   While
those instruments were rather delicate and needed to oriented prependicular
to the earth\'s surface in use they were not particularly heavy.  The
instrumentation in all it variations has much of the same limitations as a
magnetometer but even less descrimination in detail.  It looks through less
dense sedimentary rocks to the denser igneous and metamorphic bed rock
underneath.

I assumed that a sensor could be constructed that would have a "capture"
cone not to different from early heat seeking systems.  I ultimately
postulated a family of systems which took many forms.  It ran the spectrum
of SAMS of the "flying telephone pole" variety for fairly hard targets at
distance and altitude,  down to rather short ranged, approximately a
kilometer or less shoulder fired weapons intended to home in on man portable
grav dampened battle field high energy systems. The shoulder fired weapon
system could also be used to take potshots at people on grav belts, air
rafts and lightly armored grav APCs.  As it were intended for use against
ground targets they were no very bright, and did not have much in the way of
knock down.  Clearly not a system to shoot at a grav tank with and expect
any appreciable effect on target.  A bit like taking a pot shot at an 60\'s
era battle tank with an M-79 or M-203 gernade launcher. Like the old sargent
said when he taught me to shoot the M-79 "...all it will do is flake paint
and annoy them."   I postulated that  man in a gravbelt or on an air raft
could defeat the lower tech level short ranged shoulder fired systems by
staying NOE, putting terrain between himself and the missile or, if he had
enough altitude, going "dead stick", dropping out of the capture cone and
doing a restart.  I only ran the lower tech short ranged system against the
pcs on gravbelts as anything larger would have passed them up for a better
target.   Sorry if this ran a bit long.

  You mean that the famous Postmark Design Bureau is unwilling to consider

them?

  Somehwat more seriously, the missile mounted combustion-laser needs _one_
fuel charge to generate its attack roll at missile det ranges; the ship

<tongue-in-cheek>

The US Army Military Occupational Specialty code for interrogator is
97E.  There is no MOS code for psionic interrogator; psionic ability is
designated in a soldier\'s nine-character MOS by an Additional Skill
Identifier (ASI), which is described below (from the US Army Personnel
Command [PERSCOM] Web site):

**begin quoted material**

a. The regulatory guidance for ASIs is contained in AR 611-201, Enlisted
Career Management Fields and Military Occupational Specialties, and AR
600-200, Enlisted Personnel Management System.

b. ASIs identify specialized skills, qualifications, and requirements
that are closely related to and are in addition to those inherent to the
MOS. ASIs are authorized for use only with designated MOSs and represent
skills too narrow in scope to comprise an MOS.

**end quoted material**

Unfortunately, I don\'t have a current listing of ASIs, so I can\'t tell
you what the appropriate one for psionics is.  I\'ll use an arbitrary
code of "C5" (for "fivesight", just a little better than foresight) to
stand for psionics.  Thus, my nine-character MOS, were I a _certified_
psi talent, would be:

            97E4PC5AE, where--

"97E" is the MOS code;
"4" is my skill level (this indicates that I am a Sergeant First Class,
pay grade E7);
"P" is the Skill Qualification Identifier for "parachutist" (I\'m
qualified to fling my precious, only-one-to-a-customer body out of
moving aircraft);
"C5" is our example ASI for psionics;
"AE" is the two-character language identifier that indicates that I am a
qualified Arabic-Egyptian dialect linguist.

Rest assured that TMLer and Traveller Geeks are not the ones thinking
of economics in an interstellar environment.

A story I forgot to mention when the work for Far Trader was underway:

The stock market bits of Far Trader are mine.  Early on, I was having
difficulty understanding how they would be useful things on an interstellar
scale.  (I\'ve since been enlightened on the subject, but it was a conceptual
hurdle for me; my risk-averse legal training said investment money would
elsewhere).  I mentioned this in a conversation with my step-father,
who knows important people.  Unknown to me, he was going to have
a meeting and dinner with Alice Rivlin, Vice Chair of the U.S. Federal
Reserve Board.  My step-father brings up the subject and they had a
real discussion about stock markets in the Traveller context.  Turns out
Ms. Rivlin had already done some thinking about this, and thought that,
while there would be siginificant difficulties, they could most probably
be overcome.


My step-father isn\'t real creative, so I suspect this story is mostly
true.  Good story either way.

  I recall hearing the complaint that one of the problems in planning at

  Then why are there so many Board, Computer, RPG, games that still use
conventional missiles? Have you read that cool article in the Challenger
mag Called "Lasers in Space combat" In it he talks about all the speed and
math stuff saying it\'s real easy to get a fire resolution with lasers. What
is the very difficult part is getting the beam to hit that target. Now I
can understand that on a large ship (Capitol ship) you could spare (and
should spare) lots of room and power for a gazzilion little lasers with
automated fire control, but the average PC ship don\'t have that luxury.
Heck even a Scout ship with a triple beam laser turret doesn\'t even have to
computer capacity to even run a program that can plot fire resolutions and
have programs for Maneuver and jump. So a fighter with say 8 missiles in an
internal bay with 2 launchers would be a very powerful adversary for that
scout ship.

  Also on the big ships they are not always (At least I would feel) be able
to cover 100% against missiles. That\'s were fighters with stand off
missiles would be able to fire at different attack angles and maybe one or
two (or more) missiles could hit the big ship.

  I know that. But you still can jig and zag. All you have to do is make
small adjustments to your vector at a random rate of change and direction
to have a chance to throw off anyone trying to target you. I think that is
what the "To hit roll" is for. And the evasion is what modifies the to hit
roll. And granted the closer the target is it gets easier to hit. But a
well programmed missile would increase its erratic maneuvering till it got
to the point where it had to commit to a vector that would impact the ship.

   Why not? This is a SciFi game. What\'s to say that the Hi-Tech missiles
use Anti matter/matter drives. I mean the average missile ways 5 tons (I
think I read that some where) so you could (if following current stuff)
make 3 tons of it Propellant (Helium I think) and have a little nodule of
antimatter that destroys the propellant atom by atom getting nearly 100% of
the power of the Propellant. That\'s a pretty powerful engine to push a
little object.

   What about stealth technology? couldn\'t a missile under coast use some
kind of masking to keep from being detected? Like say a skip missile?

  Or it could be drawing the fire from the PD lasers from the currently

    'body' => 'Dear Folks -

Just a quick note to say thanks to Phil Kitching for posting some numbers
about missiles vs PDL\'s. I know all the arguments (this IS a Done To Death
topic) but I think I missed seeing the actual mathematics (although I
spotted the deliberate mistake - I think you meant 10G missiles, not
1000G?).

Could this be added to the FAQ as part of the introductory explanation? It
could be laid out as follows:

- -+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
Topic Title
     "Contact Missiles vs Point Defence"

Briefing
     Since the publication of TNE, many people believe that
contact-detonation space missiles are a crock. They argue that these
missiles would be shot down by point defence systems long before they can
ever contact the target vessel.

Mathematics
     The problem is in the Laws of Physics:
          speed of light             (c) 300,000 km/s
          evasion accel. of missile  (a)       6 G
          target range               (r)   1,000 km
          time available for evasion (t)     6.7 ms
          maximum evasion distance = (d)

          The relevant equations are:
               t = 2r/c = time between lidar pulse and laser pulse
          and
               d = ut + (1/2)at^2
               = 0 + (1/2)a(2r/c)^2
               = 2ar^2/c^2

          Substituting in the figures above, we get:
               d = 2 x 6 x 1000^2 / 300000^2
               = 12,000,000 /   90,000,000,000
               = 0.00013 km
               = 0.13 m
               = 13 cm

     The problem is that the r^2/c^2 term dominates all realistic values of
acceleration until the distance is into the significant fraction of a light
second (even a 10G missile can only evade by 22 cm).

     This also tends to be along the longest dimension of the missile and
most long range missiles will be more than 13 cm long. To evade by 1.5 m (a
reasonable missile size) the missile needs to have an acceleration of
67.5G.

     Alteratively, if you just need a pure sideways "dodge", this means the
target nose-cone area could be as small as 10 cm across. Even so, when
closer in at 100 km, the missile needs a sideways acceleration of 450G (!)
to avoid being hit.

     The net result is that PDL\'s destroy contact missiles (including those
that fragment at a few hundred km) at a rate equal to their ROF. All
missiles will be destroyed somewhere in that last thousand km from their
target.

Solutions to the Problem

     To get around this, TNE introduced non-contact, nuclear-pumped xray
laser missiles. This, in turn, made many long-time players unhappy. They
argued that this application of real-world physics might be nice from a
hard-SF point of view, but it significantly alters the canonical view of
space combat. First, it is a relaxation of the Imperial Rules of War, which
might make sense in the New Era but not the Third Imperium. Second, not all
vessels have point-defence weaponry, such as civilian craft. Third, a
surprised target or one deprived of sensors or power cannot shoot a missile
down.

     Therefore, a number of alternative explanations were created and added
to the mix, such as kinetic-kill missiles (KKM\'s) that explode some
distance from the target and scatter shrapnel into the vessel\'s path.
Others created 10- and 20G missiles (although even these fall victims to
physics, see above), or chemically-pumped laser missiles. Still others
suggested overloading the PDL\'s - what happens when a missile cruiser
shoots at a far trader, for instance (30 turrets x 3 missile racks = 900
missiles!). Finally, other people decided simply to ignore the problem when
using more abstract ship combat systems, such as _High Guard_.
- -+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-

Have I missed anything?

I noticed that there is no recognition of the time it takes to process the
lidar response and calculate a firing solution, or of the time it takes for
the missile to travel that last 1000 km, or of the time it takes for the
PDL to recharge.

Can someone help here?

I\'ve decided not to so that the end-user can add and change them

Uh, I don\'t know.  Guess I was aiming at G:T (1120?).
The reason for omitting borders is so that it would be useful
in different times.  Are there any changes in amber/red zones;
navy/scout bases; x-boat routes; etc. between about 1100 and
1120?

Once the map is done, I can very easily make pre-5th FW,
post-5thFW, and TNE versions.

The only problem with Smart Paper is expense.  There are lots of
hippie^h^h^h^h^h^hagricultural worlds in the Imperium that would just love
to supply lots of cheap fibre based products.  (By-products of the Hadive
trade, of course :)  Apart from shipping costs, paper is essentially
\'free\'.

The problem is, however, bulk.  Any serious amount of information would be
held electronically, and particularly if it has to be presented in multiple
formats/languages.  Whether or not that is some version of Smart Paper is
up to you.  I tend to assume that personal documents, like money, are kept
on some kind of data crystal, which you can where around your wrist or
neck, or have imbedded in your head, or hang off some kind of
body-piercing, or.....  Just wave it past a \'reader\' and the data is
available.  A \'reader\' is essentially just any old computer.

I doubt that hardcopies would be used much on reasonably \'civilised\'
worlds.  Even most backwaters would have at least a few data-readers
(computers capable of understanding Imperial data formats), or else anyone
carrying electronic documents would bring along their own.  Obviously the
latter offers scope for forgery, but any documents from a higher TL are
potentially forged, even hardcopies.

Repulsors are in High Guard and all the later versions of Trav, IIRC.

Repulsors are okay in GT (Expect to see them in future supplements). 
Gravity beam weapons are something from the  baseline GURPS technology
progression that use rapidly oscillating grav fields to do physical damage
right through armor.  That\'s not allowed in GT (reaching through armor
being strictly reserved for meson guns).

Seems to be too that this is how missiles must work.  They may work more like 
mines, a quick very high acc into the projected path of the target, where it 
wold lurk until a proximity trigger would cause it to explode or acc again at 
short range.

I think there are a few.  There\'s at least one new amber zone, at Foelen
where Vargr raiders nuked a Zho world.  I suspect there are others.

Imperial copyright/patent law will force it to happen. As I understand
Marc\'s explanation Imperial Patent law is derivative. Which means it works
like this:
If I invent a line printer I own the design of the printer, and I own any
derivative technology.  That means if someone invents a dot matrix printer I
own it. If someone invents an inkjet print, I own it. If someone invents a
Laser jet printer, I own it.
I can license the design to you and you can manufacture and sell it as long
as I get the royalties.  Under this system how much are you going to put
into R&D?

As a matter of fact the reason megacorp R&D is so hush-hush is that almost
all research is derivative.  That means that you need to develop the
product, then make sure that you either have a license from the owner,
before the owner finds out how much more valuable your discovery makes his
product, so that he doesn\'t jack up the license fees on you, or you can
differentiate the product so much an Imperial Patent Court won\'t consider it
derivative.

  That had crossed my mind, and I\'m sure you\'re right... for data
  communications, common and "smart" protocols are going to be essential.  But
  how far can it reach?  That\'s part of what I want to explore.


As Carlos Alos-Ferrer pointed out in an earlier post, I believe that the key
here is emulation technology.

Right here in 1999 (and definitely with the introduction of Merced in late
2001, PPC G4 in 2000, DEC Alpha, SGI MIPS, Sun SPARC, etc.) we
have chips that can operate much faster than we realistically need -- the only
exception being those pro fields that push the CPU near its
limits, like CAD, 3-D modeling/rendering, file servers for 100\'s of PCs, A/V
post-production --  you get the idea.  How much computer
power does it take to target a missile rack or a sandcaster or a beam laser?
More than the computer built into Apache helicopters or
Ambrams tanks that can register the gunner\'s eye-movements to target their
weapons?  And these are supposed to be crude and primitive
compared to 3I standards.  By that time, CPUs (or their equivalent) will be
easily fast enough to run a very basic \'nanokernel\' style OS that
accommodates thousands of \'plug-in\' emulators.  I\'d say that a TL13 emulation
of a TL10 OS would run much faster than the original.  The
inherent design of CPUs allows for geometric advancement in speed.  This
doesn\'t even take into account what later technologies may add
to the steepness of that curve.

IMTU, the incredible speed and power of 3I computer tech, coupled with software
emulation, allows one to negotiate the difficult currents
of communicating with otherwise incompatible hardware/software (whether legacy
apps from TL10, or designs implemented months or
years distance from wherever you are.)  This is the model under which IP and
HTML were designed, for instance.  Businesses and whole
economies suffer from either 1) several widely used but incompatible systems,
or 2) a single, privately-owned monopoly insuring
compatibility (with its own self-interest in mind, as with any other
monopoly.)  The Vilani Imperium would no doubt make the base OS a
state-controlled \'utility\' of sorts, able to accomplish all the necessities.
Every off-the-shelf starship design would include a computer with
all the appropriate \'plug-in\' emus to allow that ship and all its systems to
operate.  Custom designs would have to include custom emus --
but the basic OS remains throughout the Imperium.  I figure this uniformity
would come about with the advent and proliferation of Jump
Drive (since you need \'modern\' computers to make that work, and the fact that
Jump Drive technology _is_ universal.)  Canon doesn\'t say
that there are different and incompatible methods for achieving Jump Drive --
in fact, it seems to imply that there is only one way to do it.
(Thus the \'marker\' on the TL charts for any given world when they invent or
discover -- or steal and reverse engineer -- Jump capability.)

  I\'m not worried so much about formats... the comm protocol is what\'s
  important.  What I\'m curious about is storage *capacity*.  Just how much
  info gets carted around on an Xboat?

Just think for a second about the kind of storage capacity that was capable 20
years ago.  A 10 MB hard drive was HUGE!  A 100 MB hard
drive was outrageously expensive.  A few years later, the capacity went WAY up
and the price went WAY down.  Nowadays, 36 *GB* hard
drives can be had for a fraction of the cost of a 100 MB drive 10 years ago.
Long-sighted corporations that are heavy into R&D (like IBM,
Bell Labs, TRW (and other military contractors), are even now working on
\'molecular-level\' storage solutions, that will make the size and
capacity of the latest hard drives seem like 1st generation 5.25" floppies in
comparison.  I\'d say that a standard J-4 Xboat would be advanced
enough to have the storage capacity to hold every piece of data (including
images) that we have uncovered and/or added to in our history on earth!  In
just a small \'chip\' in its computer, at that.  Any molecular biologist will
tell you that the information stored in a single microscopic
strand of DNA can hold more data than any computer that now exists.  Did I
mention _microscopic_?  If it\'s large enough to actually see it
with the naked eye, a computer utilizing this type of \'molecular storage\' would
easily be able to store all the info you could possibly need.
The medium for this storage would most likely be crystalline, or biomass.  The
structure of either can possess trillions of possible
permutations in each microscopic \'slice.\'  Possibly several orders more than
trillions.

  They don\'t call it Plug-n-Pray for nothing. :)   Though I figure what you\'ve
  presented is probably pretty accurate, I have trouble imagining it being
  universal enough to never run into problems.

I agree -- problems will always arise, to some extent.  But the fact that there
are functioning Jump Drives all across the Imperium and
beyond tells me something about the feasibility of universal technology in the
TU.

  It\'s uncertain, but from the history of TL progression in the 3I it almost
seems like progress at the upper limit of 3I TL occurs only during peacetime
inside stable (non-expanding) borders. The Imperium doesn\'t go from TL C to
D until half a millenium of expansion (& warfare) is behind them; from ~650
the 3I only goes to TL E before 1000.

  Even given the above the jump from TL F in 1002 to early G in 1100+ seems
highly strange - although expansion isn\'t going on there\'s the rebuilding
of the damage from the Solomani Rim War (and the lost investment to pay for
Imperial forces to fight it), and then further struggles with the Zho\'s,
who for all their limitations can put a lot of force into contact with the
Spinward extremity of an empire that\'s mostly awfully far away and awkward
of access.

  OTOH, if TL\'s are non-linear (and there\'s nothing to indicate the contrary,
AFAIK) then asides from the Darrian and perhaps the Ancient anomalies there
are no discrepancies we can be sure of.

  {
    'body' => 'OK, here is my brief hand-wave for missiles:

1.  Lasers aren\'t as good as everyone seems to think.  The basics of the
"PDL must win" argument miss 3 very important factors:

    a. Accuracy.  Who says lasers are 100% accurate?  A 1 degree
innaccuracy, at 100 km, is a miss- oh my god, I can\'t remember the @#$%
formula.  Could someone please remind me?  Anyway, there are quite a few
good arguments to suggest that a laser will be off-target by some amount-
vibration, calibration, "inherent accuracy"- even recoil, if a gaseous media
is used.

    b. Computation/aiming  time. It seems to be taken for granted that a
defending ship is always using its full active sensor suite to detect and
cook incoming missiles, and that its ladar has multiple channels that switch
targets intantaneously.  It also assumes that targetting information has no
processing time, and that the PDL needs no time to track the target.

    c. Missile evasion.  First of all, if a missile with a diameter of 10cm
evades 22cm by the time the laser arrives, then the laser needs to saturate
an area of 1520 cm2, looking for a target of only 79 cm2 (BTW, I am geometry
challenged, but I\'m sure someone will let me know if I\'ve goofed on my
math).  What is the beam diameter of an average PDL, and remember, unless it
delivers all of its energy simultaneously, there will be a "footprint", not
a clean punch through. Assuming a 1cm beam, it looks like 19 shots will be
required- if the PDL can fire that many times at once, as otherwise, the
area to be soaked expands fast enough that a new fire solution is better.

    d. Decoys.  The acceleration test shouldn\'t work.  My missile releases a
dozen globs of super-quick-setting ablative foam with tiny little engines
and a "follow-me" guidance, which should be difficult to tell apart, as long
as they basically stay within a KM or so of each other.  All the target sees
is 12-15 little 10cm circular radiators coming at him.  Just makes things
more interesting.


OK, just my Cr.02.  As you can tell, I LIKE missiles, old CT ones, TNE ones,
all of \'em.  BTW, has anyone thought about a variant of the chemical det
laser, the Self Forging Fragment?  Basically just a variant on the HEAT
warhead, you use an explosive charge as a "gun" to fire a slug of metal at
*VERY* high accelerations.  Much easier than a contact hit, but not as
deadly as det-lasers.

Same reason that so many have ships that manuever like aircraft.
Because that\'s what people *expect*, not what things are likely to
*really* be like.

I haven\'t seen it, but Bruce (or someone else on the list) *works* with
lasers and aiming systems (not classified, because they aren\'t
weapons). And *he* disagrees. He sees no reason why the techniques he
uses can\'t be used with weapons grade lasers. You use the *same*
optiics for the laser and for it\'s aiming lidar, so the laser *will*
hit what it\'s aimed at. Aiming based on radar will be less accurate,
but still pretty good.

True enough. Small ships are more vulnerable.

Sure, but it\'s pretty useless against any decent *military* vessel.
Which is why folks wonder why there are all these fighters. :-)

The approach angle can\'t be counted on. The orientation of the ship and
the direction of travel aren\'t related.  Even if you are using the main
drive, your velocity vector and acceleration vector aren\'t going to
line up all the time.

All you need to do to make most angles pretty damn useless is spin the
ship *slowly* about the long axis. With decently placed turrets, that\'s
going to give you full sphere coverage. Objects nearer the fore/aft
axis will be the *easiest* to hit in that they are covered by turrets
more of the time. objects directly "abeam" will get the least coverage.

Try a used game store. Or a copy of one of the CT books or supplements

That\'s the thing. Traveller is a "hard" SF game. That means there are
limits that apply to everybody. 

According to design rules, you can\'t fit a fusion plant into a missile,
and antimatter isn\'t available. Thus the limited delta-V for the
missiles.

Since you can\'t build "thruster plates" small enough for a missile, the
missile is using a *reaction* drive. And *any* reaction drive that can
give the standard levels of performance is about as stealthy as a
magnesium flare.

Under *coast*, stealthing is possible. But the trouble is that your
position and vector are known when you cut the engine. And in space,
you\'ll continue along that vector until you hit something or are
deflected by the gravity of something *big*. So even though you are
coasting, your position is still known with high accuracy. 

If you can manage to be coasting *before* the ship gets inside its
sensor range, then stealth might let you get close enough to fire up
your engines *if* you get close enough. But being in the right position
on anything close to the right vector is going to be sheer luck. 

Though I suspect that this is how "mines" would work. Drifting,
stealthed missiles that only fire up once you get too close for a miss.

Run.

No, seriously, RUN from the first firefight into the city itself. You are
not really supposed to take on those guys yet - you need *real* weapons and
armour, both available in the city. This is Law level 0 Efate, after all.
(Actually, the *real* weapons - PGMP\'s - are for sale in the floating city
to the north. Hire a grav speeder. Buy the weapons. Ship them to Alell.
Have your Intrusion PC slip them past Customs disguised as French loaves.
Sell them to make a killing. Buy a j2 drive.).

...but to win firefights, do the following:

1.   Immediately you get into a firefight, stop the action. Save the game.
2.   Split the "big guy" into your component party.
3.   In turn, get everyone to aim at the bad guy. Make sure they have all
reloaded (Tip: it\'s preferable not to force the PC with poor weapons skills
to fire near another PC, but sometimes this may be unavoidable).
4.   Personally control the PC with the best weapon skills and/or the best
weapon. You\'ll be able to fire faster.
5.   Restart the action and blast away! The other PC\'s will now fire and
reload automatically (assuming they have ammo).
6.   If someone is hit badly, freeze the action. Get the medic or person
with the med kit to heal everyone back up to full strength.
7.   Repeat #4!

It\'s probably a good idea to get used to the interface in a non-combat
setting. Stop and aim at a tree, for instance. You can\'t blow up the
landscape without a grenade launcher or PGMP, but you can shoot at it.

    'from' => 'Black ICE wombat@premier.net',
    'body' => 'Having followed the recent "Fighter Stuff" thread, I decided to point
out some uses for fighters that don\'t contradict all the arguments
against their use in attacking capital assets:

1.  Support for ground troops.  Fighters designed with an Airframe
configuration can provide a measure of support for ground troops in a
planetary assault, in both the air superiority and ground attack
missions.  Are they as effective in these roles as planet-based aircraft
of similar tech level?  Probably not.  However, they are better than
nothing.

2.  Attacks against civilian-type ships.  As has been noted, large
military craft can handily defeat fighters.  However, civilian vessels
are much more vulnerable to fighters, as they generally lack both
sufficient armament to destroy the fighters quickly, and sufficient
armor to withstand the weapons that a fighter can carry.

3.  Support to commerce raiding.  A commerce raiding force, equipped
with a number of fighters, can place the commander of any convoy escort
in a dilemma:  Attack the main raider force, and allow the fighters to
ravage the convoy; or keep some escorts back to deal with the fighters,
and risk having the main raider force defeat the escorts piecemeal.

4.  Anti-fighter duties.  This is a corollary to Point 3 above.  One way
for a convoy escorting force to protect its charges against raiding
fighters is to have fighters at its own disposal.  If the raiding
fighters have to deal with defending counterparts, they are less
effective in shooting up those vulnerable civilian ships.

5.  Patrol and picket duties.  Larger fighters, such as the AuricTech
F5A-1 "Demon" (soon to be posted to my Web site), are suitable for
patrols of shipping lanes (i.e., the routes to and from Jump points). 
Ethically-challenged owners of armed starships will find their felonious
intentions complicated by the presence of patrolling heavy fighters. 
Similarly, fighters can provide early warning to the approach of enemy
forces.

6.  Quick reaction forces.  IMHO, it is easier to maintain a rotating
force of fighters on "strip alert" than any larger vessels.  As I see
it, prepping a ship or boat to sortie takes time based on its size. 
Thus, a small craft such as a fighter, or even several fighters, can get
underway to investigate a possible problem more rapidly than a larger
SDB or starship.  The fighters may not be able to deal with the problem
themselves, but they can at least provide the heavier follow-on forces
with useful intelligence about the situation.

Bottom line:  Can fighters expect to engage enemy warships and win? 
Probably not.  Are fighters useful in support roles?  I think so.

Rob\'s commercial software is still available from http://www.bits.org.uk/

 The US Army Military Occupational Specialty code for interrogator is
 97E.  There is no MOS code for psionic interrogator; psionic ability is
 designated in a soldier\'s nine-character MOS by an Additional Skill
 Identifier (ASI), which is described below (from the US Army Personnel
 Command [PERSCOM] Web site):
 
 **begin quoted material**
 
 a. The regulatory guidance for ASIs is contained in AR 611-201, Enlisted
 Career Management Fields and Military Occupational Specialties, and AR
 600-200, Enlisted Personnel Management System.
 
 b. ASIs identify specialized skills, qualifications, and requirements
 that are closely related to and are in addition to those inherent to the
 MOS. ASIs are authorized for use only with designated MOSs and represent
 skills too narrow in scope to comprise an MOS.

xxxx
Like sniper, aquatic, augmented battle armor?
xxxx
 
 **end quoted material**
 
 Unfortunately, I don\'t have a current listing of ASIs, so I can\'t tell
 you what the appropriate one for psionics is.  I\'ll use an arbitrary
 code of "C5" (for "fivesight", just a little better than foresight) to
 stand for psionics.  Thus, my nine-character MOS, were I a _certified_
 psi talent, would be:
 
             97E4PC5AE, where--
 
 "97E" is the MOS code;
 "4" is my skill level (this indicates that I am a Sergeant First Class,
 pay grade E7);
 "P" is the Skill Qualification Identifier for "parachutist" (I\'m
 qualified to fling my precious, only-one-to-a-customer body out of
 moving aircraft);
 "C5" is our example ASI for psionics;
 "AE" is the two-character language identifier that indicates that I am a
 qualified Arabic-Egyptian dialect linguist.
 
 </tongue-in-cheek> >>

Thanks for all the info, Sarge, is there some place, on the web,  that has a 
listing of the MOSs and ASIs or in two years to I need to go down to the 
recruiter\'s and sign on the dotted line?

People are always extrapolating our current progress as it
is clear this will continue indefinately.  We have no idea
if our current rate of progress isn\'t anomolous, what
the difficult in advancing the TL\'s the games have mapped
out is, or if our current culture centered on the concept
of progress for progress\' sake will last.  I wouldn\'t get
too hung up on how fast the Imperium advances.

Beside, a case can be made that if you really want to extrapolte
our current progress, the future will be unlike we can even
imagine in a fairly short periods of time and that _all_
SF is wrong.  If you just put in the rate of increase of
the rate of progress, then you come to what is called "a
technological singularity".

(If most predictions of the future held true we would all
be driving nuclear powered aircars and taking vacations on
the moon... :-)

The decoys were to fly in front of the main flock of missiles incoming at a 
target.  No ships back there.  They\'re *WAY* back out of harm\'s way.

Profitability is not terribly correlated with size.  If you look at publicly traded companies in 
the modern US it tends to be _negatively_ correlated with size because of all the tech start-ups 
and what-not.  Given the slow rate of technical change in the Imperium, this is not likely to be 
the case there.

When you say profit as a percent of revenue, people generally call this the "profit margin."  
This is by no means the only measure of profit.  One that is closer to what economists are 
interested in is Return on Investment.  This measures the "profit" (revenue-costs) divided by 
the amount of money invested in the business.  This gives a clearer idea of whether the company 
has been a good investment or not.  This is an important distinction in capital-intensive 
industries.

A reasonable max for Return on Investment is around 10%.  Given that the Imperial economy is 
growing at less than 1%, an ROI of 10% indicates that the company is in a highly "defensible" 
business position and is able to keep prices above what they would be in a competitive market.

	It certainly sounds like you have missed something but it is impossible for me to tell what 
without more information.  I carefully worked out the freight rates in Far Trader so that they 
would result in reasonable ROIs for various types of ships and strategies.  My guess is that you 
are assuming a 95% loading on a 20,000dton ship and giving yourself the "tramp freight" rate.  
This isn\'t expressly forbidden by the rules but it is highly unlikely.

  Some of my favorite space games had real physics. \'Mantis, Elite
Frontiers (Actually had gas giant skimming to refuel), and a few others I
can\'t remember off hand. They had Missiles that appeared to follow the
rules, and out of a 8 missile load 25% hit ratio was good for me(I\'m
actually terrible at flight games, but they are still fun). But you are
right, most people are mislead by the current popular games, but that
doesn\'t invalidate the use of conventional missiles. As for board games, I
have Brilliant Lances\' but find it hard (read impossible) to find anyone
that is remotely interested in playing it. One friend looked at it and
commented that he had lost his slide rule. :)

  Ok it\'s in Challenge #71 on page 26 and is 4 pages long. Written by Frank
Chadwick and David Nilson. Its very good describing how lasers work and he
mentions why DL missiles were introduced. And explains them well. But it
still doesn\'t make conventional missiles obsolete for me (IMTU I think
that\'s the right acronym) there just harder to hit with, but have the
potential to do more damage.

  Does abeam mean to the rear? Cause that is where I feel is the weakest
point for any cap ship. Which probably has a really lousy yaw rate due to
its mass.

IMTU, fixed mounted weapons on a fighter do not require a separate
gunner.  The computer can handle it, or the pilot can manually fire the
weapon if you want to add the pilot\'s gunnery skill as a DM.

Shouldn\'t that be C2?  "Second Sight"?  ;-)

This could be refined into a more detailed code.
The subcodes aren\'t really needed since they\'re
available to anyone with the discipline.

A -  Awareness
  I - Suspended Animation
  II - Psionically-Enhanced Strength
  III - Psionically-Enhanced Endurance
  IV - Regeneration

  IV - Read Surface Thoughts
  V - Send Thoughts
  VI - Shield
  VII - Telempathy

P - telePortation

These, followed by a number indicating skill level could totally summarize
psionic skills.

Adopting some of the ideas here for an \'Extended UPP" might
be very useful.  Especially for Spear-Carrier and NPC handling.
Would it be worth trying to create one?

I\'m thinking that some useful categories might be:
race
apparent age
career + rank
possible abbreviated skill codes (e.g., AS1, PL2 - Astrography 1, Pilot 2).

  So having inertial nullifiers (grav compensators) isn\'t Hi SciFi? And
grav plates? From what I understand from my short time reading this list
some scientists have made \'Anti Matter\'. Yet we still don\'t have a clue as
to what gravity really is. We know its effects, we can measure it, we can
predict, but we can\'t create it, modify it or control it. 
  Granted I am way out of my league in this part of science, but I would
assume that it would be big news if we could harness gravity (or even
figured out what it really is). Although you are right about the TL for
antimatter, and was a poor example but there are I think still powerful
engines for missiles still.

  Ok I got a fix for that. In the atmosphere we see light from the engines
flare behind or to the sides easily because of the denseness of the
particles in the air. However today fighter jets have the same problem, but
what if you recessed and zigzagged the exhaust ports of the jets engine (as
is done with todays stealthy planes) that would reduce the light and heat
emissions. 
  But in space simply recessing the engine enough to cover its flare (or
whatever it\'s called) to keep it from being viewed from anywhere but
directly to the rear. Although this would depend on if the engine had any
particle emissions of some kind of its own.

  With special materials and coatings a missile Particularly Radar and
Light absorbing stuff, shaped correctly would even mislead a the most
sophisticated sensor system, and with the recessed engine stealth engine,
and a electronics suite that included light wave and radar emitters.
  BTW I am taking for granted Ladar is high speed multi-beam laser radar?
If it is, it would still have some of the weaknesses of radar, and some of
it\'s own. It\'s just that it can be produced at a lower energy cost and be
more easily focused. I think? (BTW I was a Radar technician (not engineer)
for the military before I got out. But that don\'t mean I know what I am
talking about.)

 What I have always thought of as Skip missiles is a missile that runs
silent for awhile and goes active for a brief time in order to get a lock.
Maybe like a milli second or so. Then corrects it\'s course and runs silent
again.

  Bravo I agree whole hardedly. The MS people touted how much faster Win95
ran over 3.1 or dos. Well thats because they ran it on a machience 3-4
times as fast, and still only gained a 20% increase (Instead of a 300%).


  BTW I would think that like today, different corperations have there own
OS that they work with. But programs would be written in a compatable

  Well I believe Hi Guard states that each separate weapon needs a gunner
and it says that on fighters they are fixed. But me, I say that if they are
fixed and in the same arc, then the gunner could handle them all, but if
they were in different arcs or one was a turret (which by HG you can\'t do)
you should need a gunner. But that is how I would run it.

You missed one:

7:  Like present day missile and torpedo boats, fighters are useful in
"restricted waters". In places such as gas giants and in low orbit,
fighters can use "cover" to get close enough to launch a devestating
attack. Doubtless there are other examples of "restricted waters" were
fighters would be useful.

Sure have.

The last time this debate came up, I seem to recall that the end result
was a 100MCr kinetic kill missile that released enough superdense pellets
at 10,000km so that a Tigress at 6G could not evade all of them but would
be severely damaged by a single pellet.

If you every wondered what could be launched by a factor 9 missile bay...

IIRC, the proposed countermeasure was the FS Signature "point defence" laser
with 650MJ, ROF800 and a range of half a million km

The laser costs less than the missile and fits in a standard barbette.
It can destroy lots of missiles using battery power, although the lights
go dim when running off main engines.

Using FF&S2, at TL15, the barbette could include a 500,000km LIDAR and
a factor 9Fib computer for about 20MCr.

Speaking as a Brit, I\'m not sure that I\'m  happy about the idea of every
freighter that you meet mounting a couple of these for "missile defence".
After all, my free trader costs less than one of those missiles, has less
armour, less manoeuvre and isn\'t pilotless.

The problem is not to camuflage the exhaust, but the heat of the exhaust. In
space there is no way of getting rid of heat except to radiate it. A reaction
drive is going to produce heat and that heat has to go somewhere. When the heat
is radiated out, to keep the missile from melting it will stand out as a sore
thumb on every sensor in the vicinity.

Solutions applied on atmospheric missiles and planes simply doesn\'t cover since
it is not a comperable problem. Space is big, cold and hard to move quickly in.
If you want to change course, you need to spit out some mass and this action is
going to produce heat. Producing heat means that you\'ll be easily detected. It\'s
simply the nature of space that makes combat with anything else that
beam-weapons very hard.

The thing is that if it is using a drive, it will be hot and easily detected by
passive sensors. Once it turns its drive of to hide from these sensors it will
be on a set course that is possible to calculate. I doesn\'t matter how har it is
to detect by active means at this point, cause you know were it will go, so you
simply stay out of its way. The problem is the heat it produces and simply how
extremly easy it is to detect a hot object in space.

The problem is that to correct its course it has to be operative for more than
seconds. Changing courses in space cost a lot of power or time. You simply can\'t
do it without telling everybody were you are.

Gunners are cheap, at about half a ton and half a dton apiece. Where they
give you an advantage is it\'s easier to get a good pilot and a good gunner
than a good pilot/gunner.

PD lasers are part of a layered solution. The other layers include dash

Cool. So as soon as our disposable sensor platform\'s AEMS system lights up
the missile, it deploys it\'s limited supply of chaff.

Nope. An accelerating missile will be lit up like a knocking shop on payday.

Thats why ships have essentially disposable sensor platforms (one of the
many uses of fighters that dont involve pitting them against military ships).

The problem is is all the bells and whistles are increasing the mass of the
missile, which will reduce it\'s thrust, which will make it more vulnerable
to counterfile and interception.

Each battery needs a gunner, plus a chief gunner on big boats.  IMTU, these are called the CWO, or Chief Weapons Officer, sometimes called \'Guns\' by skippers passing out the accolades.

Including the ability to run Linux under Windows under Linux if you want to

Contrast that with the old Bell System. They designed things to be
*usable* for 20+ years. The stuff where there was a *need* to upgrade
sooner got shipped to places that could use it (ie it was better than
what they had, and due to the durability it was both worth buying *and*
worth selling). There\'s phone gear in some places in Africa and Asia
that that\'s been thru *5* such moves, starting out in big cities in the
US, migrating to smaller ones, and then finally to the third world. And
given decent maintenance, it could still be running a century from now.

I figure that rates will be based on the *compressed* size of the data.
Which means that pre-compressing your data (or encrypting it) may carry
a hefty surcharge simply because that means that the compression
algorithms of the Xboat system can\'t do as much with it.

Try compressing a file with some "so-so" compression algorithm, such as
ARC, then compress that with ZIP or RAR. Then compress the original
file with ZIP or RAR. The second file will be a *lot* smaller. Do this
with a *bunch* of files, and use RAR in "solid" format (where the
compression tables carry over from one file to the next) and the
difference gets *really* big.

But since it\'s impractical to compress the stuff and *then* give a rate
(plus, that effectively punishes you if you develop better compression
algorithms). So I expect that traffic will be divided into categories
based on how well they are willing to *admit* to being able to compress
various types of data.

Well, text is still text. Plain text in "unicode" or the equivalent
will be the cheapest, and compress really well. Hypertext will be
bulkier and thus more expensive. Anything that hypertext/unicode can\'t
handle gets sent as a graphics image.

Now, assuming that other races aren\'t *that* much more sensitive than
we are, sound and data formats are likely predictable. "CD quality"
audio is "good enough" for anything short of esoteric research. The
number of channels of audio *may* be more of a variable. So the low end
is 64kbps audio (like a phone line) which gets 8-bit samples at
something like 8 kHz (I\'d have to check my notes for exact figures).
High end is CD quality (16-bit samples, 44 kHz sample rate, 2 or more
channels). 

Graphics range from low-res fax (monochrome, 48 dpi or so) on up to
"photo quality" (16 million colors(?) at a few thousand dpi). 

The final category would be "generic binary". That covers anything not
"text", "sound" or "graphics". And it gets charged the highest rate as
it\'s assumed to be not very compressible.

BTW, the bottleneck with x-boats is *not* storage. It\'s I/O. Getting
all that data onto and off of the X-boat. Contrary to what we\'ve been
told, the traffic *isn\'t* sent via radio/laser to the tender as it\'s
rendezvousing with the x-boat. There\'s not enough *bandwidth* to do so
in a reasonable amount of time. Assuming *perfect* conditions you get
*one* channel with terabit bandwidth for the laser, and a much lower
bandwidth channel or channels in the microwave range. You can\'t use
multiple lasers because they\'ll interfere with each other due to beam
spread at the ship.

So instead the really *high* priority messages will get sent, then some
of the well compressed unimportant stuff.

Once the x-boat docks, they hook up the data transfer cable. Picture
something with anywhere from dozens to *hundreds* of fiber optic
channels, running at terabit rates. It runs faster because you\'ve got
so many channels running in parallel.

You mean the designs that the library shows didn\'t work out 3 sectors

Unless they are the start of a new TL, they\'ve almost certainly been
thought of *somewhere* in the centuries that the current TL has been in
existence.

The point you are missoing is that short of a new TL, you only get
*marginal* performance increases. Which isn\'t enough to justify being
non-standard.

Again, you\'ve just described a change in TL. For that, you upgrade. But
do you replace your current car with a new one just because it gets 40
mpg instead of 39? Not until your old one *needs* replacing, or you\'ve
got some other *compelling* reason.

No, we are saying that the rate of development is going to slow down.

No, because they got lucky and wound up in control of a majority of the
market. So they pull (illegal!) stunts like that to try to keep the

Sure, but until you get the fundamental breakthrough(s) that asllow you
to move up a tech level, you quickly find the limits of your current
TL. The more worlds you have, the faster they\'ll explore all the
possibilities.

True. But short of a change in TL, things will quickly become well

The comm lag doesn\'t help. 

But consider this. Back in the early 80s there were *hundreds* of disk
formats. And *four* different kinds of "3 inch" disks, all *physically*
incompatible. More recently, there were 5 or 6 (maybe more) hard disk
interfaces. MFM, RLL, ESDI, SCSI, IDE. Now it\'s shaken out to just SCSI
and IDE (with various improved versions of each). Heck, even many of
your "incompatible" computers probably use SCSI drives.

Given a century or so with no TL changes, and things will have *really*
shaken out.

I know for a *fact* that I could take a hard drive from a VAX and use

But again, your "runaway innovation" *requires* frequent TL changes.
Which the official background says *don\'t* happen. If it\'d taken 200
years to get from tubes to transistors, I bet that tubes would have
gotten *really* standardized. Heck, as it was we went ahead and
invented the tube equivalent of ICs to deal with EMP back in the late
50s and early 60s. It\'s been abandonerd since, but it was pretty
amazing for what it was. Tubes the size of a dime that *couldn\'t* burn
out. Entire subsystems (ie multiple cards and a card cage) built into a
ceramic "brick".

Sure, but you\'ve just described a TL change. So things get a bit hairy
when a new TL is discovered. But given the number of systems that can\'t
afford to retool from "tubes" to "transistors/ICs" right away, and all
the old gear that works ok, support for the *older* stuff will persist
for a long, long time. A TL-15 starport will likely at least have
records of stuff clear back to TL-8, TL-10 for sure.

Consider an 1890s steamship pulling into a modern day shipyard for
repairs/overhaul. They may have to hand blueprints for some of the
parts to someone to scan into the computer-controlled machine tools to
fabricate some of the parts, but it\'ll be doable. 

And consider what happens right here on earth with some "obsolete" hig
tech gear. For a long time, when a phone company upgraded their phone
switch from the old electro-mechanical clunker that\'d probably last a
century given decent maintenance to a fancy new electronic switch, the
old switch was crated up and shipped to some third world country where
they were trying to get by with manual switchboards. 

Likewsise, when your world decides it can afford the move from TL 12 to
TL 13 in some industry, the old tooling will quyite likely be sold to
some TL11 world that wants to upgrade thatr industry to TL 12.

Because *major* innovations occur infrequently enough that there\'s time
for the technology to stabilize. And a *lot* of worlds are at lower
tech levels for various reasons, so when they upgrade, it\'s likely to
be to the "best" of a new TL, not the "pre standards" stuff.

But the situation is different than the way you are picturing it. If
some third world country wanted to computerize *now* they won\'t be
using MFM or ESDI drives. Those were losers in the marketplace.

A TL-9 world is in contact (even if at some remove) with worlds all the
way up to TL-15 (and possibly 16). 

This means that the whole picture is very skewed. By adding in the
tranport times, and the likelihood that you get charged extra if you
are importing TL 12 gear and trying to pay for it with TL-9 products,
you can\'t *afford* the highest TL for many things.

Instead, you\'ll pay the premium for *some* high TL gear and sufficient
supplies of spare parts. But for anything in *common* use, it\'s going
to be mostly at the TL you can support with *local* industry.

Over the *millenia* that civilization has been around, what can be
supported at a given TL has been pushed to the limit. That is, for a
given set of factories & tooling, the "improvements" were thought of
*somewhere* centuries ago. If you *do* come up with a new trick, it\'ll
be both a rare thing, and likely an incremental improvement. 

So for all TLs up to "common interstellar", the IDP lists things that
have been "tinkered with" for *centuries*. Which means that there
*can\'t* be the sort of innovation you are thinking of. It\'s *already*
been done, usually long, long ago. 

The higher TLs will have more room for the sort of thing you are
thinking of.

Hah ! it\'s far more mature than any other desktop OS currently available.
Remember, the core concepts of Linux were in place before the Mac or the PC
existed.

It\'s only drawbacks for home use are the fact that it doesn\'t run the
Microsoft Office suite or the latest 3D games.
(it\'s actually easier getting old DOS games to run under Linux than it is to
get them to work under Win 95/98 )

LinuxConf makes it real simple to do just about anything without openeing
vi, and why do you need sendmail if you\'ve got KDE ? I just set the KDE mail
client to point to my POP/SMTP server and away it went.

Pardon ? I installed RH6.0 a week ago off of a single CD, including Corel\'s
Word Perfect

BTW, it was the simplest install I\'ve ever done since DOS 6.0,  just needed
me to tell it the refresh rate of the monitor, everything else worked
straight out of the box, easier than a Win 98 install.

It took me longer to find a copy of a freeware NFS daemon for NT so I could
access my NT Server\'s data discs from the Linux workstation.

Hmmmmmmmm.  I\'m not *too* up on KDE yet; haven\'t played with it for more than

SuSe 6.1 comes with *5* install CDs.  And you gotta *change* them.  A *LOT*.  
Minimal install of a SuSe is about 900 megs; a bit on the hefty side, 
IMNSFBHO.  And the directory setup is a touch weird for me; I\'ve *NEVER* seen 
an /opt directory til I got SuSe.  I *know* Red Hat is only 1 CD; I\'ve got 
serious history with Red Hat.  <grin>

I\'ve never installed Win98, though I\'ve done a few Win95\'s in my time as well 
as RH 3.03\'s & 4.1\'s.

Never played with Win-Not Today, so my opinion is worse than useless on it.  
But the main reason I switched providers to Earthlink was that my old ISP, 
Glass City, ran on NT Server, and at *LEAST* 6 times a week, their Ascend 
terminal flat out refused to start PPP for me.  I was even more unthrilled 
when their miserable excuses for \'customer service\' and \'technical support\' 
tried telling me that that *NEVER* happened, and *all* the \'problems\' I was 
having every now and again would automagically disappear the instant I 
installed Win9x.  I called Earthlink that afternoon, and except for them 
being spamblocked from a good many email sites I\'d like access to and some 
trouble uploading my web pages at the start, I\'ve been fairly happy with them.

Well, I was a bad boy and didn\'t use your figures. I tried to work it from first
principles using Earth/Sol as the base - I probably got it wrong.

Sol 100 D = 140 Mkm = max jump mask. I reasoned Earth was masked nearly 50% of
the time and that the average mask was 70% of max mask (using trig). 

Max mask = 100 hrs at .43 G
Avg mask = 35 hrs at .43G (50% of 70% of 100)

So 70 hours per jump average masking.

I have downloaded the masking stuff from your web page, and I will analyze it.

>(14032/264 + 600/30) * 0.95 * 2  = 139.0 hours to unload and load again.

1) I don\'t believe unloading rate isn\'t scalable. I assumed the figures were for
a free trader with a single hold & single access point.  The mega-freighter at
the back of FT says it has multiple holds that unload independently. I assumed
this was to get around this limit. I was assuming I could do likewise.  FT also
suggests that scheduled freighters have very low port time. 

2) The empty turrets only add only a tiny amount to profitability. 
   I will remove them.

OK corrected. I was using 1500 per month average. But not a major cost.

Isn\'t refuel time scalable for larger ships?

I was not assuming skimming which takes way too much time, and this ship is USL
anyway.

OK I will use refined fuel and throw away the fuel processors, for the purposes
of this thread.

What is the official line on the availability of unrefined fuel post Far Trader?

I will have to investigate, though I was assuming a pure shipping company.

I was using the figure from the sidebar in Far Trader which said 95%.

However jump masking time should go down as loading decreases as you can
accelerate faster. I will build this into the model.

Agreed. I was looking for a canon value for insurance/loss premium. 
I will use 3%. Ouch that hurts.

I will pay them.

I have added a 10DT ships boat with enough seats.

Preliminary Result: 22.1 Jumps/year 

without loss premium: 79% Profit at 95% loading, break-even 65% loading.

with loss premium: 23% profit. break-even 81% loading. i.e. Not Good.

OK. Got to reduce port time.

If this is true, you can *never* hit anything at any sort of range
whatsoever. You have to have phenomenal accuracy to get combat ranges out
to the 300 000km plus that Traveller has always assumed.

Anyway, lasers are that accurate today ...

Assume engagement range is 1000 km, and missiles are going at 10 km/second.
We have lots of time to resolve them. Note that we have to use *a* active
sensor suite, not neccessarily ours - a fighter will do nicely to be lit up
and die form those nasty spinal mounts.

We dont neccessarily need multi-switching LADARs. I dont know about anyone
else, but my standard Signature barbette has it\'s own LADAR.

How many gees does it have to be pulling to evade 22 cm at 1000 km (0.03

20 shots will be 50 seconds with a Signature class. How many km per second

Tiny engines wont put out enough newtons to serve any purpose whatsoever.

Nope. If you accelerate it to, say, 20 km per second, then it still means
you have to get entirely too close for it to work. If you insist, use a
fusion gun (1).

I like conventional missiles too. Missiles with buckets of ball bearings
are excellent weapons against civilians, and make great anti-missile
weapons too (Missiles Dont Shoot Back). Little Bubba, the infamous t-plate

It always hits, apparently. Don\'t ask me, I\'m only a failed astrophysicist,

Everything you ask is assumed or stated somewhere in the rules. Probably
FF&S. I would agree that detecting probable missile launch would cause
a ship to go active before the missiles were inside 100,000km.
This could be an advantage to the firing ship if it stays passive.

You sums are probably correct. Unfortunately they are wrong.

Firstly, a 10cm sphere is very small for a missile with the power to
pull 6G continuously for three hours (a standard 6G6 missile).

If it is 10cm diameter and a metre long, like a small sidewinder, it is
still too small and if it only presents its diameter towards me, its only
possible acceleration is towards me, which I can ignore, so your
evasion distance is about 0cm.

For maximum evasion, you have to turn sideways on and now you have to evade
by 50cm.

>    d. Decoys. <snip>

Perfectly valid solution, but remember the requirements for endurance
and acceleration if they are to match the main missile. The sums are
that you might as well fire more missiles.

There\'s nothing wrong with liking missiles. TL9 ships with TL9 lasers
and no computing power will suffer.

TL15 battlewaggons seem to just ignore them, so whilst they can be a useful
addition to a couple of fighters for customs work, they don\'t justify
deploying hundreds of fighters in a battle with no role, which was (IIRC)
where this particular thread started.

Note the impact of the boneheaded decision by David Pulver to charge 20% of
ship volume for streamlining. This utterly stupid decision meant that the
only economic starship designs were unstreamlined - as a quick example,
make a Far Trader unstreamlined, and it\'s cargo capacity roughly doubles.

Honestly, it\'s nearly as bad as the silly distance DMs for GT starship
combat, which then had to compensated for by the +10 \'point defense
modifier\' to stop contact missiles being dominant.

Nope. You wont get both Cr 550 a parsec and 95% loading. If you want 95%
loading you are going to have to have cargo booked long in advance, and
thus you\'ll get paid a lot closer to Cr 400/parsec. If you want to be a
\'big tramp\' (and there\'s nothing wrong with a 10 kton Tramp Freighter),
then you\'ll get paid more per dton, but will tend to have less full holds.

At Cr 800 per jump, you get revenue of about MCr 11.12, which takes your
profit margin down a fair bit.

Chris Thrash also made some points about loading time and such.

There is also the question of acquisition time.  It take time to move the
laser turrets onto target and resolve the .00000001 degrees of arc necessary
to hit a less than 1 meter object at 1000k+ meter.  You are looking at
resolving very small angles very fast and very acurately while moving heavy
turrets with considerable ineria.  Just what are the mechining toloerences
of those turrents\' positioners and how is the gear slop messured and
corrected by the gravity focusing system in the lasers?  You are talking
some serious measurments and mathamatical computations to deal with slop and
paralax.  Where are these problem resolved?  It could be that there is a
very limited \'anti-missle\' range to lasers due to these limitations and that
limited range and responce time can be used to overload a ships defences.

Umm, no.

I acually did the original calculation for 1,000G missiles at 1,000km,
figuring that this was a reasonable upper limit for target distance/
acceleration against kinetic kill missiles.

With the 22cm result, I then extended the range to 13,000km to get
a figure for missiles that are in more common Traveller use.

There is a slight error in your calculation.

r^2/c^2 is in units of second^2, so d is in units of (G second^2) or
decameters (not km), so your evasion distance is only 0.13cm.

That\'s part of my point... I\'m not convinced that you can be sure "any old
computer" is going to be compatible.  

When it comes to "money on a chip" you have the problem of personal
exchange... I can\'t loan you five Cr unless we have a computer capable of
handling the transaction, which isn\'t exactly convenient.  I don\'t see paper
money fading out.  (And neither did the authors of Traveller.)  Paper money
is too convenient, especially if you want to make "private" transactions
that don\'t get recorded on somebody\'s computer.

  Per HG2 the pilot can operate one "fixed" offensive weapon _and_ one
sandcaster. The rationale for the latter clause is unclear; if it\'s not
just because sandcaster operations are simple and highly automated then
the same should apply to a missile launcher ("Computer, target: Beta. 
Launch!"). Although small-craft pilots may be very highly trained in the
OTU there must be some point where they get overloaded [unless they install
black boxes designed per B:8 - which is just _wrong_ :> ].

  The question does matter becuase it affects a lot of very small PC ships,
especially things like Scout/Couriers with only a single trained operator.
It might not be unreasonable to rule that such a small starship can still
have the pilot run an offensive battery and/or sandcaster if navy trained,
and perhaps add a missile battery at an additional -1 (under CT; later rules
might allow a dedicated MFD or such to bypass this).

  Given that batteries are laid by sensor reports (Star Wars and Buck Rogers
to the contrary) it might not be very unreasonable to have a gunner on a Far
Trader run both turrets as separate batteries (or against separate targets),
with only a -1* to represent work overload.

 * still an inefficient use of the installation, but better than nothing if
only one qualified gunner is a board.

Unfortunately, it\'s a painfully simple algorithm that only yields
one result per set of input, and then the same one over and over
again.

I tried it and got "Cooma Sccor".  Since my mothers maiden name is
"Schuster" and my (current) hometown is "Corvallis", this is exactly
what I\'d expect from a formula that goes:

First Name = 1st 3 letters of (real) last name + 1st 2 letters of
             (real) first name.
Last Name  = 1st 2 letters of mother\'s maiden name + 1st 3 letters
             of hometown.

and that\'s all it does.  Try varying the input and see for yourself.

Now, if you want a *serious* random name generator, download "namegen.tar"
from Joe Heck\'s Missouri archive at:

    http://www.mu.org/~joe/traveller/archive/software/

unarchive the source code, compile it and follow instructions.  It\'ll
spit out yards of random names.  BTW, please note the author. :^)

I got my written permission from Gurps yesterday. My thanks 
to Gene Seabolt.
 
I will get the page set up as he indicated today and get a very 
map up. Complete map, just nowhere near all the trade routes yet.

I always tended to run the Psi skills similar to the way they were
presented in May\'s Pliocene Epoch and Galactic Mileu series.  Add D-Jump
for teleport and you have a fairly hefty stable of powers.

Now, starship hulls are made of hard, metallic (or artificial) surfaces,
and are covered with things that make them nonstealthy - turrets,
sensors, commo receivers etc. Is it possible that the reason missiles
work is that, because they don\'t need to survive micrometeor impacts et
al, they are far, far stealthier than a `starship\' of equivalent size?

As I see it, the best detection system for missiles is going to be IR -
after all, you can make the body absorbent in the radio frequency,
visible light and UV parts of the spectrum since you have no constraints
on armouring it. 

Although the EMS Passive array does contain a passive IR sensor, there
are two snags to using it for point-defence:

1. Does it have the required resolution for targeting very small
targets?

2. It\'s easy to `white out\' this sensor.

This gives your 6G6 missile a good chance of surviving to impact. It
doesn\'t break canon (CT, MT) anywhere as far as I can see.

I can\'t give any figures but ISTR that the time for targeting solutions etc
was covered during the other version of this debate, the Great Fighter
Flame War about two (three?) years ago. One of the Bruce\'s (IIRC) posted a
lot of figures about target aquisition and I think (not subscribing then )
that the GDW-beta / Trav Tech list covered the same topic in a lot of math.
Being that a PDL is powered off the same fusion plant that a normal laser
is, and ROFs are covered in Striker, MT, FFS1 and FFS2 I think that gives
you your recharge time.

However, this was all on my old Mac, and I haven\'t got the digests anymore
:-/ Nearly all the tech Great old ones were active in that debate (Dave G,
Leonard...).

Hope that this helps,

Dom

Too bad I wasn\'t there, I would have gone for that too.  One of the
things stopping me from trying Linux is not knowing a bloody thing about
setting it up or compiling kernals.  (plus the fact all my software is
Windoze.)

They mean the programmer was not as neat as he should be If I:

File A.c contains:
int joe(blah) {blah, blah;}

and file B.c contains
    x = joe(blah);

when I compile B.c I\'ll get a "joe undefined, assuming extern returning int"
unless I put a prototype of joe at the top of B.c (or in an include file).

The rest are similarly not \'pretty\' programming, but the program works. (or
at least it compiles. You didn\'t say if it worked or not :> )

I think the point is that you radiate it only in one direction.  As
long as you know one direction where the enemy isn\'t, you are OK.

In my TU I use fighters for scouting a great deal.  For combat I use a
modification of Battle Rider to allow the players to actually fight out the
situations.  Using a fighter screen moving ahead of your task force on
active to light up the enemy and transfer their location to the Task Force
allows it to carry out an undetected passive attack.  While, once the
missiles get within detection range or the beam weapons hit they will be
able to figure out where you are, you may be able to do substantial damage
in that first attack.

Julian May wrote "The Many Colored Land" in the mid 80\'s, and followed it
with "The Golden Torc", "The NonBorn King", and then "The Adversary".
Later, she wrote two books about man\'s first encounter with aliens and the
families that were pivotal to the meeting.  She wrapped the series up with
"Jack The Bodiless," "Diamond Mask," and "Magnificat" (?).

The stories start in the near future, late 2000\'s or early 2100\'s.  A time
gate is developed that goes back in time, but it only goes back a precise
amount, so if you go back today, and I go back tomorrow, you will have been
there for a day.  It goes back 6,000,000 years.

We thought there was no one on earth at that time...we were wrong.

Anyway, to make a long story short, the books deal with psionic powers as
if they were an everyday occurance, which they were.

D-Jump refers to the term Dimensional Jump.  The aliens had a Ship, and the
Ship was alive and traveled using a natural psi ability.  Marc Remillard,
possibly the most power operant in human history, created a \'program\' that
would allow him to do this.

He and his associates, less than two or three dozen, all but shattered
planets with their powers, then the warships cleaned up the remains.

I highly suggest the entire series, reading them in the order listed above.
 The first four deal with the group that goes back in time, and really sets
the stage for the series.  The next two books are good background for the
last three which detail the Meta Rebellion.

It is sci-fi, but the science fiction is only there to get the characters
into the situation, it could actually be a retelling of a lot of Celtic
mythology.

Enjoy!

Oh, there is another book, very rare, that is helpful.  It is "A Pliocene
Companion", and is a cyclopedia on words, people, places, and pronunciation
for the series.

The thumbnails were so hard to see anything off of that I just made a
table of names instead. How does that look?

There is a link there to go to a complete image. I will see if I can

She did? The Federal Reserve was already looking into investing

Did you get this from the Missouri archive?

If so, did you notice that it was stored as a .tar file? (hint #1)

If so, when you extracted all the files (you *did* extract *all*
the files didn\'t you?), did you notice that they included a
Makefile and a Man page? (hint #2)

If so, you *did* read the Man page, didn\'t you?

You *did* first attempt to build the app. using "make" before going
to Visual Studio, didn\'t you?

You *did* follow the Man page instructions when attempting to run
the app., didn\'t you?

What am I missing? :^/

make on a Dec Alpha running digital Unix 4.04 yields :

Make: Makefile: Must be a separator on line 4.  Stop.

but \'cc namegen.c -o namegen\' works perfectly fine for me ;-)

I did none of the above.  I haven\'t a clue about this sort of stuff, ALL
my programming experience is in ancient BASIC.  I assumed the files that
unzipped with namgen.c were just obscure (to me) required files for
compiling and running.  That\'s why I didn\'t click on the rest of them. 
As you can see, I did manage to figure it out.  :)

I don\'t think that is possible with a missile. The exhaust is going to be hot or 
alternativly the missile is going to be hot. If the exhaust is hot, everybody in
the vicinity is going to pick it up. No chance of radiating its heat in only one
direction. If the missile is hot it becomes a matter of surface area devoted to
radiators. I don\'t know if there is enough area to radiate all heat away from
the target? But that should be easy to check using the FF&S2 rules. But as far
as I know there is no rockets that spew out cold exhaust so I consider the hot
exhaust to be the main problem, and this problem is unsolvable

At some point during the early days of Vilani/Terran contact, some
Vilani _must_ have heard the Herman\'s Hermits song, "I\'m Henry the VIII
I Am."  As I see it, the Vilani would be wondering:

1.  How did these Terrans know about Great-Uncle Eneri and Great-Aunt
Iikush?

2.  How was it that these Terrans could pronounce Great-Uncle Eneri\'s
name correctly, but couldn\'t spell it correctly.

The ObTrav for this: J-man is using his Tech level 8 Computer-1 skill.
The rest of us have progressed to Tech-9 (at least as far as LBB 6 is
concerned). Every attempt to use a program downloaded from the
internet requires a roll vs IQ to get it working in a reasonable amount
of time (say 10 minutes) w/o help. He happens to roll quite well on his
look for help roll (being familiar with the terrain (streetwise on the
internet?)), gets some extra help, rolls vs IQ again, and in 30 minutes,
has a working program. 

If he had been realigning his Target program, after picking it up on a
world one tech level higher than where he learned computer-1, and lost
3 turns in a battle with a hypothetical pirate...

Actually you are giving me more credit than I am due.  :)  Mainly my
problems stemmed from unfamiliarity with the subject matter.  Plus the
fact I never read manuals.

As for targeting programs, I wouldn\'t have left dry-dock until I was
familiar with the software in question, its being so life-n-death
important.

Paper money or polymers?  Folding money I suppose, similar to Australia\'s
"plastic money" (polymer bank notes), a different process to the "shaved
block" the Imperium uses.  Anyway, I imagine the Credit "note" is "barcoded"
(or equivalent) so the cash can be traced from withdrawal point to the next
deposit point?  I understand they use a similar system (bar coded paper
money) in the current Belgium or someplace there abouts (I saw it years ago
on a "Big Brother is Watching" type doco... just not sure of which European
country it is/was).

I\'m modifying Metator to handle the GURPS variant. So yes, it will be

As to being available on a PC...  Well, if someone donates me a PC, I\'ll

not anytime soon, especially if the neo-cons get back in power.

But the pace of technical development in the Imperium _is_ a lot slower
than the pace of development right now. Business means making money. If
customers won\'t buy because they don\'t trust your system, then you lose
money.

Remember that the Vilani plan for the long haul, and have no problems with
looking farther ahead than next quarter\'s profits.

Remember that the stock markets aren\'t instantaneous either, so that the
swift large-scale flows of capital we see today won\'t work in the Imperium.
Look at the financial system back before the telegraph to get a better idea
of the pace you could expect...

You\'re talking incremental improvements, in a system with an existing
distribution network and instantaneous communications.

Imagine trying to get the same changes through if communications between
Detroit and the dealerships took months. Look at how long it took propane
to get accepted, for example. Look at how long it took Japanese cars to
catch on in North America. Remember when owning a German car meant having a
German mechanic?

When my grandfather was a boy, he drove a horse & buggy. I don\'t think he
really noticed the diferences between my cars, other than the colours --
the car itself was a different enough technology. The same with my
computers: the computer itself was the big change, everything else was
incremental.

Traveller Cannon in the past has held that Fighters such as the Rampart and

mods as the pilot has to aline the entire fighter with the target. I would
agree with this.

It isn\'t clear at all the a missile with reationless thrusters is
going to have exhuast.  It also isn\'t clear if the exhaust can\'t
be cooled and the heat radiate seeratately.  It might be an issue
to explore, but I don\'t see it as a basis for a firm statement about
missile detectability.

The amount radiated depends on surface area and also on temperature.
This also assumes passive blackbody radiation, one has to speculate
how one might be able to more actively radiate waste heat at
higher TL\'s.

In GT at higher TL, reactionless thruster don\'t have exhaust.
This is also true in many versions of CT/MT.

I hate to be so paranoid, but Mother\'s maiden name and place of birth are
common authenticators for on line-accounts. (Forget a password, and many
systems will ask for one or both as ID.)  Any chance this is a clever
method for gathering such info?

Read some sci-fi books for new ideas.  You can also glean some ideas

I worked up Hammer\'s Slammers-style powerguns once, as well as spetsdods, 
plasma blades, and gyrojet pistols.  Gonna have to see if I can dig them all 
up again, or rebuild them...

Gil Hamilton.  They\'re by Larry Niven, a good deal later than the 50s (The
first was 1969, the others all in the 70s).  Gil is a member of the
Amalgamated Regional Militia, the UN police force, so the story collection
was inevitably _The Long ARM of Gil Hamilton_

Gil had lost his arm in an accident. The psychic arm developed to
compensate. (He had since received a transplanted replacement arm, but
managed to keep the imaginary one too.) The imaginary arm was much weaker
than a real one.  He could smoke with it, for example, but he holds the cig
in his imaginary "fist", not just two fingers.  

Highly recommended.

Obviously there was some prior contact. I would assume that the Hivers
have also paid us a visit at some point, since the moves in "The Macarena"
translate into Hiver as a rather ribald (by Hiver standards) joke. (Though
what the Hivers would consider "ribald" is probably not comprehensible

It\'s not so much a rule thing as a concept/reality thing (Trav is,
after all, supposed to be trying to model some reasonable extrapolation
of reality.) It turns out that even modern optical tracking technology can
easily target and follow a small thing through tens of G\'s of evasion at
thousands of km; evasion doesn\'t really make you harder to hit with a
laser until the range gets long compared to the speed of light. Since lasers
are light, anything your optical tracking system can follow your laser
can hit.

Well, during the SDI debate in the 1980s, the Union of Concerned
Scientists suggested that the Soviets might put a shine on their ICBMs,
thus making them resistant to SDI laser weapons.  However, as Dr. Robert
Jastrow pointed out, "no shine is perfect; some laser energy is bound to
get through, and will heat the surface.  The heating tends to dull the
shine, so more heat gets through, and dulls the shine more...."  [from
his essay "The War Against \'Star Wars\'", 1984, republished in Jerry
Pournelle\'s anthology _Warrior:  There Will Be War Volume V_]

I haven\'t seen the specs for the lasers proposed in the original SDI,
but I would imagine that, at TL-8, they would be less effective than PD
lasers in Traveller.

There are two categories of missiles that vaguely reproduce the
characteristics
of old-fashioned missiles. The first are fragmentation missiles. Several
thousand km out from their target - far enough to have some chance of
escaping laser fire - they burst into a cloud of metal fragments/BBs/whatever.
Since it will still take many seconds for them to reach the target, the cloud
has to expand a lot - to a cloud a kilometer or more across - before impating.
So only a few BBs will hit the target -  but each has lots of kinetic energy.
With tweaking, you can get damage levels similar to "classic" conventional
missiles. The math doesn\'t *quite* work but it\'s within handwaving distance.

The other alternative are chemical detonation lasers - chemical explosive
versions of the nuclear ones. Wimpy damage but acceptable range.

Thanks, Bruce.  I\'ll be the first to admit, however, that it\'s a hack

actually got to the second part. :^)

I don\'t remember /opt as being part of SCO, but it\'s been a few years since 
I\'ve had to deal with them.  But I *do* know it wasn\'t part of Slackware or

For the OTU, I agree with you Bruce.  It\'s the nature of the
Imperium.  The leaders of the 3I want a *stable* environment for
interstellar trade, more than most anything else. That produces a
drive for standard "lowest common denominators" in a number of
areas, look at the Imperial Calendar Compliance Commission for
example.  

You might very well have systems like we see in communications
protocols, where an advanced newer technology has several earlier
more standard technologies included.  The local
OS/hardware/protocol/etc might run faster, be smaller, whatever, but
when interfacing with systems that don\'t match the local standard
the system "falls back" on the slower/larger/less efficient, but
universally compatible IDP tech.  You can innovate, but if you want
wide acceptance your innovations must include the standard "fall
back" standards.

Example:  Ling Standard ship sensors built at the Sylean Shipyards
are controlled by a set of boards running LS-1134/1107 containing
innovations that aren\'t yet accepted by Ling as Corporate Standards.
The LS-1134/1107 boards also contain everything that allows them to
work like a LS-1134/1087 (the Ling Systems corporate standard that
*all* LS-1134 boards come with) and with everything needed to make
them work like the S1A4\\0098 (the IDP standard that all *Imperially*
licensed ship sensor controllers come with).  

If you need to replace an LS-1134 board in the field, you\'ll try to
get a LS-1134/1107 board replacement, but *any* LS-1134 board will
work...at a lower function.  If you can\'t get a Ling System board,
any IDP sensor controller that conforms to S1A4\\0098 will work, but
at an even lower level of function.  Your Engineer might even be
able to cobble something up from bits and pieces that worked, but it
would be replaced as quickly as you could with a standard board.

How does that model look?

  For planets you want big enough lumps that a laser hit won\'t break them up;
for stations a BB warhead is more efficient. The added velocity of the SFF\'s
detonation is trivial (2 km/s? - that\'s around 0.2 G for one space combat 
turn under most Traveller rules).

The beam of a ship is a line draw through its middle, from port to

Remember, this a handwave...
I just assume that it\'s easier to hit a target with a max delta-V of 6G,
that is MUCH larger, in every dimension, and that is arguably more
vulnerable to the laser in the first place.  Also, anti-ship lasers (as
opposed to PDL) are larger and presumably have a lower ROF.  Unless my
assumptions are totally incorrect (not unlikely) a high-pulse PDL will be
chemically pumped and therefor will vibrate like mad.  True, you might not
be able to see it with a naked eye, but at 2,000 km against a 10cm target,
well... A larger weaopn with lower ROF can presumably be dampened more
effectively.

Oh, agreed, "sensor drones" are sadly lacking in the OTU, 2300 shows up some
good tactics with these.  As for 1000 km, I expect that against very small
targets, the "footprint" of the laser will be too large to be deadly, mainly
because of vibration-induced spreading, but also at that range, active
jamming would make a target solution difficult. Now, at 100km, not much of a
problem, unless there are a *LOT* of missiles.

The problem with this is that the LADAR then needs to re-aquire each
individual target.  At this point, the PDL can only engage as fast as it can
aquire.  Since, presumably you will wish to ensure target nuetralization
before switching targets, this might be a really big governor on target
servicing speed.

I was using someone else\'s (incorrect) numbers.  In actuality, a missile
pulling 50Gs would be able to displace 245m/sec from predicted flight path.
This is 14.7m, vastly more than the highest ROF laser can cover (That\'s over
678 M^2)  Now, in practice, a missile won\'t be able to manuever exactly
perpendicular to the direction of thrust, but even given 10% thrust to the
perpendicular, this should be enough to restrict useful PDL to point-blank
range.

No, those 20 shots need to arrive AT THE SAME TIME.  By the time the first
one arrives, the missile has moved (see above) 14.7m from the flight path
(or less...).  If this shot misses, with a cycle time of 2.5 sec, the
missile needs an entirely new firing solution, which is now only 975km away
(although after only 204 seconds of acceleration, my 50G missile will be
moving at 100km/s).  Repeat process until the missile reaches a point where
the PDL can\'t miss- this depends on missile diameter, PDL ROF, terminal
target requirements, etc.  Once you figure out how small this distance is,
compare with PDLs bearing and missile velocity to determine the maximum
number of missles needed (barring duds) to kill any ship.

Agreed  I guess you could just dispense with the decoys, and have the
missile turn into a cloud of flechettes at 100 km or so- something will hit
if the cloud is big enough.

Thinking about it, why even bother with a warhead?  The only reason that I
suggested a SFF was that it allows you not have to point the missile
directly at the ship.  BTW, a well-designed SFF can *EASILY* achieve a
velocity of more than 10km/s.  Also, very, very cheap (some C-4 analog and a
piece of uranium oxide would be my choice) compared to det-lasers or nukes.
The fragment will also be virtually impossible to stop- it\'s already pretty
much a molten slug.

Check out the spreadsheets for ships I\'ve designed (the URL is in my
sig).  You\'ll see that virtually all of my ships have light laser
turrets (61MJ lasers), which can fire for point defense at a ROF of 800
(per turret; I usually group them in batteries of four) on supplementary
battery power.  I frankly can\'t see any use for ship-mounted chemical
lasers, since a reasonable rate of fire would require more space for the
chemical cartridge magazine than would be saved with the smaller power
plant.

If you have a missile design that can pull 50Gs for a useful period of
time, please post it.  A "standard" det-laser missile at TL-15, using
Advanced Nuclear Drive (AND), has 12 G-hours of fuel, and can maneuver
at 6Gs.  (BTW, standard spacecraft missiles in Traveller displace 7 m^3,
and mass 7 metric tons.)  While you might be able to increase to some
extent the power of the burn (at the cost of duration), I doubt that you
can coax 50Gs out of a missile for any meaningful period of time.  Also,
the most efficient drive you can put on a TL-15 standard missile body is
AND, which produces a _very_ nice signature.  (You can\'t make thruster
plates small enough to fit, and HEPlaR requires a fusion plant, which
also won\'t fit.)

  FWIW, under HG (and at 35 trips/year) a similar ship would require revenue
of Cr 670 per Dt capacity just to cover the mortgage. If only a J-1 model
then the value becomes Cr 357 Dt/trip. As the power plant efficiency increase
at TL D is especially important to J2+ ships those numbers change to Cr 520 &
Cr 305, respectively.

Actually, mine are based on MT, which would certainly explain the
discrepence.  In MT, a standar missile (HE) masses just 50kg, and has a
volume of 100litres- I find it amazingly easy to produce a 10cm diameter
missile from specs like these.  For the "good" missile, a Fusion rocket with
a strap-on sensor/guidance packeage costs about Mcr .5, masses 4.5 tons, and
carries a whole 5litres of fuel (1 hour\'s worth)  Acceleration: about 43G.
I assume that by dispensing with safety back-ups, radiation shielding, etc.,
you could easily reduce the weight to around 2 tons.

As for lasers being chemically-pumped, I mean the method of stimulating
photons, i.e., putting a lot of energy (from batteries, a PP, combustion,
etc,)  into a gas medium, then focussing the resulting narrow-bandwidth
emission.  If FF&S2 postulates a different method of lasing, then this
wouldn\'t hold, but at least against visual-light lasers it should.   As for
the signature, so what.  You will still need to use an active sensor for a
targetting solution most likely.\'

One last thing.  Canon missiles strike the turn they are fired, from any
range.  This, IMHO, indicates a massive delta-v with little endurance
(otherwise, they keep trying until they hit...).

I\'ll share one of my referee\'s secret tips with you:  I collect names
from the New York Times and other international reporting.  I put them
into files by personal name and family name and maybe a few other
categories, and then match them up euphonically (or cacophonically)
whenever I need a Solomani name.  I like the New York Times because it
gives lots of names of people who are not well known.

  Say I was just reading my Battle Lances rules (still have never played
it) but under the ROF rules, it says that you can increase the rate of fire
by pumping more power into it, but it also states that it still only fires
at one target, it just decreases the Diff mod. That is of course if I am
reading it wrong or missing something.
  So if say I shot 6 missiles at your ship, in order for you to take out
all 6 you would have to have 6 of these laser bays.

  I am going to use FF&S steel tomorrow and try and make a killer missile
that would have at least a slim chance of hitting a ship.

  BTW I have breezed through the FF&S book and can\'t find any reference to
PDL\'s? Could someone please give me the page number for the rules so I can
read how to put one on a ship and how they work.

I think he\'s one of Larry Niven\'s characters, but I can\'t remember the
titles of the stories.  

My favorite Niven psionics thing is in A Gift From Earth.  The
protagonist has the power to disappear and be completely forgotten by
others.  At first, he doesn\'t know that it\'s a power.  He\'ll just be
talking to a pretty girl at a party and get a little nervous and aroused
and then she\'ll blink and get up and walk away.  He doesn\'t realize that
he has stopped existing for her.  Later he gets control of it and saves
the world.

The novel has a lot of other stuff to recommend it, too, about the
society and geographical background.

The charater is Gill Hampton from "The long ARM of Gill Hampton" and a
number of other short stores by Niven.

Strongly suggest all read them (heck all of Niven\'s "Known Space").Good
reads and good plot hooks for any Traveller game. I also beleave the most
traveller-ish books (any milieu).

I personally like to using "body banks" on TTL 7-9 worlds with high law
levels and high pops.

Really makes the PC behave.

Someone posted the idea of mirroring a missile\'s surface so that Point
Defense Lasers get reflected. How about insteaed of having the surface
polished, using a dilectric mirror (works like the optical cavity that tunes
the laser in the first place but detunes it instead)? These beasts have far
higher efficiencies than traditional "reflect everything" mirrors.

It wouldn\'t be any good against wavelengths other than the one it\'s designed
to screen against and how it\'d cope with the thermal stress of space is
someone else\'s problem!

Then, how do you build at the atomic level to reflect X-ray lasers?

Anyway, just a thought....

That was Gil Hamilton, aka \'Gil the ARM\', one-time Belter, currently working 
for the UN Algamated Regional Militias, aka \'the ARM\', the UN\'s main police 
force.  I have a character in a PBEM named Gil Hamilton who\'s a direct ripoff 
of Niven\'s take on Belters.  <grin>  Disturbing fellow...

\'Plateau eyes\'.  A real cute psionic power, especially when he figures out

It also has some nifty commentary on the dangers of using the organ banks for

	I have build self-forgin projectile (SEFOP) devices in real
	life, and I don\'t consider these as suitable alternative to
	Traveller det-laser warheads. Basically the maximum velocity
	of SEFOP is less than the velocity of explosive impact wave
	(the narrow reaction wavefront in which explosive material
	turns from solid to gas). In practise the SEFOP velocity is
	~6-8 km/s, which is too slow for the great ranges in Traveller
	space combat.

	Various fragmenting warheads may have their uses in kinetic
	kill missiles (such as AHEAD, SPEW and TDC), but even then
	the warhead must deplay at ~15.000 km range to avoid being
	destroyed by point-defense system.

>Then, how do you build at the atomic level to reflect X-ray lasers?

We can do it now - you use a crystal. Normally, the X-rays pass between
the atoms, but if the angle between the crystal surface and the X-rays
is very shallow, the X-rays cannot pass between the gaps, and reflect.

This tends to make things very bulky.

It has been theorised that you could use superdense materials, although
that would suggest X-ray lasers were available at TL12.

Alternatively, it might be an early use for coherent superdense materials.
These can be used to build starships at TL14 but you could assume that
you can make X-ray laser mirrors from coherent superdense at TL13.
(Much as you could use glass to make lenses and mirrors centuries before
you could make bullet proof glass).

Hmmm, I quite like this idea. IMTU, the Postmark Design Bureau was intended
to be an early experimenter with both X-ray lasers and coherent superdense
materials, but I didn\'t feel happy about having them use TL14 materials
when their Imperium is only mid TL12. This would give the PDB a reason to
be involved in materials research.

The reason I wanted CSD, is the cute bridge sceen during a battle when
the power feeds to the material they made the ship out of short out and
someone gets to say "structural integrity field is off line, captain!"

:-)

Using the CSD mirror idea, if the power feed to the mirror fails,
you have 650Mj that has just failed to be reflected towards the target.
Still, I\'m sure such a thing would never happen on a prototype
TL13 weapon, using TL14 materials, built at TL12...

I bet they didn\'t use realistic ranges (hint: if you can *see* your

"Abeam" is straight out to one side. 

Assume a "standard" ship shaped sort of like a bullet or a *big*
dirigible. If you have turrets at the "middle" (ie "thickest") part,
then they can cover targets directly ahead *or* behind. in fact their
arc of fire would be slightly *more* than a hemisphere, because their
"elevated" positions let them fire "past" the nose and tail. 

The "masked" area would be on the far side of the ship. Now start the
ship *rolling* slowly. That means that they can hit a point well off to
one side for something *more* than half a rotation. And points ahead or
behind for *all* of a rotation. 

And the ship\'s yaw rate (or pitch rate!) is likely fairly fast. You
have to remember that in space, the ship pivots about its center of
*mass*, not it\'s geometrical center. So even if 90% of the ship\'s mass
was in the tail, it can still turn quickly, simply because the sterring
jet at the nose has a much *longer* moment arm, and less mass to move.

Even so, I suspect that the preferred setup is to have the center of
mass better located than that so as to improve handling
characteristics. This will be even *more* true for ships intended to
operate even *some* of the time inside an atmosphere.

But "high" pitch and yaw rates are *necessary*. They are needed for you
to be able to make course changes. It\'s *much* simpler to turn the ship
than to gimbal the main drive unit. :-)
