What you point out to players is that it\'s only useful in zero grav. Otherwise
it\'s an expensive football. For most environments in traveller, it would need
fuel for propulsion and anti-gravity, as well as any energy based weapons. And
even in zero gravity it would need some kind of compensator to allow it to aim
and fire (most weapons) and retain stability.

By the way this one uses fans for propulsion, so it basically requires zero/low
grav with an atmosphere. Another write-up can be found here:

Over in the Uk the main reason these are available (occasionally and usually

This stuff is very cool. I especially like the pictures from the perspective
of a gas giant moon. (Jesse has a bunch of pictures like that too.) Since we

I would hope that in 3000 years that designers would develop the
intelligence to install jointer bulkheads as fair size removable panels that
can easily be moved out of the way to allow access beneath.

In an off topic statement: Isn\'t it a little foolish that we build our
houses with gypsum panels taped and mudded together so as to make the
mechanicals all inaccessible once installed. The technology certainly exists
to have walls made of removable panels that would allow easy access to
power, phone, computer and piping lines without resort to a drywaller.  Of
course most places, in the U.S. at least, actively prevent you from using
any other kind of wall construction. If I was a suspicious person I\'d think
that they were holding back homebuilding innovation on purpose.

Given the staggeringly huge number of web sites out there, for Unisys to

mean that the courts would be filled with nothing but copyright infringement
suits for the GIF format for the next several hundred years. I doubt this

Andy,

I think (IIRC), Imperiallines #1 had a workround on this. I take it your
ships all have
energy weaponry? If so, is it really necessary to have them capable of
firing during
the whole of the duration of fuel consumption? Wouldn\'t be a lot of ship
left after 30
days continuous combat, would there? Simply create a second power plant with
a
much smaller duration, say 10%.

Another trick is to cut the fuel requirements for maneuver whilst in jump.
(Dunno if
this one has been mentioned in print before) Also, no grav plates / extended
life
support in fuel tankage, or other dead areas of the ship.

The only other thing I can think of is to ensure you are using the Scale
Efficiency
tables for Power Plants.


Hope this helps, but I don\'t know exactly how much is official.

Gee whiz, guys!  Grab a few of those little clear plastic hosery
eggs.  Pop in the polyhedrons of your choice. Shake and bake!

They are small enough to hold in your hand while you are out hiking
and slip in your pocket when you need both hands, and they cost only
a few seconds of time.

The best star catalogs (like the Hipparcos catalog) is generally good
to ~few milliarcseconds on most stars; a handful of more fundamental
reference stars, and quasars whose positions are measured with
radioastronomy, might have positions better than a milliarcsecond.

This turns out to be a bad way to navigate around our solar system,
because the parallax on most of these stars is small enough that even
a milliarcsecond error in knowing the stars position translates to a huge
uncertainty in your baseline (eg your position). Navigating with multiple
sightings on in-system asteroids (eg what DS1 did) is probably better;
the asteroid positions are poor, but the parallax is huge.

(email me privately if you\'d like references to on-line versions of the
positional catalogs.)

  Well, GW has an RPG or two if it wants, and their efforts in the US haven\'t
been money-losers; they\'ve been too slavish over the years to following the
UK model (install their own stores _everywhere_), but they seem to do fairly
well getting their product out when they want to.

About O2...

I\'ve wondered if, given that the energy was available (fusion), why
you couldn\'t crack the CO2 and recover *all* the oxygen.  If that\'s
true, then if you\'ve got enough air for everyone for the few hours
it takes to break the CO2 back down, you have enough air for
everyone for as long as you can keep recyling it.  Right?

<sigh>

I wouldn\'t point anything out to *those* players.  I would run
them through a very short game where they all died...

Player 2: "You can\'t just say we are dead!"

GM:  "Sure I can, You\'re all dead and none of your efforts do more
than make your death more painful."

Hell, the star in the system they are in would go nova in a
heartbeat if any players acted like that.  If I had players that
acted like that I\'d go looking for some other people to play with.

Hehe, I was running around in a Traveller game once, and on a silly day of
gaming, told the GM I was doing a "tap dance" after something important came
up and he asked me what was I going to do.

His reply as I remember was something like :

You see a thousand battledressed lizard troops with FGMP-14\'s come running
up over the hill towards you.  Are you SURE you want to do a tap dance?????

Jeff,
     Your phrasing about getting into a standards committee mode sounds
intimidating.  While I feel that a usefull set of data file formats can
be made that would be of reasonable size and flexability I am not sure
that I want to start with a task of that large a scope.  My first
inquiry was to find out about the current state of affairs regarding
this.  Now that you hav pointed out some that already exist I will try
to take advantage of them.
     As for data formats for characters, ships, etc. I would certainly
like to get your input on how best to approach these.  I would like to
focus on making them workable for Classic Traveller first with the
ability to adapt to other systems.  I would especially need help with
Gurps Traveller issues.
     To give you an example of what I had been thinking of for character
data, I had thought to provide five data types. The data would be in an
ascii file that could be appended as needed.  The data types would be
Identity, Statistic, Dividend, Skill and Posession. Parameterized values
would be used to keep track of such things as when you last picked up
your pension check but the damage a weapon in your possesion could do
would not as that may fluctuate with the version of the game being
used.  Please let me know what your ideas are.

I\'m not sure that I\'d really consider it really frightening. If TSR\'s D&D
products were the only ones out there, that might be a little bit
frightening. If it gets people into the hobby and helps to create a market
for other RPGs, I\'m not really going to complain or worry about it. In fact,
since the hobby wouldn\'t have lasted as long as it did without the game, I
can only be glad that it\'s there.

Yes, but there\'s a big difference between getting a product out if they want
to and becoming an industry leader able to fill the vacuum that would be
created if TSR were to crash and burn (which is what you seemed to be
worried about). There\'s only one store in Philly that\'s willing to sell GW
products, and they don\'t really carry a wide selection. I can think of five
stores in the same general geographic area that carry TSR and White Wolf,
two that carry Palladium and two that carry GURPS.

First place I see it mentioned is in Heinlein\'s outstanding book, The Moon

There\'s a difference between oxygen uptake (ventilation) and
utilisation.
With air (0.21 atm partial pressure oxygen), resting (conscious, sitting
quietly) adult oxygen uptake is approximately 15mL/kg/min, while
utilisation is one quarter this.
	Multiply the value X 3 for neonates, X 2 for children under about 5
years.
	You could slow metabolic rate by 20% with simple sedatives. It would be
safer to give everyone fast drug if it is safe to do so in YTU without
monitoring ; or if circumstances are sufficiently dire, low berth.

	This is the 3rd or 4th time you have recommended suing someone in as
many days. And though lawsuits are a legal and accepted manner of
handling disputes, the fact that there are so many of them is one of the
things wrong with this county. There has to be a better method of
conflict resolution than physical violence or legal violence.

400. So how do these issues get resolved.

They do things the way the medievals did - have lots of suits and no 
lawyers. Apparently the middle ages were a very litigious time, with 
villagers going to the bailiff for judgements on all sorts of trivial 
matters (by our standards, anyway). This extended all the way up 
the feudal system. That\'s why nobles held court - so they could hear 
the complaints of their subjects and judge those of the commoners 
(the knights and up got judged by their peers, not their lords).

I see the 3I as having this srot of system in many places, with the 
local imperial noble holding court. OTOH there\'ll be places where the 
local 3I rep only deals with some matter, and passes many back to 
the local system, like the Romans often did. However on most worlds 
the Imps only deal with Imperial matters (slavery, interstellar 
smuggling, piracy, etc) and the locals do things however they like. 
For example I don\'t think you\'d get US style legal advocates in most 
high law theocracies.

It doesn\'t make much difference, as Pop II stars are almost exclusively
found in the galactic core and in the globular clusters surrounding the
galaxy, and very rarely found in the galactic "disk". 

Pop II stars would only be of use for refueling, as they are first
generation stars with maybe a sprinkling of second generation. That
means too things. First, the are most around 15 billion years old.
Secondly they are *exclusively* hydrogen and helium. No heavier
elements at all.

Thus anything with even Sol\'s mass will have gone thru the redgiant
stage and wound up as a white dwarf. And any planets will be gas giants.

Accurate enough to allow all the planetary missions so far. As far as I
know, that sort of star tracker setup *is* how the probes navigate. 

But I think they use it for *orientation*, I doubt it\'s acuurate enough
for *positioning*.

Over on the Space:1889 list, they\'ve made arrangements with RAFM to do
runs of the Space:1889 minis. You\'d have to ask someone else for
details, but essentially they showed RAFM that there was enough
iunterest, and arranged to have one person on the list handling the
ordering. So the people send orders to him, he consolidates them, RAFM
ships the resulting mins out to hoim, and he mails everybody the ones
they ordered. 

I think he\'s on this list. :-)

Anyway, if you *really* want the old minis reproduced, you may be able
to work a similar deal. They don\'t mind "low volume" orders as long as
they are also low *hassle*.

Actually it\'s the LZW compression used in GIF files that has to be
licensed. 

This is why I encourage folks to support PNG. Like GIF it\'s a lossless
format, but it\'s been updated to allow higher resolutions *and* more
colors. And it gets better compression. 

Another interesting format to look at is RIP. It started out as a BBS
format, but the company has a plugin available so it can be used on web
pages. It\'s not pixel based. Instead it sends short strings that code
for various sorts of line (including bezier curves. It also has support
for icons which get sent to your system once and are then stored
locally (the plugin includes a library of standard icons). and it has
some sound capabilities.

No. What happened was that the *compression* algorithm used in GIF is
LZW encoding. Like a lot of other folks, CIS used it because it was
efficient, and it\'d been published. 

What nobody knew was that the company the author worked for had filed
for a *patent* on the algorithm. They got granted the patent a few
years back (1990?). At which point they started sending out notices to
everyone in sight informing them that they had to either pay royalties
or cease using the algorithm. 

CIS got some bad press over it, because folks misunderstood an attempt
they made to lessen the damage for people working with GIF files. What
they did was make arrangments for a special "group license", so that
folks writing programs that worked with GIF files could get the
required license from Unisys at a reduced rate. 

Naturally, some *idiot read this and concluded that it was all a CIS
plot to milk money out of folks. <sigh>

One thing that *did* come out of this was an agreement that GIF
*viewing* programs didn\'t need a licence, but GIF creation programs
did. Unisys also agreed to "grandfather" things so that only *new*
programs or new *versions* of old programs had to pay. 

I\'m fairly certain that Unisys can\'t do anything to you for having a
GIF made by an unlicensed program. But a lot of programs leave a sort
of "signature" intentional or otherwise in the GIFs they create. They\'s
why two GIF files can be different yet produc the *exact* same image. 

If they can show you are *using* an unlicensed program, then they can
nail you for a fair amount of money. 

In reaction to all this, a project was started to come up with a
replacement for GIF. They did a good job. It\'s called PNG (Portable
Network Graphics). Like GIF, it\'s lossless. That is, if you convert a
BMP or TIFF or other such "raw pixel" format to a PNG file, and then
convert back, the result will be pixel for pixel identical with the
original. 

Unlike GIF, PNG supports more than 256 colors. I don\'t know the limits,
but it goes to at least 16 million. I think it\'ll support larger images
(more pixels). And it usually gets better compression than GIF. 

It just need more support. Viewers and converters are out there, you
just have to look a bit.

Unisys is being a bunch of underhanded bastards. You see, they
*published* the LZW algorithm, and made no mention of the fact that
they\'d filed for a patent on it (which should never have been granted,
but that\'s another rant). 

So, everybody and his brother uses this neat algorithm. The patent
office plods along and around 5 years later they grant the patent. At
which point Unisysy gleefully starts sending letters to folks informing
them that they have to pay up or else. 

If they\'d put a "patent pending" note in the article, folks would have
had fair warning. Alas, the law doesn\'t require it, just that you file
for the patent within 12 months(?) of publication.

I recall a D&D game lo, these many years ago. The players had been
getting annoying in some manner or other and finally they hit the
limit. 

Me: Suddenly, the corridor is hip deep in a strong smelling yellowish
    liquid... 

They got the point. 

BTW, blowing up the system is overkill. I\'d go more for something like
"You were too busy arguing to notice the decompression warning. You all
died when the promenade had a massive blowout due to shoody materials
and poor maintenance."

And then, even if they insisted that their new characters be the heirs
of the old ones, I can tell them that the ship and everything else is
going to be tied up in litigation for the next 20 years or so. :-)

Put in a main powerplant to meet running demands/jump etc. Put a second
powerplant with a short duration (say 1 day) of fuel to meet the combat
demands. ISTR that this was suggested as an official idea in Imperiallines
1 (which was a GDW backed thing)...

Peter,

First of all, can I just state that my previous comments were not in any
way meant as a comment on yourself or your company.

I know that there was no issue with your response. The minimum orders arise
from a similar position at the OEM - we have to charge a certain amount to
make a profit when shipping across the pond... I assume that SJG are making
a profit on the BITS products - they keep on reordering, and though SJ like
Traveller, I don\'t think they\'re acting as a charity ;-)

Again, Peter, you were clear about the information you needed, and very
helpful. The issue I refered to in the original post refers to several of
the bigger distributers, who had expressed an interest. At present the
biggest issue I see people on this list posting about is that their FLGS
can\'t get certain books, won\'t get certain books or doesn\'t know that
products exist. If there is a lack of understanding at the retail point of
sale as to what is on the market, it results in reduced opportunities to
buy and sell. Sadly I think it is an issue that needs resolving through
distribution... I know of other companies in the UK and Europe who are
setting up their own distribution routes into North America because the
larger distributers are not conducive to getting product out.

If the companies to whom I was refering were as good as you were in
bothering to respond, I would have no real problem. But all we see from
over here is a fragmented, disorganised distribution chain. I suppose that
the UK, having two main distributers has a better clarity.

[This response reflects my personal view and does not in any way reflect
the position of BITS UK Ltd].

Cheers,

Dom

I\'ve just been looking at Freelance Traveller (linked from Jumpsite @ BITS,
on downport.com, etc) and I took a look at the review section (\'critic\'s
corner\'). Several BITS products are reviewed here, but there are a few
gaps. I\'d appreciate it if those of you who own a copy of:

101 Religions
The Khiidkar Incident
SpaceDogs

would consider writing a brief review for Jeff\'s excellent webzine. This
would serve to give people a balanced review of BITS products beyond our
own site. I can\'t offer anything for doing it (and wouldn\'t if I could
because I feel it is wrong to pay for reviews) but you would have my
thanks, and help serve the Traveller community.

If people want to review the other books for www.rpg.net too, that would be
really useful.

Thanks,

Running MegaTraveller several years back, the players kept complaining that
I wasn\'t being "realistic" enough.. that they should be able to get away
with all sorts of mayhem because of some specialized player knowledge.

Finally, I had enough.  At their next stop, they were jumped by well
organized and trained bounty hunters, who took them back to Regina in low
berths, where they stood trial for multiple murders.  The evidence was
mainly hair and skin found in the victims\' residence, along with some blood
spatters.  They were convicted, and sentenced to life terms.  When the
whining began, I handed them a book on DNA testing and told them that what
I did was tre\' realistic.

Not so fast!  Anna Kreutzman, daughter of Grateful Dead drummer Bill
Kreutzman, is a gamer and fan. She once told me that she had GM\'d her dad,
Mickey Hart, Phil Lesh and Bob Weir through Twilight\'s Peak.

For those not into the Dead, those are all band memebers.

Oh, to have been in that game...

In some gif formats you can put a in description field.  If you have a 
good gif reader, you can see what the description says.  Some 
licensed gif creation programs put a copyright notice in that gif.  
Something like, "Created with SuperDuper GIF Maker 1.1"

I am not up to speed on the different gif standards but I have seen 
this in at least one.  IIRC, it was an animated gif maker.

They\'re certainly not interested in whether or not Terry C\'s web page gif\'s
are licensed or not. First they went after Coral, and squeezed an
undisclosed amount from them.  I expect they might go after some major web
sites, like Yahoo or Excite, or some web advertisers, that are using gif\'s.
They want $5000 per gif. I\'m waiting to see if they have the kahoona\'s to go
after Microsoft (Paint can save in gif format.) Do you think Gates and
company bought a license from them?

Talk is there\'s a gif burning planned by the League for Programming Freedom
(LPF), which is closely related to the GNU project (LPF was co-founded by
GNU leader Richard Stallman).  No exact details yet.
Goto:
http://lpf.ai.mit.edu/
for details.

I recommend converting you gif\'s to another format, if you can. I\'m headed
that direction myself.

You think Heinlien\'s Luna was cool, check out Roger MacBride Allen\'s version in
\'The Farside Cannon\' or the \'Shattered Sphere\' novels.  Nifty cultural stuff
there...

Thanks for the inside look at the manufacturing / distributing end of the
process. I\'m reminded of a situation I encountered recently in a similar
vein. I run an online bookstore (sorry, computer stuff only, no game books).
One publisher recently contacted me wondering why I wasn\'t carrying his
books. He sent me a catalog and the contact info for the Canadian distributor
of his books.

Turns out the minimum ordering requirements set by the Canadian distributor
of this US publisher\'s books are such that I really can\'t afford to carry
them -- low discount compared to other suppliers, and a high minimum order
requirement, especially when you consider that they aren\'t one of the big
players in the market. And my US distributor (who carries just about
everybody)
doesn\'t carry their stuff. So, I\'m not going to be carrying this publisher\'s
books in our online store. Sad, because they have a good product, perfect for
schools and colleges... 

On the other hand, since they *aren\'t* a major player in the marketplace, the
distributor probably has to have minimums and low discounts just to get by
- -- they can\'t do it by volume like the big plaeyrs do, so I can understand
their
viewpoint.

Anyway, this all serves to illustrate that there is a lot that goes on behind
the scenes between the game publisher, the FLGS, and anyone part of the
process in between -- it isn\'t as simple as looks on the surface...

Meanwhile, if I want BITS stuff, I have two options: buy from BITS itself,
or buy from SJGames... (I have two BITS books -- great stuff!)

Hi Andrew,

Personally I can\'t see the Vargr being much more concerned than we are
about monkeys and apes. After all the situations are similar. They would
probably be more concerned that humans would tend to associate them with
their genetic ancestors than they would feel an actual connection. 

Come to think of it they were uplifted how long ago 2 - 300000 years?
They might not even realize that they are related to the canines in the
human colony. I\'m not sure that Canon has them realizing this even
though Imperial scientists have figured the connection out. Many Vargr
may not even acknowledge the connection, or even disagree with it. That
would make the "doggie" type slurs even more likely to bring forth a
negative reaction.

In Leonard\'s defense (I can\'t believe I\'m saying this ;) ) When an
individual refuses to pay you for work that you\'ve done, or purchases a
company with outstanding debts and refuses to honor them then an individual
(or company) has only a few choices. You can write off the debt (in the U.S.
at least). That means it\'s tax deductible.  You can forget about it and just
take a loss. You can get a great big gun and probably end up in jail. Or you
can take them to court and have the government you pay for help you collect
your outstanding debt.

When a great big company is exercising monopolistic practices that are
giving your competitors an unfair advantage (whatever that means). Or a
company, which sells to everyone else won\'t sell to you in such a way as to
drive you out of business, they might be engaged in illegal behavior. You
can sit quietly and let them roll over you or you can go to court. That\'s
why we have them.

The good old fashioned way. The MegaCorp drives you out of business or buys
you out for .01 on the credit. If you\'re to big for that they start a trade
war and use interdiction and mercs to destroy you. Unless of course you\'ve
given stock to an Imperial Noble, who will use influence with the government
to prevent that.  You know the usual methods existent in a corrupt society.

Perhaps not all Vargr realize their lineage, as the are hardly a "unified"
culture, but at least some do. There are canonical(?) references to a
religion based on the belief that the Ancients favored them. And that they
were the origional Terran sophonts, removed from Earth to avoid
contaminating the other Ancient projects with humans. Some even think they
are destined for galactic supremacy. Others spend their time debating the
relative qualities of Frizbees vs. Balls.

Oh, Eris, you missed the really fun part.

Player 1: "I want a Zhodani warbot!!!!"

GM: "OK." <sigh>

Player 2: (recognizing the manic grin on the GM\'s face) "OH s***t!"

GM: "You hear a strange \'pop\' of displaced air behind you. As you start to
spin around the whine of a plasma gun warming up reaches your ears. As you
turn completely around you see a squad of Zhodani commandos and two warbots
have teleported in behind you. What do you do?"

Player 1: "I draw my weapon and hose them down."

GM: "As your hand reaches the butt of your gun your muscles freeze in a
strange kind of paralysis. The muzzle of the plasma gun raises, points to your
chest and flashes. You\'re quite surprised, in the microsecond before you\'re
vaporized, to find all you felt was a mild tingle."

Player 1: "But, but, but..."

GM: "HEY! YOU\'RE the one asked for a Zhodani warbot! Don\'t blame ME! All I did
was give you what you asked for!"

Player 2: Rolls up now-useless character sheet and accompanying notes, and
starts thwacking Player 1 on the head. "<Thwack> Dammit, you went <thwack> and
did it <thwack> AGAIN! <thwack>"

Player 1: "OW!"

In my experience, they\'ve ALWAYS done it AGAIN...;-)

2 questions.

1.  What language & platform is it for?

2.  You *EVER* gonna post your move on CATN2???  We\'ve been waiting for you

Depends on what value you support for the Hubble parameter and how long
it took galaxies to form in the first place, but I\'d agree they\'re in
the 12-15 x 10^9 years bracket.

>Secondly they are *exclusively* hydrogen and helium. No heavier

If you accept a sprinking of second-generation pop II stars then you
have to also accept a possibility of rocky worlds, for the following
reasons:

a) We are looking at them several billion years ago, at which point they
are still pristine H/He stars. Right now they\'re going to be more metal-
heavy simply due to the normal processes of stellar evolution -
remember, as soon as a star starts burning He in its core (the red giant
phase) you start getting metals appearing (a metal being defined
astronomically as anything that isn\'t H/He). If you\'re looking at a Pop
II star from nearby it _will_ have a metal content.

b) A large enough Pop II star will evolve normally until it tries to
fuse iron in the core and a supernova will occur. It is in these
supernovae that the elements heavier than iron are formed.

>Thus anything with even Sol\'s mass will have gone thru the redgiant
>stage and wound up as a white dwarf. And any planets will be gas giants.

c) Just because a star has passed through the red giant stage does not
preclude it from having rocky planets. It\'s arguable whether Mars will
survive Sol going through its red giant phase. Terra will probably be
vapourised, but not necessarilly Mars. The more interesting question
might be \'is the outflow of matter during the plaentary nebula phase
sufficient to dislodge any rocky worlds?

I agree that Pop II stars with rocky planets would be uncommon, but I
don\'t think they\'ll be impossible. They would, however, probably only be
found orbiting second-generation Pop II stars in globular clusters where
matter from supernovae have been more gravitationally constrained to
remain in the \'local\' area of the cluster.

Pop II stars with Jupiter/Saturn type (predominantly H) gas giants are
probably just as common as Pop I stars with these planets, as would be
brown dwarfs and large Jupiter-type bodies, as these are negligible in
their metal content and so would form in the the stellar disks of either
type.

Now there\'s a campaign concept - mis-jump to a globular cluster and see
what\'s out there.

Uhh, that\'s also why we CALL them \'courts\'.

Basically only four conflict resoluton modes exist:

1)Violence
2)Negotiation
3)Trial
4)Arbitration

Violence generally gets you arrested unless you\'re a state. If you piss off
the Imperium even that isn\'t a protection.

If Negotiation had worked, suing someone wouldn\'t be necessary, would it?

In our society, there\'s no general structure for arbitration established, so
we\'re left with Trial, hence, lots of lawsuits.

In the 3I as in any feudal system, they go for Arbitration. That\'s a noble\'s
primary function in the 3I, since many of them are not only Imperial nobles
but rulers in their own right of their territories as well (from the long
standing 3I practice of ennobling the bastards in power when the place joined
the 3I, helping to ensure they\'re the bastards who _stay_ in power.)

Also, in general, people complaining about frivolous lawsuits are unaware that
the vast majority of them are not so frivolous, and the truly frivolus ones
are increasingly getting tossed out of court. 

Even the infamous \'lady spills coffee, gets 6 mill from McDonalds\' isn\'t as
stupid as it seems. She was served coffee so hot it burned her badly enough to
need skin grafts. The coffee she was served was near boiling temperature, far
too hot to drink, in a tip-prone cup with an ill fitting lid.

	Right. I got into an informal discussion the other day, and that\'s

vectors combined with very small angular measurements equals very
large error margin).

Right! Sorry my MT era knowledge is not what it should be and this
information came after I took a loong break form the game. I\'ve been
making an effort to get the MT era books but haven\'t had time to read
all of them. Now that you\'ve mentioned this I do recall running across
the references. 

Still, it doesn\'t invalidate my argument for the fact that "modern"
Vargr probably haven\'t any more sentimental attachment to canines than
we do for monkeys. Thinking on this again, those that do know that they
are decended from dogs may even purchase them for laboratory animals, to
expand their biological knowldge. Humm, a black market on cainine lab
subjects from Imperial space to Vargr space...

They didn\'t; the GIF format is in the public domain.  What isn\'t
in the public domain, and is causing all the problems, is the LZW
compression scheme that was incorporated into GIF to make GIF
files so compact without losing information (as contrasted with
JPEG, which is a \'lossy\' format).  Unisys owns the patent - not
copyright - on LZW, and is trying to enforce their rights under
that patent.

Funny enough, tho, is that Frack  and Felgercarb were banned in the school

BTRC has their generic system: CORPS
it is really nice, reduced dice use, uses only 1d10 per player.

Could be worse.  During Silent Death games at our FLGS, so many
miniatures were broken off their flying stands by dice that we had to
institute the "Bowling for Miniatures" house rule:  any player who hits
any miniature with a die has his/her/its ship take as damage the number
shown on the offending die (no damage reduction).

Oh, my.

I can just see the article now:

[from _Astrophysics for Dummies_, vol 1104, number 26]

"Gene Pools Linked to Stellar Novae" (author:  I. M. N. Significant)

A rash of stellar nova events in the [f-i-t-b] Sector [wherever the
campaign is set] has been linked to a startling cause:  The presence
in-system of sophonts bearing one of several unique genetic markers
[these markers are, of course, those identifying the PCs as belonging to
the players in question].  DNA fragments recovered from several
formerly-inhabited worlds affected by the previously-unexplained novae
has conclusively demonstrated that each affected world, at the time of
the various novae, was occupied by sophonts bearing one of three
extremely rare genetic markers.  Random genetic testing on worlds not
affected by nova events indicates that the odds of these markers
appearing in a random population of sophonts is, in the words of
Professor Ignatius P. Knightley (University of Alderaan), "less likely
than a card player getting 57 Royal Fizbins in a row, dealt in proper
card sequence."  Professor Knightley added, "The only way to protect
worlds in this sector from future unpredictable novae is to test all
sophonts in the sector for these genetic markers, and then exterminate
any beings that bear this \'DNA of Death.\'"

Sector Duke John Q. hault-Nameless is said to be considering ways to
implement this proposal.

<tongue-in-cheek>

There\'s a problem with this:  using hunting methods of this type will
weed out the weak and sickly lawyers, leading to a hardier stock later
on.  Far better to use random culling of the herds, perhaps by lottery.

Alternately, one can cull the top 5% of each law school class, and fail
the bottom 60%.  This would preemptively weed out the most successful
predators within the profession, while helping to ensure that the rest
of the lawyer larvae don\'t simply coast through the course of study, in
order to avoid being culled.

I would consider using both methods, thus attacking both the larval and
adult stages.

Mind you, some North American distributors are ripping off their customers.
Whoever imports Full Thrust, for example, is definately gouging.  There\'s
no way that book should be cheaper for a Canadian shop to order retail from
the UK (and pay for shipping) than to order the book from the North

That doesn\'t help when it comes to finding habitable worlds under First
In rules.  The problem isn\'t the old (i.e. Population II) stars, it\'s the very
young ones which haven\'t had time to evolve native life (extreme Population 
I).

This probably isn\'t true; current theories for the formation of Jupiter
require
an ice (hydrogen/oxygen) core to form first, rapidly, which then starts
sucking up hydrogen gas directly from the protoplanetary disk. In the
absence of oxygen (a heavy element) the process would be slower and
more rare.

on the G:T First-In subject: a region with a low density of habitable
worlds but an average density of gas giants/etc. is a moderately
interesting setting for a campaign, especially a military one. Lots of
systems in which refuelling is possible but with no indigenous forces
(or at most small bases); commerce raiding and piracy become
much, much more possible, and long-distance independent operations
become common for warships. One might want to use a
higher star density (either half-parsec hexes, or a 3-d map) or make jump
travel quicker (3 days) if one cared about real time passage.

You\'d hope, but I wouldn\'t hold my breath.  We\'ve been building houses and
other mechanical devices for 10,000 years and we still do some pretty
stupid things.  In the example of a modern home:  Why (as you mentioned)
are essential systems made inaccessible without cutting up walls?  Why
does every kitchen contain a heat source and a heat sink, usually near one
another, but not connected?  Why aren\'t bathtubs shaped to fit the human
body?  And so forth.

And beyond this, I stand by my idea that maintenance in a "prettified"
ship will be harder.  Even if the faux-jewelwood panels pop off the walls
with a touch of your sonic screwdriver, you still don\'t have the clearly
labled, readout-displaying junction boxes and so forth you get on a
non-pretty ship.  And chances are designers will cram ducts and conduits
and junctions in at wrist-numbing angles to avoid unsightly bumps in the
wall, too.

Possibly.  I\'d bet that regulations don\'t allow this scheme though; the
last thing you want is an air-regen process that fails when you lose your
power plant!  So the installed scheme aboard ships is going to use a
low-power chemical (or biological) process to crack the CO2, with power
mostly used to circulate air through the ship and back through the
scrubbers.

If you end up trying to rig a brute-force fusion-based cracker, you\'d best
know what you\'re doing.  My guess is that the single most likely design
flaw in a jury-rigged cracker would result in significant amounts of CO
(carbon monoxide) being emitted along with the O2.  Not a good thing, and
one good reason the ship\'s engineer might be strenuously reluctant to even
try it.

(Story has been condensed)

PC\'s are in a Far Trader chasing a Merc Cruser that has a kidnapped PC on
board.

- ----

GM to Party Leader: The Merc Cruiser has landed on the planet ahead.
Sensors show it is landing in an electrical storm and is taking damage.

Party Leader: Following the Merc down, but landing the Far Trader several
miles away. Taking the air raft and going to the Cruiser\'s landing spot.

- ----

GM to Kidnapped PC: You feel that the ship has landed. The power has been
knocked out in your section and your door can be forced open.

Kidnapped PC: I escape the ship.

GM to Kidnapped PC: Because of the damage from the electrical storm and
the crew\'s attempts to repair the ship you escape unnoticed until you
open the outer hatch. As you are running away from the Cruiser you are
persued by one of the merc\'s in battledress and shooting at you. (Random
Roll) Fortunately for you the merc in battledress just became a lighting
rod. The others retreat back into the ship.

Kidnapped PC: YAHOO! But I keep running.

GM to Kidnapped PC: You are able to escape over the next hill without
being followed.

- ----

GM to Party Leader: Your sensors tell you that the Merc Cruiser is over
the next rise. (Random Rolls) The storm is lessening.

Party Leader: We leave the air raft and sneak in on foot.

GM to Party Leader: Your sneaking is succesful until you round the
Crusier and get into the view of the airlock where a merc begins firing
on you.

(Ugly standoff where no one is hit on either side)

GM to Party Leader: Another merc has arrived with a FGMP and begins
firing.

Party Leader: Retreat under the Cruser where we can\'t be hit.

GM to Player 2: You have been singed by the last shot of the FGMP and
take minor damage.

Party Leader: Leaving Players 2 & 4 at the Cruser to keep them pinned
down; Players 1 & 3 head back to the Far Trader via the air raft and
search the weapons locker for something bigger.

(Note: Players highjacked the Far Trader during an earlier part of the
chase and have failed to check it out properly.) 

GM to Party Leader: You arrive at the Far Trader and find two FGMP
hanging up in the locker.

Party Leader: Grabing them both and heading back to the Merc Cruser.

GM to Party Leader: You arrive back at the Cruser and Players 2 & 4 are
keeping the mercs bottled up in the Cruiser just fine.

Party Leader: Pulling Players 2 & 4 back and rounding the Cruiser for a
better shot at the air lock.

GM to Party Leader: You arrive in position, the merc\'s are still in the
airlock.

Party Leader: Taking aim with the FGMP and firing into the air lock.

GM to Party Leader: Your aim is good and you hit directly into the
airlock. However, the hit area from the FGMP widens to cover the enitre
Merc Cruser. When it is gone, so is the Merc Cruser.

Party Leader: OH SHIT! the Kidnapped PC is in there!

Player 2: Its a disintegrator! (dumbfounded look of awe and horror)

Player 3: (dumbfounded look of awe and horror)

Player 4: (dumbfounded look of awe and horror)

- ----

Players did find the Kidnapped PC later. They also found, after careful
searching, that the Far Trader has jump-6 and maneuver-6 at no additional
cost to tonnage space over a standard Far Trader and is able to jump up
to a total of jump-12 without refueling. The Far Trader has a number of
Tech upgrades that will need for another adventure. The players are
speculating on what sort of hell I am going to put them through now that
they have the disintegrators and the Far Trader.

Remember that a planet or nation can be "ahead" in some TL areas and
"behind" in others, starting in MT.  I\'m going on memory here, and its been
awhile since I saw the complete tables, but I\'m pretty sure late WWII under
MT and CT at least was considered TL5, and that the Eighties were TL 8.

On the other paw, th Imerial Encyclopedia puts a handheld laser in "regular
use" at TL8, so we must be fairly early on that scale (I don\'t know of any
practical handheld damage-dealing laser weapons out there...anyone else?)

I would say rather "don\'t worry about it".  Certainly build this as the
expectation to your pplayers, but remember that the *combat system* should
be the determinant, and that system should be quite adequate for keeping
high TL tanks immune to low TL tanks.

All the air you breathe now has to be run through a fusion plant and have

How do you cool it down to breatheableness? Can the radiators on the

Just an observation - I\'m not necessarily disagreeing with people, just something I 
noted - comparing Vargr to Dogs and Humans to Monkeys is not _exactly_ the same. We did 
not (correct me if I\'m wrong) evolve from chimps or orangatangs (sp) - we evolved from 
a separate branch of primates. So while we are related to the apes, we are not their 
direct evolutionary descendants. 

Vargr, however, are directly evolved from the canine lines - forced evolution, to be 
sure, and certainly some genetic tinkering.

I look at it this way - apes are our cousins. Dogs and wolves are a Vargr\'s great-great-
great-great-......-great grandparents. Is this wrong?

Note that this doesn\'t necessarily change the way the Vargr treat/look at 
dogs/wolves...but maybe it does...

The dogs in my campaign have been tinkered with themselves - nothing radical, just 
slightly smarter and healthier (and more independent) than normal pooches (they\'re 
designed for colony worlds). Being slightly smarter, I have my neo-dogs looking up to 
the Vargr. A canine view of hero-worship.

Your opinions (and knowledge, I\'m certainly no geneticist/evolution expert...) are 
appreciated...

and, I believe, there were other factors involved.  There had been several
score of similar accidents involving spills of scalding coffee; McDonalds
had been settled all of these but not changed the temperature of the coffee

	There are even some societies in which monkeys are eaten as
	food, and I don\'t believe that they see this as anything
	near canibalism.  In one sense, Vargr are closer to dogs
	than humans are to monkeys, in that dogs are their immediate

Well, he did, actually, in a way. _The Cat Who Walked Through Walls_ (one of
his later \'multiverse\' novels) not only brings Mike back, but explains why he
left in the first place. It is NOT, however, a sequel to TMIHM!

he liked the colour.

	Will it?  Such behavioural patterns are deeply rooted and

	This is a good point.  IMTU, Vargr family units consist of
	an alpha female and pack.  These packs are loosely organized
	into clans, which are organized into super-clans, etc.  Matings
	with non-alpha females are acts of treason, resulting in
	anything from banishment to death.  Banished males have a rough
	time, but may find another pack to join.  Banished females are
	in worse shape, but might eventually start a new pack.  The
	structure of Vargr society is such that life is very difficult
	outside of the established clans, but "lone wolves" do exist.

	IMTU, Grandfather\'s motivations are still undefined.  Still,
	wolves have pretty good reproductive rates, and so could
	Vargr with a "polyandrous" mating system.

Komrade Hudson, I thought you had been indoctrinated by the Serendip
Combine? I am glad to see the process was only temporary..

The Confederation fleet had been severely mauled and broken (_Battle of
Dingir_ 1st Quarter 1002) by the time the Imperials reached Terra (Quarter
2 1002). Arguably, the defenses left to Terra were not the best possible,
just the best left after 12 years. It is telling that after the six month
battle for Terra and a twelve year war, the Imperium was decided to
instigate an armistice because "the Imperial High command felt they lacked
sufficient strength to resume their advance into the rest of the Solomani
Sphere" (Invasion Earth).

The Imperium was over twice the size of the Confederation at the start of
the Rim War, but was fought to a standstill, occupying four sectors of the
Sphere. Perhaps I am wrong in my original posting objecting to the result -
the outcome of the war was predictable because the Imperials could not

\'Cat Who Walked Through Walls\' was part of his attempt to tie up *all* his 
universes into one cohesive whole that started with \'Number Of the Beast\'.

Consider that Vargr and dogs are probably about as related as humans and
chimps, and we keep chimps as pets.  Also note that some people are very
uncomfortable around chimps specifically because they are so close to
human.  So you\'d probably see Vargr who like and dislike dogs, independent
of the issue of whether they like seeing dogs as pets.

With the Vargr, I\'d expect (big surprise) no consensus on the dogs-as-pets
issue.  Probably not caring would be the majority position -- not
acknowledging or reacting to the genetic proximity is psychologically most
comfortable.  Distaste with the practice (running from semi-polite snubs
out to acts of terrorist extremism) is probably a common minority
position, while a few Vargr would want pet dogs of their own, or at least
admire the practice.  There would probably be a good deal of internal
friction among the Vargr on this issue, along with the friction between
anti-dogs-as-pets Vargr and dog-owning humans.

	Ignoring your request, Black Globes capabilities are stated in HG, MT

beyond that. 
	Basically the Black Globe (while on) absorbs all energy directed at it
(energy weapons, KKM missile effects) and dumps the energy into either
Jump drive capacitors or additional capacitors installed for the
purpose. Once the capacitors were full, they explode destroying the
ship. You can drain the capacitors by using the power for powering the
ship. While on, the ship can not fire, use sensor or maneuver. 
	You can flicker the black globe to be partly on, giving partial
protection.  I recommend looking up the reference before I start
violating copyright.

Black  Globes are Matter->Energy conversion fields with an energy-sink
function. Any matter hitting the event shell is converted to energy. Any
energy hitting the shell (or converted at the shell) is shunted to the
storage banks. This absorbtion is what creates the "Black Ball" effect:
they do not appear, but are detectable by the fact that they block the
background em-noise of space.

White globes use the same principles, but allow selectively  letting
frequencies through.

The "Flicker Rate" is the max tenths of it\'s time it may be on when
flickering (even Rating 1 devices may go to all on). The only way to shut
down a full-up BG is tto overload the capacitance bank to which it shunts
energy. Also, keep in mind that Black Globes will re-absorb any
matter/energy hitting the even shell from either side.

ships using a BG are blind when it is full up. When it is running on
flicker mode, it can be seen and shot through, altho close computer
monitoring is needed to prevent absorbing one\'s own fire.

Also, traditionally, Zuchai Crystals are used to absorb BG loads. When you
overload a ZC, you get an explosion... roughly commensurate with the total
energy stored.

	This is exactly what I am up to.  In working out the details

Bear in mind that those rules are not formal in any way (and given the changes in high energy weapons damage rules, probably need some updating in any case).

A classic traveller black globe includes a separate generator (which is rather small) and capacitor banks.  However, given how capacitors work in GURPS (they have essentially no maximum discharge rate and insane energy densities) duplicating this exactly just isn\'t playable -- a one space battery (25 tons, 5 MCr) holds 375 megawatt-hours of power, and takes 3 spinal mount hits to disable -- and on flicker mode, you can deal with the full power input of a spinal meson gun with 6 triple laser turrets.  Use something less efficient and overloading becomes functionally impossible.

However, while the mechanism for overload I give for black globes may be questionable, the basic described effect is correct.

I don\'t see any reason why the reaction would be any different than
a human would react to a Vargr with a monkey as a pet (or maybe
a lemur).

Well, first of all canine is not the same as "dog".  Canines covers
wolves, dogs, dingos, etc.  just as primates covers apes, chimpanzees,
monkey, etc.  Some peole do keep chimps as pets and they are
relatively speaking, pretty close to use among the primates.  Closer
than Vargr are likely to be to dogs.

Another difference is that the Vargr are seperated from their canine
ancestors by both evolution _and_ genetic manipulation.  They can
ask who should see animals as cousins?  Humans who, in the end,

Yes.  In fact a Vargr can claim it is the human who should look
to the jungle for their "grandparents" before a Vargr should.

Vargr are descendent from "canine stock", not dogs.  (Just like
human are descendent from "primate stock" rather than from
any contemporary primates species.)  The do, as you point out,
have an artificial genetic distance from their ancestors too.

It shouldn\'t take any long to break down in Vargr than it did with
humans.  Nor is it indicated in any of the Vargr material.

Having females who don\'t breed is a very bad idea evolutionarily
and as they become setient the push on Vargr will be the same
as with humans.

Two comments:

Current day use of wearable computers.  Lockheed has a wearable setup with 
a viewing monocle loaded with the technical manuals.  This allows a tech to 
pull up a color wiring diagram, and *actually overlay* the manual display 
on the real wiring in his field of vision.  Fixing it is reduced to making 
the real wires match the display wires.

Funny story time:  My brother had to replace the turn signal level in my 
van many years ago (the removal involved the brief fad of \'California 
Bars\', where the bartender mixed the drinks right in your mouth).  The wire 
color coding on replacement didn\'t match the original wiring.  It was a lot 
of fun to watch him replace it while still hung over.  Test right signal, 
\'blink...blink...blink".  Test left signal, "Honk...Honk...Honk."

Ob-Trav: Lot\'s of Gearhead fun when installing units not only made by 
different companies, but at different tech levels.  "Hey Chief.  Y\'all got 
any of those f-o to coax converters left over?"

the only difference I could see, is during estruses.  The scent markers are

    Today the moon was blasted out of Earth\'s orbit, apparently due to a
mammoth explosion on the Lunar surface.

    While nothing has been confirmed at this time,
speculation within the scientific community suggests this catastrophe may
stem from recent troubles with Nuclear Waste Disposal Area 2, a lunar atomic
waste dump maintained by Moonbase Alpha. The disposal area has recently been
plagued by instability and numerous Green Peace protests.

    Moonbase Alpha had been the subject of frequent debate
and concern over the last few weeks. The base served as a way station for
the Meta mission, which was to be launched by the International Space
Committee. The Meta mission was the only manned mission mounted to
investigate signals recently received from the planet Meta. These signals
are believed to be intelligent in origin. The Meta probe craft and her
spacedock were both destroyed in this incident - no word on whether the Meta
expedition will be re-mounted at a later date.

    Recently, rumors out of Alpha suggested the crew of the Meta mission
might be falling prey to some sort of peculiar virus resembling
radiation poisoning, but information from the moonbase was too sketchy to
draw full conclusions. Speculation regarding troubles on the base rose to a
fever pitch when Commander John Koenig was selected to replace a suddenly
"suspended" Commander Gorsky as Alpha\'s governor and Executive Officer.
Koenig arrived at Alpha on September 9, only four days before the disaster
blasted the moon out of Earth\'s orbit.

    Despite numerous seismic and tidal disturbances across
the globe generated by fluctuating gravity fields accompanying the moon\'s
departure work is already underway to determine the exact cause of the
explosion which propelled the moon out of orbit. While a variety of theories
are being explored, explosion at Nuclear Waste Disposal Area 2 has emerged
as the prime suspect, given last week\'s announcement that shipments of
atomic waste to the lunar surface have been temporarily "delayed" for
reasons as yet unspecified.

    British Physicist Ford Denesowicz-Plume indicates, "In
theory, an explosion of a certain magnitude and longevity could indeed act
as something of a propulsion system to push the moon away. It\'s not a very
good theory, but it\'s a theory none the less."

    Perhaps the darkest part of this tragedy are the lives
of the 311 men and women staffing Moonbase Alpha. There has been no
indication that the facility\'s staff could implement "Operation Exodus", a
well-designed contingency plan which would have allowed them an immediate
evacuation for Earth. At this time, it is assumed Alpha did not withstand
the immense structural and gravitational forces which would have accompanied
the incident - and it is presumed all souls were lost in the blast.

almost didn\'t take it because it had the wrong route number. I
changed my mind only when I saw it signalling to make the turn 
the bus I wanted would make. I mentioned the wrong number to the 
driver who looked up at some electronic display and said, "Really?
according to this, it should be right". I noticed that the bus was
obviously quite new, with something of a high-tech look.
    The very next passenger (and several later ones) also asked 
if this was the right bus. "Yes, this is the only bus that stops 
here, but in here it *still* says the sign out there is correct!" 
   At the next stop, the front door closed just as a passenger
started to board the bus. The driver apologized profusely "I 
didn\'t do that!! It just closed, by itself!" Now I noticed a 
long display panel above and in front of the driver, with 
about two dozen squares that *all* lit up a pretty red or 
yellow color when the driver finally coaxed the door to 
reopen, and blacked out again when it closed.
   Further up the street, someone commented about the interior
lights, several of which which were intermittently flickering,
and the driver observed sourly that this bus cost a quarter
million dollars, and by the way the PA system didn\'t work
either, and she was going to ask for a different one.
   A couple of stops later, after it had been shown that the 
door as slow to open as it was quick to close, a passenger who 
had just got off turned to ask for a transer. The driver said, 
"sure" and as she reached to hand it to her, the front door 
closed again.  The driver sputtered "I didn\'t DO that!" and
frantically tried to reopen it.  Too late. "That\'s IT! I\'m 
going to *demand* a  different bus!"
   At the next stop, the driver had to ask a passenger to close
the rear door after someone went that way instead. Well, it looked 
closed to me, but "It has to be all the way closed, the bus won\'t 
move if it isn\'t!"
   At the stop in front of the college, I followed about four 
other passengers who were making one of the fastest exits from 
a bus I\'ve ever seen.

If you plan to submit designs to the THUDDD

While looking for the old ISBA homepage, which
seems to be defunct, I ran across a page detailing
one of the past contributors:

You might want to look at it for some idea of what I\'m
looking for.

If you use another word processor, check to see

of them do).

Or send the information in a plain-text or HTML

line will be where you enter your key-code.  The

Phoenix Corporation
Founded in -372 as Phoenix Chandlers and Providors, Phoenix is has
interests in many aspects of the aeronautics and astrospace industry.
Intially Phoenix concentrated on the provision of consumables for
commercial starship, but in -215 it purchased Matsui Electronics and
won a contract to supply the Sylean Navy with digital personal
organisers. In -127 Phoenix aquired a bankrupt shipyard (Jergen
Craftwerke AG) and moved into the luctrative ship maintainance and
refit market. In -24 Phoenix launched their first original design (the
P-600AK, a 600Td merchant). Not really a commercial success, Phoenix
designs did not sell well until it acquired the services of Capt. Sir
Jerami Danjo (formerly of the Sylean Navy Bureau of Construction and
Repair) in -8. Sir Jerami had been widely picked as a possible
candidate for Director General of the BuConRep, before his premature
retirement after a scandal involving one of the future Emperor Cleon I\'s
(married) cousins. Under Sir Jerami\'s direction, Phoenix\'s shipbuilding
interests have moved from strength to strength and now constitute the
corporation\'s major focus. In -5 Sir Jerami was appointed CEO of Phoenix.

Phoenix is currently organised into the following divisons:
  Ship Construction and Maintaince
  Engineering & Power (the wholly owned sub. Simmens Fusionwerke AG)
  Electronics (the wholly owned subsiduary Matsui Electronics)
  Chandler and Providor
  Research and Development

Recently R&D has been focused on Sir Jerami\'s highly controversial and
unproven theories regarding stutterwarp drives. This has lead to
considerable disquite amongst the board, however Sir Jerami\'s succeses
in other areas have kept his position secure.

If you plan to submit designs to the THUDDD
competitions, I would like to get some background
information on the company that will be doing the
designing.  I will put these on the new ISBA
homepage.  I would be kind of nice to be able to link
your designs to your company page.

While looking for the old ISBA homepage, which
seems to be defunct, I ran across a page detailing
one of the past contributors:

You might want to look at it for some idea of what I\'m
looking for.

If you cannot do the HTML mark up, just send it to
me as an attachment in "Rich Text Format"

use one of the following:
        Word 6.0/95 (2.x for Windows)

        Windows Write 3.0
If you use another word processor, check to see
if it will save documents in rich text format (a lot
of them do).

When you are ready to submit a design for entry in
THUDDD, you will go to the submission page
probably to be located at

line will be where you enter your key-code.  The

the key-code and use the information contained in it

Phoenix Corporation
Founded in -372 as Phoenix Chandlers and Providors, Phoenix is has
interests in many aspects of the aeronautics and astrospace industry.
Intially Phoenix concentrated on the provision of consumables for
commercial starship, but in -215 it purchased Matsui Electronics and
won a contract to supply the Sylean Navy with digital personal
organisers. In -127 Phoenix aquired a bankrupt shipyard (Jergen
Craftwerke AG) and moved into the luctrative ship maintainance and
refit market. In -24 Phoenix launched their first original design (the
P-600AK, a 600Td merchant). Not really a commercial success, Phoenix
designs did not sell well until it acquired the services of Capt. Sir
Jerami Danjo (formerly of the Sylean Navy Bureau of Construction and
Repair) in -8. Sir Jerami had been widely picked as a possible
candidate for Director General of the BuConRep, before his premature
retirement after a scandal involving one of the future Emperor Cleon I\'s
(married) cousins. Under Sir Jerami\'s direction, Phoenix\'s shipbuilding
interests have moved from strength to strength and now constitute the
corporation\'s major focus. In -5 Sir Jerami was appointed CEO of Phoenix.

Phoenix is currently organised into the following divisons:
  Ship Construction and Maintaince
  Engineering & Power (the wholly owned sub. Simmens Fusionwerke AG)
  Electronics (the wholly owned subsiduary Matsui Electronics)
  Chandler and Providor
  Research and Development

Recently R&D has been focused on Sir Jerami\'s highly controversial and
unproven theories regarding stutterwarp drives. This has lead to
considerable disquite amongst the board, however Sir Jerami\'s succeses
in other areas have kept his position secure.

Not really, they are just being monitored to see how they handle the
higher tech, and a ship with a phased cloaking device is standing by to
render it useless if needed.
My players know that if I give them high tech, they are going to need it
soon enough. <Evil Grin>

Phoenix Corporation
Founded in -372 as Phoenix Chandlers and Providors, Phoenix is has
interests in many aspects of the aeronautics and astrospace industry.
Intially Phoenix concentrated on the provision of consumables for
commercial starship, but in -215 it purchased Matsui Electronics and
won a contract to supply the Sylean Navy with digital personal
organisers. In -127 Phoenix aquired a bankrupt shipyard (Jergen
Craftwerke AG) and moved into the luctrative ship maintainance and
refit market. In -24 Phoenix launched their first original design (the
P-600AK, a 600Td merchant). Not really a commercial success, Phoenix
designs did not sell well until it acquired the services of Capt. Sir
Jerami Danjo (formerly of the Sylean Navy Bureau of Construction and
Repair) in -8. Sir Jerami had been widely picked as a possible
candidate for Director General of the BuConRep, before his premature
retirement after a scandal involving one of the future Emperor Cleon I\'s
(married) cousins. Under Sir Jerami\'s direction, Phoenix\'s shipbuilding
interests have moved from strength to strength and now constitute the
corporation\'s major focus. In -5 Sir Jerami was appointed CEO of Phoenix.

Phoenix is currently organised into the following divisons:
  Ship Construction and Maintaince
  Engineering & Power (the wholly owned sub. Simmens Fusionwerke AG)
  Electronics (the wholly owned subsiduary Matsui Electronics)
  Chandler and Providor
  Research and Development

Recently R&D has been focused on Sir Jerami\'s highly controversial and
unproven theories regarding stutterwarp drives. This has lead to
considerable disquite amongst the board, however Sir Jerami\'s succeses
in other areas have kept his position secure.

Current ownership: Noble Families 28%, Hortalez et Cie 23%,

Thanks for the info.  I have it ready to post and I\'ll get to it later.

Depends. How close do you feel to other hominids?

The ancients were operating about 300,000 BC when they to humaniti to the
stars. That\'s just at the timeframe of homo sapiens. About 150,000 BC you
get homo sapiens neanderthalensis in Europe, then in 75,000 BC homo sapiens
sapiens (ie, us).

This is proof that the "races of humaniti" are actually
different-but-closely-related species (to some) or one of the
inconsistencies in Traveller canon (to others).

I trust you sent the publisher a note explaining this? It might

Actually, if you are running CO2 up to fusion temps to "crack" it,
it\'ll be by converting it to a plasma and using EM fields to seperate
the different mass ions. So the CO problem won\'t exist (at the temps
involved there are no radicals, just free ions.

Well, since it\'s a stream of charged iuons you are dealing with, you
can just slow it with EM fields. That deals with the temperature. I
doubt it\'b that significant an addition to the heat load of the reactor
anyway.

To be exact, humans, chimps, and gorillas share a common ancestor 2-3
million years back. And we share a *lot* of DNA. So much so that
cross-fertilization between humans and chimps may be possible, though
not likely.

"Monkeys" and "apes" split from "primates" a *lot* farther back. 

> Vargr, however, are directly evolved from the canine lines - forced

For all we know humans were tinkered with too. After all, 200-300
thousand years ago (when Grandfather was doing this), homo-sapiens
didn\'t exist. Neither did homo neanderthal. It\'s not as far back as
Lucy, but it *is* a ways back. 

> I look at it this way - apes are our cousins. Dogs and wolves are a Vargr\'s 
> great-great-great-great-......-great grandparents. Is this wrong?

Yes and no. Dogs & wolves are *also* too recent for them to be what
Grandfather grabbed. 

So in both cases it\'s "cousins". 

I have to wonder if vargr are as close to dogs/wolves as humans are to
chimps/gorillas. This has many consequences. Picture a vargr "mad
scientist" trying to breed "super soldier" vargr by crossing vargr and
wolf genes. 

> The dogs in my campaign have been tinkered with themselves - nothing
> radical,

Just by being "dogs" they are *much* modified from the base form. After
all, selective breeding for the last 20-30 thousand years is going to
have *quite* an effect.

They can\'t charge for GIFs. They *can* charge for *programs* that

That\'s "cojones". And if MS didn\'t buy a license, MS would be filing a

An E-mail message, yes. But distribution arrangements are complicated
things, and changing them is always very noisy. Microsoft Press changed
distributors earlier this year, for example... The sad part is that the
publisher gives its own direct US customers terms that are a LOT more
favourable than the Canadian distributor does to Canadian customers...

Yes. A "<blank> burning" is the sort of activity I *always* associate with

If you\'re ideological opposed to a company getting its proper due for

While I wouldn\'t want to dampen anyone\'s enthusiasm for doing this work, I
should point out that this is what _The Traveller Bibliography_ endeavours
to do for every Traveller item ever published in any of the eras.

I\'m hoping Andy Lilly will have news soon of the second edition happening
but if folks would find a web version more useful - or don\'t like my
comments on the books! - then far be it for me to put anyone off.  I\'d just
hate to see a large duplication of effort.  (And believe me - effort it
was!)

Jeff\'s collection of reviews tend to be somewhat longer than I imagined you
meant with the \'short explanation\' description above so they needn\'t
overlap that much.  Alternatively, you could seek out reviews of books that
*aren\'t* covered there (there\'s plenty of them) and put hyperlinks to the
ones that have be done already - if Jeff is ok with that.

Just some thoughts

Cracking to a plasma then doing mass-spectroscopy style sorting is exactly
what I had in mind.  In a lab setting, with good controls, you could make
it work as you describe.  To do it on jury-rigged equipment, with an
imperfectly calibrated magnet, guess-and-hope collector paths, poorly
constrained exit velocities, probable gas backflow due to the volumes you
need to process to do any good -- I\'m sticking by my model.

Slowing it down with fields still gives you a heat load to dissipate.
Laws of thermodynamics don\'t care \'bout your highfalutin\' EM fields, they
just know that there\'s X amount of energy and it all has to go somewhere.
And the problem isn\'t the load in any case; it\'s just cooling it enough,
fast enough, to produce a sufficient quantity of breathable O2.

By the way, for anyone interested in a harrowing depiction of the
"overloaded refugee ship" problem we\'ve been discussing, see Cherryh\'s
_Downbelow Station_.

	What makes you think that the basic reproductive behaviour
	patterns of humans have broken down?

	As can be demonstrated with wolves (apparently at least.
	I am not personally familiar with their mating system, 
	but there are certainly other species such as ants) it
	can be a "good idea evolutionarily" to have females not
	reproducing. For example, if the dominant female kills
	any other pups, the best way to pass on your genes may
	be to wait for the dominant to die, and in the mean time
	help her pups survive since they are all your nieces and
	nephews (and therefore carry many of your genes, assuming
	that the females in a group are all closely related).
	There are other possible routes to non-reproductive 
	females, but that is the most likely for the Vargr
	ancestor.

	Exactly how sentience and technology would influence the 
	evolution of such a mating system is an interesting 
	question. If you were to argue that, IYTU, Vargr with
	a more "human" mating system enjoyed higher reproductive
	rates over the past 300,000 years (is that how long ago
	they were created?), I would not try to convince you
	otherwise, but neither would I accept that as inevitable.
	As usual, I have started with my own perception of what
	the Vargr are like, and worked out an explanation that 
	(to me) is reasonable. With a little wave of the hand,
	it\'s amazing what a GM can get away with.

	Your point is well taken. I am not very familiar with the

	they originated about 300,000 years ago (humans and chimps
	have descended from a common ancestor that lived about 3-5

What you\'re missing here is the reason for why the population
restrictions evolved into the species. (and familiarity with wolf and
canid biology)

Wolves, as large pack-hunting carnivorous mammals sit on the very top of
the food chain...and typically need a large territory to support their
population, menaing lower population densities.

On the _average_ only the dominant pack members breed. In good years,
however, females lower on the heirarchy do breed. This is how packs
multiply when food supplies are abundant, by having more females breed
rather than increasing litter size. In very lean years, even the alphas
don\'t breed. 

OTOH, wildlife biologists really don\'t have a completely firm grasp on
how wolves do things, because as long as systematic studies have been
carried out, it has been on populations that were under enormous
stresses: we\'ve been busy wiping out the majority of the wolf population
on this continent for a very long time. 

There are only a few places left where wolves exhibit \'normal\' behavior,
and these are probably the most marginal areas of their original ranges.

For instance...what were wolf breeding patterns back when the American
Great Plains were the Serengeti of North America, with vast herds of
ungulates for a food supply, and mild winters (presuming the wolves
followed the migrating herds)? We haven\'t a _clue_ other than some poor
anecdotal evidence.

I\'d wager that breeding in a wolf pack was considerably less restrictive
under conditions where a pack could easily  bring down enough food
animals for a large number of pups per year. Probably all or most of the
females would breed in a good year, similar to lions. Which _male_ bred
would be a different thing entirely, though. However, as Peez points
out, most of the females in a given pack are related, and have a genetic
stake in all of their pups survival.

So, actually, IMO a freer breeding pattern would be the norm in a canid
poulation that has, as a high tech Vargr society does, unlimited food
supplies.

And highly restrictive breeding patterns _is_ detrimental to the
development of a high tech society...you don\'t get the free time to
develop technology until you have a regular surplus of food; you don\'t
have that until you develop agriculture, you don\'t have _that_ unless
you can breed enough workers to work the fields. 

Remember, along with meat a major component of the Vargr diet is fruits
and some vegetables; canids while predominately carnivorous, are
remarkably omnivorous when necessary. Also you can raise a much higher
density of meat animals if you\'re growing food for them. That means you
can also stay in one place, another harbringer of increased technology.

There\'s something on the order of a 95% or so matchup in DNA between humans & 
chimps.  Might be more.  And no, I can\'t remember the source.  Scientific

Perhaps homo neanderthal was Grandfather\'s main human assistants, and homo 
sapiens was a mutation.  Nonetheless, neanderthal became extinct.  And I

Considering that current theory is, they\'re all descended from wolves to begin with and can *still* crossbreed with them without having sterile offspring, yeah.  From what I gather, the base DNA hasn\'t changed in the last 20, 30 thousand years, just some of the \'cosmetic\' stuff.  Selective breeding doesn\'t *really* create new species, just new subspecies still interfertile with the parent species.  Of course, with recombinant DNA techniques, we\'re beginning to have the capability of changing all that...

* Pagan Publishing Purchases Hasbro!

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

September 10, 1999

(SEATTLE) Pagan Publishing today confirmed a long-standing
rumor: at various points in their lives, various Pagan
staffers have, indeed, purchased products made by Hasbro.

"Heck, we buy Hasbro all the time!" commented Pagan
president Scott Glancy. "Brian Appleton alone has purchased
enough Kenner Star Wars toys to finance Hasbro\'s recent $325
million acquisition of WotC."

Art director Dennis Detwiller concurred. "When I was eight,
I bought--well, actually, my parents bought--a copy of
MONOPOLY."

The surprise revelation leaves the future of Hasbro
purchases by Pagan staffers an open question. The recent
division of the staffers into pro-Jar Jar/anti-Jar Jar camps
has left some observers wondering if the new toy lines will
find their way into the Pagan office.

"The heck with Star Wars," Pagan editor John Tynes noted.
"I\'m just pleased as punch that now Hasbro will be my source
for Pokemon. Gotta catch \'em all!"

Pagan author and editor John H. Crowe, III, was not
available for comment. Sources suggest he was disgusted with

Thanks, I\'ve not heard anything from Tim concerning

That\'s why it has been over a year since the 
completion of THUDDD 8.  Every time I can automate 
the process, it lengthens the time remaining before 
you need to find a new THUDDD coordinator.  (If you 
don\'t believe me, ask the last one.)

Programming has commenced and should be 
completed before the end of the dead-line.

Be careful here.  Remember that, in the broad genetic sweep of life
all multicellular organisms can be said to be first cousins.  To many
bacteria (or even a amoeba, which is in the same domain as mammals)
you and a mushroom are almost the same organism with only "cosmetic"
changes.

From memory...

Genetically (there is now way to trace by fossil record) they are
derived from "canine" stock in general.  It may be that the Ancients
mixed genes from different stock.  They do not appear to be decendent
from any extant canine species (just like humans aren\'t descendent
from any extant primate species).

They also did start at TL 0.  I think the Ancients deliberately
started them at this TL and then watched there evolution (they weren\'t
as appears to be true for humans, "pets" or "workers").

Is there any reason you just can\'t give both?  Though I would guess
it would make the most sense to give them for the design system used

I have no problem with a company getting it\'s proper due for software which
they have produced. I have a big problem with a company patenting an
algorithm after it has been publish in the public domain, by it\'s
originator. Like DNA and several other technologies that the U.S. government
is issuing patents on I believe that there are some things that shouldn\'t be
owned. No one should be able to patent the Pythagorean theorem or copyright
the color red.

As I understand it Unisys got control of the patent when Sperry Rand merged
with Burroughs in 1986.  It was based on information theory published in the
seventies.  Years after the method was widely known a patent was applied for
and about 5 years after that the patent office approved it.  By that time
the compression method was already widely used.

Unisys has every legal right to charge a fee to utilize their patented
compression technology. Whether their request should have been approved by
the patent office is another story.

that almost all technological development in the OTU is either done by the
IN or other Imperial ministry, who must not be subject to Patent law, or in
secret by MegaCorps, who are probably breaking the letter of the law by
engaging in research. After all there is almost no way to improve something,
even something you hold the rights to, without taking a concept from another
field or technology to do it.

For example: I own the patent on refrigerators. I want to make them more

	Generally speaking, carnivores require lots of room, \'warm-

	As you pointed out, I don\'t know a lot about wolf biology,
	but think about this: how many young can an alpha female
	produce per year? According to a site that turned up with
	a quick web-search, 3-10 is typical. The same site lists
	8-35 individuals per pack, and 2 years to maturity. Even
	if only the alpha female reproduces, this is likely to
	result in much faster population increase than in, say,
	humans. Even if only one female reproduces (with higher
	success because she is aided by her pack, and because her
	young do not have to compete with so many cousins), the
	pack could respond to increased resources faster than us,
	without having to rely on other females. Once again, I am
	not claiming that only the alphas breed, I am only
	suggesting that it is conceivable that it might be so.

	Very good point. Wolf behaviour patterns probably evolved

	live today. Those patterns have had little time to
	change, however.

	It is hard to draw a distinction between \'cosmetic\' stuff
	and \'base DNA.\' Studies have shown that the differences 
	between individuals, the differences between populations,
	the differences between subspecies, and the differences
	between species are of the same type, just not the same
	degree. Thus, there is no reason to think that selective
	breeding cannot result in reproductive isolation. It just
	takes time.

This probably refers to the following:

P:  Population multiplier (multiply the base population for a given
universal planetary profile by this figure, to get the actual
population)

B:  Belts (the number of planetoid belts in the system)

G:  Gas Giants (the number of gas giants in the system)

Thus, PBG: 323 means that, given a base population of (for example) 6,
the system in question would have an actual population of 3,000,000 (3 x
10^6).  It would also have 2 significant [usable as resources] planetoid
belts, and 3 gas giants.

Durned if I know.  It seems to refer to the satellite\'s orbit, as it
relates to the system\'s habitable zone, but don\'t quote me on that....

The rest of your questions seem to deal with information not covered in
Book 6, nor in any T4 materials, so I won\'t address them.

I don\'t see why not.

However, since the weapons are presumably to deter attackers (this isn\'t
a Q-ship) I don\'t think that putting a figheter in the cargo bay will count.

You\'d need a dedicated hangar, but I\'d suggest external grapples so
that everyone knows you have a fighter.

(The authorities will be very unhappy if they find that you have put the
 fighter in a crate or left it behind and used the hangar for cargo space.
 Just like they be unhappy if the normal subbie stoped employing turret
 gunners.)

        Given what I have seen for fighter-pilot life expectancy in CT
sessions I have played, no.  Fighters get mission-killed *very* quickly by
critical hits due to size vs wpn USP.  One Patrol cruiser can mission kill
four fighters per round, quite easily.

In the OTU, nothing I\'ve ever seen indicates that they use Vilani-style IP
laws. More likely, the OTU TL advance is slowed because of the sheer size of
the OTU, and a different design and manufacturing philosophy. Given that
starships that are 70 years old are still worth a lot, I suspect a \'built to
last\' philosophy holds sway over the durable goods sector, keeping TL changes
slow. I\'ll bet the average TL of novelty or other more ephemeral items is
generally higher throughout the Imperium. It\'s just that a system\'s TL is
_such_ a broad brush, the fact that they still make their starships at TL-13
simply drowns out the fact they\'re making Tl-16 toys.

The other thing holding down TL advances in the OTU, imo, is that the IN
doesn\'t want to change all that fast, so they can maintain an effective
logistics structure _throughout_ the Imperium. Having a TL-16 starship isn\'t
much use if you\'re stuck out in the boonies with some TL-13 manufacturing
plants manking parts locally.

You would, in RL, be considered a crazy person. Most companies would just
approach the chip manufacturer and say, \'could you make these changes for me?
I guarantee if you do, I\'ll buy x million of them.\' It\'s done all the time; in
fact, chip manufacturers often advertise their willingness to modify the
designs exclusively for a specific customer, if that customer is big enough.

You make refrigerators, not chips. You _buy_ chips.

If you _are_ in the same general line of business, ie: you make embedded
processors for refrigeration, and company y makes embedded processors for
automobiles, if you modify company y\'s chip to make better refrigerator chips,
you better either license it, or have a battalion of good lawyers handy. (And
given what can be done in the OTU between consenting Megacorps) maybe you
should round up a few battalions, too.

However, I suspect also, that a lot of IP in the OTU is condidered Trade
Secrets, and is not patented. This is a GOOD THING. It leads to all sorts of
fun opportunities for the PC\'s to get in a little industrial espionage. ;-) It
also justifies trade war between Megas much more than mere territory disputes.

If Mega X steals the designs for SuperChip from Mega Y, Mega Y may not want to
bring it up into court, because then they have to prove that Mega X\'s design
is stolen from theirs, which means revealing that design in court. Open court
or not, this is still showing off the corporate family jewels. 

Simply blowing up Mega X\'s chip manufacturing plants, stealing their cargoes,
etc may be enough to get Mega X to cry Uncle and either pay Mega Y a
bucketload of money for the SuperChip or quit making it. (and transferring all
the techs and engineers who worked on it, their staff, their records, etc,
etc, etc to Mega Y. Hows THAT for a hostile takeover! \'Chief Design Engineer
Dilbertii, you are now a corporate prisoner of war.\' :-)

The Sci-Fi channel *really* missed a bet here. They could have shown
the first episode of Space:1999 "as it happened". :-)

In fact, it\'d be nice to have a list of various "future" events from SF
stories (and the occasional "mainstream" book/movie) that are "going to
happen" in the 2000-2050 time frame. 

If there were enough, we could talk the Sci-Fi channel into a "regular
special", say with a title along the lines of "Futures Past". :-)

They didn\'t develop the format. CIS developed the format, and
essentially made a gift of it to the computer community.

What Unisys did was develop a compression technique, ans then *publish*
it WITHOUT TELLING ANYONE THEY WERE FILING A PATENT ON IT.

That\'s like going to a party with big buffet spread and they getting
handed a bill for what you\'ve eaten when you are getting ready to go
home. 

It may be *legal* to charge for LZW compression, but it sure as hell
wasn\'t *ethical* to let people *think* it was another "open standard"
and then turn around and charge for it after it\'d gotten embedded in
all sorts of products. 

It\'s hard to get much sleazier than that.

Just use "fusion torch" recycling *very* sparingly. If Traveller\'s
fusion reactors *really* lent themselves to this, the background falls
apart. 

The trick is, that if this works, then it costs so little to process
trash, seawater (or "country rock") that anything short of *really*
high grade ore isn\'t worth mining and shipping. 

Sure, you don\'t get as much X out as you would with a good ore. But you
are also getting Y, Z and all the rest of the elements out.

What this does to the raw materials situation is almost as bad as what
nanotech does. Or "fabers" (basicly a gizmo that has an effect similar
to a Star Trek "replicator", but with more believable tech - if we don\'t
have them in less than 100 years, it\'ll be because we didn\'t try).

The automated displays have been around for years. They use a lookup
table burned into an EPROM. Which is down by underpaid techs at the bus
company. Getting it wrong happens occasionally.

More often though, what happens it that the driver punches in his route
number instead of the number of the display he wants. You see, since
there are often multiple variants on a basic route, all of which need
different messages, the message number *doesn\'t* match the sign number.
They give drivers a char, and the control panel even shows the message.
Buut some drivers just don\'t "get it" with regards to having to punch
in the number from the chart. After a year or so, they\'ll quit screwing
it up.

That\'s *required*. It\'s a safety interlock. If the sensor doesn\'t show
the door as closes, the bus won\'t moving. So if it slips a bit in the
mounting, the door has to be closed *really* tight.

No idea what the deal is with the "auto close" on the doors. *That* is
a stupid feature.

The thing is, at the plasma temps, the C & O will be seperate. In the
"mass spectrometer", the masses of the ions are *very* different (C-12
vs O-16). The other isotopes aren\'t plentiful enough to risk. So the
only mixing danger is after you\'ve run them thru the mag field and
started "cooling" them. It\'s not like trying to seperate N-15 and O-15,
were the difference is a fraction f a percent.

BTW, I expect that the reactor *already* has something like this, for
seperating out the He-4. And it may be part of the fuel purifier.

Also check out some old stories by Brunner(?). He had a whole series
involving the discovery of planets that had been settled by ships
carrying refugees from a planet whose star was about to go nova.

The basic idea was that the last few hundred took off from the
nightside of the planet and tried to stay in the planet\'s shadow as
long as possible while making the equivalent of a "run to jump". In his
universe that set the direction of the jump, and in this case, it was
towards unexplored space. 

The more overcrowded ships had various problems and dropped out in
unexplored systems and didn\'t have to option of making another jump,
the life support couldn\'t handle it. And for some, the ship itself was
damaged by exposure to the heat from the star before jump. So where
they came out was where they stayed. 

But at least a couple of the stories have descriptions of the sort of
conditions that prevailed on board. 

Generations later, such colonies were *still* being discovered. There
was an entire "branch" of the IISS equivalent dedicated to the problems
involved in recontacting them. 

There\'d have to be changes for the Traveller universe. Instead of a
Nova, make it an "irregular variable" or a "flare star" that got
*really* active after being quiet for millenia.

Use some sort of "distortions in space time", "strange radiations from
the star"  or even "too hastily set jump co-ordinates" to explain the
misjumps (at least with Traveller we\'ve got misjump to *help* scatter
them!). 

That could even be a sub-plot. Researchers have noticed that the "lost"
colonies seem to concentrate in an area well beyond J-6. They want any
ships records that may still survive from the known colonies and
especially from any newly discovered ones in hopes that a pattern will
emerge that will allow controllable "mis-jumps". Of course, they\'ll
never figure it out. But nobody in the game world knows that, just us
folks outside. :-)

It also give a nice excuse for at least *one* sector or subsector with
a lot of populated "hell-holes". They didn\'t have the option of going
elsewhere.

You\'ve just reminded me of an incident at a former jpb. They had these
furnaces for growing monocrystalline silicon. They all hooked to a
central computer over serial links. An old Data General system with a
75 port serial box that was as big as the computer. 

They had been using "short haul modems" which converted the RS-232
signals into a 2-wire signal and back. That allowed for the
multi-hundred foot cable runs involved. The "modems" were quite small,
theye weren\'t a lot larger than a normal DB-25 "hood" on a cable. DB-25
on one end, screw terminals for the wire pair on the other. They cost
something like $50-100 apiece at the time. 

Later, they upgraded to units that used fibier optics. this was both
more immune to noise, and a lot *safer* around the voltages and
magnetic fields of the furnaces.

One of the engineers wandered by and saw the maintenance tech toss one
of the short haul modems in the trash. When he jumped on him the tech
looked blank and said "It\'s just an adapter, isn\'t it?".

Alas, this was the last unit to be converted and  only a couple other
modems were in the trash can. The rest (multiple *thousands* of dollars
worth) were long gone. 

The engineer told me about this when I mentioned wishing I could afford
a couple of short haul modems. As he put it. "If it hadn\'t been for
those idiots, we\'d have had enough that I could just *give* you a
couple. As it is, I\'m saving that last pait in case I ever need some
for an official project." :-(

*Never* underestimate the stupidity of people doing an
upgrade/overhaul. Unless *explicitly* instructed to save items being
replaced, they will treat them as "worthless junk" no matter *how* much
they are actually worth.

We were refferring to "in vitro" fertilization. Attempting "in vivo"
could get the human badly injured (the average chimp can tie a human in
a knot). 

And while I don\'t know about chimps, I know that with gorillas there\'d
be a *major* problem with size mimatch. Apparently the average gorrilla
is only 3 inches...

Try the 3-D Starmaps page at:

which has pointers to about 20 bazillion of those maps
and viewing programs.  Personally, I think loading the Gliese
near star catalog into Jo Grant\'s CHVIEW.EXE program produces
one of the best renditions of a "real space map" you\'ll get
this side of the Z9M9Z..

  Oh, sure, if you buy the crap put out by piddly little pocket empires
like Esperanza and Joyeuse ("Non-Charismatic Leader" - at least they got
_that_ right). Now, if you get _quality_ TL C product, you get coverage 
by p. 41 of HG2, reducing your criticals by up to 6, or none from weapons
below USP 7 - and how expensive is your "Patrol Cruiser"?

Yeah, yeah, yeah... All Real Traveller editions (IE, not GT) have  had a
large number of habitable worlds in systems... it would appear that the
anchients were REALLY busy making worlds habitable. CT Bk 6, MT, TNE all
used the same methods for system generation, and all have the same
problems. T4 was looiking like it would use the same system generation
mechanics, too.

 These are the orbit of the satellite expressed in gas giant radii.

diameters?

 This notation appears to be unique to this software. Since size codes above 
"A" aren\'t part of the OTU, you could assume that "B" is a small gas giant 
and "C" is a large one. According to Scouts (Book 6) small GGs range from 
20,000 to 60,000 km in radius, while large GGs range from 60,000 to 120,000km 
in radius.  There has been some speculation that gas giants wouldn\'t actually 
get that -size- though they could certainly have the associated mass (gas 
being what it is...). DGPs World Builder\'s Handbook had an actual table for 
generating GG radius, but even they never seemed to use it...
 I notice the GG is also showing a TL. More silliness...

  The rules of system generation (and by extension the definition of a "main 
world") prevent any other world in the system from having more people or 
better TL than the mainworld. These other worlds shown below are mostly 
fellow colonies of Jenghe (govt type 6). Most of this system apparently 
belongs to another system\'s government. Jenghe has been designated the 
mainworld due to being the most habitable and having at least the pop and TL 
of everything else. This means it\'s either the original colony world insystem 
and the center of this system\'s economy, OR it was originally independent.  
The low law level suggests that this is a friendly colony situation, not a 
takeover, so Jenghe is the base for another system\'s utter utilization of 
this one.

That should be the distance of the satellite from the planet in the planet\'s
radii.  So the Earth-Moon system would be listed as

  3  Terra  ...
     60 Luna ...

Moons under 200 km in diameter (smaller than size S) are ignored.  So
while Jupiter has sixteen moons, only four are size S or larger and are
counted; and neither of Mars\'s moons are counted either (although the
DGP _Solomani & Aslan_ supplement suggested one had been destroyed or
knocked out of orbit in the Solomani Rim War).

Some of the data in your example looks ... odd.  For example:

Gas giant diameter generation was messed up a bit (compared to reality) in
Book 6, as I understand it.  There were two main sizes, "Small" and "Large"
which covered a range of possible diameters each, and no UWP was assigned.
So the GG UWPs don\'t make sense, although I notice they all are size code C.
Also, I don\'t think it\'s possible for a ring (size code R) to be assigned
any orbit greater than 3 radii under the rules (quite reasonably), so there\'s
something screwy there too.

It\'s good to see that people are using Stuart Ferris\'s World Builder 
Deluxe software.  It\'s probably the best Traveller software I\'ve seen 
for system generation and extended detailing of world data.  He\'s put 
an incredible amount of work into the process, and his future plans 
are even more impressive.  :)

>     First what is PBG: 323?

P: population modifier.  It\'s the primary digit of the population of 
the mainworld.  In this case, it\'s 3 X 10 ^ (Population Level from 
the UWP.)

B: number of planetoid belts in system

G: number of gas giants in system

The number given is the orbit number, in planetary radii, of the 
satellite around the main planet.  They are not in order as they 
would normally appear in published extended systems, due to the way 
the data is generated.  That problem has been corrected, I believe, 
and will be available in a later release of WBH.  (And the details on 
that are very, very cool!  :)

I\'m unsure of that value, but a table of diameters is available in 
both CT\'s Grand Census and MT\'s World Builder\'s Handbook, upon which 
World Builder Deluxe is based.

Yes, it does have millions of inhabitants.  Looks like a colony of 
the mainworld Jenghe to me.  But good point, as the population should 
not equal or exceed that of the mainworld, since according to Book 6 
or MT\'s Referee\'s Manual on extended system generation, the mainworld 
is considered such due to its population being the highest in the 
system.

Ah, the perview of the Referee: to take this random data and make it 
into an adventure.  Enjoy!

  Well, the IN no doubt could have taken the Grand Fleet again with a rest
for reinforcements, right? But with Terra (the ultimate bargaining chip,
supposedly) already in hand, why actually force their way into sub-sectors
full of systems where the Party had held sway - and directed Home Guard
budgets - for centuries?

  My suggestion would be that the end of the war was clearly a political
artefact, and not an inevitable result of the military situation. If so,
then we can profitably ask ourselves why the Imperium might have been
happy to stop the largest war of conquest and pacification in almost 800
years (well, actually, _ever_)?

  I have to wonder if some factions in the 3I (Vilani, Ilelish) maybe
didn\'t think that _another_ decade of war followed by generations of
military occupation of worlds prepared for protracted struggle might
not be a good precedent to set?

  Alternately, the economic costs of the war might have threatened to 
spiral completely out of control just as the crunch came in funding the
reconstruction of all the Imperial worlds liberated from the Solomani.

to re-organize, but not to actually _create_ the reserves required to prevent
the IN from prosecuting the war to a purely military (if sterile) victory.

  Perhaps they could have, but the opportunity cost is there, and the longer
that the war promises to go on, the greater the risk that the Zho\'s will feel
compelled to go for it. The tempation to roll up to Deneb and permanently
seal the 3I away from the Consulate might be overwhelming if the IN were now
committed to calling more sector reserves away to fight a decade long war
for the suppression of the individual worlds of the Sphere.

I\'m currently working as a cleaner, and on one job the week before I 
started they had a big upgrade and cleanout. They threw out a good 
half dozen old 3/486\'s, in their cases, with drives (all small) and 
network cards. Apparently they were throwing out all their ISA 
networks cards in favour of PCI. When I asked what they\'d done with 
them I was told "They all went to the dump, it\'s not like they were 
any use." Grrr.

Not worth much, maybe, but still useful.

It looks like you also have an interesting character generator out there
as well.
I was going to point out that program to you until I checked the
address.

It looks like your work may be the defacto standard. How do you feel

people writing programs that utilize the character files or ship files

your programs?

How about because the Vilani didn\'t want to see all those nasty 
Solomani back in the Imperium? The original \'integration\' of the 
Terrans include as a part of its cost a very strong Solomani influence 
at court. Given the obvious economic power of the Solmani sphere 
who long would it have taken them to regain that position if they were 
reincorporated, even if by conquest?

How good would the 3I\'s maps of the rimward edges have been? I 
don\'t imagine the Navy would\'ve enjoyed pushing deeper and deeper 
into poorly mapped territory trying to finish the Solomani. It would be 
an effectively impossible task, as they\'d just keep retreating rimward. 
Didn\'t the Confederation mount some quite extensive rimward 
explorations?

The following are all High Guard figures:

=======
depends
=======

The type T is 400T, has 4G, model/3 computer, 2 x factor-3 missile
and 2 x factor-4 laser turrets

If you shoot at the MCr 18.6, 8.5ton Gnat from TCS
model/2 (=1 because no bridge), Agility 0, missile-2, laser-2, sand-3,
no armour

If the defence is only the sandcaster, the Type T hits
missiles: 69% (60% at short range)
lasers  : 60% (49% at long range)

(Then again, the Gnat can\'t hit at all, it just cannot overcome the
 agility and computer advantage.)

So the Gnats are dead, but it will take a couple of rounds.

==================
One the other hand
==================

The Imperial heavy fighter (MCr 105, 50tons)
model/7 (=6 due to no bridge), Agility 6, missile-2, laser-2, sand-3
and armour-8

The Type T cannot hit this at all. even if it could, the armour
would prevent automatic criticals.

The IHF hits the Type T
missiles: 41% (27% at short range)
lasers  : 25% (15% at long range)

So now the Type T is dead, although a single IHF will take some time.

=======
However
=======

Unless your Type R subbie has its two triple missile turrets as a
single battery, it still won\'t hit the Type T (even if it does, we\'re
only talking 2% chance at long range and if the Type T has any armour
there won\'t be any automatic criticals.)

The Type R is not much better protected from the Type T either.

So in practice, whilst the Gnat is being killed, the subbie could
probably escape.

But if you bolt an IHF to your subbie, expect no one without some
serious modifications to attack you.

He took a carload of computers, network cards, modems, software
(still in shrinkwrap) and other goodies out of the dumpster, as did 
his co-workers. The company dumped it not because it was worthless,
but because to dispose of it *any* other way - even by donating it

store it. The cost of those activities was enough that the company
simply decided to buy all new computers and forgo salvage on the old.

Remind\'s me of two stories:

I had a friend who worked for a telecom company.  When they threw
out their old 486 and low spec Pentium PCs a  manager  there  got
this idea that his company could be liable for defects if  people
got them second hand.  So all  the  old  PCs  were  placed  in  a
crusher and destroyed.  Not only that but a security guard had to
watch over them while they were being crushed in case  any  staff
members tried to take one.

Then there was the  farce  at  BBC  Merchandising.  They\'ve  been
publishing Dr Who TV episodes on VHS (a big money maker for them)
and after (supposedly) getting all  material  still  in  the  BBC
Archieve they\'ve been searching the world for  missing  episodes.
When (later) a guy from BBC Merchandising  visited  the  Archieve
building he saw to his horror a staff member spooling out old  Dr
Who video tape into a skip.  He asked what was going on  and  the
Archieve staff member looked blankly and said "its just old black
and white material, no one\'s interested in that!"

ObTrav:  IMTU  the  new  "Model  800"   Suleiman   class   Type-S
scout/couriers don\'t have the air filter problem mentioned in CT.
Imagine the irritation of the PCs (who own  an  older  Model  700
Suleiman class Type-S) when they find their  local  starport  has
destroyed all the old replacement air filters because "they\'re no
longer needed".  Now they have to go for the permanent fix  which
reduces their cargo space.

Since you are not producing any extra energy the radiators are running at 
normal load. However if you cool the gas somewhere where the AC isn\'t built 
to handle extra heat you could have a local heat build-up.

<Assumption IMTU>
Ships are air-conditioned to prevent heat build-up (in closed rooms, centre 
of the ship etc.). Areas like engineering, workshops, weapons and hangars 
have heavy duty cooling while staterooms, the bridge etc. have a lesser 
degree of cooling.

All this nice heat is then transported (at huge efficiencies) to the 
radiators (that are even more efficient) and is radiated away from the ship. 
This system is not perfect however and especially engineers can literary 
work in their shirtsleeves. Ship-atmosphere tend to have a temperature 
between 20-30 degrees Celsius (cold end - staterooms/bridge, hot end - 
engineering).

So each room is rated at a number of Watts equal to what the AC can handle.

The radiators will be running at normal load, but the gases are being
vented to the internal areas of the ship - in effect, instead of the power
plant radiating excess heat into space through its own efficient radiators,
it\'s radiating the heat into the ship\'s habitable compartments. That 
should require some good gear to move the heat to the external radiators.

him off while he listened to the pleasant wheedling of the tree krakens in his royal
arboretum, when his augmented ears noticed an almost subliminal beeping noise --
somewhere in his sumptuous quarters.  The noise had not been there earlier, he
was sure.

The Thon sent a young slave with a summons to take to the court Wizir, who
always made it a point to be awake before the Thon.  Now shod in soft groat-leather
slippers, the Thon padded under a stone arch, out of the bathhouse, down a
colonnaded hall, paved and lined with streaked coral-marble, mostly open to the
view of the coastline of this palatial island.  Young Stage Trees studded the island\'s
north slope, looking like Aslan-sized cinnamon sticks frothed at the base with tufts
of soft yellow-green down.  They were interspersed with tall, wispy Trings, plants
with three boles joining two meters up, and continuing as one to soar another ten
meters, before bursting into a wide splendour of muted red foliage and pale, fist-sized
fruit.  The Trings were imported to this world within the last generation, and were
planted specifically for this vacation house.  Their progeny grew in low clumps here and
there, scattered from the foothills all the way down to the very shore, where they clung
tenaciously to available hunks of turf.

A cool breeze offered up the fresh scent of the Trings to the Thon, who accepted
them gladly.  Upon reaching the courtroom he contrived to have windholes fitted in
the court itself, with controls -- shutters, he reminded himself -- to block the holes
when desired.  Servants swung the massive marble doors on their precise pivots, and
the Thon entered to the court musicians\' sithars and githars playing a deep and sincere
harmony.

There stood the Wizir, dressed in Imperial high uniform, platinum buttons glinting,
boots polished to a high gloss, and his strange, pleated pants.  His customs are strange
ones, thought the Thon.  A servant began announcing His Thonness\' Holy Presence, but
the Thon interrupted before all that started up.  "Ah, my Wizir, I desire your counsel over
a new matter."  The Wizir wore no expression.

"And what would your Eminence esteem my counsel for?" replied the Wizir
diplomatically.  The silver sunburst on his jacket shone slightly; he paid the extra credits
for the bioluminescent patch.  It seemed to impress the Thon as well.  With aplomb, the
Thon pronounced: "Wizir, there is a bomb in my quarters."

The Wizir hoped not.  "Shall I look into the matter, then?" he ventured.  "Of course,
Imperial stooge!" cried the Thon with feeling.  "We must defuse it immediately!  No
doubt an enemy has contrived to destroy my person and bring my people to ruin!
Yes: we must find this device, and then begin plotting immediately to make sorry
the responsible party.  At once!  Follow!"  With this outburst the Thon scurried out
of the court and back down the hallway.  It was all the Wizir could do to catch up
with him and slow him down.  "After all, " he said, "if it really is a bomb, you don\'t
want to be near it, do you?"  The Thon thought about it, and reluctantly agreed to
wait until the Wizir fetched some devices from his chamber.  The Thon noted the
tools with disdain; the real palace had devices better than these toys.

It was relatively easy to find.

***

"It is not a bomb", said the Wizir finally.  A few servants and the Thon were
clustered around the seated Wizir, who had set devices around the beeping
case and attached probes to its surface.  The case was the size of a small
brick -- easily big enough to house a bomb that could level the building --
matte black, with glossy traces covering two surfaces.  It was to these traces
that the Wizir attached his probes.

"What do you mean?  Of course it\'s a bomb!  I\'m royalty!  That\'s how we do
things!"  protested the Thon.  He jiggled a flabby arm at the Wizir.  "Our two --
no, three -- three methods of statecraft: fear, pain, and -- oh, I\'m all flustered,
I can\'t remember them now.  But I tell you, it SOUNDED like a bomb."  He
frowned menacingly at the Wizir.  "Why isn\'t it a bomb?"

The Wizir remained expressionless.  "Because it\'s a message."  Before the Thon
could gather a withering reply, the Wizir sent an activation code to the brick,
from which sprang a human.  The Thon issued a strangled cry.  The Wizir noted
that the Thon didn\'t get many holographic messages.

Before them stood a heavyset man, hale and robust, with a full golden beard
and shoulder-length hair, braided in well-managed and bejewelled locks.  He
looked every bit of his Danish heritage.  Keen, penetrating eyes and an aura
of relaxed readiness gave him a hunter\'s, and a metal hat with horns poking out
of them made him look every bit of a barbarian.  However, his dress indicated
that he operated a starship; this was no flatlander.  He seemed to fix the Thon
in his steely gaze and hold him transfixed, as if sizing up a side of tree ox.  The
Wizir\'s expression became slightly cold, and he spoke with venom.

"Sunbeard."

Then the image laughed, at once merry yet powerful.  The Wizir\'s devices jumped
at his laugh, and seemed to try to skitter off the table and hide.  Then he spoke.

"Greetings to the Thon!  I just thought I\'d thank your royal person for your services of
late.  It\'s not every day I can rely on such faithful servants such as yours, in such a
blessed kingdom as yours.  And though you might protest our goods, believe me that
they are in no way meant to belittle your free, selfless grace to myself and my crew.
Think of them as a return gift from us.  I do hope you like the groatle slippers.  Farewell.
We shall probably never meet again."  The brick went quiet, possibly for good.  The Wizir
stared at the Thon\'s feet, and the Thon shifted uncomfortably, color rising to his cheeks.

  Depends on their status within (/under?) the 3I. It\'s sort of unclear
what the economic standing of the ex-SAR would be, as it seems unlikely
that the Sphere would just roll over and go back to playing good little
Impy citizens if they thought that they could hold out for a settlement.
If another decade (+!) of warfare is required, what will the damage to
the infrastructure be? Certainly all the off-world trade patterns will
be ruined, and Imperial funds for reconstruction would not be very likely
to be forthcoming.

  And even if much of the damage is repaired after a century, how likely
that the 3I would even think of allowing anything like a regional lobby
to re-emerge? The Party ruled for centuries in many cases - how do you
"de-nazify" that political culture*?

  * by taking a leaf from "1984", of course, but the 3I isn\'t supposed
to behave that way. I wonder how many private travellers were allowed
through in the first decade of the military occupation of Terra?

You could take a stab at it using the animal-design rules in First In.  I set 
those
up to parallel (and extend somewhat) the animal-design sequence in LBB 2.
If I remember right the Chamax "bugs" shouldn\'t be too hard to convert over.

ENGAGE DARK MATTER!

Charles Seife, Washington DC

"I\'M TRYING AS HARD AS I CAN, Captain," exclaims Scotty, the strain
etching lines in his forehead. "I can\'t give you any more!" But unlike
Star Trek\'s Enterprise, future spacecraft might use a less savoury
energy supply than Scotty\'s beloved dilithium crystals: human waste. 

NASA is enlisting the aid of Advanced Fuel Research of Connecticut
in a new $600 000 project to turn astronaut waste into a power source
for spaceships. The process might also yield other useful chemicals
that are in short supply aboard an interplanetary spacecraft or on an
extraterrestrial base. The secret is pyrolysis: breaking down the
waste by heating it in the absence of oxygen.

If it\'s moving away, you just figure how long it takes to reach the
same velocity (V=A*T). Then figure out how far you moved in that time
(D=.5*A*T^2). Calculate the *new* distance to it, and use the standard
formulas. 

If it\'s moving *towards* you it gets messier. 

If it\'s moving at an angle, break the velocity into a "sideways"
component, and a "towards/away" component. You have to boost sideways
long enogh to match the that vector. Then figure the rest normally from
that point. 

Or you can dig out the old vector movement rules, and "play out" the
rendezvous. 

I now have the formulas required to figure elliptical orbits, so I may
some day be able to get my "space simulator" program written. This
would let you try flying a spaceship around using real physics.
Complete with all the nasty "gotchas".

The pronouncement concerning TL maximums deals

competitions.  If you are designing a ship using 
GURPS, you will need to keep them in mind.

"You\'re on your own.  Good luck."

Actually, I figure that I\'ve been living on borrowed time since 1
January 1998 (in T:2K 2d edition, that was the date that the 82d linked
up with the 24th ID after jumping into northern Iran).  As an
airborne-qualified interrogator who speaks Arabic and Russian, I likely
would have gotten a mustard stain on that one.

ObTrav:  One could base a military campaign in the aftermath of a war
gone wrong, with no extraction available.

SANTA CLARA, California (AP) --
It almost sounds too futuristic to be true, but NASA and a

...said Michael Moshier, an aerospace engineer and former
Navy combat pilot who founded Millennium Jet Inc. "We have
all been dreaming of such a vehicle for many years, and
now the dream is becoming a reality." 

Moshier has spent more than three years and close to 
$1 million on his personal flying machine, which can be
seen on the company\'s Web site at www.solotrek.com. For
now, it looks like something out of a "Jetsons" cartoon. 

But officials at NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View,
California., said there\'s nothing funny about the SoloTrek 
Exo-Skeletor Flying Vehicle. Plans call for it to go up to 
80 mph, climb as high as 10,000 feet and get about 20 miles

All right, all right...I\'ve thought and thought, and canNOT figure out
what the heck \'getting a mustard stain\' means, am I just dense or not up

It\'s a slang term for special jump wings that denote a combat jump.  It
refers to the small bronze star in the middle of the suspension lines on
the parachute part of the jump wings.

ObTrav:  This can be used as an example of specialized slang in various
branches of the Imperial armed forces.

No, but I make a motion for creating a game system based on the popular TV
show "3rd Rock from the Sun". Who wants to be the Big Giant Head?

While I agree in general, I can see some ways to plausibly accept the data
at face value. Let us assume we\'ll keep Jenghe as the "mainworld", and
accept the rest of the population data as well. Sat 5 could have excessive
population because:

1) Jenghe started as the first colony, but discovered resources on Sat 5,
and many workers moved there for the better career ops. Sat 5 has a higher
population, but a less mature infrastructure.

2) Sat 5\'s population includes a large percentage of anyone or more of the
following: a) Prisoners in penal institutions. b) Scientists doing research.
c) Military personel on base. d) Exiled members of ousted regime from
earlier political coup. e) Members of another polity (extra-steller?)
working in a co-operative colonial effort. f) Quarantined victims of a
*highly* contagious disease.

These are the more serious ideas I had on reading your post. I had others,
such as Sat 5 has falsified their population report to grant their higher
tech droids recognition. Not very plausible, but sort of funny to me.

I just got LBB:6 to compare with First In, which I acquired earlier. It did
seem GG\'s were covered more thoroughly in FI, but I really like parts of
LBB:6 too. Does anyone else have both? Any thoughts on the comparative
merits/flaws of either? Ideas on hybridizing the two? And what system is WBH
for, and what does it cover? Besides the obvious, building worlds.

I love this idea, but if the "dump" is anything like the one in my county,
tough luck. The employees scavenge out the best and sell it out front to
supplement their pay. That is, what they don\'t take home. Thankfully, being
a long time local, I have many friends in the biz, and get "waste" goodie
all the time. Even got an old style amplifier/mixing head, with only one
channel out. But we use it! Most of the damage is external, and seems to
have been done /after/ it was discarded. This type of thing could throw Trav
chrs off, causing them to overlook the excellent yet out-of-date
technogoodie due to its battered casing.

I love it! This ship is not your Grandfather\'s Oldsmobile. Please do more
soon, I am sorry I have no technical advice on improving your results, but
Jesse will surely give you a clue or two. But I am thrilled with the spirit
of your work.

1 June 2000 is the day that the Soviet counterattack against the US XI
Corps and the Third German Army broke through. The US 5th Inf. Division
(Mech) was wiped out. Scattered small squad and platoon sized elements had
to try and fight their way back to Germany. Many of them didn\'t make it.
Some stayed behind. When Krakow became a free city some of these units
hired themselves out to local warlords or became warlords themselves.

But, I\'m boring you.

Crew Details
 Pilot (optional)

All those concerned with space travel know that it entails some inherant
risks. There are occassions where, despite the best efforts of crews and
manufacturers, a ship will be stricken by an emergency requiring the vessel
to be evacuated. Displacing only 3 Td, the Phoenix P-3PL embodies a radical
new approach to providing for emergency evacuation; and does so at a cost of
only MCr 1.647.

The Phoenix Corporation conducted excentive research into the circumstances
of over 2,000 emergency evacutations and found that the majority occured
within 100,000 km of a world. Armed with this data, the P-3PL design team
(headed by Sharik Uskaii) adopted an inovative solution the problems of
evacuating a crippled vessel. Rather than relying on tradional emergency low
berths, the P-3PL ulitises standard acceleration couches to transport up to
11 survivors. Not only does the use of couches confer considerable benefits
in terms of both cost and size; but it has considerable safety benefits. Not
only does it avoid the well known hazzards associated with suspended
animation, but it also greatly increases the speed of evacuation, and allows
the P-3PL to be deployed by compeletly untrained personnel. However, the
needs of a deep space evacuation have not been neglected. The P-3PL has
sufficent life support and power for up to 28 standard days. This provides
ample margin for all but the most unforseen circumstances (of all the cases
examined by Phoenix, only one would have required a greater endurance). 72
hours battery power is provided for the laser communicator and active sensor
suite, thereby minimising the drain on the main power.

The P-3PL uses an airframe hull, fully capable of atmospheric flight (either
with or without power); and it\'s fully automated systems allow for fully
autonomous operations. The P-3PL can be operated entirely without any human
intervention. However, no machine can ever replace the reactions and
instincts of a trained pilot and the P-3PL features a complete set of
controls for manual operation. Stringent testing by the Bureau of Starship
Safety, Health and Transit Standards has certified the P-3PL safe for fully
automated operations under emergency conditions (normal Imperial Starship
Regulations apply to routine operations).

The P-3PL offers an affordable and reliable emergency evacutation craft,
capable of performing under the most rigourous of conditions. The hull is
rated for up to 25Gs of stress and the P-3PL exceeds all existing safety
regulations by a wide margin. The P-3PL\'s powerful passive sensor suite
allows for potential rescue craft to be detected at up to 1.6 million km
distance, and it\'s laser communicator can beam a distress message directly
to the resuce craft utilising it\'s extensive battery power. The P-3PL can be
incorporated into new designs for Cr10,000 and retrofitted to existing
vessels for only Cr12,000. Alternatively, the P-3PL is designed to fit into
a standard 3Td turret hardpoint, allowing for it to be added to any existing
vessel at minimal cost.

As one of the people involved in the development of WBD, especially at
the time we developed the ESG side of things, I feel qualified to comment..
(note: my comments are not sanctioned by Stuart Ferris, or any others
involved in the development of WBD, and should not be regarded as \'official\',
just the truth in my own experience and opinion.)


here goes,

While on Page 20 of the MT Ref\'s Manual, the following appears,..

Section #2, Mainworld Determination after the fact.  (And this is the crux of it.)
"When this approach is used, the mainworld is the world in the system which 
has the greatest population. If more than one world has the same population,
then select the world which is in the habitable zone, or failing that, which is 
closest to the central star.

The mainworld need not be a planet; it can be a satellite or an asteroid belt, or 
a small world. It may not, however, be a ring.

The mainworld need not orbit the central star in the system; it may be in orbit 
around the binary companion, or it may orbit a gas giant or other world."


Now, look at MT Ref\'s Manual, p18 col. 1, (penultimate para.)....
"The mainworld within a system is the single most important planet or satellite
in the system; *most often* the world with the greatest population, the dominant
local government type, and the star system\'s starport."


In the other sections, (Extended System Generation), there is no ruling that I
can find (see below), for the cutting off of population to the maximum of the system.
Since MT is the rules system that Stuart decided on, and it is the system he had
to hand, the program was developed to those rules.

I am perfectly happy with higher populations than the mainworld, and it can be expla-
ined by the ideas put forward by previous posters and a bit of imagination from the
GM. If it is a real problem, then sorry, no can help, unless Stuart wants to apply it.


Comments re Gas Giant UPP codes. The B & C sizes are not official, but easier
to store in a one character text variable than LGG or SGG. Maybe it should be
pointed out in a help file, but then again, there isn\'t really one about.... (ducks
for cover before Stuart starts dishing out work again...)


On a final note, although discussion of WBD is welcomed on the TML, since it
advertises the product for Stuart, there is an alternative medium. The WBD Mailing
list is set up on OneList  <WBDMailingList@onelist.com> this is a specialised
discussion forum for WBD, and I would suggest using that for specifics of the
software. There are a few of us who regularly discuss the development of the
software on another list, and there hasn\'t been a great deal of traffic on WBD
Mailing List, but I know for one, I\'ll always answer any questions there, rather than
taking up space on the TML which should be reserved for discussions about pirates
in comfortable shoes et alia ;-)


Sorry to be long winded,

Note:
I know that in Scouts (Book 6, Page 36, 1st section, last para.), there is the ruling
that : "If using the continuation system, then population which exceeds that of the
mainworld must be reduced to one less than that of the mainworld." As far as I\'m
aware, Stuart didn\'t have Scouts (otherwise we\'d have Bolometric magnitudes and 
effective stellar temperatures in there).

One futher idea that I\'ve used is the major class distinction angle.
Jenghe is the main world, long since given over to a lower, but
wealthier population of "haves" while Sat 5, once a colony, has become
the residence of the "have-nots" and is the manufactoring, mining, etc.
center of the system. Jenghe is concidered the main world since it is
where the "govenment" resides.

I don\'t know about you, but I am REALLY getting sick of these losers and
their stupid threats.  I can sometimes see why people go on shooting
rampages.  Unfortunately, they shoot the wrong people.  Why don\'t the idiots
ever get it?

Well, remove the weenie then! Call the bluff! And if it isn\'t a bluff, I am
sure there are folks on the list (lurkers especially) who can return the
favor. Or one-up the twerp. I was ignoring it as high silliness, but a

Careful, I am beginning to look at this as a personal threat, Skinmonkey.
Your first couple posts were amusing, leave it at that. Continue and you may
learn of the wrath of an Arcadian Noble. This is not a threat, just a
statement of how far I can be pushed before losing my cool. People should be
nice to one another. I\'ve been nice. Follow my example.

Actually, I doubt you\'d see "dumps" much beyond TL-8 or 9. The
*materials* in "garbage" become to valuable, especially on airless
worlds or worlds with atmmospheres that can\'t be breathed without aid.

Recycling will be "normal". So whether it\'s breaking things down into
raw materials, or re-using "old" subassemblies (ie cases and card from
those PCs), you won\'t see a lot of "trash" lying around.

Even if you restrict this attitude to the worlds that don\'t have
"shirtsleeve" environments, it has some nice hooks for play:

1. PC for a "shirtsleeve world gets arrested/ticketed for "improper
   disposal". Maybe he tossed metal trash in the organic trash bin.
   Maybe he dumped food trash in something other than the "compostable"
   bin. You get the idea. And remember, this applies to ship\'s trash as
   well. It\'ll need to be seperated properly *or* pay the extra fees
   (fines) for not being seperated.

2. PC (or NPC) from a "non-shirtsleeve" world keeps driving the other
   characters nuts by being so "picky" about environmental maintenance,
   trash disposal, recycling, etc.

3. Contracts to haul stuff not easily recyclable on world to world
   where it can be. This could be something simple like stuff made from
   "exotic" composite materials. Or it could be "hazardous waste". If
   the players don\'t ask enough questions they could be sorry.

4. Hauling "recycled" equipment/components. This would be the
   equivalent of that "dig the low TL gear out of the high-TL trash"
   scenario above. Except that there are probably people or companies
   that make a living by hauling off "obsolete" gear, stripping out the
   usable assemblies (which in some cases could be the entre unit) and
   tacking them for sale offworld. Essentially, the return of of the
   "junkman" job, except higher tech. The players may wind up hauling
   tons of auto parts. Or lower TL computer parts.

5. hauling "low value" recyclables to places where they can be recycled
   at higher prices. For example, there\'s a "window" from about TL 6 or
   7 to TL 9 ot 10 (guessestimate) where iron and steel are only
   recyclable if they are free most "contaminants *such as other
   metals).  This is because the "new" steel making processes are
   sensitive to impurities.  So stuff like "crushed car bodies" isn\'t
   worth much (that\'s why there are *reefs* made of old car bodies in
   some places).  But at lower TL worlds, "iron is iron", And they\'ll
   pay well for this "junk".
	Given starship load limits, I\'d expect such "scrap" cargos to
   *not* be crushed, because the buyers will pay more if they can get
   at things like wiring to get the copper. At *their* tech level, it\'s
   cost effective to pay people to strip that sort of thing out by
   hand. So you\'d have an old car frame stuffed with old refrigerator
   and washer/dryer carcasses, stuffed with other sheetmetal cases. And
   this will sell well at TL 5 and below. Clear down to early iron age
   cultures. After all, just consider what a medieval smith would pay
   for that much iron, with the copper wiring as a bonus (once his
   apprentices strip it out).

Shouldn\'t this creature\'s parents be admonished? It can\'t capitalize, form

this is the future of the human species, Traveller is a fantasy game. Well,
I always thought that anyways. I doubt Skinmonkeys will ever leave their

>Why? They don\'t speak Arabic in Iran. They speak Farsi.


Well, some people certainly do, but not many! Gulf Spoken Arabic has an
estimated 200,000 speakers in Iran, and Mesopotamian Spoken Arabic has
1,200,000 speakers. They\'re in the minority though. In \'93 about 25,300,000
(just a smidge over 50%) of the population spoke Farsi, the national
language.

Derrick Jones\' take on the subject is 100% correct, WBD is based on MT
rules.

The rules for extended system generation state:-

33 Population

Roll 2d-2 for Population. If inner zone, DM-5. If outer zone, DM-3.

and;

39 Satellite Population

Roll 2d-2 for Population. If inner zone, DM-5. If outer zone, DM-4. If size
0-4, DM-2. If size R, Population is 0. If Atmosphere is not 5, 6, or 8,
DM-2.

Both these equations could create a subordinate population which is greater
than the base/mainworld. population.

However, I do agree that it makes perfect sense for subordinate worlds and
satellites to have a population less than the mainworld.

I am presently working on a new version of WBD which will streamline the
program. I plan to provide support for MT, TNE, T4 & GURPS. I don\'t have the
appropriate CT rules, but if someone provides me with extracts from the
relevant books I will be happy to look into incorporating them into the
program.

I am keen to get everyone\'s input on the existing system and world
generation rules. Anyone interested should join the WBD Mailing List at:-

Leonard, you\'re expecting the Army to make sense.  Some G-1 clerk would
have looked as his file,muttered that he had found the required speaker of
"raghead" and sent him on his merry way!

No, dumbass, what I will do is sue your ISP.  They will roll over and give
me your real name and address to avoid paying heavy penalties.  Then I will
see just how big and brave you are in person.

anybody tear apart his headers for more information yet?

Sort of.. it\'s not at all canon, and IMHO not very good, but if you\'re a
collector it\'s worth three bucks.

I\'ve never paid much attention to the little pocket organizers.

My games are seldom set in the "normal" Traveller universe, and when
it comes to mixing rules...hee!  There are quite a few Traveller

Unfortunately the old Traveller writers didn\'t always bother to reality-
check their cool ideas (nor current ones for that matter; _GURPS Star
Mercs_ has Grote, and Imperial border world with a total population of
3,100 people (workers AND dependents) running a shipyard capable of
building at least three 600 T warships simultaneously. In order to make
a nice scenario, they leave these three multi-million credit ships,
representing the total GWP of Grote for many years, standing around
with only a few militia squads for protection.)

I\'d sign up for it.  Speaking of which... Jesse, I still haven\'t
snagged my own copy of Lightwave yet, but I\'m making do with my
existing tools.  I\'ve finally posted something.

Yes!  It\'s an old Paranoia Press supplement for Zhodani Intelligence!
Published back in the Cold War days when the Soviet Union was the Evil 
Empire and was represented in Traveller as the Zhodani.

Now days we know that Starbucks in the new Evil Empire, and are represented 
in Traveller as the megacorporation of your choice.

Then, of course, we have the question:

What would a medieval smith have that would be of value to a starship?
Unless that smith\'s world is quite metal-poor, I\'m wondering if any trade
goods he offers the starship crew would be better spent building a mine
and paying people to dig, refine, and transport the iron locally.

I realize the iron was essentially free to the Starship captain, but there
will be transport costs that must be made up.

Now, if the medieval smith makes tools for all the wandering nomads
who are the only ones able to harvest the widely-dispersed plants
that provide a unique pharmaceutical when processed offworld, and thus
this smith\'s warehouse is the *only* place on-planet where you can
find the seeds of this plant in bushel quantites, rather than a few seeds
at a time...

Bring him some iron. And an air-raft. And a dozen bodyguards with
laser rifles and combat armor. And a big pile of off-world luxury goods.
And keep bringing these things until your local trade representative can
make a nice deal with the nomad chiefs...at which point, the smith
will get a sudden reminder that his laser-armed bodyguards aren\'t
working for him, they\'re working for *you*.

Merchant campaigns are more fun when they\'re more than just loading
cargo and paying crew salaries, but we knew that already... ;-)

It\'s a trifle more complex than that:

For weapons with an output over 1,000,000 kJ, you now substitute [10 X
(cube root of O)] for (square root of O).

Which reminds me that I have a slew of spinal mounts to redo.  Honest,

How about Imperial Legions?  Sounds a little more Roman, which might be a
bad thing (confusion with Imperial Rome, for example), but it\'s a little
smoother.  All IMO.  

Or maybe Sword and Shield.  This plays off the Regency sourcebook, which
uses "Sword" to allude to the Imperial Marines and "Shield" for the Army.

BTW: nice shooting on Ukkie.

     In the early 14th century, Franciscan missionary Friar Odoric
     brought to Europe the story of an enormous carriage that carried
     an image of the Hindu god Vishnu (whose title was "Jagannath,"
     literally, "lord of the world") through the streets of India in
     religious processions. Odoric reported that some worshipers
     deliberately allowed themselves to be crushed beneath the
     vehicle\'s wheels as a sacrifice to Vishnu. That story was
     probably an exaggeration or misinterpretation of actual events,
     but it spread throughout Europe anyway. The tale caught the
     imagination of English listeners, and by the 19th century, they
     were using "juggernaut" to refer to any massive vehicle (such as
     a steam locomotive) or to any other enormous entity with powerful
     crushing capabilities.

No, it wasn\'t really that much of an exaggeration. In the town of Puri, in
India, there is an yearly festival, which is pretty well documented. At
different points in history pilgrims would throw themselves under the
wheels.

It makes sense, although I doubt that English "listeners" kept the tale
alive from the 14th to the 19th century. It\'s more likely that in the 19th
century, the tale was re-popularized, or Puri itself was discovered by the
English. The word pops up in print for the first time in 1841 (although the
dictionary I\'m using unfortunately doesn\'t site the publication). I suspect
that it would have popped up in print earlier if it was kept alive in the
English imagination... add to that the 19th century fascination the British
had with India and the Orient in general, and the picture becomes a little
clearer.

I recently rebuilt my Trav collection (the originals were all lost to a fire
back in \'88), and on \'new\' books I overpaid for on eBay <smirk> was GDW\'s
Imperial Atlas.  I bit of a dissapointment, but I apparently have more money
than sense - no buyer\'s remorse here.  : )

The one really useful thing here for Year 0 aficionados is that all the
orginal Sylean Federation systems are marked with a SY designation.  Whoop!
According to the IA, Core 2729 is 14 parsecs away from the nearest Sylean
worlds: either 2118 (Capital) or 3117.  These are the coordinates used in
the old Imperial Atlas, circa 1984.  2729 is listed as an unnamed desert
world with a Class B starport.  For what its worth.

I don\'t know of any other references, and I\'m not holding my breath, but if
anyone does know of something, I\'d also be very interested in it.

I vote for Imperial Legions.
After all, Rome set the standards (roughly) for the last 2000 years as
exemplar for the relative efficencies of empire. Not neccesarily the
most compassionate or humanitarian form of rule, though.

Besides, Imperial Legions sounds much cooler.

You can save "Emperor\'s Regiments" for a source book
 or have the members of the list create it for you from their own
collections.
Lord knows, I\'ve created many units for a variety of purposes in the last
X years.

Well, I\'m not a physicist (nor do I play one on TV), but I would invoke
pseudoscience and point out that, on average, they spend as much time
decelerating as accelerating.  If they jump out with a high velocity,
they have to decelerate to match the system\'s relative velocity.  This
should cancel out any noticeable temporal effects of their acceleration
on the way out.

Bottom line:  What you gain on one end of a jump, you lose on the other
end.

It may not be entirely accurate, but it _is_ reasonably plausible, and
it\'s eminently playable.

I agree that Sword and Shield sounds right, but SJG would have to go for it
too I guess... as it does sound like a fantasy supp?

Yes, without seeing the book, the first time I heard the title, I thought it
might be a SpecOps supp or adventure, and it entirely makes sense in a
Traveller title!

I like the addition of the bump map.  There\'s a couple of improvement areas
that would make it even greater.
1.Streaks should come from all of the lines, not just some.
2.Streaks should be toned down a bit, unless you\'re representing a very old
ship.
3.Try useing multiple earth tones for the burn mapping.  Look at the
mini-tutorial on hulls that I have at my site (under tutorial & object links
area) to see what I use.
4.The wings & fins at the rear need to have their geometry smoothed out or
multiplied to smooth out the shape a bit.

Keep it up!!!!!

It\'s not *worth* getting into that. Consider what all those luxury goods
(which the locals may not even be *interested* in) cost. And the cost
of the air raft and weapons are even worse. Plus, the get you *way* too
involved in local politics. 

You might be interested in what variuous "handmade" items can bring
from collectors. A suit of plate armor is worth *thousands* of dollars.

Sure, but it\'s much simpler to find something cheap that can be traded
for local currency, which can then be paid for whatever local goods you
can make a profit from. 

Both the things of value to the locals, and those you can make a profit
on can be *very* strange. 

But as I noted above *don\'t* count on "luxury" items being of value to
natives. Their tastes can be *very* different, even if they are human.
Consider things like cheese (which is considered "spoiled milk" by one
of the largest cultural groups on earth), "well-aged eggs" (considered
a delicacy by that same group), kumiss (fermented mare\'s milk).

What constitutes a "luxury" item is *very* culture dependent.

    'body' => 'I\'ve my own questions for this list regarding Milieu 0 references.  Most of
these questions probably don\'t have \'official\' answers, and are really just
a bitch-list, but I do welcome speculation, opinions, or other comments.  I
remember when I signed off this list back when IG published First Survey,
there was quite a bit of grousing about how crappy it was, so this may be
old hat for some.  :)

Although Milieu 0 was generally an excellent book (IMHO), it lacked a lot of
useful specifics, especially when referring to certain worlds or political
boundaries.  Perhaps some of this was updated in the Milieu 0 Campaign
hardcover?   Specific references include (page numbers are from my original
softcover edition):

Chanestin Kingdom (p. 9) - an interesting war of conquest takes place with
this political entity during the formation of the 3I.  All we are told is
that it is located in the rimward subsector O-Dunea, and has its capital on
a world called Keshi.  First Survey does list Keshi at Core 1938, a rather
modest low pop, tech 7 world.  Of course, it also lists a Keshi at 0816 - go
figure.  The Atlas of the Imperium confirms a Keshi at 1938, listing it as
hi-pop.  No other details.

Interstellar Confederacy, a.k.a. the Great Spiral (p. 10) - a long, detailed
war is described with the Confederacy, which occupied 32 worlds in two
spinward subsectors (I-Bunkeria and J-Cemplas).  Specific world names used
in the history of this war include Marsus, Protalus, and Sketola - these are
the main worlds of the Confederacy, and all are listed in both atlases.
There are a lot of other world names cited, some of which I can find entries
for, and some I can\'t.  Better than poke in the eye with a sharp cattleprod,
I suppose.  :P

Pholishie (p. 22) - I love the Things that Have Gone Wrong section of the
\'School of Contact\'!  This is a wonderful rogue world "well out into the
Fringe" - not so much as a sector name.  I\'m not manually searching the
entire freakin\' First Survey for this name.  I intend to import the best
sector data listings I can find into a database so I can run some real SQL
queries against it for names like this.  I\'m betting I\'ll have to
arbitrarily place this one somewhere on my own.

Santry-Cordova Cluster (p. 23) - a real cluster #&$@!, if you ask me.  A
neat story about warring states encountered by the Imperium, with no
location given.  Except, of course, that First Survey lists Santry (Core
1736) and Cordova (Core 1836) as adjacent worlds in the Dunea subsector.
This puts them smack up against the Chanestin, whose capital is only 2
parsecs away from Cordova.  Yet the Scouts only contacted them in -16,
despite having been at war with the Chanestin since -107.  Doh!  The entire
description of both the history and the war belies the astrography.  Gonna
have to completely relocate/rename this entity elsewhere.

Yabean & Voy (p. 34) - both are worlds described as suffering planetary
assaults from Imperial Marines during the M:0 era.  Voy is apparently the
homeworld of a minor race (the Voyle).  No bells ringing here.  Anyone got a
line on either of these?

These are the most interesting references.

Also (pre-IG/M:0 map data):

I\'m looking at the Missouri Archive
(http://www.mu.org/~joe/traveller/archive/), and seeing three sets of sector
files.

- - The \'sectors\' folder contains 35 .sec files and 1 .vmb file.
- - The \'old_sectors\' folder contains 24 .txt files.
- - The \'sector.dgp\' folder contains 26 non-extensioned files, 35 .sec files,
and 2 .vmb files.

I\'ve also downloaded Bruce Johnson\'s .zip archive (linked in the TML FAQ)
which contains 32 sector files described as the "fabled Genie (DGP) sector
data".  :P

All of these are text files that appear to follow approximately the same
format.  Is there anything useful anyone can tell me about these file sets?
Are these basically all the same data, or are there significant variations?

There have been mentions of an errata corrected version of the First Survey
data for Core only, but I haven\'t found an URL yet.  What\'s the story on
that?

Lastly, there was an allusion many months ago on the list to the infamous
Law Level data snafu being the result of a bug in software IG used to
\'retrograde\' the existing sector data.  Fact?  Rumor?  Any idea what kind of
algorithm was being used to transform the data?

What kind of algorithm would YOU use to turn back the clock on the Third
Imperium?

From what I\'ve been able to calculate, there isn\'t a whole lot of time
dialation involved in interplanetary travel in Traveller, since you never
get anywhere even close to 0.1C.

BEOWULF DOWN OPENS
=======================
This is to announce the opening of Beowulf Down starport! Phase 1 is now
complete, and all travellers are welcome to visit our upgraded facilities
at Tavonni.

Tavonni is host to a number of unique resources. Traveller Library Data may
be accessed from the starport, for example. A number of specialist
companies also reside on-planet, including trendi (missiles, robots,
vehicles, and other equipment) and Lone Scout Enterprises (starships).
Another facility, the Traveller Jump Points depature lounge, is also
accessable but not due for a complete update until Phase 2. Finally, the
Maintenance and Repair facility holds a number of [game rules & background]
articles.

Beowulf Down is the homeport of Tavonni (Vilis/Spinward Marches 1520),
located near the astrographic centre of the Marches. Until recently, it has
been operating as a class-C (G:T III) starport under the moniker of
"Hyphen\'s Main Directory", a somewhat less-than-obvious title. The \'port
has been completely rebuilt, now operating as a class-B (G:T IV) facility.

Palm OS organisers run using 68000\'s (IIRC) with a starting 2Mb RAM now
(mine has 1Mb).

This is at least as good as an Amiga or an ST, and the interface is very
Mac like.

Not toys.

Have they gone past the toy stage to actually become useful for
getting anything done?<

IMHO, yes. I think this because...

1. For the past two years I have been running all \'away\' games
   [ones not at my house] off a palmtop. Character sheets,
   background and rules files, dice rollers. I still find it
   necessary to have the charsheets and maps in hardcopy,
   because the players prefer that [and most don\'t have
   compatible palmtops].

   However, I run \'rules-light\' games, if you wanted to use
   full TNE for example I don\'t think it would work so well.

2. The Aslan half of GT AR2 was written exclusively on a
   Psion 3c, mostly while I was commuting to work.

3. With the exception of giving presentations to clients, I can
   do my whole job with a palmtop, and would, if the company
   didn\'t already provide me a laptop. But then, I\'m a PHB rather
   than a Dilbert these days. :)

   And that approach would probably involve fewer visits to the
   chiropractor to get my back straightened out.

My guess would be pick your year, preferably before IE 50.
TLWH refers to the Sylean Scout Corp (misspelling for Corps?)
but according to M:0 (p 26) Jump-3 scouts were not in use before
IE -10. When Cleon declared the empire in IE 0,  the Sylean
Federation Scout Service (SFSS) was renamed as the InterstelLar
Imperial Scout Service (IISS).

   The M:0 text and map are inconsistent. The references in the
text are written with reference to the placement of the Sylean
Federation as in the T4 main rulebook, NOT in the M:0 Referee
data for Core sector. 
   For instance, the famous encounter with Cleon\'s new fighters
and the pirates could not possibly have been at the M:0 Referee
data\'s Core 0202 Azimuth, some six months away from Sylea at
Jump-2.  Instead, the T4 version must be the one referenced.
Arlea (T4\'s core 0101) is not to be found in Referee data. The
Chanestin Kingdom is given in the text as 1 sector rimward of
Sylea: but the map has Keshi/Dunea as two sectors away. The text
(p 93) mentions 21 worlds as belonging to the Federation in -110,
but referree data gives only 19, three of those uninhabited.
Shudusham is mentioned as a "Sylean" industrial world during the
Second Chanestin war (-25 IE, M:0 p 10), and the Shudusham
Concords restricting weaponry carried by robots were signed there
in -110 IE. (M:0 p 93), it is listed as a "neutral" world, M:0
does not list it as a member. The text suggests in several places
a Federation significantly larger than the Referee data suggests,
but gives few details.
   Given the inconsistencies within canon, feel free to make up
your own answers. IMTU, I have: 
1)  Gaar is indeed an active member of the Federation. Its
membership dates to the First Chanestin war. Although it is
economically and militarily insignificant, its position in the
Chanestin sphere of influence makes it the Sylean-Chanestin
version of Cuba. 
2) The (in)famous Fusion+ v. pirates encounter actually took
place at 1822 Anka Ke.  
3) Arlea is not a mainworld but a moon or continent on Sylea or a
nearby world. (I haven\'t placed it exactly)
4) The "Sylean Federation" notes in M:0 Referee data refer to worlds having
full membership at the beginning of Cleon\'s campaign in -30. The SF\'s
sphere of influence was considerably greater, and included several worlds
that were at various stages of incorporation into the Federation
(as suggested by the Pocket Empires supplement), but not yet full
members.  Shudusham is among the closest of these to full
membership.  
5) "Full data" implies that a world has been surveyed by the
earlier scout agencies and that some official Sylean presence is
there. However, many other worlds should also be noted at "full
data" (which they are is at referee\'s discretion).

    References to worlds in or near Core(Sylene) subsector in
adventures published for T4 include 1812 Khiidkar, (Missions of
State Ch. 8), 1921 Medishvlaas (Anomalies Ch. 2), 2916 Khiinra
Ash (Anomalies ch 3), 2111 Kiikagaiir (Anomalies ch 4), 1124
Imkhasham (Anomalies ch 7).
    A week or two ago I posted a list of trade links within the
subsector which I recently derived for MTU based on the rules in
GURPS Traveller Far Trader. It\'s not complete yet since it
doesn\'t include the links to industrial worlds in neigboring
sectors, but it\'s a start. I gave Dom Mooney conditional
permission to post a map based on it on the BITS web site, but it
might not have made it up yet. If it\'s not up yet or you missed
it, I can send you a copy of what I gave.

The hardcover adds several new chapters: 
9. Timeline and significant events for the first 200 years of the
Imperium, with charts for expansion of the Imperium for the first
200 years, by sector.
10 Rivals of the Young third Imperium (Significant Pocket

11. Adventures in M:0 
12. Worlds in M:0. This allows for giving more detail to the
Size, Hydrosphere, & Population of the UWP, and tries to cover
First survey\'s mistake in making the law level and government
code the same by creating an Extended Law Profile. The ELP is a
nice addition to the rules in any case.

Some historians divide the Chanestin war into the First Chanestin
War and the Second Chanestin war.  The First Chanestin War begain
in IE -107 and ended with the peace treaty of IE -44. The Second
Chanestin war began with the attack on Shudusham in IE -25 and
ended with the conquest of Keshi in IE 2. I thought of
considering the Santry/Cordova war as a part of Chanestin War II,
but they\'re too close; it just doesn\'t work. I agree with
relocate/rename.

Yes, there is such a thing. A couple of months ago I spent an hour or so
searching Traveller pages and finally found it and downloaded a copy. I
think you can find it a jump or two away from Freelance Traveller, but
that\'s all remember about where it is. The list has law levels
different from the government code in most cases, and apart from
that about one UWP in a dozen any different from First Survey.

My bad.  I thought it was located herein, but I stand corrected.

This must be where I picked up that mental limitation on my system 
generation routines, and carried it over into MT so long ago.  My 
bad.  Well, since it\'s in CT but not in MT/WBD, I\'m cool with leaving 
the generation of worlds as it is.  Yay!

I have just finished running both of those and I found the lack of 
dating a problem.  I suspect it is supposed to be run in Year 200.  
However, running it then with the current state of exploration tends to 
put the Imperium a little closer than is indicated in the adventures.  
So I started the game in year 50 ... and consolidated the Imperium 
somewhat.  Instead of being sparsely spread all over the place, it is 
more concentrated in Core and the closer half of all adjoining 
sectors.

I never found any definitive works.  That doesn\'t mean it\'s not out 
there, though.

> Does "Full Data" automatically imply contact?

I assumed Yes.  As a recommendation (and I am not trying to push 
my program), I suggest you download my Astrogator 4 program.  I 
have all the M0 systems in the DB and the systems in 3I (and some 
of the pocket empires) are marked.  You can then see what worlds I 
considered part of the Imperium.  They also have the corrected 
system information available.

There is a major flaw/oversight in some of the assumptions in these 
adventure modules.  Drop me a line if you are interested, as I don\'t 
want to give away any clues to potential players.  My players found 
the problem and I was scrambling the rest of the scenarios to try 
and keep if from shortcutting the adventures.

You also might want to consider giving them the ship in the back of 
the modules.  Anything larger makes the players a bit cocky.

I hope you have fun with these adventures.  With a little work, they 
turn out to be really good starting points for an entire game.  My 
players enjoyed the six months it took to play them out.  Well, worth 
the money ... IMO.

Wouldn\'t the time that passes inside a quickly moving object compared to the

I = O * sqrt(1- (v squared / c squared))

If you use c as "1", and v as some percentage of c, all you should need is a 
calculator that can do a square root and multiplication.

so if 10 hours happened in the "outside" reference, with someone travelling 
at 30% speed of light, you end up with about 9.5 hours "inside".

Now if you happen to be going 70% of the speed of light, you end up with just 
over 7 hours for ever 10 that passes outside.

Good luck, everybody!

"...The shape of HSX is certainly its signature and the key to its unique

helical twists and turns girdled by thick coils of copper magnets. The
device
will confine plasmas in a magnetic field, while generating temperatures of
up to 10 million degrees.

HSX combines elements of two existing styles of plasma containment
experiments known as tokamaks and stellarators. Tokamaks have
achieved the best results to date, but they also require a strong current in
the plasma itself. Stellarators don\'t need that current, making them
potentially more attractive as power reactors.

But they don\'t produce the high-quality magnetic field that confines plasmas
to reach higher temperatues. 

HSX solves that problem by achieving symmetry in the magnetic field
through its oddly-shaped and complex magnet coils. The plasma-confining
energy is located in coils outside of the plasma itself, making it more
stable
and attractive as a reactor..."

How about "Holding The High Ground" or "Holding the Line"?

"Imperial Legions" seems to limit the focus to only Imperial forces and
can lead to the assumption that non-Imperial forces (provincial forces,
Sword Worlds, Zho, alien, etc.) will be covered in additional publications.

Then, again, if this is, in fact, what\'s going to happen then "Imperial
Legions" fits the bill rather nicely.

There\'s also "Armor and Blood: Ground Forces of the Iridium Throne". This
would
allow inclusion of provincial forces used within the Imperium.

Or "Hit The Dirt". (as in taking cover, assaulting from orbit, etc.)

Or "The Iridium Hammer".

Or "Taking The High Ground".

This is indeed the case.  The focus is almost entirely the Imperial forces.
 I will be doing short sections on the majot threats faced by the IA/IM in
the Marches, but nothing major.

"Imperial Legions".. has a nice ring to it.

"High Ground" sounds a  bit  too  close  to  "High  Guard"  which
suggests a Naval book.  Ditto for "Line" (as  in  \'ships  of  the

My suggestions are ...

"GT: Rolling Thunder"

IMTU, crews just know "about 168 hours", until a few minutes (or even
seconds) before jump exit. Just before jump exit, certain energy fluxes
can be read from the jump drives that indicate imminent jump exit.
The warning could be as long as ten minutes or so, but is usually
three to five - in some rare cases, the warning could be five or ten
seconds.

Thus the deck watch keeps a special eye out starting a shift before
the 168 hour mark. 100 diameters is pretty empty space, but you
still want to be ready to dodge when you come out of jumpspace,
just in case.

Though I never used it in a game, I considered having the "Jumpspace
exit alert" come on at a strange time as a symptom of a misjump.
The crew perks up at watchstands when they see the energy flux,
but minutes go by and nothing happens..then a few days go by and
nothing else happens.

The following is all IMTU;

Yes, but that\'s all part of the jump-plotting process and good astrogators
get it right more often. The calculations before penetration give an an
indication of zero hour (there\'s a fair amount of implication that crews
have an idea of when they\'ll emerge but it isn\'t always accurate). A good
pilot will be able to drop the ship onto the hundred-diameters limit and
tell you the radial from the world and a time to within ten minutes. I
normally allow a couple of minutes warning before actual precipitation,
characteristic energy fluctuations etc.

In the same way, good astrogators can hold a fleet together through jump -
poor astrogators may scatter their ship off the arrival point/time.

apart from the JTAS article on the Dynchia, no.  It\'d make an interesting

If you read the bit on my Website about "The Tender" you\'ll note that
the computer upgrade for the ship was by Strange Trip Industries... ;-)

yeah, but when I did that, it started looking more like a zebra than a

Probably why it looked like a Zebra.

I did! it\'s just I think I\'m doing the texture map on too small a scale,
so they all look black.

Yeah. This didn\'t _quite_ turn out right.

Well, I\'ll work on it. My _next_ project is the fabled \'Mae Lee\', of

Thanks!

IN regards lighting in starships, a generous soul on the Strata mailing
list just posted an excellent tutorial about constructing a model of the
USS Enterprise (from ST:TNG, The \'D\' version), primarily aimed at the
animation woes he faced and how he solved them, but there\'s a lot of
useful stuff in there, even for Traveller Art folk ;-) The lighting on
my next ship is certainly going to be better!

and if in the imperium,  pray that the IN and IISS don\'t find out... There

Beyond the strong potential for confusion with Rome, there isn\'t an
organizational level called "Legion" in the Imperial force structure.

That\'s not bad, though again you might end up fostering confusion with
fantasy RPG.  I\'m reminded of the old GDW game "Boots & Saddles", which I
could never get myself to remember was about air cav, not *cav* cav. :) 

How about "Iron Fist" or "By Other Means", both suggesting their role in
the Imperial political structure?

He was a sharpshooter in the service, after all, as was our father.  For
some reason, this genetic legacy has conspicuously avoided me.  Give me a
weapon, and "range safety" becomes an oxymoron.

Sadly, the BITS printing of \'The Long Way Home\' (published by IG as \'Long
Way Home\' and \'Gateway\') is now out of print. We\'re not ruling out
reprinting but it is unlikely to be in the near future (the IG material is
still in distribution and the costs of publishing it are higher than
getting 101 size books out).

At present we are focussing on our new Adventure books (_The Khiidkar
Incident_ and _SpaceDogs_ are the first two examples) and getting the new
101 out (101 Patrons - now edited down).

However, TKI and SD are both compatible with M0 (and were originally
written for that setting). They\'ve since been made more generic and
GURPSified (main stats are GT/T4, with notes for other editions of
Traveller).

I have passed this on to Andy Lilly (the co-author) for a definative
answer. But as an aside (1) most IG material initially assumed a date
around 20-30 Imperial (this later changed) and (2) BITS/CORE products were
usually written to be flexible about this. I suspect 20 Imperial would be a
good bet, but it could be set anytime within M0 so long as Gushemege had
not been invested by the Imperials.

Two answers -

- -The map seldom ties to the reality of the text. I would take the text as
guidance and remember that in Yr 0 there were 13 systems objecting to the
formation of the Imperium (7 of which withdrew). The nacent Imperium had
also absorbed the Chanestin Kingdom (falls yr 22 p10) which had 25 members
at its height, plus the bulk of the Interstellar  Confederacy (totally
absorbed by Yr 5, collapsed in Yr -1, p11). It is also mentioned that most
of Core has been incorporated (can\'t find ref but it is in M0) by Yr 0.

- - The map represents the state of play at -25 or so. There is a rapid
expansion as the Chanestin and IC wars happen. Gaar may be a political ally
initially (a staging post for attacks only a subsector from the Chanestin
capital).

I would assume that \'Full data\' means that scouts have visited recently,
and trade almost certainly ocurs.
There is no real solid data...

1938 is the correct one. It meets the 25 worlds in 5 parsecs test. 0816 is
in Interstellar Confederacy territory and isn\'t in a cluster... I would
assume (and I think that this was the TML conclusion) that Keshi was
ultimately hit with nasties by the Imperium, smashing its infrastructure
down 4 tech levels. If the data is -25 this is a problem, but it could be
later data.

I tried to locate them all, but suffered. I had a load of notes, which I

Yes. I believe Jo Grant used a world from his campaign. The Fringe is way
past Core Sector in M0...

See other post. The Core 1530 cluster is the best bet.

AFAIK you are correct. An adaption of the TNE Collapse process was used
(IIRC) For what it\'s worth, I believe the M0 writers were working off the
Atlas of the Imperium and early drafts of the data...

Not necessarily a mispelling; it could just be English English not American

If I get everything together it should go up tonight... I am interested in
it because I am thinking of developing some of the material which I wrote
for \'At the Cross Roads\' into a subsector sourcebook..

"Ukkie" sounds 13-14. Spend some time watching young adolescents on their
own (or where they figure any authority can\'t ID them) and you\'ll see the
same type of behaviour.

Mind you, I pegged Clif at 16, too, so I\'m not infallible. Some adolescents
just don\'t grow up :-(

Agreed, these kinds of tactics should make the IISS quite testy,

Some Christians in the Phillipines crucify themselves in a festival. (Which

my translator didn\'t want to talk about it much.)

Actually, this one hasn\'t been discussed very much, so it\'s a fresh newish
horse. :)

Probably not.  Two useful factoids to remember for quick qualitative
judgements on relativity are:

1) A g-year equals c.
2) Relativity doesn\'t make a big difference below 0.5 c.

In other words, one years\' sustained acceleration at 1 g results --
*ignoring relativity* -- in a velocity quite near c.  This is useful
because it can be used to derive other, more game-relevant figures using
simple multiplication and division.  For example, a week (1/52 of a year)
at 1g get you up to roughly 0.02 c; a day at 6 g gets you to (6/365)  or
about 1/60 c.  Note that even at 6g (the highest sustained acceleration
you\'re likely to have available on a crewed ship in Traveller), it takes a
month of acceleration to reach 0.5 c, where relativistic effects start to
be really noticeable.  Since most runs will be far briefer (one or two
days) and hence stay at much lower speeds, relativity can safely be
ignored in-game unless the characters do some truly unusual normal-space
travelling.

I think those are "British" Gurkhas - there are 270 in Interfet. I don\'t know
if Australia also maintains a Gurkha force - India certainly does.

And 30 British Special Boat Squadron troops (probably) have gone in as well.

	IMTU the timing can usually be predicted within a few minutes

Sorry, incorrect.  General relativity shows that acceleration (or
equivalently, being in a gravity field) also causes time dilation,
independent of the relative-motion-induced dilation covered by special
relativity.

Quite true, and it turns out that for reasonable accelerations and trip
times, the GR (acceleration-induced) component is also vanishingly small.

By the way, general relativity\'s acceleration-based dilation is critical
to resolving the infamous Twin Paradox of special relativity.  Since the
travelling twin must accelerate several times during the trip, unlike the
stay-at-home twin, the former is unambiguously younger when they reunite.

AFAIK the UK is sending in 250 Gurkas and Royal Marine Commandos as part of
our contribution to the new peacekeeping force.

Both true, but "legions" also can serve as a generic term for a military
force.  For example: the French Foreign Legion is not a "legion-sized"
unit, and never has been.

Just brainstorming a little here:
Along the same lines -- "Imperial Vanguard"
If the Imperial Army wears red uniforms some sort -- "Thin Red Line"
With Kipling for inspiration, simply "Boots"

I suppose so, but it wouldn\'t be the first.  "Behind the Claw" always makes
me think of Gene Wolfe for some reason.  (Speaking of which, GURPS: New Sun
is pretty close to being published.)  And as someone else pointed out:
"First In" is possible to read as a Spec Ops type book.

Oh, I liked "Boots and Saddles" as a title, but then I\'m a sucker for
tradition.  Nice game too, although it just screamed for computerization to
sort out the C2 rules.

"Iron Fist" is OK. Perhaps "Iridium Fist" would be better, to tie in to the
Iridium Throne.  I\'m not so fond of "By Other Means" because it can be sort
of ambiguous; I keep thinking of "Operations Other Than War."

Sorry, am I missing something? 

Anyway, I hope this rambling has been of some use.

Actually, Australia is sending in Australians.  The UK, as part of the UN

DAMN! I think you\'ve just hit the jackpot.  However, were I to
put this quote up front in the book, I\'d probably start it with
"... you may fly over a land forever; ...", rather than starting
with "Americans in 1950...".

Yep. I wouldn\'t have even responded to the original post, but that
particular segment smacked to me of "How the West Was Wrong," whether
intentionally or unintentionally.

I recently started classes and I\'m already getting too much of that from my
classmates. Did I mention that I just *love* the social sciences?

IMTU:

The countdown to jump exits work similiar to trying to download a file off

then 2 minutes later it\'s down to 45... then begins to level off. I figure
that\'s how it\'d work for jump... it assumes 168 hours, but it adjusts it\'s
count down the closer it gets to exit and can be more accurate.

Likely :)

That\'s one explanation.  Another is the percentage of the burn map that you
use in both your color and diffuse layers, if you have them.  Around 30%
seems normal for everyday ships, with up to 50% or more to represent real
tramp-ass freighters.  A technique that I used for some pictures I did for
Derek Stanley (http://persweb.direct.ca/dstanley/Home.html and then hit the
PBICQ logs and the Orkney pictures) added an additional layer of dirt and
dings in the Photoshop layers.  In a dirt layer, I airbrushed random
squiggles with a wide brush, then used the noise filter on it at about 40%
and monochrome.  In a seperate layer, I added a bunch of hand-drawn pitting
(tablets are beautiful things!!!) and combined that with my normal hull line
bump map.  The results definately depict a freighter that\'s been around the
block a few times :)

You\'d need a tau factor .99 or less for the dilation to be of
interest to anybody but astrogators. (ie for every 100 seconds at rest,
only 99 pass for the traveller). 

tau = sqrt(1-v^2) where v is expressed in units of c=1. 
tau = arcsin(cos(v)) is a formula better suited to calculators. 

It just so happens that the function is symettrical), so if velocity Y
has a tau of X, then a velocity of X has a tau of Y.

So we need a velocity a bit above 14% of c. Or about 42,320 km/sec.
V=A*T, so T=V/A.

- ----	----
1g	49d	
2g	24d
3g	16d

5g	10d
6g	 8d

Since normal run to jump situations involve accelerating for mere
*hours*, they aren\'t going to be subject to enough time dilation to
worry about. They might lose a second or two on a trip.

Sorry, it doesn\'t work that way. The dilation effects *add*, not
cancel. But as my other post points out, they\'d have to accelerate for
*days* to get noticeable dilation effects. 

The astrogator has to worry about the fractions of a second involved.
Passengers don\'t.

It\'s the *players* I\'m not willing to give credit to. *They* are the
ones who will try to pass off generic" luxury goods" from a trade table
to the locals. They need to learn that it doesn\'t work that way.

BTW, a washing machine will only be of use to "lower class" types.
Ignoring the need for power (hey, if they can have gasoline powered
washing machines in Italy, we can have ones with power packs), the fact
of the matter is that most "upper class" clothing isn\'t washable. I
don\'t mean "has to be hand washed". I mean "can\'t be washed at all"!
The various velvets, silks, embroidery, etc will either be ruined by
immersion, or will bleed dye all over each other. 

Remember, *bathing* wasn\'t that common. 

And for commoners, well, the soap they\'ve got makes laundry kind of
interesting. BTW, the Romans *didn\'t* have soap. At least not soap
useful for washing people. Read up on how they got clean[1].

This is another example of *assuming* things about cultures that are
actually *quite* alien. 

And frankly, scrap iron *is* a "high value" item for such a culture.
It\'d be high value for the nomads as well, but they can\'t carry or use
as much. It works better to sell them finished items. 

[1]Basicly a long soak to soften the skin, then they\'d have a servant
*scrape* the dead outer layer of skin (and the dirt, oils, etc) off
with a sort of knife-like device (you hold the edge at right angles to
the skin). They wound up with a sort of paste made up of the oils
applied to make scraping easier, and the stuff scraped off. 

Said paste, derived from gladiators, was sold as an aphrodisiac.

Serious:  Gurps:  Soldiers of the Imperuim
Not serious:  Gurps:  Frack! Got drafted again.

I have a question about the Pocket Empires book.
In the tables section on what should be page 104 there is a table
labeled "World Settlement" which lists various types of human and alien
settlements. If alien settlements are encountered the table directs you
to an "alien race table". No such table exists, although its nature is
suggested on page 32 in the World History section. Question:  Does
anyone have any canonical errata for Pocket Empires in general and this
"alien race table" in particular. I\'m an ardent heretic, and have done
my own work around, but I\'d still like to see what the original table
was supposed to look like.

I posted the entire paragraph so that Doug could accept or reject it, as
he sees fit (I assume that quoting a long single-sentence paragraph is
allowed under the "fair use" portion of copyright law).  While I agree
that removing the specific reference to post-Hiroshima America makes the
quote universally applicable, I believe that using the full quote, with
attribution, places the issue of "push-button" warfare versus infantry
combat into historical perspective.  In other words, should Doug decide
to use this quote, he can choose to use it as either an eternal truth of
warfare (and thus use the edited quote), or as an historical perspective
(using the quote as an illustration of early Terran recogintion of this
concept).

Either way, the quote expresses a concept that needs to be expressed in
any Traveller work deling with ground forces (Army or Marine).

Well, in self-defense, I didn\'t claim that this was _accurate_; I merely
offered this as a quick-and-dirty plausible explanation.

Of course, any player who seeks significant benefits from relativity
effects during the normal run to jumpspace is probably trying to
munchkinize the rules anyway, and deserves whatever the referee
delivers....

Good point, especially since the values involved seem to be too small to

However, since this is a reference to Regency Era material would that be a
problem for SJG. My understanding was that they were limited to CT
references.

So this is not just a "ME TOO" I\'d like to cover some other stuff. Doug, do
you intend to cover Imperial Marines?

If you do are you going to try to adjust or otherwise reduce the effect of
the hyper-power battledress in GT:SM? If you are might I suggest a
specialize anti-BD weapon? Perhaps a type of anti-armor ammunition that can
penetrate BD and do some real damage to a person inside, but doesn\'t have
the oomph to hurt a MBT or APC. If it could be fired from a gauss rifle, and
strings of them could be rigged in anti-BD mines this would tend to nullify
the high DR of the BD. If you fire it into an unarmored person it just
penetrates like a normal round (except perhaps it goes completely through).
This would prevent it from unbalancing the game the other way. Just a
suggestion.

Moving to another fine area of discussion: The Marine Cutlass. The idea that
the Marine Cutlass is made of some kind of superdense/steel laminate has
been discussed on the list. It is a reasonable suggestion, it\'s one failing
being that it would most likely require the Marine to have one weapon for
actual battle (where a suit of BD would make the heavy blade usable) and a
lighter steel alloy ceremonial blade. I have a short dissertation on the
Marine Cutlass on my website at:
http://members.home.net/carlino/imperial.htm

Hope I\'ve given you something to ponder.

Actually, this should be "Dear Doug" - is the Ground Forces book only going
to cover Imperial organisations?? I was hoping to see the GURPS translation

Definitely there for the fear factor.

Indonesia: "We want Asian faces in the peacekeeping force!"
Australia: "No problem. We\'ll ask Britain for the Gurkas."
Timor militia: "RUN!"

I liked the comments from the Interfet commander, Major-General Peter
Cosgrove. Basically, he said that it\'s one thing for the militia to shoot
unarmed civilians, but entirely another to take on a modern professional
army.

with Traveller and somewhat with GT).

Many fixes/enhancements that I think will make some people happy. 

New map file format.  When you load up your old map files, expect 
it to take anywhere from 2 to 10 times as long to load and convert 
the map as normal.  ***This only occurs during conversion***  You 
don\'t get any messages saying this is in progress.  Just wait.  On 
my 166, it took 20 minutes to convert the _1120.map (It was, after 
all, loading and converting 36 sectors!).  All future saves and loads 
will be substantially faster.  Maps are on average 15% smaller.  For 
instance, where before it took about 5 minutes to load and display 
1120, it now takes about 30 seconds.

Added different line styles and thicknesses for Route Legs. 

Added hatch patterns to give a wider range of differentiation 
between Empire colorings. 

Added a new point and click Route Leg creator.  It is called 
InstaLeg and is accessed via the popup menu in the Route Leg 
listing (this is REALLY in beta ... don\'t try to fool it as you will 
probably break it.  Just follow the prompts). 

Substantially enhanced the popup menus for all functions. 

Enhanced the Edit Sector/Subsector dialog box.  Its much, much 
faster than it was before ... this makes it much easier to create your 
own sector map files. 

Changed the IFF function to IIF in the Query dialog box (Bug fix ... 
oops).

Added an Ancient Site tag to each world (like Scout Base or Naval 
Base) 

Turned the little system information dots to hollow circles.  Some 
people were complaining that it limited the colors that could be used 
for an Empire. 

Currently, all import functions are disabled.  I am in the process of 
changing some internal structures (to support a much broader range 
of data) and I don\'t want to have to worry with these features right 
now.  They will return ... honest (I need them, too!!).

The U.K. is sending in the Ghurkhas as part of their input, like Norway is
sending in (I think)3x officers... if it\'s not 3, it\'s 5.  Just that many of
these troopies will be passing through Darwin and transported by RAN Navy

True, but it does show up in its official name, which again isn\'t the case
for any Imperial unit I know about.

The more I think about it, the more I like "Sword and Shield", especially

Amen!  It\'s a shame that wargaming seems more or less dead as a hobby just
as computers and networking are reaching the point where it would be easy
to have really cool c3i simulation.  (Computer "war games" are out there,
but I don\'t know of any that approach the scope or complexity of e.g. 
Squad Leader or The Next War, or Boots & Saddles for that matter.  And
please, if I\'m ignorant, tell me!!)

I like it!  That\'s now tied with S&S for first place, in my view, with PBI
in second.

Douglas (the guy writing the ground forces supplement for GURPS Traveller)
is my brother.  He was also an 11-bravo in the US Army, and rated as a
sharpshooter with various weapons.  Our father was in the British Army for
a time before emigrating to the US, and was also a sharpshooter.  I, on
the other hand, was rejected by Navy ROTC for poor vision -- my only brush
with the military unless you count writing software in the defense
industry -- and am lucky to be able to identify the business vs. butt end
of a rifle two times out of three. :)

No, Australia does not maintain any Ghurkha troops outside of the odd
exchange soldier/squad (as little as 1-person, to as many as a dozen or so)
who undergo jungle warfare training in Canungra (as a rule), while we send a
recipracole "unit" to train in the U.K. or with Nato in Europe.

Craig, I loved SL and used to play it in stints from a couple of hours to
complete long weekends (Friday night to Sunday arvo, or Saturday morning to
Monday arvo, depending), but the only gamer I knew who played it drifted
away before he died.  The closest I have come to it in a computer game is
Microsoft\'s "Close Combat" and "Close Combat: A Bridge to Far," both of
which I have read reviews calling them "(the board game) Squad
Leader-like..." or "Based on the board game, Squad Leader..." to which they
may be right?  There is also on the shelves at the moment, but I haven\'t
been able to get yet, is "Close Combat: Russian Campaign" which is supposed
to be bigger than the other two put together!

If you like SL, I recommend the CC series.

   Well, today I traveled to the center of the universe, Normal, Illinois,
and stood beneath the GDW sign. After a brief reflection on all that grew
out
from this spot, I got to work-  ladder, wrenches, hacksaw- an hour and a
half
later, the sign was in the back of a U-Haul truck.
   Next stop- Keven Walsh, my spouse Barb, and I retired to a local Irish
pub
and some dark Guinness. Two toasts: to GDW and the game we all love, and to
absent friends who could not join in the moment.
   Now, before any fear some desecration has taken place, consider this.
The
sign had advanced symptoms of decay; heavy rust, faded out letters, sag in
the support brackets (check out the photo at downport.com). Left
unattended,
its days were numbered before the building owner tore it down as an
eyesore.
Now it has a chance at a fresh start. It will be rehabbed and hung in a
place
of honor in my FLGS. It is a piece of our heritage as fellow Travellers and
now, will be there for the next generation of gamers.
   Photos of the event will soon be available on line. Also, anyone in the

However, since this is a reference to Regency Era material would that be a
problem for SJG. My understanding was that they were limited to CT
references.<

My understanding is a bit different. They are limited to GDW references
because of the DGP copyright thing, but given a conflict between CT and
any later work appear to have a preference for CT.

Amen Jeff!  This is the best and "deepest" of them all so far.  IMHO.

Now, while Jay does the resto, some of us need to be working on the design
for the shrinemobile.  We need a design that we can bolt the grav units onto
in the future, but that has an ATV chassis under it for now.  Then, someone
needs to work out an algorithm for the route that the Traveller Shrinemobile
will take so that everyone on the TML will have equal opportunity to visit
it. (Might I suggest the Santa Claus algorithm as a good starting point?)

Many mid to high tech passengers may have personal electronic devices

but I\'d expect the devices to have some simple recalibration function -

	That works for me.  Just how much acceleration is required

If you can tolerate Microsoft and some real-time play, Close Combat and A
Bridge Too Far are really very good games at the Squad Leader level.    At
higher levels (from Company to Division level) _The Operational Art of War_
is very impressive.  I\'ve only gotten to fiddle with it for an hour or so
but it looks to be surprisingly flexible and the AI is pretty smart. 
When/if then modern version appears, I\'m going to spend some serious time
with it.

Hey, a comrade.  I did a year of NROTC myself, before I messed up my knees
beyond recognition and they let me go.   It\'s not a total loss, I ended up
working for the Navy as a contractor.

No, the preference if for CT feel, but much of the MT and even TNE
backstory is there, with a twist. (For example,, Longbow II is there, and
Strephon\'s reason for being there is the same as in MT/TNE, but what that
is is still a bit murky)

The phrase "Sword and Shield" isn\'t specifically tied to the Regency
setting. Although it appears on the back of the RCVG, the Regency is s much
a continuation of the Imperium that the phrase could easily have been in
use in the Imperium as well.

Actually, it doesn\'t.  Under GURPS, a standard Cutlass has a minimum ST of
7.  Switching to hyperdense material increases minimum ST by 50%, to 11. 
This dovetails nicely with 11 being the minimum recommended ST for the
various Marine templates.

I assumed, based on the wording of the article, that Australia
had picked up members of the 3rd Royal Gurkha Rifles which was
disbanded by the U.K. back in November, 1996.

My mistake and my apologies for it.

This does lead me to ask, though, if it would even be possible
to have provincial units become "elite" when so much combat
capability in a high-tech society, such as the Imperium, depends
on technology. There\'s already been a discussion on how the use
of battledress could, in some campaigns, result in troops who
would be ineffective if their suits were unavailable.

Could such elitism disappear when battledress, combat robots,
grav tanks, and PGMPs/FGMPs rule the battlefield? If not, how
effective would it be against High Stellar tech?

IIRC Striker, Striker II, and 5FW  differentiated  between  troop
quality and equipment TL.  So within those systems  if  the  high
tech toys were removed it should be possible to determine the new
combat effectiveness at the new TL.

The implication is that the 3I (and  other  states*)  maintain  a
training regimen that does  not  omit  low-tech  combat.  Or,  in
other words, Imperial troops are not  at  a  complete  loss  when
deprived of their battledress.  Check out  Striker,  et  al,  for
combat effectiveness changes.

(* = The exception being the Hivers.)

IMTU the Aslan Guard on Capital have the same reputation  as  the Gurkhas do
in RL.

Actually the British (not the Australians) are sending in the Ghurkhas, as
our contribution to the operation.
As an aside the Ghurkhas can be considered a mercenary unit in the pay of
the British army, however they are definitely considered an elite fighting
unit by anyone who has met them or read of their exploits.

Close Combat is an awesome game.  IMHO, it\'s the best software Microsoft 
ever put out.  I actually prefer the original to "A bridge too far" as it 
feels a bit more realistic to me.  In ABTF, they made the weapons more 
deadly and the troops more accruate with them, probably in an attempt to 
make the gameplay more exciting, as the original game is on the slow side 
for a comptuer game, but just right, IMHO, for a comptuerized war game.

I haven\'t playe russian front.

I don\'t quite see the problem.  Provincial does not necessarily mean
low-tech.  The Gurkhas themselves, for instance, are equipped with exactly
the same technology as other UK infantry units.  They are elite because of
their reputation, their esprit d\'corps, and their selectivity.  (Thousands
of Gurkhas volunteering for a few hundred billets.)  

You could easily have elite provincial forces recruited from some low-tech
world but trained and equipped to High-stellar standards.

Fencing is going to be a small part of the IM template.  Probably just a
single point.

Much as I like the image of battledressed Marines rampaging around swinging
swords, it just smacks into my suspension of disbelief meter hard.

So why do the Marines teach the cutlass?  Three reasons.

Tradition.  The same reason I learned to fight with a rifle-mounted
bayonet. The cutlass is part of Marine heritage.

Training.  Fencing is all about body control and position.  Battledress
control is also about precise movements of the body.  the Marines teach
fencing to recruits to hone their instincts in this area.

Recreation.  On a cramped naval vessel, Marines can duel for amusement.
Electric scoring systems and heavy padded keep anyone from getting
(seriously) hurt, and any stretch of hallway becomes a handy runway.

I will include the TL12 Marine cutlass just for completeness sake.

More like the US Old Guard (3rd United States Infantry)

One thing I\'ve always found interesting about the Imperial Guard regiments
is that they seemingly were still under the control of their Sector Dukes.
Except for the Marine Guard, the Aslan Guard, the Household Cavalry, and
the Imperial Artillery.  Sort of like the Shogun "protecting" the Emperor.

The Marine Assault Armor (the biggest, baddest, LC:0 armor) is going to
have a DR of around 650.  A modern M-72 LAW has a decent chance of
pentrating that armor.

I\'m hoping to get at least two or three additional suits, with differing
strengths and weaknesses into the book.

I\'d suggest Shortsword, which is already in the IM templates in the main GT
book as an optional secondary skill.  In GURPS terms, the cutlass is not
really a Fencing weapon, just a slightly curved shortswords with a guard.

Good ideas, all around.  You could do it in a sidebar, with a suggestion
that actually using it in combat is most appropriate for cinematic games.

It also has the errata for Pocket Empires.

Subject: Blank vs. Non-Blank.

This is an advance look at what I am currently considering for Sector
Data. I invite your feedback.

Marc Miller

Specimen data for Vland Sector for inclusion in First Survey (circa
Year 0)
(accompanies Sector Map).
Best viewed in Courier (monospaced font).

This data reflects the information currently (Year 0) available in
AAB. World
Size, Atmosphere, and Hydrographics have not changed for worlds in the
sector. Blanks indicate Starport, Population, Government, Law Level,
and Tech
Level (all of which cannot be reliably determined after more than
1,700 years
of Long Night). Historical names are reflected, although they may have
changed. The referee has two options: generate the missing world data
using
T4 (and enter it in the listing); or consult the more complete data
for the
territory (provided online).

At the same time, there is available some world data which is
reasonably
current. This information (which is available to any travellers who
inquire
at the data base or library or starport) is reflected (for example)
in the
entry for world 0921. This entry shows complete information.

<snip>
Players (groups, ship crews, etc) can enter the data in their own
copy of the
Survey as well as record the routes their exploratory voyages take.

Vland data file is missing some stellar data and gas giant
information, which
produces the anomalously low Gas Giant presences.

This example reflects only a partial list in order to conserve file
space.
This is not the final run, so some data (including names) may change.
Names
ending in a period(.) are newly generated; original names do not end
in
period.

Hi Dom,

Quick response to your query from the TML:

> When in M0 is TLWH set?
>
Any time just pre- or post- the founding of the Third Imperium but not as
late as Year 200 as (IIRC) the M0 Campaign Book shows quite significant
expansion of the Imperium by that point!. As TLWH was written at a time
when all David (Burden) and I had seen was a rough draft of the rule book,
the star system data was generated by David by applying a Hard Times/TNE
sort of degradation of the 1100s data. As David had been working on
Gushemege (stars, aliens, etc.) for some time (partly due to HIWG interests
and complementing the Dagudashaag development of the UK fanzine Signal-GK),
we hoped this would be a sensible source of data.

All the terminology (Sylean Scout Corp, etc.) was chosen as best we could
at the time to be generic for a pre- or post- Year 0 date. Terms such as
Corp/Corps were down to my less than perfect editing as we tried to use
British English throughout.

When IG brought out First Survey (FS), we supplied them with the data for
the area around our adventure and said "please use this" (we might have
given them the whole of Gush - can\'t recall). Instead, IG generated their
own data. We were a little disheartened at this, especially given that IG
had said they might like to use TLWH themselves. We pointed out that their
new data had the gov/law problem and was inconsistent with TLWH and with
some concepts in M0 (which we\'d already written for them) but this all fell
on (apparently) deaf ears.

So, when we came to do the IG versions LWH and Gateway, we used the FS
databut (IIRC) still adapted the data for one or two worlds, where we could
think up an appropriate excuse, such as the FS data being inaccurate, or
misinterpreted (e.g. population referred only to humans, not aliens) -
otherwise ISTR we had large cities set on near-zero pop worlds, according
to FS! Certainly there was no intention that the Scouts had got anywhere
near that subsector at the time that the adventure was set.

Any comments on TLWH, LWH or Gateway (or in fact any of the BITS product
line - 101s, adventures, etc.) are always welcome - please e-mail to
bits@bits.org.uk. As we only do short print runs of our products, there is
the opportunity to correct any major errata for subsequent runs. And, as
Dom said, one of these days we might re-release TLWH.

Definitely. One later part of the adventure assumes that the PCs are on that
ship, at least with regard to deckplans, although it\'s not critical.

for the purpose of the game. Please lets try to make sure this doesn\'t spiral into the

I was wondering - what would our current mainstream religions think about the Third 
Imperium? I have a culture that was formed from some generation ships form Terra - thus 
the population still has practicing christians, jews, muslims, buddhists, etc...

..how would these religions take in the new view of the universe? What place would 
aliens have in the various dogma (are they savable, or are they beyond the grace of 
god/allah/etc...). Once his role becomes known, where would Grandfather and the 
ancients fit in? What is the religious importance (if any) of Earth?

This society, as I said, was seeded from 21st century earth, and for various reasons 
has a fairly strong religious background. It has been growing now for a few centuries, 
so the religions will have changed some - but how much? Will they still be around?

I\'d appreciate anyone\'s _non-inflamatory_ views on the subject.

For the record, I am a practicing christian (Episcopal), but rather ecumenical in my 
views, and very tolerant of other religions.

I am currently running "The Long Way Home".

I set mine in year -29, the year of the founding of the Sylean Federation
Scout Service. This makes J-3 bleeding edge technology, and the suggested player
ship standard issue.

The fact that the ship is titled as a Sylean Scout Corp craft dates it between
year -29 and year zero (Milieu 0 page 29). In year zero the Sylean Federation
Scout Service was renamed the Imperial Interstellar Scout Service (M0 page 11).

I am using Gurps (very) Lite for rules, GT, and First In. That is all that I
find necessary to run it. Though of course I add detail from all the other
stuff.

I prefer non-combat oriented games so I also equipped them with a radically
stealthed small craft so that they can avoid detection (mostly) and usually can
avoid combat if they want too. Only one of the group is pro-combat, another is
anti-combat, and the other four are combat-neutral, so it works out fine.  (I
have had one gratuitous hostile space-craft encounter, when they were unprepared
for combat just for fun!).

They group seem pretty good at breaking scout corp directives though ;-)

Yes that problem can manifest itself in at least three different ways too.
Fortunately the adventures don\'t have to be linear or even all completed. Makes
it a right pain to prepare for the next session though. I would be interested in
any methods you used to avoid the short cutting of them (off list).

Some of the TL difference hand-waves that it uses need a bit of thought or
rework to make believable too. e.g. lower TL ships shouldn\'t be a problem
(though my players managed to make it so!) and shouldn\'t have the performance
indicated in some of the text.

There are also some very improbable events that you might want to think about
and tweak slightly before presenting them to your players. 

I always like to change the scenarios slightly anyhow, to make them consistent
to
me technically, and just in case any of the players have sneakily read them
(never happens does it!).

There are two alternative GT versions (stats only) of the Lintula Sunrise on my
website if you are interested.

F**k the Army, F**k the Marines, I Hate This F**king Place (or: I Have
Truly Found Paradise) and F**k the Emperor.

My other favorite was the basic training "wake-up".  The cattle cars we
rode in to training sites (rated for thirty people, we regulary got in 50
with equipment) were covered with scrawls like "B-6-1, 46 days, and I wake
up!"

Translated, somebody from Bravo Company, 6th Battalion, 1st Infantry
Training Brigade had 46 days left beforing graduation and waking up from
this nightmare.

Well, the reasons the Gurkhas are so useful include:
a) hardiness - at least in part because they come from a "low tech" society,
they\'re extremely tough, tougher than the average Brit recruit.
b) suitability to terrain - they\'re often referred to as jungle fighters.
They\'re not just useful in jungle terrain, but they are more suited to some
environments than others. 
c) discipline - again for probably cultural reasons they\'re more disciplined
than British equivalents. So one significant use is for officer training at
Sandhurst.

In the traveller universe, certain types of sophont, or indeed of humaniti, are
going to be more suited to certain types of environment, in particular to
gravity and atmospheric differences, making them less dependent on technology.

Also some cultures are going to produce troops which are mentally or physically
tougher than others, or which have less concerns about going to war (go back to
the page with the makeup of Interfet and check out the respective contributions
of Sweden, Norway & Finland).

For an SF reference look no further than the Fremen in the Dune saga.

Actually, I\'d be sitting in a comfortable cubicle on the other side of the
planet, designing torpedo countermeasures.  I\'ve found that\'s the best
tactical approach to surviving an infantry engagement.

*splutter*  Great, and I just got that keyboard, too.

BTW, my wife voted for \'Ground Pounders\' when I recited the candidates to
her this morning.

One can imagine that an aikido-like martial art plus yoga regimen would
evolve around the cutlass drill -- one in which absolute control of
position and movement, coupled with an intangible \'chi\' element, would be
the measure of skill.  Perhaps groups of Marines would perform a series of
such positions and movements in eerily precise synchronization -- much
like present-day rifle drill, but with more fluidity and even higher
standards of performance.  This would be a very impressive show!

Good choice.  However, IIRC correctly, it was "Into The Mud" in the
original, and even if not, I\'d suggest the slight modification for the
title.  You want to suggest movement, not WWI. :)  I\'m reminded of the
famous line summarizing a general\'s hope during that war: "From mud,
through blood, to the green fields beyond."  That latter phrase was used
as a wargame title, way back when.

That takes me back; I used to do the same thing.  We\'d cover a friend\'s
garage ping-pong table with maps and status sheets and rules booklets and
play until we dropped from exhaustion. :)  Squad Leader, Third Reich, The
Next War, and Panzer Leader were the ones I recall most fondly, but
between us we owned virtually everything significant ever produced by
Avalon Hill, SPI, or GDW -- plus others from more obscure companies -- and
nearly everything got played at least once.  And that\'s not to mention the
miniatures gaming.  Or, of course, the RPGing.

Um...I\'m trying to work out when we had time for other activities, like
school, or sleeping. :)

Based on this recommendation I bought CC: Russian Campaign at lunch today.
I\'ll try it out this evening; looks great based on a quick browse of the
manual.  Anyone interested in seeing a mini-review here in a few days, or
is this all getting too far off topic?

Ah HA!  So the Imperial lackey admits that this is nothing but another load

are so big we never ever violate canon.

As for a title for your so-called sourcebook, we of the Confederation
suggest:

GT: Mindless Lackeys
GT: Imperialist Warmongers
GT: Hidebound Aristo-Sucking Wuus-Warriors

Have space for the Solomani Menace indeed; WE will have all of the space we
want!  The likes of you will never stand in our way.  Now why don\'t you go
and summon a committe of 23 other wimps like yourself and try to come up
with a defense against the Righteous War-Fleets of the True Men.


PS - Glad to hear you got the contract.  As for titles, I did like the GT:
Sword and Shield suggestion, but I think GT: The Imperial Fist sounds
better (For some reason, Sword and Shield makes me think KGB).

_Into the Mud_ is now the title of Chapter 1, which covers the history and
mission of the Imperial Ground Forces.  The quote opens the chapter.

OK, now I\'ve added Dom\'s sig and a link to Mark Urbin\'s sig page. I\'m sure
that Doug\'s "3257th Philosophy Battalion" quote is soon to follow.

Oh, yeah, the main addition is the 400t Scotian Deep-class Type-R3 Deep
Trader (MT), as published by Lone Scout Enterprises. Almost an AuricTech
desgn, from the pricetag... ;-)

BTW, does someone have an algorithm for calculating whether a trader can
break even? I\'m sure I have seen calcs from people (Paul Schirf?), but does
anyone have a benchmark formula that you just plug numbers into (no. of
passengers, cargo size, life support & crew costs, etc)?

And finally, it\'s a big ma\'af ("sorry") on the Jump Points. I *have* at
least updated Jesse\'s link (whew) since I go there often, but I have yet to
carve out time to fix my database attempts at storing and publishing the

that may or may not count all the new Webring sites.  %-(  Ideally, I want

A review?  Yes please!  I looked for this title yesterday at Hardly Normals
(errrr, a local computer superstore) and found that the few dozen I\'d seen a
few days back were all gone... as usual.  I\'d love to hear a real life

Another couple of references that I mentioned about a year or so ago are a 
pair of soldier concepts written about by Timothy Zahn, namely, the 
Blackcollars and the Cobras.  The Cobras were cybernetically augmented 
guerilla warriors with all kinds of nifty weapons imbedded in them.  The 
downsides were several; the weapons and servo systems were controlled by a 
nanocomputer that was implanted underneath the brain in the skull, and once 
it was in place, it couldn\'t be removed without killing the Cobra.  Second 
off, the nanocomputer had a mind of its own, and would evaluate threats in 
the environment and act \'appropriately\', sometimes to disasterous results.  
Thirdly, the implantation tended to shorten the lifespan of the soldier by a 
good 20, 30 years due to the replacement of natural bone by advanced 
ceranometal composites.  The problem was, this tended to cut bone marrow 
production way down, resulting in a leukemia-like condition that worsened as 
the Cobra aged.

The other concept was the Blackcollars, who were trained heavily in martial 
arts and sabotage techniques, including extensive use of low tech weaponry 
designed to pass high tech weapons detectors.  Weapons included things like 
blowguns, shiriken, boomerangs, the \'Y\' style slingshot, and others.  The 
emphasis was on finding low tech solutions to high tech problems.  Their 
uniforms were somewhat stealthy as well, like a combat environment suit with 
the chameleon option.  Lastly, the Blackcollars were subjected to some slight 
medical modifications that sped up their reflexes to double normal human 
rate, giving them an advantage in hand to hand combat.

An example of low tech weapons vs high tech defenses can also be found in 
Cole & Bunch\'s \'Fleet of the Damned\', where a 100 year old strongpoint using 
obsolete weapons and ammo does devastating effects on an enemy whose defenses 
were looking for something more modern.  <grin>

The sources are out there...

Okay, I don\'t know how to use a sword etc and for years I thought the SCA
was an anarchist terror group like Bander-Meinhoff or the Symboneise
Liberation Army. 

But from reading the Piers Anthony \'Bio\' series, I loved the idea of foils
being used in Zero G combat (to puncture suits) and for close combat in
narrow corridors, especially as in zero G combat, a thrust as opposed to
slash weapon (centre of gravity and what have you) would probably be more
effective.  Also, I read a \'War in 2020\' book which had a chapter on what
melee weapons are best in ZG and this backed it up. And while an ordinary
foil would have no chance Vs Combat armour or Battledress, a combat foil
would be some super sword designed for maximum <ahem> penetration.

So IMTU out went Cutlasses for marines & navy and in came foils, rapiers and
the like. This ties in neatly with T4\'s resurgence of the foil as a noble\'s
weapon as it gives some justification to why the nobility are practiced in
its use, especially when any noble worth his/her salt has a naval academy &
1 or 2 terms minimum service. A neat and tidy package indeed. 

Whaddayareacon. Extreme cannon violation or does it just make sense?

so good I still remember a bit of it this long after.

The adventures involved doing a bunch of undercover-type stuff for an
important Sylean noble; getting military and economic information, fighting
pirates, recovering old Rule-of-Man historical documents, and so on. Of
course, the "noble" is Cleon Zhunastu, and the missions are integral to his
plans of founding the Third Imperium. IIRC, it had a subplot about Cleon\'s
wife, and a great twist at the end where the players end up fighting
against Cleon.

Does anyone remember this, or have the originals archived? There were a few
posts about it.

As someone who has owned the game for quite some time and played it quite a
bit, I\'ve got to say I\'ve been nothing but pleased with it. It\'s brutally
realistic, yet still extremely engaging. There is a great deal of detail,
more than most wargames. The AI (both for your own units and enemy units) is
simply the best I\'ve ever seen. If you tell the infantry to go someone, they
will arrange themselves behind cover, or in trenches. Morale of units is
handled very well too. Try marching a group of Russian conscripts through a
field full of bodies and compare the results when you march shock troops
through the same field.  The great part is that most of the complexity is
transparent, and the game has a rather pleasant learning curve.

IMHO, Close Combet III: The Russian Front happens to be one of the best
video games on the market right now.

I don\'t know what they\'d think. The standard Traveller line (indeed, the
standard sci-fi line) is that the importance of the world\'s religions will
be downplayed as we reach for the stars.

However, Enlightenment thinkers thought that they\'d finish off religion too,
but they didn\'t quite manage too. In fact, there\'s actually been an increase
in the power of fundamentalist movements across the globe. However, that\'s
quite a different direction than the questions you\'re asking. I don\'t see a
reason why religious beliefs have to be confined to those who left earth on
generation ships.

It\'s going to vary widely. Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, chinese
religious practices (I\'m leary of calling it Confucianism as Samuel P.
Huntington does in his wonderful essay "The Clash of Civilizations?: The
Next Pattern of Conflict") all have changed greatly during the years in
which they have existed. Simply looking at the differences between Western
catholic theologians of the middle ages, those of the Enlightenment and
those of the modern day.

There was even a time in the 18th century when the Jesuits very nearly
rectified Chinese ancestor worship with the teachings of the Catholic
church.

What I\'m trying to say is that different religions will have very different
approaches to the colonization, conquest and conversion of space and alien
races, human and otherwise. Even within the various religions beliefs and
opinions can vary widely. A fundamentalist Christian may have vastly
different views on evolution than a Jesuit biologist.

>Once his role becomes known, where would Grandfather and the
>ancients fit in? What is the religious importance (if any) of Earth?


That would be a rough one to rectify with some of the world\'s religious
beliefs. I\'m sure that some would integrate Grandfather into their religion,
at least in passing, while others would deny he ever existed. Some
fundamentalist Christians believe, for example, that ancient fossils were
placed in the earth to test or deceive mankind. I can see the same attitude
in reference to ancient structures and ruins.

around?


Why not? Over two centuries after the Enlightenment the world\'s religions
are still strong and healthy.

So you\'ve really thrown everything at the PC\'s and they still survive
that trade run/belt mining/merc ticket adventure. They did it and
managed to make alot of credits without being rules rapists.(wow!) I\'ve
gotta assume that the Imperuim is gonna want some taxes out of their
profits. After all, the money to finance those Trillion Credit Squadrons
and Imperial bureaucrats has to be coming from somewhere, right? The
Cr500 tax from TCS only pertains to Navy budgets; Striker theoretically
hinted at what I\'ll call a military tax with which you could calculate
spending for all military services. Pocket Empires had a govenment
budget and taxes which one could exptrapolate into a person owing so
many Credits per year, but that was only for small intersteller
governments which really can\'t compare to the 11,000 worlds in the
Imperuim.

Does anyone have any ideas on what a Imperial personal income tax would
look like? For the moment, IMTU I\'m borrowing from the US Tax Code, but
I gotta assume after several thousand years that the 3I would come up
with a better tax code than that. Also, was there any mention of taxes
in this "World Tamers Handbook"? I never had a chance to see the TNE
book on world building (World Tamers Handbook?) but I\'m guessing that
they may have made some mention of it. Finnally, if this topic has been
done to death, point me in the right direction to look at the messages.
Thanks.

There isn\'t one, I believe.  I can\'t find a precise reference, but in the
discussion of Far Trader, it came out that the Imperium taxes worlds, not
people.  Individual planets set whatever tax rates they want for their
residents, and have to provide a certain amount to the Empire (the precise
amount depends on population and Tech Level, I think).  

You might rule that the Imperium directly taxes "Citizens of the Imperium"
(IMTU, this phrase covers people who have no fixed planetary place of
abode.)  If it does, I expect it would be very simple: X percent of income,
no deductions, no nonsense, except possibly exempting Imperial pensions
from taxation. X should be a very small number, too.

I\'ve been thinking about this on and off for some years  now  and
here is my take:

Most Imperial revenue comes from a tax levied on  member  worlds.
The actual amount to be paid each year  is  set  by  an  Imperial
Assessor (part of the Imperial Treasury) who decides based on the
size of the planetary economy (includes population, TL, etc)  and
representations made by the nobility.  In  reality  this  tax  is
often set by negotiations between the  planetary  government  and
the nobility, with the Office of  the  Assessor  acting  only  as
middlemen.  Planetary governments raise this tax  money  as  they
see fit ... by income tax, sales tax,  poll  tax,  business  tax,
etc, or a mixture of different means.  The one  tax  method  they
are not permitted is customs duties.

The second source of Imperial revenue comes from a  business  tax
levied on any LIC corporation (including  the  megacorporations).
Typically a flat 5% of gross annual profits.

The third source of Imperial revenue (and most  relevant  to  the
original question) is customs duties.  These are levied  on  free
traders and other interstellar non-LIC business.  Typically  this
is an import tax administered by  the  local  Starport  Authority
(with backup from the IISS and IN where necessary).  Usually  the
amounts are small and vary from item to item on different worlds.
Having LIC status exempts customs duties ... however,  the  local
customs office also administers prohibitions and  LIC  businesses
must still follow these.  It is not unknown for customs officials
to be corrupt and/or bribable.

The fourth and final source of Imperial revenue are licence fees.
For just about everything.  Ranging from a few  credits  to  more
than a few.  One such fee which would  be  of  interest  to  free
traders is a Certificate of Spaceworthiness,  granted  each  year
under the authority of the Imperial  Ministry  of  Transportation
by the Starport Authority (cost for COS  inspection  is  Cr10,000
per 100 dt or  part  thereof  ...  and  if  the  ship  fails  the
inspection the fee is still paid).  A ship with an  out  of  date
COS is liable to heavy fines, manditory safety  inspections,  and
may even be grounded.  Additionally, the absence of  an  uptodate
COS will invalidate most ship insurance policies.  On  the  other
hand COS documentation is not routinely  checked  and  so  it  is
possible to avoid paying this ... at least for a time.

Well, I\'ve been using GT rules to run a 3I character dropped into
Menzoberrazan on Aber-Toril (That\'s the big drow city in the Forgotten
Realms, for those of you unfamiliar with the names...). The culture
clash between drow and a 3rd Impy, ex-Navy Intel, ex-Admiral who is also
a high-end psi has been.. interesting. Cosmopolitan space travellers
of the 57th century have a different perspective on "indigenous cultures"
than the locals.

Does that count?

Correct.  The idea is that levying taxes on residents of each of the Imperium\'s 11,000 worlds would require an extraordinarily large bureaucracy and would represent a significant and unnecessary level of interference with planetary affairs.  The tax code can have a big influence on people\'s behavior, so giving the Imperium control over it would represent a large concession of power by local authorities.  Instead, the Imperium tells each planet how much it owes and it is then up to locals to decide whether to implement an income tax, sales tax, property tax, labor conscription, etc.

If for some reason IYTU you want to have the Imperium collect taxes from individuals, you can say that what they usually do is simply set planetary "revenue targets" and then deputize the locals to figure out how to collect it.  That way, in unusual circumstances (like PCs too flush with cash), the Imperium could go after the money directly. 

It\'s a matter of taste, but I prefer to see the 3I as operating on minimalist principles that are more likely to be robust across time and space.  To me, this implies no direct taxation.

This is entirely possible, but given the relatively small number of people this would apply to, it might be more trouble than it\'s worth for Imperial authorities.  Given the breadth of the Imperium though, this practice probably exists somewhere.

There are lots of ways to collect taxes from transients if you really want to.  Local authorities can tax hotels and restaurants in the "Startown" outside the XT Line.  The Imperial authorities can do the same thing just by raising rent on the businesses inside the Line.  The local gov\'t could also put big fees for exchanging cash ICr for local currency, this would hit travellers without hurting business transactions done through banks.  Too many of these little fees and the Imperials make get enough complaints to do something, but local gov\'ts can raise some revenue this way and GMs can use them to annoy players. ;-)

   Again we have inconsistent information. The Sylean Federation
of First Survey is much smaller than than the GIF of -30
indicates that it is. Although the -30 GIF does match the text
better, the the First survey data has almost equal claim to
authority. My handwave for this goes:
   The Sylean Federation had fairly stringent membership
requirements, including the adoption of the full apparatus of
Federation bureacracy. Many planets that did not wish to meet
these standards had various degrees of diplomatic, military, and
economic alliance with the Federation. The Federation itself had
been completely dominated by Sylea. One of Cleon\'s earliest and
most important political victories was the admission of another
high-population world. (Shudusham and Shaaak are good candidates)
The old guard Sylean conservatives lost control of the Senate and
the Federation (as they had feared) and Cleon led the fight for
reduced bureacracy, taxation, and relaxed membership
requirements.
    As membership requirements were relaxed, admission into the
Federation was made (for purposes of law and noble precedence)
retroactive to the time when the reduced requirements had been
met.  This explains the apparent discrepancy in the size of the
late Sylean Federation according to the different maps both
dating to c. -25 IE. By a conservative Sylean standard of
membership, the smaller map is correct. By a later, liberal
standard, the larger one reflects imperial growth better.

The tax code can have a big influence on people\'s behavior, so giving the Imperium control over it would represent a large concession of power by local authorities.  Instead, the Imperium tells each planet how much it owes and it is then up to locals to decide whether to implement an income tax, sales tax, property tax, labor conscription, etc. 

Hm...interesting that the Imperium doesn\'t interfere in tariffs, given that its theoretical purpose is to encourage interstellar trade.  The most plausible imperial taxes would be things like registration fees for starships, fees for use of imperial services, etc (income tax requires knowing how much you make, which is relatively difficult)

Not really.  If you want an effective thrusting weapon that can be used well in inconvenient gravity, go for a spear.  It has the additional benefit that you can have a convenient impromptu spear with this device called a \'bayonet\' ;)

OTOH, compare with Frank Herberts /Orange Catholic Bible/ quotes in his Dune
series. In the same lines, has anyone read the Warriors of Spider, Way of
Spider, and Web of Spider? Very interesting, wonderful characters, and an
intriguing take on religion. And some good Traveller bits, just ignore the

There are formulae in Pocket Empires for calculating the tax rate. Although
this is M0 and a Pocket Empire is by definition pre-imperial, it works as a
local tax rate - the only real issue is whether you treat the imperial levy as
an additional "discretionary" (in PE terms) tax or as something covered by the
existing rate.

Just as an aside, I think the EU, which has a similar relationship to its member
states, mostly recovers revenue from a share in indirect (ie sales) tax - there
is an agreed minimum rate of 15% within Europe (although in the UK we pay 17.5%,
this rate originally introduced to cover the cost of the poll tax disaster).

If you don\'t have PE then you can get hold of Stuart Ferris\'
excellent WBD program which includes the PE tax calculations.

	On the other hand, if large corporations could escape taxation
	simply by not setting up shop on an Imperial member world
	(prefering instead to locate on asteroids, in otherwise

A Loong, Loong time ago ... when I was just a newbie player ...

My GM used these same guidelines.  The X was 2% but it was on 
everything you owned and it only happened every five years.  So if 
you made no money those five years, you actually lost value.  ie.  
You have a ship.  You pay 2% in taxes every five years on the value 
of the ship.  The IRS agents (I can\'t remember the acronym he 
used) were quite brutish about how the estimated value. :)  But this 
was only for people who didn\'t have a fixed address (like scouts).  
Now that I think back, I can\'t remember exactly HOW he justified it.  
I just know that during the time we played I had two adventures 
where I had to hide all my goodies \'cause the taxman cometh.

IMTU, I just make the PC\'s deduct 2% from their pay and profits.  
No muss, no fuss and they think they are getting away with 
something.

Not really.  If you set up on an independent planetoid, either you\'re claiming to be another planet (in which case you owe imperial taxes, like any planet) or you claim to be under the jurisdiction of another planet (in which case you owe whatever that planet collects).

The article you might be thinking about was referring to changing the rank 
_symbols_, not the rank names.  Thus a O-4 in the Navy will have the same 
rank device as an O-4 in the Marines which is the same device as the Army, 
even though the Navy rank name differs from that of the Marines and Army.

- - 101 Starships for GURPS Traveller Release 4

A free 101 Book from BITS compiled by Rob Prior. This has statistics and
descriptions for over 200 GT starships in an easy to use Acrobat file
giving an excellent referee aid. Note this file is big! (1Mb). Linked off
the \'Archive\' Page, this file is also mirrored at Freelance Traveller. An
apology for Rob for the delay in posting this update.

- - Internal Trade Map of the Sylean Federation in M0

A map of the internal trade routes in the Sylea subsector in M0, compiled
from data produced by Thad Coons using GURPS Traveller\'s \'Far Trader\'.
There are some notes on the accuracy with the link, which may be found in
the archive page. The file is an Acrobat PDF.

- - GenCon UK 99 pictures.

The first batch of these pictures are now up (linked off the Travelling
page). A number of TML members make a showing, as does the BITS stand. All
the TML members will be uploaded to a separate site (my own) to add to the
collection of pictures to faces...


The rest of the site mods are bug fixes and clean ups.

Enjoy,

The Imperium collects from worlds, not individuals. Thus, you are basically

     All Licensed Imperial Corporations (LICs) have to pay Imperial taxes.  As
for other folks homesteading the asteroids to avoid taxes, consider this a
subsidy of out-system settlements which partially compensates for the dangers
inherent in such enterprises (see the Sunbeard Declaration).

I\'m not sure of this.  I\'ve seen many references (though I can\'t recall where) to planetary authority ending at either the edge of the atmosphere or the 100d limit of the mainworld.  Everything else the Imperium owns.  I don\'t know how this works for asteroid main worlds.

Striker II has the following 3I TOs:

Imperial Marine Task Force
Imperial Guard Jump Infantry Regiment
Household Cavalry Regiment: "The Emperor\'s Hammer"
4518th Lift Infantry Regiment (the Duke of Regina\'s Own Huscarles), 
circa 1116
Imperial Marine Armoured Cavalry Regiment

So no, it doesn\'t have a different lift infantry unit.

This does come from DGP, specifically from "The Uniforms of the Terran
Occupation Force," TD #14.  It\'s said that Martin V (456-457) ordered a
common rank insignia because he couldn\'t keep the various service insignia
straight.

Personally, I think that\'s one thing that could be dropped.  I\'d prefer to
see Imperial uniforms follow the British or European model, where each
regiment has slightly diferent uniform regs and the services all have
distinctly different insignia of rank.  The "Joint Imperial Services" rank
system DGP proposed is far too "Yanks in Space" for my taste.  I doubt an
emperor of one year could force the entire Imperial armed forces to switch
rank insignia and make it stick after he died.

TD #14 also gives a novel system for Marine enlisted ranks, which
apparently do not follow a "joint" scheme.  I\'ll post or e-mail details of
both systems if desired.

Nope: but it\'s not hard to extrapolate.  Drop the jump infantry from the
4518th and reduce it to a three or four battalion force (depending on
taste: do you like triangular or square units?).

		Not really.  If you want an effective thrusting weapon that

Yeah, but it doesn\'t have the gliz and glam of fencing for your naval now

Though you are of course, completely right. Bayonet\'s are better even just

think in the Faulklands a bunch of Argies got routed by a good old Bayonet

What about you ex-mil types out there. Did Bayonet drill get the juices

I agree.  I saw the Branagh Hamlet the other week, and that\'s my Imperium.
Regimental uniforms and lots of gold braid.  Now, a common insignia scheme
would be useful when you have a Field Army with close to 50 different
Regiments in it...

Probably change it to four infantry/tank companies per battalion.

More than anything, I needed it for the head count.  Supply and
transportation are headaches on Earth.  In spce, they\'re brain-splitting

And if you are a ship, you must be registered at a homeport. For instance
(from memory) Jamieson Factors is registered at Regina. My guess would be
that megacorps (and other trans-sector companies) must have one "homeport"
in every sector.

I *would* be interested to hear Jim MacLean\'s thoughts on how non-Imperial
visitors are treated in imperial space. Does the Big I worry about
protecting internal trade from external markets? Are there tariffs to enter
the Imperium?? Or does revenue come from an alien starship paying for
quarantine/spaceworthiness/whatever inspections???

There would have to be something in place (IMHO) or else companies close to
the border would set up on nearby client-states. I base this on a similar
reasoning IMTU (which Jim confirmed, BTW!) that says: "Rents for businesses
incorporated *within* the extrality line are at least equal to the local
world\'s tax rate" (and are usually more). This encourages them to stay on
the other side of the line, where the locals can deal with them, thus
freeing the Imperium of some bureaucracy.

I *hope* this is going to be in Starports.

Well, you could say that the same number of pips in the same position
denotes the same rank, and let regiments pick their style of pip (like the
British Army has different buttons for each regiment)  So it\'s only a
cosmetic difference, not a substantive one.

Just a note: The enlisted insignia there are exactly as described in TD#14
until you reach the senior sergeants. In TD#14, an E-7 would have one pip
on top, and one on bottom. An E-8 adds one on the left, E-9 adds one on the
right as well.  Senior NCOs in a unit have a sunburst instead, alone for a
company SNCO (usually an E-7), with wreath for the battalion SNCO (an E-8)
and with crown for the Regimental SNCO (an E-9).  Whether this can be
sanitized and recycled is above my pay grade.

On the ranks themselves, I think Book 4 and MT both give canonical Marine
rank titles that are different from yours.  Armsman is a bit different (It
reminds me of David Weber\'s Graydon, is the title used somewhere else?) 
"Marine" vice "Private" seems sensible.

You\'re not kidding.  I tried to design an assault transport for a regiment
under GT.  It\'s a huge ship, c. 50,000 tons, I think.  Actually keeping
units supplied could be a nightmare across interstellar distances.  One
thing to look at is how much could be done to make logistics units
effective scavengers, subsisting on the local sources of supply wherever
possible.

However, the Household Cavalry Regiment does include a lift infantry
battalion, with the following assets listed (_Striker II, pg. 140)*:

Battalion Headquarters, with:
  1 operational command stand
  1 Imperial Commnad grav APC
  2 staff uplink Imperial Command grav APCs
  1 staff radio Imperial Commnad grav APC
3 Lift Infantry Companies, each with:
  Command Post Section, with:
    1 operatiopnal command stand
    1 staff uplink Commnad grav APC
    1 TL15 Convertible Air Raft
  3 Lift Infantry Platoons, each with:
    1 tactical command stand
    1 Imperial Command grav APC
    3 Infantry Squads, each with:
      1 tactical commnad stand
      2 infantry stands
      1 Imperial grav APC
Grav Tank Compnay, with:
  Company Headquarters, with:
    1 tactical command Heavy Command Grav Tank
    2 self-ordering Heavy Grav Tanks
  3 Grav Tank Platoons, each with:
    1 tactical command Heavy Grav Tank
    4 self-ordering Heavy Grav Tanks
Artillery Battery, with:
  Battery Headquarters, with:
    1 operational command stand
    1 Imperial FDC Grav APC
  2 MRL Sections, each with:
    1 tactical command MRL Artillery Vehicle
    3 MRL Artillery Vehicles
  Drone Missile Section, with:
    1 operational command RDM Artillery Vehicle
    3 RDM Artillery Vehicles

All personnel stands are equipped with TL14 heavy battle dress.

Infantry stands are armed with TL14 4.7cm fusion rifles, TL15 portable
Tac missiles, and integral TL15 5.1cm fusion rifles.  Single figure
command stands are also armed with TL14 4.7cm fusion rifles.

The Imperial Command Grav APC is identical to the Imperial FDC APC but
without the FDC fitted.

I would also recommend Orson Scott Card\'s _Speaker for the Dead_ and

It would have worked better if we hadn\'t just had a block of instruction on
soviet equipment, including the AKM (longer that the M16A1) and it\'s
bayonet (longer than ours....)

http://www.ultranet.com/~eclipse/SV/TRAV/TravSwords.shtml

Since T4 added the fencing (with a sword, not moving hot comm units) skill, 
and made such a fuss about Nobles dueling, I would like to see what a well 
dressed M-0 Sylean noble carried.

Granddad\'s old rapier still would have been TL-10, even if he got from his 
Granddad, TL 9. It would light, strong, hold a good edge, and be very 
expensive.
Engraving, craftsmanship, like the Sylean TL 10 revolver. For Nobles, made 
by one of a few well known sword makers. A particular sword could be 
associated with various noble titles. "The Snartbartfast Blade is only 
carried by the Count (Countess) of Snartbartfast." Ownership is passed 
along with the title. Knightly orders may have a blade that is presented to 
it\'s members when they are knighted. Sort of like a KofC blade, but more 
functional.

& for more practical military use I rambled on with...

    The ax would be your best bet.  The classic E.E. "Doc" Smith Space Ax. 
Made out of very dense, high tech material, with a cutting edge and a 
piercing spike.  It\'s a weapon requiring skill to weld effectively against 
armored foes.  An armored knight feared a skilled foe with a poniard more 
than a peasant with a bill hook.
    An idea I had was for a retractable \'ice pick\' of crystaliron or SD 
material built into the forearm of Battle Dress.  Like the poniard of old, 
it would be used against the weak points of armor.  Such as the joints or 
faceplace.

In Striker II, a regular infantry stand represents four soldiers, while
a command stand represents one soldier.

Thus, the Lift Infantry Battalion/Household Cavalry Regiment has 54 fire
team stands (216 personnel); 41 command stands (41 personnel); plus crew
for the following vehicles:  10 Command Grav APCs; 5 staff uplink
Command Grav APCs; 1 staff radio Command Grav APCs; 27 Grav APCs; 3
Convertible Air Rafts; 18 Heavy Grav Tanks; 1 FDC APC; 8 MRL Artillery
Vehicles; and 4 RDM Artillery Vehicles (I don\'t have crew numbers
ready-to-hand for these vehicles).

That should help you determine the lift requirements to move a Lift
Infantry battalion (logistic support, of course, is extra).

Lasers, obliviously.  IMTU, they\'re *WAY* too fragile to use as a polearm.  Also, the various F/PGMPs.  Way too heavy without the gravitic thang that helps you heft it, though it\'d make a mediocre club...

        I have worked one up that calculates the "Return On Investment"
(ROI) of a vessel per annum.  Its based on a pretty straight-foward set of
calculations.  If you wish, I can post the algorithm here or mail it to you.
I belive that this is what you see on Paul\'s site.
        Of particular note is that the ROI calculations I use are base-lined
on containerized freight, not speculative traffic.  This is mostly because I
have yet to sit down and do 10000 iterations of a trade-cycle between three
worlds with a type-A to establish what a "typical" speculative ton will
earn, gross.  I know, I am lazy.  ;-)  However, any vessel that can make an
ROI of 0% (break even) or better per annum on hauling boxes, would seem to
be capable of doing better than that on a reasonably selected speculative
route.  
        Further, the ROI algorithim does not average out what battle-damage
costs need to be absorbed across the year.  The presumtion is that an
unarmed vessel will not go where it can be molested, and that few Corsairs
will take a crack at an adequately armed ship, since getting killed is bad
for the bottom line ;-).

- - --
Certainly not a classical canon source, but previously published GT
material: Efate\'s 102nd Lift Infantry Battalion is listed in GT:SM. From the
copy it appears that the 102nd, like the 4518th was Imperialized in the 5th
Frontier War. Unlike the 4518th it appears that after the war Efate has
hired it out as a Merc unit to "gain experience which could then be of
benefit to other units back on Efate, and let others pay for the upkeep of
the unit."

An extensive organizational structure is given (GT:SM p111). Like other
pre-existing GT material (the BD that shall remain nameless) barring a black
magic marker I\'m afraid it\'s new canon. The text says they are a TL12
equipped unit. I suppose if they don\'t fit the pattern of a Lift-Infantry
Battalion as you see it you can explain it away as they having been
specially equipped and organized when they started taking Merc tickets, and
that they do not fit Imperial norm. It does say all infantry are BD
equipped, which I believe was your contention for TL12 troops.

Hoe constrained are you be pre-existing GT publications?  SJGames is
developing quite a list of existent material. Each one seems to draw the
lines a little tighter, especially if they don\'t want to repeat IG\'s mistake
of contradictory canon.

 You\'re not kidding.  I tried to design an assault transport for a regiment
 under GT.  It\'s a huge ship, c. 50,000 tons, I think.  Actually keeping
 units supplied could be a nightmare across interstellar distances.  One
 thing to look at is how much could be done to make logistics units
 effective scavengers, subsisting on the local sources of supply wherever
 possible. >>

Makes you wonder about the game designers assumptions in IE and FFW. I had to 
send some stuff to Doug from IE, and I noticed that certain Squadrons had 
certain lift capabilities in the games. A CruRon could carry a Regiment 
equivalent, a Batron could carry a Division, and an Assault transport 
Squadron (their description, and it makes me think that according to the 
title, these troops are landed in "hot" zones; not just carried from system A 
to B...) could GET THIS - carry a Field Army (equal to five Corps in this 
game) and another Corps! I guess there must be some friggen big (megaton?) 
troop transports in the squadron...

I would expect the bayonet to be a viable weapon as long as there are long
weapons stout enough to support it\'s use.  Having said that, I would expect
to see bayonets used by troops in security/crowd control situations.
Possibly Marines on perimeter duty, but mostly soldiers in Combat Armor, not
Battle Dress, against lightly armed civilian/irregulars. It\'s much more
effective to break up a crowd using fixed bayonets than to fire into the
crowd with gauss guns. Fewer casualties and better press.

"Lieutenant, clear the square."
"Yes sir! Sergeant--"
"Fix Bayonets! By rank forward--"
And the crowd pushed back, the sweating sophont mass fleeing the wall of
glinting steel blades.

I don\'t think this is off-topic at all, but I think the answers depend
on the specific views and understanding of the believers that you
describe (21st century Terrans, or their descendants).  Naming the
religions to which they belong is not enough information; we need a lot
more detail.  How rigid are the dogmas to which they adhere?  What are
the tenets of these dogmas?

It\'s a perennial, but not quite done to death.  

In my Traveller Universe, the Imperium does not tax citizens.  The
Imperium collects something from its member states.  It may collect
money, but maybe materials or draftees or something else instead; it
depends.  This process is much like tribute, as known on Terra for much
of its history.  The process is also not unlike medieval European
lord-vassal relations.  The member states get almost total autonomy, the
protection of the Imperial naval/military establishment, and access to
the interstellar marketplace.  In return, they pledge allegiance to the
Emperor, allow the Imperium to build a starport, grant extrality there,
allow Imperial forces to use the world and system, and pay something.  

Member states levy taxes as they see fit.  The 11,000 worlds of the
Imperium probably have 110,000 variations on tax regimes.

Every citizen of the Imperium is a citizen of some member state, and
subject to taxation according to the laws of that member state. 
Imperial law and policy (remember, it\'s really not a government of laws)
prevents member states from causing serious harm to interstellar
commerce and the peace of the realm.  This includes harm caused by
excessive taxation.  

The PCs gallivanting around the Imperium making money may have reporting
obligations to their home worlds.  Their home worlds may lose track of
them completely.  The Imperium may or may not help the home worlds find
their citizens.  (It depends a lot on how much tax revenue is at
stake.)  

I started this essay by saying that the Imperium does not tax citizens. 
"Citizen" is a term of Imperial law that means a sophont with Imperial
citizenship.  Corporations are not citizens.  The Imperium does tax LICs
and other organizations with Imperial registration.

With a calculator, you can replace the sqrt(1-(v^2/c^2)) with
cos(arcsin(v^2/c^2)). *Much* easier. 

A good pair of test values is that .6 c has a tau factor of .8. thus
	cos(arcsin(.6))=.8

On my calculator that\'s:

The trick is that it days *weeks* to hit 30% of c.

Since it\'s given in the official stuff that it\'s not possible to know
*before* you jump, and also that by dint of *much* extra calculation,
squadrons can reduce the "spread" in their exit times, it\'s clear that
you can have *some* effect before jump. But you still won\'t know
*until* you jump. 

That leaves two possibilities.

1. once you enter jumpo, you know how long until exit, but you can\'t do
   anything about it. 
2. you only know that you are about to exit jump shortly before
   exiting when <something> happens to the instument readings or to the
   jump bubble.

I think I\'ve seen some misjump tables that have the time in jump being
extra long. I\'m not sure if they are official. And I don\'t recall them
giving any indication as to which of the above is right. 

#1 is easier (in some ways) on the players. But #2 has it\'s points as
well. Consider a misjump that\'s going to last 2 weeks instead of 1. 

In case #1, you\'ll know it as soon as you enter jump, and have to start
conserving. And maybe you get to play the old game of "But there\'s only
enough air for 5 people for that long, and we\'ve got 6 people".

In case 2, everything is ok until around day 8. At which point things
get ugly, because you won\'t know how much longer the ship will be in
jump. 

Both have their points. I\'m more inclined towards #1.

For ship\'s, you can use the "instaneous velocity" to figure the time
dilation at that point. Doing anything else requires using hyperbolic
functions. Which are sufficiently messy that I avoid that sort of
thing.

That sort of thing goes in in Latin America too. Seems to be something

I\'ll leave Pocket Empires aside, because I haven\'t done any economic
analysis of it\'s tax structure, but the Cr500/citizen from _TCS_, if applied
to the Imperium, is enough to fund a fleet many times larger than various
canonical descriptions imply. Even the 3% that _Striker_ claims is average
for Imperial planets is too much.

As for the Imperial bureacracy, I suspect (but don\'t have the calculations
to back this) that the 2% of the company that you have to give to the
Emperor in order to get an Imperial charter would be enough to fund it.

I don\'t think that a tax is necessary given that the Emperor owns a minimum
of 2% of each company (That little detail has the added effect that creative
accounting means that you\'re cheating the Emperor...)

Surely the best way to encourage trade is to have no tariffs at all?

I really think that has to be a gross simplification. A slogan, perhaps,
but not an accurate description of the true state of affairs. Going back
to the formative years of the Imperium, we know that it often persuaded
pocket empires and strong high-population worlds to join peacefully. They
could hardly have done that if they had insisted that any colonies and
outposts these worlds owned outside their 100 diameter limits would become
Imperial property.

"The space between the worlds" is propably jumpspace, not interplanetary
space. Of course, for practical purposes the Imperium would have to have
some form of jurisdiction in interplanetary space in order to control
jumpspace, but to the extent of _owning_ everything off the mainworld? I
don\'t believe it.

>I don\'t know how this works for asteroid main worlds.

Eaxctly.

	This depends on some other factors:  If your \'world\' is not
	an Imperial member, then you are not subject to Imperial
	taxation, but you might have to pay duties to do business in
	the Imperium.

	This is how I see it.  If you want to do business on more than
	one Imperial world, you need a LIC.  If you do business in one
	system, you need to pay tax to the system government (usually).
	If you are doing cross-border business, there are Imperial

How many jumps per year, and to what kind of starport is your

I was just thinking, as I noodled around with a Free Trader on the 
Spinward Main for an hour or so a few weeks back. I noticed that
Dinon (1811 Lanth/Spinward Marches), a necessary stop for a Jump-1
ship on the Spinward Main, had no fuel sources on-planet. The gas giant
was a week\'s travel away from the mainworld, costing a Free Trader
pretty much a full starport visit for that trade year. 

Unexpected repairs. Administrative delays. Crew problems - if one
guy is your Steward, your Medic, and your Gunner, can you
fly if he\'s sick, hurt or gets a better job offer?

I know there\'s no way to reliably model such things, just like Battle
Damage, but I\'m wondering if small company or single-ship merchant
operations can meet the efficiency (jumps per year) of a larger line.
If a lower efficiency is expected, should it be reflected in a lower ROI?

Right now I\'m trying to work out the transportation "slice" required per
trooper.  How many total displacement tons of ship are needed to transport
one man and 2dt of equipment/vehicle through one Jump-4.  Once I have that
number, I can figure how much tonnage is required for the various units.

I tend to use 2, but assume that the players get hints that they have
misjumped (nausea etc) and an idea of the magnitude (scrutinising
engineering records very closely eg the jumpgrid firing sequence vs the
powerplant zuchai array and the jump governer and the time base).

Players of \'Delta 3 is down\' will know what I mean ;-)

We have obtained Marc Miller\'s permission to post these extra adventures at

Because of real life events this was deferred. We\'ll try and get the

In answer to John\'s query, the two add-in scenarios were (hopefully) fun

I don\'t think that works.  Two points:

*) As far  as  we  know  a  ship  in  jumpspace  is  in  complete
   isolation.  Therefore, "owning  jumpspace"  is  a  meaningless
   concept.

*) There are numerous references to the starport XT line and  how
   it is *outside* planetary jurisdiction.

I think the term "atmospheric boundary" is  a  "slogan"  term  as
atmospheres don\'t have boundaries but fizzle out (IIRC traces  of
Earth\'s atmosphere have been detected on the moon, and very faint
traces of Venus atmosphere are blown back by the solar wind  like
a comet tail that stretches out  to  Earth\'s  orbit!).  I  prefer
using "suborbital" as the boundary line for each world  or  major
satellite (this gets around the problem with vacuum worlds), with
standard approaches to/from starports also being  Imperium-owned,
or goverened by local treaties.  There is nothing to say  that  a
planetary government\'s jurisdiction has to be contiguous (IIRC in
the Solomani Rim some mainworlds are owned by  other  mainworlds)
... so I see no problem with colony worlds.

The only problems with this model are asteroid belts and  orbital
habitats.  And they are  not  problems,  just  not  catered  for.
Possibly, in these  cases  there  is  N  kilometer  distance  for
planetary jurisdiction (where N is based in object size).

Of course, there could be areas of  confusion  over  jurisdiction
... it\'s in the best interests  of  the  lawyers!  (Something  to
remember when you run a murder  mystery  adventure  and  the  PCs
think its over when they find the villain.)

This tangent made me think about the likelihood of some truely stupendous
supply depots.  The Imperium has had centuries to build up strategic
reserves of supplies.  I think the prevailing materials and packaging
technology would allow some weapons, gear, and food to be socked away in a
vault for centuries, and still unpack as nearly new.  Of course, such
depots/armories would require some security overhead, being prime targets
for thieves or opposing forces.  I can also possibly see there being a
network of secret supply caches scattered in all kinds of unlikely places,
in addition to the obvious depots.  This only applies to defensive or
suppression campaigns, but that\'s not really a major issue for the 3I.

From the M:0 perspective, which is where I\'m working from, I might think
about placing undiscovered strategic supply vaults from the RoM or even Ziru
Sirka.  Imagine the political/economic/military implications of discovering
a large hidden cache of TL12 ironmongery in a small pocket empire or
balkanized world.

is essentially the same as that of the late Roman emperors, that is,
the spokesman for God in the Imperial Catholic church, the "Defender
of the Faith", the holder of dozens of specific religious titles, along
with the diplomatic snares and opportunities that come with each.
Since there is no mention of an associated church heirarchy, my
assumption is uncanonical.

Imperial "Christianity", (if that\'s what it would be), however, would
make a fascinating study in religion, with a blend of traditions reaching
back to Vilani and Sylean religion as well as Solomani.  I see a
liturgical system with its roots in the Orthodox, borrowing from the
non-Christian and Christian liturgies alike from the other human centers.
I see a heirarchical system like that of the old Roman church -- the
massive concentration of power is with the Emperor, not the Bishop.
If I were emperor, in fact, I\'d make sure the bishops were firmly under
my thumb (or at least not threats).

Of course, the 3I might not be Christian at all; however, it\'s hard
for our group to understand the Imperium.  Giving it a non-Western
worldview would only make it more inscrutable, and we\'re a lazy bunch.
Seeing it much as we see our world, with a Western view, grounds our
wandering imaginations enough to be useful.  And our Western view
is this: of the individual and progress, with government, corporations,
and religion forming the three bases upon which we struggle.

Starport extrality is a different thing entirely than the Imperium
\'owning the spaces between the stars\'; it is the same thing as that a
country\'s embassy is considered part of that country, NOT the host
country.

Jurisdictional matters over space will vary from system to system. Rich,
high pop systems will own and police their own system out to the Oort
cloud, although IN craft will certainly be immune.

Some systems will leave policing their space \'space\' (in the sense like
airspace) to the IN.

Asteroids are owned by whoever owns them, just like planets, or orbital
habs. 

The Imperium isn\'t all that pervasive in the OTU. Systems have annual
payments to the Imperium, in return they get protection by the IN, a
guarantee of reasonably free trade, etc. How the systems raise that
money is entirely up to them. IMTU berthing and cargo transfer fees,
plus higer sales taxes on all the shops around startown provide the vast
majority of the moneies for Imperial taxes. 

Local taxes are another thing entirely, though.

Characters:
    Dr. Christine Jeffries (Doctor)
    Baron William Richter (Noble) [Unable to attend session III for work
reasons]
    Anton Dev (Scout w/Courier)
    Max Fu Zhen (Marine)

Don\'t go looking for session I & II, session I was a character creation
session, and session II was used to bring the characters together and
set up this new, longer session ...

...as the game opens, Anton is crawling around in the Starport garbage
dump (beneath the terminal), the Baron is hiding in the automated
baggage handling area, while the good Doctor and Max are currently
\'guests\' of the Imperial Marines on board the cruiser Intrepid...

Anton, realizing that being in the midst of food service refuse was
probably a bad idea, crawled back up one of the chutes.  After a bit of
a struggle, he managed to fall out of the chute and into a kitchen.  He
then demanded to see the manager with all of his SOC-2 bluster.  In
reality, he just managed to convince the manager to get StarPort
security.  They arrive and easily convince Anton that he needs a shower,
which they escort him to.

On the way, Anton makes up a rather hard to beleive story abot being
thrown down the chute as a practical joke, and would they be amenable
for hire to make a return practical joke..  The two security escorts
don\'t believe him for two reasons:  No one has reported seeing anyone
dumped into the chute and no one heard anyone calling for help, and the
marines had let them know that fugitives from Imperial Justice were
loose in the StarPort...

While Anton is showering the muck off himself and his clothes, and
arranging for a loose fiitting coverall as a temporary replacement, the
security people contact the marines, two of which great Anton as he is
leaving the shower.  Anton looks at the two heavily armed marines and
goes with them without resistance.

On board the Intrepid, question of the prisoners begins.  Among those to
be questioned are Anton, the Dr, amd Max.  The Doctor is brought in
first.  Her first effort is to try and act in shock and terrified.  The
Interrogator has her stunned and continues the questioning when she
recovers.

It is determined that she honestly did not know that she was involved
with ancient artifact smugglers, she was returned to her cell and Max
was brought in from his cell.  It is also quickly determined that he
/knew/ something was going on and chose to ignore it as long as his
position of bodyguard to the four scientists did not endanger innocents
or protect mass murderers.  He was taken back to his cell, and Anton was
brought in.

Anton tries to deny any knowledge of illegal activities, but it comes
out that his scout-ship was hired to transport cargos uninspected. 
Which is a pretty strong argument about it.  Evidence was lacking about
his knowledge of aartifact smuggling, so he to was released.

Since the three PC\'s were not in on the smuggling, but were not morally
clean, it was decided to use them for a run to Yori as payment for thier
cirme.  The Imperium wanted an emergency lowberth (4 tons, 4 people)
delivered to the Research Station there with the contents alive.  Do to
problems on Yori, (the Yori For Yorans [YFY)), it is felt that a guard
should be placed on the the \'berth.  A doctor is required to monitor the
\'berth, and of course a ship and pilot are also needed.  The players are
breifed and given a week to get the ship ready for departure or be
sentenced to a penal colony.  The three are quick to agree.

The first hurdle to overcome was that a classic scout has only three
tons of cargo space.  It does, however, have a four ton bay with an
airraft.  Anton seemed reluctant to leave the airraft behind (fearing it
would not be here when he returned).  SO he hired a mechanic to
disassemble the airraft and put the peices in the cargo hold.  Then he
spent some time and found a small cargo to take up the rest of the hold
(a mere 1 tom of spsce).  Then he found an ex-scout who wanted to
acquire a couple of rare lizards from Yori for a zoo, a Gavin Bill.

Max, appalled to discover that the hull breaching chargees he had in his
travel cases had been confiscated by the Imperials, traded some
expensive booze and a few credits for a few doses of combat drug, and a
couple of basic grenades, under the guise of \'might be needed in the
discharge of his duties\'.  Then he went a purchased a large amount of
expensive booze and boarded the scout.

The doctor, it is discovered, has a pressing desire to know how to do
just about everything, and purchased a large number of books on topics
running the gamut of subjects.  A few of titles  she purchased are: 
_Starship Engineering for Dummies_, _Drawing a Bead: Theory and Practice
of Marksmanship_, and _Introduction to Xenobiology, the First Year_. 
She also visited a gem shop and puchease a handful of gems which glow
when warmed.

When all was ready, and the \'berth secured in the makshift cargo area,
they left the planet without incident (unless you count straying into a
restricted airspace early into the lift).  The run upto jump wa
suneventful, and the transition was made without incident.

During the jump, Anton was kept busy keeping the doctor out of the
sensitive areas of the 
ship (not an easy task as the doctor is better with computers), the
doctor trying to get into the engine room \'just for a quick look, I\'m
not going to /touch/ anything!\' and pestering the single passenger
(Gavin) as she tries to keep him entertained, while Max takes a perverse
pleasure in discussing obscure (and possibly invented) philosphy systems
with Gavin.  Fortunately, the jump is a normal one and the ship
translates back to normal space without event.

Traffic in the Yori system is non-existant, which is a good thing as the
ship does not have anyone present who can competantly run the sensors,
and they have been set to collision warning mode and left there.  The
descent to the starport from orbit proceeds uneventuflly until eight
minutes from touchdown.  An alert from the starport catches everyone by
surprise.

Missile launch from the surface, acceleration profile and size indicate
a missle.  Course indicates the target is the scout ship.  The scout
ship aapears oblivious to the missle.  Anton tries a desperate manuever
(not having brought the evade software online) and the missle corrects
and impacts the top of the ship with a sound like a broken gong.  The
control panels and all of the lights on the bridge go out, interior iris
valves all snap open with a hiss,  while the hatches all unlock with
mutted thunks.

[for the curious- Missile rolled 4 hits, 1 hull, 3 computer]

Anton, not immediately aware of what is wrong, sends Max to look in on
the power plant, and the doctor to check the computer, while he checks
the control boards and tries to stop the scout ship now uncontrolled
descent without instruments.  The doctor manages, with a spectacular
effort to bring the pilots station online just in time to turn an
uncontrolled crash into a barely controlled impact into the desert
floor.

The sound like a gong being pounded by a maniac, then with a suddeness
of an electrical switch, the grav plates shut down and everyone is
dropped to the ceiling.  In the utter silence of complete shutdown is
punctated by the hissing of liquid hydrogen flashing into a gas along
the hull of the ship.

[again - impact caused five hits, 3 hull, 1 fuel and a computer, decided
that since the computers were on top, the ship has rolled over during
its\' slide and is now upside down in the desert, with the front half
buried under the sand.  Unfirtunatle, the doctor was still in the
computer campartment ...]

Everyone checks in, except for the passenger and the doctor.  Max checks
on the passenger, and fins Gavin hiding in a corner of his room, tells
him to stay there.  Then he descends into the upper bay :-) and finds
the doctor bleeding and severly injured amidst the ruins of the
computer.  He had previously picked up his medical slow and he gives her
an injection to stabilize her, bandages he up, and then leaves her
there.  Whatever shot at them is probably going to try and make sure
they are gone.

Meanwhile, Anton is rippping panelling up and using manual shutoff
valves to limit the amount of explosive hydrogen venting into the
atmosphere and building up the exposed fuel tank.

Both Max and Anton then return to main room of the ship and Max goes
back to Gavin and tells him to go hide away from the ship.  Then he and
Anton set up a mobile comm uing and send out a mayday to the starport,
and the research station.  Help is on the way, but it will take time. 
Max checks the horizonand sees a plume of dust heading in thier general
direction (not moving and getting closer).  He repeats that hostiles may
be inbound and the Research Station reports that a group of Marines ar
on thier way.  Anton meanwhile has checked on the condition of the
\'berths, and they are ticking away just fine.

Max decides that no one in the approaching vehicle is likey to be
interested in leaving them alive, so he and Anton fuse the manual
controls on the airraft hatch and rigged up several grenade bombs out by
the two accessible hatches, leaving the third (farthest from the airraft
bay, available.

Bad guys arrive and an explosion announces that they have found one of
the traps.  A quick firefight ensues and the players get a quick lesson
in just how nasty grenades are, how tough PCs are in general, and how
effificent the Marines are in destroying a ATV with a Grav APC.  The
players dropped most of the attackers, but a few were getting away ...

The marines held the sight ofr the players while a tech crew arrived to
move the \'berths to the Research Station.  The doctor was taken to a
hospital at the Starport for treatment and observation.  Gavin took his
leave and went hunting for hist lizards.  Max went with the Marines and
sold them a lot of booze and Anton went with tug which came to carry
hist poor, wrecked scout to the Starport for repair.

[END-OF-SESSION]

Next time:  Anton is sending a request for instructions on what to do
with the wreck to the nearest starport, Dr. Jeffries will be released
from the hospital and sell her gems to the locals, and Max will find out
what the Research Station is studying and may get a call out for help in
time ... and if we\'re lucky, Baron Ricter will rejoin the group,
possibly under duress from the Family (who were behind the Ancient
Smuggling scheme).

	Early on in the planning of Far Trader we considered including a
"TCS-style" game of competition between megacorps.  After we (and
all other GT authors) were sternly admonished that we were writing
for an RPG, not a wargame, we dropped the idea.  After that we
considered LICs only to the extent that they would be part of the
back-drop and provide foils for the PCs.  This is all by way of
saying that we didn\'t get into the details of LICs to deeply because
our priorities were elsewhere.
	That said, LICs will likely have rights and privelages over and
above those of other off-world investors.  Worlds are required by the
Imperium to treat off-world investors the same way they treat local
investors, but they *can* prevent off-worlders from investing in the
first place.  For instance, even in the modern US there are limits on
foreign ownership of farmland, media outlets, and companies with
sensitive military technologies.  Most other countries in the world
bar foreign banks.  LICs will have greater rights on such worlds, and
world governments may even be required to give them all the rights 
of locals.
	As for Imperial enforcement and requirements, there may or may
not be a maximum asset value off-worlders can hold without being LICs.
Taxes could be assessed during the MoCs periodic review of the LIC\'s
certification.  Given the slow pace of communication in the 3I, this
could be once only every few years.

	The 3I could restrict trade when it thought there was a good 
reason for doing so (like with the Zhos).  The response will depend
on the state of diplomatic relations with the foreign government.
Otherwise, the 3I gains strength from increased trade 
(see "The Lifeblood of the Imperium" FT, pg.6).  The sort of trade 
protectionism that we see in the RW is unlikely to be a factor for 
the Imperium as a whole simply because it is so big.  

Border worlds are free to establish discriminatory tariffs against 
outsiders if they don\'t want the competition with their domestic 
industries or if they prefer not to deal with them.  The Imperium
requires that tariffs be at least twice as high for foreigners as
member worlds (FT, pg.5), but worlds are also free to make them higher.

"Quarantine/spaceworthiness/whatever" issues for foreign vessels 
I\'ll leave to my co-author, Chris Thrash, since this is his area.

	The Imperium does not itself levy trade tariffs because its purpose 
is to encourage trade and tariffs would be counter-productive.  Imperial 
starports do charge the sorts of fees you mention simply as a way to recoup 
their costs.
	GT: Far Trader (pg.5) says that while member worlds are greatly encouraged 
to have minimal tariffs, they are not required to.  First and foremost, high 
tariffscreate an incentive for smuggling and other adventure hooks, so I didn\'t 
want to eliminate that possibility.  The in game rationale is also reasonable.  
Some worlds may have legitimate economic, political, or cultural reasons to 
discourage off-world trade. Better that they do it through tariffs rather than
less visible and more commercially damaging means (viz. many Real World trade 
disputes).

	I think there\'s evidence that megacorps may in fact do exactly that.
In BtC, it says that Milagro (an Imperial Client State in District 268) is
home to a massive Ling Standard Products that people speculate has been
set up to avoid Imperial laws.  If this got out of hand in a way that harmed
Imperial interests, I\'m sure the Dukes could get together to pressure the
CS and megacorp.

I said no such thing.  I proposed raising rents as one way of "taxing" 
off-world businesses.  I said nothing about the relative balance of rents
and taxes across the XT lne.  This will depend on decisions made by the 
Port Authority and the planetary government and will vary widely.

Reminds me of a pastime the locals of a nearby "town" have. They tell a
rumour at the bar in the morning and see how twisted the tale gets by
evening. Bob Smith\'s dead cow becomes a local cattle plague in hours.

Kuat Drive Yards Imperator-class ISD (Imperial Scout Destroyer) GTL 12

Because a truly bloated governmental entity like the Imperium generates
truly bloated budgets, Kuat Drive Yards (Capital/Core) introduces the
Imperator-class ISD in order to generate massive profi^h^h^h fufill the
ISS\'s need for a competitive long-term, deep-space survey vessel. Following
the classic wedge-shape of the ubiqutious Type-S scout, the Imperator is
truly huge, dwarfing even Navy capital ships like the Tigress BB. With this
vessel, the Scout Service can now say "Hey, we got big ships too!"

The Imperator is built with massive redundancy of systems. Over 100 sensor
systems coupled with 30 macroframe computers provide the ship with the
capacity to proccess huge amounts of survey information in a short period
of time.

If planetside research is required, the Imperator is equipped to carry a
300,000 dt pre-fab Scout base and dozens of subordinate craft, along with
the 9,700 Scout "troopers" to man them. Spaceside, the Imperator has
docking capacity for up to 8,000 dt of spacecraft (with a maximum size of
6,000 dt in the primary hanger bay).

While not a warship, the Imperator does have an armor belt of 60 inches
bonded superdense and a point defense grid of 50 quad-turret, 405 Mj Xaser
batteries to provide resistance to penetration from asteroids, hostile
natives with spaceflight capability, and all sorts of icky things you\'ll
find in deep space. If the passive resistance approach doesn\'t work, the
Imperator can always apply one or more of it\'s eight batteries of 74,000 Mj
N-PAWS or 60 batteries of 12,810 Mj N-PAWS to the situation.

Subassemblies and Body Features:
Superstructure (atop main body), 8 limited rotation turrets (4 each on

Nope, it\'s indigenous.  Most of the mesoamerican cultures were fond of
bloodletting as an aspect of religious practice, in a variety of ingenious
and often terrifying forms.  The early Spanish friars made use of the
image of Xipe Totec -- "Our Flayed Lord" -- as an analogy for the passion
of Christ, and of the common practice of eating the flesh of humans
identified with gods and then sacrificed in explaining the Eucharist. 

This taste for what we would consider bloody excess in religion has come
down in Mexican and other similar societies into the modern day; just
check out a crucifix in a rural Mexican church to see a Christ who is
actually *suffering* rather than hanging there daydreaming as in most
north-of-the-border versions.  (By the way, the other obvious religious

Interesting the twists this thread has taken since I started it. I just
thought Jagganath was a cool ship name. Anyway...

Just finished uploading some files in Delta Depot, take a look at:

http://www.sierratel.com/aum/BZAT/index.html

I\'ve got Hex sheets, bullets, world map templates, etc.  Only minor editing
done in the Farcast area, I\'ll be putting up maps there
soon though, and I\'ll tidy it up a bit more.

I only just noticed that I never forwarded my draft reply to the TML! Here
ya go:

A while ago, Erwin Fritz asked:
>My PCs are currently on Dinom/Lanth, at the beginning of the Fifth
Frontier War.
>I was looking at the game 5FW, and noticed that the fleet disposition maps
have
>the Dinom region covered by a fleet numbered simply "1".

I think you mean you compared the _Spinward Marches Campaign_ book to the
counters in the 5FW boxed game?

I did the same, and the only Imperial "1st" counter is for the Regina-based
First Provincial Fleet. At least this is in the same region of space (ie
near Dinom).

Anyway, I just saw this while looking up something else (weird, huh?!):

"The Lamas subsector [subsector B of Deneb] is defended by the 315th Fleet,
headquartered at Lamas (1309). The 315th fought in the Fifth Frontier War
as the 1st Fleet, defending the intersection of the Jewell (B), Regina (C),
Vilis (F), and Lanth (G) subsectors. With the realignment of the Imperial
fleets in the early 1110s, the 1st Fleet\'s designation was reassigned to
the fleet assigned to the Core subsector (Core/G), and the former 1st Fleet
became the 315th. Since the end of the Fifth Frontier War, the 1st/315th
was rotated into Deneb in order to allow pride of place to go to those
fleets that retained their historic wartime designations."
_The Regency Sourcebook_, pp52-53.

I dunno, maybe Dave Nilsen misread things, and instead of "1st Provincial"
read "1st Fleet", and decided this was silly - the 1st Fleet should be
based at Capital?? It\'s up to you, IYTU.

And the something else? Well, someone out there may be able to help with
that - where is the "famed Yard 17" located (builder of the best Kinunir\'s)

        Hello!
        I don\'t want to start any OS wars here, but it seems to me that a
concept put forward to me by Paul Schrif for another project makes more
sense.  The Win 9x INI file format has an API built into the OS for parsing,
and is reasonably machine readable.  It also is *very* extensible, since
information categories are read by section header...  so, for example, if
someone creates a character using my CT-TravGen program and then modifies it
with a program that adds information that TravGen does not use, the datafile
isn\'t broken.  Since TravGen never asks about that section of the file,
wether it is there or not does not affect anything.
        The problem with any other format that I can come up with is that
they aren\'t easily extensible.  We ultimatley are aiming for a standard that
any program can read, modify and write out with out screwing up.  So long as
we all agree on what the INI headers are and what the data objects
underneath are, then what I do with the file shouldn\'t annoy anyone else.

eg:
        O/_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
        O\\

[FormatHeader]
Purpose=CharacterSheet
GameRev=ClassicTraveller
FirstCreated=19990922
FirstCreatedBy=NCS-CT-TravGen
LastModified=19990923
LastModifiedBy=SomeOtherProgram

[TombStone]
Name=Alexander Jamison
Gender=Male
Race=Villani
Age=38
Service=Merchant
Terms=5

[Stats]
STR=7
DEX=7
END=9
INT=C
EDU=9
SOC=9

....etc, etc

        O/_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
        O\\

        The only thing I am uncertain about is wether we should be storing
the "results" or the infomation required to recreate the results.  So, it
the good Captain\'s STR roll was originally 8, but lost 1 pt due to aging,
for example, should we store the 8 and somehow the -1 STR and calculate the
resulting STR 7 everytime the character is loaded?  This would allow for
change histories to be built up.  On the other flipper, it will make for
larger character files.

        This becomes a *bigger* issue when we look at planetary UWP\'s....
particularly since I am working up a way to "age" planets from POP 1
colonies at TL10 using a development point system to POP A TL 15 super
powers.  It\'d be nice if someone could figure out/ reconstruct why my
version of a starmap is different in some respects (atmospherics, pop, TL)
than thiers...

        Its currently encapsultated in a spreadsheet, but I know what rules
I used to build the spreadsheet.  Tomorrow while I am watching my wife

        They are based entirely on the original CT rules.  I never really
got into the Merchant Prince rules much;  my players were never that
concerned about that level of detail.

        24 jumps per year;  ie: classic one week in jump, one week in system
model.  Starport premise is that whereever you are coming from will furnish
you with a full hold of containers.  IE:  This is the ROI for ideal
circumstances.  Which means that a calculated ROI of 0%, in reality, will
loose money since 24 full holds a year is pretty near to nil odds.  However,
if the ROI is *negative*, then *nothing* you do legally will make money with
the design, a good break on speculative trade not withstanding.  I try and
gun for an ROI of 3% - 5% on any design, since that allows for bad breaks of
MCr1.1 to MCr1.85 on a Type A hull.

        Again, the way I address these issues in my designs is to gun for
fudge-factor of 3 to 5 percent.  Also, as has been pointed out in other
discussions about the Type-A in particular, the independants are not meant
to make money hauling boxes.  Thier niche is in speculative trade.  So, if
your "Little Guy" design makes the target of 3 to 5 percent on boxes alone,
then with any talent at all it\'ll make good coin on speculative and small
package trade.

Please, suggest away! I agree on the red on black being hard to read, but do
you really prefer black on white? I find this stark, perhaps black on beige?
With the parchment background? Perhaps with the headers red on black?

On a side note, how about the templates? Any ideas for other types? I
figured everyone has chr gen sheets and ship design sheets, but I am working
on a zoom hex for mapping.

I figure a J-4, 1-g bulk transport has about 40% of its displacement
available for cargo (45% is J-4 and drive, 10% maneuver drive, and 5% crew
spaces and miscellaneous).  A trooper needs 1dt for his share of a four-man
bunkroom (assuming you don\'t overload them at 16 per 4dt module) plus your
posited 2 dt of cargo/vehicle slice. Thus you need about 7.5 or 8 dt of
ship to carry each trooper.  

Realistically, I would expect J-4 assault transports to be used only for
Marine forces that accompany the battle force.  Army forces would generally
travel in J-2 or J-3 merchant-type ships, which will have larger payload
fractions.  The 20,000 dton J-2 bulk freighter in Far trader has a payload
fraction of about 65% (13,000 tons).  The J-3 LASH carrier is down around
35% (8250) but has the advantage of putting that payload in streamlined
craft instead of an unstreamlined bulk ship.  

My expectation would be that LASH freighters would be taken up from trade
in huge numbers in a major war. They can carry troops ready for deployment
much more effectively than bulk freighters can.  Although lighters are not
suitable for assault waves, they make great follow-on echelon transports. 
Armies will presumably keep lots of modular habitation modules that can be
set up in cargo bays (and also on planetary surfaces to serve as barracks
in hostile environments.)

As noted in FT, LASH ships can also serve as auxiliary tenders with 400 to
500-ton SDBs. If the J-drive is designed at GTL 11, this ship can even make
J-4 with 15 SDBs, allowing it to accompany the battle force.  If not,
J-3/J1 sequential jumps are possible, which may be compatible with some
battle force operations where a jump reserve is kept.  


Sorry for rambling, hope some of this was helpful.

Campaign Notes  :  A throwback into the history of my own campaign ( of the
        last 13 years ) which closely ( but not too closely ) follows the "
canon history ".  The present PC\'s are heroes of the FFW ( which we just
finished ), who have been armed with the knowledge of the coming Rebellion
by travellers ( PC\'s from an earlier campaign, set in the future ) from the
future.

            The big question:  What will they do with this information?

So far its been going quite well, with lots of nice little twists and turns.
When we start up in a few weeks, the PC\'s will have been dealing with their
lives post FFW ( we will start the game three years after the last one
ended ).  Now...what will they do?  So far, it seems a trip to Capital is
being planned......

We\'ll see.

First off, thanks for replying, especially about non-Imperial visitors. I
also didn\'t realise that the economics equations allow worlds to raise
tariffs - I thought the Imperium would be against that (stifling free
trade).

Given that the Imperium encourages free trade, one question would be: how
high can tariffs be before they cause Imperial intervention (vis-a-vis the
"long-term disruption of trade" provisions of the Imp Rules of War)? Is
this scenario even possible, or would merchants simply route around such an
intransigent world??

Second, my apologies re \'port rents. I read too much into your original
reply:
>There are lots of ways to collect taxes from transients if you really want
to.
>Local authorities can tax hotels and restaurants in the "Startown" outside

Doh! You were talking about _transients_, that is, off-world visitors, not
local businesses. However, I appreciate the guideline that rents and taxes
are negotiated between the local authorities and the Port Director. This
allows me to raise rents so that local businesses (ie the PCs) find it more
economical to stay on the "local" side of the line, whilst creating
"freeports" and have ships running under flags-of-convenience. This gives a
good reason for Al Morai to own Shirene (or whatever that Lunion world is,
my Supp-3 is at home).

I can even envisage a tariff negotiation scenario coming up, for really
keen PC\'s with Liaison skill. ;-)

	Depends on your view, I guess. I\'m planning on using style sheets to
tweak fonts slightly (for those who want it); that should help break
up the starkness. Light-colored backgrounds aren\'t bad. And as my
website shows, I have no problem with red on black for the

re-uploaded (f%&()#W$& Microsoft FrontPage!). Although I\'m still not
at all satisfied with the way my site looks.

	Mapping is where I lack things; what I\'d really like to see, though,
is something vector-oriented rather than (or in addition to)
bitmapped. What\'s sized decently for display is way to coarse for
printout, and what\'s sized for good results printing on one printer
doesn\'t always come out well on another. But what a good file format
is a can of worms I\'d rather sidestep in favor of a brief discussion

Actually, for the above reason, I prefer number 2.

Isn\'t there a piece in SOM about a misjump, and how people really started to
worry after the eighth day that something was wrong?  Also, IIRC, there are
references to the first indication of a misjump is when the crew starts
spending time in the fresher \'worshiping the porcelain god\'.

No. I misspoke. I meant I was looking at the Spinward Marches Campaign.
I don\'t own 5FW. Sorry about that.

Anyway, the fleet location maps in the Campaign show a fleet number "1"
in the upper half of the Lanth subsector, but there is no mention of
this fleet in the text descriptions of the various campaigns described
elsewhere in the Campaign.

That makes sense, although I\'ve never heard of a "Provincial" fleet of

Nah. I\'ll call it the First Fleet. I figure that the Imperium is large
enough that it could have two First Fleets for a short time because of a
clerical error, or a grudge between sector Dukes.

Well, let\'s see. What do we know about Yard 17? In no particular order:

1. It\'s responsible for building the following Azhanti High Lightning
cruisers:
   Bard Endeavor, laid down 132-991, first flight 041-994, lost in
Solomani Rim War
   Refulgent Triumph (weird name), laid down 061-994, first flight
060-997, scrapped 1048
   Threatening Vengeance, laid down 076-997, first flight 327-999
   Valiant Senior, laid down 328-999, first flight 281-1001
   Bard Refuge (must be a noisy ship!), laid down 295-1001, first flight
112-1004
2. A competing firm, Yard 16, is responsible for several other AZH
ships.
3. It\'s responsible for building six Kinunir battle cruisers, the names
of which I won\'t mention here.

That doesn\'t help you, but it\'s all I could find on the company. I
wonder what the relationship is between Yard 17 and Yard 16?

I would find a discussion of Vilani and Sylean religion interesting.  To
what extent did Terran Confederation/2I officials conduct missionary
work (probably mostly Christian and Islamic) within the conquered
territories, and how well did it "stick"?  OTOH, are Vilani, Sylean, and
other indigenous religions evangelistic?  Do they try to win converts?

ISTR that Yard 17 (and presumably the other numbered Yards; Supp 5 lists 
ships from 11, 16, 17 and 22) are Navy-owned and operated yards.  I assume
they stay in the shipbuilding business to provide surge capacity for
wartime repair work.

	My general rule of thumb is to multiply by 10, about 40 dtons per man.
Applied this gives 11,320 dtons for a 283 man company and 38,920 dtons
for a 973 man company. Your company and regiment sizes may be a little
different, and depending upon the exact options you can get slightly
different sizes, but it should give an order of magnitude ship size. 

	I built a reasonable company transport vehicle (283 men, 17 vehicles)
at 10,000 dTons, including the Jump-4, and a regiment transport (973
men, 73 vehicles) at 45,000 dTons.

There are *lots* of other possibilities even from just the *Christian*
view. Some examples:

First question for most Christian sects would be "Do they have souls?".
If they don\'t, there\'s no point trying to "save" them. And they should
perobably not be allowed to participate in various rites.

If they do have souls, the next question is "Do they have original
sin?" or to put it another way, "Have they fallen from grace the way
Adam & Eve did?". If no, then they have no need to be saved. End of
"problem". 

If yes, then you need to determine if Christ came to save them
(unlikely), or if God sent then a different Saviour (or will be sending
them a different Saviour). After all, Christ came to save *humanity*. 

This is where a lot of faiths will start to differ though. I expect
some to be willing to try "saving" the aliens anyway.

An interesting thought is: what if they have scriptures that (allowing
for species differences) *match* those of an earthly religion? This
could lead to:

1. groups from both species proclaiming that it *proves* their faith is
   correct, and joining together to form a merged religion. 

2. Groups claiming that the other species\' faith is a plot of <evil one>
   to trick them. This will result in such groups in *both* species.

3. Groups trying to achieve #1.

4. Groups (in both species) of other faiths claiming it\'s all a plot to
   discredit *their* religion.

So. Just look at the mess I\'ve created just by going thru the first
couple of items in the "creed" that all "Christians" are supposed to
believe.

A good part of an elite unit\'s "eliteness" is attitude. As well as a
certain resourcefulness. This will *always* be an advantage.

I rather expect that "elite" units with battledress may keep up certain
old traditional weapons as well. So you may have tropps who, if their
battledress is inoperable turn out to be able to fight rather nastily
with knifes, swords, or something else simply because that\'s their
unit\'s "traditional" weapon and everyone is expected to be expert with
it, even if it *is* "obsolete" and "useless".

In Challenge #25 there is an article on planetery invasions. 10 tons
was given as an "optimistic estimate" per trooper. 5 tons for troop
stuff and 5 tons for ship stuff. "...four 25,000 man divisions would
require one million tons of capacity!"

The Imperium is against it and does what it can to discourage the practice.
However, sometimes protective tariffs may make sense.  The Scouts even 
block trade with worlds at times when they believe it is in the locals
best interest.  In the Real World, protective tariffs played an important
part in the industrialization of the US, Germany, Japan, and Korea, to name
a few.  The original justification for them was put forward by none other than
Alexander Hamilton in his report to congress "On Manufactures."  Well-run 
industrialization or TL advancement programs carried on behind temporary 
protective tariffs may even gain the support of the subsector duke.

>Given that the Imperium encourages free trade, one question would be: how

This is a good question.  Worlds that have what the local Imperial dukes 
consider to be unreasonably high tariffs might be confronted with an Imperial
delegation to "negotiate" their lowering.  How high is too high will depend
on the justification used by the local government and how much money well-
connected Imperials stand to make if the tariffs are lowered.

Note that for the most part, worlds will not want to have high tariffs because
most worlds depend on interstellar trade for critical parts of their economy.
The economic collapse of the Long Night and Hard Times shows just how much
the economies of the Imperium\'s member worlds are interlinked.

Again, high tariffs are allowed mainly because we didn\'t want to unnecessarily
constrain GMs, though there are reasonable economic and political justifications
for their judicious use.

The kernal of your idea is very usefull. To say it another way, if you don\'t
need it then ignore it. Please note message from Robert Eaglestone that also
points out something similar. When it comes to choosing an extensable language
to base it on I would think that it might be easier to use XML on a microsoft
operating system than for other operating systems to find a way to access the
proprietary microsoft INI format. Looking into the pros and cons may be
interesting.

I had imagined that the original base roll and the resulting modified value would
be of most use. The calculations would remain in the relm of thecharacter generator
program. Please see sample files for examples.  A trickier point is what to include
to handle benefits information. I had thought that by indicating the period of time
between receipt of the benefit and an indicator of the last time the benefit was
collected based on the chronological age of the character.

Maybe there should be a distinction between your programs database that describes the
total information about the sector and a "snapshot" that players would access as the
current situation.  As an example I see DXF files that represent the information used
to describe a piece of machinery however a postscript or hpgl file that is sent out
to a printer or plotter has much less information in it.

The father of one of my high school friends had been a lifer in the
Army, then in the Air Force after it was created.  He once remarked that
bayonets at throat level will break any line.  Considering his infantry
experience -- from Depression-era crowd control to retaking the
Philippines from Japan -- I think he spoke from personal knowledge, not
hearsay.

Actually, it might be argued that things could go the other way.
Ecumenical movements might gather some strength and momentum from the
discovery of \'life out there\' making denominations realize that they don\'t
have that much between them after all.  (Indeed, locally a couple of very
similar churches *are* merging but I can\'t recall if this is just in our
town or nationwide.)

Perhaps in the face of a whole galaxy to \'convert\'  (though I found
Leonard\'s remarks about the possibilities fascinating), various branches
would actually come together.

I don\'t enough about Islam etc. to comment on them much.


I realize that this hasn\'t *tended* to be the way things have worked in the
past, but I wonder if the discovery of alien life would radically change
our ways of thinking.

I thought there were Messianic Jews now who have \'found\' Christ?

I\'m a bit confused by this as I thought Christians do recognize the second
coming of Christ?  (Or do you mean recognize an event that\'s past as the
second coming - say the accession of Cleon I to the throne or something?)


>The possibilities are endless, has anyone worked some of them out?

I would guess that this could go in one of two ways.  Either you read the
lack of mention of religion in the Traveller corpus as a sign that the
missionary work never happened or failed miserably.  This gives the
possibility of PCs finding a \'lost text\' which either they are (or whoever
gets hold of it subsequently is) \'convinced\' by.  There would then be the
opportunities for it being taken on a \'crusade\' to evangelize worlds with
this lost religion.


Alternatively you read the lack of mention of religion in the Traveller
corpus as just something that hasn\'t been described so that the referee can
do what s/he wants.  Then you have the option of ignoring it altogether;
still doing something such as the above; suggesting that some form of
monolithic religion is prevelant; or following Leonard\'s idea of even
further fragmentation as different religions attempt to integrate aliens in
a variety of different ways.  As usual the possibilities are endless.

In _101 Religions_ there are religions that try to win converts.  The
religions have the old DGP URP implicitly built in but for copyright
reasons they weren\'t actually used.  Would there be any interest in a list
of religion and URP being put up somewhere on the web for those who have
the book?  Would there be any copyright problems with that?

Put it this way:  If one assumes that battledress is the norm on TL15
battlefields, which group of infantry will be more effective; regular
infantry, who train in their battledress; or jump troops/marines, who
not only train in battledress (as do the regular infantry), but also
routinely experience in training the stress of meteoric assault, with
its risk (even in training) of death or maiming?

One reason that paratroop units are generally considered "elite" is
that, during their practice jumps, they become accustomed to the
adrenaline rush that accompanies both parachute jumps and combat.  As a
result, they tend to be more able to deal with the shock of combat than
unblooded troops who are <holding back pejorative comments> non-airborne
personnel.  This ties in with your first comment (attitude as an aspect
of "elite" status).  Modern paratroops and marines also tend to have
high levels of resourcefulness, since they both have to deal with
assaulting enemy positions without secure land-based lines of
communications.

In Traveller terms, jump troops and marines will tend to be elite, for
three reasons:

1.  Training to enter the battlefield by meteoric assault will tend to
accustom the troops to the adrenaline rush associated with combat.

2.  Both types of troops will be trained to fight while surrounded (most
soldiers _hate_ to be cut off from direct lines of
communication/supply).

3.  Since marines and jump troops often have to improvise logistically
(and thus tactically) prior to link-up with or reinforcement by
conventional troops, they both will tend to be unusually resourceful.

Hey, there\'s elite, then there\'s elite....

There are certainly enough "Elite" units hanging around in the Imperium to
cross the full spectrum of training and preparedness.

Some possibilities;

Marchant\'s Marauders : An Elite, well trained mercenary unit equipped with
Battle Dress.  They are weaponed primarily with lasers, with a scattering
of heavy slugthrowers and a few FGMPs or PGMPs.  Take away their toys and
they are merely fair brawlers (albiet ones in excellent physical shape -
but without extensive training).

The First Glisten Highlander Regiment : An Elite unit of Glisten\'s own
military,  They are very well trained in zero-G-combat, and confined space
hostage rescue.  Generally they are employed in situations where a
terrorist or criminal group is holding hostages on a space platform.  They
go into combat with accellerator rifles, snub pistols, and a variety of
other low-recoil specialty weapons.  They tend to wear either tough-skinned
but snug fitting vacc suits or hardsuits for situations where vacuum combat
can be expected.  When unarmored, they are experts with knives and small
blades.  They also have a tradition involving (shudder) bagpipes.  Put
these guys in Battle Dress and they\'ll do ok, but don\'t expect the
performance of an Imperial Marine.

115th Imperial Marine Special Forces Regiment : This particular unit is
trained in use of Battle Dress and FGMPs.  Their primary mission, however,
is infiltration and sabotage of enemy ground targets in enemy territory.
They are skilled in quiet killing, demolitions, escape and avoidance, and
stealth.  Put them in BD and hand them FGMPs and they are merely as good as
all the other Imperial Marines.

The point of an "elite" unit is usually to become specialists at a
particular type of combat or activity.  Engineers are just as "elite" as
Rangers, just in a different way.  There will be plenty of Elite units
which have few applicable skills in some situations.

would that be *Star* destroyer grey ?

I\'d think Vilani religions may be very Vilani-centric, commanding some
austere rituals to those who are under Vilani rule, but not being so enthusiastic
about spreading like a virus to all cultures.  A political, cold religion is what
I think of when I think of Vilani... but I expect that their shugilii witchdoctors

That\'s a rather large chunk of the planetary production (13% if average
GWP is assumed to be Cr10,000/citizen) sliced off for the Imperium before
the planet\'s own needs are addressed. A heavy burden. It also makes for a
humongous Imperial army and navy (and the scouts and marines won\'t be so
very small either). The Imperium IYTU appears to be a much larger factor
in everyday life than that of the OTU.

I must confess that the one thing the book is lacking is an index of
religions by culture.  Is there enough interest out there for me to compile
such an index?  I could try and get it done this weekend.  (Dom you haven\'t
already done this have you?)

I was very unconvinced but have found it extremely useful.  I\'ve even now
read and reviewed an e-book on my Palm IIIx.  Given how much I dislike
reading \'on screen\' this was a breakthrough for me.

I can now much more usefully utilize commuting time - particularly with the

Actually the IIIx comes with 4meg on board (useful if you store lots of
text like me - an entire Bible takes about half that).  I\'ve just seen on
www.ugeek.com an 8meg expansion for $100.

The INI format is a simple ASCII text file, and is
not going to be a problem for non-MS operating
systems.  There are a small set of "format" rules,
which could be described in a few paragraphs.

Yes, Jews for Jesus is one group. As far as Islam,  you said you knew too
little to comment. I know only a bit, but from what I have read (theology is
a "hobby" of mine) I doubt you would see much of a change in their belief
system, except perhaps with the less traditional factions. The continuity of
Moslem culture is rivaled only by the Hebrews.

As far as I am aware, sub orbital on a vacuum world is when the orbit is so low

I\'m in agreement.  I\'ve got a 500000-ton High Guard design for a fleet
tanker based on the TF-15 from MegaTraveller (J3/1G).  If excess fuel
(for distribution, not the ship and one jump-3) is converted to cargo
space, it has a payload fraction of 52.3% plus five 100-ton shuttles
and five 1000-ton lighters.  Increasing the ship to jump-4 (10% more 
ship fuel, 1% more jump drive, 1% more power plant, plus support) brings 
us down near 40% cargo payload.  Cost of the jump-3 version is around
GCr 140 in bulk; I\'d expect a jump-4 version to cost more like GCr 170
after the discount, under High Guard.  Don\'t know what the GURPS version
would look like.

All the regular Imperial AssaultRons in the 5FW board game were jump-4.
This was nice because they could keep up with the majority of Imperial
regular fleets, which were also jump-4.  Jump-3 could also be reasonable,
but I\'d think that jump-2 would be much too slow.

The original INI format is ASCII and would be familiar to users of and
parseable by Linux, OS/2, Mac, DOS or virtually any other OS. IIRC, Jo
Grant used the ini format for config files for the old Dulinor
project...I could be wrong, but I seem to recall that was true. Heck,
even I have used ini\'s to hold data in configuration files for DOS and
OS/2 programs..and I\'m certainly not a professional programmer. (I\'m
too darn busy teaching programming to actually *do* much of it <big
sigh>.)  However, you *don\'t* want to compile it into a binary format
as that would quickly make it non-crossplatform.

OTOH, XML *is* a standard format that everyone from MS to the OSF is
supporting for describing data. People familiar with HTML will find it
pretty easy to pick up.  I believe there are free XML parsers for most
systems floating around.  XML, I think, is the future and probably the
way to go.

IAC, there have been similar discussions among GURPS software writers.
It would make sense for whatever we decide to coincide to whatever
they decide wouldn\'t it?

	That is certainly a possibility, but religious institutions

	positions, which they are unlikely to give up in the name
	of unity.  I could see some amalgamation, but IMHO the
	general trend would continue to be branching and

	Christians was in fact the messiah.  I was rather thinking 
	of Jews who still think that Jesus was a prophet, but that
	Jo Shmo (born in 2000 AD) is actually the messiah.

Try the early TNS entries about the insurgency on Efate (c. 1105-1106).
There were several Imperial Army units mentioned by name, including a Lift
Infantry regiment (IIRC -- I\'m away from my library right now). The
releases were quoted in the 5FW rulebook, and possibly in The Spinward
Marches Campaign, in addition to the original JTAS features.

What about the Phillipines? No Mesoamericans there, and I\'m not aware of

**  Note:  I just realized this algorithim is slightly broken, now that I am
recreating it from a spreadsheet out into an accounting-style form.
Specifically, it erroneously handles both revenue and expenses on a 24 jumps
per year basis.  This is incorrect;  a starship spends 2 weeks - the
equivalent of one revenue period - in refit.  Thus, while expenses are on 24
periods per year, revenues are only on 23 periods per year.  This totals an
error of 4.2% on the PPdT (actual) value for item 10.  Ignore if you like,
or simply multiply item 10 by 0.958 to correct.  On one design I have, which
makes Cr4,493,907.23/ year for an ROI of 1%, applying this correction
results in changes Cr4,241,907.23 and an ROI of 1%. 
    Liners produce a funny result;  the value of item 7 is negative.  Which
means that you don\'t need to carry cargo to break even.  Any cargo carried
simply improves your ROI.  Which makes sense.  
    A vessel design should aim for an ROI of 3% - 5%.  As commented
elsewhere, these calculations are based on ideal conditions.  An ROI
expectation of less than 3% will eventually loose money as a result of light
loads, labour difficulties, battle damage, etc.  Allowing for an ROI of 3% -
5% essentially allows the ship to absorb the equivalent of a second annual
maintanence every year and still break even.
    Of last consideration is that, again commented elsewhere, small
independant ships are intended to make thier money on speculative trade, not
hauling boxes.  So, for a speculative trade design, a thinner ROI may be
permissible with the knowledge that the bulk of real revenues will not come
from "hauling boxes".  
    Please note that I am not an economist, nor do I play one on TV.  So if
I have twirped something, please let me know.  **

        I did up an HG design for the _Andrew Young_ that folks were using
as a discussion ship some time ago.

        Diplomat-Class Battlion Transport and Support Ship
        Q73310F4-009909-50099           MCr45077.01             91 ktons
TL F          Crew 639
        Passengers=0. Cargo=3000. Fuel=36400. EP=9100. Agility=2. Troops=4551
        Batteries are 1 CPAWs, 12 Repulsor Bays, 12 Meson Bays, 12 Missile
Bays and 162 pulse laser groups

        3 full MiB brigades.  1 deployed by drop capsule, other two land
using 20 Bulldog class LC\'s in two waves//  5 scoop ships carried for
frontier refueling;  can supply vessel with power-plant requirements in two
round-trips of group.  Full tankage is 40 round-trips of entire group.  LC\'s
and Scoop-ships are 250dton each.  Cargo capacity is for troop equipment
loads as guesstimated by myself in an earlier post.

        This works out, for a self-contained invasion ship, to be ~20dtons
per man carried.  The design is quite capable of kicking the snot out of an
SDB squadron by itself. However, for any serious invasion, she\'d need full
Naval support getting to orbit.  I\'d say three times her tonnage in
optimized combat ships, which effectively means ~60dtons per carried man.

There is no way to "compile" an INI file into a binary
format; They are ASCII text - period.  You may be
confusing them with the migration from INI files to
the Windows Registry, which can hold non-textual data
elements.

I was working with Michel Vaillancourt on creating
an new format for the data used by his Window programs.
After some consideration and review of the Microsoft 
XML 1.0 library (msxml.dll), I believe that I may be 
able to make his program\'s file I/O object support
XML at some point very soon.

It occurs to me that it would also be a good thing to compile a

it off...

Not a confusion Paul.  I\'ve seen a compiler that converts INI format
files to something resembling the Registry, and hence only readable
with a specialized viewer program.  I just wanted to point out that
that\'s a direction I wouldn\'t want a *commom* format to go.  There
are still many of us that either don\'t use, or at least limit our
use of, Win32.

Actually, I assumed something more akin to KCr20-26 per annum, but yes, a
heavy burden... most worlds will draw it, however, from combined corporate
and other sources. Also, Imperial Army units have a major advantage
economically - they generally trickle right back to the planetary
economy... Since, IMTU, the "Imperial Army" is the MT/COACC style
"Headquarters" units, with no actual imperial troops, but simply combined
staffs for the local worlds armies. Also, the GWP I suspect will average
out to some KCr30-50 on most worlds... forget how I originally figured
that, but I based it upon skilled labor making Cr1200 to Cr2000 per month.
Figure unskilled labor to be some Cr500-700 per month (support SS 2 or 3).
Basically, at Cr250*Soc, soc 7 being average, upkeep of soc means the
average is Cr1750 per month... (See MT Players Manual, p30) SO average
income of skilled labor (Typical for soc 7 is, IMTU, experienced skilled
labor or inexperienced academic/education derived fields). And since take
home pay is usually around 1/3 to one half GDP per capita (IIRC), the tax
burden as a share of GPP is not too bad... about 4-5% of the GDP for
non-rich non-poor worlds. and most of that (3% GPP) is being spent on local
forces!

Lessee here... KCr40 per annum GPP Army: KCr1.2, Imperial Forces: KCr0.5
So, KCr1.7 per annum per person on expenses of KCr40 GPP... about 5%...

Economics are one of the areas most affected by the different versions base
assumptions... MT with it\'s soc costs is VERY different from all other
editions in that respect... Average incomes MUST be higher than the CT
KCr10 per year... besides it should be KCr13 per year for skilled laborers
based upon ship pay... and retirement pay is often going to be much less
than annual pay...

Also, IMTU, the important part of a Noble\'s Fief is the stock holdings...a
sector duke needs draw very little from his subjects to fund a lavish
lifestyle... he gets trickle-up from almost every interplanetary endeavor,
and sector wide lines he gets 4% of the profits... And typically, most
nobles will answer directly to the subsecotr duke, so, they get 0.1-0.4% of
the subsector\'s profits. THen again (as Hans probably remembers) IMTU,
nobles have significant duties and priveledges... like imperial guarantees
of Trial by Jury, and at least 1/2 that jury being nobility (often locals,
tho)..

This is also in this weeks New Scientist. In fact there is quite a bit of space
science in it this week (detecting earth sized planets, space healing,
spacecraft repair droids, formation flying spacecraft for cheap long baseline
observatories[article], GRBs[article], solar sail observatory). Most are only
snippets, but an interesting read.

Nope. The chapters broadly correspond to the URP types, but there is no
list by race or by culture that I am aware of. If you produce such a list I
will happily put it up at BITS.

Note: we cannot use the URP for the usual DGP copyright issues...

One question - is anyone aware of a text editor/memo pad on the palm which
has a larger limit than the unit which ships with it? I find the current
limit hard to use for scenario writing. "Delta 3 is Down", one of the BITS
tournaments for GenCon UK 99 was drafted on my Palm.

There is a IIIe at 2Mb IIRC?

Fortunately, my wife uses a Psion 3a so appreciates the PalmPilot.

Well... *I* haven\'t seen them because buying IGs versions of LWH and
Gateway was low priority as I owned the BITS version. The above was Andy\'s

Anyway, if all goes well you\'ll see them by Christmas.

I don\'t think it would be far from the realm of possibility. Your view is
somewhat cynical, but it would be equally cynical to say that world
religions might band together not simply out of necessity, but out of
profit, influence, privilege or whatever other motive you\'d like to saddle
them with.

A Tartuffesque religious leader may enjoy the secular influence and power he
has as a result of his station on Earth. However, he may be tempted to weigh
being the king of the hill on Earth against being a partner among the stars.

Christianity, LIC.

Also, the trip to the stars could make fascinating changes in the existing
balance of power among religions here on Earth. As an example:

In real life, there is a sizable percentage of the African-American
population who practice an offshoot of Islam. This variant bears some
resemblance to Islam, but there is an intermingling of more modern "UFO
cult" style imagery and philosophy as well as strong influences from the
African-American slave tradition and Baptist Christianity.

Such a group may be quick to organize and receptive to the idea of
extraterrestrial colonization. The African-American slave tradition may have
some appeal to minor human races whose own cultural traditions were
marginalized, sidelined or destroyed by the Ziru Sirka. Such a religion
could feasibly spread like wildfire during the Second Imperium.

The American Baptist Church (not to be confused with the Southern Baptists)
has a tradition of missionary work as well as public service. Their
tolerance is nigh unto legendary, and their efforts are surprisingly
effective.

Ach! Don\'t forget the various religions and orders within religions who have
a tradition of education. The Jesuits are a perfect example, they frequently
go right to the "ruling class" with their fine tradition of excellent
schooling and win over their youth in this fashion. This, combined with
their interest in science as well as their sense of duty to the communities
in which they become involved make them an excellent choice for an order
that would be likely to spread to the stars. The same could also be said
concerning the Quakers.

Just some ideas.

There are a few variables to consider, including the size and composition
of the population of the generation ships. Take 1,000 people from the USA
as your population for the ship, and Christianity will be the dominant
religion of the group. You might have the occasional non-Christian in that
sample, but they\'ll be the exception. Let several generations go by, and
whatever other "minority" religions were present in that sample will 
probably have disappeared.

On the other hand, if you have a sample of 100,000 chosen from all over the
world, with several religions represented in large numbers, they\'ll all 
likely be present in some form.

Going slighly off the original intent of the post to a comment on religion
in the Imperium: the 3I is about 3,500 years in the future. Most contemporary
"great religions" are considerably younger than that: Christianity, Buddhism,
and Islam, for example, did not exist 3,000 years ago; Judaism existed, but
would any of us recognize it then? I\'m not sure.

That, and the contribution of Vilani and whatever other races one cares to
mention (major and minor), would mean that the religious map of the 3I may
well be unrecognizable to us 20th-century humans.

Except for the First Church of Elvis, of course.

Suggested reading:

Brin, David. The Transparent Society.

An interesting exploration of the whole privacy/accountability discussion,
emphasizing computers but covering other issues as well. Well worth reading
and pondering.

ObTrav: Not too much, as the Traveller background rather ignores the whole
issue. It would make a useful resource for a T2300 campaign, though.

Up here we\'ve got Jews who believe Jesus was a prophet (but not the
Messiah), Jews who believe that Jesus was the Messiah, and Jews who believe
that the Messiah is coming really soon. (Along with the usual
Reform/Conservative/Orthodox/Ultra-Orthodox/Hassidic/.... sects. Judaism
seems to have nearly as many sects as Christianity.)

There was a bit of a local scandal when a prominent doctor was refused
burial at Jewish cemetary because he was a member of Jews for Jesus. His
son is extremely bitter about it, claiming that his father was more of a
Jew than those who never entered a synagogue after bar mitvah, yet are
still buried there. This is understandable, given that the rabbis who
blocked the burial waited to do so until the funeral procession was at the
gates. (The doctor had owned his plot for 20 years, so there had been
plenty of time to settle things _before_ he died. The police weren\'t
terribly happy about being dragged into a religious squabble between the
rabbis and the mourners.)

ObTrav: I figure you can make _any_ variant of an existing religion
plausible for a Traveller universe. Just make certain that your players
aren\'t offended first!

(I like playing Credo, as do several ordained friends of mine, yet most
"ordinary" Anglicans I\'ve tried the game with think it is mocking
Christianity. The difference is that the clergy already know all the
scandalous stuff in early church history and have dealt with it, while
virtually all of the laity seem to have viewed the church\'s beliefs as an
unchanging constant, and are deeply bothered by realizing that they were
not always the same.)

(On that note, an interesting book is "The Unauthorized Version" by Robin
Lane Fox.)

With a population of about six billion, Earth today has a staggering
amount of religious diversity. Just in my own gaming group we have a 
Catholic, a Mormon, a Jew, a Presbyterian, an indifferent agnostic, 
and a devout athiest... 

The 3I has a population in the trillions (at least!), some of the not 
even human. It is reasonable to assume that there is a huge amount 
of diversity in the 3I as well. That being the case, it is reasonable 
to assume that the 3I is not a Christian empire. On the other hand, 
given that it is one of Earth\'s dominant religions today, it would 
also be reasonable to assume that Christianity, in some form (probably
several forms), still exists in the 3I (mostly in the rimward portion
of the Imperium -- Terra and its environs).

So you\'ve really thrown everything at the PC\'s and they still survive
that trade run/belt mining/merc ticket adventure. They did it and
managed to make alot of credits without being rules rapists.(wow!) I\'ve
gotta assume that the Imperuim is gonna want some taxes out of their
profits. After all, the money to finance those Trillion Credit Squadrons
and Imperial bureaucrats has to be coming from somewhere, right? The
Cr500 tax from TCS only pertains to Navy budgets; Striker theoretically
hinted at what I\'ll call a military tax with which you could calculate
spending for all military services. Pocket Empires had a govenment
budget and taxes which one could exptrapolate into a person owing so
many Credits per year, but that was only for small intersteller
governments which really can\'t compare to the 11,000 worlds in the
Imperuim.

Does anyone have any ideas on what a Imperial personal income tax would
look like? For the moment, IMTU I\'m borrowing from the US Tax Code, but
I gotta assume after several thousand years that the 3I would come up
with a better tax code than that. Also, was there any mention of taxes
in this "World Tamers Handbook"? I never had a chance to see the TNE
book on world building (World Tamers Handbook?) but I\'m guessing that
they may have made some mention of it. Finnally, if this topic has been
done to death, point me in the right direction to look at the messages.
Thanks.

And for those PC\'s who may be on the TML and reading this message, the
Imperuim thanks you for your self sacrifice. Emperor Strephon "feels
your pain."

Folks,

Just an FYI that the animated version of R.A. Heinlein\'s Starship Troopers 
is in release. the name of it is Roughneck Chronicles. In the Los Angeles, 
CA area it has been playing 0730 in the morning, so check your local 
listings. On the whole, is considerably closer to the spirt of the original 
than the live action movie a couple of years ago, IMHO of course. I mention 
this because the CGI animation is absolutely incredible. It is so smooth in 
fact that my wife thought it was live-action at first glance.

Sincerely,

Brian A. Howard

Beware the sound of a Babel fish,
For a Vogon constructor fleet cannot be far behind.

I was trying to work out how the alternate materials bit worked so I could
borrow it for a spreadsheet I\'ve been playing with for ages and I came
across a discrepancy in the prices per kg of the materials.

It would appear that the prices per cubic meter in FFS have been divided by
1000 in order to get the price per kg.
The spreadsheet shows Cr 1.6 per kg for Iron, but I get Cr 0.2 per kg.

What I have done is divide the price per cubic meter by the mass per cubic
meter (to get the price per tonne) and then divided again by 1000 to get the
price per kg.
ie.
Iron, mass 8, price 1600.
(1600 / 8) / 1000 = 0.2 per kg.

Does this look right ?

then they might get their ship upgraded to a working version. :-)

It wasn\'t the first one so that may have been part of the problem.
That was also when I started getting tired of David Drake\'s writing

A most excellent question and example, Mr. Eaglestone.  One would think that
you\'d spent at least a person-week on the concept.  :)  Although, if it
weren\'t for those darn standards, there\'d be a lot more work for
programmers...  ;p  This\'ll probably turn into discussion of the merits of
"the technology I know" v. "the technology you know" since too few of us
want to keep re-learning the same durn things over and over and over...

Someone mentioned that "those wacky GURPS guys" were having the same
discussion.  Can anyone tell me which list that\'s on?  I\'d at least like to
watch the bloodletting.  ;}

Maybe someone can do a "registry" type web site that sends out email
acknowledges every month or so to keep it current, or is there already
something like that for Traveller? I\'ve seen generic ones, and also for other
specific games.

Dear degenerate scum of Joyeuse:
  Have you considered exporting your mind-altering chemicals to the 3I -
they certainly need something to help them ignore what passes for their
civilization!

  To paraphrase one of the great tracts of Terran political philosophy,
"War is Peace", but only in a closed system where absolute military
efficiency is no longer relevant.

  That is, if you think that a star-kow with no armour can whack anything
(let alone an SDB built by true technocratic fasc^h^h real men) resembling
a warship then you\'re welcome to drop by for tea.

Taxes are interesting?  Are you some kind of CPA or economist?

The ribbing on this list is the most hilarious I\'ve ever encountered. I

Then why do all my guest from NYC identify themselves as being from a

Anyway, I imagine that the moniker isn\'t uncommon in areas dominated by a
large, prominent urban area.  Mention The City in this area, and everybody
assumes that you\'re discussing San Francisco.

    'body' => 'A long time ago, Rob Prior mentioned that he\'d like some software to
help him create flora and fauna for his games.
	Creating animals is relatively easy ; existing rules cover that
reasonably well. The following info may be of use in detailing animals
and plants.

Two comparatively recent articles are of interest :-
1. West G.B., Brown J.H. and Enquist B.J. A General Model for the Origin
of Allometric Scaling Laws in Biology. Science 276 (1997):122-126
2. West G.B., Brown J.H. and Enquist B.J. A General Model for the
Structure and Allometry of Plant Vascular Systems. Nature 400
(1999):664-667

Premises of the model in (1) :-
- - Essential materials (e.g. oxygen, glucose) are transported through
space-filling fractal networks of branching tubes.
- - Energy losses are minimised (hydrodynamic resistance) ; and
- - the terminal generations of tubes do not vary with body size e.g.
capillaries in the circulatory system.

Network types :-
- - branching tubes (animal respiratory and circulatory trees)
- - bundled parallel vascular elements (plants).
Other important network parameters :-
- - tube wall properties (rigid-> elastic),
- - fluid transported (liquids, gases),
- - nature of pump :-
pulsatile compression (heart)
pulsatile bellows (lungs+chest wall)
diffusion (insect tracheal network)
osmotic and vapour pressure gradients (plant vascular tree) 

(N.B. I\'m still trying to get my head around some of the math).

However, the following conclusions can be reached :-

variable = constant X (body mass)^(exponent)

The constants apply across a given family of animals e.g. mammals,
reptiles, birds, fish. There is considerable heterogeneity when one
considers invertebrates (but this variance disappears when insects,
arachnids, etc. are considered separately, as far as the patchy data
available suggests).

Variable	Exponent
- -metabolic rate	3/4
- -heartbeat	-1/4
- -max.
pop. growth	-1/4
- -life span	1/4
- -embryonic 	1/4
growth time

Points from the second article :-
* The parameters from the first article were used to model fluid
transport through the xylem vessels from trunk to petioles, and results
can be applied to all vascular plants.
* Tube taper makes flow resistance a constant independent of path
length, ensuring that all leaves are equally supplied with nutrients.
* Gas flow rate is independent of size, relying only on the
atmosphere-soil pressure gradient and the flow resistance of the
distributive network. Photosynthesis is limited by the uptake of carbon
dioxide and the excretion of oxygen, so metabolic rate varies with gas
flow rate.

* Scaling exponents
Metabolic rate scales with mass^(3/4), as does reproductive biomass 
leaf and branch number ~ mass^(3/4)
number of generations of branches ~ ln M
branch length ~ plant mass^(1/4)
branch length ~ branch radius^(2/3)
trunk length ~ mass^(1/4)
trunk radius ~ mass^(3/8)
xylem tube radius ~ mass^(1/16)
pressure gradient across a given branch ~ mass^(-1/4)
branch resistance ~ mass^(-3/4)

* Maximum [tree] height with surface gravity of 1G and atmospheric
pressure of 1 atm is approximately 100m.

>From the article :-
Rmax = Rn[Rn^2/((An^2) * n)]^(a/2)(1 + a1 - a)
Hmax = [In/(1-n^(-1/3))]*[(Rn^2)/((An^2) * n)]^1/3(1 + a1 - a),

where :-
- - Rmax is maximum trunk radius,
- - Hmax is maximum plant height,
- - In is the length of the nth generation of branch,
- - n the number of xylem tubes,
- - Rn the radius of the nth generation of branch,
- - An the radius of the nth generation of xylem tube,
- - a1 a scaling exponent related to the degree of taper of tube radius.
The optimal value for this is 1/6. In a non-optimised flow network, a1
could be as high as 1/3. A value of zero implies no taper (so the
branches of the plant are entirely conducting \'pipes\'), and
- - a a scaling exponent related to the degree of scaling of branch
radius.
This is usually 1, assuming that area preserving branching and optimal
structural strength in the branches are present.

e.g. if a=1 and a1=1/6 :-
if Rn = 0.5mm, An = 10 micrometres, n = 200, Rmax ~1m, Hmax ~40m ;
if An = 8 micrometres (and other parameters unchanged), Rmax ~4m, Hmax
~100m.

Problems with the model :-
- - vessel size may vary within and among plants in different environments
- - horizontal flow may take place between parallel tubes
- - variations in tube length and branching symmetry within a plant
- - variation in biomechanical constraints (a value) within a plant
- - some plants have few branches e.g. palms, grasses, ferns - the a
value  tends towards zero.

However, the values predicted by the model agree well with the
observational data collected thus far.

As we\'re talking about campaigns, taking a roster etc at the moment, I
thought that I\'d mention the following:

My local gaming club has recently had a number of people leave (job
changes, moving to university). As a result, numbers have thinned down
somewhat. We\'ve got a big venue with cheap drinks/snacks where we meet
every Thursday, 1930 to 2300hrs. The club is based in Chester, UK. If
anyone is interested drop me a line and I\'ll give you details (the venue
has changed in the last year). There\'s plenty of space to let RPGrs, CCGrs
and Wargamers coexist.

ObTrav: although there isn\'t a Traveller game at the moment, I\'ll happily
run one. And you may even get to playtest some BITS material.

Cheers,

Dom

That may be correct (Bloo can answer better). However, in the case of 101
Religions all the Religions originally had URP codes, and there was a
wonderful expansion to the URP written by someone (the name escapes me
without digging into the files - it may have been Peter Newman). However,
we ended up dropping the URP to avoid issues with DGP. However, the
religions are generally grouped by URP type.

If you look at both IG and SJG\'s releases they are (were) covering the same
areas that DGP did, but in a different way, Thanks to Mr Sanger\'s
intransigence the DGP material is being written out of Traveller canon,
which is a shame.

With the amount of material generated by SJG, I suspect T5 will have to
focus on background packs (like M0) rather than service books when it comes
out.

I think that the EU actual recovers revenue through a direct levy on each
member government based on population and overall economic condition. The
VAT (sales) tax rate has a minimum rate to harmonise taxation across the
EU. (It\'s a while since I looked at it so I could be wrong).

If you do have PE you may like to look at Andrew Moffatt-Vallance\'s
excellent Pocket Empires spreadsheet (Excel 5) on the BITS website
(http://www.bits.org.uk/) on the Archive page.

I would also recommend looking at \'The Sparrow\' by Mary Doria Russell,
which deals with an STL Jesuit mission to Alpha Centuri. It is very
gripping and quite interesting, especially the interactions with the aliens.

I can\'t remember if I responded earlier, but this looks really good.

Out of curiosity is anyone interested in a detailed subsector for MO with
plots, npcs and ships? It\'s an idea we\'ve kicked around for a bit.

Also, the various F/PGMPs.  Way too heavy without the gravitic thang that
helps you heft it, though it\'d make a mediocre club...

When it comes to inverting a fgmp, holding by the pointy end, hefting it at

        Actually, we\'ve none left to export to the 3i, since your

        Oh,  *yawn*...  Drowning in defense funding as you are, and you
chide someone else about thrift?  Apparently your illustrious leader\'s wife
has been sharing with her husband\'s friends.

        Well then, shall we say one unescorted _Andrew Young_ against an
equivalent tonnage of SDB\'s produced in your shipyards at your tech level?
Be sure to put on plenty of that much vaunted armor...  a USP T CPAWs strips
it off pretty quickly;  it\'d be embarassing to have that 165 laser batteries
summarily sand all your weapons off.
        You vermin are TL C, yes?   So,  you can ignore the meson bays and
effectively all but 25% of the nuclear missiles I fire.  You can\'t get a
ship big enough to avoid size difference criticals...
        ...Yes, I am fairly sure I can trash 91dktons of TL C SDB\'s with the
_Andrew Young_...  I probably shouldn\'t even need to lauch the _Bulldogs_
for a PD screen.  Agreeably, should I be dealing with an Esperanzan-style
sky-darkening horde of missile boats or fighters, the lack of armor belt
will result my getting my hull sanded smooth.  However against SDB\'s, I
should do just fine.
        If you wish to make it interesting, how about we double the tonnage
to 182,000dtons and I\'ll bring in three escorts?  You should be able to
build some mighty impressive defenses with your "true technocratic fasc^h^h
real men".

        // Comments:  So, scrum it out via IRC?  I should be available next
Friday night after 9pm AST.  All bluster aside, I actually do expect you to
win....  Vs a TL B opponent, I suspect it would be no-contest in the _Andrew
Young_\'s favor.  Since at TL C you get meson screens that practically render
you immune to the 12 meson bays, it\'s just going to take too long to blow
your 12-point armor belt off before the missiles and lasers can fillet you.
Due to the computer difference, I\'ll hit and penetrate with the meson bays
on about 6% of shots, or about once every two rounds of fire (presuming you
have an agility of 6).  On an average damage roll of 7+6=13, I kill the jump
drive you don\'t own.  The CPAWs is going to be the biggest problem you have,
since I automatically hit with it and then score 27 radiation hits with
it....  so I should mission-kill one ship of yours every round.  I just
doubt I\'ll last long enough to nail them all.
          I expect to take at least 30dktons of SDB with me, but that isn\'t
the point.  =)  At TL C and above, she does need combat escorts for an
opposed entrance. //

Very likely.  The first book of short stories is IMO vastly better than the
later books in the same universe and better than anything else Drake\'s
done.  It\'s much more informed by his Vietnam experiences, I think, and has
a lot more plausibility than the later books.  Even so, there are only a
couple of stories that I would call excellent, and "Hangman" (the longest
of the short stories) is the only one I really reread.

I am, Joe and want to put them on the web somewhere so folks looking
for "Fellow Travellers" can find them.  I have about 70 at this
point, and intended to post the list back to the TML later today so
everyone can double check their info.  I wasn\'t intending to flood
the list with this, so if Rob (or anyone) thinks it should go
offlist that\'s fine by me.  You can still send directly to me if you
want on the list.

Thing is, I got to thinking about it and having the email address on
the list and having the list available for download is an invitation
to spammers.  I can strip the emails back off, but that lowers the
utility.  I could add a poison pill to all the email addresses to
make them unusable unless you remove the pill, but as easily as I
can put in the pill it could be stripped out.

What\'s the list\'s opinion, am I worrying about nothing? Would a
poison pill in the addresses be "good enough" protection?

If possible, have an "email" button next to each name, and get the email via
cgi. That way there\'s no single doc with a list of names and emails (though
it\'s not difficult to generate one, a spammer *that* desperate for a list of TML
email addresses might well have information we\'d be interested in ...)

	I\'m already on enough spam lists ... the folks at the FTC, IRS, and
US Postal Service are probably ruing the day I found out about their
spam reporting addresses (for general, "get rich quick," and pyramid
or chain letter [==felony] respectively). 

	Back to the question at hand I *believe* most spammers use various
automated tools to grab emails, so a poison pill (preferably random
and different for each address) should suffice. Or just print the
username with spaces, as in 

	"g o l d e n d j @pcisys.net"

Very good point, and I really like the e-mail button idea. I hate editing my
addresses and stuff on e-mail, so the poison pill idea (never heard it
called that) is less inviting, but a viable option. I won\'t complain either
way, I just hope some folks are a little closer than England or San Fran! ;)

Three mile driveway w/ three gates and a creek, all dirt, another eighteen
or so to "town", about a third dirt road, do I play much? Heck no, I go buy
groceries once a week, maybe see a movie or two a year. But the lake is
beautiful in the morning, and the wildlife better than TV.

Come, come. Everyone knows "The City" refers to Toronto. Just watch the
series "The City" on CTV (10 Tuesdays, unless they\'ve moved it).

OTOH, in the financial world "the City" refers to London. This is obviously
context-dependent.

Actually, I mentioned that I was writing some software that would create
detailed plants and animals (something more detailed than the existing
systems do). This type of information is exactly what I was looking for.
Thanks.



My priorities right now are:

1) Mark labs. (This will be here until June, too.)

2) Resubmit my Pyramid article on Echiste (Scott recieved it, but can\'t
find it now).

3) Design ships & vehicles for Doug\'s book.

4) Upgrade GT Shipyard (the starport enhancement).

5) Finish GT Metator (which will include the animal data).

No, I wouldn\'t like to see that.  I would LOVE to see that!!!  Things like
that are ALWAYS handy!

If you go by _Striker_ figures, the very richest worlds will have GWPs in
that range, but the average is a lot lower (though IIRC a bit higher than
Cr10,000). If you extrapolate from the price lists (food and lodging), you
get pretty close to Cr10,000.

It\'s irrelevant how it is collected. It still comes out of the total
production, leaving so much less to be shared out by the inhabitants.

If the Imperial Army is just a staff, it won\'t use the huge sums you
mention, and if they do use them, it dosen\'t go back into the economy.
It\'s not the money itself that\'s a burden, it\'s the goods the Imperial
Army buys with the money that is deducted from what is available to
the locals.

>(See MT Players Manual, p30) 

The upkeep of soc rule is incompatible with the basic price list. Either
one or the other must be wrong. Since the upkeep of soc rule IMO is broken
in other ways (at the low end of the scale a difference of one in social
level means a doubling of upkeep while at the high end it means less than
10%  --  if it was the other way around it would make more sense), I prefer
to go with the price list. Which, incidentally, is what _Pocket Empires_
did too.

Well, either that or the soc costs are seriously broken. As I said, I
believe the second option to be the correct one.

I was under the impression that starship crew earned far more than KCr13
per year. If it really isn\'t more than that, it fits quite nicely with a
dirtside average of KCr10. A 30% bonus to starship crew is not at all
unreasonable.

As for retirement pay, I agree 100% with the _Murphy\'s Rule_ that
considered it ludicrous that a retired admiral and a retired ensign
with the same number of terms served would have the same retirement pay.
That rule is broken too...

Unless you believe that the character generation rules imply that 3% of the
population are Imperial nobles, the nobles don\'t matter much in this
connection. You can fund the lifestyle of dozens of nobles with what one
navy vessel costs.

If Pyramid won\'t take it maybe another Acrobat book is in order! Not
sure what the legalities would be but I\'d love to see a move toward
"fleshing out" the Imperium again. Those were some of the most useful
articles in the old JTAS Challenge and the Digest.

I would vote (and will) vote for it if it shows up on Pyramid! Hope they
buy it off of you, but if not give the Acrobat book a thought. From what
I aee you could charge a couple of bucks for it (may be through one of
the on-line book sellers) and make some money back. The old argument
that once one is sold some one will spread it around to everyone is IMHO
somewhat out of place. THe Traveller community is tight enough that I
don\'t think we\'d scr*w one of out own, and besides form the polls being
taken, we are spread out to the point where easy copying and exchange
isn\'t proactical. The amount (or lack of) whole sale photocopies of OOP
books is good evidence of this! H*ll, if the Trav fans were doing as
much copying as some would have us think then I would be paying some of
those really outragious prices on Ebay!

Sorry to rattle on so.

Oh yeah, please do this. Please. Maps. I love maps. Not just world maps, but
city, terrain, building plans, etc. Anything which can be pointed to with

I would prefer not to have e-mail addresses on the web site at all.
I run a fantasy hockey league, and I used to have the e-mail addresses
of the league members on the league web site, until one player asked
me to remove his address because he was getting a lot of unwanted
sports-related spam -- someone was harvesting the addresses from the
web pages. So I removed the addresses entirely (except for the league
office\'s address on the front page). The amount of sports-related spam
dropped to zero within a couple of weeks, tops.

Alternate suggestion: instead of addresses, put in web site URLs.

Just my $0.03 ($0.02 in US funds)

  As a quick fix why not add B:1 rank to # of terms served? If appropriate
you could use something like [(Enlisted rank/2) -1] to get a commissioned
rank equivalent for senior enlisted , allowing long-timers to see enhanced
pension benefits, too (not that KCr 16/p.a. for an 8-term (!) E-9 engineer
necessarily seems really rich, unless he/she/it can acquire/build a second 
income, perhaps using their cash from mustering out?).

        I believe the idea is that the tax revenue from, for example,
Regina,
would be used to raise, equip, and support a corps, army, or army
group stationed on and recruited from that world.  Many items of
equipment might well be locally produced and acquired.  Military pay
and a portion of the equipment cost would be recycled into the local
economy.  I don\'t completely agree with this, but it is my understanding
of how it works.

    This I have to disagree with.  The dirtside employee has to pay for
his residence and sustenance out of his income.  The starship crew
has his domicile and upkeep supplied as part of his work conditions.
Given the same job, say steward or computer tech, I would expect the
shipboard position to pay significantly LESS that the ground-side one.

<shrug> I can see how some people might not want their email addresses up on
a webpage. Mine has popped up all over the net, in one way or another, and I
am not yet inundated with spam (I estimate that I get maybe 8 - 10 pieces on
a heavy week).

I don\'t mind my address being up, as I doubt that it will actually make me
any more visible than I already am.

at the club and then run elsewhere, thus disappearing.

  Club members also get access to the games library, which includes most

generated by World Builder Deluxe 4.1.  Thanks Mr. Ferris.  Apologies tho,
I have not had a chance to
download v5.0.   They have an island to work with and are recruiting
colonists.  They are also building
a TL 12 wet navy and SDB orbital force.  Used ships ya know.

Contract negotiations are going with the planetary government to provide
defense.  Seems the folks want
a fighting force along the lines of Dorsai or Hammers Slammers, relegated
to the presence of the island. but
on call in a moments notice.

An orbital Class A starport has been sponsored by Oberlindes Lines.  Seems
their competition, Tukera,
built the Class C? on Eqquus 02.  There was a shooting match....to say the
least, bloody.  The PCs had
major damage to their uprated Happy Fun Ball.

Hope this sparks some interest.

If you weren\'t so humble, I\'d shoot you!! Of Course!!!  I would love 
some of those!  Adventure are nice, but when the Players say, "I 
want to read the paper.  What\'s going in Congress?"  ... well, I 
usually have to scramble.  Having a basic understanding of the 
things you mention would be a nice thing.

I\'m not familiar with the "basic price list" in comparison to the "upkeep of
SOC rules?"  Have I missed a rule or is this a rules/play/mechanics
observation?  I always figured that the SOC/upkeep rule was pretty good for
a abstract rule.  We have people living in Australia who, like many places
in the world, live in parks/on the street/in the gutters/etc.  These people,
to afford to pay for a roof over their head and improved nourishment would
have to have an income many times what they get on welfare, as where to
increase my own creature comfort-zone, it would only take a raise of about
$20 or so/week or even fortnight (in my opinion... I want for little I
suppose, though I am not particularly well off?) to make a huge improvement
which is far less than 10% of what I currently earn.

Yeah, but many in NYC have illusions about how much everyone looks
past their own cities to NYC.

(When I moved out to SF, I thought refering to it as "the city" was
a local conceit, much as people in NYC have the illusion that people
outside of NYC refer to it as "the city".  But then I heard people in
San Jose Refering to SF that way.  It is the only place (NYC included)
that I\'ve heard refered to as "the city" in _another_ city :-).

I am not the one who did the extension to the URP\'s.

No probs ; you\'re welcome. 
	There are a lot of excellent references cited in the two articles I
mentioned in my post. I\'ll check them out and report back to you if you
like (Rob, you seem to have a few more \'irons in the fire\' at the moment
than I).
	Some way of graphically depicting the plants generated would be great,
if that didn\'t blow out time and coding constraints.

In MT (and probably before), there are a few systems here and there named
just "Depot". I mean, when you let 2,000 marines loose on shore leave, heck,
you don\'t want to do it in just any old system. (Though perhaps those systems
are really just the super-sized future versions of Home Depot, in which case
there would be an entire planet of screws & nails, but no one to help you)

Anyway, yes, when you think about the amount of maintenance needed for all
those Imperial naval vessels, especially when it comes to sensitive things,
like parts for cutting-edge weaponry, you need somplace big and secure.
Hence, the Depots.

If you\'re the Zhodani, maybe. Anyone else is probably plasma ten minutes out
of jump without the right transponder codes.

Ugh, since I\'m at home I can actually look something up for once... from the
MT Imperial Encyclopedia:

  "Phoenix Project: ...
   The project was said to have consisted of two distinct parts: 
   prepositioned caches of military goods to supply the coming uprising
   and a continuing program for the training of guerillas.
    The caches were concealed in many different places on Terra in areas
   calculated to preclude accidental discovery over the years."

For the Solomani, who are being pretty actively pushed on their border with
the Imperium (depending on what time you\'re talking about), this kind of
thing has some potential to be real. For the Imperium, I doubt they\'d
bother... I\'m sure the mindset of the 3I is that they\'re nigh-on invincible,
if only due to their sheer size.

Yeah! TL 12 laser-equipped grav-belt using battledress! Guarded by a guy
named LEROY! DON\'T TAKE MY PRESSSSIOUSSSSSSSSS....

*slap to the face*

Seriously, I think there\'s a M:0 adventure with this as the plot. I think
it\'s also a total dungeon crawl, so you may want to see it just so you know
what to avoid doing, unless you like dungeon crawls.

Another possibility worth considering (?) -- have BITS do a "101 Worlds"
book and include yours in it. I have one or two worlds that I could
submit to it myself...

Permanent low pressure zone (aka "it sucks") -> Evansville, IN

ObTrav: A lot of people in smaller towns, especially younger people, tend
to think that the place they are is inferior to some other place. Could it
be possible that emmigration rates from low-poplulation, lower-tech
"backwater" worlds are higher than the average throughout the Imperium? Or
does economics preclude this -- the cost of space travel outweighing any
desire to move offworld.

Does Capital/Core attract runaways like Los Angeles?

Actually, the last time I went to London, I was told that "the City" refers to
a specific part of London. Just Like Toronto has neighbourhoods like Niagara,
Riverdale, Rosedale, etc, London has Westminster, Victoria and "the City".
Confusing.

When most people say London they mean "Greater London" which is a
conurbation.  Greater London is made up of the  City  of  London,
City of Westminster, etc.  Since the City of London is  the  home
of the main financial district (with the  Bank  of  England,  the
various financial markets, merchant bank head offices, etc),  and
most players in the financial world believe they are  the  center
of the universe "the City" has  become  a  common  term  for  the
financial district (along with "the square mile").

So when someone refers to "the City" think Wall  Street  ...  but
bigger and more international.

        Hi, Steve!  Yes, they are...  should be "J", not "F"...  that USP is
generated by a spreadsheet I use for ship design...  obviously a bug in that
formula.  Thanks for pointing it out, as I had not noticed it before.

        You are correct about the hardpoints.  I did not remove the
hardpoints consumed by the bays.  Correct calculations are:

        Hull Tonnage:	                                                  91000
        Major Weapon Tonnage:	                    3000
        Remaining Tonnage for Hardpoints: 	  88000

        # Bays Installed:	36

        Available Hardpoints:	880
        Hardpoints Consumed By Bays:	360
        Remaining Hardpoints for Turrets:	520

        # Weapons for Double Turrets:	1040
        # Weapons for Triple Turrets:	1560

        USP 4 requires 10 weapons per battery, meaning I need to use double
turrets, allowing 104 batteries.  At TL15, pulse lasers get +1 USP, giving
104 USP 5 pulse laser batteries.
        
        Changes in crew requirements allow an extra 100 tons of material to
be carried and doubling the missile magazine from ~90 tons to 181 tons.
Further, decreased energy requirements allow an agility of 3.

        Cost is now MCr45109.94 and total crew now 581.

        On the topic of cargo capacity, while she unofficially has an Ops
Capacity 3.4 months based on Walt Smith\'s suggested logistics rules, in fact
2/3 of her cargo bay is gear, weapons and systems for the carried Marines.
She would really only have at most one month of endurance without a supply line.

        Mostly because against a real 10-20dkton SDB, 3 1dkton gunships are
not going to do anything except get flared.  The CPAWs is 3000dtons, BTW,
but there is a thousand tons of powerplant and another dkton in fuel to
support it.  Still...  a pair of 2500dton gunships aren\'t all that useful.
        If she gets herself into a situation that 12 meson bays and a USP T
CPAWs can\'t solve in one or two salvoes, I\'d suggest she needed escorts.  As
I commented originally, while she can hold her own to outright trash a small
SDB group, anything serious and she really ought to have three times her
tonnage in dedicated Naval support.

        There is the issue that your average dirt-sider is significantly
less likely to be traumatically exposed to either hard vaccum or jump-space.
Do not under estimate the requirement for hazzard pay.

Couldn\'t agree more! This kind of info is usable in

    I\'m giving up on the 15mm figures for my traveller games, so I have some
15mm items that I am looking to sell or trade if anyone is
interested in them.  All items are from the Quality Castings Modern lineup
and are of good quality.  They are all built and at least base coated if not
entirely painted.  There is a plethora of vehicles, dugouts, emplacements,
and of course, soldiers.

    There are a number of T-72 & T-80 tanks as well as trucks, BMP
halftracks, BRD type wheeled armored cars as well as others.
    The infantry is mostly soviet but some (18-20) of the primed figures are
NATO types.  There is about 100+ figures in total.  Infantry are all
individually based (unless it\'s a crew served weapon like a dragon or TOW).

    I can supply photos. I would like to sell in one lot, but hey money
talks.

    If you are interested, please contact me off list at scspieker@ncweb.com

Thank you for your time,

Hey Scott, 
i´d like those photos for my website. You´d be credited of course.
I am still trying to make a complete photo collection of all the 
miniatures ever produced for Traveller.
These are already a great variety of grenadier minitatures from S. Hudson

The shipboard employee also has to deal with continual travel and the massive boredom of jump space.  Living on a starship might be paid for, but it isn\'t at all _desireable_ housing.

If you consider \'extremely close to zero\' significantly higher than \'zero\', yes.  Your average steward or comp-tech is only going to be exposed to vacuum if the ship suffers drastic damage; your average traveller starship is too heavily armored to be hurt by anything it can\'t spot and dodge (or destroy) minutes in advance with a simple computerized collision avoidance program, and objects large enough to do that damage are vanishingly rare anyway.

In the same spirit, this is a cleaned-up back port of the TF-15 from 
MegaTraveller\'s Fighting Ships to High Guard.  Not *all* the ships in
FSOTSI are bad, but they\'re so typo-ridden it\'s hard to tell.  :)

The TT-15 variant is meant for assault *transport* squadrons, not 
assault *invasion* squadrons like Michel\'s ship; it\'s neither armed
nor armored to get in close and personal, although it can stand at
arm\'s length in the reserve and let the shuttles and lighters do the
landing.   

 TF-15          TF-V4313J4-049900-00000-0    MCr 173990   500 ktons
 bearing                    L                             Crew=2300 
 batteries                  Z                                 TL=15
 Agility=1 EP=15000 Fuel=415000 Cargo=12987 Skim Purif Z=40
 5x 100-ton craft.  5x 1000-ton craft.      (MCr 139192 in qty.)
 [adapted from FSOTSI, p. 89]

 The TF-15 is a typical Imperial fleet tanker, and its 415000 tons
 of fuel is divided between 250000 tons for distribution to the 
 fleet and 165000 for the power plant and one jump-3.  As dictated
 by Imperial doctrine, this auxiliary has minimal armament and low
 agility.  A variant, the TT-15, has nearly identical price but
 has 250000 tons of cargo and 12987 tons of distribution fuel, and
 is deployed in assault transport squadrons.

You\'ve OBVIOUSLY never lived and worked onboard a ship.  That free room and
board might sound great, but they don\'t make up for the problems of living
onboard.  This is true now with ocean going vessels, and I expect it\'s also
true with Starships.

Of course there are those who love shipboard life and wouldn\'t want to live
dirtside.  I suspect that catagory makes up a lot of the independants and
that they would make less, as they\'re running marginal anyway.  The huge
corporate starships probably pay a greater sum than their dirtside
equivalents.

Well, then there is that.  Hazard pay can make an undesirable job easier to
live with. :^)

Tirador, not Tiradore. Plural "Tiradores." Strictly speaking, it is a 
Sniper. However, depending on where they got the reference from (e.g. 
ancient Spanish Armies), it might simply mean a rifleman, i.e. a 
plain soldier carrying a rifle. Sniper would then be 
"francotirador." If you have lots of them, then translate "tirador" 
by "fusilier."

Infanteria de El Grande. If "El Grande" is a name, you don\'t make the 
contraction. It\'s an exception to the rule.

Fundamentally, IMTU, Cr1800-2000 per month is normal income per adult
person; children excluded to a certain extent.

When I had a party with several nobles and their children, I did charge
upkeep for the kids... Cr50*SS for infants, Cr100*SS for under 7, Cr 150 *
SS for ages 7-14, and Cr200 for 14-18 YO.

I find the rule somewhat oversimplified, but at least it provides that
Passage aboard ship counts towards Soc Upkeep... And the benefits to cre
memebrs are that they only have to spend when they are dirtside... roughly
50% of the time, thus their Cr1000 perm month is going to be eaten by
dirtside spending, IMTU, at CR 63 per week per point of soc.

It makes players come to grips with living expenses, it covers rents
appropriate to one\'s soc, and it avoids long pricelists for upkeep.

As to the "Unrealistic substitutions"...
Local lifestyles will be based upon local credits IMTU, IF you live in the
local society. If you\'re travelling a lot, you might wind up paying in
ImpCr... But the benefits and costs ballance out...  A world with a strong
Cr has lots of imported goods. A world with a Weak Cr will tend to be more
soc 1-2 servants rather than goodies, but in any case, the upkeep is
roughly the same in local Cr. If you want to be impressive throughout the
SS, then you spend ImpCr instead... and your LOCAL apparent Soc skyrockets!
and you get a cosmopolitan reputation (and possibly one for excesses).

Before MT, My GM used Cr20*(SS^2) as the upkeep costs... meant nobles
couldn\'t live on retirement pay alone.... hell, it means ship crews
couldn\'t afford to maintain soc above 7, since Rick gave no breaks for
being aboard ship.

  Yes, I intentionally made myself look like a complete idiot :-)

My point being that I was confused but the province for Boris has been 
omitted, I wanted to bring attention to it. Thank you, David for replying 
so quickly.

Note that also as with current ocean-going ships, there will be a wide
range of living and working conditions encountered.  Being chief steward
aboard an Oberlindes luxury liner is likely to be more physically pleasant
(though perhaps no less stressful) than serving as the only engineer
aboard a balky, obsolete tramp freighter with perpetually malfunctioning
life support and two crew cabins converted into spare cargo space.

I would imagine that a good fraction (pehaps a majority in some markets)
of tramp merchants have most or all crew members as members of a
partnership or corporation, working for a share in the profits.  People
wanting security will gravitate to salaried positions with the established
lines.  People wanting a chance to get rich -- or who don\'t fit in with
corporate life -- work the tramps.

You might even find that an experienced crewperson working on short-term
salaried contracts for a variety of tramps would be a bit suspect among
the tramp culture.  "Why can\'t/won\'t she join a partnership?  Who kicked
her out?" 

Interestingly, this has a parallel in my own current real-life employment. 
Software engineers wanting security work for banks or phone companies or
other established businesses.  Those of us out for glory go with new media
outfits or internet startups or the like, and work partly for stock
options which likely will never have any real value -- but if they ever
*do*, we get to retire right then.  And we calmly deal with the fact that
we will likely have to change jobs involuntarily every 2-3 years as the
industry chews up and spits out a third of the existing companies every
year (I imagine tramp companies have a similar failure rate).

    IMTU, the ship continues to provide residence and meals for the
crew even in port (except for the two weeks of annual maintenance 
and/or any major damage repairs).  Most crewmembers in port 
WILL frequently dine and possibly even live off-ship, especially if
you\'re in port for an extended time, but that is by choice and for
entertainment and taste reasons.
    The provision of room and board, IMO, should be around a 50%
decrease in salary.  Hazard pay of 10% (the risk isn\'t normally THAT
great) and hardship pay of 30% would still leave a 10% loss. YMMV.

That would be great, but seems like a serious task. Perhaps some use of
fractals?  A clip art object library? If it could be done, that would be
very nice.

Well, I admit I\'m biased here.  But given her light armor and agility, I\'d
think you\'d be better off stripping the extraneous weapons and putting her
in the reserve behind an real cruiser or two.  Then you can launch and 
recover landing craft from the safety of the reserve and let the cruisers
take the beating.  Steve\'s gunboats and fighters could be used to escort 
landing craft and provide ortillery support, if they were added -- or as
an alternative, they could be used in place of the cruisers as a screen
themselves (although fighter casualties might get pretty severe).

Even with her PAWS-T, I\'d expect a "real 10 to 20 kton SDB" to thrash the
_Andrew Young_ pretty badly; it probably would have a pretty serious PAWS
or meson gun of its own, and defenses to match.

The request about system writeups got me thinking. Does anyone
else write up periodic news articles (sort of TNS, but local) for their
players to read before, during and after an adventure?  I tried it a few
times, and I  must admit that the players really appreciated it. There
were a few plot related atricles, a few totally non related, and some
\'dunnos\'. I think it added a little colour to the game, and most of it was
taken from my local newspaper, scanned in, and manipulated slightly.

Does anyone else regularly do this? Would you be willing to share 
the generic stories with other list members? Obviously not plagiarising
your local press like I did, but the outlines if nothing else?

Comments?

XML

Don\'t ask me to parse XML (compiler construction classes are
fuzzy in my memory); however, creating XML documents is
fun and easy.  Sticking to a standard format for the data might
take more doing (no matter what encoding we use).

My XML proposal, then, is to format data in this way.  Suggestions
are welcome (as if anyone\'s going to bother pawing through this
data in the first place!).

Yep. I have a whole pile of them. I\'ve even gone to the trouble of calculating
the time it takes for the news release to get from where it was issued to where
the characters are, so that the players get a feel for how slow communication
is.

IMTU, it\'s roughly 202-1107, and the players have *just* found out about the
Zhodani invasion that starts the Fifth Frontier War.

Your XML is a start but still looks rough. Especially the character example.
If we want to use XML we need to make it clean.

Sydney Australia is generally refered to as \'Town\', ie "Just going into
Town for a movie".

Even though we have a city size bigger than Greater London. Chalk one up
for culteral cringe.

I don\'t subscribe to Pyramid, but publish it any way you can. If I don\'t

What "proprietary"? The INI format (which is also used by OS/2) is a
relatively *simple* TEXT format.

You search for the section headers you recognize, and in those
sections, you process the tags you recognize.

One of the scarier scenes in military SF was in one of Pournelle\'s

a stadium (would-be revolutionaries). 

And they start firing vollety after volley into the crowd. Brrr.

I suspect that "N kilometers" is likely the rule. Or "N diameters". By
analogy with national boundaries, where the old rule amounted to "as
far as shore batteries could reliably fire".

I can see arguments for various distances based on weapons range, and
on the 10 & 100 diameter jump limits. Or purely arbitrary ranges.

I don\'t think most worlds would care to have any sort of "close"
satellite (say out .5 light sec) be considered outside their
jurisdiction. Makes for far too many military and smuggling problems.

CGM is a vector format designed for data interchange. And a lot of
drawing programs support it, at least as an import or export format.

I may have a file describing the basics around here somewhere.

As someone who works on Pyramid every week (but has no influence on what
gets published or not), I think it is an excellent idea.

        Hi, Steve!
        Before I start arguing with you, I\'ll start by saying I agree
completely =).  The _Andrew Young design came from a series of role-play
like discussions that went back and forth on the TML a few months ago.  She
was indirectly described to be a) a single ship I-MiB task group, b)
something that the destination/ target system was *very* concerned about.
        Based on indirectly learned and largely assumed specifications, I
started wondering what sort of MiB ship would be required to concern/
frighten light-TL, lower-POP worlds.  3 fully geared brigades with integral
orbital fire support seemed to be a good start.  Having one entire brigade
MAT deployed also seemed impressive.  Meson guns are the prefered
battlefield artillery, so I figured having several hanging in orbit seemed
good, too.  Nothing that is going to have to do some intimitdating should go
without a spinal, so I went for the meanest PAWs on the chart...  Against
light-TL opponents, that means a mission-kill per pull of the trigger...
and the meson bays are unopposed at TLs 10 & 11, so she can concieveably
kill 6 ships every round by herself...  against a lower-POP world\'s defense
group, that\'s a considerable amount of damage...  the mit-full of lasers are
great for fighter and patrol-cruiser swatting, too.  3G\'s, Jp3, Agility 3;
long legs and capable of running with battle cruisers;  that seemed to make
sense too, in case force projection wound up *outside* 3i borders.
        So, that is where the design came from.

        I personally am of the opinion that any real planetary invasion is
going to make WWII Normandy look like a Berkely civil rights protest march.
Particularly if the defender has deep meson sites.  However, that\'s not how
the discussion was angled.

        I did a much more reasonable "AY-Light" called the "Normandy-class".
4700 tons, one battalion per, only 47 USP3 beam turrets and nuclear dampers.
Totally dependant on other Naval assets to even leave the home system, let
alone get into an opposed orbit.  Much cheaper, and smaller.  Also
considerably more disposable.  However, each one needs to drag around ten
times it tonnage in escorts....  and you need 10 of them to total the
_Andrew Young\'s_ troop capacity.  Which negates any cost advantage.  Its an
eggs vs baskets distribution philosophy discussion.

Yes (sort of), and yes. I make use of handouts, but not as elabourate
as what you describe. Most often, the handouts consist of dispatches from
the TAS news service and/or entries from the Imperial Encyclopedia -- the
latter usually wind up in the adventure writeups on the campaign web site.

Sometimes, the handouts take the form of mission briefings, when the
adventure is a mission assigned to the PCs by their superiors. (The PCs
are secret agents for the IISS.) (These briefings are remarkably similar
to those in the old "Mission: Impossible" tv show, except the handouts
don\'t self-destruct at the end...)

I also have a binder with subsector maps and data for the entire
Dagudashaag sector (in which the campaign is based), which the players
may examine at any time. ("Let\'s go here next...")

In the meantime, if you want to "steal" the adventures from my campaign
to use in yours, go right ahead. :)

  Don\'t forget descriptions of the worlds. Just combining look at
the canonical astrography and UWPs and trade route information
with few additional assumptions and describing the results can
give a subsector an amazing amount of color and variety.
  Another possibility which has the same advantages and
disadvantages as having published sectors in the first place, is
fixing the economic extension, world character, technological
variants, and political relationships described in Pocket
Empires. This can make a few plots almost write themselves, but
it\'s a lot of work for one GM to do himself.

This is an interesting issue.  3,000 years ago, Judaism was already some
2,500 years old.  Many other contemporary religions of that region were
at least as old as Judaism -- and the Egyptian religion was probably
older.  Still, no other religions from that region and time have
survived.  What gives a religion longevity?  How does that play out in a
civilization that (1) emphasizes reason over the other aspects of self,
such as spirituality, emotion, the body, etc. and (2) comes in contact
with life that is outside the context of religious traditions and
writing?

My Traveller Universe has a lot of adherents.  Some wear medals of the

If you\'re ever in Portland, Oregon, go to the Coin-Operated Church of
Elvis downtown -- and then to the UFO Museum on Burnside Street.  Trust

Here on the Gold Coast, there are things that can only be found in "the
City" which is Brisbane.  However, I have friends that live on the outskirts
of Sydney who often say they "went to a club in \'the City\' the other
night..." ie: Sydney.  I hear the same from friends near Melbourne too.
Perhaps there are many "Cities?"

Please. Getting into a university library nowadays is tricky: the main UofT
library no longer even lets people _in_ without student cards. Which makes
for difficulties when you attend a meeting held there. I can walk into any
lab on campus, including the reactor, but no go to the library...

I agree, but I\'m a hobbyist programmer and wouldn\'t even know how to begin
working on that problem. Ditto for animals. I _will_ be able to provide
information like sensory clusters, symmetry, locomotive means, and so forth
- - just not turn that into a picture for you.

Amen Roc Baby. It\'s the increase in money after expenses that make
a-l-l-l-l-l-l the difference to your pay packet. After-all, a $25 increase
is a slab of beer!

BTW in regards to the dilemma of Pensions, someone\'s post to Freelance
Traveller had a cool fix. I think it was Pension is equal to 3k (+100 cr per
enlisted rank or 300 cr per officer rank), + 1.5k (+100 cr per enlisted rank
or 300 cr per officer rank) for each term 6+. It had a nice effect of
justifying why senior NCO\'s wouldn\'t go for OCS as they\'d drop in pension.

Seemed to work out nice and remove the nasty ratings = admirals and ensigns
= admirals.

Apologies if this has already been mentioned. My mailer is slow.

Falkenberg\'s Legion stories. They\'ve got thousands of people trapped in
a stadium (would-be revolutionaries). 

And they start firing vollety after volley into the crowd. Brrr.
******************
The story was "The Mercenary", copyrighted 1972 by Conde Nast
publications, reprinted in Analog magazine\'s 1983 _War_and_Peace_
anthology.

	The doors burst open.  The armed troopers moved quickly across the
top of the stadium.  Most of the mob was below, and a few unarmed men were
struck down when they tried to oppose the regiment....
	<a bit cut>
	"PREPARE FOR VOLLEY FIRE!" Falkenberg called.  "MAKE READY!  TAKE
AIM.  IN VOLLEY, FIRE!"
	Seven hundred rifles crashed as one.
	"FIRE!"
	Someone screamed, a long drawn-out cry, a plea without words.
	"FIRE!"
	I was like one shot, very loud, lasting far longer that a rifle
shot ought to, but impossible to hear individuall weapons.
	"THE FORTY-SECOND WILL ADVANCE.  FIX BAYONETS.  FORWARD, MOVE.
FIRE!  FIRE AT WILL."
	Now there was a continuous crackle of weapons.  The leather-clad
lines moved forward, down the stadium seats, inexorably toward the press
below.
	"SERGEANT-MAJOR!"
	"SIR!"
	"MARKSMEN AND EXPERTS. FIRE ON ALL ARMED MEN."
	"SIR!"
	Calvin spoke into his communicator.  Two sections fell out of the
advancing line, took cover behind the seats.  The began to fire, carefully
but rapidly.  Anyone below who raised a weapon died.
	"GRENADIERS, PREPARE TO THROW," Falkenberg ordered.  "THROW!"  A
hundred grenades arched out, down into the milling crowds below.  Their
muffled explosions were masked by the screams of terror.  "IN VOLLEY,
FIRE!"
	The regiment advanced, made contact with the mob below.  There was
a brief struggle.  Rifles fired, bayonets flashed red, the line halted
momentarily.  Then it moved on, leaving behind a ghastly trail.
	Men were jammed a the stadium exits, trampling each other in a
scamble to escape.  There was a rattle of gunfire from outside.
	<small cut>
	Suddenly it was over.  There was no opposition, only screaming
crowds, men throwing away weapons to run with their hands in the air,
falling o their knees to beg for quarter.  A final volley crashed out,
then a deathly quiet fell over the stadium.
	But it wasn\'t quiet, Hamner discovered.  The guns were silent, the
men no longer shouted, but there was sound.  Screams of wounded men.

ObTrav:  There are any number of ways to put the players in it.  From
playing the role of Falkenbergafter the incident, being in the crowd, etc.

Here on the Gold Coast, there are things that can only be found in "the
City" which is Brisbane.  However, I have friends that live on the outskirts
of Sydney who often say they "went to a club in \'the City\' the other
night..." ie: Sydney.  I hear the same from friends near Melbourne too.
Perhaps there are many "Cities?"
- - -- The Roc


Blame it on Aussie Soaps (you UK types will know what I\'m on about). They
always use the generic as opposed to the specific almost every time, "Goin\'
to the city tomorrow", "spendin\' time in the big smoke?" etc. I think it\'s
so people near the capital cities will believe it\'s their \'city\' that
they\'re referring to so as to create loyal viewers.  

Don\'t know why though. It\'s funny when they use the generic city in big
blockbusters. Watching Matrix and spotting all the Sydney locations was
pretty weird. And of course who can forget Dolph\'  Lundgren\'s \'The
Punisher\', with its Aussie Valiants and CES signs everywhere. 

Ob Traveller: Do Soaps exist in the Third Imperium. Are they generic? Or
perhaps each broadcaster simply substitutes world names for one\'s in their
region?

IMTU Gene Roddenberry has a status equivalent to Shakespeare with the Spock
role being the most sought after.

When I write news articles I write treads, two our more news articles
which run over a period of time sometimes months. Makes the news more
believable, although the odd one off it always good.

I generally use the international section of news papers, or the
television to think up news stories, but I find it hard to think on
the Interstellar level. What would make a good local news item doesn\'t
necessarily make a good interstellar news item.

I\'d love to hear if you have any good sources as my news writing has
dried up at the moment.

Give the scientist a research grant (not enough, obviously) and have them
recruit a crew for a lab ship (not the PDB lab ship, obviously) for some
extended investigation somewhere. Start her/him off on some low pop, low
law, starport C world in search of a crew - or maybe some more crew
following an accident (if there was any choice, would the scientist really
be likely to hire the other PCs?)

Your bunch of rogues hears rumours that is not just science but a treasure
hunt so they try to sign up (possibly by "discouraging" other applicants)
so your scientist character gets to play patron with some npcs in support
and try to control the rest of the party, plus your rogues get people
actively watching over them and will have to use some more imagination
in their dealings.

Then you could run Twilight\'s Peak, Long Way home or Expedition to Zhodane.

If one of the rogues or one of their contacts is already a trusted member
of the crew, so much the better - just get out your copy of "Treasure Island".

The trick is not to get the good guy feeling like the team leader in a
paranoia party (especially if they are not an experienced roleplayer of
strong character - as you seem to imply.) So they must be the channel for
funds and legitimacy for the rogues - who can then adopt him/her like the
Jim Hawkins character. You could even run a scenario where the rogues are
trying to assist the scientist in making a research grant application after
funding dries up just when success is on the horizon.

Just giving the scientist a ship and pots of money is just asking for the
player to have to roll up a new character...

I would agree if we were talking about a loose alliance of worlds
but the Imperium is a little different.  Perhaps rather than  say
"a  world\'s  jurisdiction  ends  at",  we   should   "a   world\'s
jurisdiction is superceded at".

Consider that in  RL  cities  don\'t  have  major  crime  problems
because metro police jurisdiction ends at the  city  limits.  But
jurisdiction  does  pass  to  state  police.   In  the  same  way
planetary law enforcement and military would liase with  Imperial
and/or colonial authorities.

Also, when in active pursuit of fleeing criminals, or  endangered
by orbiting military vessels, I think these would  be  exceptions
to the  rule.  Additionally,  when  Imperial  forces  are  absent
(commonly in backwater systems) a local planetary  authority  may
be expected to "step into the breech".

In contrast, I  see  planetary  authority  in  the  Sword  Worlds
Confederation (and many independant worlds, too) to be everything
within reasonable STL travel.

At least that\'s how I handle it IMTU ... IYTU YMMV

I\'ve not yet done it for Traveller, as the start of my campaign has
been delayed, but I plan to produce TNS-style articles once things
kick off.  They will not be actual TNS articles, just other news
agency reports, as the campaign is beginning before the founding of
the Third Imperium, and as far as I am aware, the TNS did not exist
officially at that time.

For the Cyberpunk 2020 campaign I\'m running, I give the players
"Screamsheets" (1 or 2 page collections of the latest news stories)
from time to time, as reading news reports of their latest raids allows
them to \'see\' how their actions are affecting things on a larger scale,
or politically, as that can be difficult to see from street-level.  I
also include humorous articles, and campaign red herrings.  The players
know that each Screamsheet contains at least one clue to the campaign,
and listening to them as they try to identify it, is often entertaining.

I\'ve also got a WFRP campaign starting in a few weeks, where the
characters will be able to hear news from around the Empire quickest,
by word-of-mouth from the people traveling by stagecoach.  The
\'Official\' news and declarations will be one or two stagecoaches behind.
Again, this allows me to put a political \'spin\' on events, in the
official versions of the stories, allow stories to grow by their telling
as they get further from the source, and give the characters clues in
the differences between the version they heard first, and the official
version.  There is also the opportunity for the characters to travel to
the village that they heard was attacked by a Chaos warband, to find
that it is nothing more sinister than an unsolved murder at the edge of
the woods surrounding the village.

ObTrav: First paragraph.

That\'s enough rambling for now.  I\'m off to lurk again...

The ship\'s crew that lives aboard with no other fixed address has to be
something of a rarity. It may well be one of the romantic stereotypes that
gets fixed in the (non-spacefaring) public\'s imagination, but I sincerely
doubt it accounts for a significant fraction of even free traders\' crews,
let alone corporate-owned liner ships.

The reason is simple: most people want to have families, and families are
terribly difficult and uneconomical to maintain aboard. Traveller
characters, just by virtue of the character generation system, are almost
to a one single, never married, and over 30 years old. How many of those do
you know personally? They make great adventurers, but should not be
regarded as typical by any means.

The vast majority of crewmembers are likely to be hirelings, with no
attachment to a particular ship. They have homes and families onplanet.
They take their skills to the hiring hall in the local startown, where a
broker (union-hired where unions are legal, freelance otherwise) sets them
up with a ship for a small percentage. They hire on for one specific
voyage, either a round trip (common for subsidized merchants) or to a
certain point where they can catch a ship in the return direction (as crew,
working passage, or using the repatriation bond provided with the contract,
in descending order of preference). The voyages are several months long,
but the crew make enough to stay home for several months before venturing
out again. Officers may be more closely tied to a particular ship, but even
so there will still be some personnel turbulence.

Salary-wise, this means that ship\'s crews have to make roughly twice the
salary they need to live on while they are working, since they only work
half the time. On the other hand, if contract rates are normally paid in
Imperial credit, a favorable exchange rate may make even a common spacehand
very wealthy indeed by local standards.

[In the real world, salary rates for merchant marine crewmen aren\'t
significantly higher than shore-based positions that require the same
qualifications and experience. The difference is overtime: salaries are
calculated on a 40-hour week. Standing watch at night? Time-and-a-half.
Ship still at sea on Saturday? Double-time. Can\'t get into harbor because
it\'s a holiday? Triple-time. And so on. The officers of the S.S. Empire
State told me that they make three to four times their nominal salary in
overtime on a typical voyage.]

Obtaining shares in a ship is both dream and nightmare to these people,
because it means big money but the end of freedom. You can\'t just jump ship
when you get tired of it, when you\'re part-owner. I suspect, in fact, that
many spacers do own shares in ships that they don\'t serve on. They collect
their dividends from the bank, and try to accumulate enough equity to one
day trade it all in for a downpayment.

I\'m sure that there are ships with families aboard. They are likely to be
cargo-only operations -- who wants their children to share their home with
strangers? CJ Cherryh\'s Merchanters are a good model for this type of crew,
as is a /dreskay/-run Droyne ship. But how many of these have ever been
detailed in canon? None, that I know of.

[Lyle, I\'m not picking on you specifically -- yours was the most convenient
lead-in.]

One of my PBEM characters is a member of the Reformed Solomani Catholic Church.  You can\'t get his St Elvis medal off of him with nuclear explosives, even though it\'s *been* awhile since he picked up a hymnal & sang \'Blue Swede Shoes\'.  Another character in a different game wears a St Marx medal (offshoot Russian Orthodox Catholic).

I do two slightly different things, which seem to work well...
I distribute them before a session, so that we don\'t use valuable
playing time familiarising with the situation.

1. Generic handouts of the "what you learned in school" type -
   what everyone knows about the technology, politics, geography
   etc of the campaign area.

2. "Teasers" for the bigger adventures - writeups done as a script
   for the part of the adventure that would come before the titles
   if this were a movie. This is an idea I stole from the Star Wars
   RPG.

The ones for the current campaign are gradually appearing on my
website... go to

http://www.halfwaystation.freeserve.co.uk/

then select Blue Quadrant, Cartography, Dark Nebula. [Sorry,
I\'m working offline some way from home and can\'t remember the
exact URL for the campaign page.]

If anyone takes a look at the site, I\'d appreciate some feedback
on whether it is interesting/worthwhile/amusing for anyone
outside the campaign, and any suggestions for what it should have
more/less of...

Thanx -

Limited Imperial Corporations (LIC\'s) are more common than I (and perhaps
Jim Maclean and Bloo) thought.

Out of about 80 businesses listed for Koenig\'s Rock, there are 7 identified
LIC\'s:

Hortalez et Cie
LSP
Sternmetal Horizons
Delgado Trading
HaamLIC
DeLambre Frere, LIC
Bowman Salvage, LIC

The first four are obviously offices of large or megacorporations, but the
last three appear to be local. That\'s about 4% of the total, not counting
businesses that aren\'t named or don\'t use "LIC" in their title. Considering
that Bowman isn\'t a member of the Imperium (although it is a
client/protectorate) and even though this is a sample of one, the
"Emperor\'s Share" may be more significant to Imperial revenues than
previously thought.

What can I do to bring these characters together? The person playing the

Phil Kitching already mentioned the "needs a crew" angle. Here\'s my $0.02...
pick one or merge a couple.

1. "I need a thief."

"Did the little skinny one say he was a thief? Good, I need a thief. Stop

"But sir! Grond is in a battle frenzy. It would take a 30lb boulder dropped

Your pirate/soldier need expertise the scientist/scout have. Knowledge of
an esoteric process or place, perhaps. The pirate/rogue might initially
kidnap/recruit the scientist/scout to help investigate rumours of an
Ancient artifact; the group might then coalesce as they work together,
although there is likely to be a showdown when they\'ve got it, as they
will have different ideas of what to do with it.

2. "He ain\'t heavy, he\'s my brother."

Romantic or family links can excuse a lot, especially if the group have a
shared goal ("We must penetrate the jungles of Hickworld, risking our
lives among the cannibal pygmies, to find the cure for Aunt Minnie".) or a
shared enemy ("So, Vargr corsair, we meet at last! You killed our parents,
prepare to die!")

3. "Help! We\'re in a disaster movie!"

Thrust them into a series of situations where they must cooperate to
survive. Again, friendship or romance might develop under shared
dangers as they do in the movies. ("The only way we\'re going to get off
Acheron alive is if we work as a team.")

4. "Impossible Missions Force"

The patron for their initial commission decides he needs the mix of skills
the characters have to achieve his goal. He keeps the team together to
start with, and again they bond while on the mission. ("Finding my
missing nephew will require an intimate knowledge of the Hick Subsector,
and the scientific training needed to evaluate the clues. Since I
suspect Baron Badguy hault-Plotdevice is behind his disappearance, you
will also need a bodyguard and someone with criminal connections.")

Re message transmission......

I have considered the message delay thing for a long time. Some time ago
I spoke to a couple of people about working out a software solution to it.

What is required is this. 

Locations of news sources throughout the Imperium (we\'ve got that)
Distances to other systems, and thus travel times of messages/news,
this being done primarily on xboat routes for major wide reaching stories,
and filtered as and when for \'local\' interest.
Chance for information to be passed on to feeder worlds
If a real time database is run, each message can have its id, and propogate
itself throughout the database as time moves on.

Easy huh? Now all we need is someone to do it.....

For those who\'ve been holding their breath waiting for *the* most looked
forward to bit of Traveller arcana, here - at last - is an index to _101

reading of a sort.

Note: Only the religion titles have been indexed.  One day I might get
round to indexing all the significant terms in the book but I\'d rather
finish the M0 Campaign index I started years back.  Though I don\'t suppose
anyone actually wants it anymore.

OK, so our basic assumptions differ. As I mentioned before, the way I see
it only the richest worlds have those kinds of income.

Rent appropiate to one\'s soc? Average food costs Cr200/month and so does
average accomodation. So a soc 7 person pays Cr1350 per month for everything
other than food and lodging. Less than 25% spent on food and lodging? Most
of the real life figures I have heard puts it at 60-80%.

Even luxury food and lodging only runs to Cr1200/month. So either soc 7
people enjoy a luxury lifestyle, or there\'s something wrong with the
Cr250/level rule.

OTOH, an Imperial duke can manage on Cr3,750/month, which is good going
for someone who is more importan thant any ruler the Earth has ever seen
to this day. 

>Before MT, My GM used Cr20*(SS^2) as the upkeep costs... meant nobles
>couldn\'t live on retirement pay alone.... 

Not that I want to defend the abovementioned rule, but why would you expect
a noble to be able to live on retirement pay alone? Nobles are expected to
have money of their own. It\'s perfectly reasonable that those that don\'t
would have problems keeping up an appropiate lifestyle.

IMTU I use 20% of final pay for each term served after the third (20% for
4 terms, 40% for 5 terms, etc. up to a maximum of 100% for 8 terms served).
So an ensign and an admiral who had both served 7 terms would both get 80%
of their final pay, but they would have very different final pay.

A military base is a tremendous boost to any local economy, no doubt about
that. But people often forget that _somebody_ always pays. If the people
of Regina are taxed to pay for an Imperial Army corps, then some Reginans
will undoubtedly benefit from the business generated by the corps. But some
other Reginans will pay for it. Any military unit is a net loss.

That\'s assuming he is a tramp spacer with no fixed abode. I see no reason
why most spacers wouldn\'t have a home (and a spouse) somewhere along the
route of the regular ship he is serving on.

Maybe the spacers have a great union.

	I have always liked to provide certain information in the

	news stories.  My problem is that I never seem to have the
	time to come up with good news stories that add colour, 
	give the players a sense of the social and political context,

	That is a sad state of affairs.  It offends my sense of what

You\'ve OBVIOUSLY never lived and worked onboard a ship.  That free room and
board might sound great, but they don\'t make up for the problems of living
onboard.  This is true now with ocean going vessels, and I expect it\'s also
true with Starships.

Of course there are those who love shipboard life and wouldn\'t want to live
dirtside.  I suspect that catagory makes up a lot of the independants and
that they would make less, as they\'re running marginal anyway.  The huge
corporate starships probably pay a greater sum than their dirtside
equivalents.

Well, then there is that.  Hazard pay can make an undesirable job easier to
live with. :^)

Then there is the food, on small ships at least it is all pre-packaged,
imagine having to eat airline food day after day  after day.

	I have generally insisted that my players develop characters
	that are compatable, to avoid these sorts of situations.
	There have been cases, however, where such intraparty friction
	develops or is even encouraged (it can make for some great
	roleplaying and interesting plots).  The more extreme the
	differences in the group, the more delicate and unstable the
	balance that must be maintained.  You can make the "good" 
	character a family member of the biggest/meanest "bad" guy,
	or perhaps said "bad" guy owes his/her life to the "good" guy.
	This may work, as long as the "bad" guy is not too "bad."
	The "good" guy might be a friend of a really really nasty
	organsization that strikes fear into the hearts of the 
	players.  The "good" guy can be incredibly useful to the 
	group, but this is difficult unless the "good" guy has
	powers/skills that cannot be got elsewhere.  Finally, there
	is cold, hard credits: The "good" guy has access to a hefty
	bankroll (trust fund, research grant, rich uncle, etc.).
	It may not work forever, but so what?  There could be some 
	fun play before the nasties finally snuff him.

	Actually, I know many people that fit that description, in

	A lot of real world sailors come from countries where the

	are dominated by travellers from nearby poor, low-tech

	Good point, the high pay of starship crews can be assumed

Back when I was running TNE one of the players played a scientist. She was
interested in the fields of cybernetics and genetic engineering... only
those two fields became frowned upon once the Reformation Coalition came
into power. As their centralized power grew, she lost more and more of her
research money. So, she fell in with pirates and rogues and the like. By the
time the campaign started, she was a brutal blackguard in her own right. ;)

One way to keep the group together is to make sure to script the plots in a
way that requires different skills at different times. With all due respect
to you, it sounds like it\'s as much a problem with the kind of game you\'re
running as it is with the character clashes. Perhaps the scientist isn\'t
getting enough "screen time[1]" in relation to the other characters?

Some people become horrified when I bring up the concept of plotting games.
There are folks who really like running loose games that take shape as a
given game progresses. This is fine if the characters all share a certain
set of skills (usually combat skills), or if significant segments of the
game are pure *role*playing (more interaction, few skills in use). However,
when you\'ve got someone like a scientist, who is specialized, you\'re really
going to have to write him into the game in some way so that his ability to
contribute is roughly equal to that of the more combat oriented characters
in your campaign.

Nothing sucks more as a player than sitting around with nothing to do, and
that sounds like what your player with the scientist character is doing.

[1] Screen Time - My own term for the amount of time a player is in the
spotlight in a given game. How frequently the player is able to use his
specialties in an entertaining manner that he feels are worthwhile
contributions to the campaign.

Fair enough.  For my part, there are things about the TF-15 that I\'d change

I have the TNS stories printed out 1 story to a page for  use  as
player handouts (on the appropriate campaign dates) but I haven\'t
got around to adding \'local\' stories yet.

I also have three pairs of ring binders ... one pair  contain  an
atlas of known space (one for the players and a more complete and
accurate version for me),  one  pair  contain  a  ship  catalogue
including "All The Emperor\'s Fighting Ships" (again one  for  the
players and a more complete and accurate version for me), and one
pair contains Library Data (again different versions for the  ref
and the players).

Sometimes they get briefing orders (they are still in service  in
the IN) done up in a style similar on the back of the AHL box.

But the biggest  group  of  player  handouts  are  the  equipment
sheets: those things from the MT Referee\'s Kit and some issues of
Digest and Megatraveller  Journal  magazines.  However,  I  don\'t
just use them as equipment info for key items,  they\'re  used  as
tokens for specific pieces of equipment.  Thus  if  a  PC  has  2
daggers then the player has 2 dagger equipment  sheets.  Each  PC
has a folder for their character sheet and any  equipment  sheets
taken out of the  folder  with  the  character  sheet  represents
equipment the PC has with them,  equipment  sheets  left  in  the
folder represents equipment the  character  has  but  at  another
location (eg. left onboard their ship).  When a PC lends his  ACR
to another character the relevant equipment sheet is passed  over
to the other player.  This system works really  well  and  avoids
arguments over who has what, and do they have it with them,  etc.
The only downsides are making up equipment sheets for things  DGP
didn\'t cover, and making sure there are enough copies.

A similar treatment to character sheets also works well.  When  a
PC is about  to  attempt  something  dangerous  they  hand  their
character sheet to me (the Ref): if they survive they  get  their
character sheet back; if not it is torn in  half.  Stangely  this
makes some players hesitate before doing something hazardous  and
reconsider.  The physical destruction of a character sheet  seems
to make character death  more  \'real\'.  Players  become  far less
gung-ho!

	Counterproposal: in my Library Program script, I want to ensure that
even raw data is completely human readable via a standard web
browser. So I\'m using stock HTML to format the entries. The script
will parse the HTML to extract necessary information, and reformat
for display to the enduser (usually by stripping out extraneous
stuff). But the original data file can be read and edited using any
HTML editor or notepad. That also allows me to easily expand the
display formatters. I can define a new type and add a module to
process it. But if the right processing module is missing, the data
still gets displayed in the "raw" but readable format. I\'m thinking
of using an HTML definition list to delineate tag/value pairs.
Example:

<h1>Sir Crai Belden</h1>

   <dt>Ruleset
   <dd>CT

Dear Postmaster/others,

	I\'ve forwarded this email to you because either 
		(a) it appears to originate from your domain, 
		(b) the headers indicate it passed through your domain, 
		(c) it includes a reply or contact address showing this jackass is
also operating out of your domain, or 
		(d) everything else seemed completely forged and your domain was
the first identifiable intermediary between the origin IP and my ISP.

	Can you please help stop this growing cancer across the Internet?
Unsolicited commercial mail is going to be the ruin of another
otherwise useful idea if it isn\'t solved by the users. I\'ve just
about reached the point where I\'m going to ignore ALL email coming
from certain domains as it is. This is really getting out of hand,
and I ask your help in stomping out the jackasses such as the
original author of the bilge below. Thank you.

	*** You might also note that the USPS considers pyramid schemes such
as this to be a federal crime.  And the fig leaf of "selling a
report" IS IRRELEVANT ... it\'s still a chain letter, and hence mail
fraud ... It also doesn\'t matter that the solicitation came via
email, as the scheme uses the US Postal Service. ***

Dear submoronic cretin (not you, Postmaster),

	This mail was unsolicited, unwanted, uninteresting, unwelcome, and I
consider it harassment. You\'re using my bandwidth, my mailbox, my
paid online time, my download time, my hard disk and my personal time
to screen an unwelcome, worthless piece of junk. Remove my name at
once from your mailing lists, and do not ever bother me again. There
are many places on the Internet to advertise your services, but my
mailbox isn\'t one of them. If I wanted a service I\'d go where ads are
appropriate and search for it. I will never utilize a service nor a
product from a company which uses spam to solicit business.

	And quoting poorly written, crappy PROPOSED legislation which is
*NOT* and may never become law doesn\'t mean squat. So take your "in
compliance of the new e-mail bill: SECTION 301, Paragraph (a)(2)(C)
of s. 1618" and this garbage, and stuff it.

I agree. Part of the problem, I think, also lies in lack of experience or
not having played in awhile. 3 of the 5 players are fairly new to Traveller,
with one being new to RPG\'s. Not to mention, It was only about 6-9 months
ago that I picked up my ol\' Traveller books and started playing again.

We\'re only two game sessions into this campaign and this is the first time
this group has ever played together. So, I\'m not sure if it\'s just
player-styles clashing or what.

I\'ve been trying to come up with adventures that would gear more towards the
scientist. The "fighters" seem to get into trouble no matter what they do.
;)

Thanks for everyone\'s advice.

Description: This campaign shares time with a 2300AD campaign and a Star
Wars campaign; we shift games once per year generally.  The campaign has
progressed from CT to MT and beyond for background, and we switched to
modified TNE rules in 1995.  Currently at 1159; rebellion is pretty much
done, but Dulinor and a large fleet retreated into the area rimward of the
Trojan Reach, and remains a thorn in the Imperial side.  The rebellion has
badly damaged the Imperium, and recovery is underway; many rogue navy units
remain as pirate threats.

I have TealDoc, and use it for books etc. However, what I was after was
finding out if the Memo Pad on the Palm III allows bigger memos than that
on the Palm Pilot Pro. Or if there is a third party editor. The idea is to
have something I can work on bigger texts, not having to truncate files
across a number of memos.

I know I\'ve mentioned it before but take a look at

The Traveller Adventure has a model for news propagation in the Imperium.

Sure.  Look at any adventure movie (well, *almost* any).  You\'ll find the
"strange bedfellows" theme popping up over and over, since it generates
such nice character interaction possibilities.  Think Leia and Han in Star
Wars IV, or the pair in Romancing the Stone, or that last Sean Connery
movie...as I said, it\'s pretty universal.  The trick is to set things up
so that a group of people who ordinarily wouldn\'t give each other the time
of day...or would actually start shooting at each other on sight...instead
are utterly reliant on one another to achieve some very important common
goal.

Making this work is a challenge for the GM, but not an overwhelming one.
Perhaps the rogues have information about the location of some artifact
(or species, or tribe, or whatever) that the scientist is passionately
interested in studying, while the rogues want to exploit some aspect of
it...but can\'t, without the scientist\'s help solving some puzzle.

The neat thing about this is that characters can actually change and grow.
Maybe the scientist gets a bit less ivory-towerish about how she handles
things, mixing in some practical considerations, while maybe one or two of
the rogues learn to appreciate knowledge for its own sake.  And of course
the opportunities for Taming of the Shrew-style intellectual battle
leading to romance are very strong in a case like this.

Good luck!

You will be visiting the inbred readneck survivalist part of the
state.  Be grateful if you find asphalt and electricity! :^)

Seriously, I don\'t know if there are any decent game stores in
Medford, but it\'s grown quite a bit in the last decade or so,
so there\'s a fair chance you\'ll find something.

There are a few mediocre stores in the Eugene/Sprinfield area,
and in the Corvallis/Albany area.  However, to get the best in the
state, you have to visit Bridgetown Hobbies and Games in Portland.
That\'d be about a 4-5 hour drive from Medford. :^(

A *fair* number? Like, scads of them! How many are there? A long time to
load indeed! Perhaps you could divide them up on a couple pages? Maybe
three? Even catagorize them, like GGs, Rockballs, Habitables, etc? My
browser got through most of the page (I believe) but then, either due to a
hiccup on mail retrieval, or some such thing, stopped loading. I may have
gotton them all, but there was a large blank stretch at the bottom. They are
wonderful planets though. I\'ll be back to check after thumbing and counting
the ones I got.

well, not medford/gpo area, but if you get to corvallis, there is a game
store which (at least 2 years ago) had a huge number of older traveller
items. After I checked out, I asked if he\'d heard of the demise of GDW...
he hadn\'t! then he went and started RAISING GDW prices...

DOH!  You were practically a next-door neighbor to me and I never knew it!!!
(for 34 years I lived in Vancouver, Wa..was born in Portland, Ore.)

When I can get back there we\'ll have to hook-up man.  I really enjoy your

I been there, used to hang out there down on Ankeny and talked to Stephanie
all the time.  (she is the high-priestess of the church of Elvis).  did you
know she used to be a lawyer?  She gave all that up to open that church.
BTW, does she still do her show, "Where\'s the Art?"

You\'re both missing the important sites in that part of town.  If you make
it into Portland you HAVE to go to Powells Books, both the Main Store, and
the Technical Bookstore are near there.  Powells occasionally gets Traveller
stuff in, and I\'ve seen GURPS:Traveller at the Powells near Washington Square
in Tigard.

The Sci-Fi section of the main store has more books than a lot of
Bookstores!  They carry new and used books, so you can find really old stuff
you can\'t find elsewhere.

Hmm, maybe my connection is slow this time around, took closer to 1 1/2
mins, but well worth it. I just dropped them over on my computer and will be
counting to make sure I got them all, then ordering them into types (maybe).

For a real-life example, a Leading Hand (about an E-4 in US parlance) in
the Royal Navy earns about 16-18000 UKP - about the same as a Graduate
Engineer in the civilian sector. A typical person in a manual trade with
no higher or further education will be lucky to match the enlisted man.

Depends on the ship. Note that most people in the RN Submarine Service
volunteered for the extra pay a submariner earns over a skimmer.

I\'ve spent some time on board as a civilian, and am firmly of the
opinion that it suits people of a certain frame of mind.

Hmmm, not sure.  The cat moved into their Technical bookstore, but I don\'t
remember the last time I saw it.  Thing is they could have several in there
and you might not notice it.  The main store is so big, and crowded anymore
any cats would probably be hiding during the day where customers can\'t go.

Cats and bookstores go good together, "Campaign Headquarters" in Norfolk, VA
had 3 the last time I was there.

Last time I was in Edmonton, a chain of book stores (Wee Book Inn) had a cat
in each of the 5 stores. There best store was on White Ave. (2 floors with
the second floor having some really old pulp sci-fi and the biggist cat I
have ever seen)

OK, I count eighty-six (86), did I get them all? Neptune-boring, he he, you
name your files like I do. Would you mind if I used \'em to spice up systems
in my Farcast Sector? I was planning on having sys-data with orbital
diagrams, trade codes, UWP\'s, etc., and these would some real nice texture,
if you\'ll pardon the pun.

Indeed, Powell\'s is always worth the trip. In fact, I
bought my copy of MT there back in about 1989, just
browsing through the store.

And their children\'s section is amazing, and cooking,
travel, and everything else. The rare books room is kinda
fun, too. Any traveler (traveller?) coming through Portland
should drop in for a look-see.

Powells is also on-line at:
http://www.powells.com/

(The picture on that site is just one row, and there\'s
gotta be 50 such rows in the place.)

Someone else mentioned Bridgetown hobbies. It\'s now one of

Isn\'t INI published by Microsoft? The same Microsoft that releases changes
to the operating system with new versions of its applications? The same
Microsoft who\'s VP once stated "We set teh standards, and we can change the
standards. That\'s our competitive advantage." (Or very similar words.)?

5 Wee Book Inns? Downtown, Stony Plain Road West, Whyte Avenue... where are
(were?) the other two? 

(Trivia note: all the WBI cats are named after old Montreal Canadiens 
hockey players. The large cat at the Whyte Ave store was called "Boom Boom";
I\'m not sure she\'s still alive as she was darn near 20 years old last time
I saw her. Downtown\'s cat "J.C." can often be found on top of the cash
register...)

I\'m near DC, and I don\'t know of a good store that is really all that
close.  Game Parlour out in Chantilly is good for some things, most notably
thy have a huge (and clean) open gaming area, and support miniatures.  But
their stock often seems spotty to me.  And they require a significant drive
(probably 40 minutes from DC).

Dream Wizards is up in Rockville, which is just accessible by Metro. 
They\'re a lot smaller though, and I\'m increasingly disappointed with their
service.  (I don\'t like being told that game company is lying about having
released product, just because the store can\'t find it.)

There\'s also a very small Compleat Strategist in McClean, but their RPG
support is pretty slim.

Wish I could (I\'m a veteran of Archons 5 and 6), but I\'ve already made
my St. Louis road trip for this month (my sister\'s wedding).  C\'est la
vie....

May I suggest that, in the future, folks on the TML post any cons they
intend to attend?  This will help in organizing K\'kree barbecues and the
like....

Regarding Washington DC, yes indeedy!

Game Parlor - Chantilly, in Sully Plaza, open 10 - 10 7 days a week,  call
at 703-804-3114.  If I\'ve garbled that, it\'s 814, not 804 (I never call; I
visit!)
Wide selection of just about everything!

Little Wars - Fairfax County on Lee Highway.  Their website\'s at:

http://members.wbs.net/homepages/l/i/t/littlewars.html
and has their phone number, hours, etc. - smaller selection, but some nice
& esoteric stuff...

Eagle and Empire - Mt. Vernon (south of the district) call at 703-360-5363

Complete Strategist - Falls Church - sorta hoary; some gems buried amongst
the "stuff"; call them at 703-527-2477 (I think; Directory ass\'t can help
if that\'s wrong.  They\'re on Rt 7...)

There\'s another place - or was - in Clarendon/North Arlington that deals
mainly in fantasy & RPGs but their name escapes me...

I hope this helps!

Back in the good old days of Traveller, I had a game group newsletter that
had movie reviews from various players, reviews on music, up-coming BBQ\'s,
etc.  But the bulk was a newspaper-like presentation with the headline
always being something about what the PC\'s were currently doing with rumours
and false leads found in other articles.  All this was constructed on the
old Commodore C64, firstly using GEOS, then some newsletter program (which
name has slipped my mind and was a royal pain in the bottom to use, but
looked more "professional" heheheh... yeah, sure...) and all printed on a
Star 21-pin(?) dotmatrix printer.  It had that lovely effect of annoying
PC\'s when they did something absolutely right... and their names were
misspelt in the "paper!"  I also included text-based advertisements for
air/rafts and the like with special non-book prices that PC\'s sometimes took
advantage of.

Nowadays, we play a long-running AD&D game campaign (originating from the
same gaming period, though now the current campaign is only some 12-odd
years in the running), but I still run a PC-constructed (using PageMaker)
and bubble jet printed gaming group newsletter that looks 200% on the old
one, and comes  complete with the usual previous game reminders, news that
the PC\'s hear about, rumours and false leads and the usual "reviews"
including the old staples of movies and music, but also computer games.
Plus stuff about what\'s happening in the actual gamer\'s lives, BBQ
announcements, scanned images and pics downloaded from the net.

These props contained from 3-5 double-sided pages, produced mainly by myself
with volunteer in-put from the gamers.  I have always had between 6 and 12
players (average is the current 8 core players).  The old C64 days were a
pain with me producing and printing every page on the old Star, but now I am
lucky enough that one of my players has access to a photocopier at his work
place, so I only have to make 1x master copy and he handles the rest (even
the stapling :)

It can be a lot of work for a GM, but I love doing it and get some personal
gaming enjoyment out of it--an extension of my GM\'ing as it were.  For those
who haven\'t done it but would like to, I say give it at least one shot.

As long as the images are not republished anywhere including the web (at

handouts.  I have to make sure of the legality (after all, I\'m USEING the
textures, not re-distributing them) first.

Fair enough. Usually, when a player wants to switch to a more compatible
character, it\'s usually for the simple fact he sees others getting more
action than him. On the other hand, if you\'re looking for ways to curtail
the pirate... well, there are plenty of ways.

Usually, I have the opposite problem. One or two players may take combat
monsters, thinking that they\'re "getting one over" on me and then find
themselves yawning as the majority of players use their characters\' skills
to barter, talk, bribe, connive, and stealth their way through all of the
obstacles.

The funny part is there\'s one player who\'s been playing with me for
something like 6 years now. He knows the drill, and yet he always thinks
he\'s getting over on me by taking a combat monster... and without fail, he
always wants a new character within four or five sessions.

That was Fantasy Forum.  They are sadly defunct now.  The shop moved out to
McClean for a year or two and went out of business about a week ago.

I was thinking over that statement also, thinking of r/l "royals" (nobles in
the Traveller sense) who are head waiters in fancy restaurants because of
their actual financial standing, and the plethora in Russia with the blood
of the Czars in them who clean toilets and wash dishes for a living, and the
females selling themselves into marriage with petty businessmen so the new
husband can have some credibility with a noble name (not always with a
title).

Then, if one wants something more noticeable, try Fergie, the Duchess of
York.  Toe-sucking and bankruptcy (or was it near bankruptcy--being bailed
out by US chat shows??).  I believe the English royal family have
photographers and journos, writers and producers, and other businessmen in
their ranks (the ones you hear about), with some in the wings being those
waiters and cleaners I mentioned above.

It\'s a good way to explain why that noble PC has no ready cash and the rest
of the family don\'t help him -- why that PC is an adventurer.

What a guy!  Been needing to make a trip to visit Jay and Medieval Starship,

Yes, indeed.  Oh, you wanted us to share?  Of course!!  We\'re trying to
accrete enough mass to begin at least fission (read: gather players)
possibly fusion...

Several Houston TMLers who\'ve never met in the flesh are getting together
Saturday for lunch (probably near Johnson Space Center), care to join us?

In case I misunderstood and you\'re looking for FLGS in Houston, Gamesmasters
(both locations) just went Chapter 11, but Nan\'s and Phoenix are still
afloat (although both are reorganizing heavily into other things).  Half
Price occasionally has something (if I don\'t see it first :).

Ye gods, man, why?!  I narrowly escaped from there a few weeks ago just
before Congress returned (only to leave again just in time to miss Floyd)...
and nobody has even noticed that I replaced the president with Bubba.  ;}

obtrav: has anyone else decided that the use of "First Wave" style clone
replacements (to confuse your players) is too good to pass up?

Send me info in private. I may ditch a DR. friend. Who needs the women he is
trying to set me up with. Hell, I live in Conroe and I might try to make it.
You guys are really far south :)

Nans is an old standard, I just wasn\'t sure if they were still in business.
They were my gaming Mecca in the 80\'s. Phoenix was just a baby the last time
I visited them.

As for Half priced, I check on 1960 all the time to no avail. NO gaming
stuff.

I have to go to DC, job forces me too. How often does your boss call and
tell you that you get 3, all expenses paid days, in DC?  Hell, they are even
giving me spending cash, who could refuse :)

Just to make it hard on you Ian. <g> 

As it happens, I have more time for reading and writing posts on the
weekend, being busy with that which pays for my computer during the
week.  <g>

I\'m compiling the posts from the last two days tonight...man there
are a lot of them.

How about I just don\'t put the emails on the web, then anyone that

The Memo Pad is the same on the Palm Pro, the Palm III & the Palm V.
QED is a good palm editor for editing files in Aportis doc format (That is 
to say \'bigger files\').
Let me check my palm page...
I have a link to http://www.visionary2000.com/qed/

It\'s shareware ($23 US to register).  A very nice program.  There are 
several programs that will convert the doc format back to Text that runs on 
your PC.

I use QED to the final clean up of documents I convert to Aportis 
Doc.  These include the Shadowrunner\'s Guide to Boson.  You can find this 
at (plug, plug)

Hmm.  okay, so I\'ll leave T4 and GT and the lead figures home.  And I\'ll try

That\'s probably the best solution.  That way, nobody has an email posted
to the Web without his/her/its consent.

 Dream Wizards is up in Rockville, which is just accessible by Metro. 
 They\'re a lot smaller though, and I\'m increasingly disappointed with their

Tom; I was in DC in \'82, and I remember that there used to be a good game 
store just over the Potomac. It was in the underground shopping mall near the 
Pentagon (Crystal City?) but I don\'t remember the name. I remember buying the 
Task Force Games pocket game editions of Starfire and Starfire II (which I 
still think was the best version...K.I.S.S.)...

There are several. Have a look around http://www.palmgear.com/.

This leads to some very unpleasant conditions on the worlds in a system. The

(or cheating), the other star type Life Zones are too narrow. Okay, this may
be true to life, but Traveller is supposed to be set in a populated galaxy.

Effectively this means that most of the existing world data for Traveller is

    Well, I am one such myself and I know several more.  I\'ll point out
that,
while MOST people want to settle down and have families, there still
remains a sizable minority of those of us with no such interests...and that
this population is more likely than most to be attracted to space service
for some of the same reasons that make us uninterested in "normal"
lives.  Also, I\'ll point out, service on a tramp freighter is likely to
attract a
large proportion of the population who are, in psycho-babble, "poorly
socialized".  My experience with PC\'s would lead me to believe that
that includes the majority of them....<grin> or at least mine and my
players.
        I expect that the family-man-gone-to-space is strictly a corporate
entity with regular routes and schedules.  The typical tramp freighter
crew will be a collection of loners, or not too infrequent couples, with
little interest in raising a family until AFTER they make their "big score".

        Now this is a horse of a different color and I will have to change
my mind on this issue .  IMTU, the reduction of the work-week has led to
one typically of  3 days or so.  Aboard ship, OTOH, I imagine "work" is
both a daily thing and for a longer "day" than the typical groundling. This
would drive the shipboard position\'s salary up several degrees, at least
equaling and, most likely, significantly exceeding that of the equivalent
groundling role.

        I expect that they\'ll be a rara avis indeed.  Tramp freighter crew
(whether partner or employee) is a high-risk role.  Most end up badly,
bankruptcy more likely then death or imprisonment, but that happens too,
but those who hit, tend to hit big.  The people who keep following such a
path into their 30s and beyond are rarely the family type.

        I understand and agree with this.  My point is that, for example, a
5% taxation for the Imperial military is not a 5% burden on the economy.
Somebody has to pay for the garrisons on uninhabited worlds, much
equipment will be purchased off-world, etc.
        OTOH, I don\'t think you\'re saying this, but if you\'re trying to say
that
ANY military unit is a net loss, even if it is 100% manned and equiped

most stereo-typical means of stimulating a depressed economy and

        Jesus, Mary, and Joseph did _I_ ever enlist in the wrong service.
My background is U.S. Army and we don\'t get paid anywhere near this
generously.  Our typical problem is retention as people come in, get the
training and/or experience, and then leave as soon as possible for much
better-paying civilian jobs.  To equal the "entry-level" positions available
to a graduate engineer in the U.S. military you\'d probably have to be
an E-7/E-8 or at least an O-3 on the officer side.

Crystal City is correct; the Underground is an odd place (I once saw it
described as a "Habitrail for Humanity").  Unfortunately, that store must
be gone; I work in CC and have never seen it.  There\'s a comics store, and
there used to be a model and hobby shop, but no game store for at least the
last four or five years.

I have SmartDoc (http://www.tapworks.com) and it works as both a doc reader

>>>>>>>>>>
You need to compare the benefits of the military build-up (defense
contractor jobs, people getting military pay) with the opportunity
costs of the military buildup. Those taxes and resources spent
on the military - not to mention the work and effort of the people
building for the military and actually *in* the military - could have
been developing the civilian infrastructure, creating trade goods,
improving the educational system, etc. These opportunities that
are lost could have improved the general wealth and welfare of the
nation, much more than the improvements the military brings.

Yes, a military build-up gives some people money to spend
(at the expense of those taxed to pay that money), creates
industries (that often have no role or a limited role beyond
creating weapons), and provides technical education to the soldiery. 
All of these things are done with massive inefficiency compared to
the civilian sector, for one simple reason: none of these things 
are the military\'s job. The military is there to blow things up and
shoot people, and hopefully do it so well that no one will dare try to
do the same things to you.

Get enough military to provide for the security of your civilian sector,
plus a bit more in case you estimated wrong. Then let your civilian
sector spend the money and make your country wealthy. That\'s
what civilian sectors are for.

One of my players, who by no coincidence is the one with J-o-T skill, thinks
that the time roll should be negated as well. His logic is that the J-o-T
character would be resourceful enough to come up with the right solution the
first time, so giving the player several task attempts with only one time roll
emulates this.

Your thoughts?

I\'ve been into Traveller since the LBB days (started
when I was eleven) and I am glad (no, estatic!) that
there are still people around who love it as much as
I do! I heard about this mailing list through the
GT homepage, and knew right away I had to sign up. :-)

I\'m looking forward to the release of the Classic
Edition (my stuff is pretty worn), and even
though it won\'t be in LBB format, I figure I\'ll
support the game which has brought me so many hours
of fun.

So, HELLO LIST!!!!

Gamesmasters in Clear Lake was bought by the manager of that store some months
ago and is now operating under a different name.

Same location, though.

Although if you cut and past a larger document from Windows into the Memo
application it will simply be split across as many memos as it takes.  This
can be quite useful depending on what you want to do.  (And in reverse it
is possible to highlight several memos and export them all simultaneously
to a single Word document if you wish by just clicking on the \'W\'.)

I personally wouldn\'t want to [1] but if you\'ve a GoType! keyboard it
becomes a doddle to input huge great wadges of text - \'specially if you\'re
a touch typist.

OB Trav: The two reviews I\'ve just done of the latest BITS Traveller
adventures (_The Khiidkar Incident_ and _Spacedogs_) were both written on
the Palm tucked up in bed or lounging around on the sofa.  Getting out my
old laptop and waiting for it to boot up and messing around with floppies
to get it to my work machine and e-mail is just too much of a pain.


OB Trav II: Characters on a low tech world are using their hand comp for
whatever reason and get small crowds around them wanting to see what it is
and what it can do.  (I get this using the Palm in public and have now
\'sold\' two local organizations on giving them a field trial for workers
just because I was using it where a manager happened to spot me.  Wish I
was on a commission from 3com.)  Of course, too low tech a world and the
players might be in trouble with the local inquisition (or whatever) for
witchcraft!


OB Trav III: on a TL8/9 ish world, there might be queues at local
\'terminals\' where the latest data or news or whatever can be downloaded
into the local inhabitant\'s Palm type devices.  The PCs spot a market for
shipping in wireless technology which will cut out the queues.  The local
telecom company might not want to lose their monopoly....

Just to play devil\'s advocate for a moment ...

There are some infrastructure projects that have  joint  military
and civilian benefits, but which the civilian  economy  would  be
relucant to  spend  on.  These  projects  are  those  with  large
initial spends and either have no clearly  definable  returns  or
have very long delays before pay back.

The single clearest example is *the Internet*, which started  out
as a military network (DARPANET).  It wasn\'t  until  the  initial
infrastructure  was  in  place  that  commercial  money   started
flooding in.

Other examples  include  radar,  the  GPS  system,  many  of  the
technologies used by the aerospace industry ... in  fact  general
tech advancement.  (We\'ve probable had about 30 years  more  tech
progress this century than we would have  had  otherwise  due  to
military spending ... especially from  WW2  and  the  Cold  War.)
Perhaps even computer technology has benefited.

Within any modern society there are large investment flows  which
do not appear on the balance sheet ... but  which  still  have  a
significant positive long-term impact on the overall economy.  It
is the hallmark  of  a  successful  empire  that  the  political,
commercial, and military forces  are  in  step  with  each  other
(whether we are talking  about  the  Roman  Empire,  the  British
Empire, the American \'empire\', or the Third Imperium).

(Additionally, arms *can* also be trade goods.)

Third Planet carries hardly anything.  You can find some odds and ends,
but RPGs are now relegated to the back left of the store.  You can tell
they are not a profit center for the shop.

Nan\'s still has a decent amount of Traveller stuff.  There\'s even a rack
with a few CT items on it.  They\'ve got a lot of T4, but hardly any MT
or TNE.

Whatever the new Gamesmasters shop in Clear Lake is called now (I think
it starts with a "D"), they\'ve got miniscule stuff too.  You won\'t find
a lot there for Traveller.

With it being a dead game at the moment, it hard to find supplements.
When I need stuff, I go on treasure hunts and search a host of gameing
shops and used book stores.

There\'s a used book store in Pasadena you might want to try.  It\'s
called Re-Run Books, at the corner of Shaver and Richy, right across
from the new Wallmart (where the old Pasadena Sears used to be).

Sometimes I go in there, they\'ve got squat.  And sometimes I\'m
surprised.  It might be worth a trip.

If you have time to go to only one shop, though, I\'d say hit Nan\'s.  The
prices are high, but the product is usually there.

This is, basically, a powered version of the TL 8 combat
armor (p.B212). It could also be considered an early version
of battle dress. The light battlesuit is intended for use by
scouts and elite troops. Most troopers wearing the suit carry
a LAG (or similar heavy weapon) since ST is no longer a
problem.

Quick-Fix TL 9 version: bump armor to DR 80 and stealth/IR to
TL 9 standards. Battery life jumps to 17.84 hours. There is
no increase in cost or weight.

(With a heavy frame, the battlesuit could carry up to DR 230
armor, but cost would be around $130,000 and Move would drop
to 4.5, making it a slow, expensive target).

It\'s hard for the universe to do it right, why should we have it any easier?

Cheating?  I don\'t see anything in _First In_ that says you can\'t play with
the numbers to get a world in the habitable zone.. just adjust the inner
orbit and Bode factors until you get an orbit where you want it.

Type A stars won\'t be around long enough to develop life-bearing planets.
Even the high range F\'s are chancy.

In fifteen years of meddling with the printed data, I have never had the
gaming cops raid my house and arrest me for changing things.

The GDW data was based on a random generation that was *badly* flawed.  So
just change the stellar type to something you like better!  Case in point:
A world is listed as being  A-987997-C, and the data string says it\'s
orbiting a M9vi.  Bollocks!  Change it to something nice, like a G0v.

You can also meddle the other way, to explain those seemingly nice planets
with no population. The world is just inside or outside the habitable zone,
making it a hellhole; lots of O2, but humans find it intolerable
(_Icerigger_ anyone?)

SJG had nothing to do with the old stellar types.  If you want to pass out
blame, it was GDW that first printed those out (in _The Spinward Marches
Campaign_, IIRC.)

Yes, SJG wants you to buy their books, but AFAICR, stellar types aren\'t
even mention in _Behind The Claw_.

Hm...not really.  The real problem is that most stars are class M dwarves and
planets within their life zones are usually tidelocked.

Hm?  The fact that you can\'t generate certain worlds with First In doesn\'t prevent you from using them (there are a significant number of physically impossible worlds in the Marches).  Just assume considerable terraforming, either by the early imperium or by the Ancients.

Reality check here: a light machine gun won\'t fit in the arm of a battlesuit,
due to length (you\'d need a short or very short barrel).  In addition, since
you don\'t have the weapon \'concealed\', it has a protruding barrel, which will
be annoying.

HUD isn\'t technically a sensor.  List the rating of the thermograph.  Note that this means that you have a faceplate and will suffer the vision penalties for the size of the faceplate.  Consider adding a radar/laser detector or locator.

The standard IFF system is considerably overweight for battlesuit use, as it has considerable range.

If you\'re using standard Vehicles power cells, there\'s no point to a ceramic power plant.  In any case, having two separate 12 hour power systems isn\'t worth it.

Stealth is a low priority at TL 8, active sensors aren\'t that common in infantry-level combat.

Yet more reason for not bothering with 24 hours total endurance.  Legged vehicles make breakdown checks every 6 hours, based on HT +3(legs)-2(legs at TL 8) = 11-.

Random point: where\'s the NBC kit?  That\'s half the point of a \'battlesuit\'.

Suliikarin Industries of Shaar (Core 1821) introduced their lifeboat
design for Imperial spacecraft to representatives of the Imperial Safety
Bureau and the Imperial Shipbuilders Association. Suliikarin is better
known as suppliers of Imperial flight suits and equipment for
vac-suit recreationalists. Their lifeboat, called the Chrysalis,
is designed to provide maximum survivability in all emergency situations
at the lowest cost.

 1 Ship\'s locker (4 m3)

Crew: none

The Chrysalis is not a spacecraft; it has no long-range sensors or pilot
workstation. Its only maneuver drive is a collection of solid fuel thrust
packs providing 1 G of thrust for a mere 8 seconds. It is a special-purpose
aerospace escape vehicle, designed to remove people from a danger area
as quickly and efficiently as possible at the lowest cost in any
environment outside a combat zone.

The pod can be launced from a hangar or launch bay, or a custom-built
jettison bay which can be installed into any ship for 0.0126 MCr.
The jettison bay takes 3 displacement tons from the host vessel.

The interior contains a single custom emergency low berth with belted seats
for 4 people, 4 m3 of stowage space, a single control panel with
radio and laser communication, and a simulated display of the ship position.
The capsule has life support for 12 hours for 4 people.

The Chrysalis requires no training to use. Indeed, it has no way of being
piloted from the inside. It can be controlled by a laser link from the outside,
but its usual mode of operation is to leave the scene of the emergency under
control of its navigation computer, turn on its radio beacon, and wait for
rescue.
It is covered in retroreflective paint and has a high EMS cross-section,
which makes it easy to detect. The iris valve matches standard Imperial airlock
hatches, so rescue can be done even by commercial spacecraft.

The navigation computer must have sensor data and launch commands sent to it
from outside, though it does come pre-programmed with a simple launch
sequence triggered by a switch inside the capsule.
Suliikarin provides standard starship software which constantly updates
the Chrysalis with sensor data, escape flight paths, and current emergency
procedures. When triggered, the Chrysalis follows its last programmed orders.

These orders can be as complex as desired and can be customized by individual
captains, though it must be remembered the Chrysalis has no long-range sensors
and can only navigate based on its last uploaded data.
The on-board computer and inertial navigation system can go into any orbit
or trajectory its 2 G contra-grav system is capable of, or safely land on
any planet with up to a surface gravity of 2 Gs. The ship will float if it
lands
in water. The Chrysalis does not have enough power for interplanetary travel.

Typical operation is for the Chrysalis to remain locked until an Abandon Ship
order is given or contact is lost with the ship computer. At this point the
iris valve opens and an audio warning explains the situation and urges
passengers
inside. The pod is launched from inside or, if so programmed,
it can give an audible countdown and launch itself automatically. Once launched
the pod moves to a safe distance from the host ship and begins broadcasting a
distress signal. Or, if so programmmed from the host ship, it can land on a
planet the ship was orbiting. If not rescued after 12 hours the low berths are
automatically activated and the ship goes into a special low-power mode,
running only the berth and a distress beacon. Planetary sensor arrays can
detect
the beacon at several parsecs and the on-board fuel can maintain this low-power
mode for over 100 years. This will give ample time for a rescue to be sent
even to a ship which misjumps catastophically.

Perhaps they didn\'t fit?  With only "basic" G:T the stellar class doesn\'t
make any difference?  Loren decided to remove the bad stellar classes from
the canon?  The authors decided not to include stellar class for some reason?

The short of it is that you are free as a bird to change the stellar
classes.  Actual hard info on the nature of SM worlds if fairly scare..

Regina is the moon of a Gas Giant, as is Zyra/Trin\'s Veil
Victoria/Lanth has a moon with a breathable atmosphere
Trin/Trin\'s Veil has a ring system
Sinothy Belt/Regina has large chunks of antimatter in it.

HUD didn\'t seem to fet any other category very well. The thermograph is the 
basic version (1 mile?). Why a radar detector if (as you point out below) 
stealth isn\'t appropriate? Laser detector was an oversight.

Unfortunately, there wasn\'t a smaller version, and I wanted to keep as

I tinkered with this for awhile (originally it was just battery powered), 
but I prefered the idea of a regular powerplant with a battery backup for 
situations where the ceramic wouldn\'t funtion (underwater, for example).

Urk. One NBC kit, in the body (this is listed under "Battlesuit System:"

Harummph. Well, OK, player handouts only then, I was thinking smaller
graphics on the webpage anyway. Hmm. Player handouts, that /is/ an idea. If
the graphics on the webpage were close to the handout, but not the same, it
might give a campaign a feel of depth. I mean, how many /different/ pictures
of our own planet have we all seen? And a large degree of variance in
resolution, tint, contrast, etc. Do you think it would be OK to use icon

I thought I was excessive in my not-so-AD&D campaign! A whole paper with ads
and all, your players must love you. Or hate you, depending on how often you
mispell their names. ;) I agree that the work is worth it, I got a very good
response from my players for the work I put into maps, bulletins, scrolls,
written messages they intercepted, etc. Or maybe it wasn\'t a good idea, it
was hard as hell to "retire" the campaign. nearly four years since it ended,
and one of the players was trying to convince me to start it up again this
week. I guess they liked it. He didn\'t even sound like he had any doubts,
saying "When the Aemir Campaign starts up again..." and going into how to
bring in new characters and all. I just smiled and nodded alot. I may have
to start it up again though, I do miss it.

My thoughts are that you are correct, and the player is
not. JoT in this case only precludes the need for a
Determination roll. At least, that\'s how I play it.

I also feel strongly that the character still needs to make
the time roll. JoT allows the retry because the character
is resourceful enough to conceive of a /different/ way to
accomplish the task after the first attempt fails. Your
player\'s interpretation makes the skill very powerful, and
(IMHO) does not emulate what the skill is supposed to
represent. In my RL experience, resourcefulness of this
kind is not "getting it right the first time," but, rather,
"able to keep thinking of different ways to try it, and not
stopping just because your first thought wasn\'t the
answer."

I also use JoT as a +DM on the task for learning skills at
level 1 or 2, as it implies a general knowledge that makes
skills at their lower levels more accessible. After level
2, though, it no longer applies -- the knowledge in that
specific skill has become too specialized.

Thank you. He has conceded the point, which (naturally) means that his character
won\'t encounter a fatal accident during this weekend\'s session. Oooops, did I
say that out loud?

I also agree with your interpretation of the rules.  Just because a PC is
resourceful, doesn\'t mena they can make time stop while they try things.
Even McQuiver needed time to do this little stunts.  I think the main thing
here is \'resourceful\' doesn\'t equal \'god-like\'..:)

I favor the \'cheat-mode\' approach. Would it be possible to employ a toggle 
that will allow the end user to modify variables until he or she gets 
something agreeable? Maybe a toggle to force shirt-sleeve environment 
worlds into the right temperature range.

Point of information. _Behind the Claw_ didn\'t include stellar data, and 
neither has any source SJG printed for GT to date. OTOH using earlier data 
published data fit into what BTC says, is problematic as others have said. 
My favorite solution is the stoke up the fusion flames of the star by 
adjusting fractions of stellar class until the planet becomes warm (or 
cool) enough to fit what I need for plot purposes.

Ah...found the NBC.  To be honest, this is very similar to a design I had, though I preferred to use an external weapon.  My design is different in a couple of ways and is slightly lower tech, but...

Btw, also attached is a somewhat heavier suit (about 1.5x the weight and 3x the cost).  I originally wrote it for an interminable battlesuit debate on GURPSnet, but consider whether it\'s worth 2 lighter suits (suit costs are more than 2x, but once you toss in reduced transport and training requirements it ceases to be that expensive).

The PICA/7 (Personal Infantry Combat Armor) was developed on contract
to provide a low-maintenance light armor frame for use in a general
infantry role; it is intended that PICA troops be used in much the same
deployments as conventional infantry, though typical unit size is 
somewhat smaller.  A major factor encouraging its development was the
rapid advances in personal thermographs and night-vision gear, plus
the need for NBC capabilities in many areas, which combined load
frequently exceeds reasonable infantry encumbrance; the addition of
sufficient armor to withstand small-arms fire was a secondary feature.
The original design constraints called for a price of under fifty
thousand dollars, and a loaded weight of under five hundred pounds
(excluding external supplies); it is generally considered startling how
close to design specifications the final result actually comes.

Comments: this design comes with three hardpoints; however, these are not
intended for bombs or missiles -- they are mounting brackets for a
battlesuit rifle (on the arm) and for a standard rigid cargo pack.
Note that the targeting computer is only usable with a weapon which
is at least attached by cable, and preferably bolted on (the HUDWAC also
reduces SS by 2).

Weapons: the MCR-5 is standard; it is a 12mm caseless carbine with a
detachable stock and a set of mounting bolts; Rcl is -2 with the rifle
stock, -3 with no stock, nil if mounted; reduce Acc by 3 if no stock.  It
includes an integral LLTV sight (*5 magnification) and a laser sight; the
stock weighs 2 lb, a 50 round magazine of APS weighs 5.7 lb and costs $54.

This suit has intrinsic weaponry, and thus qualifies as a battlesuit
instead of a powered armor.  The difference isn\'t really terribly 
important for most purposes; it is a relatively minor conversion to 
rebuild the right arm and remove the weaponry -- this saves 22 lb,
and frees up 0.225 cf in the space, as excess 20mm ammo is no longer
stored there.

Odd features: (a) laser rangefinder is only 1 mile range; if you don\'t like
this idea, just delete it.  (b) a standard IFF has the range of a long-range
radio; this IFF only has the range (and weight) of a medium-range radio.
Given that a computer with comm software should be able to act as an IFF
anyway, I hardly think this is a big abuse.

What are the implications of carrying a diesel generator around on one\'s back?  I\'ve never seen a game that handled the detection of sounds or smells well, but it seems to me that this could be noisy and smelly.  I suppose that\'s part of what the battery is for.

Another question, this thing weighs 600lbs, runs at 13mph, and only uses .6kW?  Maybe I\'ve got my units confused, but I think if I turned all the lights in my apartment on I could use .6kW.  Does the suspension really use this little power, or are lightbulbs not the low-energy devices I imagine them to be?

The 5.5mm MG has had it\'s barrel shortened from long to medium, so it isn\'t 
quite reality breaking (also consider that the suit\'s arms are roughly 3x 
the volume of a human, so it wouldn\'t be incorrect to assume the arms are

TL8 light battlesuit, V2.0

This is, basically, a powered version of the TL 8 combat
armor (p.B212). It could also be considered an early version
of battle dress. The light battlesuit is intended for use by
scouts and elite troops. Most troopers wearing the suit carry
a LAG (or similar heavy weapon) since ST is no longer a
problem.

Quick-Fix TL 9 version: bump armor to DR 75 and stealth/IR to
TL 9 standards. Battery life jumps to 14.87 hours. There is
no increase in cost or weight.

(With a heavy frame, the battlesuit could carry up to DR 230
armor, but cost would be around $130,000 and Move would drop
to 4.5, making it a slow, expensive target).

     Subassemblies: two manipulator arms, two legs, limited
rotation turret (head)
     Populsion: 0.6 kW drivetrain in legs with improves
suspension

     Instruments and Electronics: medium range scrambled
radio in turret, IFF in left arm, military GPS, thermograph
(1 mile), HUDWAC and light intensification in turret,
radar/laser detector in body, small computer

     Controls: Battlesuit System: form-fitting, max. pilot
weight 170 lbs, min. pilot weight 136 lbs, quick access
     Occupancy: Short, Environmental Systems: NBC kit
     Power: 1.1 kW turbo ceramic in body, uses 0.033 gph

This isn\'t a new idea, and it\'s one I very much support.  In many
important ways, the Renaissance was kick-started by a happy marriage of
three events:  The discovery of the New World, the invention of the
printing press, and the reintroduction into Europe of numerous \'lost\'
classical Greek and Roman works (which had been preserved in Islamic Spain
and elsewhere).  Suddenly there were new horizons to explore (and
somewhere to send your crazy types to die or earn riches for you and them
at a safe distance), a new way to share information on a scale never
previously possible, *and* a whole lot of pre-packaged information to get
the ball rolling.

In another sense, the Renaissance was entirely due to the Black Plague of
the 14th century, but we can examine that separately. :)

It\'s a neat picture, but I\'m not sure I buy it.  The speed and density of
communication on any planet should continue up to the point of an
\'infosphere\' a la Dan Simmons, in which anything anyone cares to
contribute is instantly available to everyone, with helpful semi-AIs to
make searches actually useful.  Yes, collaboration with researchers in the
next subsector is going to be excruciatingly slow, but who cares if you\'re
on a high-pop, high-tech world?  There are billions of potential
collaborators scant milliseconds away.

The trouble is that in game terms this very rapidly warps off into
"indistinguishable from magic" territory.  That\'s why Traveller has always
artifically (in my view) damped down the rate of tech change (*especially*
where computing/communication/info-processing are concerned), and turned
up the tech disparity knob as well.  It makes for a better (more
comprehensible) society for gaming.  This, like the momentum/energy
bookkeeping headaches of reactionless drives, is just One of Those
Handwaves.

Good idea. The BITS site maintains a list of cons in the UK; perhaps HIWG
could do something for the US?

If people tell me about a con in the UK they\'re planning to go to I\'ll post
the info.

Longhand - how quaint!

Have a look at the GoType! Keyboard at http://www.landware.com/ . This

The 5.5mm MG is really just a backup. I assume any trooper is going to carry 
a hand weapon (20mm LAG or 12.7mm sniping rifle seems about right).

It is scary how similar the two designs are. Maybe all very light TL 8 
battlesuits are going to look almost identical?

Considering the lighter suit would be lucky to damage the heavy one, while 
the 20mm on the heavy suit is a match for the light one\'s armor, I\'d say its 
more than worth two of the lighter suits (of course, against non-suited 
infantry, the light suit is probably more cost-effective).

Heh.  Lightbulbs are not particularly low energy devices, try attaching a generator to an exercise bike and running a light.  A horse weighs 1200 lb and runs at 20+ mph and only generates one horsepower (.746 kW).

I compiled a list of nearly 75 listees well over two years ago.  That time
it was Dave Nelson that got the ball rolling.  Not only does it contain the
names of TMLers at the time, but detailed personal data as well (submitted
voluntarily by each person).  It can be found at the following URL:

http://members.home.net/jlindsay/citizens.html

I haven\'t contributed much to this mailing list in the last year and
perhaps it is time for this compiled list (113 KB) to be stored elsewhere.
It has been nearly a year since I concentrated my website on my love of
older VW Beetles instead.  Does anyone feel interested in continuing to
host this page, and perhaps expand it?  It really belongs on a page that
seems more Traveller visitors than mine ever did in the past.

And yes, I\'m still around.  Just reading through 6,500+ TML messages in my
email box right now :)

Yeah, that\'s essentially how it works IMTU... but rather I prefer the

Arrghh, no! JoT is about Resoucefulness, not Munchinism! If you let him get
away with that, then he\'s a monster! Think about the ramifications,
especially in combat... JoT 4... hmmm roll 4 times and take the best to
hit...nonono...

If you want to add more utility
	To Get a Temporary Level 0 in another skill
	Difficult, Int, Jack, instant, fateful, safe.
	Success results in temporarilty having the level 0 skill desired,
and being elligible to obtain an at towards that level upon success at the
use of that skill. Skills recieved this way go away within an hour of not
using them, or when redered unconscious.

This comes up from time to time.  Make sure you\'re following the procedure
in Step 7 closely, especially the computation of the base orbital radius.  For
some reason that seems to trip people up so that they can\'t get planets in the
life zone for most stars.  The procedure as written should give every main-
sequence star a good chance of having one planet in the life zone -- including
M-class ones.  Those planets are almost certainly tide-locked, of course,
but that\'s another problem.

I can assure you that I don\'t participate in any Nefarious Plot To Force
Everyone To Buy SJG Product.

The fact of the matter is that the random-generation procedures GDW once
used were seriously broken.  I can well understand why the authors of
_Behind the Claw_ didn\'t make any attempt to match (or even report) the
"canonical" stellar types for the Marches.  I\'m working on the Solomani Rim
data even as we speak, and it\'s *astonishing* how many garden worlds are
supposedly orbiting these tiny little M-class stars.

In any case, you have my authorial permission to cheat like a card sharp
when it comes to the world-design sequences in First In.  If you follow them
closely from start to finish, what you get will be fairly realistic, but it 
won\'t
give you results that feel like Classical Traveller.  But once you\'ve run 
through
the sequence a couple of times, you should start having a feeling for where
you can fudge things to match the canonical data, and where you can safely
drop the canonical data entirely for your own purposes.  Think of the book
as a worldbuilding manual, and feel free to improvise.

The fault lies not in our stars, but in ourselves...
(sorry, couldn\'t resist)

I\'m with Doug Berry on this:  the problem isn\'t with the First In rules,
it\'s with the BADLY broken star data they inherited from GDW.  Just because
M-class stars are the most common in the Galaxy does not mean they\'re the
most common sun for a habitable world; pretty much the opposite, in fact.
If you want a habitable world, go for something in an F, G, or K, or put it
around a warm gas giant.

Of course, for a lot of published mainworlds the point is moot, as you have
billions of people living on tiny rockballs (an artifact of ANOTHER badly
broken set of rules, namely CT Book 3, where population is random and
totally decoupled from habitability...).  For these systems, the star type
doesn\'t really matter.

Would it make more sense to make it a uncertain task? Since it\'s JoT, they
"think" they know their doing it right... but they wouldn\'t be sure until
they tried. That\'s when they\'d learn if they were right... just a thought.

And as a twenty year Navy veteran so have I. And I would imagine that
members of the IN and IISS would also be underpaid.  IRL merchant seamen,
even those on convenience flag ships, make much more than they could working
ashore. Your typical merchant mariner makes significantly more than a
military sailor. Those third world sailors on ships flagged in Liberia and
Panama make an even higher multiple of pay than their shore based
counterparts, especially for non-technical skill labor like cooking or food
serving.

You just can\'t overlook the hardship of transient living.  The lack of
ability to accumulate stuff, raise a family, etc.  Don\'t forget that even
when you lived for months in a tent somewhere you had a house, or an
apartment or a barracks room that, at least in the late twentieth century,
was very near the level of an apartment. Even today most military sailors
who are not married still live in bunk rooms.  A merchant marine type gets
his own room, usually, but only officers get to bring their wives along.

A space crewman from a world like Regina, which is RI, will be giving up a
lot to work aboard ship.  While a tramp won\'t be able to pay much, only the
wingnuts are going for those jobs anyway. You know PC\'s. Normal people will
take that job with Tukera hoping to make enough to settle down after a
career with a nice nestegg. They\'ll want extra money to make all that time
away from home worthwhile.

Hello! It may not be LBB, but I think it is going to be BBB (Big Black
Books). Speaking of CT, my page is getting polished up, and looks quite CT
now. I finally did go for a white background and black text on the content,
but figured out a cool set of tables to put a red border and lots of black
in there too. Check it out!

 The only thing we really know is that the area bounded by the Black Curtain 
is so saturated with Vampire Ship activity that no current data exists 
because nobody who ventures in ever returns. It is ...............

minor TNE spoiler below (minor because most people playing in the TNE-RCES 
setting will have learned this one already)




.............. one terminus of a long "Vampire Highway" linking the Curtain 
with (aparently) the planet Cymbeline in the Solomani Rim; Vampire activity 
is much higher on this path than anywhere else in the former Third Imperium.

I cannot remember if it was canon but I think the black curtain is the
approximate location of a huge virus empire, the black curtain description
was like a black hole, nothing that passed through it ever came back.

As an aside can you imagine what virus would evolve into if it got into the
computer banks at Reference, think about it almost the entire knowledge base
of the 3I in handy networkable computers.

We have the same problem with retention in the RAAF (Royal Australian Air

Though not a great film the trader in Alien Resurrection seemed to me to be
typical of the low end free trader, perhaps more so as at the start of the
film it identifies the ship "Betty" as unregistered.

Also in the old CT adventure Annic Nova this oddball vessel was carrying a
family, though they all perished prior to the start of the adventure.

I won\'t spoil the story, but I will say that (as usual) Falkenberg and

The Falkenberg stories are a great source.

No, no, no.

"The Square Mile" is the name of a pub crawl in Christchurch, New Zealand
that consists of drinking one pint (or one 7oz glass for the wusses) in each
alcohol selling establishment within a square mile of the centre of the city
in a single afternoon/evening.

It used to be OK back when there were only fourteen-odd pubs, but with the
introduction of micro-breweries and a whole damn street full of licensed
cafes, the Square Mile is now goddam suicidal

It\'s proprietary because the format was designed and is owned by Microsoft.
The OS/2 format is actually slightly different and was also written by
Microsoft but owned by IBM.

Also, it\'s obsolete and no longer directly supported by Microsoft, except
for backward compatibility, and will probably be dropped entirely from
future versions of Microsoft operating sytems

However, being simple, it only allows a single level hierarchy, and does not
handle aggregation or inheritance at all. This is why Microsoft dropped it
in favour of the registry.

You can not model the data for anything with a multi-level hierarchy, such
as a star system, using the ini format without forcing the reader of the
data to know the _specific_ format of the file, rather than the generic ini
format.

XML allows an XML tool to read _any_ data format, because the format itself
can be described.

I just get a little annoyed about the fact that Traveller is now onto its
sixth (including 2300) version. T4 was lucky to last a year. AD&D is only
about to release its third version. I just want someone to create a stable
Traveller version and for that to be around for several years. It isn\'t a
problem with the core rules. What the players need is are decent
sourcebooks. There was absolutely nothing wrong with CT rules and MT rules
were superb. Call me cynical, but the versions since then just seem to me to
be publishers cashing in on the success of Traveller.

I don\'t have all the figures any more, but here are some from the
mid \'90s to give you a flavour ...

- - Forex (foreign exchange) Market:  (Currency swapping.)   Global
  turnover USD 1400 billion  *per day*.  5%  trade  related,  95%
  speculation.  London transacts 35%.

- - Government Bond Market (UK government  bonds  called  "Gilts"):
  London worth GBP 214.5 billion ... which makes it  6th  largest
  in world, or 4% of total.  US was  37%  but  that\'s  difference
  between US and Euro markets - Americans like  bonds,  Europeans
  like equity.

- - "Eurobond" Market (bad  name,  is  actually  for  international
  bonds): worth USD 402 billion.  London has about half, I think.

- - SEAQ (similar to NASDAQ): Turnover is GBP 650 billion domestic,
  GBP 7906 billion international.

- - LIFFE (London International Financial Futures Exchange): ?

- - Commodities Markets: ?

London also has international insurance  business  ...  including
Lloyds of London.  Lloyds is an insurer of last resort,  that  is
when a major disaster occurs that would wipe out  a  high  street
insurance company, Lloyds steps in and covers the short fall (for
a percentage of the premiums, of course).

In total the City generates approx 10% of the UK\'s GDP.  Not  bad
for a square mile.



ObTrav:  What would the Regina markets be like ...

- - Forex: Regina has a global currency  so  the  only  real  trade
  would be between that and Crimps.  So I suspect the  market  to
  be relatively tiny.  Say 60% trade related and 40% speculation.
  Anyone know Regina\'s import/export volumes?

- - Bond markets: A recent TML thread discussed Imperial  taxation,
  but what  about  public  borrowing?  Does  the  Imperium  issue
  bonds/T-Bills?  How about  sector  and  subsector  governments?
  Planetary governments may do (depending on government type)  so
  I  suspect  the  Regina   government   does.   Local   economic
  fluctuations would average out over the Imperium  as  a  whole,
  but  locally  could  cause  temporary  short  falls  in  public
  spending.

  There would definately be corporate  bonds.  (Example:  General
  Shipyards needs to retool its factory to make L-Hyd drop  tanks
  ... it would be easier to borrow  funding  for  that  from  the
  local market than send to head office for a money transfer.)

- - Stock Market: Sure.  Canon (a pre 5FW TAS story) says that even
  megacorporations are traded on the Regina Exchange.  This could
  only be achieved if megacorporations exist as  a  hierarchy  of
  companies, each one registered to one  of  the  many  exchanges
  across the Imperium.  (Example: General Shipyards (Regina)  Ltd
  is a subsidiary of General Shipyards (Spinward Marches) Holding
  Corporation, and those shares in public hands are on the Regina
  Stock Exchange.  Thus, as far as shares are concerned,  General
  Shipyards (Regina)  Ltd  is  a  different  company  to  General

From what I recall, "The Black Curtain" was were most Vampire ships/fleets
hung out in a programmed desire to get Lucan (spreading out from Capital)
with a major Vampire Highway to Cymberline to pay homage to there ancestors
(Cymberline being the Mecca of the Virus).
I\'ve dropped Virus from my game(did not like it), so I\'m really not to sure.

I\'m curious about how other people play this rule. I interpret "free retry"
to
mean that the player doesn\'t have to succeed at the determination task to
get
the retry. However, the retry is still subject to the 3D time roll of the
original task.<

That\'s the way I read it. And if he fails again, JOT-2 would allow him a
second retry without a Determination task. And so on.

that the time roll should be negated as well. His logic is that the J-o-T
character would be resourceful enough to come up with the right solution the
first time, so giving the player several task attempts with only one time
roll
emulates this.<

I wouldn\'t allow this IMTU. "Resourceful" is being able to think about other
ways of doing the task. Normally you\'d try one approach, see that it failed,
and either [a] give up, or [b] use your resourcefulness to think of another
way, and then try that. Of course, he could say "I\'m thinking about all the
possible ways to do this, and picking the best," but that takes time too.

I still don\'t understand why the SJG people change the name of 
SHIONTY to SHINOTY, but they have done so coherently in all 
materials. ;-)

Yes, Yaskoydray is to blame. Apparently, Marc Miller himself stated 
that Eskaylot, the original Droyne world, was hidden in a pocket 
universe in ShiONty system. Maybe the name got changed in GT to 
change the framework... ;->

This is a fairly common pre-grav transport, useful
especially on worlds with a high hydrographic percentage. It
can carry nearly 10 tons of fully enclosed cargo, which is
useful for most normal purposes. It has one large bow ramp
and two smaller ramps port and starboard. As a people mover,
it can carry 32 normal or 48 cramped passengers (though no
environmental control is provided normally).

It is frequently adapted for military use as a cargo and
non-combat personnel carrier and a mobile headquarters.

It can also be modified for longer duration habitation,
making it useful for explorers or researchers.

Carried aboard a starship, it takes up 4 displacement tons.

I think you\'ll find that your graduate engineers get paid too much! A
Corporal in the British Army could be a helo pilot; a tank commander or
the senior NCO in a section of infantry - all jobs that show an equal
(if not higher) level of responsibility than that afforded to the new
graduate engineer. And the bonus of being shot at, too!

Even so, the UK Armed forces have a retention problem in both enlisted
and officer branches.

You said it!  There\'s nothing that the massed pipes and drums to make you
want to go invade something, preferably northern England.

My Marines use pipes.  Mostly it\'s a tradition thing, but the effect pipers
in a small starship have on Naval crew is a big plus.

It\'s in the vicinity of Yaskodray\'s toy universe, so perhaps the large
amount of antimatter is an artifaxct of the pinching off of that pocket
universe.

2300 was a separate game.  Not at all part the Traveller lineage.

If you count the various releases of D&D, rules expansions, Player Option
books, etc., AD&D has been through more "versions" than Traveller.  It\'s
one of the reasons I stopped playing D&D some years ago, and am looking
forward to the new edition.

Sadly, no game can stand like a rock and expect to survive.  See my example
on D&D above.  MegaTraveller came about because DGP had a genuinely better
way to handle tasks, and GDW wanted to spice up the setting; introduce some
conflict.

Publishers do want to cash in on successful games, that\'s how they stay in
business!  The decision to go to the GDW house system was a mistake IMHO,
but understandable since it would have allowed cross pollination between
the game systems.  (I actually played in a Twilight:2000 game set five
years after the Vilani invasion of Earth.. M-16s vs. Gauss Rifles!)

T4 was pushed far to fast.  If the publisher had been willing to wait
another six months to allow for play testing and editing, I think that we
would still see that system as a living game today.

Gaming is a niche hobby, with a thousand little camps in it.  We all love
Traveller, others can\'t understand why we like this game and not White
Wolf\'s World of Darkness.

I was last there 6 months or so ago. Gaming selection is pretty poor. Nan\'s 
Games (on the opposite side of Highway 59, near the Greenbriar/Shepard exit) 
has a very good gaming selection but the staff is just as unhelpful.

Not far way is a Half-Price Books (Kirby and University). Gaming selection 
is erratic (fair to poor) and parking is horrible, but has plenty of cheap 
non-gaming books (I\'ve also been to all the other HPB in the Houston area 
(except the one far south of Houston) within the last six months -- the best 
for gaming, usually, is the one on Westheimer, a few blocks north of 
Dairy-Ashford -- also has a Fuddruckers across the street, too).

A generous and sadistic GM,

Brandon Cope

I love both. White Wolf has done a fantastic job, even with the terrible
editing. Anyone know where page xx is? And then there are the paragraphs
that are not completed on the following page. But I did get a look at SJG\'s
Werewolf, and Steve apparently knows how to hire a team of editors. I wish
the mechanics of GURPs was more enjoyable, but they drive me nuts. The
Storyteller system has great potential, but it seems that the designers are
not aware of some of the possibilities in the way the dice protocols work. I
have fiddled with extended contests, factored successes, and scads of other
tweaks. The pips are handy for newbie gamers too, making it fun to learn.

It\'s \'Shionthy\', IIRC (don\'t have a reference handy).

> Antimatter? Is this plausible? Or is Yaskodray to blame?

The latter, almost certainly...

*** "SECRET OF THE ANCIENTS" SPOILER ***

The SotA adventure places Y\'s pocket universe right next door to Shionthy.
Presumably, nearby systems would have been both major targets during the
wars with the grandkids, and experimental laboratories for Y\'s
hyperphysics noodling.  All manner of weirdness in these systems is thus
easily explainable.

Ahem. If you\'re going to claim Traveller has six versions (actually *7*)
with 2300 included (CT, MT, TNE, T4, GT, T2300, 2300AD) then I feel it\'s
only fair to count the D&D range in to AD&D as they are about as closely
related. In which case we get at least 4 editions of D&D on top of 3
releases of AD&D before thrid edition...

That\'s

AD&D 1st (cover set 1)
[AD&D 1st cover set 2 (IIRC)]
AD&D 2nd Edition (cover 1)
AD&D 2nd Edition (cover 2)
AD&D 3rd Edition (powergamer\'s wet dream due August 2000)

D&D - original (probably more copies here)
D&D Basic - Blue book
D&D Basic - Red Box
D&D Introductory Game....

And that ignores Expert, Companion, Immortal etc...


The real difference was TSR is the only publisher of (A)D&D.

*CT and MT are evolutions of the same game (maybe the analogy is the
differences in AC between D&D and AD&D)
*TNE was something altogether different
*T4 was something which had potential but was murdered by the publisher,
but was more of an evolution of CT/MT than TNE.
*GT is something different.
*2300 and T2300 are evolutions of the same game.

Well, Jim, assuming you use the \'standard\' 60 watt bulbs, 10 of them are 0.6kW.
If you use 100W bulbs, 6 is 0.6 kW.

Your TV probably runs 0.25kW give or take a hundred watts...

However, since the lowest entropy conversion is kinetic to kinetic, it
really is going to be able to go that fast (maybe not accellerate well),
and since humans can walk at 3-4 mph, and can run (in short bursts) up to
20 MPH, it really just needs to reduce the energy of running, not do the
running for them... 13 MPH is very reasonable...

In MT, uncertain means both player and GM are rolling dice, and the
player\'s dice indicate whther or not he knows he made it or not; this is a
major hassle. Slows things down a lot, too. And since all not having the
skill does is effectively apply a DM-4....

Meson screen = DR 10,000

There seems to be a similar calculation for particle beams vs armour.

When I look at bay weapons, it gets worse - for the same Trillion Cr it 
cost for the spinal mount I can buy 40 bays, each doing 6dx1500.  
Against DR 10,000 armour this gives 40 bays x (30,000 - 10,000) = 
800,000 HP of damage, enough to wipe out a Megalith-class Battle

I remember those! I may even have some off them stashed away. And that also
does not include Darksun, Krynn, Planescape or any of those other offshoots.
There are some rules changes, and they take the game in a tangent akin to
what MT, T2300, and others do for Traveller. BTW, what is the difference
between T2300 and 2300AD? I am only familiar with CT, although I have
browsed through others at the store.

Hear, Hear! And, in the case of TNE and GT, not really showing any concern
for canon settings. Rip, shred, rend tear, fold spindle and mutilate. (See
Regency Sourcebook) After all they promised the Regency setting for TNE
would be a continuance of the late 3I.... but then it came out as the 3I
sans Nobility. GT is making steady and subtle (oft hidden) changes to
canon. T4 just raped the name to get film rights, I suspect.

Awesome pics! Well, not Jesse\'s, but real cool. This is how I envision
starships in the TL A-C range. What do you suppose those long struts are on
the first ships aft section? I thought first solar collecters, but on the
zoom I noticed they seem to be square rods. Heat sinks?

No, no, no, no, no.  A thousand times no.  I will not even entertain the
thought that 2300AD is Traveller.  I\'m still not sure about TNE!  I only
accept MT because it was done by DGP whose CT stuff was excellent.  I move
that we adjust the names of the versions so that they comply with the truth
in advertising laws:

Not "CT", just Traveller
Not "MT, but Mega Digest Group Publications
Not "T:TNE", but Chadwick\'s Virus
Not "T4", but Marc Miller\'s Imperium Gamble
Not "GT", but Evil Stevie\'s Pocket Universe
and certainly not "T5".... no matter what you call it, it won\'t come

I like the Storyteller system, myself, and have enjoyed discussing 
William Hostman\'s conversion of Traveller under the ST system with 
him this last week.  It might make for an interesting experiment 
sometime, tweaked, of course, to reflect my own interpretations of 
such a translation.  (Kidding, William; you\'ve done a great job.

That sounds awesome, how far is he on it? I find that players realy like
rolling /lots/ of dice, and ST is great for that. Plus the inclusion of the
"Rule of One" and compounding successes as in Shadowrun makes for great dice
doodling. I like some of the dicing conventions in GURPs as well, and would
love to see them added. I know, I\'m usually down on GURPs, but there are
many strong points to the system. I just want more attributes, less derived
scores, less math, and better terminology. I do not like the way GURPs
handles tech levels or components like fuel cells and reactors. I also
prefer the CT style of Chr Gen, as templates seem so AD&D class-like. I know
it is just to start the Chr, but it seems like ship construction, not life
experience. I like the fact that I can *die* during Chr Gen. OK, I\'m wierd.

Aside from some minor (major?) rules changes, the game was renamed to 
eliminate confusion with Traveller -- apparently, many Traveller fans (later 
_angry_ Traveller fans) bought Traveller 2300 thinking it was just an 
expansion for (Classic) Traveller.

A generous and sadistic GM,

Linux should support any of the widely-available unix formats -
that would be tar and gzip almost universally; you may also be
able to get a PKZIP-compatible program.

As far as StarOffice files moving from Wintel to Linux, my
understanding of the goals of StarOffice was to make exactly that
possible, without needing to go through obscure interchange
formats.

Traveller: 2300 was the first edition. 2300AD was the revised, expanded and
renamed game. Thinking back; the core task system remained the same (and
had more in common with MT than TNE), there may have been a few changes to
the combat rules, but the big change was more background material on the
universe. 2300AD is also more flimsy than T2300 as it did not have a card
cover. The rename also distanced it from Traveller....

Both are cracking games and supplements like:

Aurore Sourcebook
Nyotekundo Sourcebook (may be mispelt)

Are easily usable with Traveller for plots.

The Keith\'s influence shows. It is a harder SF game than Traveller, and
shares more flavor with Aliens (style). Again, it is a game of growth and
expansion and uses a drive system favoured by heretics ;-) It is set in the
Twilight 2000 universe, 300 years on where the French Empire is the
dominant power.

I really like the game and would recommend it.

There was a good review of it in Dragon many moons ago.

>AD&D 1st (cover set 1)

Absolutely no changes at all from the first cover to the second cover. A new
cover does not a new version make.

>AD&D 2nd Edition (cover 1)
>AD&D 2nd Edition (cover 2)


Different covers, different interior artwork (in fact, there were two
different runs of the second cover AD&D Player\'s Handbook with different
interior artwork). Although there were some changes in text, 2nd edition
with the first set of covers and 2nd edition with the second set of covers
are functionally the same.

>D&D - original (probably more copies here)

>D&D Basic - Blue book
>D&D Basic - Red Box


Once D&D settled down in about 1980, TSR didn\'t have much interest in
changing it. Later rules editions had different authors, different
pagination, etc, but the rules were, as far as I can remember, completely
compatible.

A different cover, different artwork or different formatting for the same
rules does not put a game into a new edition. Such a concept is simply
absurd. If that was the case, Traveller went through many editions before
MegaTraveller ever came out:

Traveller LBBs (two different covers, if I remember correctly, so possibly
two versions)
The Traveller Book (hardcover)
The Traveller Book (softcover)



>D&D Introductory Game....
>
>And that ignores Expert, Companion, Immortal etc...


As well it should. After all, most people wouldn\'t include Book 4: Mercenary
as a new edition of Traveller, even though it was an official expansion to
the rules of Traveller. Same with Book 5, Book 6, etc.

>The real difference was TSR is the only publisher of (A)D&D.


No, the real difference is that TSR has always worked to keep different
versions of D&D as standardized as possible. They do this by adding new
rules on top of the existing rules, which is why quite a few people complain
bitterly about how the game feels like a patchwork.

The core mechanics of D&D and AD&D have stayed pretty much the same. Spells
have always followed the same framework, the core classes have been
maintained, combat has always been conducted in the same fashion using the
same terms.

There has not yet been a jump with any aspect of the D&D the way that
Traveller jumped to MegaTraveller (there were major changes in the way
combats were resolved as well as a fundamental change from a simple skill
resolution system to a completely different task system). Neither D&D nor
AD&D ever made a jump that was at all like the one from MegaTraveller to
Traveller: The New Era in which nearly everything about the game was changed
from the ground up.

For the record: I consider that there have been only 4 versions of Traveller
so far. I don\'t count Traveller: 2300 nor do I count 2300 AD, as they were
never really intended to fit into the timeline of the Traveller universe.
Further, I don\'t count GURPS: Traveller as a distinct version of the game,
because it\'s not. It\'s merely the application of a part of Traveller\'s
background to another game system, and it\'s merely a licensed product.

It *is* a problem with the core rules though! Every time a new Traveller

don\'t mind buying supplements if they add to things I already have. I do

Really? Not all that different from all of the extra Books a player had to
buy for Traveller, no? Book 4: Mercenary... Book 5: High Guard... Book 6:
Scouts... etc. In fact, GDW pioneered the concept of adding rules after the
game was "done." ;)

It always ammuses me that most people have that attitude that we
"know" how technology will develop.  While it is comforting to think out
modern society will be the basis for all society in the future, the fact is
that we have no idea how representative, or unique, or society will turn
out to be.  (We don\'t, after all, all have air cars, vacations on the moon,
and nuclear airplanes as envisioned in the 50\'s)

In fact, most of this is based off of some extrapolations of how
technology is developing.  However, many of these extrapolations
produce results that we can\'t even imagine in a short period of time
(if you include any sort of curvature to the extrapoltion, you can reach a
point where advances start coming so fast you reach a "technological
singularity).

The fact is that we really have no idea how easy it will be to progress in
the future.  The vision presented is as good as any....

I agree, and the /best/ supplements are the ones with *no* reference to
rules-set. I have a book called "Aliens in Space", and it makes no reference
to any "Universe" or rul-set. I doubt it was written for gamers, it reads
more like a travel guide. I used it in a Star Wars campaign, and it was
wonderful. Added a lot of texture.

I always figured that Shionthy Belt was a result of either Grandfather or
one of the Kids pointing a big-ass Charge Reversal Ray(tm) at a planet
(call it Shionthy) and turning it on.  Presumably only a portion of the
planet\'s mass flipped from matter to antimatter... but the resulting global
reaction was more than sufficient to blow Shionthy into fragments.  Some of
these fragments later met up with their opposites and became smaller
fragments, accompanied by a nice flash of hard gamma.

Locating antimatter chunks in Shionthy Belt shouldn\'t be too hard.  Just
look for the strangely eroded-looking asteroids (due to interaction with
the solar wind) giving off radiation (ditto).  I hope you have good
radiation shielding, especially if there\'s a collision-flare nearby, and
for god\'s sake don\'t try to land on one.

This, of course, ignores an entirely different sort of risk - that of
"Imperial entanglements."  Aside from the obvious safety hazard, it seems
the Navy doesn\'t like the idea of people carting off pieces of the most
powerful explosive known to humaniti.

I\'m not a big fan of generic supplements by any stretch of the imagination.
For some reason I can\'t stand using anything like that in my campaigns. My
reasoning is sort of like this: if I want something that is suitably
generic, and not rules specific, I might as well hit the library or
bookstore and get something unrelated to gaming, something like a book by
Freeman Dyson for the social effects of technology, or any one of several
hundred theorists, philosophers and wannabes for governments and political
leanings, or a decent overview sci-fi book to spur my imagination for
aliens.

What I was trying to get at is: each new version of Traveller means I have
to buy all new books, but more importantly it means that people have to
*write* all new books, and do all of the work of tweaking new designs for
common weapons, items, ships, vehicles, etc.

It\'s ultimately self-defeating.

Actually, after Adventures 2 & 3, I always pegged the Annic Nova as a
Droyne hand-built starship. It\'s an easy way to explain many of the

Sorry about that.  I really need to make sure that I don\'t infringe on

I\'ll try to do that and have a "yea" or "nay" for you tomorrow night.

Ah, the pipes!

One side-benefit of my old apartment in Baton Rouge (since torn down to
build a supermarket) was that a group of pipers used to practice in the
YMCA parking lot next door.

In our Traveller game (now on hiatus) set on Garda-Vilis circa 1100, my
character\'s regiment, the 1199th Jump Infantry Regiment, follows many
Scottish traditions (as interpreted by my ref), including the pipes.

Wil, Wil, don\'t be afraid to let your true feelings out, OK?  ;-)

BTW, for the record I guess I should say that I *hate* the TNE rules and
have never played a TNE game. However, I believe there is redeemable
material even in TNE. And, just maybe, in T4. ;-)

For my money, the Regency Sourcebook was the most useful and scholarly book
in the whole of TNE (well, apart from the whole "Kinunir" issue - see my
site for details - and the use of sub-100-ton jump boats ;-). It gathered
together many references from OOP sources and created a plausible history
for the Regency setting. Sure, I didn\'t like the wholesale removal of the
nobility, but (a) it was done reasonably plausibly, and (b) you could duck
the issue by making your PCs one of the "continuing" nobility (not everyone
lost their title).

The main beef I had when I first read TNE was that GDW seemed intent on
destroying everything DGP had created for the game:
     - no robots (one of DGP\'s main PCs was a robot, another a roboticist);
     - the whole area of the "Grand Tour" (DGPs main contribution to
background canon) now in ruins;
     - any thought of a resolution to the Rebellion storyline (designed by
DGP) smashed beyond repair.

The RSB *almost* changed the way I viewed the TNE timeline, and I was
looking forward to more Regency sourcebooks when GDW folded. As one of
those who "cried when Strephon died" (refer to Doug\'s Silly Trav page) I
found the main thing was that it was really quite sad to read through, in
the way that only a empire\'s "shadow of its former self" can be (sorry if
that sounds too melancholy).

Oh dear, I think this thread is about to explode into the Annual TML
Ruleset Flame War, yet again. That is *not* my intent, I\'m more of an
inclusivist (is that a word??;-). Maybe we need to name them 1st RFW, 2nd
RFW, (ducking)...
