Time for a kibbutz by a co-author.

The bulk of this book was co-authored by Joe Walsh and myself.
I wrote the rules section, and it was used for much of the follow on 
work as well.

When we wrote PI, and in particular when I wrote the section on 
detailing institutes, and detailing reactions, I had an eye to the 
future when writing for other Milieu books might be necessary.  In 
other words, with a few modifications, it can really be adapted fairly 
easily along the timeline.

We wrote Milieu 0\'s view on psionics to be akin to the Imperium\'s 
view on the internal politics of member worlds.  Each world is going 
to have its own view of psionics.  Some will be xenophobic enough 
about it to make the later eras of the Imperium look moderate by 
comparison.  Others will be pro-psionics to the point that they may 
integrate it *further* into the political structure of the world than the 
Zhodani do (i.e. a ruling class which is not at all hereditary, but 
based upon psionic ability...even the Zhodani allow the idea of 
hereditary titles, as written in CT).  Other worlds (most worlds) will 
be somewhere in the middle, not strongly pro- or anti-psionic, but 
no strong unified opinion either way.

We basically saw this as being a reasonable state of being for the 
Imperium on the subject for the first few hundred years of the 
Imperium.

The catalyst to the change, of course, would be the Zhodani.  The 
Frontier Wars, and the fact that the Zhodani are a very alien human 
society would probably galvanize public opinion against the Zhos, 
and by extension, psionics. Opinion would gradually harden 
against psionics until it reached its peak during the suppressions.

A few modifiers to the UWP extension that determines whether a 
world is pro- or anti-psionics would be all that would be necessary.  
Institutes of course would tend to be smaller, and obviously will be 
more covert.

I may take a few minutes next week, and make an effort to come 
up with the modifications we envisioned for the PI rules to reflect 
this info.

Doug refers specifically to the Anti-Psionics point of view.  One of 
the things I wasted a lot of time on studying in my misspent youth 
was propaganda, especially that of Nazi Germany.

Basically, I tried to write the piece from the point of view of a 
flaming fringe group that would react to psionics in the same 
manner as the Nazis did to Jews, or as you see in the extreme 
cases on both sides of the abortion debate, or gun control, or 
animal rights, or any other emotionally charged topic.

In retrospect, I think I went too far.  I think it loses some of its 
effectiveness by not doing good enough of a job of being persuasive 
to a reasonable person.  It certainly does make the extreme anti-
psionics camp look scary, which was the goal.

If I may say so, PI was probably the best project I had the good 
fortune to work on for IG. It embodied what I feel a good 
supplement should be, some rules, but mainly lots of setting 
material.  I thought it was great because unlike a lot of things, it 
gave rules, but then took the rules, and used them to advance the 
background.

I have to say of the things I worked on, it is the best thing we did, 
and the one I\'m most proud of.

Now if only IG had paid me more than 10 cents on the dollar for the 
work, I\'d have been in heaven.  <G>

You make a couple of assumptions here with which I\'m uncomfortable. 
First, you assume that the transponder doesn\'t include information about
the type of ship (size, power signature, etc.) on which it\'s mounted. 
Either that, or you assume that said pirates are consistently taking as
prizes ships of similar configuration to their own.  Were I an official
with my world\'s Space Traffic Control agency, I would be _exceedingly_
suspicious of a ship that claimed to be a Type A Free Trader, yet had
the signature of a Type C Mercenary Cruiser.

Second, you assume that, in the time it takes to dismount a transponder
from one ship (assuming that, in crippling the prey, the pirate ship
didn\'t damage or destroy the transponder), and mounting it in a second
ship, no word of the first ship\'s demise would reach any authorities.  I
would expect that, upon the unexplained disappearance of a ship, the
authorities would pass the word to nearby systems.  At very least, were
I a pirate, I would not want to assume otherwise.

Third, you assume that the pirates can jump back outsystem, having taken
a prize, but before a Space Traffic Control official, already made
suspicious by a transponder signal that doesn\'t correspond to the ship\'s
signature, can vector customs ships to the site.  Since most stock ships
only carry enough fuel for one jump of the ship\'s maximum capability,
the ability to retain enough fuel to jump out quickly means one of three
things:

	1.  You have remained close to the home of one of your previous targets
(by close, I mean close enough for word of your target\'s demise to have
possibly reached the world to which you jumped);

	2.  You have installed extra fuel tanks in your pirate ship\'s cargo
holds, thus reducing the amount of cargo that you can take from a prize
(and thus your profit as compared to your risk);

	3.  You are flying a ship of sufficiently high TL to be capable of high
jump numbers (5 or 6, which require TL 14 or 15, respectively).  This
gives two problems:

		a.  You still have lots of space taken up by jump fuel (the immutable
10% of ship\'s displacement per jump number); and

		b.  You have a greater likelihood of a mismatch between the
transponder\'s reporting of your ship\'s data and your actual signature.

Bottom line, using the transponder of a prize ship would probably lead
to your apprehension/destruction _faster_ than turning your own
transponder off would.  At least a ship with no running transponder
stands a chance of not being detected in time, while a ship with a
stolen transponder runs the risks that:

The authorities already have word that the target ship has disappeared;
and/or

The stolen transponder is broadcasting a ship\'s signature different from
that of the pirate ship; and/or

The authorities will vector customs ships to the site of the battle
before you can both dismount the new prize\'s transponder (and, of
course, cargo) and jump out.

Color me paranoid, but, unless I _knew_ that _none_ of these issues
would occur to my referee, I would steer clear of this idea.  (I\'ve
played in RPGs where I could get away with similar things, and _did_,
but I don\'t _expect_ to do so.)

Hmm.  Clinton\'s approval rating is 60%+ after Monday\'s release of

I prefer the term "tamper-resistant", simply because _any_ security
system devised by humans can be defeated by humans, given sufficient
resources (including time).

Having made that minor quibble, it would seem that we are in basic
agreement that one cannot simply remove a transponder from one ship,
mount it on another, and expect to get away with the deception.  Unless,
of course, one happens to be blessed/cursed with a game referee that
would buy off on such a flawed plan.  (Having advanced beyond such
Velveeta-like behavior, I think of such players as cursed.  OTOH, it is
the nature of PCs to test the limits of the referee, and I can hardly
blame players for taking advantage of a referee\'s ignorance or
weakness....)

Just don\'t count on it in any game run by Traveller grognards.....

"Tamperproof". Interesting word. Kind of reminds me of another word...
"Unsinkable".  <Cut to exciting footage from _Titanic_>

<g>

Seriously, the nature of transponders is one of those major campaign
molding decisions by the referee. CT Canon mentions at least two
instances of private citizens having variable transponders
(a Fat Trader in _The Traveller Adventure_ and the example
Corsair in _Supp 4: Citizens of the Imperium_). DGP\'s
_Starship Operations Manual_ talks about transponders being
encased in "the same stuff they make battledress out of" - anything
you use to cut the case will also be strong enough to frag the
interior. Navy transponders are mentioned as being able to transmit
almost anything the signals chief wants them to, from full data
to "I\'m an Imperial Navy Ship" to "I\'m not a scout ship, I\'m a
50,000tn battlecruiser. No, really, your 100dtn sensor image of
me must be some kind of malfunction..."

This points me to the idea that there is different gear on different
ships fulfilling the role of "transponder". The Third Imperium may
require every new ship and small craft built or operating within it\'s
borders to have a self-contained TL-15 transponder installed, with
a unique encrypted signature and the best tamperproofing money
can buy. Once you\'ve built several million of these over several decades
and transported them several year\'s travel time across the Imperium,
the secret to making them and keeping them secure will no longer be a
secret.

I wonder - is a transponder upgrade part of the annual maintenance
procedure? So every year when you stop by a well-patrolled system,
your transponder signal will be just a little bit different? <g>

If the US wanted to effect the change it would happen. In the past few decades 
numerous countries have done exactly that. Canada, the UK, Australia, NZ etc 
have all changed from Imperial to Metric with comparative ease. Given the will 
on the part of the government the change is surprisingly easy and fast (around 
10 years). All it really takes is a concerted education campaign and changing 
all the "road signs" etc. NZ went metric in the early 70\'s and now the change is 
sufficently complete that people have a hard time comprehending the weight 
factor involved in a McDonalds quarter pounder. The common people use the 
units which are around them. Change the units and the people will change.

If the Terrans wanted to impose the metric system on the Vilani it would have 
been quite easy; and it would make a lot of sense for them to have done so. It 
not that the Vilani changed voluntarily, its that the Solomani imposed the 
change from above because it was a) easier for them and b) a simple and 
seemingly innocuous way of establishing the authority of the Rule of Man in a 
very concrete way (akin to the adoption of the Imperial calendar by the 3rd 
Imperium).

Very true, which is why the metric system only has to survive in the 17 or so 
worlds that made up the Sylean Federation; again not too hard to believe.

I was under the impression that in order to get bank financing, you have to
provide a prospective trade route that you intend to use.  I\'m pretty sure
that the bank would send out notices to those systems to expect the ship in
question.  If you\'re not on your appointed route, you need to provide proof
of ownership.  With no proof provided, the system could impound the vehicle
until the paper trail gets resolved.

I use some ideas I saw in White Dwarf magazine a long time ago
(when it was good, not just a house organ for Games Workshop)
involving hard to forge high-tech plastic coins, money chits and
plaques. The big black plaques are MCr1, the little white coins are
tenth-Cr (or less) up to Cr1, the chits go up to Cr100, larger plaques
go up from there. A well-secured attache case can carry
the purchase price of a starship, good the moment it is presented
at a shipyard with no wait while a bank two months away sends
approval. Better yet, people have something to steal when you
mug them...<g>

I also use Letters of Credit (an idea I got from the Knights Templar),
portable items of value like gems (an idea I got from SPI\'s wargame
_Freedom in the Galaxy_), and some credit cards.

Credit cards are most commonly used by the vast majority of people
who don\'t travel between the stars. They are also used by people who
don\'t travel far, or stay on the same routes (so their financial data
can keep up with them). The moment you get away from X-Boat routes,
your credit card becomes unreliable. A lower-tech world might not
be able to take it at all, and even the higher-tech startown 
establishment\'s reader might reject your card (not long enough on
planet, no previous recorded planetfalls, no records, etc). IMTU,
everyone carries cash. This may also be the reason, BTW, most
people seem to carry weapons as well...

An Example of high finance:

Ex-Merchant Captain Jed Furgall decides to buy a nice, new
Far Trader at Regina. He won the Monsterball Lottery Jackpot on Efate
last month, and he has a bank account in the First Bank of Efate
with MCr49 in it. Captain Furgall has no reputation as a swindler,
the news from Efate mentioned his newfound wealth, and he brought
a Letter of Credit from his bank on Efate to a bank (that knew the Efate
bank) on Regina. The Regina bank will extend him credit (which will
eventually be balanced by an electronic or even physical transfer
of wealth between the bank on Efate and the bank on Regina), he
can probably buy his starship today if one is sitting on the lot.

Many travellers wear rings, pendants and other small items of value
to use as a cash reserve. Those who travel frequently to primitive
planets often are quite encumbered by such trinkets, as they may
need to deal regularly with people who would rather barter than take
odd-looking pieces of plastic.

What does a fistful of credits look like IYTU?

TNE lists thrust at 0.003 kN per kL of drive.  But that .033 was brough up

I remember some type of discovery channel show a while ago that talked of
modern-day safeguards. The talk concerned police officers\' weapons that
became compromised (taken from the officer) and used to kill the officer
themselves. 
The solution I remember involved a simple IC (well, maybe not that
simple) that read code from a ring on the officer\'s finger, allowing the
gun to fire. Without contact with the ring (perhaps allowing for gloves,
of course), the weapon was dead. This was intended for a semi-automatic
hand gun, BTW.

The drawback is it only takes the ring to make the gun work, as opposed
to finger-print or retina scans. The plus side, it takes a lot more
effort to get that ring off of my finger (or finger off of my hand) if
you want to use my gun, than simply fighting me for the gun.

Although this may be possible at today\'s TL, I have not seen it in use. I
can\'t imagine it would take much more tech, merely consumer desire (or
legislation?!). 

IMTU: Law enforcement and many military units use these safeguards, while
personal weapons and *private companies* use a more convenient,
*untraceable* style.

I don\'t have the Traveller Adventure to dissect it.  Can someone
summarize/paraphrase how exactly this configuation worked?  The SDG
transponders couldn\'t be reprogramed at all.  If the black box is broken, the
deyo chip (and it\'s control chip) are both turned into slag by a power surge.

Imperium-wide ship lists would not work IMO.  Odds are a ship could get there
faster than normal information flows (the xboat network), especially for
worlds off the xboat routes.  It\'s surely possible (and even likely) the IN
(naval couriers) and the Iridium Throne (the TI/TJ network) and intellegence
agencies could and would get *their* lists at Jump 6 to their appropriate
stations but nothing like the "Bureau of Ship Services" would.  Anything that
public is going to stay on the xboat routes.

It would be rare for any civilian ship to come a jump or two off the Xboat
route? Anything off the xboat route is probably more than just one or two
weeks/jumps behind the news.

On the subject of hard currency (specie), I can see two ways to view the
subject, given that transmutation of elements is possible, even at TL
8:  either the standard of currency is a material that is intrinsically
valuable, regardless of the quantity (e.g., lanthanum for jump drive
grids), or the currency standard is based on the naturally-occurring
ratio of isotopes of the material in question.  In other words, while
transmuting other elements into chemically-pure iridium may be possible,
and, for industrial uses, profitable, getting the ratio of isotopes
correct to match naturally-occurring iridium, the Imperial monetary
standard, may be more expensive than the natural iridium one hopes to
duplicate.

Reminds me of the story behind the tradition of Special Forces soldiers

  Tax farming. I\'m disgusted, Comrade. And don\'t try that "I\'m only
channelling Mr. Elliott" - just because he went to law school doesn\'t
mean that he\'s a parasite :>

  But seriously, although the reasons would be completely different I
can see the 3I\'s weedier member states farming out their fisc fairly 
often even while the Imperium never would (though we haven\'t yet seen
a pre-TNE statement of what that tax base is, IIRC).

  For a regime as byzantine as the 3I, it would actually make sense for
there to be a (low-key - who wants to watch a documentary about pushing
the frontiers of accountancy* in some backwater system) mega-corp that
does nothing but offer a complete array of financial services: customs,
foreign exchange, advances against revenue, long-term loans, and broad
consultantcy services (gee, their troubleshooters almost all seem to be
ex-Imperial service officers - they must have a good working relationship
with the Navy\'s personnel tracking/pensions department!).

  I wonder if ImperialLines has a sister (mother?) corp? Or maybe this is
the idea that they didn\'t implement but should have?

  * go ahead - it\'s been months since snippets of that sketch were last
posted...

  This problem _could not_ arise if the registry info on a new (or rebuilt)
ship were required to be distributed when the work started; a new starship
can\'t really be built in under half a year, which is [~24 * 2.8] about a
sector and a half circle of pre-information: a rebuild would hardly ever
come in under 10 weeks.

  The common existence of this problem requires that the authorities not 
make any serious effort to avoid it.

  OTOH, it is much easier to assume that after-the-fact checking of ships
whereabouts (ship X was logged in two places on date Y - put out APB) is
conducted in a leisurely manner to avoid false alerts caused by delays in
the X-boat system*.

  * it would be interesting to see the results of the somewhat masochistic
task of analysing what delays could accrue randomly across sections of the

In the wake of the collapse of the Ziru Sirka, Terrans fled their homeworld
in an exodus of unheard of proportions.  With nearly limitless space
available, every group that felt entitled to homeland now had the chance to
take one.

To accommodate these masses of people, Harley-Davidson of Ceres began
constructing the "Okie" class Colonial Transport.  A simple design made to
move one million colonists to their new homes.

The John C. Fremont, a typical example of these ships, is a two million ton
cylinder, half a kilometer long.  Equipped with minimal thrusters, the
vessel is incapable of making more than .8 G acceleration.  The Jump drives
were top of the line for their day, and were capable of jump three.  Due to
the ongoing power requirement of the jump drive, the power plant was
massively over strength, and was only run a peak power for jump evolutions.
 Normal loading was about 22% of full capacity.

The ship\'s electronics were basic.  A simple PEMS/AEMS array made up the
sensor suite, and the computer assembly, while good, tended to be whatever
system was available to the shipyard during construction.  The operating
system was design for maximum ease of use, allowing a (relatively) smaller
crew.

The Fremont is unarmed, and unarmored.  It was expected the units of the
Confederation Navy would escort colonists to their destination, if only to
provide an accurate census for the taxmen back on Earth!  Due to their
sheer size, the Okie class could absorb considerable damage.

Colonists lived in cramped quarters, but had the use of the farm decks for
recreation.  On these double height decks, animals as large as pigs were
kept for food.  Hydroponics vats provided fresh vegetables and fruit.
Since the journey to a new world might take months to complete, one
gymnasium was provided for every 250 colonists onboard.

Living in such cramped quarters demands discipline, and a 2500-man police
force provided enforcement of the ship\'s regulations.  Jail capacity for
350 was put in, although most breeches were dealt with by fines or
confinement to quarters.

Once the target system was reached, the colonists would disembark on the
forty 100-ton shuttles.  These vessels would also ferry down the fifty
thousand tons of equipment held in the hold.  This amounted to only 50kg
per colonist, so great care had to be taken in choosing what to bring with
you!

Also carried were 15 cutters optimized for survey work.  These cutters
would act as liaison and scout craft during the initial start-up for the
colony, and often the contract between the colonial group and the Terran
Confederation government called for the purchase of one or two cutters when
the Okie left the system.

Ships like the Fremont would tend to loiter on site for 4-6 standard
months.  This was to allow the colony to take root, and if necessary,
perform an emergency evacuation of the colony.

  In all seriousness I assume that you\'re talking about the West Indies
and environ? Given that one of the basic premises of the Piracy debate
(#25?) is that privateering doesn\'t count, you still have to fuzz the
definition tremendously (by allowing operation from state-sanctioned
safe ports) to have any sort of piracy against truly important targets.

  AFAIK, the English and Dutch (and economics - funny, that) sharply
reduced oceanic borne piracy most of a century before 1707. There\'s
no case that I\'m aware of to be made for significant piracy by ocean-
going vessels in the RN\'s domain after the Seven Years War, except
during wartime (i.e., privateering, for all practical purposes).

  In OTU you can\'t find possible pirate bases, but interdicting the 
practical hunting grounds is simple; in RL the reverse is largely
true, with the exception of the limited case exemplified by the 
SW Pacific archipelagos and the locals habit of basing small pirate
craft up any river they could.

  OC, that too was put an end to without any major effort by the UK or
the RN (although the exertions were quite extreme for the units so tasked).

  Is #1 Virus or near-C rocks?

beyond this distance (i.e, about a two week turn around period for the
x-boat system, other things being equal) become progressively more and
more dodgey, as the ability of persons to charge-up and skip debt becomes
too easy.

As I see it, when you come into a system (given that the tech level is
ok), you would down-load some of your money to a local financial
institution (or even a local branch of the institution that has provided
your smart card) for use in EFTPOS or other charging, or even in the form
of hard cash.  When you want to depart the system, you can either leave
your money there for the next time, or close the account and put the value
back onto the smart-card.

This gives a game-universe justification for characters operating out of a
particular world or set of worlds as a base - away from your base of ops,

it.

How would these cards work?  They would need _hyper_ strong crypto, and

biometrics, PINs, tamper resistance, and so forth.  The other implication
of this sort of a financial regieme is that electronic forgery ought be a
High Imperial crime - screwing with the finance system is screwing with

Dealing with these sorts of crimes would be a high priority for MOJ, and
conceivably IRIS (if there is evidence that this activity is being done by
a foreign power).  I am not sure what the canon answer is to this - its
been a while since I have played Traveller (as Colin Hutchinson well
knows).

  This problem _could not_ arise if the registry info on a new (or rebuilt)
ship were required to be distributed when the work started; a new starship
can\'t really be built in under half a year, which is [~24 * 2.8] about a
sector and a half circle of pre-information: a rebuild would hardly ever
come in under 10 weeks.

She\'s under new registry, with a new owner. I picked "rebuild hull"
because (IMTU) so many ships of dubious background are (or pass
themselves off as) scrapyard rebuilds to explain away missing,
damaged, or unusual serial numbers on parts. Getting a new registry
and new owner on a ship shouldn\'t take long, a lot less time than it
would take for independent verification of the change to trickle through
backwater planets.

  OTOH, it is much easier to assume that after-the-fact checking of ships

I like this idea. Gives the players some room to run if they\'ve been
misbehaving, keeps planetary governments from shooting themselves
in the foot too badly free trader-wise.

But you do get the problem: _Driven Snow_ is logged as being in
two different places on date Y. You catch _Driven Snow_, she claims
to have only been in one place - says either your computer records are
faulty, or that someone else has a copy of their transponder signature.
Unless the Imperium has decreed their records to be perfect, or has
decreed that the transponder system is unbreakable, you\'ll still need
proof that _Driven Snow_ did more than show up as a glitch in your
records.

(Note that the Imperium can have decreed either or both of these
things without them being necessarily true. I\'m imagining a Darrian
anarchist computer hacker making a mint selling TL-16 transponder
spoofers to the Imperial underground, but the Impies trying to cover
it up until they figure out what to do about it.)

This may be where your forensics experts start going over _Driven

There is no crypto that can\'t be cracked, especially considering the
varying tech levels found within a jump of each other (or at least
a sector of each other). That\'s why IMTU credit cards/smartcards
and such are not very important - any time a society starts doing
most of their finance this way, they attract the attention of greedy
people with better crypto tech.

You will find credit cards IMTU being used by people who never outrun
their financial records - people who don\'t travel, or people who stay
on a certain section of main. They leave their stomping grounds,
their credit cards stop working for a while - maybe until they go home.

Of course you can get around that easily by making the medical

I don\'t know, Europe uses a non-decimal calander and has a decimal
measurement system.  Unless the calander and measurement system
were invented by the same person, that doesn\'t, IMO, follow.

I\'m sure you can come up with a bunch of reason why they _might_
have a decimal system, but it isn\'t certain and it still is the
same thing as the metric system.

Since they were convinced that is was necessary to be in step with
the majority of the world.  The rule of Man presuposes that a small
minority will make a population give up an existing system of
measurement and retool just because they say so....

Why?  Is would make more sense, efficiencywise, for the Terrans
to adopt the system the Vilani were using.

It has to survive several millenia intact.  The odds of it evolving
to a new system are good.

Now if you want to assume it happens, it isn\'t outside the realm
of possibility, but my point is that this is hardly the obvious
choice for a believable background.

That conclusion is fine.  But . . .

Would you be able to pull a sword in time?  A knife?  An axe?
I think the situation you describe means that pulling _any_ weapon is
going to sacrifice real initiative to the knife-wielder.  IMHO, you\'d be
better off _not_ going for you weapon.

In Real Life (tm), 99% of those who use a knife to fight, don\'t know
what the hell they\'re doing, not that I know from any real experience.  I\'m
sure in the inexhaustable well fo knowledge and experience on this list,
someone will have the straight dope.

But, from what I\'ve read (and I think something discussing Jim Bowie\'s
professed skill), a _real_ knife fighter holds a knife with the butt in his palm,
thumb and finger on either side of the handle, with the knife held back
and close to the body.  The empty hand is held forward and is used to
grab or push the opponent into a position where the knife hand can
be used to stab into the body.  The idea being one knife hit = mortal wound.

Actually, I think a good way to test a fighting system might be to
compare the effects for dissimilarly equipped opponents.
For example, take someone trained in martial arts against someone
trained in knife, both with average stats.  Then a person untrained in
knife.  IMUO (In My Uninformed Opinion), won\'t the martial artist
be on equal footing with the trained knife fighter and have the advantage
against the untrained knife fighter, since most martial arts spend some
training in disarming such fighter.  It seems to me that the only significant
difference would be in the damage inflicted in the trained vs. trained.

Just something to ponder.
For me at least.

Bloo

Don\'t most martial arts involve
significant training in dealing with these situations?

Who snipes the sniper, eh?

These both sound great.  Recoil will vary according to different factors,
won\'t it?  Like tech level of firearm and any specific anti-recoil mechanisms,
whether the firer is braced, etc.

I saw a report on television a year ago, that was mostly about non-lethal
weapons, but that a gun that when fired, would discharge some additional
very small particles, (I think grain of rice sized), that would have a unique
number on them allowing the gun owner to be identified.  (Its been a
while, I\'m sure I have something wrong.  It might be that the bullets
contain something that will allow identification even if the bullet is
fragmented into rice-sized bits).

Also, someone was developing a sound system for cities to use that would
immediately trinagulate weapons fire and alert the police to the precise
location.  It was supposed to be able to discriminate between real gunfire
and other similar noises, but I doubt that.

This reminds me about ice ages.

I know that our seasons are caused by the axial tilt.  But does it play
a role in ice ages too?  Just curious.

My other question/point:
Shouldn\'t a lot of planets be in an ice age at any given time?
Assuming most livable planets have ice ages.

And if they don\'t have ice ages, won\'t they have relatively smooth
worlds (from lack of moving glaciers) except from tectonic activity,
i.e., volcanoes and mountain ranges.  IIRC, most of the big flood
plains, like the Great Plains of the US, were caused by glaciation,
so without that factor, large and agriculturally fertile areas might be
smaller and concentrated?  Hmm, but then there\'s precipitation.
And if there is no flood plain, it sits and saturates, leaving us with
a mud world (not a Mudd world ;-) and probably swampy.
Definitely bad for development.

I think in Jackie Chan\'s "First Strike", he\'s holding a combat rifle
with just his fingers from the side, i.e., barrel facing left, stock right.
Of course, there is a bad guy on each side of him.  He pushes the
trigger. The bullet gets the baddie on the left.  The rifle itself,
from the recoil, gets the baddie on the right in the solar plexus
with a perfectly acted "Oof."  Maybe in 0G.

Whoever wrote this lifted it almost totally verbatim from CNN\'s story.
All those "unproven"s in row is hard to forget.  As the story went on to
say, the idea is from the early 60s.

There is a great chapter on Ion drives in a book called, IIRC,
"The Future of Rocketry" that makes the case that it will be the
drive of choice for large volumes to be shipped interplanetary distances,
where there is no rush.

No the general population in these countries was at best ambivelant to the 
changes and there was considerable resistance. The change occured because 
it was imposed from above. Basically laws were passed requiring the use of 
metrics in certain everyday situations (speed limits, surveying and land, 
education, packaging etc.) the environment was changed to metrics, this 
coupled with a large education campaign forced the populous to change. 
Basically if you have to use metrics they will become your intuitive standard.

No, they have their own infrastructure based on Terran standards and even 
more importantly it is a darn good way of showing they are in charge (much like 
the use of Anglic as the official language).

Not really. Weights and measures don\'t evolve as such. They either survive 
pretty much intact or are totally replaced. The whole point of weights and 
measures is to give certainty, the mile has remained constant for over 1000 
years.

My point is that it adds to the background to assume that they do. Like the 365 
day year. Just why does the 3rd Imperium use a 365 day year? The "real" 
answer is that it makes the game a whole lot more playable; but the "game" 
answer is that Sylea just happens to have a 365 day year too (365.04 days 
IIRC from the TD it was covered in). Its little details like that which set Traveller 
apart in my mind.

Curiously, at the same time as the metric system was introduced there was a 
big push to adopt a decimal calendar too (France even adopted it for awhile 
after the revolution); and it was invented by the same people who came up with 
the metric system. However our sense of time is more deeply ingrained then 
our sense of distance and proportions.

However the use of a decimal calendar by the Vilani indicates that they 
probably used base 10 numerology; and given their sense of efficency, a 
decimal system of weights and measures would make sense. Having said that, 
the Vilani measurement system I\'ve created for my Interstellar Wars work is not 
strictly decimal. I\'ve taken the liberty of reproducing it below:

Subject: [TravLang] Vilani maths
Reply-To: TravLang@mail.execnet.com

In the work I\'m doing on the IW I wanted to make some Traditional 
Vilani weapons. This lead to the question of calibre, then to the 
Vilani system of measures, then to the Vilani numbering system etc.

So just how do the Vilani do maths? Starting with the basics:

Vilani weights and measures
  From what I understand, most systems of weights and measures are 
based on real world units (the foot, pace, grain etc), length seems 
to be frequently tied to the human body. So what do the Vilani use?
Here I think we can virtually pick a conversion factor out of thin 
air and justify from there. The basic Vilani length should be based 
on something very fundimental. Most foods will be processed beyond 
reconginition, so I think we should stick to the human body. How 
about the base unit is derived from wraping cord from the base of the 
thumb to the elbow (roughly 850mm)? A little large but workable. As 
you wrap the cord, you mark time on the fingers of the hand giving a 
larger unit of 4.25m (850 X 5). Now the year on Vland is 500 day/nights, so 
lets take the 4.25m unit and multiply by 500 to give a large scale 
unit (2.125km) Divide the base unit by measuring using the span from 
thumb to forefinger, which works out again at roughly 5 times (giving 
a unit of 170mm). Now this unit can be subdivided by using the middle 
joint of the thumb, this is about 35mm; if we make it 34mm this gives 
another lot of 5. For a preindustrial society these units will do 
fairly well. Latter, more can be added, since 5 seems to come up so 
much, lets stick with with it (sub units of 6.8mm and 1.36mm appear 
sufficent).

I did mean thumb-elbow-thumb (as you wind the cord you mark off on 
your fingers). Using my 187cm frame, I get 880mm for one pass (you 
have to remember you\'re measuring the thickness of the arm as well).

That would make more sense I suppose. So if we take the base unit as 
the thumb-elbow-thumb length (hey somebody fancy asking Marc Millar 
to measure as a standard :*>), I got it from a mental image of a 
"tallyman" wrapping cord and chanting as he marked off on his fingers 
(hence the larger unit of 5 times that). However, if the Vilani use a 
base 10 system, it would make more sense for the "artifical" units 
to be decimal. So we have:

1 Daakuu (2.125km) = 500 Khaniimi
1 Khaniimi (4.25m) = 5 Edapu
1 Edapu (850mm) = 5 Amiran
1 Amiran (170mm) = 5 Shiig
1 Shiig (34mm) = 10 Ugdadu
1 Ugdadu (3.4mm) = 10 Rusakum
1 Rusakum (0.34mm)

[aside: I\'d plumb for the standard Vilani gun calibres being 5.1mm, 
6.8mm, 8.5mm and 10.2mm]

I suspect that you\'ll want to design smaller, independent hulls, then
attatch them together.  Maybe a cluster of spheres if using AG.

I would quess that a few stars in the Imperium will at any given time be

A million tons for a million people?
One ton per person?

Umm, isn\'t that going to be a bit crowded with
0.026 tons cargo per person?

I think you\'ve made a typo or left something out.  By starting with
1,000,000 tons that you list, and subtracting all the things you list
with volume, I get 0.63 tons per person.  Thats before subtracting
volume for helpar and contragrav drives, jump drive, power plant,
computers, small craft and hangars, airlocks, low berths, labs
and shops, fuel purifiers,  (you put scoops on a ship this big?),
and AG/Compensators.

Maybe if everyone inhales.

Well, those who act "reasonably" can\'t even be sure they are thinking
for themselves!  They\'ve already been co-opted.  No free-thinking
person could tolerate the situation where even your thoughts aren\'t
your own.  Psionicists destroy the personality for their own ends.
Without you even knowing it.  Like unseen parasites, they infest
and then warp your mind until you are nothing but a slave to your
psionic masters.  Only a vigorous and robust defense will keep them
at bay.  There can be no moderation.

That is essentially an Egyptian cubit.  The cubit was from the Pharaoh\'s

which should also be very close to the lengths of your foot.  Try it

Ok, each person masses about 75 kilos. Add 25 kilos for possesions.
That\'s 100 kilos right there.

Next, how are you going to "pack" the people? Staterooms? Double
occupancy staterooms? Bunk rooms? And you can\'t use "hot-bunking" for
colonists. And unless the planet is pretty totalitarian, even the
"bunks" will be organized into fairly small groups, segregated by sex,
and to some extent by age (really young kids with mother or father,
older kids in bunkrooms with others of their age, late teens and up in
the adult bunkrooms). I\'d figure 6-8 bunks per normal stateroom volume,
either with a \'fresher per bunkroom, or else big communal freshers (the
former being more likely than the later). 

For folks more used to crowding and less "private" (say Japanese), you
might have bunk rooms with hundreds of people and attached communal
facilities. This saves space, but increases the risk if the hull gets
punctured. 

For *really* callous governments, you use maximally crowded bunkrooms.
bunks 5 or 6 high, about 1 meter wide by 2 meters long, in long rows,
with about a meter between rows. For an example, check out the way
bunks were set up in concentration camps.

Next, you have to worry about tech level, in as much as it affects the
duration of the trip. That determines how much food you need. We can
assume that water is recycled on something this big. But food recycling
is out unless you are talking a trip years long. 

I used to have the figures for how much food a person needed per month.
If you have a copy, check Heinlein\'s "The Rolling Stones". It mentions
food, water and air requirements in passing. So do a couple of the
other juveniles. 

For water, assume 100 kg per person, that allows for washing drinking,
showers, and cleaning decks, tables, dishes, etc. And don\'t forget that
by the end of the trip, most of the food will have been converted to
water ( say 50% of the food mass). 

Fast drug might help. But regardless, this is going to be a *huge*
ship.

Actually, the *simplest* means of handling this is for each important
port to issue an "ID sequence" as part of the flight plan or as part of
issuing ships papers. This would be a *short* description of the ship,
plus a signature block, all encrypted with a public key cipher. Anybody
with the "published" key key can decrypt the block, getting a
description and the "signature". The signature had better matvh the
port\'s signature, and the description had better match the ship.

The trick is that you can\'t *generate* the encrypted info without
having the *private* key, which only the port authority has. And while
secure codes will require the highest available tech, the actual gizmos
for doing the encrypting decrypting should be fairly cheap. Something
even a low tech world can buy if they want to verify IDs. And, of
course, some won\'t *want* to (can you say "pirate haven"). 

This is equivalent to the codes and ciphers used in the 18th century
for ID purposes. And like them, it allows for all sorts of
skullduggery. Bribing officials, stealing codes, etc. All that fun
roleplaying stuff. :-)

No. It doesn\'t have an SF (Spontaneous Fission) decay mode. And there
are several other things that dense.

I think the planet would have *real* problems with heavy metal
contamination. Like Yeltsin in the Honor Harrington books, only
*worse*. It\'d make a great place for mining for some things. But the
folks living there will need some *strange* dietary supplements. Things
like aluminum, sodium, and potassium should be *really* rare. Ditto for
sulfur and chlorine.

In fact, I\'d guess that the planet spent a lot of time in an orbit
*closer* (relatively speaking) than Mercury, and then got knocked into
its present orbit by some fortuitous collisions late in the formation
of the system. Which means there ought to be a couple *mongo* "basins"
from the collisions. If it\'s low hydro, the seas will be in the bottom
of the basins, if medium to high, they\'ll be the major portions of the
oceans.

You see, this lets the less dense stuff get "baked" out. Then you get a
small amount of lighter material after the planet gets into the new
orbit. Thus the lack of lighter elements. 

I\'ve unearthed some old notes I made while trying to "design" a planet
far inside the orbit of Mercury. I basicly took the Earth, dumped it
into position, then checked to see what would boil away (the planet is
at something around 3247 C). And I figured that it\'d heat clear thru...

Here\'s a list of the solids and liquids....

Liquid, or maybe gas (properties not known well enough)
MgO ???
TaB2 ???
ThO2 ???
ZrB2 ???

Liquid:
BeO
B4C
Cr3C2

Solid:

I never got around to completing the calacs that would have given me
the relative proportions, and the total mass. But feel free to steal
the above for a nasty little planet. It\'d make a *wonderful* ore
deposit. The only problem is how to get at the stuff. :-)

Only way I can think of is to find a planet that got baked down to that
during the Red Giant stage of the star, and where the star quietly
burned down to a white dwarf, leaving this *dense* hunk of stuff frozen.

Hell, I had to give some *gay* friends a talking to after they started

Actually, the folks boarding ships for Customs inspections are going to
be the equivalent of the Coast Guard. Which means that they *will* be
concerned with safety. 

The way *I* would play this is that a ship with any "obvious" problems,
(like the stench mentioned) will get a quicky safety inspection.
They\'ll *probably* be willing to overlook things that don\'t affect the
ability to *control* the ship, as long as it\'s just the crew at risk.

Inability to control the ship properly will get them refused permission
to approach the planet. If the ship\'s boat checks out ok, they can use
*it* to shuttle themselves and cargo back and forth. If not, they\'ll
have to contact someone on-planet to run a shuttle for them. This is
because *nobody* wants a ship "falling out of the sky" on their planet.

And even life support problems will only be ignored to a point. Poor
filtration leads to the smells, but isn\'t life threatening (other than
long term toxicity). But if it looks like something could *fail* (thus
leaving them with only enough air for a few hours or less) they\'ll get
cited for that too, and that *will* require repairs before they are
allowed to leave the system.

Basicly, if the crew of the customs cutter can feel some sympathy, and
there doesn\'t seem to be a danger to the planet or to ships in the
vicinity, they\'ll let it go (and make jokes about it). 

If the crew pisses them off, or it looks like the ship could get into
trouble and thus either require rescueing, or pose a danger to others,
then they\'ll nail them.

Yep. A good one would be a breakdown in the water recycling gear. This
could range from having to ration water, to having to "hand" process
sewage. 

If anyone is *really* interested, I could try to work up some possible
failures and consequences for some life support systems. Heck, maybe I
should try writing my own version of "Starship Operator\'s Manual" and
related books.

One of the reasons for the ongoing debate about transponders seems to be
the notion that one black box is the basis for all decisions on the
legality of ship\'s operations. The debate then centers around confirming or
denying the information that is provided by the transponder.  [Walt, I\'m
not saying this is your position - you just gave the best lead-in.]  Other
than the omnipotent SDG-313F "Deyo Circuit" transponder, with connections
to all parts of the ship and total exchange of information on all aspects
of ship\'s operations, this is a lot to ask of a device that started out as
just a coded radio beacon.

In fact, the transponder is but one piece of a complex of paperwork and
records surrounding the day-to-day operations of a normal working
freighter.  How feasible you want piracy and skipping to be in your
universe is adjustable by varying how carefully this paperwork is checked,
and how far the information is shared.

Most freighters, even tramps (free traders, that follow no fixed schedule)
are going to send a list of projected portcalls ahead of themselves, to
drum up business.  Take a look at the London times in 1880 - the pages are
full of "The Mary Celeste will be docking at Portsmouth from Calais on the
10th instant, looking for cargos in need of a fast ship to Kingston in the
West Indies."  Even if the captain doesn\'t decide on the next stop until he
arrives and discharges cargo, he can still send a message a couple of days
ahead by a ship departing immediately while he waits to load.

Next, the ship carries a registry - her ID, if you will.  Like any good ID,
it carries a complete description, with dimensions, hold capacities,
numbers of staterooms, date of last annual maintenance, plus an identifying
picture.  In the here-and-now, a US merchant captain is required to
physically surrender the ship\'s registry to the US consul or shipping
commissioner when he arrives in port, and can\'t pick it up again until he\'s
cleared to leave.  Faking or altering a registry should be about as
difficult as convincingly forging a personal ID in your universe - one that
would stand up to official scrutiny for a week, say...

Third, every ship keeps a log.  Logbooks are a wonderful thing:  they tell
you where the ship has been, what it did there (complete with navigational
sightings and course corrections, communications sent and received, even
cargo and passenger manifests), and why.  Captains are going to keep good
logs for their own protection - come the day that you do have an accident,
your insurance underwriter is going to want to see all the dyas that you
didn\'t have an accident, when you made and logged all the required safety
checks, sensor sweeps, flight plans and STC clearances sent and received,
etc.  This convinces them that it was, in fact, an accident.  It also
covers the captain\'s butt if he has to, say, shoot a hijacker and stuff
them out the airlock in jumpspace, or turns off the transponder to avoid a
suspicious "freighter" in a low-tech backwater.  Again, it is possible to
fake a logbook, and probably every captain fudges an entry here and there -
but to do so consistently and well is the mark of genius.

Then there is the possibility of flight data recorders and cockpit voice
recorders.  I like these, but I understand that not everyone sees them as
necessary or desireable.  The point in their favor is that starships,
unlike their sea-going equivalents, take off and land like aircraft at very
high speeds and at centralized ports (defined by their Imperial extrality
limits, which will be as small as possible on most worlds).  The
possibility of a catastrophic accident is fairly high, enough to justify
the use of recorders.  Once you have them, they make a great check on the
excesses of a crew - how wild are you going to get, if you know that your
words are recorded for posterity if anything goes wrong?  Of course, there
are plenty of real-world crews that this didn\'t stop, so the black box need
not become Big Brother if you don\'t want it to.  But when correlated with
the ship\'s logbook and a simple transponder log of signals sent and
received, it becomes even more difficult to recreate the ship\'s past in
your own image - so much so, that I give my players a break and purge the
flight data recorder at each annual maintenance.  Some of their ships are
really well maintained...

I won\'t go into manifests (crew, passenger, and cargo), consular records,
health records, ship\'s accounts, or any of the other documentary evidence
that even the smallest ship will carry with her.  Suffice to say, if a ship
were to "lose" all her records ("EMP weapon on that missile - I\'m sure of
it!") she and her captain would be in for a long and detailed investigation
at the next Imperial port she touched down at, before the Imperial consul
would even consider issuing a new registry.

So, how do you know the S.S. Driven Snow you have is the correct one?  She
has log entries going back to her last annual maintenance listed on her
registry, that match both the transponder log and the flight data recorder,
and that correlate well with the occasional message on the commercial pages
about where she would be seeking cargo.  Her accounts show payments and
receipts for all the worlds she claims to have visited, and - the clincher
- - one of the manifests has the name of a guy you served with in the Navy,
that you knew always wanted to take a trip to Glisten.

If neccessary, assuming that ships with grossly inadequate paperwork are
rare, the Starport Authority could lease the ship sans crew for a couple of
months, putting it to work on some milk run. Once the paperwork clears,
then the owners have the ship back. If it doesnt clear, well, I guess it
gets sold at auction.

	Depends on the style and knife.

	Many sub-hilt knives (and those with finger grooves in grip)
	are intended solely for use in sabre grip position and are
	very awakward in other positions. This sabre grip is usually
	used in fencing position with leading knife-hand.

	While using double-edged blade I prefer quarter-sabre grip
	with leading knife-hand and lower fencing position. From
	quarter-sabre it is possible to make extremely fast and
	lethal thrust/rip attacks.

	With a Tanto I prefer the neko-stance with either straight
	grip with leading knife-hand or reverse blade and leading
	off-hand. In these positions (especially with reverse blade)
	the off-hand is used to check the arm of incoming knife-hand
	and guide it against my own blade.

	Some people prefer to wrap a leather jacket around the off-hand
	and parry with the jacket. (In earlier times knife-fighters
	used to wrap a cloak around the off-hand. This style was called
	"cloak and dagger".)

> The idea being one knife hit = mortal wound.

	In Tantojutsu the basic idea is to cause permanent, disabling
	damage as fast as possible and move to the next target. After
	the first succesful attack one should be able to disengage the
	opponents and leave him to die.

> For example, take someone trained in martial arts against someone

	The main problem in knife-fighting is that it is possible
	to make disabling or lethal damage with very little force.
	The knife-fighter will have advantage over martial artist
	since he can sacrifice strength for speed and still end the
	fight with first strike (and if the knife-fighter knows how
	to block with living blade, the first-and-last strike may be
	a one made by the martial artist).

> ... won\'t the martial artist be on equal footing with the trained
> knife fighter and have the advantage against the untrained knife

> such fighter.

	Unfortunately almost all anti-knife techniques I have seen
	are usable only against totally unskilled (and preferably
	bind and paralyzed) knife-fighter. Trained knife-fighters
	should know many of these disarming maneuvers and know what
	to expect. Additionally there are specific "invitation"
	maneuvers designed to lure the opponent to disarm the knife.
	A successful "invitation" usually ends when the disarmer has
	lost several fingers or is bleeding from wrist wounds.

The system was designed to catch snipers in an urban warfare enviroment.
You come accross a sniper, you but the sensors around the place, you get
the sniper to shoot something, and then you level the building with a
millan that is attached to the sensors.

I\'m not sure which armed forces it was designed for but probably the US.
The sensors were designed to discriminate, and only pick up gunfire.

Hmm.  Clinton\'s approval rating is 60%+ after Monday\'s release of

Reply-To: traveller@MPGN.COM

What do people use in their Traveller universes for money? Does
it exist in cash form in high tech societies? How do interstellar
travellers deal with electronic banking when they are travelling 
faster than the financial information needed to make such transactions?

I use some ideas I saw in White Dwarf magazine a long time ago
(when it was good, not just a house organ for Games Workshop)
involving hard to forge high-tech plastic coins, money chits and
plaques. The big black plaques are MCr1, the little white coins are
tenth-Cr (or less) up to Cr1, the chits go up to Cr100, larger plaques
go up from there. A well-secured attache case can carry
the purchase price of a starship, good the moment it is presented
at a shipyard with no wait while a bank two months away sends
approval. Better yet, people have something to steal when you
mug them...<g>

I also use Letters of Credit (an idea I got from the Knights Templar),
portable items of value like gems (an idea I got from SPI\'s wargame
_Freedom in the Galaxy_), and some credit cards.

Credit cards are most commonly used by the vast majority of people
who don\'t travel between the stars. They are also used by people who
don\'t travel far, or stay on the same routes (so their financial data
can keep up with them). The moment you get away from X-Boat routes,
your credit card becomes unreliable. A lower-tech world might not
be able to take it at all, and even the higher-tech startown 
establishment\'s reader might reject your card (not long enough on
planet, no previous recorded planetfalls, no records, etc). IMTU,
everyone carries cash. This may also be the reason, BTW, most
people seem to carry weapons as well...

An Example of high finance:

Ex-Merchant Captain Jed Furgall decides to buy a nice, new
Far Trader at Regina. He won the Monsterball Lottery Jackpot on Efate
last month, and he has a bank account in the First Bank of Efate
with MCr49 in it. Captain Furgall has no reputation as a swindler,
the news from Efate mentioned his newfound wealth, and he brought
a Letter of Credit from his bank on Efate to a bank (that knew the Efate
bank) on Regina. The Regina bank will extend him credit (which will
eventually be balanced by an electronic or even physical transfer
of wealth between the bank on Efate and the bank on Regina), he
can probably buy his starship today if one is sitting on the lot.

Many travellers wear rings, pendants and other small items of value
to use as a cash reserve. Those who travel frequently to primitive
planets often are quite encumbered by such trinkets, as they may
need to deal regularly with people who would rather barter than take
odd-looking pieces of plastic.

What does a fistful of credits look like IYTU?

>Subject: Money (longish)

Here\'s an extract from an article I compiled of what happens when you 
get in-system.  Some comes from people on the TML and some from a JTAS 
article.  I use this for money concerns with ships...

Greg

4.  Arranging Payments.  The ship will get a bill for berthing and 
inspection services, as well as any fines or fees for special cargos, 
use of loading/unloading equipment or crew (Union!), etc.  This will 
generally be charged against the ship\'s Account.  This may be a "cash" 
account at the local branch of the bank the characters use for their 
financial services (definitely for established trading companies on 
routes), an advance against an Imperial Credit Card (see below), or the 
ship may carry a letter of credit from the previous location.  Letters 
of credit are usually very difficult to forge, though if it is 
successfully forged, expect that the bank will likely catch up with the 
characters eventually.  The letter would be found in the SpA Packet 
(above).  The standard Imperial Credit Card may also be used to cover a 
bill.  

Also, ship payments are usually made at starports, in most cases 
electronically.  If a ship payment is due on 030-1107 and your ship is 
in port, the note holder will debit your account for the payment 
according to prior arrangements.  The ship\'s schedule becomes a matter 
of financial record also, and if your schedule says you were in 
jumpspace on the date payment was due, the bank will debit your account 
on the next possible date.  In all cases, your financial history and 
bank accounts will need to "follow you around" wherever you go.  Many 
schemes have been attempted to cheat the bank out of a payment or two, 
but most are detected and thwarted.  Banks are huge, networked bodies 
which keep duplicate records at every branch, and at affiliated banks.

As to cash, all ships carry some cash and generally draw petty cash 
against their accounts.  Some ships carry a lot of cash.  This may 
arouse suspicions, depending on the ship, and may generate unwanted 
inspections. 

Note: Most merchant ships carry a lot of cash, as do Mercenary Cruisers 
(in the form of CrImps, Corporate Bearer Bonds, Bank Letters of Credit, 
etc...).  Electronic credit is fine for a ship that just picks up cargo, 
but if one is speculating, you are paying cash on the barrel.  
Examples... 1) If you are running a route, you will meet your agent.  2) 
If you just pick up any cargo and passengers (standard rates) you can 
get away with advertising at the starport through the SpA.  3) If you 
are speculating, you might set up a meeting through a broker, or you 
will have to get out on the world and find the manufacturer or seller 
and verify the load.  Some of the larger brokerage houses will operate 
on  credit - but a small broker (i.e. Starport D-) will want and need 
liquid funds in order to facilitate the purchase.  And, as a starship 
owner, you want to know that a credit transfer will be accepted once 
it\'s validated at a major starport.  Cash is king.  Remember, Class D 
and E starports do not have the facilities of a Class A or B.

Note:  Hard currency is good for business, and can sometimes help bail 
you out of a difficult situation.  In every culture, there is an 
\'underground economy\' in illegal, unlawful, or simply unacceptable 
goods.  The Imperium has an interest in keeping this trade alive.  If 
its not done with Imperial currency it will be done with some other form 
of trade.  And as most adventurers know, you can\'t always count on the 
presence of an ATM when Guido the Killer Pimp is after you.  Sometimes 
you need cash so you can buy protection (a good slug-thrower) or your 
way out of a sticky encounter.

Note:  Imperial currency is great for high tech worlds, worlds with 
Class A or B starports, or worlds with a high Imperial presence 
(Sector/SubSector Capitals).  Get out onto the Starport E, TL-3 worlds 
though, and your Credit Card isn\'t going to do a lot of good.  Start 
dealing on the fringes of society, where it is important that a 
transaction NOT be traced, and cash becomes important.  Another good 
thing about cash is that you cannot void the transaction - once you have 
handed it over you have made a commitment that can be depended on.  Try 
and guarantee a mercenary contract with a charge card, or even a Credit 
Card, for instance, and you may find yourself in a bit of trouble.

Imperial Credit Cards and Banking or A Study in Currency:   Hard 
currency is necessary in the traveller universe for many reasons, a main 
one of which is complex communications.  In today\'s world, money can be 
transferred electronically between accounts, credit cards and such.  A 
"debit card" is all one really needs these days to purchase something.  
But, in the traveller universe, it is much more difficult to maintain 
interstellar bank accounts.  For example, if one were on Agidda/Sol-Rim 
and had an account on Terra/Sol-Rim (in the 1st Terra World Bank), you 
would have to wait 2 weeks to get large amounts of cash  (1 week jump to 
Terra to verify funds, 1 week back to Agidda).  Bookkeeping is a 
nightmare.

The largest financial institutions (Subsector and Sector institutions) 
maintain facilities on worlds with Class A and B starports.  An office 
can usually be found on worlds with Class C or D starports.  Financial 
data for these institutions is constantly updated through the x-boat 
network and data packets on ships with mail contracts.  Most firms have 
banking accounts with appropriately sized financial institutions.  Small 
trading firms (fledgling, interface, sub-sector lines) usually have 
accounts with several world banks or with the Subsector-wide 
institutions.  They would have letters of credit or separate accounts 
within the next Subsector.  Sector-wide lines and some Sub-sector lines 
have accounts with the Sector-wide institutions.  Megacorporations have 
accounts with the Sector-wide institutions and with Hortelez et Cie.  
Most megacorporations don\'t need letters of credit when dealing with 
Subsector or smaller institutions.

The bookkeeping problems are pretty much solved when you carry the 
Imperial Credit Card (Don\'t leave your ship without it--it\'s everywhere 
you want to be!).  Most Free Traders and wealthy individuals carry the 
Imperial Credit Card.  Most ship captains carry the Imperial Credit Card 
for ready access to cash.  The Imperial Credit Card is similar to a cash 
card, but instead of the card accessing an established local account, 
the financial data is physically stored on the card.  The card is 
actually a portable bank teller.  It contains a micro-processor unit 
which keeps track of the account contained, and solves the problem of 
having to report back to the bank the account balance status.  These 
Credit cards (as opposed to charge cards) are accepted at virtually any 
Class A or B starports and businesses at high tech worlds (TL 13+).  The 
Traveller\'s Aid Society accepts the Credit card at all its facilities 
throughout the Imperium for cash advances and other services.  Money can 
be transferred electronically in-system, between ships or between a ship 
and the starport for example.  Hard cash is still necessary for areas 
that don\'t except or have the ability to accept Credit cards.  One 
disadvantage to lower Tech Level Credit Account-type cards was 
tampering.  Individuals in some instances were able to "hack" into the 
card and increase the amount of money it contained.  Later developments 
made this kind of tampering a thing of the past.  Tampering requires at 
least an individual with Electronics-5 and Forgery-3, not to mention the 
millions of credits worth of rare electronic equipment.  Credit cards 
now blank themselves out or post a warning should an attempt be made to 
tamper with the contents.  Wealthy individuals, and most ship captains 
have multiple Credit cards and accounts should one card be stolen or 
disrupted.  A recent Credit Card study revealed it is easier to 
counterfeit hard currency and paper money than to hack a card. 

Additional Details: 

The ICC contains a thumb-print actuator.  Within is also contained a 
record of owner\'s retina print which is required for verification on all 
major (over Cr100,000) transactions with the card.  The cards a issued 
with variable "Credit" limits, usually 1,000 - 10,000 for local users, 
and Cr25,000, Cr50,000, Cr100,000, Cr250,000 and Cr500,000 for ship 
captains/travellers.

The iridium edition of the ICC is available only to millionaires and 
contains the owner\'s DNA code allowing for positive identification and 
practically unlimited reliability of credit.  Even starships have been 
purchased with this edition card.

The Traveller\'s Aid Society issues, for a modest Cr10,000 lifetime fee, 
a similar TAS services card.  Zirunkarish (the banking megacorporation) 
charges a 1% fee which is deducted upon "crediting" for both editions of 
the card.

The cards are made of plasteel and are virtually indestructible.  The 
loss or accidental destruction of these cards can be somewhat of an 
administrative hassle.  When a loss is reported, the responsible 
financial institution issues a credit update notice which goes out over 
X-boat carrier or other mail couriers.  Steps are taken locally to 
minimize financial loss.  Each bank sets  individual limits on liability 
of a lost or stolen card.

The card with its transaction information is useless until the process 
of verification is complete.  This is based upon the span of use for the 
card in the user\'s transaction history.  If the transaction records 
support the lack of extensive travel in recent times, the process of 
account verification is relatively quick.  If records support extensive 
travel by the card-holder, the process of verification takes longer.  
[In any event, the verification process time is equal to approximately 
three times the normal communications time across the established area 
of travel, the Imperium being the maximum region of access.  The maximum 
period of verification in the Imperium is 7 years.

Hexidecimal people.  Base F.  1-F.

That\'s the case when developing UPPs.  If that\'s the base, then, when 
you count, what do you call "B"?  How about "B" + "B"?

So does:

A= "Aten"   or  "Aye"
B= "Beten" or  "Bee"
C= "Seeten" or "See"
D= "Deten" or  "Dee"    
E= "Eeten" or  "E"
F= "Feten" or  "Ef"

Then, "10" or "ten" should be F+1, "11" should be F+2, thirteen should 
be F+4, right?

Should "Twenty" be (F+1) * 2?  So you should have numbers like 2A, which 
in base 10 would be a quantity of....44?.  Starships cost a lot more in 
Hexidecimal....

I\'m tired of thinking about it.  I\'ll stay decimal...

I agree completely. If the knife-wielder has the weapon out, and you don\'t, and he\'s
that close, you\'re wasting valuable time going for your weapon. Better to use your
bare hands.

I practise Jiu-Jitsu, and we have moves designed to counter knife attacks from your
average yokel. Most of the time it\'s a straightforward procedure, because the guy will
lead with the knife hand. As you pointed out, a well-trained knife fighter will save
his knife for when he can inflict a single, decisive strike. No matter how good an
unarmed person is at martial arts, I\'d place the bet there on the serious knife

Ookaay! Let\'s all remember not to make Antti angry. ;-)

Seriously though, this leads me to a point I\'ve been
wrestling with for about a month now. Has anyone considered
modifying damage done by melee weapons based on the skill
level of the wielder? It seems to me that a high skill level
would not only allow the highly skilled character to make a
higher chance of making a successful attack but could also
allow the attack to be more effective.

Any thoughts on this, anyone?

That\'s specific impulse, 3100 seconds at peak power (92 mN/2.3 kW) and 
1900 seconds at minimum power (20 mN/0.5 kW).  The ion drive is more
efficient at high power than at low.  They mention elsewhere that they
could increase thrust more with a larger solar panel, but this would be
at the cost of increasing vehicle mass of course.

If I remember right, this means a kilogram of fuel provides 9.8 N of 
thrust for 3100 seconds; or 10 grams of fuel provide 98 mN of thrust
for 3100 seconds; that\'s about 10 grams of fuel providing full thrust
for an hour.  At 82 kg of xenon fuel for the ion drive, we get about
8200 hours (342 days) duration at full thrust.

A task system should not only check for success or failure, it should also
measure the degree of success/failure and the probabilities of exceptional
success/spectacular failure should depend on task level vs skill. Then it
is easy to make rules for exceptional success giving more damage no matter
if it came from easy task (target asleep), high skill or just luck.

Use MT task system but change the level of an exceptional success to say +5
above the required roll (instead of +2 as was the case if I remember
correctly).
An exceptional success might let the attacker roll damage twice and take
the highest and marginal success might roll twice and take the worst.

Dunno about that. However, one of my kids today coverted 12 feet into a
yard! 

It seems to have taken most of a generation to change in Canada.  Some
parts still haven\'t totally, especially where Imperial units are simpler
because of pre-existing conditions. For example, land surveyed in sections
means farmers still talk in section, because the numbers are simpler. Mind
you, they also use hectares as well. Many of my generation mix-and-match
units, often in the same measurement ("I\'ll take an inch to four
centimeteres, please.").

Somewhere in my 20s I lost my \'feel\' for Imperial units, and now have to
convert to metric before things make sense. SO I guess repeated use has
converted me. (Plus not having to do compound addition!)

Actually, weights and measures have differed quite a bit throughout
history, and they do evolve. A Roman mile is not the same thing as an
Imperial mile (although I think that an Imperial mile and an American mile
are the same thing).

A classic example is the American gallon. At the time of teh American
Rebellion, Britain had at least two gallons. The American colonial
merchants started using the smaller wine gallon for everything (not just
wine) - incidentally concealing a price increase.

Hm...people should bear in mind how _large_ a traveller ton is.  If we assume
.3 meters between decks and .2 meters between walls and a clearance of 2
meters, we get a room which is roughly 2 meters high x 2 meters wide x 2.8
meters long; given that we are packing people in, we can do a floor setup with
two bunks at each end (each one has .8 meters of clearance above it, and is .9
meters wide), low drawers (4 per side, each 1m x .9 meters x .2 meters) beneath
the lower bunk, and a one meter wide walkway between beds.  If you\'re willing
to be really excessive add a half-meter deep set of shelves between the beds,
this still leaves a 1.5 meter x 1 meter open space in the middle of the room,
and gives a total of 2.44 cubic meters of stowage in the room.  0.61 cubic
meters of storage will allow an ordinary person to store around 200 kilograms
of personal gear, which is plenty (compared to some modern ships, particularly
submersibles, this is spacious).  Tossing in narrow corridors (figure slightly
over a meter wide, with rooms on both sides) we increase the volume of the room
by about a third -- which means that in our stowage area we are storing 3
people per displacement ton, and the waste space I specify around rooms is
sufficient to easily account for life support requirements.

Now, if we\'re willing to drop down to 2 people per displacement ton, we have an
additional 3.5 m^3 per person.  We will use this in part for a mess room
(assume shifts, no more than 1/4 of people are in the room at a time) with a
total of 7 m^3 per occupant (gives about 3 m^2 floor space per occupant, of
which about 1 m^2 is for the food preparation area) plus an exercise area with
similar size.

This isn\'t exactly _comfortable_, but it\'s believable for transporting people
for some weeks, and would seem roomy to people on sailing ships from before the
late 19th century.
Now, we add in a mess room (figure 2 m^3 per person) 
Now, add in half this volume in \'open space\', primar

That\'s fairly easy.  There will be zero effect on fusion reactors unless
there\'s enough power to vaporize the ship.  There will be no significant effect
on fission reactors unless the neutron flux is sufficient to kill the entire
crews within hours, and even then the only effect will be some slight increase
in temperature, possibly with an automatic shutdown via insertion of cooling
rods.

When fighting an experienced bladesman (Note: some people only regard
bladesmen as persons who are experienced in the use of pointy objects 6" or
longer, who have portions of their living area devoted to the care and
maintenance of said pointy objects, or who devote large portions of their
spendable income in the pursuit of said objects.  I personally say that if
you can whittle a branch without drawing your own blood - you qualify.), I
generally prefer to use a rifle.  The range can be as short as, say, from
across the street, but I would really prefer it to be from the top of a
large building.

Some would say that artillery barrages or B-52 strikes are the only suitable
defense against a truly competent bladesman.  While there is merit in that
position, especially when the person in question is versed in a any of the
martial arts, there are too many historical precedences for individuals to
come through these events, largely unharmed (Note: some would say that
\'versed\' means the person has received years of training.  I OTOH take the
position that if you have ever watched a Jackie Chan movie, you are too
dangerous to live.)  I personally believe that by taking the simple
precaution of not warning the potential aggressor of the upcoming conflict,
a heavy machine gun should be more than adequate.  Remember to always check
your opponent for signs of life before you leave, preferably with the 9mm
pistol.  Often, your opponent may have surrounded himself with others, which
can hamper this vital life sign check.  I find that grenades will often
supply a suitable distraction, especially when the event in question is a
wedding, birthday party, baptism or school play.

For the inexperienced knife-fighter, and whatever witnesses that may be
accessible, a shotgun is suitable.

If I should find myself with the prospect of facing a gunmen, my preferred
weapon would be mercenaries.

Survival Margin (pg 69-70) says the transponder system has full access to the
comm system.  First, they needed to be "frequency agile" and used whatever
comm system or frequency was currently needed and not otherwise in use.  They
are constantly broadcasting and receiving information when in normal space.
The "squawk" is for the benefit of the ships crew, and it gives the details
and particulars of the broadcasting vessel.  Two, the transponder system also
had full acess to and from the ships main computer core and databanks.

You know...this is _exactly_ why the Imperium came up with the
semi-sentient Deyo chip transponders. These transponders will happily
chatter on to each other..."Oh yes and last week they took me out of the
"Shelbourne", that merchant that disappeared, and put me here, so I\'m
supposed to tell you I\'m the "Shelbourne" but this ship is really the
"Tommy Loy", and the original captain, Old Eneri, skipped on the
payments in 986 and sold me to Captain Bligh, who hasn\'t had annual
maintence in three years, and..."

They were unforgeable, because no one but the Imperium had a supply of
deyo chips, and those were taught, not programmed.  99% of this chatter
was just the chips talking to each other to keep themselves up to date. 

While with lots of creative programming, wiring (and a dump of the
Shelbourne\'s main data banks) you could transplant an ersatz copy of the
"Shelbourne" into the Shelbourne\'s transponder\'s \'reality\' space, making
it think it _was_ still the Shelbourne, but that would be a lot of work,
and the transponder would still know that it was shut off for a period
of time not scheduled in the Shelbourne\'s main computers. A far more
delicate sort of operation would be to make the cutover unnoticed by the
transponder...

A lot depends on how much memory is allocated to the deyo chip within
the sealed transponder box. At Deyo transponder TL\'s a heck of a lot of
memory could be in there. 

Of course, this is a presupposing that you actually knew that the
transponder was anything but a relatively sophisticated \'squawk-box\'. 
IIRC the true nature of the Deyo transponders was a rather closely
guarded secret.

Of course, there\'s the flip side to this...to keep the nature of the
deyo chips secret, you can\'t use 90% of the information you could get
out of them, much like Britain\'s quandaries with the Ultra data duroing
WWII. As the Ultra group got better and better at decoding Enigma
ciphered messages, it got harder and harder to use the intel without
giving away that they\'d broken Enigma. A standing rule was that any
intel shared widely had to appear to have come from other sources such
as live assets, or en-clair radio intercepts. 

They went to great lengths to hide the true source of stuff they gave
the US for instance, so much so that for years after the war, (until
Ultra was declassified, in fact) the british were credited for having a
far better live intelligence apparatus in Europe than they actually did.
In fact, the majority of operatives on the ground in Europe were
captured within a short time. IIRC the operational (and real lifespan,
in most cases) lifetime of ground agents was measured in days and weeks.
The Nazis had a very efficient network of radio DF stations that could
pinpoint radio transmissions in a relatively short period of time.

I agree with this.  I tried to present a less obviously extreme view in
my "Psionics & Society: Right of Reply" article (July 97), but even so
someone praised me for making it sound like an anti-Semitic rant (which
wasn\'t my intention)!  It\'s very difficult to come up with reasonable-
sounding arguments for a position you oppose, which is a shame because
it\'s the very rationality of these arguments that make them much more
dangerous...

If anybody wants to see the article, mail me.  If anyone has some
*properly reasoned* arguments against psionics, please post them - the
pro-psionic bias in the book (and in the way I presented my article,
unfortunately) is obvious, which isn\'t how things always work in real
life.

[Incidentally, I rate PI my third-favourite Imperium Games product,
 behind Pocket Empires and Milieu 0 Campaign.]

PSIONIC INSTITUTES CHECKLIST
John G. Wood

This is a checklist for Psionic Institute generation, including a few
ideas of my own.  New or modified stages are marked with a *.  As
always, GM fiat should be used instead of random rolls whenever desired.

All page numbers refer to Psionic Institutes, which is required to make
use of this.


WORLD DETERMINATION:

 1.   Pick a world, or roll up a UWP.

 2.   Roll 2D-2 for UAP (pp.15-16).

*3.   If Pocket Empires is available, determine Plurality of Opinion:

        (2D + Unity - Self-Determination + 8) / 2

      This gives a result in the range 0 to 19.

        0-3:   Almost everybody agrees with the UAP.
        4-6:   There are a number of minority groups with differing
               opinions, but they have little influence or popular
               support.
        7-10:  Different pressure groups represent a wide range of
               opinions.
        11-13: The population is severely divided on the issue of
               Psionics.
        14+:   There is almost no agreement.  The UAP represents at best
               an average, but is likely to vary depending on the survey
               methods used.

*4.   Determine presence of Psionic Institutes (p.17).  Roll 2D for each
      type (Commercial, Educational and Government Institutions, plus
      Secret Societies) and compare against the target number in the Law
      Level/UAP Matrix.  Modifiers to target number:
        CI or EI: +1 if HiPop, -1 if LoPop.
        GI:       +1 if Government type A+.

      Note the margin of success for each type found to exist (for
      example, rolling 3 against a target number of 5 yields a margin of
      2).

*5.   Determine the number of Institutes.  For each type of Institute
      represented on the world, roll 2D and add the margin:

           -7:  1 Institute.
         8-12:  2 Institutes.
        13-15:  1D+1 Institutes.
        16-19:  1D+2 Institutes.
          20+:  2D+1 Institutes


INSTITUTE DETERMINATION:

 6.   Generate the UID and Specials (pp.18-20):

   a. Student Population Digit (SP, p.18).  Roll 2D-7+UWP Population
      Digit and consult the table.

   b. Student to Instructor Rating (IR, p.18).  Roll 2D + 3 - SP.
      Modifiers:
        CI: -2
        EI: +1
        SS: +2
      Limit to range 0-10.

   c. Amenities Rating (AM, p.18).  Roll 2D -2.  Modifiers:
        CI: -2
        GI: -1
        EI: +1
      Limit to range 0-10.

   d. Overall Quality (QI, p.19).  Roll 2D - 5 + [(IR+AM)/2].
      Modifiers:
        CI: -2
        EI: +2
        SS: +2
      Limit to range 0-15 and consult the table.


*  e. Special Ability.  Roll 2D.  On a 12, the Institute teaches a
      special ability - roll one die twice on the Special Ability Matrix
      (p.22) to determine which.

*  f. Number of Departments (ND, p.19).  Roll 1D - 1.  Modifiers:
        CI: -2
        EI: +2
        SS: -1
      If the Institute teaches a Special Ability, a roll of 0 or less
      means it is the only ability taught.  Otherwise, limit to range
      1-5.

      Roll one die ND times on the discipline table.  Modifier:
        CI: -1

   g. Quality of Individual Departments (p.19).  Roll 2D for each
      existing department.  Don\'t forget the Special Ability Department
      if one exists.  Modifiers:
        CI: -1
        EI: +1
        SS: -2
      Limit to range 2-12 and consult the rating table.

 7.   Determine tuition cost (p.21).  Roll 2D + QI -2.  Modifiers:
        CI: +1
        GI: -1
      Limit to range 0-15 and consult the table.  Note: applicants with
      Admin skill will pay less (minimum Cr10,000).

*8.   Determine number of campuses.  Look up the appropriate type and
      SP, and roll 2D.  A roll of equal to or lower than the number on
      the matrix indicates more than one campus. A "----" indicates
      combinations that don\'t exist, or that are always confined to a
      single campus.

        Type/SP Matrix:
             SP0  SP1  SP2  SP3  SP4  SP5  SP6
        ----
         CI  ----   6-   7-   8-   9-  10-  11-
         EI  ----  ----   2-   3-   4-   5-   6-
         GI  ----   3-   4-   5-   6-   7-   8-
         SS  ----   4-   5-   6-   7-  ----  ----

      If more than one campus is found to exist, add 1D to the amount by     
      which the roll succeeded:

          1-4:  2 campuses.
          5-6:  1D+1 campuses.
          7-8:  1D+2 campuses.
         9-10:  2D+1 campuses.
        11-13:  1D*5 campuses.
        14-15:  2D*5 campuses.

 9.   Write Institute History.

10.   Write Institute Physical Description.

11.   Determine Notable Faculty Members.
- -8<----

Hope its useful to someone - I\'m not entirely happy with the method of
determining number of institutes/number of campuses, but what the
heck...

The I don\'t agree.  Even many of those who opposed the change saw that
there was some justification (but felt is wasn\'t worth the trouble).
(I think, in Canada, the idea that it would also help set them apart
from the US also helped :-).  It was a policy that had implimentation
at most levels of government.

The rule of man sometimes consisted of no more than one lone Terran
leutenant showing up to rule an entire system.  He then has the
entire population retool their entire industry for no real good
reason?

And infrastructure that is only a fraction of the size of the Vilani
Empire.  Suppose we wanted to have everyone in the world drive
on the same side of the road?  Would the entire world switch to
to driving on the left to match Japan and England?  Or would
it be the other way around?

Not true.  But the point that they are also replaced completely is
another source of change.  There is not a single unit of measurement
today that is the same as it was even _one_ melennium ago, let along
several.

As a trained sniper, I\'d shoot one guy, then move and pick off the troops
setting up the sensors.  Also, I\'d carry a long string of firecrackers to
confuse the issue.  Also, snipers don\'t hang around large concentrations of
enemy soldiers for long.  We\'ll take one or two shots, try to take out a
leader, then move to our next firing position.

Contrary to Hollywood, snipers rarely climb trees or hide in church
steeples.  Those locations, while providing excellent visibility, are damn
hard to get out of when you are located, and plunging shots are the
hardest.  You\'ll be more likely to find a sniper shooing from a basement
window or coal chute.

>I\'m not sure which armed forces it was designed for but probably the US.

The Redwood City, Ca, Police Department ran a test of the system a few
years ago.  The system couldn\'t distinguish between cars backfiring and gun
shots.  After several thousand false alarms, the test was cancelled.

A more promising system is a low-powered radar that tracks bullets back to
their point of origin.  Link that to a minigun.  Pureed Sniper.

Not necessarily.  The "Tueller Drill" (which is what Erwin is describing)
demonstrates that, on average, an attacker with a knife can close 7m
and attack in ~2.0 sec.  It takes an armed defender ~2.5 sec. to
recognize the threat, draw a concealed sidearm, and fire 2 shoots.
(This, of course, assumes the defender is well-trainied.)

As a trained firearms instructor, my personal response time is ~2.2 sec.
If I use a Bill Jordan "Speed Rock", I can consistantly get my time
below 2.0 secs.  (The "Speed Rock" involves drawing and firing from
the hip, with the arm locked tightly against the body, rather than
raising the arm to eye-level and using the sights.)  Since an attacker
is almost at contact distance by the time the sidearm is ready, using
the "Speed Rock" and sacrificing a sight-picture is not much of a
handicap.

Clearly, if a person is less qualified with a firearm, and has some
moderate skill in a martial art or some form of hand-to-hand combat,
it might be better to not attempt a weapon draw at all.  However, with
proper training, and *CONSTANT* practice, it can be done.

BTW, for those of you that are handgun shooters, here\'s a way to test
whether our not you can beat the knife wielder.  (Get two friends to
help you with this.)

Go to your local outdoor pistol range and set up one human silhouette
target at 7 meters.  Give one friend a whistle and have the other
friend stand 7 meteres away from you on the firing line, on your
"off" side (the side away from your holstered sidearm.)

                               [--] Silhouette target
                                 |
                                 |
                                7m
                                 |
                                 |
   ---- Firing Line
                               you
        friend2<----7m---->
                       friend1 w/ whistle

Make sure your sidearm is concealed (wear an open coat or sweatshirt
that hangs over the holster and hides it.

Without warning, the first friend blows the whistle.  The second friend
begins running towards you while you draw and shoot the target.  If
your second friend manages to tap your off shoulder before you have
fired, you\'ve just been "knifed".

This brings up the point of how systems with higher tech neighbors can
protect themselves from counterfeiting. Just a small tech level difference
makes a very big difference.

You land on the tech level 7 world, go out and trade for some local
"dollars" and take them back to your ship where you have a tech level 9
high-quality color photocopier...

I suspect some worlds actually have their currency production outsourced
to higher tech neighbors to stop this. Or they have the nearest Imperial
Mint provide them with Imperial Cr for local use and discontinue the local
currency altogether. Either way, you have to move the goods.

Imagine a 100ton cargo hold full of crisp new Cr100 notes...  ;)

Exactly.  lol.  Well put. : )  Of course, I don\'t think it\'s possible to

Yeah, and it was impossible to "fake the funk."  A chip could always tell
whether it was chatting w/ another chip or not.

Hmm... I\'m not so sure.  Shutting off or disconnecting the transponder box
from either the main computer or the communications circuits caused the tamper
circuit to fire and reduce all of the chips to slag.  The question is would it
be possible for the tamper circuit to fail?  It was supposed to have an
integrity monitor that detected any breach in the container or operations.
Losing access to commo or the computer would be obvious to the transponder.
Trying to explain why you disconnected your transponder (thus destroying it)
would be most interesting. : )  Even if satisfactory, expect to pay for a new
one. 

Military ships had an of-off switch to the commo systems (for sending).  Their
transponders could always read but just not broadcast, if set to off.  Of
course, this does conflict w/ DGPs "lying" transponders, but DGP also had a
half-Vilani Cleon and lathanum hull grids...

It was supposed to be "completely unknown to the public."   High nobility can
probably find out virtually any piece of information they care to look up, but
others?  It would be restricted to a "need to know."  The people building the
black boxes, the Emperors private intelligence network, etc etc.  Of course,
IAI knew, as did SolSec.  It would be possible for someone to put the pieces
together, but very unlikely IMO.
And even this knowledge would require the knowledge and ability to breed the
chips.  It took the Imperium quite awhile to do just that and that was
unopposed.

those the lasers miss.  IMO now government that has spent in excess of half
a trillion dollars on a ship would send it out with less than a full fleet
unit.  I hope this addresses most of the complaints about the earlier

spend several months with 999,999 other people.  I do not care how good you

YMMV.  Especially if you don\'t talk to a statistically significant number
of
people throughout the relevant populations.

Ob Trav.:  Would polls be relevant at all on an interstellar scale?

Cannon height of decks is, IIRC, 3 meters.  Using 1.5 meter squares,
a Traveller ton is 2 squares long, 1 square wide, and 2 squares wide,
or 4 1.5m^3 cubes.

A Low Berth from FFS2 takes up 1 ton in volume (person inside).
Thus, this ship cannot pass FFS2 muster at one million tons for
one million people.

Actually Stuart I\'d like to say that I think you took just the right
approach to this. In the M:0 period I think the anti-psi\'s should be a
small, militant group of rabid fanatics. In that way the majority of the
population would look on them as "nutcases" and pretty much dismiss them and
their efforts. For example the neo-Nazi\'s and KKK in the US today.

It\'s when the majority develope a less outspoken, sort of undercurrent
resentment of a group (or groups)  that things like the Suppressions
develope.

Again to equate this to modern times, this is something like I see of the
larger portions of the US populations reaction to Affirmative Action
polocies. The polocies, and the people they were intended to help, in and of
themselves are a GOOD thing, but whenever a minority receives "special
treatment", more  subtle resentment grows among a larger portion of the
population until someone(s) comes along to galvanize that seed into larger
action.

This is the route taken in Nazi Germany, where a majority developed the
impression (real or illusionary) that a minority held the power and money.
It then became easy to feed that small flame into a larger fire and call for
a "rational readjustment" that, as in so many case, swung the too far in the
opposite direction.

Upon re-reading this I see a lot of flame bait here. For that I apologise
and publicly state that it is not my intention to insult any minority group,
nor am I making a statment for or against Affirmative Action. I am stateing
views developed from observations, and are only my own opinions. Comments as
related to Traveller are welcome, and in that context references to Real
World (tm) as well. Attempts to debate current politics in and of themselves
will be ignored, THIS IS NOT THE FORUM FOR THAT.

Yes! for a mere 1.18 Million Megacredits you and 999,999 of your closest
personal friends can sleep your way to a brave new world many parsecs away.

One jump 3 and 60 days duration are accounted for in one tank of fuel.  The
cutters gather fuel for the ship to refine onboard, but it takes a week to
completely refine the full fuel tank.  I don\'t imagine this ship to be in
too big a hurry, and bigger plants take space.

The vast majority of the crew are medical personnel for "waking the dead"
at the end of the journey.  There are more medics on this ship than there
are med students in most U.S. Universities!  I would imnagine that this
would constitute an excuse for some quantity of learning nad teaching.

200 modular cutters provide transportation for colonists and refueling for
the ship.  over 600,000 tons of cargo space should be ample for each
colonists "allowance" plus a significant amount of requisite equipment and
spares, hopefully.  It will take quite some time for the stuff to be
transported down in only 200 cutters (200 times ~25 tons of cargo each =
5000, requiring over 100 trips just for the cargo).  Also, that 5000 tons
could be used for addition cargo (but it better be what\'s needed first!).

The vessel itself can\'t land and can\'t self refuel, but unlike others I
think there should be some integral self-defense capability.  600 triple
beam lasers for anti missile defense and 600 sandcasters are intended to
hold off small fleets of hostile vessels.

A good sensor suite is included due to the frontier nature of the likely
destinations.



I agree with some others in that this approach may not be the right way to
go, so I tried again and ended up with this;

This vessel would be used in large numbers in a similar way to the much
larger vessel above.  It is 1/100th the size and 1/100th the capacity in
all ways.  It is 2/100ths the cost, which means its about double the total
purchase price to transport the same number of colonists, reflecting the
economies of scale inherent in the larger craft.  Likewise the crew of 100
of these would be roughly double the crew of one of the "Staten Islands",
although cargo is actually tripled in the smaller ship.

On the other hand, when all the passengers are delivered, this craft can be
used to carry conventional cargo and regular passengers with a minor refit.
The Staten Island can too, but how many worlds (under canon rules) can fill
a 4 million ton ship with cargo? (then again, how many can fill a 40,000
ton ship?)

Depending on distance, you might also decide multiple trips with the "North
End" are better than one with the "Staten Island".

The other advantage of the "North End" is the ability to land.  Of course,
I could have designed the "Staten Island" to be able to land, but where
would it?  (answer "anywhere it wants to").  I feel that it is easier and
more practical for a 40,000 ton vessel to land than it would be for a 4
million ton.  Its a practical matter of finding flat ground or open water
near the desired destination.

That\'s classic, and is really a square 5\' * 5\' * 10\' high.  It doesn\'t really

This wasn\'t an argument about traveller-legal (though the world tamers handbook

     I agree that a characters skill should also factor into the amount of
damage able to be inflicted with a weapon.  A novice might by accident
score a very successful/damaging hit, but someone trained to be lethal
should have more chance of high damage than that novice.  The same applies
to gun combat in a way.  Someone trained as an expert marksman will hit
more often than someone who is a novice and will also hit targets in more
damaging places.  I think the penalty for called shots (aiming) should be
lowered by a fraction of the characters gun skill.  Otherwise you marksman
will hit more often than you novice, but only in location decided upon by
the roll of a die.

from ship design reflect the number needed for a single shift or "around the

others handle this.

On a small trader it doesn\'t matter, but on a large military ship I would
assume a 3 shift rotation with at least enough crew to maintain each shift
(not counting frozen watch).

What would a skeleton crew be? One half of the number or work stations
listed for the operation (i.e. manuver, engineering, etc), three quarters,
full shift?

Looks nice.  Just for the record though, I worked up 
something for PE not PI. It was submitted to IG for 
possible print and dist at Gencon, but I never saw anything 
come of it... which is probably for the best because 
despite my efforts, I still managed to miss a formula or 
two. Perhaps if I have time, I\'ll dig it back up, fix it 
and give it to someone to put up on a webpage.

You\'re obviously reading a long-not-updated version of the FAQ.

I remember the great pains I had to go to to explain picas (1/12th of an inch) to

I was trained as a printer when they still had their own very arcane units 
(points, ems, ens, type high, picas etc) and they are basically Imperial units 
(except type high which relates to nothing else). These units survived into the 
80\'s, but they were some of the last hold overs and they only survived that long 
because the machinery that used them survived. When those presses finally 
wore out, the units were no longer needed.

They changed, they did not \'evolve\'. The Roman mile did not gradually get 
longer and slowly become the Imperial mile, the unit got redefined effectively 
making it a new unit with the same name (the change occured sometime in the 
8th century in England. The pace did not gradually get longer and become the 
yard/metre/arshin etc, it got replaced (aside, the pace survived as a unit of 
measure in the Hapsburg Empire until after the First World War).

Yes but its wasn\'t an evolution, it was a redefinition.

What you have to do is make it look like a power failure or ship
shutdown. That shouldn\'t make the self destruct circuits fire.

This isn\'t actually ceiling height, it\'s floor to floor height,
including all the intervening ductwork, pipes, wiring, etc between
decks. this usually translates to somewhere between 2 and 2.5 meter high
living spaces, depending an what\'s going on underfoot (or overhead as
the case may be.)

You don\'t need 3 meter high decks even if you include ducting/etc, though the
result is somewhat claustrophobic if you don\'t, and halving more than a half
meter of \'stuff\' between decks (where the volume for the \'stuff\' is not already
being counted against the volume of some other subsystem) is probably
excessive.

	No, it will never hit 1G, it will always be 0.0001G. Speed and
acceleration are two completely different things--a ten thousand fold
increase in speed doesn\'t affect the acceleration.

	OK, ok, I know nothing is "un..."--I debated using tamper-resistant
but it weakened the point I was making. I\'ve been over this before,
and you can very easily make some assumptions about the
*characteristics* of technology available (without defining the
technology) that make near-foolproof transponders possible. A while

20th century technology.

	Actually, ALL ships had an on/off switch--since pirates are
canonical, the Imperium allowed you to try to hide ... However, you
better have a very good explanation the first time an IN cruiser
checks your transponder.

	Actually, I\'ve always counted the volume of the "stuff" as being
included in the volume of the various systems. Thus, if you\'ve got 14
cubic meters of jump drive, the actual machinery is part of that, as
is the access space around it, the ductwork, power, etc. And normal
8\' ceilings are 2.5m, so it\'s not that excessive.

At what TL do Deyo-based transponders appear?  (I\'m not very conversant
with TNE....)  And how do shipyards which operate at lower TLs _get_
their Deyo-based transponders?  Further, how does/did the Imperium
impose the Deyo-based transponder on extra-Imperial shipyards?

The variable-setting transponder referred to in the description of the
Corsair starship requires either a pre-Deyo transponder, or a Deyo-based
transponder that has been taught to lie....

(Sorry to stir the fecal material with this, but "enquiring minds want
to know."

Actually its a good bit bigger than the cubit. Its the distance from the base of 
the thumb to the elbow and back up again. The cubit is about 350mm IIRC. I 
just liked the idea of the official measurer caste winding a cord around their arm

Besides, one might have passengers/crew from low-grav worlds, who might
therefore be 2+ meters tall.  _I_ would want such persons to be able to
move freely through my ship (or at least through those areas to which
they had access.)

<tongue-in-cheek>Hey, maybe this is an argument for recruiting engineers
from very high-grav worlds (you build engineering decks at a low height
[say, 1.5 meters], and recruit gravity-stunted engineers to work
there).  That way, average-sized humans couldn\'t function effectively in
those spaces, and therefore couldn\'t take over one\'s ship as
easily....</tongue-in-cheek>

Well the "Chatter Box" chip circuit on every ship will/should have a
EMCON(EMmission CONtrol) switch to cease all comm activity via the chip.
Like when the pirate/privateer is hunting the target merchant ship. After
lengthy disccusion when the "Chatter Box" was first introduced into the
Traveller universe, a consenus was reached, ie a ship can cut off the out
ship commnunications, but later will have a good reason for it.

Well let see if every A class starport has say four techs, every Class B
has three techs, every C class has two techs that can *access* the "Chatter
Box" black box. Lets says the imperium of 11,000 worlds three quarters fo
the starports have BB(Black Box) Techs that about 9,000 teachs just at the
starport level, not counting the ones at the support level. So lets say
11,000 in the support level that means every Imperial year there are 20,000
BB techs working on the "Chatter Boxes", over 100+ years you will have
2,000,000 techs that have *knowledge* and skills to work on the "Chatter
Box". Due to the nature of covert/criminal ops, to say that more than one
of those BB techs would be *persuaded* to *pass on* such knowledge and
skills would be a vast understatement. 

Net result, after 100+ years, if you want your "Chatter Box" to sing a
different tune, you would not have to look very hard to get it done
*professionally*.<G>

The above does not factor into equation the *efforts* of non Imperial
governments in getting the "Chatter Box" to sing another tune.<G>

I thought it was the case that if the reactions increased too quickly then
the control rode were likely to be unable to be inserted in sufficient time
to avpoid melt down.  Is this right in theory but not a practical worry?
Why would fusion reactors not suffer, or is the magnitude of any increase
in power not likely to cause damage?  I thought that fatigue of containment
vesels caused by heat buildup from the absobed radiation was likely to be
greatly increased by a a lot of incoming radiation, especially from a
direction which it is not designed to cope with.  Comments?

Well, a real cubit was measured on the Pharoah\'s body, so with
different Pharoah\'s you get different standards.  And I wasn\'t sure what
exactly you meant by the base of the thumb until you explained it in
subsequent post.  I don\'t know the precise terminology for the point of
the hand your mean, but to me the base of the thumb is at the wrist.
And what you called the base, I would call, well, I don\'t know what,
which is why I wasn\'t clear.  ;-)

If they tried that in the US, there would be so many law suits, so fast,

Strangely enough, here in the US we do teach the metric system and insist
that students know it.
They get it in Math and Science.  The idea is that they need it to
study/learn science.
Luckily I teach history and avoid the mess that it causes.
A draconian approach would be the only way it would work.

  Doesn\'t the ship require any time to be brought from "scrapyard" status

If that \'stuff\' is counted against some other displacement, you shouldn\'t count
it against your available volume for the room.  As for 8\' ceilings, while
that\'s reasonably normal for buildings, vehicles have a tendency to be more

    'body' => 'I was perusing my copy of Star Fleet Battles, noted the bits on
early fighter shuttles - how they could launch more missiles than they
could control, and would need missile guidance support from either
their carrier or another friendly ship. This got me thinking in Traveller
terms. I\'d like to address the idea of Fighter Controllers, and the
idea of Point Blank (or Suicide) Attacks.

=========================

Fighter Controllers: Getting the Missiles on Target

One of the biggest problems with fighters is getting them to hit
big ships. If you put a capable computer in each fighter, the fighter
ends up being mostly computer (and power for the computer) and
is the cost of a fat trader or more - not the inexpensive force-multiplier
it should be. If you don\'t put such a computer on the fighter, it will never
hit it\'s target and will be, as one TML\'er put it, merely an "ornament".

But what if the fighter can get targetting solutions from another
friendly ship, at least for missile launch and guidance? Put a minimally
capable computer in the fighter itself - perhaps enough to dogfight
another fighter with, or give it a survival chance when getting shot at
(agility + computer + size bonus vs computer + weapon battery modifiers,
you can get away with a computer three to six levels below what your
intended target has if he doesn\'t intend to fire ten-turret batteries at
each and every fightercraft).

Have a fighter controller, probably (though not necessarily) on board
the Carrier. Perhaps even require that this fighter controller have an
entire bridge at his disposal, especially as a  bridge in High Guard
includes communication and sensors. Let the fighters fire by
groups, with the computer value taken from the fighter controller and
the battery factor compared to the number of weapons in the fighter
group.

I only see this working with missile fire, though I have some other
ideas for energy weapon fire. 

Fighters become pretty useful - say at 15 tons each (Rampart-style
missile fighters), 20 fighters with crew take up about 500 tons.
For the cost of having another bridge (2% of ship tonnage), 
you get 2000 ship tons worth of hardpoints, not to mention all the
advantages of having fighters along - reconaissance and patrol,
for example. You could probably fit such a squadron on every
ship in your fleet that was 5000tons or larger, allowing a relatively
large fighter screen and requiring a much larger investment by your
opponent in escorts (including an interceptor screen) and point-defence
weaponry.

(Note: For this analysis and the energy weapon analysis to follow,
I ignored the effects of defensive fire by the target. I would assume
the fighters in the examples are part of a larger fighter wing,
and that you should attack a capitol ship with more fighter wings
than he has point defense/repulsors/sandcasters (for missile
attacks) or sandcasters (for energy/laser attacks). If you can\'t
get such numbers together, you are better off not attacking with
your fighters unless desperate - but fighters squaring off against
a Dreadnaught are in pretty desperate straits anyway...)
- ----
Example: Ten tech level 12 fighters, with Model/2 computers, armed
with triple missile turrets and nuclear missiles, working with a fighter
controller on a ship with a Model/6 computer. Their target is also
TL-12, has a factor-1 nuclear dampener, armored hull factor-12 and
agility-6 - it isn\'t large enough to be easier to hit. (Most difficult
target for this fighter group at their tech level).

Attacking individually, the fighters need 16+ to hit and can be ignored.
(factor-2 missile battery)

Attacking as a group, the fighters need 14+ to hit, and can still be
ignored (factor-6 missile battery).

Attacking with a fighter controller, the fighters need 10+ to hit.
If they hit, they\'ll need 5+ to get through the nuclear dampener
and will do damage on 9- on each of two seperate tables - though
one of the hits on the radiation table (Computer-1) will probably
not take effect due to the target having fiber-optic backup.

So the group will hit 17% of the time, penetrate 89% of the hits,
and do damage if they penetrate - will even do two hits 70%+
of the if they get through. This translates to the fighter group
hitting and doing damage 15% of the time. Further, they will
tie up defense batteries (1000 ship tons worth per fighter),
and any shot at them will tend to be with overkill weapons.

=====================

Suicide Attacks: Sticking the Knife In

Energy weapons on fighters, used singly, are really only useful against
other fighters. Use of mother ship targetting capabilities (Fighter
Controllers) makes sense for missile guidance, but not as much sense
for close-in attacks - and without major-league computer support,
the fighter will never hit. 

Fighter\'s small computer + minimal target size modifier
versus target\'s larger computer + agility, not even considering
sandcasters - even if you allow fighter groups to fire together as
one battery, they\'ll still never hit anything designed for combat.

(Note: I\'m not considering sandcasters because if the fighter wing
has fewer fighters than the target has defense batteries, they shouldn\'t
bother with the assault anyway)

Just as Fighter Controllers give missile fighters a chance against
the better computers of a target warship, I propose Suicide Attacks
to give energy-weapon fighters a chance against the high agility
of a target ship. (The idea comes from GDW\'s game _Imperium_.)

Here\'s how it would work:

*Organize the fighters by groups - they must match, as usual, in
weapons (including weapon TL modifier), agility, and computer.
They must also be in the same range band, short range in this case.

*Declare a Suicide Attack by the fighter group.

*Have the fighters not fire during the normal combat step. Any damage
the fighters take is applied immediately. Fighters that no longer meet
the group profile due to damage (loss of computer, agility, weapons)
are not considered part of the attack group any more, though may
attack individually. 

*Recalculate the battery strength of the fighter group, if they\'ve taken
any losses.

*Fire at point-blank range with surviving fighters. If the fighters have an
agility as high or higher than the target, do not consider the target
ship\'s agility when calculating to-hit rolls.

- ----

Example: Fifteen tech level 12 fighters with Model/2 computers and
twin pulse lasers, all agility-6,  attack a tech level 12 ship that has a
model/6 computer, armored hull factor-12 and agility-6 that is large
enough to have no size modifiers.

Firing individually, the fighters need to roll 18+ to hit. They can be
ignored (factor-1 pulse laser battery).

Firing as a group, the fighters need 15+ to hit. They can still be
safely ignored (factor-6 pulse laser battery).

Firing with a suicide attack, the fighters will need 9+ to hit, much better.
If they hit, they will need 5- to do damage - either a 1% plink at the
fuel tanks, or a loss of an entire weapon battery.

(Note that this example pits the example fighter squadron against
the toughest possible target for it\'s tech level - most ships
a fighter will go after, at least at TL-12, will not be maxed out in
either armor or agility.)

So in our test case, the fighters will hit 28% of the time, and do damage
some 28% of the time - against the worst possible target, the fifteen
fighter squadron above will hit and damage 8% of the time.

=======================

Conclusion:

Missile fighters with fighter controllers will hurt you about 15%
of the time or better, energy weapon fighters with point-blank
tactics will hurt you about 8% of the time or better.

Not much, sure - but too much to be safely ignored by your opponent.
Furthermore, the warship countering this must fire at each
of the fighters with an entire battery. Each ten to fifteen-ton fighter
ties up at least 1000 displacement tons of enemy weaponry (enough
to support a ten-turret battery) for at least a round. Those are
weapons that aren\'t shooting at your capitol ships for the round,
and are highly overkill against a fightercraft. Cold comfort for the
fighter pilots, but making enemy ships inefficient is a good thing.

To kill your fighters efficiently, your opponent will need escort
ships and interceptors. These smaller craft will be available for
patrol, reconnaissance, blockade, all the other duties fleets need
done that are too little for battleships. Now the fleets are more
capable outside of a stand-up slugfest, and fightercraft (some of
my favorite animals) get to be more than mere "ornaments".

Has anyone noticed that the deckplans in Traders & Gunboats (LBB) have
nearly ZERO correlation with the tonnages that Book 2 (LBB) says they
should? Can someone explain where the rest of the bridge is on a
Scout/Courier? I like the way the plan is laid out, but there is supposed
to be 20 TONS of bridge there somewhere - 40 squares. Even adding in
avionics it\'s nowhere near enough space on the deckplan to account for
that tonnage. The other ships are just as screwy.

I don\'t care that much, since I\'m not a gearhead, (really, I\'m not!), but
I wondered if there was any reason for this that I am missing.

PS: I have never read High Guard, so maybe that\'s where I\'m missing
something.

I haven\'t seen any statistics for those, but my time drops by
about 0.5 sec. (avg.) for an open-carry holster that has no
thumb-break restraint.  Add the thumb-break restraint to an
open-carry holster and you\'re back to about the same time as
for concealed (hip or small-of-back) carry w/o the thumb-break
restraint.  All of this assumes a well-trained shooter, of course.
YMMV.

only thing they find they can afford is an old fusion-rocket powered hull
(TL9).  Looking over the rules from Hard Times, I find that I am becoming very
interested in the low-tech approach to starships.  The one problem I am
running into (PC\'s being what they are) is weaponry.  In order to keep cost
down, the power plant needs to be small...but this completely rules out
standard weapons (Beam or Pulse lasers take 250Mw per weapon, this jacks the
size of a powerplant up very quickly)  I am more than willing to use the
standard weapons from MT Refs guide (Weapon step 26 and 26); this actually
make perfect civilian-grade weapons, IMO.  But they cannot be rated to use w/
the MT/HG combat system, and I can\'t quite figure out how they would work
using the vehicle combat rules.  The requirement for a min hull armor value of
40 also seems to render them nearly useless...and there really is no guidance
on missiles, other than the offhand mention somewhere that they use
150mm HiVel warheads...nothing on nukes.  

Does anyone have any ideas or info that they used in thier MT games?  I want
to get away from the HG combat system for PCs...the idea being that when a
real warship shows up, the party is over; everyone out of the pool.  Any info
or ideas would be extremely helpful.

IMTU I have used the cargo availability rules as the random stuff left over that didn\'t go by major carrier.  The major carriers (Tukera, Imperalines, etc.) have large contracts for much of the stuff that goes from world to world.  They may routinely take 40 000 tons (displacement) from here to there every day for many of the lesser worlds, and millions of tons per day for major worlds.  What tramp freighters pick up using the rules is the left overs, or the special orders, or the stuff that is too small a
lot for the large carriers, or that has special handling requirements, or the few tons that the really tiny population worlds may generate, etc.

I stopped by my NSFLGS yesterday and asked about GURPS Traveller.  I
got blank looks from the black-garbed goth behind the counter, a
shrug and an "I don\'t know" from the wargame geek stocking the
shelves, and snorts from the card clowns throwing popcorn at each
other at the gaming table.  I always stop by to look for new stuff,
ask if they\'re expecting/or will special order, get nowhere, and so
end up ordering by mail.  <sigh>

That\'s my review of the state of the gaming hobby.

Reviewing, GT will have to wait until I get my hands on a copy. ;->

And then you hit them with agates, right? :-)

I happen to own a printer\'s ruler. I bought it by mistake 25 years
back, but kept it because the pica scale was just *too* useful for 25mm
miniatures. And it also drove players nuts when I\'d hand them a map and
the measurements on it didn\'t "make sense". Mapping at 7 or 14 feet to the
inch (using agates) or 6 or 12 feet to the inch using picas makes for a
mapp that they can\'t just lay a ruler on and read off the distances
(unless they know the secret).

Well, _my_ FLGS did have it! Also they had a decent collection of IG
books for those of you looking. Single copies only, but that doesn\'t
necessarily mean that was all they had.

They had : Pocket Empires, FFS2, Aliens Archive, Milieu 0, First Survey,
Milieu 0 campaign, Psionic institutes, Naval Architects handbook,
Missions of State, Long Way Gome, Gateway, Emperors Arsenal, Central
Supply catalog, and probably one or two others I\'m forgetting. They also
had a few TNE books there, too: A boxed set, a couple of copies of Path
of Tears, a couple of others. 

This is "Things for Thinkers" in Tucson, AZ. 

I\'m reading through G:T now; review forthcoming, but so far I\'m pleased
with it.

You are confusing fission and fusion reactors. Fusion reactors *don\'t*
"go critical". They only produce power because you are *forcing* the
reaction to take place (by supplying enough heat & pressure). 

So if something goes wrong, the reactor will shut down. Extra neutrons
or gammas aren\'t going to affect the reaction much.

One reason for this is that a long time ago someone claimed that a busy port
would be unable to check all the ships that came along. Rather than argue
about that (I disagreed) I tried to argue that a dodgy transponder signal
would get you singled out for a check. Not at every port, of course  --
sometimes the authorities would be to lazy to bother anyway  --  but sooner
or later, and all it takes to finish a not-so-promising piratical career is
once.

[Btw. excellent essay about what other identificantion a ship would be
carrying around. I completely agree with you.]

There is a beter and more reallistic solution.  I am a GURPS player by
preference and in the computer equipment lists is a discribtion of the
concept of the dedicated computer.  A computer not built to do everything
but one built to do only one job of a series of closely related jobs (like
control a fighters systems).  I am also a electronics engineer and I can
tell you from personal experience that dedicated computers are the way the
real world deals with things like fighters and misiles.  No fighter would
mount a Cray II.  The avionic package is built for that fighter or a series
of fighters with it\'s programs in firmware.  It is a fraction of the size of
the generalist computer that it would take to do the same joke because it\'s
purpose built with NO extranious stuff, like game capabilities of
spreadsheets or data bases or modems...

This means that the computer can be much smaller and cheaper in quanties but
costs as much as a totally new design would cost to build in low quantities.
It also limits choices.  The computer are built with say manuver/evade 3,
Gunner 3,  Predic 3, LAZER gunner 3, Misile gunner 5 and that IS HOW THEY
ARE.  Want something else buy a whole new computer and maybe have to pay an
EE to design it for you though most things should be available if you don\'t
mind having to pay for some things you don\'t want or need.  Also most modern
day fighter have very limited selections of avionic mostly those that were
originally built into them with some upgrades/drop in replacements available
from refiter.

So from a GM point of view, if a player wants a fighter we get the dedicated
computer the fighter was built with unless he custom orders one for many
MCs!  You as GM can say what the Rampart\'s avionic have but use reason.
Don\'t have a ship armed with lazer not have the computer to aim them or a
ship that carries no misiles with misile gunner 5...unless of course the
arms dealer stuck a suplus computer from a diferent model craft into a
fighter just so he could pawn it off on some pour traveller but the Al\'s
Used Military woundn\'y do something like that now would they...

Note that in the case of dedicated computers the programs can and usually
are VERY specific.  IE limited to the weapons the fighter was designed to
carry and in the case of manuvering to the fighter design itself.  This make
the programs themselves simpler/smaller due to the smaller number of
variables they have to deal with but then, they don\'t work well and maybe
not at all with equipment they were not designed to control.

 This is certainly true if the opponent is a *trained* fighter.  Covering
ground quickly is something drilled into fencers.  Other martial arts I\'ve
(been) kicked around taught methods to quickly cover ground while attacking.

  How you handle initiative would have a lot to do with this.

The manuscript for Aliens Vol. 1 is apparantly due real soon (I can\'t
remember what was said on the chat with the auther - David Pulver is
writing it BTW), I think this week.  Its going to be Zhodani and Vargr,
plus three minor races from thier area of space.  The minor races are
rewrites of races from Pulver\'s Aliens and Artifacts from ICE.  

I expect that the playtest will be up in a couple of weeks if I remembered
the dates correctly.

Mmm ... I think you ought to consider instituting morale roles for fighter

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
<Sound of horde of fighter pilots running for the escape pods...> :)

Recall that the effectiveness calculations were based on a
"Death Star without the exhaust port" type target - the most dangerous
target available at the tech level. A target with less armor, a poorer
computer or less agility will increase effectiveness by tens of percent for 
each factor in the fighter\'s favor.

Another item I was considering: Dogfight rules.

Dogfights occur when two opposing ships declare Point Blank
attacks on each other. When this occurs, the dogfighting ships
must undergo fire from all sources besides each other. They cannot fire
at any target except the one they are closing with. If they survive,
they perform simultaneous attacks on each other.

Dogfight modifiers to hit:

+ Relative computer rating
+ _Relative_ Agility
+/- Target Size Modifier
- -1 Missiles at short range (all dogfights are at short range)

Note that the major change is the substitution of Relative Agility for
Agility in the to-hit modifier. Two equally-matched laser fighters of
agility-6 once needed 14+ or worse to hit each other, now they need
8+ or better odds - much, much bloodier.

Also note that capitol ships and such could theoretically dogfight
an opponent, but it may not be a good idea.

Optional rule ideas:

Dogfight Break-Off: If two ships dogfight each other, they will stay at point
blank range with each other for each combat round until one or both
breaks off. Break-offs are declared at the end of each damage allocation
step. If both craft break off, they act normally next combat round. If
only one breaks off, the other gets one attack, as a normal Point Blank
attack (target\'s agility not counted in attack modifier).

Note that Dogfight Break-Off may keep a fighter from wanting to become
engaged in a dogfight, especially if he is close to home or otherwise
setting up an escape.

IMTU the base unit is the planetary credit, equivalent to 1/10,000th of
the average yearly production of its citizens. It is also, roughly, the
amount of money an unskilled manual laborer recieves (after accounting
fortaxes and dependents) for one hour\'s work under standard conditions.
The Imperial Credit (CrImp) is equivalent to the credit of Capital.

The money is backed by the economies of the issuing governments. Money
is, in effect, generalized promisory notes.

The transfer of wealth between planets are accomplished by transferring
real wealth (ie. goods) bteween planets. The money is merely promisory
notes. It can be in the form of bank notes or any other sort of (hopefully
secure) data transmission.

Designer\'s Notes: I built the hull using GURPS Vehicles 2nd edition and the
instructions in GURPS Traveller, as the hull table did not have a 300 ton
hull. I also extrapolated with the fuel processor (thus the 1.25 figure) to
get the same 10 tons per hour fuel processing capability as the original.

Some. The axial tilt and a couple other things vary on *long* cycles.
These are thought to play a part in ice ages.

Not necessarily. Ice ages require a balance of sorts. Get a bit too far
out and you get a *permanent* ice age. A bit closer in and you hardly
ever get ice.

Actually, glacier smooth things out more than they create relief.

Much of the Great plains used to be *sea bottom*. Shallow sea, but sea,
none the less. 

Remember that tectonic plates tend to be *flat* except at the edges
that have run into other plates.

Rules sets, rules sets - these efficiency estimates are based on

Remember, the problem in the High Guard rules wasn\'t so much
that fighters couldn\'t hurt a battlecruiser, the fighters couldn\'t
HIT a battlecruiser. Proper space opera requires the reverse to be
true, thus the optional rules for High Guard that I presented.

If the fighters can hit the battlecruiser, High Guard rules have most
of the damage confined to weapons. I could easily see these
representing sensor hits and turret damage, minor surface stuff,
perfect for the nibbling to death fighters should be able to do to
a capital ship.

I\'ll bet quite a few FF&S people on the list would be happy to show
you armored FF&S warships that would take on your "50 ton monsters"

Thus being canon-correct, and economically nonsensical, as these two values are
(a) subject to significant differences depending on how they are computed, (b)
not strongly linked in any case, and (c) not under the control of the
government, which is what is issuing the money ((c) has more to do with
political nonsense than economic).  For example, this means that a \'united
states credit\' is worth somewhere between zero (many unskilled laborers make no
money after accounting for taxes and dependents) to about 80 cents
(GNP/population) to about $4.50 (minimum wage for a worker with no dependents;
someone at minimum wage generally pays zero taxes).  It is also subject to
significant lag based on census figures, etc, and gives the government
essentially zero leeway to control the economy.

While in the long term this tends to be true, due to the way currency markets
work, in the short term this will probably not be true.

People worried about the death of the UWP needn\'t fear.  A page is set

Every now and then they get tangled up in whether they\'re talking in
GURPS or Traveller; is it TL12 or TL15?  Is it a class-V starport or
a class-A starport?  It isn\'t too bad sorting it out, though, since
there are Traveller-to-GURPS conversion tables.  Instructions for

     Yes I\'m sure there are, my previous post never said they could take on
large armoured ship on their lonesome.  I just said that the fighters I
have developed do indeed have an effect in combat.  There would be no point
in creating fighters for Traveller if they were unable to cause any damage
to ships, better to spend your resources on combat ships that can.  Since
they can indeed cause damage to armoured ships they have an important roll
in combat just as there forefather the fighter plane did in ship combat.  A
single ship in any size class can only have so much armour and weapon
systems, but with the addition of fighters the number of weapons is
increased and there are then that many more targets to confuse they enemies
gunners.  Even if you run that the fighters can do nothing more than "scrub
the hull clean" of antennas and turrets they are more than helpful.  If the
ship has no antenna then they can\'t cordinate with other ships, nor should
they be able to target your ships, nor even set a course for jump.  With no
weapons systems, turrets, they will be very much reduced in combat.

Iridium plated kudos to Loren, Steve, and the gang on a job well done!

I have been trying to find errors in the book, only a few minor editing
glips.  This is definitely NOT IG!
The background is rich, plenty of pictures, a very playable system, and
DECK PLANS!!!  Yes, deck plans of the Suleiman and Beowulf class ships,
it was like a reunion with old friends! ;-)

But the best part of course (speaking as a gear head) is the ship design
system.  Very nice, and quick to use.  The rules are based on High
Guard, they brought back harpoints (1 weapon per 100 tons displacement)
which will limit some of the insanity we have seen on THUDDD (it was
good while it lasted)  As a matter of fact, you could almost take a HG
ship and convert to GT w/o problem, I have.  Also, the system is fully
compatible with the Vehicles system, so any module made in vehicles can
be used for the ship system. Excellent!

And now enough of the review, time for the shameless plug...

The "Sloan" class of fleet escorts are small and lightly armed vessels
by Imperial Navy standards.  They are deployed in quantity for squadron
or fleet security, but are not intended to withstand a major assault.

  CREW: Captain (Leadership and Tactics), Pilot (Pilot [spacecraft]),
Navigator (Astrogation), Commo Operator (Electronics Ops [communication]),
two Sensor Operators (Electronics Ops [sensors]), Computer Operator
(Computer Ops/Programming), Screen Operator (Electronics Ops [force field]),
eight Engineers (Engineering and Mechanic), four Missile Gunners (Gunnery
[missile]), thirty Laser Gunners (Gunnery [laser]), two Medics (Diagnosis,
Physician, and Surgery).
  5000-ton SL Hull, DR 3401, two Missile Bays, thirty Turrets with three

250 Jump, 2000 Fuel, 157.5 Vehicle Bay (holds three 50-ton Modular Cutters),

PERFORMANCE: Accel empty 5.8G/5.6G loaded, Jump 4, Air Speed 8052 mph.

 ======

Design was fairly straightforward.  The number of meson screen and
nuclear damper modules are based on the displacement of the MS-2 and ND-2
in MegaTraveller.  Acceleration is thrust/mass based; for a military
vessel armor and cargo affect acceleration the most.  This prototype
conversion should probably have slightly less armor to get acceleration
up closer to the original 6G; it\'s currently at 2x.  For people who
haven\'t seen GT yet, the ship is _GURPS_ TL12, or Traveller TL15.  I\'m
not sure that my reading of the compartmentalization rule was correct.
The modular cutters were assumed to be equipped with weapons modules.
As in the original design, the ship is streamlined but no fuel purifiers 
are provided.

Neither have I, and I urgently need a question answered.

I have one day (today) until I have to have a complete list of all new
material I need to teach [physics _next_ year. Do any of you know of any
scientific probes that connect to a PC, or other neat stuff I can look at?

Many hurried thanks.

LONG WAY HOME, which I believe was originally designed by Liam McCauley.
This makes a good little ship for a group of PC\'s, with an extended jump

300-ton SL hull, DR 200, Basic Bridge, Engineering, 45 Maneuver, 9 Jump,
120 Fuel, 1 Spacedock hangar (holds up to 250 cf air raft), Basic Emissions

Designer\'s Notes: I built the hull using GURPS Vehicles 2nd edition and the
instructions in GURPS Traveller, as the hull table did not have a 300 ton
hull. I also extrapolated with the fuel processor (thus the 1.25 figure) to
get the same 10 tons per hour fuel processing capability as the original.

Heh. Ever hear of a spring holster? It fits on the arm and shoves a
small 2-shot derringer-sized pistol into the hand in about one second.
This thing was developed in the 1800s. For Traveller, just make the
round a 10mm HEAP from a snub pistol and "no worries, mate".

There was also a hi-tech version, called the "Power Holster", mentioned
in the Death World trilogy novels. It would flip a weapon the size of
a small 9mm (!) from the forearm into the hand, with enough force to rip
through regular cloth, faster than the eye could blink.

Required a lot of training and some hefty muscle on the arm (the
wearer was from a standard atmosphere, heavy grav world where
*everything* tries to kill you) but it was standard to remove the
weapon\'s trigger guard. This allowed the weapon to fire as soon as it
hit the hand just by crooking the trigger finger back when the holster
was activated. Like I said, it required a *LOT* of training; the
character started training when he was 7 years old! Given that the
character could hit a sparrow in flight without a thought (can you 
say "Handgun-6"?), this thing is like having a lightning bolt in
your finger tip. Talk about "point and shoot".

BTW, one of the old White Dwarf issues had CT stats for this thing as
part of an article on weapons for Traveller. I\'ll hunt \'em up and post
them tonight if anyone is interested.

Of course, bear in mind that GURPS Vehicles has no hardpoints system....
military vehicles constructed to Vehicles performance capabilities will tend to
seriously outpower any relatively small vehicles constructed with the starship
design system (I have a TL 12 fighter design floating around -- 10 displacement
tons, 8 Gs, functionally impervious to TL 12 lasers.  If I\'m willing to make it
only impervious from the front arc, it\'s capable of 11 Gs and can outaccelerate
missiles).

If it is a coincidence. IIRC Darrian has a 24 hour rotation too (and so does
Arden and Alell, but that\'s not germane). Did the Ancients in charge of some
of the human resettlements go the extra mile and adjust the rotation of their
planets while others (like the one in charge of Vland) didn\'t bother? Or did
some of them perhaps deliberately chose worlds with rotation periods close to
that of Terra? (I dislike the overuse of the Ancients to explain every little
oddity, but precisely when the homeworlds of minor human races are concerned
I think it is appropiate or at least permissible.)

Maybe for military ships (from the description and operations in Survival
Margin).  I\'d accept the "Imperium allows to hide," though.  Just because I
think Sunbeard the pirate is impossible, it doesn\'t mean piracy doens\'t
happen.  Of course if you don\'t allow the "turn off" to non military, then
non-privateering pirates can *not* exist.  Not w/o telling everyone in the
area who they are.  The ones w/o transponders get arrested or killed real
fast.

Doubtful.  These thigns were pretty hush hush.  Maybe one central place/Domain
(maybe Sector).  Hell, I can buy one main facility for the whole Imperium!
Componets,etc from many sources, but the chip itself (assembly, breeding, etc)
from just one place.  Robot construction facilities w/ some odd human
supervision making sure everything is running. The only place people are in
the loop is for the breeding, "human necessary" decisions, etc.

Except there aren\'t any black box techs.  Broken ones are destroyed by their
tamper circuit.  Integrity breeched, comm/computer access broken=SDG and
control circuit melted.  Need new transponder.  The new transponder is told
what ship its installed in and it\'s *never* forgotten (though that one can be
destroyed... install new one and back to the beginning...etc etc).  Maybe the
explanation will be satisfactory to keep one out of the slammer, but maybe
not. : )

> The above does not factor into equation the *efforts* of non Imperial

First, they have to know what\'s in the black box.  That\'s doable, but isn\'t
easy.  (Supposed to be unknown to the general public).  Then they\'ve got to be
able to open a box w/o melting the chip to slag (or otherwise acquire a
"Strain D, Group-313F" Chip).  Any ol chip from Cymbeline wont do it.  The
Imperium breeded the features they wanted into them (reliable mutation and
thus being able to authenticate themselves to each other) for about 50 years.
Any of these govts would be starting from scratch on their own breeding
programs.  Of course, espionage is doable, but getting the exact evolution
(and thus mutation) of the 3I\'s?  Very doubtful.  In any case, these new chips
would still be from a different strain (which would return a "false" squawk
from your trusty Imperial transponder) and the chip couldn\'t "fake the funk"
and give it\'s history back to its ancestors in the Imperial lab unless it came
from there.  If chips could be smuggled out from the Imperial lab, then the
game is over.  Expect a serious Imperial intellegence (and military)
establishment in the vicinity of the transponder research station(s)/lab(s).

The Deyo transponders were in final testing in 1086.  Enabling laws were
passed in 1088 and the "Deyo Circuits became mandatory equipment on all
spacecraft operating within Imperial boundaries"  They were installed as
standard equipment on new construction vessels and over the course of a 12
year phase-in period, retrofitted on all existing vessesl as part of routine
annual maintenence and relicensing procedures.   
All of that paraphrased from Survival Margin pg70-71  Also in Challenge
magazine (#?) as "When Empires Fall, part I."   As for aliens, their ships
don\'t have them, their ships don\'t enter Imperial space (legally anyways).
Being relatively full-proof, the aliens end up adopting them themselves (or
something to that effect).

The transponder itself would be TL15(borderline 16).  The Virus research
completed in the 1120s was TL16-17 (all of which was just playing w/ the
Cymbeline life-form).  AI is canon for TL16-17 (MT Ref\'s Companion).

Yup.  Course not allowing variable settings for non military ships means the
spacelanes can be alot safer.

Actually, as I understand it, the recorders on airplanes work on either
a "trip" basis, or on the more recent solid state units, they act like
a *long* endless loop tape. You\'ll have a record of the last X hours.
For Traveller, I wouldn\'t go for more than a couple of weeks.

  Such devices are being build and marketed today (i.e special ring
required to fire).
Oddly enough, the groups that have been calling for such firearms for years
(when they thought they couldn\'t be built) are no coming out against \'em.  
  Somehow they didn\'t think ahead enought to figure that folks trading to
the new firearms would be trading .38 revolvers to 9mm/10mm/11.5mm
semi-automatics with 10 round magazines.  Oops!
  
  There are tech games you play with your players concerning law levels and
firearms.  A good one is not allowing the players to use their own
firearms.  Force them to buy local ones.  Ones with a small built in
digital camera and a transmitters.  When you fire it, it stores a picture
of what you shot and squirts the image, firearm ID, and location to the
local cops.  :-)

Hm...I still don\'t have my copy of G:T, but based on the playtest stats and on
knowledge of how the G:Vehicles system works, some numbers here look fishy --
the area of a 5,000 displacement ton hull is 110,000, giving it 165,000 hp,
which makes me have doubts about armor and meson screen stats.  I guess you are
probably merging in the area of turrets and bays, which is incorrect -- they
have their own hit point totals and can be armored separately.

> Design was fairly straightforward.  The number of meson screen and

Probably dubious.  Convert on effect, not size in previous versions, which
probably means shrink the nuclear damper and boost the meson screen (preferably
by a large margin; less than 10,000 DR of meson screen is functionally
irrelevant)
> not sure that my reading of the compartmentalization rule was correct.
Not obvious what your reading of it was.  Compartmentalization cost works out
to be a multiple of hull mass for that portion of the hull which is
compartmentalized; turrets are ordinarily not compartmentalized.

I call B B and F F etc. When quoting a number I say "Three F zero C" or some
such (16140)

What\'s this Aten buisiness? why is the \'ten\' bit there?

Yes but saying ten or thirteen get\'s confusing if you are talking in both
hex and dec, so I would say one zero rather than ten. but wrtten it does
look the same so denote the number with hex, eg 13 (hex).

>Should "Twenty" be (F+1) * 2?  So you should have numbers like 2A, which

2A is 42. Starships cost no more as the NUMBER remains the same it is just a
different way of presenting the number. ie 402 000 000 Cr(dec) is 17F60880
Cr(hex) it\'s still 402 MCr either way.

>I\'m tired of thinking about it.  I\'ll stay decimal...


Fair enough, I wonder if we can make decimal computers though...

It can be a problem.

That\'s the point. An external neutron flux *won\'t* increase the
reaction rate. Fusion reactions are carried out by trying to get the
atoms in the plasma close enough together (high pressure) and moving
fast enough that they can overcome their mutual electrostatic repulsion
and get close enough for the nuclear force to cause the nuclei to come
together. 

Adding neutrons (or gamma rays) won\'t affect this. In a *fission*
reactor, the reaction is driven by neutrons being absorbed by the
*massive* nuclei. This then destabilizes them and causes them to break
into smaller pieces, among which are more neutrons.

The radiation isn\'t going to cause a noticable heat buildup in a fusion
reactor. The difference between 800-1000 C and 850-1050 C is pretty
miniscule. A fission reactor *tends* to be operated at lower temps.
Though liquid metal and gas core reactors will run at temps in equally
high if not higher ranges.

The fusion reactor has a million degree plasma in its heart. It\'s got a
*lot* of radiation to contain. But any *extrernal source of radiation
that could heat it enough to worry about would kill the crew
immediately.

Being in school at the time I can also remember the changeover ... and it made
no difference to most people.

Worse, it doesn\'t seem to have affected "popular culture" at all.

I teach High School and, guess what? The kids *invariably* measure their height
in feet and inches rather than centimeters, and their weight in Stones/pounds
rather than kilograms.

These are kids who have been brought up, theoretically, their entire lives under
the system.

Thing is, of course, their parents and grandparents *haven\'t* been.

Heh. Ever hear of a spring holster? It fits on the arm and shoves a
small 2-shot derringer-sized pistol into the hand in about one second.
This thing was developed in the 1800s. For Traveller, just make the
round a 10mm HEAP from a snub pistol and "no worries, mate".

There was also a hi-tech version, called the "Power Holster", mentioned
in the Death World trilogy novels. It would flip a weapon the size of
a small 9mm (!) from the forearm into the hand, with enough force to rip
through regular cloth, faster than the eye could blink.

Required a lot of training and some hefty muscle on the arm (the
wearer was from a standard atmosphere, heavy grav world where
*everything* tries to kill you) but it was standard to remove the
weapon\'s trigger guard. This allowed the weapon to fire as soon as it
hit the hand just by crooking the trigger finger back when the holster
was activated. Like I said, it required a *LOT* of training; the
character started training when he was 7 years old! Given that the
character could hit a sparrow in flight without a thought (can you 
say "Handgun-6"?), this thing is like having a lightning bolt in
your finger tip. Talk about "point and shoot".

BTW, one of the old White Dwarf issues had CT stats for this thing as
part of an article on weapons for Traveller. I\'ll hunt \'em up and post
them tonight if anyone is interested.

Since \'The Imperium\' in this case means more than a thousand (at least)
different officials (at least one per Class A starport, maybe also Class
B?) I somehow doubt that the Imperium will stay the sole owner of those
chips for long. Hijack a shipment and bribe someone with a legitimate
chip and you\'re in business. That\'s one of the reasons why I have trouble
accepting  --  no, make that: \'absolutely refuse to accept\'  --  the
unforgable Deyo chip transponder. A couple of oyhers are: 1) The dates
involved shows that these transponders would have been in use before 1105,
which that the programmable transponder mentioned in several canonical
sources would have been Deyo transponders  --  or at least able to fool
Deyo transponders. 2) My mind positively boggles at the notion that
the Solomani, Zhodani, Hivers, etc. would accept a requirement that all
their ships incorporate a mysterious black box connected to their
telemetry and communication equipment and delivered by the Imperium.

You propably couldn\'t cannibalize a captured Deyo transponder, but I\'m
quite sure you could buy a new one from some corrupt official. The only
problem I have with that is that I think the cost of such a baby would
be far higher than the canonical cost of a fake transponder.

          Just reading your tag line, did you really design Sace Opera?  If
      so how whould you like to adjust your aliens from that game to TNE
      stats?  I have used them before in Star Frontiers, and would love to
      use them again in Traveller.  I purchased Space Opera many, many,
      many years ago when I was living in Europe but was not able to find
      anyone to play.  That never stoped me from using it as a reference
      for the games we were playing.  I liked the over all game but hated
      the very long time it took to create characters although I will admit
      that you had alot of information when you finished creating that guy.

I appologise for using band width for this mess.

Dave, I hope you base this on something other than re-runs of "Wild,

Snork.  I couldn\'t help but crack up when I first read about these
things in Harry Harrison\'s books.  This is the most high-tech way
I have yet to read about for blowing off your own hand/forearm.
Training not withstanding, if the firearm punches through your sleeve
(or even hangs up on the lining of a regular sleeve while heading
for the cuff), that unprotect trigger trips and *BLAM*, you either
end up with a prosthetic arm or resign yourself to being addressed
as "Stumpy" for the rest of your life! :^)

There are plenty of high-tech ways of accomplishing a "lightning shot
from the sleeve."  Power holsters are *not* on the short list. :^)

GURPS Traveller) I notice one thing right off. The difference between a GAME
company and a company producing games.

GT is a very well done book over all. That\'s not to say there are no typos,
there are, but they are few, and easy to figure out. I\'m also sure that the
SJG team will have errata out in short order as they have with their other
games.

The art is a combination of earlier pieces and new art and deffinately is
Traveller (some may find fault with indiviual renderings but it is much more
Traveller IG\'s efforts). I\'ve already spoken about the deckplans on the deck
plan list. Here all I will say is they are useable, well drawn, but could
stand some improvement. One note, however, they are better than many that I
have seen associated with SJG in the past. I have hopes that they will
improve and in the course improve all SJG products.

A large portion of the book is taken up with a VERY complete background for
Traveller. Those missing much of the CT or MT material would do well to pick
the book up for this alone. One surprising and delightful addition is the
sidebars where (I assume) Loren explains some of the thinking behind items
that have become major points in cannon. This is an amusing insight into the
thought process that built the history of the game.

The ship design system harks back to CT in it\'s feel. Simple "plug and play"
modular design with the option to create more modules from GURPS Vehicles.
The joy is that it appears to be perfectly usable as is by the average GM.
Gearheads, I\'m sure, will be adding units in no time.

Characters are a matter that many Traveller players will find the hardest to
swallow. As with all GURPS it is point cost, with Templates for many of the
old standby character types. It a also includes a nice conversion section
that allows the conversion existing Traveller characters from all of the
previously published Traveller versions.

There are conversion charts for Metric to Imperial (US) measurements, as
well as Traveller\'s UPP data so conversions of earlier material should not
be a problem with a bit of effort.

Overall I\'d have to rate the book as 4 1/2 stars out of 5 ( the last half
star is for not haveing included deck plan keys, a personal gripe!). Thank
you, Loren for setting the bar for Traveller material back up where it
belongs!

Too many people think that driving on the left side of the road is a

you think.

I\'ve lived with picas, ems, ens, ciceros, points etc for most of my adult life; I

You can still afford 25mm!!!!!!! I converted to 15mm when I decided to recreate 
the entire army of Napoleonic Wurtemberg. (Andrew who lovingly remembers 
Prince Ruperts regiments of horse routing many a Parlimentarian regiment in 
25mm)

I thought fusion plants would just go dead if they got busted up - this

When the fusion plant on _Fearless_ went, it went up like a nuke.

It was very dramatic, though. Mebbe combat fusion plants are built
in dangerous ways to get lots more power out of them or something.

Miniguns use *way* too much ammo. Maybe an automated grenade launcer?
I\'d go for a mortar, but there are times when the mortar shell can\'t

Thousands of smaller merchants (including those PC\'s are likely to crew)
operate on the Imperial frontier, and visit star systems where the local
ships don\'t give a damn about Imperial transponders. Even if the
Imperium forbade deactivating transponders in Imperial space, they
should allow you to shut yours down outside Impie territory.
The alternative would be to lose more scouts, exploratory traders
and research craft to dangerous situations beyond the frontier that
could have been avoided.

If you can turn it off outside Imperial territory, the switch exists
when you are in Impie territory. Therefore you can meet a ship
with it\'s transponder turned off, or be in a situation where you
suspect the existance of an undetected ship with an off transponder,
and legally turn your transponder off yourself while running for
safer space inside the Imperium.

The only reason the Impies would force a transponder that couldn\'t
be turned off on all their shipping would be if they forbade
merchant ships from travelling outside of Imperial territory.
A more controlled society (say, the Zhodani) might do exactly that - 
except that all their merchant vessels are Zho navy auxiliaries.

Yay!  Each hex is a 1/4 dton, that\'s the scale I use, 1mx1mx3.5m, so
I can just fiat that 1 yd = 1 m and continue to use my deckplans.
Of course, the implication of of 4 sq *yards* equaling 500 cf is that
each of the hexes is 4.63 yards high...but hey, that\'s not *my*
problem. ;->

It\'s all those self-destruct charges ships come with (power plants/engines, 
computers, and display panels all must have explosive charges installed at a 
minimum).

Not if the transponder signal is encrypted. Encryption, by definition, uses
a secret number or something to encode the signal. Knowing the algorithm
lets you interpret the signal, but you must know the secret in order to
generate the signal.

The "secret" could be based on something like quantum transitions, and
theoretically impossible to duplicate or eavesdrop on.

If you look at most office buildings, you will find between the "ceiling" and ceiling many things like cabling, ductwork, support structures and piping.  This easily is 2+ feet above the 8 ft "ceiling."  I can\'t remember which book I read it in (but I think it was the Starship Operating Manual) that the total vertical size of a deck is not available for wandering around in, but is partly taken up by the stuff I mentioned above.  Currrent wet-navy decks are somewhat shorter than Traveller decks, but they
also run cabling, piping, etc. above normal head height but below the next deck up.

You are correct for the real world, and for most versions of Traveller, as
well.  This essay is based on material for a GT campaign, using GURPS tech
(UT, UT2, Robots, Vehicles, etc.).  The data storage capacity at GURPS TL12
(Traveller TL15) is enormous:  an EMP-hardened memory core (15lbs, 0.3cf,
and Cr5,000) holds 100 terabytes.  

Assume first generation flight recorders were GTL 6 (per VE2, p. 56), and
had a capacity of 30 minutes.  By GTL10 (which GT defines as average
Imperial), the data storage capacity is at least 3-4 orders of magnitude
higher than the original - say 2-200 days.  By GTL12, this is another 2
orders of magnitude higher - 200 days to 57 years.  I took one year as a
reasonable intermediate value.

Hee! Hee! That\'s true.

Re:  Explosive fusion plants in the Honor Harrington ficton.  Come
on, folks!  It\'s just a matter of poetic license. ;-> Unless...

...fusion plants in HH\'s universe are fusion *bombs* who\'s reaction
has been slowed to an absolute crawl allowing power to be safely
extracted.  Lose the magic that slows the reaction down and it
*does* go boom!

Maybe we could invoke the same technology behind the gravitic bands
Weber uses to provide thrust/shield the ships.  His description of
stuff (including lasers) striking one of these bands implies (to me)
that they don\'t *block* the hits, they slow it down (somehow) so
that the energy dissipates before the missile/beam/particles get
through to the hull.

Call it "100 grams". Especially since McD\'s is always getting nailed

My take, and I have always tended to \'convert\' the metric measurements for
some players, has been to concider a meter roughly equal to a yard (GT does
this). deck sizing then it 3 meters floor to floor or 3 yards. I then
explain that the \'ceiling\' is actually 2 to 3 feet lower or 6 - 7 feet high,
the extra space being filled with conduit and pwer feeds, air recycler
ductwork. water and sewage plumbing etc. In higher clas ships this is
further covered by a drop ceiling arrangement. On the average Freetrader the
drop ceil has usually been tossed out except in living quarters and common
areas. I\'ve ofter thought of including a \'tween decks plan to deck plans,
ever since a PC used a "ventalation duct" to slip between cabins, I\'ve just
never been that ambitious, I\'ve also started explaining that the ducts are
usually too convoluted for a person to manuver through for more than a
couple of feet.

 I\'ve been beefing about it for years, actually. I\'m not really worried about
things like Bridge size, since I considered 20 tons to be rather vast for
anything
smaller than 2000 tons. No, my main beef is in overall ship size.  In Traders
& Gunboats the Scout, Fat Trader, and Gazelle are pretty good, while the
Far Trader is twice the proper size and the SDB and its Jump Shuttle are both
a "little" off.  FASA didn\'t help matters, as most of the deckplans they did
were worse. Even DGP had this problem: the Free Trader in the Starship
Operators Manual is twice proper size.
 As might be expected, Imperium Games was no better. Most of the subcraft
shown in T4:Starships are WAY off, as is the Subsidized Freighter (a ship
I\'m working over as we speak; the three-story-tall walk-in closets really
got to me). As has been flogged thoroughly here before, much of Starships
needs major work to be useful...

  GDW did finally fix the Far Trader in TNE (in "Guilded Lilly"), but all of
the MT versions had the same size problem as the CT version. I fixed it
for my own use in the other direction (as did Seeker) by making a 400ton
ship of the same shape...
  DGPs Free Trader works if you consider the scale grid to be 1.0m instead of
1.5m.
  I\'m still working my way through FASAs stuff as the interest grabs me. One
of the greatest offenders is the famous King Richard. Unlike some large
ships, the Richard shows all of every deck in detail, including nice side
views.
the problem is that they forgot to include 95% of the fuel tankage...

Malorn is a sector in which humans have not heard of other sectors (nor

had no contact with other virus than the flu :p  , but they\'re all low
tech.

In one subsector there is some contact with a high tech civilization
that has exchanged some of their technology (spaceships) in eschange of
natural resources, and this is the subsector where Aurora is placed, a
system trying to escape from their neighbors (from Kent system) control
and trade directly with the subsector\'s capital system.

Incorrect.  MS makes a trackball version of the intellimouse.  It is a
mid-sized trackball, although not as nice as the full-sized ones that use
the larger 2" balls (Logitech\'s new Marble FX is the one I use, although
Kensington also comes to mind).

Anyways, most trackballs can be run without installing any additional
drivers.  You might not gain some of their specific advantages, but you can
still point-and-click.

    Different styles have different approaches.  An Escrima artist will

  Doesn\'t the ship require any time to be brought from "scrapyard" status
to putative spaceworthiness? If so, then the new ID could be disseminated

It takes time to make a scrapyard ship spaceworthy, but it doesn\'t
need a transponder until it flies. IMTU, the ship could get the
transponder last, first, whenever the new owner bought it. He could
even be bolting the transponder to the avionics array as the
startport engineer is performing the safety inspection.

If YTU requires that a transponder be issued long enough in advance
of first flight for the ID to be transmitted sectorwide (4-6 months),
that\'s fine - but you still have transfer of ownership situations.
Let\'s say _Consort Frederica_ just got seized by customs for

still have an APB notice for the _Frederica_ that I\'ll have to deal

How much time does take for light to reach and cross the singularity
of a black hole, from the light\'s frame of reference?  Whether light
slows down or the distance travelled increases doesn\'t really matter
from the light\'s frame of reference, does it?

Want to bet?  The mile in essentially it\'s current length goes back
*two* millenia. I suspect the pound is quite close to the Roman
"librum". In fact, you\'ll find that *most* non-metric measurements go
*way* back, with only a few percent varaince over the centuries.

And the clincher. Standard railroad gage (spacing between rails) is
based on the wheel spacing of wagons. The spacing of wagon wheels was
based on the existing ruts in the roads. And that goes back to the
spacing of wheels on Imperial Roman chariots! I am *not* making this
up.

In the case of the wheel spacing, it\'s easy to see why the measurement
persisted. But many measures of length, volume or weight tend to
persist because they are used in commerce, and both merchants and
customers have a vested interest in them stayuing unchanged. Or rather,
they may want changes, but in *opposite* directions. The same goes for
measures used in determining land boundaries, or in tax collection.

Oh yeah, the hour, minute, second and degree go back to Babylonian
times.... :-)

None of those \'officials\' can open the black boxes.  In fact, noone can (w/o
destroying the chips inside).  There is no access to the chip except where
they breed the chips and assemble the black boxes.  I presuppose there are a
limited number of these facilities (if even more than one).  Needless to say
these *must* be heavily protected from both espionage and corruption.  Even if
others know the true nature of the chip, they can only go about breeding their
own.  The chips were *evolved* to their usable form (as transponder chips)
over the course of decades.  How easy is *that* to duplicate (especially
beyond the abilities of Imperial intelligence to discover)?  Also remember
that nothing says the further development (and replacement) of the chips will
be prevented in the future.  

Even if that was done (and we\'re getting into an increasingly difficult and
dubious number of "if\'s") the chip itself can only tell where it\'s been and
what it\'s been up to.  They can\'t "lie" as the DGP style transponders do.  The
military ships (and all, according to a justifiable "canon" argument) just got
a mute button.

Yup.  1088 according to Survival Margin.  A 12 year period to have them

Not having these long OOP sources, i can\'t really debate this.  I hold the

Anyone care to paraphrase/summarize how this \'programming\' worked?

If they want to do business in Imperial space they would use whatever the
Imperials required them to.  As for using them on their native systems, maybe
their high-ups learned precisely how they operate and that they were full
proof against conventional methods of forgery.  There is indeed a way to make
them tell lies (as well as take complete control over the ship)... and that is
Virus, which is a TL17 program and thus far beyond any of the 3Is neighbors.

One can buy whole transponder black boxes, but not Deyo chips or their control
chips.  No hypothetical \'corrupt official\' (beyond the counter-espionage
abilities of the Imperium, that is) has access to the chips.

Well seeing how fake transponders are supposed to be impossible by this
scheme, that is largely irrelevant.  The cost is actually Zero (since it
doesn\'t exist). ; )

But not to the general public (and the Library Data available to them).  I\'m
sure a high noble can find out nearly any piece of information one cares to
look up.  How many high nobles are there? ; )

Besides... A few thousand people out of a population of trillions.  And i\'m
sure of those trillions a few thousand can also be provided to make sure an
"accident" happens to anyone likely to squeal (even assuming these people
don\'t have the highest Imperial security clearance to begin with).  Remember
that Brent Spiner scientist guy at Area 51 in the eye-candy flick ID4?  That\'s
probably what the people working at Research Station Omicron are like. : )

You (amongst others) make a quite convincing argument for the mute switch

COVER ART:
The Black Book is back!  The cover is a straight reproduction of the
Classic Box, with the GURPS logo and SJG at the top and bottom.  Visually
striking, and it stood out on the new games shelf.  This one will attract
attention.

The back cover features the usual ad copy, which seems to be aimed at the
longtime/former Traveller audience.

CHAPTER 1: THE UNIVERSE OF THE THIRD IMPERIUM:
A general overview of the 3I setting.  Designed as a "common knowledge"
document, it covers the basics of the game world.  Loren? Any chance of
getting this section on the web for easy printing?  I\'d love to have this
as a handout for newbies.

CHAPTER 2: DETAILS OF A UNIVERSE
This chapter is the reason why everyone should buy this book.  A
seventy-page exploration in depth of twenty years of development of the
setting.  A full sixty pages of library data, explorations of religion,
biotech, and cyberpunk as seen in Traveller.  An incredible resource.

CHAPTER 3: CHARACTERS
One of the things I was worried about with G:T was the translation of
career-orientated Traveller character generation to GURPS\' points system.
Loren has handled this masterfully with a system of templates, allowing you
to generate characters in any number of professions.  The profession seems
to be drawn from TNE.. the attorney is back!  As written, the templates
give a nice transition into GURPS speak.  Players familiar with GURPS
shouldn\'t need them, but they do make it easier.

CHAPTER 4: EQUIPMENT AND TECHNOLOGY
The first section of this chapter explains the different technology
assumptions between Traveller and GURPS, and how to compensate.  A
reference chart shows the equivalent TLs between to two systems.  A fairly
standard list of weapons and equipment follows.  Most of the weapons seem
to have been drawn directly from Books 1 and 4.  The armor list is pure
Classic, which is a minor nit..  there are many different types of armor
already available in GURPS, and the Trav types don\'t add much.

CHAPTER 5: TRAVEL, TRADE AND COMMERCE
My favorite part of Traveller!  Simple, basic rules for normal and jump
space travel, and a *very* short trade section (one page).  I really hope
that this will be expanded sometime down the line, because as it stands G:T
trade is bloodless.  Short conversion rules for UWPs end out the chapter.

CHAPTER 6: CHARACTER CONVERSIONS
I really didn\'t get deeply into the section, since I\'m not planning on
converting many characters.  It looks like reasonably complete rules for
taking characters from any edition of Traveller and GURPSing them.  To be
honest, I prefer to start fresh with the original character concept, and
try to build it rather than do a point for point conversion, but that\'s
just me.

APPENDIX A: STARSHIPS
Some of the classic ships, given the GURPS treatment.  As a Gearhead of
long standing, it took some doing to accept ship stats that didn\'t fill an
entire page, but the illustrations are nice, and the deckplans are well
executed.

APPENDIX B: MODULAR STARSHIP DESIGN
G:T\'s answer to QSDS.  Haven\'t had time to play with this, but it appears
to allow reasonably complete ship designs up to 100,000dtons.

APPENDIX C: SPACE COMBAT
Last, but not least, David Pulver\'s space combat system.  It seems to
remind me of the RPSCS.  

ARTWORK:
The art through out this book is phenomenal.  This is by far the best
traveller art since DGP folded.  Every single piece is well done, and works
with the established look.  Especially nice are the illos accompanying the
templates.  Some of the artwork I recognize from other sources, others are
obviously new.

OVERALL:
woo-hoo!!!  Loren, if you aren\'t accepting an Origins award next summer,
there is something wrong with the universe.  This is a must buy for any
Traveller fan, even if you despise GURPS.

My impression was that the gravitic sidewalls work like weaker versions of
the wedges - they protect against beams by dispersing the beam because of
the huge gravity gradient. Mind you I can\'t see how this is supposed to
stop the X-ray pulse from a nuke (in _Honor amoung Enimies_, IIRC, it
states that the wedges are proof against any weapon) as this is not
coherent, linear or focused, but just very powerful and this power is still
going to exist after traversing the wedge.

Based on the two I\'ve had the opportunity to read they\'re damn
entertaining, though.

From the light\'s point of view, it takes infinite time - it always takes
infinite time at C. If you plug \'V=C\' into the Tau equations, then the
equation simplifies to 0.

T=sqrt(1/(1-v^2/c^2)) 
=> T=sqrt(1/(1-C^2/C^2)), 
=> T=sqrt( 1/(1-1) ) 
=> T=sqrt( 1/0 )
=> T=Infinity

Andy, that was a rhetorical question.  ;-p 

I had commented that the wedges (Rupert it was the wedge more than
the sidewall I had in mind) prevented anything from reaching the
hull by "slowing it down" so much it didn\'t have any effect, and
taking infinite time certainly slows it down...from the light\'s
point of view.  ;->

My take on the Weber Wedge is that they are gravitically induced
singularity planes (areas of infinitely curved space) projected
between Alpha and Beta nodes.  Anything entering that area basically
disappears.  The impulse drive compresses the ship between these
wedges shooting it ahead like a seed squeezed between two fingers.

I speculated that the Weber Fusion Plant was a fusion bomb
compressed within some form of his gravitic magic.  The reaction
occurs at real time within the trap, but is released much more
slowly across the interface.  However, if you drop the gravitic trap
the reaction proceeds as per normal...this gives you the "damage the
plant, plant go boom" effect.

All just magical handwaving, though. ;->

Looking on page 41 of _Pocket Empires_, the second part of your
definition matches almost exactly with the definition of "small-c
credit" (the economist\'s term, not the name of the currency).  The first
part seems to derive from the paragraph beginning, "The average earnings
of one labor factor (100,000,000 people) are one trillion credits."

I think that this misreads the definition of "small-c credit" from PE. 
The economic definition from page 41 of PE clearly describes the
relation between taxes, dependents, and "small-c credits."  Once one
figures out how many people can be supported by the income of one
unskilled laborer (we\'ll use minimum wage as the base income in US
[captial-c] Credits, aka dollars), we can divide that figure by the
"retention rate" a term I have coined to refer to that portion of one\'s
pay that one keeps after paying taxes) at that income level to determine
the relationship between credits [small-c] and dollars [capital c]. 
Thus, if a minimum-wage worker (I\'ll use $5.00/hr just to keep the math
simpler) can provide support for one dependent, in addition to
him/her/itself, and pays a net tax rate of 15%, then a US dollar would
equal:

(2 [persons supported] / .85 [retention rate]) / 5 [amount of US
currency to achieve this level of wages], thus:

(2/.85)/5, which equals (2.35)/5, which equals .47 (all calculations
rounded to 2 decimal places), which means that each US dollar is
equivalent to about .47 small-c credits.

This can then be used to determine the effective exchange rate between
planetary currencies, by determining the small-c credit value of each
unit of currency, then determining the ratio between the two.

Of course, an obvious problem is that, for political reasons, the
government of one political entity may set an arbitrary exchange rate
between that entity\'s currency and another entity\'s currency (this can
happen at nation-state, world, or inter-planetary/interstellar
government levels).  In this case, the small-c credit ratio described
above, adjusted for purely emotional (aka random) factors, will tell you
the "black market" rate of exchange.

In addition, the political currents on a given world may demand changes
in the relative value of "small-c credits" and the local currency.  For
instance, a government experiencing deficits may choose to inflate the
local currency, by expanding the money supply (depending on the nature
of the currency, this can be done by debasing the currency [adding base
metal to a precious metal currency], printing more currency, or
electronically expanding the effective quantity of currency).  If this
happens, for purposes of interstellar trade, one must recalculate the
"small-c"/capital-c" ratio between the official unit of money and the
overall value of that money.

YOU CAN\'T HAVE IT!!)  Anyway, I soon progressed to SFB, played some Dice

stripe on my gaming store\'s shelves.  Ahh, I knew I had found what I had 
been searching for, sort of the Holy Grail of games ya know?  Anyway, 
even though we were as young then as the new gamers are now, we had a 
lot more imagination.  Heck, we not only played SFB, we designed ships, 
scenarios, and actually got to do playtesting for the company!  Those 
were the days.  And Traveller!  Designing whole universes, great fleets, 
we were in gamer\'s heaven.  Seems like these days, a lot of imagination 
has gone by the wayside with these card games.  Now I know, not all the 
new gamers are in this state, so don\'t flame me for being narrow minded, 
but sometimes I wonder where the hobby will be in another decade or so.  
I\'ll still be here (I hope!) Okay, enough mourning, gimme my FFS2, I

I stopped by my NSFLGS yesterday and asked about GURPS Traveller.  I
got blank looks from the black-garbed goth behind the counter, a
shrug and an "I don\'t know" from the wargame geek stocking the
shelves, and snorts from the card clowns throwing popcorn at each
other at the gaming table.  I always stop by to look for new stuff,
ask if they\'re expecting/or will special order, get nowhere, and so
end up ordering by mail.  <sigh>

That\'s my review of the state of the gaming hobby.

Reviewing, GT will have to wait until I get my hands on a copy. ;->

Not true.  To decrypt the signal both sender and reciever must \'know the
secret.\'  If the sender used a Hysenberg (do not know the spelling)
randomizer then only the sender would know the \'secret\'.  Both sender and
reciever must have a key to work from but a public and a private key system
could be used like in PGP but even that can be broken.  The simple fact is
that anything concieved by man can be bested by man.

I\'m afraid that I must aggree for several reasons.  If you look at modern
aviation practices \'transponders\' are designed to add a ident signal to
incoming radar signals for tracking purposes.  The concept of \'fingur
printing\' space ships to counter piracy is asinine.  All a pirate has to do
is have a legal ship and one without any traansponder and he is untracable.
Also no sane person would be a pasenger on a ship that contiuiosly screamed
\'here I am\' in pirate infested space or unexplored space.  Also no military
would tolerate the ability to exactly track the moments of their war ships
just as the exact location of our SBNs is a closely gaurded secret.  In
short this level of \'big brotherism\' is counter productive to the \'prime
directive\' of the Impire which is the free fow of trade and the maintanence
of said free trade.

ObTrav: GURPS Traveller is out now and living in the pits of Indiana, I
have yet to see a printed copy in my FLGS. I got a chance to playtest it on
SJGames, though, and I know that several others on this list have as well.
My question is directed at those of you that playtested GT and now have a
copy of the final product:

Is GT significantly improved in final form?

From the early reviews, I would guess that it has been, but enquiring minds
want to know. Should I drop $20+ on it?

The playtest itself, although it produced a large volume of traffic, seemed
a bit unfocused to my untrained, outsider eye (with a significant amount of
noise compared to other recent SJG platests). I was wondering if Loren and
crew actually got something constructive out of it.

    'body' => 'I could not believe that my gaming store got a copy of Gurps Traveller so quickly. I
have looking forward to the release of this supplement for some time. Full
disclosure: Gurps isnt my cup of tea (Hero System junkie). I usually buy Gurps
sourcebooks to use in other games.  Im a big Traveller fan. I have played at least
one game in the four previous versions of Traveller.

General Review:
I really like the job that Loren Wiseman and crew did with Gurps Traveller. They
found the element of Traveller that has endeared it to fans for over 20 years: The
unbroken, no rebellion, no virus game world of the Third Imperium. I thought that the
ideas for MegaTraveller  (rebellion) and Traveller: The New Era (collapse of
civilization) were interesting, but should have been alternate timeline sourcebooks
that Traveller players could buy if they were looking for something different. GDW
biggest mistake was to destroy the Third Imperium. The funny thing is Gurps Traveller
is an alternate timelime/reality according to the introduction to Traveller on pg. 4.
I guess the rebellion and collapse will always be the official world.  How Traveller
4th edition fits in this (another alternate timeline?), I have no idea.

Gurp Traveller is probably the largest collection of information of the Third
Imperium game setting collected in one book. That alone makes it worth the $20-22 for
the book.

What I liked:
- - Cover art: The nostalgic black cover brings back memories. A great idea to
go            with the classic cover.

- - The setting and game information: see above.
- - The index: Why do most game companies make good games and not take the extra week
to make a good index for it. A resource book does you no good if you cant find the
information you are looking for. Gurp Traveller has a great index, easy to find
anything.

- - The character templates: Looks like they remembered all the old character careers
from previous versions of Traveller.

- - Conversions Rule: A whole chapter on converting character from old versions of
Traveller. If would have been better if they also gave guideline for converting
creatures also.

- - Deck Plans: Not the best deck plans for Traveller ships I have seen, but good
enough for someone new to Traveller to get started. No Far Trader deck plan though,
looked like it was left out by accident.

- - 2-D Space: I know many people wanted 3-D space maps in the next version of
Traveller for more realism, but really they would be more trouble than they are
worth.  Maybe all points in the galaxy are on the same plane in jump space, so up and
down direction does not matter in space travel.

What I did not like:
- - No information about sectors and subsectors: They should at least have a couple
pages detailing one subsector. The whole book only has one subsector map, with no
details for it. SJG should put subsectors on the web page once in a while as
freebies.

- - World Building: I think this is covered in Gurps Space, but they should have talk
about designing your character homeworld. It really help flesh out a Traveller
character.

- -  No self-contained: This is my Hero System bias showing. It play Gurps Traveller
you will need Gurps Core Rules (duh!!), Compendium I: Character Creation (did not
know about this book till yesterday), and Gurps Space. SJG also suggests Gurps
Ultra-Tech and Ultra-Tech 2, Gurps Vehicles would not hurt, and Gurps Martial Arts if
you plan to play a martial artist.

- - Psioncs: They did not cover psionics that well, but most editions of Traveller
dont really. The truth is that a psionicist in the group is usually more trouble
that they are worth.

- - No creatures: They should have had a couple of example creatures in the book. No
aliens bugglies to shoot with my VRF Guass Gun, DAMN.

Nitpicks:
- - No deckplan for Far Trader: see above.

- - Sidebars: I like the side bars in Gurps sourcebook, but sometimes to miss important
information in them. The Vargr character creation rules were hidden in a side bar,
and I did not see it till the second time I read the rules.

- - No bibliography

Final opinion:
I suggest this book to any gamer who like sci-fi based games. It is a must for a
Gurps player, and Traveller fans. Good job SJG.

Actually, moving clocks run slow as you approach lightspeed.  So from
the light\'s point of view, the time is zero. :>

  My take on the Weber Wedge is that they are gravitically induced
  singularity planes (areas of infinitely curved space) projected
  between Alpha and Beta nodes.  Anything entering that area basically
  disappears.  The impulse drive compresses the ship between these
  wedges shooting it ahead like a seed squeezed between two fingers.

Weber\'s ships can still "see" through their wedges.  Therefore,
"anything entering that area basically disappears" is inaccurate.
Anything physical which hits the wedge gets shredded by the tidal
forces, and the light which hits the wedge gets bent so thoroughly
that it is essentially impossible to target the ship.  The ship
generating the wedge knows the exact strength and power of its wedge,
so it can correct and still see out... but any ship trying to shoot in
cannot get a good enough reading off of the wedge to do the same
thing.

This corresponds to the descriptions Weber has given in the books, I
think.

However... if the ship generating the wedge can correct for the wedge,
why can\'t it shoot energy weapons _OUT_ through the wedge?


His sidewall don\'t make much sense.  How can a more powerful
laser/graser break through a gravity-generated sidewall more easily?
It\'s still gravity...  unless the sidewall generators require energy
corresponding to the energy they\'re trying to affect and when hit with
too much will just pack up and go home.


  I speculated that the Weber Fusion Plant was a fusion bomb
  compressed within some form of his gravitic magic.  The reaction
  occurs at real time within the trap, but is released much more
  slowly across the interface.  However, if you drop the gravitic trap
  the reaction proceeds as per normal...this gives you the "damage the
  plant, plant go boom" effect.

Weber\'s fusion plant is magnetically contained (he keeps referring to
the stability of the "magnetic bottle") and high energy.  If the
magnetic bottle goes away, the fusion reaction will stop, but the
extremely high energ plasma contained by the magnetic bottle is still
there and has to go _somewhere_.  Hence, fusion plants can go boom.

Another way of looking at it is if you take a high-temperature working
furnace and suddenly pull off one of its walls, heat and flame will
come rolling out the hole.  Now increase the temperature and pressure
inside to something approaching the sun.

My primary objection was to using the \'credit\' (as defined from wages) for
_anything_ other than theoretical arguments about economics.  It\'s also almost
completely irrational to tie the value of local currency to wages -- it\'s tied
to GPP, and that in turn depends on how you choose to define GPP.

A few points:
1) My practical experience at hand to hand fighting with Melee weapons (7
years SCA fighting) has given me the opinion the more skilled fighters are
better at hitting you (chance to hit) than hitting you hard (damage done).
2) Jeez, I started this whole thread because I thought that the
hand-to-hand damage seemed a bit high. You want to increase it?
3) Anything that complexifies combat more than it already is, is not a good
thing.

MS also produces a special oversized trackball aimed at the youth market

and it has large buttons.  Very easy to use.

It depends on what your other options are. Note that the way most starships
are laid out there are seldom any corridors longer than 10m. Any longer and
I\'d put a bulkhead in it. Odds are that your welcoming committee is only
going to get one shot anyway. If they don\'t wipe everyone out (and if the
attackers are armoured, they aren\'t likely to) they they will be engaged
and unable to return fire as the rest pile in.

Consider a boarding action. The defenders are in the disabled ship and can
hear them on the outside of the hull. They pretty much know which airlock
they are going to break into and can set up their braced, steadied and
aimed submachineguns or lasers. (Note: the result of a separate thread
concluded that shotguns are actually the best weapon to use if you care
about not damaging your ship or fellow crew with ricochets.)
So, the boarders blow the airlock and both parties cling to their
respective cover as the air blows out (if not already blown). What next? If
I was a boarder I\'d fling in a smoke grenade (actually, in airless zero-G
it would probably be more like chaff, but that\'s a different thread). If I
were a defender, I\'d respond by opening fire. This isn\'t a winning
proposition for the defender as the boarder probably has more smoke
grenades than they do clips for continuous fire.
For argument\'s sake, lets assume the boarders have an infinate amount of
ammunition, something to defeat obscuring devices, or whatever that allows
them to mount continuous effective counterfire out the airlock. As a
boarder, returning fire is not a particularly useful option. You have to
expose yourself to an emplaced position for, at best, a dodgy target.
Chucking grenades down the corridor is slightly better, but not that great
if you want to keep the ship. It seems not an unreasonable option to plan
to charge the corridor with melee weapons and overrun the post.
Now there are clever ways of doing this. Just like police use riot-shields,
I\'d put a hullmetal shield in the hands of whoever is on point. If they
have any sort of powered armour, great, you can make it thicker. Chuck in
some more smoke or explosive grenades to soften them up and they you and a
bunch of your buddies charge with axes out. Even if they are still
perfectly prepared they will get one round of fire before you are on top of
them. If you have numerical superiority (the general assumption for
boarding parties of all eras) enough should survive to engage them in the
next round. If nothing else they will occupy them while the next wave of
boarders comes in.
Facing this situation as a defender I\'d opt for putting up a front rank of
auto-fire weapons. Deploy the minimum number of people necessary to keep
the corridor up to the first turn in danger space. I\'d then deploy the rest
behind them out of direct fire (and sight) with axes (and preferably
shields, but I show my SCA bias there :-). When they make their charge the
gun fighters should try to fall back through the melee ranks while the two
sides engage. The objective for me would then be to push their line back
out through the airlock after which I\'d fall back to the original position
and hope they had had enough.

Anyone got another boarding scenario?

   Yup.  Local cops *hate* it when they find \'em modified like that. ;-)
 Smuggling non-net firearms onto such a planet is a good business too.

Plus there is the reverse side of the coin. Figure out a way to lobotimize the
cop\'s smart guns so they are inoperable. This is a real concern. I have read
many people pointing out (both in gun mags and on line) that a smart gun
(especially Colt\'s proposed design) can easily be rendered useless if the
smart gun hardware is electrically based. Just remove or drain the power, (or
forget to check the itty bitty watch batteries) and it\'s dead. The magnetic
ring idea seems a little more do able, and I am considering having my Smith
and Wesson revolver converted when the cost comes down (my weapon cost me $125
used, or $400 new, and I think that the magnetic based system costs more than
the weapon...

To be fair, most of the criticism of the Colt smart gun seems to be based on
statements that the new CEO of Colt firearms has made recently. He has come
out in favor of a nationwide Federal firearms permit. In the US, this is VERY
contraversial (there is this little thing called the Bill of Rights...), and
many consumers feel he is abandoning civilian customers for the more lucrative
government contracts.... In the rest of the world this is a null point, as few
civilians own sidearms (or any firearms for that matter....:-(

"Theoretically".  How many times has that been inovoked in the past?
How many times have people found ways around supposedly secure systems?
Add the fact that we are talking a system in mass production and I
think the idea that they would be tamper proof to be laughable.
Even if you ignore the idea that we are being inconsistent with
the background (assuming we want to move out of just talking about
TNE) by invoke AI transponders being mass produced in
a setting were AI are rare (they even qualify as adventure
seeds), the idea that you can stick a mass produced item and have
it under the constant, unsupervised, control of the same people
who want to tamper with it, and have it be reliable is just not
realistic to me.

I will backtrack on "not one single".  However, measurements, while
related to old ones, do go though change.  I will bow to the post

a much better job of providing examples than I could.

This is a long way from having a complete system of measurement
unchanged for that length of time.  (Heck, it isn\'t even a
system of measurement and it is not even a standard that all
railroads follow).

Andy, that was a rhetorical question.  ;-p

I had commented that the wedges (Rupert it was the wedge more than
the sidewall I had in mind) prevented anything from reaching the
hull by "slowing it down" so much it didn\'t have any effect, and
taking infinite time certainly slows it down...from the light\'s
point of view.  ;->

My take on the Weber Wedge is that they are gravitically induced
singularity planes (areas of infinitely curved space) projected
between Alpha and Beta nodes.  Anything entering that area basically
disappears.  The impulse drive compresses the ship between these
wedges shooting it ahead like a seed squeezed between two fingers.

I speculated that the Weber Fusion Plant was a fusion bomb
compressed within some form of his gravitic magic.  The reaction
occurs at real time within the trap, but is released much more
slowly across the interface.  However, if you drop the gravitic trap
the reaction proceeds as per normal...this gives you the "damage the
plant, plant go boom" effect.

All just magical handwaving, though. ;->

GURPS Traveller Review

   Traveller is not so much a game _system_ so much as a game
environnment. Few other RPG\'s in existence have as richly detailed
setting. GURPS Traveller pays deep and respectful homage to this fact.
The bulk of the book is devoted to source material for the game setting.

   In character it is most like Classic/Megatraveller, covering what is
to most of us familiar ground: The Third Imperium, ca: 1116. Unlike
MegaTraveller, though, the pivotal event has not taken place: the
assasination of Emperor Strephon, and the subsequent collapse of the
Imperium into internecine warfare and rebellion. This is Traveller set
in the Classic \'Golden Age\' of Traveller.

    Great care has been taken throughout the rulebook to include players
from other editions of the game; conversion rules are included to
convert characters, ships, worlds and other GM material from other
editions to the GURPS standard, and truthfully, there\'s little
conversion to be done, as the two systems are truly more alike than not.

    The book is divided into roughly three sections: Background and
Library data, Character generation, and Ship design and operation.

Anyone who\'s perused the MT Imperial Encyclopedia will be familiar with
the first section (about 70 pages); most all of \'canon\' Traveller is
represented there. Almost more valuable than the actual library entries
themselves, are the copious sidebars, which make up roughly a third of
the page; these range from descriptions of K\'Kree religious practice, to
a history of the Ziru Siirka, to miscellaneous quotes and adventure
tidbits, to a Vilani Lightbulb joke.

There are also a number of peeks into the minds of the designers,
gleaned from the experience of sopmeone who was there. For instance, the
reason they stuck the \'i\' on solomani and humaniti is primarily from one
of Marc\'s earlier wargames \'Eagles\', about the Roman occupation of the
Rhine frontier. Marc just liked the way the Latinization of the German
tribe names sounded: Suebii, Hermandurii, Langobardii. Hence Vilani,
Zhodani, and Solomani. True to the tradition of GDW books, a wealth of
detail is implied in a number of these little sidebars, giving a
perceptive GM many ideas and routes to take their players. 

    The second section is Character generation. Here the differences in
gaming systems are quite pronounced, as GURPS is entirely choice driven,
rather than chance driven as is Traveller. A brief description of the
differences is in a sidebar, and the last chapter of the book is given
over to a detailed comparison and conversion process for existing
characters. The rest of the character section is given over to templates
for a number of different character types roughly equivalent to
Traveller careers (more than MT, fewer than TNE), and an equipment
catalog, which is briefer than, say, the section in the MegaTraveller
players handbook, more like that from the LBB\'s. 

The book suggests getting GURPS UltraTech books 1 and 2 as supplements,
as well as using the listings in the basic rules for lower tech
equipment. There is a fairly detailed discussion of the use of equipment
from other GURPS sourcebooks, and some more on converting existing
Traveller equipment.

    The third section, including three appendices, is about starships.
This has a brief section on common starships, including nicely executed
deckplans for the Sulieman-class scout, and the now famous Beowulf class
free trader. Detailed statistics are available for a number of other
common ships, again, like those in Megatraveller and the little black
books: The Empress Marava far trader, two examples of a yacht, a safari
ship, a lab ship, a subsidized trader, and a number of non-starships
(all those gigs and pinnaces) and some vehicles. These seem to be
straightforward ports of the classic Traveller ships into GURPS terms, a
very useful tool for those doing conversions of their own designs.
Following this is a design sequence so that you can build your own. This
is a modular system, like Book 2 or QSDS. Modules were developed using
GURPS Vehicles 2nd Ed. and custom modules can be designed using that
source. This is what was promised, yet never quite gelled with FFS2,
QSDS, and SSDS. The third appendix is a starship combat system.

   Now to the big question: should everyone run out and buy this book?
The only people who won\'t benefit from this book are those who don\'t
plan a GURPS campaign, and already own the Imperial Encyclopedia. Little
if any of the information in this book is new. That will come later, in
the ongoing sourcebooks to come. If you want to move an existing
Traveller campaign to the GURPS system, then, of course, this is an
essential source, within the limitations of the story line. For the
non-GURPS player this is still a huge source of information for the
Traveller universe that is now in print for the first time in years.

    What of someone buying this new, without a background in Traveller?
In that case they\'ll get a densely detailed universe in which to place a
game, but no real sense of the grander conflicts in place in the
Traveller game universe, or how to integrate a game into them. Then
again, GURPS has always been a sort of do-it-yourself kind of game, this
is not a lot different from other GURPS source books. Still, a sample
adventure or two, and some more directions would be beneficial for first
timers. This, I hope, will be rectified in further sourcebook releases.
This is really a book for those who know and love Traveller already.

    What GURPS Traveller _really_ signifies is a return to the
mainstream for the Traveller game universe...Steve Jackson Games has
said this is first in a line of Traveller books, and the Spinward
Marches book is soon to come out. There are tantalizing hints of
intrigue and adventure hooks in the ongoing posts on the SJG web site,
promising the continuation of the rich history that Traveller, the game,
has become.

    After the disappointment that T4 engendered (so much promise, so
many _good_ things, mixed with such rubbish that it left a bad taste in
the mouth.) GURPS Traveller makes me feel as though the game has gotten
a fresh start. It feels like Traveller, as T4 did not in many ways. Time
will tell, but if the subsequent sourcebooks and supplements are of the
quality of this book, things look bright indeed. This is a helluva good
job, Loren!

    If you want to move to GURPS Traveller as your main system, you\'ll
need, at the least, GURPS Lite, the brief synopsis of the rules,
available at www.sjgames.com Recommended additions are the Basic Rules,
GURPS Vehicles, and the aforementioned UltraTech books.

Yes,  If I owned a very expensive ship or was captain of said ship I\'d
invest a small amount of money (compared to the cost of the ship) in remote
detonated claymores.  I\'d place 2 one on each side of each airlock out of
line of sight from the outside and disguised and something mudane and inert
and defend not with standard auto weapons but with hidden ceiling mounted,
independantly powered GATLING lazer cannons with multiview and milimeter
radar imaging in armored universal turrent over ever hatch.  I\'d also send
the crew freed up from defence by these proceedure to attack the enemy ship
with plazma genades and shaped charges placed on weapon mounts, power
systems, and the manuvering jets.  Once these were disabled I pull away and
let the defense globes mop up the boarders.  A good alternative to using
your crew to attack is small \'bomb bots\' with lazers and limpet mines.  They
can be stored for long peroids of time with minimal cost.  Properly designed
they could also work in mundane jobs like stewards, goffers, maintainences
units or lite cargo movers.

Never give the enemy a break unless it\'s to your advantage to do so...

THEY......ARE......NOT.....A...I..\'s!

<incohherent obscene Cartman ranting here>

</Cartman voice mode>

They are a LIFEFORM, like a rabbit, or a fungus, or a fish. They just
_happen_ to be made of silicon and EM signals instead of carbon and
electrochemical signals, and have followed an evolutionary path that
enables them to use our electronics as a niche to live in.

This is the absolutely KEY thing to understand about Deyo transponders,
Cymbeline chips and Virus. If you don\'t grasp this, none of it makes
sense, any more than trees would if you had no concept of DNA based
life. ("What, you put this itty bitty round thing in the ground, give it
water and sunlight, and it turns into THAT!??!! And it\'s all because of
the arrangement of these four molecules in a line? Ahh bull*t!! Get the
f*k OUT of here!")

IMO this is the same error that Imperial scientists made the moment they
started playing with them, that because they are _of_ technology, they
_are_ technology, and controllable. In fact, they obey every rule of
evolution that the average 3I biologist could have told those people,
had they ever been consulted, which they weren\'t. These were electronic
chips, who needs to talk to a biologist? Hence we got nifty unforgeable
transponders that were a deadly route into the ship when the nastier
predators we managed to breed got loose and decided to eat them, and all
the other electronics around them.

Of course, everyone just accepts it when there\'s talk of tailored
plagues and viruses (the _wet_ kind) set loose during the black
wars...we know _all_ about DNA based biological warfare...yet we can\'t
seemm to accept that they did the _very same thing_ with an electronic
life form.

I thought sure you\'d put a hedge of pikemen behind the gunmen to
hold the boarders off long enough for another round or two...a short
delay is all you need for those autoguns to squeeze off a few more
rounds.  ;-> Of course, if you\'ve got shields that gunfire can\'t
penetrate then we\'re back to "hack and slash"...or plasma/fusion
guns. ;-p

And, of course, the only "break" worth giving an enemy:

An avenue of retreat.

People who have no way out do desperate things. Desperate
things can cause expensive damage to the upholstery inside
your starship, or the crew thereof.

A problem, though: in most cases, if you are getting boarded
you have lost the space battle and cannot get away. Winning
the boarding action - I mean winning it all the way to the
bridge of the enemy ship - may be the only way to end up
on a ship that can get you home. Just driving off the enemy
may leave you in proud possession of a crippled spacegoing
tomb. 

If I were leading a boarding party, BTW, the _last_ place I\'d
choose for entry would be an airlock. Visions of the fake airlock
with a several-Megajule laser cannon behind it (as seen in an
old White Dwarf article on repelling boarders) would be just loom
too large in my mind.

Civilian ships, for various aesthetic reasons, often have windows.
Even if the shutters are up, these areas are often weaker...and there
may be too many areas like this for the crew to defend. Battle damage
holes may also be useful, as long as they aren\'t too radioactive or
otherwise dangerous. The best place is where the crew doesn\'t
expect you to come in at all.

As for someone else\'s mention that you could "hear" the enemy moving
around on the hull - that\'s a pretty thick hull. You could probably
hear them blasting or cutting away at it, though...if you were
crazy enough to still have air in your ship at this point.

My take on the grav bands is not that they disperse the beam energy, but they

They are a LIFEFORM, like a rabbit, or a fungus, or a fish. They just
_happen_ to be made of silicon and EM signals instead of carbon and
electrochemical signals, and have followed an evolutionary path that
enables them to use our electronics as a niche to live in.

This is the absolutely KEY thing to understand about Deyo transponders,
Cymbeline chips and Virus. If you don\'t grasp this, none of it makes
sense, any more than trees would if you had no concept of DNA based
life. ("What, you put this itty bitty round thing in the ground, give it
water and sunlight, and it turns into THAT!??!! And it\'s all because of
the arrangement of these four molecules in a line? Ahh bull*t!! Get the
f*k OUT of here!")

IMO this is the same error that Imperial scientists made the moment they
started playing with them, that because they are _of_ technology, they
_are_ technology, and controllable. In fact, they obey every rule of
evolution that the average 3I biologist could have told those people,
had they ever been consulted, which they weren\'t. These were electronic
chips, who needs to talk to a biologist? Hence we got nifty unforgeable
transponders that were a deadly route into the ship when the nastier
predators we managed to breed got loose and decided to eat them, and all
the other electronics around them.

Of course, everyone just accepts it when there\'s talk of tailored
plagues and viruses (the _wet_ kind) set loose during the black
wars...we know _all_ about DNA based biological warfare...yet we can\'t
seemm to accept that they did the _very same thing_ with an electronic
life form.

          Everything I ever read or was told about the VIRUS was that it
      was caused by a group of scientists working with the semi-sentient
      crystals used in imperial computers.  They created a virus that was
      supposed to take over a ships computer, and render it helpless so
      that there forces could then take the ship, repair any minor damages,
      and use it in the war.  They messed up.  The virus caused the
      crystals to become sentient, and they went on a rampage.  Thus was
      born the Viral AI computers.  If they had not played with the
      crystals they would still be working away today.  The most
      frightening element of the TNE setting, is that they still use those
      crystals in their computer systems (required for any computer systems
      over 9 but under 17) and so run the risk of Virus infection every
      time they encounter another ship.

My take on the grav bands is not that they disperse the beam energy, but they
"bend" the beam so that it misses the ship entirely...sidewalls do the same
thing, but are not as powerful, so are easier to punch thru for the beam.

Gold Rush Games is a company that publishes third-party supplements for
some games. Most recently they have made a splash with their new campaign
setting for Champions - San Angelo: City of Heroes.

Mark Arsenault mentioned to me that he had been trying to negotiate a
licencing agreement for Traveller products for some time. He apparently
has material ready to publish if he were to be able to get the green
light. I was hoping this would go through, since it would provide a US
based provider / distributor for Traveller.

Their products seem to be of high quality both editorially and
cosmetically.

http://members.aol.com/_ht_a/goldrushg/index.htm

I assume that there is some legal hold-up for the whole affair, but I
don\'t know any of the specifics.

While these books are things that I think people may want to get,
you can get by without them.  Heck, if you wanted to, you could, if
you are flexible, squeek by with GURPS Traveller and GURPS
Lite, the free version you can download (at least for a while).
With just GURPS Basic and GURPS Traveller you, at most, might
end up having to make up a skill or two yourself (if that).

Something with "common scents."  :-D

When I was at Ft. Benning, an USAF type explained the joys of hooking such
a system up to an AC-130 Spectre.

Using a Mk19 AGL would make sense, but I was thinking of the advantage of
having a nearly soldi line of tracers reaching the enemy position.

The problem with them being singularities is that the ship that \'owns\' the
wedges can use sensors through them because they now the exact geometry and
gradient of them. For this to be at all useful the light coming through the
wedges can\'t be slowed up significantly. This doesn\'t stop more powerful
fields being used in the reactors, though.

While it is true that in the rest of the world few civilians own handguns,
in many European countries (excluding England) many people own rifles and
shotguns, and here in New Zealand the firearms ownership rate is very high
(though it is difficult to get a licence to legally own a pistol or a
"Military Style Semi-Automatic" rifle), but dropping due to the government
making it harder and more expensive to own a weapon. A word for those who
think this is a good idea - most of the now illegal weapons haven\'t been
surrendered or sold to those who are still allowed to own them, but have
instead dissappeared (this happened in Australia, too), so all it has done
is put more guns in the hands on the bad guys.

Ob Trav: Has anyone ever noticed how peeved players get when they land on a
high Law Level world and find that every shady character but them has a gun?

Yes, but..

I\'ve collect GURPS books for years, so I already have all the books
mentioned, along with a few (dozen) others.  Traveller/Illuminati anyone?

For someone who has just spent close to $50 on the GURPS rule book and
GURPS Traveller to be told that he really needs to spend another $80 on
supplements to really enjoy the game could leave some people cold.

You mean your PCs give up their guns just because it\'s a high law level world?
Obviously they aren\'t truly shady characters (truly talented shady characters
smuggle their guns onto the world, along with enough extra guns to make a tidy
profit selling them to the local shady characters).  Seriously, in high law
level worlds where there is actually enough enforcement to prevent PCs from
getting guns there\'s probably also enough enforcement that a significant
fraction of the shady characters won\'t have guns either.

I truely believe that there is a growth in the rebirth of gaming. Black clad
gothes have offered me the best role-playing that I had in years. They don\'t
worry about buying equipment or how big the plasma rifle is. They are all in
to charater. If you can tear a card player away from the cards long enough
they have good wargame statagies and know about attrition(Sp) and how to win
battles in the long run. Old school gamers we are have helped to create both
these groups and many more. just last weekend my Traveller group did a
little popcorn throwing.

CCG\'s is a good way to get ppl hooked on the concept of gaming. Do you
honestly remeber those first games?  The hours of charater creation and the
boredom? and the book passing? Remember We where younger then and didn\'t
have the money to buy multicopies of the same book. Cards are cheap and
after cards you may find a role-playing game in that genra.. and a wargame.
I hate to bring this up but look at AEG\'s Legand of the Five rings game...
it started as a card game.

I would expect that, given the right equipment (which would be standard
issue in _my_ Navy!), you could triangulate movement on the outside of
the hull through induced vibration, at least well enough to assemble a
fair portion of your defensive personnel and firepower.  (Anyone who
neglects to maintain at least _some_ reserve deserves what he/she/it

When I was at Ft. Benning, an USAF type explained the joys of hooking such
a system up to an AC-130 Spectre.

Using a Mk19 AGL would make sense, but I was thinking of the advantage of
having a nearly soldi line of tracers reaching the enemy position.

Why? If Steve Jackson Games are not going to support anything post-Classic
Traveller, it would be more correct (and then marginally so) to say ...

"I guess for many old-time players the rebellion and collapse will always be
remembered"

GURPS Traveller *is* the "official" world now. Check their author want list ...
they\'ve got masses of Traveller stuff there, and nary a mention of the rebellion
and virus. I think it is extremely likely that rebellion and virus are dead for
all time. Ergo, whether people like it or not, the Classic Traveller background
is *again* the "official world".

>4th edition fits in this (another alternate timeline?), I have no idea.

T4 was a sign that the rebellion and virus were dead. GURPS Traveller is the
final nail in their coffin.

Personally, I always liked the idea of the rebellion ... it gave great scope for
adventures; virus, on the other hand, was just downright stupid and an insult to
the intelligence (and, no, if you don\'t know why that\'s my opinion of virus, I\'m
*not* going to get into a flamewar with *anyone* ... my opinions are pretty
widely known, and you either agree or disagree with them already).

However, like all of us, GURPS Traveller is a chance to continue with whatever
background that we wish to ... if you want to continue in the world of the
Rebellion, fine; if you want to <shudder> continue with the world of virus, also
fine.

*NEW* Players, however, who will hopefully soon outnumber the old players on
this list, will see *their* version of Traveller as the "one true way" for the
most part.

Ok let us look at this from a *different* view then.....

Case 1: The "ChatterBox" chip has to have continuous communications outside
the ship, or it suffers communication meltdown. 

Counter Case 1: Then it will meltdown when the ship goes into jump space
then...

Counter Case 1a: The ship transporting newly made "Chatter Box\' chips has
to let them all talk at once, and the *breeding center* also to let them
"chatter" at will. "Talk a about a Spoo Herding"<G>

Case 2: The "Chatter Box" chip does not meltdown in jump space but is
somehow *aware* of what jump space is and can accept the no communications
link for a time.

Counter Case 2: If the CB chip can tolerate no commo for a time then it can
be used to *defeat* the CB chip\'s functions. Ie turn the comm link when
going some place you do not want it to exchange info with any other CB
boxes. Then *dummy* up the ships log to show reason for such ie
communications failure or power malfunctions.

Ok how installs them in starships new and old,, robots?, no I say sentient
technicians with the *right* tools and skills. The direct link to the
communications has to be connected then tested. Also the power connections
have to be connected and tested.

Also keeping a "Chatter Box" circuit a *secret* would not even be possible. 
1. Some military personnel would have some knowledge of CB Black Boxes
2. A competent commo operator could tell the that comm channels 12a and 17c
are in use, but by anyone on board. During those long jump space times the
comm tech(s) could trace the down the *unknown* user of comm channels.
After that the knowledge starts getting spread around.

Ok then who tells the CB BB its new ship\'s ID then surely not the human

The tech(s) don\'t have to know squat about what\'s inside it would help but
it would not be needed.

Assumption 1: The CB circuit is less powerful than a average ships computer.
Assumption 2: The CB circuit is only *directly* tied into the commo system.
Assumption 3: The CB circuit has no way of telling what is outside it\'s
black box.
Assumption 4: The CB circuit has no way a knowing which other CB\'s are in
comm range, the only way for it to find out is to transmit and await and
answer.

Ok here it comes, 
First thing the techs do is isolate the CB from the ship\'s comm system most
likely during jump.
Second install a *second* commo system tied directly to the CB chip\'s BB.
The second commo system(phantom)is a dummy system of such quality the
limited Intel CB can not tell it from the real thing.
Third tie a *powerful* separate computer into the *phantom* comm system.
Then basically put the CB BB into a *virtual reality* of the techs
choosing, thus giving the CB BB the desired info. Since the CB BB is un
forgeable the *new* info that the CB BB will be given out will accepted as
*Holy Gospel*.

In the above example  the BB was not broken into just given a different
perspective.

The wishlist seems a little expansive to me.  I really wish they could get
the Major Alien races into 1 volume.  Perhaps I\'m too much a fan of
the Alien Encyclopedia.  But I think in 20 pages/race you could give enough
detail for players and referees, instead of totally postponing non-humaniti
chargen to upcoming supplements (which don\'t even have contracts done).

Guess I\'ll use some of the pre-G:T Traveller-Gurps conversion stuff on
the web.

I don\'t see the Rebellion as invalidating CT at all.  AAMOF, the Rebellion is 
alive & kicking in my CT campaign, \'Candles Against The Night\'.  As for Virus, 
well, that\'s a different story.

T4 was Traveller \'In The Beginning\'.  Us fossils knew the history of the *end* 
of the Imperium, here was our chance to get things steamengining at the 
*beginning* of the Imperium.  It in no way invalidated the Rebellion or Virus, 
just shoved them about 1100 years into the future.

CT still works for me.  It may be old, but there\'s *still* some life left in 
it.

And we\'ll be stuck educating them about their unknown past and chuckle at them
when they use American units of measurement rather than metric for their boat
designs.  Fun, fun, fun.

I was really hoping that they\'d do this like they did the GURPS: Diskworld
that just came out.  It really impressed me by having GURPS Lite in the
back of the book.

What really irritates me is stating you need Compendium I, isn\'t it
currently out of print?!?!?  I do know that it isn\'t always available.
That isn\'t the kind of book you should require.  It took me a year to get a
copy of GURPS Vehicles because it was out of print.

Having said that the only book listed above I don\'t have is the GURPS
Marital Arts.  I can see GURPS Ultra-Tech and Ultra-Tech 2 as being very
good books to have, for all that goes, I think any of the Tech books are
good to have, even if you\'re not playing GURPS!

I think I can sum it up in one sentence.  Great list of books, but how many
are currently available?

Through the wedge?  Really?  I thought a couple of tactical

Weber is pretty clear on the fact that the owning ship *can* see through
them.  The only times Honor has not been able to do so is when she has her
ship shot up badly.

Come to think of it...that\'s pretty often!  :)

My three years of martial arts training (and actually trying out the MT
combat rules after 3 years of not usinh them) says you\'re right on all
points. :-)  I freely admit to being a bit of a Bruce Lee geek.

One HTH rule I dropped was the roll to see if a character could attack.
This seemed to be, IMO, an unnecessary complication because, again IMO,
if the attack roll is successful then the character obviously had the
chance to attack. If the roll wasn\'t successful, the reason for failure
isn\'t that relevant.

They are most certainly NOT used in the New Era.  The Free Traders that have
survived were in ships either too low tech (TL10-) or ones that made a
decision to disconnect or otherwise remove/destroy their transponders during
the Rebellion and Hard Times.  The Domain of Deneb "protected themselves"
presumably by yanking out all their black boxes and going to a simpler, more
fallable kind of transponder.  The Reformation Coalition and the various
pocket empires are either doing new construction and using an alternative
transponder style or went the route of the Free Traders and/or Regency.

No, it only has to have continuous and unimpared access to the comm systems
(using whatever frequencies are unused) and w/ the main computers and
databanks.
The tamper circuit fires (melting down the chips) if the black box is
disconnected from these.  So the transponder is chattering the whole time in
jump space, just noone else is there to hear.  The transponder doesn\'t have to
*hear* conversation.  They don\'t chatter before their connected to a comm
system (anymore than a person chatters endlessly in his skull- yes some people
do that more than others<g>).

Black boxes are installed as one piece.  Something breaks in there, the whole
thing is taken out and a whole new black box is put in as a replacement.  If
these techs disconnect it there should be some kind of log for that and they
replace the *whole* black box.  They don\'t open it up.  One of the compaints
of tank mechs for the M1Ax series MBTs is that too much is electronic and in
"black box format."  Nothing is top secret (except the composition and
structure of the DU armor, but i digress), but if, for example, something in
the fire control system breaks, the whole lil fire control "black box" is
pulled out (it\'s a bit more complicated than that, but that\'s the gist of it).
They don\'t work on the electronic subsystems but ship them to a central
location.

> Also keeping a "Chatter Box" circuit a *secret* would not even be possible.
> 1. Some military personnel would have some knowledge of CB Black Boxes

mmm... no.  They do the same thing that techs do.  It\'s more than possible to
open up a black box.  Doing so just melts the SDG chip and it\'s control chip
(by which it measures its mutations).  There would well be some members of the
General Staff (and others w/ a Need to Know) who would know, but very few
others.  Everyone who tries only finds burned and melted chips (and learn they
need to buy a new transponder system and maybe face fine/imprisonment).

So what?  Everyone knows that the black box will have unimpeded access to
commo.  Noone knows what\'s inside the black box.  Every one that\'s opened up
has two pieces of slag amidst the electronic connections and maybe the tamper
circuit (though i\'d have the tamper get burned, too).  How do either of those
two points indicate theirs a semi-AI-lifeform in the black box?  They don\'t.

Noone.  Their transponder breaks.  They put in a new black box.  This isn\'t
complicated at all.  Some lowly spacehand is probably doing the installation
too (supervised most likely, w/ a superior checking it).  It should be pretty
simple to know if your transponder is operating or not.

It\'s tied to the computer too.  Unimpeded access to both the communications
system and main computers&databanks.  Any break in these fires the tamper
circuit, which melts the sensitive chips (if not the tamper, as well), as does
any breech in the black box itself.

Only if the box is opened and/or access to the comm systems and computer is
disrupted.

And they\'re *always* either broadcasting or tightbeaming based on whatever
comm systems are available.

Then the tamper circuit fires and the SDG chip is melted, as is it\'s control

The moment the system is broken from the real commo, it is destroyed and won\'t
broadcast.  The BBs home port tells them their transponder is not broadcasting
and a new one needs to be installed.  It could always be arranged to hook the
black box through the "vr" system to the real comm system.  When u want it to
"mute" you shut it up, but it keeps operating.  Maybe the same from computers.
The point is is doable and desirable that it be allowed to "mute" but there is
no way to truly disconnect it or discover what\'s inside w/o destroying it,
other than espionage and corruption.  Having a limited # of
production/assembly facilities for the black boxes (if even more than one)
under heavy security and supervision solves those problems.

Not strictly AI, but "semi AI."  The transponder systems are *not* AI until

It is quite "realistic" (as much as the rest of Traveller is) unless u can
find a way to successfully tamper other than an espionage run into Research

outnumber the target ship\'s crew. As for boarding weapons,
I prefer frag grenades from multi-round grenade launchers.
Admittedly, this will damage the corridors and some 
equipment between decks but such damage is more easily 
repairable than characters.

From the defender\'s point of view, I\'d reduce atmospheric
pressure throughout most of the ship to a Thin/Very Thin
level to minimize the effects of decompression and concussive
effects of any explosives, then close/lock all doors/iris
valves, etc. The best time to do such a thing is before power
is lost. Of course, a few claymores linked to doors/valves
and set to go off when the door/valve is forced open is a
nice touch. ;-) Keep in mind that the attackers will need
to secure their rear by confirming nothing is lurking
behind every door they pass. Of course, this can be done
simply by spraying a fast drying epoxy on each door
and surrounding door frame.

If the attacker is dumb enough to link ships, the defender
may want to consider doing whatever it takes to slow down
the boarding party(ies) within the defending ship, then
exit the defending ship and carry an attack to the outside
of the boarders\' ship.

The best thing for an attacker to do is to stamd off with his
ship and approach the defending ship in small craft. The small
craft gets everyone to the target at the same time and
provides some protection from small arms fire. Two or more
teams should force entry some distance apart with the #1
target being Engineering. Another one to two teams should
stay outside to guard against the defender sneaking outside
for a counterattack and to act as reinforcements or a rear
guard in case things get a little too hot inside.

IMO, if the defender can take the fight to the attacker, the
defender has a chance. If not, well...static defenses are
pretty useless against tech.

From what I\'ve read, it bends xrays due to the intense and changing gravity 
gradient in the wedge.  The onboard computer, knowing how the wedge is raised 
and its gradient, can descramble sensor readings.

The GURPS Basic Set has a short section (pp. 165-176) on psionics that
should be quite adequate for GURPS Traveller.  Keep in mind that GURPS 
Traveller places limitations on the default GURPS rules in order to
keep with the flavor of earlier Traveller games.

today. The sequence itself is a lot like CT and a pencil, paper and
calculator CAN work (I can\'t wait for Andy Akins to get his copy
though....). The problem comes when trying to translate the numbers into a
deck plan format. According to the "Creating Deckplans" side bar a \'space\'
from the design system equals 4 hexes. Ok, but when you look at the bridge
discription (in the Starship Operations section) they state that a Basic
Bridge (1 space/4 \'yards\') contains 5 workstations and a Command Bridge (2
spaces/8\'yards\') contains 10. Concidering that a hex is equivalant to 1 yard
I find this awfully cramped.

It appears, if you look at the deckplans printed in the book, that the
designers felt this way as well. Both the type S and Freetrader are listed
as having a Basic Bridge, both show TWO workstations and both take up
conciderably more than 4 hexes.

Of course I may be reading something wrong. One thought was that the bridge
module needs to be multiplied by the number of stations installed ( ie a
WORK STATION equals 1 bridge module, up to 5 for Basic or up to 10 for
Command) but then why don\'t they state it that way?

If anyone sees something I didn\'t, please let me know since I\'m working on a
conversion and deck plans for an Imperiallines Frontier Transport for GT and

Under Wound Effects on Inititive on p264 it says a slight wound
reduces Inititive by 1, by 3 when seriously wounded, and by 5 when
critically wounded.  Since most PC\'s are going to have inititives of
3 (or so) a serious wound would effectively stop them (no actions)
even if it doesn\'t drop them.

Sounds like all I need to do to shut off my transponder is turn off all

If I want to look inside the black box, I scan it with a high-grade

gear available that will make that box effectively invisible.

Unless IYTU these Black Boxes are really, really cheap, this will not
work. People will have to replace their black boxes all the time - every
time the computer on their spacecraft reboots, every time they take
minor damage in space combat, every time they need to maintain
the communications array. Even a blown fuse will melt the Black Box.

If any of these things don\'t cause the Black Box to melt, then the

by any of these can be simulated (faked) and used to switch the
BB\'s inputs to a faker box and the BB\'s outputs to nowhere.

Anyone who tells you that is mistaken.  For example, I don\'t have
GURPS psionics and have had no problem running GURPS Traveller.
I was doing it before GURPS Compendium ever came out.  I did
use Space but could have gotten by without it.  These things
are useful but hardly required.  All you really need is Basic
and you could probably even squeek by with GURPS Lite if you want
to give it a shot.

can\'t recall any direct references to them, but have a look through some
back issues of JDW, IDR, MilTech or have a look in the most recent
edition of Jane\'s Security and Counter-Insurgency Equipment.

On the AC-130, it is most definitely only usable in a benign air
environment, be this from either a GBAD or air-based threat.  Whilst the
more recent versions have a fairly full platform protection suite (RWR,
laser detectors, chaff and flare dispensers), they are really intended for
use in an environment where they shoot at people who can\'t shoot back.  My
understanding is that they are not _really_ liked by the USAF hierarchy
(as indeed, is all of the capabilities contained in USAF SOC), because
they are seen as peripheral to _real_ USAF missions (global reach and
air/space superiority), and also because they are mainly emplouyed in
support of Army SOF missions.  Mind you, given that the current CJCS was
formerly commander USSOCOM, SO/LIC has a higher profile in the US DOD than
at any time since the Reagan years and the passage of the
Goldwater-Nichols Act.

Doh! Confused! always stick with your first answer (first law of trivial
pursuit). I actually wrote it as zero, but then realised that there are
two uses of Tau a normal and an inverse. I KNEW that length shrinks, and
(brainstorm) thought that must mean that time grows. Of course, it\'s
MASS that goes to infinity using the inverse Tau.

Please see my earlier apology to Eris while I remove my gripping hand
from my mouth as well.

Please explain why my statement is "not true". I put the "theoretically" in
to sidestep cases like time travel or Einstein\'s hidden variables.

What is not true, however, is that both sender and receiver must "know the
secret". In public key cryptography the \'secret\' for encryption and
decryption are different; knowing one is of no use in determining the other.

The entire point of using non-reproducible methods for generating secrets
is exactly so that only the sender knows it. The secret for *decoding* the
message can be broadcast freely.

Please inform me of how PGP can "be broken". I suspect Phil Zimmerman, RSA
Data Securities, and the NSA would love to know as well.

I\'m not sure how to respond to your claim that "anything concieved by man
can be bested by man". People have been conceiving of perpetual motion
machines for centuries, yet no one has even been able to meet this concept,
let alone "best" it. If someone comes up with an encryption method that
takes, say, twice the lifetime of the universe to decode through brute
force would you say "oh yeah, well I can conceive of one that takes *ten
times* the lifetime of the universe to decode"? At some point the gains
made is not worth the effort expended.

The point of encryption is to make it infeasible to compromise a secret
message sent through public channels. The fact that there are other ways of
compromising messages, like intercepting it before it is encrypted or
corrupting the receiver, does not make cryptography less useful or "broken".

I don\'t know about that.  The last two days, I\'ve been eye-balling the "T"

1 displacement ton/space/4hex can fit 10-12 people. shoulder-to-shoulder.

Well, I had a boarding scenario ready for my players that they never got
around to, so I suppose I can spill the beans.

A planetary defense force captured a suspected smuggler which put up some
resistance. The crew vowed to never surrender and claimed their ship was
full of booby traps. After destroying the maneuvering drive, the defense
ship used some precision laser shots to destroy the sensors,
communications, weapon turrets, and hole the fuel tanks. A launch with some
engineers welded all hatches shut and gave the ship enough of a spin to
force all the fuel out of the tanks. Then they towed the smuggler\'s ship
into a solar orbit; thermal equilibrium is estimated 120 degrees C.

After convicting the smuggler crew in absentia of murder (some engineers
were killed by a missile hit) and registering the ship as salvage, the
defense force decided that 5 years should be enough to calm the crew down;
especially since power to weaponry, life support, and cold berths would
have been gone within a month.

Unexpectedly, 2 years after the boarding, an expeditionary ship from the
expanding Third Imperium jumps in system and, after refuelling, detects the
derelict ship. The derelict does not respond to radio. Rather than inform
the main inhabited system, now on the far side of the sun, our heroes
decide to investigate it themselves...

Yes but there\'s the interesting problem of getting guns once you\'re though
customs and on the other side. IMTU (and most of my other SF games)
starport and customs enforcement tend to be run by the interstellar
governments, and so is often much tougher than dirtside policing (and much
fairer, too). The result is that getting guns into a high law world is
usually rather harder than getting them on-planet. This can lead to fun
situations where the PCs get to all sorts of heavily armed people who know
that they are rich and have no guns - otherwise they wouldn\'t be in the
market for weapons, right?

In _Honor Among Enemies_ Weber explictly states that a ship can see through
its own wedges, but nobody can see through a wedge that belongs to someone
else, because you don\'t know it\'s _exact_ geometry and strength, gradient,

I\'d slag the whole thing so that nobody would know which bit was the top

The problem with this is that you can\'t forge the transponder bable that
the other ships that \'exist\' in your VR should be giving your transponder,
with the result that when you hook it back up it will tell everybody\'s
transponders that it met some fake transponders (at best, at worst it might
realise that it was being fed crap). Even if you do fool it sooner or later
it will come across some fact that will contradict what you fed it, and
then it will come across to other transponders as having been screwed with.

One of the (very few) good things about being in the Soviet Army must have
been that you owned the air force (Frontal Aviation, anyway), and that your
bosses never lost sight of the basic rule of land warfare - everything is
there to support the grunts (however low their status compared to tanks).

That\'s one of the reasons I\'ve never found it that hard to put PCs out of
fights. Another is the knockdown rule - if you take your AGL or more of
damage in one round you get knocked down, and have to make a panic check.
That coupled with stunning for head shots give a reasonable chance for a
one shot KO, IMO. Using TW:2K\'s more aggresive quick kill damge rule helps,
too.

Sure. They put out more energy. But that doesn\'t increase the reaction
rate a lot. It goes up *slowly* as the temp increases. Plus, the higher
temp makes the magnetic bottle "leak" more, thus tending to reduce the
pressure. And if you kill the magnetic field, the *pressure* goes
away and the reaction *stops*. 

Runaway reactions aren\'t *possible* in a fusion reactor. 

Hydrogen bombs work by using a fission bomb to heat and compress the
material you are going to fuse. It\'s a "burst" reaction. Anything that
doesn\'t fuse during the brief pulse of heat and pressure won\'t fuse.

Sorry, wrong answer. While the intro *did* say 5 million tons, it was
pointed out to Strazinsky that given the *size* of B5, the *air* in it
weighs more than that!

He tried to claim that the "5 million tons" was just the outer hull,
but nobody bought it.

You have to realize that B5 is *kilometers* long.

Jason dinAlt managed to learn to use a power holster as an adult (in
the first book). It was a *painful* experience.

I wish I could have gotten permission to take some photos in the
hallway at the plant I used to work in. It was about 2o feet wide, and
the ceiling was at least that high, And everything above the 8 or 9
foot level was layer after layer of pipes, ductwork, and cable
conduits. 

It was a great example. <sigh>

Real world, most ductwork is too *small* to climb thru. In spacecraft,
it\'ll have to have automatic doors whereever it passes thru a pressure
wall. 

And I\'m told that the ductwork on Navy ships and in major underground
installations any ducts big enough to crawl thru have "blades" or
"knives" mounted all over the place to prevent it. They hardly affect
airflow, but it\'d take *hours* to cut them all away in any useful
length of ducting.

On the other hand, in any large ship, there *is* something to be said
for corridors big enough to move medium large chunks of equipment thru.
It makes repairs and refits easier. Remember, the alternative is
cutting away layer after layer of deck and bulkhead.

Sort of like the advice I got about defending against a dog attack. For
medium size dogs, you basicly "feed" them your arm. That gets the arm
shredded some, but also means that their mouth is full. You can then
use the arm as a lever.

Against the *big* dogs, you try to keep them from biting anything
important. Like your neck...

I\'m still not real fond of this, but I\'ve kind of justified it on the
basis that when they fail during battle you get essentially the current
(probably *peak*) output (multiple gigawatts or even terawatts or more)
for one second released. In other words, a 10 terawatt plant would dump
10 terajoules in the form of plasma. That\'s not even *close* to a
nuclear bomb, but it\'s nothing to sneeze at.

Well, this may be yet another case of needing a higher TL to get

From a photon\'s frame of reference *everything* happens at once. Time
does not exist. 

The singularity at the center of a black hole is generaly a
mathematical *point*. Zero size.

What he\'s saying is that the gravity is so intense that it bends light
passing thru. Which is realistic. Since the enemy doesn\'t know the
exact field strength and configuration, they can\'t compensate for the
distortion. So the beams get deflected or defocused. Sort of like
trying to look at the bottom of a pond or stream with lots of ripples. 

The ship *generating* the bands knows the details, so they *can*
compensate. And I bet that it\'s common for even *merchant* vessels to
continually vary the setup by a little bit according to a random
pattern. Easy to set up, hard to do anything about.

You\'ve got the formula wrong. At c, tau = *zero*. 

	tau = sqrt(1-(v^2/c^2))

Therefore:

	tau = sqrt(1-(c^2/c^2))
	tau = sqrt(1-(1))
	tau = sqrt(1-1)
	tau = sqrt(0)
	tau = zero

Because compensating sensor reading merely requires computer
processing. Compensating laser/graser beams would require something
that can change their direction/focus dynamicly. That\'s a *much* taller
order.

Sidewalls are much *weaker*. Enough so that they can\'t completely
defocus a beam that\'s powerful enough. Part of the reason they are
weaker (I\'d think) is that they *can\'t* be allowed create thrust the
way the planes of the impeller wedge do.

But unless those plants are unreasonably powerful, the "boom" should be
equivalent to less than one seconds output. From the way Weber
describes a failure, it seems pretty obvious that he thinks they *do*
act like a big fusion bomb.

Actually, the temperatures in a fusion reactor are far *higher* than in
the sun. That\'s so that we can get away with using pressures we can
handle. The sun\'s core (which is where the fusion reactions occur) is
at far higher pressure than we can reach. Higher than any tech is
likely to be able to *sustain*.

And just to \'stoke the fire\' a little, an interesting fact is that the

The fact that 50% of the world drives on the \'wrong\' (right :-) side of

the region with my dinky little M-21.

>Or is are Spectre operations restricted to low-threat environments?

The nice thing about C-130s is their engines run cool enough that most IR
missiles have a hard time locking on to them.  Dropping flares almost
guarntees no lock.

I really wish the USAF would realizer that while F-16s make excellent
ooh-ahhs at an air show, the job is to support the ground sloggers who are
actually engaging the enemy.  Consider the A-10 Warthog.  By far the best
ground attack plane ever built.  During the Gulf war, these planes took
hundreds of hits from everthing from small arms to SAMs, and kept flying.
One plane lost an entire engine and returned to base!  Between sucking
bullets, they became the terror of the Iraqi Army.  The USAF response?
They want to get rid of the things in favor of more zoomies birds!!!  The
A-10 is the *last* dedicated attack plane in the US arsenal, everything
else is a zoomie conversion.  Grrrrrr....

"external grapple" used on Traveller ships such as the Gazelle and the
Lightning class. It\'s based on the "vehicle hardpoints" idea. Basically, a
grapple masses 0.0001 Mcr times the mass in tons it can carry, and costs
.0002 Mcr times the mass in tons. a ship can have a maximum of (Body
Surface Area x 0.015) tons of material carried this way.

I also have some thoughts on drop tanks. Basically, they are additional
hull space, with additional fuel tankage within, that can be ejected. They
would add to the volume of the ship, and to it\'s surface area as turrets
do. They can be armored, but are usually not armored as well as the ship,
as they are disposable and usually ejected in combat anyway; DR 100 is
usually sufficient.

The reason I bring this up is because I am trying to design a GT version of
the Gazelle Class close escort. I am running into difficulties. The ship
has a 280-ton hull, carries a 20-ton gig, and has 100-ton drop tanks.
It is supposed to do Jump-3 with the tanks, Jump-5 without, and do 3G\'s
with the tanks, 5 G\'s without. Jump fuel is the problem; a ship that does
J-5 at 300 tons (280+20 for the gig, no tanks) requires 150 spaces of jump
fuel. The Gazelle design has 100 spaces fuel internal, 100 in the drop
tanks. This means that if it drops it\'s tanks, it cannot do Jump 5; it only
does 3 parsecs. The reason for the drop tanks is supposed to be so it will
have the fuel to cross places like the Great Rift, albeit at a slower jump
rate. at 280 tons and streamlined, it\'s tough to find space for 50 extra
fuel modules. (it can\'t be done by unstreamlining either but that\'s another
story.

Any suggestions would be appreciated :)

The tunnel network under the Magic Kingdom at Disney World in Orlando is
the same way. In the main cross-park tunnel, the walls are also lined with
pipes. Very impressive to see, especially if you come down from the park

This was intended to show a hole in the original poster\'s reasoning.
If the transponder melts itself when the commo system is turned off,
you can\'t stop your transponder from broadcasting, right? Well,
since directional communication systems are cheap and common,
it\'s easy to have your ship making signals that no one else can hear.

Always-On transponders are a workable idea if, IYTU, the spacelanes
are safe to travel and you never go beyond the bounds of whatever
interstellar authority you\'re using as a campaign background.
It also makes space travel about as exciting as a drive down
a quiet freeway on Earth.

IMO, even if unforgable transponders are part of your campaign,
they should at least have a mute button.

Showing what? A mass of electronics, that\'s all. You can\'t tell by looking at
it that a Deyo chip is a living being, not a chip. You can\'t tell what\'s going
on or reverse engineer the thing unless you can isolate the compnents, which
you can\'t do without breaking the box open. If you _do_ successfully break
open the box, the moment you start tryig to analyze the Deyo chip, yopu\'re
going to come to the conclusion that something went wrong, because the chip
doesn\'t make sense at all. It won\'t, as a static piece of electronic
circuitry, because it _isn\'t_ a static piece of circuitry. How long is it
going to take for your reverse-engineer pirates to make _THAT_ conceptual leap?
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
I\'ll lay you odds that by TL13-15 you\'ll have scanning gear that will let
you map circuit diagrams and possibly electron pathways through that
black box - unless you completely shield the box. I mean _completely_,
so completely that there aren\'t even any input or output feeds - which
would make the tranponder useless.

I know the chips aren\'t AI, but realize that for all intents and purposes
they can be treated as such - they quack, swim and preen feathers,
they are effectively a duck. Deyo chips, due to structural limitations
of the substrate they work on, can _not_ be more complicated than
an artificial silicon-based intelligence - and such things do exist in
the Traveller universe.

Eventually someone will have the right combination of technical
expertise, scientific knowledge and determination to crack the
secret of the Deyo-chip transponder. (I\'d put my bets on the
Hivers or Zhodani governments to do so first, but they might sit
on the information.) Whether this knowledge is sufficient in and
of itself to get around the system is another matter - learning that
someone is using such-and-such a code is often simpler than
cracking said code.

"Hi, I\'m the transponder for the patrol ship _Excelsior_. I just got
installed a week ago at Solevai  Highport, I replaced an outdated
transponder during a maintenance check. I\'ve talked to six other
transponders since I was installed. Oh, you\'ve never heard of any
of those ship\'s transponder chips? Well, they were new installs
as well, they checked out just fine. I see we are closing for boarding,
part of the routine customs checks that patrol cruisers do when
they encounter free traders in backwater systems. Nice talking to
you, transponder from free trader _Fiver\'s Ghost_."

What the crew of free trader _Fiver\'s Ghost_ sees: Patrol Cruiser
_Excelsior_ hails them to stand by for boarding. _Excelsior_
has a working transponder.

What\'s really going on: Corsair _Hunting Horror_ stole or otherwise
acquired a couple dozen unused transponders. They put each one
in a VR network, convinced them that they had just been installed
on a bunch of ships undergoing refit at a legitimate starport. 
The chips talk to each other, seeing each other as traffic at this
simulated starport and traffic pattern.
When the transponder that thinks it\'s in _Excelsior_ thinks it enters
jumpspace, it is dropped out of the VR net - while _Hunting Horror_
is in jumpspace. Enough dummy inputs are still in place so the
_Excelsior_ chip sees _Hunting Horror_ as a patrol cruiser.
As far as transponders are concerned, Patrol Cruiser _Excelsior_
just came out of jumpspace.

The fiction won\'t last long, but that\'s OK - _Hunting Horror_ has
a dozen other chips ready to drop out of the VR network. _Horror_
doesn\'t need to pass for weeks at a time, just sow some momentary
confusion.

All the above takes is a TL13 computer (virtual realities), a shipment
of transponders (these things need to be stocked at every A or B
starport and every Naval or Scout base, as well as every corporate,
private or government shipyard, a shipment will eventually go astray),
and a technician who used to install transponders (there will be hundreds
of thousands of people like this). The transponders in your VR net
live boring lives, seldom go anywhere and don\'t talk to many ships,
but that won\'t show up as fake - the Deyo chip in a Free Trader that
only visits low-tech worlds may go months seeing only a handful of
starships, may even spend six months grounded on some dirtball
making repairs, but that Deyo chip will still read as legitimate.

I wonder - how smart are Deyo chips? How much information are
they supposed to have access to? They are deliberately dumb,
they may only know how to say "I\'m an untampered Deyo chip,
installed in a ship with this unique Imperial registration number".
Or can they rattle off every ship they\'ve ever squawked, how long
they were in normal space in which system, etc?

I\'d go with the former, if I used these things.

  Real world, most ductwork is too *small* to climb thru. In spacecraft,
  it\'ll have to have automatic doors whereever it passes thru a pressure
  wall. 

Real world, you\'re not quite right.
I\'ll grant, you are probably right for small installations, military
installations (large ones have knives, etc. as you mentioned -- they
actually improve the airflow, I hear, by keeping dust from settling as
easily), and spacecraft (which would have pressure-tight seals).


At MIT, there are hackers (not the computer type, the practical joke
type -- the ones who do things like put police cars, complete with a
ticket ("no permit for this location") and a box of donuts, on the
great dome) who enjoy getting into places they\'re not supposed to be,
and finding places which don\'t appear on maps.  They crawl around in
ductwork reasonably often.  And these are real world buildings.

ObTrav:
Have your characters ever visited in institute for educating the
_extremely_ gifted?  The kind of place Famile Spoofalum (sp?) might
send their kids to learn the finer points of advanced physics?

I recall a game where we did.  It was complete with the screensaver of
the Energizer bunny walking across a monitor, Jumping to the next,
going on.  And a reprogrammed pizza delivery robot.


Real World, but certainly modifiable to Trav:
Then there\'s the building next door, which houses Genzyme.  People
started getting headaches.  They eventually investigated the ducts and
found something green growing in them.  Last I knew, they didn\'t
know what it was (as in, couldn\'t determine the zoological
classification).

"theoretically" has nothing to do with it.  Sender aand reciever must have a
common frame of reference to encode and decode period.  If you were to use a
true \'radomizer\' to generate the key then you would have to transmit the key
to decode the message making it decodable by anyone.

I don\'t think so.  The encoding key is transmited in the clear.  The
decoding key is kept by the creater of the coding section key.  That is IF
you are using a public key incryption scheme like PGP.  The public key is
the encrypt key only.

PGP can and has been \'broken\'.  Mr. Zimmerman has written about the
\'breakability\' of PGP.  It is called \'Pretty Good Privacy\' after all not
\'Perfect Privacy\'.  Check the crypto news groups for various ways/methods .
The NSA can already break PGP it just takes time if the users are very
carefull.  If they are sloppy it gets easier with each additional message
using the same encode key.  Also the NSA has the advantage of having working
copies of the incryption software to decompile and analize for pattern
recognition.  The key would be decyphered one character at a time as \'hits\'
occured.  If even a single \'clear phrase\' were know the time required would
drop dramaticly and any good inteligence agency would soon learn what key
phrases to watch for in the messages of a particular group od comunication.
If a clear text copy of a message were captured then getting the key will be
almost automatic if the key is not changed.  That is why the military uses
\'one use\' section keys.  The reuse of codes is what broke \'Enigma\' in WW2
and it was broken by brute force HUMAN number crunchers.


Note that \'breaking\' one PGP section does not let you read every message
sent with PGP.  Just those sent with the same public/private ket that you
\'broke\'.

I did not say cryptography was "broken".  It is quite posible to send
messages that can not be decoded in time to make them usefull.  This can be
done with a simple exchange code and does not require a cypher.  I said that
incryption was far from infallable in sending data secretly.  A simple
message like "run" can be hinden in normal conversation with an exchange
code like that used for baseball signals but data has to the incrypted and
unless the key is truely random and longer than the data it can be broken in
time.  Remember that the sender and reciever must have enough computer power
to run the cryptography software.  If the software is simple enough to run
on a protable and publicly available then a super main frame will break the
code in \'time\'.  With \'time\' being related soully to computing power and
power of the software used.

And exactly how does it KNOW that is has been disconnected form the comm
circuit or the main computer?  What sences does it use?  What instraments?
You keep giving these BBs ESP.  HOW does it do these things?  The BB\'s
perceptions are limited to it\'s sences and/or instramentation.  What is it\'s
method of verification?  What if the BB was attached not to a real comm unit
and computer when it was FIRST installed?  Would think that this was what is
to be expected from this ship and just except it?  How could it tell the
difference?

All too true.  The infallable black box is not practical.  To make it rugged
you make it decievable.  Form an EE\'s point of view the BB\'s would likely be
no more difficult to fake up that the squak box on a plane...except it would
be posible to include quiery and verification code databases that were
nearly fool proof so that you could turn off the black box or have two or
more black boxes but could not forge one.  The method would be very similar
to the recongition codes used for nuclear missle launch today.  A signal
would be sent and a responce given but the list of posible signals and
respones could be mega bytes long and protected by that tamper circuit to
prevent duplication.  This would duplicate the effect of a \'switchable\'
black box like it appeared in the adventures and explain all that I have
read about the BB.  The signals and responces could be generated \'on the
fly\' by a \'simi-sentent\' chip with the exact same effect and be done without
AI technology being IN the chip.  Very similar to todays expert systems.

Understood. The first time I saw one was on the boob tube but it was
in a movie in which the so-called inventor went West trying to sell
it. Almost every time he went to shake hands, his derringer would pop
out. And, of course, the first time he really needed it, it stuck in
his sleeve.

Yep. I couldn\'t believe they were training 7 year olds with this thing.
Even assuming a child has the arm muscles for this thing, what kind of
force is necessary to flip a mass of metal/plastic the weight of an
average small 9mm from the forearm, through a cloth sleeve, and into
a hand as fast a an eyeblink? Now imagine a hand taking that kind of
mass with that force behind it.

I chose to use the \'external cradle\' rule instead; they\'re a bit less efficient

True drop tanks don\'t work quite this way -- they don\'t really add to the
volume of the ship.  This is one of the objections to them.  In any case, just
design them as a vehicle of whatever tonnage, and typically no components other
than fuel tankage.

Right you are.  That\'s what we teach as well.  Specifically, you feed
them your *off* arm, while going for a weapon with your other arm.

This can produce a moment of confusion for people like me.  I\'m
ambidextrous with left tendencies.  I\'m right-eye dominant and shoot
right-handed, but I fence, bat, and knife-fight left-handed.  So, if
I\'m attacked by a dog, the arm I feed it depends on how far away it
is when I initially become aware of it, and how fast it\'s closing on
me.  If I have sufficient distance, it gets my left arm while I draw
my Glock with my right hand.  Otheriwse, it gets my *right* arm while
I draw my SpyderCo folder with my left hand.

Decisions, decisions. :^/

BTW, one philosophy we teach that a lot of our students have a hard
time internalizing is the concept of tiered sacrifice: "Give up the
hand to save the arm; give up the arm to save the body.  But above
all, NEVER STOP FIGHTING."

This is making the assumption that the interstellar government _cares_ about
whether you bring weapons onto the world, which it probably doesn\'t -- after
all, the port generally doesn\'t have a very high law level.

Incidentally, customs inspections should always be run by the local authorities
(they might _also_ be performed by the imperials, but for different things). 
Customs is always performed by the government of the area you are _entering_,
because they\'re usually the ones who know exactly what they\'re looking for.

Hm...maybe.  If PCs looking for weapons aren\'t capable of being discreet about
it they probably deserve to get mugged.  In a high law level area people who
sell guns aren\'t likely to tell very many people who they are selling to. 
Also, being in the market for weapons doesn\'t mean your either rich or unarmed
- -- it means that (a) you have enough money for a gun, and (b) you want more
guns than you currently have.

The wishlist seems a little expansive to me.  I really wish they could get
the Major Alien races into 1 volume.  Perhaps I\'m too much a fan of
the Alien Encyclopedia.  But I think in 20 pages/race you could give enough
detail for players and referees, instead of totally postponing non-humaniti
chargen to upcoming supplements (which don\'t even have contracts done).

Guess I\'ll use some of the pre-G:T Traveller-Gurps conversion stuff on
the web.

     I seem to recall from my visit to the SJG site last night, that the
Behind the Claw was at the publishers now for release in November.  They
also had a notice for December release Aliens Vol. 1 with the Aslan,
Vargar, and some new alien race.  This seems to me, that if they even come
close to their schedules release, to indicate that SJG will be providing
the information you want, just not as fast as you want and for much more
money than you want to pay.  Hey at least they are going to produce the
information you want.

willing to train their own pilots for them and everything.
The current arrangement between the air force and army on aircraft is that the
army can have unarmed fixed-wing aircraft and armed helicopters, and the air
force has armed fixed-wing aircraft and unarmed helicopters.  The marines have
both armed fixed-wing and helicopters, but not many of either.  The navy has
armed fixed-wing aircraft, but I don\'t think they have armed helicopters aside

    'body' => 'I\'m going toss a couple of things into the mix that I consider important.

1)  The Deyo circuit has to be removable.  There are cases, especially
during overhaul periods, where ship\'s power will be shut down (no power, no
computer/commo suite).  It may not be particularly convenient, but it is
necessary.  Because these boxes are installed on merchant ships, the work
will be done in civilian shipyards, which means that the process has to be
commercially viable.

A aux. power connector is possible, but there is still the problem of the
box \'communicating\' with an outside source, which would also require an aux.
data port.  The combination of an aux power/data connection would allow the
box to remain active while the rest of the ship is dormant.  It would also,
however, would permit \'spoofing\' of the box by technicians \'in the know\'.

And there will be technicians \'in the know\'.  There are thousands of Class A
and B starports (starports capable of new construction and performing annual
overhauls).  Also, the starports along the Imperial border will need to have
a ready supply of the boxes on hand to install on foriegn flag vessels
entering the Imperium.  (I would point out, that this means that the boxes
have to be able to interface securely into the communications suites of
vessels built outside of Imperial standards, but I assume this has already
been covered in depth.)  Even if you limit the number of technicians who can
supply auxilliary power/data to the Deyo box to a few per port, that still
leave a huge number of people with the technical capability to access the
transponder.

I will leave the efforts of the governments surrounding the Imperium to
acquire the Deyo technology for another discussion...

2)  Transponders must have a \'silent\' mode.  Otherwise they are a hazard to
the ship they are installed on.  Consider the implications...

Assumption - each Deyo box has a unique identification number that is
assigned to a specific ship.  The database of ID numbers probably is not
confidential - it is one way to verify the identity of a ship you are
hailing.

a.  Instead of putting all this terribly expensive Fire Control equipment on
ships, just install a transponder \'pinger\' in the warheads of missiles.
Fire and forget - the missile will start pinging the transponder, the box
will respond and the missile gets a new fix on the target.  (For more fun
and kicks, install another Deyo box in the missile and let the two talk it
up...)

b.  ArchDuke Norris is on a goodwill tour of the Domain of Deneb in his
private yacht (surrounded by a portion of the Sector Navy).  A Ine Givar
ship fires a spread of missiles, each tuned to \'listen\' for his yacht\'s
transponder ID.

IMTU, transponders have 2 modes.

Command mode - When a ID request (AKA \'ping\') is recieved, an alert is put
on the commo workstation.  The commo officer must authorize a return signal
before it is actually broadcast.  There are specific cases where this is not
the case.  When a unit of the Imperial Navy \'pings\' a ship while operating
in this mode, the reply is automatic, and when a Signal GK is sent, it
triggers a response from any recieving ship.  This is the normal operating
mode of ships in Imperial Space.

Silent mode - When this mode is triggered, it automatically writes an entry
into the ship\'s log.  This suppresses all transponder transmissions.

I just read my copy and you don\'t need any books besides the core rules.
Compendium I would be handy if you are creating alien races, but theres
nothing in it that is REQUIRED to  play G:T.  The same for the Ultra-tech
books (Including Biotech, my favorite).  They\'re just equipment lists.  If
you want to use your old equipment lists, they\'ll work.  I think the
equipment list in G:T has just about every item my players have wanted to
buy in the the last twenty or so years, though.  It starts off with rules
to convert Ultra-tech equipment, but it does give GURPS stats for most of
the common stuff thats going to be used.

G:Space is a nice reference book, but the majority of it is set up for
designing your own universe.  Its really incredible in the way it lays out
all of the major decisions you need in order to make a good sci-fi
universe, but I bought G:T for the Traveller Universe.  By copy of G:Space
is just going to keep gathering dust.

Gurps Vehicles is nice.  That\'s one the gearheads on the list are going to
want to consider picking up - its the Gurps equivelent of FF&S.  But,
theres going to be a lot of stuff in there that doesn\'t apply tothe
Traveller Universe (the same is true for the Ultra-tech books).  The
modular starship design is a simplified version of the Vehicle rules
designed around the Traveller universe.  But I played Traveller for years
(from the origenal release to the release of Megatraveller) with just the
vehicles from the basic set and hand-waving, and I don\'t think I\'ll change
that (I\'m not a Gearhead - head hung in shame).  The one section of
Vehicles that does tend to get a lot of work is the weapon creation rules.
Those are so fun.  But, I\'ve got a good weapon list already, in G:T.

G:Martial Arts are the rules for Cinematic Martial Arts, really.  You can
play a martial artist with the basic gurps rules and skills (ie Judo and
Karate) and some imagination.  Of course, if you do want rules for all
those martial arts manuvers, you will need to go with a rules supplenment.
As a reconmendation though, the MA manuvers rules are in Compendium I, and
you can design your own styles.

So basically what I am saying is that I think that G:T is playable with
just the Gurps Basic rules and nothing else.

Gurps Lite is available on the web for free at:
	http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/lite/
I haven\'t checked it out in relation to G:T yet, but I imagine that it
will be enough to play, but some of the skills are not going to be listed.
(There is a complete Gurps skill list available though, check the
resources at <http://www.sjgames.com/gurps> - I can\'t remember the URL for
the skills list.

If I recall correctly from the playtest time, Gurps Lite was taken out so
that they could get another 32 pages of Traveller related material in.  I
think (though this is really hazy) that it was the Starship stuff that
replaced it.

I do believe tath the reprint is going to be out soon on the compendia,
but you don\'t need anything more thean the basic rules (or lite) to play
G:T - my reasoning is on a seperate post.

The USMC MAGTF (Marine Air-Ground Task Force) commander owns the air 
power in his force.  This is how they ensure that they have the close 
air support...  One of the Norwegian commanders was complaining about 
how he had spent the entire exercise demanding air and never getting it,

responsibility...  That was when he learned that all those attack 
aircraft had been painted with the USMC in 2 foot letters...

Yes, but..

I\'ve collect GURPS books for years, so I already have all the books
mentioned, along with a few (dozen) others.  Traveller/Illuminati anyone?

For someone who has just spent close to $50 on the GURPS rule book and
GURPS Traveller to be told that he really needs to spend another $80 on

The Virus didn\'t need the transponders to take over a computer; they could
use other communication devices or even just close proximity(I\'ve always
assumed that some of their powers were psionic in nature). The transponders
were supposedly the reason why the Virus spread so fast as it did. Low-tech
computers got infected too, but they were too small to allow the Virus to go
active.

The other way around, actually.

Well, if I thought I had worked out a simple way to quantify the economic
realities of the Real World, I would be writing on a doctoral thesis. As it
is, I\'m just proposing a simplified system that will work for a role playing
game (indeed, for most RPGs). This is just a basic rule.

I\'m not so sure that you\'re right about that, but I\'m not qualified to say
for sure. However, I\'m pretty sure that in a simplified RPG environment
they could be.

Again, I\'m using a simplified model for a RPG. The unit I use as a referee is
the credit that I described. When I work out a detailed decription of a world
I usually just make one Gablotnik (or whatever the local currency is called)
worth one credit; that way I can just use the standard price lists (Sad to
confess, my players and I often just use the unit \'one money\'. Its not as
evocative as using "real" currencies, but its a lot faster and easier). But
sometimes I make it worth 2 credits and halve all the prices. Also, I assume
a work year of 3000 standard hours. If the society have radically different
work customs, it is a simple matter to adjust the currency to match them.

If that was true he would starve to death very quickly.

How much does a worker with dependents get for the same work?

It usually takes me about 5 seconds to get the census figure for a world that
I\'m planning an adventure on.

I have yet to meet a player interested in running a fiscal planning campaign.

And the last time we discussed it, we arrived at a figure of 2-3$ to the
CrImp. That\'s fits quite prettily.

I disagree. It may not be true enough to be of any practical use in the real
world, but for purposes of running a RPG campaign it is close enough. It is
based on the assumption that in most societies an unskilled manual laborer
will earn just enough to keep alive with very little left over. That fits
all the societies I\'ve checked so far (admittedly not many: Modern Denmark,
modern America, Ancient Rome, Classic Traveller and T4 (but _not_ MT and I
forget how TNE turned out).

As for GPP, I use a definition similar to the one in Pocket Empires (I think
that the influence of TL on productivity is more than linear, so I use
TL^2/10 instead of TL in the formula, but that\'s immaterial; the system
works just as well with the official formula).

Think of the transponder signal as the equivalent of a licence plate. If you
don\'t have one, the authorities are very likely to become curious. If you use
one that dosen\'t exist, the authorities are very likely to become curious.
If you use one that dosen\'t belong to a ship of your type, the authorities

that is supposed to be somewhere else, the authorities are very likely to
become curious. And if you use one that belongs to a stolen ship, the

Most passenger liners don\'t go to pirate infested systems or unexplored space.

The ability of naval ships to turn off their transponders is canon (so is the
ability of civilian ships to do the same, come to that).

OK. We\'ll assume that you can\'t use a transponder chip to breed new chips.
It would be a sensible precaution to make the end product incapable of
breeding and have special breeders only at a few locations. Let\'s distinguish
between them by calling them \'breeders\' and \'blanks\'. In how many places
would there be breeders? This is undefined and the possibilities range from
one in each place where you can register a ship to a single central place.

Now, regardless of how many places you keep breeders, the system requires
that the officials at each starport where you can build new ships be able
to issue a new transponder. If each Class A starport has a breeder of its
own, then the number of spare blanks will be very small, but the number of
people able to create new blanks are high. If there is only a single place
that breeds new chips, the number of spare blanks floating around will be
tremendous. Pick any assumption between these two extremes and you still get
a lot of people in a position to mess with the system.

The system also requires that each place where ship sales can be registered
has a means of programming a transponder. That\'s all Class A and B starports
at a minimum (I myself think that Class C and possibly D starports would also
have them).

That\'s news to me. I\'m quite sure it\'s the civilian ships that only have mute
buttons and that military ships have special variable transponders.

Not really. Even if they made perfect internal sense they would still be in

I can\'t off-hand recall any DGP mention of programmable transponders. The
references I was talking about are CT.

>Anyone care to paraphrase/summarize how this \'programming" worked?

_The Traveller Adventure_ p. 112:

"Transponders are an essential piece of equipment on interstellar vessels.
Sealed, tamperproof devices, they send out an identification of the ship -
its name, registry, and important statistics - when a signal is sent to the
ship from an outside source. This provides a permanent and theoretically
unbeatable way of registering starships.
    Actually, of course, transponders are neither tamper-proof nor
unbeatable. But it takes excellent resources or very good connections to
alter a transponder. The Oberlindes device is even better - at the touch of
a button, the transponder can be set to any one of three different ID codes."

and

"Any particular setting of the transponder can be reprogrammed to a new
identification by any person or persons with skills of electronics-2 and
computer-2."

I would interpret this to mean that changing a standard transponder would be
far more difficult than changing the special three-setting one, but possible
with somewhat higher electronics and computer skills.

I could give you an argument about that. Trade is a two-way street. Take a
look at some of the recent instances of artificial trade barriers imposed by
a country here in our Real World. I would expect the Solomani (and the other
major interstellar empires) to retaliate by forbidding any ship _carrying_ a
Deyo transponder from trading in the Confederation/Consulate/etc. The
resulting screams of pain from Imperial megacorporations would sweep that
requirement away pdq. But I suppose one could come up with some story that
accounted for the Solomani/Zhodani/etc. swallowing it. It\'s the bit about the
Solomani/Zhodani/etc. installing them in their own ships that I can\'t accept.

>As for using them on their native systems, maybe their high-ups learned
>precisely how they operate...

In that case they should be able to forge them. Unless you mean that they
don\'t know precisely how they operate, but merely know how the Imperium
_claims_ that they operate. Besides, in order for the Solomani to use
them for their own ships, they must have a plentiful supply of blanks
_and_ have the ability to program them. 

>...and that they were full proof against conventional methods of forgery.

If you were the Solomani, would you trust the Imperium to tell the truth
about the capabilities of these black boxes? I wouldn\'t.

>One can buy whole transponder black boxes, but not Deyo chips or their

Yes they have. Every official capable of issuing a legitimate transponder
must have a way to get his hands on blank chips and of programming them.
They may be sealed into transponders already, but they will still be blanks.

I wasn\'t thinking of the high nobles at all. I was thinking of all the super-
visors in all the starship registration offices in the Imperium. And whatever
technical personnel each of them have to perform the actual programming and
installing of transponders. Alell has a Class B starport and that has a
starship registration office; Arden has a Class C starport and that has one
too. Alltogether I would estimate at least 5000 such offices in the Imperium.

>How many high nobles are there? ; )

If you use a top-down analysis you get:

1 emperor                         =          1
1 archduke per domain             =          6
1 duke per subsector              =        310+
3-4 counts per subsector          =      1,100+
1 marquis per major world         =      5,000+
3-4 barons per major world        =     17,500+
some more barons for minor worlds =      2,500?

A total of between 20 and 30,000. Add an unspecified number of court and
achievement nobles and you may double or perhaps triple that number. A
lot depends on your assumptions.

If you make a bottom-up analysis based on the character creation rules you
find something around 4-5% of the population are high nobles. That would
come to 600-750 billion high nobles. So I usually don\'t... (OK, its \'only\'
4-5% of that part of the population that enters the standard Traveller
occupations, so the figure would propably be a couple of orders of magnitude
lower ;-)

>Besides... A few thousand people out of a population of trillions.  And I\'m
>sure of those trillions a few thousand can also be provided to make sure an

All you\'d accomplish by that particular bright scheme is to double the
number of people who know the secret. And who watches the watchmen?

>...(even assuming these people don\'t have the highest Imperial security

You think that a high security clearance is absolute assurance against
corruption?

And, chances are, that you can drive around with one that you made 
in your garage and no one will ever care. The authorities don\'t
become curious about things they don\'t notice.

If you have a transponder that comes from a stolen ship on the 
other end of the Imperium that matches your type of ship, you\'ll
probably get away with it for quite a while.

What kind of courier network are you assuming here? A random one designed by
rolling dice or one designed by rational beings to get information through
in a timely manner? If you assume something rational, you can get information
from a subsector capital to a subsector capital three subsectors away in 8-9
jump-6 jumps or slightly over two months. Disseminating it to the rest of the
subsector will take some weeks more, of course. In that time a Far Trader
whose jumps just happened to always take it in the same direction could get
about 10 parsecs (70 days with one jump-2 per forthnight = 5 jumps).

No. The port would have the notice of the capture of the _CF_ that went out
three months ago. It may not have the notice of the sale yet. So the
authorities will single it out for special attention and check its log and
your ownership papers thoroughly.

But your papers have always been your primary proof. The transponder just
determines whether the port authorities gives them a perfunctory or a
thorough examination.

Very good comparison, with the following caveats:

Most police officers won\'t take much notice of a license plate unless
your vehicle breaks a traffic law, annoys them, or otherwise gets their 
attention - say by being the same color and make as a vehicle they\'ve
been told to look out for. Police officers may have some license
plate types they\'ll notice - don\'t put a trailer plate on your bright red
sports car, for example - but don\'t record every license plate they see
just in case, nor does every police officer have on their person a list
of all license plates ever issued.

Starship transponders, in this sense, would be very like license plates.
authorities can regulate your ship, see if you\'re behaving and identify
a ship they see (given enough time).

However:
The license number of a stolen car can be broadcast nationwide
in a matter of minutes, the reports travelling far faster than the
stolen car can hope to. Sightings of the vehicle can also be updated
in the same fashion. Further, lists of all license plates can be accessed
from a distance with some speed - often while a suspected vehicle
is being first looked at.

With the canonical communications lags, transponders can\'t be like
license plates - they can\'t provide local authorities with an easily
checked method of tracking vehicles, any more than a wanted poster
in 18th century London could help catch a smuggler in India.

Unless, of course, YTU penalizes people for travelling faster than
the Imperial mail, and makes them stick to flight plans and scheduled
stops. Be kind of like the role-playing opportunities of a passenger
jet crew, wouldn\'t it?  :)

My papers are the primary proof? I was thinking that ship\'s papers

unforgeable transponders was the crucial point of the system.

Let me explain. I\'m resistant to the idea of a perfect transponder
working as a magic bullet for control of ships in the Empire.

If we could determine a criteria for gaining the attention of the authorities,

I don\'t even know how to make one (nobody does) so being able

the fact that they are a mass production item under the

(including controlling all input into it) says to me that

Let me count the ways...

1) Ridiculously massive computational horsepower. (If it takes twice the
estimated lifetime of the universe today, Moore\'s Law (well, guideline,
anyway) suggests that it\'ll take *1* lifetime in 18 months. Give the
computer industry a few million years of development and my analogy will
have broken down completely. ;-)
2) Find and exploit a flaw in the algorithm. (E.g., figure out a cheap way
of factoring numbers. (IIRC there\'s no proof that factoring *must* be
difficult. It\'s just that everyone agrees that it is so now, and will likely
remain so for quite some time.))
3) Build a back door into the encryption software.
4) Bug the *terminal*, not the transmission.
5) Talk someone who has the key into giving it to you. (Social engineering.)
6) Hold a gun to the head of someone who knows the key. (Anti-social
engineering. ;-)
7) If key recovery is used, bribe someone with access to the \'skeleton key\'.
8) Find and exploit a bug in the implementation. (PGP has had a few.)
9) Find and exploit a bug in the *OS* used to run the encryption software.
10) Outlaw encryption, that way it won\'t be used by bad guys. Right? ;-)

The above is not to say that I find PGP useless and encryption pointless.
Quite the opposite.

Actually these schemes where they melt down can backfire.
If they melt down when communications are lost, they will
melt down if there is just a communications malfunction.
That means that any ship with melted chips can just blame
them on a malfunction.

Pardon?  I thought that was the point of this discussion.  That if you turn
off the transponder it self distructs.  That was half of my gripe about it
being very unrealistic.  If the transponders send ability can be muted I
have few problem with the any of the discribed systems except those that log
all other transponders they meet.  That log would create a security
nightmare for the Empire in that a harbor master or a ship owner could
quickly build an accurate map of almost all trafic within a subsector.  The
value of such information to a sipping company or an enemy power is
staggering.  Remember the WW2 line, \'Loose lips sink ships!"?  All to true
them and even more true when a near perfect log of nearly all traffic
exists.  Big brother works BOTH ways.

They can communicate w/ Virus, but most were unaware just what was inside the
black box.  The transponders were inhabited by lobotomized chips (a TL15
program).  Virus was a project designed to disable (it actually "overwrote"
the chip in the method of the Cymbeline predator) and was a TL16-17 program.
Assuming a psi does contact a non-Virus transponder chip, he can probably
fiddle w/ it, but any altering of the program is likely to be noticed in
comparison against another transponder\'s control chip (and thus return a
"False" squawk).

You tell me.  I\'m not an EE.  What will EEs of the 57th century be able to do?
A "simple" TL-15 feedback doowackey signal?  :::handwave handwave:::
Connection lost.  Survival Margin just says [after military ships are said to
have a "mute" button]: "Any attempt to open the box cause the tamper circuit
to destroy the contents, but simple disconnection from other systems caused
the same effect.  In order to prevent the use of transponders removed from
destroyed vessels, disconnection from the main computer or the comunications
circuits cause the tamper circuit to fire as well."-pg 77.  

Is not possible for even today to have something like that?  Yes, there would
be counters, but that\'s another issue.  I see nothing bout turning comm off,
just "disconecting."  Making it a closed circuit or something to that effect
once its installed. 

The writers weren\'t 57th c EEs, and i\'m not either. I don\'t even play one on

I don\'t believe in ESP. ; )  If not correctly installed, i\'d say it wouldn\'t
work (if indeed the black box isn\'t instructed on how a proper connection
"feels.")  HOW?  Each chip learned and was taught by "educated" chips.   How
does this happen?  How do we do it?  The Deyo chips are more analgous to
evolved beings than to computer microchips as we know them today.

I accept that it may not be transmitting (i accept a "mute" button. it was
stated to be only for military, but i\'m convinced its good for civvies too).
If it\'s not attached to a real comm, it won\'t transmit.  If it\'s not attached
to a receiver it won\'t read.  If it\'s not attached to a real computer, it
won\'t have no databanks, main comp to play around in, thus installation won\'t
be complete and it won\'t work (it won\'t be able to chatter w/ other
transponders).  You have a transponder that isn\'t sending when that IN warship
comes around, you better be prepared to suck vaccuum (or go to a Prison
Planet<g>).

How it verified information is detailed.  In each transponder there were two
SDG-313F chips.  One was the IFF that did the talking and squawking and
chattering.  The other was a control chip.  Both of these were attached to a
larger memory chip.  Connection w/ the main computer gave access to the ships
main comp and databanks.  These chips all had a reliable and slow mutation.
Any alteration would mean a chip could tell another one didn\'t mutate at the
same slow and reliable rate.  They were "trained" by "educated" chips right
out of the lab, where they would be tested for functionality, veracity, etc
etc.  When talking w/ another chip, it would judge if the other chip was
authentic or not based on the conversation and comparison w/ its own control
chip.  When installed, it was told it\'s registry, id #, ship name, captain,
blah blah.  Whenever there was a change this was told to it as well.  The old
information was never overwritten or delted, just added to.  They kept a
complete running history and the ships resources to do it.

Every transponder had both a Deyo chip and a control chip (& a larger memory
chip both of these were attached to).  The transponders control chip was
compared to the information just received.  If someone does finally get in a
noodle w/ the programming what are the odds that the control chip can\'t tell
the difference?  Remember, the chips were supposed to have a reliable
mutation.  Say a psi w/ computer empathy does successfully fiddle w/ a Deyo
transponders info.  Any other tranponder will be able to tell that this one
has not \'reliably\' mutated as it should have.  This returns the "False" ping
when squawked.  

Note that Survival Margin does discuss the possiblity of malfunctions and such
on pg70 (to answer your other post about surges, damage, etc).  A "False"
squawk (or no transponder chatter at all) just means there must be further
investigation.  In wartime, in a warzone, expect to be destroyed.  In
peacetime, you should be luckier (assuming teh Emperor\'s Cruiser isn\'t coming
by).  An authenticated squawk could well be an enemy, but the crew does know
that the transponders cannot be deceived.

> Or can they rattle off every ship they\'ve ever squawked, how long
> they were in normal space in which system, etc?

Actually they rattle off indefinetly (except i\'ll grant and accept the mute).
The squawk is only for the benefit of the ships crew (and gives the registry
info off the BBs memory chip).  It\'s during the "conversation" that a
transponder learns whether it\'s chatting w/ an authentic transponder.

Low tech comps could only have an "egg" planted in them and couldn\'t host an
electronic meta-identity (Virus).  They were dumb and behaved like todays
computer viruses (though more advanced, naturally).

I just wanted to ask... "Why would anybody WANT sentient or semi-sentient ship?"

Sure, transponders are needed and presumably you can make a transponder that is not
a Deyo chip (especially since we have them now).  But who wants a ship that gives
you lip when you give it an order? Didn\'t anybody learn anything from HAL going
bonkers? Dave?

Simple: PGP is anscheme that requires a key to decrypt, and the key size is
limited. Simply put a copy of the document (still encrypted) onto a
read-only segment, and run the document through each possible key until you
get a readable result. For automating, until you get hits on a dictionary
grep compare.then sort though the decryted ones with hits til you get an
intelligible message. the NSA already does it, according to an interview
shown on Discovery channel last weekend. THey have a decryptor dedicated to
doing just that, and it takes a few hours for shorter keys, through a few
days for 128 bit RSA.

at present, the thing about encrytion is the combination of caputring and
recognizing encryted messages, since most really important events are
double or tripple encrypted... so you need to know what constitutes
"Intelligible" at each stage.

ForEx: One use code pad, combined with numerical code-book, combined with
128bit    Electronic encrytion. You have to know the type of output to
expect from the combined codebook and one-use pad to blind decrypt the
128-bit ee. If you\'ve caputured the code book, but not the one use pad, you
might not be able to decrypt. But, it is possible, at east in theory, to
decrypt if you have both time, and enough different messages. One-use pads
are the current "High Tech" in encryption... any stable key system is
crackable, assuming you can FIND the message amidst "the noise and Haste",
and know the type of algorhythms available to the encryptor.

And, despite the calims that Publick and Private keys cannot be cross
hacked, it is and can be done, given enough samples, as they DO use stable
algorhythms. You just need to know how it is changed. This can be done by
intercepting and brute decrypting several messages going each away, to
espablish the two keys.

The current problem is that many decryption methods require multiple
messages be decrypted to be assured you have a valid message decoding
scheme, by proving that it is THIS "probable decrypt " or the other, as the
same key was used on a, b, c, and d messages with success.

If you adventure within the mail routes then you have to play by their rules.  If
you adventure outside the mail routes then they aren\'t there to stop you (they
aren\'t there to help you either).  Its also a bit like international shipping.
Your papers need to be in order before you leave and when you arrive.  If they
aren\'t then you\'re stuck in port until they can be cleared up.  However, when
you\'re out at sea, nobody checks your paper.  So, if you drop out of the xboat
route, you should expect to have a wait until your paperwork comes through once
you get back.  Could be a long time if you have to send a request upstream to
get  it.

Reminds me of the war story one of my sergeants told me about Grenada
(before I became a sergant and started collecting war stories in Panama
and the Gulf):

He was out and about during the early days of Urgent Fury, when a sniper
started shooting in his area.  He used the most powerful manpackable
weapon to take out the sniper:  an AN/PRC-77, with a CEOI listing
someone sho could talk to the zoomies.  In other words, he called in an
air strike on the sorry SOB.  C\'est la guerre....

The authorities round here are actually pretty much certain to notice (at
least round here) sooner or later. A few months back a friend of a friend
got caught driving without a licence because a cop ran his plates and found
that the car was owned by someone who was currently disqualified and pulled
him over. At the time he was driving under the speed limit in a properly
licenced and warranted car, doing nothing out of the ordinary.

It always bothered me about the Virus.  If the chip, with the coding was
the lifeform, then the silicon could be considered the "body"  If that body
is kept within the transponder, the data pathways would still be nothing
more than an avenue of communication, not travel as the chip would still
need to electronicly breed with other chips to spread the virus.

Basicly, you would have a lot of paranoid transponders that could see and
talk to the outside world, but not influence it in any way.

Unless the virus is an electronic lifeform that has no material form.  This
would then imply that it may have the ability to infect a living host...

I just having touble justifying its existance or for that matter, based on
what I\'ve read, its believability.

Just my $.02

don\'t know it they are still in service, but the US Navy has had armed
rotary wing aircraft: the SeaCobra attack helo. AFAIK, they are no longer
in navy hands. The navalized blackhawk also has air-to-air and
air-to-ground capability.

Ob trav: How much space to surface capability does an ImpNavy fighter
squadron have?

also: do you use the rampart as a high speed space capable air-raft or a
true space fighter (both designs have been seen in cannon in different
editions, IIRC).

It\'s been out for quite some time... I\'ve had mine since before summer...

Those rules from space most needed for GT just happen to be in C II, except
world generation. Such as: 0-G rules, society culturale ratings
explanations, SOCS. Plus the mass ground combat rules.


IMHO, To run GT, what you MUST HAVE to run effectively:
	GT
	Basic Set
Highly Useful for the GM:
	Vehicles 2nd
	Compendia I & II
Useful, for players who won\'t GM:
	Basic, C I, and GT
Useful for the group to have available:
	Ultratech
	High Tech (if planning on lower-tech adventures)
	Space
May be nice to hae available to the group, but really out there:
	Biotech
	Cyberpunk (for the hacking rules)
	Psionics (if you\'re gonign  to run extensively in Zho Space)

I have a few complaints about GT:
	1: the attribute conversion fomula(e) is(are) missing.
	2: JOT is not in the skill conversion list, even though it is in
		a sidebar at the start of said list.
	3: The "Ship Patron" fomula doesn\'t seem to match my workups from
		the fomula, and not all the ships shown have listed costs.
	4: The Ship Patron formula doesn\'t allow for non-starships.
	5: There is no discussion of JIS rank insignia (minor peeve).
	6: Modular Ship Design doesn\'t include (Gurps) TL 11 ships, nor
		TL 9 or TL 13, tho those two are less important.
	7: TL conversion  and the layout of the UPP are not in the
		section on UPP\'s.
	8: TL\'s shown on Library Data entries are in Traveller TL\'s, altho
		never specified as to which is in use. One is missing
		a TL entry at all.

Overall, tho, I\'d reccomend it.

Unfortunately, haven\'t seen GTrav yet ... its supposed to be arriving in Sydney
this week, and I hope to pick it up on my weekly trek to Napoleon\'s (my FLG+MBS)
this afternoon, so I\'ll take your word for it.

However, all I was trying to say is ... if all that GURPSTrav is going to
publish is for this "alternate" timeline, and if all the other stuff is out of
print, it hardly makes any difference whether its an "alternate" or not. All the
*new* gamers (and lets hope there are hundreds, nay, *thousands* of them) new to
Traveller won\'t *care* about what the "original" might once have been. Ergo, by
stealth, effectively the alternate will displace and replace the original.

Of course, if Mark brings out T5 *and* it is set in Rebellion/Virus era (and,
lets face it, it was fairly obvious that T4 as published by IG was almost
certainly never going to revisit Virus or Rebellion), then and only then will I
be wrong.

This has nothing to do with what you or I (or anyone on the list) think of
Rebellion (which I liked a lot) or Virus (which I loathed), it has nothing to do
with whether you consider them "canon" (or merely "canon fodder") or not, it has
to do with the practicalities of the situation.

The smallest Roman measurement, like the smallest Greek, was a
finger\'s-breadth (digitus). As in Greece and elsewhere, 4 of these formed
a palm, and 4 palms made a foot, so that there were 16 digiti to a foot.
The foot itself (pes) was normally of 29.57 cm, though in the provinces we
also find the pes Drusianus, named after Nero Claudis Drusus (38-9 BC),
stepson of Augustus, which had a length of 33.3 or 33.5 cm; it was really
of far greater antiquity than Drusus. From teh third century AD there was
also a short foot of 29.42 cm. If one was dealing purely in linear
measurement, then 5 pedes made a passus; 1000 passus made a mile (1.4785
km). ["Reading the Past", O.A.W. Dilke]

So, a fair difference (1.48 vs. 1.6).

I\'d like to see a reference to this. (Not implying that you made it up,
but not necessarily trusting your source.) I know of a few different
gauges for railways, so I\'m not convinced that wagons were that
standardized.

In the same way that the Americans have stayed with the Imperial gallon?

Seriously, units stay when a society is stable. Political change can often
change units. One reason the French created the metric system was because
different parts of France had different standards for measures. The same
applied to England as well (persistance of local units).

Bingo...reread the relevant section of the TNE manual...they describe
Virus as \'a life form that inhabits electronic systems like a fish
inhabits water\' They cannot exist outside of a electronic circuit, but
given a physical connection they can move from one system to another.
The Virus was derived from a strain of Cymbeline chip that had evolved
to impress it\'s circuitry on others from a distance, using
electromagnetic signals. It used the transponders as a way to get into
the ships system, as the transponders were a highly sophisticated, yet
\'unknown\' computer system on board most starships. 

Sadly, the critical sources for the description and evolution of the
Cymbeline chips and Virus are all out of print: TNE, Survival Margin,
and Adventure 13:Signal GK. The latter has the most complete description
of the \'biology\' of the chip lifeform, and as the root of the whole
idea, makes the rest of it make more sense.

This is another one of those forbidden near-c pirate subjects on the
list. People tend to either accept the concept enthusiastically or
reject it violently.

In retrospect, calling it Virus is what lead to the problem. 90% of the
people saw that term and leapt to the wrong conclusion: that it was some
form of computer virus, a really sophisticated program. It isn\'t. Think
of it in biological terms: Virus = Ebola.

Worse...Virus = Flu. We know a hell of a lot about the influenza virus,
but we still have no way of preventing a new mutant strain coming out
just about every year. Or tell how bad it\'ll be or what it\'ll look like.

The scientists at Research Station Omega were playing with the
equivalent of a hardy, aerosol dispersed Ebola strain, with the skills
and knowledge base of a pre-Pasteur or better a pre-Jenner biologist.

They were having the same problem getting their heads wrapped around
something that lived _in_ a circuit but _wasn\'t_ the circuit that lots
of people are having on the list.

Yup.

I\'ve got GURPS Basic Set (3rd edition) and GURPS Space, as well as GURPS
Uplift (I purchased the others to use Uplift). I was pretty cheesed to
discover that (a) I\'d have to lay out for a couple more books to really
get everything I needed, and (b) for some reason the \'flavour\' of the
system was very bland. (Mind you, some of the later could be my having to
stop and translate most of the numbers before I could feel them. I can\'t
really enjoy a French novel, either, even if I can follow the action.)

Wish I\'d seen that show.  Thing is, though, current PGP keys have 1024 or 2048 
bit keys.  Each bit *doubles* the keyspace the computer has to search through, 
so a 1024 bit key ought to keep the NSA busy for a month or so.

That\'s the thing.  Is the NSA gonna wanna spend a month or two to decrypt

Well the module table lists a crew rating of 1-5 for the Basic Bridge and a
crew rating of 1-10 for the Command Bridge so I assume they are talking
about MANNED work stations.

I must admit to an error however in my earlier post (and I attribute it to
lack of sleep or Very poor eyesight!) Looking at the table again today I
realized I\'d used the 1 space for the Basic Bridge which is  the listing for
a cockpit (much more reasonable). The TL10 and TL 12 Basic bridge is listed
as having 2.5 spaces or 10  yards so I can buy that for a crew of 5. However
the TL10 Command  Bridge IS 2 spaces or 8 yards while the TL12 Command
Bridge is 5 spaces or 20 yards (a much more reasonable size in my mind). My
fix is to use 5 spaces for both TL 10 AND TL 12 Command Bridgesand assume
the 2 was a misprint.

When I got home from work and started re-checking my work sheet against the
book I did one of those head smacking numbers. There\'s still an error (I\'m
pretty sure) since I can\'t see a TL 10 Command Bridge being SMALLER than a
TL 10 Basic Bridge, but it\'s a much smaller error than I origanally thought.

In those immortal words... " I\'m sorry... Never mind." as I drift back into
the primordial ooze from which I came.

A TL 15 Computers can probably notice every transponder squawk and spit out a
list of "curiosity arousing" ships in the vicinity faster than the IN patrol
ships\' gunners blink their eyes.  Why take chances w/ internal security?

Only as far out as you are from the news.  As Hans has pointed out, a rational
courier network (as opposed to a purely random one) makes it much more likely
any noteworthy information (such as a most wanted list and stolen multi-MCr
ship) can beat any civilian ship out there.  J-4 Xboat, J-6 military courier
vs J-2 far trader/scout.

They are "programmed" (actually taught) by "educated" chips at the lab where
they\'re bred (and also tested).  The only place anyone has access to the chips
w/o a black box around them is in this place (I hypothesize a very limited
#... indeed only one IMTU.  Robot construction and assembly.  There are people
who supervise the testing and making sure the robots are running right).
Needless to say there was very high security and intelligence here.

Installing a ship is where it\'s told what ship its being installed in, who the
captain is, etc etc.  This information is *never* forgotten or overwritten.
The black box is installed in the Ore Reaper, Captain Odren Tellbar, Vras
(0738/Nicosia/Old Expanses), #3.1416... ,...etc etc.  Good ol Odren decides to
skip payments or maybe falls victim to the dastardly Enor the Sunbeard.  There
is no way to ever make the Ore Reaper say it\'s the Googolorpian Dream or that
it\'s home port was originally Nemyer (1235/Sarid/Old Expanses).  Well it will,
the squawk will just register it as the Googolorpian Dream, formerly the Ore
Reaper.  Ditto for Captain, home port, etc etc.  Thus, they are unforgable.
Their histories and installation place, registry #, Captains are never
forgotten.  The Black Box keeps a running and complete history on its memory
chip (burned on it by the IFF chip in the same method of the Cymbeline
predators). All of the previous information will come up on an identity
squawk.

Noone can get in to get a chip out to breed for it, so the points moot.  Even
if an SDG-313F chip was acquired outside the black box, if it was further
bred, there\'s every likelyhood its slow and reliable mutation would be
different from the authentic chips (and thus stand out and result in a "false"
squawk from authentic chips).  

The transponders are in black boxes and delivered to starports in bulk.  When
installed in a ship, they\'re told what ship they\'re installed in,
identification/registry, etc etc.  This info is never forgotten nor
overwritten, but a complete running history is kept.   There is the
possibility of putting an ill-acquired black box in a ship and programming the
name, etc, but this never changes, either.  They can keep killing their
transponder and replacing it, but will get heavily investigated if found
running w/o a transponder or w/ an id of a stolen black box.  Every authentic
black box tells the truth.    Fakes are recognized as such by the authentics.

Well there you go.  You have no desire for them to be acceptable, thus you\'ll
convince yourself of reasons why they shouldn\'t be accepted.

They are self-consistent w/ their own descriptions.   I can\'t do anything but
admit they dont\' mesh w/ the Traveller Adventure transponders.  There isn\'t
much of a difference between pre-Collapse 1086 and 1105 to my campaign set in
post-Collapse, 1202.  It\'s all history man!  ; )

The 3I is larger and more prosperous than any of its neighbors.  The neighbors
(and it\'s mercantile interests) lose alot more than the 3I (and it\'s megacorps
and mercantile interests).   Remember the 3I is as much a trade alliance as it
is an interstellar polity.  It\'s internal trade is far more important than
external.

You acknowledge the possibility of them using it for purposes of trade in the
Imperium. For the sake of argument, say the transponders are infallable.  Why
should the foreign polities then use two seperate IFF systems (especially
since their own, lower tech, systems are quite fallable in the method of the
Traveller Adventures\' transponders)?  The transponders won\'t lie for the
Imperials, won\'t lie to them, won\'t lie for their other enemies, won\'t lie for
them.  Maybe they do indeed start breeding programs, only to learn the
Imperial transponders will be able to tell (they\'ll have a different mutation
rate and return false squawks).

No. Just making a point that a limited number of locations (much less one
location) can be made effectively invulnerable to espionage and corruption.
There would be a massive high security/ supervision / counter-intel /military
apparatus in place.

No, but the NSA wouldn\'t care about your love letters even if you sent
them in the clear, right? And if nobody cares enough about it to bother
trying to read it anyway, what\'s the point in encrypting it at all?

I know... just because you can.  ;)

I can give you perspective of someone who wrote a GURPS Traveller
article and then GMed it for some years....

All my players ever needed was Basic, and my article only had
a fraction of what GURPS Traveller has in it.

When I wrote the thing, aside from the Traveller books, 90%+
of what I used came from Basic and Space, and I could have
gotten by without space in a pinch.  Once I wrote it, for
GMing I used mostly just Basic.  I used Vehicles to make
up some space ships (which I could have done with the quick
ship design system in G Trav) and Space for some generic
SF roleplaying stuff (Star types, etc.).

One could easily run a game with just Basic.  If you were
determined, you could squeak by with downloading GURPS Lite.
Now that is not to say that other stuff wouldn\'t be useful,
but if you are a limited budget my advice would be to try
it for a while with Basic until you have a better idea of
what else (if anything) you want.  (If you are on an _unlimited_
budget, my advice is to buy everything with "GURPS" on it, you never
know when you won\'t want to illuminate your campaign with Elves,
intelligent bunnies, time travelle to ancient Egypt, etc. :-)

Out of curiosity, why _can\'t_ the chip lie?  After all, it is a life
form, albeit a manufactured one, so it could conceivably be taught to
lie.  (Admittedly, I don\'t know how one might motivate a Deyo chip to
lie; that\'s one reason why I\'m asking why one can\'t.)

Of course, one could just as easily assume that a Solomani (or Zhodani,
etc.) Deyo box would simply be read as having a foreign "accent."  It
would still be considered authentic, since a Solomani/Zhodani/etc.
cross-border trader would have a vested interest in letting the
Imperials know his/her/its transponder signature.

us Navy folks can launch our helo based torps at surface ships and can
strap a harpoon missle to a helo (but why) if we want to attack ships,
land, or air targets the ship that the helo is assigned to has better
weapons and fire control.  if the land target is too big, we just send
in the marines.

Take a close look at those Cobras.. they have MARINES painted along the
tail boom.

The USN actually has a healthier attitude towards ground support than the
USAF, with some solid planes like the A-6 and the much maligned F/A-18.

    'body' => 'Okay here are some draft rules for using long range planetary defence
missiles.  They are intended for use in BL, but I think that they could be
modified to suit nearly any system.  They are intended to allow TL 6-8
worlds who invest enough of their global means in this area to protect
themselves against small to moderate threats.  I assume that the defender
is using conventional rockets with nuclear warheads and active or passive
radar homing, about 3000 km SR).  An example is provided at the end.
Missile design:
I used the figures from a number of sources, including those on Missouri
Archive.  Rather than use the Hull design sequences from FF&S1 I assume
that the structure ratios are :
TL 6 15%
TL 7 10%
TL8 8%
for soliod fuel rockets, plus the mass of engines for Liquid fuel rockets.
This is probably far too high for SF rockets.
Rockets must be able to achieve escape velocity, , and whatever final
velocity is desired, the warhead must have sufficient additional thrust to
allow a 5 degree change of course.  Warheads are in the Megaton range.  I
designed these rules around a size 8 world, 

DETECTION
Before the missile can be launched, the planetary defenses must have a
target lock.  This is provided by a 1 hex SR radar - better if the
technology allows it.  (Assume something like all the large radio
telescopes on earth are arranged as part of a national defence grid, Jodrel
bank etc)  PDM radar detection attempts are carried out first.  Following
this , before any other sensor locks are attempted, LR PD Missiles are
launched (Unlike normal missiles.) 

LAUNCH
To successfully launch a PDM is a DIFFICULT task of RCV operations or
Ships\' weapons (MIssiles) at TL6.  This task is AVERAGE at TL 7 and EASY at
TL 8.  If a failure occurs, the weapons cannot be launched that turn, but
the task may be attempted again in the future.  If a CRITICAL failure
occurs, the weapon explodes on, or shortly after, launch, and is destroyed.

PLOTTING
Immediately before they are launched, the target, the hex that the target
will be intercepted in, and the turn on which the interception will take
place, are recorded. The flight path of the missile is laid down at this
time, and must be in one of the twelve cardinal directions, and if along a
hexspine, which side of the hexside that the missile will run along is also
recorded. (Because of their largely Ballistic trajectory and slightly sub 1
G speed, the chance of them hitting anything else are pretty remote, but
see optional rule 1 below)  The missile is placed in the Planets hex facing
the hexside or hexspine it will traverse next, and may be detected and
fired upon normally.

MOVEMENT
Missiles are moved just like normal spacecraft, having their moves
\'plotted\' in the plotting phase according to their predetermined flight
path, and moved IN the movement phase, unlike normal missiles.  Missiles
whose final velocities are between .6 and 1.3 Ghours move in the following
movement phase.  YThos with velocities less than.6 move every other turn,
those with velocities more than 1.3 and less than 2 move a second hex every
other turn etc.  

TARGET STATUS
The missile is treated as a target of whatever size it is, typically this
will be micro or sub Micro.  It is classed as not micro-evading for
absolute range effects.  (If auto task rules are in effect - and they ought
to be - then with any half-decent sensor and laser defenses, most of these
will be destroyed.)  Nuclear Dampers may be used in the usual way.


DETONATION
If a successful interception occurs, and after surviving any defensive
fire, the missile contoler may attemp to damage the target craft.  To do so
the controler must make a sensor lock (including all the usual modifiers)
based on the planet based sensor at the appropriate level of difficulty, or
using the vessels own missiles own sensor (base level of DIFFICULT)
To detonate the missile within effective range of the target is a
FORMIDABLE task of the appropriate asset.
The difficulty level is modified as follows:
- -2 levels if the target is NOT micro-evading[Note penalties for
microevading are not large simply because over the course of a brilliant
lances turn (half an hour) the  0.1g spent on such manouvers (which have to
be constantly kept up to avoid incoming beam weapon fire - which is all
types of fire in BL)  results in very little deviation from flight path.
Balanced against this is the fact that the hex based BL system reduces an
infinite number of vectors to just a few.]
- -1 level if using a multiple warhead
+1 level if the target successfully evades,(or plus the appropriate numbers
of levels if an oustanding success occurs
Size modifiers do not apply [Note since you are not trying to hit the damn
thing, just get as close as you can, it makes Littlewoods odds whether it
is sub micro or large (a 1million disp. ton spherical ship has a diameter
of only 300m.  I would not recomend firing on any major combatant over
1Megadisp.tons - you might annoy it!).  Any miss is a miss for beam weapons.]

Results of Detonation task:
If a success results, the missile detonates within a d10 (1-10) times 100km
of the target.
If an outstanding success occurs the missile detonates within a d10 (1-10)
times 10km of the target.
If a failure occurs the missile detonates within a d10 (1-10) times 1000km
of the target
If a catastrophic failur occurs the missile detonates so far away as to
have no effet.
regardless of the result place a white out marker in the hex.

I am still working on the efects on sensors and hull integrity.  for
interest\'s sake, at 500m meters a 100 MT weapon can vapourise an Av 30 BSD
hull.  at 10 km very little. though it delivers enoughh energy to raise the
temperature of a 1cm thick BSD hull by 2625 degrees K assumin a specific
heat of .2Calories per gram per degree.  I am still looking into the sudden
changes in temperature likely, but I do not know how to do the
physics...something about the Stefan Bolzman constant...

Optional rules,
1) It s possible that if you are in the right place at the right time
albeit inadvertantly, you might hit it.  use the rules above but assume a
base difficulty level to detonate of IMPOSSIBLE

2) at TL 7+ multiple warheads may be used (you will have to figure out what
their mass cost size and propellant requirements are, and if I get time I
will post some)  These are 4 (TL 7) or 5 (TL8) warheads set to form a
pattern around the target. (Imagine a tetrahedron for the first and two
tetrahedrons back to back for the second)  the effect is to reduce the
level of difficulty by one.  additional (at TL 8) you may subtract 1 from
the d10 roll for the range after determing success.[Maybe this should be -1
from the dr for TL7 and -2 from the DR at TL 8]

3) rules for dummy and decoy warheads????

I would be interested to hear any feedback.  This should be read in
conjunction with my original post on nukes of the 18th of September 98.

I *LOVED* the old A6\'s.  Those guys (the A6 drivers) pretty much could drop
the load on a dime & give back change.  I imagine the A10 drivers can do the
same pretty much.

Mind you, there is still the problem in a joint environment of getting the
whole air picture to work together.  As I understand it, the ATO process
is today better by two orders of magnitude than it was during the Gulf
War.  Mind you, one presumes that this is based on secure, robust,
high-bandwith comms - things that are going to be difficult to come by in
a hostile EW environment.

Getting back to Traveller, this reinforces in my mind the mind-numbing
complexity of doing a planetary assault against a prepared defender (in
particular, the Imperial assault on Earth at the end of the Solomani Rim
War), where you need to coordinate not only the traditional operational
environments (air, maritime, sub-surface and land), but also the orbital
and space environments.  Hope your MTO (mission task order) process is up
to it. Brings a whole new meaning to the term Battlespace Visualisation!

Ditzie notes that if a 450 megajoule laser will punch a warship\'s armour,
then you arent putting enough armour on your warships.

This isnt strictly true.

As an example, lets assume a small, basic MCr 15 or so fighter - about 20
dtons, a single laser and a couple of missiles. Pulls about 4 gees,
includes a crew of two and a bunk.

Now, as a combat ship, it is useless - it cannot hurt real warships.

But as a customs and excise vessel, or for patrol, or to deal with
ethically-challenged civilians, it\'s quite cost-effective.

Just because something cant stand in line of battle doesnt mean it wont be
built.

Someone posted a list of proposed G:T books that was apparently on the
Steve Jackson Games webpage.

The proposed \'Interstellar Economics\' rulebook could be an amalgam of
Merchant Prince, Pocket Empires, The World Tamers\' Handbook (does
anybody know where I can find a copy of World Tamers\'?) and the some of
the various house rules I\'ve seen eg. Robert Eaglestone\'s trade rules.

[ URL http://www.metronet.com/~washi/Tas ]

Some thoughts for comment and criticism :-

i. Cultural attitudes, rather than a separate \'Culture\' score, influence
the propensity to engage in external trade.
These are the primary determinants (radical vs. conservative,
enterprising vs. stagnant, xenophobic vs. xenophilic, etc.)
Government type and law level are factored into these (World Builder\'s
Handbook, Grand Census).

ii. Trade increases with tech level, at least over the range of common
tech levels. (Information is the only valuable commodity once you can
create everything else as required!)

iii. Starport quality varies with, but is not a determinant of, the
propensity to trade in itself (as it is already a significant
contributor to tech level).
The better the starport, the greater the volume of trade that can go
through it. The only limits are world (system) population and Gross
World Product.

iv. A Gross World (System) Product is a primitive marker, but
defining it as we do for contemporary economies (goods + services
produced, or private spending + government spending + investment +
exports - imports) should be more than sufficient.

The credit exchange rate is analogous to the Purchasing Power Parity
index (US = 100 ; all other countries rated on a basket of goods and
services that can be bought in that country with an equivalent amount of
currency).

v. Relating the credit to income, which correlates well with production
of visible goods, is a reasonable baseline.
Alternatives would include pegging the currency to a commodity eg. the
total cost of manufacturing .1 gram of 99.99995% pure iridium at Tech
Level 9 is defined as 1 credit ; or, the gigacredit (10e9) is defined as
the value of the power generated by a TL 9 fusion plant (1000MWe) in a
standard year, etc.

There\'s obviously a plot going on. Clearly Ontario government has been

So, once Delphi arrives (many thanks to Chris Olsen), I will translate all

After all, conversion is easy! :-)

Last week I got a panicked call from one of my colleagues. She\'d been
writing some very steamy personal letters on the system here, and saving
them in the default directory. Last year that was the private directory of
her own account, but when the brain-dead wombats changed things this
summer they made Word default to a public directory. Anna was almost in
tears that someone might read the letters. I showed her how to move them
to her private directory (not obvious, as the public directory was only
accessible throuhg Word - go figure). If encryption was available, Anna
would be using it now!

And no, I didn\'t read the letters.  I would _never_ read a lady\'s pribvate
correspondence. At least, not when she\'s standing there ;-)

I rather liked the way it was described to me. 

"Shove your arm down its throat until you can rip its lungs out."

Of course that requires unlikely targeting skills. But it *does* ensure
that the dog is too busy choking and strangling to do anything further
to you.

Hmmm. I wonder what a TL-15 equivalent would be? 

It occurs to me that using a fusion rocket would be a *good* idea.
Sure, it attracts heat seekers. And they get *fried* before they get
close enough. And you just hover over anybody you don\'t like. :-)

There\'s a 1950s issue of Astounding Science Fiction that has a cover
picture of some sort of museum exhibit of weapons. Stone ax, sword, etc
up to an atomic bomb. And then the final item in the chain, labeled
"the deadliest weapon".

An ordinary manila file folder.

There\'s a lot of truth to that. I\'d say that *knowledge* is number one,
with communications a close second.

I *LOVED* the old A6\'s.  Those guys (the A6 drivers) pretty much could 
drop the load on a dime & give back change.  I imagine the A10 drivers 
can do the same pretty much.
========================

The A10 drivers kick butt.  They operate at LOW altitude (ie below 500 
feet) and the A10 can turn on the change from that dime.  They don\'t 
have goodies like FLIR, but the techs in the Gulf put a video monitor in 
the cockpit, and hooked it up to the IR sensor on one of the Maverick 
missiles, and, voila!  Homebrewed FLIR!  (at least till you fire that 
last Maverick)  As an engineer, I can say the A10 (and the venerable A6) 
are marvels of design, good range, heavy loads, built like flying brick 
$%!+ houses, able to take it and dish it right back at you.  Hell, the 
gatling fires, IIRC, 1800 rnds/minute of depleted uranium rounds, the 
case and round together is big as my forearm, it\'ll cut a tank to shreds 
in a heartbeat, besides being able to use missiles and bombs.  I DONT 
want to be caught on the ground by one of these.  Dropping the A10 is 
one of the USAFs worst no brained decisions.

You misunderstand me. The above is exactly what I mean by programming. That
information must be entered at the starship registration office. But the
chip have no way of knowing that it is true.

Now I\'m going to propose an assumption. It is _not_ canonical and I do not
claim that it is, OK? The assumption is this: The Imperial Navy will
absolutely _require_ a transponder variant that can lie. These special
transponders can be stolen and put on the black market.

Why would I bother to do that? Since I don\'t accept them in the first place,
it is a matter of some indifference to me whether they make sense or not and
I can look at the question as a purely mental excersise.

Are not! Waaaah!

And even if they were, it wouldn\'t alter the fact that they conflict with
other parts of the canon. You may not like the fact that Traveller had a
life before you began playing, but you\'re going to have to learn to live
with it. The Traveller canon did not start with MT.

Try rewriting that with America as the 3I and the rest of the G7 as the
neighbors.

So you think that just because 90% of Tukera\'s trade is inside its own
borders it won\'t scream like a tigress losing its cubs when the remaining
10% is cut off? Come to that, how much of the Solomani megacorporations\'
trade is internal?

Well, the Solomani may not like the idea of a widespread spy network that
tells the TRUTH about their ship movements. But the real crux is: How can
they be sure that the system won\'t lie for the Imperials? Because the
Imperials solemnly assured them that it wasn\'t set up to do that? Riiiight...

OK. For the purpose of my RPG societies I assume that they don\'t starve but
they don\'t have much left over after paying for food and lodging, either.
So I feel justified in using their wages as a basic unit.

Well, I\'ve not gotten into this thread, but I have to say, the training 
I\'ve had basically says, know how to use whatever you have at hand, so 
dont be surprised if I meet a burglar with a towing chain in one hand, 
and a rolling pin in the other.  =)  The style?  My mentor calls it 
ninjutsu.  Is it the real ninjutsu?  I don\'t know, but I do know this 
guy has the most unusual style of fighting I\'ve ever seen, and I know he 
can do some pretty amazing things in a fight.

I\'ve been told a similar story from Vietnam.  My friend was on patrol, 
when they came upon a similar patrol of NVA regulars.  They got on the 
horn, got hold of a flight of F4s whose target had been cancelled.  They 
came in on this "concentration" of NVAs, each dropped 4 500 lb bombs,

*confused look* as a SFB veteran, I am confused about this 8-15% survival

Seriously, the "8 to 15%" number doesn\'t refer to survival, it refers
to the chance of my example ten-craft fighter squadron doing damage
on a single battle pass. This was in a TL12 environment, versus the
hardest foe to hit, using my alternate Fighter Controller and
Suicide Attack rules. Every round the fighters don\'t get zapped
(and there should be many, if there are enough capital ships to
shoot at) the fighters get to try again.

For the record, this is perhaps the most often requested addition I have
received. And every time, I have politely refused, for two reasons:

a) I am not an Excel expert, and have no idea on how to to it.
b) It breaks the cross-platform nature of the spreadsheet. I\'ve strived to
keep it portable - my only concessions were the excel macros, whihc Simon
wrote.

Now, having said that...if anyone out there wants to add such controls to
their spreadsheets, you have my COMPLETE blessing. I think its a wonderful
idea. And you can consider this statement to be my permission to distribute
such a change if you pull it off...just give me a little credit for making
the first version.

Basically, I consider my spreadsheet to be the "baseline". It supports very
few if any optional rules. I\'m doing that on purpose. And again, there are
no real "bells and whistles" either. Again, on purpose. But I strongly
encourage people out there to make their own versions of the spreadsheet and
offer them to the rest of the Traveller community...all I ask is:

a) Note that it is a variant, and explain what the differences are. Thus
people understand what you\'re doing different from the core rules.
b) Make sure you put your name on it, so people know that I didn\'t make the
change (thus, I can\'t be blamed :) )
c) You change it...you support the change...
d) As I said before, leave my name and the names of the other contributers
in it.

Rob...I would be pleased to look at any changes you or your students make.
And if said changes fit into my shceme of doing things, I\'d be happy to make
your version the new excel version...if not, you\'re certainly free to post
it yourself.

For the record folks, the newest version of the spreadsheet should be out
RSN...it won\'t have the BL/BR stats completely done yet (sorry), but it has
a couple of serious bug fixes. The biggie has been grav compensators and
(ACK) power plants...they were calculating scale efficiences _completely_
wrong. Ack ack ack...

Traders and Gunboats plans were designed with the 10% "slop rule" - i.e. if
the deckplan matches up to the tonnage of the vessel within 10%, its
acceptable.

On my own deckplans (drawn by hand alas) I often have structures or
sections which do not handily fit into the drawn deckplans (streamlining
fairings, \'wings\', pylons or structural bits for example) and I account for
those spaces "off plan", usually as fuel volume.  This tends to free up
more space for the other deck components like staterooms, corridors, Dining
Salons, etc.

Deckplans are more art than science in my book.  That they do not precisely
fit into the proscribed volume requirements in not terribly important to
me.  There are, however, often sections that cannot be expressed by the
deckplans easily.  Their role is to provide an idea of space and
environment for players on their ships and other\'s ships, and allowing the
GM to decide how long it will take the engineer to reach the engine room
from his or her cabin after the first big rumbling jolt occurs.

Of course, the deckplan volume should be within an order of magnitude of
the correct volume, and preferably within the 10% margin.  As long as its
not the players over-designing their own ship or adding to the cargo or
passenger capacity though, its pretty moot.

My brother was marching down a road with his unit when they saw

_then_ they heard an A-10\'s engines.

Their CO complained that the simulation hadn\'t been realistic. The
Air Force obliged with a live-fire demonstration of the same attack pass
(even same pilot, same plane) on that same stretch of road (while it was 
unoccupied, of course).

The entire stretch of road for almost a thousand feet was cratered with
holes about six inches deep.

During that same excercise, my brother was in a control tower for

only a three-storey tower.

But don\'t bother with Excalibur in Malden Center.  It went out of business
finally.  They had so much old stock (although I\'d cleared out their
Traveller stuff long ago) I wondered what, on their floor, they\'d been
selling to pay the rent.  CCGs probably.

Aside from them, there is a store called "Your Move Games" on Highland Ave
in Somerville in Davis Square (which is on the Red Line).  Its a small
place on the second floor which is more of place that will order stufff for
you than one to stock a lot.  I be tthey have all GURPS stuff though.

If you are checking the Yellow PAges, realize that Phoenix Games in Medford
is pretty much just miniatures (and no, they have no Traveller Specific
minis at all).  They have few RPGs.

No it is not posible.  Any system built can be spoofed.  The very act of
creating a antispoof system also creates a way to spoof it.  This is a fact.
No unbeatable system has ever been designed.  There are hard to beat systems
but even those are regularly beaten by lone teenagers out to prove how smart
they are.

As for \'anti-disconnecting system\', there are several ways to implement this
function and all can be bypassed.  Any \'ping\' signal can be forged, any
antitamper connecter can be tampered with.  The only way to make a system
even remotely \'tamperproof\' to a professional would be a contiously
reflected standing wave signal in all wave guides.  This would make a system
so touchy that it would fire the tamper circuit in any high EMI enviroment,
or during reentry (the torcion would deform the wave guides enough to change
the standing wave), any attempt at any repair in any part of the system
including the main computer, shuting down any part of the system, and
hundreds of other everday occurences.  You can not make a device for dayly
use my normal people foolproof.  The necessary redundancy and ruggedness
that would have to be built into a commercial product would make it
vunerable.  Without this ruggedness you have a system that fails so often
that it is useless.  Technomiricals just do not happen.  Your untouchable
unbeatable box can exist because someone built it.  That it can be built
means it can be rebuilt for a different purpose.  Your argument the it is
not built but taught is not valid sence this teaching is just another form
of signal fingure printing.  The \'simi-inteligent\' chips are no more
decurning than an inteligent being with the proper instramentation.  Both
can be fooled.  Niether is foolproof.

A very basic check system.  Nothing new in this discription and nothing
\'foolproof\'.  Easily spoofed.  Their are far more secure structures than
this.  This is not even up to the current encryption standard for internet
business use and it has been compromized on many occasions.


One thing you keep conveniently egnoring is the effect of this perfect
technology.  If such a perfect system that keeps perfect records of
everything existed then you would end up with a perfect mess.  Complete
record of all ship movments would be available to ANY official in ANY habor
for verification reason.  So you know were everybody is all of the time.
You know where every cargo began it\'s journey and ended it\'s trip.  No
secrecy.  No privacy.  NO FREEDOM!  NO SAFETY.  By it\'s very nature this
system is a deathtrap to the Empire that uses it.  Sure you have near
absolute control of travel but NO ONE want that least of all the Empirial
Inteigence Corps.  Such extensive UNFORGABLE records would make clandestine
operationms imposible for the Empire because there would always be some
\'free trader\' squawk box that knew that so-and-so or such-in-such was not
true and it would tell everyone it met until the secret was out.  

The USA could eliminate crime by going to \'cred cards\' but they will never
do it because they need \'hard currency\' and a free market to maintain their
own ability to perform undercover operation.  These \'cred cards\' would work
just like your transponders tracking every exchange of value and cross
checking   them with all other trasactons making it imposible for anyone to
do anything without a record existing.  No one wants that.  The transponder
system as you interpret it would bring free trade to it\'s knees and free
trade is the avowed purpose for the Empire.

Ai ya!

That\'s why I wrote "eight to fifteen percent chance to be effective," and
used a more squishy "most" figure for casualty rates.

Although, if you take PT boats against cruisers, I would consider "most" to
be a fairly accurate description (especially since the capital ship will be
using its smaller weapons on the fighters -- weapons that won\'t be used in
the fight against other capital ships anyway except in an anti-missile or
sensor-scrubbing role).

BTW, Ian, what is SFB? Star Fleet Battles? Me confused is.

This isnt strictly true.

As an example, lets assume a small, basic MCr 15 or so fighter - about 20
dtons, a single laser and a couple of missiles. Pulls about 4 gees,
includes a crew of two and a bunk.

Now, as a combat ship, it is useless - it cannot hurt real warships.

But as a customs and excise vessel, or for patrol, or to deal with
ethically-challenged civilians, it\'s quite cost-effective.

Just because something cant stand in line of battle doesnt mean it wont be
built.

Ian Whitchurch



It all comes back to the point of what my ship are toting.  These are MCr
      85, with Stutterwarp drives and the ability to perform extended
      system missions. They are armed with the spinals and that all, but
      they also have advanced stealth and pull 6 gees.  Yes you 20 ton
      fighter is not going to mean all that much in combat, but mine can
      move into a new facing many times thoughout the 30 minute combat
      turn.  But I will agree that many things are built for missions other
      than straight combat.  There are many jobs in which a combat ship is
      a liability rather than an advantage since the weapon systems take up
      so much of it available space.

My brother was marching down a road with his unit when they saw

Their CO complained that the simulation hadn\'t been realistic. The
Air Force obliged with a live-fire demonstration of the same attack pass
(even same pilot, same plane) on that same stretch of road (while it was
unoccupied, of course).

The entire stretch of road for almost a thousand feet was cratered with
holes about six inches deep.

During that same excercise, my brother was in a control tower for
a small airfield. He watched an A-10 fly by below him - and it was
only a three-storey tower.

For those interested, you can see a variation of this \'sacrifice\'
technique explained in the context of knife fighting at
http://www.gunsite.net/videos/index.htm.  Take a look at the video clips
from _Tactical Edged Weapons I_.

I have found the Gunsite videos incredibly interesting.

As far as transponders go, I think they would have to have auxiliary jacks for installation procedures, or at least a timeframe to connect it before blowing the security circuit (perhaps 30 sec?).

NEW DISADVANTAGE FOR GURPS TRAVLLER

Dead										-300 points
	A character with this disadvantage is already dead before play begins.
Such 
a character may not move, think, speak, breathe, or in any way interact
with the game
world. "Dead characters may perform no actions of any kind; they are dead!"
Roleplay it!
In any campaign where ressurrection is possible, the GM may elect to allow
a dead character
who loses this disadvantage to buy it off with experience.
	Special Note: In GURPS Traveller, at the moment this disadvantage is
selected for a
character, the player must cease creating that character and begin a new
one.
	Special Note # 2: In GURPS Wizardry, a character who picks up this
disadvantage during play
may still join his companions at the Inn at the end of the adventure.

(Note: i remember seeing this somewhere, so decided to adapt it <g>)

That information can never be changed.  Sure you might be able to arrange for
the list to say "Captain Schmoe" instead of "Captain Schmuck" as the first
Captain, and then update it for a different name.  It\'s relatively easy to
"update" this,too, due to selling the ship, death or changing of Captains, etc
etc.  The point is a running history is kept.  U initially put in Captain
Schmoe (assuming you get away with it w/o arousing "suspicion") and decide you
want to skip payments.  You go to Starship Registration and say "Captain
Schmoe has sold me his ship" and they update it.  The trasnponder still tells
everyone Captain Schmuck once owned it, and allows the bounty hunters sent by
the bank to have the starport not allow your ship in the traffic patterns.
The same for piracy,etc.

And you may not like the fact that the official universe keeps going after you
started playing.  Traveller "canon" did not end w/ original Traveller.  Can
you live w/ that?  ; ) Or just try to pretend it never happened?  It didn\'t
stay stuck in a rut in the road, but developed and improved.  I rather like
the older stuff, in fact, even if it is sometimes inconsistent.  I\'ve
certainly been paying rather ghastly amounts of money to acquire the items i
want.

Why would I change the subject?  lol.  Different situation, different time,

It\'s far more likely that Solomani are hurt far more than the imperials.  You
admit it\'s workable for the the foreign polities to put them on ships for
trade.  You\'re not just trying to be dense, are you?

Riiiight...

No, because they learned bout the system and how it operates.  Maybe they have
acquired knowledge through espionage or another means.  Its possible.  How are
their ship movements uncovered?  You\'re not setting up a straw man for
yourself, are you? There is this little "mute" button.

Assuming no further discoveries in the (near, much less far) future...  is
this unlikely to change in 3600 years?  Again, assuming no further discoveries
or inventions... this can\'t be improved or compensated for to the point it

An intelligent (lobotimized) being that has access to a databank.  It\'s a
living computer.  The method by which it records information is unforgable (at
least at TL15).  It\'s not any more far fetched that an intelligent microchip
could tell the difference whether it\'s been hooked up to a real computer and
comm system than it is for said intelligent chip to exist at all, is it?

Only how the transponder recorded and verified it\'s information was detailed
(though you have to accept the workings of the Cymbeline predator in Signal GK
w/ the additional info in Survival Margin) for it to work.  Everything else
was left unexplained, including how to build the box (because the writers
weren\'t 57th century EEs).  Maybe you *know* what will and won\'t be possible
in electronics in 36+ centuries, but not me.  It\'s no more improbable than
laser weapons w/ useful range (much less meson weapons or jump drives)...

Try to imagine somebody you could get 50,000 children to agree that they
hate. (Hell, try imagining 50,000 kids doing anything all at once).

Between 40K and 50K kids showed up to welcome Nelson Mandela
last week and when the Premier stepped on stage - 50,000 booing
kids. An awesome sight to be, uh, be-hear.

ObTrav: The Children of the Marches! I wonder if it made a tour of
elementary shools in the marches. I wonder if ever kid got a sticker for
each ship it brought down. Dedicating a warship to school children is,
well, uh, warped at best.

Mmm... no.  The transponder only kept a current and running history of the
registry, not everywhere it went, what it did,etc etc.  Only when the Captain
changed, teh ship name changed, etc etc.  Easy there, I least of anyone want
to trample on your free traders\' freedom. : )

  As something of an aside, the apparent lack of ideologies in much of
the Trav universe (at least at the interstellar level) does remove one
substantial way for recruiting agents in your targets structure. At
least in the Imperium even a loyalty to your region, institution, or
personal overlord shouldn\'t exclude some degree of loyalty to the 3I
as a whole.

  OTOH, the Rebellion era wouldn\'t work if loyalty to the 3I were both
primary and substantial.

It\'s ludicrous that they\'d put them in w/o knowing what they were, so

their own espionage is successful enough to tell them what\'s in there.  The

There\'s no way to prove to a foriegn government that these transponders
aren\'t spy boxes that will tell the Imperium everything whenever the ship
enters Imperial space - unless you\'re willing to give the secret to
foriegn powers.

Giving critical secrets to foriegn powers would require a much higher
level of trust than the OTU seems to indicate.

Even if you tell them what\'s in the box, the nature of the thing
(untamperable) makes it impossible for the foriegn power to control
what it does, or check to see that it only does what you said it would.

(Unless you\'re willing to give tamperable boxes to your enemies...)

When you think about it, it shouldn\'t be too hard to make these things
into spy boxes. They already access commo, computer and sensors
on a foriegn ship, you could at least have it record ship traffic, base
locations and signal traffic for ELINT. Dump the stuff in an extra channel
next to the one the Deyo chip uses to babble with - the Deyo signal
is uncrackable, so a signal added to it should be uncrackable as well.
The Navy may have some special boxes like this already - or may
have designed all transponders to have a special, secret mode like
this that a Navy transponder signal can unobtrusively switch on.

The ease with which this could be done would make any foriegn power
crazy to put these on ships that go anywhere _but_ the Imperium - they\'d
probably have to operate from a few secure bases already known to the
Imperium if the Impies forced these transponders on them. Have one
ship that enters Imperial space, transfer to another ship that will take
the trade goods back into Zho or Alsan space.

I much prefer the idea of foriegn ships being foriegn, not tied in to the
Imperial ship traffic control system. That Aslan courier shouldn\'t be
sqauwking an Impie transponder code, it should have an Aslani ID
signal. Sure this gets them more attention from the Navy and such,
but foriegn ships should get that anyway.

"Captain, we\'re being hailed. I don\'t recognize the ID code."
"Relax, Mr. Peppin. That\'s an Aslani signal...looks like the
Ambassador is early..."

be able to answer them.

	1) Is it appropriate to ask questions here concerning GURPS

	2) It states in the book that the alternate timeline takes
place in the year 1120.  (p. 9, the section In a Nutshell [continued]
- - quote: It is now the 1120th year of that Third Imperium....).
Yet the current TNS entry is dated 289-1116.  Any particular reason
for the difference?

	3) The section on starship combat states that combat is fought
on a hex map where the hex is about 10,000 miles.  The Space Weapons
Table on p. 173 gives the range of the weapons in 2,000 mile hexes.
Shouldn\'t these numbers in the table be divided by 5?

	4) In the Direct Fire Phase of the Space Combat Sequence under
determining damage it says Subtract target DR (modifier by armor

Nope, you do that so that encryption is the norm, and there\'s no way to
easily tell the messages that realy _need_ to be encrypted from the rest
of the message traffic.

Also, privacy, to many in the US, is a right, not a privelege...as it
stands now e-mail is not private...any number of prying eyes can read
this message along the way to your screen.

There\'s a fairly decent history of e-mailed plaintext love letters
coming back to bite the sender in the nether regions.

If the only encrypted messages you send are the important ones, that
filters them right out for the big brother types.

Relevant to this discussion are two points:

Encryption is always breakable, eventually, therefore encryption is a
poor way to permanently secure information, often spectacularly so.
Permanent protection of secrets should never rely on encryption, but on
physical control of the secret.

The aim with encryption is to prevent the enemy from knowing your secret
long enough for the secret to become stale and useless. A key for a
single transaction need only be unbreakable for the life of that
transaction, which may be only moments. The strength of the key is
inversely proportional to the length of time you need to secure the
information. 56 bit DES is perfectly acceptable for information to be
used within the hour, but if you\'re using it to protect accounting data
for permanent archival, you\'re in trouble.

There are also techniques coming into use today that interleave
encrypted information within otherwise innocuous messages, a technique
called \'winnowing and chaffing\' (iirc). See the current issue of
Scientific American for an article about encryption, its strengths and
weaknesses (by Phil Zimmerman himself.).

The gurps mailing list (gurpsnet-l@io.com) might be more likely to know
answers, if they relate directly to GURPS, though there\'s some crossovers in
any case.

The divergence is in 1116, with the emperor not being assassinated, at a guess.

Under the description for X-ray lasers, it indicates that they divide DR by 2. 
That means it has an armor divisor of 2.

Well, I\'ve discussed what I think one "needs".  It is true that
one may want other books, but that is true of any system and
I think GURPS gives you as much for the buck as any game.

Regarding flavor.  The point of the system is that the game
mechanic imparts as little flavor to the game as possbile.
"Flavor" comes from the background and, at least for me,
GURPS Traveller takes on a Traveller flavor.

"Assumeing makes an ASS out of U and ME."

The laws of physics are not likely to change in these three dimentions in
ANY length of time.  There has NEVER in history been an unbeatable security
system.  If a thing can be built it can be beaten.  YOU propose that such a
system can exist.  Very well, prove it!  You say that the technology can
exist, discribe how it works.  I do not expect you to invent it.  All I ask
is some theorum that might posibly let it exist.  You have not proposed
anything that can do what you say it should be able to do.  Your system
could be broken by a moderately competant EE or hacker with a fast computer.
It does not matter what stores the data the data is known and the data is
store the storage method can and will be decoded.  You do not understand the
nature of what you are discribing.  The technobable makes you this is a new
concept.  It is not.

I have signal GK.  I have run it.  I know how the processes discribed.  They
are part of my job.  What they discribe is remotely plausible under the
specific condition they discribe.  If you had the knowledge then you would
know that with the proper equipment a person could read and understand the
mind and memories of that chip just as with the proper equipment (which does
not yet exist)you could record the entirety of one human\'s existance.  It is
also posible to exactly duplicate both!  If these things are posible then
your chips could be cloned.  

Those chips are not so suffisticated that it would require this level to
duplicate.  The circuit scaner in signal GK was enough to recognise and
recognise the partial schematic inside the life form.  A slightly modified
scanner combined with the proper electronic probes could have been used to
clone that chip and it\'s program and data.  Bang instant duplicate.  There
are any number of fabs in business TODAY that could do this with their TL8
gear.  It is done ervery day.  In signal GK the chip itself admits that it
could no longer produce the high quality copies of itself and it\'s circuits
that could be done with the help of human technology.  The tech discribes is
at best mid 20th century.  We use the processes discribed today.

If the data exactly duplicates what it expects to see within the tolerences
of reality itself it could not know the difference.  Know being of
instrament could.  Reality (to a living being) is what we percieve NOT what
it is that we do not percieve.  If we can not percieve a diference then
there is no diference.  Remember the the signal GK chip had to be given new
sences and taught to use them before it come deal with the human crew.  All
it had was a very short range radio direction finder system.  The writer of
signal GK had a good graps of what was posible for the lifeforms he
portrayed.  You do not.  You have yet to explain how the signals the chips
sends out differ in any qualitative way that would prevent them from being
duplicated.  That the chips are alive is not relavant in the least.  How are
their signal unforgable?  They can not modulate the EM spectrum in a unique
way.  That is limited by physics.  They may speak their own language but
that can be learned by a linguiestics program.  Culture can be imulated
through experience.  And if their mutation rate is \'slow and predictable\'
then that which can predict it can be use to falsify it.  Everything you use
to say they are unforgable proves that they are forable.  It one chips can
figure out what the other chip should be saying then so can a computer or a
person.  The fact they can recognize each other means that other people can
as well and forge that identity.

You have accused another resonder that he will not believe you because he
refuses to do so in the face of your logic.  You are guilty of the same
offence.  You say something is SO because it is what you WANT to be so.  You
freely admit that you are not an EE yet you claim insight into electronic
that is superior to that of a praticing EE.  Do you make a habit of going to
a doctor or other professional and then discarding his opinion in perference
to your own when you have no first hand knowledge in that field?

You abmit the the traveller adventure contradics you but still you say you
are right.  How can this be?  Can you reconsile the conflict?  If not the
can you at least be reasonable to admit that you could be wrong.

Also you did not address the sociological effects that would come from your
version of the transponder that I and others pointed out.  How do you
explain that the traveller universe as discribed in canon has not been
effected by such far reaching bigbrotherism?

You just contradicted yourself.  You said it could not be forged because of
the \'chatterbox\' function and all the data that was swapped like what ships
it met and when ect.  Also how would anybody know what was going on in the
sealed box if they were not allowed to inspect it?  How would you force the
free merchants of the merchant merine to use them if they all said no?  They
are organized you know.  A nice Empire wide boycott untill the Empire
starved or opened the books up to expert repesntatives of the MM.  Sorry, it
just does not work.  The \'chatterbox\' concept would either make the Empire
into something it is not or it would be removed.  And do not try to say that
people would not know they were exchanging the data.  It is sent in the EM
sectrum so it can be intercepted and any signal can be decoded with enough
examples and as the box talks all the time...

    'body' => 'The G:Traveller ship design system includes power plants as parts of 
components -- while this does simplify matters, it tends to generate
a slight excess of power plant, and has really strange effects when
doing things such as adding weaponry to a ship.  It also causes problems
for mapping, if you want to know how big your power plant is.  I made
this stuff for the playtest, separating out the power plant from major
power-using components, but it was either not wanted or lost in the noise
(signal/noise ratio in the G:T playtest could have been higher).  This also
includes a few other useful modules, such as variable size spinal weaponry.

Module: \'power plant\'
    At TL 10, 4 tons, $0.4 million.  Produces 40 megawatts.
    At TL 12, 4 tons, $0.2 million.  Produces 40 megawatts.
Module: \'capacitor\'
    At TL 10, 8 tons, $1.6 million.  Holds 80 MWH of power.
    At TL 12, 8 tons, $1.6 million.  Holds 120 MWH of power.
    Note that I am including access space in capacitors, which is non-standard.
Module: \'unpowered utility module\'.
    10.5 tons, $0.2M.  Draws 1 MW per 50 spaces with artificial gravity
    (10 MW for the entire component).  For small craft, the real cost for
    artificial gravity is 1 ton and $20k per 50 spaces or fraction (the
    remaining .5 tons is for the airlock).  Normally, the power usage might
    as well be included in the module, since it\'s fairly rare that
    artificial gravity will be turned off.
Module: \'unpowered thruster\'
    At TL 10, 3.75 tons, $0.15 million.  50 tons thrust, draws 5 megawatts.
    At TL 11+, 3.75 tons, $0.75 million.  125 tons thrust, draws 12.5 MW.
Module: \'unpowered unvectored thruster\'
    At TL 10, 4 tons, $0.16M.  80 tons thrust, draws 8 MW.
    At TL 11+, 4 tons, $0.8M. 200 tons thruster, draws 20 MW.
    Most common on merchants who don\'t need high manueverability.  In
    order to land, the ship must have a contragravity unit.
Module: \'unpowered contragravity unit\'
    4 tons, 8,000 tons CG lift, draws 16 MW, costs $0.8M.  Not very useful
    without at least one thruster unit.
Module: \'unpowered jump drive\'
    At any TL: 3 tons, $3 million, draws 10 megawatts.  Note that this
    is noticeably smaller than a classic J-drive, I favored 4 tons, $2M,
    20 megawatts.
Module: \'unpowered turret Xaser\'
    At TL 10, 10.75 tons and $.98M; draws 16 MW.  Oddly enough, there does
    not appear to be sufficient space in this component for the power plant.
    At TL 12, 12 tons and $.34M (compact is discarded), draws 18 MW.
Module: \'unpowered turret laser\'
    This is a compact 270 MJ TL 10 UV laser.  It is 12 tons and $.92M,
    draws 9 MW, and does 8d*50 damage with a 1/2D of 8500 miles, max 25,500.
    This is basically inferior to the turret Xaser (despite its higher 
    damage), but might be found on some merchant ships.
Module: \'unpowered turret fusion gun\'
    As CT fusion guns only fit 2 to a turret, this is a 1.5 space weapon.
    It is also compact.  It is 1 GJ fusion gun, damage 5d*500, power
    consumption 33 MW, 1/2D 4000, max 12,000.  At TL 11 this rises to
    6d*500, 1/2D 4200, max 12,600.  Price is 2.32 million.  A fusion
    gun can fit in a turret along with one other weapon (including another
    fusion gun).
Module: \'unpowered turret PAW-X\'
    At TL 10, 12 tons and $.54M, draws 12 MW (multiply weight/cost/volume X^2);
    damage is 6d*250*X, range is 2400*X.  Beam energy is 360 MJ * X^2.
    At TL 11+, increase damage to 6d*300*X, range to 2500*X.
    Spinal versions of these weapons are possible.  Reduce weight and volume
    by 30%, cost remains the same (conveniently, the power plant is .3 spaces
    per space of weapon).  The bay mount in GT is a turret-6 (36 spaces plus
    11 spaces of power plant).  The spinal mount in GT is a spinal-40 (1120
    spaces plus 480 spaces power plant; due to my rounding conventions the
    actual weight/volume is slightly lower).  X may have a minimum value,
    though based on the G:T book it doesn\'t really (100 MJ is below threshold).
    A class T spinal mount is a PAW-100, taking up 7,000 spaces.
Module: \'unpowered turret meson-X\'
    At TL 10, 12 tons and $1.16M, draws 12 MW, all multiplied by X^2.  Damage
    is 6d*160*X, 1/2D range is 2000*X, max is 6100*X.  At TL 12, use stats
    for a TL 10 PAW.  Spinal versions are possible as above.
Module: \'unpowered meson screen\'
    The meson screen stats took me a bit of work to back-compute; it appears
    that a meson screen is a force screen (per VE) with DR multiplied by 5. 
    This means it is actually a surface component, and has no volume.  Per
    million DR-sf, this is 2 MW, .04 tons, and $0.1 million; the standard
    screen includes a 41.6 MW fusion reactor and should cost $2.288M, not
    $2.258M.  For reference, a TL 11 screen has the same power consumption,
    but twice the weight and cost.
Module: \'unpowered nuclear damper\'
    The performance for the damper unit appears wrong (looks like it _should_
    be two damper units, *8 mass for being TL 12, but that\'s only 4 tons)

This process of adding meaning text to a message to throw off code breaker
goes back the WW2 at least.  The USA, Japan, England, and the French
resistance all used this method as part of there encoding schemes.  There
are several good books on the coders and crackers of that time.  Very good
reading too.  Also the TRUE spy stories from that time are also in the clear
now.  The day to day working of the spy guys are not at all what you would
expect.  Would you believe dumpster diving and running a brothel?

I strongly recommend that in the event that you are attacked by a Bull
Terrier that you don\'t mess this up, because if you do the dog will very
likely shear a large chunk of your hand right off, without being
significantly slowed down. Personally I think that employing a gun or
baseball bat before they get that close is the way to go.

we regret.  We are currently in search of another ISP, and will
post an announcement when we have found one that is adequate.

We are not above asking for help in this effort.  We are looking
for an ISP with dialup access in the New York City area (U.S.
Area Codes 212, 718, 914, 917, 646) that offers non-commercial
accounts with the following features (MUST HAVES):

(1) Access with a 914 area code is a must.
(2) At least 5MB of personal web/ftp space.
(3) Support for the FrontPage98 Extensions on the web server to
support some present and planned features of Freelance Traveller,
and to support automatic publishing of webs.
(4) Support for low-volume mailing lists (either LISTSERV or
MAJORDOMO) with both reflector and digest capabilities
(5) No limit on connect time (i.e., flat rate monthly pricing,
not hourly, and not base monthly + hourly for use in excess of x,
unless x is _very_ high).
(6) Accessibility using non-proprietary software - specifically,
the Win95 dialup networking, Fort Agent as a news/mail reader,
and Internet Explorer or Netscape as a web browser.  This implies
PPP dialup access, POP3 mail, and NNTP news.

We are currently paying $14.95 monthly for these features (annual
contract discount - the list price is $19.95 monthly).  We are
looking for a price "in the same neck of the woods".

Desirable features (THESE ARE "EXTRA POINTS" BUT NOT ESSENTIAL):

(1) Web and mail aliases (i.e., we would like to be able to have
a URL of the form http://www.FreelanceTraveller.isp.com/ if
possible; also have mail to FreelanceTraveller@isp.com or
FreelanceTraveller%foo@isp.com or some variation routed directly
to the Editor\'s personal mailbox - although we will keep the
HotMail address for the forseeable future).  Alternatively,
forwardable additional mailboxes at no charge (or minimal charge)
would be acceptable.
(2) Support for CGI other than those provided by the FrontPage98
Extensions - note that if we get this in the form of Perl
support, we can forgo the FrontPage98 extensions entirely.
(3) Access with numbers in one or more of area codes 212, 718,
917, 646.
(4) Should not have a reputation for being a spam-haven.

If you have any suggestions, please send them to
jeff.zeitlin@mail.execnet.com; do not post them to the list.
Please include contact addresses and/or phone numbers.

In real life you can make out the flickering of the individual tracers.

I particularly like the one where they put a false wall over the entrance to
a new dean\'s office, and he couldn\'t find it.

Something along the lines of the thin CalTech does where the
students configure crazy ways of sealing their dorm room doors
and other students have to figure out how to get in.

Genzyme is a scary looking building, in a suburban kind of way.
Manicured lawns, big windows and red brick on the outside , but with
huge steel girders at angles visible through the windows.  I can see it
clearly from
my bedroom across the river.

Hmm.  Another Bostonite TMLer.

That sounds like Cross-difference.  Normally, the one side of the brain
controls all of the functions of the otherside of the body, i.e, the left
brain controls the right side, etc.  But 20% of people (80+% of
major league baseball players) have "cross-diference" which means
that the controls switch or cross about neck level.  Thus, a person with
cross difference who is left-brain dominant will be right handed but
left-eyed.  For baseball, this is a good thing because the dominant eye
is closest to the ball, while the dominant hand controls the swing to meet
the ball.  The same is true for right brain dominant people.  Sounds like
you are tend to be right brain dominant, and thus, left-handed and right-eyed

(toned down for your ambidexterity).

Some people also have an apparent switch with the feet, though I don\'t
know their to be any physiological reason.  I have cross-difference,
which makes me right handed and left-eyed (which makes it hell to shoot a
rifle normally), but I have to lead with my left foot on skateboards, and
such.
 This is called "goofy foot" in the parlance.  I think its just
environmental.

You can test yourself for cross-difference real easy.
Extend your arms straight out and form a triangle with the index fingers
and thumbs of your hands.
With both eyes open: center an object in the center of the triangle.
Close right eye and observe any change in relative position of the object.
Open right eye and close left.  Observe any change in relative position.

The eye that was open with the least change in position is your dominant eye.

If that is the same side as your dominant hand, you\'re normal.
If it is the opposite side from your dominant hand, you have cross
difference.   Good to know if you ever need to fire a gun.  Since, I can\'t
shoot a rifle properly, because firing lefty is too weird and I can\'t get
my good eye in the sights, I learned to shoot from the hip as a kid.  I\'m
not sure what Mr. Cook would say, but I was always taught to just point
and shoot and don\'t think about it.  For all I know, thats improper as hell
for real shooting, but it sure impresses the boys when we play paintball.

Yeah, but ways around these things will also improve with time.
Any claim that talks about how technology will make things
foolproof is suspect and always ignores advances that will
counter that device.

Agreed.  What man makes, man can unmake.  Besiedes, just about the time
that technology makes something more nearly foolproof, evolution will

    'body' => '     Having just looked thru my brand-new copy of G: T,  I would like to offer
my take on it.  (BTW, I am not attempting to offend anyone w/ any criticism):

Good side:
   1)  A VERY well polished product!  This alone goes a long way to making me
forget the atrocities that IG committed on T4.  The artwork was absolutely
fabulous (I have to agree w/ another poster to the list that the Aslan looks
more like a man w/ a beard and \'stache), definately light-years ahead of Foss\'
T4 art.

   2)  Extremely well laid-out...everything is in a logical order, and
reasonably clearly explained (a few more examples could have been
supplied...mostly w/ starship construction and combat).

Now the bad side (for me):

   1)  THIS IS NOT TRAVELLER!!!   This is Traveller thru a GURPS lens.  I have
always held that GURPS is a good system, but it has that word in it:  GENERIC.
I don\'t believe it can give the overiding attention to detail to the Trav
universe that a Traveller game can.  Loren Wiseman has obviously put his heart
and soul into making this project the best he can...and he deserves every
accolade that he could possible get for it.   But I truly wish that this
obvious enthusiasm could have gone into T5 w/ Mr. Miller...or that SJG would
have let this be done as a stand alone system not using GURPS.

My personal take (FWIW) is that for me and mine, the best Trav system was
MT...w/ the caveat that the idea behind MT was the best (that is, to update
and streamline CY).  I feel that looking at it from 10 years later, with all
the errata in place (the major killer to the MT system)  and the abandonment
of the Rebellion/Virus plotline (although the Rebellion is salvageable IMO)
the MT sytem came closest to doing what every system since CT
promised...making everything work w/ one simple system.  Like I said...the
errata and mistakes in the 1st printing turned a lot of people off (including
me and my group, in 88) but now having the fixes, and having tried to run all
the various systems w/ my hard-core Trav group of 3 people [ :-) ]  they have
decided that that system is the easiest to play w/ and understand from a
player standpoint.  From the GM\'s view, I have to agree.  I love the combat
system of TNE, but it was just too much for me and my group.  The starship
combat system was perfect to me, but the design sequences were too much.  T4
was a bold promise that unfortunately was murdered in the womb IMO by IG.  I
sincerely hope that T5 is NOT shelved in favor of G: T.

There is one positive note in all of this:  it is my hope that, owing to the
large number of GURPS players there are (and in Las Vegas, it seems no one has
heard of ANY incarnation of Trav, but everyone knows AD&D and GURPS)  maybe it
will be possible to bring some of these misguided <G> players into the light,
and show them what REAL Trav is!!

Personally, I\'m wondering if Marc would authorise stuff primarily written for
CT to be published.  I\'ve got some ideas that are growing from the PBEM I\'m
running, and wouldn\'t mind seeing them in print...

And, contrary to reports in the right-wing press, the teachers were trying
to make the kids shut up and be polite, not encouraging it.  \'course,
Harris knows the kids can\'t vote...

Mandela look confused. No one explained to him that his visit was
sponsored by the teachers federations that Harris has been trying to
dismantle, or that these kids were tested on material they hadn\'t studied
(because the government gave the tests, THEN released the curriculum, and
finally commissioned the textbooks to be written), or that a solution to
"not enough money" is "sell a school" (even if it will be needed in a few
years as the population of its area changes), or...

(Mike Harris is currently Premier of Ontario, although his policies seem
to be set by an advisor named Guy Giorno. Seems intent on ripping the
social fabric apart. Not bad if you\'re an already-educated healthy
employed white middle-class male in the private sector - otherwise you\'re
a problem to be solved. Scary times to live through. Gives me a new
appreciation for Dulinor\'s subjects, I tell ya.)

According to the original Traders & Gunboats, a Gazelle (with drop tanks
attached during jump) had a performance of J-4.  By using the fuel in the
tanks and dropping them (hence "drop" tanks), then jumping, it could get
J-5.  After dropping the tanks, and until they could be replaced, the
onboard fuel supply limited the ship to J-2.

Maneuver was always, M-4 with tanks attached, and M-5 dropped.

following conclusion for MTU:

In order to operate more than 6 parsecs from the "official" border, you
must have the SDG transponder installed. Non-compliance is met with
forcible siezure of vessel, pending investigation. Cooperation is expected
(and in most Zhodani cases, given quickly), as non-cooperation results in
being considered a "Hostile Invading Force" and met with violence. If in
pirate infested or other tx-hazardous environments, failure to squawk on
demand is the key point.

Also, most other interstellar govs will require THEIR Txpdr if you plan on
leaving J4 or j6 range of their "Official" border. Similar circumstances.

Also IMTU, the SDG chip need not be tied into the main computer nor the
main voice systems... IMTU, it merely needs to have it\'s own antenna and
power feeds. Since most imperial architects KNOW the needed specs, they
will rig it into the normal comm gear (unless otherwise instructed) on the
plans. I figure the Txpdr to be a roughly 6 litre box, plus 1 l or so of
connections and brackets, and the antenna being shared with the commo
system for no space requirement. I figure it has enough internal support
processing (and batteries) for doing it\'s basic job, and the ability to
continue passive ops for 2 months of no power. Each squawk is worth 1/2 day
or more off the expectancy without power....

In the state of Alaska, the state constitution guarantees the right to
privacy. (So strongly, in fact, that calling in a complaint for a neighbor
running around their house in the nude with the curtains open gets you a
peeping tom citation and attendant fine.) So taken for granted this right
is that a proposed ammendment would specify that prisoners LOSE the right
to privacy during confinement, parole terms, and probation.

Similarly, many feel that prisoners SHOULD have some right to privacy.

Ob Trav: IMTU, the imperial government specifically denies the right to
privacy for persons remanded by legitimate authority into imperial custody.

I was a paper carrier for three years in high school, and got anti-dog lessons
from my older brothers. Carry a length of pipe or a big heavy stick. Don\'t
run. Face \'em and back slowly away. Feed them the bag if they attack and then
strike to kill with the pipe. Seems most mutts will lock jaws on the first
thing they grab onto, and it that\'s not a piece of your anatomy, so much the
better. If it is a piece of your anatomy, try to make it your arm (as Leonard
suggests) and shove it deeper into their jaws (evidently it\'ll take less
damage that way -- never got to try that part out, thank ghod) while you bash
their spine with the pipe...

This technique won\'t work against an attack-trained dogs, but you seldom run
into those delivering papers. I only had to do it once in three years...
Believe me, having a german shepherd try to eat you really gets your blood
pumping...

I almost forgot the most important part: Try not to be attacked by more than
one at once. In that case, try to hurt the first one real bad real fast,
because if they both get their jaws on you, you are SOL.

>Sortry about that, but sometimes the Air Farce really bugs me..

I recall a proposal in the late 1960s suggesting that the USAF turn all
aircraft over to the Army and devote itself solely to being ready to launch

It was not popular in some circles.

In my (and Ditzie\'s) opinion, stealth is vastly over-rated in Traveller
combat. Basically, combat goes out to 2 light seconds or so, and cheap
civilian sensors can pick up ships at those ranges, and medium cost sensors
can provide targetting solutions.

Facing isnt an issue in Traveller combat. Ships dont have \'directional
shields\', and weapons tend to be either in turrets or in the nose.

Minor or surface damage is also not that important - well-built miliary
ships tend to have massivly redundant sensor arrays and redundant power
plant radiators. A ship\'s combat capability is essentially defined by it\'s
spinal mount, and you need to bite deep into the ship to hurt it.

Megajoulage limits on lasers are the main thing that kills fighters as
line-of-battle systems. To get enough energy into the target, you need
particle accelerators or meson guns, and both have range as a function of
length. By definition, length is something fighters dont have, so they are
limited to lasers.

Fighters also tend to have weak point defense systems - most dont mount
nuke dampers, and many cannot afford rapid-fire (circa 50 megajoules at a
shot per second) lasers.

lol. I don\'t have a system to propose.  I have no clue *how* the anti tamper
circuit would work aside from the description of *what* it does.   The
description should be satsified by whatever current scientific knowledge,
coupled with imagination, says is forseeable.

It\'s not possible for your \'reflected standing wave,\' for example, to be
better stabilized by TL15?  How about gravitic compensation/inertial
dampening?  It is stated and I have repeated that malfunctions are allowed in
the system.  They just draw the attention for probably investigation (in
peacetime) and probable destruction (especially in wartime, in a warzone).
Even w/ a no answer, who\'s to say there can be no invention or discovery, in
the intervening 3 and a half millenia, that *can* permit the description of
the disconnect/anti-tamper circuit to be valid?  How bout w/  nanotechnology?
Is it *possible*?  This is only for the "compensation" to your \'reflected
standing wave,\' and not for "improvement" (if you say that\'s impossible).
I\'m not an EE.  If you have experience in that, i respect that, so i\'m asking
you.  Will there be *no* other way to do what Survival Margin describes, as
regards the anti-tamper/ system disconnect?

What about pings that go very very fast w/ a miniature fibre-optic system?  Or
better yet, a miniature meson system of "pinging."  Nah... probably way below
the minimum size, but u get my drift.  Yeah, maybe you can duplicate the ping
itself, but how do you interrupt the flow w/o alerting the tamper circuit?
Even one missed or most miniscule error in the ping could well cause the
tamper circuit to fire...  Maybe you\'ll set it to 100 or whatever (depending
on the ROP-rate of Pinging<g>).   Hows bout any of those?  Set it around
neutrinos, positrons, whatever... lol.  There will be something that should be
uncrackable within the period from 1086 to 1130...  Eventually a flaw will be
found/exploited and the system will be upgraded. In fact, it was...  that
exploitation was Virus, but alas was uncontrollable.

No I don\'t.  I\'ll tell you a secret...  I don\'t really care, actually.  It\'s
quite in the license of science-fiction believability that a transponder chip
can tell the difference between an authenticated message and one forged.  You
make up the reason if you don\'t like the one in Survival Margin...

Ok.  So?  The chips are said to have a stable,reliable, and slow mutation.  A
cloned chip, even if its mutation didn\'t vary due to & during the cloning
process, in this somehow would still have all the features the Imperials
geneered the chips to have.

Ok.  So?  What does this mean?  An \'instant duplicate\' does exactly what the
original is  designed to.  Maybe someone w/ the duplicate will try to play
around w/ the design to be able to have "forgable" transponders (which are
supposed to return "false" squawks from your trusty SDG-313F).  To do it in a
way that works (doesn\'t return false and instead goes on its own) is supposed
to be a TL16-17 program by the certain name of Virus.  Note that Virus was
uncontrollable.  Whether this was due to Lucans impatience (and desperation
facing Dulinors final drive) or to a "controllable" Virus being TL18 or
higher, who knows?

And how do you know what the transponder chips will be able to percieve or
not?  They were geneered over the course of decades by imperial scientists
seeking to develop and isolate specific traits that would serve their purpose
(being unforgable transponders).  Is it impossible that a being that "lives in
electronics like a duck passes through water" (or however that goes) can
probably tell if it\'s hooked to a computer (and comm system) or not?  Or maybe
you\'d rather dispute the possiblity of such a being?

> there is no diference.  Remember the the signal GK chip had to be given new

The Deyo chips are not just ordinary Cymbeline chips. They\'re the product of
decades of geneering on said Cymbeline chips.

What signals?  You talking about the anti-tamper/system disconnect?  Or about
the transponder chatter?  Or both?

You can always forge a transponder chatter.  The Transponder probably
understands it fine too.  It still gives you a false squawk because it nows
what it should hear but isn\'t.

Yes. I dispute none of that.  All of that takes time (and vast amounts of
effort and time) and it\'s a tiered difficulty.  The only time that\'s needed is
from 1088 to however long the Imperium would have lasted w/o being wasted.
Say a hundred years before a new and updated TL16-17 IFF system is adopted.
And the process repeats.  First is discovering what\'s inside the black box to
begin with.  Not that hard for someone w/ power and influence and the
motivation for it.  Then have to acquire a SDG-313F chip.  Any chip from
Cymbeline won\'t do it.  Maybe you get someone in the Research Station Omicron
to get you the mutation rate, etc.   For the sake of argument, say the black
box can be can be disconnected from the ship w/o melting the transponder
chips.  It still can\'t be opened (unless you think the \'integrity monitor\' of
the black box is a flawed concept, too).  You plug it in another ship, it
still says its the original ship.  Somehow you\'ve finally acquired an SDG-313F
chip outside of its black box (or even managed to get in the black box).  Now
what?  You go about wanting to make a forgable version...  

By altering it, Survival Margin says the imperial chips will be able to tell
the difference.  
The only analogy i can think of is trying to simulate a conversation between a
cro-magnon and another human.  They can try to fake the funk but i\'m sure both
can probably tell something is very odd bout the other (even if both are
perfectly instructed in good ol Oxford English or \'grogspeak\').  Or trying to
get your mac to talk to you pc.  Yeah, there\'s emulators, but there\'s a
difference in "feel."  Enough to return a false squawk anyways.

No, that\'s not what I said.  I said Hans didn\'t like them to begin with and he
doesn\'t.  So any "evidence" he finds that points to any incongruities merely
reinforces his preconceived opinions IMO.   I think that the storyline (of the
life, death, and aftermath of the Third Imperium) should be justified and
reconciled where there are incongruities.  Me and Hans have discussed matters
in this province before.  He doesn\'t like TNE and i\'m not losing sleep about
it.  Traveller is Traveller is Traveller. : )

I just say they\'re no more improbable than starship laser weapons w/ useful
range (much less jump drives, Aslan, Droyne, and meson weapons/screens).

You\'ve removed my meaning from the context it was presented in.  What I
admitted was that The Traveller Adventure is just as easily moved to 1086 IMTU
as it is in the 1100 era, and that the transponders of TTA are the pre-Deyo
transponders (adopted in 1088 w/ a 12 year retrofit period).  Hmm... 12 years
makes 1100... what\'s the date of TTA?  I\'m assuming 1105 or so.  Being in the
Spinward Marches (I presume) and thus a backwater, maybe one can justify TTAs
transponders being the old style even in 1105. Ya think?  ; )

I got this in a latter post, making a seperate topic for it (Transponder\'s
true nature is becoming too big an umbrella).  All the transponder records is
registry information, man! lol.  I don\'t believe in the Black UN helicopters
(regardless of whether they believe in me <g>).

That\'s not what I said.  The \'chatterbox function\' only ensures that an
authentic transponder is there.   The chips can tell by chatting w/ each other
whether they\'re authentic or not.  The information is all passed back and
forth, but that information (which is called up to the consol by a "squawk")
is limited to registry info (home port, captain, ship name, etc etc).  I dont\'

<snip>

Shudder!  Ya\'ll are bringing back bad memories.  I\'ve *had* this
experience.

I wouldn\'t recommend this as a course of action, but...

...when I was 16 I waded into a dog fight between a doberman that
had broken his chain and the family mutt trying to protect his
home...dumb, but that mutt was *my* dog and he\'d have done the same
for me, well maybe not, but I would for him.

I reckon you shove your arm down the dog\'s throat to stop them from
letting go, folks, because if you hurt the SOB it *will* let go and
try for something more vital.  He let go of my left arm when I
whacked him up side the head and went for my neck, luckily he missed
and that\'s when I got mad.

Honestly, it was him or me at that point, my mutt had run under the
car and was cheering from the sidelines.  ;-> I fully intended to
kill that dog bare handed.  I put my hands in his mouth all right,
several punches right to the snout...try to bite ME would he!!  I
was totally berserk at that point.  The only thing that saved the two
of us was the dog coming to its senses.  I really do remember seeing
something like shock in that dog\'s eyes, like it suddenly realized
it shouldn\'t be here doing this, and with tail tucked it ran home
with me chasing it right to the edge of our property.  Man, I was
the hairless ape, gibbering and throwing rocks, sticks, a lawn
chair..if I\'d been wearing shoes I\'d have chunked them too!

When it was over, I got 16 stitches and a bloody lip out of it, the
dog got a broken tooth and a cut on his nose.  But I defended my
territory and he stayed away from it, and my mutt after that.

It was good that it was a doberman and not a heavier dog, like the
big pit bull we\'ve got next door now.  I might not have faired so
well. ;->

Now on a more *reasonable* mode...individual dogs don\'t usually
attack for no (dog) reason.  Mostly they\'re protecting their
territory from a threat, and if they get excited they get a little
fuzzy about what their territory is.  I guess I\'m just too stubborn
to give them *my* territory.  

Loren\'s right...never run.  Dog instinct is to chase things that
run.  Face them with your hands at your sides, and talk to them
quietly, they\'ll usually calm down a little if you don\'t approach
them and you can begin to move away.  If they follow and bark/growl,
stop and repeat the process.  You can\'t let them spook you into
running, and NEVER let them get around to your back.  That\'s one
reason packs are bad.

>I almost forgot the most important part: Try not to be attacked by

>bad real fast, because if they both get their jaws on you, you are
>SOL.

Packs are bad, real bad.  One dog is a dog, two or more dogs with
out a human controlling them is a pack.  Dogs in an uncontrolled
pack are NOT "man\'s best friend" they are one of our deadliest
enemies.  Unlike most predators dog packs aren\'t afraid of us.  I
*don\'t* like packs!  Use a rifle on an uncontrolled pack.

Ob Trav:  One Vargr is fine, but don\'t let \'em congregate!  They are
dangerous in packs. ;->


Eris,
    I have the scars, but I\'m still too dumb to be afraid of dogs.

I would that is the way to go. BTW, there are as many gearheads on the

That\'s what I would say, But 1120 is better year due to the speed information.

If a pit bull got a hold of my arm or leg, I think there would be no
no choice but to gouge its eyes, unless I had something sharp that
I could reach its brain with through the ear or the eye.

As I understand it, when they lock that jaw, it stays locked.

Bloo

P.S.  The friendliest, happiest, gentlest dog I ever encountered was
a doberman who had not had its ears and tail clipped.  Surely, there
is no intelligent reason to maim these dogs.

Ob. Trav., do humans and other races treat the two main species of
Vargr any differently?  And do they treat different species of human
differently?  (I could see the average Vargr respecting the \'wolfling\'
nature of the Solomani, to steal a term from Brin, than the traditionnal
Vilani.)

I never used drop tanks in any of my CT designs so didn\'t really get into them
too much. But, for the Gazelle to make J5 it assumes that all J fuel gets used
up inserting the ship into J-space. Is this the canon view? My personal take on
the J fuel thing is that the J drive uses the fuel whilst in J-space, so by
dropping the tanks you\'ve just lost yourself 100 tons of fuel and have to run
the rest of the jump on internal tanks.
I see drop tanks as being used to extend range by making 2 jumps.

How much of the material in this book will be GURPS specific? Is it worth

The Ti is externally equivilant to the secret Jump 6 type TJ.  Jump 6
means TL15 (GTL 12).  If the types were of different TL\'s they would not
appear identical as on would have a different type of hull, therefore
the TI _must_ be Gurps TL 12.  This will require redesign of the ship.

I assume you mean DR: 235

> Jump: 3

> 60 Jump   Mass:240  Spaces:60

Jump requires n+1 % of the hull in spaces (tons) so a 2000 space hull
should have _80_ Jump, not 60.

Otherwise this looks good. The TI is supposed to be better of if water
or cradle landed not landed on the ground. It might be possible (using
GURPS) Vehicles to design your version so it also has this problem (as
would many larger ships).  IIRC GUrps Vehicles 1 had ground pressure but
I don\'t recall if Vehicles 2nd ed does.

Sight unseen, I tend to agree with this. I simply do not see how you can
successfully use a point build character system to represent the character
generation system that has been basically used in all editions of traveller from
day one. And, while there were flaws in that system, it was always the heart and
soul of the thing as far as I\'m concerned.

HOWEVER ...

While I agree that Rebellion is *definitely* salvageable, I disagree *violently*
about the MTrav game system. It sucked, frankly, major-league sucking, in fact.

The best system was that used in TNE, where, of course, the background and
unwarranted changes to the "canon" of Traveller were completely unwarranted.

Next best was T4, followed by CTrav.

And this is where the problem is ... I don\'t think you could get ten people from
this list to all agree on the same version of the Traveller game system as being
the best. I don\'t think there would even be a clear majority.\\

Sure, I don\'t think that GURPS as a character system works with Traveller, but
there seems no reason to me why the template system that is supposedly included
would not work, or why some sort of "package" system a la Hero Games would not
be a suitable way of getting around the silly minimaxing that GURPS inevitably
seems to end up with.

Or, you can do what most people on the list will do, use your own home brew
rules.

Personally, when I get the time, I will be writing a "proper" SF version of
Armageddon and use it for my Traveller campaign.

>the MT sytem came closest to doing what every system since CT
>promised...making everything work w/ one simple system.  Like I said...the

Again, this will only attract disagreement, most of it violent!

GURPS is at least better in that it has fewer partisans violently against it on
this list (or seems to ... I\'m sure they\'ll delurk on that statement!) than any
of the other systems.

Thats why we\'ll never see a return to TNE or MTrav ... T4 may mutate into T5,
but TNE and MTRav systems are dead and gone whether you like them or not.

You might want to consider switching to Gurps, if you can find a copy in

That just makes it look *more* like a cheap special effect!

As I said, that\'d require unlikely targeting skills. The "preferred"
method is to cram your arm in "sideways". That way, it\'s your forearm
in the mouth, and they\'d have to be able to shear the bones to bite
through. 

A little gizmo I\'ve got to track down the pland for is quite effective.
It uses focused ultrasound and *feels* like you got hit in the head
with a baseball bat (or a fair sized rock). I can state this for
certain as I inadvertently simulated one when a friend was working on
an alarm system.

I\'m one of the folks who can hear well into the "ultrasound" range. I
thought I could hear the ultrasonic transducers from the system, so I
picked one up to bring it closer to my ear to make sure. 

*Big* mistake. The resulting doppler shift brought it into the range
the "stun" gizmo uses. I thiought my head had exploded. It felt a lot
like the time my kid brother bounced a fist sized rock off my head.

They aren\'t working on it for use against humans since it causes
cerebral hemoragging in some subjects. But against a dog that\'s
attacking you, who cares?

A friend\'s brother went to CalTech.

He tells of the guy who posted a list of all the things he\'d done to
protect his room. Everyone looked it over and they couldn\'t figure out
a way to get past the stuff. Then it occurred to someone... 

"I don\'t see how *he* can get back in!"

Yep. He\'d assumed they\'d figure a way in. So they just sat back and
watched. It took him three days to get back into his room.

Another guy had his room left alone. They just removed the molding from
around the door. Then they removed the doorknob and built up the
surface of the door until it was even with the wall. A little spackle,
a little paint, and there was just blank wall where the door had been. :-)

The one I heard from a friend had his unit pinned down by a bunch of
NVA. They were on one side of a vally, the NVA were on the other. 

Apparently it was a busy day as there was a bit of trouble finding
support. Finally they got patched to somebody. They gave the map
co-ordinates, and got told "On the way".

They waited. And suddenly the ridge with the NVA disappeared. They\'d
been patched thru to the New Jersey...

There WAS a Zhodhani spy who did just that.  He was at the research 
station.  Unfortunately, when he scanned them, the chips responded and 
caught his viral infection when he sneezed....  And the rest is history.  
The Imperials thought they had a breakthrough, and the Zho just quietly 
disappeared...

And then Strephon woke up...

I strongly recommend that in the event that you are attacked by a Bull
Terrier that you don\'t mess this up, because if you do the dog will very
likely shear a large chunk of your hand right off, without being
significantly slowed down. Personally I think that employing a gun or
baseball bat before they get that close is the way to go.

=====================================

And everyone remember, if you dont have a weapon handy, feed him one 
arm, and use the other hand to gouge his eyes, believe me, he\'ll let go.

Packs are bad, real bad.  One dog is a dog, two or more dogs with
out a human controlling them is a pack.  Dogs in an uncontrolled
pack are NOT "man\'s best friend" they are one of our deadliest
enemies.  Unlike most predators dog packs aren\'t afraid of us.  I
*don\'t* like packs!  Use a rifle on an uncontrolled pack.

======================

Your dead right on that, got attacked by two mongrels when I was 18, I 
was out in the woods, and I guess I wandered into their territory.  
Anyway, when I saw one start to move behind me, I took my walking staff 
and went right at the other one, one good swing to the head and he was 
out.  The other backed off when I turned to face him.  Good thing there 
weren\'t three or more, I would not have been so lucky.

ROFL!!

I\'ve heard that a marine unit in the Gulf had come upon a bunker.  It 
commanded the whole area around it, so they tried to get an air strike 
on it, but no one was available at the time.  Not wanting to sit and 
wait for one, the CO kept at it, till he got the battleship out in the 
Gulf (the Missouri??  I forget which one)  He gave them the coords, and 
was told the package was on its way.  They soon heard that ripping 
sheets sound of heavy arty, and the bunker and its little hill 
disappeared, and he thanked the ship.  The person he was talking to said 
\'Hey, got any other targets?  I got 8 rounds still loaded!!\'

This is by far the best system for module construction in GT yet.  I have
been running myself ragged calculating and recalculating and even making a
spreadsheet to make new modules for GT.  Mr. Jackson has cut out the
middleman and passed the savings on to you!

Oh MAN!  This is great!  I too have been working on a fusion gun.  It

These are by far the best modules.  These simplify the making of weapons
of all sizes.  From turrets to Bays to Spinals.  One question, any chances
of a Laser-X weapon?  I\'ve been working on the "powered" version of a
50ton X-Laser bay an I can tell you that these weapons are brutal.  Long
range and high dammage.  Maybe these weapons were ommitted from the GT
book for a reason?  FNORD!

This is going to make my job alot easier, as you know I am working on
10ton "pod" weapons for small ships IMTU.
Be interesting to see how (or if) our summs match up.

Sorry, I generally follow previous list conclusions that you don\'t really
want to use much more than shotguns inside ship if you ever want to fly it
again.

Let me also state my general assumptions about boarding.
The boarders generally want to ship, crew, passengers and cargo intact. It
is clear the target ship has been disabled, but not surrendered. Or the
surrender terms offered were not acceptable. An intact ship can be flown
under its own power and disposed of much easier. Intact cargo is worth
money. Intact crew and passengers are worth ransom (or money being sold
into slavery).
The ship being borded is not necessarily as terribly desparate as people
have painted. They do not need to win their own ship and the other ship,
rather they just need to put up enough of a defense to get better terms of
surrender. For example they may offer to jettison the cargo and be left in
their own ship.


I like the bit about pikes. That is certainly something to consider. I had
thought of a device that uses a HE round on the tip of a short staff or
spear. A bit like the thing you use to give a coup de gras to a cow before
slaughter. In a close quarter\'s fight something like this would allow you
the use of a HE device with sufficient accuracy that you don\'t have to
worry about damage to the ship.

Sorry, out of time, more comments to follow...

Gary, it is impossible to prove a negative. The only way the foreign
governments could be sure that the Imperials didn\'t have a back door would
be if they had the complete specifications. And even then they couldn\'t be
sure that the Imperials didn\'t have a different one tucked away that did
have a back door. And how would they know which type was in any given
transponder? That would require that they had unlimited access to inspect
them.

And even if the Imperial could prove all of this, human nature is such that
the professional paranoiacs of those foreign governments would be quite sure
that the Imperials had pulled a fast one. At the very least I can\'t see any
of them being willing to run the risk.

Finally, you ignored the point that the foreign governments would not be
thriiled to have the TRUTH of their ship movements freely available to the
Imperials.

OK. It\'s obviously useless to try to convince you that the Deyo transponders
can be forged. Apparently you don\'t mind that this specifically is contrary
to various previously published material and by inference invalidates quite
a few other CT and MT adventures (those where such a transponder would make
the action either impossible or suicidal). So let me ask you one simple
question: Is this the sort of game environment you want to run your
Traveller adventures in? A world where the movements of every ship is
plotted with complete presision and with no way to avoid it?

It\'s propably wasted effort, but I\'ll try once more. The big point of these
unforgable transponders is that if the approaching ship tells you that it is
the merchant ship "Completely Harmless" then you know that it is indeed the
"Completely Harmless". But if the pirate ship "Predator" has had an extra
transponder installed and that transponder has been told that it has been
installed in the "Completely Harmless", then it will say so. Later you can
get rid of the fake transponder and return to being the innocent starmerc
"Predator".

Does anyone else besides Gary have trouble understanding why the Imperial

misinformation?

Not like it? I love it. The more information I have about my campaign

That seems to be the difference between us. You see _any_ development,

improvements.

In the interest of moving this discussion along I\'ll refrain from the

Every time a merchant ship encounters an IN ship it will be able to provide
the warship with complete information about the movements of all ships that
has used its transponder near a merchant ship with which it has been in
contact. Not as a result of a special effort on the part of the IN, but as
a nice little bonus. Granted that the IN can get most of this information
on its own, it still cost a lot less and is far more comprehensive that
anything the IN could set up for itself.

I don\'t think human nature has changed much over the years. And would you
like to set your adventures in a universe where the intelligence apparatus
is that effective?

As an interllectual exercise I\'m quite prepared to assume that tamperproof
transponders could be made (I don\'t think the one described in _Survival
Margin_ is one such, but that\'s by the way). THe real questions are: Do you
think the Traveller universe as described in the rest of the material we
have  --  everything EXCEPT _Survival Margin_, more or less  --  really do
describe a universe where transponders are tamperproof and provide perfect
(after the fact) information about all ship movement? And would you like to
run your adventures in such a universe?

I thought that was precisely what _Survival Margin_ claimed they did.

Peter,

My thoughts on this came from the \'advice\' in the GURPS book "Civilian ships
are usually TL 10\'" and from the Trav. Adventure that the Imperiallines
ships are usually left to look rather run down. I so I planned on using the
TL 10 hull for the TJ but upgrade the drives, weapons etc. to TL12 and play
with the hull armor and number of J and M drive modules accordingly to
balance the calculations. This would give the outward appearance of an older
ship but the performance of a newer ship (assuming that all changes would be
done internally).

CT rules state that you burn up all your jump fuel *before* the jump.  Thus, 
if your unladen Jump number is J5, and your onboard fuel lets you do a J2, you 
need 60% of your jump fuel from drop tanks.  So yeah, it\'s canon.

I can see a case for a \'rapid deployment strike force\', designed for J2 
internally & J4 or better with drop tanks.  Under normal conditions, it does 
the J2\'s, but if it has to go far, fast, strap on the tanks and fly.  This 
would work really good in low tech areas like Reavers\' Deep...

> I see drop tanks as being used to extend range by making 2 jumps.
> Comments?

Most designs I\'ve seen & done under High Guard do it that way too; the ship 
carries the normal amount of jump & power plant fuel, and if it has to jump 
into empty space to extend its range, strap on the drop tanks so it has full 
tanks when it jumps into that empty hex and can get back out again.

  I particularly like the one where they put a false wall over the entrance to
  a new dean\'s office, and he couldn\'t find it.

Actually, they carefully constucted a bulletin board to precisely fit
inside the doorway.  That way, there was no permanent damage (one of
the things in the unwritten agreement between hackers and MIT: hackers
do no permanent damage, and the administration leaves their hacks
around a while).

And it wasn\'t a dean\'s office.  It was President Vest, the first day
of his job.

have much to learn about vehicles and how it relates to GT.

I used fractional vaules in Mr. Jackson\'s PAW and Meson modules to come up
with somthing that alows both the power plant and the weapon to be pl[aced
in a 10 ton module, it is a \'pod\' after all and origionaly designed to be
independant.

for the 10 ton PAW  used a PAW Turret-2.75
The weapon came out like this:
7.5spaces(dt)  6d x 825dammage  6875mi 1/2d Range Power Req=90Mw  90tons
4.05Mcr
90Mw is 2.25spaces worth of power plant:
9tons 0.45Mcr

So total the thing is 9.75spaces(round to 10) 99tons and cost 4.45Mcr

Lets look at my original version:
10spaces  100tons  4Mcr
6dx 800  1/2d=10,000(yes I rounded)
3650Mj Beam power

Very close, although I dont know why I needed more power in my
calculation, must be an option I failed to use (shrug).

I see that the TL-12 Meson is about the same as the TL-12 PAW.  Even the
price is the same!  This was a concern I had and even posted on the GURPS
message board about it, but Mr. Jackson put up an interesting point.

TL-12 Mesons are designed as TL-10 PAWs.

When I designed my Meson I designed it as a TL-12 PAW, and got the same
results.  Using TL-10 we discover that there is a difference in
performance.  Dammage is slightly less than the PAW, but the Meson
ballances due to its armour penetration. So both weapons being the same
price is not realy a problem.

It looks like I will be updating my X-TEK webpages very soon.

If, as I suspect, Loren edits these two supplements (BTC and Aliens 1) as well
as he wrote and edited G:T they will be wonderful sources of Traveller
information. The specific stats will be in GURPS format, but the vast amount
of background information and other data will be useable in any system. And
these will _finally_ replace parts of those utterly unavailable DGP Rats and
Cats, and Cogs and Dogs, though in different order, since A1 is going to cover
the Zho\'s and Vargr.


As a general statement here to all: GURPS is the generalized _mechanic_ of the
game, the way the ROLL-playing is handled. The ROLE-playing information is
useable in ANY system.

If you feel, as some do, that with Traveller, the ROLL-playing and
ROLE-playing are inseparable, then G:T is not for you. If you feel that the
vast textual universe of the Third Imperium is independent of any particular
game mechanic, and is what makes \'Traveller\', as I do, then anything and
everything associated with any version of Traveller is useful.

No luck with my friend trying to pick up GURPS: Traveller in the Mall of
America.  But now a colleague\'s flying out to the following places next
week and has amazingly offered of her own accord to have a look for me:

Miami
Fort Lauderdale
New Orleans


If anyone can recommend a game store it might be worth her trying, that
would be great.


Many thanks.

I was innocently mowing the lawn at my appartment complex one day when this
girl (apparently just off the school bus) came through my gate and was
asking me to call the cops.  I tried to tell her that I didn\'t have a phone
but she could go next door to call or go down one block to the sherrif\'s
station.  Then this pack of girls showed up looking for her.  I told them I
didn\'t want any trouble but then they came into the gate anyway trying the
get the girl.  I didn\'t care squat for her, but she was hiding behind me
and THEY entered MY territory.  They took a few pot shots at the girl and I
had to raise my voice.  Eventually, they left and the neighbors called the
sherrif and the girl refused to press charges (she was a minor).  All I
could think of during that scene was that I\'d have to kill the loud mouthed
bitch just to scare off the other four.  I knew I couldn\'t handle all of
them at once, but they were punks and I didn\'t think they had the nerve for
a REAL fight.  Fortunately that didn\'t become necessary.

Hey Bloo;

I have that problem too... I\'m right eye dominant, and left handed. I learned
to shoot a revolver left handed, and once I figured out to use my right eye,
my scores dramatically improved. It is possible to shoot with your opposite
eye. You just turn your head a bit so the other eye aligns on the sight plane.
Granted it is easier with a pistol than a shoulder arm, but it CAN be done. If
you have trouble ask the guy (my apologies; I forgot his name) on the list who
is an NRA instructor. You can also go to the Smith and Wesson training Academy
since you live in Boston, and they are in Springfield.

And, contrary to reports in the right-wing press, the teachers were trying
to make the kids shut up and be polite, not encouraging it.  \'course,
Harris knows the kids can\'t vote...

Mandela look confused. No one explained to him that his visit was
sponsored by the teachers federations that Harris has been trying to
dismantle, or that these kids were tested on material they hadn\'t studied
(because the government gave the tests, THEN released the curriculum, and
finally commissioned the textbooks to be written), or that a solution to
"not enough money" is "sell a school" (even if it will be needed in a few
years as the population of its area changes), or...

(Mike Harris is currently Premier of Ontario, although his policies seem
to be set by an advisor named Guy Giorno. Seems intent on ripping the
social fabric apart. Not bad if you\'re an already-educated healthy
employed white middle-class male in the private sector - otherwise you\'re
a problem to be solved. Scary times to live through. Gives me a new
appreciation for Dulinor\'s subjects, I tell ya.)

ObTrav: What the hell, time for a Rebellion. Where can I hire some Vargr
corsairs and Aslan mercenaries? :-)



      Might I suggest an Aslan Duel assasin?  They are very efficient, and
      will take payment in land.

 I see drop tanks as being used to extend range by making 2 jumps.
 Comments? >>

I always thought that the justification for drop tanks were that the fuel was
burned (or pumped aboard to replace burned internal fuel) BEFORE the jump, so
that the tanks were jettisoned dry. This is also a heavily argued thread on
the list.

I tend to design my HG rider\' tenders with externally mounted detachable tanks
to carry all their jump fuel. They stay with the vessel until removed at a
starport. They can swap them for \'riders that convienently mass the same as a
tank, if they don\'t intend a maximum jump. The down side to ET\'s are that they
unstreamline a ship, and they are very vunerable to damage as they are outside
the armor.

IMTU, there is a J1 main passing right through the middle of the 
Confederation, and most of the bulk commerce is carried on automated 
ships, using drop tanks to maximize their internal cargo capacity.

Also, the base had better have spare riders there.  If you keep the external 
tanks mounted, how else are they gonna get there?

I gave up being imbarassed about my typing and spelling when I stared
posting to the net.  I am an EE not a typest or a PHD in english.  Most of
my misstakes are my brain out running my typing ability.  As long as your
readers know what you ment you are communicating your thought and ideas and
that is what this is about.  The free exchange of ideas for fun and
diabolical gaming.  (Grin)

If it were not fun I would not be here.  I have to admit that in the week
sence I joined this list I have greatly enjoyed the exchange of ideas with
the other people on this list.  There are a lot of well read and well spoken
people on this list.

I dought that code would be secret for long.  Also the ship\'s crew should
have access to the data for error checking purposes and verification of the
nature of ships they meet.  The BB is intended as a recognition system.
Even if the crew does not have direct access all they have to do is tell
thier computer to lof all output of the black box.  A simple colation
program could then extract all the relavent and not relavent data.  Remeber
the boxes are always chatting away.  A log of thos conversations would
contain all the data they exchanged and sence it passed through the com
system it can all be loged with a simple diagostic tool even if no other
facility is provided for this function.  This is doable with gear available
today.  The equipment would be part of any EEs tool kit and part of any
ships repair kit as well.  If it were not (for some strange reason) then it
would be a trivial task to aquire and install at any class A or B port.  Who
in their right mind would risk space travel without the basic tools to make
the most basic repairs to the critical parts of their vessel?

All to true.  I am the one in the company I work for that has to fix what
these higher evolved (or is that lower?) break.  You\'d be amazed at what
some people will do with electronic equipment.  A few years ago I had to fix
equipment (belonging to a customer not ours) destroyed by water because a
plant manager thought it was dirty and ordered it cleaned.  The plant floor
workers cleaned it the way they clean everything else.  They hosed it
down...while it was running!  480 volts of three phase AC!  
Can you say, \'BOOM!!!\'

Very reasonable and well reasoned...so far but what is the limits of data
stored and transmited in your estimation?  Is it just the Vehicle
Identification Number in the way of todays air craft transponders or is it
more.  In my campains so far I treat the BB as simple squak boxes and let
the ships purchase data bases to identify the ship by its\' VIN.  The BBs do
not store any contact or other data.  Only the VIN.  They are \'reasonablly
foolproof\' sealed with the VIN multiply redundantly stored and encoded.
Absolute verification comes from the database purchased from the Empires MM
and the equivalent of \'Janes Spaceships\'.  If the squak does not match the
ships sensor \'fingure print\' in the data base then you got reason to
investigate.  It is a fairly safe and effective cross checked system as the
data base is maitained and updated by the Empires Department of Ships
Registry.  Updates are available for a small fee at all class A & B
starports and can be considered part of the maitainence cost if you do not
want to have your PC have to deal with the detains.  All \'inspection\' ships
are in the minimum registry by law and no ship is required to heave to for
any ship not in the minimum registry.  

That is how I do it in my campians.  By separating the squak box from an
official registry list it make foergery difficult.  You could forge a sout
courier VIN (with considerable cost) but if it was not in a scout courier
hull with the same basic power systems then any ship in sensor range would
notice unless you payed the MCs for a mimicing stealth system.  This system
makes it hard to be dishonest but not imposible and it lets those that need
their secrets like the navy keep them.  Also all squak boxes have a mute
switch to prevent them from being use to guide in missles.

Thank you.  I forgot to add this obvious fact to my own post.  It also
occures to me that traveller with only a few exception necessary for FTL
that are not specificly explained stick to the laws of physic as we now
understand them.  With this proviso I can not think of any way to produce am
unbreakable system.  

At the extreme a crew could vent the compartment that contains the BB to
deep space and wait for the BB to reach the single digits kelvan tempertures
of deep space.  They could then cut the box open and remove the \'distruct
circuit\' as no such cuicuit could fire at those tempertures as there is to
little molecurler movement for any activety much less a detonation.  This
process is sometimes used to deal with bombs today but at much highter temps
like 100 kelvan.  Freeze them with liquid nitrogen and then haul them to a
safe place to go boom or defuse them.  Once the \'tamper circuit\' was
deactivated you repressurise and warm the BB so it starts working again and
you have an open studyable BB for analises.  HEH!  HEH!  HEH!  In effect you
put the BB in a electronic lifeform low berth.

Note that at these tempertures not even electrons flow with any speed.  And
all but a few gases like Hydrogen and heleum solidify.  With near zero
molecule movement even atomic reactions slow to a near stop.  Real good
heated space suits will be needed to perform the work but those are already
standard equipment on space ships anyway.

Yes there is.  The system that makes the defence can always breal the
defence.  Defence has always laged behind for this reason.  Can you name a
time in history the defense was supperior enough to make a man invuneable
against that times weapons?

Just a few slight problems here.  

1) Reburning the chips substrate take a fair amount of power an a connect
capable of carring that power.  Line of sight laser would work but thats
about all execept direct electrical connection (not optical that is not line
of sight with the chips substrate)

2) The above process damages the chips permanately reducing it\'s capacity
considerably.

3) Refoundering the chips is more efficient but that would require an
enviroment similar to that on the planet the these chips come from or that
of a chip fab.  These does not occure in a working computer.

4)  The only real posibility of the virus working is if the computers are
nueral net systems (like the chip are themselves).  Then the virus would
pass as a seed in the form of a program then impress the basic pattern of
the virus chip into the nueral net.  This would get the effect discribed in
TNE.  This would make all non neural nets system somewhat resistant to the
virus as they could be flushed and reloaded from read only media to
completely remove the virus.  From what I gather this was the fix used in
TNE to allow computers to once again be useful.  I have very little access
to TNE material.

How does this match with TNE canon?

Which dog are you talking about?  The dog that fights in pits is a terrior
bread much smaller than a dob.  The \'pit bull\' in this area is in the mastif
family along with the mastif and the bull bastif, a cross between the bull
dog and the mastif.

The mastif bulls run 80-200+ lbs.  The pit fighting dog tops out around 60
to 80 lbs.  None of these are the engish bulldog or the boston terrior
though the bosten is distantly related to the pit fighting dog.  Here in the
south two very different dogs are mistakenly call pit bulls.  The mastiff
version is very good tempered that terrior is not.

PS none of these dogs lock their jaws.  They tend to hold on to their bite
untill they pull you off your feet and the can get to your throat.  Then
they let go and go for the throat.  The throat attack is what they are known
for.  The other is just the first step and if they don\'t like their grip
they will let got to get a better one.  Be warn though the mastiff breeds
have some of the most powerfull jaw muscles of the dogs.  The can break mens
arms.  The also very strong in their sholders and can pull even large men to
the ground.

I have owned several of these dogs (mastiffs only, not the teriors) and not
yet have I had a mean one.  One thing though they are very protective of
their people especially children.  You might get a very nasty surprise if
you were to spank your child in front of one of these dogs that likes your
child.  In many cases the dog will chose to protect the child over the
adult.  At least that is the popular wisdom with these dogs.  I\'ve only seen
this happen once myself and the dog only warned.  It did not bite.  She was
a very good dog though and maybe an exception.  (I saw the child at the time.)

No not \'nuff said\'.  Navy fall down go boom without logistic.  And what
about all those PEOPLE in the Navy who don\'t want big brother looking over
their shoulder.  The Empire could never stand against the MM in a show down.
This is true today.  The US army is no match for the US people.  The Empire
Navy would be atmost .1% the size the the MM.  No larger Navy could be
supported by the economy.  See pocket empires.

No basic token ring network theory.  The data past would have to be loged to
maintain the intergraty of the system.  If loged it can be extracted.  If
extracted you have your bigbrotherism.  You can not have the cake and eat it
too.  If the system works it has to work in a curtain way.  Form always
matches function.  Just because you do not like it does not make it true.
My life would be a lot easier if it were not true.

To make the BBs as difficult to break as you say they are them cross
indexing is necessary or you in up with a data stream that is to short and
to easy to forge.  Those chips have to have something substansive to chatter
about or their chatter will be useless for the purpose of validation.  So
what do they talk about if not their own rather limited experience.  Their
ownly experience is talking with others of their kind and that is who, what,
when, and where data on every ship they have met.

Unacceptable.  If you do not know how they work in general you can not let
the interact with your players.  You can not know what will and will not
work when they try it.  What level of forgery and electronics does it take
to forge the BB?  What is the difficulty rating?  What is the task time?
These MUST be known and do not say \'it can not be done\'.  Everything can be
done that does not inherently break the laws of the universe and even those
thing can be done by work arround or if need be leaving the universe as in
\'jump drive\'.  Sayinf to your player \'you can\'t do that\' is wrong.  Saying
that the attemp failed is ok but you must know how it could be done or you
are not playing fair with your player and are cheating them.  It is the job
and the duty of the GM to make the rule consistant and play by them.

In a short answer NO!  What ever enablong technology could or would be
developed could and would allow the system it made posible to be beaten.
The hammer that drives the nail can pull the nail also.  That is the point!
The tech. that makes a system posible can override that system.  It has to
be able to do so or it could not build it.  That the chips were bread is not
relavent.  ANY siganl can be falsified with enough examples.  The EM
spectrum is limited in the type of data it can past.  The power of computer
expands by and order of magnitude every 18 months or so.  In 18 month the
\'new\' transponders will face computers that are enough faster than they are
to decode there signal and falsify it.  The \'magic\' of technology can defeat
itself and does so all the time.

And as ever flaw is plug a new one is found or created and exploited.  The
best encoder that the satalite industry could field was defeated in less
than 3 months and a product hack was on the black market one month later.
As for tighter tolerences...you reach a point where the limits of the real
world step in and shut you down HARD.  If you build in to many \'security\'
systems the system will falses fire to often and destroy itself due to the
variancies that naturally occure in the real world.  It is something I have
to design arround on a dayly basis.  Sorry there is no technological \'magic
bullets\'.  No panacias.  No perfect unbeatable systems.  They do not and can
not be made.

It work because I say so is not exceptable in an interactive game.  You must
allow the player their own free will.  If you \'make up a reason\' then I can,
using basic logic deduce, a work arround.  Your defining it sets in in stone
and I chissle that stone into what I want it to be.  I would take a
electronic-4 crypto-4 navy vet and take your system appart.  I would demand
band width useage and signal perrameters which I could monitor with the
ships test gear.  I would design a fuzzy logic program to listen and learn
and run it with a comparater to test it\'s output agains my onboard BB.  I
would then expose my ship and it\'s black box to a busy enviroment like a
sector capital port and let the system do the rest.  The fuzzy logic system
would mutate and adapt untill it sinced up.  I would then decompile the
logic and rerun the process with a different BB on a different ship and
decompile it feed this date into another layer of fuzzy logic to calculate
the critical path data to replace to create a frogery.  This WILL beat any
system in time.  With comutational power doubling every 18 months and all
new transponders having to be backward compatable (a must for logistics
reasons) it would not take long (20 months tops) to fine the key to forging
the signal.

Not true the TL that built something has by fiat the power to overcome it.
A highter TL would not be required and could not be required by the fact
that the original system was designed at that TL.  Products always lag
behind theory.  The theory of a better system exists a year or more before
the first working copy and two or more years before the first production
units.  By the time the BB reached the fronteers of the empire the
scientists there would have already come up with a counter.  It\'s about a 2
to 5 year trip depending on what canon you sight.

57th century copy protect will be defeated by 57th century hack just like
today.  Also most companies have learned that copy protect ticks off the

work hurdreds of hours for free just to be the one that breaks it first.
The now depend on licenced support and upgrades to insure their market share.

Because the EM spetrum is finite and moniterable!  Their every action and
perception is detectable and duplicatable.  If it can tell you can tell how
it tell and duplicate the input it sees and wants even down to the
variations causes by imperfections in materials and enviroment.  It\'s done
today as part of system testing.  It\'s call emulation.

You falsify everything, that\'s the point.  A message that is out of

be seen as corrent and legitimate.

You are again saying it\'s unforagable BECAUSE it\'s unforgable.  Circlular
logic.  I refuse to allow you your premiss that a perfect system can be
built.  You mush provide me with the proof of your premiss.  How can a copy
of a signal that is a duplicate of the signal that should be sent be told
from the \'real\' signal.  I have already shown how the signal could be forged
within tolerence.  You must now show how your system can tell the
difference.  How can two effectively identical signal be distinguish apart?

Then we throw out the TA.  Your system still is not posible based on the
hard data in Signal GK.  Signal GK also makes the Virus an imposibility
bases on the discription of the lifeforms reproductive processes.  They
could not occure inside a working computer and a simple system flush and

I would agree with the last statement - while everyone might _base_ their
rules on one of the standards, I would guess (and it is a guess) that most
of us add our own quirks.

For the record, I\'m a CT man myself, but I use from all sources.

Sure...multiply cost/weight/power use of any weapon by X^2 and multiply damage
and range by X.  I didn\'t do this because I chose to assume that lasers have a
maximum energy (much like T4) to avoid the phenomenon of the spinal laser
mount.

How many of these supplements will there be? What will they cover? Where

Clearly, but what I wanted to know is this...

How much of the book is rules, and how much is background? 50-50? 10-90?
What is the usual ratio for GURPS supplements?

Considering that us early CT\'ers had to kitbash just about everything, I\'d say 
that was a good approximation of what was going on.

We don\'t advocate it for ranges beyond about 5m.  It\'s one thing to
be able to hip shoot and hit a man-sized target at any distance, but
it\'s much more dificult to hit that same target in the "A" zone (the
center-of-mass location required for instant incapacition), especially
considering that two hits in that zone are usually required to drop
your opponent.  We teach a modified "Mozambique Drill" to our students
(2 shots to the chest, pause to assess, 1 aimed shot to the head if
the target is still up.)

Having said all of that, hip/point shooting can be extremely effective
when the shooter is highly skilled and/or properly trained. The late,
great Bill Jordan (of U.S. Border Patrol fame) was a well-known point
shooter and he constantly advocated the technique in all of his
teachings.  If you have good success with this technique, then I\'m
jealous. :^)  Most of us "normal" pistolleros use sights because it
simply takes us too long to become proficient at what you can already
do so well.

If it turns out like the beta materials suggest, it will be an absolute must
for all Traveller products.  There is at least one paragraph for every
system in the Spinward Marches.  Its great stuff.  And if you don\'t want to
play in the Spinward Marches, just use the system descriptions for
worlds whereever you like.

I wish I could post a sample.  Perhaps Loren might.

Yeah, but for rifles, especially lying prone on the rifle range,
I have to press the right cheek really hard into the stock
to get my round face over enough for the left eye to see through
the scope.

If I could close my left eye and keep the right eye open,
I would be alright.  If I were in a situation in which I might
really have to shoot a rifle, I\'d get an eye-patch I could
flip down over the left eye when necessary.

I really don\'t know.  The smaller kind, I guess.  The ones that
the guys down the street swing around on 3 inch thick rope
(which the dog holds onto with his jaw).  They don\'t really swing
them, but they do hold them up in the air.  The dogs seem happy
and aren\'t aggressive.

Are the mastiffs the ones that slobber in buckets?   ;-)

Ob, Trav.  What kind of Vargr specialty products would be common
to encounter?  Besides clothing with tail slot.  Fine combs and brushes?
(Which might be useful to Aslan as well).  Tooth Sharpeners?

I can imagine a merchant getting stuck on a planet far from any Vargr
with a ship load of Vargr care products, but trying to fast-talk an
Aslan that the products are for Aslan and not Vargr.

Civil War ironclads were nearly invulnerable to each other\'s cannon.
Early-to-mid 19th century (and 18th century) forts were essentially
invulnerable to any weapons ships could carry and had to be reduced by long
land-based sieges. 

Machine guns - basically a defensive weapon due to their weight and high ammo
consumption - overwhelmed offensive weapons/tactics for the first few years
of WWI. 

And, as others have noted, currently encryption (if applied properly) is 
*way* ahead of decryption; while current encryption algorithms may well be
defeated by Third Imperium, it seems that encryption beating decryption in
that era is at least as plausible as the other way around.

    'body' => 'Is it just me, or is the 4-hexes/space too low?
I think they meant to say 6 Gurps-hexes / space.
(and they almost did).  Here\'s why

Area per hex:
A hex 1-yard wide at widest point can be
figured at 6 triangles, 1.5 feet/side.

(1/2 * 1.5^2) * 6 =
3 * 1.5^2 =
6.75 sq. ft

The Creating Deckplans sidebar (P.153) says:
"Assuming a headroom of about 8-9 feet and some room
under the decks, a \'space\' in a module can be represented
by six squares or four hexes (GMs option)."

1 space = 500 cf
500 cf / 4 hexes = 125 cf/hex

125 cf/hex  /  6.75 sq. ft/hex  = 18.52 feet!!

Obviously, 18.52 feet as the height of a space (both the headroom
and the space below decks) it way too much.  Subtracting 9 feet
for headroom, we\'re left with 9 feet under-deck space (or over-deck).


I think a more accurate figure is 6 Gurps hexes / space.
(And I\'m betting that there was a typo or some such housekeeping
mistake in the very errata free G:T book).

500 cf / 6 hexes = 83.33 cf/hex

83.33 cf/hex / 6.75 sq. ft/hex  = 12.35 feet.

This is much more workable.  Subtracting a headroom on 9 feet
leaves 3.35 feet under (or above) deck space.  And thus,
each deck would take up 12 feet.  And a 3 foot high inter-deck
space gives you the possibility of having airducts and the like
which are large enough for most Traveller characters to crawl
through.  Gives us some smuggling/stowaway potential.

Smuggling Spaces:
For ship design, we do need someway to balance underdeck
space used for smuggling.  Since that deck space is there for a reason,
i.e., containing necessary conduits, pipes, ducts, etc., each bit of
volume
dedicated to smuggling must be made up somewhere else.

With a 3 foot high inter-deck height, each hex contains
6.75 sq. ft. * 3 feet =  20.25 cf. in volume, which means
24.6 hexes / space (call it 24).

So to add a space of smuggling interdeck area, add
one space of Utility module, with appropriate costs, etc.
(Although, figuring a different number may be appropriate.
I\'m just using the Utility module as a place holder).

Of course, a densitometer will be able to detect inter-deck
spaces, but given the legitimate need for these, it will take a
more thourogh close range and time consuming scan, IMO,
to detect if the inter-deck space is not legitimate inter-deck
space.

  I\'m not sure that I\'d use the term "asinine" to describe the idea of
running a starship around the Imperium without the minimum compliance to
Imperial security regs required to survive the essentially inevitable
searches that will occur, but it will do for now.

  Assuming the ship has a transponder that never has to transmit its\' real
ID it still can\'t risk interacting with most ports (& worlds) without using
said real ID. How do you know whether to have your real ID (or an absolutely
or near-perfect fake) or an untraceable/disposable one transmitting when you
exit Jump?

 "Prime directive"? Are you sure that you\'ve got the right universe? In any
case, reliable ship ID for internal security (and taxation?) purposes hardly
constitutes "Big Brother-ism". FWIW, I don\'t know that the 3I has a "free"
trade fetish, rather than a more general drive towards economic progress.

Actually, IIRC, in Signal GK the predator chips had to physically move and
make contact with the prey.  If this is so, my copy is at home and I\'m at
work, then the entire rationale behind Virus is flawed from the outset.
The Cymbaline "lifeform" was not a free roaming electrical pattern, it was
a circuit that needed a physical "body" to function.  I have not seen
anything that adequately explains how, whether in sound technical terms or
pseudo-science technobabble, how a lifeform that needs a physical body can
escape a confinement like the BB and then roam around infecting systems at
will.

Simply saying, "It works because it does," is not enough.  As posted
earlier that is circular reasoning.  I would be willing to accept the whole
notion of Virus if it could be explained how the chips actually got out of
the BB, when other than the homeworld, that was the only place they were
ever found.  They were not in ship\'s systems, not in Dulinor\'s personal
handcomp, not in LSP\'s mainframe, they were nowhere.  Then how did they
escape the confines of the BB?

They are not energy lifeforms any more than we humans are.  They need a
\'body\' to live.  Seperate them from the body and you have death.

All things considered, Virus is extremely difficult for me to rationalize,
let alone use as written in my games.   And I think that was part of the
reason I never embraced TNE.  Too many changes from the previous 13+ years
of established Traveller Universe.  (The biggie other than Virus:  HEPlaR
instead of Gravitics as new sublight baseline)

Backwater or not, the regulation stated that begining in 1088 and ending 12
years later (1100) all craft would be refitted.  Backwater or not.  Given
the distance between the Solomani Rim and Capital is close to the distance
between the Spinward Marches and Capital, would the Solomani Rim be
considered a backwater?

Your argument invalidates the justification for the new transponders if you
are willing to let one area get by with not complying, then the other
areas, and shipowners, are going to scream bloody murder because they were
forced to pay for something the \'backwater\' area did not have to.

IMO, Virus was a mistake.  If anone on the development group for TNE is on
the list and takes offense, I apologize for upsetting you, but not for my
opinon.

The ironclads were severly underguned due to the weight of their armour.
The harbor defense guns of that time could sink on easily.  They were 10 or
more times larger than the ship mounted guns of that time.  The ironclads of
that time were a failure but they were \'proof of concepts\'.

The forts were defeated by the same type of force that built them which is
what I said would happen with any technology.

Machine guns are not a defensive device in this context.  It is a weapon
with limited mobility.  It does not protect anything from damage.  It\'s soul
purpose is to inflect damage on the opposing forces.  In that sence a ICBM
is a defesive weapon.  I would agree the a Phalanx system is a basicly
defence system as it\'s prime purpose is to protect against other weapons.
Note they are easly defeated by a torpedo. (Grin)

Again there is no incryption scheme that has not been beaten.  That it takes
time I did not dispute.  PGP has been broken for some time.  It just takes a
while to break each new key.  Decryption technology has kept pace with
encryption.  Check the newsgroups that deal with these subject for the
current condition of this ongoing battle.  Sure the sides shift back and
forth but every new scheme is beaten in time.

The historical stuff I read concurning the Empire\'s origins was that they
were a mechanisim to promote free trade.  As for the \'prime directive\' I
ment it\'s primary reason for existance.

As for tax and security I have no problem with a basic Ident system with
antitamper systems.  What I was objecting to was the discription of a Black
Box that recorded and transmited to all other Black Boxes the entire history
of the ship including all stops and all ships met.  This system would be
\'big brotherizm\' on turbo!  It would also be suicide to do this because any
competant enemy would use this data to plan it\'s attack on you and the
transponders signal as a homing beacon for their misiles.  In the orginal
post it was said that these transponders could not be disabled.  How do you
run or hide with your radio screaming "Here We Are!!!"?

Thats what I had thought, just wanted to make sure.

Yes, there is that pesky TL*50Mj rule for lasers they put out in FFS to
keep us inovative Solomani types at bay.  But how would wbe work that out
for GT which uses different TL\'s.  GTL+3*50Mj? Yes, that might work.

For dampers, I have assumed that they have an area of effect - that the
damper node is ten meters or more in diameter (and that a single hit by a 
damping node renders a nuke warhead undetonateable.) This makes a big
difference trying to hit a small high-acceleration-evasion target like a 
missile, since you no longer need to hit it dead on. Repulsor nodes might 
be even bigger - kilometers across - which would let them engage missiles
at very long ranges (several hexes out), with enough time to push a limited-fuel
missile away from intercept, or hold an unlimited-fuel missile still enough 
to pick it off with a laser at long range. I\'m not sure it works well,
though.

If it is typical of other books on races in GURPS, it will have
a racial package (a set of abilities and disads that you have
to take to be a member of the race) with GURPS mechanics
(that usually take up a page for each race) and background
info (which is mostly non-GURPS Specific).  The GURPS specific
info is only a few pages, but you would need to come up
with your own T4 racial generation rules (though you can
use the GURPS Racial package as a general guidline).

Hence my statement that defence (armour) had advanced to the point where 
you could put enough on a ship to make it invulnerable to its own carried
weapons. (Note that even ships with no armour - eg equivalent wooden warships -
were unable to carry weapons big enough to defeat ironclads, which implies
that it wasn\'t just a problem due to undergunning.)

>The forts were defeated by the same type of force that built them which is
>what I said would happen with any technology.
I have no idea what you mean by this statement. Forts were defeated by long
sieges and perhaps infantry attacks - they certainly couldn\'t be defeated by
mobile artillery.

This statement is simply not true. 64-bit key schemes have been decrypted,
but while encryption is linear with key size - a 1024-bit key takes about 16
times as long to encrypt as decrypt - decryption is exponential with key length;
a 1024-bit key takes 65,000 times as long to decrypt as a 64-bit, or 
hundreds of years. The fact that people are lazy and use 64-bit keys doesn\'t
change the nature of the problem, which is that with current technology 
large-key encryption is incredibly more efficient than the equivalent 
decryption - and decryption gets harder much faster as you add more bits. 
That\'s fundamental to the math. Faster computers won\'t actually help;
if computers get 60,000 times faster then one can decrypt 1024-bit in a 
reasonable time, but one can then also use million-bit keys relatively 
casually. So, yes, technically PGP has been "broken", but in practice, with
current algorithms, agressive encryption always wins.

When I was at Ft. Benning, we had an amazing problem with people dumping
unwanted pets on post.  The cats tended to get rabid fast, and the dogs
formed packs.  Every so often squads would have to sent out to sweep
training areas and kill all the dogs they found.  Ever seen a feral poodle?

I\'ve worked it through the modular system and found that GURPS
TL*1,000Mj would be optimal.  This would allow for 50 ton bay lasers,

TL-12 405Mj*(5.75^2)=13390Mj

It looks like GTL*1000Mj would be the way to go, it will make the bays
less powerful than optimal, but thats ok.

Actually, TL * 50-100 Mj is probably more appropriate -- I don\'t recall there
being any laser bays in CT, and in TNE/T4 by TL 15 you can max out with a
socket laser, you don\'t need bay-sized lasers.

lol.  How can they be forged?  If you\'ve given a method for forging them,
please repost (or give me the date/time of that message).  You have alot of

I addressed this in a post to Charles.  What year is TTA set in?  The
transponders were required in 1088 w/ a 12 grace period according to Survival
Margin.  That makes 1100.  Seeing how the Spinward Marches is a backwater,
it\'s more than acceptable a ship or hundred fell through the cracks...  the
cracks should all be fixed by 1116.

This is *not* done.  Only registry information.

Hmm... that\'s a good one.  lol.  Hmm... I don\'t see this angle quite
covered...  Of course, inspection procedures wouldn\'t like the prospect of
having two transponders... off hand, i\'d say a cymbeline chip would know
another one was nearby...  have part of the breeding programming be to fire
the tamper circuit if one is is within a certain distance (like on the same
ship).  For starters, anyways.

I\'m sure that would\'ve come up in the brainstorming meeting...  yeah, thats
it. : )

You just added two qualifiers.  Of course, you have yet to proove that the
material is not *self-consistent.*  The TTA, for example, is easily explained
(and most of the area behind the claw can go for the same expanation).
Backwater, not yet inline w/ imperial regulations.

I see nothing in MT (outside of DGP and that is limited to the SOM) which
invalidates that Deyo transponders are part of everyday use.  The only
inconsistencies would be TTA, adventures etc.  All in the Spinward Marches
area (and explanable by "backwater").

Only registry information is recorded by the transponder.  And in any case,
the transponders aren\'t used in the New Era.   They\'re history, man. : )

Nope.  Last time...  Only registry information. : )

There wouldn\'t be a general uprising.  Most would appreciate the sentiment and
security of a reliable transponder system.  The quacks would be worried bout
Big Brother, maybe... I\'m sure the populace of the US (much less other nations
where firearms are far more restricted) would do quite well w/ handguns and
rifles against the automatic weapons, main battle tanks, and air power of the
US armed forces... yeah right.   You go right on thinking that.  

A 100,000 dt Battleship is going smear the tiny merchant ships even if it\'s
outnumbered 10,000 to one.  The Imperial Navy and Imperial Marines are the Big
Stick of the Imperium.  It worked to subjugate vast regions of resistant areas
(and their mainline armed forces) successfully.

I\'ll paraphrase from Survival Margin pg 70.  

The chips simply judge whether they *believe* the other transponder chip to be
authentic, based the way each chip demonstrates its thought processes.  The
way the conversation goes convinces them one way or the other.  All authentic
chips have teh same slow mutation at the same constant rate.  They will also
show incremental change in their thought processes over time.  The recognition
of this change in a previously encountered chip is crucial to establishing
that it\'s not been merely copied and counterfeited.  By testing these
indicators against the parallel SDG control circuit and its own data in the
ships main computer and its own memory chip, the chip assesses a new contact
as authentic or flawed.

you have this formula wrong, it should be

Repulsors are focused gravetic push??  Repulsors were implimented when
it was assumed that the missles were contact explosions (CT).  A small
push at the right instant would make these miss and reduce the damage by
an order of magnatude.  This lead to the discussion of using det nucs to
detanate outside the range of the repulsors(MT).  IMTU they are only
useful against contact explosives and kinetic-kill missles (less so as
KK\'s have a high approach velocity).  therefore find very little use.

IMTU when Battle Riders were annonced as being decommissioned, systems
were vying for an oppritunity to barrow one or two riders as system

The effect on a missile would likely be similar to the effect on the
human body of falling at terminal velocity into a large body of water: 
deleterious.  Or, as we used to joke about when I was on jump status,
can you say "Sudden Deceleration Trauma?"  Even if the repulsors don\'t
stop the thing cold, the "impact" is likely to destroy the delicate
electronics that make a nuke (det laser or other) go "Boom."

IMTU (YTUMV), repulsors and dampers have a wider area of effect than a
laser would.  In other words, against one or two missiles, a laser is
fine.  Against a swarm of the pestilential things, repulsors and/or
dampers will stop more missiles than the equivalent number/power drain
of lasers.

    'body' => 'Occurred to me that the \'jump tender\' theory might be useful for merchant ships
as well as warship.  This uses a couple of extra modules -- specifically the
separate power plants which I previously posted, and a few described in the
text.  Comments?  Yah, it\'s a huge ship, but there\'s cargo ships on earth with
comparable displacement, so I can\'t say it\'s _that_ horribly large.  On the
plus side, it appears that in G:Traveller it may actually be possible to make
money as a merchant ;)

TL 10 cargo tender:

This is a standard tender ship for bulk cargo -- it is capable of dragging
along twice it\'s own displacement along the mains, and (with a substantial
drop in capacity) can transit jump-2, or even jump-3; with nothing carried
the ship itself can transit at jump-4, which can be very useful in situations
where the volume of trade in two directions is dramatically different.  
While the cargo tender is a civilian ship, many of them have limited
imperial subsidies, allowing them to be used as light jump tenders for
SDBs and other light warships.

The main theory behind a jump tender for cargo is reducing turnover time
- -- the tender drops off a standardized cargo container with all cargo
dedicated for the planet when it enters orbit, and picks up any outbound
cargo at the same time.  This is, obviously, dependent on having a cargo
factor available at the planet (who handles loading and unloading); it
also encourages extremely _regular_ schedules, which occasionally leads
to empty cargo holds, but for the megacorps it can be worth the effort.
In most case cargo containers have dedicated stationkeeping thrusters,
though this is not always true.

A particular feature of this ship is that in it\'s most common configuration,
transiting along J-1 mains, by dropping its cargo it is capable of jumping
without refueling.  While this is not too important along safe routes,
it can be a major feature in troubled areas.

Note that this ship is streamlined.  This streamlining does not apply when
it is using its external grapples.  This does allow the ship to drop its
cargo, refuel at a gas giant, and return to recover its cargo.

Modules: hull class 4000 SL (area 100,000), 30 turrets (area 24,000),
    1120 tons armor (DR 200 body, 100 turrets), sealed, command bridge,
    two engineering modules, 240 units \'unpowered jump\' require 2.4 GW,
    1600 units jump fuel, 15 fuel processors (120/hr), 34 staterooms,
    sickbay, 8 utility, 8 \'tractor\' units (see below), 8 x 5,000 ton
    external cradle (40 space each), 40-space spacedock holds 10,000 cf in
    vehicles, 5 CG units (40 kT lift, 80 MW), 650 units (52 kT) unpowered
    unvectored manuever drive (5.2 GW), 140 space (5.6 GW) power plant. 
    Typical loadout adds ten triple laser turrets (requiring 360 MW), ten
    triple sandcasters, ten triple missile turrets.
Statistics: 4,000 spaces, size +11, 12.3 kilotons unloaded, 52 kilotons
    max load.  4 Gs unloaded (+3 Gs CG), 1 G fully loaded.  Jump-1 with
    8 thousand-space cargo bricks (using 1200 tons fuel), Jump-2 with 4
    (1600 tons fuel), Jump-3 with up to 1300 spaces in smaller cargo
    (1600 tons fuel), Jump-4 with no external equipment.  Max atmospheric
    speed (with no external mounts) 5600 mph.  $1287 MCr, including weapons
    mix listed above but no missiles.
Crew Requirements: bridge crew is normally captain, pilot, navigator,
    sensors, communication, computer operations.  Add two medics and
    thirty engineers, plus typically a night shift bridge crew of
    XO, pilot, sensors, and comms, and six gunners (batteries of five
    turrets).  Total 50.

Module: tractor beam.  A ST 6,000 combination tractor/pressor beam in a
    casement mount.  One space, 10.5 tons, $0.082 MCr.  Can apply 60
    tons of force.  Requires 6 megawatts of power.
Module: external cradle.  Per space, 12.5 tons, $0.025 MCr, capable of
    holding 125 tons (mass) of ship.

cargo brick (with stationkeeping thrusters)
    1000 space unstreamlined hull (area 40,000).  DR 100 armor, sealed.
    One engineering, cockpit bridge with no power plant core, one stateroom
    (for cargo factor), two utility units, an air/raft bay, a 10,000
    cf spacedock for cargo, 940 spaces cargo, 8 kiloton unpowered CG,
    50 ton manuever drives, 21 megawatts of power.
Statistics: 283 tons unloaded, up to 5 kilotons loaded.  Performance from
    .17 Gs unloaded to .01 Gs fully loaded.  $9.1 MCr.

Economic Analysis: assuming about 20 bricks are actually in use on a given
route, the net cost is about 1.5 GCr for some 7500 spaces of cargo capacity,
or about 0.2 MCr per space.  By comparison, two kiloton unstreamlined
cargo carriers run about 0.16 MCr per space; J-2 carriers run about 0.25
MCr per space.  As such, if you can save 20% on turnover time, or the
ability to do an occasional J-2 is needed, this is an efficient ship.
(incidentally, far traders run about 0.25 MCr per space for cargo or crew.

    'body' => 'Hm...based on the responses gained, and some knowledge about GURPS, for
implementation in GURPS I\'m inclined towards:

Repulsor: a repulsor is a tractor beam variant -- as well as being able to
apply force at range, it can produce bursts of force which are sufficiently
powerful to cause damage.  A repulsor is constructed as a gravmop, with the
following adjustments:
Beam can be used either to cause damage (standard gravmop stats) or as a
pressor beam.
When used to cause damage, use normal gravmop stats, _except_ that (a) TL is
10, but weight is doubled, (b) damage is always crushing, (c) the damage covers
a one hex radius, (d) range is *10 in space, and (e) the damage may, if
desired, be spread -- divide damage by the actual radius of the attack.  If
shooting at small objects, there is a base +1 to hit, and use the _larger_ of
<size of object> and <size of beam>.  The size modifier for the beam depends on
the radius -- use the size/range table for the radius and add 2.

When used as a tractor, power consumption is per _minute_, and it has a ST
equal to 10*dice of damage; it may be spread as above.

Effect: a turret-sized repulsor has similar power consumption to a laser; at TL
12 it has ST 360 at 1100 miles in space, and does 6d*7(100).  As 14d(100) is
plenty for missiles, we can use a 3 yard radius (size +3) giving it a total of
+4 to hit.  A bay-sized repulsor does 6d*50, and can reasonable use a 20 yard
(+9 to hit) or even 30 yard (+10) and be effective...

IIRC, GURPS is a simple system. I guess it won\'t be too hard to create
character generation rules, especially not if the meaning of the
advantages/disadvantages are easy to understand (\'Huge size\', \'Extra

Hmm. Well, you must be wrong for a start ... I loathe MT, prefer TNE, but also
like T4 enough to keep it in preference to TNE.

There has been a significant indication of people liking CT and T4 over TNE and
MTRav too.

Maybe the majority would go for TNE and MTrav systems, but I don\'t think that it
would be 50:50.

IMTU, THE Pre SDG chips contained VIN, Name, Owner of Record, Home Port,
Last Maintenance, Last registry payement date, Class, Displacement, Turrets
(but not armament therein), Carriage limits (Td cargo, LSR, SSR, LB, ELB),
Any non-turret weapons, and Owner Status (as of last annual maintenance, in
Owned, Owned with Lien, Leased and Lessor, Loaned and borrower). Only VIN,
Name, Home Port,Transponder Model No. and Displacement are sent on a normal
squawk. An algorythm based upon these and the requesting ship\'s ID can get
the rest.

The SDG chips have all of the above, and may, if connected to the \'puter,
have access to ship\'s log and manifests, as well as being able to deduce
the armaments from the programs in the \'puter. It has all of the standard
knowledge provided at install, and also keeps a list of transponders it has
talked to and their VIN\'s, and an analysis of the veracity (in the chip\'s
opinion) of the data-flow it has recieved. It also has a semi-volatile ram
area for more details on the most recent contacts. It also has a
recreational ram area, where it can put data of interest to its self, and
an area of hard-code for a standard reference database. I figure the black
box to be pretty much a solid IC unit... 3 dimensional circutry. With a
socket for the SDG chip, which is secured with a tel-tale that goes off
when any of the screws is removed. Info available is the same, plus, if the
chip feels it is dealing with a valid and trustworthy Imp-Mil chip,
anything else it may know.

Excellent idea. And if we grant the assassin land in a greenbelt, we can

Based upon the old GDW alien module and upon DGP\'s Vilani & Vargr, and
essentially IMTU:

Personal Care utensils: Combs, Brushes, Brets (decorative, especially),
Manicure Sets, denticure sets (including toothbrushes and tooth files, and
sealant kits for use after filing).

Consumables: Scented shampoos, spices, perfumes (oft too delicate for
humans), hair/fur colorants, breath fresheners, ingested pheremone
production stimulants. Candies, especially meat-including ones. Highly
flavorful fruits.

Clothing: Not just the tail slot, but a much wider array (in less depth) of
patterns, cuts, and materials. Humans COULD wear most vargr clothing with
the exception of footwear... altho most wouldn\'t. The running gag in my
campaigns is the Vasrgr in Plaid Shorts and an Aloha shirt, in contrasting
scemes.

Jewelery: Pretty much same range of items as humans, but with different
stylistic tendancies, especially less "Harmonious" designs than humans
generally would accept.

Tools: Most human tools designed to use a strong pushing or thrusting
action would have vargr versions, most of the rest vargr can use human
ones. Stylistic variants for equipment casings also abound. (ForEx: Vargr
PC\'s would use much more color on the cases, and much more pattering. Make
even the iMac look bland.)

Intangibles: Data, recordings, books, art, literature. Plenty of crossover
with appropriate price reductions; minimal human resale value compared to
vargr resale value.

Scams: Higher likelyhood of non-efficatious medicinal and hygene products.

Accessories: Sunglasses, Scarves, Decorative brets/combs/hairclips.
Obnoxious handbags, bet pouches, etc. Pens in really obnoxiously large
arrays of colors, and some with scented inks.

Furiture: just about anything beyond beds. Human furniture tends to, at the
least, allow tails only as an afterthought. In the marches, and the domains
of deneb and antares, IMTU, most starship couches have a removeable tail
pass-trhough because of the relatively high numbers of vargr (and in the
marches, aslan).

Medicinals: WHile human and vargr medicinals would have a higher overlap
than any other combination of different races (save Human variant and Human
variant), there would be a good bit of difference, since even
human-wolf/dog medicinals vary considerably.

Pets: Mild difference in tastes, altho most pets acceptable to vargr could
be found a good home amonst humans and vice versa.


Gvordz Grouzr
A casual encounter
	Gvords is a fairly well-off vargr merchant. He wears (typically) a
nice 3 piece buisiness suit, with bowtie. Typically, he will be found with
fowered shirts, and psychodelic jackets and matching trousers, with a
contrasting flowered or patterned vest and matching bowtie. Each pattern,
in and of itself, tends to be vibrant but within human acceptable norms.
Added to this is his use of a variety of ear-rings and ear-cuffs, and often
an augillete (Shoulder cord) or two.
	Conducting buisines with Gvordz is prety much like doing so with a
human, save that the initial banter will generally determine the outcome
(carousing, leader, or persuasion to establish the dominant position
without blowing the deal). He tends to order a warm, rare steak with a
highly spiced fruit-based sauce (think of chutney), and a small bowl of
whatevver fruits are in season, and expects the buyer to buy or to go
dutch... He will only pick up the whole tab if the above mentioned roll is
a critical success, and go dutch on a success. He tends to be very literal
if he feels slighted, and very chummy otherwise.
	Gvordz specializes in brokering at Regni Downs, and likes the wide
variety of people and races he meets. If asked, his sole comment on
Humaniti is that they tend to be so poorly diversified phisiologically and
visually, and don\'t even try to make up for it with clothing. Essentially,
he thinks of the human race in vargr terms: packish and adaptable. Gvouds
will not deal with Eibokin (too rigid) or Dandie (too unreadable) persons
except in the most peripheral manners.
	Gvordz has a ship-cat he acquired in a bizzare 5-node-ring swap,
along with a particularly valuable (to his vargr buyer) cargo of rare,
live, edible arthropoids (read: Lobsteroids). His cat is called Vrkrkr,
which he claims is an anchient dialect\'s word for "senior slave". Truth is,
he made up the name, and the back-story, but will absolutely deny this.
Pushing the issue is a sure way to get him angry.
	One other quirk of note: After shaking hands, he will sniff his
palms. He does this to fix the scent of the person in his mind.
	Gvordz is skilled in Gambling, Carousing, Hob-nobing, Brokering,
and knowledge of a wide variety of cuisines specific to the residents of
the Regina Subsector. He is of average build and coordination, and slightly
above average charisma and intelligence, and quite high education, but is
of middle class imperial social standing.

Defense in depth, as well as docking maneuvers, and the supporting
technology for launch tubes at high TL\'s. Dampers also have the added
benefit of being abkle to shut down a fighter, if you follow the logical
extension of the weapon, allowing recovery of pilots for intelligence.
Ditto for piracy and customs.

Also, repulsors can deflect rammers, lasers cannot. The difference between
a ram and a graze is going to be huge, IMHO.

I asume Newton\'s laws still apply, so pushing b from a also pushes a.
Thusly, a repusor can aid in fine docking maneuvers.

Please elaborate...  It seems to me that there\'re two parts: game system
and mythos (and mythos support).  If  both are acceptable, you have a good
match.  If one or the other isn\'t, you have, maybe, an adequate match.  If
neither are, you have junk.

the essence of Traveller, to me, is in the mythos.  We played Runes in
Space (An amalgam of Other Suns, Runequest, and CT, set in 1107 in the
Spinward Marches) and that, to our group, was Traveller.  The rules worked
(OK - they were more detailed than CT, but we accepted that), and the
mythos was great!

Granted, one must like GURPS to think the former (game system) is
acceptable (I happen to).  All we have to go with so far wrt G:T in mythos
support is the book itself.  If follow-on volumes are to that standard, I,
for one, will have little to complain about.  Note:  the overriding
attention to detail of the Trav universe will reveal itself in the present
G:T book and in other follow-on supplements.  If SJG drops the ball and the
follow-ons are badly done or few and far between (or both), then I\'ll agree
with you.  

Do you dislike the game system itself - the mechanics of play, the task
resolution (OK - skill usage; it works out to basically the same thing),
etc.? or do you dislike the support material appearing in G:T?

Repulsors were initially described as focussed contragravity projectors
that either deflected incoming missiles (?small craft) ; or, at greater
levels of efficiency, shredded them by locally increasing gravity around
or through the object (all spacecraft should have 6G+ rated structure
<g>), and then deflected the fragments....Yep, big energies are required
(however only rated at 2500MW for 100-ton bay in MT, 2kW / kN in FF&S2
(50% input to push efficiency)).

They were dropped from TNE and subsequent editions and have been
incorporated into tractor/manipulator beams (TL 16+).

Good point defence with beam weapons is probably easier to reconcile
with usual Traveller tech levels.

I agree that nuclear dampers are a little redundant in TNE/T4 (max range
50000km?) with lasers having a range of potentially 10X that. Perhaps
the firing solution for a damper doesn\'t need to be so precise (a la
Bruce Mac) ; and it\'s the last hope when your point defence fails...

Where do repulsors come in ? We\'ve have some discussion of Honor
Harrington\'s universe and the \'Weber gravitational lensing\' system on
the list recently.

Perhaps the \'wedges\' are produced by several batteries of really souped
up repulsors!

I confess I don\'t understand this. The system is generic, yes, but it can
and has been tweaked on a number of occasions in the past to work with
specific game worlds or game conversions, and does fairly well. I\'m not
sure what "attention to detail" you mean. You mean the mindbending
complexity of FF&S? I will say GURPS does at LEAST as well as CT does in
covering the bases, and with what IMO is a better game system.

Apart from the problems in making a statement about anything "sight
unseen", you\'re right. It doesn\'t model the Traveller character creation
rules...and for that, I am thankful. It is after all GURPS Traveller. And
we definitley disagree about what constitutes the heart and soul of
Traveller. For me, from the beginning of my involvement with Traveller, it
has always been the history and background of the Traveller universe that I
have been most interested in...the history BEFORE the Rebellion. I am one
of those people who liked TNE. I like the MT game system, but found the
storyline depressing and never did much with it. I am happy to have the
alternate history to play around in. And I am happy to have it in what has
always been one of my favorite game systems.

Now, someone WAS working on a Traveller-style character creation system for
GT. I think this would be a fun thing, and would enjoy seeing it
completed..but I won\'t use it. I like having the control, the choice, and
ever since the first time I built a Champions character, I have preferred
point-building to random creation.

This is, of course, my opinion.

   Just before "T4" came out I took a poll of the Traveller players on this
list.  Around half used some form of TNE, while the bulk of the remainder
used the CT rules or some variation thereof.  There were very few people
who used MT.

>There has been a significant indication of people liking CT and T4 over TNE and
>MTRav too.

   I would suspect that most of those who are using "T4" are actually CTers
who converted to the new system.  Few TNE players converted, and of those
who did most who are still around are playing some sort of TNE/"T4" hybrid.

   It would be interesting to see who still plays what.  Unfortunately this
list isn\'t as universal as it once was, thus the survey results will tend
to be overly biased toward "T4" and G:T.

   As for my own game play, I still use TNE with some minor house rule
adjustments.  While I don\'t so much hate MT, I do strongly dislike how it
was carried out, particularly all the errata problems and the lack of
justification to the storyline (to this day I remained unconvinced by the
arguments presented in the MT books that the Imperium was this decayed
structure waiting for something to push it over--there simply was no setup
for this in CT, if anything the 3I is protrayed as being extremely
healthy).  At the same time I understand why GDW felt the need to shake up
the storyline.  Ten years of the same thing can get pretty boring, both the
write and to read.  As for "T4", IMHO pick through and find the bits you
like and burn the rest.  Too many unresolved problems both storywise and
mechanically.  There is a reason why "T5" went from being just another
revision to being essentially a new system.  As for G:T...whatever floats
your boat and pulls your oars through the water.  I know what it is, but
don\'t care to get into it in this forum (good luck Loren).

Harold

For me (and my players), we *welcome* the Rebellion.  It gives them a chance 
to do something *right* for a change, something that makes a *difference*.  
I\'m not sure about the TNE timeline, though.  Fortunately, my campaign is at 
the beginning of 1126, so we don\'t have to worry about Virus for a good long 
while (or mebbe *NEVER* if I decide to ignore it altogether...)

Areas like the Solomani Rim, to me, under the original CT timeline up to 1115, 
was boring.  Not much conflict going on.  It, and the Core Worlds, appeared to 
me to be in heavy decline as a culture.  The Rebellion turned the Solomani 
Confederation from a laughable excuse of a pretender to power into a *real* 
political power on the move, and scraped the rust off the Core Worlds.  
IMNSFBHO, the Rebellion *proves* that the goverment Imperium had decayed to 
the point where drastic change was needed before the entire thing rotted away.

\'Pick & choose\' chargen is something that I\'ve not played much with.  A random generation works pretty good for us, with some adjustments for sanity.  For example, if one of my players blew a survival roll, I didn\'t make them reroll.  We sat down and talked it over a bit to work it into the character\'s background.  Two of my current players\' characters were medically discharged from their services with prosthetic appliances replacing some body parts.  We see random generation as the *beginning* of chargen, not the *end*.  And we get just as playable characters, IMNSFBHO, as a build your own character.

YMMV.

Based on my experience with GURPS, if you think you might want it in the
future,get it as soon as you can afford to.  You might not get a second
chance at it.  I really like GURPS sourcebooks, not to sold on the rules,
but really like the sourcebooks.  I\'m about ready to give up and just start
getting every one I find that I don\'t have :^(

What can I say, they\'re top rate.  In the last couple years the only RPG
book I\'ve found that was better than the GURPS stuff I got in the same time
frame was "Delta Green" which is sort of a X-Files supplement for Call of
Cthuhlu.  If you guessed I wasn\'t overly impressed with T4 you\'re correct.

In answer to the original question of if the material is worth getting when
you\'re playing in a different Traveller setting.  I HATED the TNE setting,
but I\'ve got everything they did, because for the most part it was very
well done, and it was a source of ideas.

In the real world, these are called LASH (lighter-aboard-ship), BARCAT, or
SEABEE (brand names) freighters.  Barges or sections of barges are lifted
aboard the ship fully loaded, carried to their destination, and dropped off
to be towed into port by tugs.  Not only does this reduce port time as you
suggest, but it also allows deep draft ships to unload in the roadstead
while their cargo is pushed inland on rivers to unload wherever needed.
The main problem is utilization:  most destinations don\'t have enough
return tradegoods to keep the barges and lighters full, so many of them
come back empty.

I propose that, since TNE/RCEG (p. 129) already defines "lighters" as
non-starships 100 dtons or greater, the term "LASH freighter" refer to
cargo vessels that carry streamlined riders (for low tech/D-E starport
worlds), while "freight tender" or "cargo tender" refers to the modular
version above with large, unpowered barges, and "container ship" refers to
specialized freighters that carry general cargo internally in standard
containers.


One design caveat:  dton for dton, SDB\'s are much heavier than cargo
lighters or barges, yet external grapples are rated based on the weight
(mass) they can hold.  I had a hard time fitting SDB\'s to a LASH freighter;
I finally had to carry 400 dton SDB\'s one-for-one in place of 800 dton
(streamlined) lighters.

  I\'m surprised that no one has suggested the obvious - using the repulsor
as an anti-missile system with a kinetic kill mechanism. While they do soak
up EP\'s in HG (unlike sandcasters) they aren\'t using enough to credibly do
more than deflect contact missiles from impact, which is insufficient to
keep them in current material, I gather.

  If you use your 50 or 100 ton and 1250 or 2500 MW to sweep bucket loads of
BB\'s through attacking missiles then the arguments that make KKM\'s attractive
(assuming that they can impact) work against the missiles, which unquestionably
do not have their own PD lasers and do have clear limitations on their own
ability to maneuver freely (depending on when in their run that they are
engaged).

  FWIW, "Exonidas Starport" (?) in Dragon #59 used repulsor grids to assist
vessels in landing - similar to the docking assist idea.

        Yours truly,

  Actually, Pratchett wrote an SF novel ("Strata", IIRC) where the adventurers
discovered an artificial world Ringworld style, except that it was a glass
sphere containing a flat earth with the ocean surrounding Eurasia/Africa pouring
off the edges - the plumbing was pretty extensive. For the most part it was
presented as serious SF, and it reads well with enough Pratchett-esque touches
to amuse Discworld fans.

Let me second Christopher\'s comment.  I couldn\'t get GT locally, so
I ordered it online direct from SJG Monday night, and it was waiting

Surely it should be the "canon" 1 MCr to try for membership, nonrefundable, and
a roll of some sort to gain entry or be blackballed?

Why would anyone pay 1 MCr per year?

Even if they did two jumps per month, it\'d only be 240,000 Cr per year for High
Passage, and even an Archduke can get by on 50,000 a month ... 600,000 per year
... for living expenses. And that leaves 260,000 for "mad money".

So why would anyone pay 1 MCr for 120,000 Cr worth of tickets? Or is it an
error?

If I had to face a pack, I\'d want to *be* part of another pack. A
friend had a wolf they\'d rescued from some jerks who had half-killed
her with mistreatment. The family, and a few selected friends like me
were her "pack". 

Some idiots jumped his wife while she was walking Tasha. His wife only
had to deal with the ones Tasha didn\'t go after. And while the cops
didn\'t know that she was a wolf, they didn\'t have any problem with a
"dog" that attacked to defend her owner.

ObTrav: Humans are likely to *still* have dog partners ("working dogs")
imn the Imperium. And I wouldn\'t be too surprised to see *some* Vargr
adopt the practice. It\'d be no stranger than humans working with
chimps. And the Vargr seem to be rather closer to their instincts than
most humans. So they and the dogs would understand each other better. 

Taking one a group of Vargr partnered with well-trained dogs with the
group considering itself a "pack" could be a nightmare.

And even a moderate increase in decay rate will cause the fissionables
to heat badly. And *small* temp changes cause major changes in
dimension in plutonium. Uranium isn\'t quite as bad, but bad enough.

You\'re nasty to PCs aren\'t you.  One Vargr with a well-trained pack
would be bad enough.

To push it one step further . . .

A clairvoyant and telepathic Vargr with a pack or well-trained dogs.

Muwahaha  ;-)

There is a great novel with telepathic wolves.
Vernor Vinge, Fire on the Deep, IIRC.  The wolves are only intelligent in
packs of 3-6, and they all see through each others eyes.

Ye ghods!! Idiots is right! WHO in their right minds would mess with someone
walking a wolf? It\'s not like they look like anything _but_ a wolf or a really
big dog.

The only problem with wolves is you gotta make sure they remember you\'re
alpha, and _they\'re_ omega all the time...dogs don\'t challenge nearly as
often, and intra-pack hierarchy is far less important. Your friends don\'t want
to add a new friend to the pack, and have Tasha decide she\'s _tired_ of being
on the bottom, that\'s a spot for the newbie...sadly we get the idiots around
here who think it\'d be cool to have a wolf for a pet without realizing in the
slightest what they\'re getting into.

Of course, _most_ of these idiots shouldn\'t be allowed to own hamsters, much
less a dog...

obTrav...how _do_ Vargr handle pack relations, particularly when the pack
includes humans who often just \'don\'t get it\' about who is who?

Biting, fighting, slapping, dozens contests?

Because the GOS (Good Ol\' Sophont) network that is club membership...for their
annual fees, many exclusive country clubs are worth little in what the member
recieves from the _club_, but what they get from access to other club members
as peers may be much more valuable.

But, of course the rules don\'t say that...so other advantages (good mods on

The templates for Characters in GURPS Traveller are approximately
90 points.

How many points would you recommend that a character starts with,
assuming that they have spent about 12 years in a  profession before
retiring.

Would a 200 point starting amount seem too much from which to purchase
a template and some other skills.

Could a character purchase two templates and use the best stats from 
each and the skills and quirks that best fit to make a character that
has had a career change.

to wich I couldn\'t help but interject the following:
I agree that Traveller has always been both mythos and Rules, and rules
being the lesser element. However, like dusty, GT, while excellent is "Trav
through the GRUPS lens". Here\'s why:

1) major change to TAS: now yearly fee MCr1, and is a rip off at expected
benefit of 13*Cr8000, plus a little bit, and only exists at class A ports!
Bull****!
2) English Imperial Measurements, not metric. Some say just a triviality....
3) different emphasis of character capabilities.
4) Converting Psionics for maximal effect capability (Esp from MT) is
frightfully expensive...(MT: Psi 15 with Telepathy can get into the 1 E6
range, or worse, in order to maintain full capabilities). So, the system
cannot support certain types of character as having the same level of power.
5) inconsistant use of TWO DIFFERENT TL SCALES merely emphasizes the "Not
Traveller" aspects.
6) Not a background generation system.... a point generation system known
for the most tightly pointmongering rules lawyers around anywhere.
7) No starting play area defined (Yes, there is a SS map, but NO DATA
LISTING!!!). Even CT (The Traveller Book, Deluxe Traveller) had starting
areas with UPP\'s.

While I am aware that "Evil Stevie" (a fond car wars reference to SJ, for
the uninitiated) is known for being a Traveller fan, he and Loren have
created a traveller variant designed to appeal to the GURPS players, who,
by and far, tend far more to rules-laywering, petulance, and player abuse
of the rules mechanics. Not that I dislike the GT supplement... it is well
written (even if it does need a lot of erratta).

And this is where the problem is ... I don\'t think you could get ten people

this list to all agree on the same version of the Traveller game system as
being
the best. I don\'t think there would even be a clear majority.\\


I did not mean to state the above as a general assessment...thats merely the
final decision that my group made after having played all 4 versions w/ me.

Interesting enough question for me to break out the basic book, and refresh
my memory.  It looks like the 90pts is just the sort of character that you
are talking about.

>Would a 200 point starting amount seem too much from which to purchase
>a template and some other skills.

Well, the point table on pg. 11 of the basic book says that a 200pt
character is "Truly Outstanding".  75pt "Experienced", 100pt "Hero
Material", a average person is only 25pts.

I personally don\'t like the system...the one thing I did like about the CT
system was it\'s simplicity (i.e. its skill usage and the lack of a lot of die-

difficulties...which MT fixed by including difficulty levels (This is the
reason my group uses MT)

Having read the G: T book thru now (and finding that the binding is very
bad...already starting to see pages begin to detach after 1 day; please note I
try to preserve my Trav stuff for collectability, so I am NOT roughousing this
book!) what there is of the background is pure Traveller...the library data
and some of the sidebars.  But the GURPS system requires enough changes to
various things that take away the Traveller flavor (and please note that these
are my PERSONAL feelings;  this dosen\'t relate to anyone elses opinions).

A few people have said things to the tune of " It\'s just make-believe...so
just make it up!"  To me this is a cop-out I guess...if I was just going to be
arbitrary like that, I don\'t need any game system at all...just make it up
(but would YOU want to do TCS with me???  :-)

The main problem we had w/ TNE an T4 was the complexity of the systems...esp
the design systems.  I am a gearhead-wannabe;  I got as far as HS Geometry
(and barely that).  I loved the amount of detail and realism that FF&S (both
V\'s) put into the system...but it was far too much detailing for use in an
RPG.  I loved the CT "Calculator and Notebook Paper" system for ship design
(which is largely the basis for MT designs, with some extras added).  I used
to be able to turn out a HG design in 10 min (20 with no calculator).  Now I
have to have my computer and Excel to design one (and never mind designing the
weapons to go in it)  Can you say 3-4 hours, anyone?

Well, GURPS would say, they\'re all the same.  There is an Age disadvantage

that gives you 3 points/year over age 50.  And you can have a maximum of
40 points from disadvantages.

Its not a perfect fit for the Traveller-career-chargen feel.
You\'ll need some house rules for that.

Dom, from what you\'re saying, I think you need to abandon the
templates all together for PCs.  There is no requirement to use them.
Mixing templates will be a nightmare.

Yes, for GURPS, way too much.  IMO, PC class characters should be
somewhere between 100 and 130 points.  Otherwise you get starting
characters that are too powerful.

Yes, certainly.  If the GM allows it you can do *anything* you want,
that\'s an important part of GURPS (and any other rpg system, afaic).

What I\'d like to have are a different kind of template for
Traveller. Something like...

 Eighteen Year Old:  40 pts, no more than 10 in skills, nor more
                     than 20 in disadvantages
  
 College Student:  (4 years), 12 pts total -- 8 pts in degree
                   specific skills required (pick a professional
                   package)
  
 Service Basic Training:  (1 year), 6 pts in required skills/stats
  
 Career Specific Tours:  (4 yr/each), 8 pts distributed among
                          required and optional skills/stats/ads,
                          aimed at fullfilling requirements for one
                          or more porfessional package

And profession packages with min levels in required (and
recommended) skills/stats to be "certified" in various professions.
Like...
    
 Ship Engineer:  Engineering (Spaceship), Power systems (Fusion),
                 Gravitics, Mechanics, Electronics, Computer
                    
 Ship Pilot: Pilot (ship boat), Pilot (space ship), Pilot (CG)
    
 Astrogator:  Astrogation (real space), Astrogation (jump space),
              Sensor Ops, Computer
                 
 Sensor Operator:   Sensor Ops, Communication, Computer     
    
 Gunner:    Gunnery (specialization), Sensor Ops
    
 Steward:   Savior Fair, Cooking, Admin 
 
 Merchant:  Trade, Broker, Bargain, Admin
 
 Navy Officer:  Leadership, Ship Tactics, Admin, Gun Cbt (pistol)
 
 Navy Enlisted: Carousing, Streetwise, Gun Cbt (rifle)
 
 etc, etc
 
As you can see, I\'m including many fewer skills in each of the
template/packages because the player would be building the character
from several of them.  You\'ll notice I didn\'t put in required levels
for stats or skills, because frankly I don\'t know what they should
be...yet.  ;-> There would also be some optional suggested skills,
ads and disads listed for each template and professional package.

Anyway, this kind of thing feels more Traveller-isk to me, *and*
maintains the point-based system that GURPS prefers.  Personally,
I\'d like to include some optional randomization to this, but not on
the first iteration.  ;)

A 100 pt character (not including disads), would be between 44 and
48 years old.  Younger PCs would have lower point totals and older
ones would have higher ones (less aging penalties).  The characters
in a group wouldn\'t be the perfectly balanced ones that GURPS
prefers, but that kind of balance is NOT a Traveller trait, and
should NOT be required..IMO.
                          
So, am I barking up the wrong tree with this, stuff?  Should I
quietly go away, or do you folks think I should continue tinkering
with this idea?

I really like your ideas.  Thanks for sharing.  As soon as I\'m finished
reading G:T, I plan on creating a character generation system akin to
Merc/High Guard for use with the G:T rules.  IMHO the Trav character
generation process gives a good amount of backstory to the pc that is
otherwise lost.

If you are a GM, you might want to concider allowing sharing points.  This
is where some noble player volunteers to sacrafice some of his points so
that some other member of the party can get a properly experienced
character.  For example: In a crew of say five people, each with 100
points each, four of them could relegate themselves to cadets reducing
their points to 10, while the last one gets the extra 40 points and is the
much more experience Captain/Seargent/etc.  I don\'t think I\'d allow more
than 40 points to be used that way (the same as the disadvantage limit).

Along a similar vein, the ship could be bought the same way, except the
better portion of the points would belong to the bank.  These points could
be bought off with cash over time, or possibly directly for points earned
in the service of the bank. I have absolutely NO idea how many points a
ship is worth, but I imagine its a lot.

This is true, although 50 kkm is 1/6 of a light second, which gives a
missile that can pull 6 lateral gees a zone of probability of about 20 meters.

Point defense lasers also tend to be built with shorter ranges than
anti-ship lasers, because you cant tend to hit missiles at a total light
lag of over 1/2 a second (ie 150 000 km).

Nuke dampers also arent worried by the amount of armour a missile carries,
and it\'s a good idea to have some heavily armoured missiles as part of your
package.

Under FFS, you can also make dampers longer ranged by building them bigger.

In my opinion, good point defense is a package of big lasers, small
rapid-fire lasers, \'dash\' missiles and sandcasters. A layered package can
deal with more threats, and more types of threats, than a single method.

Keep tinkering, please. One of the \'defining\' characteristics of Traveller for me is 
that all characters are not created equal (along with one week per jump, speed 
of commo limited to speed of Travel etc.) I don\'t think Traveller is rules or 
background. For me Traveller is a set of basic assumption about the game 
universe which give a distinct "feel".

But the specific depiction of the Deyo transponder appeared in Survial

TNE Rulebook.  Therefore it is TNE and not CT psionic powers that are at
issue.

How about a GURPS Bunnies & Burrows crossover set in the K\'Kree enclaves
across the lesser rift bordering on Vargr space.  The bunny PC\'c are the
descendants of (uplifted by the Ancients) rabbits left in the area by
the Ancients (which might serve to explain rabbit religion).  They have
existed on their home planet for hundreds of millenia.  Then one day a
few thousand years ago the carnivorous Vargr showed up & the bunnies
world was transformed into a nightmare.  But now the bunnies saviors,
the K\'Kree, are on the offensive & will take the planet away from the
Vargr.  Can the TL Rabbit (similar to TL 0) bunnies help the K\'Kree
drive out the Vargr & restore a vegetarian planet....

You\'re welcome.

My idea is a little different from a true CT advanced chargen like
Merc/HG.  I guess it\'s closer to TNE.  <g> I\'d really like to see
your system when you have it ready for viewing.

>IMHO the Trav character generation process gives a good amount of

Yes, I agree.  I\'m a bit of a design-in-play and a design-at-start
person.  DIP people like to take time to "get to know" the character
as he develops.  DAS people want the character to be complete and
well understood commodity when the game begins. I want both. ;->

The career process has always been a good compromise (for me) in
that it allows me to "develop" a lot of the character\'s lifestory
before he gets into the game and "get a feel" for his personality,
likes, dislikes, and style.  But when the game begins, he\'s still
well understood and although complete, up to that point, able to
continue developing and growing.

With GURPS, and other point systems, where the character is
"pointed" out in excruciating detail I just don\'t get the same
*feel* for him.  It seems, for me, that with this kind of character
the *character* is somehow lost in the numbers.  He still *feels*
like a stranger to me.

There\'s nothing *wrong* with the GURPS style chargen, it\'s just not
my cup of tea.  I know I\'m happier with either a CT/MT/TNE style
system, and I doubt I\'m alone in this. ;->

As for the lack of a task system in GURPS...no, it doesn\'t really
have a task system, but it\'s easy to add one.  For example...

Roll <= on 3d6 to succeed:

 Asset+6     Easy
 Asset+4     Routine
 Asset+2     Moderate
 Asset       Difficult
 Asset-2     Formidable
 Asset-4     Staggering
 Asset-6     Hopeless

Jo\'s Climbing skill is competent, but not outstanding (12).  

She is using a belaying line to make a Routine climb up a cliff and
rolls against 12+4=16 (98%) almost certainly succeeding.

Now she reaches a Difficult part and has to roll against 12 (74%).

Suddenly...and unexpectedly...her belay line snaps and she has a
Staggering task to not fall and has to roll against 12-4=8 (26%).  

She\'s lucky and barely succeeds hanging on by her fingertips, but
now without the belaying line climbing the wall is of Moderate
difficulty (+2) and because she is shaken (-2) she\'ll have a
Difficult time and will roll against 12 (74%) to finish the climb.

You know this looks pretty good!  ;-> 

We can even port tasks over from MT/TNE/T4/2300 with this system.
Might need to rethink the task levels and the numbers that go with
them, but I think I\'ve got a second good idea here!  ;->

The Tines weren\'t telepathic.  They \'networked\' with ultrasound.  Great

That\'s a good idea and works if the party is designing characters
together, or even in the same period of time.  However, I GM PBEM\'s
where the players don\'t know what each others character can or can\'t
do, where new people joing the group well into campaigns, and
sharing points won\'t really work.  It\'s the same with a lot of FTF
games too.

I\'d say so!  ;-> If you\'re going to "buy" ships with points, then I
agree that there should be sharing among the party, there will
probably *have* to be sharing among the party. ;->

Personally, I don\'t think merchant ships should be "bought" with
points at all.  You can get use of ships through Scout, Noble or
Scientist careers, but those are patron advantages.  Owning a ship,
as a Merchant, is more a matter of borrowing the money from
investors and creditors and should be an "in game" thread.  The most
I\'d give the players is that you can buy off some percentage of the
price with points prior to game start, after that you pay off a
mortgage monthly with money, not points.

Yes, I\'m not a fan of "party balance", at least not slavish
adherence to balance.  Sure the group should be similar in abilities
and powers, but there\'s no need for every character to be exactly
equal...that\'s not even realistic.  

Personally, I\'m against giving points for disadvantages.  Require
the player to take 20 points of disads, let them take more if they
want, but don\'t give them points for it.  Heck, *you* don\'t get an
offsetting advantage for having bad eyes, losing an arm, or being
deathly afraid of spiders, neither should your character. ;->

And one of the assumptions is that all characters are NOT created
equal.  ;-> I agree.

The standard starting value in GURPS is 100 points. For a "four term"
character, I would go as high as 125 points.

CT, with DGP extentions. ;->

The MT task resolution was introduced by DGP long before MT came
out.  I fell in love with the concept when it first appeared in an
early (the first, I think, but I\'m not going to dig out the magazine
tonight) Traveller\'s Digest. I, of course, had to modify it. ;->

What I didn\'t like about CT/DGP was the "roll higher" philosophy.
I\'ve always prefered the roll low to succeed systems.  Wonder where

TNE/T4 task systems.  I think a TNE task system where you +/- 4 for
each level above or below Difficult is near about perfect.

GT specifies 100 point characters... the GURPS standard.

Keep in mind that gurps has a limit on points spent on skills: 2*age. so,
that said, keep in mind that most characters using the templates will be
pushing that. Also, keep in mind also the up to 45 points more from disads
and quirks. For reference, Lensmen start at around 500-1000 points, and
galactic patrolmen around 200-300, and are epic sci-fi.

IMO, yes, especially if they overlap with each other. I\'d count anything
that is available in both as counting for both. Requires some tweaking...
but doable.

  Or a Zho warrant officer (clairvoyant and telepathic) and a pool of
Zho warbots doing clearance work - house to house resistance against
fully supported Zho ground troops just became a poor proposition, not
even considering teleporters.

Possibly. If you\'re a multi-millionaire (or wannabe) already.

But if you\'re travelling around a lot, as Travellers tend to do, you can\'t
network worth a damn, so it is not as attractive as it might seem.

How many Traveller characters with a bank loan paying off the Free Trader would
be better off paying the 1 MCr off their loan *right now* rather than paying 1
MCr for these sorts of dubious benefits. And what is their cash value to a Free
Trader, anyway? At 1 MCr a year?

It makes sense as a 1 MCr one off fee, at 1 MCr a year it is just silly.

I seem to have missed the thread where this discussion
originated, and I haven\'t sorted through the GURPS 
design sequence enough to evaluate designs yet,
but since I\'m the guy who came up with the TL*50MJ
laser limit in the first place, it might help to
go over _why_ it was imposed in order to help you
evaluate your designs.

In Classic Traveller\'s High Guard and in MegaTraveller,
starship weaponry could be ranked in a rough heirarchy:
the most powerful were the spinal-mounted particle
beams(PAWs) and meson guns (MGs); next in line were the 
bay weapons: smaller PAWs and MGs, plasma and fusion 
guns, repulsors, missile bays, etc.; at the low end 
were turret and barbette weapons -- lasers, missiles, 
tiny PAWs, and sandcasters.

As you can see, lasers were small-fry. And since
the HG and MT design sequences used only plug-in
weapons, they stayed there.

However, in TNE, lasers could be custom designed.
On top of that, since plasma and fusion guns and
small particle beams had been made unfeasible for
starship weaponry, lasers were used as substitutes.

After FF&S (Traveller: The New Era\'s design system,
for those reading this on GURPSnet) came out, 
I\'d been playing around with cruiser-sized PAW
and MG designs when I decided to try a 20,000 MJ
laser, since FF&S had no rule against it, and
realized that -- when all ship design and combat 
factors were taken into account -- big lasers were
the weapon of choice and logically, under FF&S design 
rules, capital ships would _not_ mount PAWs and MGs
as their primary weapon.

In terms of Traveller background, this was (yet another)
big break between TNE and the previous editions.
Of more immediate concern to GDW was the fact that
this made their starship combat games less interesting:
instead of commanders balancing the strengths and
weaknesses of four major weapons systems (lasers, missiles,
PAWs and MGs), combat would be reduced to laser/missile duels.

After some groping to find a fix that would:
A) keep lasers in the low- to medium-strength range
of starship weapons; 
B) not invalidate the lasers that had already been 
published; and
C) was _simple_,

I came up with the TL*50 MJ rule, which fit all
of the above criteria. It was never formally
adopted in TNE, but it became a widespread "house
rule" there. T4\'s FF&S2 was written by some of the
people I\'d discussed those problems with, and the
rule was incorporated into that system.

The upshot of this history lesson is this:
What\'s the best way to mesh the assumptions of the
Traveller background with the facts of life 
according to GURPS design rules?

Where do GURPS weapons designs "stretch" Traveller\'s
notion of those weapons, but don\'t really change
anything important (in which case, go with the 
standard GURPS rules), and where does it stretch things
past the breaking point (in which case, some limit or
modification of the standard GURPS rules is appropriate).

And to help you decide this, play around. Go with extremes.
Do things you\'re not "supposed" to, but there\'s no
rule against it. Hack the system. And when you\'ve
figured out where what you _can_ do doesn\'t square
with what you "should" do, either come up with your
own solution (using criteria A, B, and C above), or
make a post laying out what the problem is and let
the rest of the gearheads chew on it.  :)

Seriously, I do use the MT rules AS THEY WERE MEANT TO BE (i.e, after taking
into account the errata that has come about since the first printing), w/ a
lot of CT thrown in (mostly background...never have played the Rebellion w/ a
group, but don\'t believe the plotline has to be the dead-end GDW made it).  I
am trying to decide wether to transport my current group back to the Imperium
(they are currently in a sector I am detailing, non-Imperial; time is ca.
1116) or send them further into unknown territory (they still have some strong
ties to the Imperium)  If I do, they will re-appear there about the after the
news reaches the marches...around 1117.  I haven\'t decided yet...and knowing
my players, they will pick a 3rd option anyway!  :-)

100 points is a good number.  The point is to take a template and use the 
extra points to flesh out the character.  You don\'t even need to 
religiously follow the templates -- some interesting characters come when 
you fall outside the typical skills for a profession.  Templates are a 
pretty new concept in GURPS -- mostly I like them, but only if you use 
them as frameworks and not as the entire character gen system.

200 points is definitely too high except for really high power campaigns. 
 That\'s where I generally run "pulps" style fiction.

Well, there will be a 128 page book on the Spinward Marches.  Is that 
good enough for you?  Sure, they could have put a microscopic listing in 
the book, but would it have done you that much good?  Would it have been 
enough information to really run anything?

Boy, I\'m glad you don\'t have an opinion here or anything.  Sheesh.  I\'ve 
been playing Traveller for 15+ years and GURPS for about 10 and there is 
not really that much of a difference between a hunk of random rolls and a 
point system.  Yes, point based systems occasionally lead to abuse -- but 
only if you are an incompetent gamemaster.  Frankly, every game I\'ve run 
for a long time I\'ve basically said two things to players:

1)  Don\'t try to rules-lawyer.  I\'m sneakier than you are.  Plus you 
won\'t be invited back.
2)  Make interesting characters.

#2 is more indirect -- it is mostly asking the characters about 
individual skils, advantages and so on -- why they have them, how they 
react to different things  -- making the players think more about their 
character than mere numbers.

For example, if someone brought be a former Naval Officer with Status 0, 
I\'d probably ask them about how they reacted to the general 
scorn/abuse/whatever from those with personal priviledge, who routinely 
gained promotions (and maybe didn\'t deserve it).

Basically, any point system is just a starting point.  Same with random 
die mechanics.  It is the framework, but it doesn\'t have a soul.  Whether 
you try to take some random die rolls and construct an interesting 
persona out of it, or design an interesting character from scratch, the 
end goal should be the same --  to breathe life into the characters and 
the setting.  And players who don\'t do that generally aren\'t invited to 
play in future games -- I\'d rather play with interesting players.

GURPS Discworld discusses the possibility (but not specifically mentioning
Traveller). GURPS Traveller does not cover the possibilityat all, but it
should present no problem to the referee with some imagination.

Depends, but usually 70-80 percent is background and 30-20 mechanics.
Generally, the running joke around here is that GURPS supplements are
really supplements for other role-playing games, the SJG just doesn\'t know
it. For example: Space, Ultratech (1 and 2) and Biotech sourcebooks are
wonderful source of info for ANY SF campaign. So is Cyberpunk.

Pretty close isn\'t it, I use 7 task levels, though.  ;-> I said I
fell in love with it.  I also said I changed it and liked rolling
low, so that\'s what I did.  With slight modifications it works with
3d6 (+/- 3), 2d6 (+/- 2), can be connected with FUDGE description
labels for skills, and...to me...just feels right.  ;->

How about starting your 18 year old with 33 + 2d points (giving a range of

[raises hand]

Though I\'m not sure if I really count - I\'ve run essentially the same two
space campaigns (one near-term, pre-FTL, the other set in the Islands
Clusters) by turns for years, using whatever system the players I could
find were comfortable with:  Traveller (CT or TNE - I\'ve never used MT or
T4), R. Talsorian\'s Cyberpunk/Deep Space, GURPS Space/Cyberpunk.  

I reincarnated my Islands Clusters campaign as soon as SJGames announced
the GT project, used GURPS Space rules and CT background until the playtest
material went up, switched to the playtest beta, and now I\'m retooling to
use GT as written.

atually, no it is not... If you\'re going to put a subsector map in, you

Gee, sounds about even experiential base there. I will NEVER AGAIN play in
nor run a GURPS event at a con... compared with the other gamers, the
"gurpsies" were the rudest, whiniest, most rules lawyering bunch I have
ever encountered...

>1)  Don\'t try to rules-lawyer.  I\'m sneakier than you are.  Plus you
>won\'t be invited back.

inneffective with most hardened gurps players I\'ve met. If they aren\'t
allowed to misinterpret the rules, they generally leave. Most of my player
base refuse to play GURPS, but are willing to play hero... and I have been
active in the local gaming community up here for over 13 years, in the end
of running/seting up/GMing local/statewide Cons. One local con refused to
allow a GURPS event due to the whining interrupting everyone else the
previous year.

>2)  Make interesting characters.
>
Again, this seems to be a failing amongst most die-hard GURPS fans... most
of them "Clone" their characters, having a pre-set pick of certain
advantages and disadvantages they take, and never do they vary this core.
This has been endemic in every GURPS game I\'ve encountered.

These are not problems endemic to GURPS, but problems caused by the GURPS
mechanics appealing to that type of player, especially of late.

Random background generation tends to attract individuals willing to play a
wide variety of character types, and willing to take a frame and build upon
it, rather than detail driven point generators.

Hum, I was thinking about this and came up with just about the same
idea.

First, how the points are generated...

Eighteen year old initial points:  30 + 3d6 (33 to 48)

College (2 yr terms): 2d6 per term
 Vocational Track
   1. Applied Tech Degree (each term is for a different specialty)
 Academic Track
   1. BA/BS
   2. Masters
   3. PhD
     or
   3. JD
    or 
   Medical Track
    3. Medical School
    4. Intern
    5. Resident (MD)
    
Academy (4 year term):  10 + 2d6
  Military
  Naval
  Merchant
  
Careers (4 year terms): 3 + 2d6

Players are encouraged to purchace Advantages and Skills as they go,
however unexpended points carry over from term to term.

Second, what do you spend them on...

A. Develop *small* templates/packages for 
   1.  Organization specific templates (examples)
       a.  Navy Enlisted Life       
       b.  Navy Officer Life
       c.  Merchant Life
       d.  Scout Life
       e.  College Life

   2.  Profession/Job specific templates (examples)
       a.  Starship Engineering
       b.  Starship Piloting
       c.  Scouting Techniques
       d.  Merchant-Trade Operations
       e.  Medical Doctor
       f.  Naval Combat 
       g.  Ground Combat
       h.  Construction Worker <g>
       
[This looks doable, to me at least, but I think the college terms are
going to be a problem.  They always were in Traveller chargen, so
why should they be different now.  ;->]

How does this look to everyone?

Sad to say GURPS players are not the only whining rules lawyers on the block.

I\'ve been playing roleplaying games for 17 years and they are everywhere. 
It\'s like saying all people who play AD&D are hack-n-slash, need to move out
of their parents house overgrown 10 year olds.

Point being that a few bad apples should not be grounds for condemning people
because they happen to play with a game system you may not like.

Generally.  I can\'t think of any ones that you would have at

I particularly liked the quick conversion rules by
Ian or Katts  Subject: Quick Trav -> Gurps Trav characters.

As this seems to be more to my liking.  I do not like points
based systems in general, but this system gives a basis for 
the character concept.

I was looking for a system which would be so many points at
age 18, and then every four years afterwards a number of points.

I do not like the point for disadvantages, why should the blind
chap with unsanitary habits and spits a lot in public have more
points.  

K\'Kree should be fun lots of insanities to collect, lots of dependants.
(especially those Bunnies).

I mentioned the option of 200 points because I was contemplating 
the possibility of using two templates.  Obviosly the Barbarian and
the Spec Ops Marine :)

As to starting rules - I did not read the 100 points max bit as I only
picked up to book yesterday (UK FLGS).


Would 10 points for the MOB of TAS membership seem too expensive, rather
than take a fantastically rich character trait and purchase the membership
directly.

In GURPS space there is a TL modifier to the starting wealth - would this
seem appropriate to use for Traveller.

- ----

Now experience points seem to unbalance the game very quickly (the
IQ monster was mentioned)

Does anyone consider the issuing of experience points fractions to be
the way forward.  You did well on your piloting skill you can have .2
points on that skill.  However, your character did not spit enough so you
loose a total of .1 points.

Points only by Instruction - (old CT / Expanded rules) no experience points
are awarded in normal course of events, but can learn .25 skill points per
week or so of training.

Or only issue experience points on the completetion of a particular mission,
like the end of the Traveller Adventure or the end of the Arrival Vengeance 
tour.

TIA once again.

Well, the 100 point "standard" would work fine.  Though if the
GM wanted more heroic characters he might up it a bit.

Well, at 200 points the templates are going to need a fair amount
of fleshing out.  OTOH, whether this is a good thing or bad thing
depends on how you look at it.  It means that newbies won\'t have
fairly complete characters, but it also give people using
template more room for customization (though one can always
ignore parts the templates if the wanted more leway).

>Could a character purchase two templates and use the best stats from

Templates are completely optional.  There is no reason you can\'t
use them any way you want w/out worrying about game balance.

GURPS was never going to be Traveller in that it was going to
have all the quirks of the Traveller rules mechanics (like
random generation).  Nor should it have been.  If that is what
one wanted, then you should take the MT rules books (or whatever
rule system floats your boat) and reprint them.   What it does
do is give the feel of the background quite well.

Now some people are using this to assail it as "not Traveller".
I think this has more to do with people who didn\'t want the
GURPS mechanics pinning for the "good old days" of MT (or
whatever) mechanics.  Now I respect their preferences, but
to say that those who don\'t agree should say that GT is
"Traveller" is being a bit closed minded about it.

Generally the choice of character points is based more on

Well, I was running a GURPS Traveller I wrote myself before
GT came out and I\'m am going to switch over to the rules in

How many "scruffy nerf-herders" do *you* know who can ante up 1 MCr *per year*

I don\'t think of the Rebellion as the end of time.  Just the end of the

Sure, I\'m a bit of an Excel expert (I wrote the first go at the save/load 
macros for Andy\'s spreadsheet).

Your grade 11 class could look at various ways of making user interfaces 
"easy" to use:

Why no have a button that toggles it\'s caption from No to Yes (or whatever 
is approriate).  The button is placed over the relevant cell and just 
changes the number in the cell.

Tiny button that togles as above, but effect of the value selected is in 
the adjacent cell with an =choose() formula.  The button is just a way to 
use the mouse to cycle through options, rather than entering a number.

Buttons and drop downs are a pain to use (in Excel) without a mouse - why 
not practice some menu design with your class so they can try that approach 
as well (I\'m just getting the hang of the new drag & drop menu design in 
Excel 97 ... much more like using VB or Delphi menu design tools) - the 
only problem is that I can\'t make menu changes that are only available when 
a specific spreadsheet is loaded.  In Excel 97, menu re-design seems to be 
global (i.e. for any spreadsheet) - I prefered the "old" method of menu 
changes being file-specific.

Ecept for me, who runs CORPS, using Gurps Ultratech 1 and 2, Biotech, and
Cyberpunk for ideas, and Brilliant Lances for space combat.

Trying to declare what Traveller *is* based on mechanics is like blind men
trying to define the elephant.  There have been four distinct,
non-compatible sets of mechanics for this game.  The only links have been a
fairly hard-sf edge and the setting.

It\'s way too late, and I\'ve had a bitch of a day, so be warned.

I guess everbody who is complaining about the points-based character
generation in GURPS are complete slaves to the dice in Char gen.  Y\'all
have never fudged a roll to help someone achieve a character they wanted to
play.  "Gee, sorry Bob, but Starkiller Deathwind has left the Navy with
Admin-4 and Steward-2.. that\'s the dice for you.."

GURPS (and CORPS) allow a player to create exactly the PC he or she wishes
to play.  Unlike the Heinlinesque strong-jawed heroes without a flaw I\'ve
seen generated from Traveller, my players\' CORPS characters have
shortcomings that get played out in the game.  One of my roomates plays an
ex-Marine with traumatic nightmares.. he depends on his imposing size to
win fights, because he fezzes when bullets start flying.  Explain to me how
that comes up in any of Traveller\'s incarnations.

There is an easy solution for the rules-rapist who takes "one-hand" as a
disad then wants points for each finger; you say "not in my game."

8% rates of return are a lot higher than standard Traveller starship

However, as a quasi-Imperial body, TAS could awards a fixed number of
annual-fee free life memberships each year to the Imperial Navy, which then
awards them through it\'s own processes - I personally think anybody who
gets a Starburst for Extreme Heroism should get one on leaving the service,
for example.

The other option is \'Associate TAS membership\', which should be cheaper but
give a lower level of service.

Alternativly, relabel references to TAS as \'The Octagon Society\' or
something - thats the one the stuffy noble types join, and turn TAS into

Dlan\'s astroid field and were brought into High port under tow.
Constructing an amasing plan to escape, foiled the Ilelish Gard and went

rescued the Zho Princess from interagation by Dulinor, via the garpage
disposal with the help of the Zho apprentice, and a cupple of Warbots he
brough allong (disarmed so as not to rasie suspition). The Far Trader Rust

Start with a complete and viable 75 point character at age 18.  The usual
advantages and disadvantages are available, but this is the only time
players may choose *inherent* dis/advantages - things like Danger Sense or
Empathy, or disadvantages like Albino.  The -40 point limit on
disadvantages still applies, and will continue to apply as a maximum
throughout the process.  There is also a 36-point limit on points spent on
skills (per GURPS Basic Set, p. B43). If you want, you can restrict the
initial skills list to what reasonably might be available to a teenager IYTU.

For the first term, add 25 points (as if it were experience).  This
represents basic training, college, or some such - the learning curve is
steeper - and brings the character level with his peers from straight GT.
The points can be applied to advantages and attributes as well as skills,
and additional points can be gained from disadvantages if the -40 point
maximum has not been reached. Here is one place where this system cuts the
character a break:  attribute adds cost their listed amount, not doubled as
is usual after the start of play (since this is still technically chargen).
 Skills (and possibly advantages and disadvantages as well) should be taken
from a specific career\'s template; the maximum of (age x 2) in skill points
still applies.

For every term thereafter, add 10 points as above.  This is what an average
character would receive on the job anyway (p. B184).  Specify a career for
each term, but it need not stay the same from one term to the next.  Don\'t
forget to apply aging effects, although in GURPS these are much gentler and
start later (aging rolls begin at age 50 for TL7-; optionally per GURPS
Space, p. 66: 70 for TL8, 90 for TL9, and 110 for TL10+).  If the character
doesn\'t have disadvantage points left to take the Aging disadvantage, he
musters out automatically.

Quirks can be added at any time during the process, or you can simply let
the character have the -5 points and see what quirks develop during play.

You can also mix this system with Ian Whitchurch\'s quick conversion.

This system has a distinctly TNE flavor; whether that is a Good Thing (tm)
or not is up to you.  I have playtested it on my Traveller group:  the
experienced GURPS players griped a bit at first, but they got into the
spirit of the thing eventually.

Doing the disadvantages as described above seems to encourage players to
tie them to specific advantages or points of character history, as they get
added over time.

>In GURPS space there is a TL modifier to the starting wealth - would this
>seem appropriate to use for Traveller.
>

I can\'t find the specific rule you mention, but in general there are two TL
effects on wealth in GURPS:

(1) Starting wealth varies with *campaign* TL, per p. B16.  If you are
bringing equipment from a supplement set at a different tech level into GT
(medieval armor from GURPS Camelot, say), it is appropriate to multiply the
listed price by ($15,000 / starting wealth of other campaign), to keep the
numbers compatible.  Otherwise, don\'t try to use the table on B16 - it
reflects the then-current supply of money at each historical tech level,
and doesn\'t form a consistent economic system.

(2) Prices vary with TL within a campaign, per GURPS Space p. 45.  You can
handle this one of two ways:  assume that all prices are in Imperial
credits, and that low tech goods are simply cheaper on high TL worlds; or
set up an exchange rate system, with the rate doubling every TL above 8,
and halving at every TL below 8.  In the latter case, there will be
tremendous difference (x16) between getting paid in TL12 (Imperial) credit
and TL8 credit.

Sort of. That is, I converted a T4 campaign to Gurps in 97 (I did the same
with a TNE campaign in 96.) Haven\'t yet decided whether I will reawaken that
one or start a new one when I actually get Gurps Traveller.

If you were using a toroidal fusion reactor (Tokumak?) and lost the

I\'ve got a copy too (picked it up in 83) but it\'s worn too death now - I\'m

I think what has happened is that we\'ve all got more lazy. Look at the
games systems which have survived the last 20 years - Traveller, Runeques,
AD&D, Cthulhu - and the slightly younger but still healthy games -
Shadowrun, GURPS, etc - and they all (bar AD&D) have an extensive
background pre-written. In the older games it evolved - in the newer it has
been created quickly.

Look at the style of the old Traveller adventures to books like /Missions
of State/. /Twilight\'s Peak/ (Forex) left much of the work to the Ref to
hang the game around. It was a great \'meta-plotline\' but you had to develop
a host of smaller adventures to hang it around. But things \'progressed\' and
adventures became something with all the stats which is so much easier for
a rushed ref to use.

Also, look at the older material - most of it was rules - and compare it to
something recent. You had to generate your own material now. The problem is
(and it\'s as valid in Traveller as it is in other systems) that there\'s a
reluctance to break with written material (\'canon\'). In some cases, I have
seen players as fanatical about the background and rules being followed
properly as people used to be about AD&D (/rules lawyers/). We have that in
Traveller (and I\'m as guilty as everyone else, maybe a little luckier as
some of my material has become part of that written mass of work) as much
as everywhere else. I find consistency easier to argue for in a hard Sci-Fi
game than in a fantasy game, but it is the same state of affairs.

One of my friends quoted someone (can\'t remember who but I think it had to
do with Faded Suns) saying that they had to release a new supplement every
two months or they would have cashflow problems. So in addition to our
demand for pregenerated background, the game companies have an interest in
supplying a universe with a background. We buy the background, not the
rules. And in the face of the market impact of games like /Magic/ the
companies needed something we will buy to keep themselves in business.

I\'m not really knocking either the pregenerated approach, or the homebrew
universe (I like a synthesis of the two) but you could consider the
difference as being analogous to making a meal yourselve from a wide and
varied set of ingredients, and buying a prepared meal ( or knocking it
together from a few modular components ). Both are satifying, but which one
will the maker feel most proud of?

I just obtained a copy of /SLA Industries/ (which is not the nicest game
out) but I was impressed by two things. The amount of background and the
way it had been structured to allow the referee to use it in their own way.
Details etc are presented as reports, and much of the background is hinted
at but not directlt stated. The referee has the option to take it further
themselves (in almost any way) or wait for a supplement. I bought a
supplement too (/Karma/) which is 95% background in the same style, with
about ten pages of rules interpretations. It was nice to get a game which
leaves so much to the referee (and looks so pretty - published by a small
company, using an Atari Falcon it blows away IG\'s material).

Milieu 0 did this for me (almost). From the heavily defined background of
the 1100\'s we came to a period where the unknowns were all beyond Core
sector, where there was scope for a referee to use their own background
because (in the overall scheme of Traveller\'s Timeline) most events would
be lost in time. In addition, the rules were streamlined (aside from FFS2).
It\'s a shame that IG didn\'t have the attention to detail to make the game
as good as GT is...

I\'ve wandered around a bit in this, so to summarise - gaming is different
today with more emphasis on background(*) for both personal reasons (it\'s
what we want/time constraints) and for market reasons (surviving the CCGs
and a shrinking market).

Dom

(*) Forex - look at Chaosium - allowing AH to keep the Runequest System but
retaining the rights to the background, Glorantha.

I\'ve been involved in playtesting a Full Thrust / Traveller conversion -
interestingly, the lightweight ships (small battle riders with eggshell
defenses) attempted to close and start a point blank meson gun duel with
the heavy cruiser. They outnumbered it three to one, lost two ships in most
games, but managed to cripple the cruiser... close range is viable
sometimes ;-)

Well, maybe the time he doesn\'t spend on acquiring all those annoying social

tremendous wealth? ;-)

Sounds about right, if all it gives is a ticket a month. If it includes,
say, a reaction bonus, Claim to Hospitality, etc, I\'d charge more.

Definitely.

While it *can* be a problem, being consistent from the beginning helps.
Before I got the hang of it, I\'ve given both too much and too little,
neither of which is good. It also depends on campaign style. For a classic
traveller style (noone learns anything new) very small rewards are certainly
right.

Yeah, I\'ve used a system somewhat like that in my campaigns for the last few
years. (Depending on whether I want the players to rise in power quickly or
not (and how much progress they\'ve made in the adventure) I give from 0.5 to
2 points of \'regular xp\' per session. This xp they can either spend on
anything they\'ve done during the session or put in a pool to buy something
more expensive later (I require that they state just what they are saving up
for, no general unassigned points.) The major part of the xp however are
given for skill-use. Each successful (and worthwhile, I reserve the right to
say no) skill use gives .05 xp (equivalent to 10 hours of training) in that
skill, or .10 for a critical success.)

I\'ve tried this, but - at least for my group - it didn\'t work too well. It
brought back old memories of the bad old AD&D days. (It feels a bit too much
like levels to us.)

I have a Mileau 0 campaign that will be moved into GT as soon as I and the
players can arrive at a time to do so. I am also thinking of reviving my
long-dormant TNE campaign for the occasional adventure using the GURPS
rules. And, of course, I am running an adventure right now set in the GT
timeline.

GT has mostly background but little in the way of rules for coming up with new

Well doesn\'t crumble their cookies then. It looks like they were 
unable/unwilling to play "Monty, Monty, Let make a Deal" with Roger Sanger
who 
last I heard had the rights to the Digest Group Publications stuff including 
"Vilani and Vargr" . Sounds like a cranial rectal inversion on all parties
part.

That also means that the Vargr subraces are up for grabs so to speak, so I
will

have to join IO to get a look at the playtest files then, so the additonal
Vargr 
subraces will have better fit into Gurps Traveller.

By the way what will the Aliens Race: 1, have in it for the Vargr? A detailed 
history and such? Or will it have more previously unmentioned subraces/races 
like the T4 Alien Archive did?

Thank you for your response to my request.

Not me.  Like always, I\'ll use anything I like from it and continue
to use whatever mishmash of homebrew I\'ve got going at the time.

You know, it\'s weird...I simply love to tinker with rule systems,
but when it comes to actually *playing* (or GMing), I always use
very subjective and simple methods. 

I spend *way* too much of the free time I allocate to roleplaying
working on objective and detailed chargen systems...time I *should*
be spending on the games I\'m in/running.  ;-> Anyway, as much as I
enjoy tinkering with objective chargen, I\'m a *big* fan of
subjective (descriptive) chargen for play.

 I think this has more to do with people who didn\'t want the

 to say that those who don\'t agree should say that GT is

I seem to have been misunderstood about my position...I am, indeed, "pining
away" for a return to the CT/MT style system (which is still quite visible in
T4 as well);  however, that is not why I say that G: Trav is not Trav.  I say
that because it just ISN\'T Traveller...it\'s GURPS Space w/ the Traveller
background thrown in.  As to being close-minded, I did wait until I had gotten
my copy of the game before making up my mind.  I will still support at least
the Traveller aspect of GURPS (for the background, as well as preserving the
visiblity of Trav), but it has not converted me to a dyed-in-the-wool GURPS
fan by any means.

This should not be taken as being disparging to anyone who does feel that this
is the best thing to ever happen to Traveller...it\'s just not for me I guess.
I grew up almost literally w/ Traveller (14 years now). I\'m just an old fuddy-
duddy I suppose.  :-)

Your experience differs greatly from mine. The people I play GURPS with are
highly intlligent, interested in roleplaying, build characters that have
personality, and know that I am very accomplished in the use of the word
"NO" if they decide to try to slip something in on me...actually, your
experience above mirrors my experience with CHAMPIONS players far more than
GURPS, but I do not assume that everyone is like that, or slam the game
system, just because of a few idiots I\'ve encountered. As for cons, well,
cons are a different world, and in fact if you game more at cons than in
the usual enviornment, say, your own home or a friend\'s, you\'re likely to
have a distorted viewpoint.

My players have constructed a really great group for my GT game; characters
with far more "personality" and "life" than I have seen in some time in
Traveller. I am quite happy with the situation.

GLENN-CLASS SURVEY SHIP

	The Glenn-Class Survey Ship is designed for exploring uncharted systems on
extended missions. It carries a team of scientists aboard, as well as
numerous vehicles. The IISS has 6 of these currently operational, but
others have been held up due to budget cuts and the feeling that, since the
Imperium doesn\'t do much out-and-out exploring anymore, these ships are not
as useful as more straight warships. The ships of this class are named for
famous Solomani space explorers.

600-ton USL hull, DR 209, Command Bridge (hardened), Engineering, 25
Maneuver, 24 Jump, 360 Fuel, 3 Spacedock (capacity 750 cf, 1.5 displacement

Skimmer Module and a Lab Module), 6 Turrets (3x Triple Laser Turrets, 1x
Missle Turret, 2x Sandcaster Turrets), heavy compartmentalization.

STATISTICS: EMass 947.76 tons, LMass 1250.224 tons, Hull Size Modifier +9,

NOTES: The ship has double-fuel tank space, allowing it to make 2 jumps of
3 parsecs before refuelling. In practice, it refuels after each jump,
saving the extra fuel for insurance against misjumps, as it intended to
operate in frontier areas and unexplored regions.

I have heard a lot of game store owners making the statement that companies
don\'t publish adventures anymore because they won\'t sell (these are generally
the same owners who don\'t stock anything on thier shelves but cases of Magic
cards and "special order" things once every 2 months;  if your REAL lucky).
But I know from my standpoint, I don\'t have a lot of time to put into
developing an adventure.  It was different when I was a teenager...work was
only part-time and I didn\'t have to worry about the adult responsibilities I
have now.  I would much sooner have a chance to buy adventures that can be
used to get a game going when I haven\'t had time to work out my campaign
adventure.

Just about 3 weeks ago, I had my group over for our Sunday afternnon Travfest,
but I had been feeling sick all week (my virus is now resistant to the
protease inhibitors I was taking); I didn\'t want to blow off the game though.
I just dug out my copy of Double Adventure 5, made a few mods, and scared hell
out of my players w/ Chamax Plague (picture the Chamax being taken on by PCs
w/ only Snub pistols and shotguns...fortunately the NPCs had slightly heavier
weapons, and being dead they didn\'t mind the PCs using them!  :-)

I love sourcebooks, when I have the time to make my own material using the
sourcebooks...but I also believe there is a place for pre-gen adventures in
any game.

Now we just have to drag the kids away from them damn Magic cards and those
lousy Playstations...the top 2 contributors (IMO) to RPG\'s becoming less
popular.

Isn\'t is possible that the "exploding fusion reactor" is nothing more than a
collapse of the magnetic containment field?  Granted, this would not cause a
nuclear explosion...but I doubt the plasma from the fusion reaction would cool
instantly.

I have always thought that when the mag bottle fails, the plasma expands
outward extremely rapidly, causing an "explosion" of sorts that could
potentially be catastrophic...I seem to recall some instances in the books
where a ship was not vaporized by an exploding plant, just crippled (all

There was also an article in one of the earlier White Dwarfs titled "The Self

    'body' => '	All the discussion about various game systems has led me to decide to try
to put down what I, as a fan of Traveller and a buyer of gaming products,
would like to see in the next edition of Traveller. It has been some time
since I have seen any of the materials for the proposed T 4.1/T5, so I am
operating on old info here, and this is also something of a wish list..

1. I would like to see T5 retain the character generation rules of T4 to a
large part. I liked the number of skills that characters got; it seemed
like the plan was to step back on that a bit in T5, and I would not like to
see that. I WOULD like to see two skills go completely away; Recon and Jack
of all Trades. In the former case, there are other skills that can be used
for this, such as Observation and Tracking. In the latter case, in a system
with few skills, such as CT, JOT was useful; in T4, more often than not, it
was superfluous. I see no point in having some skills be default skills,
and some not, and then giving characters a skill that helps with the
non-default rolls! and if it helps with any skills the characters don\'t
have, then it becomes a real problem, IMO. Oh...I\'d like to see the
Charisma stat restored, as it\'s useful and makes more sense than having
your ability to bluff a guard be based on your Social Standing...

2. I would like to see the practice of taking damage directly off the STR,
END and DEX of the character discontinued. I would prefer there to be a
calculated stat called Hits, based perhaps on 2x END +STR or 3x END, with
wound effects for reaching the 1/3, 2/3 levels, and then of course death at
0 Hits.

3. I believe that the MT task system should be returned to the game. It is
really not that complicated compared to a lot of games out there, and it
gives very good results. It also eliminates the need to roll anything
except 2d6, which, while I did not mind the half-die and the multiple dice,
IMO complicates the game more than the MT system would.

4. The combat system needs a bit of reworking. The one from MT is ok, but
ditching interrupts and introducing an Initiative roll and allowing people
to delay until later in the turn will eliminate the need for interrupts.
The system of armor used in T4 was ok, I would stick with that.

5. I would use a version of the QSDS, modified to fit the new task system
and expanded to allow ships of up to 500,000 tons for ship design. The
concept of the USP could be retained, although some things would need to be
altered to fit any new ship combat rules. It should definitley be kept
simple, IMO; I have more fun with QSDS and the ship design rules in GURPS
Traveller than I have ever had with any version of FF&S. I am not a
gearhead, and while there is nothing wrong with being one, the basic rules
should not be aimed at gearheads.

6. The rules should include equipment running the gamut from Mileau 0 to
the TNE era; they should be generic enough that they are not obviously
aimed at a specific mileau. Obviously every piece of equipment cannot be
included, but the basics shound range from TL 11 to TL 15.

7. Ship combat rules should be simple, hex-based, and tactical. A good
example is the RPSCS developed by Joseph Walsh and others. perhaps a
second, abstract High-Guard like system could be included for battles with
larger ships. I really did not like the system presented in T4, and would
like something that lets me push a counter around a hexgrid. Mayday-style
movement would be good.

8. ALIENS. Every other edition of Traveller has made you wait to play
aliens. This one should not. Racial data for the major races and capsule
descriptions of their societies; detailed data can come later, but a lot of
us know that data anyway, and my experience is that new players expect to
be able to play aliens. Withholding that info for a "supplement" does not
mean that players are going to play these aliens "right" anyway. So let us
be able to play them from the start.

9. A few pages devoted to the history and structure of the Imperium,
perhaps the map of Charted Space, and a map of the Core Subsector circa
year 0 and the Regina subsector circa 1100. Give the characters a little of
the setting right in the main book. Settings are important these days, and
games that don\'t include them just don\'t do as well, from what I have seen.

10. As regards the art; we do not need full color plates. I was far happier
with GURPS Traveller, which had all black-and-white illustrations, than I
ever was with the glitzy color used in IG\'s stuff. I don\'t dislike Chris
Foss as an artist; I just think it was an unneccesary expense. I would have
preferred to have the extra pages that those color plates NOT being there
could have bought.

This would be my dream version of Traveller, the one I would shell out $30
for in a softcover trade paperback format (say, the size of the TNE
rulebook) in a heartbeat. Or better yet, a hardcover..I payed $35 for LUG\'s
Star Trek game without batting an eye, because when I looked at it, I felt
it was worth it. I would love to do the same for Traveller.

I\'m still working off of a Rules-draft that didn\'t have the maps in it.  
Yeah, putting a map in without any sort of UPPs is a little broken.  But 
given the detail that\'s in Behind the Claw, I\'m not sure they could have 
done it justice without driving the page count and cost up a lot.

Hmm, maybe it is something local to your area, or just a batch of really 
bad players.  I\'ve run many GURPS games at cons (I used to run a lot of 
demos for SJ Games) and never ran into these problems.  Arguably, though, 
I do provide characters for my con games -- since my games tend to have 
fleshed out backgrounds for the game and characters, fitting in new 
characters for cons is just not viable.  I\'d do this regardless of the 
game system I\'m using.

I have no problems if bad players leave.  The trick is trying to turn 
them into good players, but if they aren\'t interested, I\'ll cull them 
from my games and find better players.

Bad players can happen in any game system -- I\'ve seen too many Traveller 
games with "gun bunnies" who were more concerned with getting Battle 
Dress and FGMP-15s than they were with actually roleplaying.  Random die 
mechanics for character generation didn\'t suddenly cure them of these 
tendencies.  But I\'m not about to lump every Traveller player into this 
category and start making blanket statements about those damn Traveller 
gun bunnies.  

It sounds like you\'ve run into some really bad players, and they have 
tarnished your viewpoint.  But lumping all GURPS players into that 
category is wrong.

Weird.  Maybe it is a recent change in the base of players.  But I\'m not 
sure there is anything specific in the GURPS mechanics that encourage 
this.  It can happen with any point-based system, and my experience with 
GURPS is that they patched most of the problems a while ago.

One thing I saw done with one rules-lawyer was that the GM simple never 
gave him any breaks on the die rolls.  The GM might fudge other dies 
rolls (if he didn\'t want to kill a character or had better ideas), but 
never with that player.

The key to getting good players is to get them into the roleplaying 
aspect of it. One way to do this is to actually roleplay out sections of 
the character\'s background as they are building the character.  Most 
Traveller characters go about four terms, so try this on for size:

Have the player make up a 50+disads character in GURPS.  During the first 
session, roleplay out the four terms the character went through.  You 
might have specific events in mind, or you mind just wing it.  
Essentially, throw them into the deep end and see how they react.  After 
each term, give the player 10 more points to play in.  After the last 
term, he gets 20 instead.  This gives a 100 point character and does a 
good job of rounding out the character.   Plus it might help you 
introduce NPCs into the game later down the line -- former shipmates, 
COs, whatever.

One benefit of this is that you can take advantage of the timeline.  I\'ve 
played all of the Traveller random-systems and none actually take into 
account the actual events going on in the universe.  While there are 
wartime events on the charts, they are pretty random.  In the case of a 
Spinward marches campaign, there was this small, unimportant called the 
5th Frontier War....and every player should have a good idea of where 
their character was and what they were doing when it broke out.  The 5FW 
is a good place to produce some interesting background events for the 
player characters.

And if you like random die rolls, for each term, just roll up the 
assignments for each of the years in the term (using your Traveller 
system of choice) and use these results to guide your roleplaying 
sessions.

The advantage of point-based systems is that if you have a clear idea of 
the type of character you want to play, you can get closer to that 
conception.  The downside is GMs may have to keep a closer eye on new 
players to make sure they actually interested in roleplaying as opposed 
to rules-lawyering.  Rules lawyering is not endemic to GURPS -- it pretty 
much was a staple of early Champions games, and it happens in any system.

The advantage of a random die-mechanic system is that it is more 
difficult for players to manipulate it (but not impossible), and that it 
can occasionally result in characters that wouldn\'t necessarily come up 
as someone\'s first attempt at a character.  For example, an NPC I rolled 
up once ended up as a Marquis who went 6 terms in the Navy (the last two 
mandatory!) and never actually received a commission --he left as a 
Senior Gunner\'s Mate.  In social settings, he often outranked his 
superiors.  The downside to random systems is that you can occasionally 
see characters that are seriously overpowered (they made every roll, so 
they have twice as many skills as the other characters) or the other 
side, a completely unviable character:  who wants to play a 1-term army 
private with a UPP of 334556 and Rifle-1? -- I\'ve seen it happen.  "What 
do you do?  I shoot things."  :D

From: That Computer Guy <darkstar@strauss.udel.edu>

: 1. I would like to see T5 retain the character generation rules of T4 to a
: large part. I liked the number of skills that characters got; it seemed
: like the plan was to step back on that a bit in T5, and I would not like to
: see that. I WOULD like to see two skills go completely away; Recon and Jack
: of all Trades. In the former case, there are other skills that can be used

I think that JOT should be kept.  It is the "Scout Skill."  It\'s also
the one skill that I like putting into other games I play.  It\'s the
idiot savant of skills that gives lucky players a break.  All it takes
is a half-decent GM to keep it from being abused.

: 2. I would like to see the practice of taking damage directly off the STR,
: END and DEX of the character discontinued. I would prefer there to be a
: calculated stat called Hits, based perhaps on 2x END +STR or 3x END, with
: wound effects for reaching the 1/3, 2/3 levels, and then of course death at
: 0 Hits.

Hmm...  This is an interesting idea.  Then again, I think that the whole
reason behind draining STR, END and DEX is to simulate "weakened"
characters.  This is a tough one to think about.

: 3. I believe that the MT task system should be returned to the game. It is

Here Here!!!  I also liked that fact that it put emphasis on skills and
not attributes.  I used to think it was a bear when I furst started
using it back in \'87.  However, after I got used to it, I found it quite
elegant and ahead of it\'s time.  Everyone else is now trying to or has
made a task system where you throw up a difficulty number and modify it
based on stat and skill.  Definitely ahead of it\'s time, and nowhere
difficult as people think it is.

: 4. The combat system needs a bit of reworking. The one from MT is ok, but
: ditching interrupts and introducing an Initiative roll and allowing people

Ditto.

: 5. I would use a version of the QSDS, modified to fit the new task system
        .
        .
        .
: and expanded to allow ships of up to 500,000 tons for ship design. The
: should not be aimed at gearheads.

Good call.  But as a gearhead I think that we may need to crank out
YAVOFFS (yet another version of fire fusion and steel).
Things I think should definitely be kept...
        1) under 100-ton j-capable ships during the TNE timeline
        2) alternate technologies (to flavor as you see fit)
        3) the same rules for land and space ships
        4) rules for CT and MT fuel usage (both had their pros and cons)

: 6. The rules should include equipment running the gamut from Mileau 0 to
: the TNE era; they should be generic enough that they are not obviously
: aimed at a specific mileau. Obviously every piece of equipment cannot be
: included, but the basics shound range from TL 11 to TL 15.

What about TL10 for the emerging societies.

: 7. Ship combat rules should be simple, hex-based, and tactical. A good

Yep.

: 8. ALIENS. Every other edition of Traveller has made you wait to play
: aliens. This one should not. Racial data for the major races and capsule

Yep again.

: 9. A few pages devoted to the history and structure of the Imperium,

Do like Heavy Gear did.  Enough about a small part to give you plenty of
detail to begin playing.  Teasers and background about the other parts.
Then make sure that your first supplement details and fleshes out the
rest of the setting (with other sourcebooks giving even more details on
specialized settings).  To a degree I think this is also what GDW was
trying to do with TNE.  Of course they never released the general "Atlas
of the Imperium Vol2" and they made us wait way too long for The Regency
Sourcebook.  But hey, those are gripes of the past and I\'m not bitter.
8)
 
: 10. As regards the art; we do not need full color plates. I was far happier
: with GURPS Traveller, which had all black-and-white illustrations, than I

And take a note for GURPS:Traveller.  Recycle some of the old Peters and
Caswell art.  That shit was good!

: This would be my dream version of Traveller, the one I would shell out $30

: rulebook) in a heartbeat. Or better yet, a hardcover..I payed $35 for LUG\'s
: Star Trek game without batting an eye, because when I looked at it, I felt
: it was worth it. I would love to do the same for Traveller.

Hardcover, no question about it.  Who doesn\'t pay the extra $5 for a
hardcover nowadays?

Hear, hear!  To me Traveller IS in the setting, hard SF and all...  If I
play Traveller using GURPS,  any of the four T-variants, or whatever, that
which makes it Traveller is the Imperium, its history, its infrastructure,
etc., and NOT the rules themselves.  Yes, I suppose one could run a game
using rules I\'d refuse to play, but the point is that, to me, the rules are
secondary to the mythos.

Why would someone pay millions of dollars for a golf club membership? Or
the fees for a rather exclusive club? This moves the TAS into the position
of being a very exclusive club. The \'free\' tickets are more of an
incidental benefit than anything else, along with excellent food, lodging,

Your average player will only become a member through being granted a life
membership as a reward for service. As this is a _big_ reward, better have
them make up a suitably heroic deed - and then hold them to that
reputation!


This makes at least as much sense as having the TAS be able to afford to
keep giving away tickets for years after your membership money has run
out. I\'ll probably use this idea in my MT/TNE universe.

Off topic Rant

<Rant>
I reserve a special loathing for people who dump surplus puppies and kittens
in the country, in the misguided belief that they will be "adopted" by some
kind-hearted rural family. What usually happens is they get run over by a car
in short order, or (worse) they end up lunch for a fox or coyote. Those that
do not lead a hellish (and short) life as part of the country food chain. In
illinois, it is sometimes necessary for farmers to get together and have
"drives" where they go out, mongol hunt fashion and shoot avery wild dog they
see (it was the custom where I grew up not to touch foxes during these drives
- -- they were not viewed as a threat to livestock, but a form of vermin
control).

College students are particularly prone to dump pets -- I lived in a
"campustown" area for over a decade, and then spent another decade living near
one: at the end of every semester, a dozen or so puppies/kittens could be seen
wandering near the off-campus residences, rumaging in the garbage and
obviously abandoned. Marc Miller used to be heavily involved with a local
animal shelter (and as far as I know still is), and is familiar with the
phenomenon. 

Myself, I am not an animal lover (I don\'t own any, don\'t want to) but I am
opposed to mindless cruelty. If you don\'t want the responsibility of a pet, or
don\'t want the hassle of taking them home over semester break, for gawd\'s sake
have the decency to take them to the local animal shelter. Or kill them
quickly with a tire iron. Or maybe, consider not getting one in the first
place?

Sorry -- one of my buttons got pressed.

And lets not forget that excellant database about individual planetary
conditions (the one they use to give amber and red zone warnings).  And
the Traveller News Network.

Plus, I have always made them a sort of safehouse type arrangement - go
here to avoid annoying customs and local laws (and to find out about them
- - first stop in every starport).  And job listings - in my universe,
people are more likely to hire travelleres with TAS membership than not -
they knew that they are likely to be more trustworthy and easier to track
down.

Oh yeah.  And its really annoying when the local office "asks" the players

It\'s GURPS, Jim - use GURPS Space world creation rules.  The conversions on
GT107 and 123 should let you port in whatever Traveller material you have,
but GURPS Space is the standard (except for some confusion on terminology -
starport classes and such).

Equipment per VE2, UT, or UT2; creatures per the Basic Set, Bestiary or
Alien Bestiary.  The rules on tech in GT should be sufficient to figure out
what does and does not work in the GT universe.  Creatures can be created
by analogy with Terran models ("the size of a horse, but carnivorous").

The intent, as I understand it, was to not reproduce material in GURPS
Space, including world and campaign building.

This is what did too... CT with the task resolution system posted in

I still consider it CT, though...

And I was trying to calm things down. Oh well. To me Traveller is neither 
strictly rules or background. My Greater Magellanic Clouds campaign doesn\'t 
use the Traveller background, does that mean its not Traveller, of course not, 
nor any of the countless other "grow your own" games out there. Now if I 
(heaven forbide) was to take my homegrown setting and convert it over to 
GURPS:Traveller, is it still Traveller? I think it would be. I have neither setting 
nor rules, but what I do still have is the basic assumptions (speed of commo 
equals speed of travel, 2d starmaps, planetary autonomy, one week per jump, 
hard(ish) science background etc.). To me its these fundimental assumptions 
that go to makeup the distinctive \'feel\' of Traveller, its essence if you will. Now I 
happen to think that two of these basic assumptions are TAS membership is 
for life and all characters are not created equal; and that GURPS:Traveller does 
not reflect these well (maybe, I\'m still hoping the TAS thing is a simple error). 
So what, this is only MHO, so what should I do? If I want to play G:T I should 
come up with my own house rules, and if I do play G:T thats what I will do (I\'ve 
never been a slave to any rules set).

Well, no, if you have a copy of Dark Star #1 (they\'re still available in
electronic format through www.hyperbooks.com, but you have to ask Terry for them
directly by name as they aren\'t listed), then you have T4 character generation
redone as a point purchase system within the parameters of a career/template
structure plus a few other "improvements". This was done (and it is simply the
most recent of my variants, let alone ghu knows how many other Traveller GMs)
that allows flexibility within the *framework* laid out by the Career structure.

Personally, FWIW, I find having game designated character traits a pain. And
unrealistic. In my games, yes, you *can* have one arm or be missing an eye, but
it gains you *NO* extra skills.

Does anyone other than me see it as being unrealistic that the most powerful
characters in a GURPS/CORPS game are those that are the most hamstrung by
character or physical flaws?

Is it a law of nature that the only way a 30 (or 40) year old can learn anything
is by losing limbs or gaining inimical enemies? I don\'t think so.

In Armageddon (see my .sig), there is a point based generation system based on a
career structure like Traveller, and there is also the chance of having
*mishaps* which range from the minor to the moderately nasty. However, mishaps
do *NOT* generally gain any points or extra skills.

So, for example, it is quite possible to reach age 40 and have a good skill base
without a single enemy or physical drawback. This is generally impossible in
games like GURPS or CORPS (and I *really* like CORPS, having done playtesting
for BTRC over the years) *unless* you allow the characters to have a higher than
normal point base.

So, the suggestions that have been bandied around for allowing extra points for
each term should probably be allowed ... and encouraged.

And, perhaps, a 125 point base should be adopted, assuming a one term character
(i.e. age 22). Perhaps with 8+2d points per term (or 4+1d, take your pick) after
the first. These may come with set advantages or disadvantages that cost no
points, effectively. For example, a Scout probably should get an automatic
Patron advantage, especially if they have a Scout *ship* and so on.

>There is an easy solution for the rules-rapist who takes "one-hand" as a

Or, even better, you simply say, "fine ... yes, a one armed, crippled, one eyed
ex-marine with the entire universe hunting him on a 9- is OK ... but there\'re no
points in it". See how many you get.

So? This is where the influence bit comes in. Traveller starship captains
probably fall all over themselves to carry TAS customers, and discount the
ticket as a result. Why? Because its good business ... and, I suspect, they
probably get free or cut-rate use of the TNS and System Database as a result.

And this is generally what has been the assumed case previously. Though it is
quite *specific* in stating that the 1 MCr entry fee allows only a *chance* of
entry ... and a chance of being blackballed.

Yes. T4 character generation rules are OK. However, a semi point-based system
(its easy enough to do, *I* did in "Dark Star #1") would be better.

Don\'t care one way or another about Recon. JoT is, however, an integral part of
Traveller. Don\'t *ever* even *think* about doing away with it!

Agree about Charisma

Agree wholeheartedly.

Well, here we *really* part company. If the T5 system used anything even vaguely
like the MTrav Task System I would never *EVER* buy it. NEVER. I *loathed*
MTrav. And I don\'t think I\'m necessarily in a minority of one, either.

I would suggest that this fierce partisanship was at least part of the reason
why T4 was more like CTrav than MTrav or TNE.

In short, I think that there is the potential to lose too many customers by
going back to something that has for some (and I would say, based on anecdotal
evidence, *many*) such unpleasant memories.

A phase based system would be much better. Probably with combat trained
characters getting a slight advantage, and certainly with some sort of random
factor thrown in to make sure minimaxers don\'t simply choose their
characteristics to ensure they act on the first possible Phase.

QSDS and anything based on FF&S should be avoided at all costs. OK, there are a
*lot* of gearheads on this list, but not *one* in the group of gamers I know.
Perhaps we are in a minority, I don\'t know ... but I would suggest that this
list is just as likely to be unrepresentative of reality in this particular area
as my circle of gaming acquaintances *might* be.

We all use CTrav/High Guard or homebrew variations. None of us use MTrav or TNE.
Not one.

I *LOATHE* ... no, that\'s too kind and gentle a word ... I think Foss is an
untalented clot who couldn\'t draw his way out of a wet paper bag with a map,
compass, a GCA controller.

I bought T4 *DESPITE* Foss.

I agree that Gurps Traveller has much better art! And I agree that colour is
*not* necessary ... however, look at the cover art for "Behind the Claw" on the
GURPS site! Its pretty damn good!

They aren\'t "quite" wolves. And the idea is that they are *individuals*
with multiple bodies. Each body contributes to the personality as well
as to everything else. So individuals aren\'t *quite* immortal. Kill the
right body and the "person" will undergo a major change when the
replacement is added.

They make *nasty* fighter pilots, because you have an entire
squadron(?) that *literally* co-ordinates as well as the fingers on a
hand! 

They *are* vulnerable to jamming their comm links (they require *high*
bandwidth audio links to maintain the "link". But since they need to
run spread spectrum *anyway*, they aren\'t terribly vulnerable to this.

The tines alsao show up in one other story by Vinge. It\'s set on a
planet just inside the slow zone.

Tines *would* be a neat addition to Traveller. And a Tine/Hiver
alliance would be scary. The Hivers might be able to talk the Tines
into "designing" individuals again. 

That "harmless" ambassador and his staff (possibly as many as a dozen
"persons") may be able to rearrange into a crack espionage or combat
team simply by reconfiguring their comm links. 

Luckily, it takes *very* unusual circumstances to be able to handle
that sort of multiple personality. And Tines would find it distasteful
for reasons obvious to anyone who has read "A Fire Upon the Deep". 

Tine character generation would be interesting. I\'d say that you
generate UPPs for each body, with some extra "mental" characteristics.
And you have rules for how to combine the "mental" characteristics into
that of the "person". 

Adding and losing bodies would affect the person, as would damage to
bodies.

Wolves aren\'t *that* big. A lot of folks figured she was some sort of

Alas, Tasha is no more, she was pretty old and her arthritis got bad enough
that she had to put to sleep. :-(

And considering that several of us were willing to "play" (wrestle,
etc) with her, she got to win fairly often. It helps to know how to say
"I give" in wolf (lay on your back throat exposed). 

Mostly she was careful in the friendly matches. I have a scar on my arm
from one of her toenails, but I consider that *my* fault. (And I\'m not
gonna answer any questions about what happens when the moon is full! :-)

I suspect that humans would "get it" quickly enough. Getting knocked to
the deck, and having bared teeth at your throat tends to get the
message across. 

And it\'s not as if humans *don\'t* play dominance games inside small
groups. We *do* have alphas and pecking orders. We just tryt to pretend
we don\'t.

And, IMHO, I just don\'t see that membership in the TAS is worth Cr
904,000 per year net (i.e., after collecting your Cr 96,000 worth of
middle passages referred to on page 35 of G:T).  That\'s (give or take a
bit) the equivalent of three months payment per year on a Type-A Free
Trader.

I get the mental image of the TAS board considering a member\'s
application, and someone saying, "You know, this sophont isn\'t all
_that_ qualified, when you consider that we\'re running a Cr 400,000
deficit at the branch at which he/she/it applied...."  Presto! 
Blackballed due to fiscal constraints on the TAS, and your MCr 1 fee is,
sadly, an application fee, and not refundable.

Fine.  However, a newer organization with similar goals and benefits
(say, "The Imperial Travellerati") could offer similar benefits for less
(less prestige, but less cash needed).  In other words, if you don\'t
like the MCr 1 per year of G:T\'s TAS, keep the TAS as described, but
introduce a competitor.  Nothing non-canon about new companies....

No, use Albedo instead. That gives you the warlike "bunnies", but also
other "animals". And the history up thru the last issue I read (several
years back) *would* fit some weirdness on Grandfather\'s part.

Here\'s a quickie for GURPS, CT, MT and TNE. I don\'t know enough about T4\'s
(besides I\'m too lazy to do it right now - maybe later)

Target Number			Modifier
GURPS	CT	MT		GURPS	TNE
3				+8	-4
4	12+	2-		+6	-3
5				+4	-2 (Easy)
6	11+	3-		+2	-1 (Average)
7	10+	4-		+0	+0 (Difficult)
8	9+	5-		-2	+1 (Formidible)
9				-4	+2 (Impossible)
10	8+	6-		-6	+3
11	7+	7-		-8	+4
12	6+	8-		
13	5+	9-		
14	4+	10-		
15				
16+	3+	11-		

The TNE - GURPS table assumes that the GURPS skill levels will lie in a
similar range to TNE assets. If this is not the case, then the penalties
should probably be about 50% bigger (-4 becomes -6).

BTW I noticed a while back (when TNE came out in fact) that on a 3d6 system
like GURPS (or Hero) +/-2 either halves your chance of success, or halves
your chance of failure (roughly speaking), depending on which is under 50%.
This means that as long as you don\'t let skill levels in GURPS get over 16
too often you can treat a +/-2 as being the same as a +/-diff mod from TNE.

As fas as I\'m concerned this is all purely theoretical, as the one time I
contemplated using GRUPS to run a Sci-fi game I decided that by the time
I\'d fixed everything I don\'t like about GURPS as a Sci-fi game I would\'ve
been better spending the time writing stuff for another system (say TNE :)

Albedo would probably give a more playable background, but "Bunnies &
Burrows" is already GURPS, while Albedo is, AFAIK, not.

If you want a _deeply unpleasant_ GURPS sourcebook for a Traveller
crossover, try either "CthulhuPunk" or "War Against the Chtorr" for some
_serious_ PC nightmares....

(BTW, so far as the title of this e-mail thread is concerned, I\'m
_already_ playing in what could be considered a Traveller/Illuminati
crossover, with two of my three PCs having been recruited into a Knights
Templar successor organization.)

An 8% rate of return is approximatly double the rate paid on standard
starship mortgages. If you assume a basic rate of interest of 2%, plus a
risk premium of 2% for lending on starships (misjumps if nothing else add a
risk premium), then you get a rock solid investment in a TAS membership
earning four times the basic rate of interest.

And if I remember correctly, if you do get blackballed, they give you your
megacredit back. It is still an incredibly high rate of return on your
investment. This does *not* make economic sense.

It isnt not-canon either. I dare say the entirety of canon dealing with TAS
would be about four A4 sheets, once you take out duplication of common
knowledge. I would argue there is plenty of grey areas that referees can
exploit.

Heck, maybe \'associate TAS membership\' is a local variation - a mere letter
of introduction from your local TAS manager, which may or may not be
accepted by any other TAS office.

*shrug* As far as economics goes, Traveller canon has some major issues.

I disagree here, the MT combat system is one thing that I have discarded
and would like to keep it that way.  I used a variant of striker for my
combat system.

I agree with 1. (T4 CharGen) and 3. (MT task system)

these items will HAVE to be based on the new version of FF&S and the
ship combat system so that we don\'t end up with the same problem as
QSDS.

I agree with 6. (equipment)

Mayday-style

there is a good ship combat system being worked on by Bruce M. that we
hope will be ready and accepted as part of the basic T5

8. (Aliens)  I agree, there should be one page discriptions and mods for
Imperialized aliens (i.e. those that grew up in the Imperium) Add on
Alien modules would then go deeper into the culture and extra-imperial
CharGen.

Ok...I can deal with that. Myself, I had no problems with it, but something
else could be done, as long as it:
	1.) Used 2d6 (or maybe 3d6) only
	2.) Was based on fixed levels of difficulty, with a target number
associated with it. Ideally you roll a certain number on 2d6 and have
modifiers that apply to the target number OR to the overall difficulty
level in perhaps a stat + skill + roll method, although of course some will
argue about the influence of stats..maybe an aptitude number for each stat
of say STAT/5. This is somewhat LIKE the MT system, but you could write it
out clearer and simplify the process considerably. So it would be Aptitude
+ Skill + Die roll to equal or beat a certain number.

I didn\'t say FF&S should be used, but there are certain things, like
sensors, that are not accounted for in High Guard. Add those and do HG
versions of some of the options that HAVE been created, and I would have no
problem with High Guard ship construction. But see below for my comments
about space combat...

I really don\'t like High Guard ship combat...WAY too abstract. Whatever
else came out of TNE, Brilliant Lances was a great ship combat game. RPSCS
is a great "simplified" game that allows for tactical combat without
bogging down. This is what I would like to see.

Some of these people my be like me and refuse to or are unable to play
most disadvantages.  Therefore most of my characters have simular sets
of disadvantages in games that have such.  BTW, I seldom play games with
a point system, prefering Traveler(mod MT, TNE, or T4) or RQ

	A single, simple, 384-bit key has been broken ...

	That\'s pretty meaningless--the security of PGP doesn\'t lie in a
"secret" algorithm. In fact, it\'s considered secure BECAUSE the
algorithms are publicly known, and have been analyzed and attacked by
a wide variety of experts who have brought different viewpoints to
bear.

	Actually, the encryption methods used in PGP are considered to be
fairly resistant to "known-plaintext" attacks. Furthermore, PGP
generates a new message key for each message.

	Nope. You can take a plaintext and cryptotext message, and it gives
you almost no insight into the public/private keypair. At MOST you
might figure out the session key--which is discarded and generated
anew for each message.

	Mind you, I have *never* maintained (except as a matter of
hyperbole) that any transponder system was foolproof/tamperproof. But
just because it isn\'t doesn\'t make it worthless. Airbags aren\'t
foolproof ... but quite a few people are alive today because of a
flawed system. It\'s your Traveller universe, you choose. The OFFICIAL
universe has as a part of the background a near-tamperproof system of
identifying ships, like it or lump it. In your universe, you make the
background assumptions you need to justify how you want it to work.
Do you want every Tom, Dick and Harry to be able to forge impeccable
credentials? Or do you want your players to really have to work for
everything. *I* can very easily justify a strong system. If a player
wanted to try to break it, they\'re free to do so ... but the odds are
low. Not nil, low. 

	I like to make them work for everything. No "hack\'n\'slash" in space,
they\'d better think things through and be prepared for the
consequences. It also opens up MORE gaming possibilities.
Transponders are "black boxes" built at TL 15 (or maybe 16 ...) at
select locations throughout the Imperium, and shipped "blank" to
various shipyards for installation and imprinting. Gee, can anybody
think of some fun adventure ideas there?

	Why encrypt anything if you don\'t have something to hide? Why seal

committing a crime, so they KNOW something is up when encrypted
messages start coming from you.

	Except that he stands out like a sore thumb anytime he enters
"normal" space. The mute switch is ONLY intended to be used in
emergency or hostile situations ... Try approaching the US Airspace
Defense Identification Zone without an active transponder or radio
response and see what it gets you (how close do you like being to
interceptors ... hint: an F-16 waggling his wings means "Follow me to
the nearest base where we\'re going to have a long talk, or my wingman
behind you will get to paint a silhouette on his side"). Try flying
through any controlled airspace without a transponder. 

	For that matter, try driving around town with no license plate on
your car. Or even just one with an expired registration sticker (from
experience ... fortunately, the current sticker was in my glovebox).
The cops may take a while to notice (6 months, in my case), but then
there\'s no automated system to automatically query every car for
registration.

In

	Which is why military transponders have additional settings--you can
simply ID yourself as a valid IN ship without giving your identity
away (hence making it difficult to do exact tracking from system to
system). As for insystem tracking ... I\'ll simply defer to the sensor
gurus.

skip out on loans, etc.? Having a higher level of security is
BENEFICIAL to free flow of trade ...

  Actually, the rules on telepathic (presumably) central direction for fighter
pilots in Traveller (A:4) aren\'t terribly generous, and still difficult to
justify even for Zho pilots who could all be telepathic themselves (ship tactics
levels for the controller are conveyed as tactical skill to each of the pilots.)

Wow - this is getting WAY too philosophical!  I agree and stand corrected.
I tend to focus on the mythos, but I guess there IS a basic rules-feel -

[sny-ip!]

Whew! And I thought I was the only one in the world that liked the
Rebellion! IMO, the best thing about the 3rd Imperium was the way it fell
apart (from my standpoint as a referee). Of course, MegaTraveller was my
first real exposure to the "official" Traveller setting, so there is a
heapin\' helping of the first-love syndrome there.

I sure wished they could have come up with a better way than Virus to end it
though. *That* seemed to me to be one big cop-out. I would much preferred to
have a Hard Times-style slow burnout and another Long Night. It seems to me
that you could get rid of Virus completely and have virtually the same
intersteller situation as presented in TNE by just using a Hard Times-esque
collapse. Replace vampire ships with ruthless TED raider fleets, and
thereyago.

Hated HEPLARs though ...

Oh, and for those taking surveys:

I\'ll buy all the G:T stuff. I\'ll read it for fun, and probably never use it
except as background material (Rebellion Forever!!! :-)

I used to like GURPS, but I use FUDGE for everything now. I just had too
many albino, one-eyed, lame midgets in my games (or the ever-famous
"military brat" with a 14 IQ and 1/2 point in 80 skills). Plus I hate
dealing with big \'ol numbers during gameplay ... "Okay, so you rolled 6d6
and got 22. Multiply that by 500, then subtract the 2,450 DR of the target
(after applying the armor divisor of (10). Now roll for location ... blah
blah blah."

Currently I\'m not even running Traveller, although I did recently find copy
of DGPs _World Builder\'s Handbook_ for $1.95 and wept for joy like a little
girl while doing a little dance, so I guess I\'m still part of the club (or m
aybe I\'m just weird).

Just for the record, I\'ve always liked the skills in Traveller, and JOT is unique to
Traveller.  I don\'t want to see it go away any more than I want Traveller to use
anything else other than six sided dice.

I remember when I was a freshman in college.  I spyed a girl with a sheet of paper in
front of my in micro-economics.  On the sheet, I saw some statistics.

Then, I noticed that one of the stats read:  JOT-2

So, I leaned up over her shoulder, not knowing this girl from Adam, saying, "So, you
play Traveller?"

I\'m a romanitc.  I want the old Traveller.  I think T4 principles can be applied to
CT design philosophy to make the best Traveller system ever.  We just haven\'t seen
that animal yet.

Bite you tongue!  Traveller\'s use of this is genius.  With one stat, you not only
damage a character, but you reduce his ability to act with his skills.

This is much better than a two step process where you have another stat, like D&D\'s
hit points, that you have to monitor, then take negatives from as you loose hit
points.

Traveller does it all in one, swift, incredible move.

Keep this.


> 3. I believe that the MT task system should be returned to the game. I

Again, the MT task system is a good one.  I\'ve always liked it, but T4\'s was better
(mechanic-wise, although they\'ve got to fix the bugs--which can be fixed easily).

I agree with the interrupt part.  I never liked, completely understood, or used them
when I used MT.

T4\'s armor system was the best I\'ve seen in any Traveller edition.

I have no opinion here.

I agree.

I agree.

RPSCS is a good system, although it could use some polishing.

I agree, but I, like Allen, would like a tactical system.

I think aliens are integral to Traveller, and I\'d like to see a lot more than what
we\'ve seen in the past.  But, I have no problem with the main rule book omitting
aliens, or just giving a page or two to the major races.  Aliens in Traveller have
always been detailed, and I would like to see supplemants supporting them.

The room in the main rule book can be used better on other topics.

I like big, glossy, full color art.  From what I\'ve seen from other game companies,
the price stays the same anyway.  I\'d like to see a Traveller main book look as good
as the one for Star Wars Revised & Expanded or the new Star Trek:  The Next
Generation game.

I bring home these books, and I like the production value.  It\'s almost the year
2000.  We\'ve grown way past the time when three little black pamphlets, stapled,
folded, with no art will suffice.

Let\'s create something that we can all be proud of.

Besides, the sexy books attracts others--that\'s my belief.

Again, I\'d like to see a Traveller book that looks as good as the new Star Trek game.

Game mechanics count too.

Quite possibly. My friend Peter Newman, also on this list) tends to be a
rules lawyer in any game, is a hard-core GURPS proponent, and tends to be
mild compared to all the alaskan GURPS players I know. Fortunately, Peter
seems to be that 1 in 10 of the GURPS crowd I\'ve met not heavily into
"Cloned Characters". I\'ve run GURPS for some 25 different players in the
past (counts on fingers and toes) 12 years or so, and dealt with another 25
GURPS players, of them, only 5 made any positive impressions upon me wrt
GURPS.

It may have something to do with the fact that Alaska as a whole, and
anchorage in specific, tends to have a fairly large gamer segment in the
population, by comparison to other west coast areas.

Hell, I *LIKE* the GURPS mechanics.... but the people who tend toward
playing gurps, at least up here, I won\'t game with.

Just out of curiosity...what is is about MT that so violently turns your

been fixed w/ errata, I think it holds a lot of CT in it, but also added a lot
of little details that CT didn\'t have. (My personal favorite:  Sensors...this
finally gave PCs w/ Sensor Ops skill something to do, and added a bit of
tactical flavor to what is otherwise High Guard).  The MT task system is
really not all that different from T4, w/ the exception of the attribute being
added (I think the MT divide stat by 5 to add to skill works well too).  I\'m
not trying to provoke a fight here...I\'m just curious, since you seem to be
rabidly opposed to the system.

Tines aren\'t \'linked up\' just for minutes at a time, they\'re linked up as long 
as they\'re intelligent.  It\'s *ONE* mind shared between 4 to 8 bodies in close 
quarters, with thoughs supported by ultrasonic networking.  There\'s no

  Yes, but that\'s the closest analogue in Trav. Besides, they\'re monumentally
screwed by significant time-lags (they\'re helped to use radio in the book,
IIRC), eliminating the flexibility of large volume coverage. They might
simply make
better gunship crews (or ground combat units).

  <snicker> But seriously, there\'s a lot more in G:T than Books 1-3 (or 0-3)
had, and much more in BTC than S:3. IIRC, there\'s something like 43 LBB\'s or
so, counting Supps and Adventures, plus the modules, campaigns, etc.

  While just G:T and GURPS: Lite is probably too lean, it would still offer 
at least as much as Books 0-5 and the first few supplements.

But if I recall right, G:T also needs ("recommends") the Character Compendium,
GURPS Space, Ultra-Tech 1&2, and Vehicles also.  I am a little old-fashioned;
when I buy a game, I hope it has everything in it to play the game.  I can get
by w/ just GURPS Basic and G: T...but only because I have 14+ years of other
info to fall back on:  a player completely new to Trav would not have this
benefit.

Hmm...I don\'t know.  I have never had to have PC make more than one roll for a
task, unless he failed and was allowed to re-try it...nor can I ever recall a
PC being offed by a fatal (or even fateful) task.  Thats not to say they were
not put into a potentially fatal situation by failing a task :-)

You may be confusing a "fateful" task with the word fatal...all a fateful task
is is a task with some possibility of something bad happening if you fail at
it; it in no way means if you fail, you die (necessarily...if you are trying
to grab a rope as you go over a cliff and fail, well...)

  Which brings up the point that the somewhat impractical but much-cited
pirate "tactic" of sitting at a starport and monitoring traffic will be
easily mistaken for the activities of a foreign intelligence ship if done
in a starship.

  In any event much strategic info about foreign civilian traffic flows can
be determined from public information, pretty much by definition.

I do have one possibly useful idea about including aliens.

As a professional rpg writer, I realize that games need supplements to 
sell.  However, having aliens in the Traveller main book sounds both more 
fun and like it would make for a richer game.

So:  Include aliens in Imperial culture in the main book.  You would have 
stats, some note on different senses, important biological & cultural 
differences, and let them use the exact same tables for generating 
Imperial characters as everyone else.  I\'d go with Aslan, Vargr, a few 
human minor races, Vegans, Virushi, and maybe one or two more.  All of these
races should one with cultural groups which have been fully assimilated 
into the Imperium.    

Then you publish the alien books, which cover places like the Aslan 
Hierate, Vargr territories, as well as the Zhodani Consolate, and Hiver & 
K\'Kree space.  Then throw in another book with Darrians, Droyne, and 
other small semi-independent groups, and you\'re set.

The LBB set of 3 was sold as *ONE* package.  To play G:T, you need at *LEAST* 
2 purchases: Gurps core rules *and* G:T.  You need the core rules for 
*everything*, G:T is just a background supplement, from what I\'ve heard.  And 
to do anything that\'s not in BTC, you\'ll need G:Space of course, the 
G:Vehicles thingie, and a couple more to round things out.  You\'re looking at 
no less than 40 bucks minimum, maybe as much as 2-300 all tricked out.  G:T is 
*NOT* playable by itself.  The LBB\'s *were*.

I read that story.  Can\'t remember what the name of it was, though.  I thought 
the girl trying to win a cultural history contest by having a \'persona\' of a 
cheerleader/courtesan was rather cute...

OTOT, IMTU, there\'s still a planet or 3 in the Solomani Rim that dates things 
according to when they tortured the Christ Gang (Elvis, JFK, and Karl Marx) 54 
centuries ago.  <grin>

I don\'t see the Tines giving up brood kennelling.  Giving up Flenserism, yeah, 
but not brood kennelling.

It wouldn\'t be a multiple personality.  It\'d be a *different* personality 
entirely.

Generate the intelectual stuff first:  INT & EDU.  If they\'re from Tinesworld, 
EDU can\'t be over 4.  The number of members would be dependant on INT; INT 4- 
would be impossible; INT 5 would be 4 members; 6 thru 8, 5 members; 9 thru B, 
6 members; C+, 7 members.  Then generate  the STR, DEX, & END of each member.  
STR would be 1D6+2, DEX would be the same, and END would be 2D6-2.  Combat 
damage would be against an individual member; when a pack has a member killed 
or knocked out, roll INT or more on 2D6 to keep from breaking apart.

See above.  An intelligent Tine is impossible with less than 4 members.

Nor would they have the necessary world generation system to generate homebrew
sectors.  Planetary and system generation rules are in G:Space.  As is, G:T
isn\'t standalone even with the core rules.  The LBB\'s *were*.

Downside is, since they have no manipulators other than their mouths, they\'d 
have to have either voice-controlled ships or joysticks they can move around 
with their mouths.

They only run spread spectrum in the audio frequencies.  You\'d have to assign
seperate wideband channels for each individual pack as well as an interpack
wideband channel.  Remember, they *talk* in wideband too.

From what I have read (ten years ago) about fusion reactors, I recall that
although the fusing plasma is very hot, there is not very much of it, and
it is relatively sparse. In other words, it does not contain much heat, so
when it splashes on the cavity walls, they don\'t warm very much. 

Somebody more enlightened in the matter could perhaps correct, if I am
wrong.

Nope, no world gen (book 3). As it stands I \'d say you need at least three 
books to run G:T "properly": GURPS basic, G:T and Space or BTC  (total cost 
$67.85). To run T4 "properly" (I\'m politely ignoring IG\'s stuff ups) you needed 
two books: Basic rules and M:0 (total cost $47.95). However you only need 
Space or BTC due to the lack of a world gen sequence. Now I can see a few 
_very_ simple ways in which SJG could solve this "problem" if they wanted.

a) They could produce a striped down lite version of the world gen in Space and 
distribute it as part of GURPS lite.

b) they could publish the basic data for one subsector (say Regina).

c) they could simply establish a link on their Traveller webpage to Jim 
Vassilakos Galatic 2.4 (or even better mirror it on their own ftp site) and allow 
new players to convert the ample data there. Me I\'d go for option c.

Well, leaving out the game system (I have printing #1 ... i.e. the bug-ridden
one) in areas other than the Task System ...

I found the whole idea of the Task system counter-intuitive. I found it unweildy
to describe and use. I found that it did nothing to improve on the CTrav system.
I\'d never liked it in the Digest Group magazines, and couldn\'t see why they
needed to add it to a Traveller game system that worked perfectly well.

Something *like* MTrav was needed ... I mean, a new, improved, expanded rule
system. However, I have always been of the "if it ain\'t broke, don\'t fix it"
school of game design ... CTrav worked, from task resolution through to ship
design ... MTrav didn\'t.

>of little details that CT didn\'t have. (My personal favorite:  Sensors...this

Personally, the Sensor rules were, IMHO, another turn-off. I *preferred* the
approach of High Guard. I don\'t *want* a gearhead style approach. I dont see
complexity of vehicle design = great design system. I didn\'t like the MTrav
vehicle design rules, I liked FF&S even less (and, yes, I have them both), and I
was truly disappointed with T4 using FF&S.

I liked the GURPS Vehicles system because it was so easy to use. I dislike GV2
for the same reasons I disliked MTrav and TNE ... I don\'t want to have to have a
Spreadsheet program *AND* write a damn spreadsheet for the design system to
design ships. I want to be able to go 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - N step by step.

All this 1 - 2 er, you need the results from 11 (which you can\'t work out until
you have 1-10) - 3 er, you need the results from 7 (which you can\'t work out
unless you have 1-6) - 4 etc. garbage is, well, garbage.

Sure. Gearheads love it. I like designing things as much as the next guy, but,
hey, lets get real here, we\'re not designing something that *is* real. We\'re
designing things based on thinly disguised bullshit. So there is NO EXCUSE
WHATSOEVER for having a system as user unfriendly as MTrav/FF&S or GV2. None.

Personally, I will use either GV1 or CORPS VDS ... talking of which! VDS offers
all the complexity that a gearhead could possibly want, but is usable with a
linear design sequence, unlike all the others mentioned.

Even better would be something like RTG\'s "Maximum Metal" which allows you to
*modify* existing designs, but not create new ones ... that would do for most
people, and something like VDS would work for the true gearheads.

FF&S and MTrav and GV2 are simply a waste of time.

Yup.

GURPS is not my first system of choice; I use it usually when everyone who
is playing hates all of my normal systems (CORPS, FUZION, FUDGE) enough
for it to make the difference between playing and not playing.

But I\'ve got damn close to a shelf full of GURPS material; almost every SF
product they\'ve released, Martial Arts, Magic, Grimoire, Wizards, etc...
and a lot of their placebooks (GURPS:Egypt, etc.)

Because one thing SJG (more importantly, their writers) *always* do is to
do their homework. If something is in a book, I\'m pretty certain I can use
it as a second-hand cite (and have, after checking on the originals in a
couple of cases).

And the 3-18 system isn\'t hard to convert to other systems; they even give
you a convenient %of success chart in the basic book.

I would say that it depends entirely on what your campaign is about, and
what kind of influence/powers you want the players to have access to.

For example, if you want one (or more) Psi-capable characters, I\'d advise
a slightly higher starting point cost; 100+40+5 will build a valid Psi
character, but they will be dangerously short on more mundane abilities
(which is not in keeping with Traveller; PSI has always been a
"congratulations, you\'re a Psi-active person, rather than "too bad you
spent so much time concentrating on your psi abilities that you can\'t cook
ramen noodles...." This is psionics, not Magery).

Similarly, if you are running a Navy or Marines game, basing on more than
100 might be a good idea; GURPS:Special Ops suggests 300+disads, with no
more than 100 spent on stats. And given the nature of the Imperial Navy, I
can eassily see players spending a lot of points for Patrons, Allies, and
Contacts, just to give their characters the kind of "web of influence" you
need to survive as a Navy Officer for any period of time.

Keep in mind that 100pts is a *base*. More points does not equal a
munchkin character, or even an out of balance game. It does mean that you
have to go over character sheets a little more carefully, but it\'s not
that hard, and can result in characters that are a little more
interesting.

>Keep in mind that gurps has a limit on points spent on skills: 2*age. so,
>that said, keep in mind that most characters using the templates will be

>and quirks. For reference, Lensmen start at around 500-1000 points, and

OTOH, GURPS:Uplift suggests 125 or so for even mundane folks, and
Terragens agents get up to 400 or so (I don\'t have the book in front of
me). And GURPS:Martial Arts and GURPS:Cyberpunk both suggest characters in
the 150-250 point range as starting characters. 

For GMs who have never run GURPS before, I might suggest 125 points or so
for your average starting Traveller, with no more than 80 points in stats,
and a GM ready to say *no*. But for those experience in the art of GURPS,
150-200 would allow for the average ex-Navy Commander, Marine Majors, etc.

Say rather that I consider the rules to be the tools that the designers
use to create the universe they wish to reflect.  Obviously each word in
the rules means just what it says (no more and no less) and the
designers intended for you to use the rules as written.  Therefore any
"loop hole" in the rules was deliberately put there by the designers to
specifically allow the players to use it.  If the DM differs they (of
course) have the right to change the rule or interpret it differently
than I do _but_ it is rather bad form to call someone a "rules lawyer"
merely because they are attempting to use the rules created by the games
designer in a way which will benefit their charecter.

One of the things that I like about GURPS is the Advantages &
Disadvantages.  I think that they are an excellent hook for role
playing.  Good role players will give their charecters personalities
whether or not they get points for doing so.  Many role players need a
bit of encouragement to give their charecters personality.  Giving
charecter points for disadvantages is an excellent way to encourage
this.  Similarly many normal people have little (or not so little)
advantages over other people.  The reason to have advantages and
disadvantages is not so (insert players name here) can formalize the
Impulsive, Overconfident, Combat Reflxes, high Dex, charecter he will
always play even if it is not on the charecter sheet it is so you can
more acurately model the personality you wish to play.  Yes you can play
a charecter with "disadvantages" even if the system does not have
disadvantages but I know of precious few GM"S who let players give their
charecters advantages.  To use a trivial real world example I do not get
hangovers but if I tried to say that a charecter I was playing did not
get hangovers most GM\'s would not allow it.  In GURPS I would just buy
the charecter the advantage No Hangover (5 points).

The reality is that Wil (a good GM) has a great number of people who
wish to play in his campaigns and could easily get a good group together
for GURPS if he wanted to.  I have had good role playing experiences in
a lot of different systems but a lot of that was do to the story the GM
told - in systems where charecter personality is encouraged through
disadvantages I saw more role playing from players who normally like to
play the "fighter" type in AD&D & will stick to bashing, stabbing,
shooting people unless encouraged otherwise.

I thought something completely different.  

Imagine, if you will, a busy sidewalk.  Loren is walking toward his
FLGS.  In his arms is a stack of GURPS books.  John is coming out of
said FLGS, with a collection of various and sundry Travller rules. 
SMASH!  The two collide.  Books go flying into the air.  They look at
each other and harrumph.  
John says to Loren, "hey, you got your GURPS in my Traveller."
Loren, "you got your Traveller in my GURPS."
They bend down, sort through the books.  Then it dawns on them.  "Hey." 
"Wow, this is good."  

Some like peanut butter cups, some don\'t.  It\'s all opinion.  I like
Traveller, that\'s why I\'m here (but usually lurking).

I can\'t recall if that has ever been established one way or another. It\'s
certainly the way I run it IMTU.

It\'s not a normal investment. It\'s a very special situation. For one thing,
the money isn\'t refundable. Once you die the money belongs to the TAS and
they don\'t owe your heirs a centicred. And in a society with a very low
rate of inflation (which IMO the Imperium is) money don\'t lose their value
so fast that a million credits isn\'t worth quite a lot even after a lifetime.
The tickets are paid for by funds accumulated through a millenium or more.

That brings me to something that I do think is a mistake: The presence of the
TAS in exactly the same form in Milieu Zero. IMO the TAS should either not
have existed in M:0 at all (I think I saw a reference in a less-than-official
article once to the effect that the TAS was founded around 300 or so) or it
should have cost less and given a lot less benefits. 

But for Milieux 1100+ I think the high rate of return can be explained. Come
to that, as someone else pointed out, it\'s not likely that TAS is paying
full rates for their passages.

I\'d say less than one A4 page myself. But one of the few things that is

membership.

Keep in mind that there are different assumptions involved and that much
depends on which ones you accept. CT says that transponders are supposedly
unforgable, but in reality they aren\'t. TNE claims they are unforgable,
period. In the last case you cannot disguise your ship, but you can still
carry forged papers that "prove" that you own it. You\'d better keep running
until you\'re out of the jurisdiction, but if you are ahead of the
notification that your ship is stolen you can get away with it.

I\'m with you there. One of my problems is that I think that even with
forgable transponders, the unrightous ship owner has enormous trouble
staying ahead of the authorities.

>If we could determine a criteria for gaining the attention of the

Basically, I think you need a transponder signal that dosen\'t make the
authorities curious. That means one they think is genuine  --  one that is
in their ship registry but that they\'ve never encountered personally. Again,
much depends on your assumptions about volume of travel. If you think the
system have hundreds of unknowns popping in every day, you can get away with
a lot less than if you think 99% of all traffic is well-known to the locals.

>Subject: What I would like to see in T5. (Quite Long)

<snip>
as a T4 ref, I\'d just like to see T5 appear. :-)

>1. I would like to see T5 retain the character generation rules of T4 to a
>large part. <snip>

I agree with JOT, it doesn\'t seem to work anymore (I\'ve deleted it from MTU).
One of the things I did with the T4.1 draft chargen was to regroup all the
skills so that (eg) Marine characters had tables for Leaders, Led and
Support (plus 3 others). I allowed players to choose a table and then
roll for a skill. It made an effective step towards allowing different
career paths in each career. The non officer tables lost the cutlass
(although maybe I\'d replace with combat axe in future).
Also I reduced the number of stat gains (especially in mustering out).
Another change was to replace first aid and medical with surgery
and medicine - I don\'t like having two skills one of which is a subset
of another (eg a character with Medical 1 and First Aid 1 has only 1 skill).
Finally, I added different mustering out benefits (eg vehicles, property,
etc. - better than everyone going for cash because they don\'t want
a blade or a gun).
From experience, one change I\'d make is in university education.
Taking a skill through to PhD with honours makes double digit skill too easy
Some sort of diminishing return is suggested.
Also, IIRC, T4.1 does not like lawers :-) You cannot be a law PhD
(but I ignored this and allowed one player to be the party\'s combat lawyer :-)

I could probably post this stuff, but it might be too long for the TML and
I don\'t think it is suitable for a website because it is still Marc\'s
work in progress.

>2. I would like to see the practice of taking damage directly off the STR,
>END and DEX of the character discontinued. <snip>

I\'d vote to keep the current CT/T4 mechanism.

>3. <snip> task system <snip>

I didn\'t think people were supposed to advocate task systems on the TML due
to the resulting flame temperature :->

Personally I\'m using a T4 varient that was invented at the time of the T4
task system flame war
(and no, its not KBS2.0, or T4.1 or CORPS, or sort of MT, or G:Tish...)

>4. The combat system needs a bit of reworking. <snip>

Remember KISS.
Personally, I like to have a few rolls to see if actions are successful and
use roleplay for the rest.
However I do appreciate the efforts of people trying to write detailled
systems because they can give a better idea of what is possible.
I just don\'t want to have to do the sums during an RP session.

>5. I would use a version of the QSDS <snip>

But I have Excel and Andy\'s Spreadsheet, what more could I want. :-)

>6. The rules should include equipment running the gamut from Mileau 0 to
>the TNE era; <snip>

Actually TL 0 - 25, so I can run any period. I\'ve just had this evil
thought about sending the party back to participate in the Ancient War.

>7. Ship combat rules should be simple, hex-based, and tactical. <snip>

Especially vector movement like Mayday and BR. I never did understand
why BL had to have such an incredibly complex movement system that was
not quite vector.
Also how about this time having the design and combat systems work
together? A silly request, I know.

>8. ALIENS. Every other edition of Traveller has made you wait to play
>aliens. This one should not. <snip>

I disagree.
If T5 is too work as a product it needs a set of books.
Trying to put too much into the basic book puts the cost up and is wasted
when the suplement comes out.
Also the more in book 1, the more chance of errata and publishing deadline
problems.

>9. A few pages devoted to the history and structure of the Imperium, <snip>

I disagree here as well, see (8).
I already have the data, a newbie would need more than was on offer.
IMHO You must ensure that T5 appears as a set of books - this gives more shelf
presence and looks like it is worth buying.

One thing that put me off GURPS (and TSRs non AD&D stuff) is assumption that
you get the basic rules and a supplement for the period. Then they are off on
the next project with no further support, leaving a game without depth.
The list off books planned to support G:T changes my mind about this much more
than putting the stats for a single sector in the G:T rulebook would.
(I may buy all the G:T stuff, but I don\'t expect to ever buy GURPS Basic or
play GURPS)

>10. As regards the art; we do not need full color plates. <snip>

Agreed. Even more so as they did not seem to be used well (Book 2 - Starships,
I rest my case).

T4 had some good attempts - lots of books and apparent support.
With less errata, more thought into the game as a set of books and what goes
where, fewer gaps and fewer contradictions, then T5 could be my dream version.

Especially 10 hardback volumes in black each with its own colour coded stripe
on the spine, a good colour pic on the front cover and a synopsis on the back.

When I say that something is canon, I mean that there is evidence in some
previously published official material that it exists. I don\'t guarantee
that there are no equally official statements to the effect that it dosen\'t
exist. There are quite a few such contradictory elements in the Traveller
canon. Opinions differ about what to do about them. Some people think you
should just ignore them. Others think you should accept the newest evidence
as the truth. My own opinion is that one should weigh the contradictory
evidence, settle on whichever one makes for the best role-playing universe,
retroactively change whatever is needed to resolve the conflict and move on
from there with a better, stronger, more self-consistent game background.

Apparently this feature of the Deyo transponders is apocryphical.

I don\'t have any problem with that aspect of it. I\'ve always assumed that
the Virus was psionic in nature. Psionics is the Traveller Universe\'s version
of magic. I do require my magic to follow deterministic rules, but the laws
of thermodynamics need not be part of said rules (many psionic operations
should IMO really fry the adept\'s brain).

My main unresolved question is whether the Virus is a psionic silicone chip
that propagates by taking over the "brains" of other silicone chips or if it
is a pure psionic energy being that lives in a certain kind of silicone chip
and propagates by changing other chips into suitable habitats and then
multiply by splitting into two.

- - i.e. more psionically adept.

But from the rules, it seems that you could take any young Imperial with a
decent PSI stat and train them to be a capable psionic if you caught them
before they started losing PSI to aging effects (and there is no negative
to the PSI roll for being an Impie, so you\'d figure that Zho and Imp
individuals would have the same potential spread in the population).

Also, is there any difference in the PSI potentials of Vilani and
Solomani (or other races for that matter).

Any comments?

But since the transponder needs to be notified that there has been a
change in ownership, all A,B and propably C type starports needs to
be able to give the transponder this new data. Buy of on of these 
officals and you have a transponder that tells the whole world that
the ship is yours.

Let\'s look at this statement.  The character is by definition at a
disadvantage due to his character or physical flaws.  Bought Hot-Tempered
for the extra 10 points?  Guess what is going to happen when the character
is hassled by the cops on that Law-D world?

True, and you can build a very servicible GURPS/CORPS character without
major problems.  If you are willing to role-play the falws, you get more
points.

Why do that?  Just role-play the situation.  Put the guy in a situation
where his physical problems prevent an escape just as all those enemies
show up loaded for bear...

The difference is cultural.  The Imperium is violently against psionics.
The early days of the Imperium were different, but a mass movement led to
the Psionic Surpressions in the 800s.

The Zhodani, on the otherhand, have made psionic ability a central part of
their civilization for millennia.  Their nobility is made up entirely of
psionic adepts.

An Imperial could be an overpowering telepath, but would have to hide it or
face severe penalties, and a Zhodani noble could have a Psi Str of 1 and no
real talent, but still have the noble rank.

Hivers have no real psionic ability.

What part of "GURPS supplement" did you not understand?  This is not T5.
It is an expansion for Steve Jackson Games\' GURPS.  Never meant to be a
stand alone book.

There is a nice conversion page to allow you to use your old Traveller
material, or you can pick up GURPS Space (a very useful book in it\'s own
right) and Behind The Claw.

Can we please stop expected G:T to be Traveller?  Accept it for what it is,
a very nice collection of the classic material in one place.

Balderdash.  If it is so impossible, please explain what I was doing last
night with only a copy of the basic rulebook and G:T.  We played out the
old Amber Zone Resuce on Ruie.  Had a blast.

I suspect this is an example of Grisham\'s Law: bad xxx drives out good
xxx. Ie. an early group of munchkin GURPSers drove out more mature gamers
to other systems.

Worst gamers I\'ve seen were Warhammer dweebs. Second worst was a Traveller
group. Best was also a Traveller group.

<stuff zapped>

In GURPS it\'s less clear that lasers are superior to all other weapons -- an
X-ray laser has 8-9 times the range of a PAW or meson of comparable size and
power consumption, but it\'s impractical to _hit_ at the ranges a spinal laser
mount would achieve, and either one does _dramatically_ more damage.

Still, unless rules were put in place to restrict it, building a ship with a
spinal laser mount and a bunch of acceleration (and rather light armor), then
sitting at the jump limit (roughly the half-damage range of a spinal laser
similar in size to light spinal mounts in GT) would be fairly tempting, and
probably extremely annoying for the other side -- a spinal laser is heavy
enough that it\'s low damage isn\'t _that_ crippling.  Given that there\'s no
evidence of tactics like this in canon, I suspect a laser size limit makes some
sense.  Exactly what the size limit would be depends on what you want to
achieve:
If you want to allow laser spinal mounts, don\'t put a limit on.
If you want to allow laser bays, put a limit of around TL gigajoules.  They
will have around three times the range of a spinal meson gun, and will be able
to penetrate armor on all but very heavy warships (6d*450(2) at TL 12).
If you want to allow \'heavy laser mounts\' -- i.e. fill a turret with a single
laser, rather than three of them -- TL*100 MJ.
If you want to keep existing designs, TL*50 MJ is probably about right.

I do believe that you should get "paid" for some of the disadvantages,
but NO where near the point values I have seen so far.  also I think
that every character should have one disadvantage (required) without
being paid for it (to help make the character interesting).  I advise
this in the Traveller games I run ("give me a character flaw or quirk")

Agreed. However, the game mechanics can\'t get in the way (my opinion). My
Traveller campaign started as space opera (we were all in high school and
didn\'t know much science), then evolved into a hard-SF game as we learned
more. It\'s now quite \'hard\', and even breaks canon to maintain real-world
congruence. 

And yes we know that jump drive isn\'t real. But we keep the unreality to a
minimum. This is partly a consequence of playing with a group of
scientists - a scientific blooper spoils their \'willing suspension of
disbelief\'.

I use TNE rules when I remember them, MT when I forget TNE, and TMWYR
("Tell Me What You Rolled") when something not covered by the rules I
remember crops up. I may migrate to playing GT, but only if there\'s a
metric version. (Personal viewpoint, but continuous conversions are too
much of a pain to bother with.) Otherwise I may use The babylon Project as
the rules for a Traveller campaign.

No, this is a game-balance feature to _force_ munchkins to take a
disadvantage. Otherwise all munchkin characters will be exceptionally
healthy and sane.  Mature gamers generally don\'t need it. (Mind you, my
definition of a "mature" gamer includes playing realistically-flawed
characters for the fun of it, without the prod of game points.)

Actually, given the way my designs work, I suspect for some types of load, the
most efficient method of handling transport is to use cheap or collapsible
cargo containers.  For example, if you\'re taking out 8 kilotons of cargo and
bringing back 3, the remaining kiloton might be sufficient for the other cargo
containers (broken up into large segments) and allowing the ship to use J-1 to
go out, J-2 to return, and cutting 25% off of transit time.  This is probably
easier to implement in zero-G than it would be in a regular water port ;).

For the core ship, there probably isn\'t much difference between a LASH and a
cargo tender -- just some differences in the external grapples, and might be
simple enough to be done in a few hours without a shipyard.

Well, that may or may not be a serious problem -- depending on how the primary
vehicle is designed, this may be enough to bump up jump performance, which
would be sort of useful.

The way I used JOT, it let you try things you didn\'t have the skill for. If you
had the skill, you had to use it instead - even if you have JOT-3 and
Vac Suit-1.

If you didn\'t have the skill, JOT let you give it a shot - either with a
negative (for tasks you couldn\'t even try without the skill, like retuning
a jump grid), or without the penalty for no appropriate skill (like Bribery
or Streetwise). Which tasks were which was up to me as GM, but
I tried to keep it consistant - though the player who tried to communicate
with some aliens through JOT was amusing, he improvised some
charades/sign language to get a point across.

I only had one character in my campaign with more than one level of JOT, 
so didn\'t have to worry much about what extra levels of this enabler skill 
allow - I just gave her +1 on skill rolls for her JOT-3 when trying things she 
lacked skill for, and still applied the negatives for when she tried things
that were normally unatemptable without the appropriate skill.

(Cut to footage of her trying to reprogram a Zho warbot by bonking it
on the head with a big wrench...)

(-3 for no skill, -3 for no appropriate tools, cut to footage of her
being carried off to the Zho landing site by the reactivated warbot...)

I saw JOT as more of an attitude than a skill. It represented a can-do
aspect of a person, someone willing to improvise and give it a shot.

Was I close? How did others run this skill?

I\'d say it was a helluva good start.

I haven\'t posted in a very long time since I\'ve been pretty busy. I just
couldn\'t resist this one though. Here\'s what I\'m wondering: how could bad
RPGers drive out good ones?

I\'ve never really understood this one (people also apply it to music and
movies). It\'s not like SJ Games has put one munchkin supplement after
another (in fact, many of the supplements I\'ve seen are rich with
role-playing opportunities).

Is there some sort of role-playing "clique" involved that I don\'t know
about? For example, recently my group decided that they\'d rather play AD&D
instead of Traveller, so going with the desires of the group I decided it
was best to go with them. They stated their cases eloquently for the most
part, and it was all good.

Now, despite the fact that munchkin gamers exist (and will exist under any
system, in the past I\'ve seen a couple of people on this list that could be
described as such in the past, I haven\'t been keeping up on the list
recently though), and AD&D is universally reviled as a munchkin system,
there was no munchkinning to be seen for miles.

I really do want to know how munchkins drive out good players. This is a
legitimate question. Are people afraid of being ridiculed by their peers if
they say "I\'m running an AD&D/GURPS"? Is there some warped sense of "cool"
among role-players that I\'m not privy to?

Or is there something else entirely? I\'d really like to know.

  That may not work - if you can "flick" your sound system to play disk
8, tracks 3, 5, 6, to repeat 6, and then to shuffle disk 4 indefinitely,
then you can probably have your handgun (or FGMP-15) only be switched by
you flicking a sequence that another telepath is going to need hours to
figure (two Roman letters and two digits is ~60 K options?).

  IAC, your first shot had best count - Zho ERT\'s hardly bear thinking about.

  The equivalent for Trav was Books 4, 5, 6, & 7, plus Striker (for the vehicle
design sequences), and if you didn\'t like HG ship design then you were SOL. And
you pretty much had to use 2300 AD material to build up your equipment catalogs.
You don\'t _need_ any of those books: I got most of those to support 2300 AD and 
CT, but may not even bother using them with G:T. AFter all, CT\'s "recommended"
book list would have been 40+ LBB\'s and ten or so 8.5x11" pubs...

  Which LBB had vehicle design? Which had detailed starship design (and even I
don\'t count HG, however much I like it)? The LBB\'s were playable as a stand
alone RPG - but so was SJG\'s Car Wars :>

  Nostalgia aside, it sounds like only the MT boxed set reached the standards
set above. (FWIW, if I run G:T this spring, I\'ll probably leave G:Space on the
shelf, as it\'s relatively useless to any experienced CT player).

Secondhand book store -- the kind that sell old records, music, movies,
computer games, and comic books. You can occasionally find wondrous things
there when individuals get married and are forced to change their evil
gaming ways. The little burg I live in is blessed with two of these, and
nearby Louisville, KY and Nashville, TN have similar stores (I travel to
both cities relatively frequently).

My FLGS *still* hasn\'t gotten a copy of GURPS Traveller, though (argh!).

ObTrav: What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen Swallow-class aerospace
fighter?

No, seriously, I have a question for the more scientifically endowed on the
list. I got a TNS message today that read (in part):

"The gas-giant planet Plistii, in the Lunion subsector of the Spinward
Marches, underwent a violent shudder beginning on 341-1115, causing some
small concern for the inhabitants of Quiru, one of Plistii\'s satellites
(Quiru/Lunion 2321)."

Why would this cause some any concern at all for the inhabitants of Quiru?

I like it because for me it allows a finer control of the task difficulty...I
suppose you could say "just give DMs", but I like being able to make the task
a base difficulty AND be able to apply DMs if necessary.

<<Personally, the Sensor rules were, IMHO, another turn-off. I *preferred* the

Thats a reason I liked the Sensors for MT...it gave you a more tactical feel
than HG, but w/out being a "gearheaded" approach.  The "short range/long
range" approach just left nothing to the player...so what if you had a 6-G
ship vs. a 1-G ship...you only had 2 ranges!  With the sensor rules and the
abandoning of the 2-range system, manuever became a consideration.

<>

Now THIS I agree w/ wholeheartedly!  I want to be able to sit down with just a
peice of notebook paper and a calculator (and NOT a scientific calc!! <G>) and
turn out a ship in under 30 minutes.  With HG, I can do one in 10 min...with
MT, I can do one in 20-30 min.  I simply leave out the little things that take
to much figuring (control points, forex;  Crew calculation I use HG for
instead of basing it off of CP\'s).

<<So there is NO EXCUSE
WHATSOEVER for having a system as user unfriendly as MTrav/FF&S or GV2.
None.>>

I like the idea of being able to design my own units...but it has to be able
to be used in a RPG setting.  If it takes 4-6 hours, thats too long unless you
have no life!  :-)   Starship design for T4 could have been salvaged by having
a pre-made set of starship weapons to purchase (a la HG and MT).  For me, that
has always been the blocking point, designing the weapons to design the ship.
I cant think of anything else that had to be designed before building the
ship,, but I am sure someone will let me know if there is! :-)

Because the shifting would affect Plistii\'s magnetic field, affecting Quiru\'s 
weather patterns, among other things.  If it was a mass shift, it would affect 
tides & tidal stresses as well.

I think that IS the explanation...you didn\'t have JUST GURPS: Traveller .  The
empasis on the "and" in the above statement was mine.

Please understand where I am coming from here...in order to be prepared to
play G:T if it turned out to be OK, I laid out $26.00 for the basic set, and
$26.00 for the Trav "supplement".  Then I find out I am "recommended" to get
Ultra-Tech 1 and 2, Vehicles, and Space to make the "supplement" a game.  

My problem is that I am disabled and on Social Security;  after paying rent,
utilities, food and the most basic personal necessities, I have approximately
$25 A MONTH left over.  This means that buying something, especially a game,
is a once-in-a-while treat for me.  Now I have to lay out $100+ to get a
complete game, when every other Trav system at least included the basics of
the game (quality of said system aside, it was something).  This rather
reminds me of the Warhammer system...which is expensive enough to begin with!

  We just did :) We know (from AM: 4 - dirty Zho\'s) that they have an empire
[or reserve :( ] of ten systems in sub-sector G of Tienspevnekr, and were
discovered 300 years after the Zho\'s used jump drives to start expanding the
polity they\'d established using STL (-5,120/~5,110). It\'s unclear how they
feel about losing the rest of their original (37 system) empire, but presumably
these were only lightly settled at best.

  It should be noted that both sub-sectors F & K of Tienspevnekr contain Droyne
worlds (AM:5), and that protecting them may have been a factor in rolling back
the Addaxur (speculation).

  There is some evidence (Droyne worlds are "isolated", though respected;
the Addaxur have a "reserve"; xenophobes are neutralized and bypassed) that
Zhodani society is not genuinely keen on having members that aren\'t both human
and culturally assimilated. While humans from ex-Imperial worlds can become
cultural Zhodani in a generation or two (and effectively identical, as their
psionic differences are stated as being non-genetic, and thus learned) there
doesn\'t seem to be any mention of non-humans being "Zhodani" (in which case
being absorbed simply means made over into an acceptable form, rather than
being fully integrated) in the way that there are Imperial Aslan and culturally
Aslan humans mentioned at length in AM:1.

  The Addaxur, as "six-legged carnivores from a high gravity world" may be
sufficiently alien to be difficult to use psionics with (see AM5) - if they\'re
a _non-psionic_ race they couldn\'t possibly participate in Zho society, which
would explain their isolation. Significantly, the G:T Aliens races listed may
all fall under this heading, which will make their treatment in the Consulate
rather hard to play (or GM). In any case the Addaxur almost certainly were
given Jump drive not too far into their 6,000 year old protectorate, but have
a very clear understanding of the importance of their border - they must also
be a conservative race (by now, ~1100, anyway) or they wouldn\'t still be an
essentially independent "minor" race.

  The Zhodani seem to consider unabsorbed (i.e. unassimiliated) worlds to be
marginal and are usually involved in ongoing efforts to absorb them (pps. 35,
39); being as conservative as they are patience is the basis of their
methodology
(it must be or they wouldn\'t have unabsorbed worlds inside of frontiers that
have
mostly been stable for hundreds or even a couple of thousand years).

  FWIW, G:T Aliens I doesn\'t appear to be covering the Addaxur, unless they\'re
the "Tyranosaur-like" critters referred to on SJG\'s web-site.

Book 2 had starship design & combat.  Elementary stuff, but still workable.

It depends on how complex you want your game to be.  Do your players *REALLY* 
need to know the principles of a jump drive to turn it on & run it?

> The CT Creed: "There is no Game but Traveller, and High Guard is its\' Product"

I like the High Guard system.  Sure, it doesn\'t break the design down further 
than the system level, but that\'s almost as gearheaded as I need to be.  I\'ve 
never had the time to sit down and learn the MT system of doing things.

You could run G:Traveller on the one book plus GURPS Lite (which is free), and
would have dramatically more information than was in the 3 LBBs.  For that
matter, you could run the level of detail in the 3 LBBs without having the
Traveller book at all (basic+G:Space would give all the functionality of the 3
LBBs and a lot more).

Hmm. That\'s not the way I look at it (when I GM at least.) Instead, I feel
that a character has 145 points to spend and must take -5 points worth of
quirks, and at least -40 points worth of disadvantages. I don\'t *allow*
people to take less (unless they really impress me with their explanation,
of course. Hasn\'t happened yet. ;-) I just find that a somewhat realistic
hero happens somewhere around 45 points worth of disadvantages.

Or, to put the foot on the other shoe (;-) to save us from having to buy the
*same damn rules* over and over and over and over again.

Remember when TNE/DC/TW2K/that dino game made you pay for the same rules all
over again?

Me, I prefer the Gurps method. I prefer to get *new* material when I buy
games, not the same content duplicated...

 operating on old info here, and this is also something of a wish list..
 
 1. I would like to see T5 retain the character generation rules of T4 to a
 large part. I liked the number of skills that characters got; it seemed
 like the plan was to step back on that a bit in T5, and I would not like to
 see that. I WOULD like to see two skills go completely away; Recon and Jack
 of all Trades. (...) I\'d like to see the  Charisma stat restored.

T5 plans to keep the basic character generation system of T4. The standard is
that characters get (on average) one skill per year. I think I\'ll still keep
Recon and JOT. All skills will be defined and include task examples that used
them in a variety of settings and situations. Charisma will not be added.

 2. I would like to see the practice of taking damage directly off the STR,
 END and DEX of the character discontinued. I would prefer there to be a
 calculated stat called Hits, based perhaps on 2x END +STR or 3x END, with
 wound effects for reaching the 1/3, 2/3 levels, and then of course death at
 0 Hits.

T5 retains the Str Dex End hit system, but introduces a variety of hit types
in addition to hits, in order to take into account the effects of heat, cold,
suffocation, etc. Some hits affect Int (temporarily) in order to produce
unconsciousness.

 3. I believe that the MT task system should be returned to the game. It is
 really not that complicated compared to a lot of games out there, and it
 gives very good results. It also eliminates the need to roll anything
 except 2d6, which, while I did not mind the half-die and the multiple dice,
 IMO complicates the game more than the MT system would.

There was a prolonged discussion of tasks some time back, and a draft of that
chapter was posted/ made available. It (unfortunately for some) retained 2.5D
for some tasks. It introduces a variety of task types for various situations
and has examples. My goal is to establish strong standards for task use and
make sure they are understandable.

 4. The combat system needs a bit of reworking. 

The combat system will be re-worked and be essentially task based. Extensive
task examples will be provided. I am working on interrupts and initiative.
 
 5. I would use a version of the QSDS. The
 concept of the USP could be retained. It should definitley be kept
 simple, IMO; I have more fun with QSDS and the ship design rules in GURPS
 Traveller than I have ever had with any version of FF&S. I am not a
 gearhead, and while there is nothing wrong with being one, the basic rules
 should not be aimed at gearheads.

The QSDS will be revised. It will be extended to 10,000 tons. A larger system
will cover larger ships.
THe USP becomes a Ship Card with appropriate blanks for data. It will be
integrated into the ship combat system.

 6. The rules should include equipment running the gamut from Mileau 0 to
 the TNE era.

Yes. Based on Equipment Cards and Weapon Cards, each of which carries the data
necessary for use.
 
 7. Ship combat rules should be simple, hex-based, and tactical. 

The book-included system probably won\'t be hex based.I\'m considering several
optiopns (included Mayday) for a separate board game.
 
 8. ALIENS. Every other edition of Traveller has made you wait to play
 aliens.

I have a Minor Race Generation System in draft form. The concept is that these
"people" with variant physical and mental abilities compete for the same jobs
humans do. Some will be better suited for the jobs than humans (and some less
suited). 

 9. A few pages devoted to the history and structure of the Imperium,
 perhaps the map of Charted Space, and a map of the Core Subsector circa
 year 0 and the Regina subsector circa 1100.

OK. Probably yes.
 
 10. As regards the art; we do not need full color plates. 

Yes. Not much full color, buut some nice art.

  That considered, the Imperium has always shown a disconcerting interest

 1) The Imperium will always be amateurs at "Big Brotherism" in the OTU so
long as the Zhodani are around. OC, the Zho\'s would disagree... ... but they
would, wouldn\'t they, the dirty mind-raping bastards :>

  Besides, Comrade, what\'s wrong with Big Brotherism?

 2) I also take exception with the description of the SDG transponders discussed
recently, and suspect that some inaccuracies have occurred. IIRC, these units
can stop transmitting, nor do they merrily inform everyone of everything they\'ve
seen and done (although the same can\'t necessarily be said for drinking
sailors).

 3) Pretty much by definition the civilian data needed to plan strategic warfare
will be easily available to enemies of the Imperium; it is something of a byword
of current economic philosophy that the ideal for an efficient free market
system  <giggle> is an environment of free and accurate information flow.
The Imperium
will in any event make its\' military data far harder to confirm than to merely
estimate accurately (although the latter may work better in the OTU than it has
tended to do in the last century).

  OK, but seeings as everyone involved knows that the ship is intended
for reactivation as a starship (after all, millions of credits are changing
hands) allowing the re-registration to occur at the end of the process seems
suspiciously like deliberately creating problems for the system that proper
methods could eliminate effortlessly.

  For that matter, would the backer actually cough up the cash for the yard
without assurance that the starship would be issued the needed papers? Not 
very likely in the real world for anything over a few hundred thousand bucks.

  I\'m still unsure (and not being involved in a campaign, less than fully
concerned) as to how to handle this. Firstly, I suspect that it may matter
less than the ship having an authentic original registry, in which case
a problem only arises if trouble-free seizures of ships are anything but
extremely rare to begin with (even then, physical searches and paperwork
tracking will eventually start to mop these up unless the initial seizure
rate is very high).

  Secondly, I doubt that ownership changes of starships occurs very often
given their minimum value of some tens or hundreds of MCr - after all, this
isn\'t Star Wars where a ship worth some tens or hundreds of _thousands_ of
credits are won and lost over card games. 

  Lastly, odds are that in cases of disputed ownership failure to meet
standards in checking for liens or said disputes will render void ones\'
claim to legal ownership; thus, a bank (or anyone dropping 15 MCr, or
their agent/counsel) will almost certainly insist on a delay, escrow,
or a payment schedule to allow meeting such standards, which may range 
from a commo radius of a sector (including foreign polities) or the 
entire State in question.

  Given the legitimate internal security issues raised by a fully equipped
central registry and their needed data resources, this may likely be an
attachment to the naval intelligence apparatus.

  The above would be a highly questionable summation, to say the least. Early
ironclads were not failures (at least not in the `50\'s-`60\'s) and went a long
way towards making non-armourclad battleships obsolete in short order. IIRC,
there were numbers of duels during the war between Union warships and fortress
batteries of the South, and the conventional surface warships neutralized by
the Virginia were not themselves undergunned. Indeed, if the Merrimack was
undergunned then no warship of the period could have been adequately armed,
which was Mr. Johnson\'s point, I believe.

  As for being "underguned due to the weight of their armour", both Gloire and
Warrior were purpose built from the ground up and their armament load-out was
intentional (although trade-offs always occur, and armour was now the primary
competitor). If these vessels _couldn\'t_ be adequately armed due to their
defensive armour requirements, then the case against your original thesis is
proved.

  I would be interested in seeing a source for the comparative sizes of naval
warfare (including shore battery) gun sizes, rather than seige artillery. 

>The forts were defeated by the same type of force that built them which is
>what I said would happen with any technology.

  The WWI-era Russian forts of the Polish frontier districts were "defeated"
by the Imperial Germans largely ignoring them, which the conservative upper
ranks of the ground forces had discounted as a possibility.

I\'ve always like JOT characters, but not the JOT skill. It probably

Personally, I\'ve gone both ways on this over the years.  I like dropping
the Stats with damage, but that only really works if the Stats are a
major part of the Asset used in the Task System.  Personally, I\'m going
to leave the Stats alone (during the combat) and use a different damage
system where wounds of different levels raise all tasks by one or more
levels until healed.  Take a light wound and all tasks are one level
harder, serious wounds make all tasks two levels harder, incapasitating
wounds make all tasks three levels harder. All wounds also have tasks
involved to remain standing and conscious.

  The repulsor was a tremendously difficult system to get past, except possibly
at TL 14 (50t missile bay f9 penetrates a 50t rep-bay on 9+); at TL 15 the 50t
bay is f5 for 11+, while the 100 tonners start at f2 at TL 10, and increase by
+2f/TL until f9 at TL 15 - which requires a 15+, so even a squadron of ten 
fighters "linking" with a central gunships comp (not in the rules, BTW) still
wouldn\'t be able to pentrate the defenses of a proper warship.

  If your goal is to eliminate minor attritional damage from badly outclassed
units (escort vs. merchants, destroyer vs fighters, or cruiser vs. DD, etc.)
then the repulsor stops those wartime-use nukes while allowing continuation
of a mission w/o significant cumulative damage requiring premature return to
repair facilities.

  Are they technologically accurate? Don\'t know, but they are in CT/HG the same
as jump drives, and they weren\'t a dominant system in the TCS runs, AFAIK.

  The possibility exists that it is only possible at TL 15-16 with the use
of the original Cymbeline chip stock; the IN\'s behaviour in Signal GK is
consistent with this theory, and _someone_ nuked Cymbeline during the 
Rebellion, likely for this same reason.

  If this does comprise a needed component to compromise the canonical
SDG\'s at normal Trav techs, then attempts to do so are otherwise going
to fail.

JOT: Keep it. It is part of the feel of traveller for me.

Tasks: I lvoe the MT task system. OK, maybe a 3d variant would work
better... But I love the fact that players ALWAYS roll the same number of
dice, and know how to figure the chances quickly. And, the player\'s guide
to tasks was only 1 page, which I always copied and handed to my players.

TNE\'s d20 system was cumbersome, simply due to math in play or having 5
assets written down on a sheet, as P.N. did.

Combat Systems: I like Striker, and I like MT. Either one (they are very
similar) is good for me. TNE was too NON-lethal to PC\'s... I won\'t repeat
my usual example unless asked.
	I LOVED MT\'s method: each die of attripute damage did one hit. When
out of HP\'s, you\'re a "Mission Kill"... whether you live or die, and
Injuries to attributes are handled "Post Combat" - to me, this represented
the adrenaline level drop post-combat. Also, MT was the only combat system
for traveller where a .22 cal pistol might kill someone of average stats
without GM fiat or house rules.

Aliens: Deluxe Traveller (CT) included capsule alien rules for Zhodani and
Aslan characters (shortened from the original _Contact!_ articles in JTAS).
ENough to play them. A one page for a couple of alien races would be
valuable. Far more valuable than Chris Foss\' contributions to traveller.

Equipment: a Good, broad spectrum of TL 7-15 stuff, preferably a single
text entrie with stats for the different TL\'s.

CGen- The T4 system did fairly well, but I felt that more careers than the
10 were needed. I\'d like to see all the ones from MT/(CT)supp4 as well as
the new one from T4. I like the one skill roll per year. If anything, I\'d
DROP getting skills from promotions or commissions, but keep them for
special duty\'s. I\'d like to see an "advanced system" ala
Merc/HD/Scouts/MP/MT in a supplement, possibly with more careers yet, as
well as several new types of schooling.

Economica: Fix some of the broken bits. Take more space and give better
tables. But keep the feel (even if the details change)

TAS: IMTU, it will always be High Passages, every other month, with a MCr1
cash up front to apply; 90% rebate if rejected without good cause, no
rebate if rejected for cause. If you got ther rebate, You may reapply in 4
years... An membership is non-transferrable, and for natural life.

Ship Construction GT has this about right. Simple, fast, and no power
constraints. A more detailed system should be available. Personally, I like
the detail of MT, but anyhting more is annoyign to me. I DETEST FF&S2...
too pickayune, and poorly worded.

Art: Good quality B&W line or grayscale art. The best part of T4, IMNSHO,
is the B&W pencils... they really gave a "Look" to the TU.

Marc,

In reference to this I would like to add my own wishes to the list.

I\'ve been one of the proponents of a Role-Playing ship-to-ship combat
system. I would like to see one (albeit simple) added to the core rules of
T5. In relartion to a Role-playing game, it simply makes more sense to me.
Additional material for supplimental war gaming is definately a GOOD THING,
but the core rules should address the role playing aspect.

As I\'ve said, rather a long time ago now, One of the biggest drags I\'ve seen
is switching to a war game mode in the middle of a game where most of the
players not directly involved, or not interested, dirft off.

Please, please, make some effort to include material that can be used for
this. Currently I tend to use a (ever increasing) number of tasks and a
results chart for the players attacks agains other craft, and simple results
chart for attacks agains their own craft, with them role playing the
activities resulting from hits.

Subintelligent in threes.  Some packs have been known to go

Y\'know, you\'re a real bastard.  You drop a tidbit like this, and

I\'ve been trying to come up with a way of bringing the Tines into
Traveller.  Chargen promises to be a _bitch_.

Yah.  IMTU, if the Hivers ever suggest this to the Tines, I think
there will be a _violent_ reaction.  The legends of Flenser and
Steel will _not_ be forgotten.

Physical, too - remember how a pack needs to cooperate to do
human-type manipulations of some things - and can\'t with others.
Plus limits on some physical combinations; you can\'t have all six
members of a pack poking at that little PC; you\'re limited to
two, maybe three.

And herein lies (one of) the rub: how to set this up so that it
models AFUTD reasonably well, while making the character neither
too powerful nor too weak to fit in with the Traveller universe

>Adding and losing bodies would affect the person, as would damage to

...which is another tough spot - you\'d want to model this, and
make it part of character generation.

Even nastier: adding and losing members would affect _skills_.
You might find it necessary to at least partially model the
creation of a character that was mostly killed, to develop a
skill set for a member to bring in.

(And you thought that rolling up a K\'kree family-herd was bad!)

You are reading too much into this.  You could easily play a decent
Traveller game using just GURPS and the G:T book.  The others listed are
options.  Much like an auto comes with a list of options that make it more
comfortable or flashier, but aren\'t essential to the basic concept of
transportation.

I own all the recommended GURPS books, and to be honest I\'m going to take
very little out of each of them to convert to my CORPS: Traveller game.
The only one I would really recommend is Space, for some pretty good rules
on different environments and gravities, along with some other tidbits.

UT 1 & 2 are nice, but much of the technology leans towards the space opera
"blasters and force shields" school of SF.  Some good ideas to be mined.
Both of those books can be found in the used pile.  Don\'t buy Vehicles
unless you are a real gearhead.  Speaking as a FFS2 fanatic, I find it
annoyingly complex.  (Using Imperial measurements is a real head ache when
gearheading.)

For a different flavor, and a decidedly non-canon feel, look for Biotech.
My Zhodani use more bioengineering than the 3I, more reason to hate them!
Cyberpunk can be a gold mine of ideas on computer systems.  And so on..

The point is that GURPS and G:T provide a usable framework for games.  The
meat is provided by the Referee, wether that be by way of GURPS books or
personal development.

No Problem, instead of 100 points give them 145 and pick out some disads for
no points, ballanced just the same.  

but a quirk is only -1 point anyway.  :)

I use JoT as an "extender". I use the T4 task system, but I added the idea of 
"prerequisite" skill levels for certain tasts ("I don\'t care how good your dex is, 
you can\'t do open heart surgery with Medical-1, its got a prerequisite of at least 
Medical-3"). However you can add your JoT level to your skill to get around 
these prerequisites (eg if the character has Medical-1 and JoT-2, they can 
attempt open heart surgery), however the JoT doesn\'t improve your chances (ie 
you are still using just Medical-1 to resolve the task). I\'ve found that this makes 
it a very useful skill and seems to represent the "give it a go" feel of JoT.

the UT book are just gadgets, not really needed.
space is a great book for a beginning GM, but not really needed exept for

IME the problem here is that the rest of the party sticks around out of a
sense of loyalty (often even if they haven\'t bought Sense of Duty) and get
wasted along with him. Even if this is because of their SoD they have just
gotten killed for 5pts, whereas the one who got them killed gets how many
more?

This is a general problem with hunteds, IMO. There is a real chance that
the whole party will become embroiled in the feud/hunt, but only one
character actually gets points for it.

DGP of that era was producing a wonderfully useful mag, and their task
system worked for me. Funny thing tho... I find the Starplay task system
vaguely reminisant of MT\'s task system....

For you, maybe. But it did provide a wondeful framework, fromm which it
freed me of having to, as a ref, asign arbitrary task numbers and levels of
attribute for DM\'s. Admittedly, I tweaked it: +1 to target numbers and used
Att/3, to match up with HITS determination, and max DM +10. But it was (and
still is, IMO) the easiest of the task systems for trave to tweak for feel.
And, players always used 5 dice: 2 for success, and 3 for time---- I have
players use two colors of dice, and roll them once. WOrks well for me and
my playerrs. CT was inconsistant in methods. TNE was using multiplication
by fractions in play, or listing 5 assets in play... a real problem when
certain things (like certain pieces of equipment) add to base asset BEFORE
difficulty mods. T4 simply confused my player group at first, then made
them all realize they were GODLIKE in ability, in play at least, getting
far to many critical successes. Also, I like roll high systems, because
More is Better works for me.

As a ref, if a player doesn\'t have some Psych Lims as part of the concept
or as a result of interpretation, I\'ll impose other disads upon a
character. Especially in Traveller... Things like old enemies, bad reps,
even good (but misleading) reps. IMTU, all scouts have compulsive carousing
at some level, all marines have a sense of duty to their fellow marines,
most naval types have either adrenaline addiction or some major attitude
problem, noble have a sense of duty to the imperium, etc. Players who don\'t
generally need to explain their rationale for lacking such psych lims. But
I don\'t like having to have them wriiten down... because I find that the
more is wriiten down and mechanicalized, the less role-playing and more
rule-playing occurs.

	One of Peters most memorable characters was a flaming bisexual
cassinove with a speciesist attitude. A wonderful Devil-may-care sex-fiend
rocket-jockey... And this in a campaign where a male scout wound up married
to a male marine general due to scout brew and ZPG laws on earth.... These
are not the type of things I see happening in character construction
systems (Point-based or pool based {ala WWG\'s WOD}) very often. But they
are the type of Flawed Heros I like to GM for.

This system... will it be included in T5? When can we begin to expect T5?

I used it in two ways. Note: I use a slightly tweaked MT task system.

1st: if you have the skill, it is the number of retries allowed without
rolling a determination task.

2nd: If you lack the skill, a Difficult, (Edu{for knowledge based} or
Int{for other stuff})and JOT, instant, fateful (no retries), safe. Success
grants a temporary level-0 in the needed skill, for ONE type of task, and
if that succeeds, will grant one AT towards acquiring Level 0, if elligible.

  From: "Thomas Vickers" <redroach@sprynet.com>

  I have never run or played any Traveller other than Classic Traveller and
  JOT was a wonderful skill.
  It typically allowed those who had it (Scouts it seemed) to try stupid
  things that they would not normally try.

Personally, I hate JOT.  It\'s great fun for the person who has it --
and boring for everybody else.

If you want to try something, you should have the skill.
If you don\'t have the skill, you should try to come up with some skill
which is appropriate.
If you don\'t have something appropriate, come up with a skill which is
remotely related to an appropriate skill.
And so on, as your chances of success rapidly approach the typical
snowball in the flames of hell.

The thing is, _everybody_ gets to try to see if they have something
appropriate.


On the other hand, if _anybody_ in the group has Jack-of-all-Trades
that person gets to do _everything_ which falls through the cracks.
Wracking your brain to find ways to make your skills appropriate is
gone -- if your skills are inappropriate, just give the problem to the
person with JOT, let him solve it, and yawn.  I know a couple of
people who tend to create dynamic-do-all characters, and if the group
ends up in an unfamiliar situation it just gets boring.

IMO: In a skill-based system, the way to do jack-of-all-trades is to
have the jack learn a bunch of mutually unrelated skills, and let him
use them just like any other character.  Expensive, and your spreading
out over lots of things weakens your strengths, which is exactly the
way it should be.

The combination of Basic and GURPS Traveller has a _lot_ more
material than exists in the LLB\'s.  While you have focused
on _one_ aspect (world generation system), the fact is that
one can always make up worlds non-systematically while the
Little black books (unless you want to include more than the
first few books, ie _all_ the CT material published) required
you to come up with your own background.

The fact is that you _can_ get started on one shot.  I ran a
GURPS Traveller campaign one what I wrote myself (before GT
came out) that had much less material.

Now, there has been some expression of dislike by those who honestly
don\'t care for the GURPS system and have similar objections.
What has disappointed me has been attempts by others to use
the trade offs that space limitation force, by  necessity, to
pick at things that couldn\'t be included in the first book and
try and blow them up as major  things.  There seems to be a small
faction out there that seems to just wants it to fail and looks for
bad things to say about it.

I never really liked it outside of CT. Once MT turned up with its multitude
of skills I felt that was either redundant or too powerful depending on how
the GM treated it.

I\'ve never found having to multiply or divide by 2 or 4 to be a whole lot
harder than remembering the target level for Difficult, Average, etc in MT.

In TNE any .22 can kill an NPC with one hit (and you don\'t need to be
shockingly skilled, either).

As far as I can tell (though I know next to nothing about economics) if the
OTU\'s economics were to be fixed it wouldn\'t look much like the OTU anymore :(

I\'ll go with the MT & TNE version: One high passage every other month, one
application per person, accepted unless blackballed, pay MCr1 upon
acceptance, membership for life and non-transferable.

I find MT to be worse than FF&S1 (don\'t have FF&S2), as it is just as
picky, and less flexible.

All IMHO, of course.

  "Repulsors are large focussed anti-grav projectors. When directed at 
incoming missiles, they deflect them away from their target." (HG, p.19)

  In that case, the excuse is wildly unbelievable as they can\'t reasonably
stop anything other than contact missiles from impacting, let alone nuke-
dets at 50,000 km\'s. If they can somehow stop a single such missile at such
a great range (ignoring 10 or 30 TOT) then what is their effective range?
If they can break apart (which is what would be required, possibly) a missile
at 100,000 km then why can\'t they simply start folding and mutilating small
craft at those ranges (Voila! StarFires force beams make their appearance...)?

  IIRC, Mr. Akins had the excellent suggestion of redesigning repulsors as
rapid fire PD laser bays when converting to and from HG.

For JOT under Hero:
	Use Cramming Talent (5 pts)[HSR p47, (HG Stock No #500)], possibly
with the +1 power advantage "also for combat skills". Having multiple slots
represents multiple levels of traveller JoT.
another possible PA: assume an adventure is one month, and buy down the
time at +1/4 per level, or even +1/2 per level.

No requirement to do so.  Nuke-dets are not exactly CT canon, blame \'star wars\'
for that idea.  High reliability at five kilometers is plenty to deal with
conventional missiles, and for an armored ship will also do a fine job against
medium-sized nuclear weapons (depending mostly on quality of radiation
shielding on a warship).  Give it a fifty-k range and no practical simple
nuclear weapon will be a threat.

Shrug.  Use something else for defense against det-lasers.  Short range
fold/spindle/mutilate on small craft is not clearly a problem ;)

How do you play out the scocial effect of this level of Big Brotherism?
This system makes private travel all but imposible.  During regular
maintainence the complete log could and probably would be downloaded to the
Impires athorities.  You are talking about the equivalent of a log of every
place a car went, when it went there, how long it stayed, and in some cases,
what it was carring and who.  This has to have effect on the
social/political part of the TU.  What about companies buying this
information on their competiter?  What about this information falling into
Zodonie or Solomanie hands?

You really do not understand logistics.  The US military would colapse in a
matter of weeks and in some cases days without private contracters and
civilian transport and supplies.  There are numerous studies and military
excercise bases on this information.  As for your \'handguns\' vs MBTs WRONG.
US citicens have a lot more than handguns like dynamite and the production
equipment to make much more powerfull devices plus all the military hardware
in national gaurd staions the cost gaurd and the civilian contraters
warehouses that hold LAW rocket, tanks unter construction, and of course the
power generating system are in private hands.  

A MBT crew would not last long in urban combat in the US.  I\'d love to see
them TRY am refuel under sniper fire or maintain supply in a hostile US.  NO
trucks, no safe loider areas.  Insergency.  For a good example of your \'big
stick\' think of Vetnam on steriods.  At least with Vetnam the military had
secure traning and supply areas.  In a war between the population an the
military the military will always loose IF the people want to win because
the military is part of the population and some will turn.  What happens
when the military is ordered to attack the town where their families live?  

Who is going to supply the fuel an ammmo?  Truck it to forward bases through
hostile teritory?  If you think the military could \'grab\' the material they
would need you are sadly mistaken.  It take SKILLED people to maintain
todays military.  This support is mostly civilian contracters who would
become the enemy in a pop. vs mil. war.  In a population of another country
war vs the US military you are very right but not when every mans hand is
turn against the military.  Remember the the military makes up only a
fraction of one percent of the population.  For every soldier there are
hundreds of civilians.

As long as resitry information is all that is sent then that is fine and
there would be no reason for rebellion but in many other posts the BBs
remember everything any tell all to all other BBs.  This would be beyond all
reason and tollerence any anything that resembled a free sociaty which
traveler is basicly.  I was not saying the \'licence plate\' BBs were a
problem.  I was trying to explain to those who said the BBs retained all
this other data that such a system would mean the lost of freedom and thus
the end of any reasonable \'adventuring\' enviroment.  (Except for a rebelion
of course.)  I\'m sorry if you missunderstood me.  My responces were directed
at those that discribed the transponders as basicely perfect unforgable \'big
brother\' boxes that recorded and reported nearly everything.  Those BBs
would warp the TU to the point of unrecognisablility and I like the TU just
like it is thank you very much.  Good old gorrila capitalism with a little
light larceny and chacainery added for some spice.

No a valid argument.  You might as well say the sun is
invunerable/indistructable simply because it is to massive to be affected by
the weapon we can put against it.  It\'s a question of scale.  The guns
mounted on the iron clads were intended to defeat wooden ships not iron
clads and the inclads were so overweighted that they sank in a moderate storm!

That was never tested.  Neither iron clad sank of was sunk by a wooden ship.
At least that is as I recall it from high school history.  A very long time ago.

Not mobile artillery.  Sappers!  Engineers!  The same thing that made them.
That\'s the point.  That which makes something can unmake it.  It was a
truism that any fort would fall in time to a prolonged seige.  Look at
maesada.  It took them awhile but it fell and it was on top of a shear sided
moutain with only one narrow foot path up.  In the end the attacked built
their own way up to take the fort.

Not exactly true.  It takes more proceesor time.  More parrell processors
means less time.

>a 1024-bit key takes 65,000 times as long to decrypt as a 64-bit, or 

Also not true, see the encription news groups for the technical why.  It has
the do with repetition, colation of multiple hits, and \'magic numbers\'.
(Some fairly high level algebra is involved.  I still have problems with
some of the more technical aspects.  I\'m am EE not a PHD in mathmatics.
Some very intersing theory there if you take the time to read up on it.  The
books are not in your everyday local library but they can sometimes be found
at coledge libraries or gotten through inter-library loan.  This can cost
though and you don\'t get to keep the book out as long.)

Again not true.  The NSA can break any currently available software PGP
scheme in less that 30 days.  The NSA claimed this in a report serveral
months ago.  
Parrallel processing with successive aproximation between each attempt
greatly reduces the time required.  One PC might take 2 years, 2-1 year, 4-6
months, 8-3 months, 16-1.5 month 32-.75 months.  There are systems being
produced today espicially for the NSA for this purpose with over 1000
process system linked through a high speed bus.  Just using the brute force
method these systems can defeat long key PGP in hundreds of hours as opposed
to 10000+ hours.  The company making them is intending to offer them for
scientic use when they have fullfilled their current contract to supply the NSA.

There are no unbeatable systems.  To say there are is to say that perfection
exists.  Nothing is perfect.  I do not dought that something could be made
that is very difficult to defeat.  This has been done quite often but that
does not make it perfectly unbeatable just difficult.  Mankind in not
capable of perfection.

You really should stop believing all the popular press hogwash about PGP and
it\'s relatives and check with industry trade mags.  They deal with
encryption as a business and even they say that their own best systems are
defeatable and these are the people who wrote them!  They also provide the
statistics for the average and maximum number of interations needed to
defeat there algorithyms using yhe brute force method.  This gives a
\'benchmark\' as to security but is not an absolute measure as some systems
are very immune to the brute method but easier to defeat by other means.

I used interations in the above as the parrallelizm and speed of the
computers used set the time require per interation and the number of
simutanious interations that can be done on a per second basis.  None of
this takes into account various short cuts use to cut down the number of
posible keys by various methods of eliminations.

Mr. Zimmerman himself admits that PGP can and has been defeated.  What more
do you need?  Or are you simplely not going to listen to reason?  If you are
unwilling to discuss this in a reasonable manner then there is little point
in discussing this at all.  If this is a matter of \'faith\' with you then
please say so, so I can stop wasteing my time.

Big snip!

One thing anti-rules lawyer do not think about is when the GM and the player
have different understandings of a rule then it is the player and his
character that end up getting hurt.  The Charater shouls have an innate
understanding of the \'rules\' of his world, he grew up there but the player
does not.  All he has to go on are the rules.  Those rules and common sence
extrapolation from those rule or real world reality is all the player has to
go on.  If you want your player to be able to \'be\' their characte you as GM
must make the world they live in reasonable an internaly consistant.  I have
had characters killed by GMs that did not know the rules.  I found the rules
(for anti-tank land mines) that applied when they could not and my character
DIED by them (atomized).  That was OK my me. (It upset the GM because the
situation was not suppose to be that deadly.  The GM wanted to \'it didn\'t
happen\' it but it fit the story so I just wrote up a new character and the
rest of the group had a \'personal\' reason to GET the bad guys.  I thought it
was dramatic.  My next character on the other hand was a mercenery and did
not give a darn about revenge for someone he hand never met.  It made for
some good roleplaying.)

A game or world that is not internally consitant can\'t be played.  The
player have no \'reality compass\' they can trust.  Like the scientific
method, something isn;t true unless it is consistantly true.  I\'ve played
and GM a lot of games in the last 15 years.  Rules lawyers are NOT a problem
for me.  I put them to work FOR me whem I GM.

What is a problem are those that try to bend the rules for their own gain.
These are not \'rules lawyers\' in my opinion.  They as nitpickers, cheats,
power gamers, or wathever you call them.  

I\'m a \'rules lawyer\' but I do not delay a game over useless trivial rules.
(lighten up and go with the flow people!  It\'s suppose to be fun.  Don\'t
ruin a good dramatic scene over a rule that has little if any effect on the
outcome.)  I usually do not call a mistake during a section unless it screws
a character badly (maim, cripple, kill).  Stoping a game for a 20 minute
\'rules hunt\' is not my idea of fun.  I do not get nearly as much ganing time
as I would like and I hate wasting it looking through rule books when I
could be playing.

I read the rules for the game I\'m playing and know where to find what I need
when I need it. (Spell discritions ect.  using book marks helps)  I provide
information to the GM on rules when my character is \'off stage\' by looking
them up and passing them the book for THEM to interpret or answering
questions if ASKED.  This speeds play and when my character is center stage
I have been helped in this way (and hurt) my other \'rules lawers\' some of
whom are much better at behind the scenes rule reading than I am.  A GM that
is open to this type of assistance will have less trouble with \'rules
lawyers\' and less work running his game but if the GM says we \'play through\'
then we play through and I speak to him after the game if the error was
grevious enough.

A GM who refuses to redress a mistake on his part that cost a character
greatly is not a GM that is fun to play with.  The redress can come
naturally in the game and not require \'rewriting\' history.  A distant
relative dies and the character inherite the money he lost by mistake, and
extra healing potion turns up, a cleric that just happens to know how to
reattach a limb or cure blindness, or in the case of a dead character a stat
point or some other bone in the replacement charater or let the new
character inherit the old \'wrongly dead\' character\'s stuff though I usually
do not like this solution as it may short the rest of group booty that
should have been theirs.  This was espicially true in old AD&D.  I generally
played rangers with little personal magic.  I always had more trouble than
treasure from magic items in AD&D.  LOVED the Kensia from Oriental
Adventure.  They were not allowed to use magic in combat!  No cured items!
Same for barbarians.

That is not what I meant.  The pirate robs with the heavily armed ship with
NO transponder then transfers his booty to a SECOND ship with a legal
transponder.  If the pirate ship is damaged the legal ship buys the parts
for it legally and then takes it to the pirate ship.  The legal ship never
has to be in the system where the piracy takes place.

To a curtain limit, yes.  I said that the transponders were DIFFICULT to
forge but not imposible as NOTHING that can be made can not be beaten.  Ths
cost could be prohibative.  If the reasearch need to beat the transponder
cost 1000mc and a years work by 10 Electronics-6 techs plus 10mc per fake
how could a ships captain use this to abscond with a free trader that he can
not make the payment on?  What pirate could GET 10 Electronics-6 techs?
This would be consistant with the traveller adventure.  It can be beaten but
its REAL tough and expensive.  The corp. in the adventure could field this
type of effort but even the corp rep. said its was expensive.  What is
\'expensive\' to a corporation with a few hundred 6000ton merchant ships plus
more of other hull types?

I love the old CT adventure books!  So much meat in so little a package.  As
far as adventures go they had alot of bang for the buck.  3.50 when I bought
them years ago.

Have you looked at the GURPS space adventure that have been published?  They
would be easily adapted the Traveller.  Star deamon is very travelleresk.

This is blatantly not true as the NSA has publicly anounced they can break a
PGP message in under one month.

If you say 1000 fast processors (one custom machine built for this purpose.
The maker started shiping them to the NSA a few months ago.  No special
tech.  The processor cores are mass produced for the industrial control
industry.  Specs. were in one of the trade mags. I get as an EE.) at 100
interations per minute that\'s 1meg atempts every 10 minutes or 144meg
attempts per day or 4.32 billion per month.  1 million is about 20 bit.  1
billion is about 2000 bits.  So in one month any key less than 2000 bits
long WILL be broken.  

Even if the system can only manages 10 per cpu per minute (long message)
that\'s 200bit\'s per month for an absolute worst case senerio.  (The last
posible key is the right answer)  If you know the message was in standard
ASCII to start with you cut time by 2. (Only half the range is used for
standard text.)  With \'hit\' recognition you cut this time by a facter of 4
as worse case.  Mean time would be about half that.  That a mean decode of
an 1600 bit key in ASCII in one month with only one machine working on it.
1600 bits is 200 characters.  If the public key is known that cuts the time
in half or doulble the lenght of the key that can be decoded in one month
mean.  Such a system would be program to recognise patterns to choose the
\'best guess\' to cut down mean time per message based on human idiocencracies
also.

Having a working copy of the software is a great advantage in code breaking.
It beats having to start form scratch to figure of the basic type of
encription used.  The militray inteligency agencies have to start form just
the encoded message and they break codes far more complex that PGP.

I\'m sorry but the PGP that I have read about does NOT use session keys.  At
least it was not in the read me files or the other technical stuff that I\'ve
read about it.  It uses a public and private key generated by the originater
(the public key\'s owner).  None of those keys change unless done so by the
operater.  Check out any of the PGP pages on the internet.

Session keys are used by web browsers (and other things) for secure internet
transactions.  They generate the session on the fly.  My most recent update
to my browser included a 128-bit encoder of \'secure\' pages.

	Even worse, Coke Classic is NOT "Coca Cola" as it existed prior to

	Interesting. I found the task system to be the greatest thing since
sliced K\'Kree. A tidy, compact way of consistently determining die
rolls--MUCH better than CT\'s "OK, you want to do what? Hmm ... lemme
see ... I think the roll for that was in adventure 3 <flip flip flip>
No wait, that was a JTAS article <flip flip flip> ... noo ... oh
yeah! Supplement 7 <flip flip flip> ... OK, roll 8+, +1 for STR8+, +2
for STR12+, -1 for INT5-, except humans who get +1 ..."

	It provided a consistent, understandable way to quickly figure out
probabilities for ANYTHING. Sure, as referee I can just declare by
fiat "you must roll 7 or higher, and I\'ll give you an arbitrary +1
for your DEX."  But I don\'t always think that quickly on my feet
without some structure. Tasks provided that. For *anything* a player
wanted to do, all I had to do was mentally answer two easy
questions--"What word description <Simple, Routine, Difficult,
Formidable ...> most matches what he\'s trying to do, and which skills
would help." Boom.

My point has always been, the LBB\'s were stand alone.  Somebody could buy a 
set off the shelf in \'77 and hack up a game.  A brand new cherry GM, starting 
today with GURPS, has to buy up a *pile* of supplements to get started if they 
*DON\'T* have any other Traveller material around.  That to me is the *gist* of 
the problem.  Not \'this system sucks cause it\'s brand x and not brand y.\'  For 
somebody to decide \'Dammit, I wanna run a role playing game\' today, with no 
backround, he\'s gonna have to spend some serious money.  Period.  That is the 
fact, and it cannot be denied.

I don\'t recall any reference to a "physiological" difference.  
Psychological, and sociological, absolutely.  Certainly, no flavor of 
Trav has ever proposed a set of alternate rules for psionic strength 
generation, so I\'d say if there are "references" to it, they aren\'t 
backed by rules.

True.  So long as you hid their powers from view, and they could 
find an institute capable of teaching at the same level as the 
Zhodani, and they weren\'t revulsed at the thought of learning 
something as distasteful as psionics.

I\'d say that the potential spread would be the same.  This is where 
the similarity ends.  In the Consulate **ALL** individuals are tested. 
 It\'s doubtful except on the most pro-psionic of worlds in the pre-
Suppressions Imperium that even the majority of individuals are 
tested.

Well, we batted this one around when designing Psionics 
Institutes.  Here\'s my take on it...

Since all human stock descended from one ancestor race, all 
flavors of humaniti, major and minor have the same range of 
potential.  Of course, the odds of finding an institution of the same 
quality in the Solomani Rim post-Psi Suppressions is going to be a 
big chore relative to finding one on Zhodane.

Varying alien races may have less, or potentially more, or none.  
Remember though, that an alien race that has better potential had 
best have some counterbalancing flaw for game balance though.

Of course, you *could* run a GURPS:Traveller-Black Ops crossover!

All those 650 point characters would be, er, *interesting* in Traveller!

My information on the Monitor and Merrimack was that they were undergunned
compared to similar ships of the period of the same tonage.  As I recall
from long ago one of them only mounted guns in its\' one turret.  As for the
later ship you mentioned you are getting into an era I have little knowledge
of.  WWI sea craftare not an area I have studied.  It was my understanding
though that there was no ship in WWI that could survive a torpedo attack
unbreached.  That would prove my point as far as that goes.  It has been my
only contention that any thing made be man can be beaten by man.  That is my
theory and as yet it has not been disproved.  I had no intention of geting
into an argument over historical weapons systems that I have only distant
memories about from high school.  My statement is that in their time there
were weapon that could defeat them even if it took raming by a similar ships
to do so.  It\'s alway easier to distroy that create.

With teleportaion and matter creation technology you could make all the
copies you wanted.  Use teleporter to scan it and matter creater to
reproduce it.  If the chips evolved to begin with they could be
cloned/remanufactured or whatever you want to call it.  The fact is SOMEBODY
develope that transponder and that person could reproduce it and someone
else as bright could rediscover the process.

It;s not the civilian data I was worried about there.  The recorders record

  People ran RPG\'s off of SJG\'s "Man to Man", from which GURPS:Lite is a 
_huge_ advance. Im all seriousness, when I run I\'ll probably leave the
guns & ammo supplements at home (UT 1/2, Vehicles - _if_ I use it) and use

I like this and will add it to my discription of JoT.  I have used JoT

Yes, DGP stuff *was* (at least generally) great ... when you could get it here
in Oz (the dsitribution channel was mildly broken and got worse as the years
progressed) ... but their Task System turned me off. What can I say? It was
probably a personal thing.

As for Starplay, well I hope it is *very* vaguely reminiscent of MTrav!!!!!

I tended to keep a record of DMs that had been handed out and the situations so
that I could be consistent. Mostly, of course, role playing was as important as
roll playing so it didn\'t matter too much ... of course, I was always open to
discussion of the matter with the players (if they shouted loudly enough ;-)

But, at its basis, the Task system was as arbitrary as CTrav for Tasks that
hadn\'t been pre-determined. So, if you weren\'t playing a canned adventure, and
weren\'t doing one of the standard tasks described in the book, you were being as
arbitrary as you were with CTRav. And CTrav generally required fewer rolls to
boot. And it was, for me anyway, more intuitive.

Admittedly, this is all personal preference. But, really, when you boil it down,
that\'s what this list is built on ... the TNE\'ers personal preference is that
TNE (despite what non TNE\'ers see as its flaws) is the best thing since sliced
bread; ditto the CTravers, MTravers, T4ers and now GTravers.

It seems to me that SJG is darned either way.  If they reproduce material
from one book to another, their existing customer base should be upset
because, to get the (for example) Traveller info, they\'re being forced to
buy again the info already in Space (which they own).  If they don\'t, the
new customers should be upset for just the reasons Dusty states.  Pick yer
poison!

Points about percieved incompleteness are well taken, but how does it
distinguish GURPS:Traveller from any of the other flavors of Traveller?  IG
put out - how many - 22? - books in a year and a half or so...  GDW\'s three
incarnations produced a stupendous number of supplements, too.  Remember
that G:Traveller, IIRC, isn\'t a game or set of rules per se - it\'s a
backround/campaign supplement to a set of rules (GURPS)...

What if you *DIDN\'T* have your LBBs?  That\'s the question.  If you have *NO* 
LBB\'s or other Traveller materials to work with, you\'re screwed if you think 
you can run anything on GURPS Basic & G:T.

Fair point.  Would the LBBs, then, be bad, had they been available
separately?  

I just pulled my LBBs out and took a good look at them.  The box of three
was a game system, and very little more.  There\'s no background beyond that
necessary to generate characters and set some basic game parameters.  The
TAS is simply mentioned as a private organization.  That\'s fine - after
all, this is what came first; all the wealth of background and history
(other than Imperium, IIRC) followed, not preceded these rules!

It feels like mixing apples and oranges to compare the LBBs with
GURPS:Traveller in this way.  One might better compare the LBBs to GURPS
Basic, Space, etc., than to GURPS:Traveller...

  The USS Monitor was a particularly bad design in that respect. Only a few
years later at the battle of Lissa two fleets largely comprised of armourclads
went at it - and they were all seaworthy designs.

  At Lissa, the groups of unarmoured ships of both the Austro-Hungarian and 
Italian fleets avoided inappropriate exposure to fire (which they weren\'t
equipped to survive) even though in some cases they were the better armed
ships. One Italian armourclad was eventually destroyed by a fire started
by sstrikes from an unarmoured Imperial frigate (which were deployed more
aggressively than their Italian counterparts).

  OTOH, the generally acknowledged supremacy of armour over guns of this
period did pass before long.

  What happens if the practice drone (err, pirate) with NO transponder meets
a patrol? (hint: target practice off the port bow, sir!). The desired effect
can be much more easily achieved using a ship\'s boat or armed pinnace,
especially
as non-starships (or at least small craft) may very well not be required to
use SDG transponders.

  In any case, where is the legal ship, what is it doing, who is paying for
its\' operations, and why the heck don\'t the anomalies indicated by these
questions get it flagged for some serious investigation?

Hm, I see a way out of the problem of dyslexic one-handed 14-year-old
streetkids with loads of skills.

Allow the base points for a character to be used in the normal way (skills
and attributes). Then allow \'customization\' as matching
advantages/disadvantages. Thus, you could chose "No Hangover" (5 points)
but would have to take a 5-point disadvantage to compensate. Disadvantage
points can\'t buy skills, just compensatory innate abilities.

Thus, if my character is Blind, I might well develop Acute Hearing and
Acute Smell, but wouldn\'t get Nuclear Engineering. (Making these up, as my
GURPS book is packed away in the "don\'t need it" book box.)

I agree with Dave on this.  If it wasn\'t for this "user unfriendly"
material I would have dropped Traveller long ago.  My first book was
High Guard, and it did NOT go into enough detail for me.  I disliked
Book 2 from the start.  and from the discussions on trav-tech there is a
need for a comprehensive vehicle design.  Although we should do our best
to make a fast/simple version for the basic rules.

Simple.  Every previous incarnation of Traveller included starship & star 
system generation rules as well as all the rules you need to have a standalone 
game.  GURPS doesn\'t do this.

The supplements to CT and MT (having practically *zero* experience with TNE 
and *absolutely* none with T4) were nice to have, but were not *necessary* for 
play as the basic set was standalone.  G:T is *NOT* standalone.  What is so 
difficult to understand here?

They weren\'t.  It was designed to be rules-heavy, where G:T isn\'t.

But the LBB\'s *created* the market for the supplements.  You didn\'t *need* 
them, but they *did* save a lot of time for busy GM\'s.  They were *nice* to 
have, but not really needed.  I run a PBEM set in 1126\'s Reavers\' Deep.  I 
don\'t need Spinward Marches or Solomani Rim except as deep background, if 
that.  I don\'t need either Library Data LBB\'s, but I have them anyways (I 
bought them when they were cheep).  I bought the original Striker cause I\'m an 
ex-wargammer by background.  I\'ve *yet* to use it for Traveller.  I\'ve bought 
ovr a couple dozen different JTAS\'es, Challanges, et all, not because I 
*needed* them, but because I *wanted* them to mine for ideas.

Not a bad analogy.  But in this case, this is the *first* Traveller incarnation that\'s been released that\'s *not* standalone.  It\'s a *supplement*.

Funny, I mentioned this a couple times when G:T was announced & got shot down for being negative...

Well, I don\'t have my book yet, but if we assume you are right.
Of course SJG is going to suggest all these other neat books
you can get.  They are interest in selling books!   <gasp!>
However, you definately don\'t need those books.

Not true at all.

It actually gets humorous when you are a GURPS player, everyone
who doesn\'t play the game telling you that you can\'t play like
you\'ve been doing for years.

Actually, GURPS Lite would probably get you as far as the
sketchy rules in the LBB\'s.  In any case, Basic and GT has
a lot more detail than the LLB\'s and actually background
info.

No.  You only need vehicles if you want to make no-space ship
vehicles.  You can get by fine without Space.

What you are doing is taking anything that the LLBs had that
GT doesn\'t have and assuming it to be required and taking
anything that GT has that the LLBs didn\'t have an ignoring it.
Yes, GT doesn\'t have world generation.  Does it have less than
the LLB\'s?  No!  It has more.  It has background
info, a sample race, etc.  If I was going to run a new adventure
I would have an easier time with GT and Basic (or even GURPS
Lite) than I would with the LLBs.

	I can\'t give you a reference off the top of my head but PGP *does*
use session keys. The public key crypto is extremely slow, so
encrypting the entire message would take forever. I believe the docs
I saw (PGP 2.6 docs, IIRC) also said IDEA was actually considered
more secure than RSA--just had the usual disadvantages of secret key
crupto. PGP generates a secret session key (2.6.3 and previous used
IDEA encryption, newer versions allow CAST, TripleDES or IDEA). The
session key is then encrypted using public key crypto, while the
message itself is encrypted with the session key. At the other end
the recipient decrypts the session key, then grabs the message. Two
advantages: the process is much faster, and the amount of data
encrypted with RSA (and hence vulnerable to cryptanalysis) is *very*
small.

	Not AS arbitrary--you did have the guidelines. All you had to do was
decide "Does this feel Simple, Routine, Difficult ..."--just by
whatever meaning you attached to the words, even--and everything fell

I do.  However, that is _not_ the premise behind point based
systems any more than picking a skill increase instead of a stat
increase for your term in Traveller character generation is based
on the premise that having a character who isn\'t as strong
make you learn faster.

YOu are given so much raw ability to work with.  One person
uses it to make a character stronger, another to make him
a better pilot, another to give him better vision.  That
is done to some degree or the other in every game system
I\'ve ever seen.

Now some people play it that you don\'t get points for disads.
If that floats your boat, then fine.  But it isn\'t "better",
it\'s just different.

   I\'m a little unclear why.  I for one do not have unlimited resources and
I\'m sure most of the people on this list don\'t either.  I own a couple of
GURPS products (the basic rule book and GURPS: Mecha).  I bought them
because they were *useful* to me.  I simply cannot afford to buy items,
regardless of "appeals to Traveller patriotism" I won\'t/can\'t use.  

   It would be far more preferable to appeal to people to at least look at
G:T and give it an honest appraisal.  Evaluate it like you would evaluate
any other Traveller product.  If it looks useful to you, buy it.

   You are unlikely to convert a GURPS player to any version of Traveller
game mechanics, particularly if they are already up to their eyeballs in
GURPS sourcebooks.  If you are lucky you will get some GURPS players to buy
CTMTTNET4 *in addition to* their GURPS stuff.  If you are really lucky, the
Zhodani, Hivers, et al. will become part of the GURPS lexicon in addition
to Illuminati, etc.

1st: IMTU, transponder logs are only legally downloadable by Imperial
Authorities (IN, IISS, IMOJ). Valid updates can be done by a liscenced
technician, who has a special chip which "Verifies" him via voice and
eyeprint, and brief interrogation, and verifies the information changes for
the transponder. It doesn\'t do more than give him the old data for his
verification of validity of the changes.

2nd: Big Brother is my entire approach to the late 3i: A very nearsighted,
nearly deaf Big Brother, who, once he notices you, can swat you like a bug.
Much is made of not attracting "Imperial Attention".... IMTU, the imperial
gov\'t tends not only to wait til the last minute to intervene, but to then
intervene with massive overkill. ForEx: a local balkanized world starts
using genocide very quietly, and the local ImpGov is kept in the dark. When
he finds out, the ImpMar invasion in force is the follow up to saturation
meson bombardment of all visible military targets in that local gov\'t,
followed by years of martial law, social engineering, and careful building
of dependancy upon imperial authority. Marine-run Martial law is harsh, but
the trains run on time and the streets are clean, and free private speech
is tolerated in small groups... Marine Martial law generally runs about
LL9-10... even if the listed LL is different.

As for getting the info: you must fool a sapient being, while using a
non-human language, requireing acess to databases and metahuman
mathematics, and then be able to know the verifications for the sequences
requested. In general, they data is only available to the ImpGov WHEN THEY
SIEZE your ship... altho a txpdr might rat you out. Yes, it is a spy. Yes,
it will tattle.

<mt task>
To fool a transponder into giving you milspec data:
	Formidable, Computer, Pursuasion, Fateful. On a mishap, it will
scream constantly until a liscenced tech tells it to shut up, and give all
the data it can on the perp.
</mt task>

It is more likely for the Zhodani or Solomani to get the info than an
imperial corporation. IMTU, the IISS-IntelOff and the ImpNavSecur agegency
handle transponder data. Transponder programmers are all on the "Never
Retire" list... they may go to a retirement center, where they are treated
as little better than foreign spies, or may be voluntarily brain-wiped, but
they do not ever get out of the service alive with their knowedge intact.
Standiong orders are Prevent their capture; if captured, exterminate them
before they can spill the beans.

IMTU, the imperium IS ruthless. No gentle trade association, it fosters
free trade so as to foster a stable tax base from which to perpetuate its
self. It protects Sapient rights only so that sapients will be ablke to
work and pay taxes, and maintain order. Truth be told, the imperium
couldn\'t care less about Jack being killed by Jill, save that it defines
Murder as a crime so that members will join. All the benefits are merely
there to get members to stay members, so that the Imperium gets its taxes.

Still IMTU, the Imperium actually likes small local warfare, as war does
stimulate economies. In certain areas, the ImpNav will infiltrate and START
a local wwar to foster economic and technological development, and to force
local tensions to come ouit into the open.

The imperium really doesn\'t even care about piracy, either... they stop
major rings, because major rings can take on tax convoys and naval
units.... One or two shiup bands are nuisances who may be ignored while not
being too blatant, and conscripted (and paid) when needed for BadWar.
Likewise, large bands provide good practice for real war....

As far as others getting the data, the ImpNav doesn\'t care, as most of the
data can be accumulated in other wAys.... usually easier, too.

Very fine idea, I recognise the p[roblem.  Some sort of ON THE BRIDGE rules
to keep people involved, otherwise a small ship has little to offer a group
of adventurers in combat.  Maybe it shouldn\'t (BL is very much a wargame,
howvere good it is), but some more detauil fdor this might be good or make
it impossible.

Phil, thinking back to the days of the XBoat list, I recall we have very
different approaches to rules, and have had several discussions along that
line over the past few years... One of my biggest gripes about many game
systems is a consitant and memorable task system not being present. You
write some of the best background I\'ve read... Armageddon/Starplay is
wonderful... but the things about it that remind me of MT are the same
things I liked about MT: consistant number of dice thrown, a defined task
system that is memorable and easy to explain, background generated as part
of CGen....

and yes, it boils down to personal preference. In traveller, I use MT,
since all I use is in the 4 books: PM, RM, IE, and Ref\'sComp. That is all I
"Need" to run MT. I like having the DGP stuff, too, and FSotSI I find
useful(even if it is brioken and wrong in places...). TNE didn\'t appeal to
me, nor, for that matter did 2nd ed T2K appeal to me over 1st ed. Both the
background changes and the rules mechanics, in both cases.... But MT
integrate Striker and CT, made a few additions, and gave me exactly what
I\'d spent 2 years trying to do: use striker combat with Trav Damage. Hell,
I think I\'m beginning to ramble.

So, no matter what, Phil (and everyone else), no matter how assertively I
advance my opinion, no personal offence is meant.

how different game design is now from when the LBB\'s came out.

Back then, basic sets were rules mechanics, usually devoid of background.
Settings were all supplements. Examples: D&D vs Greyhawk; Runequest vs
Glorantha; Space Opera vs the various sector books; CT.

Now, most games are over  50% background material, and usually about 30%
Cgen, and the other 20% being the rules mechanics. Perfect examples are
WoD (Vampire, Mage, Werewolf, etc), Fading Suns, SLA industries.


MT was mostly rules and CGen, with about 30% of the base three books being
background; about normal for that era (85-90).

TNE was about the same... but slightly more space on CGen IIRC.

2300ad, like MT, was tied to its\' setting in CGen, but easily divorceable.

In 1st ed of CORPS, the author note that it was the first time he\'d written
a game with more space on background than on rules....

You\'re getting into areas in which YOU have ZERO practical knowledge.  Dont\'
watch so many movies, Chuck.  I am a current (and damned good, if I say so
myself) M1A1 US Marine tank crewman.  And we\'ve been trained plenty in MOUT
operations.  Its done in conjuction w/ grunts and aviation (especially attack
helos).  Manueverability is limited, but your sniper better damned well stay
out of sight and mind of 1) all the tanks in teh vicinity (typically a tank
element is attached to an infantry platoon.  Tank element = 2 tanks, wingman-
leader concept) and 2) all the grunts and 3) the best protection against
snipers IS snipers (especially of USMC Scout/Sniper variety).  Overlapping
fields of observation and responsibility are a reality for tank platoons and
companies.  Sniper gets discovered, he (and the building he\'s in) is either
gonna be eating a 120mm HEAT round, white or red phosphorus, .50 cal, 7.62,
and/or anything the grunts want to throw his way (5.56, 40mm grenades, 7.62,
etc etc)... most likely a combo of all of the above. if we don\'t simply to
decide to thoroughly wreck (arty/air) a dangererou area to begin with.

If we\'re just rolling through, recon will make sure the path is clear of major
obstructions and we just roll through buttoned up.

LOL.  Get real.  Not so black and white there, you.  Like the entire
population is somehow going to be completely and totally at odds w/ the govt
and military.  Not in the US of today, anyways.  There\'d be at least a
fraction of "brown shirts," if not active endorsement and support by certain
significant segments of teh general population.

I know of noone on this list advocating that sort of BB.  You and Hans both

The Imperium is not about capitalism but controlling its territory and

thought of Cleon as someone w/ great vision and charisma, not of the Bill
Gates stripe presented in M:0.  The Pacification Campaigns and Solomani Rim
both come to mind.

If the players don\'t have full TL-15 facilities at their disposal and the
basic knowledge of the principals of the black box, it is *impossible.*  If
they do have all those things, they can try.  *My* players are unlikely to get
full TL-15 facilities being in the TL12 Reformation Coalition for transponders
that aren\'t used anymore.

It would\'ve been a hierarchy of difficulties.  Only by getting by *all* of
them, would it be at all *possible* (though still unlikely).  First they would
need to know whats in the black box.  Unknown to the general populace.  Next,
they need to be able to "forge" the BB (the chips inside actually).  Cloning a
chip will mean it hasn\'t evolved/mutated over the time since the originals\'
creation, but just since it\'s been cloned, and will produce a false squawk.
"The chips were not bred for full independant intelligence, but rather to
respond in a sophisticed fashion in a few prescribed areas.  These areas were
the ability to communicate with each other, to exchange and update
information, and, most importantly, to recognize other sibling chips as
authentic unaltered, untampered members of their specific strain.  By
additionally limiting the chips to only receiving new information from other
authenticated sibling chips, the information loop could be sealed to exclude
counterfeit data."  SM pg 69

That speed will not continue.  It is "canon" that tech slows down big time and

As has been pointed out by other people, in other posts, encryption is ahead
of decryption right now and it\'s more than plausible that it can be that way a
few thousand years in the future.  How could a miniature fb system be spoofed?
If a ping is missed (because the physical line connecting the black box w/ the
commo and/or main comp is broken and a set number of pings aren\'t received,
that fires the anti-tamper circuit.  How is false info fed into that sort of
system?  Now, extrapolate for a meson or neutrino pinging system of some
sort...

Again, computational power will not continue to double every 18 months (or
even every 18 years) according to how tech advancement canonically flattens
out.  Even if the key can be forged, which is debatable, how is it inputed
into a physically connected system (fb in this case)?

What does that have to do w/ anything?  I\'m sure a silicone based life-form

That it can "feel" what a comp system "feels" like.  And that sort of fine-

Tollerance?  lol.  It\'s the *Thought processes" of the chip that convince
other chips of authenticity, not the specifics of what\'s in the chatter, but
the way the chatter is formed.  Think more of random synapse firing, etc
rather than predictable and stable

The burden to disprove is on you.  I don\'t have to prove anything.  The Deyo
transponders are *Official* whether you like it or not.  The operations and
theory behind them are described in some detail, but the tech behind them is
unexplored (in reality because the writers weren\'t from the 57th century).
How can you disprove something that isn\'t detailed?  You can\'t.  The "tamper
circuit" is presented as a given factor.

According to how *you* interpret it.  But of course, being a (20th century)
EE, you know what\'s going to be possible in electronics in 3600 years, don\'t
you?  Right.  : )  Nanee nah nee nah nah!  Any other EEs on the list?  It is

lol.  They\'re two seperate things.  Virus is the electronic meta-identity that
inhabits the chips.  But it is *not* just the chip.  Virus is a whole \'nuther
program (A TL16-17 to be precise, which matches canon: true AI being TL16-17).

It would depend on how computers work in the 57th century.  TL13+ computer
cores 
have organic cores and synaptic processing?  There may well not be an iotia of
current computer componets and elements in there.  How does that work?  lol.
