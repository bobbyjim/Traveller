You noticed that?  : )  Called the "politicians" by Harold Hale\'s "Clans of
the TML" (http://members.aol.com/travelrtne/tml98.txt).  Hey Harold, you out
there?  Bout time for a \'99 version, no?  Probably the Cycles of T4 are gone,
replaced w/ the nascent G:T\'ers...

Clif does need more tact (and this from me! <g>), but there are many people
who can\'t seem to wait to flame him and are just as guilty as he is of any
misconduct.

<<Politicians - Throw 100 percent of their support online behind whatever
the current system is this week.  Never hold a controversial opinion,
and constantly suck up to Marc and or Loren.  When asked what their
favorite version of Traveller is will respond, "all of them".  Evades
questions on what they actually use to role-play--they probably don\'t.>>

> >He asked "what sucks about GT?"

Ahem.  It\'s this same attitude that manifested w/ IG at first.  Unless GT
reverses its editing problems, IMO it\'ll end up in the same place as T4 after
the initial excitement wears down.  I, for one, hope it doesn\'t happen as I\'m
looking forward for GT to get done rehashing the LBBs and to get on w/
adventures and unveiling it\'s mysteries.

The GT partisans will ooh and aah over every other product unless they get
burned by something of Starships or First Survey caliber.  Having people say
their books are falling apart would probably rate "suck" too, though thats a
problem that\'s probably not confined to G:T.  *My* books are holding up fine,
but that\'s because I rarely crack the cover on them (as opposed to things I
open almost daily, or twice daily like PoT or FF&S which are holding up fine,
though there\'s whitening on corners, etc), and why I\'m consequently going to
be reviewing GT books very carefully from now on before I buy.

Good ghul, Doug, you and everyone else knew damned well what Clif was asking.
And that was what\'s wrong w/ GT.  You wanna flame him, fine, but don\'t pretend
it\'s anything but that with the rest of us.  And really don\'t get peeved when
he hits back. 
It\'s all pretty entertaining to me (comments along the lines of "You can
overthrow the govt by yourself?  You got Superman Underoos or something?" or
the Sympathies and where they go on toilet paper make me ROFL).  Damn, what
was the latest one... can\'t remember... i\'m gonna have to start collecting a
"Clif anthology."

I think you plonked him anyways.

Dulinor was made archduke in 1104 according to MT Players Manual and Survival
Margin.  He assassinates Strephon 12 years after that in the official
universe/timeline, during which he repeatedly made "public statements" of his
dissatisfaction and chafing with the nobility/old guard.

Who says?  I\'m not trying to be argumentative, but why couldn\'t this exact
same debate have happened in the official universe somewhere between 1104 and
1115?  He certainly was "fighting the conservative elements of the Imperial
society and the vastness of the Imperium iteself.  His own public statements
during the period reflected a growing bitterness and disaffection with the
empire and with its emperor."  -MT Players Manual, pg 75.   

What i\'m trying to say is that this very debate doesn\'t need to be by
psuedonym (though could be as a form of "username" type thing on the Xmail, i
guess) but could be one notable instance of Dulinor\'s "public statements,"
like the Federalist Papers aren\'t the only instance of the fueding between
what would be the Federalists and Democratic-Republicans.

Diplomacy, politics, and a pure duty to his subjects (which Norris, like
Craig, valued higher than the Imperium and Strephon) would necessitate there
not be a pure "blackout" of even attempts at some form of dialogue/treaty.
Dulinor\'s territory (though Strephon\'s even moreso) provides a possible
connection of at least trade (the lifeblood of Traveller interstellar
economics) at least, and maybe even with the core regions of the Imperium.
Vland falls through with fighting in Corridor.  For whatever reason.  Strephon
doesn\'t connect either... Going through the Islands only requires adding a
couple deep space stations IIRC and connects somewhere in Reft, pretty much
right between Dulinor and Strephon.   

Of course, as is my tendancy, I\'d probably say there was a dialogue and some
limited contact, but never materialized fully, for numerous reasons.  Arrival
Vengeance *should* still have at least tried a diplomatic call.  Especially if
they were to go to on Lucan, of all factions.  This is easily rectified by
doing a scenario in Illelish.

Well, canon to me has always been solely the "historical" events of Imperial
Space.  These I consider inviolable and vehemently oppose any tinkering with.
Nothing to do with interpolations from character generation, half thought
comments in limited publications, etc or the mechanics of the game rules and
design systems.  If the background says something, then the game rules should
justify it.  If the game rules don\'t, then they\'re wrong and shouldn\'t impact
"canon."  This smoothes over the issue of the mixed mechanics lot we are, too.
:-)

I much prefer an advancing background of some kind rather than going sideways
through the "possibilities," though their use could make for quite an
interesting "sliders" type adventures or even campaign.  That\'s one thing I
like about Traveller so much, the progression from stable (or stale) Imperium
of original Traveller to the Shattered Imperium/succession war, and then the
aftermath and the polities and interactions that come after the great empire
is gone.  That smacks of real life.  Of real history.  Now many hated to see
it happen, but nothing stops them from playing in the "good ol days" but if
everything is confined to the good ol days, I\'m just plain not interested in
what\'s unusable in the New Era, just as the old timers aren\'t interested in my
setting.  Perhaps GDWs mistake was not in doing the New Era, but in not
providing any "historical" type supplements with a basis in the "good ol days"
but with notes (or even a section) on how the same subject in the New Era that
would\'ve been usable to both settings.  Course, if GDW hadn\'t fell (and taken
TNE w/ it), they might well have, though it\'s probably kind of doubful.   

I hope the SAEPs of T5 arent\' as exclusive.  Seems to me, it\'s the only way to
hold on the interests of existing players, while reaching out to the newbies.
In fact, maybe a classic/New Era approach is how it should go?  Put the
setting at 1111/1201 for the classic/New Era sections.  The classic section
could fill out the events and history of 1110-1116 better (6 years can draw
out a whole lot of supplements).  The 1201 could advance the Reformation
Coalition/Regency/Pocket Empires.

Yep. It is a reasonable question. The conversational tone is fine. However,
the flak he received was because he became abusive and insufferable when
people responded with what they liked.

It\'s a pattern. He gets abusive and nasty in nearly any discussion he\'s
involved with. People explained, some politely and some not so, that perhaps
he should have phrased his original question in a more concise matter. Seems
simple enough a concept...

Nope. He\'s getting the flak for his abusive followup. It\'s a predictable
pattern. Clif says something. People respond, usually politely. Clif gets
mad because he didn\'t get what he wanted when he wanted and he throws and
abusive temper tantrum.

Nope. I\'ve said from the beginning that Clif should deal with himself and
learn how to deal with people in a relatively polite manner. It used to be
that only certain topics would blow up into nastiness, after weeks and weeks
of discussion.

Clif has accelerated this to the point that most of the discussions he gets
involved with go down the tubes within a few days.

Yes, discuss. Not whine and become abusive every time you phrase a question
incorrectly and don\'t get the answers you want. It\'s not a forum to insult
people based on their religious beliefs.

I have considered the supposed principles of free speech, at great length.
Do you want *free speech* or *devalued speech*? Think about that for a few
minutes.

In this super technological society; 10,000 legislatures IS workable, though I
agree that a much smaller number is easier. If you do remember; I DID say a
pyramidal structure. At the Imperial level; you would only need AT MOST, 432
senators at one per subsector. Note that since many sectors have less than 16
Imperial subsectors; there are actually less senators needed. As for
Congressmen/women; if you assign one per 20 billion persons; you would only
need  788 representatives (figures as per the Second Imperial Grand Survey,
1065).  The Solomani Rim sector would have 12 Senators and 80
Congressmen/women at the Imperial level. This is hardly unworkable. At the
sector level, there would be a Sector governor as chief executive, and a
sector congress. This is repeated at the subsector and world level...At each
level the second house of congress (the population based representives) would
represent less people.

This is true, but to paraphrase an ancient Terran 2-D holovid (Spartacus) "I

but I won\'t stand for the Tyranny of Crassus and his "new order". I trust to
the people to pick their own leaders, and the IMJ to police these leaders when
they break the law....

<<It is a comforting conceit among those in popular societies that aristocrats

I never said that. I pointed out that since they are not answerable to the
people; they are at LEAST as open to corruption as elected officials. I have
lost count of the times  I have learned of Nobles who are also owners and/or
CEOs of megacorporations manipulating Imperial law or even openly breaking it
to get their company an advantage (and incidentally making them obscene
amounts of money). This kind of rot brought down the Roman republic/Empire as
surely as her moral rot of agressive wars and slavery...

<<<But there are thousands of examples of vibrant, long-lived

Also,
 democratic societies are not necessarily more humane or intelligent than
 aristocratic ones.  Since you are fond of Ancient Terra, look at the conflict
 between the early states of Athens and Sparta.  The Athenians were
democartic,
 yet they were arrogant, wasteful, foolish, tyrannical to their allies,
 merciless to their enemies and eventually lost the war.  The Spartans were
 aristocratic, yet individually they were widely known as honest, courageous
 and virtuous.  The Spartans treated their allies well and were merciful to
 their enemies, and in the end spared defeated Athens, when the rest of Greece
 demanded its destruction.>>>

A country is only as good as its\' people. There is nothing to prevent a
dictatorship from being moral, but this is dependent on the honesty of the
despot. At the same time it\'s possible for a democratic nation to become
morally bankrupt. The difference is that it\'s a lot harder for an entire
nation\'s voting population becoming evil (who would then presumably elect evil
rulers...), than it is for an elite who has control over a voiceless minority,
to become evil... As for using the city state of Athens as a representative
democracy; this example is flawed. The voting population was so small (free
males...) that it was more properly an oligarchy...Representative democracies
tend to muddle through despite themselves (they ARE designed via checks and
balances to be in some sort of conflict to prevent lock step oligarchism...)
via the concept of "Enlightened Self Interest". That is the common sense of
the electorate to pick leaders who will govern well....

As a quick note, apparently, if your book falls apart you can send it in and
get a replacement from SJG. When they do get books from the printer that
fall apart, they don\'t deal with the same printers again.

Of course, you should check before sending, but this was their policy as of
at least a few weeks ago.

No, I didn\'t, because he was using English in a new way.

Let me explain what "sucks."

Cancer sucks.  Knowing that I have a 20% chance of living to fifty without
a reoccurance sucks.

I don\'t have time to be so negative.

I have problems with G:T.  *None* of them are so bad that I would not
recommend these products to friends.  I am also concerned about the
editing, and can only hope that SJG loosens the policy of shoving something
out the door by the deadline, no matter what.  The Imperial/American units
really bug me, in spite of the fact that I deal in them daily, it\'s easier
for me to use the metric system for Traveller.  The bindings on my books
seem to be fine, even on BTC, which gets the heavist us by far.

Those are my problems with GURP: Traveller.  I have a couple of problems
with GURPS itself, mostly concerning the pacing of combat and the large
number of advantages that seem to duplicate one another.

>I think you plonked him anyways.  

Nope, just ignoring him on the TML.  Right now, I don\'t have anyone in the
killfile and the only subject I\'m killing is the Debate thread which I\'m
really not interested in.

Sorry for the bitter tone, but I\'m having a really bad week.

Amusing story.

Last summer we had some friends form Australia visit for two weeks.  First
time in America, so we did the full tour of San Francisco, including going
to a Giants-Dodgers (spit) game.  For those of you who are not baseball
fans, there is a traditional called the seventh inning stretch.  Halfway
through the seventh inning, as the teams are changing sides, everyone
stands up and sings "Take Me Out To The Ballgame."

One of the lines is:

"So it\'s root, root, root for the hometeam..."

Imagine our shock when our friends went purple and explodied laughing.
Once they could breathe again, they explained how "root" is used as verb
down under.

Kirsten and I can\'t sing that song anymore, and I understand they have a
new code-word for sex.  "Care for a seventh-inning stretch, love?"

"Ahem.  It\'s this same attitude that manifested w/ IG at first.  Unless GT
reverses its editing problems, IMO it\'ll end up in the same place as T4
after
the initial excitement wears down.  I, for one, hope it doesn\'t happen as
I\'m
looking forward for GT to get done rehashing the LBBs and to get on w/
adventures and unveiling it\'s mysteries."

Steve Jackson Games does something that IG did not do; they CORRECT mistakes
in their books in subsequent printings. This is not cheap to do, by the way,
but they do it. Editing errors such as the missing stuff in BTC WILL be
corrected when the book is reprinted and meanwhile will be covered in freely
available errata. This is far more than IG ever did, and is why GT will not
go the way of T4. I am not advocating ignoring flaws in the products, but
the term "sucks", as I and most people I know have used it, goes beyond
minor complaints; if I were to say "Classic Traveller sucks", this implies a
far greater criticism than just saying "Classic Traveller has errors" or "I
don\'t like Classic Traveller."

Also, complaints about the physical qualities of the books are not
universal. I have both a softcover and hardcover copy, which has stood up to
repeated openings, closing and game use just fine. SOME people are having
problems with their copies, not ALL people, and has been noted, SJ Games
will replace those books; they have done so with other GURPS books for me; I
once got a Bestiary missing one chapter and repeating another; they replaced
it.

The problem is not the question per se. The problem as has been stated
before is Clif\'s RESPONSE to that question. It was offensive, uncalled for,
and happens all too often.

I\'ve been waiting...and waiting...you get the picture.

I haven\'t seen a post from Scott for years. Is he still about at

YES. This is a collapsible fuel tank module suitable for use in cargo
holds (with water or LHyd), etc (stats for the option were drawn from
the excellent Vehicles additions by Lloyd on io.com. Each module when
collapsed takes up 1/40 of its loaded volume, so a 40 space collapsible
tank is only 1 space when collapsed. On the down side, stresses > 1.5G
can cause the tank to rupture (with predictable results), though this
isn\'t really a problem with the prevalence of artifical grav/grav
compensation and the generally slower acceleration of the ships that
would use this feature.

Fellow sophonts, Stuart is absolutely correct.
I\'ve combined Jim Vassilakos\' Galactic 2.4 with
output from Stuart\'s software and the results are
fantastic.

With these two packages, a GM can create a _highly_
detailed *sector* in about 2.5 hours. Details include
orbital path maps of all bodies in each star system,
main world temperature charts, encounter charts,
ground and space military organizations, population
profiles, economic profiles, and technological
profiles by industry.

I\'m talking building something like the Spinward
Marches from scratch with all the details from 
World Builders\' Handbook, Psionic Institutes, and
Imperial Fleets for _every_ system in *2.5 hours*.

YMMV depending on how fast you can link Stuart\'s
output files to the appropriate systems in
Galactic 2.4. In the space of one weekend, you
can build enough star system background for
a multi-year (realtime) Traveller campaign.

Spend 4 weekends on it, and we\'re talking an
entire *Domain*!

And to top it all off, both software packages are
free and both Jim and Stuart appreciate and
listen to feedback.

People, it can\'t get better than this. The *only*
downside is both packages are for the PC only.

Megajoules and megawatt-seconds are the same thing.  Still, it probably should
have been changed to be megawatt-seconds, for consistency with standard
Vehicles usage.

Well, yes, but except for Strephon, and later Norris, nobody knew
this for sure.  Treat my statement about Strephon dying in the
TNE line as being shorthand for the attempted assassination and
all of the following events in that timeline, and "Strephon\'s
Assassination" in terms of the POD to refer to Dulinor\'s
murdering of the double.

Actually at http://www.cybergoths.u-net.com/RPS.html

The page got knackered when I rebuilt the BITS site and lost some of the
graphics. I need to get my archive CD out and restore it, but you can
download Metator there. It will probably transfer to the main BITS pages
soon, or I may rebuild \'cybergoths\' completely.

Metator is an excellent program, hopefully(ie I hope) the next after the

Rob, sorry the page is bollixed.

	You have proposed an Imperium-wide Congress with 788 representatives each
representing 20 billion people.   This you would call a "democratic system."
Just how responsible can a representative be to 20 billion people on a dozen
worlds?  This would be even more of an oligarchy than the Athenian system you
label with that term.   In Athens, even if you could not vote, you had access
to hundreds of people every day who actually made the laws and spent the
public money.  In your system, sure every few years everyone who can breathe
and walk around could cast a vote, but what is it\'s impact among 20 billion
others?  Presumably, based on past examples, illiterates, the feebleminded and
the mad would also be allowed to vote, thus diluting further the votes cast.
	How much more responsive is a noble, sitting on planet, whose children,
grandchildren and other descendants, most of whom will not inherit a noble
patent, he will expect to live on the world and reap the results of his
policies, than a politician, sitting in a distant Senate, whose only thought
is the next election!  A republic of some sorts is fine for a local continent
or perhaps a whole world, but the shear staggering size of our Imperium makes
one absolutely, of necessity, unresponsive and unrepresentative in any real
sense.  
	
				The Old Marquis

P.S.  That old terran 2-D vid was a slander to old Crassus, by the way.
Crassus in fact restored much of the powers stripped away from the common
people by Sulla, such as the tribune\'s right of veto.   It was only Crassus
that kept Pompey and Caesar from attempting to seize sole power as long as
they did.  But, the enemy of Spartacus just HAD to be the worst guy
imaginable, don\'t you know.  Finally, your quotation was put in the mouth of a
man named Gracchus, who was the "people\'s champion" in the movie, but was in
fact dead 60 years before the Spartacus revolt.

My version (from UK) is _not_ metric.

That works for \'dramatic\' situations where  distances  are  loose
definitions ... but designing grav tanks using GURPS Vehicles can
be a real pain.  There units are  more  precise,  and  having  to
convert everything from yesteryear\'s units to today\'s as well  is
tedious.

Trivia: So-called 15mm scale deck plans use  half  inch  squares,
while 25mm scale deck plans use one  inch  squares.  So  I  guess
that means that 2 x 15 = 25 !!!

Same thing.

Joules are energy, watts are power. Multiply power by time and you have
energy, so a watt-second is the same thing as a joule.

Here is my task system.  It is, as always, work in progress so feedback
would be appreciated.
GURPS Task System
Task Levels	Modifier	Auto
Very easy	+6		10
Simple	 	+3		13
Routine		+1		15
Standard	0		16
Involved	-1		17
Difficult	-3		19
Ambitious	-6		22
Formidable	-9		25
Absurd		-12		28
Near-Impossible	-18		31

Auto is the minimum skill for automatic success at a normal level.  This
is to make the task system semi-diceless.  The player can always opt to
roll with the full range of success or failure.

Success Degrees		Target	Degree	Notes
Absolute Failure	-6	-3	things are now worse from the attempt.(UM 18)

Total Failure		-3	-2	failure, no doubt about	it. Check determination.

Partial Failure		-1	-1	almost successful but bears no fruit.

Marginal Success	+-0	0	the attempt works just barely.

Adequate Success	+1	+1	normal level of success.

Complete Success	+3	+2	success with a competitive edge.

Exceptional Success	+6	+3	success well beyond the norm.

Phenomenal Success	+12	+4	critical success. (UM 3)
* The damage system is still being worked out.  The system will
determine damage based on the degree of success.

Degrees of success are used in some contests of skill, uncertain tasks,
as well as any task that needs a sort of \'yardstick\'.

Uncertain Tasks: Both the GM and the player roll vs. the skill.  The GM
compares the degrees of success in both rolls.   If both degrees are
positive or negative then take the more extreme of the two.  If the
degrees are opposite in polarity then add them.  This will determine the
actual degree of success.

Actually, it appears to be handled in the same way as equipment:  it\'s
something you buy.  Similarly, the reference to the GM awarding it to
PCs is not quantified, as Advantages are.  (Presumably the GM would
award TAS membership to military PCs in much the same way that he/she/it
would "award" profits to a successful merchant PC.)

Actually, given that Thomas has been waiting six months for his license, I
think that it just goes to show what happens when a company finally gets
serious about their licensing. 

I\'m lucky, it only took me two months to settle everything, and thanks to
Reese, Steve, and Marc being willing to discuss matters by email we were
able to get the legal issues of a product licensed for a licensed product
sorted out without trouble, even with the added complication of a British
company distributing a Canadian product licensed from an American company.

Anyway, now the SJG has got their licensing back on track, I suspect
you\'ll see more products soon.


Hm, it might be a good idea if authors would post what they\'re working on,
so that we don\'t end up with accidental duplication. Personally, if I knew
that a good author was working on a shipyard program for my computer
platform, I\'d work on something else. While this doesn\'t seen to affect me
(\'cause I think I\'m the only Mac programmer here), it does affect the PC
types.  (Actually, it also affects me, because I _sell_ my software, so
less point in my arranging for a PC port if there\'s another product out
there.)

I\'ve had a speadsheet done since November last year, which has now been
expanded with GURPS Vehicles rules to allow for alternate hulls (per GT
rules), modules for all TLs (8-13), beam and sensor/EW design pages,
etc.  Ultimately it will also have complete Vehicles design options so I
can whack together any type of GURPS Vehicle.

Unfortunately, one look at the contract required with SJG discouraged me
from releasing the whole kit as freeware (like Andrew\'s FFS2 sheet)...Ah
well...at least _I_ can use it :)

I like it..I also like the option of using Vehicles design rules.

My suggestion is to down load the free "lite" version (maybe even
play a game with it) and see if you like it.  That will tell you
more than any persons individual likes and dislikes....

[I must say, the idea that you _have_ to buy so many books
is amusing to those of us who had no problem playing the game
before they were even thought off...]

The point is that it is intended to be done realistically.
The Zhodani should open fire from some distance (so they
have a decent chance of missing).  The characters then dive
into the hole as shots land around them (like in the movies :-)

At least that is what I did when I ran the adventure under
GURPS rules...

Regarding canon stuff.  GURPS didn\'t try and match every
thing exactly how the CT rules did (otherwise there is no
point in a new set of rules).  However, the authors were
well aware of Traveller material (they are have almost all
been either ex-GDW writters or long time players themselves).
There have been a few judgement calls about what to keep
from canon (which have been the subject of some debate in
playtest...)

You can lower the cost of ST, though it turns out not to be a big
deal either way...

However, HT is deceptive.  You don\'t roll against it that often,
but when you do (like when you want to see if you are going to die
from that wound) it is important.  My players all gave HT a sort
shrift until a few of them died...

I agree, two lasers, going on the illo - appears to be a waist-mounted gun

Hadn\'t noticed that, but I agree.

The (absolutely excellent!) RCVG dose it much better. I remember now that I
flipped between the heavy grav tank and the Norris a few times, just to try
and get a handle on the size difference. However, the thirty-ton recovery
sled takes the prize - it fits AROUND the 20-ton heavy tank! (Aside: does
anyone else think the sled bears a vague resemblance to Thunderbird 2?!!

Stuart,
	I am sure that I speak for all of those interested in the WebSector
project, by saying that we would be happy to add you and your expertise
to the effort.

	I will setup a mailing list for this project on ONEList.com.  I will
then send the invitation to this list for anyone else who may be
interested.  I don\'t mind being the list owner/operator, but I do not
want to be the project\'s front man.  This really should be a group
effort, and not have one (extremly) busy man to be at the forefront when
I could be pulled out for any number of reasons.

	Don\'t get me wrong, but I am very interested in seeing this project
succeed; I also want to be a contributor to the effort, but I cannot
commit to any heavy project management functions at the moment.  Once I
do have my pipe for the ISP business, I will also offer the function of
hosting all of this project as well as anything else others would like
to be hosted as well - As long as it is traveller related.

	I think that it would be a monumental effort to get things centralized
on one server, or at least mirrored.  That would certainly make HIWG CD
creation a great deal easier as well.  We should be able to start that
side project on or before May 1 1999.  The ISP company os a tier 2
provider, hooked directly to the largest and most stable internet
backbone in the industry - UUNet!  There will be more about this when we
get closer to turn up time.

Thanks for your help,
Scott Spieker

Put ../ in front of the file name, as required.

For example, Scott\'s left-hand frame contains the following code:
<BODY  BACKGROUND="../Tab_bg.gif" LINK="#0000FF" VLINK="#990000"
TEXT="#000000" TOPMARGIN=0 LEFTMARGIN=0 MARGINWIDTH=0 MARGINHEIGHT=0>

This indicates (among other things!) that the background gif is in the
previous (higher) directory. If you like, take a look thru my Library Data
to see how my links are structured. My site map goes something like this:
     /libdata
          /alphabet
               /a
                    aslan.htm
               /b
               :
               /z
          /pictures
               /libdata
                    aslan.gif

To get aslan.gif to display in aslan.htm, the reference in aslan.htm is:
     <IMG SRC="../../pictures/libdata/aslan.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>

That is, go up one level to /alphabet, up another level to /libdata, then
back down through /pictures and /libdata to find the picture!

  IIRC it was clarified that they meant that _if_ a non-English language
European edition was done (e.g., German) then it would use metric. At the
time some of us thought they were referring to a UK version and asked if
we could get that instead of the US one :)

software, etc.

I think what we need right now, however, is a Very Simple
proof of concept.  Might I suggest a hand-detailed page of
basic system information, including hard-coded links to the
xboat route neighbors?  The fun stuff can be attached at leisure;
but let\'s just get something up now.  Is that okay?  If we get
enough volunteers, we can string our sites out across Deneb,
into the Marches, Corridor, and Reft...

Yep, this is a _pain_, as 15mm figures look way too big on all the
published "15mm" deckplans (ditto the 25mm). I resorted to drawing things
on 5mm grid sheets (readily available over here, don\'t know about the US or

As for the 20 billion size representatives being unworkable; then there is
only one alternative; Decentralization. Delegate as much working power as
possible to as low a level as possible. Think of it as an Archduke-Domain
style of governance, but with the leaders elected, instead of being appointed
by the Emperor. Try to keep as much action decision-making, and policy
enforcement at the sector and sub-sector level as possible, and leave major
policy-making to the Domain governors (such as maintaining the Imperial fleets
in the sector). Thus the Imperial senate and President would just have to
concentrate on macro-policy at the Imperial level, and making sure that the
Domains (who in turn oversee the sectors who oversee the subsectors, etc...)
don\'t violate the Imperial constitution. Keeping as much power as local as
possible was the political philosophy of "States\' rights". This was the failed
arguement of the "states rights" faction of the United States. The strong
central government faction was able to prevail once rapid communication made
its\' presence felt. Since the Imperium doesn\'t have such rapid comminication,
perhaps the decentralised government of the "States rights" faction would be
more logical...

Clif; give the man a break. He was happy that somebody these days are talking
about political theory (ala The Federalist Papers). Comparing those debates
(and the people who wrote them) to the drivel spouted by both parties today is
like comparing a comic book to Shakespeare...BTW; have you been reading the
on-line Traveller psuedo "Federalist Papers" debate?

Actually, tell him to get his students to play Traveller. ;-)

No, really, if it\'s presented as a game, it may generate more student
interest. Set up the situation (maybe even as a freeform) and have both
sides argue it out.  A bit like setting up a mock courtroom or parliament -
I\'ve heard reports of schools running events like this. Just make sure he
lets us know the results!

Over here, the current flavour-of-the-month is the republican debate. ;-)

That might have been me.  Except for a couple of posts in the last week, I
haven\'t posted since well before Christmas :)

The idea came from-- ugh-- Warhammer 40K.  Here\'s the skinny:

Take a square piece of clear plastic.  Divide it into a checkerboard
pattern with eleven squares along each side.  Along to top scribe the
numbers 2 thru 12, and do the same on the left side from top to bottom.
What you now have is a grid system that-- using two 2D6 dice rolls-- can
model (with a certain degree of accuracy) the deviation from the center
square [7,7].  2D6 works well because of the natural "bell curve".

The template would be placed over a silhouette of the target, bearing in
mind the aspect of the target character (a number of cards depicting
various aspects and silhouettes would be needed).  Aim for the head and you
have a good chance of firing high or to the sides, while an aimed shot to
the chest will have to deviate by quite a bit in order to completely miss.
You may have to experiment with the sizes of the template and the
silhouette cards.  To-Hit tasks may also need to be made slightly easier,
since most of the time grid coordinates resulting in "auto misses" would
exist.

Something along the lines of "the amount that the To-Hit task succeeded by
may be counted off to shift the actual grid results closer to the center of
the template" should also be included.  For example, if the character
succeeded in the task by 4 points and the target rolls were 11 across and 6
down (ie: grid location [11,6]), the player could count off four squares
down and arrive at location [7,6] or count off three squares down and one
right to arrive at location [8,7].  As long as the shifts moved the
coordinates closer to the center square [7,7], everything\'s legal.  Tiny
arrows could be included to dictate the various "legal" directions.

The trick would be to include these two 2D6 dice rolls into the game so
that they don\'t become "yet *another* dice roll task that slows down the
game".

Damn!  Doug, do you think it is too late to include this somehow in ACQ?
Of course, there\'d be the added expense of the templates and silouettes...
nah, forget it.  We\'ll save it for the next supplement.

Maybe, but i\'m dubious... the M829A3 is the silver bullet.  If they do survive
the hit, they\'re not going to be enjoying life much.   We have an MCD, though
I won\'t see one until there\'s a war.

I\'m more talking bout the transmission, engine and speed issues.  Plus the
guns. We beat them on max eff range.

The Bradleys biggest plus IMO is that does make a good companion to the
Abrams. It can keep up in both road march and combat ops, isn\'t overgunned
(giving illusions of a "real" anti-tank capability) though it does seem to
have an identity problem.  

The replacement?  Probably like the Bradley, due to the current budgetary and
political situation it\'ll get torn between two competing factions... the IFV
and APC crowds... and end up somewhere in the middle.  I don\'t really expect
replacements anytime soon though i\'ve been hearing alot bout the M1A3
recently.  Haven\'t been keeping up w/ the latest hubbub, but have been hearing
alot bout an autoloaded 155mm w/ a new turret and a fire control system
supposedly as far above the M1s as the M1s is above the M60s (IVIS, GPS, CITV
too).  Not that the USMC (and thus me) will see them anytime soon even if the
army gets them within 10 years.

LOL.  nah.  Just being cocky.  ;-)  I ain\'t that arrogant, though am confident
I\'d be able to plug any tank or 3 up against mine and trust my fellows to do
the same.

That\'s because RCVG defined it as Rapid Pulse fusion (lower case) <letter>

My question is why a TL-13 laser, though I\'m not familiar w/ MT vehicle design
(and think there\'s probably no difference in such?).  I\'ll definately make it
a TL-15 vehicle, as RCVG indicates it would be.

As far as quantity, RCVG would seem to indicate the laser being singular.
Maybe the hatch is on the other side?  Symmetry would make more tactical sense
(as well as being more aesthetically pleasing).  Course the extra gunner
probably decides it in favor of 2...  Maybe have multiple models?  The initial
model was assymetrical and upgraded w/ a better one? :-)

That\'s why I don\'t have a problem w/ the Lancer being 20 dt.  It would
indicate the Imperium was going towards a 20dt standard (away from the 10dt
Trepida/Astrin).  

That does sound very very large, but i don\'t really have a problem with it.
We\'d build things that big today if we could affordably get them to move fast
and be that capable.

I would tend to agree w/ RCVGs assessment that this vehicle has a big identity
crisis.  It\'s overpowered in the APC role and too expensive in both roles, w/
all that space for passengers being space that could be a bigger and more
powerful weapon (or secondary weapons) for the tank role alone.  Hmm... we
could be describing a BMP-3... ;-)  J/k.

Um... Thunderbird 2?  Sounds familiar, but can\'t seem to recall...

I didn\'t know they had that policy.  Good to know.  

Actually I was talking bout the content, though I see I failed to mention

I\'m might get Far Trader and and First In, though neither are decided firmly
until I see them.  The editing and binding are going to get special attn.  I
doubt First In can replace WTH and WBH, but I am gonna look it over at the
FLGS when they appear... i\'d like to see the "latest take" on system design.
Far Trader... I am interested in a different take on some new
economics/trading rules.  Again look it over in the FLGS.  I haven\'t and
probably won\'t get Star Mercs as i see very little there I want and/or haven\'t
seen before.  Not a slam on it, by it any means... it looks fine, just nothing

Last time I checked, Stuart\'s required Win 95 and I\'ve stuck w/ 3.11.  Win 98
doesn\'t seem half as buggy from my use of it on friends, etc computers, so
I\'ll accept that when I get a new comp (whenever that is), but my current comp
is too weak to effectively use that IMO.  Did you get it to work on the simple
requirements Gal does?  

Hey Stuart, is it possible you could do an "official" add-on to Gal?  And have
it incorporated in Gal 2.5?  

What I\'d really like also, is for the world mapping Hexmap including w/ Gal to
to randomly do maps, by the rules in WBH/WTH.  Having it be able to be set so
I could plug in a blank photocopy of the "global data view" from the TNE
Players Forms for printing would just be a very very happy extra.  :-)

The fact that "Solomani Sam" says that this sort of stupid system is
desireable is proof that the Solomani and the Zhos are plotting against
us.  They know that their suffering, oppresed, enslaved, citizen ache
with the need to throw off their dictatorail regimes and step into a
proper system of government - one with nobles.  They are plotting to
bring down the Imperium from bothe ends at once.

You say that you have learned of this but do not bother to tell us where
you heard it.  You heard as a lying rumor from a bunch of other radical
traitors who do not know how to respect their betters.

We do not need your Solo symp crap here.  Go peddle your seditious ideas

The sales tax in most parts of Texas is about 8.5%.  I noticed, and

how used to it you are.

Here in Alaska there is no state sales tax, most towns do not have a
sales tax, there is no state income tax and everyone who has been here
for a year, applies, and is not in prison receives a check from the
state every October.  Last year it was the biggest ever, over $1,500.
We also have spectacular landscapes of supernal beauty.

Which brings up the question:  Which service has more jump troop units -
the Inperial marines or the Imperial Army?  Since meteoric assault has
aspects to both amphibious and airborne assault, I would expect that
both services would have jump-capable infantry units.

Perhaps the Marines would, like their late 20th century USMC
counterparts, consist of infantry with a significant armor component. 
Meanwhile, Imperial Army jump troops are mostly infantry, with little to
no armor component (see the 82d Airborne for an example).  These
differences would make Imperial Army jump troops easier to deploy, and
Imperial Marine units more self-sufficient.

You have stated  "...Decentralization. Delegate as much working power as
 possible to as low a level as possible."   Exactly so.  Let us just leave
each member world to govern itself as it sees fit, just as it does now.  Is it
really necessary to replace the noble structure with elected delegates to
defend the space lances and foster trade?  Has the noble structure failed in
these tasks?  Did not our good Duke Norris, acting in his capacity as Duke,
rescue our efforts in the most recent Frontier War?  Have there been
noticeable failures in the defense of the realm or movement of trade goods?

	I think that that depends on when in "history\' we are talking.   In Milieau

army battalions are drawn from member worlds and most of those do not have
sufficient experience with space travel and combat to have large amounts of
jump troops.  What Imperial Army jump troops there are would be from Sylea
itself.   In M1100+ I would think that there would be large number of Jump

seems that the marines establish the beachhead and the Army grinds up the

Thanks, Jeff. Thanks for another argument to defend RPGs against the

Wow.

Sorry, but it\'s hard to imagine a part of the Amercian continent where
the term "it sucks" is considered
rude ( Assuming one isn\'t talking about vacuum cleaners).

Of course your average US Tourist ( y\'know, the one with all the
cameras and the Hawaian shirt that appears in all the English movies )
will just say it louder and ask why the idiot furreners don\'t
understand American...

Now that gives me an idea :

Characters are hired as bodyguards for the son of a Vilani noble who
is touring the back blocks of a world with a TL4-5  indigenous
culture.  The snag is that he is a complete Vilani bigot who acts
surprised that the natives don\'t wear loin cloths and that they dont
all come out and throw themselves at his feet.

Difficulty with this plot, of course is coming up with a reason why
the players still try to keep him alive after they find out.

IMTU I don\'t use Marines or Army to describe the Imperial Military.  I
find the terms archaic (for Traveller) and brings with them to many
other connotations & comparisons to today\'s military (like mentioned
above).  Here is an portion of a hand out I give to my players that have
played Traveller before.

"There are three branches of the Imperial military: Imperial
Interstellar Fleet, Imperial Star Troops, and Imperial Planetary Forces.
The use and purpose of the Interstellar Fleet is obvious.  The Star
Troops are primarily mobile offensive soldiers and secondarily defense
on newly acquired territory; they are also used as boarding crews for
the Fleet.  The Planetary Forces is the permanent defense force of
planets; they differ from the Star Troops in that they are not used in
offensives. The previous terms of Navy, Marines, and Army are archaic
and can cause some confusion & misconceptions with the Imperial
military.  The Navy implies sailing over the ocean (what do we call the
ones that actually do that in the game), Marines are primarily used as
an initial strike force, and the Army is used for full-scale war."

The hand out covers all the changes from "canon"; it is titled
\'Traveller modifications (a.k.a. Acts of Heresy)".  Any feedback would
be appreciated.

It may be from my GURPS Traveller article (which I wrote and

but if you like that one better....

Oddly enough, I see it reversed.

The Marines are almost all infantry, albeit infantry equipped with
battledress and fusion weapons.  All Marines are trained for
rapid-interface via drop capsules.  Marine armor units are fairly rare.

The main mission for the Marine force is too be a first strike unit.  They
are equipped to hit hard and fast with overwhelming force.  They are not
designed for extended operations against regular forces.  The have to be
reinforced within a few days of their committal or the unit will start to
degrade badly.

The army, on the other hand, is made of troops drawn from the defense
forces of all the Imperium\'s worlds.  These troops are equipped to TL-14/15
standards and are available for off-world operations.  The army is *huge*;
where there might be 10,000 Marines in a subsector, there could be millions
of army troops.  

The army is mostly a defensive force.  Very heavy in vehicles and artillery
support, the army carries a massive set of trains and support.  Committing
army forces in any number requires tying up a large number of transports
and escorts.  Army troops are mostly in Comber Environment Suits and carry
gauss weapons.  Where the Marines focus on concentrating firepower in one
elite trooper, the Army accepts a lower level of training and gets the same
level of fire from a larger unit.

The Army does have jump units, mostly because they\'re seen as dashing and
romantic.  These units would be used to supplement Marine assets and for
supplemental landings after the Marines have packed up and followed the
fleet onward.

Actually, while I hate taking sides in these inane threads, I have to agree
with Clif:

Not having met the man, I have no opinions of him personally.  However, to
say that \'There WILL not ever be a man like Hathcock.\' sounds more like
hero-worship than rational thought to me.  Not to mention, it\'s pessimistic,
presumtuous and, well, \'prophesying\' (unless you have some way of looking
into the future that we do not).

As a further comment (if I\'m gonna get flamed, I might as well work at
earning it) I rather agree with the fellow who mentioned something to the
effect that being a highly skilled killer is nothing to brag about.

Having read the posted obituary, I admire the man\'s reputed bravery
(remember, I wasn\'t there, never met him) and loyalty to his comrades. 
Taking lives in cold blood isn\'t my idea of a hero (and yes, I\'m well aware
of the need for snipers in a field of enganement yaddayadda ad nauseum).

But I highly doubt that he is the only such heroic individual in the history
of the world, nor do I think he\'ll be the last.  In fact, I\'m willing to bet
that any number fo individuals on either side of any war you can name acted
with bravery above and beyond, many of them only recognised for it
posthumously, in all likelihood.

And that\'s merely wartime.  I\'m relatively certain that bravery and valor
are not limited to situations where you\'re trying to kill someone.


On a final note - for all the pro- and con-Clif (or insert your favourite
target here) I\'ve seen in a few years on this list, I don\'t remember any
individuals with less class than the poster I am quoting, "Thomas Vickers"
<redroach@texed.net>, who, unless I read his above quote wrong, just wished
another human being (and list member, for thoe of you who see posters here
as mines of ideas!) dead.

Yep. that\'s class.  I *hope* I never meet another man (online or not) like
Thomas Vickers, but I suspect I will.  Like my thoughts on heroism above, he
can\'t have cornered the market on idiocy.

Um, no.  Not unless he bought it in the late seventies.  That works out to
9.something per cent, which might be sales tax in Ontario (I live in Quebec,
what do I know?), but if he bought it in the last year or so the conversion
(pre-tax) would have looked like $20-21.  Our currency sucks.

Good point. I understand the source of the names but I still find them
archaic, inapropriate, and the cause of some disputes.  The terms of the
nobility are also archaic but I find them very appropriate.  Some
disputes arise when military, ex-military, & military buffs say things
like "it should operate like this because when I was in the 2nd ID (or
82nd Airbourne, 3rd MI, Marine Corps, and so on) that\'s the way we did
things".  Since they have the same name many seem to think they operate
in the same manner (which is fine if you like it that way, I don\'t). 
You don\'t see as many people arguing "when I was a noble..." ;)

I know that most wont agree with me on this because it\'s not "canon" but
at the very least I hope most of you would agree that even though the
names may be the same they don\'t have to operate in the same fashion.

I have much greater hopes (if that\'s the right word) for people\'s ability
to manufacture themselves radically new identities, so I (at least) don\'t
find this particularly hard to believe.  Or at least, I find it much more
believable than the idea that they _were_ preserved over some 2000-6000
years of Vilani domination.

So how does this make the Ziru Sirka any different from the Third

As far as I am concerned, that depends on who you kill and why.
Hathcock is still a hero in my book.

May I make a suggestion?

Write up some adventures, and submit them to Pyramid. Something about the
scale of an Amber Zone would be ideal. If you need help with GURPS stats
for NPCs and stuff (I know I would), there\'s piles of people here who
would help.

This sort of outlook is a key stone of the Third Imperium.  The Third Imperium
does not impose a caste system on all levels of society.   The Third imperium
has no "official" culture, though Solomani, Vilani and Old Sylean outlooks are
very strong.

Guess I should have been specific. That _was_ $16.41 US. (OK, maybe it was
$16.42, but definately sixteen and change.)

This makes it about $24 Canadian, but with the unfavourable exchange rate
charged by VISA it set me back a bit more. I\'ll judge whether it\'s been
worth it next spring, based on how many GURPS Traveller items I see.

An interesting bit of trivia that I learned the other day... "yahdah"
(usually transliterated "yada" from the Hebrew) is the same word translated
"knew" in "Adam knew his wife Eve."  It often has sexual connotations, which
explains Elaine Benes\' popularization of the expression "yada-yada-yada" in
place of overtly saying "they had sex".

I guess a sniper could say "yada-yada-yada" in place of "I\'m gonna #%&$ him
up."

Repeating something 3 times in Hebrew is comparable to the suffix "-est" in
English.

The Holy (1) of Holies (2) is an example (in fact, often translated "Most
Holy"), as is "Holy, holy, holy is the LORD God Almighty."  (Not
proselytizing, since I don\'t worship "the LORD"(tr:  "loaf warden"), just
pointing out usages that I am familiar with.)

ObTrav:  Foreign languages--a great source of GM amusement, too.

Toronto is a bit uptight, and lower-middle management tends to be
politically correct, especially in this board. (It\'s a relaly odd
combination of poitically correct philosophy with right-wing financial
management, which as usual leaves the average kids stuck in the middle.)

Because I like the kids. There\'s no life like it. I complain, often
profanely, but I can\'t think of _anything_ else I\'d rather devote my life
to.

That would lead to punitive measures. Even if nothing overt happens,
there\'s a lot of games that can be played with timetabling. I already have
a more frantic timetable than many other teachers here, I don\'t need them
to make an effort to make it busier.

I met those folks in Amsterdam and Vancouver. Didn\'t notice the cameras,
though. :-)

To be honest, the worse chap in Vancouver wasn\'t wearing a Hawaian shirt,
and he was actually a retiree. I think the accent was Texan, but I\'m not
certain. He was complaing how all the immigrants had ruined Vancouver - it
had been such a nice place when he moved there five years ago, before the
Chinese arrived. This while we were both getting directions from a nice
Chinese grandmother (who had been _born_ in Vancouver).

Hm. They signed a contract, and their reputation will be ruined if they
don\'t protect him?  His mother is really powerful, and the players figure
she\'ll exact revenge if they fail?

Back before cloning became commercially feasible, they used to sell
organs, then cremate the corpse after a \'failed\' revival.

While under investigation for excessive revival failures, a captain who\'s
in the hole to the Mob decides to increase his survival rate by only
removing non-vital organs. The player affected doesn\'t discover this until
his annual physical reveals he has only one kidney...

Non-canon, but a nasty plot.

as one of the people working on WBD with Stuart, can
I just say one thing? One of the things we have been 
working on is the Extended System Generation for
systems. Instead of the old version, where you had a 
text file for the system and that was it, we have each
system having its (sp? ;-) ) own  sub folder. Now, I may
be wrong, but I don\'t think that Galactic lets you attach
a folder, just a text document. This could cause some
complications.
	 Of course, use WBD for what you wish,
(I am OK to say that, aren\'t I, Stuart?) but we\'ve been 
working on the premise of combining it with Tom Bont\'s
excellent Astrogator 4 software, and IMO that\'s the way
our project should go.

Also, one of the reasons I got invoved with the WBD/Astro
project is that I, and a few others, wanted to see a consistent
Imperium, in its fullest detail, without gigabytes of downloads.
I\'m not too sure about having world resource information
as an internet resource, purely from the financial prospect
of spending weeks downloading this information. Some of
us don\'t get unlimited free calls / local call allowance from
our telcos.

I think I\'ve been \'volunteered\' to do a WBD / Astro web site,
so I\'ll give it a go, and let the TML know when it\'s done.

I now return you to your regular discussions about ettiquette
and various \'Clif\' centred discussions.....

Leroy was generally polite but condescending. An increasing arrogance was
evident, but most of his posts revolved around Traveller, as did the
topics. Leroy is remembered for being one half of the RoM debate, which
(even though he was wrong ;-) ) was about a Traveller topic.

When thinking of him I don\'t associate Clif with a particular debate, I
just tend to recall that he tends to be volitile in debate, and I have to
think twice sometimes before responding. However, he does make some
interesting insights when he\'s not caught in a flame fest. My sadness is
that his tone, and politeness leave much to be desired, in my opinion.

The difference is approach - Leroy took a while to get everyone\'s back up.
Clif lacks his subtlety, but was improving before the GT outburst. Now,
that came mid-week, and I didn\'t respond at first because real life was in
the way. Sadly, I (and others) didn\'t respond fast enough and Clif\'s
patience snapped.

This is what he needs to address (along with his tone) if he ever wants to
become someone who people listen to, and like discussing things with.

Now this may be totally the wrong impression that I have of Clif, but it\'s
the way he comes over to me from his posts. YMMV.

From today\'s issue of \'Daily Brief\' (mailto:subscribe-db@incinc.net to
subscribe - it\'s a decent news summary) :

* The Federal Communications Commission ruled yesterday that dial-up
internet connections are interstate in nature and should therefore be
subject to federal jurisdiction.
    - future FCC hearings are planned on how rates for such dial-up
connections should be set.

Since what the FCC does to the internet will effect everyone on this list
(well, maybe only those of us in North America), I thought you might want to
know that the FCC is, again, examining how much we pay to access the
internet.  This could be a good thing (the government does, occaisionally,
*help* us) or it could be a bad thing (and considering the lobby pressure
that the phone companies have available, and the fact that *they* want a
per-minute fee schedule for internet access...)

www.fcc.gov is the FCC website.

Weren\'t the sophists master rhetoricians(is that a word?)?  My impression of
the sophists is that they lied for money, while disguising their deceit in
pretty language.

You can find similar references of Vilani assimilation in the original
Library Data LBBs and DGP\'s Vilani & Vargr.  Although the latter is
written from the Vilani view point and doesn\'t use words like assimilate
using stuff like "benefits of our culture" instead.  I think the Vilani
assimilation is pretty clear in the OTU.

This, of course, might be different IYTU.

Jesse,

So far, it looks great!  Thanks for putting the updates online as a 
demonstration to those of us interested; I enjoy seeing the process 
you go through to develop the outstanding starship images that you\'ve 
created.  Keep up the good work; you are a talented artist, and I\'m 
glad SJG is giving us the chance to see you put it to work in the GT 
product line.

Keep on Travellin\',

The good Duke Norris is an excellent example of the right woman (or in this

this. My arguement is that it\'s much more likely that in a pool of elected
candidates, we will be more likely to get a competant leader than a hereditary
noble. After all; it\'s possible that Duke Norris is just as likely to sire a
wastrel than another Norris. Also; I feel that elected officials have to
answer directly to their constituents, which nobles do not. These elected
officials (especially in the executive branch, who are then free to appoint
good managers who probably wouldn\'t be chosen by nobles). Of course you could
go to appointed non hereditary noblity (a meritocracy so to speak), but then
what\'s the point; you might as well use elections to maintain electorate

Whether he meant it literally or was \'just joking\' it is still in the

If I were to wish that your wife/mother/significant other fell down the

would it be any less odious?

Is it any less offensive to read something like that, even if I\'m \'just

<snip>

True, it won\'t allow a subfolder to be
attached (I believe) but the files that
can be attached are not limited to text
files. I\'ve configured Gal2.4 to use
WordPad to view any documents. This
allows me to all of WordPad\'s functions
including imbedded graphics, scalable
fonts, formatting, etc.

Such files can also be linked to
specified locations on one of Gal2.4\'s
world surface maps which, of course, can
also be customized in regards to map hex
colors (no symbols, though :( ).

Cool! Once Astrogator has all the functionality of Gal2.4,
I\'ll happily make the switch. Tom\'s software has alot
to offer. I do find the use of fractal maps, while entertaining,
to be of limited utility to me as a GM. I need the ability
to easily and quickly customize a world\'s surface map
and link files to various map locations.

Because MT was before FFS1, and did not include provisions for designing
weapons (like GURPS Vehicles 1st ed. and, IIRC, Striker.). Instead, there
were several tables with weapons to choose from, and there was no TL15 beam
laser on the tables (TL13 was the highest).

You are lucka#y! 
Countries in Europe have sales Taxes in of 15 %, most have 16 %. 
What I thought weird though, when I was in the States/Canada the first

the tax was not included in the price given on the product. While I am sure
this helps
to practice maths while shopping, it was annoying always being a couple of
cents short

	In your last esay, you have said  "Also; I feel that elected officials have
to
answer directly to their constituents, which nobles do not. These elected
officials (especially in the executive branch, who are then free to appoint
good managers who probably wouldn\'t be chosen by nobles)."    Here lies the
sticking point of our dispute.   You "feel" an elected official, even if he
receives the votes of 6 billion people and beat a candidate with 5 1/2 billion
votes will be more responsive to "the people", presumbaly his slice of the
people, than a noble, who is responsible to the Emperor for good behavior and
is subject to local law as well.  

	Such an elected official would probably wish to represent policies and
ideologies of his voters, financial backers and supporters.  Such an official
would be actually less responsive or even hostile to the wishes of a large
segment of the people.  A noble\'s task on the other hand is to make sure
things run smoothly in order to guarentee his position and especially his
patrimony.  Nobles must look to the entire district, rather than his "voter
base" and must look to the entire future, rather than the next election.

	Whether your "feeling" has some merit or not, the crucial question is whether
the perceived danger to the Imperium is worth the wrenching change your
reforms would entail.  To leap off a precipice of this height requires more of
a cause.

I wholly agree with Ross on this one. Poor manners all around. C\'mon folks,
can\'t we all just get along? :-)

However, he is forgetting Leroy\'s little "sniper friend who can hit elk in
the Black Forest at 2000 yards" stunt. *That* was quite clearly a poorly
veiled scare tactic directed at one member of the list (even if a laughably
implausable one, considering the past experience of the list member it was
directed at).

Hardly. Clif is just getting everyone warmed up (steamed up?) for the
Biannual Piracy Flamespurts and Shouting Match, which BTW is 2 weeks late
already.

Still to come is the Great A-bomb/Violence Solves Nothing debate. (hints of
this one in the Sniper debate)

Say, remember when Leroy sort of threatened to have his friend "two miles
with a pistol in forest" Bob shoot Doug???

Maybe Leroy is the CT of  TML Flamebait - flawed in some ways, and a little
outdated now, but has any of the other versions (Mega-Flamebait, Flamebait
The New Era, Flame 4, GURPS Flamebait) really measured up to those grand
days of horse-shaped grease-spots and really REALLY pointless circular
debate?

Does anyone remember discussing Traveller? (no, delete that, Dougherty,
delete that NOW!)


On a more serious note; does anyone have any hard data on polities which
survived into or appeared during the Long Night. There\'s a little bit in MT,
but is there more somewhere that I\'ve forgotten about?

	I just had a few things to say about the debate. 

	1)  I was not initially going to get involved, but I must admit I\'m having a
really good time in the debate with Seth (Solomani Sam), and am getting to be
fond of my alter-ego The Old Marquis.

	2) Clif, you were right, this is rather like a PBEM isn\'t it.

	3) Does the sponsor of the debate envision a close-out of the debate?

	4)  Is anyone else going to get involved again?   Are the other participants
being more deliberate and measured in issuing posts?  Seth and I seem to be
putting them out quite frequently.  Or are you all waiting for us to wind
down, before jumping back in?
	5) By the way, the "Congratulations" story was indeed a very neat thing to
read.

		In any case, it was a good idea (and pretty free of flames too, or is that
just because The Old Marquis is such a gentleman?)

Where does the Donosev come from?  I\'ve never seen or heard of
it before.

Unfortunately, (brace yourself, Jesse, Brian and whoever else may
be responsible), I have to concur with the sentiment above.
The Donosev will never appear as my wallpaper.  Not when I have
a beautiful Empress Marava being loaded at a starport.  At least
the Marava appears functional and not like an *****

Is this the same Warhammer 40K that I know and "love"??  The templates in
the English version are used for determining where \'multiple-impact warhead\'
(ie submunitions) land; the first impact is at point A, the second is found
by rolling a die and moving the template so that the arrow on disc one
points to the relevant number, then roll a second die and again line the
arrow up with the number, then the fourth impact point is found the same
way, or however many munitions there were.  This is used for the Thudd Gun,
a sort of four-barreled mortar - hence the four impacts above.

Warhammer 40K - at least from the version after "40K-Rogue Trader" - is a
wargame, not a RPG.  It does have \'characters\', but that is mainly to
distinguish officers or \'special agent\' types from your common-or-garden
cannon-fodder, oops sorry, squaddie #8).  At least, that\'s the only way I\'ve
seen it played.

Where did the template idea James mentioned originate?

(Oh, and do Vampires ever appear in Traveller?)

Eagerly awaiting the response...

Thats just the result of the fact that each state has different taxes, and some
cities have sales tax as well.  Pricing is often done by the manufacturer, in
packaging
and the like, and many manufacturers deliver goods in diferent states.  Also,
certain classes of things aren\'t taxed, but that varies.  For instance, in
Texas,
most food isn\'t taxed.  And some clothing isn\'t, IIRC.  Texas needs the
relatively
high sales tax (bu US standards) because there is no state income tax.

Ditto here.  I\'m taking notes.  Jesse, are the templates
going to be shown next?  VRML/Moray/POV Ray is quite easy
for throwing textures about.  But, getting bump maps and
everything else to line up with the geometry is a bit
tricky.

IIRC, it\'s the "400 ton Survey Scout" from CT _Fighting 
Ships_ (Supp 9?). 

It was deckplanned and detailed quite a bit more 
thoroughly in Digest Group\'s MT _World Builder\'s Handbook_.

I think the Donosev looks functional. Looking pretty and 
landing in atmosphere just aren\'t part of its function. :)

colors is a SEPERATE texture, and EACH texture has FOUR maps:  Color,
Diffuse, Specular, and Bump.  Also, each of those areas may have the mapping
applied in a different way; planar map, spherical, cylindrical, and each may
be on a different axis; x, y, z.  Wheee!  Texturing is really the longest
and most tedious process.

All Marines are jump trained.  Only Imperial Army units wear the Jump
Certification badge.
For them it\'s something special.

Oh Thucydides is going to get a reply out sometime, but he\'s been

What would your feeling be if BITS published, say, a 40 page A4 (that\'s
approximately the same size as the GT books) or 40 page A5 (101/LBB size)
adventure module range with GT and T4 stats (T4 because it is pretty easy
to convert back and is likely to be compatible with T5, if the drafts are
to be believed)?

What would your feelings be if these where art light like the GDW LBB
Adventures?

What if some of these were M:Generic 1100s or M:0?

Just curious.....

Missile Countermeasures Device.   Looks kinda like a disco ball.  It sends out
emissions of some kind that confuse a missiles little brain and make it fly
somewhere else and blow up.  Or something like that.  It\'s a one time use
thing.  Turn it on.  It burns itself out in its usage.  They\'re hideously
expensive, and you only get one use, so aside from a picture and a couple
diagrams, i\'ve never seen one.  Don\'t want us breaking one, either. ;-)

I think that the large majority of Imperial Marines infantry would be jump
trained.  RCVG says Imperial Marines were mostly organized in regiments, which
contain three task force headquarters that draw from a pool of 18 companies (9
lift infantry, 5 meson artillery batteries, two lift cavalry, a grav tank
company, and a commando company) to divide amongst the three task forces as
required.  The Imperial Marine Task Force TOE in Striker II is only one
possible config.

The Imperium maintained a very limited number of permanent divisions.  For the
Imperial Army, it was probably a limited number of units, probably on the
regimental scale... maybe a couple per subsector.  The rest conventional
infantry brought in by landers, etc.

> Perhaps the Marines would, like their late 20th century USMC
> counterparts, consist of infantry with a significant armor component. 

Depends on what\'s "significant" to you.  It\'s very minor in the USMC, there
are 4 tank batallions (2 active, 2 reserve), when there are that many
divisions (though the 4th is the parent division for all the reserve units).

RCVGs answer is above. :-)

Didn\'t the Airborne units use Sheridans?  Did the M8 AGS ever get produced?
I\'ve got the data for it (in fact it\'s the assumption for FM 17-15 Tank
Platoon), but I don\'t know much about it and haven\'t heard of it (and we don\'t
cover it in AFVID).

I take serious umbrage at this stereotypic bedwetting liberal drivel.
(Please note the TOTAL ABSENCE of emoticons.)

Considering that the closest to war you\'ll probably ever be is watching
the "History Channel", you should thank God (or whoever) that there are
those rare men like Gunney Hathcock that have the courage and conviction
to take on a morally repugnent task, which lesser men would refuse to
touch, a task which gives the professionals themselves no joy, and performed
that odious duty to the best of their ability.  Hathcock *NEVER* bragged
about his career in \'Nam and, when put up for the Silver Star (for rescuing
the seven Marines from the burning AmphiTrack that almost killed him),
refused the award *THREE* times in a row.  He always maintained that
what he did for his country was "nothing special".

The quiet bravery demonstrated by Hathcock and his peers is a testimonial
that rare men exist who recognize country before self, and duty before
personal moral comfort.  We can all learn from such men.

The next time you feel like slandering the honored dead, try looking
at the bigger picture before mouthing off. :^(

The problem I have with this is, why? Why do all these people (who are for
all intents and purposes Vilani) decide across multiple worlds to reconstruct
themselves as a long dead culture? After all they start as Vilani, a culture
fundimentally resistant to radical changes and then for some reason they
then radically change their culture leaving little or no trace of their Vilani roots.

The ZS is a single monolithic culture (well actually single with significant
regional differences) with pockets/reservations of other cultures. These other
cultures are heavily restricted in respect to movement and face other
"discrimitation" (heavier taxes, Vilani governors etc).

The problem is you have all these minor races who\'s culture apparently
survived thousands of years of Vilani cultural assimilation more or less
intact. Now either a) the Vilani botched their attempts at assililation in an
unbelievably big way (which IMHO doesn\'t fit terribly well), b) all these
races recreated themselves with absolutely no reference to or evidence of
their Vilani culture during the Long Night (again IMHO unlikely) or c) the
supposed Vilani assimilation didn\'t actually happen but was in fact a
deliberate misrepresentation for political ends during the RoM.

When I look at it, option c seems to be the simplest and most likely.

In my ref\'s TU, there is at least one division of Imperial Army jump
troops in the Spinward Marches circa 1100 (our campaign is set just
prior to the FFW).  However, the regiments normally operate
independently.

Yes, but the USMC (and the Imperial Marine TOEs I\'ve seen) also have a
fair number of APCs.  The 82d has none.

3/73 Armor (Abn), the Sheridan battalion in the 82d, was deactivated in
July of 1997 (IIRC).  Sadly, the M8 AGS has not been produced, since the
powers-that-be at EAM ("echelons above me") decided that meeting payroll
was more important than procuring the AGS.  Given that hard choice, I
can understand the decision.  That doesn\'t mean that I _like_ it....

    'body' => 'This debate so far has ignored the power of suggestion.  By this I mean
the suggestive power of reasoned persuasion.

The Imperium, being clearly the largest interstellar organization in
known space (both in terms of area and world included, and number of
sophonts who claim citizenship) would have essentially no chance of
functioning without a fairly decentralized form of government.  As long
as communication is no faster than the speed of travel, governance will
in almost all cases be on a system-wide basis at most.  Thus, no matter
whether the person in charge of the system is called Marquis or
President, it will not matter on an interstellar basis.  The Third
Imperium, unlike it\'s two predecessors, is properly content to govern
space and trade, but not the planets upon which people live.

On the other hand, the responsibility of the Imperium is not just
physical space, and the physical and intellectual property that is
traded between the stars.  The Imperium is also responsible to both it\'s
planetary and sophont citizens.  Without planets to live on, and
sophonts to live on those planets, the Imperium would be a poor place,
both economically and socially.

The Imperium does need a written list of rights for the planets and
sophonts who are citizens, and that list needs to have legal power over
the bum in the gutter and the Emperor in the same sense.  Some policies
have been common to each Emperor (such as calling murder a crime), but
these have never been divorced from the whim of the Emperor who can
change this at any time.

The ancient Terran "Bill of Rights" has been put forth as a possible
template for such a listing of rights.  While I as an Imperial citizen
may see some of the rights listed in the Terran listing as being
irrelevant or bad in an Imperial setting, I believe the idea is sound. 
One of the most important of such rights is what another person called
"the right to vote with one\'s feet."  The right to move to a place where
the individual sophont will be able to be the best able to serve the
Imperium and himself.

This listing of rights would be fairly straightforward to implement at
an Imperial level (between the stars), but would be much more difficult
to implement on each world individually.  We come then to suggestion.

Forcible persuasion can take many forms, from friendly meetings between
world governments and the Imperial presence there, to the searing flame
of atomic missiles and meson blasts.  The proposed list of rights could
be enabled on each world in the Imperium by the use of forcible
persuasion without making large changes in planetary governments (there
may be exceptions, but they will be very few).  This type of LIMITED
meddling in member worlds is not without precedent.  Witness the power
and authority of the Office of Calendar Compliance, which was formed in
the very dawn of the Third Imperium, and continues today to serve the
limited purpose put forth in it\'s charter.

I am not suggesting the Imperium should use such forcible persuasion to
enforce such policies on individual planets.  On the other hand, the
reasoned persuasion I suggest is much less intimidating.  The Emperor
must suggest to each of the worlds of the Imperium that these rights be
implemented on the world.  The worlds may choose to ignore those
suggestions, however, if such suggestions are not followed Imperial
favor will turn away from that world.  Now this is not to say that bad
things will happen to such a world, just that good things won\'t happen.

Oh for heaven\'s sake. Calm down, back off, and consider that other political
views may be as validly held as your own, even if you disagree with them.

There\'s a difference between valuing someone\'s bravery and praising them for
killing people. We can admire people who put themselves in the line of fire on
our behalf (even in wars we may not agree with), and also consider it tasteless
to treat their kill-rate like a football statistic.

I\'m sure Mr Hathcock was a nice guy, a brave man and an excellent soldier. Why
it is appropriate that he be discussed in this forum I\'m not entirely sure.

The problem is, those deckplans in the WBH sort of left out just _where_
those turrets are. The main part of the hull... the big a-frame-ey
looking thing, is mostly fuel and drives. The thing that _looks_ like a
turret, under the snout, is actually the remote probe launch and control
center...ideas folks?

There\'s a TD which has a concise history of the 3rd Imperium which mentions
some of the Solomani ones (17?).

The Solomani Rim and S&A also mention them.

Can\'t think of much more, but there may be something in Knightfall - ISTR
Carlos saying something..

I think there are more options than what you mentioned.  One is the
assimilation wasn\'t total annihilation of the original culture.  The
acculturation of a world was only partial.  It had an official culture
for business, public life, and government (the Vilani culture) and a
suppressed unofficial culture (the original culture), for private life. 
I\'m not sure but isn\'t this what Hebrews did while slaves of the
Egyptians (I am sure someone will correct me if I\'m wrong).

I think many worlds would try to retain some of their original culture
during the reign of the Ziru Sirka.  A resurgence in \'the old ways\'
would occur during the RoM on such worlds.  The resurgent culture
probably wont be identical to its\' pre-Vilani influence, despite the
claims of the culture in question.

In a few cases it may have been necessary for the Ziru Sirka to
annihilate a culture.  I have a few minor races IMTU that have retained
the Vilani culture.

Needless to say the Army has more "Jump Trained" and certainly two or three
times more on active Jump status.  The Marines would only have a few shock
troops on status.  The Army being about 20-25 times larger than the Marines
would have about 10% on Jump status.  That is if future military
configurations match present day ones.  Again I\'m basing it on U.S. and the
old Soviet Army Order Of Battle.

Marines are amphibious by nature and I can se this would be the way to go in
the future (I can think of a least one movie that this is kinda
demonstrated, Aliens II) and the Jump Troops that lead the assault are the
Army Rangers in the U.S. at least.  Could some one speak on the other
countries, UK, Can, Aus, NZ.... I know that is list I just made is rather
biased to English speaking and for that I\'m sorry as  I\'m not trying to
slight anyone.  Maybe the English speakers are more war like.

	They\'re the same thing. Joules are *energy*, watts are *power*,
which is an energy rate: energy divided by time. So when you multiply
power (megawatts) by time (seconds), you get energy back out
(megajoules).

list has been very interesting to me. I\'m getting tired of
reading digests full of gratuitous insults, crude and vulgar
language, responses to these, and criticism of the originators of
all of the above. I still wish the chief offender would either
clean up or clear out, but I\'m not going to belabor the point.

But quite apart from that, discussions of CT, MT, BITS, GURPS,
Spinward Marches, Imperial politics c. 1100, and software limited
to Win95 or Mac, have very little relevance to my campaign.
Extensive discussions of how many lasers can dance in a turret,
or the possible variations on combat systems don\'t do much for
me, either.  Subtract all these, these, and there hasn\'t been
much so far this year that I can use.

So, let me propose something a little bit different, something
that\'s not necessarily tied to a given ruleset or campaign area.
That is, societies and cultures that might be found _somewhere_
in a Traveller universe.

I have a fat textbook on world history which I\'ve started mining for ideas
about societies, situations, events, and personalities I might use in my
own TU, and I thought I\'d share some of them with the list. Here are a half
dozen "world hooks".

1. Universities are heavily politicized, and don\'t cooperate so
much as they compete, so archaeology is conducted a la Indiana
Jones.  Valuable sites of pre-human settlement are claimed by
institutions which don\'t have the resources to investigate them
properly but refuse to let anyone else do so.

2. Certain prehuman settlement remains are famed for their
aesthetic appeal and are important tourist attractions. There are
a few which are nearly as good but much less well known (or even
undiscovered) and many more that are overrated, at least by the
local inhabitants. 

3. A nomadic, animal herding culture has had access to high
technology from the beginning of human settlement. The world is
fairly inhospitable and sparsely populated, but people have been
using TL-7 (plus or minus) technology to help herd their beasts
for centuries now.

4. The local environment is cold, thin atmosphere; very warm and
humid; or very hot and dry. Protective gear of some kind is a
necessity for humans who live or work outside the centers of
settlement, but the local life forms are well adapted to the
conditions.

5. The culture has a peculiar taboo against writing and depends
on oral culture, but maintains a suprisingly high tech level
through rote learning, memorization, and apprenticeship.

6. The culture is very strongly family-oriented. Unlike most
Solomani cultures, it has retained social organization along
kinship lines through TL advances.  Probably more typical in
vilani culture than Solomani. Possible models in SF&F are
Heinlein\'s free traders (Citizen of the Galaxy), and the Tsurani
in the "Empire" trilogy by RE Feist & Janny Wurtz.

Any comments or suggestions for variations or development? Shall
I do more?

Solomani Sam advocates a radical change in the structure of
Imperial governance, abolishing in toto the entire edifice that
we have built over the past thousand years.  The justification
offered is previous success of his proposed structure, and
corruption and mediocrity in the current structure.

The model offered is that of the Federal Republic, with a written
delineation of powers and charter of individual
rights/protections, an elective legislature and executive, and an
independent judiciary.  This model has its attractions; it
creates a government that is responsive to the will of the
majority of the people, with protections against oppression of
the minority in certain ways.  Yet the model is not without its
flaws, and those flaws are such that it becomes an impractical
model for our Imperium, with its myriad worlds.

First among these flaws is the mediocrity that is decried as a
problem of the hereditary nobility.  Elected leaders must appeal
to the majority of the electorate; since the electorate covers
the entire spectrum of views, the candidate that will succeed is
the one that offends least, rather than the one that is best
qualified.  Our hereditary nobility, largely cognizant of their
responsibilities, generally receive an education and experience
designed to prepare them for their responsibilities as
administrators.  Additionally, higher-ranking nobles are
responsible for ensuring that those below them discharge their
responsibilities reliably.  The topmost levels, the Archdukes and
the senior dukes of the sectors, can be removed from their
positions at any time, and their heirs must be confirmed by the
Emperor before ascending to the responsibilities.  Furthermore,
the succession to the Iridium Throne is itself not automatic; the
Emperor must explicitly designate a heir, and the Moot must
confirm the choice.  This gives us a level of protection against
mediocrity which no elective system can match.

Solomani Sam characterizes the Federal Republican model as
\'Solomani government\'.  The accuracy of this characterization is
to be questioned, especially as pertains to the Federal
Republican influence on the government of Solomani space.  On the
interstellar level, this model has a poor track record; the
domination of the Ziru Sirka by the Terran Confederation ended
with a proposal to, in essence, loot the Ziru Sirka for the
benefit of the Confederation - an expression, no doubt, of the
\'popular will\' of the franchised citizens of the Confederation,
rather than that of the (disenfranchised) people of the Ziru
Sirka.  This was only prevented by a senior (unelected) military
officer, Fleet Admiral Hiroshi Estigarriba, going outside the
elective system and seizing control of both the Confederation and
the Ziru Sirka, and proclaiming an Empire and Protectorate.

A few hundred years ago, the Solomani demanded and received
\'self-determination\'.  This has resulted in the Solomani Sphere
that we see today, with a governmental structure more
characteristic of the absolutist dictatorships that opposed the
Federal Republics in the days prior to Solomani unification
against the Vilani.  As with those absolutist governments,
disagreement with the ideology of the ruling clique is classed as
treason, there are secret police spying on the ordinary citizen,
and the government is unresponsive to changing opinions among the
common people, and unconcerned about the needs and desires
thereof.

The other disadvantage to the Federal Republic as proposed by
Solomani Sam is inherent in the model itself, and which does not
and cannot occur in our present feudal structure:  Power comes
with election, not with competence, and the priority of the
elected power-holders rapidly becomes to regain or maintain power
through further elections.  This leads to a never-ending cycle of
campaigning and fundraising for campaigns, taking time away from
doing the job for which the person was actually elected.  More,
to the extent that the jobs are performed at all, they are
subject not to reasoned consideration of the expressed desires
and needs of the governed, but to the people\'s fickle whims of
the moment, as few elected officials are willing to look beyond
the next election.  To impose limitations on how long an elected
official serves is counterproductive; in the interval between the
final election and the termination of tenure, the official,
though elected, is unaccountable even to the very people to whom
the position is owed.

Our present structure inherently guards against these defects,
but provides no incentive, positive or negative, to ensure
quality of performance.  A system of review and disenfeoffment
from above, in response to conditions below, provides that
incentive; position is dependent on performance.  Hereditariness
causes no problems under this system; succession would not be
automatic: the noble would specifically designate the heir, and
be responsible for the proper education and training of that
heir, who in turn would be confirmed by the next-higher noble to
whom fealty is owed - or possibly by Moot-like councils at lower
levels; Dilgaadin\'s ideas, though perhaps more radical than is
warranted, contain that which may reasonably be considered.

We must make the Imperium more responsive and more active in the
governance of the Member Worlds, not make it an Imperium in name
only, but following some other form of governance.  Neither
radical change nor stasis is an appropriate response to the
stresses that lurk below our placid surface; judicious
consideration of careful adjustment is the only way to accomplish
our goals.

I think we may be talking at cross purposes here. What you are proposing
above is fairly much the way I see things too, just I don\'t call that
"assimilation" (I call it supression). The problem as I see it, is that if the
Vilani had set out to make every one Vilani, after 2,000 years they would
have essentially annihilated all but a handful of cultures. One only has to
look at the Turkish assimilation of Asia Minor or the Swedish assimilation
of Scania. In both cases the local cultures were pretty much erased in
short order by the use of quite "mild" policies.

If I may, I\'ll repost something I sent to the TWG awhile ago, which sort of
outlines what I think happened.

This is my explaination:

When the Vilani first moved into space and encountered numerous aliens less 
technologically advanced than themselves they were at first motivated primarily 
by humanitarian/paternalistic ideals. Here were all these "primitive barbarians" 
(noble savages if you will) who were just standing by ready to receive the 
benefits of Vilani civilisation. So the Vilani were fairly free with their technology 
and traded readily. Sure they did it on a commercial basis (after all it\'s fine to 
be a humanitarian, but they weren\'t about to make a loss doing it), and they 
made sure that these aliens were aware of their responsabilities under the 
patent system to pay royalties etc. but it was done for the benefit of the aliens. 
So over time these first aliens absorbed Vilani technology, but there was no 
real attempt to absorb these cultures. What happened was they were brought 
into the Vilani patent system, but other than that their cultures were pretty 
much left intact.

Now these aliens traded further out and spread Vilani technology further. 
However these cultures had not fully absorded Vilani culture and therefore often 
were less scruplous in ensuring that the patent system was spread along with 
the technology. Thus the technology spread but the patent system didn\'t. Now 
to the Vilani this is intolerable, "look at what we have done for them and this is 
how they repay us!". To the Vilani this is the worst form of ingratitude. The 
Vilani response was simple, bring them all under Vilani control.

There was never any attempt to spread Vilani culture to either group of aliens, 
all that was intended was to bring them absolutely into the patent system. If 
they adopted Vilani culture all well and good, but it was never an aim. However 
conquering these aliens cost money, and since (in the Vilani eyes) it was all 
their own fault, it would only seem fair to the Vilani that these aliens should be 
organised efficently to repay the costs of incorporating them. Thus Vilani work 
practices were imposed on the conquered races, but yet again, this is as far as 
it goes. The intention is not to turn the aliens into Vilani, just to defray the 
costs of conquering them.

Also, to the Vilani mindset, the uncontrolled spread of technology just could 
not be allowed to happen again. Therefore these aliens must be restricted and 
controlled (another cost which has to be defrayed). How was this achieved? 
Ghettos, bundle all the aliens into a "reservation" and keep them firmly under 
the thumb. It might seem harsh, but remember it is all their own fault. If they 
hadn\'t so blantantly "bitten the hand which fed them" none of this would have 
been neccessary. Now of course some races actually thrived under the Vilani 
(eg the Newts). These were the races which adapted to Vilani cultural norms, 
quickly repaid their debt from the Consolidation Wars and showed that they 
were (in Vilani eyes) responsible citizens. These races could be allowed out of 
their reservations and participate in the interstellar community. Again no effort 
was made to introduce Vilani culture to them, after all there were no problems 
with their exisiting culture, so why spend the money to do so?

Thus the upshot of all this is that the races who\'s existing culture could fit 
Vilani norms were not absorbed because there was no reason to do so; and the 
others were not because it was cheaper just to restrict them.

Definitely, no question about that. My argument is against calling it a
deliberate policy of assimilation. IMO if the Vilani had set out to
impose a single Vilani culture on the ZS, after 2,000 years they would
have succeeded and erased virtually all traces of other cultures.

When Europeans first came in contact with native Americans, Polynesians, etc.,
there were mass deaths due to smallpox.  This disease seldom killed Europeans
(I believe), but had a high mortality rate among people who had not been
exposed.  And, of course, the Europeans occasionally exploited this in what
amounted to crude early biowar.

You see where this is going?  The Vilani, of course, are supposed not to have
had native diseases.  They were inedible to the bugs of Vland.  Is it possible
that influenza, for instance, was a major factor in the Terran victory over
the ZS?  To me, it seems inevitable.

I\'d thought a bit about Milieu E21 (Earth 21st century), and did a
little research.  I figured, for Traveller purposes, there would be
bunches of spaceports in the Earth system before the Vilani were
encountered.

Since I can\'t prognosticate, and since I don\'t want to pick too
blindly, I webbed over to a gov\'t site that lists the economies of
all nations and used that to extrapolate who would have what
spaceports.  And, without further a doo doo, for your flamebait
pleasure, I hereby present The World:

Spacefaring Nations

Just as there were three "worlds" defined in the 20th century, so
are there three types of nations in Milieu E21: those with shipyards,
those with spaceports only, and those with neither.

The list below shows the location of spaceports on Earth, the class of
spaceport, and the monetary system used by the owning nation.  Please
note that the spaceport classes vary with the timeline:

Early E21 (2020? to 2049)

All spaceports are downgraded by 1 level.

Middle E21 (2050 to 2079)

All spaceports are as shown.

Late E21 (2080 to 2118?)

All spaceports are upgraded by 1 level.  All national capitals have a
spaceport of rating \'D\', OR a rating equal to the best spaceport in that
country.

Class B Spaceports

Bangkok (Thailand)          B    Baht
Brasilia (Brazil)           B    Cruziero
Boston (US)                 B    Dollar

Moon Colony                 B    Liter-of-Water *
Belt Industrial Complex     B    Liter-of-Water

* note: a Liter-of-water, or Liter for short, is roughly
equal to the cost of extracting or shipping a liter of
water to the site.  For simplicity, it\'s assumed to be
equally difficult to procure water at each site.  Of course,
each site has extraction problems unique to its location.
If I had to guess, I\'d value a Liter at Cr1000 -- thereby
(conveniently) placing a milliliter (ML) at Cr1.  ;)
\'Course, what the heck is a Credit worth?  Side note:
this would make a great profit opportunity to Vilani
traders... until the jump drive comes and drives down the
value of water... good reason to sabotage projects, eh?

I want some critique of the timeline.  Can you live with it?
My big concerns are TL and Contragrav.  I think delaying
the development of both is a Good Thing; the question is,
delay how far?

Ok, here\'s the timeline.  Phrases in double quotes are adventure
titles, some from me, some from another gentleman contributor
whose name escapes me (help!!).

Timeline

Early E21
2027: Luna Drydock on-line
2029: Mars One and Ceres One established
2031: Contragrav discovered  *<---- maybe NOT

    'body' => 'I\'ve been following this discussion and thought it might be useful to weigh in
with a little canon data on Marine v. Army jump troops.  I pulled out my copy
of "Fifth Frontier War".  Since it depicts a sizable chunk of the Imperial
military, I feel that it constitutes a valid sample to study.  When I look it
over I found 8 regiments of jump capable Marines, as well as the semi-jump
capable 4518th reg.(Duke of Regina\'s own Huscarles).  These regiments are
rated in game terms as 5 strength points (battalion equivents) and Tech level
15.  Buried amongst the thousands of strength ponts of Imperial Army troops
(mostly Tech 14-15 lift infantry with a good proportion of other unit types) I
was able to locate two, count em, two regiments of Army jump troops, rated at
5 strength points and tech level 14 and 15 respectively.  This demonstrates
that the Army has Jump troops, but much less of them than are possessed by the
Marines.  It is possible that a multitude of Jump Troop regiments are "buried"
within the 500 and 100 point Army and Corp level units, but only if you assume
a significant presence (say 1 regiment per corps) the total number of Jump
Troops will the Army Jump Troopers seriously outnumber the Marine variety.  I
actually do not feel that this is the case.  The Imperial Army units comprise
a wide variery of independant regiments and divisions.  If the Army fielded
large numbers of Jump troop units, they would have shown up for the big one,
the Fifth Frontier War.  But they just are not there.  The Imperial Army does
not appear to place a high priority on budgeting Jump Troops in their OB.
Based on this, my theory is that the relatively small numbers of Army or
Marine Jump troopers are given the responsibility for most meteoric assaults
where the tactical situation requires them, but that Imperial army doctrine
must hold that for most assaults, assault shuttles or the lift troopers
organic grav vehicles are the preferred method to use when making the drop to
the target world\'s surface.  Such an assault would be slower, and subject to
interception on the way down, but once down, the Army regulars would could
dish out damage an order of magnitude greater than the lightly equipped Jump
troopers, be they Army or Marine.  Any comments?

        IMTU, the answer is a combo of 1,2&3.
        
        a)  Bring PPD to maximum power
        b)  Activate contra-grav
        c)  Retract landing gear
        d)  Let-go tie-down cables, open hangar bay doors, drop umbilicals,
and generally make ready for ship to be free to maneuver
        e)  Begin forward thrust at 10% power along lift-off path with
exponential rate of nose-up until ship angle is perpendicular to gravatic
plane of planet
        f)  Throttle up to 100+% of rated thrust to escape gravity well and
reach orbit & jump-point

An interesting alternative, or combination is to take a page from real
history. Perhaps the sites of pre-human settlements (or even early human
settlements) are merely plundered for pure, superficial value. This would be
much like some of the earliest digs, where knowledge took a backseat to the
gold that could be found.

In the same vein, I saw a bit of anime last night that might be of interest
to folks on the list. I\'m not really a big fan of anime, but it came highly
recommended...

It\'s called "Wings of Honnemaise," and it\'s about the first crawling steps
that a war-torn planet takes into space. The planet itself is very
interesting. The movie focuses on the early space program of one country,
and that country has uniforms and buildings that look like a cross between
some meso-american flavor and China. Very unique. There are some elements of
a religion intertwined as well. The country seems to be relatively low-tech
in some ways: huge crude room-sized computers,  black and white television
and film, early jet power, stuff like that). On the other hand, they\'re
pretty high tech in other ways. Their ground vehicles, for example, seem to
be pretty impressive, and their guns at least look pretty advanced.

The plot starts off relatively strong, but begins to get a bit hokey as the
movie goes on. It gets better towards the very end. The movie has a strong
anti-war message that is core to the plot, so it might not be for everyone.

One of the more interesting elements in the film was the depth of
"background." The movie starts off with sepia-tone line paintings of great
events related to air-travel throughout the history of the planet, their
equivilant of the Wright brothers "first flight," their analog to early WWI
fighters, etc... The film is dotted with black and white newsreels, rocket
test footage, television interviews and  the like.

If you\'re not a huge fan of anime, but you\'re interested in the little
touches that make a world feel "real," you might want to check this one out.

Why do you put Buffalo and Boston above Houston?  Wouldn\'t the first
places in the US to have spaceports be where we already have a
spaceprogram (Califirnia, Florida, Texas, New Mexico, and IIRC
Colorado)?  Do you have or are you planning a web page for this

        Thanks!  The best thing about this approach (or should that be
departure?) is that it nixes the requirement for tail-sitter ships.  If you
can contra-grav an entire freighter, by implication you ought to be able to
build internal compensators as well.  After all, this is an sf game...
Somethings have got to be doable by advanced technology or what\'s the point?

Imperium already, and we might add the ban on chattel slavery in the Warrant
of Restoration as another.

	The question of the slavery ban and Calendar Compliance are easily handled.
The ban on slavery and the authority to impose calendar compliance are both
directly authorized in the Warrant of Restoration, making them inappropriate
precedent for other sorts of intervention which are not so listed.  Those two
areas of intervention are, along with the ban on supporting piracy and
smuggling and the extraterritoriality of Imperial installations, the sole
enumerated checks that the Imperium has over  a member world.
		
	There is one very serious legal problem with the proposal for a written bill
of rights.  Our current constitution, The Warrant of Restoration, lays final
authority on all matters, save only two, with the Emperor.   We know that the
decisions of one Emperor, while theoretically able to change unilaterally the
relationship between Imperium and member world (as per Article 8),  are not
legally binding upon the will of later Emperors.  Therefore, how is this bill
of rights to be established and maintained as a permanent feature of the
Imperial government?  

	So, could an emperor use his unilateral authority under Article 8 of the
Warrant to establish such a bill of rights?  The answer is, of course he
could.  However, the next Emperor could take that list of rights and throw it
away.  Could the Moot exercise its right to prevent such a person from
ascending the throne?  The answer is, again, of course it could.  However,
once the coronation were over, he could use the bill as a dinner napkin.  How
then could this change be accomplished legally?

	The answer is chilling.  The Imperial Moot must vote to dissolve the Third
Imperium and try to form a new government somehow.   That is the sole method
for accomplishing constitutional change.   If the vote to dissolve did occur,
is there anyway to predict what would follow?  The answer is, of course not!
Systems would not be obliged to join the new Republic or Fourth Imperium or
whatever it might be.  Nobles would not have authority to create it.   All
order would vanish, the grab for power would begin, much as if would happen if
an emperor were to be assassinated and no heir who was accepted by the Moot or
the nobility at large would emerge (perish the thought!).  

	If the government proposed were a democratic republic, then the people
presumably would have the right to vote on its inception, a process that could
take up to six years!  And if the local governments were to refuse to let the
referendum take place, what authority could compel it?  And if all systems
allowed the referendum and it passed, is that not proof enough that there is
enough democracy in the Imperium already? 

	No, my dear sir, the cost of a bill of rights that had any meaning or force
is just too great.  To attempt this enterprise would suspend us over a gaping
chasm from which no bottom or hope of rescue can be seen.

Trust me, Clif, none of that is rhetoric in the classical sense,
which is how he was using it.  You might want to compare C-Span
and political campaigns to something like the Federalist Papers.
You might also find it educational to look up the "trivium" and
"quadrivium", and the individual subjects that compose them, in
context.

Does the recipient of a Donosev get the same benefits as the recipient

at a Scout base)?  If so, sounds like a pretty good bargain for the
Scout in question (more cargo space, longer legs...).

We are pretty much on the same track then.  I never thought of the Ziru
Sirka "assimilation" as absolute.  I saw it as a partial assimilation. 
Just the parts they wanted to assimilate: economy, technology,
government, language, and public formality (I consider all of these to
be viable parts of culture).  The remaining parts of culture and the
original language would have remained in the private lives of the
natives.
I agree it would be uneconomical to have a policy of deliberate and
absolute assimilation, especially when it wasn\'t needed.  In any case,
the parts I mentioned above would have undergone changes through out the
rest of the history, especially the Long Night, resurgence or not.

I would say yes; but at the cost of having to spend most of the time surveying

My last word on the subject.

Gunnery Sergeant Carlos Hathcock did indeed have 93 kills.  But he received
the Silver Star for pulling seven fellow Marines out of a burning vehicle
despite the second and third degree burns he had received over 60% of his
body.  He went back into a flaming vehicle three times to make sure all of
his buddies were clear.

If you can\'t admire his skill as a warrior, admire his bravery in the face
of great personal pain and danger.

Yes, exactly!  One advantage of using standard (or near standard)
terms to describe the difficulty of things is you can build a
library of "tasks"...not just for yourself but shareable with other
GM\'s.  Let\'s say I don\'t use MT rules, but I can pick up an MT
adventure with task descriptions and "port" it *very* easily to
another set of rules if it has similar task descriptors.

Nothing says a Task system has to lock you into specific levels.  If
the description says the Task is Difficult, but you think it\'s a
hair easier than that moving your target number down a hair.  

You know, I *do* like the T4 method of adding dice as the task
becomes harder.  Straight T4 didn\'t work well.  What I\'ve seen of
Marc\'s ideas for T5 look interesting, but he\'s still using that
lonely d3..<grumble, grumble>..don\'t like d3\'s.  ;-> Ken\'s KBv2
seemed to work pretty well, but it wasn\'t to my taste to do all the
halving and doubling it required.  Maybe we should run some numbers
with typical GURPS skill levels?

I do the same thing. In PBEM\'s I do *all* the rolling. FTF, I do most of the routine stuff and the players stay in character. For combat and at "crunch time" the players roll.

It wasn\'t the numbers I object to, it was the inelegance of using a single d3 in the middle of a range of d6\'s, but let\'s not restart *that* discussion again! ;->

I\'m quite impressed with The Old Marquis\'s writings - I\'m quite
satisfied that you got into the debate.

I\'ll have to agree with that, although it is certainly on a level
that I\'m fairly sure was never contemplated in the development of
the game.  I wonder how Marc and Loren feel about the way their
brainchild has developed, and the following that it has...

Good question.  Are there any others?  If not, class is
dismissed.

Gallatin and Dilgaadin are both deliberate and considered types,
not wont to fire off quick responses to every post.  But count on
either or both to respond when they feel that well-written posts
need to be responded to.  I also note that Gallatin, at least
(and probably Dilgaadin as well) may allow a thread to develop
for a while, and then address the entire thread.  That\'ll be
indicated in their headers, e.g. "Gallatin 99 resp Solomani Sam
115, 116, The Old Marquis 110, An Imperial Patriot 86"

That\'s sort of an "overflow" from my own real life - as I\'m sure
many here (and elsewhere) have noticed, I post less frequently
than others, but when I _do_ post, I try to make my message
count.  Dilgaadin and Gallatin, being my "alter-egos" for this
debate, would naturally share in that trait.

It touched me, too, when it happened.  That\'s why I posted it.

I don\'t think it\'s _just_ The Old Marquis; I think we\'d see much
the same thing in additional posts from Thucydides and
Prometheus, and I try to maintain the same attitude as both
Dilgaadin and Gallatin.

Well, I am utterly indifferent to your serious umbrage, and am responding to
your obvious ire with nothing but liberal malice in my heart.

I\'d prefer to thank god (or whoever, though I\'m going to avoid that
particular can of worms in this particular post) for men with the moral
convictions to *refuse* such repugnant tasks, even if it meant prosecution. 
(Oh, and while I\'m at it, could someone remind me just what threat the
Vietnamise posed to the Western World again?  It\'s not part of my
bedwetting-liberal-bleeding heart curriculum.)  Y\'see, \'I ain\'t got no
quarrel with them Viet Cong\' either.

I also don\'t recall suggesting that the late Mr. Hathcock did any such
bragging, or that he was anything but a brave man.  I also mentioned that
I\'ve never met him, so frankly I have no personal opinion of him, though I
respect the rights of others to do so (whether they call on personal
experience or not in so doing).  I merely suggested that I highly doubt that
he is the first, last or only individual to display exceptional courage and
unselfishness in hellish situations.

If you wish to take umbrage at my opinions, by all means do so.  If you wish
to dispute my right to hold them, do so in a room with other closed-minded
sods.  I\'m not interested.

Oh, and for the record, I am quite pleased that I am not likely to be going
to war any time soon.  What little time I spent in the infantry when I was
young and stupid was quite enough for me.  I\'m not cut out for life in the
service, and last I looked, even the Canadian Armed Forces (as opposed to
the mighty U.S. war machine) is doing fine without me.  I am proud of my
grandfather (who saw service in WWII), but I have no desire to emulate him. 
Especially by interfering in the affairs of a postage stamp of a nation on
the other side of the world.  I leave that to the professionals. 


>The quiet bravery demonstrated by Hathcock and his peers is a testimonial
>that rare men exist who recognize country before self, and duty before
>personal moral comfort.  We can all learn from such men.

I agree with you with the exception of the \'personal moral comfort\' bit.  If
I make the obvious rebuttal though, you\'ll likely have a frothing coronary
on the spot.  Just because your government says that something (wrong) is
acceptible simply does not make it so.  Moral courage is refusing to do
something odious and accepting the consequences.

(Weary note - I am not suggesting that the individual in question was
morally bankrupt, so don\'t even start down that road.  I\'m saying that Wrong
is Wrong.)


>The next time you feel like slandering the honored dead, try looking
>at the bigger picture before mouthing off. :^(

Please illustrate just where exactly I \'slandered\' the man.  For that
matter, until you do so, I will consider myself the innocent victim of your
brutally slanderous (but remarkably well-written) assault, with the
exception of the smiley, on the grounds that I find noses on smileys to be
irritating.  On that count, I may sue for emotional damage.

To be serious for a moment, I wonder what the individual in question might
say about his hunting down and killing of (93?  I forget) targets in cold
blood.  Would he consider it an admirable deed, or a praiseworthy one?

I make no assertions to that effect, seeing as I never discussed it with
him, but personally I hope that he would find it as brutal and ugly as I do.
 Now *that* would be admirable.

Oh, and one last note to ensure you\'ll loathe me and my ilk forever - by
definition, the dead (honoured or otherwise) cannot be slandered, as far as
my understanding of libel laws etc. goes.  What this has to do with your
tirade, I am uncertain, but I feel fairly certain that you\'ll manage to take
yet more umbrage at it.

You deliberately enlightened him as to the nature of said acronyms (and I\'m
too lazy to look up exactly who y\'all are, but you know who you are, since
you are them).

This means that when he encounters them, as a result of trashing a Donosev,
they will be able to harm him (since he is no longer ignorant of their
definitions).  This is an obvious attempt to get Clif killed, and is as
morally repugnant an act as I have seen on this list in at least five
minutes.

No offense Kenji (like *that\'d* stop anyone wanting to take offense!;) but

Here is my list of known (i.e., canonical) timeline data for the 21st
Century (and after):

1959	First Terran in space
1969	First landings on Luna
1988	International Space University founded at Strasbourg, France.
2011	Oldest settlement on Luna at Archimedes established as a small mining
base.
2013	United Nations Space Coordinating Agency (UNSCA) established
2020	USA (in association with UK and Japan) establishes a mining site near
Copernicus.
2022	Treaty of New York centralizes national militaries under UN.
????	French ONeill colony established
????	Beltmetallfabrik, AG, begins asteroid mining
????	Construction begins on three long range colony ships.
2050	ESA Long Range Colony Mission launched.
2058	Pluto research station established; Terran bases throughout Solar System.
2088	Luna unified as a nation under UN.
2089	Terrans develop Jump-0 drive (TL 9-).
2096	Terrans develop Jump-1 drive (TL 9).
2099	Interstellar mission to Barnard; contact with Ziru Sirka.
2100	Terran outpost at Barnard established.
????	Reactionless thruster invented by Terrans.
2113	First Interstellar War.
2120	Terrans develop Jump-2 drive (TL 10).
2121	Lunar population 60,000.
2121	First Interstellar War ends; UN becomes United Worlds.
2123	United Worlds admits colonies to General Assembly; changes name to
Terran 	Confederation.
2132	Terran Confederation Navy commissions AI robots for naval support staff.
2241	Terrans develop Jump-3 drive (TL 11).


I place reationless thrusters where I do in the sequence because (1) the
ESA Long Range Colony Mission is explicitly noted as using "reaction
drives", and (2) in the Imperium boardgame (which admittedly isn\'t quite
canon) the units in the First Interstellar War can move at .8-.9c using
maneuver drives, which is highly unlikely unless they use reactionless
thrusters.

My last words (for now) on the subject:  If you read what I\'ve written
to-date on the matter, I do.  Never said otherwise.  Never will say
otherwise.  Sacrificing oneself on behalf of ones\' fellows is, to me, one of
(if not the) most meaningful acts a person could ever undertake.

I could OB: Trav this one easily enough (SEH etc.), but I\'d prefer to leave
*real* courage outside the scope of a game.

Interesting!  Why the small steps on either side of Standard?  Other
than that (and different wording on a couple of levels) our two
systems do look remarkablely alike.  The automatic success aspect is
something I don\'t include..that I fudge.

I\'ll have to think about this a little.

I\'m sorry to hear that.  I have found much of the discussion here
to be quite interesting, and generative of ideas, even though I\'m
not running or playing in a campaign at the moment.  I "bank"
this stuff against future suitability.  Traveller is a _very_ big
world; there\'s always something to talk about.  I\'d hate to miss
out on something good just because it\'s of no immediate use to
me.

As in, discussions of and outlines of, and fine-tuning to prevent
grating on the ... improbability ... detector?  By all means, go
for it!

Don\'t limit yourself to history texts; other texts on the social
sciences would probably provide useful insights.  Also, other
science fiction and some fantasy can provide potentially useful
or interesting campaign fodder.

OK, how does the party get involved?  Are they freelance
archologists hired by the university in question?  How does this
become an adventure?

Party involvement?  How is the technological infrastructure

Not unreasonable, but the same old question: party involvement?

Sounds very Vilani - even the taboo against writing could be
weakly justified as a protection against knowledge falling into
inappropriate hands.

I could also see it in some cultures of Far Eastern Solomani
extraction (e.g., Chinese).  But yes, this could also be Vilani
or Vilani-influenced.  Again: party involvement?

>Any comments or suggestions for variations or development? Shall

In general, Go for it!  But an unusual culture is not in and of
itself enough; there has to be reasons for the culture to be the
way it is, and it has to affect the party in some way.  What
you\'ve posted here is more "background" than "hooks" - but if you
can post ideas for _using_ these worlds, you could provoke some
interesting discussion.

Originally the increases were in a pattern: 1, 3, 6, 12.  And the
difficulty modifiers matched the degrees of success with the same
pattern.  This worked out well with my game system (still nameless),
which uses different dice than GURPS.  What I posted here was the
adaptation of that task system to GURPS.  I am still checking the math

Not trolling!  Not not not!  I just wasn\'t around when this stuff came up, and
it\'s important background for MTU.

IMTU, folks in the Spinward Marches have mostly Terran names.  This isn\'t for
political reasons, it\'s esthetic.  Earth has hundreds of cool languages from
which to choose names, while Vland has only one.  I find it dull if everyone
is named Eneri.

So I let about 20% of my NPCs have Vilani names, in amongst the Japanese and
Africans and whatever.  But I need a justification for why so many Terrans and
so few Vilani settled in the Marches and smallpox (or influenza) seemed like a
good answer.

As for the liftoff question, I really want to know what kind of noises to make
with my mouth when the time comes.  Is it like Whhhhhhshhhheeeew?  Or more
like Khwhrrrrrmmm?

BTW, I wish someone could clue me as to what ever became of the lesbian Aslan
pirates, too.

course, is twofold: the development of the jump drive (can I call it the
Alderson drive without getting sued?) and the upcoming First War
against the Ziru Sirka.  That means there will be a core Arc of adventures,
perhaps:

- - terrorism in the asteroid belt smelters impeding system development
- - political shenanigans and sabotage in Alderson drive tests
- - the Revolution on Mars: laying the groundwork for interplanetary
  dispute resolution ?
- - corporate espionage to recover or steal contragrav technology
- - high-tech drugs and drug smuggler rings are nastier than ever (Mars Vice?)
- - an all-new slave trade is born -- colonists or belters cheap!
- - a germinal Scout service created to use the new Alderson drive
- - shutting down an illegal spaceborne biological weapons program, only
   to find out the government is running it...
- - discovering that TerraGov has known about other humans in space...
   and has been covering it up.
- - some kind of subterfuge and intelligence gathering to size up the Vilani

In addition, there are scads of opportunities to create general mayhem
and have bunny-trail adventures to just play with the era:

- - the Jupiter Run: a contest to race custom-built 1-man boats around
  Jupiter.  One million liters of water credits to the winner!
- - the usual trading, prospecting, and corporate intrigue
- - War!  Join the Terran Marines and join the drop troops to crush the
   Martian revolution.  Fight another World War... and survive.
   Hire out as a mercenary to the highest bidder in an asteriod belt full
   of rabid nationalists.
- - Find out just what kind of ruins really are buried on Mars...
- - Even more incredible: track down a trail of ancient manuscripts, eroded
  structures, calendrical monoliths, and other Earth relics to find the real
  city behind the legends of Atlantis, Utnapishtim, the Feathered Serpent --
  buried under our very noses, an ancient base with the key to the
  Alderson effect... or more...

Can anyone think of more plot ideas?

Also, I\'ve been thinking about space travel.  Early on, it may take weeks
to get any distance.  Anyone have an idea what engines and accelerations
Early, Middle, and Late E21 should have?

Okay, I\'m tired and going to sleep now.

Some critiques here:

IMO, not all these suggested spaceports would be, could be, or should
be available throughout the whole century.

Also, as Clayton mentioned above, the highest quality ports are likely to
be where they have been around the longest and are close to large
populations.  Consequently, Texas and Florida should be the premier
ports in the US.  There is a good argument that these locations, and
a few others, are class B today.

Come to think of it, most major international airports will be class C
ports, won\'t they?

Not hardly, given the, IMHO, ridiculously low accelerations of most
Traveller ships.

Streamlining will _not_ generate lift.  You need to have an airframe
to do that.  Streamlining means the atmosphere won\'t rip the thing apart.

I think you\'ve got two options available most of the time, even on the same ship:

 - Reaction Thrusters (Heplar, etc.): Rocket-like.  Thrust directed downward.
 - Contra-grav: \'float\' up.  Used with reaction thrusters on high G worlds for
extra lift.  Probably used almost all the time to start the takeoff, with reaction
thrusters coming later, especially where thrusters can\'t be directed straight
down.  The way I picture it, float of straight on contragrav until you\'re at
an appropriate altitude, whatever that is, and then kick the thrusters to climb
out at an angle.
 - Gravitic Thruster Plates: Not sure.  These are usually described as somewhat
directional, IIRC.  It always seemed to me that gravitic thrusters ought to enable
you to fly like a UFO, i.e., rapid changes in direction, ability to hover and
quickly accelerate (All within G tolerances of course).

Its tough to critique the canon traveller timeline for Terran
space development, since its tough to deal with in the face
of the Real World (tm).

I wonder if it might be worthwhile to totally revise the timeline
so that it makes sense with the Real World as long as it comes
out at the same place.  The two key events being:

2087 Jump Drive
2094 Barnard\'s Star

how about d)  During the First Imperium some members of minor races were
converted to Vilani culture and these are the ones the Vilani noticed
and clamined success with.  Other members of minor races were not really
converted to Vilani culture but just mimiced it to keep the Vilani
happy, when Vilani domination went away so did their need to mimic the
Vilani.  Still other members of minor races never changed, and as a
result of this tended to remain bound to their planets of origin, and
resultingly were less noticed by the Vilani.  After the First Empires
collapse group one disapeared into the cultural mainstream while groups
two and three recreated an new culture for their race that included some
elements of Vilani culture but was primarily composed of their
traditional values.

how about e) As part of their efforts at dividing and conquering during
the Rule of Man the Solomani very strongly encouraged the minor races to
give up Vilani values and this effort was more or less successful.

how about f) The Vilani definiton of assimilated was "Act like a
Vilani."  the minor races did not _think_ like Vilani.  Absent Vilani
domination the need to follow Vilani culture went away.

how about g)  A whole bunch of Vilani converted to Terran culture [this
is cannon].  This whole bunch of cultural Vilani included a bunch of
members of minor races.  They also converted to Terran culture.  Many of
what are perceived by the Third Imperium as traditional cultural values
of that race are, in fact, Earth customs.  [This one opens the door for
all sorts of referee fun - you can (in a silly Traveller universe) make
your Suerreat into stereotypical Rastifarians, your Syleans into

CT\'s Alien modules had some data as do most published sectors (for their
sector only of course).

The Darmine Economic Community survived the Long Night just fine.

MT\'s Imperial Encyclopedia says: [pg 22]

"Darmine: Cultural region in Zarushagar sector.  Darmine had a seperate
but submerged identity within the First Imperium and happily threw off
that domination when the First Imperium fell.  Allowed to flourish by 
the Rule of Man, the community of worlds survived the long Night with
little harm.  Darmine was the major focus of the Illelish Pacification
Campaign (76 to 120)."

MT\'s Referees Manual Cultural Regions of the Imperium Map [pg 102] gives
the Darmine Cultural Region as Subsectors J,K, O, and P of Zarushagar.

Therefore we know that at least one multi subsector polity was able to
survive the Long Night with little difficulty.

The Darmine Economic Community survived relatively unscathed for almost
2,000 years [or as the Darmine would put it twice 4^5 standard years]
from -1,776 to 120 and fell only to Imperial conquest during the
Pacification Campaign, a process that took 44 years.

[Comments following are IMTU and with my version of the Darmine]

The Darmine Economic Community achieved full mature TL 12, with the
exception of Meson weapons and screens, during the Rule of Man.  As the
First Empire retreated from Zarushagar Sector ahead of Terran advances
Naasiraka sold its large Starport at Linborn/Zarushagar to its largely
Darmine worker population of the starport bought it from the Vilani. 
The Darmine had some difficulty making the starport self sustaining as
dutring the First Empire it had been dependant on outside parts and
Vilani technicians, since the Vilani never revealed the secrets of jump
2 to their subject races but with some work and some Terran assistance
the port was able to attain a rating as a solid TL 12 A port.

Ever since then Linborn has been the primary Darmine Starport. However
Linborns atmosphere & biology shows an almost complete lack of the heavy
metals Darmine need in their diet & consequently it has never had a high
population or productive capacity, although extnesive use of robotics
has made its capacity higher than that of many starports on planets with
populations in the billions.

During the ROM, Darmine built small merchant ships, especially the 256
ton Kedil class jump 2 trading ship, achieved a reputation as solid
dependable starships that were also works of art.  [The last recorded
sale of a funcional ROM era Kedil starship, in 1043 to a noble
collector, was for aproximately MCr 1,900 many times its construction
cost 2,000 years ago.]  Linborn is still manufacturing Kedil class
merchants in Milieu 1,100.

[No I do not have full stats for this ship.  The basic Kedil class is TL
12 [although the TL 15 variety is more common later on] Jump 2, 1 G, MT
Armor 44, Computer 2 [4 copies, not the standard 3 copies - extensive
cross checking ciruitry between the 4 computers enables a -1 DM to all 
rolls for Computer related problems and misjumps]. Fuel purification
plants are standard. They are an 2 decked airframe disk [flying saucer]
configuration with manuver drive thrust in the same direction as
deckplan orientation.  The Kedil class has large staterooms, with
interconnecting doors, for all crew. It also has 4 large staterooms for
passengers and 4 low berths but is predominately designed to carry
speculative cargo.  It comes with two turrets.  Factory standard is 1
empty turret and 1 turret with a laser, a sandcaster & space for a 3rd
weapon.  Unusually for a merchant starship the Kedil class comes with
extended duration life support.  It is fairly common for Kedil class
ships to have fuel tankage for Jump 3 even if they are only Jump 2 
[Jump 1 variants are no longer produced as they are not economically
competative with cheaper ships.]

Rumors that high level officials of the Terran Confederation made very
firm demands that the Darmine provide _exact_ information as to the
exact status, & records of all Kedli class ships operating rimward of
Zarushagar circa -2,571, especially those that may have been lost around
that time, were popular among conspiracy theorists of the ROM but were
never confirmed or denied. 

[Don\'t tell the players but Kedil class starships often come with an
extra 1 ton smuggling hold hidden in the engine room & almost impossible
to detect via scan when the ships fushion plant is operational.  Access
to this hold is tight & items stored in it should have a maximum volume
of 100kl each.]

Hi Steve, i don\'t think that would be possible at all. European firsts contacts with
native americans (as i live in Spain, i\'ve studied most the Spanish settlements in South
America) was really a highly lethal event for native americans due to the european\'s
illnesses they brought and native had never had contact before.

But american natives and europeans had been isolated about 5000 or 10000 years only (im
not an archaeologist, does anybody know the exact date america was first settled?) and,
although they had no direct contact all these thousands of years, they lived in the same
world all these time, and they were somewhat similar before they leaved and settled
america (IIRC the firsts settlers were north european or maybe russians across the Bering
Strait...i don\'t know, does anybody?), at least more than Solomani and Vilani between
themselves.

The question is : is this also equal for Solomani and Vilani? When did they became
separated by evolution, maybe hundreds of thousands of years? And they\'ve been living in
very different homeworlds, that have made evolve them inside different conditions...i
think it would be ask too much for a human virus (or any pathogenic microorganism ) that
would also be able to pathogenice a Vilani.

Just my 0.02 pesetas.

I live in Spain, and nowadays, the monetary unit is still the "peseta", although now all banks begin to tell you also in euros the amount of money you have/move.

And UK still has the pound (will not have the euro as the only currency by someday in 2001 i think, because they didn\'t wanted to get in).

Aircraft don\'t weigh what a 40 meter starship does either. And the
aircraft that *do* carry really heavy stuff tend to have multiple gear
and be built low to the ground.

Sorry, but the gear for a tail sitter doesn\'t have to take the sort of
lateral forces that aircraft landing gear do. Landing and braking
produce stresses that have no real counterpart for a tail sitter.

It\'s *just* as easy to *dock* either sort. It\'s internally storing them
that gets a bit odd. 

Cargo transfer depends on a lot of things. You\'ll note that container
ships already have most of the cargo handling gear that would be
required on a perp deck ship. 

And unless you have a good reason for making a large ship in a
non-compact configuration (ie not a sphere, cube, or the like) you need
cargo lifts or other cargo handling gear in the ship anyway. 

Given that most ground to orbit shuttles are fairly small compared to a
*big* cargo ship, it may well be most efficient to dock them at ports
on each deck. That will make cargo handling easier (and faster) than on
a parallel deck (and non-compact) cargo ship the same size, because you
won\'t be trying to funnel everything through a couple of hatches and
moving it all around on the same deck. 

Which is easier? loading from one warehouse and unloading into another,
or doing both from the *same* warehouse? I\'d expect the first to be
*much* easier. So, having multiple decks makes loading and unloading
easier and faster.

Also, ships need to be able to shift cargo on their own. Remember,
while it\'s not as important as in airplanes or oceangoing vessels, trim
is *still* important. You\'ll want to ships center of mass to be on the
main thrust axis (as otherwise you have to waste some power on side
thrusts of some sort). And for manuevering it helps if the moment arms
are kept as short as possible (ie, the heaviest stuff is the closest to
the CoM). 

So ships are going to be shuffling cargo around at every stop, and I
wouldn\'t be surprised if they shuffled to stuff around during jump to
adjust for the fuel used in making the jump. 

And consider. If a "few decks" is better, than you\'ll want then square
or circular, both to minimize the cost of the walls for a given volume,
but also for maximum flexibility in placing cargo and in moving it
around. Warehouses are *not* long and thin! Neither will be cargo holds
in anything where design allows a choice. Ships and airplanes *have* to
be long and thing. Spacecraft don\'t. 

So we wind up with the big circular deck design. The "flying saucer".
And gee, it seems like it\'d be easier to build (and fly!) if the thrust
was perpendicular to that big deck. 

Needle designs are just not practical for large cargo ships. Wedge
designs are a short of compromise for smaller ships. 

I see the big ships being spheres or cubes. And for aerodynamics, some
saucers and a lot of wide, blunt cones. 

Though a big flying wing may just be possible. It does take TL-8 or
better computer-aided controls (that\'s why the attempts in the 50s
failed). But it\'d be a lot *broader* than the standard wedge design.
And it\'s need some *wide* runways. Still, it\'d be a nice passenger
design (because you could "fly" it in, it might make folks more
comfortable, even though it\'d be harder to handle in space). And some
would carry passengers and frieght.

Actually, this is almost certainly a case of ruling that ISPs have to
pay the local phone companies the same per line access charges that
long distance companies do. <sigh>

So it won\'t *directly* affect us. But the most likely *secondary*
effect will be increases in our connect rates.

BTW, the charges go into a pool that is used to subsidize *local* phone
service.

The answer depends on the ship. Some will make like an airplane (as
aptly described elsewhere). Some, the "tail sitters" will lift-off
vertically.

The ones that lift off vertically will start "slow" and speed up. How
slow and how fast the speed up depends on several things. If their max
thrust is only a bit above surface grav, then they\'ll climb pretty
slowly at first, but even so, they\'ll be steadily gaining speed. 

Or they may be required to keep velocity low until they reach a certain
altitude (to prevent sonic booms from reaching the ground). 

And some older ships may even still use rockets! Chemical, fission or
fusion they\'ll be quite a sight to see as they ride that pillar of
flame into the sky. 

Even the vertical takeoff ships will start to angle their path some as
they gain altitude. Partly to get on course for whatever orbit they\'ve
filed for, and partly to take advantage of the planet\'s spin. Here on
earth you can pick up a free 1000 miles an hour that way (at the
equator). Nothing to sneeze at!.

Only thing is, it\'ll be *cheaper* to operate the tail-sitter. Because
it doesn\'t need contragrav as long, and it doesn\'t need as must g-comp.

Hmm. I know the second batch went out at the beginning of January, but I
haven\'t discussed any re-orders with Andy recently (things like TowerCon,
refocusing 101st Spaceborne, GT Shipyard and a few other topics came out
first).

We hope too. I know of 3 more 101\'s in preparation at the moment - ACQ
(with Andy for layout), 101st (progressing slowly), and another Plots style
book. The adventures are also possible but real life time is a pain to get
at the moment.

But we\'ll keep em coming if you guys and gals keep on buying...

	Here\'s a good option for a smuggling hold for you. If you don\'t use it
much its a waste of cargo space, but... <g> We had a group of characters
who didn\'t care much for certain Imperial entanglements.  Mostly they just
carried small arms and such they didn\'t want traced to them or questioned.
Occasionally they carried small amounts of questionable cargo.  It was
quite excellent for hiding a character at one point who had worn out his
welcome in a system.  They were boarded on exiting the system.  The crew of
the customs pinnace performed a fruitless inspection.  Where did they hide
the cargo you ask? Now that is a good question.  They had a Large stateroom
hidden on the other side of one of their LH2 tanks.  It was completely
inaccessible when the ship was fueled.  Their ship was configured to carry
12 months fuel for their reactors and as long as the fuel was in the proper
tank, you couldn\'t get to it.  they had to either dump some  reaction mass
or pump it to one of the tanks for the jump fuel.  The entire setup was
difficult, they always wore enviro suits when accessing it. 

	On this topic.  What\'s the best place anyone has come up with for
smuggling cargo on their ship?

Oops.  I\'m sorry, then.  It\'s just that the plague of Duskir (sp?) used
to be a major trigger for this list, and we just had a discussion about
VTOL/HTOL.

I\'m running the Traveller Adventure IMTU.  The March Harrier has a
miserable 1-g of fusion drive, without significant vectoring
capability.  It also has wheels on the ends of its landing gear.  It
takes off and lands like a jumbo-jet, only its 6000 tons and a jumbo\'s
400.  Starports of class D or higher, with specially prepared airstrips,
are required.

The launch has 2-g of thruster based drive, so by SOM:1 it can take-off
vertically without any problems.  This is my justification for the fat
trader having a launch -- to interface with the places that it can\'t
land at.

Skipping the whole microbial issue, there\'s an excuse written into CT and
MT background materials that takes care of the problem of so many people
having Terran names & habits -- huge numbers of the Vilani assimilated, or
tried their best to, during the ROM.

For national spaceport locations, I picked fairly prominent cities more or

1.  For the late years, all spaceports are upgraded by 1.  And by spaceport,
here\'s what I\'m thinking:

Class E: more or less, whatever flat spaces are available there.  This includes
airports.
Class D: able to refuel most interplanetary fuel systems.
Class C: has launch+maint facilities for reusable, manned boats.
Class B: active shipyards which build various types of sturdy, reusable, manned boats.

Suffice it to say that we don\'t have class B starports in the general
sense of the term.  We don\'t really even have class C starports:
our reusable shuttles land in a desert (now that\'s class E!) -- I
suppose their refuelling stations are tailored only for shuttles.  That
means it\'s a very poor general-purpose refuelling station.  I\'d put
Houston at a G -- the D\'s poor cousin: highly specialized to provide
just enough maintenance to service a very small fleet with a very
narrow purpose.  Sorry, no customers.

In fact, the spaceports should probably be F, G, and H, rather than
C, D, and E, huh?

the module is received in orbit, and a 500-ton raw materials

to Earth.  The low berth components are cannibalized for parts on
Mars, and the module hull is refitted to hold raw materials for

And it wasn\'t just smallpox.  It was a whole host of pathogens and viruses.
Smallpox has the distinction of having been overtly used as a weapon against

No need to get fancy. Top atmospheric speed is a function of drag, which in
turn depends on atmospheric pressure. Top atmospheric speeds are usually
based on 1 atm; as the ship climbs, the atmospheric pressure drops and the
top speed increases. At the level of accuracy of a handwave (i.e., I
haven\'t done the math), this should be sufficient to allow them to fly into
orbit. Ultimately, drag is no longer a factor and you\'re using acceleration
and space maneuvering statistics instead.

1) Humans and Vilani are still interfertile, so their physiology is more than
similar enough for them to catch terran diseases.

2) As others have mentioned, there is in canon just such an event, the Plague
of Duskir.

3) From what I recall of the discussion, things hinged on whether the Vilani,
who, after all, had survived contact with a number of other human populations,
had either developed some better medical treatment, and that the POD was an
aberration, or that _all_ of the human minor races had been removed from terra
long enough so that _all_ of them were susceptible to all the nasties that the
Terrans were inadvertently spreading about the remains of the First Imperium.

4) Disease evolution _does_ in fact occor at a rapid rate, that the Amerind
and European poulations had been isolated for somewhere between 5 and 12,000
years (depending on who you believe in _that_ little current archaeological
flamefest, it could be even longer) is ample time for pathogens to change dramatically.

Also, while smallpox was one of the big ones sweeping through the native
population, so was influenza and measles, which killed almost as many as
smallpox did.

We know for a fact, that syphilis, which the natives gave back, in echange for
smallpox and measles, has abated dramatically in virulence and severity since
it was introduced to the (immunologically) naive populations in Europe. A
similar effect is postulated for the end of the Black Death plagues in Europe
as well.

Viruses mutate even more rapidly that bacteria, as the annual \'new strain of
flu\' is due to passage and mutation through a different species host. 

My own opinion is that the Terrans would have been quite unlikely to resort to
biological warfare. While the Vilani had no real experience with major
infectios diseases, the Terrans had thousands and thousands of years of
written history on the subject, and would consider bio-warfare just too
dangerous a weapon to use; far too likely to turn on it\'s wielder than not.

My own feeling is that the Plague of Duskir was something like the Great Flu
pandemic of 1918; a particularly virulent strain of influenza, but still one
that kills more due to secondary infections than the original disease itself.
The Terrans were likely more resistant than the other populations, the Vilani
had a lifestyle that facilitated rapid spreading of the disease (a more
communal living pattern) and a steady stream of new secondary infection
vectors in the enormous population upheavals of the early ROM years.

That the only ones well equipped to deal with the plague were the Terrans only
added to the problem...it is likely that despite their best efforts, they were
themselves the source of many of the secondary pathogens that cause things
like pneumonia.

I had a similar thought for a smuggling hold once.  But won\'t a good densitometer
see that easily?  It seems a bit on the obvious side to escape without much
scrutiny.

After having some experience assisting the Drug Task Force of the US Attorney\'s
office and talking to FBI, Customs and DEA agents, and Traveller of course,
I\'m convinced that the only way to effective smuggle/hide items that you don\'t
want
to be discovered: put the goods where they won\'t be looked for.  No brilliant
conclusion, of course.

At the time of a search, the authorities know where you are, where you\'ve been,
and very often all of the areas you\'ve had access to.  Having seen the after
effects
of very thourough searches, I think that there is only one kind of thing that
doesn\'t get the scrutiny that it may deserve.  Seemingly solid objects.

Thats not things that appar visually solid, but those that are actually solid.
A normal stud/drywall \'appears\' solid, but we all know, when we think about it,
that its hollow.  But a brick wall is much more solid (depending on the actual
brick of course).   As long as the normally solid object continues to behave
as expected, i.e., doesn\'t sound hollow when you tap it, etc., it will probably
not be examined.  Ok, to starships . . .

The two main methods for smuggling contraband: Hide it or Disguise it.

The Customs Inspectors favorite tool is the Densitometer.  So, the goods need
to be hidden among items of equal density.  Thus, the ideal place will vary with
the
item.  But it seems to me that the denser items, between hull and inner
environment
might be ideal.  No between stateroom walls, or overhead and underfoot.  Those
places are begging to be looked at.  But in the small space between outer hull and
inner
wall.  Might even be worth a weak spot in the armor.

But, IMHO, the best method is to disguise the goods.  Especially if you can break
the goods down into component parts, and mix them with similar looking goods.
Gun barrels can be placed with special piping, etc.

Thats my understanding.  Someone probably has a correct answer, but heres
how I handle it (probably totally wrong):

Ship Acceleration - (World G - CG lift) = max thrust available
So, in your first example: 1G - (1G - 1G) = 1G.
Second: 1G - (1.5G - 1G) = 1G - 0.5G = 0.5G

But then, escape velocity issues has never been an issue for me really.

FWIW: from GT, p.119:
"Any ship with a continuous accelerations of more than 1G can blast
straight up and escape Earth gravity [1G]."  The time listed for this
is 30 hours. Adding CG of 1G, 18 minues.

All of this discussion reinforces my conclusion that, for MTU, that
at TL8+, actually landing on a planets surface would be undesirable
most of the time.

I sort of suspected as much.  IMHO, GNP alone isn\'t really a good
criteria.  It doesn\'t take into account many important economic
effects that will impact the ability to build and maintain a functioning
starport.

I think if you downgrade them all by 1 in the early part of the century,

I don\'t think there is any need to go beyond E and X.

But facilities like Houston are still, IMO, going to be he focus of port
development.  I think they\'re close to B, a TL-8 B. The defining characteristic
to me being that they build spaceworthy ships there.  Though not strictly
a part of the starport criteria, the proximity of the Houston and Texas
facilities to very large populations, prominent sea and air ports, makes
it much more likely for them to be the focus of US spaceport development.
After that, Mid Atlantic (between Boston and DC) and California would be
priorities.

Doug,

	Since, I asked the question in the first place, here are the stats for the
LAG from Book 4
The LAG fires a 20mm, 30 gram bullet at velocities of 400 to 500 meters per
second.  A magazine containing 5 rounds is inserted into the underside of the
weapon ahead of the trigger guard..   One round is fired per pull of the
trigger.  Ammunition includes HE, flechette and 20mm/9mm discarding sabot.  A
sling is provided.  Length is 900mm.  Weight unloaded 4000 grams.  loaded
magazine 500 grams.   Base price 600cr, magazine 20cr.  TL 8.

Looking at the numbers is a little sticky because we don\'t have the totals
for the Imperium.  What I did was look at the present U.S. and Soviet
generic Order of Battle and tried to crunch some numbers from there.  I
guess the thing that is hardest is to see that routinely when you have a
"Corps" (Marine) size unit (50-60,000 personnel) you would have about five
"Army" (200-250,000 personnel) size units.  Each of these Armies would
consist of  two Mech Infantry, one Armor and one Airborne/Air Assault (Jump)
Corps\'.  Lets say that isn\'t the case in the Imperium but that you only have
a Division size (10-14,000 personnel) Jump unit per Army (with company and
battalion sized units placed appropriatly.)  With five Armies that would
give you five Divisions of Jump capable troops.  That still adds up to more
than the entire Marine Corps.  The next point is that all Marines are Jump
certified but only about 10%+ of them are on Jump status.  That total would
come to about 6-8,000 personnel.  Now we\'re back to less than a Division and
the numbers crunch out pretty close to todays actual numbers.  Soviet
numbers come out about the same even though their Order of Battle is quite
different from the U.S.  I\'m not all that familiar with other countries
Armiesd but for the most part I have a feeling that if anything their Jump
forces are even smaller than the U.S.

I think back to WWII and the assault tactics used throughout the campaign.
The real Airborne attacks were done by the Armies including glider insertion
in Europe.  The Marines tended to "Take the beach" in the Pacific campaign
and not do air insertion.  Almost all Jumps in the Pacific were for
espionage purposes.  I can\'t remember how this was done in the Faulklands,
anybody????

That seems to be the direction things are going.  The "per-minute"

Yep, which will affect the sort of things folks in the US do on the

Uh, huh, you know what a blackhole *that* is.

	At the time we hadn\'t considered someone looking by density.   It was
mostly being hidden by the absurdity of putting something there.  All you
have to do is go through the tank of LH2.  People do NOT climb through
tanks of LH2.  Therefore you cannot have a storage location there.  Someone
with a densitomiter could probably find there is a hollow space over there.
 They might have a hard time figuring out WHAT is in the hollow space.
Sometimes interpreting the intelligence is the hardest part of the job.
They never really abused the hold so I picked on them for other things.
I\'ll have to remember this one and have a crooked customs official hold
them up for some CR sometime. <g>  Thanks.

Bacteria aren\'t that specific.  They don\'t see you as an
"organism" but as just a bunch of chemicals and bacteria
are masters of adapting to new chemicals.  There is fairly
far fetched that the Vilani didn\'t have an bacteria to contend
with.

OTOH, viruses are another matter altogether.  They are quite
specific and it seems quite probably that the Vilani didn\'t
have any to contend with from Vland and had very little resistance
to ones from Earth.

Thanks for the dialogue.  I tend to just do something, which means
the product isn\'t perfect, or I try to plan it all out perfectly, which
means it never gets done.  This helps me to decide how credible
my ideas are... so far, I think they\'re defendable; however, Bloo
has good points which are just as defendable: after all, there\'s no
almanac for the future that I know of.  The big issue, of course, is
where the starports should go.  This is such a nasty issue.  I once
posted some cities, off the top of my head, that seemed likely to
have spaceports.  The TML reaction was unpleasant, and I
bathed in a backlash of economics, politics, and other chum for
awhile.  So this time I picked one single statistic and came up
with a list that, over all, doesn\'t have too many detractors.  This
I take as a good sign.


Bloo Respondez:

I sort of suspected as much.  IMHO, GNP alone isn\'t really a good
criteria.  It doesn\'t take into account many important economic
effects that will impact the ability to build and maintain a functioning
starport.

    Yah, what you speak is no doubt true.  However, the difference
    probably isn\'t enough to make me want to look at it... after all,
    if I change one site I probably should review them all... and my
    chances of doing that are... probably Zero!

I think if you downgrade them all by 1 in the early part of the century,
you have no place capable of building starshps, strictly speaking
since C\'s can only repair.

    Yes, sort of correct.  In fact, worlds with only C-class starports are capable
    of constructing starships at their tech level.  Therefore, Earth should be
    capable of doing it too without a B.

> Class D: able to refuel most interplanetary fuel systems.

Won\'t any airport with access to water and a fuel processor meet this
criteria?

    Perhaps.  I assume it can\'t, but I\'m not sure.  If it buys a fuel processor,
    then it will also have to extend its facilities to handle spaceborne traffic
    as well as air traffic.  This might create a nightmare for Air Traffic Authority...
    perhaps it\'s better if the facilities are separated a bit... a bit more... a bit
    more... oh heck, it\'s a different facility completely: a spaceport.

    That\'s what I see.  It doesn\'t have to be that way.  But I think it\'s more
    difficult than it\'s worth to upgrade an airport to handle spaceships.

    I did some guesstimating, and a typical passenger jet displaces around
    400 to 500 tons.  How\'s that for perspective?

Umm, it lands at Air Force bases doesn\'t it?  Maybe C, definitely D.

    I wonder?  Anybody know if the shuttle lands at places other than
    White Sands, New Mex?

I don\'t think there is any need to go beyond E and X.

    Ah, what I mean is to use the Traveller spaceport codes F, G, and
    H, which represent system-service starports.  F is sort of like a C,
    G sort of like a D, and H -> E.  This isn\'t new terminology, just
    not used because Traveller seldom worries about insystem travel.

But facilities like Houston are still, IMO, going to be he focus of port
development.  I think they\'re close to B, a TL-8 B. The defining characteristic
to me being that they build spaceworthy ships there.  Though not strictly
a part of the starport criteria, the proximity of the Houston and Texas
facilities to very large populations, prominent sea and air ports, makes
it much more likely for them to be the focus of US spaceport development.
After that, Mid Atlantic (between Boston and DC) and California would be
priorities.

    You may well be right.  The Houston area can be a large military/
    industrial space manufacturing center, until the orbital drydocks go
    on-line at least.  It doesn\'t even have to be a public spaceport -- it can
    just manufacture modular components, and have a government/military-only
    spaceport. Once space flight is productized and commercialized,
    though, we\'ll want terminals at several major hubs.

    However, I wonder if the shuttle really was built in Houston?  Ah, the
    orbiter was built in California...
    And, it is fuelled and takes off from Florida, and lands in NMex...
    what\'s left in Houston, then, is a control "tower"... and some spent
    Saturn V engines.  There\'s not even a shuttle there...

Sorry to ask but, where did this list come from? Wellington would make a
lousy spaceport - the transport net and industrial base to support it
just aren\'t there. Also, if co-located with the airport, it would be
rather small and very cramped  (also exceedingly dangerous - wellington
is in the top 5 most dangerous international airports in the world.) If
not located with the airport you may as well call it Horowhenua
spaceport or such it\'d have to be so far out.

Can we get it shifted to Auckland? one-third of the countries
population, industry and the best container port in Austrolasia. Plus,
plenty of room for a decent sized spaceport - and all within an hour\'s
drive!!!

Christchurch might also be a good option - smaller city (and Colder!!!)
but the port of Lyttleton is large and very capable.

No, No, I don\'t live anywhere near Auckland.

Note that in GT, vectored thrust makes "tail sitting" vs "belly
sitting" irrelevant.  Also, the ships designed in GT don\'t have
contragrav, so all ships take off by their manuever thrusters.

How a 1G ship takes off from a >1G planet was pretty much
ignored (like in CT).  Presumably (like in CT again) one
can "push" the dirve up for a few dozen minutes.

My approach would have been to simply tell players/GMs that if
they want a ships to take off of a world with more than 1G,
they should give it more than 1G of thrust.  (Otherwise,
you park in orbit and take a shuttle, secondary vehicle,
etc. down to the surface.  Presumably merchant ships would
be designed with something like 1.5 G of accleration so that
they can land on most worlds.

You just travel through the atmosphere at that velocity, as your
altitude increases, so does your top speed.  Eventually you
get out of the atmosphere and reach escape velocity.

This one has been gone over almost as many times as near-C
asteroids, jump torpedoes or Feudal Technocracies.  ;>

I don\'t want to revisit the "will it/won\'t it kill \'em all" issue,
instead I\'d like to ask a question about the physical anthropology
of the human races...

We are told that the minor races were transplanted about 400,000
years ago, correct?  Given anthropology\'s current thought, just
what sub-species of hominids got transplanted?  Surely not homo
sapiens sapiens! We didn\'t exist yet! ;->

A cursory look indicates:

  Homo erectus                  -- ~1,600,000 to 200,000 BCE
  Homo sapiens                  -- ~500,000 to 200,000 BCE
  Homo sapiens neanderthalensis -- ~250,000 to 30,000 BCE
  Homo sapiens sapiens          -- ~100,000 BCE

If the ancients took humans from Earth about 400,000 BCE, they
didn\'t take modern humans, they took late erectus and/or very early
samples of sapiens.  These specimens would have had characteristics
much closer to Homo erectus than modern man.  Since 400,000 BCE a
great deal of evolution has occurred on earth including neanderthal
man and the development of modern man.

This means that the Vilani, Zhodani, and all the other minor human
races will have evolved along separate lines for a long enough time
to have marked physical differences from Solomani humans.  From the
neck down homo has been fairly similar since middle erectus (nearly
a million years ago), but marked changes have occurred to the
structure and shape of the head within the last couple of hundred
thousand years.

Isn\'t it likely that the transplanted homonids would be markedly
dissimilar in many ways, both obvious and internal? 

Who might have retained heavy brow ridges, markedly receding chin,
greater head width at the ear than the top (as in modern humans), or
even heavier (or redistributed) body hair?  And this doesn\'t address
the issues of skin, eye and hair color, or changes in non-boney
features.  Think about the shape and size of lips, the distribution
of fat around the eyes (and the effect on the external appearance of
the eye), hip width (and the effect that might have on the
sub-species\' walk), or such things as leg/arm length.  Then there is
the parallel evolution of these transplanted homonids and species of
their new homeworlds.  There might be time for symbiotic
relationships to arise between these humans and local bacteria,
certainly *some* form of gut bacteria would exist within these
transplanted humans.

Isn\'t it even likely that some of these sub-species will not be
inter-fertile with each other or modern Solomani?

Just some things to think about...;->

If you can get the neccesary permissions (I presume that won\'t be too

No problem at all, though if you could connive a few line drawings

character sketches to show players.

Even better.

 I\'d even be happy to try and contribute something if you wanted.

You know what a kiwi looks like ?

It\'s hard to imagine a foot tall, hairy-feathered, flightless bird
with poor daylight eyesight and a beak that\'s designed only to suck
small insects out of the humus being considered viscious. Especially
as they don\'t run in packs.

Viscious, you hit me with a flower....

Jump troops in the Third Imperium are a bit different from modern
paratroopers.   I imagine that jumping from orbit must have an order of
magnitude greater need for  extensive training and also an order of magnitude
difference (or more) in cost of equipment and training.   You can re-pack
parachutes, and while chute 1 is being repacked, you can make more training
jumps in the same day, at little consumable cost.  A jump capsule, however is
expensive and is used up in a training jump.  The need to make those jumps is
greater because there is even more things to go wrong in an orbital drop than
a plane drop, and It doesn\'t seem prudent to make a marine\'s first real drop
being a drop into a hot LZ.

I\'m just throwing off ideas. If you like them, I\'m sure you can figure
out how they "work" in your TU and how they affect your adventurer\'s
parties. I don\'t expect any of these to appeal to everyone or all of 
them to appeal to anyone.

It\'s a long, long way from a bare UWP to an interesting adventure.  
What makes one C543578-A world (for instance) different from another, 
or even a region of some other world with a similar UWP? Why should
Travellers ever go there, and what might happen if they did? I\'m not trying
to supply the whole answer, just a variety of ways to start looking for
one.

These also might be called "background seeds", since they are 
embryonic and need some development. I\'m limiting them to a paragraph 
or so, and they aren\'t all created equal. Some need more development 
or more ideas combined with them before they can inspire actual adventures
than others do. I prefer to leave this to the individual 
GM\'s creativity. The more work I do on any one of them, the less 
useful and more limiting they are likely to be. I figure a collection 
of such seeds ought to be at least as useful to a GM as a list of 
rumors or patrons or random encounters or equipment. I could use 
other sources besides history, but since I\'ve just begun and 
I think I can average at least two or three ideas per page of 
history book, I\'ll stick with history as my inspiration for now.

Some additional thoughts on the first few:

#1. An institutions wants someone to covertly explore and map
a site claimed by a rival. Only generic mapping skills are
needed: No specialist archaeological knowledge and no digging is
required or even permitted (unless the party happens to include 
someone with archaeology-2 or better). The site may or may not be 
guarded to forestall this possibility. If not, there is a good 
chance that activity at the site will be observed and reported 
to the other claimants.  Or, two different groups claim a site, 
and one needs help in enforcing its exclusive right to dig and 
needs enforcers. Or, there is an illegal but lucrative "pot-hunting"
operation which the PTB want traced and shut down without destroying 
the source. Or the PCs might BE the pothunters, in need of some cash. 
Add environmental  difficulties to taste.

#2. A previously unknown site is rumored to exist (some native
has found it). A university or AAB or government wishes these
rumors investigated, and may send a representative along. Or, the 
TAS or someone wants to publish or update an old tourist guide to
archaeological sites of interest. Add difficulties along the way.

#3. The TL might maintained by the starport city-dwellers, who
trade equipment for food.

#4. Supply your own reason for going outside the safe, comfortable starport
out into the wilds: or find some reason your party got 
stuck out there and needs to get to "civilization".

#5. Since the development of the printing press, Western
civilization has depended heavily on paper. Difficulty finding
appropriate media and religious belief that written word is
sacred might contribute to prejudice against writing.

#6. Just something to think about. You need unusual cultures for 
the same reasons you need Aslan and Hivers.

Weeeeeee thing they\'re plotting somefing.

Cousin Ditzie

PS Weeeeve built a new PAW. It\'s a smallie-wallie atmospheric PAWsie-wasie,
an an an weeeee reckon you could retrofit it into most tankie-wankies. It\'s
built to techie-weckie teeeennnnnn standards, so you can buildie-wildie it
in the boooooooondocks.

It\'s it\'s it\'s a twooooo meter circular-wircular PAWsie wasie, an an an it
has a lap energy-wenergy of fouuurrrr megajoules.

It it is maintains beeeeammmmm intergrity-wegrity for sixty-four
kilometer-wometers in a standard-wandered atmosphere, an an an it can be
fired every two an a bit seconds. It\'s beam pointer-wointer goes for fifty
kiloooometers, so you wouldnt wanna try an an an hit the broad side of
Accounting outside that.

Its its its got fweeeeeeee modes - one lap, fouuurrrr laps an an an
siiiiixteeeen laps. It goes through one cennimeter of crystaliron with one
lap, twoooo cennimeters of crystaliron with fouuuuur laps an an an fouuuuur
cennimeters of crystaliiiiiiron with siiiiixteeen laps.

It\'s got two two twoooooo battery-wattteries ... one tactical battery that
puts out twenny megajoules per second-wekond for thirty-six seconds, an an
an one driiiiiip feed battery that puts out eight hunnerd kilowatts for an
hoooouuuurr.

You can can can fire eighteen one lap shots, or four four lap shots or one
siiiixteen lap shots until you neeeeeed to refill the tactical-wactical
battery-wattery.

Weeeeee think it\'s a pretty neatie-weatie gunnie-wunnie, an an an you dont

Light Rapid Fire Charged Particle Accelerator Weapon - TL10

31 cm radius, 25 cm diameter ROF 24/60s Circular PAW (vol 0.22 m3, 0.22t,
KCr 20)

40 MJ Accumulators ; 3.2 m3, 6.4t, KCr 32 <suitable for 4 MJ/lap>

50 km Beam Pointer ; 0.3m3, 0.3t, KCr 30

20 MWx36s battery ; 1 m3, 2t, KCr 3

0.8 MWx3600s battery ; 1m3, 2t, KCr 3

Crew : 1 - crewstation not included.

Theoretical range = 640 km - remember to apply atmospheric mods

Fire control range = 50 km

DV = 14 @ 1 lap, 28 @ 4 lap and 56 @ 16 laps

Total : 5.8 m3, 11t, KCr 88

Tactical battery has 18 lap/shots in it, and can output one lap/shot every
2 seconds (so it takes 32 seconds to charge the PAW for a full-whammy shot).

Takes 900 seconds for the drip battery to completely refill the tactical
battery (50 seconds per lap/shot).

Needless to say, you could use the vehicle\'s main power plant to refill
either battery.

Despite Ditzie being dead keen on the weapon, it\'s really a solution
looking for a problem. I suppose you could use it as a long-range
anti-missile system in a aerosol-heavy battleground, or as a long-range
sniping tool. I dont think it has enough punch to penetrate armour on even
a TL8 battlefield.

It\'d do a great job on aircraft though.

You could also sell it to lo-tech planets as an anti-ICBM system, although
I have heard nasty rumours about what happens when you hit a fission
warhead with a CPAW.

End users may also retrofit a bigger tactical battery on it.

LOL!

For a serious debate the House of Lords is actually better, but you loose
all the fun of ideologically blinded debate so essential to the Commons.
Except when they debate fox hunting or the Torys reel out the hundreds of
old duffer hereditory Lords who aren\'t sure what century it is.

But that will go as the law is going through to remove all but 72 of them..

The attacks in the Falklands: both the Royal Marines and the Parachute
Regiment deployed by sea IIRC. There was a mix of assault ships (HMS
Fearless/Intrepid), Through Deck ASW Cruisers <grin> (HMS Invincible, HMS
Hermes), Merchants (Ro-ros and liners like the Canberra) and Fleet
Auxilaries (HMS Tristan, Sir Galahad etc). ISTR the SBS deployed by
helicopter behind enemy lines (not sure about the SAS) and that some raids
(Pebble Island?) were conducted using small boats. I don\'t recall any
parachute assaults, but remember I was 11 at the time ;-)

Now, I could dig out the \'South Atlanic War\' reference for Harpoon, and
also Brian Hanrahans\' book \'I counted them all out, and I counted them all
back\' which is a compilation of personal and BBC-TV/Radio reports. Depends
how much you want the info.

There were some other people on the list who are ex-UK services (and
current) who can probably give you some info.

CRUSADE ANNOUNCEMENT

Fm: J. MICHAEL STRACZYNSKI

Well, we took our best shot. Sometimes it works, sometimes it don\'t.

The SciFi Channel programming guys wanted the show; they wanted it a lot.
They crunched numbers for almost two weeks trying to make
it work. But at the end of the day, the problem was that they had already
allocated or spent their budget for the year, and couldn\'t come up
with the huge chunk of change necessary to get an entire season. Had this
come up prior to January 1st, things would almost certainly have
gone differently. But they have their budget, as we have ours, and it was
already allocated.

So TNT will now air the full 13 produced, and that\'s the end of it for now.
I say for now because WB has told us to fold and hold all the
sets, rather than scrap them, because they believe strongly in the show,
and feel that when the ratings come in we may well be able to pick up
a second season. We\'ll see.

Meanwhile, I\'m taking the day off, and deciding which of a number of offers
from networks and studios, sitting on my desk since B5
finished, to pick up. I had declined to go that route so I could do Crusade
and keep playing in this universe, but absent that, there\'s no reason
not to go back to the networks and apply there some of what we\'ve been able
to do in B5 and Crusade.

My thanks to all those who wrote, and called, and emailed, and lent their
support to the process. And I think that when you see the show,
you\'ll be quite pleased by what we did. We\'re all very proud of it.

The Type S scout on the front of the MT Referee\'s companion is orange.

The EDSS Lintula Sunrise was (in it\'s original BITS cover) metal coloured.

The Imperial encylopedia has official sunburst colours  as follows:

Source MT Imperial Encyclopedia Portions (c) 1977 to 1999 FarFuture Enterprises
- ----
Imperial Sunburst: The symbol of the Third Imperium established by Cleon
(the first emperor) when the empire was  proclaimed. Images show him
standing before the original banner with a goldon yellow sunburst against a
black background, representing Capital\'s type G star against dark space.

In 247, the Eliyoh (a non-human minor race) joined the Imperium. To that
race the symbology was unimpressive. The  Eliyoh vision centered in the far
infra-red, which resulted in distinction between the official colors of
black and yellow being impossible. So the Empress Porfiria declared that
the symbol would have no official colour.  The original banner in the
Imperial throne room is still black with a yellow sunburst. The Imperial
lnterstellar Scout Service uses a red sunburst; the Imperial Navy, yellow;
the Imperial Army, black; the Imperial Marines, maroon.

So Orange or red sounds good, but I see no reason why your tan colour
shouldn\'t be viable - it looks cool as wall paper. ;-)

Another factor that should influence what Terran cities of the early
21st century would be considered spaceports is the presence or absence
of aerospace industry facilities (the early shipyards).  Thus, St.
Louis, with the former McDonnell-Douglas main plant, would be a more
logical spaceport than Buffalo.  (Admittedly, I say this as a native St.
Louisan, but I don\'t think that my bias affects the basic logic of this
premise.)

My first Texas site for a shipyard would be Dallas/Fort Worth (what used
to be the General Dynamics plant).  Other logical sites (off the top of
my head) would be Long Beach, CA (the ex-Douglas plant); Seattle, WA
(Boeing); and St. Louis, MO (the previously-mentioned Mac Air plant). 

Of course, if you believe that early starship construction will be
viewed as analogous to seagoing ship construction, then New Orleans, LA
(the Avondale shipyard); Groton, CT (Electric Boat); and, of course,
Newport News, VA (the shipyard where NIMITZes are born) become logical
US sites (among others).

Excuse me, Ross, but my comments about "yada" (Hebrew, not Yiddish) were
etymological in nature, not moral in discussion.  And since when is the
character "Elaine Benes" from "Seinfeld" considered preachy?  If it weren\'t
for her, you probably wouldn\'t be using that expression, and SHE used it in
the context of sex.

It would be immenly difficult to equip the entire Imperial Army at TL-14/15
due to the relative rarity of planets with that TL and the massive numbers of
troops that would probably be at those TLs, too.  TL 14 and 15 worlds will be
able to produce full defense forces at that TL, but how is a TL12 planet going
to?  That TL-12 planet will probably produce TL-12 stuff and donate that to
the Imperial cause.  Look at Invasion Earth, for example.  There are a good
number of TL14 (15 just recently attained at that time) units with a fair
amount of TL 12 and 13 units.  The Solomani Confederation were similar.  I
don\'t think the Imperium would be in the habit of using units of TL lower than
12, but would in times of necessity.  

The Imperial Marines, being smaller, would be far far easier to equip at the
maximum common TL (15 by 1116).

Everything else, I think we\'re in total agreement on.

I dont\' want stand alone adventures necessarily. What I want is for the
mysteries of GT hinted to in G:T and the G:T web page to be more than a lure.
I can write adventures for my group most competantly.  I want to enjoy
consuming what\'s been told to be an "official" mystery...

Would the setting of the New Era be acceptable?  I\'m not sure, but I don\'t
seem to think so... I\'m just not interested in the other settings, except as
background and I already have loads of that.  Even the Regency is sometimes
kinda boring to me (though there\'s a whole lot of possibilities there).

Actually, that expression has been going around Montreal for at *least* 28
years, prolly longer.  Might make sense though - we have a pretty high
Hebrew (Hebrew, Yiddish... I don\'t speak either of them, so it could have
been Swahili to me.  Of course, that crack\'ll get me in trouble with either
my Hebrew-enabled player (Melissa) or my Swahili-enabled fiancee (Tamu), so
I\'m batting 1.000 right now).

Not that that means I knew what it meant or anything....

do some more writeups soon in penance.

Looking at Fifth Frontier War, the Regular Imperial Army forces are all
TL14/TL15.  The colonial forces range from TL8 to TL15.  Two of the
three Army jump troop regiments are TL14; the third is TL15.

OTOH, in my ref\'s TU, most forces in the Spinward Marches (circa 1100)
are TL12, in order to maximize local logistical support.  (In 1100, I\'m
arguing with my ref that my jump troop regiment, the 1199th [not in FFW]
should be upgraded from TL12 to TL14 or TL15.)

I plan to follow up with a summary of the jump troop discussion
(probably tomorrow).  It should be mostly acceptable to those of us
interested in such things.

That what the member worlds pay taxes for, the material investment.  Only
about 10% of a subsector\'s defense forces will be "Imperial Army."  Those
select units will recieve equipment and training that brings them to the
Imperial standard.  The rest of the world\'s Army while be at the local TL.

There are two areas where this breaks down:  Low population worlds, and
worlds with very low (pre-spaceflight) TLs.  The solution in these cases is
to induct individual recruits and train them on a world that has an
Imperial unit.

I envision a Regimental system, where you enlist in the Regiment for your
entire career.  For example, Private Smaltz will be a member of the 45th
Carlie Hill Rifles for his entire term.  Thirty years later, Regimental
Sergeant-Major Smaltz will still be with the 45th, unless he chooses to
request transfer.  

Since slots are few at the higher levels, many officers and senior NCOs
will go back to the regular planetary army.  This is a boon for the planet,
as these officers bring experience with both high tech equipment and other
cultures.  (One oddity of this system is it encourages the "orphans" from
other worlds to remain in place until a slot opens up.  This results in
many units having Regimental Sergeant Majors from dirtball backwaters.

yes, all this stuff is in my GT IA proposal.

entire Imperial Army to tech 14-15 standards you are completely correct.  In
my prior post, I  only considered the "regular" units in the Imperial force
pool.  Those regulars are almost uniformly equipped at tech 14-15, and
notably, the ONLY Army Jump regiments present are regulars.  On the other
hand, there are a whole lot of "colonial" units contained in the Imperial
forces, ranging from tech 8 through 15, with the average appearing to be
around tech 12. Significantly for our discussion, there are NO colonial Jump
units present.  We can assume that these represent the best equipped of the
colonial forces.  In addition to them, virtually every world on the map has
intrinsic army forces, at local tech level, ranging from one battalion up to
over a thousand.  So you are right, the vast majority of Imperial forces are
equipped at less expensive, lower tech levels capable of being supported by
local resources.  However, when an interstellar was breaks out, it appears
that the high command chooses to leave the lower tech forces back to defend
their homeworld, and selects the best of the colonials to bolster the Imperial
regulars.
I\'m still of the opinion that given their unique qualities, Jump troops would
be deployed independantly, and not attached to larger formations under most
circumstances.  Of course, I\'m just speculating based on the info that I have.
If a ref want to say that there are scads of Army Jump troopers in independant
companies or battalions in his universe, who can really say no.  Hope this
helps the discussion.

What is the mission of the Imperial Army?  It is to defend the worlds of
the Imperium.  The Army can afford to carry armored divisions (and corps,
and field armies) because it doesn\'t have an aggressive operational tempo
like the Marines.

The Marines use Battle Dress and fusion weapons.  That amounts to a fair
chunk of change just to equip each trooper.  They also have the Navy on
their side.. they don\'t really need to carry heavy artillery and armor as
organic parts, since 90% of the time they\'ll have direct line to ortillery.

In the Spinward Marches there are four TL15 industrial worlds: Rhylanor,
Mora, Trin and Glisten.  I can easily see these worlds producing enough
equipment to equip the Imperial Army units in the Spinward Marches.

The problem is that "Airborne" troops, even those from space, have to be
supported quickly.  Now matter how good you are, troops will be scattered,
you\'ll lose a certain percentage to injury on landing, and nothing ever
works right.

This is the main wartime mission for Marines.  They blast a landing zone to
allow the big Army shuttles to bring down the "grinding force" of Army
troops and equipment to do the rest of the fighting.  This frees the fleet
up to continue the offensive.

Kayaks were used. My uncle lost the new kayaks his team had purchased -
requisitioned for the SAS or Marines. He used to joke about getting \'his\'
kayak back with a \'kill count\'. 

(Actually, what happened was the supplier redirected the shipment, so
David had to wait for a while. At least, that\'s the story I heard from my
family.)

        Hi, Doug!  1G of contra-grav means that the ship behaves as though
in a micro-grav environment.  Add a 1G thrust, and she can counter act 2G\'s
of gravity well.  Or that is how I do it, otherwise no one in thier right
mind build a free trader with less than 2G\'s.

taste...."

Admittedly, the Hallowe\'en discussion on cannibal Vilani was
entertaining, but that was probably because most of us played it for
effect.  From what I\'ve heard, the original discussion was a bit more
heated.

One point: I\'ll bet that for 90+% of a meteoric assault, the drop marine\'s

I\'ll even venture a guess that once the drop pod splits open, probably
at some altitude (a la _Starship Troopers_), the skills needed are those
that can be taught with parachute drops and/or grav belt training.

It\'s probably one of the electives.

What happened after Saigon fell?  Try moving to Vietnam and tell us how happy
you are there.  Instead you\'ll sit on your probably fat ass, in comfort
provided for you by all the people who\'ve bled and died for your country in
military service, and spout that filth degrading their actions.  Better yet,
imagine yourself in either North or South Vietnam during the war of aggression
by North against the South.  You really want to debate this, try it.  

 ob trav.  There are plenty (though this is likely to be quite charged) I can
envision... Border worlds on the Imperial border.  Name a planet with it\'s
historty unwritten.  Have the unity between Imperial and Solomani and/or
Zhodani border broken by the aggression of one nation against another,
creating balkanization...

Just HOPE there\'s not a war and you get drafted.  Unless you find a way to
worm out of things you\'re not "young and stupid" enough to be "cut out" for.
You might just be old and/or sorry enough to be skipped, though, if you\'re
lucky.

As well as doing what\'s needed when it\'s necessary.  Claiming moral courage
when refusing to do one\'s duty and obeying the laws of his land isn\'t anything
but moral bankruptcy.

You don\'t know what brutal is.  Nearly every (if not every) civilization and

Praiseworthy and admirable, by others, if you read his *conduct* on the
missions he went on, ignoring for a moment the objectives or goals (and
overall strategy), but just *what* he actually did in the progression of such.
You are not physically nor mentally capable and *could* not do those missions,
even if you were so inclined.   Even the characters you might be lucky enough
to roll up and have survive chargen would not be able to accomplish them.

A humble person, as the Gunny was, would never claim such.  Nor the pure valor
and skill with which he conducted himself.  Some, including me, would well
identify that as heroic.

You do read, right Clif?  "Hathcock and his perrs... who recognize that rare
men exist who recognize country before self, and duty before personal moral
comfort."

Hathcock is just an example.  They are too numerous to count who\'s shed blood,
sweat, and tears have given the nice soft, cushy, and irrelevant lives many
lead, in many nations. 

And not just "over there" but also in Hue City, Gettysburg, against the Nazis,
Krauts, Confederates, NVA, etc etc.  Paces almost as numerous as those who\'ve
died.  We can well debate "over there," too.  

I don\'t think you *could* be like them, if the lives of your family, friends,
and neighbors demanded it.  If you displayed the same attitude with the people
in your unit, as you do here, you\'d end up dead, and not by enemy hands,
though it probably wouldn\'t be provable... ;-)

<snip sig>
> Gee, that\'s not a biased opinion!

It only hints at the possible experience and a knowledge of what he speaks,
unlike some...  Get a sig with and/or relate some of your qualifications and
experience, Clif.  Let us all have good knowledge at what you really know, and
in what basis you\'ve formed your opinions.  Maybe we\'ll even get a laugh out
of it.

I like this analysis. This seems like the natural role for the Striker II
Marine Task forces (Battalions of Marine "leg" infantry with an integral Meson
battery). The only question I have is how the Marine armor units in Striker II
(Marine Armored Cavalry Regiments, which have all branches of service, since
it appears suspiciously like an American ACR...) are used? What\'s the ratio of
Task forces to ACRs? Are the ACR\'s saved for REALLY hot LZ\'s? Since they are
mostly grav armor, are they the intermediate waves between the cap troopers
and the assault shuttles? This sounds like an idea for a dissertation to be
read at the Imperial War College... 

Lastly; has the Imperial Guard (9 Jump Troop Regiments with integral grav tank
battalions, a grav tank regiment, and an artillery regiment....SCARY...) ever
been commited to battle? Are they combat elites, or just spit and polish toy
soldiers?

Okay, hows about we take this particular little hatefest of a thread and shove
it were the sun don\'t shine. This is so offensive and so far OT that it ain\'t
funny. War is a monstrosity and never ever is it fair, just or nice. I have said
this before and I will say it again. Who deserves greater respect, the private
who fell on Omaha beach or the quaker who perished in Dachau?

Maybe you could ask my wife and her family about this?  Infact, I will do
you the favor while I am in Vietnam this summer.
I am sure they can explain about the Viet Cong and their enlightened
attitudes.  Perhaps they will even be able to give you some good examples of
why they wanted American help with the Viet Cong and NVA.
I mean, what could be wrong with a group/ideology that imprisoned family
members just because their fathers/uncles/brothers fought against them?
Nothing I guess. Then again you would probably rather stay home and burn
your draft card than help out a country that is danger of losing its way of
life?
Perhaps you could even take the time to explain to my wife why she was told
her father was dead for the first 9 years of her life in order to protect
her from Communist retribution?

See Ya later,

PS. Not even a death wish this time.

The ONLY thing I agree with Ross Coburn on is there will definitely
continue to be more umbrage on this subject.  I don\'t think this will
stop unless we actively try to stop it.  I for one would like to see
this subject off the list despite how strongly I feel about it (actually
I wouldn\'t mind seeing a couple of people being taken off the list ;). I
am asking those who feel strongly on this subject to filter Clif and
Ross to the trash, as I have done.  I think that will be the quickest
way to get back to discussing Traveller.

    I and my associates have been following the debate concerning the
structure of the 3rd Imperium with some interest and, might I add,
trepidation.  I have, after a long period of introspection, and after due
consultation with my peers, have decided to interject a note of
internationalism, if you will, into your discussion.
    In the first place, I recognize then horror with which your culture
regards psionics at your present stage of development, and will attempt to
avoid needless antgonism over the subject. I will therefor not bring up this
subject again.
    Secondly, it seems to me that your debate is missing one object only,
focus.  You debate the properties that an ideal government should possess,
but fail to identify the goal of that government.  A tool without a purpose,
however finely crafted and sturdy, is in the end worthless.  A government
without a goal is equally so.  I believe that if you were to first decide
what exactly, you wish your Imperium to accomplish this year, next year, a
thousand years from now, perhaps you would gain a little more insight in the
means to reach that goal.  As an example, the Consulate is geared to reach
several long term goals:

The survival of our philosophy and way of life.
The happiness of our citizens.
An understanding of the Universe and the being found within.

As an outsider, I would have to admit ignorance of what the average Imperial
citizen would see as the goal of the Imperium, besides perhaps simple
physical security from external enemies.  It is certain that no objectives
are enshrined either directly or indirectly anywhere in the (non-existant)
Imperial Constitution.

    The final note that I wish to make is the strength of the political
system currently enjoyed by the Consulate.  The key point is tha only at the
lowest possible level are representatives elected by the electorate.  In
essence, our government is a hierarchy of councils, each elected by the
council under it, from the members of that council, all the way to the
Supreme Council.  We have the best of both worlds.  While a good politician
may be able to have him or herself elected to the local council, it becomes
progressively more difficult to move up the chain on charisma alone.  For
us, the restriction of the electorate to the nobilty is an established and
successful tradition.  Application of any representative system to the
Imperium would obviously involve a further debate as to the nature of the
electorate.

Finally, on behalf of the Supreme Council and the sophonts of the Zhodani
Consulate, I wish you the greatest of success in your endeavor to improve
your polity.   It is my sincerest hope that our nations will not meet again
on the field of battle, but may remain peaceful neighbors in adversity as
well as prosperity.

I have nothing but respect for the Gunny Hathcock, and had the unfortunate 
duty to let a friend of mine know of his passing when I read of it here. 
 But this is not the forum to either attack, or defend, his life and the

Gunny Hathcock is dead.  Regardless of what you thought of him, he was a 
human being who, at least for one moment, cared more for his companions 
than he did of himself, and selflessly gave of himself to save them.  For 
that alone, he should be honored.

The moment is past.  There is no reason that this conversation need be 
continued on the TML.  We have gone over this ground time and time again - 
and each time we relearn the bitter truth that our beliefs are not 
universally shared, and that other people have just as strong of 
convictions in ideals that may be diametrically opposed to our own.

Right, so just a bit of extra accel (as you mention, even 1.21 G)
will do just fine.  So you design the ship to have that much
acceleration.  It just takes a small tweak of the design.

The response to this post was fairly angry, but after phrases like
"bedwetting liberal drivel" that sort of reaction seems pretty
reasonable. 
 
Part of the response to the quote above included:

That\'s the key to the disagreement.  Some people here believe that some 
actions (in this case killing other humans) is just *wrong*.  Such people 
(myself included) believe that all the laws and commandments by the 
government on how it is you duty to kill "the enemy" in some war doesn\'t 
make it right.

Folks like you seem to believe obedience to the laws of the land and
following the orders of your government is more important than personal
belief.  While that position seriously troubles me, I\'m not about to
object to you holding it. 

However, when someone voiced his belief in some other position and
objected to someone glorifying what he considered mass murder he got
jumped on in a rather vicious fashion by numerous people. 

You may wholeheartedly believe in what you say, but that is no excuse to
flame someone who disagrees.  The initial post complaining about
glorifying a sniper for the number of his kills was not viscous or
hostile, the responses were.

Good sentiments initially, but what you said is that you other soldiers
and ex-soldiers understand honor and we *don\'t*.  If that\'s your way of
trying to calm things down you should rethink you tactics.  I strongly
believe I\'m an honorable person and have a fairly good understanding what
that means.  Likely, you feel that same way.  Are you *certain* your
understanding of honor is correct and mine is not?  Does violently
disagreeing with you because of beliefs I hold very deeply make me a
dishonorable person?  I doubt I\'m the only person who felt insulted by
your above statement. 
  
In any case, let\'s all show some more tolerance and things can settle 
down here.

I just skim read the SA War book - the Pebble Island raid was performed
using Kayaks by the SAS; they deployed on shore opposite the island (it
doesn\'t say how but ISTR helicopters being mentioned) and used the Kayaks
to cross and create havoc.

Do you see the Imperial Army having equipment deployed in place at
strategic worlds with a small guard section, waiting for units to be moved
in following mobilisation. Something like the way some of the US Divisions
had equipment ready in Germany.

If so, wouldn\'t this be a prime target for the Ine Givar / Zhodani Commando
raids, if only to get hold of TL15 kit? Would it be emplaced at a Naval
base as standard?

If you didn\'t do this, you would need a massive lift capability to deploy
the Imperial army. Admittedly, the development of technology means a grav
tank / APC unit becomes its own air support and highly maneuverable, but
we\'re still talking a big lift capacity to move in tanks alone.

What I hear about the "official" rules on CG I dislike intensely. So
this is highly *unofficial*.

The 1 g of CG will neutralize up to 1 g of gravity. But having more CG
than the local grav won\'t help. (you can\'t make the spacetime around
your ship any flatter than flat :-)

So on the 1 g world, you can use all your thrust to accelerate upwards.
On the 1.5 g world, your *effective* upwards accel will be .5 g.

Check out some of Hoagland\'s stuff about the "Face on Mars". Do *not*
buy anything that\'s been printed recently, as that\'s all scam stuff.
You see, we got new pictures of the site from the Pathfinder probe last
year. And it turns out it *was* a trick of the light. So the folks that
are still producing stuff are pure con-men.

Up until you get to the point where you can maintain high acceleration
for *days* at a time, voyages will take *months* or even *years*. And
you\'ll spend months waiting for favorable planetary alignments as
otherwise the fuel costs get *really* ugly.

Being able to maintain .001g or more for months is the first step in
cutting down the trip times. 

Up until that point, all better engines do is make the slow trips
cheaper, and make "faster" but more expensive trips possible. 

We *really* need programs that\'ll track planetary positions and let
refs *easily* plot trips between planets for different ship types.

I haven\'t seen the port list. But do keep in mind the fact that good
spaceport locations are apt to be in places you wouldn\'t normally think
of. For example, there are good arguments for building a commercial
port in the southwestern US once access to space gets a bit cheaper. 

The reasons are that there\'s *lots* of space, good rail access (for
freight) and (VERY important!) natural gas pipelines and electric
power. Those last two give you cheap fuel. 

Also, until we get some really good drives, there will be *major*
advantages to having sites near the equator. There will be large
advantages to high altitude sites. 

So places to keep an eye on are places like Ecuador (equatorial *and*
thin atmosphere!). Possibly New Guinea, as it\'s near the equator and
has a high plateau. Africa doesn\'t really have that many good sites,
though it\'s *possible* that someone may try building an electromagnetic
launcher up the side of Mt Kilimanjaro. And I expect that the Chinese
may try to build some sites on the Tibetan plateau. Oh yeah. Hawaii has
*distinct* possibilities.

But *existing* infrastructure is important too. Still, the Aussies keep
talking about a New Guinea launch site. Ecaudor is more of a reach, but
the folks in French Guyana may eventually decide that it\'s worth the
problems. And Hawaii has got lots of pluses.

   	   I would feel bad for them and their families.  I would respect the
private who fell on Omaha beach more.  I respect someone for what they do.
Unless you tell me the person who died in Dachau was doing something worthy
of respect I have no reason to feel anything other than pity and certain
amount of shame the human race can fall to this point. The soldier who died
on Omaha beach died trying to stop the government who ran Dachau.    I
respect the people that die looking for the lost kid.  It seems like every
year we hear about someone who falls through the ice and dies because they
were trying to save another person who had fallen through.  Everyone dies
at some point.  It may sound cruel & heartless to some, but WHAT did they
die for?

(obtrav)  I see this type of thing in gaming fairly regularly.  Some
characters are selfless, they do what they have to do and are not terribly
concerned about the personal consequences.  When they go out they often
pick a meteoric method of dieing.  Their death means something.  They may
not have accomplished much, but they never quit striving for what they
believe in.  They willingly buy the whole farm.  Other characters  die the
cowards death.  They hide every time something dangerous happens.  Their
party members laugh about them.  Eventually they hide in the wrong place
and they become the butt of many jokes.  This is not to say we should make
jokes about the Quaker above, but to say IMHO you earn respect for what you
do.  Dieing in and of itself does not earn my respect.  War is hell, but
there is a lot of sense in the old saying of "That which does not kill me
makes me stronger."  Some of  the greatest people in history have been
tempered in the fires of war.  I don\'t have to like war to respect some of
the people who have fought and their actions.

Alternatively, make them land & take off with only a partial load or
light load. This adds colour, plot hooks and the hard science feel.

Note that a "1G" Beowulf free trader can pull around 2.5 Gs with an
empty cargo hold, and 2.7Gs if no jump fuel too
(corresponding Empress Marava figures are 2.0/2.3Gs), a bit less if
armed.

If you and your players were really into it, you could make them
calculate the maximum mass of load they could afford to take to/from any
given planet. They are quite likely to forget the "to" requirement until
they are there <weg>. Hey they have library data, they should use it :-)

Rather than have them crash on landing with an overweight load, you
could have the nav computer pop-up a warning when they plot in the
landing course.  They then have the choice of "spacing" some cargo or
not landing.

Question on aerodynamics:

What does air pressure do to drag, and hence max speed in atmosphere?
Is it linear - i.e. double the air pressure double the drag ? or what?

Which brings the question, at which TL become Jump Troops feasible 
for planetary assaults from orbit? Probably most marines are 
High Stellar- equipped, but not all. And certainly not all the Army 
units are High Stellar.

To rephrase it: What is the minimum TL such that you can have Jump 
Troops capable of dropping from orbit into an Standard or Dense 
atmosphere world with a gravity close to 1 G?

TD 11 and Knightfall both mention the matriarchal Rebin Empire in 
Massilia, clearly establishing its pre-Imperial origin. TD 11 has 
library data on their worlds. Also Knightfall, but added soem 
comments on the Rebellion (of course they supported Margaret, but 
they were in a Lucan area... imagine the rest).

I have always found interesting to have that matriarchal Empire a 
mere two or three subsectors away from the Geonee and their 
"protect-the-females-by-isolating-them" attitude. Makes for a 
wonderful adventure... if only I could find the time to write that 
Massilia tour in M:0 that I started writing.... and somebody were 
interested...

IIRC one of IG products, I think it was Emperor\'s Arsenal (?) quoted 
the existence of a "Trentan Federation" in Massilia close to year 0.

Oh, btw, of course IMTU there is a Geonee Confederation which 
survived the long night, but I think thre are n ocanon references. 
Still, FWIW, you can check my homepage. I have there M:0 *corrected* 
UWP data for Massilia, including some Pocket Empires allegiances in 
year 20.

ANY references that would indicate such a doctrine.  Army units may be

their very nature dictates that they remain space-mobile.  The Army seems to
balanced between an offensive/defensive role, where the Marines appear to
built for offensive actions only.  Pre-siting critical supplies for an Army
unit just does not make sense, given that when war DOES break out, they must
remain mobile to perform their offensive role.

As to there being a need for a large Imperial investment in transport capacity
to haul all of these units around, all that I can say is that you are correct,
it would be expensive.  However, it also has been done.  Again, referring back
to "Fifth Frontier War" I see that the Imperial naval forces include  nine
Assault Transport squadrons (8 "Imperial", one "colonial") each capable of
transporting a complete field army with support (c. 600 battalion
equivelents).  So the empire has seen fit to make the investment.  Transports
don\'t get the glory and attention that the capital ships get, but they are an
important component of the imperial navy nonetheless.

You have recently commented   "As an outsider, I would have to admit ignorance

besides perhaps simple physical security from external enemies.  It is certain
that no objectives are enshrined either directly or indirectly anywhere in the

 Imperial Constitution."   

	I find it necessary to tell you that the Imperium does have a Constitution,
namely, the Warrant of Restoration.  And therein lies the goal of the
Imperium.  The Imperium does exist for two reasons, the protection of member
worlds and the fostering of trade among them.  Those are it\'s only purposes.
They are strictly materialistic goals and strictly limited ones.  The reason
for these limted goals is the real, deep philosophical realization that no one
ideology, no one program, no one outlook can satisfy all sophont\'s spiritual
and psycological needs.  Therefore, the Imperium guarentes each world the
right to chart its own course.  

	While the Imperium sees to the physical infrastructure of space travel, the
individual worlds and citizens see to their own needs.  "Each man\'s duty is
the king\'s, but each man\'s soul\'s his own."  to quote the ancient poet.

Among the most useful things thta I have ever found for my campaigns 
are generic world write-ups. Of course, they lack an specific 
interstellar setting, but heck, nobody else out there is 
refereeing neither in Massilia nor Beyond the Vargr Extents, 
so...

	The gaming value of this is that the Archaeologist career suddenly 
becomes much more interesting. However, I suspect this is more likely 
to be generalized either in M:0 or outside the Imperium.

	So the world is balkanized, but the "countries" do not have any 
territories, but rather "own" and follow large animal flocks which 
are difficult to control (this being the reason for nomadism in the 
first place). From time to time, two of these flocks meet, which may 
give rise either to a commercial and cultural exchange, or to a 
bloody war. Of course at TL 7 they are going to be able to roughly 
predict the meeting, so Espionage agencies may mount operations to 
deviate the other flock from its route, which goes to the best 
pastures... and the PCs goal... ops, did you say *world* hook? Got 
carried away... hmmm... if the inhabitants are Vargr, things turn 
even more interesting...

	Not only that, but the world in question has enough mineral ores to 
have attracted industries long ago, and is now a High Pop, Industrial 
world. Easy to justify if the interstellar government wants to 
encourage pollutant industries out of Rich worlds: go to inhospitable 
ones. 
	You would probably end uo with one big administrative startown, and 
dozens of industrial centers. Then, the industries realize that the 
lcoal fauna is edible with some treatment and start feeder industries 
to avoid importing food.

	This is a good one! The individuals from this culture tend to get 
good employments in positions where speed of reaction is important, 
since they are used to have everything in mind and not to rely on 
books...

I see the army as operating mostly on the Subsector level.  Thus the
Marshal of Lunion can focus his attention on what threatens his area.
Units would be posted to strategic worlds on a rotating basis.

POMCUS depots for the 3I?  Neat idea...  One thing that made
POMCUS/Reforger work though was the speed of communication and travel.  You
could stick the entire 24th ID (M) on 747 and have them all across the
Atlantic in a few days, and they\'d know that their equipment was still
there.  With the travel times in Traveller, a division could find their
equipment depot a smoking wreck and a few thousand grinning Zhodani ready
escort them to a POW camp.

Supply caches (big ones) would be scattered throughout the subsector.

Over in alt.folklore.military we\'re having an interesting discussion about
nuclear weapons storage.  In case you\'ve never been near special weapons
storage areas, the guards have carte blanche to use deadly force.  That\'s
how these depots would be guarded.  Cross the line and they will shot to kill.

But that won\'t stop them from trying.

Oddly enough, I was going to design an army transport this morning.

IMTU, the Subsector Navy\'s main job is support.  They provide the bulk of
the tanker and transport fleet for the Imperials.  The Lunion Fleet can
build at TL-13, so they ships of the 43rd fleet are built elsewhere
(Glisten most like), and Lunion pays for the support vessels.

The MACRs are used when the Imperium needs a heavier regular force, but
cannot commit Army troops for some reason.  In the work I\'m doing, there is
one MACR for every twelve Line Regiments.

>Lastly; has the Imperial Guard (9 Jump Troop Regiments with integral grav

elites, >or just spit and polish toy soldiers? 

The only reference to the Guard being in combat comes in theri write-up in
TD #9.  The Guard fought against Adm. Plankwell in a delaying action.
Also, the Illesh Guard was involved in Dulinor\'s coup attempt in 1116.

What\'s interesting is that the units of the guard have divided loyalties.
On one hand, they serve the Emperor; on the other they serve the Duke of
their sector.  The emperor only controls the Household Cavlary, the
Imperial Artillery, and the Marine Guard.

I would imagine that the Guard is much like the US 3rd Infantry (The Old
Guard) in Washington.  Mostly ceremonial, but but trained in crowd control
procedures and ready to fight as infantrymen.

For PBEMs there is no alternative, right? How do players roll in a 
PB-E-M??? I once tried a system, but did not work well: players sent 
a pre-generated list of rolls before the game started, I draw numbers 
from the list... too much trouble for the results.

Yesterday as I sat watching TV and waiting for the Siberian Death Cold(tm)
to go away, I caught one of my favorite movies.. _Tremors_

for those who haven\'t seen it, it concerns a small town in the middle of a
no where desert in Nevada being attacked by powerful burrowing creatures
that are attracted to vibrations.

As I watched, a plot began to form.. the party hits a low tech, low pop
world, and is asked to ferry an official in their air/raft to check on a
settlement that hasn\'t been heard from for over a week.  Once there, the
party finds buildings destroyed and a single body, who died of thirst, on a
roof-top..  the first thing the critters will eat will be the party\'s
air/raft.

Just goes to show that plot and world hooks are everywhere.

Why? The rate of mutation of some of the basic illnesses is 
*incredible.* We can\'t cure common cold because there are just too 
many varieties. So, maybe 99% of the Solomani illnesses won\'t affect 
the Vilani. But the remaining 1% could wipe them out.

I am an spaniard too, and I have my pesetas. I live in Austria, and I 
have my Shillings... but sorry, they do *not* exist. They are an 
illusion, a fractional division of Euro. Pesetas and Schillings are 
as much of an independent currency as are centimos (farctions of 
peseta) or Groschen (fractions of Shilling). You may still have them 
physically, but all what really exists now is the Euro.

Which is an interesting observation for Traveller.....

- ----
The Universal Currency Indicator (add to Economic Extension in UWP)
(Preliminary)

1.... This world uses directly Imperial Credits as currency.

	Most likely for small worlds, subsector capitals (where the Cr are 
printed (?)).

2... This world uses both Imperial Credits and Local Credits (see 3).

3... This world uses Local Credits, which have a fixed rate of 
exchange with Imperial Cr. Hence, they are in reality a fractional 
division of the Imperial Cr.

	Most likely for large worlds heavily involved in interstellar trade.

4... This world uses true local currency (see 5), but Imperial 
Credits are in circulation.

5... This world uses true local currency, with a variable rate of 
exchange to the Imperial Credit. Imperial Credits can\'t be used at 
the world.

	Most likely for old, well-developed worlds, e.g. minor racs 
homeworlds.

6... This world allows the use of all kinds of currencies.

	Most likely for free ports.

Perhaps, for each additional scoutship after the Donosev, Douglas gives
it a dual fusion gun turret or something.

It\'s an urban legend, I tell you!

If you check the tapes, you will find it was "Tom the Cabin Boy"

Another point is that a Traveller ship doesn\'t need to reach escape 
velocity.

Escape velocity just means that if you turn off the engines, you won\'t
fall back to the planet. But a Traveller ship has engines that run
for weeks at 1G, so it can match the surface gravity, provide a little
more thrust and achieve a low orbit after an hour or two if required.
Except that, technically, it\'s not orbitting, it\'s hoverring.

IMTU military and exploration craft are jet black, to reduce sensor
signature. Commercial craft are covered with markings for access ways,
danger zones, corporate logos, inspection certificates, et al, and resemble
race cars.

The ship silhouettes in Brilliant Lances have all kinds of bold markings;
zebra stripes, chevrons, color-coded modules.

IIRC, the Starship Operator\'s Manual (only half-canon) says that most ships
have chamelion surfaces and look like whatever they want.

Actually, "viscous" is fairly accurate.  It\'s gumming up the works,
people are getting stuck in it and can\'t let go....

As this flame-fest\'s viscosity increases, we can expect bandwidth to
slow to a crawl, until nothing TML-related gets through.

ObTrav:  Would there be any use for a compound, the viscosity of which
_increases_ as flame is applied?

Pure idiocy!  The quaker died NOT harming people as a conscientious
objector, non-resistor.  Often, NOT doing something IS a valiant action.
Not stealing, not murdering, not raping, not LYING.  These things are more
valiant than "doing my part" for country.  "Doing one\'s part for country" is
what Duchau a reality.

What makes shooting a man who happens to find himself on the other side of a
border that man drew more valiant than waving at him over said border and
saying, "Good Morning?"  If EVERYONE acted like Quakers and told the
government to go fuck itself when they tried to draft them into a war (where
the Pres had to pull a Pearl Harbor stunt to get the country into it, in the
first place) THERE WOULD BE NO WAR!

NO Private would have to watch his guts gush out on a foreign beach just to
prove his "loyalty" to a country who considers him little more than a number
and a name and sends him to his death under a banner of so-called glory.  NO
Private would have to shove the chosen victim of the day into cramped
quarters with little food.  NO Private would come home thinking his
testicles were bigger just because he did a cowardly politician\'s dirty work
by offing some equally scared former civilian.  (You continue to measure
your manhood by some men\'s standards, not realizing that a boy has become a
man when he stops measuring.)

You talk about honor?  I would be honored to be deleted from this collection
of dopes who continue to buy into the "apple pie" propaganda because they\'re
too afraid to face the fact that they heavily invested their lives in some
very unscrupulous undertakings.

So go ahead and delete me you oh-so-big bad-asses!  A good chunk of you are
empty jar-heads and the few who have engaged in independent thought on this
list wind up having to humbly bow and scrape to the dufus majority.  It is a
sickening spectacle, to watch a man have to cave in to stupidity.

I, for one, am glad that I have the balls to speak my mind without caving
in.

Yet another flame-fest waiting for resurrection! :-)

I seem to recall someone (Bruce, probably, as resident sensor expert)
pointing out that black paint made no difference at typical starship
combat ranges, and therefore military ships could be any colour they liked
without degrading performance.

I suspect the counters in Brilliant Lances were that way because it made
for a more exciting game. Black counters on a black starmap are really a
pain in the posterior. This is the reason all my Traveller ship miniatures
are painted nice bright colours: because they look better when we\'re
playing a game.

IMTU, military ships that may _land_ on planets/moons have appropriate
surface camoflage - those for deep space are painted whatever colour I
think looks cool. However, I haven\'t painted any Imperial Navy ships yet,
so all my military ships are mercenaries and small planetary navies.

The landbridge across the now Bering Straits existed 50,000 years ago.
About 15,000 years ago, the last ice age ended.

The humans that came across the Bering were very slow about moving south.
Recently, archaeological remains of some settlements were found in Peru,
IIRC, that are estimated at about 15,000, substantially earlier than it was
thought there were any humans in the area.

Graham Hancock has a hypothesis about a different culture going to South
America via Antarctica that is interesting.  In "Footprint of the Gods," he postulates
that there _might_ have been a human culture 15,000 years ago and earlier that
had advanced technology, at least relatively.  The technology wasn\'t so much.
He postulates that _if_ they existed, they had accurate clocks (necessary to
calculate longitude), mathematics, some method of viewing the terrain
from altitude, and some good masonry skills.

He characterized everything in sufficiently hypothetical terms that its
not insulting to your intellligent.  And he stays away from the "Chariots
of the Gods"-like theories about humans having been seeded by aliens.

A simple formula for drag is:

D = Cd x 1/2 x rho x V^2

Where:
D is the drag force
Cd is the drag coefficient, a vaguely constant number given by the
spacecraft geometry
rho is the atmospheric density
V is the spacecraft speed

Thus, doubling the air /density/ more or less doubles the drag.  If the
temperature is the same, then this is equivalent to doubling the
/pressure/.

Note, however, that the stratosphere is significantly colder than the
troposphere (where we are).  At high altitudes, while the pressure is a
good deal less than at the surface the reduced temperature means that
the density is not as low as you might think.

Finally, any time that shocks or flow separation are involved this
formula is likely to be pretty badly wrong.

A simple formula for drag is:

D = Cd x 1/2 x rho x V^2

Where:
D is the drag force
Cd is the drag coefficient, a vaguely constant number given by the
spacecraft geometry
rho is the atmospheric density
V is the spacecraft speed

Thus, doubling the air /density/ more or less doubles the drag.  If the
temperature is the same, then this is equivalent to doubling the
/pressure/.

Note, however, that the stratosphere is significantly colder than the
troposphere (where we are).  At high altitudes, while the pressure is a
good deal less than at the surface the reduced temperature means that
the density is not as low as you might think.

Finally, any time that shocks or flow separation are involved this
formula is likely to be pretty badly wrong.

Well, we-the-species did, but not we-the-subspecies.  For whatever that\'s
worth.  

Also, ISTR that the official period of Ancient meddling was -300,000 to

Yes, I think so.  This has come up a lot for me in the question of
languages -- obviously Vilani, Zhodani et al. are more isolated from
Terran languages than _any_ known or suspected Terran languages amongst
themselves; but more fundamentally, there\'s considerable debate &
uncertainty about whether humans even had the capacity for "language" that
far back.  If you believe they didn\'t, then it gets very hard to explain
how the human diaspora subspecies happened to develop exactly in parallel
with Terran humans in the matter of language.

Separate quibble of long standing:  Given the long separation of the
Ancient-transplanted humans from the Terran ones, why the heck are we
still stuck with the terminology of "races"?  Even if we assume they\'re
all derived from Homo sapiens, it\'s harder to justify claiming they\'re all
Homo sapiens sapiens.

There\'s some Ancient-meddled human species trailing of the 3I who were
designed to be non-interfertile, but I forget their name and publication
source.

And then, of course -- if you believe they were actually created by the
Ancients -- there\'s the Sayat :)  Though, y\'know, they believe that
they\'re the original human species and that all the others were
contaminated by fiendish bat-winged ALIEN SEX FIENDS.

    'body' => 'At What Price Gallatin\'s Vision?

"Ridgway"

I shall approach Gallatin\'s polemic from a different perspective than
most of those who have responded.  My question, at this point, is not,
"Are these changes desirable?"  I ask, rather, "Are these changes worth
the costs:  material, military, and moral?"

MATERIAL

Unless I have misread the recent polemic, Gallatin proposes that the
Imperium should focus attention (and thus resources) to "be more
responsive to the needs and desires of [Member] Worlds."  I have a
simple question:  From where will the Imperial government obtain the
resources required to effect such sweeping changes?  After all, "the
Imperium", as such, produces no wealth.  All wealth is produced by the
various Member Worlds.  A portion of the wealth generated by Member
Worlds is siphoned off, through taxation, to support Imperial
activities.  Under the status quo, those activities are largely limited
to military, diplomatic, and intelligence activities.  This is due to
the current policy of focusing Imperial attention on maintaining control
of the space between the stars, and this policy\'s logical extension of
preventing hostile powers from controlling the space between Imperial
Member Worlds.

Gallatin, on the other hand, would devote further resources to meeting
the perceived needs of Imperial Member Worlds, for without Credits in
hand, the Imperial government can offer neither incentives for change,
nor assistance, nor threats.  These resources would have to be drawn
from the very same Member Worlds that Gallatin would have the Imperium
aid.  What benefit would accrue to worlds that would see their wealth
drained away by taxation, only to have a portion of that wealth returned
in Imperial "assistance"?  Admittedly, some worlds would benefit:  those
worlds which produce so little that there is no wealth to confiscate. 
Make no mistake, gentlebeings.  Taxation _is_ the confiscation of
wealth.  It is a drag on the further generation of wealth.  The
inevitable friction of wealth transfers means that we would hamstring
producer worlds, while failing to provide the equivalent in benefits to
non-producer worlds.  There is one more class of citizens that would
benefit from such a change of policy: the Imperial bureaucracy.  After
all, _someone_ would have to oversee the implementation of these
changes.  _Someone_ would have to decide which worlds will have their
wealth drained, and which worlds shall be the recipients of unearned
largesse.  The end result of such a policy will be to discourage
economic growth, in favor of economic stagnation.

MILITARY

Gallatin asserts, almost in passing, that the restructuring of Member
Worlds\' governments would be implemented "by force if necessary."  This
raises three questions:  First, from where will the forces needed to
compel Imperial Worlds to change their governments be drawn?  Second,
how will the Imperium _pay_ for the employment of Imperial forces
against Imperial Member Worlds?  Third, what effect will employment
against Imperial Member Worlds have on the morale and combat readiness
of Imperial forces?

Currently, Imperial forces are sufficient to fight on our various
frontiers, with reinforcement from central sectors.  Would this remain
the case, when Imperial forces are sent to wage war upon Imperial Member
Worlds?  Would those who wield power in the so-called Solomani
Confederation fail to notice that Imperial forces in the Solomani Rim
sector were being diverted from their primary task, halting the spread
of the Solomani Movement, to overthrowing "unresponsive" governments on
Imperial Member Worlds?  Would the Sword Worlders forego the chance to
regain worlds that, prior to the Fifth Frontier War, were member worlds
of the Sword World Confederation?  Within my career, there have been two
wars fought in the Spinward Marches.  With a portion of Imperial forces
occupied with the task of "restructuring" the governments of some
Imperial Member Worlds, the temptation surely would be greater for a new
Outworld Coalition to strike.

Combat operations cost money.  Money for munitions, money to support
troops and ships in a field environment, money to repair and replace
damaged or destroyed equipment, money to train a pool of personnel to
replace casualties.  From where will the Imperium get this money?  I
have already addressed some of the problems that would arise from
increasing taxation.  To this I will only add that "unresponsive"
governments, in need of "restructuring", are unlikely to send in taxes
for the purpose of financing their "restructuring."

Far more damaging than the monetary cost of "restructuring" expeditions
is the toll that these expeditions would take on the morale and combat
readiness of Imperial forces.  The increased OPTEMPO would take its
toll, physically and mentally, on the troops.  Replacement of personnel
and materiel would be harder under field conditions.  In the event of a
major war, forces would be out of position, tied down in combat against
the governments of Imperial Member Worlds.  Most of all, the very act of
waging war against Imperial Member Worlds would deeply distress many
officers and men.  Those of us serve or have served in the armed forces
of the Imperium have chosen to do so to defend the Imperium.  Invading
Imperial Member Worlds, to "restructure" their governments in accordance
with a "New Order", scarcely qualifies as defending the Imperium. 
Additionally, Imperial forces draw their members from numerous Member
Worlds.  Imagine the effects on morale and unit cohesion when personnel
from a given Imperial Member World are serving in a unit that is ordered
to "restructure" that Imperial Member World\'s government, by force.  We
would be asking our troops to wage war upon their homes.

MORAL

The Imperium maintains a moral superiority over its chief human rival
states.  In the so-called Solomani Confederation, thought police (in the
Orwellian sense) ruthlessly enforce a rigid political orthodoxy.  The
Zhodani Consulate employs a _literal_ Thought Police, using psionic
powers to ensure that the populace _thinks_ correctly.  Our Imperium, on
the other hand, allows individual sophonts, and indeed entire cultures,
to exist as they see fit, subject only to the minimal restrictions
contained in the Warrant of Restoration.  Gallatin, however, would have
us abandon this moral high ground, and break the social contract that
exists between the Imperium and its Member Worlds.  I would ask
Gallatin, what of those worlds, such as various worlds in the Solomani
Rim, that are under Imperial military rule?  Will you apply your same
criteria of "responsiveness" to them?  I am sure that the Solomani
Movement party officials are asking the same question.

As it has become popular to quote from ancient Terran entertainment vids
during this debate, I shall do so here.  In this vid, a representative
of an altogether more malevolent Empire than our own places additional
conditions on an agreement already reached with the head of a mining
colony.  When the head of the colony objects, the Imperial
representative states, "I am altering the bargain.  Pray I do not alter
it further."

Is this the path we want our Imperium to follow?

Carlos, there are several techniques you can use allowing the
players *some* influence in "die rolling" even in a PBEM.  The
examples I post below are all for a 2d6 roll..

1.  The player sends a pointer to a *future* number that they can\'t
    influence, and the GM converts that number when it becomes
    current into the appropriate range.  This is the old "postal
    game technique" and works, although slowly.
    
    a.  Temperature of a particular city:  
    
        Atlanta, US, 1999/03/03  
        
        High 63f   63 mod 6 = 3+1 = 4 
        Low  37f   37 mod 6 = 1+1 = 2  roll 6

    b.  High/Low price of a stock:
    
        IBM, 1999/03/03

        High 173   173 mod 6 = 5+1 = 6
        Low  171   171 mod 6 = 3+1 = 4  roll 10
        
2.  The player sends a number for each die and the GM uses that as
    the base for a calculation of a random number within the proper
    range.  It should not matter *how* the player chooses his
    numbers, but he does get a chance to influence the eventual
    "roll."  Here the GM is generating the random number, in
    reality, but the players "feel" that they influence the result
    (and if they are psionic perhaps they do ;).
    
    a.  The player rolls a 1d6 (4,2) twice and sends them.  The GM
        rolls a 1d6 twice (3,6) and adds them to the player\'s
        numbers, then performs division on the totals, reserving the
        remainders.
        
        4+3 = 7 mod 6 = 1+1 = 2
        2+6 = 8 mod 6 = 2+1 = 3  roll 5
        
   b.  The player picks two numbers (17,11) and sends them.  The GM
       performs as in <a> (4,5).
       
       17+4 = 21 mod 6 = 3+1 = 4
       11+5 = 16 mod 6 = 4+1 = 5  roll 9
       
3.  Use an Authenticated Dice Server.  The player uses the server to
    roll the dice and mail the results to the GM.  For information
    on such a server go to http://www.pbm.com/dice or send a post to
    dice@pbm.com with the subject help.
    
    a.  Sample use of the PBM server follows.  I\'ve found the
        pbm.com server to be fast and reliable.  This is the body of
        a sample post...
               
        #P eris@pcola.gulf.net
        #P Carlos.Alos-Ferrer@univie.ac.at
        #C Copies sent to the above addresses
        #S 6
        #C Roll 6 sided dice
        #D 2
        #C Roll 2 of them
        #R 1
        #C Roll them 1 time
        #L 1
        #C Display the results on 1 line        
        #T Test Use of Dice Server
        #C Entitle the post "Test Use of Dice Server"

    b.  I know there are other servers that do this, but I haven\'t
        used them extensively, so I\'d rather not comment on them.
        
Personally, as GM, I still prefer to do the rolling and let the
players concentrate on roleplaying, but these techniques *do* work.

The chances of killing a helo without a sensor-fused round (not to
mention a fire-control system designed around a 200 knot target rather
than a 30mph one) are slight. Isn\'t that what the M-2 on top was for?

ObTrav: Why do so few traveller armoured vehicles carry a single main

Only amateurs torture enemy prisoners of war (EPW) for information.  And
I am a professional.

Let\'s put it this way.  I ask you a question.  You answer, "I don\'t
know."  I don\'t believe you.  I attach a TA-312 field phone to you
(where one might attach a field phone to a person is left as an exercise
for the student), and crank.  Then, I repeat the question.  Sooner or
later, you _will_ tell me whatever it is that gets me to stop cranking
the TA-312.

Now, can I believe what you told me?  Obviously not.

Besides, over 90% of EPW answer all questions truthfully, and to the
best of their ability, just for the asking.  (In the hundred or so
interrogations I did in Panama and the Gulf, only one EPW even _tried_
to avoid answering my questions.)

That\'s why US Army interrogators don\'t torture EPW...for information.

  If it had the right properties it might make a decent fire-fighting compound,
as you could at least hose it on semi-liquid; this would be greatly helped if it
were chemically sensitive to flame rather than just heat-activated :)

I think it is worth it just for the playtest files alone.  The group I am
playing with has already implemented the certification and licensing from
Far Trader, as well as the trade rules, and its not even due out for
another month.

It\'s in the works, not published yet. David L. Pulver (GT: Alien Races I,
GURPS Vehicles, etc.), who wrote the starship design and space combat
systems for GT, is responsible for revising those sections of G:Space in
line with what he\'s done for GT. Other than fixing egregious errors
resulting from the advancing state of the art in astronomy, the rest of the
book should remain pretty much the same.

FWIW, there\'s also a 2d ed of GURPS Special Operations in the works.

Yes and no. (How\'s _that_ for a definitive response ;-) Bacteria do see you as
a food source to graze on, but they also have pretty highly specific
environmental requirements. Though they live everywhere life is possible, that
does not mean they are interchangeable. Human pathogens are minicule
proportion of the population of bacteria. Good thing, too, otherwise we\'d be
eaten alive.

One thing to remember, though, is that all life on this planet shares a
similar \'handedness\', that is, stereoisomers of compounds like amino acids,
etc are all the same stereoisomer. One of the big differences on Vland, was
that the handed-ness of lots (probably all) of such stereoisomers were the
opposite.  You cannot incorporate steroisomer into a protein and expect the
same protein; the reaction sites need to be a very specific shape.

This would definitely inhibit bateria on Vland from getting a start on using
them as hosts.

Of course, this begs the question of what Gramps did with our natural
intestinal flora, which we _need_ to survive, and which are the source of many
of our own pathogens...

Let\'s assume they took archaic Homo Sapiens. 

At this point, we have two factors operating, natural selection, and (in
some cases) genetic engineering by the Ancients.  Combine those two and
you get all sorts of outcomes.  On some worlds humaniti would likely be
beetle-browed and furry, on others tall hairless and willowy, or possibly
even semi-aquatic.  However, a number of varieties would probably look
pretty much like us.  There would almost certainly be numerous folks with
odd racial characteristics.  I could easily see people with blonde hair,
blue eyes and epicanthic eye folds, or even fire-engine red skin and deep
violet eyes.  Clearly the Vilani look reasonably like earth humans, but
there is no reason to suppose they are typical. 

I like this level of diversity, it makes the Imperium look a whole lot
less like the Star Trek Universe, where everyone (other than one or two
minorities tossed in to allege racial equality) is white.  I\'d love to see
more art depicting the vast variations in humanity in the Imperium.  With
all this diversity I would expect many of these varieties to be
cross-fertile, but likely not all of them (especially not the ones who
have undergone significant genetic engineering. 

However, wrt disease resistance, I think things like the flu could easily
infect almost every human species or subspecies out there.  Remember that
these diseases are not simply confined to humans. 

The flu virus can be found in pigs and domestic fowl like chickens and
ducks.  If they can get it, then likely so can any species or subspecies
of humaniti which has not had serious genetic engineering by the Ancients.

Not as far as I know. I think it merely fixes some of the errata. Check the
SJGames website and see the section on errata for GURPS Space 2nd Ed. and it
should bring you up to speed.

I\'m not positive, but I\'m reasonably sure this is the case. I have 3rd and
it looks like it\'s exactly the same (artwork and layout) as 2nd edition.

They definitely launch unmanned flights from there, though.  (Not the

IMTU several planets have human races derived from Homo
Erectus stock.  While the Gukguk are unable to make many
of the vocalizations commonly found in human languages, their
highly advanced sign language was used in early Human/Hiver

I imagine Zhodani interrogations have one person asking questions on key
subjects, to bring it forth in the prisoners mind, while one or more
telepaths read the prisoners thought.  If that fails they would bring in
a specialist to mind probe the prisoner.

To counter this the Imperials would give trainning to all personel with
a security clearance on controlling their thoughts.  Maybe even minimal
training to all military personnel BtC.  This might work to a degree
against reading surface thoughts but how would the Imperials try to
counter the mind probes of the Zhodani?

Any thoughts or comments?

This investment has already been made. All you need to do is militarise all
those Tukera etc Jump-3 and jump-4 freighters.

Makes far more sense than the Imperium building it\'s own transport assets.

That\'s what I just *love* about you, Clif.  While others "cave in"

Well, now we all know what it\'s like to speak from one\'s balls, rather
than one\'s brains...  Thanks for the education.

Folks, I\'m going to apologize in advance to the rest of you (sit down,
Clif. You don\'t get any.) for this blatantly ad homien attack, but I\'ve
really had it with the little mouth breather.   BTW, if any of you are
interested, you can find out more about "Clif" on his web-site:

    http://www.geocities.com/Athens/2602/

I guess if I\'d flunked that many different religions, I\'d be screwed
up as well.

This is my final post on the subject of Gunny Hathcock and any of the
responses generated by the original post.

ObTrav: What type "militant pacifist" organizations or religious orders
do you suppose are present in the 3I?  Do the Quakers and/or their
descendent offshoots still exist?  Try as I might, I can\'t find any
references on this subject in *any* version of Trav (CT, MT, IG, et.al.)

	Drag is linear with air density (rho), and goes as the square of the
airspeed (v).

	IIRC, density and pressure are linearly related for an ideal gas ...

The primary exception would be for drop ships.  These ships have unique
parameters, unless one can construct modular capsule launchers, designed
to match up with a cargo hatch.  (Even there, though, I would want a
drop ship to be capable of at least 3G acceleration.)

Well, the hatred of psionics would likely be a surface thought of
many imperials captured by the Zhodanis.

Also the 1,2,3,4 routing repeated would give boring surface info
for any telepathy baring the mind probe.

In addition, the level of social contamination that the mind probing
Zhodani would have to deal with should they investigate the inner
workings of a imperial mind would likely leave them with a series
of distracting and untasteful thoughts.

One label you would be unlikely to see is "Front Toward Enemy."  ;-)

Lets remember the Kzin telepaths in the "Known Space" stories.
They loathed reading human "grass eaters" minds.
Some of the things they found there really made their jobs diffcult or
impossible.
Same thing might apply to the Zho\'s.
Imagine trying to read a Vilani\'s mind and getting some really horrible
images of eating your Uncle Duke :)
Things are never as easy as you think.

Don\'t most modern governments have the same type of plans?
Rather than the US buying/building several hundred 747\'s or such, don\'t they
have the ability to charter/militarize planes for transport?

Ah; this is perhaps what I\'ve been trying to articulate. Here\'s a way for an
elected representative democracy to work at the local level (where the blatant
dictatorships operate and which my collegues poo-poo as an insignificant
problem; I guess they would change their minds if they lived under one as a
peon...), and yet not become unworkable and unwieldy as my colleuges maintain.

This would work nicely. Each planet elects two councils/congresses. Note that
the pool of citizens eligible to vote would be significantly larger than that
maintained in the Consulate...One council is proportioned based on population,
giving larger planets larger councils, and the advantage. The second council
is identical in size throughout the Imperium, giving the smaller planets the
advantage. These two councils/congresses (whatever you want to call them...)
not only act as planetary legislatures, but vote on representatives for the
subsector congress, who vote for the sector congress reps, who vote for the
domain congress reps,  who vote for the Imperial congress. reps...While this
is not strictly a true representive democracy (it\'s really more of a
representative republic...); it does have a nice blend of democracy and
workability (assuming the numbers are juggled to keep the legislatures in the

Except that the shock of capture usually overcomes normal resistance-to-
interrogation techniques, at least on the short-term.

Consider that, when one is captured, the second worst thing that can
happen to you on the battlefield has just happened.  (The worst thing is
the one that ends with you in a Glad bag.)  The enemy soldiers who have
captured you are shouting at you (in an unknown language), and
communicate with gestures and "Se hablo M-16."  The tie you up,
blindfold and gag you (maybe with 100 mph tape), put you on the back of
a deuce-and-a-half, and bounce you along to a PW collection point.  This
type of treatment continues, until you get to someplace with a trained
interrogator.  The interrogator has you unbound, and speaks to you, in
your own language.  The natural human response to this kind of stress is
to want to talk about what happened.  _That\'s_ why most EPW "break" on
the direct approach (ask, and ye shall be answered).

If it works without psionics, psionics should make things even easier. 
You might get good results from the "non-Galanglic-speaking" guard,
during EPW transport.  No questions are asked, so the EPW don\'t realize
they\'re being "read."  (Surface thoughts, anyway.)

True, true...but I often have difficulty thinking of a good one
exactly when I need it. 

I could probably get just as many out of the daily newspaper or
science fiction, but a world hook drawn from history has two
advantages over those:

a) A variant of it has already passed the ultimate reality check.
b) It\'s possible for it to be well outside my usual experience
and stranger than something I am likely to imagine or believe if
I had imagined it. (See also, "truth is sometimes stranger than

20. A new government has ordered revised versions of history
texts to be used in the schools. Events related to the government
and culture of the current rulers are added or emphasized, while
major events which were interpreted to legitimize the former
government are downplayed and minor ones omitted to make room.
Changes in the arts curriculum are also being proposed.

handicapped because the inhabitants persist in using an old and
cumbersome form of writing that only a few elite can fully
master.

22. A minor alien race remains minor in part because it refuses
to adopt human decimal notation or standards for any of its
technology. All numeric information normally expressed in the decimal
system must be translated into the (superior, of course) duodecimal system.

23. Planetary law explicitly recognizes castes or orders of
society, such as Imperial nobility, planetary nobility, a middle
or gentry class, and a peasant or free servant class. Different
rules and privileges are extended to members of each class, and
many of the relations among them are regulated by law.

24. Planetary law forbids lawyers from arguing a person\'s case.
Each person must argue his or her own, except in unusual cases of
physical or mental disability. [ Your reactions, Bloo?]

     Not so much nations as clans or tribes. TL-7 means you have
options of fencing the animals in, using railway or truck to move
them to market, aircraft to follow them, using miniaturized tags
to identify and locate individuals, coordinate operations by
radio, carrying veterinary or medical kits, and various
possibilities for control. 
     There would probably also be good reasons for not using some
of these options, such as: the animals are necessarily migratory, 
the animals treat humans as predators and show strong,
unpredictable fight-or-flight behavior in their presence.

	Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF). In exchange for a certain amount of
money per month as a "retainer," participating carriers agree to
maintain a certain number of aircraft capable of being converted to
military use. Originally intended as a contingency measure to
maintain capacity to deal with The Big One (i.e. Soviets rolling
through the Fulda Gap). IIRC, it\'s becoming less and less supported,
as Fed Ex, UPS, United, etc. make much more money using the planes
for their own purposes, and weren\'t counting on it being actually
used ...

the officials are, the more they are expected to respect or even submit
to the Imperial Church.  At the same time, secular officers are rampant,
so respect is usually all the church gets.  Which is fine, I don\'t really go
for Inquisitions, so for the most part it\'s a pretty tolerant/liberal
organization, with devotees as well as heretics.  Think of it as something
like the Anglican or Orthodox church, with the strength of the Old
Catholic church.  And if you know lots of history, then take it all
with a grain of salt please, because I don\'t know history so well.

IMTU various religious groups exist in pockets, which can be close
or distant to Imperial doctrine.  They\'re seeded originally from the
homeworlds, and the Imperium doesn\'t meddle or impede them.
Expect the seeded cultures to have taken their beliefs with them.

Of course, this means crusades can be legal.

There are still possibilities here, at least in GT.  Far Trader is assuming
that the really large cargo lines are using "Lighter Aboard Ship" (LASH)
cargo carriers -- c.20-kton starships with  dozen or more non-starship
lighters in the 800-ton range -- for at least part of their cargo service. 
It mentions the feasibility of using this kind of ship to carry squadrons
of system defense boats (a 400-ton SDB masses about the same as an 800-ton
lighter).  There\'s no reason you couldn\'t also use them to carry a
non-starship assault ship as well.  You still have to buy the landing ship,
but not the jump drive and its associated hull and fuel tankage.  I\'d
expect to see a lot of these LASH ships "taken up from trade" in a major
war.

StarMercs has a dedicated assault transport built using  this philosophy.

I\'ve been working on my own TU for a couple of months now, and I\'ve got a
few questions on Ship design doctrines and Rules of Thumb.  (I would
playtest these ideas on my own, but I don\'t have access to Brilliant Lances,
or any other suitable starship combat system.)  Any help, enlightenment, or
insight would be appreciated.

Using either T4 (which I have) or Brilliant Lances (which I hope to
accquire) and design TL\'s of 14 or 15:

1.  Can missiles be targeted with beam weapons at greater than short range?
(And if so, is this an effective defense strategy?  Is adding extra MFD\'s to
allow turrets to fire individually a good idea?)

2.  When turrets are grouped into batteries, why is the damage rating lower
than would be expected if the damage values were simply cumulative?  (Is the
use of MFD\'s for individual turrets a way to retain higher overall damage
values?)

3.  Are Sandcasters effective defenses in Brilliant Lances, and if so what
are good Rules of Thumb for incorporating them into ship defenses?

4.  What is (are) the damage value(s) of "standard" LasDet missiles in BL?

5.  What are some recommended minimum ratings for Armor, Jump Capability,
and Manuever G\'s?

I understand that most of the questions fall into the "painfully obvious"
category, but I don\'t have the materials or local gamers to determine the
answers on my own.

Your best bet is to go to the library and look up back issues of
Architectural Digest.  Not only floor plans, but looks of pictures and
artist conceptions.  Many, many futuristic buildings, along with good
articles on building for climate.

_Sprawl Sites_ for Shadowrun has quite a few standard (or cliched)
locations.. bars, restaurants, etc.,

_Naval Architects Manual_ for T4 was filled with deck plans, but they were
of middling quality.

Because your life is in the hands of these people.

Consider the situation.  Most of your friends are probably dead, you\'re
cold, exhausted, and completely humiliated.  You\'ve ben treated roughly,
restrained and led around.  Suddenly someone speaking English is asking you
a few simple questions.

Torture only hardened the resolve of prisoners in the Vietnam war.  And
they will just tell you what you want to hear.

Probably.  As I think about it, I doubt that drop troops would be a regular
facet of Vilani warfare, not very cost efficient.  I really don\'t think the
Vilani Army would be much more than a hopped-up police force.  Landing
troops is inefficient.

Imagine a world where Truman responded to the North Korean invasion of the
South with multiple nukes.  That\'s the Vilani way.  Unless the world is
absolutely vital, a world in rebellion will simply be bombed until it
surrenders.

So, the Vilani jump troops were probably consider suicide troopers.  Penal
Battalions offered amnesty if they survive their three years or whatever.
(Nice bit of chrome for the IW period there).

>TL 11 seems a bit too soon.

I didn\'t say it was overly efficient.  Picture the difference between the
early Airborne equipment and operations (DC-3s, troops scattered for miles)
to today\'s equivalent: MC-130s and precision drops.  If the Vilani did
consider drop troops expendable, they wouldn\'t have bothered to refine the
technique.  All you need is a capsule that can survive reentry with a
trooper on board.

0 (or 7, your choice)... This world has no currency.  Commerce is
via specie or barter, or other declared valuta.  Most likely in
primitive or medieval cultures.  "Declared valuta" may be
technically a "local currency", e.g., Yap stones or cowrie shells
on some Pacific islands, or actual material goods as with the old
Roman practice of paying soldiers in salt and/or wine.  Freeports
might also accept specie and allow barter in addition to a wide
range of currencies.

"Imperialized" freighters, but I rather doubt it, for two reasons.  
	First, they are described as "Assault Transports", not freghters or simply
transports.  "Assault" implies specialization towards a specific type of
mission.  I envision a typical assault transport as a large vessel, capable of
transporting a complete regiment/brigade, featuring good defensive weaponry,
bombardment missle bays, Cargo holds for the required equipment and
consumables, a gaggle of assault shuttles, and "ortillery" SDBs. Space would
be at a premium, and many of the troopers (probably the enlisted men) would
most likely make jumps in cold sleep.
	Second, Those freighters are good for hauling civilians in comfort, but
pretty inefficient as assault vessels.  They just are not designed to perform
that job.  As an WW2 analogy, think of the Queen Mary.  Yes, it was invaluable
at hauling troops across the Atlantic, but when it came time for any
amphibious assault, it was kept far away.  Civilian liners likewise would make
poor interstellar assault craft, it is far more likely in my opinion that the
Imperium would invest in specialized vessels to perform this vital task.

	I don\'t dislike Clif, I\'ve never met him. Like most other members of
the list, he posts some useful stuff, and starts some useful
discussions. I get annoyed by what I perceive as gratuitous, overly
aggressive and/or offensive responses to other people\'s posts.
Usually, I just ignore them.

	BTW, I\'m not sure what the purpose of this thread is. My biggest
fear is that it\'s going to degenerate IMMEDIATELY into yet another
gratuitous Clif-bashing. Everybody\'s expressed their opinion fairly
clearly--let\'s move on.

Sure. It\'d be worth jump-training all the troops, since even a miserable
little marine detachment on a cruiser could see off a good proportion of
a TL-12/13 force.

If you\'ve got enough marines to hold a landing ground, the army doesn\'t
need assault troops.

The XM-8 got cancelled. Dumb. Only in SciFi can light infantry hold off
armour.

The Marines and the Army went `up the beach\' in landing craft.

Yep. Trouble is, the long-rod structure of the sabot round is vulnerable
to side-impact forces - which is exactly what Kontact-5 does to it. The
armour literally shatters the sabot before it penetrates the hull of the
vehicle.

Hmm at 38-odd ton tank against a 50-something ton tank. You\'ll need an
awfully good transmission & suspension to make good on the weight issue.
Agreed, reliability of the mechanics is an issue with FSU gear.

And the holders of the longest-range tank kill is?

British Army, Challenger I, HESH.

This is kinda just one of _those_ aanswers to the list, as well as to
Mark - Because his comment abount the US vow is well worth thinking
about in a Traveller perspective. A few months ago, I suggesteded to the
author of "First In" that the greatest gift the Solomani had for the
Vilani was that _Truth_ about a system was more important than political
considerations and that scouts even "now" would still think of
themselves that way. This is how we have to view "Clif" - Literally and
figurativly... 

OK, soapbox mode is off. 

No, I\'ll stop now - whatever your response...

Now *that* is an interesting, and truly scarey take on the
religious/political power structure in the 3I!

While it is by no means well developed, IMTU there is a powerful
friction between dominant chruch (the Universal Church of Sylea)
and state.  This is very deliberately modeled after the conflict
between Thomas Becket and King Henry II.  The main difference is
that there is no "Becket" IMTU and the conflict rests mainly between
the minions of the Arch Deacon of the Universal Church and the minions
of the Emperor.  Actually, given that neither the Emperor or the
Arch Deacon can (publicly) appear to be in conflict, most of the
contention and sparing takes place behind the scenes and at the
direction (or direct hands) of trusted subordinates.  By way of
example, think of the Musketeers vs. Cardinal Richelieu, Rochefort
and Milady DeWinter.  It offers a tremendous potential for intrigue
and backstabs galore.

Meanwhile, at TL-11 (or even TL-10), the Terrans draw their jump troops
from paratrooper units, such as the 82d Airborne Division.  Given the
choice between dropping from orbit in a makeship capsule, and being a
"dirty, nasty leg", I know that _I_ would climb into that capsule (Ft.
Benning did a good job of... "indoctrinating" me.)

(FWIW, I changed the "2" jump troop unit to "82", in one of my copies of
_Imperium_.  Made sense at the time....)

Sir:

I must take umbrage at that statement. I\'m an Imperial citizen (though born on
Terra). My parents "voted with their feet" and moved into the Imperium at
great personal and financial hardship. I have had one consistent thread in my
arguements; to give as many sophonts a voice in their government(s), and as
much protection to their personal liberties and freedoms as possible. The
Solomani Confederation fails miserably on both counts. They are a dictatorship
pure and simple, and sadly similar to some of our member planets (which is
what I want to see changed). The Zhodani are a repressive oligrachy. They are
schizophrenic in that their nobles have an excellent representative democracy,
wheras their proles have no personal liberties at all (based on their being
psionically searched at will without warrants for example). The fact that the
noble class is a meritocracy makes no difference....

Sir; I\'m hoping that because of your previous courtesy; you mistook me for a
member of the Confederation and a believer in Solomani supremacy. I view that
individual Solomani can indeed be superior (as can individual Vilani, etc.),
but I have yet to find any scientific proof that any human or non human race
has an overall superiority...

Please attack my postitions and not my backround....

Solomani Sam; a proud patriotic Imperial citizen and also proud to be a true
Solomani (born on Terra)

Perhaps, for each additional scoutship after the Donosev, Douglas gives

That would work if the cargo deck didn\'t extend over
the drives of the cutter by a few hexes.  It\'s hard to get
an exact measure of the overlap, as the Elevator and
hatch on Deck 2 do not line up with the elevator and
hatch on the Cargo... another design issue.   This

Then here\'s an idea for you (based on CT):

On an additional Type-S roll, pull the air raft out.  Fill the space
with an upgraded computer, tied into the main computer.  Makes it _much_
more survivable.  Besides, having extra computer power can\'t help but
improve the sensor data you have to download to get your free overhaul
and fuel.  (That\'s how your contact at Detached Duty sell it anyway....)

One thing about that book (sorry about OT). Why in the world was the Cardinal

that you just went to the trouble of marrying into alliance? I would think
that it would have made more sense to save the queen\'s honor by making the

My dear Sam,

Let me tell you about two favorite hobbies of several of my disreputable
friends ... branch stacking and number crunching.

You propose that each world gets a vote at the legislature. Very well, I
shall fund my friends to set up a number of colonies, on other wise
uninhabited worlds.

We shall therefore get enough votes at the legislature to become a power.

Once we have that power, we will endeavour to become part of a working
majority. Once we have that majority, we will use it - for we are, after
all, reprepsenting the interests of The People and The Worlds.

One of the early things we will do is to create some sort of tribunal that
will stop anyone else grabbing the levers of power the way we did. After
all, if a council representing the Worlds and the People votes not to seat
a member, who is to tell them Nay ?

Far be it from *me* to argue canon, ;-> but MT\'s Imperial

Perhaps that was one of the many typo\'s in MT.

Or assume they took both.  Or assume that the human evolutionary
track is as "bushy" as many anthropologists think and they selected
from among many sub-species of homonid including erectus, sapiens,
neanderthal, and other undefined tracks.

There really isn\'t a reason to think that Vilani should look all
that much like Terrians.  If they do it is only because the authors
of various Traveller publications wanted it that way.

So, would homo sapiens sapiens by inter-fertile with homo erectus,
or more to the point whatever homo erectus or even homo sapiens
evolved into elsewhere?  

I contend that the different "races" of humaniti are more accurately
described as the different sub-species of humaniti.

My dear fellow sophont (with the unlikely nom de plume of "Mother
Duck"):

My wife, the member of our the family who holds an advanced degree in
history, requests that I ask you the following question:

Are you now, or have you ever been, a student of pre-spaceflight Terran
politics?  Specifically, are you a student of the political machinations
imputed to the Terran city of Chicago, during the late 19th to late 20th
century (Old Reckoning)?  She asks this because your means of
manipulating the vote reminds her of the ways in which the "Chicago
Machine" ensured that the Democratic-Republican Party had a reliable
majority, even going so far as not to deny the metabolically-challenged
(read:  dead) citizens the right to vote.

My wife further suggests that, should you embark upon the course you
describe, you must not be so undemocratic as to disenfranchise those
Imperial citizens who are traveling via low berth.  (If you colonize
your target worlds with low berth colonists, and choose not to revive
them until conditions on the colonies on said worlds are sufficiently
advanced to support your colonists, then you can enfranchise these
colonists for _quite_ some time....)

Of course, I have only forwarded this information in the interest of
family harmony....

Assuming that this is the case, then the Rheinmetall gun is still
effective against the vast majority of FSU tanks.  The FSU 125mm gun
(with or without a gun-launched ATGM) can\'t make the same claim
concerning the M1 series, the Challenger series, or (IIRC) other NATO
tanks of similar vintage.

ObTrav:  Can\'t think of one off-hand, since I already asked about the
"Threat Inflation Quotient" among the various intersteller polities.

***FLAME WARS***Part 27

This s**t is precisely why I left the TML several months ago.
Personally, I think both Mark and Cliff were absolutely out of line in
both regard to on-line etiquette and the courtesy one expects one to
give to another regardless of their opinion. I find Mr. Cook\'s comments
just as insulting as I do Cliff\'s. I come from a family that had members
serving in the U.S. military from the Revolution on, my father was in
the military (US Army 1958-62), and I made it as the last stages of MEPS
when the doc\' asked what about that hip (the one I badly dislocated the
year before skiing in 1985). , I would have gladly served in the
military if able, and in my view  war boils down to  that you\'re not
fighting for your country or your service, you are fighting for your
friends around you....BTW. My great-uncle died at Okinawa and another in
Italy, my four maternal uncles have served in the military and one is
now carreer in the Navy. My brother-in-law is a SEAL and he doesn\'t
thinks at all like Mark. But guess what, I was a practicing Quaker for 8
years (and an avowwed leftist) and I believe Cliff\'s representations are
balderdash. Although, I\'m not a Quaker now I\'m very sympathetic to their
views, however, I see the need and requirement for war and warriors. I
view war like I learned in Aikido, it is best rare, and when engaging
it, already allowed  youself to  be defeated by a lesser opponent, but
when forced conflict should be short, intense, and in dire need,
mercilessness. War is evil, unfair, cruel, useless, and all those other
things, but it will outlast poverty and pollution in being a bane to
mankind.

All in all I\'m sick that this flaming  has gone out of hand and I\'ll get
off my soapbox. This is list is about Traveller and its  many
incarnations, and I\'ll gladly hope this stuff will never happen again. I
work sixty hours+ a week, reenact the Civil War, and do a million other
things to boot. After family obligations, the last thing  I want to do
is download my e-mail and be faced with whats been going on here. Here\'s
my paryer for both moderation and MODERATED lists.

No.  I just happened to glance down at one of their gaming tables one day

In reality, I\'m behind in replying due to long hours at work (March release

By "universal" church, did the author mean "Catholic church"(for that is

Wouldn\'t that waste a lot of time (and psi points) reading the prisoners
thoughts without trying to direct them?  There would be large amounts of
useless information (for the Zho military) going through the prisoners
thought: fears of brainwashing, guilt, fallen comrades, morbid thoughts,
and so on.  By asking key questions the pertinent info would naturally
come to mind for the prisoner.  Just in the same way if you told some
one "don\'t think about the color blue" most people would think about the
color blue out of reflex.  Which is why I think Imperial personnel with
security clearances would have been trained not to react that way.

Another tactic: introduce the prisoner to the interrogator (blatantly,
"this is your telepathic interrogator") and sit them down in a quiet
room together.  The interrogator says nothing, simply reading the
surface thoughts of the prisoner waiting for them to try to not think
about important information.  An unconditioned mind would have a hard
time avoiding thoughts that they fear the enemy would want to know.

I definitely agree with you on that.  It would be a necessity for a Zho
interrogator to know the enemy quite well.

I thought Brits were used to bland food.  : )  At least you were feeding

It probably doesn\'t sell well because most aren\'t very well done
(pre-written adventures in general not just GURPS).  Most railroad the
players and GM with linear plots.  If the players don\'t follow the
linear plot (I have found most don\'t) then most the adventure material
was a waste (along with the money you spent).  The best style I have
seen for pre-written adventures was the DGP\'s nugget style.  If
pre-written adventures expanded upon that style (with more options and
outcomes) then I think adventures would sell quite well.
IMHO, of course.

  Probably hostile to the Austrian connection and potential diversion to
southern Europeam adventures, rather than concentrating on dominating the
Rhenish frontier, I\'d guess. The Habsburgs were essentially hereditary
enemies of the French state and its functionaries, no matter how exalted.

  The fact of being in the midst of what amounted to a century of civil war
and disorder may have been a consideration.

  Note also that all of the above makes much more sense than some of the
weirder stuff that went on later.

Too true.

The Vilani would evolve in a different environment for 390,600 years
(by the MT Imperial Encyclopedia dates).  After that they begin to
colonize other systems and would be subject to even further
diversification based on the different environments (to the extent
they interact with their environment anyway).

Thats 375600 years, give or take, before Terrans reach Homo Sapiens.
I hadn\'t realized the time was so great.

Good point.  And fairly persuasive.  But I\'m not so sure about
the rainbow predicted above.  It seems to me that the Vilani would
probably be a consistant Homo Vilani, at the latest, between -20,000
(warbots run down) and -10,011 (Vilani space explorations begin).

This Homo Vilani expands and settles other worlds after that. At this
point,
it seems to me, its likely for these other world to diverge
evolutionarily,
but only racially, i.e, their still one species, IMHO.  This continues
until
the Terrans show up.  All told, about 7500 years.  Not enough time for
extreme variations, especially at modern tech levels.

Then we have 3300 years of Vilani-Terran coexistance.

I\'m not sure Eris was going this far but I will: IMO, its unreasonable to
expect or even hope that Terrans and Vilani are interfertile.  Hopefully,
an anthropologist or bioloist will set us straight here.  I also think
that
Terrans and Vilani are visually distinct in obvious ways.  I have no
idea what those differences should be, but I think they have to be there
based on all the time spent on Vland.  I don\'t have any idea what though.
Maybe skin colors.

Here\'s a suggestion: assume the transplanted Terrans were dark skinned,
i.e, high melanin.  Thats certainly reasonable I think.  Then assume that
the solar radiation isn\'t as great on Vland as on Terra (based on V&V
that might be fair based on the given Energy Absorption of Vland at
74% that of Terra.  The implication is that Vilani need to absorb more
energy,
thus less melanin, and lighter skin colors.  So, darker skin would be
unknown
among later Vilani.  Of course, handwaving interfertility, mixing with
Terrans
means you can have any combination you want.

For the Zhodani, work it the other way.  They need the melanin based on
Zhdant\'s environment, so light skin color is virtually unknown amongst
them.

Maybe it is better to handwave it with the Ancients magic wand and say
Gramps
wanted interfertility.

Seems like I read somewhere that modern "skin" colors are environmental
evolutions that have come into being in the last 100,000 years or less.
Before that we were all the same.

I was just suggesting the possibility that the various minor human
"races" are probably about as close to each other as Terran humans
are to bonos or chimps.  Well, OK, a little closer.  ;->
Personally, this isn\'t my field of expertise, just some questions I
thought might cause some thought.

Oh, and I was also trying to keep some sort of discussion going that
had nothing to do with certain other threads flooding the TML.

BTW, does anyone have any comments on my PBEM Die Rolling Techniques

Hum, I doubt there is much evidence either way.  Has anything other
than bone and stone tools been discovered from that long ago?  I
don\'t think so, but evolutionary change certainly has continued and
as humankind scattered across the globe I can see selection based on
envirnomental factors taking place.

There was also a Traveller adventure in one of the old JTAS\'s called "Day of
the Glow," the storyline was that a bio-weapon (a contagious version of...
porphiria? I probably mangled the spelling) broke out on a planet. The
disease made folks act in a very vampire-like fashion.

When I was rather young I wrote a story in which an intergalactic salvage
crew came across a derelict ship that turned out to be something of a
"prison pod." Kind of like "Space Seed" meets that episode of Buck Rogers
with the goofy space vampire...

It was part of a series of adventures that this poor crew found themselves
involved with. Mostly derivative and juvenile, but fun to write at the time.

Imperium simply adopt the government structure of the Consulate.  I do not
believe that anyone would seriously consider that to be a socially viable
alternative, even were it logically to be demonstrated to be the best case.
I was simply pointing out that for one human state, at least, our system
works, and has for an exceptionally long time.
    As to the needless slanders of our social system, I will not reply, as I
strongly feel that any response will simply draw more xenophobic ire.
    Next, I would say to the Old Marquis, the Warrant of Restoration is by
your very words a hollow document, to be discarded at will as the Emporer
sees fit.  While the Consulate has no written, concrete constitution, social
conditions are vastly different.  I mean no disrespect when I say that no
Zhodani  in their right mind (for whatever reason- please do not go off
about mind control) would ever attempt to usurp or corrupt the rightful
order of things.   You Imperials, with your differing mindset, have
repeatedly shown the need for a clear and enforced chain of responsibilty.
While I see no reason to believe that the Emporer, as an institution, is
inherently wrong, the very power of the position is the weakness of your
entire system.  Remove the Emporer, the rest is as dust.
       Finally, as others have pointed out, given the inherently
duplicitious nature of Imperial humaniti,  many more safeguards would have
to be emplaced than I have outlined.  I am afraid that given the fundamental
differences in our psychology, it would be virtually imposible for a Zhodani
social system to work in the Imperial Enviroment.

Really?  C\'mon... everyone know *.dk stands for... um... shoot... Dakota,
north.  :-)  *.no if for... um... I knew this one...  New Orleans... d\'oh...
that\'s a city!  Um...  I was sure i knew that...  Seriously, half of the
emails sent from family come w/ the .mx because that\'s where they live (though
I see the same symptoms in a couple of them), and one buddy (who\'s half
japanese) emails me from Tokyo.  I know what .ca stands for, amongst others.
I know Hans is from (or at least is at) Denmark.  Others are from (or using a
mail server in) Spain (.es), etc etc etc.

It never ceases to amuse and amaze me that a few of the vocal Canadians on
this list are so quick to point out they\'re not dominated in some (or any or
every, take your pick) way by their neighbor to the south.  The few Canadians
I\'ve met in person, at least that I knew were Canadian, haven\'t had this
complex.  Indeed were people I respect greatly (one was a DI at MCRD San
Diego, though not one of mine, though I think he *was* a Canadian, having
gained US citizenship).

I meant "your country" as "whatever country you happen to be from."  I\'m not
aware if Canada has a draft or not, or if they used one in WWII (the most
recent event to probably necessitate such).  They\'re in NATO, no?  Did they
have any position they would\'ve taken in response to an American/Soviet clash
aka WWIII?   I doubt they\'d have gone the way of the Soviets, but if so
there\'d have to be plans to confront the US, which couldn\'t look anything but
bleak.    In any case, the presumption would be that a big war could or would
happen in the relatively near future and even Canada would respond, though I
guess I\'m willing to be convinced they wouldn\'t.

In any case, relax, i\'m not out to help foster, nor do I believe in, American
Imperialism, nor the domination of my nation\'s northern and southern
neighbors.  Nor the Western hemisphere, nor the globe, for whatever worth any
of that would be.

And in case anyone is really high strung, this whole post is meant with very
light humor.  [insert smiley emoticon here].  Flame if you want, but do so
privately to spare the list, unless u feel the need to share.  I might even
enjoy the personal attention. ;-)

That\'s what Air is for.  : )  

The M2 is the primary anti aircraft and vehicle weapon.  It\'s not *supposed*
to be used against personnel...  The loaders M240 also does air watch, but
isn\'t very useful in that role.  Lastly (or primarily, take your pick),
there\'s teh MPAT round.  It was designed for use against the common FSU helo\'s
(especially Hind\'s), though smaller ones like the Havok and Hokum are almost
guaranteed to be safe IIRC.

Like I said, dubious.  I\'ve heard the publicity around it.  Possible, but
given the relative velocities, I\'m still dubious.  Especially given what I
know they\'re guns can do to us on the frontal arc (and we can still nail them
beyond their max eff. range).

Turbine vs diesel engine.  World of difference.  The T-84 (AKA T-80DU, not
depleted uranium) has gone to a turbine system, but the T-80 and IIRC the T-90
are still just diesel.

And an M1A1 is 68 tons, combat loaded.

And they\'ve got the long, unwieldy gun to show it, too.  I\'ll still w/ the
Rheinmettal. :-)

Like I said only scuttlebutt so far.  155 is getting to big to have a body
load effectively (3-5 sec).  I\'ll believe it when I see it (or at least that
the army has it).

IIRC, there was no glorification of someone who killed "dozens" of people (93
confirmed in this case).  Doug Berry stated something to the effect that there
"would not be his like again,"  what I took to refer to the Gunny\'s humility
and skill & bravery (and specifically the ratio of the above).   That might
well be possible, though I\'m not certain of it. USMC Scout/Sniper school
continues (and i\'m not even going to tell you what they tatoo on themselves,
who knows what conclusions the peaceniks will jump to then!  Hey Doug, you got
one of those?  Just curious.) and like every other necessity of war, learning
on the lessons of prior missions.  The Gunny would be required reading, of
course.

Still, in retrospect, I\'d have limited my reply to Ross (via the list anyways)
with:

<<  What a petty little person you must be.  If that was your intent for the
post,
  you should\'ve emailed him privately, troll.>>

and followed with the rest privately.  Alas, the coulds and woulds.

Presumption is a sane individual.  Noone enjoys killing.  Noone was glorifying
killing.  Gunny Carlos Hathcock was skilled and brave (the definition of
heroic, I can quote Websters New World, 2nd Concise if you really want me to).
Noone was saying the propaganda put out by governments (or anyone else) is
right.  I\'m assuming that\'s not a straw man, too.

As I pointed out, every civilization has held a large difference between the
warrior and the killer.  Some (like the Byzantines might see it as a duty, not
worthy of glorification, but a necessary thing, that did not impugn on the
morality of the warrior).  Other civlizations have glorified it, but noone did
such with the issue of the Gunny.

You have not a clue as to my beliefs, in that regard.  If anything I believe
the opposite.  I\'m enough of a realist to recognize propaganda when i see it
(even when it\'s friendly).  Usually that stuff is laughed off (when its
obvious).  I have a strong will (I\'m as stubborn as they come) and have very
strong beliefs on morality, ones that military service does not conflict with.
I don\'t intend a life of it, but it\'s a useful steppingstone onto other
pursuits.  To claim it\'s amoral is an insult to anyone who\'s donned a uniform,
much less those who\'ve shed their blood and/or died in action, especially by
one who seems to understand little of what he speaks.  Clif is in here too.

They\'ve objected to the slander of the Gunny as a killer, as a murderer.  He
was a good, humble man and Marine, as any biography or work or study on him
will show.  Maybe it was unintentional, in which case there was an
overreaction against Ross.  His subsequent email, in anger, had no place going
to the whole list and what generated the flames his way.

The Rules of Warfare taught are pretty stringent.  You don\'t shoot civilians.
You don\'t shoot a surrendered enemy.  It\'s self policing.  Sometimes people
slip through teh cracks.  Sometimes cracks are made.  The spirit of the rules
are true, though the letter and adherence might not be.  Some say a sniper
might draw close to that line.  Does submarine combat, where preferably you
destroy an enemy that doesn\'t know you\'re there (or by the time he does, he\'s
already in deep deep do-do)?  Does spaceship combat theorized by Traveller
assumptions?  Does planetary bombardment (ala Lucan\'s Black War, or the Vilani
Ziru Sirka and their ruthless subjectation with the Consolidation Wars)?  Many
will say the Reformation Coalition is moral and others will say it\'s not.
Yet who\'s right there, depends on many things.

This is all perfectly relevant to Traveller.  Most, if not the vast vast
majority) of games out there emphasize combat and warfare.  Many might not
head that way, but that\'s by far the most common.  I created a military
campaign so I could readily seperate the two (as well as suspend disbelief...
never could believably get Lancers in some of the missions that were
undertaken.  In T5, the likely biggest section will be on combat and what\'s
not on combat is before and after combat or building the tools to go to or
escape combat.  Likely, most of you ignore the moral considerations beyond
what\'s blatantly obvious (shooting unknown people, innocents, etc), I know I
do with my players.  RPG\'ing is recreational, but some are interestede in a
deeper recreation.  \'Role players\' are in here, as opposed to \'roll players,\'
though neither is inherently superior when the ultimate objective (recreation)
is achieved.

In the strictly military sense, you do not or likely do not.  You\'re coupling
honor with principles, which doesn\'t necessarily follow.  In one sense, honor
is nothing more than a sign of respect and/or regard.  Etc etc.  This is just
out of a dictionary.  It can also be a sense of adherance to principles.  If
Aslan were real do you think you would be honorable to one?  A hiver? A
K\'kree?  Do you eat meat?  An Egyptian Pharoah, an Aztec and European knight
(and the poor from all categories, as well) all have quite different values of
right and wrong, and would each think the other dishonorable in certain
aspects (and thus probably overall).  Maybe you can alter your own principles
to encompass anothers, but in the end, some believe that they\'re conceptions
are the universal ones.  Universal taboos would go in here.  Many social norms
and mores would get linked in here too, depending on where and when you are.
Unless you\'re actively seeking conflict, it\'s probably wise when in Rome do as
the Romans do.

> dishonorable person?  I doubt I\'m the only person who felt insulted by
> your above statement.

Of course, the specific definitions of certain concepts is important.  Looking
them up in the dictionary (as opposed to immediately using one\'s own
conceptions), might not hurt, either.

You want to email me privately, feel free.  It\'s perfectly relevant to
Traveller, though it might not be instantly portable (which is usually the
case here, excepting "rules", designs, and the like) and some might not wish
to to witness it.  In that case, don\'t pay attn, I do it all the time (mostly
w/ a certain unpopular individual right now, it seems, though many times I
barely scan a digest), and I am on the TML-digest.

Both very interesting.  For MTU, several Terran religions root up and spread
into the Vilani during the RoM, notably all of the "big ones" (Catholic &
Orthodox Christianity, reunited along with most of the other sects, Islam,
Judaism, some of the Chinese folk religions and philosophies, Mormanism,
Jehovas Witnesses, etc).  These met up w/ several Vilani religions which were
never entirely detailed, but generalized due to what follows.  A "pagan" one
based on worshipping different of the ancient warbots that fought in Vilani
prehistory, which was adopted by the merchant caste.  A Shugilli oriented one
(where they start looking like Shaman again), and one based on the ruling
caste (karuni IIRC), which is near monotheistic (what do u call it when they
worship one deity, though they believe in many, again?   Of course, they had
their fair share of atheists, agnostics, nominally faithful, cults, etc etc

During the interaction of their pre unified days, they did what religions on
Earth did 0largely, but their accord was not reached by secularization, but by
a union of the philosphies.  I didn\'t work it all out (even if it sounds
unviable even to me), as Vilani subjugation under teh RoM altered these
forever.  Nominally replaced throughout the Ziru Sirka, they really only took
root in certain areas.  In a few places, the local religions went underground
(like the Jews in Spain during the Reconquista) and in others, the native
religions completely disappeared.  During the Long Night, the same sort of
variation took place, leaning back towards Vilani and then native belief
systems (though none fully recovered without some visible influence).

Then of course, the long history of the Imperium and especially the Collapse
change things just as much.  By the New Era, it\'s a readily mixed pot, w/
certain religions (the major Terran ones, the major 3 Vilani ones, numerous
minor races ones (and/or any combination of all of the above) recognizable, in
addition to new ones and alien ones (Aslan aokhar, some Hiver & K\'kree
philosophy (the latter by radical vegetarians), & Vargr, though non human
minor races remained mostly confined to their home territories), having sprung
up and further stewed the pot.

During the Rule of Man and Third Imperium, certain Emperors and Empresses were
adherents of certain beliefs, though the Alkhalakoi (sp?) dynasty was largely
remisiscent of Deism, w/ occassional head-nodding to the Unified Christianity,
Islam, Judaism, and the big 3 Vilani.  

By the time of the New Era, it\'s almost impossible to go anywhere w/o
offending someone.

During an exercise in Alaska, we captured a couple of people from the
\'enemy\' instead of questioning them, they were searched. One had a code
book (I can\'t remember what we called it anymore, the one with the radio
freqs and daily code words, and alphnumeric charts.) and he also had his

I am reminded of a story I was told during one of my many classes about a
pilot who was shot down and to stop his being tortured, began to tell the
VC anything he could make up. Unfortunalty when he was directed to a map
and to point out targets, everything he pointed out was in actuality a real
target. This being one day before a major U.S. offensive. His interrogators
thought he had turned to their side and wanted more from him. I\'m not sure
about the rest of the story but we were cautioned about making things up
incase they turned out to be true.

in most cases, just your presense tells the interrogator a lot. Your

in your pocket.

One year during a class on torture (I think the idea was to learn to
withstand the torture...) Each person was given some info they had to keep
to themselves. One year the tortureres hit upon a unique idea on how to
win. The class lasted past the end of the month and the torture sergeants
made up fake pay stubs/vouchers and distributed them to the \'victems\'.

How about when the laws of the land are morally bankrupt? I don\'t want to
add to the flamefest at all. I do want to say this. Look up Thomas Edison
High School in relation to Vietnam. It has the dual dubious "honor" of
having the most kids drafted and the highest death rate. It happens to be
around the corner from me. It\'s also the school my dad and my uncles went
to. They all got their higher education in Vietnam. This school also happens
to be a short walk from my house.

To get to the point, Edison is (and was) in a dirt poor neighborhood. Dirt
poor. All of the runners up for the honors it "won" are located in dirt poor
neighborhoods. Think about this for a minute, all of you who are bellowing
about honor. We were willing to send the children of our poor as expendable
product. The Vietnam era war machine was in reality a meat grinder with
McNamara, turning the crank. He saw men with families, lovers and children
as nothing more than numbers.

To those of you who served in Vietnam, my heart goes out of you all. My
father did and it breaks my heart to hear him speak of it. For those of you
who bellow loudly about the "honor" intrinsic to such a system think about
that for a few seconds.

I have no quarrel with soldiers. However, I do have quarrel with those who
choose to say that the people who dodged the draft are morally bankrupt when
the very draft and the war machine it was part of were not only morally
bakrupt but clearly and obviously evil. Any responses, flaming or otherwise,
should be sent to semo@pil.net .

The Americas were probably first settled by humans during one of the
periods of low sea level during Ice Ages. At those times, you could
*walk* from one to the other (the "strait" was a land bridge).

A mere 100k to 200k years is not evolutionarily significant for a
species with generational times as long as humans. Remember,
diseases can cross from chimps and gorillas to humans, and we are
seperated from them by 3 to 4 *million* years of evolution.

For that matter, *all* the races of "humaniti" in Traveller are the
same species according to the most *basic* test. They can still
interbreed, so they are the same species. 

And finally, keep in mind that diseases such as influenza *regularly*
cross from humans to farm animals and back.

Depends on the resolution of the densitometer. Personally, I\'d hide a
person in a special suit inside a water tank. The densities are
*awfully* close, and the life support tubes can be fine enough that the
densitometer will miss them.

LH2 is so damned light (as in "not dense") that damn little will match.

It *may* be possible to set up "baffles" that will smooth out density
variations.

Well, there will be spots where the armor is extra thick due to joints
and the like. It might be possible to build in special "voids" there
that wouldn\'t weaken the armor.

Likewise, there are many volumes onboard a starship that are hazardous
for people, but may have no effect whatsoever on various types of
contraband.

Actually, the Shuttle lands at Kennedy when the weather is favorable.
It uses an extra-long, extra-wide strip. And in an emergency they can
use most large airports.

Kennedy and Baikonur (and probably the ESA facilities in Guyana) have
to handle a lot of different vehicles. Lots of "disposable launchers".

Not necessarily. At worst, they\'d have to make adapters between
fittings. LOX, LH2, and several types of liquid hyrdocarbon (ie
kerosone, and related fuels) are avialable. That pretty much covers the
likely fuel types.

Houston is not a "port" facility at all. It\'s a traffic control center,
with some attached admin and testing/certification facilities. 

We have three major ports. Kennedy Space center at Cape Canaveral. The
former Soviet facilities at Baikonur. The ESA facilities in French Guyana.
The USAF facilities at Vandenberg probably rate a close fourth. 

After that we get the Chinese, Japanese and Indian launch facilities.
The rest of the countries that have satellite launching capabilities
are pretty far down the list.

Depends. LH2 fueled ships can get by with that. Ones that required LOX
can probably be handled as well, though an LH2/LOX ship is gonna
require a *lot* of fuel. 

Ships that require things like kerosene or liquid methane mean that you
need access to petroleum and natural gas pipelines.

Sorry, but the Houston facilities are *not* like that at all. That\'s
where mission control is. There are *no* associated facilities for ship
handling or repair. That\'s done at Kennedy. 

The facilities in Texas, Mississippi, etc are merely parts suppliers
and refurbishers.

Try Puget Sound. There\'s this company called Boeing.... 

Also, I\'ve discovered that there are *three* companies within 100 or
so miles of Portland that are in the reusuable ground to orbit field.

It\'s especially good for the "little details". Things like the *noisy*
freezer starting up and the people *instantly* realizing that it\'s
sending "come and get it" to the critters. Much mayhem ensues as they
all rush to get to it and pull the plug...

And the fact that the things *learn*.

Oh yeah, keep in mind the complaint of the town\'s resident survivalist.

I have unfournatly no knowledge of French or Spanish, but I couldn\'t resist

The [oe] is a o with a slash through it. KKL would be the proper acronym.

A literal translation to Spanish is "Autoridad Confederal para el 
Control de Exportaciones Agricolas," but it sounds a bit strange 
(specially the "confederal" word, which is rarely used, "federal" 
being preferred, but referring to Federations). I would rather 
use "Direccion General de Exportaciones Agricolas."

As long as they are still inter-fertile, races *is* the correct term.
Sub-species is possible, but carries too many conotations that could
make it even worse than "race".

It would take either Ancient meddling or a *very* hostile environment
that provided *heavy* selection pressure. Remember, it\'s been around 3
million years since the split with the chimps & gorillas. And yet it\'s
suspected that we may still be close enough genetically to have "mule"
type crosses (ie progeny possible, but sterile). 

Nobody has yet *tried* a cross, even in vitro, because the ethical and
moral implications are *really* messy.

In a PBEM I\'m currently in, the mailing-list software supplies 5
"super-percentile" rolls in a header-line on every message when it
forwards it to the list. The rolls are in the range 00.00 to 99.99. It
works ok for us. We sometimes post with "branches" based on "if I made
the first roll, I do, this. If I fail, I do *that*..."

Since we are doing a "pulp hero" type game at the moment, we have yet
to need *all* the rolls. The server can provide as many as 10 rolls if
I recall correctly.

It also helps to remember that the gravity *drops* as your altitude
increases. At half a diameter, it\'s 1/4th what it was at the surface. 

At 100 miles up on an 8000 mile diameter (size 8) world, it\'s it\'s 95%
of surface gravity.  (4000/4100)^2=.9518...

You just reminded me of a story from Analog a few years back. It\'s a
great idea. 

The sotory is set on a *very* windy planet. And in an area where *huge*
sand dunes migrate from one end of a large "valley" to the other.
Basicly you get a day or so of calm as the seasons change, then the
wind starts blowing in the other direction. And the dunes start back to
the other end of the "valley". 

It\'s miles wide most of the time but there\'s one choke point where it\'s
less than a mile wide (passes between *tall* cliffs of *hard* rock).
And, of course, it\'s hundreds of miles long. And the dunes migrate at
rates from miles per day to mutiple miles per *hour*, as the wind speed
varies.

Anyway, theree are some sort of valuable mineral agglomerations that
form inside the dunes and can be harvested from the trailing edges
sometimes. The sort of thing that isn\'t big enough for a majore
industry, but will keep a few people living comfortably in spite of
weird expenses.

The "prospector" has a sort of vehicle that "rides" along with the
dunes. 

Anyway. Some offworld idiots decide that there\'s some reason for
building in one end of the "valley", and they try building a barrier in
the choke point. The prospector tries to warn them, but they think he
is *threatening* them. 

Anyway, in the end, the prospector manages to rescue most of the
offworld idiots as the dunes turn their barrier and equipment into just
more grit. 

As he points out, a dune weighs a *lot* and acts like a fluid. A very
*dense* fluid. With abrasive properties. So in effect they were trying
to dam a river of *rock*. It just kept piling up until something gave.
And then the high speed flow thru the gap ripped chunks free from the
sides and so on. 

When they got a chance to look at the gap after the dunes were past,
there were traces of the concrete and rebar. Worn smooth as the rest of
the rock, and flush with the harder rock....

The prospector was chuckling over all the extra metal he\'d be picking
up as the dunes "dropperd" the remains. :-)

I\'m sure folks can see lots of possibilitities in the situation.

Let me, as the passive list admin thrown in my 2 cr. on the subject.

People form opinions on people based on first impressions.  Clif 
unfortunately got off on a bad note with the list.  I get a lot of 
complaints about him, but when I go read the threads that he is involved 
in, I see a lot of "borderline" behavior.  Its more on the line of "he 
should be ignored" rather than "he should be punished" type of stuff.  I\'ve 
seen far worse flame bait posted by others.

I feel that Clif\'s biggest fault is he tends to fly off topic easily and he 
gets emotional in his posts.  His language rarely goes beyond the "PG" 
level.  I think that even a lot of his statements are even ones that are 
sometimes meant in jest.

Where did he go wrong?  He got off on a sour note.  I think the list needs 
to go back and re-evaluate his "on-topic" posts and see if they have merit 
and ask if he is contributing to the list, maybe not in a way that makes 
people happy, but is he contributing?

He has a right to say things that we may not like, as long as he does not 
hinder the welfare of the list (which includes off topic posts and flame 
bait).  As I said earlier, he is on the borderline.

Yet, many of you have vocalized that he needs to go.  He is the only one to 
ever draw this kind of comments.  Part of community is everyone getting 
along and if he is being counter-productive then we have an issue.  We have 
to balance "Freedom of Speech/Expression" with "Civil Order".

I would be interested in hearing how you feel on the matter off 
line.  Please mail me off line with a subject of "Clif Opinions".  I want 
to even hear from Clif on the matter.

I however want everyone of you to sit back and evaluate the whole situation 
and see if its just a got off to a wrong start situation and if we need to 
be a bit more tolerant.

Thanks
Rob

> Of course, this means crusades can be legal.

A thought about the crusades:

Whilst it is common to think of the crusades as something that happened
against Islam in Palestine, that only appears to be a small part of the
scenario.

The first crusade "liberated" Jerusalem just after the Christian Arabs
appear to have gained control.

The fourth crusade sacked Constantinople, centre of the Greek Orthodox
church to "protect it" from the Turks.

Many of the French crusaders are occupied in unifying France by wiping
out the Albigensian heresay from the South of France.

I don\'t feel that these points should be seen as church bashing, they
are just examples of what can happen when idealism meets the real world:

The fourth crusade was seen by the Venetians (who provided the transport)
as a free supply of troops to attack their main trade rivals. Once outside
Constantinople, the crusaders could either beseige it or be left there
by the Venetians.

The popularity of Albigensian Crusades (at least with the crusaders)
comes from the following observation: if you had estates in the North
of France, what would you rather do - garrison some faraway desert or
add some more estates on the South Coast?

ObTrav:

So the Holy Imperial Emperor has sanctioned crusades against the
unbelievers, promising life eternal and all sins forgiven?

Where do you go?

Well a quick look at the map indicates clearly that the Spinward Marches
are under the greatest threat. Even if the region is clearly dominated
by those four TL15 high population Imperial worlds. Even if border
Vargr and Aslan communities are pro-Imperial. Even if the Sword Worlders
are no real threat and the Zhodani consider the region a quiet backwater.

So I\'d go there, with the whole Corridor fleet if possible, and not
stop until every world had an HIE naval task force "protecting" it,
those high tech, high pop worlds weren\'t and everyone was on a war
budget with large border fleets.

Next, when the merchants in Core fund the Core fleets, they don\'t want
to send them against the Zhodani, since the Corridor fleet can easily
protect them (if only it stays in Corridor), they want to keep it local
and enhance their immediate trade goals, say in the Vland sector lose
the Vilani Megacorps with their policies base on the First Imperium and
the "One True Way" of the 3I will be seen to everyone.

Then, when looking for somewhere to extend your fiefdom, why not take
your fleet down into the Solomani Confederacy and free its peoples
from heresy. If every Imperial noble does their part and grabs a few
worlds it will soon see the light.

Finally, there has to be someone who will understand the true meaning
of the HIE\'s words and take a fleet into the Two Thousand Worlds to
break their ban on beef imports.

..

The result of all this?
Well it could be a strong, centrally controlled and unified Imperium.
It could be a race to see which of its enemies reaches Core first.

Even the first option might only lead to a religious civil war in
the next millenia over monetarism versus Keynesianism (sp?).

(All this comes from loosely using Medieval France as a model instead
 of 18th century UK)

It depends. If you have the energy spare, lots of factor 1 weapons
and your opponent\'s ships have armour, then your point defense
gunners might as well do something.
In practice, most optimised point defence weapons are designed to
shoot missiles at short range, so they are powered by trickle charge
batteries (to reduce demands on power plants) with short range focussing
and beam pointers (to reduce cost and size) so instead of missing with
100 shots per turn at long range, they wait and fire 8000 shots/turn for
a fraction of a turn and kill it just in time.

Mmmm... no, these guys have nomadism in their blood, never knew 
otherwise. So, there is no fixed location for a market, markets 
happen when flocks meet, where they meet. TL7 means you could have 
railways, but railways are useless without fixed lcoations to 
connect. Trucks? Using which fuel? Fossil fuel would require some 
fixed facility to extract it, and would give the owners (now not 
nomads) too much power... unless the trucks use alcohol fuel (of 
course, not tremendously efficient) and this alcohol is refined form 
some native vegetables that you can find overall. So, while the 
flocks eat, the humans collect these plants to make fuel...

Of course, maybe that sort of fuel is not enough to power *aircraft,* 
but they could be using Lighter-Than-Air aircraft to follow and 
controls the flocks.

	Even better.

World Hook 3.1: As above, striclty nomadic, with "harvested fuel."

World Hook 3.2: As above, but there is a central place where fossil 
fuel is extracted. Market takes place there, usually twice a year. A 
big event that attracts even offworld buyers... hence the starport 
has developed around here.

World Hook 3.3: As 3.1, but the world inhabitants are Aslan 
Tahiwiteakhtau who now consider the number of animals owned a measure 
of personal and clan honor, and not the size of land owned.

World Hook 3.4: As 3.1, but the world inhabitants are Vargr who have 
their personal charisma tied to their herding ability ("Stampede? In 
your flock? That\'s a -3 to Char!"

OK, shall we talk about a UWP range? Or expand to 3.1, 3.2, ..., 3.6 
and write them down in the old Adventure Hooks format? ;-)

I have to put a world like this Beyond the Extents...

I think it\'s explained pretty convincingly in the old CT material (that
JTAS article, for example) that it\'s the social expression of Imperial
immorality that makes the Zhos\' goatees bristle, just by itself.  By the
time they start reading your mind, they\'re presumably used to dealing with
visc^H^Hcious little beasts like the Impies, and not much is going to
shock them.

I don\'t have my notes here, but from memory:

There\'s the four in the Solomani Rim (Old Earth Union, Dingir League, Easter
Concord, Vega). Magyar is known to have had quite a few, but IIRC there\'s no
canonical names or other data. The Celestial League straddled Dark Nebula and
Reavers\' Deep. The Principality of Caledonia and several others in Reavers\'
Deep appeared during the Long Night. The Sindalian Empire of Trojan Reach
appeared during the Long Night and was destroyed by civil war some centuries
later.

In Bruce\'s sensor rules the default hullsurface is 99% black (ie it absorbs
all but 1% of incident EM radiation) so at least there they should be
black. At least military ships such as Navy, SDB, Scouts should probably be
matte black but those refs who like nicely coloured ships might say that
all ships have broadband chamelon surface that will become black when in
combat but otherwisely they can sport all sorts of markings.

Hello all, me again. Point, the first:

Let\'s face facts -- this is the Traveller Mailing List -- so for me the
really important question becomes "WHY DO THREADS LIKE THIS GET STARTED?"
At least have the dignity to mark such a post with an Off-Topic (OT:)
header.

Of course, the same could be said of many threads, I suppose, but it seems
to me most apparent with these gratuitously vitriolic posts. At least I
learn something from the M113 v. Bradley/Near-c rock/Pirate/Virus
zombie-threads. BTW, has anyone else noticed that Near-c rock is
essentially identical to Near-crock? As in "this argument is a Near-crock
of ****?" :-) (or for Ross, :) :P

Point, the second:

Ian, I *love* the HePlar sound system. Do you think such a thing is
possible with chemical rockets (for the cost-conscious consumer with
short-term usage needs?)

Point, the third. ObTrav (remember that?):

A few weeks ago someone mentioned the Abyss, that area of space in the
Spinward Marches that seemed to claim it\'s larger-than-fair-share of
jumping starships. Has anyone developed this area beyond what was in the
original Challenge article? I am interested in both "rational" and
"non-rational" explanations (i.e., statistical anomalies, jumpspace
distortin, or a plot to gather food for the Great Old Ones) of the
phenomena.

My own explanation was a supernatural one, but then I was running my Star
Wars-esque MegaTraveller space opera at the time. I\'d like to hear other
peoples ideas, stories, or what-have-you, because I\'d like to run a story
there the next time I referee a game and would love to hear better, more
creative ideas than my own. Or at least shamelessly steal ideas so I can
make a better, more creative story of my own. ;-)

	I am planning on trying the die-rolling server for my TNEC PBEM as
soon as the situation presents itself....  Right now we are still very
"opening stages" that are all pure role-playing.  I like the die-rolling
server option best, as it is the ultimate neutral third party.

I suspect part of this could actually be how they defined "black", which
used to mean having _any_ black ancestor.  I think "octaroons" had one
black great-grandparent to seven white great-grandparents, for example,
but were still considered "black".  Given some recessive traits, and...

None of this really affects me personally.  I\'ve had poor service when on
dates with someone with different pigmentation, but then I\'ve had porr
service by myself as well.  Fortunately most of my kids don\'t seem to
consider skin pigmentation that important either. (Religious differences
are, though.) 

I have noticed that American TV doesn\'t seem to show "mixed race" couples
at all, but then as I watch very little American TV this could well be
sampling error.

In my Traveller universe, mixed-species couples are present. Not for sex
(wrong pheremones) but for everything else.  (I confess to snagging the
idea from David Brin.)

Here\'s my take on that. It is not 100% canonical, but I don\'t think it
contradicts any canon.

Due to a phenomenon known as \'national re-emergence\' a lot of population
groups on planets in the rimward part of the defunct Rule of Man dug up
(or, in many cases, reinvented) their national roots during the Long Night
and used that as a focus to promote unity. During the Pacification
Campaigns these groups were among those most opposed to Imperial rule. One
of the many ways the various Imperial commanders had to deal with such
groups (the gamut ran from ignoring them to exterminating them) was to
provide transportation to areas outside the Imperium. Thus most of the
early settlers in the Spinward Marches were anti-imperial people with
agressively Solomani background.

Also, remember that many Vilani adopted Terran culture (presumably including
naming conventions) during the Rule of Man. 

As for the Plague of Duskir, my opinion is that on a few planets close
enough to Terra to get millions of Terran emigrants, the result was the
aforementioned reversal of Vilani to Solomani population ratios, but on
most planets further away it didn\'t happen. The few instances got most
of the publicity, however, and are the ones that are remembered 3000
years later. Typical urban legend stuff.

	I have two in my Traveller campaign... which are the only ones who
got out of the several hundred in my Cyberpunk campaign...  However, with
the advent of plasma-temp weapons (hafla and worse), Vampires in any sf
game I run keep very quiet and try not to be too obnoxious about there
depredations.
	Star-faring just adds more complications for a Vampire...  *way*
too easy to be directly exposed to full brilliance starlight...  Which
also means that the average Vampire drops into topor as soon as the ship
he\'she is on clears the atmosphere...  So they don\'t get around much with
out willing help...  Enough compound interest spread around hirlings goes
a long way...  =)

Incorrect. That is, we are told that in several places, but those places
are incorrect. The original information about the Ancients was that they
arose around -310,000 and lasted till around -290,000. The transplantations
from Earth took place around -300,000 (but the Ancients visited Earth \'a
number of times\', so it could have been spread out a couple of thousand
years).

You\'re working from an unconcious assumption that the Traveller universe
is identical to the Real universe. This is not true. In the Traveller
universe Homo sapiens HAD evolved by -300,000. Proof: Vilani was removed
from Earth in -300,000 and are interfertile with Homo sapiens. QED. (And
don\'t ask me to explain why G:T insists that the Zhodani are a separate
species).

I think that is a given. All the different races are said to have adapted
in various ways. Darrians, Zhodani, Vilani, Geonee, Suerrat...

>Isn\'t it even likely that some of these sub-species will not be

Quite likely.

Just as I use my "delete" button on 95% of everyone else\'s posts, without
reading them.  I find this tactic to be very effective, and it doesn\'t require
that I work up a good mad at anyone.

Take this as a gentle chiding, if you will. . .but since I\'ve been on the TML
I\'ve found the signal-to-noise ratio to be unusually low even as such things
go.  If I were not writing material for G:T, and therefore obliged to keep at
least some contact with the Traveller fan community, I would have
unsubscribed quite some time ago.

Sorry if this comes across as a bit snooty.  I\'m getting old enough that
I no longer have the patience necessary to be diplomatic at all times.

So far as I know, the date of -390,600 appears only in MT Imp. Encyc. and
is contradicted by everything else published about the Vilani and the
Ancients.  I\'d strongly argue dropping it.  Not that it makes a huge
amount of difference for the issue of non-Terran hominid sources, anyway.

I think we need to do that, or considerably rewrite the existing history

I hope, fellow listero, that you\'re not implying -- even
ever-so-obliquely -- that I\'m a bipolar fanged goth.  That would force me

Some anthropologists might well put late erectus/archaic H.
sapiens/H. sapiens all together. Regardless, I bet we could breed
with erectus/ergaster, no problem--except that pesky separation of
time thing :-) (I won\'t bother getting into cross species/subspecies
attractiveness/unatractiveness :-)

Maybe. But remember that even at 300,000 years ago we are *far*
closer to an old critter in genus Homo than a chimp (break with them
was ~6mya) and we share ~98% of genes with a chimp. I bet the humans
are all interbreedable.

Species defined as "can breed and produce fertile offsping" is
great, but is not used at all in paleontology since we could not
know the answer. As a result, paleo species definitions are based
around (mostly bone) morphology, and even geography (ont to mention
time). Mkaes taking about it tricky in these terms.

And now for the questions themselves: 

Why does the X-laser table in FFS2 contain only  the values for 
heavy grav focused versions? I\'d like to make a non-grav-focused
x-laser at TL 15, but there\'s no data on the performance...

Sandcasters: how do they work? Aren\'t they small masdrivers firing
cans of \'sand\'? And if so, isn\'t it possible to use them as weapons?
Also, why doesn\'t sand stop particle beams? Afer all, it is matter, so
it  will absorb the particle beam energy. Less efficiently then in
case of lasers, but still... Oh, and the kinetic energy released by
thousands of grains of sand hitting a missile is nothing to frown at,
so a sandcaster could be used for last-ditch anti-missile defense
(probably only against KKMs, and chemlaser warheads - if it doesn\'t 
hit the missile, at least it\'ll stop the beam). 

Can\'t you do an airframe Wedge? And what about the size modifiers? 
And what about a sphere? Streamlined sphere? Airframe sphere?
(OK, the last one is pretty bogus, but my Impregnable Beachball from 
Hell SDBs are spheres, or, more precisely, elipsoids, and I want them 
to be streamlined in order to skim gas giants for reaction mass and 
deuterium for the fusion reactors)

What is the \'toughness\' of armor materials in FFS2 based on? 
What would be the toughness of crystaltungsten? Of diamond? 
(Not to mention pre-stressed diamond plates armed with fullerene 
nanotubes, used in composite with crystaltungsten... <evil grin>)

Can one get protium fusion reactors WITHOUT nuclear damper technology?
How about using artificial gravity? And what is the assumed 
effectiveness of energy conversion of fusion plants? IM(highly 
heretical)TU, the high-end fusion reactors use micro-black globes 
(created INSIDE the BG generator) to capture most of the energy 
available. 

How can one shield the ship from the radiation and magnetic fields of 
a GG? Will superconductor loops under the hull do? 

Well, that will be enough for now. As you probably see, MTU is rather 
far from the One True Traveller Universe TM (;)))), but the Trav 
influence is still pretty heavy, and I want it to be rather hard sf 
(that is, no grav focussing, and no superdense. I don\'t like 
superdense. ;>). 

OK. So there\'s psionics. Make it semi-hard. 

And magic. OK. So it\'s kinda hardish space opera. ;) I still want to 
get the physics part right. ;) Mostly right, anyway. ;>

It is not, IMO, possible for a Traveller world to afford a trade fleet big
enough to allow it to export enough food to affect the domestic supply. So
unless the Vilani comes with their own ships to buy the stuff, this won\'t
be a problem.

I think that this may be a matter of personal preference to some degree --
to my mind "race" has far more inappropriate connotations than
"subspecies" for Traveller.

Verily.  It is no coincidence that Yuggoth and Yaskodray start with the

Well, even better. That means that erectus/ergaster aren\'t different species
by the "can breed and produce fertile offspring" definition.

In the Traveller universe there may be ways to get around that (Ancient
stasis fields).

I may be wrong, but it seems to me that if two branches separated for
300,000 are still interfertile, then each branch would also have to
be interfertile with the root species (assume for purposes of argument
that Grandpop did put a few \'Homo antiquitus\'[1] in stasis).

Sorry, but the chimp/human/gorilla split was 3-4 *million* years ago.
Yet even at that distance there is serious speculation about possible
limited crossbreeding being possible.

The Ancients were only 300-400 thousand years ago. That\'s 1/10th the
time. A lot more recent. And the odds are *much* stronger that we\'d
still be interfertile.

Mogadishu isn\'t very likely, as not only is it near sea level, but the
area is very *non*-industrial. 

Quito has an advantage of altitude, but doesn\'t have much of a
transport net to get things there.

Singapore is kinda small and low. NewGuinea is closer to the Equator,
and the land is cheap. The Aussies have had an eye on it since the 50s.
They might go in with some of the other nations in the area to develop
a port there.

Nairobi isn\'t likely to be the port. Instead, they are more likely to
have an electromagnetic launcher track running up the side of Mt.
Kilamanjaro. 

And what\'s wrong with Hawaii?

There should be a listing for Vandenberg. Also Mojave isn\'t as good a
site as the area north of White Sands. It\'s bigger, fewer ecological
concerns, and has major rail and pipeline routes nearby. The pipelines
provide oil and gas as fuel stocks. And less conflict with air traffic.

As I understand it, EMP basically creates a voltage spike, which in turn
creates a surge of current in conductive materials.  The intensity of this
current is dependent on the length and resistance of the conductor -- so you
get a much larger surge in a power grid than you do in, say, a paperclip.  As
such, electronics which aren\'t connected to the power grid, the phone system,
the cable television system, etc, probably won\'t get anywhere near as nasty a
zap, though there will be some effect from the power cord, simple internal
wires, metal in the case, etc...  Supposedly, if you were hanging on to some
long piece of lightly grounded wire (say, a barbed wire fence) the jolt could
be large enough to hurt a person.

Thus, a system which is off _can_ be damaged by EMP, though it\'s somewhat less
likely to be.  It can\'t really be disrupted, since disruption implies that the
system is in use (being \'off\' is a severe disruption in the normal use of a
system too...).

Well, in this area, I\'m a heretic.  Actually, worse than that.
And if you go with the heretical accounts, this entity was no artisan.
But we don\'t need any real life religion here.

I was also leaning towards a date later due to the Vilani\'s halt to
exploration at AD 518, -4000 Imperial

LOL.  I think I\'m going to use the wiggle room in the timeline to
flesh out two Homo Something species I\'ve wanted to do.
(Please let me know if there are similar minor races out there
that I\'m not aware of).  In a nutshell, one is a sentient gibbon-type
primate, though larger and with prehensile tail, and the other is
a Neanderthal-Missing link type with a penchant for violence
and great fear of large predator cats (a sort of genetic memory from
being hunted on the plains of Africa.).

I read that, then almost begged Carlos not to adopt it.
I\'m in his BTE PBEM and more than content to let him roll or pretend to roll.

It seems reasonable if you really want to have player influence.
I\'ll look at it again.

First of all, thanks for the great info.  Secondly, I should have
distinguished between PD weapons and "Standard" Las turrets.  Is it perhaps
a good idea to build a number of small Laser armed ships to serve as Missile
defense in combat? ( Allowing for Fleet defense, as opposed to self defense
in the case of PD weapons.)  And are PD weapons that much better at swatting
down missiles than say a long range Laser mount with ROF 400?  (Why use a
Hardpoint for a strictly short range weapon when you could have a weapon
that has long range and is at least moderately effective close in?)  Keep in
mind I don\'t have any of the BL material to reference :)

Right.  I was just wondering why it\'s imposed.  When you figure the
individual stats for the weapon, range degradation has already been
calculated.  So if we have a 4-4-4-3 Laser Turret, why do we get something
like 12-4-4-3 when they are grouped in a battery.  (I think those #\'s are
close.  I used Andrew Akin\'s SS to create a 42m^3 Laser Turret.  I can get
the specifics if necessary)

Is it just more range attenuation?

Actually, these studies are limited to mitochondrial DNA, which
exclusivly traces the _maternal_ lineage. There are something like 50 or
80 different human mitochondrial genotypes (IIRC) that they have
isolated in the world, all but a few of them exist only in Africa. All
that this indicates is that Africa is the likely place where humans
arose, and that thay migrated to everywhere else. Mitochondria mutate at
a different rate than the rest of our genome, and as they\'re not subject
to recombination are used as \'clocks\' to date divergences in evolution.

Well, the pictures look good. Let\'s hope no-one has to find out the hard

A Turbine? Not much more power (in fact, the British Army was offered a
diesel with the same power output as the turbine in the M1. More
maintenance, more fragile, more noise.

In this case, the round will never be used. The gunner will fire what is
already in the breach at the helo, and either he hits or the command
guided missile is going to kill you before you get a second shot.

With MMW guided missiles, the helo fires and forgets - possibly from
behind a ridge. 8km away (what\'s the max effective range of a tank
cannon? about 5km.)

Well, I can\'t speak about other factors much, but melanin-production,
and thus skin color, is fairly sensitive to environment over time.
Although, differences in melanin levels certainly don\'t mean different
races.

As humans moved north, from Africa, the amount of sunlight available
to assist in the production of certain vitamins is greatly reduced due to

persistent weather conditions and temperature (colder weather
requiring clothing and thus limiting exposure).

I\'m beginning to think I\'m missing something here.  Hopefully
someone with knowledge will jump in here soon.  Or I\'m going to
have to visit the library.

for SWA).

One of the passengers with a flat top haircut

one of the company\'s longer flights and
occasionally harassed the attendants. He
was about 19-20 and the attendants pretty
much ignored him. After the flight landed,
the passenger got up and ended up tripping and
falling to the floor.

He just lay there stretched out, refusing
to get up and muttering. One of the other
passengers asked the attendant if he could help
in any way and, upon receiving an explanation, 
made his way forward to the guy on the floor.

Looking down at the prone guy, the passenger,
put his fists on his hips and shouted:

"ON YOUR FEET, SOLDIER!".

The attendant said the other guy almost hit
his head on an overhead luggage bin snapping
to. The second passenger, who apparently was,
or used to be, a DI then marched the drunk
off the plane into the hands of airport
security.

Now I don\'t *think* she was snowing me since
she said she didn\'t understand why the drunk
"looked scared when the other passenger yelled"

know what a DI was, either.

Right - the technology assumption I made is that most ships have chameleon
coatings. Ships that want to be really stealthy buy "military black" and
"military ultrablack" coatings, which I tend to picutre as being permanently
black (but could be persuaded are just very good chamelon coatings.)

However...being non-black just adds +0.5 to your visible-light signature.
Most ships have IR signatures that are much higher than their visible-light...
so in practice permanently painting your ship bright blue won\'t make a
difference, because you\'ll be seen in IR first. It\'s only ships with good
IR masking that are operating with their power plants partially shut down
that have to start to worry about visible light.

EMP\'s will generate damaging currents in any length of conductor,
whether it\'s turned off or on. The _effect_ is similar to a \'static zap\'
but is due to inductive current generation in the conductors of the
affected systems.

Basically you get a honking huge magnetic pulse. And a moving magnetic
pulse + conductor = current flow in the conductor. How much current is
dependent on the length of the conductor and the strength of the
magnetic pulse. Unfortunately, it doesn\'t take much current to fry
microelectronic circuits.

Currently, yes.  Hundreds and hundreds of distinct cultures/tribes that
restrict their gene pools.  There has always been some diverstiy due
to random mutation.  However, "Eve" comes in.  The name given
to the female African who is theorized to be the \'mother\' of all humans,
i.e., only her children and their offspring survived to evolve.  The children
of here siblings did not.

The hypothesize reason for one group of cousins to survive and the other
to fail, at least over time, is a capacity for speech.

That happens all the time.  Its surprising common, at least in the US.
Its just the effects of the mixing of \'black\' and \'white\' people.  I know lots
of people that are the product of \'mixed\' marriages (excuse that term, please.
I hate it myself but don\'t have a god substitute).  Their siblings sometims
show the full range of color.

There is no reason for humans to become paler with the passage of time.
Differences in environment and expanding the gene pool will change
skin color overs generations.

Because the performance increase in lasers at TL-15 is _due_ to Grav
focusing, so the efficiency of non-grav focused ones would be the same
as earlier tech levels.

Yes. Yes they are the Shotguns from Hell agaiunst personnell on the
ground but are _very_ short range weapons. Dunno why they dont affect
particle beams. And yes they could be usable as missile defence,
_except_ under FFS and IIRC FFS2 missiles are standoff det-laser
weapons.

Good question, but no one\'s ever figured tyhis out. Someone, a long time

up.

There was a British television series about this  topic called "Gor", IIRC.
Very good show, if you can accept a few implausibilities.
A doctor successfully fertilizes a gorilla egg with his own sperm and then
inseminated the gorilla.  She gives birth to a human baby, albeit exceedingly
hairy.  Doctor adopts the baby.  Baby grows into big strapping and strong
man and joins the Army.  He\'s got gorilla strength.  Then it becomes a soap
opera.  I won\'t ruin it for you.

This reminds me of a peeve of mine:  What the heck are the Sayat?
And the Suerrat too?  Occasionally these guys show up in some post
on the list.  Is there any info about these \'alleged\' races on the web.
I saw \'alleged\' because I\'m not altogether sure that they exist
at all.  For all I know, they\'re code words for the Templars.

Well, whats the intended use of the info?

For me, its seems like good stuff to have on a map, at least.
But then, I think there are too many in your list.  Have you seen
Chris Thrash\'s latest post.  I think thats better since it is rooted in
the real world (I don\'t think he mentioned that he\'s an Army pilot)
and there are a workable number of them.  Too many ports and
they become meaningless.  Whats needed is a "just right" number
that provides global coverage, makes sense, and each has
enough potential for uniqueness that a referee might be tempted to
flesh them out individually.

Well, given the same mirror size, the resolution of the IR sensor is
significantly worse than the resolution of the visual light sensor (though
given the temperature required for the radiators on a starship, not a whole lot
lower resolution, maybe half a range factor; room temperature IR would be more
like 1 or 1.5 range factors).  Of course, unless the attacker is using advanced
lasers and fairly unimpressive sensors, this doesn\'t matter a whole lot.

	As long as they are used per the HG/TCS rules, what is there to
abuse?  The only thing I would specify is that they are unarmored (ie:  if
the damage roll on a ship carrying DT\'s says fuel-1, then armor DM is not
applied untill all the fuel capacity in the DT\'s is destroyed).
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
I take it a bit further. Any hit on a ship carrying drop tanks has to be
evaluated as if the ship had it\'s normal armor, *and* as if it had no armor.
The "with armor" hit is taken normally...if the "no armor" hit causes any
fuel loss, the drop tanks are immediately shattered.

Thats correct.  Their were many such terms for different fractional
amounts of \'black\' or African ancestors.  There are some for European
descendents as well.  Its been a long time since I was studyed these
issues.  I do recall where I learned of all the different terms.  It was one
of those old and huge dictionaries at a library under the term
"Miscegenation."

Um, ever hear of the Jeffersons?  They broke the ground. Don\'t know

FWIW:
Looking at MT Imperial Encyclopedia:
Imperial -400,000 = 300,000 Vilani : Humans transplanted
Imperial -300,000 = Final War destroys Ancients

I think this varies with the ruleset in use. I\'m only 
actually familiar with CT and (to a lesser extent) MT rules.

First of all, a Free Trader generates only 1G, so on a 
normal-density size 9 or 10 world, the balloon route and 
the rocket route are both impossible. We could give the 
Free Trader the benefit of the doubt and allow the balloon
route on size 8 or smaller worlds. 

Megatraveller\'s Starship Operator\'s Guide points out that 
the full G rating is only available in one direction, so 
the Free Trader can\'t take off like a rocket at 1G on a 
world greater than about size 2; MT/SOG thrusters can thrust
perpendicularly at about 25% of potential. 

MT/SOG gets around this problem by allowing brief periods of 
overdrive, so the Free Trader *can* take off like a rocket 
after all. I think the overdrive period was short enough that
after getting moving, it would have to nose-up and go back to
1G, with the possibility of streamline lift to help out.

To keep a 1G ship from being stuck on a 1.1G world, you 
have to either use atmospheric effects, or have an "overdrive"
of some sort, or have a tugboat or booster rocket to help. 

On a world with no atmosphere, you could overdrive your way 
into a *very* low orbit, then boost your orbit higher with 
normal drive levels. 

IMTU, I have an antigravity drive whose gee potential 
depends on the local gee field. A 1x gravitic drive thus 
instantly brings the whole ship to neutral buoyancy; I 
have to assume that a 1x drive is really a 1.01x drive 
for this to work, but then I have the balloon route. 
Reaction and reactionless motors are also available for 
people who can\'t afford to have a near-zero thrust when 
they\'re far from a planet (i.e. warships). This gives 
something of the flavor of "sail powered" versus motorized 
ships.

This is MT right? 1119?  I wasn\'t sure since the first page refers to Virus

Yes. Yes they are the Shotguns from Hell agaiunst personnell on the
ground but are _very_ short range weapons. Dunno why they dont affect
particle beams. And yes they could be usable as missile defence,
_except_ under FFS and IIRC FFS2 missiles are standoff det-laser

	IIRC sandcasters may be used as defense against missiles in

Personally, I\'m the same way as both player and GM. The players should
stay in character, tell the GM what they want to do and let him decide
whether it worked or not. How the GM decides isn\'t an issue as long as
the players trust the GM to be "fair"..whatever *that* means. ;->  If
I didn\'t trust my GM I wouldn\'t play in his game, and if my players
don\'t trust me then they shouldn\'t play with me.

Hee! Hee! It happens FTF too. How many of us haven\'t rolled handfuls
of dice and ignored the results while spinning some fantastic yarn?
;->

> > It seems reasonable if you really want to have player influence.

Player influence comes from *roleplaying* in my games. Even the
"rollers" have to rely mostly on roleplaying.

OTOH, I\'ve played with a few people that really like "having their
fate in their own hands" and for them I let them roll the dice on life
and death tasks, and sometimes on fateful tasks that they didn\'t think
would be life and death. ;-> When I hand the dice to Julian he tenses
up like a tiger getting ready to spring, because he knows that when he
rolls whatever is about to happen will be momentous. OTOH, I never
give the dice to Ben or Sally, he just wants to know "what happened"
so he can decide on his next move, and she wants to roleplay
everything out without the distractions of rolling dice.

Different paths leading to the same goal!

The Suerrat are mentioned glancingly in CT and MT publications, but were
never really described at all (IIRC).  Someone on the list -- I forget who
- -- wrote up and posted a fair bit of their biology/history/civ. a year or
two ago.  Essentially they\'re an arboreally-adapted, scent-oriented,
hirsute bunch in Ilelish or thereabouts who had a small interstellar
polity before contact by the Z.S., using generation ships.

The Sayat have no basis whatsoever in "canon" and are wholly my own
brainchildren.  They have nothing to do with the Templars at all.  Honest.
They\'re the counter-Templars, though, I suppose you could say.  Or maybe
parallels to the Templars, in regards to their obsession with the esoteric
aspects of the Illuminated Traveller Universe.  They used to have a
website, which has been removed.

That\'s why I put the smiley in, Leonard. ;->  The speculation about

Maybe, maybe not, I don\'t know, and that\'s why I presented my comments

Do we have any applicable data from lower species successfully
interbreeding after being separated for comparable periods of time?

And you get funny looks if you are a Yank on the London Underground and
start talking about \'tossing the trash\'...  It happened to my mate and his

Mind you, if *you*know that certain phrases mean different things, you can

Ya, the information is MT.  It\'s all background information for a TNE game I\'m starting next weekend.  This ways the PC\'s have all the info they need
and I don\'t have to do much more work.

I thought though that seeing as it\'s MT information that there might be a number of people interested in the contents of the pages.

Why not for sex?  It didn\'t seem to stop James Tiberius Kirk from fondling
the green lady.  If you have deviants who molest farm animals, you\'re GONNA
have mixed-species couples (I assume by this you mean those species that
resemble each other) using each other as interactive inflatable dolls (since
they can\'t have children?).

Liquid solder, welding compound, heat set super glue.  A veriable viscosity
glue with set time and viscosity controled my heat over time would be a
great \'duct tape\' like product to add to the ship\'s locker.

Eheeeeemmmmmm.... that\'s not fair! So Eri,s are you implicitly saying 
that if Bloo\'s character in my game is forced to use a dice server, 
*my* character in your game would be forced to do the same?

GLUPS... when I think in that roll to resist firing the shuttle\'s 
laser against the grav tank.. the one *you said* I barely passed...

OK, Bloo, maybe I won\'t use that system after all...

Once my FTF players did particularly well on a gaming session, it 
looked like one of those sporadic sessions where no PC dies. The 
game was quite interesting.. they were being prosecuted by half the 
planet, but they were on the right track to eventually discover 
why... and then they decided to assault the wrong place. Before they 
realized it, they were faced by a goon with a rocket launcher and his 
minions (couldn\'t help it, he *had* to be there, and he had been 
using that the whole session). Even if the goon failed, half the PCs 
were almost surely dead meat...

...so I rolled a lot of dice, and announced that the damned Rocket 
Launcher malfunctioned and the minions failed to react immediately...

...and all my players bursted out laughing. I couldn\'t understand 
why, and I was on the edge of asking, when I realized that I had 
forgotten to LOOK at the dice behind the screen. :-(

	Joseph "Chepe" Lockett posted a long article on the 
Suerrat two years ago. I still have it, but it goes without saying 
that Joseph should be the one to re-circulate it.

	One of the JTAS published by IG had a two-pages article by John 
Snead (IIRC) on the Suerrat, sadly not totally compatible with 
Joseph\'s work.

I suppose the EMP effect on starships could be handled similarly to a
radiation hit to on the starship combat tables, at least when the vessel is
in an atmosphere, right? Without the crew hits, that is. IIRC, it is the
interaction of gamma radiation with the atmosphere at certain altitudes
that causes the EMP effect, so this wouldn\'t be a problem in space.

Or would cms of superdense act as a shield against it? I suppose fib
computers and electronic systems would be immune to the effect as well, eh?

You\'re right of course.  I should have been clearer about the
theory.  I didn\'t mean to imply that \'Eve\' had no nieces or
nephews.  Just that if \'Eve\' is an accurate theory, then none of
her sibling\'s offsprings survive to the present day.  I\'m certainly
in no position to say whether the Eve theory is accurate or not.
But I do like it, for no rational reason.

Ian, thanks for injecting some real knowledge into this discussion.

True.  But the point is not that _every_ bacteria can live on
_anything_, but there are _some_ bacteria that live on almost
every possible energy source.

Actually, Traveller gives the strong impression that there is indeed
a prefered "handedness".  This is because it routinely treats food
as interchangable between organisms.

I can\'t see how this would not be fatal to the humans.

This is _not_ a barrier to bacteria.  There are bacteria that can
convert amino acids.

A counterpart of this is short expiration dates on critical information.
Sure, they captured Captain Greykin - the information he has in his
head will start to go stale within minutes. It\'s quite possible (with high-tech
commo gear) to know Greykin is in enemy hands the moment it occurs,
and change all codes and call signs within minutes of that. Grav tanks
and vehicles can move continental distances in hours, they can easily
be elsewhere when Greykin\'s capture starts to comprimise their positions.

Tactical intelligence should be of limited use - by the time you interrogate
Greykin and get the info to your squad leaders, Greykin\'s assault will
already be over one way or the other. Operational & Strategic information
is tougher, though...if Greykin knew your three-week plan before he got
captured, you are now on day one of a new three week plan. 

I\'m thinking that Imperial forces have a nice, thick book on how operations
are different when faced with a telepathic foe. Considering that any enemy
may have telepaths along, they may use these "differences" as SOP.

Thanks, Ian!  That means Terran-Vilani interfertility is very
plausible. Canon is preserved!

 It should allow for some interfertility with the Zhodani
as well, shouldn\'t it?

Per the CT Alien Supplement on the Zhos, psi ability is
*not* genetic. One could easily have a non-psi child
born of two psi parents and vice versa. I never could
figure that one out. My favorite PC of all time is a
Zho/Vilani crossbreed and he is most definitely psionic.

I\'d say there\'s no such thing as a "half Psi". Per
Traveller canon (all flavors), all characters can
roll for a Psi rating and, if trained, maintaining
for the rest of their life the Psi rating they have
at the time of training. Therefore, *every* character
is (technically) psionic unless their Psi rating is zero.
They\'re simply not trained to use it.

SIR,
It is the concidered opinion of this operative that the entity calling
itself "Kenji" is, in fact, a composite personality! No single sapient

I must agree with our brethren. Full military intervention is, not only

Farrakhan may spout it, which I am unsure, but he didn\'t originate it. I
think it began with Elijah Muhammad, but I\'m not positive.

It might be an interesting bit of high weirdness for a Traveller campaign
though. The discovery of "the mothership" and whatnot.

Although it\'s a touchy subject, what do race relations look like in the
Traveller universe? The assumption is usually that we\'ve "gone beyond"
racism with the discovery of all these interesting alien and quasi-alien
cultures and appearances... race hate groups are replaced with those like
"The Rule of Terra" and the like. Would we really though? Ultimately, it\'s
much like the inclusion of real world religions: best left up to the
individual TU builders out there, but it is an interesting thought.

One hand wave method was described in the CT adventure "Expedition to
Zhodane." In this adventure, a device was developed by the IISS which
implanted a false personality into a person. The subject would absolutely
believe the false personality and would "come out of it" only if he/she
saw a certain symbol specified during the implantation process. The
adventure centers around the adventurers trying to rescue the IISS
operative who was using the device to be able to study all aspects of
Zhodani culture first-hand (yeah, right).

Actually, this was explained wrong in the popular press.

Assuming that the tests are correct, we all share Eve as a common
ancester. However, she is not our only ancester. There is no scientific
reason to believe that all other humans alive at the time (except her
children) died off - they just interbred.

Honestly I rather doubt it.  Zho\'s have no higher chances on Psi than do the Vilani, its just the Zho\'s check them immediately and utilize them.  The
Vilani do not.  Likely they would have a combination of physical characteristics though.

I would assume he\'s talking about an Aslan/Human couple rather than a Vilani/Solomani couple.  Personally I\'ve never seen a problem with this, people
from different species getting together because they share common interests etc.  While breeding is impossible and who would want to kiss something with
doggie breath (thats a quick shot at all you Vargr fanatic\'s out there 8^)  ), I don\'t see why sentient members of different species couldn\'t find
something in common which attracted them to one another and kept them together for the long term.

The thing I don\'t understand in your above statement is why do you assume that a mixed species couple ie. Solomani and Alsan are some how devient?
They\'re both sentient species and they both realize the consequences of their actions, more power to them if that\'s what they want.  Particularly if
there\'s some sort of attraction there in the first place and lets face it its likely that this attraction would begin as a purely intellectual one.

I think the closest things you\'d want to look at here are animals like, zebra\'s and horses, or horse and donkeys/asses.  While the horse and the
donkey/ass are capable of interbreading and producing offspring the offspring itself, the mule, is incapable of reproducing.

I have to agree with you here, though it\'s been nearly a decade since I took any biology courses I always thought this view was somehow out dated.
Morphologically if you look at even widely different creatures you see a great many skelital similarities.  We all crawled out of the same goo 4 billion
years ago, its the time since then that things have gotten interesting.

This is something which is as you say, highly sellective and based greatly upon natural selection and other environmental factors.  Given the harsh
nature of the Vilani homeworld in the years following the Ancients War, I\'m surprised that a greater degree of speciation didn\'t occure there.  The
selective pressures were definitely at a premium but apparently they weren\'t sufficient to result in any significant changes.

The minor human race I\'ve postulated for my Confederaton of Nightrim PBEM works under the assumption that selective pressures were high enough which
combined with a certian degree of genetic engineering on behalf of the ancients has resulted in speciation.  Thus, while the Ayansh\'i are capable of
interbreeding with the rest of the Homo genus their offspring are not genetically viable and thus must be classified as Homo Ayansh\'i rather than Homo
Sapiens Ayansh\'i.  This works under the assumption that humanity is divided into subspecies catagories.  Homo Sapiens Solomani, Homo Sapiens Vilani, Homo
Sapiens Zhodani etc...

All I\'ll say is that there are more inter-racial couples on US TV now
than there were 20, 30, 40 years ago.  Of course, minorities are still
badly under represented, period.

Terminology gets weird here, because in the Traveller universe, the Aslan
& Hiver et al. _are_ "other races".  So in that sense, yeah, "racism" is
alive and well.

They make you get up at 0615 _on leave_?  My sympathies....  ;-)

BTW, when I was going through Jump School at Ft. Benning, I wanted to
try something similar.  My plan was to go to the junior Enlisted Club (I
was a recently-promoted sergeant at the time), open the door, and yell,
"Jumpers, HIT IT!!", just to watch the beer spill as trainees leapt to
their feet, assumed a good, toght body postion, and counted: 
"ONE-thousand, TWO-thousand, THREE-thousand, FOUR-thousand!" 
Unfortunately, the EM club was closed for renovations during my three
weeks at Benning.

ObTrav:  It would be interesting to speculate on the kinds of pranks
that veteran soldiers play on newbies, in any era (Ghu knows we play our
share on new troops in the US Army circa 1999)....

I was just playing with Altavista\'s \'Babelfish\'
(babelfish.altavista.com) and it came up with these:

French:  Autorite Agricole De Commande D\'Exportation De Confederation 
(accented e in \'autoritE\' and \'confEdEration\'

Spanish: Autoridad Agrcola Del Control De la Exportacin De la 
         Confederacin 
(accents in \'agrIcola\', \'exportaciOn\', and \'confereraciOn\')

I don\'t speak either of those languages, so those could be terrible, but 
the German one ("ExportSteuerBerechtigung Des Buendnisses
Landwirtschaftliche") doesn\'t seem too loathsome to my dimly-remembered
high-school German.

So psionic capacity is not genetic?  Does psionic ability not come from full
or higher usage of the total mind?

Anyway, I\'m wondering about the offspring of two characters...

Say that Dishi (a hypothetical swimsuit model) marries Dweebus (a butt-ugly
nerd), wouldn\'t it be safe to say that the overall result of the child\'s
APPearance score (IMTU) be the average of the two character\'s scores?  Some
genetic traits will be dominant in the wife and some dominant in the husband
for an overall effect of an average of the two APP scores.  Same with
eyesight, hearing, dexterity, etc.?

How realistic would this be, or should I actually sit down with my biology
book and figure it out "the old-fashioned way"?

It seems to me that the "us vs. them" effect comes into play when there is
an outsider whose power (or "outsideness") transcends surface planetary
boundaries.

I know I\'m citing a movie, again, but Independence Day 4 was a masterful bit
of propaganda giving us all (even if only for an hour or two) a great big
warm, race-spanning, fuzzy.  The conspiracy theorists in \'95 (and maybe
still) believed that UFO propaganda was being used in a subtle way to
promote the one world U.N. Order.

Face it, if Ripley\'s "bitch" started dropping eggs in Mexico, you can bet
the South Americans and North Americans would find themselves at the lowest
common denominator(i.e., "human") and band together to trap these things in
a cross-fire.  Scrambling for survival, there would be no time to tell the
black man to get to the back of the C-130.

Yeah, like this...  VARGR:  "Yeah, scratch behind the ears.  A little lower,

Deviant in that there doesn\'t seem to be a rhyme or reason to the physical
attraction.  Supposedly, we\'re attracted to women with nice hips because she
should be able to bear more children.  There is supposed to be a
"preservation of the species" priority subconsciously driving our drive.

its likely that this attraction would begin as a purely intellectual one.

Or maybe it would be as homosexuals claim, that they always had a hankering
to hold the paw of a vargr instead of a human female?  That they were born
that way?  Which leads me to wonder how that would be the case if the two
cultures hadn\'t met...  Would a "born as" Vargr-lover go through life
feeling like "something was missing" if she had never met a vargr?

It\'s cheap, it\'s centrally located between the Middle East and East Africa
(a tremendous amount of coastwise shipping already goes by there), there\'s
a major airport (courtesy of the Soviets) going to waste, the weather is
better than Mombasa, it\'s very nearly on the Equator, and it sits on the
east coast.

Elevation and proximity to the equator were the overriding considerations
for placing massdrivers.

Again, a huge shipping center, very close to the equator, and incidently
about equidistant from Mogadishu and Quito. The difference is that
Singapore has the *money* to become a major player, once spaceplanes (HTOL)
or SSTO become available.

You don\'t need cheap land with spaceplanes, you need markets and intermodal
transportation.

Actually, the massdriver *is* at Mount Kilamanjaro; the port is misnamed,
for political reasons. [Pesky details you wouldn\'t have known -- sorry.]

>And what\'s wrong with Hawaii?

It\'s in the middle of nowhere -- there aren\'t any markets to support it,
import or export, and it costs almost as much to ship there for
transloading to orbit as it does to simply boost the stuff all the way from
wherever you started.

One of the primary considerations for siting a commercial spaceport has to
be approach and departure paths. Vandenberg is a terrible site for anything
except missiles; it is restricted by safety concerns to almost polar
orbital insertions. White Sands (IMTU) is still primarily an experimental,
not commercial or operational, facility, although the HELL could
conceivably be there instead of Colorado Springs.

Mojave is far enough from LA that the natives won\'t complain (much), near
enough to serve that huge market. Pipelines, rail and power are not
problems, either -- one of the reasons I picked it. Airspace really isn\'t
an issue that far out, either, although the main VOR airway from Las Vegas
to LAX might have to be rerouted somewhat.

Many of these sites were lifted from analysis of the commercial viability
of SSTO spaceship operations done by Dr. Robert Zubrin, the late G. Harry
Stine, and others.

     4.   The latest digest in my Inbox is #235, dated 2/3/99.

In two weeks (!!) from 18/2/99 to today, 2/3/99, we have had  - get this -
72 digests, each containing around 20 messages. That\'s approximately 1440

DESIGNER\'S NOTES:

The REUBEN TUCKER class platoon transport is designed to fill the role
of a long-range (Jump-4) transport, capable of inserting a jump troop
platoon behind enemy lines, with the ability to retrieve the platoon
upon mission completion.  While the BROADSWORD-class Mercenary Cruiser
(of equal size) can move more personnel, and is more heavily armed, the
REUBEN TUCKER class transport has several advantages over the
BROADSWORD-class:  longer range (J4 versus J3); better normal-space
performance (3.5G versus 2G); the ability to insert troops by meteoric
assault; and a larger cargo hold (29.7 dtons versus 23.6 dtons, although
this advantage is largely countered by the need to hold at least one
additional set of jump capsules).  In addition, by resisting the
temptation of replacing crewmembers with machines, and reinforcing the
ship\'s structure to a standard of 4G, the REUBEN TUCKER class can
withstand more damage than a BROADSWORD-class Mercenary Cruiser.

Since a detached platoon may spend several jumps in transit before
reaching the objective, the REUBEN TUCKER-class transport provides
sufficient living space to avoid overcrowding.  Every crewmember, and
every jump trooper, has an individual small stateroom.  The skipper and
the platoon leader, as the respective commanding officers, ach have a
large stateroom.  The REUBEN TUCKER-class carries rations sufficient for
8 weeks of operations, without resorting to emergency rations.

By restricting the technology of the REUBEN TUCKER class to TL-13,
AuricTech Shipyards has combined operational flexibility with maximum
maintainability under austere conditions.

    'body' => 'Greetings fellow Travellers:

Please accept my apology for my non-Traveller rant about the Cliff/Mark
Flame Fest.

   My main hash tonight is about relevancy and this ML or any other.

   Over the last three weeks just about every mailing list and use group
I\'ve subscribed to has disintergrated over either Impeachment, Abortion,
the 2nd Amendment, Party affiliation, conscription, Vietnam, "who was
right the CSA or the USA?"..ad infinitum,  or combinations of these
divisive issues. Considering I\'m involved in such things as advanced
spaceflight propulsion, space policy, animae, defense policy, Civil War
history, sf roleplaying games (traveller, 2300ad, renleg, full thrust,
starfire), and too many other subjects to get into here, I run into a
huge variation of opinion and just about everyone on these lists is over
educated (myself included) and well-spoken articulated human beings.
However, some of these people are more strident than others. It is a sad
day when a Civil War discussion group breaks down because of a subject
that might be relevant in the abstract but not in the concrete, i.e
comparing slavery to 20th century abortion politics. The Revolutionary
War list I was on fell apart because of someone recurring \'tag line\'
that thoroughly manifested this person\'s  1st Amendment rights, but
cheesed off a majority of the list members. We didn\'t agree to disagree,
they\'re probably clawing each other\'s proverbial eyes out to this very
minute. The internet has yet to unite us into one "brotherhood of man".

And so the moral of this story:

We agree to disagree
If we\'re pissed off by someone elses diatribe, IGNORE it even if it is
personal.
The person who attacks your beliefs in a vulgar way will look like a
fool and will suffer the \'virtual\' silence they deserve.

The TML is still elastic and I was amazed how many people pulled it back
to what it\'s about: A GAME   (But a jolly damn good one, hey!)

This is my last rant and testament,

Use of vulgarity does not make a person\'s arguments irrational.  It can be
said, however, that the person lacks manners.

Which mailing-list software does this, Leonard? It sounds like something worth investigating.

Florida is the prefered site now.

Share, please!  My AKUS group may be heading into the great unknown
one of these days and having them run into some humans-not quite
humans is something I\'ve been thinking about.

None taken, Ian. As a human, I\'ll admit to having a homocentric view
of the universe.  ;-> I meant lower in the sense of non-human, and
you went on to answer my question.

So, our humanti cousins are probably interfertile with we Solomani,
but may have a wide variety of characteristics not found among us.
Interesting.

I, somehow, got the impression that the Suerrat were...well rat like, in some way?

Although it\'s a touchy subject, what do race relations look like in the
Traveller universe?

Racism is very much a part of the OTU.  The whole Major/Minor Race
classification system, especially since this includes minor human races,
not just BEMs, is institutional racism.  You can\'t use the \'oh, they like
staying on their homeworld, something about the air\' excuse with a MHR.

I gathered that the various human races are physiologically similar, as
unlikely as that is having followed totally separate lines of evolution.
Only slightly unusual characteristics from the Solomani standard, like all
zhodani are tall and swarthy, answerin have white eyes (IIRC from someones
webpage), all Geonee look like garden gnomes, only these make a MHR stand
out.

How do the powers that be in the Imperium keep a MHR minor?  They are
restricted for the most part to their homeworlds, or at best a \'cultural
region\'.  Occasionally you see them farther from home, but it would be
unusual.  You don\'t see huge numbers of worlds colonized by vegans,
virushi, or syleans.

Granted, if interfertile, syleans and other MHRs in the Imperium (and
probably the Consulate) might have been absorbed into the overall major
race population.  But for whatever reason, like Geonee culture, significant
identifiable populations still exist.

I see the Imperial, at best, following about the same policy of \'benign
neglect\' after the American Civil War.  No official overtly official policy
of discrimination, but if it happens, oh well, what do you do?

Megacorps will not hire a Geonee.  If they do, they only make low level
management (no pun intended - not!).  Virushi get into the best medical
schools, but they are almost never in the hospital administration.  Suerrat
can start their own corporation, but they can never seem to get that loan
from Hortalez et Cie for the larger ships.  Same for large scale
colonization efforts, a race, even a MHR, might get plenty of support from
the local nobility, but when it comes down to it, the funds don\'t
materialize, the clearances don\'t come through, the materials are
misrouted...  If anyone complains too loudly, brand them psionic/Ine
Givar/loudmouth and throw them in jail.

A dim view of the Imperium, but its got the plot hooks.

300,000 years is a long time.  Even if you start with a small initial
population (and correspondingly fewer diseases) on Vland, disease still has
a long long time to develop into complex forms.  Forms complex enough that
Vilani bugs, few and far between by Terran standards, should have been just
as deadly as the Earth bugs.  Terrans would have no resistance to something
that evolved on Vland.  In fact, there should be very deadly Vlandish
diseases, since they couldn\'t feed on anything else but humans.  The
bacteria/virus/whatever would be specifically evolved to take advantage of
a human metabolism.

IW period Vilani should have had as many diseases as Terrans, but instead
fell like Martians on a summer afternoon while the Terrans marched to
victory.  Why didn\'t the terrans fall too?

Granddaddy didn\'t want his pets getting sick so he tinkered with the
intestinal flora/fauna so they wouldn\'t mutate.  Sliced off their introns,
boosted the RNA efficency or inserted an extra helix .  No divergent
intestinal flora, no intestinal disease.  No pesky messes for Grandpa clean
up, no having to go all the way back to Terra to get more humans.

(best of all, minimal \'Ancients did it\' explanation)

Meanwhile back on the Earth, Terran hominids and their bugs mutated quite a
bit.  When they came into contact with the Vilani,  blamo!  Instant
flamewar, err, Plague of Duskir.

Or go with the Confederation Bioweapons.  There is a reason why the Earth\'s
military was placed under UN command in 2022 (IIRC from the M:21 thread).
Everyone had weapons that could take out all human life without trying.
When the UN ran into the Vilani they dusted off the old Saddam Specials and
the rest was going to be history.

Here\'s what me and a friend did on our recruit course.

We dressed up like the Orderly Officer and the Duty  NCO, and marched
into the female barracks at 1pm, and yelled "SNAP INSPECTION" and with
appropriate swearing and yelling got them all standing to attention.
At this point the lights were still off, so they couldn\'t see us. We
then marched to the end of the dormitory, took a single flash
photograph,  said "Thank you, ladies" and leapt out the end window
before they could get us. A copy of the photograph was then presented
to each of the "participants" upon graduation.

Another favourite trick was the shaving cream attack, the old standby
of short-sheeting, and placing
cornflakes or similar cereals into people\'s beds, shoes, underwear,
hats, etc.

25. Consumer protection laws include a possible death penalty for
the maker of a product which kills a user. (Examples: Restaurant
food poisoning, failed buildings, unsafe drugs, poisonous
chemical spills). Equipment manufacturers are required to notify
purchasers of all known hazards in using the equipment and bear a
share of the risk of their occurrence, but remain fully liable
for unknown hazards or defects in manufacture.

26. Religion is a form of nature worship, and natural events are
described as actions of intelligent, powerful, nonphysical
entities with motives only partially incomprehensible to humans.
Scientific accounts are accepted as descriptive only, and are
usually subject to reinterpretation in mythic terms (e.g. the god
of volcanoes inhabits the underworld and strives to break free).
[Has this already been suggested? I don\'t have 101 religions]

27. Marriage is formalized with a business-like contract. The
bride is provided with a dowry by her parents, but they may
require a bride-price from the groom or his parents. The wife is
considered the property owner and in case of divorce, retains
title to at least as much as her dowry. The husband, however, is
considered the property manager.

28. The world is nearly uninhabitable except for one particular
region: a mountain range, crater, river, canyon, or some such.
Although it makes human life possible in its vicinity, frequent
natural disasters are associated with it. (as a variant, a few
such isolated regions: see also #14)

29. The world is unified by a common geographic feature, has
abundant resources so that it is self-sufficient, and is distant
from its neighbors (At least jump-2 away from nearest). Its
outlook is self-centered and aloof.

30. Cyclical orderliness has a strong influence on religion,
philosophy, and other elements of culture. The people turn
fatalistic in times of success and and optimistic in times of
trouble. This belief seems natural because the various natural
cycles on the world are unusually regular.

Lucky for whom?

Range was >5.4km, round was APFSDS, target was an Iraqi tank.  As to luck,
the British armed forces have done as well (if not better ;) ) as their
Colonial counterparts, but without the benefit of such expensive toys all
through (modern, admittedly) history.

On the subject of the M60 and M1, a story I heard had an M1 stuck in a
mudhole with a bunch of angry natives on the warpath; two M88 Recovery
vehicles had completely failed to pull the M1 free so it was decided to blow
it up rather than let the locals get their mucky paws on it.
TWO M1 shots failed to penetrate the hull armor, so a third climbed up the
hill and shot into the top of the turret.  *Unfortunately* the ammo only
blew the blowout panels off.
By then two more M88s had arrived and the four pulling together freed the
tank.  The turret was replaced and shipped home for examination, the tank
was repaired and sent back into action.

+ObTrav; how do you free a stuck G-tank?  (How do you **STICK** a G-tank in
the first place??)  Possibly a higher-tech, undercover, force manages to get
a tank bogged on a world they\'re not supposed to be on; how do you get it
out without letting the locals see your nice little spaceship?

Nasty tricks for new arrivals?  Send \'em out for Long Weights, Left-handed
Screwdrivers, or green and brown camo paint; let \'em fix test kit costing
loadsamoney then stand behind \'em - with two metal trays - when they power
it up after fixing it - the list just goes on and on...

I drew both the illustration and the deckplans, and, uh.... I guess I just
rather hoped nobody would notice that they didn\'t exactly match..

The plans, as I recall (I don\'t have my proofs at hand at the moment and
LOREN STILL HASN\'T SENT ME MY CONTRIBUTOR\'S COPIES OF THE BOOK [*ahem,
sorry]) show the cargo bay opening out the side of the ship. But the
illustration shows a *rear*-loading cargo bay (basically because I thought
it *looked* cool). How this discrepancy came about I can\'t clearly recall
now; probably I did the illustration first, then worked up the plans, but
at some point discovered that I couldn\'t make the various components fit
the way I wanted them to.

However, in my defence I will point out that there is no single design for
the Corsair -- "Corsair" is just a synonym for "Pirate Ship", after all,
and they come in lots of flavours. Unless there really *are* factories in
Vargr Space pouring out ships designed and marketed specifically for the
purpose of piracy (*are* there??), my design is probably a standard Vargr
tramp freighter that has been heavily modified for a given band of pirates.
It\'s a "typical Vargr Corsair" -- YVCMV (Your Vargr Corsair May Vary :).

The cutter, as Seth suggestd, does indeed drop out the belly of the ship. I
drew the outline of the cutter bay doors in there as a dotted line -- which
*should* be visible in the published deckplans...

Okay, now you\'re getting on my nerves ;)

Yes, the cutter bay doors can\'t really conform to the dotted line I drew,
because the cargo deck extends past the first couple of yards of the cutter
bay. So the Cutter would have to tilt its nose down and then slide out of
the bay at an angle. Call it one of those weird features that results when
you modify and customize and add extra engines and so on.

Given the speed at which I threw these plans together, mostly between the
hours of midnight and 4am, I\'d be amazed if there weren\'t other little
glitches hiding in there :)

	Hey, I told you, I am an Spaniard!. Don\'t use that, it\'s terrible.

	"Autoridad Confederal para el Control de Exportaciones Agricolas"

	Is a literal translation (accent in agrIcola).

	I would prefer soemthing not so literal: "Direccion General de 
Exportaciones Agricolas de la Confederacion" sounds more plausible.

Well in UK it had a lot of us booing, once for the ridiculosly
steriotyped Brits scene, and the other for Bill Pulman\'s \'Independence
Day\' speech. It seemed like the usual US-centric jingoism, made worse by
the fact it was pretending it was humanocentric. BTW, not an attempt at a

	I think there are several more, from what I have heard they get into worse
choices as you go down.  When they were starting to fly the shuttle
McConnel AFB in Wichita, Kansas was discussed as one of the alternate
landing sites.  Supposedly they would open the gates into Raytheon and
combine the runway.

Hmm..my take on genetics was that if a parent\'s attribute is dominant,
the
child gets the entire attribute, rather than the attribute being
"diluted"
by the other parent\'s recessive attribute. In regards to character
attributes, I would rule then that the parental attributes represent a
minimum/maximum range. Of course, with proper training or through the
results of disastrous events, these min/max values may be exceeded.

Please keep in mind, though, that when it comes to the details of
RealLife(tm) genetics, I\'m totally clueless.

It all depends on the dominant/recessive traits.  For example, I have a
brother and a sister.  all of us express different body characterisitcs
gained from our parents.  My father never went grey until about six months
before his death at 69, but Craig has been going a distinguish silver for
some time now.  I have my father\'s hair (got it in the will), but many of
my mother\'s features.  It\'s a crap shoot.  Concievably, two ugly folks
could combine traits to produce Cindy Crawford.

Psionics aren\'t handed down through family lines.

Also, the vast majority of zhodani are psionicly dead.  Only the nobility

Wasn\'t that Orion slave girl a hallucination?

Anyway, sexual attraction is a combination of a great many factors, 90% of
whuich are mental.  Consider what Americans define as "sexy".. thin, large
breasted women.  The _Baywatch_ paradigm.  Go back sixty years, and you\'ll
find ads for products designed to fatten women up!

People who deviate from the norm (not intended as a slur) come in two sets.
 Those who seem born that way (most homosexual or bisexual folks) and those
who have some sort of psychotic break that imprints desires outside the norm.

Your amourous farmhand probably has no other outlet, and is simply using
whatever outlet he can find.

The problem with interspecies copulings, even among the varieties of
humanity, is that sexual response is an involuntary reaction.  (Ask any
thirteen year old.)  There has to be a stimulating set of clues to
function.  Luckily for us, the human mind is capable of defining almost
anything as being sexual.  The question is: Are the aliens the same way?

Release for Military Intervention.

Pursuant to request by numerous faceless minions, and after consulting with

We suggest you use Book 4 Light Assault Guns, as they appear to have

Trust me, a great number of us jingoistic Yanks were slack jawed in

killed some bystanders. He didn\'t have a driving license. Then he 
found out that, tehcnically, killing somebody in an accident when you 
drive without license may be considered murder under the local law. 
He is still wondering if the law come after him any day, and half the 
players are trying to obtain licenses for every little aptitude they 
have....

...some of them are not trying. The poor guys. ;->

I think you can add the old air bace (CFB Namaio) in Edmonton AB, Canada.
Built by the US army during WW2 (for transporting food and aid to USSR), it
has something like the 3rd or 4th longest runways in the world.

Are you implying that ID4 pretended to be a serious movie???!!!

I\'ve been informed in mail that a German group produced apparently
viable human/gorilla hybrids in vitro, but flushed the results before
they got beyond the "small clump of cells" stage because they were just
as uncomfortable as we are. 

To give you an idea *how* close we are, there\'s only a one amino acid
difference between gorilla and human hemoglobin. And I think I\'ve read
that they\'ve found a few people with "gorilla" hemoglobin.

There\'s a book by an SF author (I can\'t recal the title or author at
the moment) that has a anthropologist (or maybe paleontologist) visting
the family home in the South (her family wound up owning the old
plantation they\'d been slaves on).

She finds an old journal and as near as she can tell, one section in it
describes an attempt to introduce chimps or gorillas as labor. It gives
enough details about where the bodies were buried after they died that
she decides to try doing a dig. Partly to see just what did happen
(after all being able to show that the slave owners had tried to work
slaves alongside "animals" would help point out attitudes) and partly
to show her family just what it is that she does for a living.

She finally locates the coffins. And damn near has heart failure when
she recognizes the skulls as homo erectus (or maybe it was one of the
australopithicenes). Much furor ensues. 

And of course, they have to try finding out *where* in Africa these
creatures came from. 

I won\'t spoil the story by continuing. If someone recognizes the author
and title from my description, *please* post them. The book would be a
gold mine for any ref trying to have any of our "cousin" species show
up as the population of a world.

I\'m not sure. Drop by alt.callahans and ask about the CAoL\'s "Pulp
Adventure" campaign. It\'s currently sorta inactive because the GM is
busy in the standard "superhero" game (the AAE posts).

The host system is ModusVarious.com. He may be running custom software.
For one thing, the list scans the newsgroup for any postings with the
right "prefix" in the subject and includes them in the list...

Even so, it does have the advantage of being near the equator *and*

It was Stine who was pointing out the virtues of the southwestern US

It\'s possible. It\'s just not as likely as you might think. There really
*are* some sort of "signals" that lead to sexual arousal. And it is
quite possible to be *very* interested in someone and have the signals
be "wrong". I\'m not going to go into details, I\'ll just note that
regardless of how flexible you are mentally about such things, it\'s
possible have your "body" decide that it ain\'t gonna happen.

So *in general* the "cues" have to be right. An animal has similar
plumbing. An Alien may be just *too* different for our "programming" to
work with. We are remarkably flexible, but there will always be limits.
Sometimes very frustrating ones.

Do you recall the (original) Star Trek episode "Plato\'s Stepchildren"?
That was the one with the planet full of telekinetics who lorded it
over the Enterprise crew until McCoy fiogured out how to give them TK
of their own. 

Anyway, it\'s famous for being the *first* American TV show to show an
inter-racial kiss. And that kiss was the aliens *forcing* Kirk and
Uhura to kiss. That was only 30 years ago.

Actually, I suggested it originally. It\'s based on *real* research.
They\'ve got lab models that use high purity gases to make a jet of
flame (high purity plasma) and manipulate it electromagnetically to
create sound. 

The big hassles currently are the need for a high purity plasma.
Ordinary flames won\'t do. If they get that licked, we *will* see it at
concerts simply because the effect of a tower of flame "speaking" is
too good to pass up!

"Standard" take on it is something like this:

High melanin levels help protect against tropical sunlight. Therefore
there is selection pressure for high levels and against low levels.
Skin cancer and the like *really* select for high melanin levels.

In more northerly areas, the selection pressure *for* high levels goes
away. And due to descreased exposure to sunlight, there is a weaker
selection pressure towards lower melanin levels (to aid in producing
vitamin D). But it is a *weaker* pressure. That\'s why even in Arctic
areas, you\'ll get "yellow" and "red" coloration rather than "white". 

As I recall, *biologically* the "races" of Earth are rather different
than what you might think. There\'s a fairly rare type found mostly
among the bushmen in the African Kalahari. They have some *very*
disctinctive features. 

There\'s the general "Negroid" type. There\'s a "Mongoloid" type (has
nothing to do with Down\'s Syndrome). Both Asiatics *and* Native
Americans belong to this type. And there\'s a Caucasoid type. 

The defining characteristics have shifted *considerably* since we
started being able to compare blood-types and genetic markers. As I
recall, the "Bushman" type is one of the few relatively pure races. 
And about the only one where physical appearance is at all useful in
assigning "race".

Just for an example, anybody claiming to be 100% caucasian *and* having
type B or AB blood has got some suprises buried in the family tree...

I\'d say it *favors* inter-fertility of all of humaniti. It\'ll be the

EMP creates a disruption in the local magnetic field. Usually the
planetary one, but if you are close to a big blast in space the
"embedded" field in the plasma as it washes over you could have similar
effects.

What the magnetic field does is induce a current in all unshielded
conductors. And it takes a *lot* of shielding, so it\'s best to consider
all conductors unshielded. 

The current (or is it voltage?) is proportional to the length of the
conductor. Thus your car key won\'t melt, but the extension cord on an
appliance could fry the electronics even though it isn\'t plugged into
the wall. 

Things like power lines (which run for miles) and wire fencing (ditto)
will be the biggest dangers. As in it may be possible for enough of a
charge to be benerated by a long stretch of fence to knock you on your ass.

Sremiconductors are vulnerable because the PN junctions that make them
work act a lot like tiny capacitors, and it only takes a little voltage
(say 50-100 volts) to "puncture the dielectric" (ie ruin the junction
by shorting it). With a strong EMP only a few *inches* of wire would be
enough to fry ICs.

Tubes survive ok because you just get a momentary arc and then they are
back to normal.

I have to agree with you Eamon.  Even we Canadian\'s laughed and guffawed at the US centric
nature of the movie.  Gimme a break if it weren\'t for 5 minutes in a two hour film you\'d
swear the earth was flat and ended at the 49th parallel, the Rio Grande and at the
Atlantic and Pacific coast line.

My favorite scenes in the movie was the shot in the desert and the other "locations around
the world" shots.  It gave a brief sence of the global totality of this disaster.

It was unfortunate that the producers didn\'t see that as a boon to the movie,
unfortunately in Hollywood showing things outside the US is rarely viewed as a good thing
it\'s a matter of simple economics and market.

Honestly you have to ask yourself are the people in the US who make up 80% of Hollywoods
viewing audience going to want to watch a road film about a bunch of hicks from
Saskatchewan trying to find Vancouver or would the same film draw a larger audience if
they were hicks from Iowa trying to find Los Angeles?  Well the second one it going to
draw a bigger audience in the States because more people can relate to it.  Its really a
matter of economics, what\'s going to sell in your largest market?  Unfortunately Hollywood
is terribly terribly predictable in the trash they produce, perhaps they should honestly
sit down and watch movies from around the world.

What can we expect to see next from the corporate schmoe\'s in Hollywood?  A film about a
group of ex-Pittsburg steel mill workers who decide to strip so they can pay their bills.
They\'ll call it, "The Buck Naked"...

This one will be familiar to paratroopers, and can easily be adapted to
Traveller (substitute "space-sick" for "airsick"):

At Ft. Bragg, most of my unit\'s training jumps involved about forty
minutes of flying in terrain-following mode, before climbing to jump
altitude (800\' AGL).  A C-130 flying that low gives some good
negative-Gs as it crests hills.  This, in turn, can cause airsickness in
those susceptible to such (luckily, I am not susceptible).  For this
reason, the Air Force always had plenty of airsick bags available.  So:

Take one airsick bag.
Fill it with the chicken a\'la king MRE.
During the flight, pass the full airsick bag along, past the victim
(usually a new guy on his cherry blast), and to your accomplice.
Your accomplice looks in the airsick bag, grins, and begins eating the
chicken a\'la king.

This usually produced the desired result.

> I got sent to find the blank adapter for the M-203.  Which is a grenade

I heard about some newbie who was sent down to the battalion commo shop
to get a "prick E-7."  (Poor bastid!)

A recovery sled powers the tanks\' grav generators via a power umbilical (if

I also saw this film in a UK and the  audiance  cheered  ...  but
perhaps not at the right moments.  Somehow the idea  that  aliens
would come hundreds of lightyears just to destroy the USA  has  a
twisted sort of credibility.  :-^

On a more serious note: for the  Brits  on  the  list  check  out
"Independence Day UK", a joint  Fox/BBC Radio  play  released  on
audio cassette.  1 hour long  with  Nicky  Campbell  and  Patrick
Moore (among others).  ISBN 1-85849-631-4.  Image what ID4  would
have been like if it had been  multiple  films  made  around  the
world telling the same story from different perspectives.

ObTrav:
Do the inhabitants of Yori/Regina like  the  cultural  output  of
nearby Regina/Regina ... but only in small doses?  I can see many
worlds of the Imperium standing shoulder-to-shoulder against  the
Zhodani Threat, but irritating the hell out  of  each  other  the
rest of the time with culture clash.

Well, the overwhelmingly vast majority of them are...though it is only

As for \'Eve\' being mother to us all, the geaneologists weren\'t at all

takes is one generation in a particular lineage to have nothing but
males (statistically hard, but not entirely unlikely) for that
mitochondrial gene to die out.

 Over the thousands and thousands of generations, it\'s easy to see that
only one was conserved. BUT this is entirely due to the highly specific
way in which that particular genome is passed along: it is descended
from ONLY the maternal side, and the genes in mitochondria DO NOT
undergo sexual reproduction, but binary fission only.

We have to remember that we\'re talking, essentially, what started as a
parasitic (though now completely obligate symbiotic) separate organism,
with it\'s own reproductive rate, and own rate of inerent mutation.
that\'s what makes them valulable as genetic clocks.

	This is essentially what dominant means.

"In regards to character attributes, I would rule then that 
the parental attributes represent a minimum/maximum range. 
Of course, with proper training or through the results of 
disastrous events, these min/max values may be exceeded."

	Well, a couple of cautions here. A short mother and
	a short father can have a tall child. This might 
	happen due to genetics (because of peculiarities in
	the mixing of genes), though this is unlikely. Much
	more likely is that the environment in which the 
	child develops (from conception to adulthood, and 
	beyond) was different from that of the parents. Body
	size is certainly affected (I believe that persons 
	of Japanese extraction are genetically just as tall 
	as those of british extraction, it is mainly 
	differences in diet that are responsible for observed
	differences in average height), and I have no doubt
	that intelect is at least as sensitive to nutrition, 
	socialization, education, etc. This is not to say 
	that there is no genetic variance for size or intelect 
	(let\'s not go there), just that environmental variance
	may be much more important in many cases.

	I\'m getting carried away again. Bottom line: if you
	imagine that Psi is determined like other, more familiar, 
	traits, then the average of the parents might be the
	expected average for their offspring, but there could be 
	considerable variation around this value (even beyond the
	range of the parents). Say 2D-7+(parent\'s average) or
	some more clever formula that avoids too many Psi = 0 or
	Psi = 15.

I think there are enough paraphiliasts in the world to show evidence of a 
population of humans that respond to unusual sexual signals. There are 
people who respond sexually to certain garments, situations, odors, images, 
etc.  Considering that almost any human can close their eyes and have
their body respond to lubricated friction, it\'s really not that difficult to add
new cues to people\'s sexual response.

Whether that\'s the case with aliens, who knows. Does that sentient
herbivore only respond at all when in the presence of an ovulating female
of his own species? Does this sentient tentacled sea thingie have no
real sexual response at all, just an impulse to place a fertilizing packet
of goop on a female\'s distinctively colored mating ridge?

I recall a sci-fi short story where a scout team included a human, a pair
of avian humanoids and a dolphin-like alien. The dolphinoid was great
friends with the human, and there was a bit where the dolphinoid wanted
to take the relationship to another level. He\'d heard of people who had
learned the difficult art of becoming sexually intimate with other intelligent
beings, and the idea interested him, but he had no idea how to ask the 
human if she would be interested or not. Though they were friends, the
cultural gap was as strong as the biological one.

[Warning: slight naughtiness follows]

Unlikely, sure, but consider:

The signals given off by photos in a magazine, or words in 
a book, are highly, highly abstract, yet for some humans, 
they can be more sexually compelling than actual living 
people. 

Thus, I contend that a sufficiently intelligent alien can 
learn to "talk dirty, human style" in a manner sufficient 
to get a human aroused enough to let things happen.

For some ideas on how human-alien sex might happen, Phil 
Foglio\'s XXXenophile comics are a pretty good source. 
Incredibly silly stuff, for the most part (easily the 
funniest "porn" I\'ve ever encountered), but there are some 
thought-provoking ideas buried amongst the gags. 

I\'m thinking of one story in particular, where a human and
an alien are pair-bonded for political reasons, and wind up 
giving each other a "helping hand", initially out of mutual
friendship and respect. Plausible enough, I think - the only 
requirements are (1) body parts that convert friction into 
pleasure, and (2) individuals, not necessarily typical, who
aren\'t saddled with taboos about it.

Orbital platforms programmed to incinerate any permanent

That\'s an oversimplification; most "attributes" are combinations of 
many many genes.

Same problem; everyone would converge on average scores.

If you want parental stats to affect children, try taking the 
average of the parents\' stats, rounded towards "average", and 
using that to adjust the midpoint of the generation of the child\'s 
stats. Using CT stats, a 9B35xx mother and a 488Cxx father would 
have a child who would be rolled up as usual, but with the following 
DMs:

STR:  (9+4)/2 = 6.5 -> 7 = DM +0
DEX: (11+8)/2 = 9.5 -> 9 = DM +2
END:  (3+8)/2 = 5.5 -> 6 = DM -1
INT: (5+12)/2 = 8.5 -> 8 = DM +1

If you think these modifiers are too subtle, consider that 
many of the stats are affected greatly by non-genetic factors.
Strength and Endurance are largely controlled by what kind 
of exercise you get while you\'re growing up, Dexterity might
be affected by how many video games you played as a kid,
and even the statistic of Intelligence might be affected by
your environment.

Childhood nutrition plays a HUGE part as well--undernourished children
in Europe during and after WW II tend to be 1-2 inches shorter than
their genetically-related cousins whose parents emigrated to the US and
Canada before the war.

Speaking of paratroopers..

An old and hallowed tradition is the "cherry blaster helmet."

On your first jump with your unit, you wear a special helmet. brightly
colored with imaginative slogans (like "lawn dart"), spikes on top, etc.

Think about what they\'d do to jump troops on their first jump...

The CP2020 Alternative reality sourcebook \'Night\'s Edge\' had some
interesting ideas on vampires in orbit/space, and the ensuing problems.

There again, the CP2020 Deep Space Supplement is the best \'space
environment\' book that Traveller never had. IMO it beats G: Space hands
down.

Yes, and no. FFS2 went to TL15 IIRC. ISTR that the bug fixed version of
QSDS (1.5) went to TL15 too.

The T4 Rulebook\'s QSDS was capped at TL12 for most items though for some
strange reason.

In addition to the CP2020 Deep Space Supplement and Near Orbit Supplement,
there is another game that can be mined for all sorts of ideas:  High
Colonies.  I only ever saw the main gamebook and one adventure published in
a gameing magazine, but what there was seemed to be of good quality and
imagination.  IMO, it ranks above the CP2020 stuff mainly because it does
not contain the cyberpunk style setting.

The MPAT is supposed to be quite useful against a Hind and similar choppers.
A havok is going to be much harder to hit.  I can\'t remember the specifics.
Choppers is very minor.  A Hind is very deadly to a tank, and we only study
them for SNAFU scenarios, but an MPAT can be just as deadly to a Hind, if it\'s
not careful.

Err...  an M1 is alot quieter than an M60.  Downsides to turbines are
tremendous heat (and thus thermal signature), fuel consumption, and the
maintenance requirement (which u listed).  As far as fragile... the mech\'s say
the diesels were alot easier to tinker with...  

1500 hp?  I think most of the modern NATO tanks use turbines.  Almost positive
Leo IIs, Challenger IIs, and LeClercs all use turbines.

	Rapa Nui, aka Easter Island, is an alternate for failures which
prevent Return to Base (RTB) and Abort to Orbit (ATO, also called
once-around). G. Harry Stine, under his Lee Correy pseudonym, wrote a
marvelous novel called "Shuttle Down" about just such an event ...
and identified a whole string of issues which NASA hadn\'t considered.
IIRC, they basically agreed with everything he found, and implemented
changes.

got about 20M already, my account has a fairly high limit. I kept
getting automated messages from the sysadmin\'s account telling me I

excess storage, just quit the durn emails. Finally he sent me an
email back saying he\'d passed that on to accounting time and again,
and since they couldn\'t get their act together, he was just cranking

The solution is to distinguish between bacteria and viruses.
Vland would have its own set of bacteria to deal with.  However,
the Vilani live for several dozen mellenia without being exposed
to virus crossing over from other species.  The only have ones
that they brought with them (and if Grandfather simply made
sure that all his subjects weren\'t infected).  They then
evolve through this period with a greatly reduced viral
threat.  When they come into contact with the Earth and
its array of human compatible viruses....

Must be some bunch of angry natives, even using the tank as a bunker, should
still have some respectable firepower... especially if there are others
nearby.

Hmm...  The prescribed method for "destroying" a tank, should it have to be
abandoned, is to use the 8 thermite grenades deployed with each tank.  Put one
in the breech block, one over the batteries, shoot... that\'s all I can
remember for sure.  Others are probably for the radios, fire control system,
ammunition compartment (through the blow off panels), engine, and gun/turret
drive...  It renders the tank useless since it won\'t be able to move or shoot.
Using another tanks main gun is going to run into the measures designed
against enemy main guns and would be the last resort.

I expect if there were "angry natives on the warpath" (and presumably nearby)
other tanks would be shooting at these natives rather than at the friendly
tank they hope to destroy rather than have captured.  And lastly, they\'ll
should\'ve known where to shoot the tank if they wanted to (the rear not the
front and once the blow off panels are off, again w/ a direct shot, so you can
wreck the inside of the front of the turret, and the main gun), though
assumign they\'re closer than one click, its gonna do some serious damage,
though a hull hit won\'t "blow up" the tank, even if the fuel goes up (you\'ll
just blow up the engine and fuel tanks).  The things to disable/destroy are
main gun, the engine and the radios.

The M88 sucks for an M1 recovery vehicle.  It\'s far too light.  I\'ve
personally witnessed them towing an Abrams on hardball and losing control.
And (urgh) I have been stuck in the mud.  It only took 1 M88, but also bout 20
Marines and a bulldozer (which in a deployed situation would be another M88).
Congress shot down the General Dynamics recovery vehicle, though I havne\'t
heard the fate of the proposed replacement (consisting of an M1 chassis w/ the
accessories from the IIRC).  My unit just got a brand new M88, though. : |

Some sort of CG/AG "nullification field" or something.  Yeah, sounds like I\'ve
been watching too much Star Trek, but shouldn\'t it be possible for certain
conditions (excepting hte obvious: malfunction and damage) to disable Contra
Grav/Anti Gravity?

All the tanks are online except one, by a small margin, so you tell the newbie
to go behind it and push and you\'ll put the tank in neutral (despite the fact
it\'s 68 tons).  
Also to find a "roadwheel pressure gauge."  The funniest I\'ve heard of is to
get a BFA for the 120mm main gun.  The mech\'s have a gigantic replica of the
one used on the M16A2, for some reason (though what I have no idea), and
somehow someone actually got it in the main gun.  That sucker must\'ve weighed
a ton, too.  Also, I\'ve witnessed a newbie sent to get an "E8 Prick Bigmouth
wrench" from the Master Sgt and watch him blow up in mock anger, frightening
the hell out of the newbie.  Also works on Gunny\'s and Staff Sgts, though I
don\'t know anyone even dumb enough to use it on their Sgt Major or First Sgt.
Hmm...

went by the above) we had alot of friendly rivalry.  Of course, we despised
the training soldiers (tankers specifically) there as soft, weak, and
malleable, but we had been ordered to stay away from them.  IIRC, the
instructions were "Don\'t talk to them, don\'t stare them down, don\'t pick a
fight with them, but if they lay one finger on any you, rip them apart."
Amongst ourselves we had the obvious internal competition between different
platoons and tank crews, etc, too but was minor compared to coexistance with
the USMC tank mech\'s.

Our barracks had three decks (floors) to it.  Bottom deck was the Rec Deck.
It had a weight room (2 actually), a computer room (w/ a dozen, late pentium
models), rec room (bigscreen tv, chairs, couches, pool table, dart boards, etc
in an adjoining room), also w/ a turret mockup room, and a couple class rooms,
as well as the offices for the staff, etc (though the officers and the
permanent admin were in other buildings farther away).  The second deck was
the tanker deck.  The three training tank platoons split the deck amongst
them, guides, scribes, and squad leaders (sometimes) getting a 2 man room.
Everyone else getting 4 man rooms.  Third deck was the training mechanics
deck.  Tankers didn\'t go on the mech deck and mech\'s didn\'t come to the tanker
deck, but every now and then, a few of us tankers would make "raids" onto the
mech\'s deck.  We\'d put on heat protective hoods (which we never use for
anything else, actually), gloves, and get spray bottles and run through their
deck spraying down and slugging the mech\'s we coudl find and run like hell
when the whole deck would boil up out of their rooms and give chase.   They
caught one of us once, though I wasn\'t a part of that raid, and carried that
Marine, kicking and fighting, off to the head where they dunked his head in
the toilet (clean or not, he didnt\' say <g>), hogtied and gagged him and left
him on the doorstep of our deck.  We were all far too amused to be angry by
it, though we stepped up our raiding IIRC.  ;-)

ob trav.  Life in the barracks of a Regency MArCav training regiment.  When
friendly rivalry sometimes isn\'t so friendly (at least for isolated
perpetrators who get caught).

Sadly enough, it\'s a step up from the Zhunastu School of Contact (or whatever
it\'s called) in M:0.

I always envisioned the 3I as being more of  a meritocracy, than having
institutionalized racism.  The Major/Minor race thing I always thought was
something thought of and used by pointy headed academics, rather than the
populous at large.  The bloodlines (at least Solomani & Vilani, though it\'s
safe to toss in a few of the other MHRs, too, IMO) are supposed to have become
so mixed in the time during and since the Rule of Man that the differences
were largely cultural.

There was a Brits scene?  I remember the Israelis and what I think was
supposed to be Russians and Chinese, but don\'t remember any Brits.  Um...
what\'s that stereotype anyways?  I didn\'t see any Austin Powers teeth or
anything...  That\'s the only Brit stereotype I know of.

That\'s a little overreacting, no?  :-)  *That* would be the US beating the
aliens and then conquering the rest of the planet (or at least the rest of
"our" hemisphere).  ;-)

You mean, they don\'t? ;-)  Seriously, I thought they showed Mig 29s outside
that Russian farm or cave or whatever it was and an F-16 w/ the star of david
on it.  The only place we saw F/A-18s was in the fighting over teh US, wasn\'t
it?  (Specifically the "ruins of downtown LA" and Area 51).  The part that got
me was (ignoring the female protagonist, and her dog, surviving the blast in
that closet or whatever when everything else was annihalated) was the crazy
old crop duster guy ramming the "main weapon" and causing the whole thing to
blow up.  That and other obvious things (the computer compatiblity, the
internal defenses, or lack of, in the "mothership"), etc etc.

Me 2, though it\'s probably more likely that alien ship would\'ve landed *on*

Area 51, flattening/caving it in, mostly.  Etc etc.

Yup.  Plus, foreign events for me is usually what happens in Texas or on the
east coast or backwater of Arkansas.  ;-)  j/k.  Really.  I am.  Stop looking
at me like that.  

To effectively add the "foreign effect" would\'ve meant adding significant
footage (and sfx) to the movie (probably double for a "good" treatment).
Since the movie is focused on the invasion over the US, for a US audience who
just wouldn\'t be interested in what the aliens did on the other side of the
globe, it would\'ve been kinda superfluous to have that footage, I think,
though different foreign "editions" from different viewpoints, as someone
suggested, would\'ve been pretty cool.  

Non Americans on the list seem almost unanimous in their contempt (much like
the Americans, too, it seems).  How did the box office numbers do in Europe
and Canada, anyone?  IIRC it did pretty good here, though i don\'t remember for
sure... think July 4th was like a wednesday or thursday that year (95?),
wasn\'t it?  Not having the demographics or anything, I\'d think the same crowd
that flocked to see ID4 are the ones who see horror movies and other action
flicks.  Realism is neither required nor desired.

Why would they want to do that?  It\'s all bout money and IIRC Hollywood movies
make far more money overseas than foreign films do domestically in the US,
where it\'s a niche market, if anything.  Plus, when you come down to it, most
movies from anywhere are the same basic plot with different faces and details
and possibly a new twist now and then.

Summary Report:
- ----
The Kenji Construct continues to prove the most effective of our
assimilated personalities. Fortunately, none of the specimens within the
Terpitude, Moral - Laboratory (TML hereafter) appeared to notice the brief
period in which the construct was not present whilst personality
programming and transfer was achieved.

Reintroduction of the \'Kenji\' personality has now been achieved; evidence
has been gathered to demonstrate that the specimens are locked in the same
cyclic behavioural patterns as before. Indeed, it is possible that these
cycles are accelerating, which may result in destruction of specimens
unable to adapt to the environment.

As a result we recommend that the development of the \'Ian/Ditzie\' Schitzoid
Personality Construct, and the moderated variant of the Darroch/Hengebar
Construct \'Ross\' is accelerated before adaption failures occur. Indeed,
some adaption is proceeding in ways unpredicted by the programme, and
requires correction. Both the \'Berry-Sniper\' Specimen, and the
\'Bloo-Lawyer\' Specimen show disturbing levels of awareness of the
programme\'s existance and aims. The \'Clif\' Personality Construct has been
introduced to compliment the \'Heretic-Reddoch\' Construct\'s program of
disinformation and direction.

Advice and Review of the Programme to date is requested.

One of my characters in our recent M:1100 campaign (using T4 rules) was
an Imperial Army officer who had spent most of his career in cav (light
armor) units.  As the campaign began, he was assigned as S-2 to the jump
troop regiment that my other character commanded.  Needless to say, he
had to go through accelerated jump training.

First drop with the unit was a "Hell on the half-shell" ablative
reentry.

(Fortunately, I made a roll to maintain my composure, and therefore did
not have to report to the SEP [Skivvie Exchange Point] post-drop.)

Suerrat - thickset, between 4 and 5 foot high (taller than the Geonee but not
as broad) covered in hair, wearing what looks like a one-piece swimsuit and a
holster for a handgun. My general take was, also taking into account the name,
that these guys were the equivalent of how half-orcs used to be played in AD&D.
Also I recall reading somewhere that Suerrat form the majority of humaniti in
Illelish? I guess more detail would have been available had the Black Duke ever
been published.

Cassildan - tall, skinny, hollow-cheeked, nerdy looking, with a Turkish type
costume and a sword.

The illustration is by Blair Reynolds.

IMTU, the Abyss is a bit like the Bermuda Triangle - over-rated. ;-)
However, the fact remains that three worlds in the centre are Red-Zoned, at
least one due to the Ancient artifacts (black globes) found there, so there
is more intrigue (read: plotlines) available to be mined. Although the
Ancients can be overused...

If the PCs want to investigate, work out about three "real" unexplainables

Reese AFB was #1 (so Air Force rookies would not overrun the runway) and
nothing to run into at either end of the runway.  Last I heard Lubbock

Is that actually "wildly unsuited", or would it be more accurate to say
"unsuitably wild"?  ;-)  (If the latter, have you considered a career as
a US Army interrogator [MOS 97E]?)

ObTrav:  One way to explain a failed survival roll would be to declare
that the character was deemed to be unsuited for service in the
traditional branches.  This does not mean, however, that the character
is unsuited for service in Intelligence, in the service from which the
character would otherwise be discharged.

Full story goes like this.  An M1 from 24th Infantry Div bogged down during
Desert Storm (the quagmires in Southern Iraq were notorious)  .  24th ID
was pretty much the extreme left of the hook movement and ran into some
meaningful resistance from an Iraqi Guards division.  This particular tank
was stuck and left behind to wait for a recovery vehicle while its unit
continued to advance.  Unfortunately, the US line was far from solid at
this point and some Iraqi units had been missed and/or bypassed.  A trio of
T-72s showed up, probably completely lost.  The US crew, possibly hoping
not to be seen, waited it out.  (They were on the radio screaming for help
at this point)    The Iraqis opened fire at less than 1000 yards and
bounced at least two HEAT rounds of the M1\'s frontal armor to no effect. 
The M1 returned fire with sabot, blowing one T-72 to pieces with the first
shot and blew the engine out of the second one from the rear as it ran. 
The third T-72 fired sabot at less than 400 yards and failed to do damage
to the M1, despite a solid hit.  It then decided to take cover behind a
nearby sand berm.  The M1 put a sabot round *through* the berm for a
catastrophic kill on the third T-72.

The standard version of this story has it that no explosives were
available.  Why? I don\'t know.  My guess is that they just wanted to see
how tough the thing really was and this was a good opportunity. 

BTW: after the ammo panels blew out, they put a round in the gun of the
stuck tank, and fired it ... successfully.  The sights were out of whack,
but the gun itself was intact.

As it turns out, mines were the real tank killers in ODS.

ObTrav, is there and way to build a practical anti-grav tank mine.?  I was
thinking some sort of one shot plasma weapon, with low-cost passive sensors
for acquisition and a basic comm net to coordinate attacks .   How cheap
can you make a grav sensor?

You\'d need to sit down with the book.

Appearance is controlled by a shitload of genes. So it *might* average.
Then again, it might not.

Remember, for each of the millions of genes in their DNA, the offspring
gets ones from the father and one from the mother. At any given "slot",
there are a variety of possible genes IN THE GENOME. But only those
present in one of the parents can show up an individual (ignoring
mutations). 

So if the kid gets A from the father and B from the mother, the results
could be A (if A is dominant and B is recessive), B (if B is dominant
and A is recessive) or perhaps some mix of the two (if neither is
dominant). 

Then there are things like sex-linked genes....

Actually, those sound like the *contigency* landing sites. 

Rota, Spain, and someplace in Japan are also alternates, most of the
alternates are for situations where the shuttle hasn\'t gained enough
speed after launch to do an "abort to orbit" (lower than normal orbit)
or "abort once around" (a sort of *long* suborbital trajectory that\'ll
bring it back to the launch site). They also come into play if there\'s
a situation where the shuttle needs to make a de-orbit burn *now*
rather than waiting until it\'d bring them down at a preffered landing
site. 

The shuttle doesn\'t have a lot of flexibility in selecting a landing
site once it starts the de-orbit burn, or if it fails to acieve orbit.

But if it *has* to, it can land at any decent sized airport. It just
needs a reasonably long runway, oriented in something approximating the
proper direction. And modern navigational aids help (though the shuttle
doesn\'t have some of the most common, and almost wasn\'t fitted with
*any* non-military/NASA nav-aids until the astronauts objected
*loudly*)

That\'s why G. Harry Stine wrote "Shuttle Down". He was pointing out the
fact that NASA\'s contigency planning had *huge* holes in it. He choose
to take a "worst case", namely go with then still possible idea of
shuttle launches from Vandenberg. This was (and still *is*) a good
idea, because you can\'t easily get into true polar orbits from the
Cape. The allowable launch paths don\'t angle enough to the south. 

But with a Vandenberg launch, the *only* possible abort site other than
once around is Easter Island. Which presents a *world* of problems.
Many of which apply to *any* site outside the US. 

Examples: The 747 that carries the Shuttle back to Kennedy only has a
range of 3000 miles. And *no* fittings for midair refueling. That\'ll
make returning from any non-US landing *really* interesting. 

The Shuttle does not carry an airworthiness certificate (required by
international law for *all* aircraft). It does not cary licenses for
the radio transmitters on board. The crew do not carry passports. Any
one of these could result in the confiscation of the Shuttle and the
detainment of the crew if the government of the country it lands in
wants to get picky.

Oh yeah, the OMS system (steering jets) uses *highly* toxic chemicals.
As in a leak after landing could wipe out a small city. 

And a *real* capper. Due to lack of on-board cooling capability, the
crew *must* leave the shuttle immediately after touchdown. At the
normal touchdown sites, there\'s a rollup "ladder, and gear to force
cool air thru the ship. At anyplace else, they\'ll have to wait for the
ship to cool on it\'s own. But once it\'s cooled, they\'\'l have to dig up
a *ladder* to get back into the ship!

Can\'t you just picture it though? The Shuttle makes the landing, the
crew drops out of the hatch, and then later, they can\'t get back in? 
You can\'t use a ldder that leans against the hull, because that\'d
damage tiles. You need a free-standing boarding ramp of some sort. But
most aren\'t adjustable. They\'re built to match standard aircraft, and
the Shuttle hatch is at the wrong height!

Stine suggested that they could easily afford the "extra" weight of one
of those roll-up ladders such as are sold for emergency escapes from
homes.

It\'s probably a complex involving so many genes that heritability is a
nightmare to map *when* you know what genes to track. 

Also, if psi *is* hereditary, you quickly wind up with Darkover during
the "Age of Chaos". If you aren\'t familar with Darkover, picture a
planet settled by a misjumping colony ship. The planet has deposits of
a crystal with psi amplification properties.

Over the centuries, the colonists develop psi to a fine art, and since
it *is* obviously hereditary, they started breeding to enhance existing
types and to conserve any new types that showed up. They even did some
psi-based genetic engineering. 

They developed a *psi* based technology that has to be equivalent to
around TL-12 to 16. And they fought terrible wars. Which led to
breeding people as weapons and other serious abuses. They barely
survived that phase of their history. 

Anyway, Zhodani culture would almost *have* to follow that sort of path
if psi was clearly inheritable. And it\'s been done. :-)

Darkover as a *planet* can be fun. As a stellar empire it\'s a bit much.

One example of the "fun" is the off-worlders who don\'t understand *why*
Darkover has the "Compact". VBasicly a law to the effect that no
weapons that operate beyond arms reach or that don\'t expose the
attacker to retaliation by the victim are allowed. So swords are
common, and arrows are only used for hunting and (rarely) against
outlaws. 

It all seems so primitive. And the offworlders *assume* that this is
some silly code of honor thing. Until the day they get caught up in
local politics and an artifact from the Age of Chaos resurfaces. After
seeing just what a psi weapon can be like (as I recall they lost a good
chunk of a starport), they suddenly decided that these "primitives"
weren\'t so primitive. And fell all over themselve to ensure that the
Compact was kept. 

Of course, a couple generations later the offworld authorities have
convinced themselves that the old reports had to be exaggerations. And
things start to get ugly again.

Rather a fun way to teach players that there may be *other*
technologies, based on quite different principles than ours, but just
as powerful.

I\'ve always thought that the contragravity and thruster plates are,
themselves, a vulnerability.  IMTU - they *must* be exposed to be effective
(and that means unarmored.)  Any vehicle relying on contragravity tends to
go to ground in a combat situation, rather than permit open shots at it\'s
plates.  Of course, this does leave it open to ground based weapons (mines),
but one *hopes* to be high enough to avoid damage from those.

This too is one of the many types of porphyria.

The porphyrias as a group of disorders have a common pathophysiology :-
disordered metabolism of porphyrin rings, which hold the iron atom in
haemoglobin (among other things). 

Different genetic errors result in aberrant synthetic and degradative
enzymes being produced, and the accumulation of various intermediate
compounds.

Accumulated porphyrin degradation products in the variant Jeff has
described above are extremely photosensitive.

Recent research in developmental biology (embryology) suggests that
brain development
is heavily influenced by maternal genes, while the rest of the body is
influenced by the paternal contribution.

This obviously considers \'genetic potential\' only, not environmental
factors.

Logically then, Western society has it all upside down. Brilliant women

Traveller Ships.

There is a new version up at

http://209.39.36.25/gurps/

This one has quite a few enhancements and a few more bug fixes.  

Enhancements:

The Repository - A special little db to store non-standard systems 
in.  Currently there is support for Bridges, Manuever Drives, 
Engineering Spaces and Utility Modules.  They are all accessible 
from within the appropriate dialog boxes.  You can substitute any of 
these non-standard systems in place of the ones that are specified 
in GT.  All your existing ship files should still work.  The Repository 
is currently filled with testing modules that I created to test the 
program.  You may delete them without fear of losing anything.  
When you have your own designed, input it and then use it.

Ability to clamp the ship\'s Acceleration and the number of modules 
fluxuate with the rest of the ship design.

Ability to clamp the ship\'s Jump Rating and the number of modules 
fluxuate with the rest of the ship design.

Renamed User Defined to Other.

Separated the Manuever Drive from the Jump Drive dialog box.  It 
was getting TOO crowded.

Removed the Fuel Tank from the Aux Jump Engine.

Fixes:

- - Sealing Cost fix 
- - Nuclear Damper Cost fix 
- - Sand Cannister Cost fix 
- - Removed appropriate "Other" total volume from Total Ship 
Volume (it looked like there was more volume allocated than there 
actually was.) 
- - Removed Hull Mounted weapons from Surface Area calculations. 
- - Reversed Empty Mass and Loaded Mass Labels 

Well, I hope you like it.

That was in Analog. There were several stories with those characters. I

IIRC they did become intimate in the final story.

I met a yeoman once who claimed to have pulled an even nastier prank on
some FNGs.  Once the ship was at sea (so the story goes), he would
complete inprocessing the newbies.  He would ask them, "Are you straight
or gay?"  Since this was before "don\'t ask, don\'t tell", the newbies
would generally answer that they were straight.  At this point, the
yeoman would assume a worried expression.  When the newbies would ask
what was wrong, the yeoman would proceed to inform them that, due to
some kind of foul-up, they had accidentally been assigned aboard a "gay"
ship.  Since the "error" had not been caught prior to the ship putting
to sea, the yeoman didn\'t know how long it would take to rectify the
situation....

\'frankensteined"  the ole AD camapign and spun off a 21C one. Now

the "N"th Intersteller Wars and why over several thousand years never

not discovering us or our media transmissions ranks with the "Vegan
Tyranny" not discovering Earth in Classic Trek (whose history doesn\'t
exist in the Berman "Yeech!" ST).

The poor Viliani reguarded us with the same fear and loathing that we
have when we run into on a lonely road in New Mexico a sign "Warning:
Intensely Radioactive Zone Ahead". We scare the gruntbugglies out of
\'em! In fact they\'re so scared its like when you  have arachnophobia and
are just too \'white\' with fear to stomp on the tiny eight-legged

small children round the fireside. The terrans were to the Vilani what
the dreaded *NACH!, the smart barbarian, is to the Kafers of 2300AD.
BTW, I also think the MECHs the UN Marine used on 51 Pegasai 2114
reminded them too much of those not-forgotten boogie-man. the dreaded,
long dead, Grandfathers lil XMAS toy, the 500M Warbot. Four thousand
years later and the Vilani are still trying to change all their
underpants! Only in the past thousand years of interbreeding have the

Nothing prevents it except for the probable lack of the three skilled
telepaths who do not have something better to do.  Psionic Zhodani will
be officers, by definiton, and may have other duties to perform as
well.  Only about half of psionic Zhodani will be telepathic, the rest
will have other talents.  Remember that Zhodani charecter generation
includes the Non-Verbal Communication skill and more frequently grants
the Psychology skill so even non Telepathic Zhodani may be more capable
of conducting information gathering than the average Imperial.

Are you the _only_ prisoner that the Zhodani have captured?

I could see the use of teams on apparently important Imperial prisoners
but in general it seems unlikely.

Some versions of Traveller rules make psionics more difficult between
species.  If true IYTU this might mean that in Spinward Marches military
units non humans may have slightly higher clearance on average then
humans as it will be harder for the Zhodani to read their minds.

Original FF&S had Gravitic Displacement as a possible substitution for Contra
Grav, which had interesting possiblilities for mines.  Might say that some
kind of device/specialized sensor can pick up CG/AG emissions maybe.  After
all, isn\'t their workings (for T4 anyways) that they "push" off the planet or
something?  How would the FF&S conception interact?  Should be some way it
affects the enviornment around it, which might be detectable and respondable
by a directed missile/tac nuke/explosion/one-shot laser, etc.

I noticed that awhile back.  I was thinking it might have something to do w/
the deckplans being out of wack, so I recently asked the resident Deck Plans
expert, GypsyComet, and he said he hadn\'t checked the Donosev (IIRC), but that
alot of volume could be in the frame.  Anyone done an analysis on the DGP
deckplans?

Of course. Though, as we were in the New Zealand forces, it wasn\'t a
Federal offence

Also, if we had been caught, as we were on recruit course we would
likely only have been charged with being in the female barracks,
disproving an impersonation charge in such a situation wold have been
too easy.

Actually most of the back up sites are in other parts of the world,
because as you know the Shuttle has no power on landing, and they may
not be able to make it all the way round the planet to the US.

Ones I know of are the RAF base on Christmas Island,  and Auckland

They would have preferred an airforce base, but our biggest one can
only just land a 747, US C5\'s usually land at Christchurch Airport, a
civilian airport.

Well, here\'s another bit of trivia for you, the kiwi fruit isn\'t eaten
by kiwis. They actually fill the same ecological niche as the
"anteater" and similar creatures.

The kiwi fruit is actually what used to be called the chinese
gooseberry. A clever kiwi marketer noticed that "chinese gooseberies"
didn\'t sell well in the US, so he changed the name to avoid US
anti-communist sentiment.

However, the concept of a huge "Killer Kiwi" does have "historic"
precedent. The extinct "moa" was an ostrich-like bird of the kiwi
family that grew to some twelve feet IIRC.

It was, however far too easy capture and kill and was just about
completely wiped out by the Maori using spears and pits prior to the
arrival of Europeans.

Ob Trav: We\'ve had the "Grendel" idea, where the arrival of humans on
a new world disrupts the ecology in a rather dangerous way, has anyone
had an adventure where the native creatures are just too easy to hunt
and kill ?

Or where they are trying to preserve a rare animal _against_ the
wishes of sentient natives who find them easy food ? Or represent an
importrant part of some adolesence ritual ?

Remember that minor human races are minor in numbers as well.  Sevety
five billion Darmine (75,000,000,000) are a drop in the bucket compared
to fifteen trillion (15,000,000,000,000) sophonts in the Imperium for
example.  Most minor races will probably have populations that are, at
best, in the billions so ther are not enough if them to colonize a
number of worlds even absent the institutionalized racism of the whole
major race/minor race bit.

Some people might think that your use of the word _claim_ implies a
certain lack of belief in said statements.  A more value neutral version
might be _say_ not claim. Claim can be interpreted as your expressing
doubt in their statements.  Some people might interpret this as your
implying that they are lying or deluded when they suggest that their
sexual orientation was predetermined, not chosen.  Some people get
offended when other people imply this sort of thing.  Since we know that
no one on the TML would wish to inadvertantly offend others it might be
desireable to reduce the use of the world claim when describing what
others have said.  This is true even when, or perhaps especially when,
such statements involve controversial topics.

For example:

Pro choice lobby claims they do not kill babies. Germans claim they are
not all Nazis.  Italian Americans claim that most of them do not have
mob ties.  Democrats claim that they are not conspiring to help the UN
take over the US.  Heterosexuals claim that overpopulation is not their
fault.  Vietnam veterans claim they are not all baby killers.

Are all statements that could be interpreted as casting doubt on a claim
in a controversial non Traveller area.  This seems to me to be a bad
thing.

While possibly ineffective, in Spinward Marches campaigns I\'ve given
imperiumers and their client states a technique of resisting [Zho\'] mind
probe by a process of actively thinking of random and unrelated things.

An interrogation may therefore go like this:

\'Name?\'
...     [Thinks \'A kilo of sausages, a length of string, wash the tea cup]
\'Name?\'
...     [Thinks \'A business card from home, the number 7, a red sock]
\'Name?\' <SLAP>
...Ugh! [Thinks \'Ugh! , Two pink elephants, a porcelain carrot]
\'Take this imbecile away, No food or sleep for 12 hours.\'

Essentially this technique is viable as long as reading surface thoughts is
done, and ineffective once the subject is exhausted or distressed enough to
loose concentration. Its chief value is in causing the belief that \'we can
resist their [Zho] thought police\'. I\'ve run this is a morale effect rather
than a realistic one.

Shooting down a city with a sidewinder...

Why worry about using nukes when:
	(a) the target is over a destroyed city
	(b) the target is bigger than the city and when it crashes...

Apparently some Hollyweird film co has decided to make a film about the
capture of the \'Enigma\' code machine from a German U-Boat by an American
destroyer into a film - the only problem is that it was a British convoy
escort that did the dirty deed.

Reminds me of the story that someone trashed a cinema (movie theatre) when
someone in the audience happened to mention that Titanic sank...  Seems like
the guy was a bit put out that someone let slip the ending - like maybe Leo
and Kate would get to live happily ever after instead.
Oh, and it now appears that there may have been a burgeoning romance between
a Purser and a Lady passenger, shades of Leo & Kate...

ObTrav:  Suppose someone starts overwriting Imperial Archives; how would
they be caught?  How long would it take before the \'revised\' version was
accepted as \'canon\'?

Finally, the \'Ground\' Burst in ID4 was an *Air* Burst, the APC was on the
far side of the Alien ship, and the Stealth Bomber had it\'s Transponder
switched on and squaking a civvie code in case the aliens tracked it - the
US Forces knew it was Stealth and not a Korean Air B747 slightly off
course...  Oh, and I believe the F/A18 Hornet is a Navy/Marine Corps bird
rather than Air Force, IIRC (although the British Government has recently
amalgamated the entire UK Harrier/Sea Harrier inventory as an RAF
package...)

The story I mentioned about the stuck M1 is from the Gulf War (have M1\'s
been used anywhere else??) I initially heard from a friend at work interestd
in such things - so I put it down to a slight case of exageration ( I agree
about the \'grenades in the turret basket\' method of tank destruction).  But
then I read it in Tom Clancy\'s "Armored Warfare", pages 57 & 58, so figured
that if *Tom Clancy* is prepared to put his name to it then it must have a

There was a scene in Iraq with some Bertie Wooster clones chatting to some
Iraqis before setting off in their RAF F-16s (!) to prang some aliens.
I\'ve heard they tailor movies to the various markets - maybe this was a 
version for us Brits, talk about badly targetting an audience! The other

universe ;-)

I think it was the fact that the invasion occured for jingoistic purposes
on July 4th.

I was kinda hoping that there\'d be some sort of seismic wave from all
those saucer crashes (They are supposed to be 10 miles wide after all).
I\'d have loved to end the movie with the heros looking at the wreck of the
ship, then noticing some wave-like effect moving towards them, a quick \'Oh
S***\' - then darkness. Muhhahahahah! OBTRAV: pesky aliens must have left
their CG on!

It did pretty well over here - though I think there were a lot of ladies
watch because Will Smith was in it. Put me off Devlin and Emmerlich for
good - thank god, meant i missed Godzilla. 

On a related note - Star Trek: Insurrection did far better in Europe than
the US. Are we getting the bad taste/no sense bug?

OBTRAV: PCs land on a planet which *loves* an imported spy show, which
just happens to be made on the homeworld of one or more of the characters.
Natives are continually speaking to the PC with show catchphrases, asking
them about the program (virtually unknown at home), being invited to Fan
Cons, and getting hassled by incoherent drunks in bars. Any disrespect
could be dangerous - and might lead to a \'jolly good thrashing!\'.

A goodly chunk of any interest I might have had in military service was
vaporized by the visit of a navy intelligence recruiter who barged into my
Classical Tibetan class one day to deliver a long clueless spiel about the
importance of Tibetan ports & coastal waters in the defence of the Indian
Ocean against communist encroachment.

Besides, I doubt any of the military intelligence folks take on pierced &
tattooed cross-dressing drug-drug users like me.

And furthermore, if I want to make a career out of screwing with people\'s
heads and extracting information from them, hell, I\'m _in_ academe.  It
doesn\'t pay quite as good and there\'s not as much job security, true, but
you\'ve got a lot more operational freedom.

So perhaps they could begin adventuring while on some sort of "detatched

intelligence branches?  Interesting idea...

	On whether they got the extra back, and sent them to whoever was

	Oh, feedback about the books! To be honest, I\'m on the road so much,
and not currently playing, that I haven\'t done more than browse
through them. I think some of the 101 Plots entries were a bit
sparse, requiring more effort than the intro of 101 Plots suggests
before they can be used as a "spur-of-the moment" diversion, but good
seeds. I also felt that the descriptions of some of the religions in
101 Religions were just too sparse for me to do anything with, but
then I\'m the kind of person who sometimes needs things spelled out a
bit more.

	Having said that, my overall recommendation: they\'re absolutely
worth having for any referee. The entire series seems to be a
goldmine of nuggets and ideas. Plus, they\'re the same size as the
LBBs!

>>>>>>>>>>>>>
I\'ve never been a helicopter pilot, but I\'ve enjoyed some games of "Gunship".
"Gunship" is an AH-64 combat flight simulator program, and from what
I\'ve heard it does a reasonable job of presenting the flight characteristics
of an AH-64 with combat stores aboard.

One thing I noticed was that once you gained some altitude and got
above the ground pressure effect, you often needed some forward
motion to add lift if you wanted to do any serious climbing. The way
the helo\'s rotors are designed, the spinning rotor assembly generates
more lift moving forward than it does sitting still. With a heavy combat
load, your helo would usually stop climbing at the top of ground pressure
effect until you started moving it forwards.

You turn a helo sharply by tilting it. When you tilt it, you lose lift - the
rotors aren\'t lifting you upwards as much when they\'re not oriented "up".
It\'s quite easy for lift added by forward motion to be canceled out by lift lost 
during sharp turns.

So, we have helos fighting at close range in between skyscrapers. 
Godzilla has a ground speed faster than the helos, they can turn
marginally faster. If they fly straight to gain enough lift to climb out
of reach, Godzilla catches them and eats them. If they make a series
of sharp turns to evade Godzilla, they stay ahead of him but can\'t climb
out of reach.

Note how short the helo chase scene really was - only a few minutes.
The situation went from "Hunting Big Game" to "Big Game Hunting Us"
very quickly, the Helo pilots didn\'t have any time to re-evaluate the
situation once they found themselves in danger - and in danger from
an opponent they hadn\'t been trained to fight.

Not that I think the movie didn\'t blow lots of details, but this is one that
didn\'t feel that wrong to me when I saw it.

1) Could someone offer a _rough_ estimate of how many officers are present in the 
ship\'s troops? For example, in the Command Section, it states that there are 50% 
officers and 50% ratings. I know that this is a grossly inaccurate way of doing it, 
since the actual number of officers would be calculated from the type of troops carried 
(A marine company would have different number than a army regiment which would be 
different than a naval security squad, etc....). But, High Guard is supposed to be 
simple, and I only need an estimate.

2) Are petty officers considered officers as far as quarters and the "Fighting Ships" 
style listings? For example, a ship may be listed as having "7 officers, 20 ratings" in 
the listing - in which category are the POs listed? IMTU, Officers always have a 
stateroom to themselves (whereas ratings are 2 per stateroom). Where should POs be?

3) Finally (and this isn\'t really military related, but...) are all of the Service 
branch ratings? It doesn\'t list Officer/PO percentages...

I know the above isn\'t "official" or canon...I\'m just trying to add some flavor to some 
designs of mine...

Thanks for the help...

Because the interregator can play games.  He can say "Don\'t bother trying
to conceal your unit, because you were captured as we were mopping them all
up."  Try not to think of your friends in that situation.

I assumed the aliens did nothing because they knew we didn\'t have anything
that could hurt them.  (Of course they didn\'t know about the Powerbook
weilding Jeff Goldblum.)

I can\'t help picturing the alien\'s reaction to our use of nuclear weapons
in Mars Attacks.

The series was caled "Chimera".  "Gor" was the nickname of the cross-bred
character.  His name was Gordon, but when he was young, his vocal cords weren\'t
developed enough for him to pronounce his full name.  All he could manage was
"Gor", and the name stuck.

I am.  My work is focused on the time from First Contact to the 
beginning of the First Interstellar War.  The campaign is called 
"Project: StarRise"

Andrew M-V is working on the Interstellar War period in his work, 
"Prometheus Rising"

And Rob Eaglestone is constructing a pre-Contact focussed E21 Milieu, 
which he has been sharing with us of late.  (Thanks, Rob.)

Each one has it\'s own variations and spinoffs based on the limited 
canonical information of the time period.

I\'d be interested in hearing what you have to share, and exchanging 
info.  It definitely seems to be the latest thing in alternative 
campaign periods.  :)

Go to stores for a long wait. Oh yes, remember it well. On subs, telling
someone to get permission to blow the TASO is quite good.

(The TASO being the Torpedo & Sonar Officer, and not a tank that you
might want to vent out to sea.)

Challenger II - 1200 hp diesel

BTW, the Swedish army choose the Leopard II over the M1 because of 
concerns with maintenance of turbines (actually I\'ve heard that the US 
nearly choose the Leopard II instead of developing the M1).

On a modern CVN (Nimitz class) there were about 40 troops and 2

Petty officers are ratings. "officers" are Rank O1+ in traveller.

On modern CVN\'s, all E1-E6 share the same bunkroom. 
Chief PO\'s (E7-E9) all share their own CPO bunkroom separate from the
lower enlisted personnel.
Officers O1-O4 share rooms (1-4 men, depending on rank and the size of
the room, but they all have beds and full-size lockers, as opposed to
E1-E6 who have only small lockers).
O5+ usually have their own SRs, including the Admiral\'s staff.
the captain has both an At-sea cabin (near the bridge) AND an inport
cabin with a conference room, etc.

Any female crew are in separate bunkrooms/staterooms as appropriate to
rank.

branch ratings? It doesn\'t list Officer/PO percentages..

If I understand this question properly, yes. Everyone has a Branch. Line
Officers are the ones who can take command.

"Rating" refers to any Enlisted person over E3. The term is used in
reference to someone who is skilled enough in his job to work
independently of constant supervision. (When I was a CTISN
(cryptologist, Seaman I was a "non-rated sailor" in Navy parlance. At
CTI3 (Cryptologist Third Class, I was a "rating", although in the modern
US Navy, the term isn\'t used: we just say \'Petty Officer\'.)
B
asically, E4-E9 are "ratings" and, insofar as Traveller is concerned,
everyone (E1-O10) have a Branch.
In the US navy, E1-E3 don\'t necessarily have a Branch yet: they are
either Airmen, Seamen, Firemen (Enrgr branch), or a specialty like
Medical or Dental. At E4 they must have received a rate. (for instance,
I entered boot camp with a college degree as an AN (airman). changed to
SN (seaman), then went to crypto school and changed my insignia to CTISN
(but was still called non-rated).

Complicated, but does that help?

All this IMTU.

Since the Imperium exists as a trade federation, it would be in it\'s best
interest to make trade outside the Imperium difficult.  There are many
little ways to make cross-border trade difficult.  Customs can impose fees,
put items into quarantine, require foreign traders to purchase expensive
licenses, etc..

Many independent worlds in the early days joined the Imperium simply to get
in on the large market (none of this Zhunastu school of contact bushwah.)

>And while I\'m at it are there special regulations for travel to nations 
>outside the Imperium?

That would depend on the nation being traveled to.  The Sword Worlds, for
example, tend to require Imperials to carry a visa for the SWC itself,
along with one for every world on the itinerary.  This level of bureaucracy
tends to discourage all but the most determined traveller...

IIRC, they have a penile bone which enables them to copulate at will.

Although the two stories are set in the same universe, and even
have a principal character in common, they are separated by about
30,000 years in time, many many parsecs in space, and the stories
are totally independent.

I\'ll not give away any of the plot, except to note that there are
some interesting parallels in the events of ADitS and AFutD, and
that Vinge has again succeeded in creating a believable alien
race.  The style is very much the same, switching between
viewpoints of principal characters from all involved "sides", and
man/machine interaction and data networks play an important part
in the story.  As with AFutD, a good read, and IMO well worth the

Well, I was in the USN and on a troop transport.  IIRC, there was 
typically one Junior Officer for about every 80 troops.  And one 
Medium Officer for about every 6 JO and 1 Senior Officer over all of 
them.  We carried about 300-400 troops.

Of course, it has been years since I was in ...

Treat them as senior enlisted.

Closer to the head (bathroom) then the junior enlisted.

In today\'s navy there are only 3 enlisted ranks and 6 PO ranks.  But 
all of the PO are considered "enlisted."  At E4+ they are also 
considered Non-Commissioned Officers (NCO).

Suggested Breakdown out of a crew of about 300
0  E1 Seaman Recruit - Bootcamp
60  E2 Seaman Apprentice
100  E3 Seaman
80  E4 PO 3rd Class
30  E5 PO 2nd Class
20  E6 PO 1st Class
10  E7 Chief PO
3  E8 Senior Chief PO
1  E9 Master Chief PO

Rough estimates ... my shop  had over 75% percent E5\'s.  There 
were only 18 of us.

1 Senior CPO
12 E5s
2 E4s
3 Firemen (E3)

The E4s and the Firemen got the grunt work ... a lot!

On our ship, all bunks were stacked 3 high.  E6\'s typically got the 
middle rack, Junior enlisted got the top rack and Middle PO 
generally got the bottom rack.  Or course, some people liked the 
top bunk and "made" a junior enlisted take the bottom one.  I 
personally won my middle bunk in a poker game.

The Chief\'s all shared a common berthing area ... that looked 
remarkably like the rest of the enlisted\'s ... only they didn\'t have to 
keep it clean.

Junior Officers usually shared a stateroom (2 each).  Senior 
Officers got their own.  The CO and XO each had a bedroom with a 
real bed!

Oh, well.  Enough of this.  I\'m starting to get a headache thinking of 
those days!

Not to mention the RAF flying F16s and Jeff Goldblum\'s Magic PowerBook

Plots 2nd edition is about 1/3 written (and growing). It should be better,
especially in the sense it\'ll strip out the \'weird science\' rubbish. It
probably won\'t go a million miles from the style of 76 patrons though.

Religions had the problem that we had to edit it for space. The problem
arose from the 101 name.... IIRC it\'s the biggest of all the books.

My favourites are Travellers and Rendezvous.

How do you figure? If we can\'t wipe \'em out, then we all

and security of life goes way down, but that\'s a long, 
long way from "end of life on earth." Now, if Alien were

Hmm. That one went to the wrong place. Didn\'t think it was worth a list
response, but obviously my mail filters did.

Okay, I\'ll admit it. 101 Plots is to have a sequel. It was the first book
and looking back is quite sparse compared to the rest, not to mention we\'ve
had a few moans about the lack of scientific rigour in a few of the plots
(weird science reference). Anyway, it depends on whether you like lava
surfing. Generally it\'s a great resource, but my personal favourites are
Travellers and Rendezvous. Cargos (in both editions) comes  close third.
(Excluded - Lifeforms and Religions)

So we\'ve started to compile another 101 plotlines. Don\'t know when it\'ll be
out, or even if it will be called 2nd edition, or even if it will replace
the 1st Edition. 101 More Plots, maybe?

On top of that are:

ACQ (in layout)

101st Spaceborne (when Doug breaks the writer\'s block,  Dericks monitor
returns to the land of the living, and Peter\'s computer recovers)

Scenarios (more news later)

101 Gadgets (draft underway)

Dom (enjoying the fact the TML has returned to TRAVELLER)

Aieeeeee CHUPACABRA!!!!

For those of you NOT from the southwest of the US, a chupacabra is an
alleged vampire goat killing monster that inhabits these regions.
Actually the myth is seemingly widespread throughout central america and
the carribean, as well.

But every few years theres a rash of reports that make the news (usually
the Weekly World News, that is...)

been the butt of a number of jokes, and possibly the genises behind
Predator...

Do a web search on chupacabra, and you\'ll be treated to more than you
ever wanted to know, I\'m sure ;-)

Yes, IE is one of those places where this erroneous information may be found.

Coulda swore the only F-16 I saw in that movie was one w/ a star of David on
it.  I\'m not bout to find a tape of it and verify, mind you.  lol

Maybe it\'s the tailoring thing.  I do seem to remember there\'s an english
speaking character at the radio with some kind of accent that might\'ve been
English, I suppose.  But the others were Israelis and Iraqis, i\'m pretty sure.

Much like Godzilla always going for Tokyo and that Brit ripoff I saw on that
old movie channel (AMC I think, and that has to be one of the funniest movies
I\'ve ever seen), etc etc.

That would actually be a good time for aliens to conduct an overarching
strategy, though wouldn\'t work anything like the Yom Kippur war did against
the Israelis for anyone else dirtside to try it.  In the movie, IIRC, they
said the aliens hit NATO bases first and presumably the aliens in ID4 had been
studying Earth for years.  Like in Niven & Pournelle\'s "Footfall,"  the US
would probably appear to be far more advanced than any other, at least from
space.  Industrialized, regular space launches, huge urban centers, sky
seething with aircraft and all kinds of EM noise (radio, tv, etc).

> The first crusade "liberated" Jerusalem just after the Christian Arabs

Jerusalem hadn\'t been ruled by Christians since it was lost to the Caliph Omar
in 638 and during the First Crusade was in the hands of the Muslim Egyptians.
Pilgrimage to the East had been made very hazardous by the weakened state of
the Byzantine Empire, the activities of the Turks in Anatolia, piracy on the
seas, and notable westerners were being forbade entry into Jerusalem by the
(Muslim) authorities (though probably due to the chaos of the region by the
Egyptian/Turk conflict).  It changed hands between the Turks and Egyptians a
couple times before the First Crusade took it from the Egyptian Govenor
Iftikhar in 1099.

> The fourth crusade sacked Constantinople, centre of the Greek Orthodox
> church to "protect it" from the Turks.

Well there was a Byznatine claimaint to the throne who had rashly promised
more money than he could give to the westerners.  The Venetians had been out
for that end sicne the beginning.  The Byzantine Empire had been decaying
severely since the reign of the Emperor Manuel.  It\'s notable that the
*entire* Crusade was excommunicated, though this was lifted against all but
the leaders (and eventually all except the Venetians).

> I don\'t feel that these points should be seen as church bashing, they

Yup.  Even aside from the Italian city-states, there were a good proportion of
adventures on the make who tagged along.  Younger sons and the like who had
nothing to inheret in Europe.  Also were a good amount of the pious.  The
proportions vary according to what accounts you read.  The most successful
turned out to be the adventurers, at least by the title and territory count.

Yeah.  If the medieval Crusades are a model on this, then Huscarles would be
big w/ this, too, maybe even the mainstay of the Imperial Navy, if you don\'t
want a Star Wars\'esque type Imperium.  Maybe that\'s what composes the Imperial
Navy.  Probably contrary to canon, but what the hey. ;-)

Course, what are these fleets doing in 1100?

Until, like w/ the Crusades to the Levant, the nobles beging losing interest.
The French nobility always wavered between supporting the \'western arm\' (Spain
and the Reconquista) vs the eastern, with the ebb and flow of success in each
theatre.
After awhile, the entire Crusading spirit becomes dulled and then non
existant, due to numerous "false Crusades" against Heretics or to settle
domestic disputes.

lol.  That sounds funny.  It was meant to be right?  The HIE has beef imports
on the top of his list? ;-)

> The result of all this?

Now that sounds interesting. :-)  Course, imagine what happens when the
weakness turns out to be from within (one of the Archukes... say from Ilelish)
and not from without.  That results in a 14 year civil war (aka Rebellion) of
nearly a dozen factions that results in a dangerous AI uncontrollable
superweapon being released, which paves the way for adventure and politics ala
post-Rome Europe...

Hmmm, do the great apes really have a baculum (aka os penis, aka
penile bone)? I thought that they didn\'t. I\'ll check in my primates
book.

You should see the cast I got my wife (she\'s a urologist, not a

I seem to vaguely remember that movie, or one like it, from my

oil fired carriers participating (usually the JFK, though with all the

these same politicians who don\'t want nuclear powerplants, never stopped to

Yep - an unattended anti-tank guided weapon with a passive

being developed now.

Ok, a turbine doesn\'t roar as loud as a diesel. But the characteristic

Challenger II certainly doesn\'t use a turbine - it\'s got a Perkins
Diesel plant. I\'m pretty certain that the Leo II is a diesel; no idea
about the French effort.

MPAT - Multipurpose Antitank. A follow on to the HEAT round, it combines
a subcaliber HEAT round with a sabot with a dual mode fuse, set at the
time of loading. The fuse is either contact, for anti-vehicle or troop
use; or proximity, for anti-air use. 

FS: I think that you\'re either going to end up with a very very small
fuse (and effective radius) for the round; or your handgun will be in
84mm calibre.

I think the nastiest baddie I have seen for Traveller appeared in an early
issue of the Journal.  The Reticulan Parasite...aka the Alien from Alien.
Nasty SOB...Natural armor of Battledress...

In the MT adventure by Charles Gannon (Challange 54) there was a mean 
mother The plot is played out on Ixion (C6A1234-9) and has all the 
right elements, freezing nights, CO2 mists at dawn, an abandoned 
research facility etc... The beast was simply called the Creature and 
looks something like a small dinosaur with a lobster head.

Most people have probably read it but

s
p
o
i
l
e
r

The monster is a 400 kg Carnivore/Killer with 10cm teeth and 15 cm 
claws. The nasty thing about this beast is not only that it is very 
aggressive but also has enough intelligence to readily grasp abstract 
concepts (i.e. green light - safe, red light - danger, or this shotgun 
hurts - break it). This intelligence is geared towards killing things. 
To further make the beast more formidable it can teleport and make it\'s 
victims sleepy. It has very acute hearing and smell but bad eyesight 
(due to the bad visual conditions on the planet it is actually 
short-sighted)

Ohh and of course it lays eggs in dead bodies with the help of its tail 
mounted stinger (now if he\'d been a B52 this would have been a M61 
Vulcan :) now that\'s a monster). The adventure comes with 3 sets of 
brawns that are used to show the PC:s how dangerous the situation is. 
Exactly my kind of adventure...

My players were literary scared shitless. The adventure is a mix of a 
detective story (who/what/how killed the scientist) and fastpaced 
action. My players got their first look of the monster via an 
jury-rigged surveillance system from their vehicle battery, some TV:s 
and three video cameras. This was after they lost one of the NPC:s and 
the APC they arrived in. 

They then thought they had it cornered in the kitchen so all but two of 
the not so heavily armed (shotguns, pistols) characters chased after it.  
When they arrived the kitchen was empty. At one time they seriously 
belived that the beast used the _plumbing_ to move around. That was when 
they heard the screaming and gunfire from where they had left the rest 
(1 PC , 1 NPC). It took two more dead NPC and 2 hurt PC:s (one 
seriously) to hunt it down.

Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, chimpanzees 24.]

The chromosome number problem isn\'t insuperable.  Przewalski\'s wild horse
has 66, domestic horses have 64, but they can breed.  But there are also the
nine inversions.  One of these would just reduce interfertility. Ten
mutations seems like a lot to overcome.

 Ian A. York  wrote the following in 1996:

Horses and donkeys have different numbers of chromosomes - 64 and 62
respectively - but they hybridize readily to produce mules, with 63
chromosomes.  Mules are, of course, legendary for being sterile; but there
is nothing you can count on any more in this wicked world, and there are two
documented cases of fertile horse X donkey hybrids:

  Rong R.  Chandley AC.  Song J.  McBeath S.  Tan PP.  Bai Q.  Speed RM.
  A fertile mule and hinny in China.
  Cytogenetics & Cell Genetics.  47(3):134-9, 1988.

     "Anecdotal reports of fertility in female mules (jack donkey x mare)
and hinnies (stallion x jenny donkey) have appeared in the literature over
the years, but scientists have generally regarded them with scepticism. The
fact that some of these hybrids can come into estrous and ovulate makes
fertility conceivable, given that opportunity for mating arises. In China,
where mules are bred extensively for work on the farms, a fertile female
mule and a fertile female hinny have now been verified by chromosomal
investigation. Each had mated with a donkey and produced a filly foal. The
foals show unique hybrid karyotypes different from the mule\'s or hinny\'s and
different from each other\'s. The studies make it clear that mule and hinny
fertility, at least for the female hybrid, is a real possibility."

	I believe all of this has actually been corrected. I originally read
the story in Analog, and my paperback book had an introduction
listing all the things NASA has corrected--Airworthiness Certificate
(IIRC, in the "Experimental" category), crew papers, radio licenses
... and a rope ladder to get out of *and* back into the shuttle.

	Unfortunately, I can\'t verify any of this ... my copy is in some
storage warehouse in Alexandria somewhere.

    'body' => 'There has been some discussion on the playtest list for \'G:T First In\'
(which looks very good - kudos to Jon Zeigler) about the difference
between knowledge tech levels and achievement tech.

Specifically, given sufficient knowledge, what advances can you utilise
at low tech levels ?

In the discussion below, I assume that the TL tables given in the books
are typical development sequences for *isolated worlds*, but an index of
industrial capacity for *any world* (so Stone Age [0] - Medieval [1] -
Renaissance [2] - Industrial Revolution [3]).

I shall concentrate on medical tech, since I have some expertise in this
area.

* Tech Level 0 :
- - Clinical medicine : history and physical examination!
- - Dietary measures and exercise as important preventative medicine.
- - First Aid techniques.
- - Simple antisepsis : hot water and soap, washing of hands and
instruments. Good enough for wound dressings, superficial procedures
(lancing, piercing, trephining) and simple obstetric procedures
(delivery +/- forceps, curettage).
- - Local anaesthesia : use of cocaine or equivalent.
- - Analgesia : use of poppy alkaloids, willow bark (aspirin) or
equivalent.
- - Pharmaceuticals prepared by grinding and drying, or ageing in pots or
gourds (e.g. curare).
Administration : oral, topical, subcutaneous, intramuscular (\'poison
darts\', anyone?).
- - Vaccination (if there is a local virus etc. similar to cowpox-smallpox
in crossover immunogenicity).
  
* Tech Level 1 : 
- - Development of pottery and glassmaking enables distillation and other
\'wet chemistry\' techniques.
- - Brewing technology enables the synthesis of antibiotics (but first
find your fungus).

Yields are poor until the development of \'pressure cooker\' type boilers,
which also permit scrupulous antisepsis (i.e. autoclaving instruments,
pyrogen free intravenous fluids).

- - The synthesis of ether is possible, enabling general anaesthesia.
- - Completion of the \'anaesthetic triad\' : anaesthesia, analgesia, and
muscular paralysis (curare is TL 0) is therefore possible, but requires
airway protection (endotracheal tubes) and some sort of breathing
circuit. ?rubber tubing ?bladders - or, at a stretch, plastics, with
access to crude oil or coal and a fractionation column.....

Access to pure oxygen is desirable but not essential. If this was a firm
requirement, the minimum tech level required is that to distill and
bottle gases (about TL 3-4).

- - Vascular catherisation is possible with sufficiently advanced
glassmaking skills ; drawing metal into wires or thin hollow tubes is
Tech Level 2.

Given sufficiently advanced anaesthesia, *any* surgery is *possible*,
but may not be practical e.g. joint replacements or other prosthetics,
and organ transplantation. (Cardiac surgery was very interesting prior
to the development of heart-lung machines!)

- - Surgical instruments that could be constructed would be familiar to
any TL 8 surgeon : blades, forceps, retractors, etc. These are low grade
steel or iron and have a short lifespan (rust!?)

- - Blood grouping certainly possible, as is other serology (e.g. viral
titres). Storing sera (for grouping purposes) and blood is a real
problem without reliable refrigeration.
Whole blood is typically donated and transfused on the spot.

- - Most diagnostic blood work could be done, but results would not be
available in a timely fashion (several hours to process a specimen).
Radioimmunoassays for hormones require TL 4-5 (need at least a
cyclotron). 

* Tech Level 2 :
- - Hypodermic needles (dependent on wire-drawing) ; large bore guide
wires for invasive vascular access.
- - Better metallurgy - longer lived instruments.
- - \'Pressure cookers\' - autoclaves and deep culture apparatus.

Comments and constructive criticism welcome.

Well, that depends on how much YTU uses the Major/Minor race thing.  And
this can vary from sector to sector.  But it is lurking in the shadows of

The bloodlines (at least Solomani & Vilani, though it\'s safe to toss in a
few of the other MHRs, too, IMO) are supposed to have become so mixed in the
time during and since the Rule of Man that the differences
were largely cultural.


True, but I don\'t recall this being mentioned for MHRs, except maybe Syleans
in M:0.  And Geonee at least are culturally and genetically distinct.  Just
what Minor means to them is a question, especially if you take Carlos
Ferrers most excellent websource as neo-canonalistic.  They don\'t seem to
suffer too much, at least while in Massilia.

The only other MHRs I have any material on are the Florians and Halkans in
the Trojan Reach issue of the Digest.  I think both are seriously flawed as
presented and so will not cite them as canon.

However, since there are still other MHR within the Imperium, and they are
still considered Minor, that  alone should be enough to make some
assumptions.  There are still significant numbers of genetically pure MHRs
to still be considered separate branches of humaniti.  They stayed \'pure\'
during the last thousand years either because they wanted to (Geonee) or
because they were somehow isolated.  Isolation could be read as racism, but
YMMV.

Why not?  If bacteria can exploit the humans, why not viruses?  Especially
something as primitive as a retrovirus.  IIRC something like AIDS is so
\'successful\' because of the high number of transcription errors it makes
when it reproduces.  It therefore has a very very high mutation rate and so
evolves incredibly fast.

Terrans get cross species virus infection because, among other reasons, we
live so close to animals.  While they couldn\'t eat them, don\'t Vilani have
domesticated animals too?  The only example I can think of is the Luugiir
(spl?), but they weren\'t domesticated until after they invented the jump so
they wouldn\'t count in this case.  Are their any domesticated animals native
to Vland?

Of course, a Vlandish virus would have to be able to handle Terran DNA, so
that could be a big stumbling block there.  Since I\'m no microbiologist let
me know if this is totally off course.  Then again, since the Plague of
Duskir is canon...

Ah, to heck with it.  The Plague of Duskir had to be a bioweapon used by the
soulless UN/Confederation.  Only Hiroshi had the morality to stand up to
corrupt and cynical Secretariat.

That doesn\'t hold up for MHR that started out with the fledgling Imperium,
like the Syleans or Answerin.  They should have been almost as numerous in
colonizing new worlds as the Vilani and Solomani and so should be a large
part of the general population today.

Blocks to this would have been racism at the start of the Imperium.  Not
unlikely given the Zhunastu School, in fact it might have made that form of
recontact more \'palatable\'.  It would be easier to treat sophonts,
especially other humans, the way the School instructed if you thought of
them as \'less than\' you.  Low numbers today would have been the result in
few/no colonies a thousand years ago.

Also, the low numbers could also mean \'genetically pure\' examples.  Syleans
and Answerin could have been interbreeding with Vilani and Solomani since
the start, and so your average modern Imperial could trace their ancestry
back to them.  The reason MHR are restricted is more that they have isolated
themselves, and less institutional racism.  Carlos Ferrers\' Geonee seem to
be a prime example of this.

That doesn\'t mean the Geonee aren\'t subject to racism, just that they aren\'t
helping matters any through their actions.

There are in fact low numbers of genetically pure Solomani in the Imperium,
but they aren\'t subject to Major/Minor racism.  Which on the surface doesn\'t
make sense given the hostility of the Imperium to the Confederation.  If you
can point at someone and say \'he\'s a Solomani\' you can point at a
\'potential\' threat.  So you (or at least I) can assume you can\'t point out a
genetically pure Solomani.  The mixed Imperial humaniti would resemble them
too closely.  There is a picture in G:T of a Vilani, Solomani and Zhodani.
Vilani and Solomani look suspiciously like they stepped off an Austin, TX
streetcorner.  You can\'t tell them apart without the name tags.

To sum up, it appears that institutional racism has effected MHRs at least
since the days of Cleon I.  Maybe not so malignant in the 1100s, but I\'d say
its still there.  BEMs, on the other hand, are pretty clearly victims of
racism.

I\'m curious. Has an experienced skydiver ever joined the paratroops and
kept it secret until *after* his first jump? I\'m assuming (given human
nature) he\'d pull *some* sort of weird stunt on said "first" jump. 

Now picture this with regards to jump troops. :-)

A friend tells of being in the Army and running into the (then rare)
two-story barracks. Different companies on each floor. Made for lots of
rivalry. Supposedly the nastiest it got was the night that they made up
a batch of nitrogen iodide and spread it on the (outside!) stairs from
the second floor just after lights out. 

After giving it ample time to dry, someone tripped the fire alarm. 

Here come all these barefoor grunts onto the stairs. The layer of
nitrogen iodide was thin enough that it didn\'t hurt anyone when it
exploded. But between the startle factor and the gas "cushion"
generated, he said a lot of them went down the stairs on their asses
rather than their feet!

NB: I am *not* condoning this sort of thing. But I\'m willing to bet
someone will try something equally stupid in the future.

If you\'re willing to ignore the "non-human" stipulation in the original
request, then I would have to say that the nastiest "monster" a group of
PCs can ever face is...another group of PCs.  Savagely bloodthirsty,
hideously well-armed, and possessed of a certain low cunning.  (Just
like the first group of PCs.)

Sounds slightly similar to a situation in one of EE \'Doc\' Smith\'s "Lensman"

I\'ve read a short story about a group of humans being captured by aliens
and put in a zoo. They tried their best to make the aliens understand that
they were intelligent and not mere beasts: drawing the geometric stuff
about pythagoras theorem etc etc. If I remember correctly however some of
them gave up after a while and started living in the "cage". After a while
they found a cute little animal that they captured and held as a pet. This
of course made their captors realise that they were intelligent: Only
intelligent animals hold other animals captured just for fun.

This is probably an Army legend, but I\'ve always heard tales of the kid who
learned to jump as a teenager joining the Army, go to Airborne School, and
on his fifth (and final) jump in the school flaring in for a perfect
standing landing.  He was immediately bounced from the class for "failure
to perform a proper Parachute Landing Fall."

Pulling stunts in an Airborne unit is a good way to find yourself walking
for a living.

"Village of the Damned." Excellent scene, btw. They do not do movies 
like that anymore... sigh!

ObTrav: If the Zhos mind probe the prisoner, will he really see the

I should read al the accumulated Digest before answering. Sigh.
Anyway, the plot you describe is that of "Village of the Damned." 
There was a movie called "Children of the Damned," which was actually 
a second part. Have both in a videotape <grin> Thanks God for TNT 
Classic Movies...

IIRC, it is stated somewhere in the original Alien modules that the 
Solomani-Vilani number 50% of the humans in the 3I, with the rest 
coming from MHR. Maybe in Alien Module n: Solomani.

	Part of the idea, yes. Although there are other factors, lkike the 
fact that a large Geonee population implies a large Chirper 
population... after the 800, there is an added factor: some 
practices bordering Psionics (like "the calling") are implicit in 
Geonee society. Other customs may restrict other races. E.g., the 
Suerrat seem to be quite arboreal. Anything which limits 
adaptability, limits also the spread of a race.
 
	Also, remember that the Geonee do not consider themselves humans. 
They *are* the Old Ones, and all those pesky races, the Vilani, the 
Solomani, etc, they are just Children. Humans, you know. The very 
idea of doing *anbything* to be accepted by the human\'s society is 
Alien to the Geonee mindset.

...and humans are victims of racism outside the Imperium, for that 
matter. Or even inside. Try accessing the Ancients Research Libraries 
in Shiwonee with a Solomani character. For that matter, try talking 
in Galanglic in Shiwonee ;->

I rather liked the one where the Terran ambassador was a bit upset with
his wife for effectively *raping* him in front of an alien delegation
(who all figure it\'s just more of that odd primate behavior).

Then at end we find out that a couple of the alien delegation have been
just as "naughty", and went equally unnoticed by the humans!

In the original pilot (and in the episode created from it) the slave

Ok, for starters, see if you can find a "natural foods" type outlet
that sells textured Vegetable Protien (TVP). This is a soy based meat
substitute. What you want are the chunk "beef" type. It\'ll look like
petrified dog kibble. If you\'ve got strong teeth you can eat it as is.
It\'s normally soaked in water before adding it to a dish. 

Offer them some of their "rations" as a snack to get them in the mood.

Some of the indgnities to be expected are loss of clothing, as well as
"flea dip" type baths. Also, they should expect to be identified in one
of a number of ways. Possibly a *large* tattoo. Or a metal tag fastened
onto a handy flap of skin (ears, lips, and then we get *really* painful
and embarassing). There are also large plastic tags used for marking
livestock. They require a hole about the diameter of a pencil!

If the scientists are interested in *breeding* these strange animals,
it gets worse. The standard means of collecting a sperm sample in a
hurry amounts to restraining the creature, and sticking a modified
cattle prod up their ass until it\'s against the prostate. You then
switch it on, off, on in 10-30 second pulses. This *will* expel all the
sperm the critter has on hand. 

It\'s been used to get sperm for artificial insemination from
paraplegics. Even *they* hate it. According to someone involved in
developing the version used on people, it\'d be more pleasant to get hit
with a sledge hammer. 

And if there are enough victims... err... characters on hand, the most
troublesome may get scheduled for vivisection so as to enable medical
treatment of the others...

Read David Gerrold\'s "War Against the Chtorr" books for a sample of
what it might be like for humanity to be on the losing end of a fight
for ecological niches on earth. 

It\'s nowhere near finished (and it may never get finished) so the issue
is very much in doubt. And frankly, given the way he\'s set things up,
I\'m not sure that humanity *can* win.

Even if they aren\'t tool users, and given the first two movies (all
I\'ve seen) there\'s not much evidence one way or the other, they\'d still
be bad news.

Consider that they would *devastate* any ecology they got dropped into.
That alone could be the end. 

Of course, the Chtorr are worse. Being on the wrong end of a
"terraforming" project is not good. Especially when all the evidence
points towards the new ecosystem being one that\'s far *older* than
Earth\'s. In the sense of having had a billion or so more years
experience at coming out on top.

And read the *book*. The movie took extreme liberties with the plot and
background. For one thing, in the book, it wasn\'t a city, it was the
entire *world*. And the color changes weren\'t 10, 20, 30 years. They
were 7, 14, and 21 years! Yep. You became "adult" at 14 and died at 21.

The *original* was a book by John Wyndham titled "The Midwich Cuckoos".
The name is a reference to the habit of cuckoos of laying their eggs in
the nests of other birds.

You close your eyes before you press the trip.

I used to use the old "Magicube" flash cubes as "grenades" during
nighttime capture the flag games in Boy Scouts. They are *mechanically*
triggered. There\'s a spring arm "cocked" and held in place by a very
short post. There\'s slot in the case under it. push something thru the
slot, and the arm gets pushed above the stop. It then snaps forward
against what amounts to an underpowered percussion cap on the base of
the bulb.

Sure, it gave away my position to use it. But anybody looking my way at
the time was out of action until they got their night vision back. :-)
I used to "close your eyes" bit and never had any trouble.

I\'m sure that Admiral Gallery would be surprised to hear this.

The US captured a U-boat *intact*. It\'s still on display at the Chicago
Museum of Science and Industry. But Admiral (then Lieutant?) Gallery
led the boarding party that closed the seacocks and turned off the
destruct charges. 

I think the British incident you are thinking of involved getting a set
of the new *keys*. The folks at Bletchley Park had pretty much reverse
engineered the Enigma without much help from either of these exploits.

Uhmm, the first Enigma machine was captured in Czechoslovakia in either
1938 or 1939 (my memory is a little vague at the moment). I\'m fairly sure
it occured before September 1939. It was then handed over to the British
who duely passed on the information to the US. I think what was captured in
the U-boats was Ultra, the system the Germans had as the backup in case
Enigma was cracked. Enigma itself was a fairly simple device to decypher
once you had a machine, getting the new cypher wheels was just a matter
of number crunching (albeit massive number crunching).

There would be the (temporary) capture of U110 by HMS Bulldog in May 1941
off the Irish coast, which yielded not only cipher tables but a functioning
Enigma machine.  The sub sank under tow.

There was an even more dramatic incident in which a British boarding party
from HMS Petard went aboard the sinking U-559 in the Med in September 1942
with the intention of capturing both code books and cipher machines.  I
know they got codes, and I think another Enigma machine as well.  Two of
the boarders lost their lives when the sub sank with them still aboard.

As you say, in all of these cases (and the ambush and capture of the
weather trawlers), the key books were the most valuable captures.  However,
having physical copies of the machines helped to codebreaker s a good deal,
even after they knew how it worked.  Getting new rotor configurations was
the most valuable benefits, but there were occasionally changes made to the
machine itself which slowed the decryption process.

Thanks for your corrections.

My source was Terry Jones (of Monty Python fame) and a series he
did for the BBC. So I could be wrong on some details...

;-)

I\'m a bit better read for French medieval history, but I still wouldn\'t
care to use the word "studied".

You guessed my intent correctly. :-)

Depends if the HIE\'s best friend noble on the K\'Kree border controls lots
of Ag worlds. :-)

I was actually thinking along the line of the Opium Wars between UK and
China last century, where they (the Chinese) had banned one of our few
exports for which there was actually a market in China.

But the parallel with the BSE Beef ban and our previous prime minister
trying to get it lifted did appeal.

Also when trying to find trade goods worth shipping around the stars,
foods that for whatever reason cannot be grown well in space farms
or on unsuitable planets might form a significant part.

Think of the value of coffee trade, or the looming "bannana war".

Paralleling Medieval French History does lead to the problems France had
with all its borders (the English, Swiss, Italians, Flemmish) its war
with Spain and finally Religious Civil War.

(Un)fortunately the parallel breaksdown because France didn\'t breakup. 8-S

OK, you asked for it.

There is another animal species which looks vaguely similar to humans 
to these aliens. Like that animal in Kuzu. Only that it is repulsive, 
a giant gorilla-like critter.

And the aliens wonder if the human are a subspecies, so they decide 
to check if the humans and that critter are interfertile.... 
cheap methods, just spill feromones of the critter over the humans 
and put them in the critters cage.

Now that I stop to think about it, half the sector where my players 
are is inexplored...

You can make reliable air conditining, at GTL 0, with cloth netting and a
water supply. Also you can design and implement Air Con in GTL 0 buildings,
with a water supply. Not relaible refrigeration though.

As long as you can make metal canisters (GTL 1 ?) that can contain liquid
gases (Oxygen, Nitrogen etc) you can have reliable refriguration. The process
of getting liquid gasses is one were use us evaboration to lower the temp of
one gas to liquid, use that to lower the next gas to liquid, all the way down
to about 10 Kelvin. If you can do this then you can have reliable refrigeration.

And read the *book*. The movie took extreme liberties with the plot and
background. For one thing, in the book, it wasn\'t a city, it was the

One thing I enjoyed about the book was the way the author subtly (and
not-so-subtly) showed the stagnation of society now that there were no
elders. There were unfinished projects everywhere (like the flame-crystal
sculpture of the burning of Washington DC - the artist reached age 21,
and took the secret of flame-crystal with him to the grave). Technical
items had simplistic names, indicating to me that the people were losing
understanding of their tools. The Sandman didn\'t use a snub pistol or
dart launcher, he used a Gun. The New-You Clinic didn\'t have an autodoc
or a cybernetic surgery unit, it had a Table. Arcade, Stick...the list goes
on.

I always considered the "Vampire Freaks" to be the guys who wanted to 
roleplay one...

When I grew up, vampires were the BAD GUYS! maybe we do live in a more 
"kinder, gentler" world...

As a referee for a PBEM game, I cannot help to to find the above highly 
amusing.

On a side note, I allow the players to tell me what they rolled if it is 
a minor plot item, but for serious stuff, i handle it. I got a cute 
little die roller from some Trav site that can give me what I need for 
an instant roll, so I can reply to the email without fishing for the

I\'ve pulled a similar stunt on several ocassions.  The time it worked best
(as far as role playing goes) was in and AD&D game.  The players were an all
good group of mostly CGs.  Very little party unity and a great deal of inter
party compitition for loot.  The group was mostly levels 9 and 10 on your
basic dungen crawl.  I threw into the mix an equal sized group of level 7/8
lawfull evils with the same mix of character classes BUT the LEs where
operating in cooperation and using well prepared and trained combat
techniques.  The use \'room clearence\' methods, infiltrate and exfiltrate
procedures, scouting and base security proceedures and the concept of never
giving a sucker and even break.  The PCs were running for their lives after
the first two scermishes.  (The LEs retreated in good order under cover of
spells and missle fire in the first encounter when they lost the iniative
only to ambush the PC when they left the dugeon to rest and recover.)  The
\'Dungeon Hunters\' became a reoccuring enemy that the PC just could not seem
to completely defeat.  The PCs often found dead monsters and looted chests
if they were just a little to slow following up on a lead.  They learned to
NEVER leave their goods or base camp ungaurded and to CYA at all times.

Yes, and what a gun, it was a six-shooter, with each chamber carrying a
different load, IIRC.  Such as "Tangler", "Ripper", etc.

I have recently "fallen in love" with classic traveller again as well. 
I\'ve been trying to rebuild my old collection of books from long ago.

You know, from a referee\'s perspective, MT had the best system of just 
about any I\'ve worked with. It was quick, and the players knew just how 
it worked with just a little bit of instruction.
I kinds wish T5 would consider it again...

A group of 36 Ancient psionic Droyne warriors with Ancient 
armor/weapons, trained to act as an integrated unit,
who wake up under fire to find their own base infiltrated
and under assault with no "friendlies" in the area.

All run by a GM who is intimately familiar with the
Traveller psi rules and special ops tactics and had
3 months to study the area of engagement.

The adventure was "Twilight\'s Peak" by Marc Miller. The
GM was an ex-Marine recon-type.

A few notes...

I recently purchased a bunch of T:TNE minis from my friend Mike at Dragon\'s
Trove. Interesting to note was that several of the RAFM ship minis have been
repackaged and are appearing under similar class names in the Mekton line of
minis. 

I don\'t know how old the Mekton minis are, but the ships are exactly
identical! I\'ve spotted the traders as well as the "butt ugly" scout ship that
you all know and love among the Mekton minis that I bought.

I now have all of the RAFM ships, several copies of each. Pirate encounters
anyone?

I also have been searching for--without too much success--the Martian Metals
figures. I\'ve got some dupes (mostly the K\'kree), but some packs are utterly
impossible to find: the various adventurers, the Striker sets, etc.

A little easier to find was the Laserburn line. In fact, I\'ve probably got
(including dupes) about 20 or so packs. Does anybody know if these are still
being made by anybody! If I can\'t find the Martians, I might as well get the
unofficial equals!

Thanks!

Well, you mean aside from tearing apart the Enigma that the Poles got to
Bletchley in about \'39 or so?

They used the U-Boat data to break the Naval Enigma (Shark?). They had
reverse engineered the Enigma before that, but needed some repetition to
decode IIRC. There\'s a new book on the code breaking out called \'Station
X\'. I have it (and watched the UK Channel 4 series) but haven\'t had a
chance to read it yet.

Bletchley park did some amazing things, including the first true computer.
But they weren\'t allowed to reveal it and Churchill ordered the destruction
of the Bombs and the records to conceal the expertise.

Boy that\'s hard to pick! Let\'s see, there were the four-dimensional

the evil mind-controlling flowers of the planet Shimmer which enslaved
people until they died of exhaustion.  Oh, and let\'s not forget the
neurophagic Von Neumann nanomachine plague (ya, that was NASTY!). 
Actually, these are all pretty non-standard, I think the original poster
was looking for "animals", so I think my worst was probably a
genetically-engineered species of regenerating crystalline spiders with a
thick diamond coating for armor and the ability to generate laser blasts

Clif, his posting style and behavior.  Replies have trickled down to near 
nothing now.

While a few people specifically asked for his removal, a majority felt that 
he really hadn\'t done anything to warrant removal or if he were to be 
removed, those two or three "Anti-Clif" people should also be removed 
because their postings are as disruptive and harmful, if not more than Clif\'s.

Since I haven\'t seen a lot of Clif\'s behavior that of late warrants 
removal, I\'m not going to do for it.  I would still like to hear Clif\'s 
opinion on the matter.

Based on comments made,  I have the following statements that I want to 
make to the list on the matter:

1.  You don\'t have to reply to every message.  Several people feel that 
Clif replies to every message even when replies are not warranted.  This 
may be true.  He seems to have a high number of short messages.   You need 
to reply if you have something to add, but don\'t feel that you have to say 
something.  "Me Toos" or "Last Words" cause threads to ramble 
endlessly.   A better course of action is to read all the messages of a 
thread, then reply to the one that most intrigues you, then add in your 
comments that you want to make to the other posts.  This will make each 
post more meaningful and we will have less short bursts.

2.  If someone on the list\'s general behavior is something you don\'t like, 
ignore it, kill it or filter it.  Most people who responded felt that Clif 
does add to the common good, though not all the time.  I\'m sure that others 
may not like you and may file 13 your messages before they read them and 
I\'m sure you do that to others.  I\'m only going to step in on harsh 
language, real threats,  or someone who is blatantly flame baiting 
someone.  Clif is borderline in these areas but hasn\'t pushed the threshold 
yet since coming back from his 30 days.

3.  Follow the "24 hour" rule.  If you get ticked off at someone, or if 
someone says something that really sets your hair of fire, step back, come 
back to the message tomorrow, re-read it when your emotions cool off, see 
if they were a) joking, b) saying the truth that you may not like to hear, 
or c) you just took it wrong.  Then if you need to reply.  I promise, that 
things will work out better.  I got this advice once from a boss and it 
really works, honest!!!!

4.  Everyone needs to keep on topic.  If you see an off topic post, or if 
an on topic thread heads off topic, stop replying.  As long as people post 
on a topic that thread will live.  So if the Religion of the Zhodani turns 
into the Religion of the Solomani, which turns into the Religion of the 
Roman Empire, which leads to the Protestant/Catholic fighting in Ireland, 
then you have gone off topic and it should stop.

I understand that we draw analogies with things we know (real world) to 
help us understand the fantasy world, and its fine as long as we don\'t go 
discussing the real world issues in a real world context.

5.  We need to remember that the Internet is a growing entity.  Computers 
are reaching into homes and work places where people are struggling to 
learn what a computer is.  Using an analogy, that may get me flamed, 
consider that the Internet was once a club for PhD holding Astrophysicists 
at a university.  Now freshmen and even high schoolers can join the 
club.  The maturity level is lowering.  A more diverse cultural and social 
world is becoming wired.  The Internet is available to those who can\'t 
coherently write a letter.

Instead of blowing a stack because someone is writing from a level (be it 
social, maturity, educational, or cultural) that is different that your 
own, you have to learn to accept them and either ignore them, help them, or 
try to see the topic from their point of view.  Those of us old timers are 
just going to have to modify our behavior to compromise with those who 
don\'t understand what their behavior needs to be.

If everyone can take a minute to digest all this, and then step back and 
look at your own postings and say "Am I doing the right thing?" then this 
list will evolve to a much better haven.

In summary:  Clif, you need to post less frequent, more meaningful and 
thought out Traveller oriented messages, following 
net-etiquette.  Anti-Clif\' people either filter him or accept him.  If you 
reach in the middle, you will find that things work well.

Bacteria can utilize chemicals common to all living organisms
(amino acids, or even just reduced carbon).  Viruses have
to be able to slip your genome.  You can\'t catch a virus from
most of the species in your own biosphere, let alone form
a species in another biosphere.

And because they are so closly related to them.  If you look at
a genomic tree of the biosphere, that monkey or chicken you catch
something from are close cousins.

Animals from a completely different genetic root.

That is indeed the big block...

The plague is reasonable if it is viral (the Vilani resistance to
viruses has faded).  If it is bacterial, then it doesn\'t make
much sense.

Yeah; but even Heinlein admits it\'s a barebones TOE with very little support
staff. I guess for shipboard use this is OK (the service section supports
them?), but for ground use; I would use AT LEAST the striker campaign rules
(they add mechanics, trransport, medical staff, supplies).

Ob Trav: let the PC\'s blow all their money on shiny toys; then let them have
it when they break down for lack of maintanence and spare parts, let them go
hungry when they run out of food, let them die for lack of medical care, let
them run out of ammo, etc. The pros DO still study logisitics I presume? Help
me out here Gary, and Doug, etc...

Captain Gallery commanding a jeep carrier with 3? destroyers as
escorts.  He wa in command but did not enter the sub until it was safely
in tow.  Also it his idea to capture the sub, orders were to sink any
sub seen.

The catch: we were several systems away, had never heard of him, or all

seven years.

Easy, right? ;-)

Well, we were involved in one murder aboard a starship in jump, one
exploding starship (fortunately _not_ in jump).

We now have an unknown enemy, who has tried to kill us, is likely the
one who killed Akus. 

Three other player-characters are in as minority partners, and one has
some stuff lined up to make us all rich if we if we don\'t all kill each
other first.

Oh yeah, one other thing, no one knows _where_ the ship is right now...

And we just found out some rich noble on the world we\'re at, in whose
courts the will has been probated, has taken an interest in us and has
volunteered to be the Court\'s Agent to make sure we actually meet the

The game started _realtime_, what a year ago?? and we have managed to

Hmm, I think that would be Tanaya Zintrani, the schizophrenic teleporting
ultra-vixen martial arts master Zhodani assasin chick extraordinaire.
Heavily cybered up, she managed to bypass (ie. kill, maim or at least
dismember) a whole crew of pirates and capture their leader (a PC) and his
spiritual advisor (another PC, a psionic preist type) for her mind-ripping
masters. It all culminated in a big duel between the two PCs (one handling
psi, the other hand-to-hand) and her.  It was a great fight, coming down
to a single die roll which come up box-cars for the PCs, which produced
wild cheers.

would consume it\'s next nearest meal. this lead to several strange

I saw a recent show about the incident.  The destruct charges were never

The sailor in charge of opening the seacocks didn\'t know that. He said that
he would have hidden/thrown over board the seacock covers if he had.
As it was, he threw them on the floor and they were easily found and

EACH OTHER.

If they aren\'t blundering into devestating situations with little or no
hope of escape, thay tend to be the biggest bunch of back stabbers I\'ve
ever seen! 

On at least one occation one PC offered the other members of his group
(3 other PCs) as sacrifices to an Aztec derived culture! He rapidly
extracted himself and waited until the others were at the point of being
spread eagle over stone alters with flint knives at their chests, before
showing up in the ship\'s boat and scaring the natives away. When the
others, who had totally been convinced he was going to desrt them, got
aboard, they beat him to a point where about every bone was in broke,
weeks in medical!

Luck for them I tend to be VERY easy as a ref. Sigh, players are sooooo
hard to find.

I think I might have to borrow her for MTU. Heh heh.

Probably the nastiest thing I\'ve thrown against my group, other than
FGMP-equipped battle-dressed troops (long story there) was a blatant
ripoff of the T1000 from Terminator 2. It was an LSP prototype that had
"escaped". Imagine the looks on their faces when they noticed that their
chief engineer, whom they were talking to, had a dead double around a
nearby corner.

Also imagine the looks on their faces the first time they did the
shotgun-to-the-head thing.

One of the PC\'s in a game I was in came from Efate. He decided to write a
song and release it during the 5FW. It was called "Born in the
M.A.R.I.N.E.S" (to the tune of "Born in the USA").

As I recall, the GM ruled that it was a Top 5 hit on Efate, but barely made
it into the Top 100 on the more cultured Regina...  ;-)

The second movie implies the Queens at least are low-level sentient
The Dark Horse comics imply some are much better than that.

BTW,  if anyone is going to be in New Zealand , specifically the
Wellington area, near the end of the year, we are doing a live action
Aliens game caled Aliens - Apocalypse , set on Earth after it has been
abandoned by most of humanity due to the Alien infestation about then.

There will be about 150-odd people involved, and the organizers
currently have all the buildings of a race course booked for the
event, and it will last some three days. Currently it\'s planned to do
some table-top
RPGing to set the scene, then a few smaller LARPs culminating in a
huge one wth everyone involved
Hopefully some PC\'s will survive to the final LARP....

It\'s actualy the third in a series of such events which have an
interlinked story, the second being Aliens - Velocity which at our
last con won the award for killing all the PC\'s the quickest. (The
pilot crashed the drop-ship with all the PC\'s on board)

>Consider that they would *devastate* any ecology they got dropped

>That alone could be the end.

Would they ?  They haven\'t been shown to affect anything other than
higher order animals, and the areas where they nest. Like Grendel\'s in
the second book, they may actively control their expansion once a
semi-sentient Queen is in charge.

In fact, they may not even be able to infest herbivores (though I\'d
find that a little strange)

Yaah, and I love the similarities between Chtorr and Starship Troopers

I always try to make sure that "my" Scout characters have at least one level
in Computer, Engineering, Electronics, Gravitics and Mechanic just in case
anything goes wrong.  Also, I always figured that weapons skills involve a
*very* basic knowledge of how to fix common faults, as well as the ability
to fieldstrip and rebuild the weapon.

Anybody else read "The Hunt For Red October"?  Didn\'t they tell the Russians
that he sank too?  (Info; the German and Russian navies refer to their ships
as males, whereas the Brits and the Yanks attribute them with female
characteristics.  Even the \'Old-Timer\' in The Starship Operator\'s Manual
used a "girlfriend" anology)

Didn\'t the original story for Alien 3, have the infected animal as an

About an hour and a half for those 6 players whose characters
stood and fought gloriously. *My* PC is alive and well, thank
you. He ducked and ended up trying to First Aid the only
surviving Droyne (poor thing was hurt so badly I just had to
put it out of its misery).

After all the noise was over, my PC, who was actually psionic
and had randomly rolled Oynprith as a language, looked around
and thought "My, what an interesting Ancient base I have".

Heheh. Took the GM for everything I could think of.

Just be polite to that laid-back groat rancher in the Fulacin
outback whom everyone at the starport says is an Imperial
knight.

The Donosev came out great.

I had looked at the tender at one point with a skeptical eye.  Traveller
starship numbers need to be looked at with an unfocussed eye, however, and
a few fudges are always standard.  Not enough to let "shattered ships" get
by.

The concept of the corsair (never pictured as far as I know) being able to
"swallow" a 100 ton ship in its clamshell bay doors always made me chuckle
too.     On top of that, the ship was supposedly of a variable geometry
that could imitate other ships.

Incidentially, are you taking submissions for other types of ships (i.e.
non Canon Traveller, but still traveller)?

If so, what do you need as a starting point?  I\'ve got a fair 800 ton
merchant that needs picturing, and a nice (IMO) 1200 tonner that I\'ve done
fairly detailed (hand) drawings.

Perhaps I\'ll just have to follow your tutorial...

Last I heard, Seeker had purchased the modls and what-not from Martian

with them you might be able to buy them (assuming that you can track down
the owner of Seeker).

42 pages long!
There hasn\'t been much activity on this thread in the last several
days, but I think it likely that everyone is pondering on their next
entries (like me).  The initial positions seem all present now, several
wanting the status quo, several wanting moderate changes, and several
radical changes.  Then there are several "foreign parties" who have
entered the fray.
I am hoping to get some time to add these to my site soon (as long as

	More weight will be emphasized on the MT timeline as well as the G:T
rules.
	This game will also be mainly ground-pounder based, all character types
are encouraged, but to know that the game is planetary based (so far)
gives a good starting point.
	There will be a supporting web site.

	Preferred rules system: Gurps Traveller with MT time line (circa 1117)

In CT special supplement 3, Missiles; one missile rack can hold three
missiles. In addition; the turret can hold another 12 missiles in it.
Additional missiles are stored in a magazine and have to be replenished, which
takes an entire game turn (CT game turn). Note another person can do this so
the gunner doesn\'t have to... Missiles weigh 55kg, (50 for the missile and 5
for the shipping container), and have a volume of one meter in length, and a
diameter of 15 cm (a cylinder).

Note that theses rules are pretty much the same for sand, even though the
supplement is about missiles. CT book two gives the sand canister a cost of
400 Cr. I would use the missile volume in SS3 for the canister volume as the
displacement weights for sand and missiles are the same (both weigh 50 kg.).
It also makes computing the volume needed for a magazine easier....Remember
that a displacement ton has a volume of 13.5 cubic meters (4x1.5 meter cubes).
I don\'\'t know how you are going to convert these measurements into SAE
measurements though (pounds and cubic feet) and the hexagons that GURPS uses
instead of squares like CT...

It is coming up on reprint time for Traveller, and a question has come up:

It has been suggested to me that the "word on the street" is that the first
edition had too many errata for many people to sink the extra bucks into a
hardback version, and that a second printing, with all the bugs stomped on,
would outsell the first print run.

My original notion was to do a limited edition of the HB and then run no
more, but if there is a large demand for a "fixed" HB...

Please send your answeres directly to me at

lkw@io.com

Mike, these are great!  Look\'s like you might be some competition

These would be great in an mpeg with sound of course, but 10 minutes
would probably be waay too long.  10 seconds with quality like this

This jump torpedo allows the Imperial Navy scouting elements to remainin
contact with a fleet main body without themselves travelling to the fleet\'s
location.

The torp is basically a jump drive with controls communications gear, and a
small computer attached.  It can follow a preprogrammed set of instructions
to reach a aparticular area of space at its destination world where it is
drained of data via commo gear, and picked up by a naval vessel for reuse.

Reliability of this unit is higher than with previous genertion jump torps,
but still not ideal.  Generally, one in 10 is lost either through misjump
or glitches in the approach at the destination system.  This makes the jump
torpedo less-than profitable for the Scout Service or other commercial
ventures except in certain special circumstances.  Standard operating
procedure is for a ship sending information by jump torp to send two such
torpedos to two seperate relay systems to ensure a high chance of delivery.

On board systems are capable of determining position, executing a jump,
signaling when a friendly IFF is detected, and plotting a course towards a
given destination.  Data on board is always protected by navy level
encryption schemes.

Design notes : 0.2 tons is about as good as I could get and still include a
computer (pitiful as it is, I decided that was all that was needed).  I
decided that since there was no onboard operator, there was a 3 in 12
chance of a misjump (which would otherwise be avoided by an engineer or
pilot on board).

I was able to build a .1 ton torp at jump 2 that had 8 days duration, which
I thought was not really enough.  Not wanting to split tenths of a ton, and
desiring more jump capability, I settled on the above design.

Incidentially, this design might be better with a non fusion power supply.
I didn\'t check.

Coming up: The Swiftsure Fleet Reconnaisance Cruiser which carries these.

How many of you, players or GMs, insist on having a guard on the ship?
Is that guard a PC?  What keeps that player from getting bored while
everyone else goes out and does something?

Personally, as GM I plan on reaching an agreement with the players
saying "Look, your ship has reasonable security precautions and if I
take your ship over it\'ll be for plot-relevant reasons."  This way,
you don\'t have someone effectively left out of the game (especially
since the PCs tend to decide that one of them would be better able to
guard the ship than your NPC).

It\'s a kludge, but makes the game more playable (and by not having
NPCs travel with the group in the long term, I can concentrate on the
NPCs whom they encounter).

My PC group went out and spent Cr100,000 for a complex security system on their
ship. The players and I coughed up a simple set of "if-then" rules I could use
to determine when alarms go off. That\'s pretty much taken care of their security
needs.

The Swiftsure is part of the layered scouting mission conducted by the
Fleet Reconnnaisance Arm of the Imperial Navy.  Each numbered fleet
generally conducts reconnaisance along any flank that is not covered by
another, adjacent fleet out to as much as 12 parsecs.  This vessel is at
the outer limit of that scouting footprint.  Doctrine dictates somewhat
heavier units closer to the fleet, available to back this unit up or
investigate its disappearance if necessary.

With it\'s high jump capacity, and large store of jump torpedos (standard
load is 100, using 20 tons of the available cargo), this ship will stay on
station on the extreme flank of a numbered fleet, acting as early warning
against an enemy\'s flank attack, or searching out the enemy fleet.

If elements of an enemy (or potential enemy) is detected, this ship\'s
mission is to remain in system, ready to run, and send intelligence back to
the main fleet on a frequent basis.  For that reason, this ship is
generally equipped with the best available stealthing technology, and
excellent sensors.  Weapons are concentrated on self-protection, although
battles between scouting elements of opposing fleets are not uncommon, and
can be very important to the outcome of a war.

These units rarely act alone because of the critical nature of their
mission, but generally one vessel will go "visible" and the other will
remain as stealthy as possible.

Another typical tactic; since a jumping vessel creates a detectable sensor
footprint, a jump torpedo may be dropped "dead" in a systems jump point and
activated via laser comm at some later time, loaded with information, and
sent off remotely.  This tactic prevents the recon cruiser from being
spotted in the vicinity of the distinctive "jump signature" created by the
torp.  This occasionally results in lost or abandoned torpedos.

Note that the term "cruiser" is used in place of the term "scout" to
prevent confusion with the Scout Service.

Design Notes;  There are two Gigs (20 tons) that can act as ship\'s boats
and as secondary sensor platforms as needed.

The concept for this vessel came out of the discussion of the "101st
Batron", and I just got around to putting it down.  The ship breaks the
rules for some people, although it is still quite useful in the same basic
role without jump torps.  In that capacity I would probably want a smaller
vessel though, since it has to make the trip back itself each time.  That
type would also need to be deployed in larger numbers for the same coverage.

In my own campaign a major numbered fleet is currently moving through
Aramis system, and this ship is stationed (among other places) At
Jesedipere, nine parsecs away, to keep an eye on the Vargr border.  In my
own conception there will be a line of destroyer class (1000-5000 ton)
ships in systems from 1 to 6 parsecs from the fleet\'s primary route of
travel and smaller vessels such as this one in systems from 7-12 parsecs
out.  Communication via jtorp is conducted with the farthest in ships you
can reach, and is always duplicated.

IMTU the Jtorp is realtively new, and does not break canon by virtue of
this fact and its not-really-justified reputation for unreliability.

<BEGIN EXTRACT OF POST FROM ANDY LILLY>

If anyone\'s interested, you can let them know that this is almost identical
to what BITS will be introducing to maintain consistency between Traveller
and GURPS Traveller for future 101 and adventure books! From memory, they
seem to have missed out Impossible tasks, which come before Hopeless?

In fact, so no one thinks we\'re stealing anything, I think we\'d better say
this - perhaps quoting part of the extract below? Naturally, should anyone
come up with a better idea I\'m open to suggestions.

Andy

EXTRACT FROM DRAFT (c)1998 Andrew S. Lilly. All Rights Reserved.

Rule Systems

MegaTraveller (MT), Traveller: The New Era (TNE) and Marc Miller\'s Traveller
(T4) all use a graduated system of task difficulty ratings, e.g. Easy,
Routine, Normal, Difficult, Formidable, Staggering, Impossible, Hopeless.
\'Classic\' Traveller (CT) nor GURPS Traveller (GT) both use modifiers to the
task rolls rather than specific difficulty ratings. To provide a common
ground for all these rule sets, this book uses the difficulty ratings listed
in the following table, where each rating has a corresponding task modifier
for CT and GT:

Table 1: Common Difficulty Ratings
Difficulty		CT Target	GT Target
		Modifier	Modifier
Easy		-4	+6
Routine		-2	+3
Normal		0	0
Difficult		+2	-3
Formidable	+4	-6
Staggering	+6	-9
Impossible		+8	-12
Hopeless		+10	-15

Example: Maria Charles is picking an electronic safe lock. The referee rules
the lock is particularly complex, making it a Staggering task. Maria has INT
10 and Lockpick-4 for all rule sets except GT, where her INT is 15 and she
has Lockpick-19.

CT: Maria would require 2D+Lockpick >= 8 to open a normal lock. However, this
lock requires 2D+Lockpick >= 14 (8+6). Alternatively, the referee may prefer
to apply the target modifier as a negative DM on the die roll, i.e. Maria
would require 2D-6+Lockpick >= 8.
...
T4: Maria would require INT+Lockpick >= 4D (Staggering).

GT: Maria would require Lockpick -9 >= 3D. Alternatively, the referee may
prefer to apply the target modifier as a negative DM on the die roll, i.e.
Maria would require Lockpick >= 3D+9.

The precise probabilities of success between the various rule sets will
vary, as these modifiers were chosen for playability and are intended only
as guidelines. Naturally, the referee should adjust the target numbers or
die rolls as appropriate to make the game enjoyable!

Not the way I read it.  However, I could see a "life-debt" as
forming the basis for a similarly close relationship between an
_Aslan_ and a human...

Whoa!  I\'ve been picking up most of it as well, and I\'m nowhere
near this.  Obviously, you\'re picking up side threads that I
either missed or dismissed.

That\'s definitely the case for both Gallatin and Dilgaadin;
there\'s also the added complication that both seem to have caught
a Terran virus that seems to cause minor respiratory distress,
minor aches (especially headaches), and general lethargy.

(Jeff\'s managed to catch a cold...)

Only one, to date - the Embassy staffer from the Zho embassy at
Capital.  Sam is a self-declared Imperial of Solomani descent.
The Vargr posting as Soegz is pretty conclusively an Imperial
Vargr supporter of Brzk, though I disagree with INI\'s evaluation
of it being Brzk himself.

I can tell you that Gallatin was somewhat incensed about the
"interference" in an Imperial policy debate represented by the
staffer\'s post; it took a while to calm him down.  Dilgaadin was
also annoyed, but there were no flames in the offing.

Go for it!  It\'ll eventually be going up on Freelance Traveller
as well, with the idea of using it to introduce a new section
(and hopefully a new series of \'policy debate\' threads, either
here or via a \'bbs/forum\' type thingy at FT).  Do please do me a
favor, and forward a copy to me, at my cyburban address, of what
you\'ve gathered, so that I can cross-check against what I have.

Darn it, Dom! I really like this idea. In fact I\'m writing a new
adventure now and planned on asking Eris if I could include it (
Hopefully to web publish when it\'s done and tested). Now I\'ll have to
pay BITS royalties too!

All that aside, I think the idea is a great addition to GURPS. I\'ve
played GURPS since the boxed set came out and think this simplifies the
process. I\'ll let you know how it works soon, since I plan to introduce
it when I get to run a game again (probably about a month), REAL WORLD

TO: Interested mercenaries and world governments.
FROM: His Majesty Eric Kane of Colchis II. (c/o Imperial Subsector 
Capital.)

In a recent uprising, rebel elements of our society took control of Colchis 
II.
Many members of our family were killed or imprisoned, leaving us as 
rightful
king of Colchis and head of Colchis\' government in exile.

The Imperial government has recognized the rebel leadership as the current
government of Colchis, even though loyal members of our armed forces still 
resist the tyranny of the rebel coalition. If assistance can reach our 
loyal
subjects, this rebellion can still be put down.

We have gathered together 1000 experienced men and 5000 tons of war 
material for delivery to our loyal subjects on Colchis II. To that end,  we 
are
seeking the use of a war fleet capable of neutralizing the rebel defense 
fleet and delivering the liberation forces to the planet surface.

Our intelligence assets have discovered the following information about the 
rebel defense fleet at Colchis:

1.	The rebels are devoting approximately MCr2000 per year to fleet
maintenance.  (This indicates a build value of approximately MCr 20000.)

2.	Approximately 800 naval crewmen and 250 marines are serving aboard
ships at any time.

3.	All functioning vessels are operating at TL12.

4.	With the exception of twelve 400tn vessels of various types (converted
armed merchants and patrol vessels), none of the ships of the defense fleet 
are jump-capable.

5.	Passive observation indicates the fleet consists of two 5000tn vessels
(one operating as a fighter carrier), two 1000tn vessels, and twenty sub-
1000tn vessels (including the twelve jump-capable craft).  There are also
an indeterminate number of small craft, approximately 100.

The responding war fleet must be capable of Jump-3 to make the voyage to
the Colchis system.  Colchis has a gas giant available for refueling
purposes, and a standard atmosphere. The men and material must be
carried on ships that can land through this atmosphere, or there must be
sufficient craft carried to deploy the men and material in a reasonable
amount of time (10 trips or fewer).

Our funds for charter and support of the invasion fleet are strictly 
limited, and
therefore we must accept the lowest bid capable of performing the task.
Furthermore, the status of Colchis as a class 2 client state of the 
Imperium
will effectively prohibit use of technology above TL12 for the invasion 
fleet.
Through special arrangements we will be able to provide nuclear missile
loads to the invasion fleet - we understand the rebels have nuclear missile 
loads as well.

We look forward to the oncoming liberation of our homeworld. Death to the
rebels!!

His majesty,
King Eric Kane
Sovereign of Colchis

- ----
To reiterate:
Bids are currently being taken for a Jump-3, TL12 force capable of 
defeating
a MCr 20000 system defense force and delivering 1000 men and 5000tns of
materials to a standard-atmosphere planet surface. Low bidder gets the
contract. High Guard Sec. Ed. + Trillion Credit Squadron rules will be 
used,
as will the same fighter squadron rules in use for the current Islands 
Cluster
campaign. IRC is the preferred method of resolving the combat.

Any takers?

GT, random characters and conversions of Trav characters over to GT
levels.  I\'m less concerned with producing a GURPS character and
more getting a Traveller one with the right ranges of values for
play in a GURPS mechanics system...

Converting a Traveller Character (2d6) to a similar character in
GURPS:

Attributes:

  TA (Traveller Attribute) = 1 to 15     TA  GA
  GA (GURPS Attribute) = 8 to 16         ======
                                          1   8
  GA = for the first 12 of TA             2   8
       7 + (TA/2), up                     3   9
       then +1 for each point             4   9
       above that                         5  10
                                          6  10
  This gives a nice range of              7  11
  random numbers, but doesn\'t             8  11
  create as many \'sports\' on the          9  12
  edges.                                 10  12
                                         11  13
  I like this much better than           12  13
  GA = TA + 3 (4 to 18)                  13  14
                                         14  15
  Personally, I\'d keep all the           15  16
  Traveller Attributes (EDU, CHA,
  SOC, & PSI...if you use it) GURPS 
  or not.
  
Skills:

     TS (Traveller Skills) = 0 to 6+
     GS (GURPS Skills) = 5- to 20+
     
 1.  Find GURPS Listing for Skills getting...
 
     a.  Controlling Attribute (consider spliting IQ into INT, EDU,
         CHA & SOC; or better yet use the controlling attribute
         suggested by MT or TNE)
     
     b.  Difficulty of Skill (this is a concept Trav hasn\'t had, so
         you\'ll *have* to find this is GURPS)
 
 2.  Find the MOD (from table below).
 
  Difficulty     
   of Skill   MOD  
  ===============   These numbers match those in GURPS 
  Easy         0    for an Att+0 level.  
  Average     -1
  Hard        -2    Unlike GURPS, additional skill points
  Very Hard   -3    don\'t cost increased amounts, a pt is a pt.
  
 3. Calculate Skill Level.
 
      GS = Controlling Attribute + MOD + TS
    
Try running some Traveller characters through this and see if they
don\'t convert pretty well.

Next step, generating *new* characters.

Heck, I\'ve heard of a guy who somehow or other managed to set things up
so that he had two groups of players in the same dungeon in a D&D game.
When they ran into each other it got kinda ugly...

Then they aren\'t paying attention. There was a third book. Maybe even a
fourth (it\'s been a *long* time). It\'s still unfinished though.

I\'ll cheerfully admit to wanting to strangle some of the characters at
times. I also recognize the fact that I\'m *supposed* to feel that way
about them.

But it is a neat concept and background.

I know that he\'s written at *least* one book of fiction about life on
a carrier ("Now Hear This"). I recommend it as an example of the sort
of hijinks naval personnel indulge in.

If there are any other books that form a "series" with "Now Hear This"
*please* let me know.

    'body' => 'I\'ve never used either of these, but I think the two nastiest monsters
are: 

1. One of the creatures from John W. Campbell\'s "Who goes there?" They
   were depicted fairly accurately in the John Carpenter version of
   "The Thing". I advise reading the book anyway, as it\'ll make it
   clearer just *how* bad the situation is.
   Basicly, the alien is a shapeshifter that is intelligent and aquires
   the memories of the creatures it eats. So if it kills a party
   member, it can *succesfully* impersonate him. It reproduces by
   "budding", So if you cut it in half, you now have two of them.
   There *is* a way to figure out which party members have been
   replaced. But I won\'t tell you. You can read the book.  The book is
   the *worst* possible thing to read on a dark and stormy night if you
   are out in the middle of nowhere with only a few friends. :-)

2. The Hlaat. These are from one of James Schmitz\'s stories. The name
   means "rock lion". They resemble a big furry carpet. They have an
   interesting ability. They can move thru solid matter and carry
   objects with them.
   It\'s apparently a psi ability and they have some sort of
   ability to sense their surroundings surroundings while inside
   objects. They have pretty fine control over their abilities.
   For example, at one point, one of them grabs someone in battle
   dress. They later find the top half of the suit sticking out of the
   floor in a corridor. The person wearing it wasn\'t inside. And the
   bottom half was left elsewhere.
   A standard attack for them is to lurk just under the surface and
   wait for prey to walk over, they then drag them into the ground and
   have lunch. :-)
   At least one bad guy has just enough time to realize that the
   corridor didn\'t have a carpet the last time he walked down it... :-)

   In the story, a couple of them were being transported in special low
   berths, accompanied by their "keepers". Someone mistakenly thought
   it was a cover for transporting a shipment of jewels and tried to
   hijack them. Oops!
   An extra, secret detail was that Hlaats are *intelligent and
   telepathic. So their attacks were set up to cause the maximum amount
   of psychological damage. Grabbing the last man from a column, that
   sort of thing.
   They are actually quite peaceful. They didn\'t kill the guy in the
   battle dress, they just stuffed him in a low berth. On the other
   hand, when one was under energy weapons fire, it *did* leave one of
   the bad guys halfway thru a wall. Messy way to die.

Hlaats are best used on a small isolated space station or a medium to
large ship. That way there\'s no outside help available for a long but
more or less known period, but the space is restricted enough that you
can *try* to sweep it for them.

Correct. Andy had been working on something at the same time as Eris and
asked me to post the material to (1) get a feel what people thought of it,
and (2) try to make it clear he wasn\'t trying to rip anyone off. The
material posted is very much a draft and will probably go in future BITS
adventure supplements.

I laid out two maps of the target house in different rooms. Assasin in

through the door and proceeded to stab the robe clad "assasin" to death,

In G:T you can store 77 missiles in the magazine in each 500cf
mount (3 mounts to a turret) plus presumably one in the launcher.

This is quite an achievement as a G:T missile is 6 cf.
So *at least* 462 cf (77 * 6cf) is occupied by missiles 
leaving 38 cf for the missile launcher, the magazine rack,
dead space and one third of a "roomy" crew station.

Doesn\'t sound right does it?  Is there errata for this?

G:T missiles weigh 135 kg (300lbs). 
G:T Sand-canisters weight 55 Kg (120lbs).
You can store 200 canisters in a 500cf sandcaster mount (3 mounts per
turret).

I had assumed they were about a third the volume of a missile = 2 cf.

Using your CT figures would make them only two-thirds of a cubic foot,
(with a density of 3g/cm3). 200 would occupy 127 cf.  This sounds about
right.

In fact using this as a basis you should be able to store 77 missiles
*per turret*.

What gives?

I "missed" most of the MT material when it was first published, so one

task system! It makes it so much easier to keep "off the cuff" rulings

I agree.  I honestly like the "roll target number or lower"
techniques better than the MT/CT roll higher techniques, but that\'s
personal taste.  In either case, standard levels of difficulty and
descriptive names for things make playing the game much better,
again IMO.

other versions of Traveller next, though I\'m not sure how applicable what I
find will be to GT. I am soliciting your assistance: please send me the

with a page reference and its place in the hierarchy (if known). I\'ll post
occasional updates as new information warrants, and eventually put the
whole edifice up on the web.

One interesting point is that the IISS has never been assigned to a
cabinet-level organization. I\'ve placed it in MoI&C for convenience, but
I\'d be interested to see a canonical answer.

The specific idea is to allow book reviews of science fiction
that has a Traveller-esque feel to it, or that you feel that
Traveller players would enjoy reading.  Both of those are
admittedly quite fuzzy criteria; I\'m open to suggestions on how
to tighten them up.

Is this a good idea?  Would you be willing to read articles in
this section, if it were to happen?  Would you be willing to
_write_ articles in this section, if it were to happen?  What

There have been several times recently that I wish there was somewhere to post
a review about a Sci-Fi book or movie that related to Traveller, sounds really
good.

I agree totally.  I even tried to create one for Milieu 0, but I\'ve misplaced it.
I realize that the canonicity of Milieu 0 is suspect to some, but FWIW,
from Milieu 0 (pp.46-47):

The Nobility
The Moot
The Bureacracy:
   The Military
      Army
      Navy
          Marines
   The Office of Standards (covers trade, justice, etc.)
      Office of Calendar Compliance
          The Imperial Office of Justice (later Ministry of Justice)
   The Scout and Exploratory Services (later IISS)
   The Ministry of Information
   The Diplomatic Corps

Although discussed, the Bureau of Interstellar Affairs is not clearly affiliated
with
any other named office.

Similarly I haven\'t used them in Traveller, but something akin to the
Ravers in Thomas Covenant would give me the creeps. I\'m not overly
enamoured with the series, but could imagine a nasty Psi based monster like
it.

Another one I remember being bad for players was one I stole from an
Imagine magazine (sort of TSR UKs local version of Dragon). This had a
small woodlouse like creature which numbed the skin of a victim, then
burrowed in and laid eggs. The scene that springs to mind was the pilot
panicking when searching the engine room when another player pointed a snub
pistol at his head (to shoot the bug that had landed on it). )When the
creatures burrowed in, they sent the victim mad with pain).

The other big literary nasty that springs to mind was the keeper in B5.
(Bylabon in 101 Lifeforms). I suppose that, which is also a
psionic/possession type nasty may say more about me than how nasty the
monster is.

From the perspective of an author (supplements and adventures), having a
combined/interlinked task system is great.

Most TNE, MT and T4 refs can interpolate between the systems. Adding a
basic conversion for task difficulties means GT and CT refs can do the
same. This means one supplement can cover a variety of systems. Traveller
is possibly unique in all the bigger systems in having 5 current system
versions, and a sixth planned, which poses its own problems.

Eris, I\'d love to agree with you here but wouldn\'t agreeing with *the*

I prefer T4.1\'s system to MT, but I play T4.1 with HG for starships.

OK, I have my own bias toward the system I put in the GURPS
Traveller article some years ago (and which seems to be the
father of all these approaches :-).  Based on that...

>Table 1: Common Difficulty Ratings
>Difficulty		CT Target	GT Target
>		Modifier	Modifier
>Easy		-4	+6
>Routine		-2	+3
>Normal		0	0
>Difficult		+2	-3
>Formidable	+4	-6
>Staggering	+6	-9
>Impossible		+8	-12
>Hopeless		+10	-15

I dropped out the "Hopeless" catagory since it really is redundant
with "Impossible" and I really don\'t see the need for a -15 modifier
(I\'ve never run into a situation where a player was willing to try
something at a -15 :-).  But I guess that is more an issue with
T4 and you are trying to adapt to that.

Also, my system ended at -3, mostly because (as a GM) I never
felt the need for guidance on the easier things.  Going up
to a +6 is good (for characters that are doing things off of
their defaults).

Note: GURPS characters do sometime have stats down to 7 on
100 points.  This rare, but then so, IMO at least :-), is
a Traveller stat of 1 or 2.

In fact this stuff has been around at least since I posted
my GURPS Traveller article some years ago.  I have no problem
with people borrowing the idea (and game mechanics aren\'t
copyrightable anyway, though an acknowledgement is always nice :-).
In fact, if want to actually copy the passage from my article, you
have  my permission (though it isn\'t clear why one would _want_
to go that far :-) as long as you mention where it came from.

    'body' => 'The nastiest monster I\'ve ever used in CT gaming was one of those small
insidious beasties that lurk in and arround starports and often accompanies
imperium forces. Namely, the tax official.

In brief they can often move amongst humaniti having a similar physical
apperance, though their speech is discisable they can\'t immitate it for
long. Rumors persist that they can even interbreed with humaniti though the
offspring are said to be fortunately sterile and unable to socialise with
us.

They communicate amongst each other in a language seldom comprehended even
by Vilani of the AAB. Somehow they are able to access the Xboat network,
though Xboat officials denigh this.

Their econiche is intermittent, as they can be found feeding from the
carrion of deceased estates and the stripped carcases of bankrupt
companies, pouncing on the unwiry at customs posts, stalking in the
corporate jungle and even reducing earnings within greater financial
institutions. In their (alleged) natural form they are tirless hunters
taking from all but the craftiest of predators who hide their kills with
utmost care. * Some claim they are also symbiots, no eveidence of this has
been presented to me of this.

The most notworthy attribute they possess is the (neo-psi ?) ability to
generate fear and loathing to all they confront. Indealing with these
monsters remember they are pack hunters, while one or two may be seen in
any confrontation, watch your flanks and rear, there will be several others
nearby. If you put up any resistance let alone are too strong for them some
will try to get you secnt then escape. Packs of them will follow, changing
their apparent econiche to keep you off guard. Their ability to gain and
keep memory of a scent is why the Imperium has tried like its predecessors
to domesticate them.

Their character is like their econiche intermittent. They have been
observed carrying out the most inconsistant and crulest of practices. These
range from hounding individuals to suiside to denighing the existance of
prey when secondary school childern have been alleged capable of follow an
audit trail to its end. In other occassions they have fed upon their own
kind.

All in all, an unfathomable if vendictive nasty. No fixed location or mode
of behaviour and often exibiting odd powers or using/being used by other
groups. But remember \'It\'s their job to be fair\'.

In the early 1980\'s, a member of my old games club in London, Ontario used
to run an insane near-future SF game at conventions, using a variant of the
Traveller rules, involving *three* separate groups of PCs simultaneously.
He had a small closed-circuit phone system that connected him to the three
sub-referees, each running a group of six to eight players in three
separate rooms -- each group knew nothing of the other groups\' actions.
These games achieved a legendary status in the southern-Ontario RPG scene
for their bloodletting and mayhem.

The scenario was called "Silence in Gehenna", based on the early-70\'s
Harlan Ellison story, "Silent in Gehenna". Each group of PCs were a cell of
an underground revolutionary organization, making a raid on a university
campus (usually the school where the convention was being held, or one
nearby, using actual school maps), in a future North American police state,
ruled by an iron-fisted military-corporate complex. The universities have
become armed camps, surrounded by razor wire, guard towers, high-tech
detectors grids, and pulse laser weapons. The three PC groups have each
independently chosen the same night to make a raid on the campus (to mark
the anniversary of some massacre of protestors years before); one group is
supposed to kidnap the university comptroller, one is trying to seize the
radio station, and the third is trying to blow up the ROTC building, or
whatever.

You can imagine the chaos.  None of the cells knows what the others are
doing: Group 1 decides to make a dash across the quad; their sub-ref calls
this in to the central ref, who informs the sub-ref of Group 2. Group 2\'s
ref says, "You see several armed figures running towards your position
across the quad". Group 2 thinks it\'s the school\'s Army guard, and open
fire. Group 1\'s ref tells his group, "You\'re under fire by someone in the
Computer Science building..."

On top of this, the guy running the whole show was a bloodthirsty loon who
could care less for game mechanics. When NPCs fired on a group of
characters, he would simply roll a number of dice equal to the number of
PCs, using those black  dice with Death\'s heads for sixes: each Death\'s
head was a hit; he\'d let the sub-refs roll damage as they saw fit. All the
refs made a concerted effort to kill off every PC by the end of the game.

I ran a character who had the unusual distinction of having actually
survived two "Silence in Gehenna" sessions, at two different conventions.
Granted, he was captured by the Army at the end of the second game, and if
I\'d played in another he would\'ve been a brainwashed government mole in one
of the cells.

One absurd moment that sticks in my mind, from a game set at Carlton
University in Ottawa: some of our group had taken the security station of a
campus building, and thus were able to follow events on the security video
system; my PC was descending in an elevator with a fellow cell-member (a
martial artist armed with a katana for some reason), when our fellows in
the security room informed us by cellphone that there were two
heavily-armed Army boys waiting in the lobby for us. The guards knew we
were coming down in the elevator, and we knew they were there waiting. So
when the doors opened all hell broke loose. I fired, they fired; I think
everybody got hit. Katana boy was dead before he hit the back wall of the
elevator. My PC was just winged -- but got captured later, trying to escape
across the canal.

Yep.  There were three, don\'t remember how much of an after thought the
second two were.  I read them years ago in Highschool.  I\'d wanted to read
the first one in grade school when I found it in a bookstore, but my Mom
took one look at the back of the cover and veto\'d that, something about a
corrupting influence on youth :^)

Anyway IIRC the second book takes place about 10 years after the first.  I
wonder where on earth my set is, I know I still have them, as I never get
rid of Sci-Fi books.  If you can find copies somewhere such as Powells, I\'d
seriosly recommend it, however, I\'d expect it to take some serious work.

Old Earth Publishing is doing a high-quality trade paperback series of all
six books, which does cost $15 each.  The Science Fiction Book Club is
producing a collected edition that puts all six books in two volumes, each
volume going for $15.   Take your pick.  I\'ve seen the Old Earth editions
and they are very nice productions.  The SFBC books are clearly cheaper,
but I don\'t know what the quality is.  However, only the first volume (thew
first three books) is available now.

You just reminded me of another Schmitz nasty. It\'s from one of the
Telzey stories. Somebody sics a sort of telepathic "hound" on her.

Basicly, once given the "scent" (sample psi imprint), it\'ll tune in on
the psi\'s mind. If the psi isn\'t shielded, it picks up their sensory
impressions of their location. It then *teleports* to them and kills
them. 

Telzey manged to dodge it the first few times. But she was stuck in an
isolated area. And she neither had a "psi shield" gadget nor (then) the
ability to maintain *tight* shields while she slept. 

She finally escaped by making it think she was in a cave inside a
nearby rock formation. Which *didn\'t* have a cave... until then. A 100
kilo beatie teleporting into solid rock does tend to disrupt the rock a
bit...

Actually, come to think of it, Schmitz had a *lot* of nifty critters.
Diamondwood groves are an interesting ecology to throw at players. So
are several other critters whose names I can\'t recall. Try finding "A
Pride of Monsters", it\'s got a bunch of his shorts in it. Another to
look for (but *very* hard to find) is "A Nice Day for Screaming, and
other Tales of the Hub".

Many years ago  at a local con, for the final round of a D&D Tournament
the idiot DM decided to pit the final 2 teams against each other.
20th level characters, any 3 first edition magic items that werent 
artifacts or relics. the teams start 1 mile apart on a flat open plain,
The DM said this will be a short game, figuring that one of the teams
would just slaughter the other in short order. This would have been the case
except for the fact that the 2 teams were formed from a mix of folks from 2
semi
local campaigns, and everybody knew each other. what the DM said would take 
15 minutes, took the better part of 3 hours. and ended with the last player
on each
team shaking hands and calling it a tie.
when the DM told the 2 groups what the final round was to be, both group
leaders immediately told
the DM "Forget this ****, call it a tie right now". The DM was more than a
little upset.
this DM had won the AD&D "Masters" Tournament the year before supposedly.
yeah right.

In terms of general relevance, it really depends on whether you think the Moot

and sustain sufficient unity, organisation and budget to set up and maintain
IRIS as an effective institution - to the point where it could continue as an
independent entity when the Moot declines to being a mere cowed instrument of
Lucan.

If your view is yes, then there is probably a subgroup within the Moot which

their delivery mechanism.

roleplaying game where there ended up being 2 die rolls in the entire game.

the objective was to determine whether the red zone/interdiction on a
planet could
be lifted and trade reestablished. It had been interdicted 200+ years ago
after the 
TL-13 planet blew itself back to about TL-4 or early TL-5 in a nuclear war.

one team consisted of the survey/contact team on planet, the second team
was the diplomatic
/corporate/bureaucratic team at the subsector capitol a jump away. all
messages between the
planets took 15 minutes of real time each way. 

each team had its own guidelines, and each player had their own secret agenda.
The game was judged based on a vote by all the players, judges
recommendations, and the after 
action report each player turned in.

While the scenario seems straight forward, the number of curveballs that
were tossed in by
the GM and some of the players livened things up immensely.

These included:
a Labship being blown out of orbit by a nuke
the Psionics Expert being a Zhodani Spy
The Ambassador on planet being an Assasin in disguise
one of the Megacorps smuggling guns on planet
a Regiment of TL-13 Lift Cavalry as Sleeper troops being found
a rather dirty corporate war between the 2 corps vying for exploitation rights

The game ended up a tie between the 2 characters that were figured
unlikeliest to win

This is the problem with "canonicity"; no one can agree on exactly what it
is.

Mileau 0 was published by what was at the time the company that published
Traveller. It is as canon as anything that GDW did. GDW, and Marc if he
chooses can decide if certain portions of canon need be excised later (ex.
Leviathan\'s jump missles, portions of the DGP materials, etc.) We are, of
course, free to use what we like and not use what we don\'t like..but arguing
the "canonicity" of published materials is pointless. if it\'s published, and
not rescinded by the copyright holder, it\'s "canon"...it just might not be
YOUR canon. (which in effect means there is no real canon at all).

basically ported over our old Mileau 0 game to the GURPS rules with minor
adaptations, and we had a great time. The scenario was mainly diplomatic,
with the characters defending a small world from a ruthless pocket empire.
The characters never got into any combat until the ship combat. They
organized a rag-tag fleet of ore carriers, 50-ton system patrol fighters,
and their own Extended Duration Survey Vessel, to take on one 2,000 ton
destroyer, two 800 ton escorts and 4 1,200 ton Assault Transports. We ran
the combat as straight as we could, no fudging of the rules, and I played as
smart as I could as the enemy ships. We didn\'t play out the whole battle; I
used the "the success of the PC\'s determines the overall success of the
battle". The Pc\'s, in the 300-ton ship, took on the 2,000 ton destroyer
which had a particle accelerator bay, 6 triple laser turrets and 4 triple
missle turrets.
    The characters won. The GURPS Traveller space combat rules seemed to
work ok, although the sensor rules, as mentioned before, are wonky. We made
some on the fly adjustments by utililizing a BL-like system of range bands,
and that seemed to work ok. The players used excellent tactics, hiding
behind the planet\'s moon and "popping up" to fire; luck also played a part
as the destroyer never detected the PC\'s ship. The PC\'s didn\'t destroy their
opponent, but they basically forced it to jump out (unbeknownst to the
characters, but to the great amusement of the players, it misjumped). The
clincher was the two hits with missles, the first doing 24,000 points of
damage (after DR), the other doing over 30,000 points. On the basis of that,
I declared heavy casualties among the defenders, but that the other
attacking ships followed suit when the destroyer left (they did not
misjump). next time we play, the characters will be involved in an Imperial
fleet action to persuade the pocket empire to cease their expansionitic
plans in the Core Sector.

This scenario would not even have been remotely possible without the Space
Dock program, which allowed me to crank out those ships :)

In the far-flung reaches of the diverse and ever-astonishing Third
Imperium, sometime in its thousands of years of recorded history,
somewhere amidst its tapestry of eleven thousand worlds, someone will need
a jump-capable freighter with a walker transmission.

The answer is, of course, the Gamera-class Ambulatory Trader.  The size of
a standard subsidized merchant, the Gamera has the indescribable advantage
of being able to walk around.

* Gamera can clomp around nearly any terrain at a leisurely but implacable
pace.  When it comes time to leave, powerful HEPlaR jets boost the ship
into orbit and through interplanetary space.  A jump drive will take it a
parsec in any direction; total refuelling just prior to jump and careful
navigation will allow two consecutive jumps, though the vessel will be
nearly without reaction mass after coming out of the second one.
(Drivers should also keep in mind that the Gameras are heavy -- and if
they\'ve got much cargo in the hold at all, they\'ll float like a boulder.)

* Heavy hull armor will (hopefully) compensate for the lack of sandcasters
as originally designed; Gameras also come equipped with a powerful laser
emplacement -- which, if full power is not being applied to the rockets or
legs, can run up to ROF 800 (though that requires nearly half of the full
power plant output) -- capable of fatally surprising many an opponent.

* Gamera-class freighters do not have contragrav installed; they must rely
on their HEPlaR thrust and aerodynamics to lift off from planetary
surfaces.  Typically this should not be a problem -- worlds without
atmospheres are likely to be smaller and have low escape velocities that
the rockets can manage on their own.

* Spacious living quarters for the normal full crew of eleven (nine
single-occupancy and one double-occupancy large staterooms) make the
Gameras a friendly home away from home.  Something more than six
displacement tons of space are available for customization by the owner.

[1] As I don\'t have FF&SII available with its more complete rules for
streamlining and airframing, I went with just basic streamlining per the
original FF&S.  This may mean that in gearhead play the vessel must travel
more slowly when fuel skimming, thus taking longer to get a full load;
hence the extra-large intake scoops on the ship.

[2] Since the HEPlaR and legs can\'t be used simultaneously, I\'ve assumed
that a single driver/helmsman position can cover both.  

ECONOMICS:
Using the unofficial rule suggested on the TML that crew life support
costs be set at Cr400/2 weeks/member, and that the cost of unrefined fuel
be reduced to Cr5/ton, and my own  fix that berthing costs be equal to the
displacement tonnage of the ship per day, and furthermore assuming a full
cargo hold for each of 25 jumps per year, Gamera-class traders need to
earn over Cr4800 per cargo displacement ton per jump.  Once the ship is
paid off -- however the hell that might happen -- it\'s considerably more
economical (maybe around Cr400-500/dT/jump, depending on what extra costs
older ships incur to run).  

A fiscally responsible explanation of why Gamera-class traders are built
is left as an exercise for the reader.

Excellent compilation! One point to remember, though. ALL references in MT
sources, are going to be for the bureacracy with the entirety of known space
on a war footing, such as the Censor Bureau. I doubt that that is in operation
during non-wartime, and would thus not be present in GT...

1950\'s vs today...

Well, welcome to the dark side, Allen, because the logical extention

>(which in effect means there is no real canon at all).

There are folks on this list that wouldn\'t even agree with the
"rescinded by copyright holder" proviso. ;-> 

Rather than argue about details, I\'ve always said, once you get past
the general things that make Traveller, Traveller it\'s all really
just IYTU anyway.  Of course, just what those general things are is
open for debate, but let\'s not debate them again right now, OK?  ;->

Now about M0, many of us on the list had long discussions about what
we like and dislike about M0 (as published) and about how we might
have done it differently.  Personally, I don\'t have a bit of trouble
with someone setting their campaign in M0, as published, but then I
don\'t have a problem if someone says, "Nah, I think I\'ll change
things and do it a different way."

But, heretic or not, I\'ve never had a problem with games that stick
to the published materials.  ;-> It *is* fun to discuss a common
background and play there sometimes, I do it too.  My problem has
always been when people devalue a game (sometimes to the point of
saying "you aren\'t playing Traveller") when a game doesn\'t stick
religiously to that common background.

    won\'t you be a heretic too? ;->

IIRC, the first book was a collaboration between William F. Nolan and

Roger, I am taking that into account in my own notes. I just thought it
cluttered the list unnecessarily to post every disclaimer.

On the other hand, it is often surprising how many bureaucratic
institutions that were created "for the duration" continue long after their
usefulness has ended; there may also be vestigial agencies that exist in a
dormant state in preparation for war or other emergency. The U.S. Selective
Service is a classic case in point.

Organizations (especially bureaucracies) are like organisms. They exist for
two purposes:

(1) Perpetuate their own existance.

(2) Extend their sphere of influence and access to resources, in order to
support #1.

Any "mission statement" or "intended purpose" is strictly tertiary.

Rules?

Mine are all metric.

GT really bugs me. It claims to be \'Imperial\' but it\'s actually \'American\'
and then it mixes in SI units.... <sigh> It\'s silly, but most of the old
Imperial units have little reference for me, except maybe height.

I suspect that you\'re right. And Traveller never needed the disclaimer that
AD&D did (in second ed) that the GM should feel happy to change rules to
suit themselves.

A few years ago me and two of my friends arranged a three-GM and up to 15
player GURPS-Illuminati game at a local con. As an extra bit of confusion,
the game was placed at the same con, with fictional characters among real
ones. The game was layed in a single room with 3 different tables, one for
each GM and his/her players. Each of these sub-games had a different mood
and rules to it, one being quite realistic, one cinematic and one horror,
and the characters could change from one "parallel dimension" ,as
represented by a different GM and table, to another. As a consequence there
were 4 character sheets for each character, as their abilities changed from
table to table. (The fourth character sheet was for the player,
representing the _characters_ image of itself. There were at least three
megalomaniac characters, whose player-held character sheets had _a lot_ of
20+ stats and skills.) We played the game at three different days of the
con with three different groups of players, cycling though some 40-50
players and characters. It was a lot of work, and quite confusing at times,
but at least we were able to reality-check some problems easily. Still it
was so much fun, that if it weren\'t for the workload involved, I\'d do it
again every year. And it hasn\'t been the last multi-GM game I\'ve been
involved in.

Gee, Dom, but that\'s what *we* call it over here; feet, pounds,
quarts are what we call the Imperial system.  Ok, they don\'t match
with what the British ended up with in every case, but that was
their origin and so in *your* honor that\'s what we call them.  ;-p

Oh, and fortnight is a perfectly normal word over here too.  Not
used a lot, but still perfectly valid.  If many Americans don\'t know
what a fortnight, a furlong, or a fathom is then that says something
about our educational systems...not our language. ;->

>It\'s silly, but most of the old Imperial units have little

Then more\'s the pity!  IMO, of course.  Sure, SI units are nice for
arithmetic, but the amounts they represent are often less
"humancentric", again IMO.

Could be.  I cut my teeth on D&D and Traveller, first editions, so I
expect the GM to have to create the rules...not just change them.

Eris,
    Ok, come on over to the Light side, if the Dark side doesn\'t
    appeal to you...it\'s all relative anyway. ;->

Darek powered up his spinner.  Click, click, click, the toggle switches
replied back to him as the organic lights above them came to life.  He
checked power, life support, avionics, guidance, computer, and engines.
He checked the structure, and ignited the engines.  With a white hot
blast his tiny craft accelerated at 0.1 G toward the start volume.

Several craft were already there, powered up, tethered to the launch
buoy.  Within the hour, all contestants were tethered and ready to go.
With a lurch the tethers were cut, sending the spinners catapulting off
towards the Jovian atmosphere, one light-minute away.  Tumbling
about some random axes, the spinners waited for the countdown to
end.  After exactly 15 seconds, thrity-eight engines lit up, propelling the
miniscule squadron forward at 4 G\'s.  Some ships veered to one side,
no doubt planning to borrow momentum from Ganymede.  Others didn\'t
bother with such a silly attempt, heading instead directly toward Jupiter\'s
atmosphere.  In the distance, Darek saw one well-armored ship bounce
off of another; ramming is a dangerous trick that has cost lives before.

Darek aimed his ship for the outer atmosphere.  He had a specially-
made scramjet that he was depending on, and needed a hydrogen
atmosphere to use it in.  As he sunk into the outer layers, he ignited
the scramjet and hauled along the stratosphere of Jupiter, hoping no
unforseen problems awaited him.  Acid pockets were known to
destroy unwitting spinners before.

Awhile later, eighteen ships emerged from the \'dark\' side of Jupiter,
careening back out of the gravity well at well over escape velocity.
A few more system failures reduced this number to twelve.  Finally
the surviving ships crossed the threshold of the start volume, one at
a time, spread out over hours.

Neither Derek nor his ship were ever found.

My take was that IRIS was another faction in the rebellion, but that
instead of trying to steal the iridium throne through military conquest
they used subterfuge. The other factions were going along with them only to
legitimize their own claim to power.

"Ridgway"

In my first contribution to this debate, I discussed some of the
possible military repercussions of Gallatin\'s proposed reforms.  I wish
to expand upon this topic, by pointing out some of the changes that
would, in my opinion, have to be made in Imperial military policies and
structures, if Gallatin\'s plan is adopted.

1.  Imperial Member Worlds would need to be largely disarmed.

Traditionally, the responsibility for defensive ground combat has fallen
chiefly on the various Member Worlds of the Imperium.  This fact is a
logical corollary of the Imperial policy of ruling space, rather than
worlds.  If the Imperium changes this policy, then the corollary no
longer applies.  Imperial ground forces would need to supplant planetary
ground forces, for several reasons.  First, an Imperial government bent
on ensuring that the governments of Imperial Member Worlds are "more
responsive to the needs and desires" of their populations cannot allow
those governments to have the means to resist Imperial might.  Naval
forces cannot, by themselves, compel obedience.  They can strangle trade
between worlds, they can bring vast destruction to the surface of
planets, but they cannot force a world\'s rulers to abdicate or submit. 
Only ground forces can exercise control over the surface of a world. 
Therefore, all ground forces must submit to _direct_ Imperial authority,
or be either disbanded or destroyed.  Second, since the Imperium could
not allow the existence of ground combat forces that did not answer
directly to Imperial authority, the Imperium would need to fill the
vacuum in ground forces with Imperial units.  Finally, the lower-tech
Member Worlds would find themselves defenseless, unless strong Imperial
ground forces provided a garrison.    The reason for this is simple.  In
order to defend themselves agains high-tech forces, such as [insert your
favorite extra-Imperial foe], lower-tech worlds rely on vast numbers of
defenders.  Because large standing forces enable an "unresponsive" world
government to impose its will upon the peoples of said world, the
Imperial government cannot permit them to exist.  Since smaller low-tech
forces cannot provide an adequate defense, the high-tech Imperial forces
would have to substitute.

Similarly, local naval forces cannot be allowed to become powerful
enough to challenge Imperial might.  The disarmament of local naval
forces again would require the introduction of Imperial forces as
replacements.

2.  Imperial ground forces would need to be expanded greatly.

The required expansion of Imperial ground forces springs inevitably from
the logic of Point One above.  Potentially "non-responsive" Member
Worlds cannot be allowed to have sufficeint force to allow them to
resist Imperial intervention.  Since disarming such worlds would make
them more vulnerable to hostile attack, these worlds will require
Imperial garrisons sufficient to replace the disbanded local forces. 
While the disbanded local forces can be used as a manpower pool, subject
to their ability to learn to use Imperial-level-tech equipment, the new
Imperial units would need appropriate-tech equipment themselves.

Additionally, the increased OPTEMPO of Imperial ground forces, needed to
"restructure - by force if necessary" the governments of Imperial Member
Worlds would require a further increase in Imperial ground force
strength, simply to maintain an equal availability of forces to respond
to extra-Imperial incursions.

3.  Imperial forces would need to be reorganized.

Imperial soldiers, Marines, and spacebeings are as susceptible to
emotional turmoil as the general populations from which they are drawn. 
Few sophonts will face with equanimity the prospect of firing on others
of their homeworlds.  To prevent this source of disruption, Imperial
forces will need to be stationed far from home.  Even if the definition
of "far from home" is merely "a different subsector from one\'s home
world", this leads to logistical problems, as recruits must be
transported quite some distance from their worlds of origin.  Stationing
sophonts far from home also negatively impacts morale, particularly
among the various human cultures.  Reducing this impact would prove to
be a logistical nightmare, as either Imperial military personnel would
need to be allowed periodic leave on their home worlds (involving
several jumps each way), or world-specific cultural items would need to
be sent from the various worlds to wherever those worlds\' natives served
(imagine the cost sending genuine Terran "White Castle burgers" all the
way to Reaver\'s Deep, or, worse, to the Spinward Marches).

In short, gentlebeings, enforcing the reforms that Gallatin proposes
would require that we rebuild the Imperium\'s military from the ground
up, in guiding philosophy as well as in actual forces.

Are Gallatin\'s reforms worth the cost?
