	This is correct, except the meson screen effectiveness depends upon the
screen operator\'s skill and luck (See pGT171).

	The two points you are missing: David Pulver matched the high lethality
of starship combat from the original CT/HG. And Gurps has an even higher
combat lethality. If you can hit the ship in either set of rules, you
usually end up doing significant damage, and the ship dies quickly.
Second most designs (should) rely on the "Not being Hit" defense or the
"I can kill you faster" defense. 
	Review the to hit discussion on pGT167/8 & 173/4. To Hit the Megalith
at 1/2D range for your bay weapons is 12 (Gunner Skill) + 12 (Acc) + 9
(Targeting program) + 4 (ROF Bonus) + 15 (Size Mod) - 46 (Range Mod) =
10 (or less) on 3d6 (less than 50%). This alone will double the survival
time of the victim. The advantage of the Spinal mount is the greatly
extended range upon with it can still kill your ship (i.e. outside the
range of your bay weapons).

As the title of this post indicates, we\'re probably on the Nth RFW by
now.  If this one gets going (here\'s hoping it won\'t), we need to call
this one the Nth RFW, the next one the (N+1)th RFW, et cetera ad
nauseam.

Given the reference to Cherryh, they are probably the "vanes".
Something to do with her star drive.

I read "cycled" as having to do with sending power/energy thru them,
not moving them in any way.

And I kinda wonder if you can turn a vane "inside out". If so, I see it
as being a "gauss rifle" sort of thing with a muzzle velocity just
short of c. :-)

Alas, not only are the diamonds going to be down in the depths, where
pressures are far too high for ships, but there are much simpler ways
to make diamonds.

Diamonds can be grown in a vacuum by using a seed crystal, you use a
carbon filament and as the carbon boils off it deposits on the diamond.
It takes a good vacuum and lots of time. But it uses very few resources
otherwise. Diamond is gonna be *cheap*.

And not only is the pressure at depth in even a small gas giant going
to make it impossible to harvest anything, there\'s also all that
atmosphere *and* gravity well to dig your way out of. 

Remember, the energy required to get away from a GG is dependent on the
*mass*, not the "surface gravity". And even a small GG has about 50
times the mass of earth.

[begin self inflated, TIC, totally not me reply]

Of course, if G:T hadn\'t come out, I seriously doubt I\'d have as many 3D
Traveller ships out there as I do now :D  Nothing like a deadline for
gettin\' something done ;)

[end self inflated, TIC, totally not me reply]

In all seriousness, I\'d already done the Free Trader "Grendel\'s Daughter"
when I accepted the contract to do artwork for "Far Trader", and I had every
intention of doing more ships as time went by.  There certainly wouldn\'t
have been the amount of ships done in the time frame that they\'ve been done
in.

Do I use G:T?  Nope, don\'t plan on it either.  Do I mine ideas from it?
Yep.  Do I enjoy the other artwork in the books?  YUP!!!  (You kick ass
Glenn Grant!!!)  What\'s my point?  Uh....lessee....Sometimes good things can
come from change?  Hell, I don\'t know.  I just doubt that without G:T I\'d
have been published anytime soon.  Might have got an illo or two into
various BITS books, but SJG is the only other print publisher of Traveller
materials and I\'ve been able to learn a hell of a lot while doing a LOT of
work for them.  I\'ve also come to really enjoy the comments put forth by the
TML community about my work, and have come to rely on the TML\'s support in
what I do and in improving that work.

Yes, two "editions" of the first three books, 1977 and 1981.  And a
repackage as Deluxe version.

Oh dear, and don\'t forget the Starter Edition with all of the book 1-2-3
material repackaged in 8.5x11 format.  Actually, if you look carefully,
there was also a "Deluxe Starter Edition" snuck in there, too.

David, I don\'t think anyone minds having their email embedded in the
middle of your html code.  It\'s the idea of an easily extractable
list of addresses that is making some people uncomfortable.

Let me give you a few examples of what I would like my project
to do.  Chris Thrash emailed me the other day saying that he had
just spent 3 weeks at a training course about 40 miles from my
house.  If he had known where I was, we could have gotten together
to talk Traveller..maybe even play a game.  A couple of people have
mentioned that they lived in the same area for years and didn\'t know
some other TML member was living there, too.  Someone else mentioned
that they would be travelling to Oregon, I think it was, and now
they were thinking about who from the TML they might run into there.
We\'ve had questions about attending local cons, and offers (jokingly
or not) of picking up someone on the way to a con.

The point is, that while we are a close community online, in reality
we are scattered all over the world.  Many of us would like to meet
the people we spend so much time arguing and laughing with.  We want
to meet other folks that play our favorite game.  I\'m hoping to
provide an easily searchable list of names and locations.  If you
are taking a trip, you look on the list and find someone living
there to say "Hi" too, maybe even have a pick up game.  If you are
moving a new area, you look on the list and see if you can find
others already living there.  The only reason I wanted to include an
email address was so you would have a way to *contact* the people
you found, that\'s why I\'m not especially interested in url\'s or
Travcodes in the list.

According to the original solicitations to my FLGS (The owner knew I was a
Traveller Junkie... he sold me 1x T2300, 1x StarCruiser, 2x2300AD), it was
originally supposed to be set in the Traveller Universe.... in 2300 AD (vs
5600AD for then ruling CT...). Shortly before it came out, the ads dropped
all the Traveller tie-ins... but the task system was clearly Traveller (It
was very close to MT/DGP task system)... and was very much still
"Travelleresque" in CGen... more so than TNE, IMNSHO... And the ship design
and combat systems had very much a traveller feel to it...

Even Stutterwarp was tied to a jump2 limit... just over 7 LY range!

Actually the first set of red boxed sets and the second set have numerous
changes, all minor, mostly for clarity.
1st set of boxed "D&D Basic" in red had a companion volume "D&D Expert Set"
in blue.
the revised (and slightly different, in both rules and wordings) had "Basic
Set", "Expert Set", "Companion Set", "Master Set", and "Immortals Set", and
then they were (except for immortals) combined into the D&D Cyclopedia, and
Wrath of the Immortals was released to go with the cyclopaedia. Most
players will never notice the changes...

Since \'80, they added a lot of rules materials in various Mystara
supplements... to wit, some 8 new classes, several secondary classes, load
of spells, 20 new races or more, each having at least one racial class,
plus the 30 or so races in hollow world... It was really becoming a rich
setting when TSR killed it in the early 90\'s

A couple of caveats.

1) I think you are underestimating the amount of armor and screens a
typical warship will carry.  The guidelines developed for GT: Imperial Navy
suggest that 30,000 DR from both armor and meson screens is a more
reasonable level.  This is sufficient to exclude median damage results from
bay weapons at close range and totally negate them at 1/2D range.  Even
more powerful meson screens are quite feasible. 

2) It seems likely that most fleet combats will take place beyond
half-damage range, which obviously halves the damage potential of the
weapons.  This has a particular effect on the utility of bay weapons,
because beyond 1/2D range, it\'s fairly easy for capital ships to gain total
immunity against them.  In extreme cases, bays may not even be in range at
all, while the fleets trade shots with their spinal mounts.  

However, lots of people have had the same feelings.  So the damage
capability of large beam weapons is about to experience a major revision. 
Playtesting of Space, 3rd Edition gave us an optional revision to the
design sequences that will be applied to Traveller weapons.  Using the new
formula, I figure the stock spinal meson gun (which looks like about a
Factor J weapon), will end up doing about 7dx3000 damage. That gives it a
median damage of around 75,000, which can be armored against.  (OTOH, there
will be lots of larger spinal mounts).  Combined with lots of hit points, a
typical GT warship is going to survive for quite a while under spinal fire,
assuming no criticals.  But then criticals could mess you up in High Guard
too.

Which just further goes to prove my point, a standard applies equally across
the board. One can say that a book with the exact same contents but a
different cover is a different "edition." This may initially seem to prove
that AD&D has been through more editions than Traveller. If that same
standard is then applied to Traveller the option doesn\'t look nearly as
attractive.

I still can\'t understand why maintaining the nobility in the post-Third
Imperium TNE universe seems so important to some people.

TNE tried to remove robots from the setting? It didn\'t appear that way to
me. Was I merely fooled by GDW\'s inclusion of several robots in the main
rulebook? The addition of rules for robot creation in Vampire Fleets?

>     - any thought of a resolution to the Rebellion storyline (designed by

That\'s strange. I thought that Virus actually was the resolution of the
Rebellion storyline, at least as the resolution was imagined by GDW.

Personally, I\'ve always been fond of the background of TNE, but for reasons
that nobody seems to mention. For the first time the background actually fit
the concept of the Age of Sail, something that the Third Imperium in its
prime and the Rebellion setting never seemed to do for me. The Reformation
Coalition was an excellent "stand in" for the Europe of the Age of Sail. It
was apparent that the center would not hold and the different factions
within the RC would likely go to war. The Regency would have made an
excellent China: conservative and insular, the direct heir to a vanished age
 of glory and conquest... and so on.

Although the Third Imperium is frequently claimed to have an Age of Sail
atmosphere, I\'ve never seen any evidence of it, beyond the barest of
trappings. "Well, we\'ve got nobles in the Third Imperium, and there were
nobles in Age of Sail Europe. It takes a long time to get around in the
Third Imperium, and travel was slow during the Age of Sail."

Never mind me. Late night babbling. I would have loved to have seen both
halves of the background (the RC and the Regency) get fleshed out a little
better. Personally, I feel that the setting had alot of potential that the
Third Imperium setting could never have, because it is too static, and the
Rebellion could never have, because it is too chaotic.

Sure, some do, it\'s the frequency that things change and the actual things
that change themselves.

For example, TSR seems to come out with a new AD&D edition about once every
10 years. With the 2nd Edition, many of the additions were already in
existence as optional rules for at least five or six years.

Traveller, on the other hand, has come out with new editions a bit more
frequently, and each version has had a completely different rules set. It\'s
tough to get a foothold when the terrain keeps changing.

You betcha.  I needed to wrap my recently completed tome of "96 blank
pages" in a shiny new black cover (featuring some non-related Foss art, of
course).  I\'ve got at least _one_ interested buyer already ;)

OTOH, at least the OTU has followed a single continuum, from the Terran
Confederation, to the Rule of Man, through the Long Night, to the growth
and maturity of the 3d Imperium, to the MegaTraveller Rebellion, to the
ravages of Virus, and on into the New Era.  Players and referees could
always orient themselves, based on the time setting of their campaign. 
Even the G:T alternate setting builds on all that has gone before, with
the single difference that Dulinor does not assassinate Emperor
Strephon.

Meanwhile, the following settings/worlds have been used as TSR-published
D&D/AD&D settings in my memory:

Greyhawk
Mystara/Blackmoor (the early Blackmoor campaign was said to be in
Mystara\'s ancient past)
The Hollow Earth (a subset of Mystara, with little or no contact)
The Forgotten Realms
Dark Sun (I forget the name of the world in question)
Ravenloft

I may have forgotten a setting or two; if so I apologize to any fans of
settings I\'ve forgotten.

Bottom line:  Traveller has gone through major rule changes, in a single
evolving setting.  D&D/AD&D have gone through minor rule changes, in
multiple settings.  Which type of change is more disorienting?  I would
think that the latter is more difficult to assimilate than the former.

Not from what I understand... the PC tries once, fails and is resourceful
enough to think of another angle that also takes time, etc.  But I never
played MT (MT was the cause of my Traveller campaign going to full time
AD&D) a great deal, so I am working from memory.  Of course, you may also
deem it that way if the rules don\'t actually elaborate?

Yep!  Maps I used to lovingly draw on graphpaper with multi-coloured fine
tipped felts, notices and bulletins, scrolls, messages, etc... even created
a mini, hand bound spellbook for my wife\'s gnome with hand written spells
from the PHB.  A labour of love (I did similar things with Traveller --
dispatches, news print outs, want ads, etc.) and every bit worth it to my
outlook, judgeing by the player\'s responses (I\'m still turning away new
players who want to join my group based on former player\'s recommendations).

Yes, I needed a break for just a little while, just a few months (we
initially started playing every weekend in the old days, but I eventually
evolved it into a fortnightly thing--for my own sanity?) and had faced some
kind of pestering about starting it back up again.  Would have been easier
not to take the break :^)

Last time I looked, the TNE FF&S had stutterwarp...hold on, *had*?

You don\'t mean that the elite ninja MiB of the canon police are
going around removing the non-jump ftl pages from copies of FF&S?

Clearly my copy needs better security - perhaps I need to bring it to
work and prop it open at the stutterwarp pages.

setting when TSR killed it in the early 90\'s

These additional rules were added purely to create a richer environment in
the AD&D worlds. They did not revise existing rules as most of the Traveller
versions have done. So much material in Traveller is nothing more than a
rehash of existing rules. I realise that this is a necessity, with the
current state of affairs, as each version of Traveller introduces new
players, but if they could create a stable version and run with this for
more than a couple of years this wouldn\'t be a problem. How about something
original for a change?

I\'ll repeat my previous gripe. There simply isn\'t enough source material
available. I don\'t want rules. I want a more detailed universe rather than a
few subsector maps and system lists.Behind The Claw is to be applauded as it
is the first real attempt to detail a sector, but as the system info if
restricted to GURPS rules it doesn\'t interest me.

The sounds and songs of God from the hall next door every Saturday

What, you mean anything the ImpMarines can do, the Gurkhas can do in

Now there\'s an image to conjure with. :)

You want to try listening to the band of HM Royal Marines playing the
Imperial March from The Empire Strikes Back - it\'s a piece you wouldn\'t
want to hear them play in anger. It explains why all of the Imperials
are played by Brits. No bagpipes admittedly, but the effect is stunning.

Given the size of the Imperial Armed Forces you\'re going to have a lot
of military bands. Anyone have any idea how many? Or, for that matter,
what the ratio of bands/bandsmen to frontline troops?

Yessssssssss...  I also went for the easy out of saying it was Droyne (to
myself, I never told my players), but if I recall correctly, it contained
some fine wine or brandy or such that the PC\'s recognised as being from
<wherever> which begged the question of some of the clues making the vessel
accessible to stuff the adventurers "had access to" so why was the ship such
a mystery?

Myself, I\'d love to peg where it was really from.

And that is where AD&D has succeeded where Traveller has failed. Traveller
restricts the player to one setting and apart from the on-going timeline
changes there has been very little development of that setting. The worlds
in AD&D have been developed beautifully. I have played various campaigns in
the World of Greyhawk for over 15 years and have yet to find a better
location for roleplaying.

You mean it\'s easier to learn a whole tome of rules than it is to simply
adjust one or two actual rules?  I always found it more easier to read,
"Instead of This, it is applied as That..." several times than to digest all
of another rules set?  Maybe it\'s just me?  But I had a lot less trouble
switching to the change over in Merc\'s (LBB4) expanded chargen than I did
trying to learn all of MT.

Actually, it gets a *lot* more complicated than that. 

Electron/positron mutual annihilation produces gammas, because they are
elementary particles. Neutrons and protons *aren\'t* elementary
particles. They are composed of 3 quarks each. (red, green & blue for
normal mattter, anti-red, anti-green & anti-blue for antimatter). 

So when an anti-proton reacts with a proton or neutron, you get *one*
quark from each particle annihilating, and the remaining 4
re-organizing into mesons (quark/anti-quark pairs), usually neutral
pions. The pions are created with quite a bit of energy and move
several meters before decaying into other sorts of messons. Those will
travel more than a kilometer before decaying.

So a matter/antimatter reaction will be *very* spread out.

Just hit them with a low power particle beam. If they are antimatter,
it\'ll be obvious. :-)

Actually, "handling" those "pieces" is going to be a *real* problem.

How about some sort of formal version number  system  (like  FF&S
had "Mk 1 Mod 1").  For  example  "v5.1.2"  would  tell  you  the
product in question is for T5, its the  first  version,  but  the
second sub version (probably corrected typos and the  like).  And
print it  on  the  outside  cover  as  many  game  shops  I  know
shrink-wrap everything.

I always liked the idea that Harnworld used (don\'t know if it was
repeated in the Harn ruleset):  With each new product you cut off
the spine and hole-punched the sheets.  That way you could insert
new pages of source material into  the  right  sections  of  your
universe ring-binder.

Imagine being able  to  organise  your  Traveller  collection  by
Library Data, Atlas, Ship Compedium, Equipment, Adventure  Plots,
NPCs,  Character  Generation  Rules,  Other  Rules,  etc.   Then,
instead of buying semi-miscellaneous  soucebooks  and  adventures
(sourcebooks with plots), you could buy game modules  ...  which,
if an adventure, would list what other modules were  needed.  You
wouldn\'t have to search through several books to find the one bit
of information you need, and you  could  add  in  your  own  ship
designs/NPCs/whatever also in the right sections.

Such a system would mean more,  but  thinner,  products  ...  and
reduce the amount  of  duplicated  material  you  buy.  Those  on
limited budgets who don\'t collect everything with  a  "Traveller"
printed on the front could even control their  spending  by  just
buying those components they  need  for  their  campaign  (eg.  a
merchant prince campaign is unlikely to  need  the  fleet  combat
module).

Rulesets could then evolve  piece  by  piece,  instead  of  going
through major changes.  For example, if  task  definitions  don\'t
change then you could choose between the MT  task  system  of  T4
task system ... based on your own preferences.

Er, wouldn\'t the *ongoing* interaction with the solar wind ...

Different stars have different intensities of "solar wind". In a system
with a weak outflow, it may not be that noticeable.

> (b) "melt" away over time?

Fairly slowly. Remember that dust impacts will tend to soften" the
outlines of *any* asteroid.

And stellar wind "impacts" will tend to penetrate the surface before
reacting. A single proton, reacting a few mm below the surface won\'t
"soften" or melt much. 

If physical contact was possible, the surface would be "crunchy".

The unix \'unzip\' doesn\'t support the \'shrink\' format.  IIRC, it\'s due to a 
copyright problem in a library that PKWare used to make PKZip.

StarOffice is nice.  It handles Word9x format documents no problem, something
that the Linux port of Word Perfect doesn\'t.  And the price is right,
too.  <grin>  Dunno if Sun changed the pricing schedule when they aquired the
rights to it though, haven\'t checked yet...

I guess we need to know Shionthy\'s star  type  (haven\'t  got  the
books with me), and distence of  the  planetoid  belt.  Was  this
system ever defined in expanded form?

Okay, so "melt" was the wrong word, how about  "reduce"?  Or  are
you saying that the rate of reduction is  not  much  faster  than
normal abrasion?

If the rate of reduction is significant  then  the  existance  of
antimatter in this system must have started fairly "recently" ...
say the time of the Ancients.  If the rate of  reduction  is  not
significant then the antimatter *may* predate  the  Ancients  and
perhaps be a natural phenomenon.

Actually,  thinking  about  it  wouldn\'t  the  normal  chance  of
collision with normal matter  rocks  in  the  belt  pose  a  much
greater "reduction" rate?

Okay, so does anyone know where I can get a wintel utility to make tar
and gzip files? I\'ve got something which seems to make something called
tgz, but my knowledge of linux is sadly lacking.

I haven\'t seen a response to this so here goes:

Basically, _World Builder\'s Handbook_ is an amalgamation of the two with
lots of additional material and the text generally tidied up and the layout
improved.  (For example, WBH uses the DGP standard equipment sheets).

However, not everything made it into WBH.

Gone from _Grand Survey_:
- - cover picture
- - page of DGP Univeral Task Profile explanation
- - nearly three pages of examples of how to use the sensor control panels
- - the 3/4 page of using starship sensors in combat
- - the illustrations of vacc suits from TL9-15
- - 3/4 page of climate/weather detailing and tables for overcast and
precipitation and weather intensity and duration
- - page of geologic activity detailing with earthquakes and effects and a
volacano eruption table
- - page and half of movement rate tables, weather effects of movement and
other effects of world data on play
- - an index

Gone from _Grand Census_:
- - page of DGP Univeral Task Profile explanation
- - page of linguistics skill usage with DGP style example tasks that use
linguistics
- - 2 pages of notes on law, crime and punishment
- - 3/4 page of notes on minor races and a partial listing of minor races
(with references to Traveller materials where it\'s appeared)
- - page or so on \'roots of Imperial culture\'
- - one column on economics
- - Ethical Batar - an example religion
- - an index
- - colour version of Bwap meeting picture (WBH has it small and in b/w)


On the other hand, WBH did gain some extra material:

Added to _World Builder\'s Handbook_:
- - cover picture
- - IS Form 23 (replacing IS Form 20 and 22)
- - half page on the IISS in the Shattered Imperium
- - half page detailing the IISS field offices
- - half page sidebar defining \'lifeform\'
- - revised sensor readout panel (replacing two given in GS)
- - DGP style equipment sheets (NB: info transferred from earlier books but
better laid out)
- - Image Converter Binoculars, Floater and Remote Earpiece
- - MT details for the Kankurur G-carrier
- - MT Universal Craft Profile for the Donosev class survey vessel
- - intererior illos for the Donosev
- - various diagrams in the world building section
- - female scout illo


In addition some of the grainier illustrations from the earlier two books
have been removed.  No great losses, though the silhouetted explorers on
the horizon with a moon as backdrop (p.26) was disappointingly not
transferred.  Other illustrations were added.

Hope this helps.  I\'m ready to be corrected on any of the above as the
three books are a real pain to compare with their different layouts.

ScienceDaily has posted an article on a recent breakthrough
with neural nets. An excerpt is below.

- ---- quote ----
Machine demonstrates superhuman speech recognition abilities.
University of Southern California biomedical engineers have 
created the world\'s first machine system that can recognize 
spoken words better than humans can. A fundamental rethinking
of a long-underperforming computer architecture led to their
achievement...

In benchmark testing using just a few spoken words, USC\'s 
Berger-Liaw Neural Network Speaker Independent Speech
Recognition System not only bested all existing computer speech
recognition systems but outperformed the keenest human ears...

The system can distinguished words in vast amounts of random
"white" noise, noise with amplitude 1,000 times the strength of
the target auditory signal. Human listeners can deal with only a
fraction as much. And the system can pluck words from the
background clutter of other voices, the hubbub heard in bus
stations, theater lobbies and cocktail parties, for example.
Even the best existing systems fail completely when as little as
10 percent of hubbub masks a speaker\'s voice. At slightly higher
noise levels, the likelihood that a human listener can identify
spoken test words is mere chance. By contrast, Berger and Liaw\'s
system functions at 60 percent recognition with a hubbub level
560 times the strength of the target stimulus. With just a minor
adjustment, the system can identify different speakers of the
same word with superhuman acuity...

Sure, you and a number of other people have asked for the stats, I am in the
process of re-entering them on my current PC, the originals were done on a
long since dead Commodore 64.
If you like I can post them as they are done. Some were canon like the Far
Rebel class slow trader from "Hard Times" others are designs from my older
campaigns. For example I got a bit carried away in MT and designed a TL13
mobile grav kitchen - figure.

In Adventure 1 "Kinunir" the antimatter seemed to be found by the characters
ships hitting it. How they survived is hard to say. Also the Kinunir herself
was drifting in the belt with insufficient fuel to leave.

I think \'first real attempt\' is a little harsh on _Signal GK_ which was the
actual first attempt to detail an entire sector at this level.  Indeed,
given that it included UWPs and had longer entries, you could easily argue
that it had *more* detail.

However, first *single volume* attempt would be fair as _Signal GK_ took a
number of issues to cover the material.

granting that no-one has actually produced such a volume!)

This is agoing to be a huge, huge area of medicine in the coming years. Just
look at the performance of companies like QLT Phototherapeutics...

	Mining gas giants for hydrogen, helium, and hydrocarbons
	(not to mention various trace elements) has been a common 
	feature of MTU.  Most are orbital stations with "skimmers,"

Seth,

I documented the differences in system generation details in a prior 
message on the TML last year, addressed to Jef Zeitlin (sp?), who was 
working on the GT: First In book at the time.

I\'ll try to dig it up for you, unless someone with access to their 
archive files can beat me to it.  Hopefully, tonight, if all works 
well.  There are some minor differences at various points, but both 
work well, and the results are mutually exchangable, so whatever 
works best for you, go for it.

More later as I dig up the material.

There\'s no reason the most recent crew would necessarily be from the same
species as the builders.  Ships do change hands in Traveller, by (how
shall I put this) various mechanisms. :)  Also, while there was no
indication where the ship was *originally* from, there was a map chip for
the interdicted world Victoria down in Lanth (or was it Vilis?  I\'m typing
this at work) subsector.  So one could posit that the ship had at least
most recently come into Regina subsector from rimward.

My major problem with making it a Droyne ship is that it seemed built for
humans.  There were no perching bars, for example, and the doorways were
all human-scaled and -proportioned.

It will gradually turn the asteroid to powder, like any sort of radiation.  The real problem is collisions, though -- a microgram of sand will produce a 90 terajoule explosion, which is enough to vaporize small asteroids and shatter objects of significant size.

Okay, so does anyone know where I can get a wintel utility to make tar
and gzip files? I\'ve got something which seems to make something called
tgz, but my knowledge of linux is sadly lacking.

Thanks.  Now given the collision problem I  think  its  a  fairly
safe bet to say the antimatter is a  recent  phenomenon,  so  its
probably left over from the  Ancient  War.  Therefore  there  was
presumeable a planet destroyed here ... and I think it  likely  a
habitable one.

Thus, the issue of detectability becomes  defined  as:  how  much
radiation "glow" will come from an antimatter object when exposed
to the typical level of solar wind from an M4 star at a  distance
equal to its habitable zone?  And more to the point, how easy  is
it to detect that level of "glow" with ship sensors?

The secondary issue ... a reality  check  ...  would  be:  is  it
plausable for antimatter objects to survive in  a  normal  matter
planetoid belt for that length of  time?  Failure  of  this  test
would suggest that:
(a) whatever created the  antimatter  is  more  recent  than  the
    Ancient War, or ...
(b) something is creating fresh \'supplies\' or  antimatter  in  an
    ongoing process, or ...
(c) the destroyed planet was in the outer system, or ...
(d) something else.

IMO T:2300 and 2300AD are not "Traveller". Traveller is the universe of the
Imperium. 2300 is the universe of post Twilight 2000.

The big difference is that 2300 is *hard* SF, unlike Traveller.

The ships are based on CJ Cherryh\'s universe, so the stuts are \'Jump
Vanes\', which are cycled to take the ship up to FTL speeds and back. There
is a debate on the the Cherryhlist at the moment as to their effect in
realspace. Her books imply that the vanes can produce enormous changes of
Delta-V, and there is also a debate on the reaction mass/fuel used
(currently water is the favourite)

It is part of the feel of Traveller, especially CT. GDW *PROMISED* an area
where CT/MT\'s 3rd Imp CONTINUES ON, not where democracy eliminates the
nobility. GDW Lied.

Well, upon hearing what their characters would know about virus, every PC
in my game took a shoot-first approach to even "Barking Stuffed Toys". The
ones in the rulebook, BTW, make excellent enemies, but not great tools for
PC\'s, and are just powerful enough to become fully virused. Add  a lack of
robot creation rules, and it sure as h*ll looks like the idea of robots as
useful tools went right out the window.

>That\'s strange. I thought that Virus actually was the resolution of the
>Rebellion storyline, at least as the resolution was imagined by GDW.

No, it wasn\'t a resolution, but a means of wiping the slate clear... and
there is a difference. Hard times was a continuing resolution; it continued
the thematic elements of the civil war, the madness of lucan, the
destruction of life, and the hardships and hopes of a resored 3i.

TNE, and Virus were seen by many (effectively everyone I know FTF who\'s
conversant with traveller) as a way of saying "It doesn\'t matter who should
have won, who would have won or how, we\'re just going to do something
entirely new, and coopt you into buying it because it has the Traveller
name."

I remember many of us on the CT/MT based X-Boat list were lobbying for
similar treatment of New Era as 2300 had gotten: Don\'t kill it, just
declare it "Something other than Traveller." Hell, I\'d lobbied against the
switch from MT to T2K mechanics as soon as I heard about it... sent a
"please don\'t" letter with some 7+ signatories to GDW. Having run TNE
(players wanted to try it), I can honestly say it was such a bad set of
rules my players DEMANDED a change of rules (The votes went 3 mt, 2 GURPS,
1 for CT, 2 abstensions... I reverse engineered the conversion back to MT
from the guidelines to convert to TNE in SM).

I could see that the antimatter was surrounded with a protective membrane,
similar to a magnetic bottle to prevent it from interacting with casual
particle bombardment.  Such a protective layer could stop solar winds and
small particles but anything with the mass of a starship would
breach/rupture it.  Grandfather could have isolated the antimatter chunks in
these protective encapsulations to prevent them from occasionally exploding
and disturbing his experiments.

Then again, if grandfather could encapsulate antimatter in such a way, the
antimatter might have been deliberately placed as a sort of mine field to
interfere with and discourage people from poking around near his hiding
place.  This would explain both protecting the antimatter from minor
particle collisions and detection.  In this scenario, I would assume that
the antimatter would be replaced from time to time as needed.

No orbital distance is given, but we can assume that the belt is in either 
the habitable or outer zones, since the M4-V star it orbits really has no 
inner zone. An outer zone placement also improves the survivability of the 
antimatter, since the star\'s output is further reduced.
 GT:Behind the Claw describes the system rather well without going into hard 
numbers. The Red zoning is strictly navigational according to official 
sources, so the 70 million moon and belt miners in-system are quite 
legitimate and Imperial...

Sometimes such projects are purely civilian in execution and have immediate
civilian returns, but are prompted by military needs. The Interstate Highway
system in the United States was initially proposed and funded by congress as
a method by which military transport needs of the Armed Forces could be met.
In other words the interstates were built so that the military industrial
complex could easily move men and material from state to state. In the
nineteenth century some countries built railroads for the same reason. (The
French specifically chose the gauge of the railroad so as to make it
difficult for German rail equipment to use it, to deny the German military
use of this asset during an invasion. It didn\'t work.)

Obtrav: The Imperium, during it\'s expansion phase, would take possession of
existing Starports. Sometimes it would claim jurisdiction over whole
systems, like Naval Depot systems. What about strategically located systems
with only marginally habitable worlds or only belts. Does the Imperial
Government directly fund Starports and logistic support?

As will Army independent brigades and regiments.  A division would
probably have 50 or so band members (out of 15,000 or so personnel
total).  That\'s just a WAG, though....

IRL, the wartime missions of the band in US Army divisions are to
provide a security force for the division CP, and to assist in EPW
handling.

Just what I, as an interrogator, would _want_ handling my sources:  a
band playing the pipes!  ("If you don\'t want to answer my questions,

Nothing this gritty /and/ kinky in hard science could really be considered

least IMHO.

The box is physically the size of the Starter Edition, Tarsus and Beltstrike
(about 1" thick), but it looks like the Deluxe Traveller box, right down to
saying "Deluxe Edition" and having the number "300" on it.  When you open it
up you find the Starter Edition books that are 8.5x11" (2 books) plus the
Spinward Marches map, Imperial Fringe, Book 0, and a strange little 8-page
"Additional Rules" booklet.  No double adventure booklet.  An explanation
sheet inside the box says:

"Additional Rules is and 8-page compilation of extra rules which appear in
Basic Traveller or The Traveller Book, but are not included in the Starter
Traveller rules booklet.  Additional Rules provides complete compatibility
with all Traveller Rules sets."

The copyright date is "1981, 1984" on the Additional Rules, which I suspect
means that Deluxe Starter was first published in 1984.  This set actually
has everything that you\'d expect to find in the Deluxe Traveller and does
not *need* to be distinguished from the edition with 5 LBBs, but for the
hopeless, completist collector...

I think when you are responsible for producing the latest revision of someone
else\'s work you have to have some degree of humility about the stuff that was
originally there. Dave Nilsen doesn\'t seem to have had it. One of the big
things about TNE was that the Traveller nobility oughtn\'t to exist because that
was just plain wrong. Presumably if he\'d got a hold of Paranoia he\'d have got
rid of that mad old computer as well. It\'s like having someone come round to
your house and watch them go round straightening all your pictures.

To be fair, there weren\'t any proper robot rules for MT either. Book 8 and 101
Robots were CT supplements - robots were always something that DGP were just
about getting round to (given their production schedules it would be hitting
the shelves just about now).

The virus was the resolution of the rebellion storyline in the same way that
the Yucatan impact was the culmination of dinosaur evolution. At a stroke
something very rich and with considerable further potential was wiped out.

Er, there\'s Chuck Gannon\'s guide to Diaspora, with extra detail he supplied in
Traveller Chronicle. There are some other detailed attempts which don\'t go
world by world, such as Solomani Rim in Traveller Chronicle, Far Frontiers in
Ares and Traveller Chronicle, Gateway in MT Digest 4. Plus there are the JAK
subsector guides to Caledon and Drexilthar.

Adding my .02cr...

I just got my hands on a copy of MT Journal #4.  In the letter from Joe F.,
it was mentioned that Marc Miller didn\'t have much to do with TNE, AND that
TNE was the reason why DGP got out of the Traveller business entirely.  I\'m
guessing that there were some burnt bridges and sore feelings all the way
around about it.  Somehow, I suspect that if MWM had been involved with TNE,
it may have been an entirely different product...  at least I for one might
be using it for other than background material.

I believe that there are ports for Wintel of gzip/gunzip; I
_know_ there are Wintel ports of tar.  Best bet is to check
Simtel or any of the other _really_ _big_ multi-platform
archives.

However: That tgz utility you have is quite acceptable - a tgz
file is a tar file that has subsequently been gzipped.

Aha! I acquired a loose copy of that booklet in a recent lot of stuff I
purchased. I wondered whether that was where it had come from. 

Contents:
- - additional personal combat rules (archaic firearms)
- - extended starship construction rules (custom ships)
- - vector based starship combat
- - additional events for encounter tables
- - experience rules
- - drugs rules
- - 4 TAS forms (3 front, 3 reverse, 4, 7)
- - some extra equipment.

Right, that goes in the nearest Starter Traveller box.

Er, yes. (shuffles feet, looks down sheepishly)

That was probably the nature of the companies - GDW was run by games designers
and TSR was run by businessmen. GDW\'s one attempt to stick by a set of "house
rules" (T2000/2300/DC) faltered, mainly because they ignored the more
proven set of rules (CT) they had sitting on the shelf. 

And I still think the
characteristic generation using playing cards has to be the worst idea I\'ve
ever seen.

Having said that, I do think it\'s more important to have a strong "default"
background for a sci-fi game than for a fantasy game. One game I have on the
shelf, Star Hero, has what many people would regard as very good rules (if
you\'re coming from the GURPS game balance direction), as well as an excellent
cover by the great Janet Aulisio (check out the covers to, eg, Challenge
31/32), but an entirely dismal background, and hence doesn\'t work at all.

(Don\'t flame me for this, I\'m just repeating someone else\'s ideas).

Based on what Dave Nilsen has said on the TNE-RCES list, the first part of
your statement is true.  Dave joined GDW long after the history of the
Rebellion and Hard Times had been written.  He believed that the Rebellion
story-line had thoroughly morally discredited every faction and that allowing
any of them to win would have been wrong.  He also said that the Imperium
itself had shown itself to be rotten at the core for allowing itself to
implode and take so many sophonts with it.  He pointed out that the Imperium
had survived the entire Civil War period relatively sanguinely as the Imperial
bureaucracy and much of the nobility stayed on the sidelines and thus kept the
violence contained.  The fact that in the Rebellion nearly everyone in a
position of responsibility in the Imperium seemed so eager to declare for a
faction and slay their fellow Imperial citizens seemed to him to be a sign of
a deep sickness.  A fresh start was called for, and the Regency and Reformation
Co! al!ition were it.

Dave also said that the nature of the TNE setting was driven partly by market
considerations.  GDW wanted to bring new blood into Traveller and he said
they kept hearing people complain that the Traveller background was too
complex and turned off new players, who felt they needed to own every copy of
JTAS and Traveller\'s Digest to play.  Furthermore, the scope of the 3I setting
was so big, individuals couldn\'t have much influence over it.  TNE was supposed
to appeal to new, younger players who would like the smaller setting with a
clear mission and outlets for the combat-oriented that didn\'t involve turning
pirate.  (Remember that Twilight:2000 had been a run-away hit, and this
probably had some influence over both the setting and House Rules adoption).

As for my own personal opinion, I liked TNE\'s story-line and my players loved
it.  It worked as advertised for pulling in a new group of players who
otherwise probably wouldn\'t have played Traveller.  I also liked the rules.
Brilliant Lances is great.  FF&S and the TNE combat rules provided a seamless
system that went from small arms to spinal mounts in a way no other Traveller
rules set has.  Whether it was necessary to alienate people who loved the 3I
and "Old Era" Traveller, I don\'t know.  The TNE setting could easily have been
put into an alternate universe, but I don\'t think GDW had the man-power or
distribution to support two sci-fi RPGs simultaneously.

It\'s all water under the bridge now.  TNE is as dead as every other non-GURPS
version of Traveller.  Traveller is dead, long live Traveller!

AuricTech Shipyards, LIC, was founded on Sylea in 006 by Marcus
Weishaupt, a businessman of Solomani ancestry.  Its first contract was
to construct standard 100-ton scout/couriers for the Imperial
Interstellar Scout Service (IISS).  Within 5 standard years, AuricTech
began building ships designed in-house.  The first commercially
successful AuricTech design was the C20-2 light transport, a 100-ton
ship that carries 20 middle passengers at up to jump-2.  The first of
the Electra series of 1000-ton yachts (procured by the Imperial Navy as
the Isabel class VIP transport/C3I ship) cemented AuricTech Shipyards\'
reputation as a producer of quality civilian and military ships.

AuricTech products in the early decades of the Imperium range from the
UA-1 and UA-2 30-ton ships boats to the 160,000-ton Agincourt class
battleship.

As the Imperium has expanded, AuricTech has shifted its main base of
operations to the Spinward Marches.  By 1100, AuricTech is a major
supplier of cruisers to the Imperial Navy and IISS, with shipyards at
Mora, Trin, and Lunion.  AuricTech Shipyards has remained a player in
the civilian market, and has recently signed a contract with Thermopylae
Lines to provide several new designs of freighters and passenger
liners.  For examples of AuricTech designs, see:

http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Shadowlands/9776/travler.html

Current ownership (as of 1100): Hortalez et Cie 24%, Noble Families 22%,

 Aha! I acquired a loose copy of that booklet in a recent lot of stuff I

 - additional personal combat rules (archaic firearms)
 - extended starship construction rules (custom ships)
 - vector based starship combat
 - additional events for encounter tables
 - experience rules
 - drugs rules
 - 4 TAS forms (3 front, 3 reverse, 4, 7)

Not learning this simple truth hurt Hewlett-Packard as well.  They could
have had Apple Computers but lacked the vision to move beyond the pale to

The plethora of rules editions, changes, what\'s canon, what isn\'t canon was
just too much for me to keep up with. I stopped looking at Traveller versions
after MegaTraveller. With all the wonderful stuff that was produced for it, (OK,
so after I fixed the errata), both by GDW and DGP, I was happy with the level
of stuff I had. 

I understand that games companies need to be in business, but I say that
I don\'t need to pander to their profitability in buying everything new when it comes
out. I\'ll leave this to new blood, and to the collectors here.. I had my game, and
all I want to do is play it.

I first got involved with the TML just after getting out of the army in 96, and since 
then the quantity of information I have available for CT and MT is just phenomenal.
And then people like Stuart, Tom, Hugh and Jesse give us access to their work,
and I have even more fantastic stuff. Why on earth would I need more stuff.

My major gripe is that Gurps (spit) is invalidating DGP\'s work (due to Mr Sanger,
I agree, but they\'re still making it non canon), and it isn\'t even Traveller. It\'s just
a campaign pack for a second rate system. DGP\'s stuff was brilliant, and if my
using it makes my campaign non canonical, so be it. I\'ll join up with Eris\' gang!

I\'ll leave you guys to argue about what version\'s best, and I\'ll get on with playing
MT regularly, and spending my hard earned cash on other more important things
that my wife says I can spend it on!!!!! ;-)

The best thing about GURPS rules is that everything (practically) is
optional. You can fiddle with the rules and use just what you want. You only
need 6d and you can play everything from Man-to-Man style play-by-play
combat to quick combat resolution via a single defense roll. Task system is
quick and simple, or involved and complex. Pick it.

I especially like the ability to fine tune your character. You can develop
as detailed a history as you want, learn, have a career, and even have a
side-kick. And you can create an ex-career military character who knows
nuclear physics, electronic sensor and control systems, computers, ship
propulsion systems, small arms and vehicle weapons and is a specialist in
history (or at least has a degree in it.) That would be me. It would be
difficult to create a character with these diverse skills in most game
systems. In GURPS its easy. (Of course you have to take Absent-Mindedness,
Bad-Temper, Overconfidence and Lecherousness in order to get enough points.
:^) )

I was under the impression that meson screen modules were accumulative. To

There are no UWP\'s, but generally material in GT:BTC is system neutral. An
exception is information about Jubilee Year, which of course is
Non-Rebellion timeline specific. Most of this information is limited to the
sidebars. I would expect that most of the information could be used in any
campaign happening after the FFW and before the Rebellion. Specific world
info would be good for most any setting, including post Rebellion.

Well, we seem to be getting a whole list of clues here, Could it have been
built by a multi-racial or singular non-humanoid race with the intent of
crewing it or selling it /to/ humanoids.

These are actually quite a few clues posted so far, has anyone kept track?
Eris probably, as he mentioned curiousity over the issue. The map chip for

Ahhhhhhh... what memories... reentering old C64 data to a newer,

This is also a problem in potential. As many a Rolemaster, Hero, or SFB 
player (and a fair number of AD&D players) can attest, there is no such thing 
as an "optional rule." Every rule in the book, optional or not, stands a good 
chance of being used if a player benefits from it. GURPS has the same 
problem. I don\'t consider this an automatically bad thing, but it takes a 
certain level of gaming maturity to consciously NOT use rules.

The fact is that every edition of Traveller has made changes (consider

I just recalled some more clues (from memory of course...)

*A hydroponic vegetation deck (for food I\'d assumed, but nothing was ever
said was there?).  Fresh vegies or research?  Perhaps it was a yacht??
**How about the little toy robot that every player I ran through the game
shot and killed (errrr, destroyed :)  What shape was that?
***The drawing on the door?  Was it if a snake?  Humanoids?
****The two Star Trek-like pods that were actually common ship\'s
boats/pinnaces?

In the early days, I took the easy out by "assuming" it was Droyne, but now,
as pointed out above, I\'m not so sure... I never had real info about Droyne
back then, and it was easy to overlook that furnishings and controls were
not described as particularly "alien" to humans.

The vessel was alien enough not to be known to anyone in Imperial space, but
it could have been a custom design too?  But no-one knew the text of the
markings either?  The thick plottens??

Errrr... how\'s the memory holding up so far?

Snapshot and Mayday are as far as anyone ever needs to stray into optional
rules systems.  If you can\'t get along with the wealth of information in
Books 1 thru 5 then you are seriously lacking in imagination.  Now, if
you\'ll excuse me, I need to go retape my little black box.

I believe you meant to say "Books 1 thru _6_"....  ;-)

(I have never looked at Books 7 or 8, so I don\'t know what utility they
may have.)

"Greyhawk" is more accurate -- there weren\'t even Thieves in the original

Your point of order is well made, sir; all those who have ever played
any D&D/AD&D characters who belonged to classes other than Fighters,
Magic-Users, or Clerics will report to the grog bowl.... ;-)

I bought TNE and read it (in fact, I bought most of the material and still
own it (*)) and several things struck me:

<IMO - you\'re unlikely to change my views on this so don\'t flame me on list>

1) The audacity of Virus - its shear scope and destructive capacity across
everything. This first hit me reading _survival margin_. Virus destroys the
entire background.

2) The \'clunky\' feel of the rules - MT suffered from errata, but somehow
always seemed more elegant than the GDW House system. This suffered in the
area GDW always seemed weak in particularly - personal combat. T2k (1st ed)
had the same problem, as did 2300, 1889 and CT. The \'buckets of dice\'
autofire suffered from the same issues as the massed det laser attacks seen
in 2300\'s Star Cruiser. I disliked the rules from trying them out with my
group. We went back to MT, and now use T4 with the playtest mods and HG.

3) The poorer layout - this was less clear than CT or MT. Nowhere near as
bad as T4 or SLA Industries though.

4) The lack of an out of the box starship design sequence for the game.

5) HePLAR and the death of T-plates. I\'ve said it before.

In the end, the background didn\'t enthuse me or my players. The rules
system felt intrusive and wrong, so we went back to Milieu 1100/1120 and MT.

(*) I like the TNE supplements and the idea of Clippers, and the idea of
rebuilding a lost past. The books are good sources. But nothing for TNE,
not even the Regency Sourcebook, invoked the feelings that Hard Times and
Arrival Vengeance\'s encounter with Strephon did. Hard Times felt like a
more plausible and playable rebuilding scenario.

</IMO - you\'re unlikely to change my views on this so don\'t flame me on list>

2300 and T2300 *did not* use the GDW house rules system and had more in
common with MT.

T2k (2nd Ed), DC, Dinosaurs and erm... all used the house system.

Huh? A microgram is 1e-6 grams. That\'s 1e-9 *kg*. Which gives an energy
release of 2e-9*(3e8)^2. Which is 1.8e8 joules. 180 megajoules is
nowhere *near* 90 terajoules. Nor is it enough to disrupt a large body.

Also, nobody is sure how macroscopic quantities of matter/anti-matter
will react. It\'s quite possible that at first contact the initial
annihilations will be sufficient to push the masses apart before any
great amount of mass is converted.

Also, as noted in my other post, the energy release tends to be spread
over a *large* area. That too will make things rather different than
expected.

Signal GK (the magazine, not the adventure) was detailing a sector, and
doing a good job of it too. The materials was a bit dark, and I didn\'t like
the cyberpunk bits (which were easily omitted), but there was far more
published than you\'ll find in BtC. (You\'ll also need a magnifying glass,
some of the library data entries are tiny.)

I can barely agree with you. I\'d rather have had more information about
fewer worlds. A single paragraph gives me just enough to cramp my style,
while still leaving me a lot of work to detail the system.

Also, BtC ignored GDW-published material. For example, the world of Craw
was detailed in two articles by the Keith brothers (JTAS 5 & 6, I think). A
map, wih full workup of geography, climate, history, population, culture,
politics, and biology. Lots of neat stuff, and it was ignored in favour of
a single uninspiring paragraph. It would have been dead easy to write a
single paragraph that was compatible with the Keith\'s work, thus preserving
consistency.

I don\'t see any problem there. It could have been built on commission  --
BY Droyne, but FOR humans. My main problem with the ANNIC NOVA is the magic
capacitors that allow a jump charge to be built up over several weeks.
Regulars to the TML will remember the problems such capacitors represent

But since Marc Miller has stated on the TML that Shionthy was the location
of Eskaloyt, that has to be a mistake. I don\'t have my copy of _Droyne_
here, but IIRC it states what range Eskaloyt\'s sun must have fallen into.
Shionthy\'s sun must fall into that range. I\'ll check when I get home.

Somebody else posted this a few days ago, but I guess you must have missed
it: According to _Secret of the Ancients_, p. 23, that Shionthy was
converted to an asteroid belt during the Final War.

(This does present a small problem, since Marc Miller in a post on the TML
stated that Eskaloyt used to be in the Shionthy system, but was pincehed
off into a pocket universe and still survives in that. My own explanation
for this is that Grandfather had a decoy Escaloyt ready and switched the
two when whichever Kid it was laubched his attack on the planet.)

Are you sure your FLGS owner didn\'t misunderstand the original information?
_Traveller 2300_ quite obviously didn\'t belong to the Traveller timeline,
and I believe GDW got a lot of (well-deserved) flack from people who had
quite naturally assumed from the name that it would. As I understand it,
that was the reason for the name change.

Oddly enough, this was one of the few things i liked.

With t-plates, ships are just magic caprpets that occassionly get boarded.
With HePLAR, it started to feel like space travel.  You needed to pay

Oh, okay. You\'ve clarified the position to some extent, going from the idea
TNE removed robots from the setting (David\'s own words: "- no robots") to
robots weren\'t in the game the way that DGP envisioned them.

Yes. It was a resolution. The issue of the Rebellion was resolved. However,
instead of trying to redefine the concept of resolution, you simply say it
was a resolution you didn\'t like, or found implausible.

Personally, I\'m not going to go there, and you won\'t here a peep from me if
you said you don\'t like the way it was handled. I don\'t consider myself an
arbiter of taste.

You do realize that with the change of only few words your statement
concerning Hard Times can be applied to TNE from the RC view.

"TNE was a continuing resolution; it continued the thematic elements of the
civil war, the madness of lucan, the destruction of life, and the hardships
and hopes of a restored 3i."

I always thought that Mr. Nilsen\'s opinion was that nobody would have won;
the strife in the Third Imperium was simply too widespread.

That\'s an important distinction to make. If it\'s simply the opinion of an
author, and he implausibly thrusts democratization into the setting, I can
agree that it\'s a bad thing. However, if it can be rectified with other
events in the storyline (such as a civil war between petty nobles that ended
up killing billions, maybe even trillions of sophonts) the opinion of Dave
Nilsen no longer matters as much.

I have to disagree, simply because it makes sense in the context of the
storyline that TNE presents to us.

Your mixing your terms here. Resolution and culmination are not synonymous.
"Something very rich and with considerable further potential" is not how I,
personally, would describe the Third Imperium or the Rebellion setting. I do
understand where you\'re coming from though.

Another problem with a system having so many optional rules is keeping
track of which ones are actually being used.  This can be especially
confusing when two or more campaigns are running simultaneously under two
or more referees-- of which prefer different rule sets.

More so that playing in two Traveller campaigns, one used modified MT rules
and another using TNE?  I\'ve seen enough evidence of people using optional
and house rules here that I think it\'s really unfair to single out GT for
loathing on this basis.

the ENTIRE MT and Hardtimes era, much to my current regret. 

I did like some things /promised/ by TNE... 

One of the most important was exploration.. in my opinion CT had hemmed
the Imperium in too tightly and left no room for expansion or
exploration, I\'d rather have seen corridors between the various
"empires" to allow more exploration and interact between the races as
they vied for ownership of new worlds (this was one of my house
modifications).

I also didn\'t agree with population EVERY world (ok, ok maybe it was
only most of them but it seem that the best worlds were already full, no
chance for colonization).

TNE when I first saw it, seemed to offer this, with Virus depopulating
the universe. Deeper reading of the later material dispelled this to a
point, most worlds were still populated, just with a devolved
technology. Still, since it was the unknown, exploration was again
possible.

I liked (loved) FFS and the alternate tech rules it contained. This
was/is something I believe Traveller has always and will always need! It
adds to the exotic feel of a race if they do "something different" than
the norm. 

What I didn\'t like...

THe rule set. I thought it was rather much clunkier than the original
Traveller. Not bad just much more complicated. I would rather have used
GURPS (which is as complicated but I already knew those rules.)

Virus was too powerful.

I countered this by projecting a high tech island that learned how to
"tame" Virus and turned it against itself.

There\'s more but that gives the idea.

MT and Hardtimes I\'ve discovered since joining this list. I\'ve kicked
myself repeatedly for missing some of the best of Traveller. THe setting
also allowed re exploration, by breaking the Imperium into smaller more
manageable chuncks. I agree that given the size of competing empires
there was a greater potential for war than wa ever used. This might have
been how it was to end with a strong leader finally re-uniting the
Imperium in the face of a true external threat. who can know.

It feels more "Traveller" than TNE did. to me. Not a jab, nor a flame,
just my personal opinion!

Anyway that\'s enough meandering for mow.

I\'ve never seen FF&S, but perhaps this is the source I need. One of my very
few and very minor problems with Traveller is that all cultures, all races,
and all eras seem to use identical technologies, just to different degrees,
and perhaps a few cultural prohibitions. When I was running my short-lived
Star Wars campaign, I inserted technologies from every sci-fi game I had on
hand, and threw some house rules together to cover ideas I had read in
fiction. How close to CT is FF&S? What extras are covered? Is there a better
source book? How many editions of FF&S are there, and which is the "best"? I
would really like some guidelines for roughing out my "heresy zone" the
Farcast Sector.

I disagree that this is really a problem, since that\'s not the way GURPS is
really set up. The vast majority of the optional rules are intended to
impart a certain flavor upon a campaign world (the duelling rules and the
Wild West gunfight rules, for example).

If a GM is so weak-willed that he allows players to walk all over him with
optional rules, it\'s his fault, not the fault of the game system. Likewise,
if the players are incapable of understanding that the rules the GM uses for
his game are being used for a reason, again, it\'s their fault, not the fault
of the system.

A minor problem, at best. Most people tweak the rules of whatever system
they\'re using anyway, and the use of optional rules (or even house rules)
has never really presented a problem as far as I\'ve encountered, except
among the extremely immature.

Ain\'t that the Truth!  If a GM doesn\'t handle it properly, he can easily 
be accused of deliberately making the player\'s life a living H*ll if he 
doesn\'t allow an optional rule that benefits the player.

civilization, with a recovery starting at the beginning of the time my

Unless Dave Nilsen was claiming to be hearing the voices of Deneb\'s huddled
masses in his head (something which would explain alot), then I really think he
ought to take responsibility. That is to say, you\'re missing the point. We
could get into an argument about whether the regency democracy is plausible or
for that matter workable. Certainly the people of the former 3I didn\'t set it
up - the aristocracy, specifically Norris, had to surrender power.

But DN was the responsible author, and he is largely responsible for the far
more implausible and more sweeping changes (virus, the recharacterisation of
Norris and Strephon) that allow the democratisation to take place. In the
process he once again imposed his own, very different, view of Traveller on a
large number of GMs running CT/MT campaigns at the time, and who had been
repeatedly promised by GDW a place very similar to the classic imperium to ease
the transition to the new era. 

I recognise a number of people actually like the TNE setting, and a slightly
smaller number of people like the TNE rules. It remains the fact that GDW
seriously let down their "installed base", and to say that the changes in TNE
were dictated only by the circumstances of the setting is ridiculous.

I believe you meant to say "Books 1 thru _7_"....  ;-)

Book 7 is the Merchant Prince Supplement ie the expansion for Merchants
equivalent to Mercenary, HG, Scouts.

Book 8 is Robots and not really relevant as a core system. Striker is
equally applicable.

Cute, but I don\'t think that I missed the point. To put it simply: If, in
fact, the concept of the democratization of the Regency was something that
was part of the natural course of the storyline, whether or not Dave Nilsen
thought that the nobility system was wrong is irrelevant.

Norris had to surrender power for what reason? Could it have been to keep
the Regency from falling apart?

Fair enough. I don\'t disagree on this point too much. However, those changes
were effectively made and locked into place, with the publication of the TNE
rulebook. Once the changes to the setting were made, the setting has to
remain plausible within that framework.

He imposed nothing on anybody, since I must missed those days when the GDW
shock troops went from door to door forcing Traveller players to use the TNE
materials in their campaigns.

In the same vein, for some time I used Marc Miller\'s T4 to run a campaign in
the late 3I. I never felt imposed upon to use Milieu 0 as a setting.

Being one of the "installed base" that wasn\'t seriously let down, this
"fact" is news to me.

To press the point further, I don\'t appreciate words being put into my
mouth. I never saud that "the changes in TNE were dictated by the
circumstances of the setting." What I did say was the democratization of the
Regency was dictated by the New Era\'s setting. I still maintain that.

It\'s interesting how the other side in this argument has to constantly
recast its arguments. The idea that TNE had "no robots" becomes the idea
that there are no robots in the main rulebook that can be considered to be
useful tools for the player characters. The idea that TNE offered no
resolution to the Civil War becomes the idea that they offered a resolution
that some people didn\'t like... etc, etc.

 There you go, putting words in my mouth.  I meant no such thing.  All these
new-fangled \'80s books are superfluous.  One has to carefully watch that
questionable 1979 stuff, too.  That\'s when they started making references to
the lame "imperium" background idea.  I told people that that foolishness

It always \'felt\' like a yacht to me.  Not much cargo space, no obvious
major weapons or armor, no lab space or large sensor arrays, lots of
living space...hard to read it as anything other than a pleasure craft.

Wish I still had the supplement to check.  I seem to recall it as
humanoid.

Menacing fanged snake.  Drawn in crayon in a childish hand, and on the
door where a victim of some plague was living.  The clear backstory to me
is that the family on board got sick one by one; to help the child (not
yet sick) remember not to go into the quarantined room, the parents or
guardians had him/her draw his own "keep out" sign, figuring doing it
personally would make it more meaningful and memorable.  Again, drawing
tools, style, and psychology look entirely human- (and perhaps even
specifically Solomani-) normal.

That was a fun one. :)

The markings do thicken things a lot.  The only credible scenario I can
come up with is that the ship was built by some race \'unknown\' in the
Marches (perhaps on record in the databanks, but not immediately
recognizeable), and subsequently somehow came into the hands of a human
family (or family-like group) who somehow reached the Marches before being
infected with and dying of a virulent plague.  The Victoria map chip
suggests they were moving more or less coreward through the Marches --
unless that\'s where they were *heading*.  Hm.

> Errrr... how\'s the memory holding up so far?

About as well as mine, I think. :)

The origional FF&S is for TNE (about as far from CT as posible I suppose).
but a little thought should allow for conversion. There is also FFS2 for T4
but it doesn\'t include the optional technology and is extremely difficult to
read if you don\'t have FFS1 for comparison.

This book is IMO both the best design book in traveller and the only reason
to muck around with TNE.

Included are many alternate FTL technologies, alternate M-Drive
technologies,
and design sequences for everything from snub pistols to spinal mounts.
It doesn\'t cover wet navy though (that\'s the only reason to muck about with
FFS2.)

Lots of grist for any "heresy zone"

Well, the description of the Quarters deck support that conclusion.  Items

The book doesn\'t mention fangs, just the coiled snake.  My take was that
the child copied the caduceus from medical gear after the adults all fell
sick.

CT and T4 had a few basic prices for food and lodging. I can\'t remember of
MT and TNE did too, but I think they did. They were:

Starvation level: Minimum food, Cr60. Dismal lodging, Cr60.
Subsistence level: Reasonable food, Cr120. Acceptable lodging, Cr180.[*] 
Ordinary level: Good food, Cr200. Good lodging, Cr200.
Good living: Fine food, Cr400. Fine lodging, Cr400.
High living: Luxury food, Cr600+. Luxury lodging, Cr600+.

[*] Or it may have been food 180, lodging 120, I can\'t remember.

>live in parks/on the street/in the gutters/etc.

Ah, but these people aren\'t SL 1. That is, I know that they have to be SL 1,
because the Imperium dosen\'t allow SL 0 (slaves). However, people living on
the street can get by with the Cr60 for food alone (plus an unknown amount
for other basic necessities). Yet the Cr250/SL rule requires them to spend
Cr250. And if they only spend, say, Cr100, they lose a SL. But they can\'t
get any lower than SL 1, so they won\'t lose it after all...

At SL 2 you\'re already well on your way to ordinary level. You have to spend
Cr500/month to stay SL 2. That\'s enough to get you reasonable food and
acceptable lodging for Cr300 and leave you Cr200 for other expenses. By
SL 3 you are already a bit over ordinary level: Cr750 will buy you good
food and good lodging for Cr400, leaving Cr350 for other expenses. By SL 5
you are living good; Cr800 for fine food and fine lodging, leaving you
Cr450 for other expenses. By SL 7, which many think is average SL (I
myself think SL 6 is the average SL, but that\'s just a theory), you
have to spend Cr1,750/month, which will buy you luxury food and luxury
lodging and leave you Cr550 for other expenses.

I still think that the Cr250 per SL rule is badly broken.

Now, working the other way, I think that the average citizen would be able
to buy good food and good lodging (Cr400/month). Food and lodging will
amount to roughly 2/3rd of personal living expenses (another Cr200/month).
Finally I think 25% is a reasonable average tax rate (total tax, Imperial
and local). So to have Cr600/month to spend, the average citizen will need
to earn Cr800/month or Cr9,600/year, which I round off to Cr10,000 to get
a figure that\'s easy to calculate with.

I don\'t think a horsepower has much to do with the actual amount of energy 
used by a horse when running.  The unit originated, IIRC, as a rough estimate 
of how many horses a steam engine could replace for the purpose of pumping 
water out of a mine.

I decided to try to answer my own question using the wonders of the web.  
According to the American Heart Association, a 150lb. person running 10mph 
burns 1280 Calories/hour, or .356Calories/sec.  Big "C" calories are actually 
kilocalories, so let\'s rewrite that as 356calories/sec.  One calorie equals 
4.19joules, so that\'s 1,490joules/sec or ~1.5kW.  This figure is for a 150lb.
person, for a 600lb. robot we multiply by 4 and that figure rises to ~6kW.  
That\'s _10_times_ what the GURPS battlesuit uses!

*ObTrav:  If we want to eliminate mecha-like battledress from GURPS Traveller,
	all we need to do is use realistic figures for the performance of legged
	suspensions.  I suggest dividing the GURPS Vehicle Speed Factors 
	(pg.128) for legged suspensions by ten.

Well, I\'ve no real objection to HePLAR and T-Plates co-existing (a la T4)
as it can lead to some interesting design decisions (especially if you
limit T-plates to 6G or so). I did object to the entire look and feel being
changed. (It was almost as if someone took my MacOS 8.5 system and I
switched on the next day to find Windows NT 4. Well, maybe not quite that
bad.)

Replacing 1 magictech device with another was annoying.

IMTU it\'s the Atlas Of The Imperium, which is of course in electronic 
format in the computer system aboard the PC\'s ship. What it contains
is full sector and subsector maps plus some details about each world 
therein, about a paragraph\'s worth -- it\'s these entries that appear
in my (GURPS) Traveller web site in the campaign adventure writeups. Of
course, I make it up as I need to. For the players, I have a hardcopy
of the 16 subsector maps in the Dagudashaag sector (where the campaign
takes place) with UWP writeups on each subsector page -- any details that
are needed, I either provide as needed, or occasionally make up on the
spot. :)

What i have noticed is that any time you anyone
tries to write anything _new_ for Traveller the
continuity (I\'m not brave enough to use the other c
word) freaks (you know who you are) get upset.
Every last bit of all past GDW detail (except
for the parts _they_ disagree with of course)
has to be just so.

This includes not just background can** but
also rules can**; any result which was possible 
under their favorite version of Traveller must be 
possible under all new versions of Traveller
or the new version is wrong.

To these sorts of people if, for example,
under CT it was just barely possible for an
unarmored character to survive a direct hit from
a FGMP-15 (damage 15d6) then to these people
any future FGMP-15 for which it is not just
barely possible (although quite unlikely) for
an unarmored character to survive a direct
hit than the new FGMP is wrong and whoever
designed it is screwing up Traveller.

Of course these same people tend to bitch a
lot about Traveller design sequences not
matching "reality".  If the firearm they
used in the military massed 8 kilos and the
FFS equivalent weighs 14 kilos then FFS is
broken and they have to bitch about that too.

I am not really sure that I would _want_ to
redo anything already covered in can** _or_
do anything new since I would get bitched at
either way.  Instead it may be best to design
things that were mentioned but not detailed
in past canon.  It is just safer that way.

For example when I wanted my new Traveller
character to have green hair I told the GM
the character was Darmine.  Can** never
said what color hair the Darmine had so 
this worked well.

For four years now I have been able to develop
the Darmine as I see fit.  If I want to explain
the fact that the reason the Darmine tend toward
obsessive compulsive disorder is that their
bodies chelate away the massive amounts of heavy
metals on their home world, Ishag (density of 1.7).
A very small amount of this heavy metal ends up
in the fat myelinating the nerve cells in their 
brain.  Since the copper makes electrical
connectivity higher it is easier for connective
pathways to form in the brain and the brain tends
to be more likely to want to repeat actions.

Now this explanation might be attacked on medical
or psychological grounds but no one is going to be
able to say that the existence of the Darmine is not
can** or that the version I have developed conflicts
with established can**.  Established can** on the
Darmine is about 40 words and does not include any
biology.

Of course of GT: Alien Races Minor Races comes out and
includes a different version of the Darmine I will
be upset.

Eskaloyt\'s sun is thought to have been between an F2 V and an F7 V. Since
_Regency Sourcebook_ changed a number of M-type stars to other types by
substituting an F, G, or K for the M and retaining the number, I\'d
suggest that Shionthy\'s star ought to be an F4 V.

In the hope of muffling this oft repeated Flame War let me attempt to
arbitrate by translating. I believe what the first poster was really trying
to say was: Once GDW instituted the TNE changes it was pretty much insuring
that no new CT/MT material would be produced. GDW did not have the resources
to support two different Traveller games. No one had to use the TNE
materials in their game, of course. It was just guaranteed that they
wouldn\'t have any new published material in their game either.

A GM could split off his campaign at any point in the time line.
Pre-Rebellion, Post Rebellion, or Post Virus. No matter what though, thanks
to the demise of GDW the GM is on his/her own. TNE storyline was never
finished either. So at it\'s core no one is happy with the outcome. CT\'s
don\'t like the Rebellion, MT\'s don\'t like Virus and TNE\'s don\'t like not
knowing what the hell the Empress Wave is.

The biggest problem I have with the GURPS system is the enormous numbers you
have to play with when dealing with things like high-tech, large-scale
weapons. I prefer something of a more logarithmic system (i.e. smaller
numbers ... didn\'t David Pulver come up with something like this once?). For
me, figuring 6d x 10,000 damage vs. 128,000 DR or whatever, then figuring
the remaining damage against various components is a little onerous. Not to
mention figuring up all the modifiers based on range, speed, size, targeting
computers, weapon accuracy, etc. just to make a hit roll.

AFAIK, there is no alternate "to hit" and "damage" sequence in the rules.

But this is *purely* personal preference, because I don\'t like to play with
a calculator while running a game, and I am weak at doing quick math in my
head. And, while I don\'t like to play GURPS, I do like to mine it
extensively for use in the rules that I do use.

Yes, I mentioned something along these lines, I believe on another list
(Trav Deckplans? AGL?), and got the comment that GURPs had only four
attributes. I had no idea how to explain my problem, but I think you got it.
There may be only four /basic/ attributes, but, IIRC, there are scads of
*derived* attributes that are calculated using those four and maybe some
other things. The big numbers, although somewhat ungainly, can have the
zeros dropped and then replaced when done, but that is another step. And a
reason I prefer CT with it\'s tidy little scores. ;) I see that White Wolf
pared down their Renown scores in their second edition of Werewolf. I was
surpised at the first set of rules, as everything else avoided mile long
numbers. It seemed reminiscent of AD&D\'s experience system. But now it is
much more elegant. I did get First In and Far Trader, as I figured it was
quite alright having such a gearhead ruleset for creating steller systems
and handling commerce. The players never deal with that part directly, so
the fact the systems are *completely* different is not an issue.

For the unititiated (or forgetful), a brief bibliography of CT and it\'s
carryforward materials to MT:
Bks 1-3 are the basic rules set
Bk1 Characters and Combat
Bk2 Starships
Bk3 Worlds and Travel
Bks 4-8 are expansion material
Bk4 Mercenary
(Adv CGen for Army and Marine, more weapons, Q&D mass combat abstraction)
Bk5 High Guard
(Adv CGen for Imp, Sect, SS, and System Navies, advanced ship building rules)
Bk6 Scouts
(Adv CGen for scouts. Expanded System Generation)
Bk7 Merchant Prince
(Adv CGen for Merchants (Free Trader, SS lines, Sector Lines, Megacorp
lines) and bulk-goods style trade rules)
Bk8 Robots
(Robot design rules, and robots as pc\'s rules; GDW branded DGP work)

Striker (Bks 1-3, boxed set, CT Minis combat rules for ground forces)
Bk1 Rules
Bk2 Advanced Rules
Bk3 Equipment

Snapshot (boxed, several formats)
(CT Bk1 combat rules presented as a boardgame)

Mayday (boxed)
(CT Bk2 starship combat adapted to hex-grid)

Azhanti High Lightning (Big flat box)
Azanti High Lightning
(striker combat adapted to square-grid boardgame)
Supplement 5 Lightning Class Cruisers
(Explains the deckplans and ships of the AHL class also in the box)

Supplements with rules:
Supp4 Citizens of the Imperium (12 new careers)

Adventures with major Rules bits:
Adv3 Twighlight\'s Peak
(Droyne Generation Rules, supplanted by an AM)
Adv 5? Trillion Credit Squadron
(Campaign rules for small astro-naval wars)

Just for reference, MT included the Bk4-7 Adv CGen rules, and the Bk 6&7
materials in the basic materials, and slightly expanded Bk1 CGen... with
parsonal combat being a hybrid of Bk 2 and Striker/AHL. Ship combat is a
gridded version of Bk5 HG combat. MT also has a workable mass combat system
in the Ref\'s Companion... it works with almost all scales of combat, if you
are willing to do the math. It also included Supp8 and Supp 11 (Library
Data).

The original solicitations read something to the effect of "2000 years
before the 3rd Imperium"... I was shown the solicitation. Whether the error
was at the distributor\'s level or not, it was common and widespread on
wwivnet, too. When it came out, the solicitations had changed, and the ads
made no reference to the CT setting.

In essence, in CT and MT, the imperial government effeectively IS the
nobility. Dukes rule subsectors. Archdukes RULE domains (at least once
reinstated). Most subsectors have dukes ruleing them. Based upon Bk5, there
are also spearate navies at these levels, too. Obviously there are some
bureacracratic organizations to hadle some aspects, but the Dukes, at
least, ARE the imperial government.

See above... the level of change changed the nature of the government of
CT, and blocked quite a few CT style adventures. I think Mr. Nilsen went
WAY TOO far.

Did it really resolve anything? No. The rebellion setting is one about
fighting for what you believe in.

More literally, the virus was a tool to end - without resolving - the
rebellion.  Resolution implies bringing clarity and or vision and or
completion. If TNE had simply left the imperium shattered into many pieces,
it would have been a resolution... not one I would have liked, but it would
have continued the story. Virus is pure deus ex machina to undo the entire
history.

I have been aware of that... but it is not dramaturgically correct to do so...

anything can be said, but when said is it truthful?

As I recall, the TNE rulebook says very little about the continuing
thematic elements... those were all in Survival Margin.

Yes, it was... but I don\'t blame Mr. Nilson alone... I blame him for the
changes to the Domain of Deneb... but virus was a GDW decision, not a Dave
Nilson decision. Eradicating the Nobility as Government in the Regency,
that was Mr. Nilson, and he changed the setting to be a parody of the CT
setting.

BTW, my apologies if I used the wrong spelling of anybody\'s name...

Traveller Culture. You had said that there were too many numbers involved in
character creation. Joseph\'s problem seems to be one with combats with
*really big* weapons.

There are hardly "scads" of derived attributes, and the derivations
themselves are very straightforward.

I\'d be really surprised, at least with the various GURPS rules I\'ve come
into contact with, to see any attributes that would require the use of the
kind of numbers that you are talking about.

The kind of numbers that Joseph was talking about, in fact, seem to be a
little bit of hyperbole to prove a point. The numbers he was talking about
seem more along the lines of the Death Star blowing up a planet; numbers
that are so high that they throw the system out of whack.

Still, it is a valid complaint, really big combats are meant to be handled
differently than person to person combats. In all cases of larger combats
that I can think of, there is a different rule, usually included either in
the sourcebook that the campaign is using or Compendium 2.

That\'s why I\'m really kind of baffled. I hate doing anything but the
simplest math in my head, and yet I\'ve strangely never felt that I needed to
be a human calculator to play. I\'m not saying that GURPS is perfect, by any
means. However, if people want to attack its faults, attack its actual
faults and weaknesses. They do exist and they\'re not hard to find.

Nah, GDW\'s details can be scrapped. It\'s DGP\'s details that are important.

The sad (yet strangely amusing) part is that you\'re absolutely right. Your

 Feh. Book 8\'s color text is fine, but any attempt to use the design system 
reveals its huge omissions and descriptive gaps. This book was a test run by 
the DGP crowd for their thorough mangling of MT\'s design systems, and boy 
does it show. Stick with the system from the first four issues of JTAS (also 
to be found in Best of JTAS, Vol 1) or jump to Vampire Fleets for TNE.

Yep, the yacht thing always struck me too, just needed someone else to
confirm it (When I started Trav, there were precious few GM\'s of the game
and I never got on the right track myself, and had no-one to confirm my
doubts/thoughts... and I always thought GDW would write something about it
in a JTAS article and they never did--a clear cut case of not pursuing my
own ideas incase I invalidated something official that may be printed later,
a common game system fault I have).

Again, a similar take I pursued, and again, never forwarded because of the

From just outside perhaps?  From Laviathan territory?  I like this and it
saves me having to think out anything more plausable... thanks for that.

ObTrav: Funny, I must have run this particular adventure at least a dozen
times (it and Pyramids were always popular with club gamers), and really
never put a great deal of thought into the background, other than muling
over things waiting for a JTAS article that never came, but oddly enough,
didn\'t stop me from enjoying the module...  I also found that many things in
JTAS never happened anyplace and were an absolute pain to track-down a
suitable world to host it on in the Marches, and many seemed to leave things
unanswered... or was it me and the time I gamed in?

[Most points already answered by others.]

Have you calculated the damage from an average missile hit? A hit with a
relative velocity of only 10 does around 20,000 HP of damage and treats armour
as one fifth its actual DR. The threat of them means everyone has to have
laser point defence weapons.

This is a problem sometimes, but I think it can mainly be dealt with by
some quick rounding.  (Just work in thousands.)

I prefer something of a more logarithmic system (i.e. smaller

There is in the new edition of Space, which is perfectly compatible with
GURPS Traveller.  I haven\'t got my hands on the final version, but from the
playtest it should be much more streamlined than the system in GT and uses
smaller numbers.  For roughly High Guard-level resolution, there is also
the very abstract old Space Combat System, (still found in Compendium 2). 
Or if you prefer a more action-movie feel, there\'s also the Space Opera
Combat System, although it\'s probably a bit too Star Wars-like for most
Traveller games.

This is the flexibility GURPS is famous for.  You can get something close
to Brilliant Lances resolution, or High Guard, or something in between,
without having to redesign ships and characters.

Players get a *lot* more reasonable when they discover that the GM is
applying those rules to NPCs as well. The guy who just *had* to have
that bonus gets worried when confronted with some NPCs who have it too.

Nope. Nebulae *don\'t* look like what you see in the Star Trek movies.
The material in those showy nebulae you see astronomical photos of is a
better vacuum than you\'ll find in a lightbulb. Or even in low orbit
around most planets. 

We\'re talking about a few atoms per cubic centimeter. Which is hundreds of
times what\'s normally found in interstellar space. 

Those photos are also *long exposure*. The light levels from the
nebulae are very low. Lower than the light from the aurora, if you\'ve
ever seen that.

To get something like Trek\'s "Mutara Nebula" would require gas
densities near those at mountain tops and incredible amounts of
ionizing radiation to both ionize the gases and *keep* them ionized.

There\'s not only a C-64 emulator for the PC, but they also sell a cable
that\'ll let you hook a 1541 drive to a PC printer port. 

That might save you some time.

I actually assumed that there were two sets of capacitors, one set for each
jump drive fitted (Annic Nova had two seperate jump drives) plus a set of
storage batteries which both stored power for normal ships use and charged
the jump drive capacitors allowing them to discharge in the normal way.

Well it would have done if the two 1541 drives I had didn\'t die at the same

Perhaps Eskaloyt was a binary system, and Yaskodray only took one star with

So, besides GURPs, what other Robot design rules are there, and how do they
rank? Star Wars droid creation sucked, and, IIRC, B:8 was a little sparse.
Many systems I have seen don\'t even bother with ship/\'bot/critter creation
rules, and this was one thing that Traveller had that hooked me good. ;)

I just mailed in a dozen or so errata for First In.  They\'ll be on the SJG
errata site as soon as Mike Bowman gets around to them, I imagine.

In particular, there are several items that deal with the known issue with
stellar diameters, some clarifications, and fixes to the one Social Parameter
that was seriously broken.

Another item that may be of interest. . .while working on the Solomani Rim
book, I\'ve come face to face with a bunch of worlds that translate into First
In as "Desert" worlds, yet apparently have oceans and oxy-nitrogen
atmospheres.  It occurred to me that if a Desert world has native life, then
it\'s reasonable to claim that it can have an O-N atmosphere, making it
"Earthlike" in First In terms.  If you use the First In rules as written, not
many Desert worlds will have native life for lack of surface water -- but
when you use First In to flesh out canonical material you have to deal with
a lot of little worlds with oceans.  So one of the errata I\'ve submitted 
allows
Desert worlds with native life to be Earthlike, just as Ocean worlds can be.
This might help those of you out who are trying to make First In work with
the canonical UPP-generation system.

The [20] refers to the effective hull thickness.  Under FF&S2 (page 64),
the minimum armor rating is 20 for spacecraft (this equals approximately
7cm of TL5 hard steel, or 1cm of TL12 superdense).  However, this value
is not the same as the combat armor value under T4.  Thus, T4 spacecraft
must be rated both for what, to avoid confusion, I call "effective hull
thickness", and combat armor rating.  The Akins Excel spreadsheet
automatically calculates combat armor rating, based on the effective
hull thickness.

Thus, my design, as submitted, included both the combat armor rating (0)
and the effective hull thickness ([20]).

Your bot should account for both ratings.

Hope this helps both you and other THUDDD entrants.  (If you need
further clarification, please notify me ASAP.)

IMTU, spacers and starport workers are among the prime targets for Ine
Givar union organisers.  The Ine Givar unions are the ones to join - they
tend to be the most resistant to noble terrorism and takeovers by organised
crime, plus they\'re the least interested in cooperating/collaborating with
planetary governments.

An OT Real World(tm) curiousity:  there is a political party in East Timor
one of whose main bases of support is among dock workers.  It seems like
they
may have been influenced by unionised crews on some of the ships that have
gone there.  

OBTRAV:  Obviously interstellar trade influences \'elite\' politics on
Imperial and near-Imperial worlds.  Presumably it influences \'popular\'
politics too.  These influences could just as easily come through megacorp
ships as through free traders - all it takes is that assistant engineer who
is a keen Spacers\' Guild activist.

This whole business is stolen from history, as I\'m sure \'Dave the Ancient
History guy\' would realise.  It\'s poached from the suppression of the \'Nika
riots\' in Constantinople by Belisarius and Narses.

David Drake used the same idea in one of his "Hammer\'s Slammers" stories. 
I can\'t remember the title.

L Sprague de Camp used it in a fantasy setting in "The Clocks of Iraz".

The Nika riots were kind of cool, as the organisation of the rioters was
provided by the chariot racing factions - kind of half political parties
and half gangs of soccer hooligans^h^h fans, with vague associations with
different Christian religious sects.  (See de Camp\'s "Lest Darkness Fall"
for some flavour of religious disputes in this period, even though the book
is of course fiction.)

My problem was that I went to an Atari 1040ST (for financial reasons) when
the C64 slowly perished and everything I had to transcript was from
hardcopy.  Heheheheheh... then the diskdrive of the 1040ST died and I
shifted to a PC some *months* later and again, had to transcribe from
hardcopies!  Sheesh!!  LOL

I agree with your comments about the  expansion  phase.  However,
as to whether the 3I funds starports in the post-expansion phase:

Disliking "one size fits all" answers I think that where possible
the 3I would try to coerce the local planetary government to fund
local infrastructure improvements, or at least joint  fund  them.
Sometimes the 3I would foot the bill but that would depend on the
personalty of the subsector  and  sector  nobility.  Sometimes  a
starport would be built by a megacorporation who would either use
it for themselves  or  run  the  facilities  as  a  profit-making
business.  Starports are something which can readily be justified
to the commercial world.

One thing the 3I would be concerned about is tech  compatability.
Difficulty in maintaining shipping would hurt both commercial and
military quarters.  To that end I see a  series  of  3I-sponsored
tech specifications, covering everything from starship components
to subsystems and sometimes beyond.  Check  out  the  section  on
IDPs on my StuffOnline web site for more details.

1541 disks aren\'t readable in PC drives without extra hardware. They
use GCR format, which standard FDC chips can\'t handle. The same goes
for older Mac floppies.

I wonder if any of the design rules can handle a computer like HEX? :-)

Ah, but  the  Rebellion  was  started  by  the  assassination  of
Strephon (maybe) by Dulinor to bring about democracy in  the  3I.
He  and  the  pro-democracy  movement  are  to  blame  ...   thus
"democracy"  on  the  interstellar  scale  could   be   seen   as
dangerously radical and destructive.  The successors  to  the  3I
would be anti-"interstellar democracy" not pro.

It did seem like the democratisation of the OTU was an attempt to
remove those elements that made the authors of TNE uncomfortable.

That\'s exactly what I liked about the Rebellion story-line: there
were no good guys and bad guys but a more realistic reflection of
the human condition ... a moral maze.  If you want  a  game  with
saccarine preachy good-v-evil background go and play Star Wars!

<sarcasm on>
    As for not letting the bad guys win ...  its  not  like  that
    ever happens in RL, right?
<sarcasm off>

Given the hard-SF aspect of FF&S and the T2K house system rules I
always thought  that  2300AD  should  have  been  given  the  TNE
treatment (and not MT).

Why do we want to delete them? The problem (at higher TLs) is more a matter 
of armor than speed (the infamous high-DR battlesuits I\'ve heard about in 
Star Mercs).

You may also want to read "Strata" by Terry Pratchett, which predated his 
Discworld books. It\'s a SF book that features this flat world in space ...

My thought is that the Cr250 per SL is what applies to travellers, and
other PC-types.  These are people who are are living in hotels, eating in
restaurants, using expensive dry cleaners, buying toiletries and other
supplies in small quantities (rather than in the economy bulk industrial
packages). In other words, think of the way that a person on vacation
spends money.  And, when we consider PC\'s in particular, we are considering
people who may have spent several weeks or months on a cramped and
uncomfortable ship placing themselves in considerable danger.  I think that
there wold be certain amount of "kicking back and relaxing" expense also.  

In contrast, regular citizens spend considerably less money to maintain

It doesn\'t.  It has to do with the energy _output_ by the horse.

Hm.  That seems high on the calories/hour figure.  Most sustained moderate-heavy exercise is in the 600 calories/hour range.  In any case, bear in mind that calories/hour is the fuel _input_, not output, and that humans are not particularly efficient at turning fuel into energy (<20% as I recall).  As such, the 600 lb human has closer to a 1 kW power plant than a 6 kW power plant, as power plants are rated by energy output, not fuel input.  An additional factor of two improvement through various sorts of leg optimizations isn\'t unreasonable.

Laugh.  Factor of two at worst.  Factor of 10 increases power requirements by x100.

You\'re quite right and I wouldn\'t want to detract from the excellent work
that Mr Gannon did.


However, I was thinking more along the lines of sources that detailed [1]
*every* world of an entire sector (as Behind the Claw and the Signal GK
issues did).

this I\'d have tended to assume at least a UWP and a paragraph or two of

The human body converts food to energy at, IIRC, ~30% efficancy. The 
conversion Energy -> Motion is also pretty inefficiant. A machine would 
probably do this much more efficiantly. Still GURPS is probably a bit 
overoptimistic. On the other hand a TL-15 300 kg walker in FFS1 with a 6kW 
engine has a top-speed of (5+10+(0.006/0.3)*2500)*0.25=16.25 (*)kph so...

(*)(if the TL bonus applies to walkers - it\'s listed under "wheeled/tracked 
modifiers" but then so is the catagory "If legged")

One of the reasons I bought a scanner as soon as the prices dropped below a
hundred bucks. With the OCR software I got it makes retyping a thing of the

Ah, but perhaps Dulinor made his move when he felt that public support would
be in his favor... and the assassination of Strephon was seen as an act of
liberation.

Besides, the Rebellion itself can be largely characterized as the petty
squabbling of nobles, which would further support Dulinor\'s position.

Except for Daibei. If I could be anywhere when the Rebellion hit, it would
be Daibei. ;)

I\'m not going to disagree here too much. However, I\'ve been talking about
the issue of the democratization of the REGENCY, which is a slightly
different tack.

We can. Whether we do is another matter. ;-)

I would suspect that a single fully detailed subsector with plots and hooks
and full planetary data, say with some ship designs and trade information,
published in a 101/LBB style package with notes for a chunk of M0 is more
likely in the short term.

I know that the next two products planned for release (before Christmas 99)
are 101 Patrons and ACQ.

Okay. As an ex-Atari and now Mac user I have to ask a number of questions.

1) What package did you have the designs in?

2) Do you still have the disks?

3) Did you know that there is a ful blown ST emulator for the Mac and the
demo runs for 15min and allows cut and paste from the TOS environment to
MacOS?

4) I have said emulator and also a lot of packages and a working 4Mb 1040
STe with NVDI and twin DD, mono monitor.

5) If you can answer 1 & 2 there is a potential short cut to transcribing
them...

1. Classic Traveler.

3/4 of a roleplaying game. The lack of rules to use skills except for
combat  was in my mind a major hinderence for a GM. While players could
blast away with abandon, the rules could not cope with piloting and
computer usage. (This comes from the LBB 1 to 8). I did love Merchant
Princes and Robots, and most of the systems where good (planet creation was
a dream).

The Solomani and Zhodani books where also great and formed the basis of my
3I.

2. MegaTraveller.

A joy to use. While the vehical rules where unworkable, 101 Vehicals and
the basic ships in the rules covered what I wanyted in the game. Skill
system was simple but effective, combat reasonable and character generation
for the major careers generally unchanged from CT (I did wish extended
character design extended to all careers, as the normal careers where
underskilled compared to ECD).

Background was good, but I was never a fan of the rebellion. IMTU

While I never owned Hard Times, I do own Survival Margin, and thus know the
background (from a Dave Nielson perspective).

The reset that virus offered was totally unnessisary. If they wanted to
have a new background, they should have gone back to the major inspirations
of the 3I (Gibsons Rise and Fall of Rome, Asimov\'s Foundation and Nivens
and Pournell\'s Co-Dominium/Second Imperium).

All of these had a large Empire disinergrate into barbarism and strife. All
of these had a bastion of hope (Byzantium/Terminus/Sparta), and allowed a
sence of building a bright new future (well except for Rome).

The best way would have to advance the timeline say 200 years, after the
Imperium has torn itself apart from way and another long night has dawned.
Good and Bad factions rise (Hiver, Deneb, Zhodani, Solomani, et al) strive
to rebuild what was lost in the folly of greed and ego. The conflict would
be the fate of the people of the Shatered Imperium , will they find new
glories or find the same old evils?

3. TNE

The rules where good. Very good in parts. The background bites (see above).
The cannonical Change was unaceptable however (Heplar and others).

4. T4

Under all the crap a good game could be found. This is a lesson on how to
distroy customer good will due to shoddy work and poor editing. The
background needed work.

5. GT

I have allways played GURPS , I can make charater generation systems sing.
This however leaves a lot to be desired in GT as you dont get a sence of
history for a character as you do for all versions of Traveller. However my
bigest gripe is the Imperial mesurements used in the game (as a metric
user, how am I suppose to know that there are 2000lbs in a ton?!?!).

6. 2300AD

I loved this game. Truely Ruley!!! It is so much easier to explain the
French Empire than the 3I. People know how the French react, or Americans,
or British! Preconception can be a joy in a game like this (The same reason
I love Ars Magica, who needs a repressive religion when you can use your
history books and use the Caotholic Church!!!) Being an Aussie , it was
great to see a game that was not American-centric and the mechanisms where
Traveller like to make learning them easy.

All in all, I must say that GT is my pefered system at the moment, for the
simple reason I can find people playing it.
I still pefer 2300AD, and Love to see a MT/T5 fly, but can the market bear
it?

You are half right.  I have myself, successfully read several 1581 disks in
my regular old floppy drive on my Dell Dimension PC.  It reads the disks
WITHOUT extra hardware and creates a disk image on my PC\'s hard drive.

Here is proof, here is a message written to a SEQ file on my old Commodore
BBS in a forum called "The Inn", archized on a 1581 disk since 1994.

Problem with the above explanation :-
	The only way the copper will work the way you want it to is if it is
incorporated into porphyrin-like molecules. In other words : the copper
atoms act as electron carriers, and parallel electrical circuits are
created.
	The lipids that make up myelin may be modified in this way to protect
the myelin from free-radical mediated destruction by metal ions. Copper
will be in an ionic form unless it is "organified" by association with
some carrier protein e.g. caeruloplasmin.
[Manganese associated Parkinsonism and the effects of mercury (minimata
disease) are good examples of metal-induced neuropathy].
	The problem with this handwave is that the \'cable properties\' of
neurones will be affected because their resistance is lower, leading to
faster conduction of nerve impulses.
	This will lead to the formation of reverberant circuits as you have
suggested, leading to an increased predisposition to seizures and motor
tics. These nasty effects are likely to show well before any higher
behavioural ones.
	[Compare the situation to re-entrant circuits in ischaemic myocardium
in the development of dysrhythmias].
	As far as neurochemistry is concerned, OCD is characterised by
depletion of serotonin via decreased synthesis and exaggerated breakdown
of this neurotransmitter (hence the successful use of serotonin reuptake
inhibitors and clomipramine in treating this problem).

Alternative explanations?
	The Darmine chelating system may hinder the uptake of compounds that
are incorporated into the relevant enzymes ; or the enzymes are a low
activity variant (genetic variation similar to that seen with the
metabolism of hydralazine or isoniazid, etc).

The communication times are long, but not so long as to create the sorts of
problems that people seem to think they would. A representative democracy,
for example, could be easily as effective as the noble system presented in
Traveller.

The problems of a government controlling a vast territory will always be the
same. It could be argued that a democratic system would in fact be more
advantageous over such a vast distance, due to the ability to cashier
leaders at a more local level.

>People complaign of the alienation they feel from their elected oficials

The alienation factor would probably be much the same as it is now, really.
The basic idea would still be the same: elected officials who go off to
someplace else and do their job.

>Apart from the Zhodani, who\'s is in fact a oligarchy with an Athenian

When people call it a "true" democracy because that sort of political system
was first used in Athens, not because it is a perfect example of the modern
ideal of a liberal democracy.

After all, the Greeks invented the term and the system of government. Might
as well consider it "true."

>Fuduallism works where comunication rates are slow and constrained, and


The only problem is that the system of government that is present in the
Imperium isn\'t really feudalism. Concepts such as free trade and
megacorporations don\'t fit neatly into the pigeonhole provided by that term.

If anything, the system is closer to that of France during the Age of
Absolute Monarchy (from the Sun King on). In fact, the Imperial Moot is very
similar to the lobby of aristocrats in pre-revolutionary France.

>Democracy only works where communications allow easy transmissions of

Well, no, not precisely. Democracy has only really been tried where
communications allow easy transmission of people\'s views and opinions. That
doesn\'t mean that speedy communications are a requirement for a democracy.

>When people have the information , they can
>(Theroreticly) make sound desisions.


Since, in theory, elections would take place on the subsector and sector
level, this is something of a moot point. Although communications are slow,
they\'re not so slow as to make something like a representative democracy
unworkable. Keep in mind, as well, that the Regency covers much less
territory than the former Third Imperium, which would make the system even
more attractive.

One of the real problems is policing the elections to make sure that
everybody\'s playing by the rules. Another real problem is the perceived weak
leadership abilities of politicians in a democratic system. Still, I think
it\'s safe to assume that there are also weak nobles and aristocrats... so it
becomes something of a moot point.

>From (my) observation, The 3I proberbly had the double whammy of no borders
>to expand and it was too big to run as a fudualism.

I\'m not sure that I can agree with this. While the size of the Imperium was
surely a factor, the concept of strong noble leadership at "local" levels
would tend to offset the problems with size and speed of communication to
some extent.

After all, isn\'t that supposed to be the point of the Imperium\'s system of
Government?

You say this on what authority, exactly? Keep in mind that Stalin really had
no intention of creating a workers\' paradise, so the use of that example is
somewhat unfair. He wanted to create a totalitarian, dictatorial state and
saw communism as an effective method to attain that goal.

On the other hand, according to canon, the Regency (just one small chunk of
the former Third Imperium) did become a democracy, in fact, had to become a
democracy. If you can come up with some reasons why it couldn\'t have become
a democracy, I\'m all ears. All you\'ve succeeded in doing so far is to say
that democracy relies on the speed of communication, which is arguable. Even
if I concede that a democracy requires a high-speed of communication to
function, with the system of sectors and subsectors that already exists
canonically this isn\'t as much of a factor as it would appear.

Gee, un-sub for a weekend and look what happens! The Nth Traveller Version
Flamewar is resurrected (probably my fault, sorry), and a whole lot of
smart suggestions and cool ideas appear in order to shoehorn the Annic Nova
into later canon!

Y\'know, on my website I have "Canon Problem 3: The Kinunir" but I have
forgotten what the other two problems were?!!? Maybe the \'Nova was one of
them!  ;-)

When I posted my reply about it being a Droyne ship, I probably should have
said "with modifications" - ie. where did the ship\'s boats come from - a
human ship that pranged into a world? Maybe! Not having data about Victoria
at the time, I thought maybe Victoria was populated by Droyne (I think its
actually a minor human race, BTW - with info coming from the RSB, since I
don\'t own JTAS #2, sigh). However, maybe THAT is a better idea as the
ship\'s origin - you could tie in a whole mini-campaign around finding the
ship and tracking it back to its origin!

Kudos to whoever it was for realising there are no perches (or
Droyne-shaped beds - how do they sleep, anyway? The Droyne PCs in my
campaign were forever getting locked in the \'fresher!).

You realise a lot of the "problems" simply come from it being a very early
design by Marc (prior to a lot of the canon/design rules). Basically, it is
a dungeon crawl in space, designed at the time (late \'70\'s/very early 80\'s)
to attract the attention of the average fantasy gamer.  ;-)

We want to delete them because they don\'t appear in any previous version of
Traveller and are therefore not "canonical."  Trav fans tend to be a conservative
bunch when it comes to messing with the background.  Since BD has been 
vulnerable small arms in previous versions of Traveller, it should be in GT, also.
You\'re free to do whatever you want IYTU, of course.  It\'s the OTU people
worry about.

If it\'s got a stellar wind, the <????>pause (the place the wind quits
displacing the interstellar medium) will be giving off a lot of hard
radiation. 

Explaining how an antimatter star can have *normal* matter planets gets
*really* ugly. And the stellar wind would react with them or their
atmospheres. 

In short, it ain\'t gonna fly.

An isolated system like Niven\'s "Cannonball Express" in "Flatlander",
where star *and* planet(s) are antimatter is much "simpler".

Patrick Holmstrom made similar points in his post.

I\'m perfectly willing to accept that the body is an inefficient power plant and that
power consumption should therefore be reduced in a legged suspension.  However, I
disagree that the efficiency of legged transmissions can be noticeably improved over
human locomotion for *battlesuits*.  After all, the wearer has to fit inside the legs
and they have to match the motions his limbs are capable of.  

You\'ve conviced me it\'s not a factor of 10, but I\'m holding out on that 
last factor of 2.  As it stands, legged suspensions have the same efficiency in GURPS
as wheeled suspensions.

Uhmm, that was pretty much my understanding.  You
will notice that I asked for a description of the
Postmark Design Bureau.  That\'s why the Key-code I
gave you was PDB instead of BRS.

Ok, if you want to send me a write up on BRS, I\'ll be
happy to issue you two Key-codes.  I don\'t mind, it\'s
no big deal to add another line of code to the
database in the robot program.

Sure, sure, blame it on the browser.  :-)  Ok, seriously,
the entry I got had several irregularities which I cannot
even explain.  For example, instead of the section
symbol that is supposed to precede each line of the
entry, some of them had the HTML code (&sect;).
Perhaps I should change the section symbol to
something else.  Maybe the  vertical bar ("|") or
maybe not.

For those of you who have not yet submitted your
designs, I\'ve taken the submission form off-line for
debugging again and I will get it back up as soon as
possible.  I know this is a bit annoying, but look at it
this way when I get it finished, the turn around time
on THUDDDs could be as little as two weeks and we
could run THUDDDs concurrently (not that we likely
will, but...).

There have also been some problems with the
servers at homepage.com.  When I get it finished, I\'ll
let you know how you can get it without connecting to
thuddd.homepage.com.  I may have another server to
act as a mirror site, maybe I can even get one that
allows cgi and/or javascripts.  I\'m looking into the
possibilities.

BTW, if you are good with javascript, is there a way to
pass information from one script page to another?

Oops, I just realized that this was a private
communication.  Oh well, I can fix that, I\'ll just send it
out to the lists.  I hope that Phil Kitching doesn\'t mind
too much.

I\'ve got to get back to the debugging, I\'m burning
starlight.

You\'re not travelling to the UK soon are you?  I\'d sell you mine but

ISTR transferring all my C-64 material (essays, letters, Traveller sectors
etc) via the Amiga.  A handy little gadget allowed you to plug the 1541
into the Amiga and use it as a drive on that platform.  Slow but it worked
to get the stuff off.  IIRC, it took an entire day to transfer 20 disks.
They then fitted onto three Amiga disks!  (If anyone wants to buy the
connector box for postage and a small consideration, I could probably still
dig it out of the attic.)

Occasionally I still refer to files on an archive CD (written of course,
off a PC having subsequently transferred everything from the Amiga to an
IBM compatible machine) that I realize with nostalgia were originally
written on the 64 in EasyScript.  Does anyone else remember training
themselves to look at two wrapped 40 column lines and \'seeing\' it as an 80
column page?


OB Trav: Well, there must be a million but the most obvious is the PCs
finding some old data storage format and knowing/suspecting that it
contains valuable information and having to track down a means of reading
the information.

I ran one adventure where the PCs had to courier an old (unreadable) disk
of information that was so valuable the patron thought this would be
another good security measure.  In fact, the PCs were actually a decoy and
the real data was travelling by a different route.  They also managed to
resist the temptation to abscond with the disk and profit from it
themselves (good job too as it was worthless!).

It\'s an *old* problem. Trying to get the communications company
providing your hi-capacity links to provide *physically* seperate links
as opposed to *logically* seperate ones.

That is, you may bask for and be paying for a link, and a "seperately
routed backup link", but far too often, it\'ll turn out that "seperately
routed" means "next cable over in the bundle" rather than the
*intended* "cable run via a different *physical* route".

BTW, this was cut of *four* OC-192 cables linking East & West coast
systems. That\'s one *hell* of a lot of bandwidth.

The 1581 is *very* different. Among other things, it could and did use
normal formatting (FM, MFM) as well as GCR.

I specoifically mentioned the 1541 because the 1581 *can* produce PC

I know several people that still have their old C-64 stuff. Some are
willing to sell.

No matter what Dulinor *thought* the  public  support  would  be,
analysing how the other factions behaved indicates  that  he  did
*not* have it.  Each faction was (in general) controlled  by  the
local nobility who  continued  to  have  overall  public  support
within their territories.  There was no popular 3I-wide  uprising
in support of Dulinor, nor was the bulk  of  the  local  nobility
pressurised into moving their faction into a pro-Dulinor  stance.
And the assassination itself was handled  incompetantly:  Dulinor
should have stayed on Capital and awaited either ratification  by
the Moot or execution for high treason (regardless of which there
would have been no destructive Rebellion).

- - Dulinor\'s faction wanted democracy ... but started to  squabble
  internally.
- - Lucan\'s Imperium wanted revenge.
- - Margret\'s faction and Norris\'s domain  tried  to  maintain  the
  status quo.
- - The Vland faction was opportunistic/separetist.
- - Strephon\'s Imperium challenged Lucan.
- - All the other factions came into being  and  defied  Lucan  for
  reasons of self-presevation.

No, if that were so then the Rebellion would be like the  earlier
Civil War.  It may have been led by  squabbling  nobles  but  the
general public got intimately involved as well.

Although my heart will always be in the Solomani  Sphere,  \'home\'

Have you tried pawn shops? The pawn shops around here have scads of obsolete
computer equipment. If you can prove to them that they\'ll never get the
price they put out for it (they almost always lack a sense of what they\'ve
got is really worth) you can sometimes get a real deal.

I\'m not taking the democracy side in the debate. I don\'t like the
Regency/TNE setting. But historically the United States from the time of its
beginning to the 1850\'s was in the same position. California became a state
at a time when months were required to reach Washington from there. Some
interior states required even higher travel times, especially early in the
century, prior to the railroad. Technically republic is the operative word
here. I\'m not fully cognizant of the Regency Democracy data, but I would bet
that it\'s really a republic. Athens was indeed the last "true" democracy, in
that all citizens voted on each issue, vice voting for a representative to
vote on issues.

Nope. Apparently the major ISPs affected first noticed the problem when they
saw all their traffic re-routed through Europe.

The problem is not one of routing ability, it\'s the fact that a lot of major
links operate very near full capacity most of the time, especially during
"peak" (usually daytime) hours. Once major links go down, the traffic gets
rerouted, sure, but there often isn\'t enough bandwidth for it. Imagine (since
you\'re in Toronto, all you non-Torontonians can pick local highways wherever
you are) if the DVP got shut down. Sure, cars can drive anywhere, but where
are they going to go? Everywhere else is _already full_.

ObTrav: (Sort of) So, yesterday, a fine Canadian PhD researcher got the
IgNobel prize for his work studying the role of the dunut in the Canadian
psyche (or somesuch). Now, that may sound funny to you non-Canucks, but to me
it really seems to make sense. After all, the donut-store-to-resident ratio in
some small Ontario towns is something like 1-to-100. There are more donut
stores than grocery stores in parts of southern Ontario. One of this country\'s
finest, most cherished public institutions is... Tim Hortons, a donut store
named after a hockey player. I mean, what could be more Canadian? 

No doubt residents of various Imeprial worlds will feel that the peculiar,
well, peculiarities, of their neighbouring worlds are laughable, leading no
doubt to the occassional use of armed mercenary force to make the other guys
stop laughing, if only for a moment.

No offense meant by this, but I think you are supposed know that there are
2,000 lbs in a ton the same way we Imperial users are supposed to know that
there are 1,000 kg in a ton. ;-)

I also wish that GT were metric -- it just feels more futuristic and

design.

Um... so does this mean we here in Maine are in danger of being invaded by
donut-eating hockey players with a grudge?  Or should I expect to see yet
another Tim Horton\'s going up on Main Street?

Hello friends,

Although I\'m perhaps the 756271st to do so, I wrote an Construction tool
for starship lasers. It is based on FFS V1 with some
house-modifications, but perhaps some of you might be interested. Is is
done in Excel 97, using lots of VBA (which is IMHO the only usefull
thing in Office 97).

AS I do not have a homepage, I will sent it to everyone interested by
email (ca 100kb).

Returning you to wantever you are doing,

That\'s not the point. If you remember the discussion about drop tanks and
jump projectors half a year ago, you will remember that energy storage
devices that can build up a jump charge over time and store it for even a
few hours makes jump projectors possible and that jump projectors are even
more economically effective than drop tanks.

Absolutely not! It _worked_: witness the ISP\'s noticing their traffic being
routed through Europe.

The system was never expected to work with 100% efficiency all of the time. In
fact that was the great intellectual breakthrough of packet-switched
networks...that they _could_ work at efficiencies of less than 100%, something
a switched telephone network could not do at the time. (and may not even
now...I think the telco\'s have handled their switching problems the old
- -fashioned way: throw faster hardware at it.)

The Internet was never designed to \'survive\' a nuclear war, it was designed to
provide _some_ means of communication, however slow and incomplete, in
situations where normal communications lines would be shut down.

If there wasn\'t such a concentration of traffic along the US cross these
continental backbones, in fact, the cable cut would have been less noticeable,
but due to the exponential growth of the network, more and more traffic has
flowed along the few big pipes able to carry it. This is the exact
vulnerability that the original Arpanet was designed to overcome.

Problem: we need more and bigger pipes. A worldwide backbone network with the
capacity of the US\'s woudl have allowed the designed \'route around breaks\' to
function perfectly well, with only minor slowdowns of traffic.

ObTrav: Since here, at least, network traffic grows faster than the pipes can
be built, I wonmder what a mature TL-15 or 16 commnet looks like. Is
everything wired together?

coffee pot rather than hitting the Coffee-server and checking it\'s sensor
readings, reducing network traffic? Is it safe to plant roses in your backyard

Presumably, given Shannon\'s law, and the fact that the 3i can make and handle
X-ray lasers, is the hard limit of information transfer related to the
frequency of these? Do they really want trillions of little X-Ray laser diodes
all over the place? I\'d imagine that one could be turned into a rather nasty
little antipersonnel device in a pinch. What frequency _would they use? After
all, x-rays cover a rather high range of frequencies.

Or have they found a way around Shannon\'s law?

For the sun, the heliopause.  I don\'t know if there\'s a separate term for stars other than the sun.  Another point of note is that the solar wind would be dramatically more dangerous than normal -- matter/antimatter collisions would generate some extremely nasty, extremely high-penetration radiation.  Without specially designed shielding, expect it to cook the entire crew of a typical travelle starship in hours.

You can probably create better energy reclamation systems (to recover the energy when the foot hits the ground) than the human body has.

Nah.  The wheeled suspension requires 1/4 the power to move at the same speed (speed factor 16 vs 8); a railroad suspension requires 1/16 the power.

Mesh topology networks cost significantly more than Star topology
networks. But in a TL15-16 world who knows ?

I posted a story of the horseless carriage a year or so ago, as an
indication of how current thinking of the future can be radically
different than the reality. As I said then we are in the infancy of
information technology now, in another 60 years, who knows what it
will be like ? In 3000 years anything you could come up with is not
beyond the realms of possibility.

No they will use the network, as that much traffic won\'t affect the
network, and it saves them from getting up :-)

One of the best quotes I have read recently was about computers in
door knobs, and wireless networks over the wide area is something we
are looking into for off campus student access.

Yes and no. 2400 baud is the fastest speed you can drive a phone line
at, but lots of people are using 56K modems to read this message. I
posted on data transfer between Xboat and tender a while back which
went into frequency divisional multiplexing of lasers. As long as the
frequencies don\'t interfere with each other, or you can distinguish
the interference then you can get more bandwidth, add compression and
away you go.

Current networking equipment makes effective antipersonnel devices,
in-fact so do CD players. If something has a class 1 LED or Laser
sticker on it, don\'t look at the Laser or LED it if you value you
eyesight, and don\'t point it at anyone else. Third law of data
communications is never look down a fibre unless you are positively,
absolutely, and unequivocally sure that there is nothing on the other end.

Probably, but I don\'t know Shannon\'s law well enough to say that with
any real conviction.

As I said, anyone\'s ges is as good as yours.

Hope this helps more than hinders.

I didn\'t see jump projectors from the Annic Nova technology, but some
kind of fuel tender with a refueling probe, of course.

Though the jump drives in Annic Nova seemed to need a very long time
to build up a useful charge, compared to the jump drive of a standard 
Traveller starship. Granted, they were accumulating solar power,
but what if the type of jump drive technology used in the Annic Nova\'s
drives were incapable of handling a sudden energy spike like you see
in a standard jump drive? - not just because it wasn\'t designed to take
it, but because this particular variant of jump drive technology is
incapable of such sudden state changes during the charging phase.

Not that I have any practical experience with it, but Shannon\'s Theorem
[C=Blog2(1 + S/N)] applies to a transmission system that introduces noise
(N).  I suppose it is possible to find a noiseless system.  Back to the

Obviously, he hates GURPS ;-)

Of course, it\'s not as if the game mechanics (especially for combat) for CT 
and MT (and perhaps TNE) are that hot: they are all more cumbersome than 
what GURPS uses (MT is especially obnoxious with regards to the damage 
rules). For my MT pbmail campaign (sorry, no openings) I\'ve used the MT 
rules to see if you hit and (slightly modified) CT rules to determine 
damage.

A generous and sadistic GM,

I wasn\'t being *totally* serious with  that  part,  although  the

multi-gerne system.  All it lacked was a magic system for fantasy
games.  As such it would have been  superior  as  GURPS  lacks  a
proper task system (yes,  I  know  someone  tried  inventing  one
recently).  GURPS is an evolutionarily earlier game ... and isn\'t
metric.

(And I know how some people here love it, so I couldn\'t resist  a
dig.)

What about online democracy?  If everyone has net.access, and the
representatives are obliged to vote as their constituents direct, this
might actually work-- mightn\'t it?  Of course, decisions would be made
slowly; one couldn\'t respond to an immediate threat this way.

    Here\'s where travel time does come into play.  It just doesn\'t work in 
Traveller.   Also if you have online democracy, then why do you need 
representatives at all?

    Next, Who decides the agendas of bills to be voted upon?  Who decides how 
they will be written and worded?  Here you would need a governmental body 
that because of the vast size of the poplation couldn\'t be democratic in any 
real sense.  

    Even the Athenians had a governing council that drew up the meeting 
agenda.  For them, the members were drawn by lot rotating between electoral 
districts, so it was braodly representative and democratic.   But again this 
would be impossible in the 3i.

A true democracy requires a well educated, caring population.
Even if *everyone* had net.access, it\'s another step to get them to vote.
Can you see planetary LEOs rounding up \'vote dodgers\'  to do community 
service work for failing to vote?

It\'s interesting to watch what Congress does now near election 
times.  Those overnight polls can drive or kill legislation.

Sheesh. There are a lot of hands to wave when it comes to the violation of
physical laws in Traveller, but the line has to be drawn somewhere. Without
Shannon\'s law, things go a little crazy. Like you can support a nearly
infinite number of wireless phones on a teeny-tiny chunk of wireless
bandwidth. And XBoats would be able to carry around the entire accumulated
knowledge of the entire Third Imperium and transfer it in negligible time.

You\'d have things like entire encyclopedias written in one scratch on a stick.
(See, you take the two lengths on either side of the scratch and make a ratio.
Then you convert the ratio, which is just some really, really long real number
into a binary representation and then start breaking it into 8-bit chunks...
it\'s just a question of how carefully you can measure).

I mean, what do you want to break next? Pick a law (brain strains to remember
physical laws named after people... unnnggghhhhh) - Snell\'s Law? Newton\'s Law? 

Anyway, x-ray laser diodes are an interesting thought and they\'re probably
pretty safe as long as the power levels are kept low. My only problem would be
building a receiver. It\'s like have a neutrino communicator - sure, you can
generate the damn things and even code a signal on them - it\'s the detection
that\'s the tough part. 

Most of the problems relating to wireless bandwidth availability in the real
world are related to laws & regulatory issues, not technical ones. everyone
could have a cell phone capable of ISDN-like speeds or greater, if government
regulatory agencies were willing to erase existing frequency allocations. If
you got to start from scratch we\'d have a much simpler frequency allocation
setup with much larger chunks of bandwidth. Also, I\'m sure that things like
radio and TV would get much, much smaller allocations, if any. I mean,
compared to the demand for personal communication, is there really a need for
space for several dozen television stations over the air?

If we could start from scratch, the bandwidth breakdown would probably go to a
few major categories:

 - terrestrial personal communications (cell phones)
 - satellite personal communications (satellite-based cell phones)
 - high-bandwidth wireless backbones (point-to-point only)
 - GPS (satellite positioning systems)
 - entertainment (some radio & video)
 - military (which they can subdivide as they please)

I would expect that everything except the military would be purely digital, as
you can usually squeeze a lot more in that may (to the limit of Shannon\'s law)
and that there would be large, continuous chunks, unlike current schemes. See
http://www.fcc.gov/oet/faqs/freqchart.html and
http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/SSG/sf01608e.html and
http://www.jsc.mil/images/speccht.jpg for an example of what a freakin\' mess
things are around here right now.

Alternatively, some planets might take a more FCC-type approach and simply
carve up all the bandwidth into chunks then auction or sell them off to
whomever wants them. 

I imagine that megacorps play a big role in determining over-the-air frequency
allocations, as they\'re the ones who are selling you the equipment. Chances
are most planets will buy one of half a dozen personal communications
infrastructure packages so there will be a surprising amount of compatability
from world to world. There are some huge economies of scale to exploit in
Imperial space that will create de facto standards without any need for
regulatory intervention from the Imperial government.

As Traveller is set in the Third \'Imperium\' its only common sense that we

It should be noted that all "lacks a \'proper\' task system" means
is that modifiers for roles aren\'t listed in "easy, hard, etc"
format.  I put a table for this in my GURPS Traveller article
_years_ ago but it never get that much attention because, frankly,
it not that big a deal....

(BTW. In most roleplaying terms a "task system" is something
that resolves tasks and so every game system that has fundamental
mechanic for resolving events ("tasks") has a "task system".
In GURPS it is roll 3d6 against skill or attribute.)

I understand that some people don\'t like GURPS (every game has
people that don\'t like it).  But I think this attitude that you
have to trash GURPS because it isn\'t MT (or CT or TNE or whatever)
and because SJG isn\'t GDW isn\'t a product of our better natures.

Only if the system works in the same manner as a modern day democracy. Any
number of intermediary delegates can be inserted between the planetary level
and the Imperial level. Perhaps every world wouldn\'t get a representative,
especially if the system is based on population. Perhaps a bloc of several
worlds might get a representative.

Probably not. Can you really have a representative official who takes into
account the needs of 100 people, 1,000 people? 1,000,000 people? It\'s dicey,
at best, even with 100 people. That doesn\'t go far enough to prove why it
would be a problem in the Imperium.

On the other hand, you can have an accountable, representative official who
takes into account the needs of a world or a group of worlds. The dynamics
are entirely different, and much more workable.

>And if he is only one of 10,000 representatives, how
>much real voice do the people have?

The proportional amount that they should have in such a situation. That
actually sounds rather interesting to me. The political process in a "senate
city" would be utterly fascinating.

I still don\'t see why it has to be any of the above.

There was an old White Dwarf article, written by Andy Slack I think, that

Given the communications lag over the expanses of the Imperium, this
would probably be so slow as to be unworkable...remember, this is an
Empire where an entire war was once fought and finished before the
central authority heard about it and responded. (The Fourth Frontier
War).

Such a democracy also heavily skews Imperial policy towards the lightly
populated worlds, unless there\'s a population-based representation,
where many of the low-pop worlds will have their votes combined into a
single representative.

Remember the Imperium is big, really, REALLY  BIG! 

Let us posit, forinstance, a representative for each world with a
population greater than 10,000.

That\'s 9642 representatives, a huge, unweildy assembly.

Those representatives represent anywhere from 10,000 to 90,000,000
sophonts, clearly tilting political power to a minority of the
population.

So let\'s divvy \'em up evenly, 10,000,000 people per rep, which equals
1,978,921 representatives. This is the entire population of a large
city. 

We, in the US have trouble getting 465 representatives to agree on
something (or _anything_ it, would seem, sometimes). If you cut down the
number of representatives, then they become more and more remote from
their constituency...soon you have single people representing dozens, or
hundreds of systems.

You can see the problem of centralized democracy right away.

This is the same conundrum that Cleon I faced...way back when the Sylean
confederation was a simple handful of worlds, yet already their Senate
had broken down as an effective government.

Like it or not the most effective way to maintain a central government,
with the requisite flexibility needed in an expanse the size of the
Imperium is to have decentralized governance. Two ways spring to mind
immediately. One, a feudal system, where lower nobles are free to act in
their own authority, yet bound by ties of oath to higher authorities.

The second, a vast standardized bureacracy, such as Confucian China, or
the Vilani Ziru Siirka. That was known to have failed, because vast,
standardized bureacracies cannot react in anything resembling speed to
new problems. VSB\'s tend to carry big hammers, and everything looks like
a nail.

More to the point, however, is that none of this really much impacts the
great majority of the population at all. 

The old truism \'All politics is local\' applies...the government that
affects the people the most is not the Imperium, but who the local
dog-catcher is. This is the area where the Imperium has no control. You
can have flourishing democracies at this level, just as you can have
flourishing *-cracies, for each of the government UWP codes ;-)

Whether that local government is tied into the Imperium or not is
immaterial. So long as the basic rules of the Imperuium are obeyed, and
the (on a percapita basis) trivial Imperial taxes flow into the
Emperor\'s coffers, the Imperium has less effect on people\'s day-to-day
lives than the UN has on the average American\'s.

obTrav: Except, of course, for those who think the Emperor is flying
black helicopters full of Imperial shock troops around in a secret
effort to rule despotically :-)

The whole discussion is an offshoot of the debate concerning a democratic

is entirely different than the ones that people seem to be bringing up.

The Regency system, if I remember correctly, was one in which many nobles

I\'ve got one of those metal power supplies you can easily open and service.
But I think I have other Commodore "bricks" stored somewhere too.  Right now
all I have ia a marginally functional C-64 with power.  (the keyboard is

That\'s the hard part.  In a pawnshop once I saw a Hewlett-Packard 150
computer (proprietary 8088) with a 15meg hard drive.  The pawnshop guy had a
3,000 price on it and a "SALE!" sticker on it dropping it down to $1,000.

If any of you know what this system is, you\'ll be laughing hard about now.

What about Federated government? You can have republican style governance, 
where the lowest level is that which a proportionate representative can have 
reasonable contact with its\' constituents, and the upper level would be that 
were time lag prohibits flexible response to crises. Call it oh, a half 
million sophonts. A bicameral legislature prevents skews toward high or low 
population worlds, and multiple layers of government (planetary, subsector, 
sector) help to streamline matters (keep appropriate legislation to 
appropriate levels - who wants the sector congress to debate the water rights 
on Regina for example...).

    I think that this breaks down for foreign policy though ... as per the 
4th. FW. In this case, a strong executive ruling through bureaucracy works 
well (whether Feudal or civil service...). The key is APPROPRIATE governance. 
Keep Domain and Imperial rule limited to foreign policy and overall Imperial 
policy and guidelines. As long as there is local oversight (voting every ten 
years or so for an elected moot to pick a chief executive and have the locals 
control the amount of the moneys contributed to the Imperial budget for 
example), you have a doable modified republican style decentralized Imperium.

IIRC, jump projectors would beam energy over to the ship that was
intending to jump.  Once the capacitors were charged up, the ship would
use the power to initiate jump.

This also ties into the interminable "how does a ship use its jump fuel"
debate (I choose not to take sides, should that one start up again).

There are two FFS spreadsheets I know of. Andy Akin\'s FFS2 for the design
of starships and my T4 gunsmith for weapons. You can find them at:

On my Web site, you can download the spreadsheets (Akins ver 3.2, for
Excel 5.0, with a bug fix in G-comp) used to create a variety of
AuricTech Shipyards designs.  If you have a general idea of the type of
ship you want to build, you can use these designs as a starting point. 
I only ask that you give AuricTech credit if you use one of our ships
"off-the-shelf", so to speak.  The URL is:

I can\'t find the rules for figuring beam weapon

the "compact" option.

In the latter case, p.124 states the compact

The problem is there are no formulas for reducing
the weight/volume or increasing cost.

Does anyone know what/where this info is?

I was going to make an uncharitable comment, along the lines of,
"Obviously not; his handling of the OOP DGP material displays no
intelligence, of either natural or artificial varieties."  However, I
realized that such a comment would be unworthy, so I won\'t make it.

My ISP was down for most of the last week, so I\'m playing catchup on the
list.

While it was down, however, I started getting Traveller withdrawals, and
started designing a new campaign.  In a fit of fundamentalism, I built it
entirely around LBB 1-3!

I did actually wimp out a little, and conceded that certain other books
were OK, like Citizens of the Imperium, *some* of the gear from Mercenary,
and, of course, Mayday, and I accepted some of the gear from the post-1977
CT rules sets - the g-carrier, for example.

On balance, though, I stayed pretty orthodox.  There are quite an
interesting set of assumptions implicit in the original rules, although I\'m
not sure quite how to rationalise the jump routes generated from "that
table" with the ship encounter table.  Of course the jump route table is
quite useless unless you are using a computerised world generation tool
like Galactic - it makes a terrible mess of your map, is incredibly boring
to work with, and it\'s hard to keep track of where you are.  I\'ve seldom
bothered to use it when generating subsectors by hand.

One issue I ran into was that I was assuming that there was no real
overarching interstellar state - just some microstates, indicated by the
presence of Captive Government worlds - and I found that Scout bases were
appearing all over the place, and I couldn\'t really justify why, if the
Scouts were essentially planetary services.  The scouts, I think, suggest
the presence of some kind of interstellar government, although it may be
fairly loose.  Alternatively, it could mean that most planetary navies tend
to use fairly informal structures, or else the scouts are a non-military,
commercial operation.  (Ahh!  Thinking out loud has its benefits).

The other thing that gave me an urge to start tweaking worlds was the
presence of Captive Governments.  There is no guarantee that a suitable
"owner" can be found anywhere nearby, and I was reluctant to put them too
far away, given that there were independent worlds in between.  Of course
it\'s possible to handwave explanations of this government type that don\'t
involve owner worlds, but I was attempting to read things in the most
literal and traditionalist manner.  So I had to start fudging stuff by
hand.

Anyway, it was lots of silly fun, and I may even go nuts enough to
eventually actually run this thing.  Back to the Future!

For everyone else, here\'s a quote from Gibbon\' "Decline and Fall of the
Roman Empire":
(Riots have broken out in Constantinople involving the chariot racing
factions - the blues and the greens.  The hippodrome is the stadium.)
"It was an easy and a decisive measure to revive the animosity of the
factions;  the blues were astonished at their own guilt and folly, that a
trifling injury should provoke them to conspire with their implacable
enemies against a gracious and liberal benefactor;  they again proclaimed
the majesty of Justinian;  and the greens, with their upstart emperor, were
left alone in the hippodrome.  The fidelity of the guards was doubtful; but
the military force of Justinian consisted in three thousand veterans, who
had been trained to valor and discipline in the Persian and Illyrian wars. 
Under the command of Belisarius and Mundus, they silently marched in two
divisions from the palace, forced their obscure way through narrow
passages, expiring flames, and falling edifices, and burst open at the same
moment the two opposite gates of the hippodrome.  In this narrow space the
disorderly and affrighted crowd was incapable of resisting on either side a
firm and regular attack;  the blues signalized the fury of their
repentence, and it is computed that above thirty thousand persons were
slain in the merciless and promiscuous carnage of the day."  
(Gibbon continues with the punishment of the leaders of the revolt.)

As you can see, this stuff has been lifted by both Pournelle and Drake. 
This gives us a clue as to a technique we can use in scenario design -
stealing stuff from history and literature.  The traditional literary
source to steal from is of course Shakespeare.  I\'m not quite sure how to
do "Hamlet in Space", though.  "The Tempest" might work.  There may be
elements of it in "Forbidden Planet", though it\'s been years since I\'ve
seen it.

This is why I\'ve always considered Dulinor to be a demogogue and a
charlatan.  His "democratic" claims were always likely to be held hostage
to maintaining the support of the nobility.

Well,  maybe a cynic might suggest some opportunism and separatism in

Yeah, Regina is \'home\' for me too, although I usually spread out into Lanth
and Aramis as well, and Vilis (Free Tanoose!), and District 268, and....

Among the Rebellion factions, I\'m a Brzk groupie.  Publically, that\'s on
the basis of his pan-sophontism, which sets him aside from reactionaries
like Lucan, Margaret, Vland, and, of course, the Solomani.  In private
though, it\'s because of the sheer madness of a Vargr trying to become
emperor....

Heheh.  Gotta love that one.  "Mr Efrattian, you\'re under arrest for not 
voting on the new zoning laws.  Come with us, please."  I can just *see* 
something like this happening on a place like Gralyn.  <evil grin>

Check out a book called \'Heaven Belt\' (author\'s name slips my limited mind at the moment).  One of the local cultures used what they called a \'Demarchy\', a democratic anarchy tied together with computerised voting, to \'rule\'.  They practically lived by straw polls, and *nobody* really liked media consultants, but treated them like nukes; the other side has \'em, so our side gets a few, too.  <grin>

It\'s not exactly intuitive, but it\'s there.  Volume for weapons is
calculated in Chapter 3 (p42), buried in the description of weapon weight. 
For simplicity, weapon volume in cf is almost always Wt/50, unless they are
concealed in the structure.  GT weapons are generally not treated as being
concealed (even spinal mounts, which seems a bit odd to me, but what the
heck.)

Not bad.  It\'s holding up better than mine is.  Personally, I think it must
have come from someplace in Far Frontiers sector or something like it
(Foreven?)  It\'s from no known culture, and most of the surrounding area is
charted, so that lets out anything canonical.

It started with some complaints about the Regency setting for TNE. I asked

There was cargo space onboard.  Mebbe 100 dtons, IIRC.

They had contact with *somebody* from across the Claw; that case of wine came
from Terra.  Mebbe a minor race from spinward of Reavers\' Deep?

Definitely agree on that point.  Course, the cool thing is, it takes 1 to 6 
weeks for the boat to recharge, *and* it was a slow moving boat in normal 
space, relying solely on the two boats for thrust.  <grin>  Makes life 
interesting for PCs to have to deal with stuff like that.  And if the boat 
enters the system *inside* the solar jump radius, it\'ll take awhile to move 
it out to safe jump territory.  <grin>

Just because you can *store* a lotta power doesn\'t mean you can *release* it
instantly.  Try shorting out a car battery someday.  Use a *thick* cable or
else it\'ll melt on you.

A battery *isn\'t* a jump capacitor.  Though it could possibly *feed* a jump
capacitor.  And I still don\'t get the physics behind a jump projector; IIRC,
they first came about from one of Andy Slack\'s \'Expanding Universe\' series.
IMTU, ain\'t no such critter, as there\'s no grid to dump the capacitors in.
I *don\'t* buy the handwave of dumping power into somebody *else\'s* grid.  CT
& MT jump drives need *control* to open a jump tunnel.  A projector wouldn\'t
give that.

A couple of suggestions for "lifeboats". 

Drive. 

First, forget any *major* drive. The boats need enough power to get
away from the ship if there\'s a chance of an explosion. And enough to
*slowly* rendezvous with each other later. Or to have a somewhat
controlled re-entry from planetary orbit.

The rendezvous bit is because a group of lifeboats is easier to locate
than individual. And because if there are any survivors with vacsuit
experience, you can link the "boats" and share power & consumables.

I said "rentry from orbit" because that\'s doable. Anything moving at
typical "run to/from Jump" speeds is moving to darn fast for any
reasonable power plant to let it achieve orbit, much less land.

Hull.

In spite of limits set by most rules on ship construction, I\'d say that
only one "side" of a lifeboat need to meet the minimum structure
limits/hull thickness. The boat orients to place that and the drive &
other equipment between the lifesystem and the local star. Given the
properties of high TL hull material, that should suffice to give
"shadow shielding" from most flares. 

The rest of the boat can be lightweight composites and plastics. 

Other.
Life support should be a lot cruder than on shipboard. Probably time
limited. Instead of recycling air & water, there will likely be
chemical canisters to remove excess CO2 (lithium hydroxide or the
like), water (various dessicants), and "trace gases" (activated
charcoal). 

I could see a setup that uses shadow temps to condense water from the
air system instead of using dessicant chemicals. That\'d stretch the
water supply. 

With the above sort of thinking, I\'d expect some sort of "lifeboat" to
be a bit more reasonable.

BTW, there\'s an old James White book "Lifeboat" that deals with the
survivors of an accident taking to the lifeboats. He got a lot right,
even though he made some *howling* errors (the biggest one being that
you *can\'t* kill spin, nor change the spin axis, simply by crawling
around. It *requires* steering jets or flywheels). He also overlooked
the need for radiation shielding.

Actually, mere *optical* fiber is adequate. We haven\'t gotten near the
Shannon limit on fiber yet. As I recall, it\'ll be well above the
terabit mark. And given multimode (multi-frequency) fiber and tunable
lasers, you can get multiple independent terabit links over the same
fiber. 

I expect that they\'ll have gone back to a "hierachical" model of sorts.
Your coffee pot may well be networked. But it will talk only on your
house/apartment net. It\'ll be possible to access it from outside *if*
you are allowed thru the firewall.

Likewise, there may be building level networks for office buildings and
apartment buildings. And so on up thru "neighborhood", city, region,
and planetary nets. 

At each level only traffic that *needs* to go betwwen nets reaches that
level of the network. And there\'d be a lot of caching for info
resources and the like. So rather than hundreds or thousands of packets
carrying copies of that neat MP999 file from half a world away, the
regional net will notice that there\'s another request for the same
file, so it\'ll supply the second thru 9999th from the cached copy.
Ditto at the city, and maybe even neighborhood level. This requires
more storage, but less bandwidth. And I expect that storage will be
*more* than up to it.

In fact, I expect that "web pages" will likely get duplicated bewteen
cities/regions, rather than accessed directly. It saves *way* so much
bandwidth that it\'s the logical way to handle it. So web pages would be
"mirrored" all over the place.

Interplanetary traffic is going to be a lot more bandwidth limited.
*Far* lower data rates for two reasons. First, the available bandwidth
is far more sharply limited. On a planet, you can run multiple fibers
in parallel to get more bandwidth, and extra fibers via other routes
for redundancy & backup. Between planets, you can only run so much
traffic at any given frequency. 

Second, due to the speed of light, the latency of the transmission goes
*way* up. That is, the time between when a packet is sent, and when the
sending end gets an ACK/NAK (packet received ok/packet needs to be
resent) from the other end. We are talking *hours* here. 

So "priority" news & email will be sent via radio/laser between
planets, low priority news, mail, and "web content" will be sent via
storage media on ships (xboats). 

So inside star systems, we\'ll have a two tier sort of comm situation.
Local stuff is "instant". Interplanetary stuff is either hours old, or
*days* old when it arrives. And, of course, stuff from other star
systems is *always* "days old". 

But this is going to be a *very* sharp break. As an example, stuff from
Mars would reach Earth anywhere from 5 minutes after the fact to more
than half an hour (possibly much more, since when Mars is on the
opposite side of the sun, it\'d have to relay thru a third planet).
Pluto is less than 6 hours away by radio. But anything coming via ship
will take more than a *week* (assuming an insystem jump) or months to
*years*. 

That\'s going to have an effect. 

> Or have they found a way around Shannon\'s law?

Unlikely. Shannon\'s law is more like "2+2=4" than "c is the speed limit".

See above. As a rule, figure that the higher the bandwidth, the shorter
the distance you can use it at.

Not the same thing. The bandwidth of the phone line is 300-3000 or
300-4000 Hz. Shannon\'s law with an appropriate signal to noise ration
gives pretty much the limiting bit rate we see (28,800 to 33,600). The
56k is only possible in one direction, and is actually vioilating the
bandwidth limit of the line.

But I can still beat it by running the same setup over each fiber of a
multi-fiber cable. :-)

It\'s actually derived from *math*, not physics. 

        C= W log2( 1 + S/N )

        C = throughput in bit per second
        W = bandwidth in hertz
        S/N = signal to noise ratio


300-3000 = 2700 Hz. 300-4000 =3700 Hz

28800 = 2700 * log2(1+S/N)	33600 = 3700 * log2(1+S/N)
10.67 = log2(1+S/N)		9.08 = log2(1+S/N)
1625.5 = 1+S/N			541.6 = 1+S/N
1624.5 = S/N			540.6 = S/N

So it looks like we want an S/N ratio of around 1000.

Why we need such a high signal to noise ratio, I don\'t know. But we do.

Please note that there have been a number of democracies since Athens.
I seem to recall that at least one of the Italian city-states tried it
during the Renaisance. And, of course, we have Revolutuonary France. 

Also note that one of the major features of the Athenian democracy was
voting on who had offended/irritated enough people that he would be
exiled from the city. 

Other democracies had similar "tyranny of the majority" problems. And
the founding fathers of the US were quite *aware* of these
shortcomings. That\'s why they did their best to *keep* the US from
being a democracy. 

In a democracy, the majority is right. Period. In what we started with
(and still *mostly* have), there are things that not even a majority
vote is allowed to do. Though that is getting eroded as fast as
possible by politicians who care more about getting elected than about
consequences.

Look it up?

Weight:
16 ounces = 1 pound
2000 pounds = 1 ton

length
12 inches = 1 foot
3 feet = 1 yard
5280 feet = 1 mile

area
640 acres = 1 sq. mile

volume
8 fl. ounces = 1 pint
2 pints = 1 quart
4 quarts = gallon

also 231 cu. inches = 1 gallon

Those should get you thru 99% of the American measurements.

"Jump projectors" require one *other* item, which is far more
important. They require the ability to "impose" a jump field or bubble
from *outside*. Without that, all the long term storage in the world
won\'t help. 

So the Annic Nova *doesn\'t* present that problem inasmuch as it
requires the jump drive to be part of the object being jumped. 

Ditto for the "power plant".

"Flatlander" gives a very good description.

If I could come up with something *else* that would plausibly cause
similar effects, I\'d love to write a scenario of players exploring a
new but very odd system. Make sure to call their attention to the story
beforehand. That way they\'ll be *certain* what you are trying to do.
And wrong. :-)

The compact option comes into play during the weight and cost 
calculation.  You get 1/2 weight for 4 times cost ... using the 
standard lbs to cf rules, then the size is also halved.

Under the Weight Calculation it is the L variable.
Under Cost, it is an optional calculation.

I would agree with this ... unless you find yourself between two stars 
in a binary system.  Granted that not all stars are so close as to 
cause a problem, but if it ever did happen you would probably want 
to shoot the engineer then :)

I wish to point out that this suggestion, along with those that follow,
assume that your lifeboat serves no other function.  Working boats with
lifeboat capability need to have all the facilities of any other working
boat (decent drive, Standard or Extended life support, full hull, etc.).

For a single-purpose lifeboat (equivalent to an inflatable raft with
provisions), your suggestions are quite useful.  In fact, AuricTech may
incorporate them into a future design.  Some of us, though, envision
functional small craft that can, at need, serve as lifeboats for
extended periods of time.

Exactly.  Thus, assuming the energy accumulators *aren\'t* jump capacitors, 
Annic Nova *doesn\'t* break later canon.  You still have to bleed power into 
the capacitors to jump, and that is gonna take some time.

IMTU, no. What they have done IMTU is go to multiple frequency fibre optic
backbones (TL8, maybe even 7), lots of short range LOS Radio links as nodes
on the network, and personal devices generally use frequency-switching
links to these local nodes for long distance (TL 7-8). Usually full duplex,
sometimes multiple "Channel pairings", say two or three download channels,
and 1-2 upload channels. These radio-ties then are the equivalent of modern
PPP dial-ins, on multi-tiered exploded stars off of a "Spaghetti Ring" (a
term a CS major I know taught me, origin unkown, referring to a ring with
multiple shortcuts across it... and a central hub which is only used for
up-link to next higher level) and these rings have an organization of
larger and larger tiers from their central hubs.

Most TL 9-15 worlds IMTU have major 16-bit "text" transfer capabilities,
with an XGML based protocol... you can usually set your machine to contact
the local starport machine for local XGML "libraries"; local machines will
usually come with them on rom. Likewise, character sets are available. Part
of the scout service\'s duties IMTU are information compatability and
systemic interoperability standards maintenance.

Because the imperial government cuts a slight tax discount on worlds that
adhere to standard computer protocols within the Imperium, and to those who
do not locally issue currency, etc, ad nauseum, compliance has local
governments\' blessings. In many things. And part of Survey\'s job is to
figure the tax assessments.

Then again, IMTU, a large part of what would be Civil Bureaucracy in many
people\'s TU\'s is migrated to the Scouts. Handling tax monies, administering
spacecraft liscensures, mail, field work for the various compliance
ministries, and internal intelligence for the imperial government, and
actually developing standards are all part of the massive scout service. I
figure the scouts to be almost as large in terms of personell as the Navy
or Marines, and I use the Cr500/annum/sophont for imperial forces figure.
and the scouts get Cr 75 of this... that\'s a huge budget, especially
considering that, at KCr 100 per year per scout (including ship & base
budgets), that\'s 1 scout per roughly 1400 people in the imperium. I
actually use a ratio of 1 per 4000 sophonts, but assume more in hardware
and upkeep.

Hmm... MT damage is simply a way of moving the attribute penalty figuring
till after the combat, and using the striker armor and penetration ratings
to modify expected damage. It really speeds up combats, IME. Mind you, it
doesn\'t save the players much time total, because they still have to apply
the dice to individual attributes, but it means not having to make the
damage rolls for spear chuckers.

I have found that (unless using the personal combat rules for ship-to-ship
combats) the numbers involved are all 3 places or less. When you start
taking pot-shots at ships or Bolos/Ogres, they have 4-6 place hits
tracks...but most of the time, you won\'t get significant damage. It also is
flexible, especially when doing large scale combat ala Ref\'s Companion,
something I found lacking in CT, Striker, TNE, T4, and GURPS.

But not British, or Imperial, measurements where 1 ton = 2240 lbs and a 
gallon is defined as the volume of 10 lbs of water (at a certain 
density, etc, etc), or about 277.4 cu. inches. The fluid ounces are 
different, too - there are 20 Imperial fluid ounces in an Imperial 
pint. So in response to whoever posted that the 3I naturally uses the 
Imperial system - GURPS Traveller doesn\'t do that, either.

Antti Lahtinen has also made up some FFS1 spreadsheets for Excel, a 
starship, a small arms, and I think a heavy weapons one. These can be 
found on his site at <http://www.ee.tut.fi/~lahtinen/Traveller/> and 
are very popular with those of us on the TNE-RCES list.

Similarly, on p. 142 the weight (and therefore volume) of a "compact"
weapon is half that of a standard one ("L is 0.5 if compact option, 1
otherwise," where L is one factor of weight.) On p. 127, "Options:
Quadruple the cost of any "compact" beam weapons."

To date, GT beam weapons have generally used the compact option only two
TLs after introduction, when the cost drops to what the unmodified version
cost originally.

Look at regina subsector... assume that info flows along routes at J4 max
(and goes node to node), and from route nodes at J2; time per jump is 7
days mean including info transfer. Assume INSTANT decision making upon
reciept of the issue (not a logical assumption, but simplifies the math),
and that the issue is generated in the chambers at Regni on Regina.

We know Regina to be the subsector Capitol. Turnaround 0 days.
2 week turnaround: Forboldn, Hefry, ROUP, RUIE, Jenghe, Yori
4 week turnaround: Knorbes, Whanga, Feri, Pscias, Woshiers, Yurst
6 week turnaround: Alell, EFATE**, Uskya, Boughene, ENOPE, Shionthy,
Moughas, ALGINE, Rethe, Inthe, Pixie*, Beck\'s World,
8 week turnaround: Kinorb, Yres, Menorb, Yorbund, Keng
10 week turnaround: Heya, Dentus.

* Assumes straight run from Feri to Pixie, bypassing Boughene.
** Efate gets it via J2 off route faster than via X-Mail on route, even
though it is a route node!

So, assuming everyone gets the message, and every sophont has to make an
immediate snap decision, the subsector body cannot vote for at least 10
weeks on any issue AFTER all modifications (time for instructions from home
on all issues). And when you figure that that could take 8 days per jump,
rather than 7, we\'re up to 80 days, plus a reasonable time for decision
making at the far end of 5 days (including the polling), plus reasonable
turn around of 1 day per jump, we hit 94 days. Just for a subsector level
decision.

At these same rates, you can have a round trip time (assuming the ideal
conditions in force before the immediately above paragraph), messages to
mora have up to 34 weeks IDEAL travel out and back; there are 52 weeks, 1
day to the imperial year of 13 months of 4 weeks each... so 8.5 imperial
months round trip, or 2/3 of a year. that gives even a representative at
least 4 months to screw things up before he\'s recallable, and thus even
representation is bad.

And on the imperium wide ideals, it\'s 6 months via J4 from MORA to Capitol,
assuming I got the routes right... ONE WAY...

I think my point is that as a logical system for mesurement, Imperial
dosent measure up (pun intended).

Metric is a system that allows a simple base 10 increase in scales. When I
designed my first GURPS vehical, I had to recalculate my mass due to the
problem mentioned above. And since the metre is base of all mesurements, 1m
x 1m x 1m of water equals 1 ton of mass *and* displacement . That is
something impossable with Imperial.

Dont get me wrong, I sometimes drop to Imperial for mesurements (my parents
where born before metric conersion), I sometimes use feet and inches, but
even they mostly use litres and grams and meters.

For Europeans, Canadians and Australians use this scale, and so did
Traveller.

It\'s 20dt, 76MCr and provides escape for *one* overlord + minion

Of course, I could have made it 100dt and jump capable, but that would be
silly - I was aiming for 10dt.

Its not that I don\'t like GURPS (I have  about  a  dozen  non-G:T
GURPS books) I was saying that *if* GDW had survived I would have
preferred it  if  GDW  had  evolved  Traveller  from  MT  onwards
(instead of TNE or IG\'s T4).

I was also trying to say that 2300AD was a more logical candidate
for being  "TNE-ised".  The  comment  about  GDW\'s  house  system
becoming a GURPS replacement was *not*  to  be  taken  completely
seriously.  It was ment as a friendly dig at the G:T fans on this
list.

However, if I have given offense to you or anyone else on the TML
with these comments then I apologise.

I heard that AI was delayed \'cos of a hard disk crash wiping  out
6 months work.  Then when Roger Sanger got hold of DGP  he  tried
to develop his own multi gerne GURPS-like system ... one  of  the
initial gernes was to be AI.

Roger\'s development plan involved setting up a mailing  list  and
inviting TML members onto it.  There they would write it for him.
However, without proper  project  management  it  never  achieved
anything (despite some heroic efforts from the  participants).  I
know this because I was one of the unfortunates who signed up for
this for a while.  Curiously there was no AI material from  which
to start from and we had a clean slate.  I\'ve often wondered what
happened to the work Joe Fugate did on AI ... Roger didn\'t appear
to have it, just the basic concept.

Thank you, Tom Schoene and Thomas Bont, for pointing
out the location of the rules. I\'m too used to FFS\'s
consolidating construction info in tables and was
completely blind to the _text_ formatting.

By the by, everyone, Mr. Bont (aka Felix) has really
done a great job on his GURPS Character Maker
software. If you play (or GM) GT, do yourself a favor
and check it out. It\'s *very* easy to customize the
database to your own campaign (I doing it now). He
also has the equivalent software for GT ships, which
is also easy to customize.

Just go to http://www.felixcafe.com/ and follow the

Thanks again, guys!

Antti Lahtinen has also made up some FFS1 spreadsheets for Excel, a

found on his site at <http://www.ee.tut.fi/~lahtinen/Traveller/> and

    'body' => 'I was thinking of the fate of Annic Nova\'s previous crew. One poster had
thought that a child was the last survivor, and died alone somehow
after everyone had succumbed to the plague they picked up somewhere.
I think there to the story than this.

By looking over the contents of the various bedrooms, I estimate 
that the complement of the Annic Nova had been between twelve and
fourteen people, at least four of them children. (IIRC we had
seven in-use adult sleeping places, four children\'s beds, one
purported bedroom (one or two people) that had been sterilized thus
indicating it had been in use, and the death room which may or 
may not have been an in-use bedroom before the tragedy).

IIRC we have four bodies (three adults and one child). Where did
the others go?

In my opinion, Annic Nova was abandoned by somewhere between
six and ten survivors, including a number of adults, by means of a third
ship\'s boat that is, of course, not present when the adventurers
discover the ship.

Here\'s my "evidence":

1. There was little portable equipment in evidence, certainly nothing
like a usual "ship\'s locker" would have. Indicates: someone packed the
portable gear aboard an escape craft.

2. The ship was in good order, almost nothing out of place. 
Indicates: the ship was not abandoned in a panic, and it was
not occupied for a long time period by unsupervised children.
(Granted, Spacer children may have it ingrained very early to
keep things cleaned up and put away.)

3. As presented, Annic Nova\'s design requires a ship\'s boat
to be moved from a pylon to a docking berth before any
acceleration can take place. This docking berth is not only
empty, but the doors at that berth (IIRC) show signs of some
of the only damage on this well-preserved ship.
Indicates: A third ship\'s boat was present, perhaps one with
engines better than the other two (for better than the .1-.2 G
acceleration the others are capable of when attached to the
ship). The pilot was perhaps unfamiliar with undocking procedures,
causing him to damage the doors while leaving with a load of
supplies, equipment, and survivors.

4. The near-empty cargo bay.
Indicates: Inconclusive. Did the survivors clear out a cargo hold full
of supplies and equipment when they abandoned ship, or did they
simply not find a profitable cargo at the port of call that lead to
the tragedy? If the former, again we have an adult or adults 
probably leading the escape.

5. No mention is made of the plague being contagious beyond
the initial infection of the adventurers after the Death Room is
opened.
Indicates: It takes some time after the death of the host for this
plague to sporulate. Prompt disposal or preservation of the body
should halt or delay spread of the contagion.

My take on events aboard the Annic Nova:

1. Annic Nova calls at an unknown planet. Some members of the crew
are unknowingly infected with a plague that shows no symptoms for
several days. Possibly: one or two members of the crew brought
an item on board that carried the plague spores, and were first to
fall sick.

2. Annic Nova comes out of jump, and some members of the crew
fall sick. Death can be almost immediate once symptoms appear.
A crewman (probably the leader of the ship\'s complement) sterilizes
the stateroom occupied by the initial victims, hoping to eliminate the
source of the infection. The body or bodies may have been eliminated
in the process, especially if they are already dead. If not, the bodies
may have been moved to the Death Room (either to die, or with some 
autopsy or burial intent).

3. Other members of the crew fall sick, and are placed in the 
Death Room. A child places a warning sign on the door, probably
after another child falls ill. The newly stricken crew members
die quickly. Some of these crew members may be those who
handled the sterilization of the initial infection room - and the
leader of the ship\'s complement was almost certainly among
them, if he was not one of the first to die.

4. With no indication of how the new crew infections occurred,
the current, somewhat inexperienced captain loses his nerve.
Instead of sterilizing the Death Room (and possibly ending the
contagion cycle), he leads the remaining crew complement in
abandoning the ship. Supplies and equipment are brought along,
but only the "big ship\'s boat" (the missing third, centrally-docked
craft) is taken. Some minor damage to Annic Nova occurs during
the undocking maneuver.

5. Annic Nova is sent, probably by computer command, into
the depths of space as a plague ship. Her indecipherable
transmissions are warn-away signals, but some error in the
computer controls has made her follow some unknown course
through jump-space, rather than simply float off into the void.

6. The survivors make landing on a planet, either uninhabited
or beyond the ken of the Third Imperium. It is up to question
whether they succumbed to the plague, or whether they have
founded a tiny colony and survived.

participatory democracy (Kiri, IIRC), while others have been dealing
with the modern idea of a representative democracy.  The question of
scale, or level of government, is also relevant.  For example, here
in Canada the government of one province (Quebec) wishes to secede 
from the country (Canada).  As a democracy, should the entire country
vote?  Just Quebecers?  If Quebec decided to stay, could certain 
regions within Quebec secede?  What about a town?  A farm?  Some guy
in a hut in the wilderness?

Meanwhile, the worlds in the Imperium have all sorts of governments.
This would not in itself prevent democracy above the level of the
individual world.  If ~10,000 representatives proves to be unweildly,
each subsector (~300) or sector (~20) can provide one.  These 
representatives can be elected by representatives of worlds or
subsectors, or may be inherited nobility.  Is it democracy?  That 
depends on how you look at it.

Hamlet:  Instead of a ghost, a holographic recording of the dead king
triggered by Hamlet\'s approach.  The King spells out his concerns about his
brother.

Forbidden Planet was pretty much a direct rip of The Tempest.  For
traveller, the Krell city becomes an Ancient site, and the id monster an
unconscious psionic attack.

Running into the eternal problem of copy latentcy...are you sure that
the copy you\'ve mirrored is up to date, and the mirrors of the mirrors,
etc on down the chain. Granted, there are things with checksums you can
do to confirm it, so multiple mirrors are useful, but there will be
problems with this, particularly regarding time-sensitive information.

Meaning a good hacker can spoof the local copy of information for
whatever nefarious purposes they want...\'The Sting\' anyone? ;-)

Sounds very reasonable. But they do not have a large enough gene pool to
form a viable colony, unless YTU has a way around that. They could be

I don\'t think they\'ve been missing more than a couple of years,
almost certainly less than a generation. You\'re correct, a
Traveller version of _The Search for the Castaways_ is pretty
much what I had in mind. Some detective work on the ship,
especially in the ship\'s computer (if it hasn\'t been reformatted)

Or perhaps one of the heroes is comatose in a low berth, 
in the grip of the plague, and the heroes need to track down
a human(oid) who survived exposure to it so they can make
a lifesaving antibody...

I recall the Annic Nova plague had less effect on people who had scout
service immunizations. Perhaps the survivors of that infested IISS AHL
suffered from a similar bug, and a immunization was found for it and 
added to the cocktail every scout gets. Not quite the right one for
immunity, but close enough to increase survival chances. 

Now, if a scout character in the party had detailed knowledge of that
voyage (medic skill +education roll to have seen the reports?), he might
not only be owed a bonus on fighting the disease - but he might also
get clues on where Annic Nova might have been, if the diseases had
the same origin.

Of course, the two diseases could be entirely unrelated...

After reading and studying MT for a few years, and going over TNE (hey, don\'t 
hate me!!), I tend to agree with this.  Without a consistent task system, the 
rules are a bit weak.  MT fixed this to a point.  From what I see in TNE, 
this got fixed even more, with skills being paired up with a stat (something 
that MT didn\'t get into).  The only \'deal killer\' for most Traveller players 
I\'ve talked to was the useage of non D6 dice.  But having \'made my bones\' 
with AD&D, this doesn\'t bother me much.

One of my \'biggies\' about CT was, after Mercenary et al came out, *nobody* 
wanted to run one of the \'other\' carreers such as the ones in Citizens 
because they ended up \'way underskilled\' compared to B4+ characters.  I also 
saw \'monster characters\' generated, so overskilled that they could do almost 
anything they wanted to do under the LBB rules.  Played pure hell for game 
balance.  What was *really* needed was a way to bring them all into balance.  
For the most part, MT *tried* to do this, but didn\'t quite finish the job.  
There *should* have been a \'Here\'s how you do extended chargen for *any* 
career\' section in the rules someplace.

IMTU, the background was *great*.  Finally, a millieu where antisocial (aka 
\'normal PC behaviour\') was not only acceptable, but actually *useful* to the 
galaxy at large.  (ducking)  And later stages of the Rebellion (ca. 1122 
onward) starts having the feel of the original LBBs in that monster ships 
aren\'t that common anymore, and the force of law of the Imperium isn\'t around 
much anymore as the Navy is just too busy trying to stay alive like everybody 
else.  <grin>

I can somewhat agree with this.  Virus was just too big a hammer to hit, and 
the 70 year \'fast dawn\' kind of seemed hokey, considering the canonical \'Long 
Night\' between the Ramshackle Empire and the Third Imperium.  Considering 
that people living during the Long Night didn\'t have to worry about Virus and 
it *still* took them centuries to bounce back, with *no* black war actions 
against the RE, the 70 year \'fast dawn\' looks absolutely ridiculous.

*Some* of the Changes were okay.  Some of them weren\'t, for me, at least.  
I\'m still studying the ruleset in the few moments I\'m able to devote to it.  
The alternate tech sections of FFS1 were *VERY* interesting concepts to play 
with.  <grin>  I\'ve been looting^H^H^H^H^H^H^Hmining it for some ideas for my

Haven\'t seen this ruleset yet.  And the M:0 concept did kinda turn me off.  
Having followed Traveller from nearly the beginning, the concept of M:0 
seemed to be a bit of a straightjacket for me, since I knew what was coming 
and supposedly needed to adjust things to match \'history\'.  Otherwise, I\'d 
get to throw out all OTU history and begin from scratch again.  That\'s 20 
*years* worth of developement from some minds that are a *LOT* sharper than 
mine was on my best day.

Never played GURPS.  It looked too \'Swiss Army knifey\' to me, and previous 
experience with things trying to be all things to all people left me with the 
impression that such attempts are doomed to end up with something that works 
poorly for everybody.  An interesting concept, though, I\'ll give SJG that 
much.  And I *did* have some experience with SJG products before; I was a 
total nut for Car Wars for a quick afternoon \'beer & pretzels\' timeburning 
game.  CW was also a big fave of my old FTF groups as well.

I\'ve seen the adventures in Challenge, of course, but don\'t happen to have a

The ease of metric is exagerated.  One doesn\'t really convert that
much in English Units.  You generally just stick with the unit that
are convenient.

Vehicles is like this to.  All you ever have convert between
is Lbs and Tons and cf and dtons (which aren\'t metric in either
system, though nobody ever seems to be complain about that :-)

The fact is that, for most Americans, it is probably less work to
keep using English units than go through the hassle and expense
of learning a new system and switching.

Information Access

Information access will vary wildly from region to region, just
as governments and cultures vary.  Depending on subsector
regulations (if any), regional regulations (if any), and system
regulations (if any), information may be accessible according
to widely published interfaces, or controlled through productized
protocols.

Terms:

raw information: data that is not passed as an encoded
signal for human communications

specialized information: data that is passed as an encoded
signal for human communications.

Using standard Imperial hardware and protocols, data transfer is
usually only limited by control codes; most specialized information
transfers are realtime, including multicast audio, video, panoramic
video, and trideo transception.  Raw information transfer time will
vary depending on the amount of data transferred and transformations
performed on the data as a part of broadcast or reception.

Specialized information transfer (text/voice/video and trideo) may be a
bottleneck for developing worlds (TL9-), because the technologies\'
information transfer capability is on the same order of magnitude as
the amount of information transferred.  However, since specialized
information is generally of a fixed rate, later technologies find it easy
to transfer this data.  The bottleneck will always be with \'raw\'
information, consisting of continuous data fed from a sensor or database.
In fact, specialized information transfer is merely a quantization of raw
data flow at different "speeds", so one can expect a new technology
to open up a new specialized data transfer method.

By TL9, "real-time" video is common.  By TL10, "real-time"
trideo is common.  By TL12, human communications over the data
network adds essentially no load to it.  All load bottlenecks are due to
"raw" data.

[ Argument: video displays are very specialized hunks
of hardware; they need only display at human readable
resolutions on certain sized display areas.  The limit
for video displays at a given tech level is achieveable
and even surpassable by the tech level, but due to human
limitations it is not necessary to surpass them beyond
an order of magnitude ].

Household devices are likely to be networked into a home hub.  Since
home devices mainly respond to programming and report problems,
there is little from the outside network that they need.  A multi-home
complex will probably have a single shared hub.

Hubs are likely to be networked into a regional center.  Data will more
or less be "bursty" -- assuming human communications gets swallowed
up in the huge data pipe available -- so data pipes will be concentrated
in a regional center.  This center may be per city, or per world region,
and will include orbital stations.

These information centers will most likely be peers, and resemble
the libraries (or video stores, or pay-per-view services, or e-commerce
storefronts) of earlier tech levels.  If a world has a "wide" data pipe
and an open regulatory atmosphere, then applications may be run
remotely on a subscriber basis; on more restrictive worlds (tech or
government) applications may be physically stored on the user\'s site.


Well, those are my ramblings for now.

Yeah, I don\'t see this as evidence either way about the kid(s).  Young
children growing up in hazardous situations can and do learn what *not* to

reasons.

Interesting possibility:  S/he damaged the boat, too.  See below.

Probably the latter; you couldn\'t fit even a notable fraction of 100+ dt
of cargo onto a credibly-sized third boat.

I like this...and assume that the boat as well as the door were damaged
during the departure.  You\'d have an inexperienced pilot taking a damaged
boat down for the landing, not a happy situation...

They needn\'t be outside the Imperium, or on an uninhabited world. 
Consider that if we posit they are of a minor human race from outside the
Imperium (or far away within it), the \'plague\' may be some common virus or
microbe that infects the mix of humaniti found in the Marches without
causing more than a case of the sniffles.  So presume they were somewhere
near Victoria, bound for that interdicted world for some (of necessity) 
nefarious purpose.  They pick up the plague, and most of the drama occurs
during the jump to Victoria.  The survivors abandon ship as you describe,
and take the damaged boat down to the surface -- which is further damaged
by the atmospheric entry and landing, sufficiently to prevent it from
flying again.  Let\'s assume they *don\'t* develop the plague, or at least
don\'t die from it; these may be the ones with natural immunity.

Just before abandoning ship, the pilot sends the Nova off on a semi-random
walk away from Victoria so as not to call attention to their crime(s).

Now they are stranded on Victoria, where they are not supposed to be, with
a poisonous atmosphere other than on the mesas, and most of the mesas
occupied by likely very suspicious locals.  They sure could use rescuing.
Maybe with the right hints from the GM, some players could work this out.
And get these folks back to the Nova.  And join in on whatever scheme they
had in progress.

Hm.

#2 is pretty much how I see the Third Imperium.

However, since members of the Moot are not elected by the people,
it\'s probably not a true representative democracy.  Anyone have a
dictionary handy?  Nothing deflates an argument like having to
define your terms.

I see no "real" problem to having a Traveller Universe with #1.
It just wouldn\'t be exactly like what\'s published, but it\'s still
more-or-less compatible.

Well, if in the end they\'re elected democratically it\'s a representative or parliamentary democracy (aka a republic).  Otherwise it\'s something else which I\'m not certain has a name, since it implies a union of lesser states with significantly inconsistent rules.

www.dictionary.com:).  The Empire is not a democracy.  If you assumed the Moot made the decisions it would probably be considered a parliamentary federation.  As it is, it\'s really closest to a feudal government.

I guess the campaigns I\'ve played in have never been very canonical. Most of
them seem to have had a period when at least some of the players went on
grand quests to get both battledress and FGMP\'s so they could be major
bad-**ses.  They never seemed to be under the impression that BD was
vulnerable to small arms, they always worried about the other guy with
FGMP\'s. Of course it always seemed that the GM made it very difficult for
our heroes to get such equipment, and that as soon as they did the
opposition seemed to all have it too. I don\'t really remember a case of a
NPC taking out a PC in BD with small arms. Funny I guess it only works the
other way around.

And we are also supposed to know that, since the game is published in the
US, that the measurements used are in fact "American" not "Imperial", in
spite of what the book says.

No problem up here in the Great White, of course, Not only are we used to
converting measurements (even if we dislike it), but we\'re also used to
translating American political statements. A lower tax is an "unfair
subsidy" if Canadian, a "good business practice" if American.

<bitch>
I\'m referring, of course, to the "Shakes and Shingles" affair. That summer,
the Free Trade Commission ruled that lower Canadian stumpage taxes were an
unfair subsidy of our lumber industry, and slapped a countervail on
Canadian lumber products. They also ruled that lower fuel taxes and dock
fees in Maine were just good business practices, and not an unfair subsidy
of American fishermen.

Yes, I\'m still kinda bitter about it. My brother lost his company because
lumber lobby groups in Washington state couldn\'t compete, even when Jon\'s
_total_ tax bill was higher than their\'s (our payroll taxes are higher and
US ones), and so they manipulated the FTC. It wouldn\'t have been so bad,
except that on the opposite coast the same commission ruled the other way
on what was virtually the same case.
</bitch>

All of which could be translated into Traveller terms, of course, but I\'m
too busy to do so. Especially as I want to get GT Shipyard handling
habitats and starports, so that I can release v.5 of 101 Starships (with
starports!) when GT Starports is published.

p.42: Volume is normally weight/50 cf, except more like weight/20 cf if it
is concealed inside the vehicle.  This is very logically in the chapter
with preedesigned weapons, rather than in the chapter where you actually
design the weapons. My worst complaint about VE2 is the way that keeps
happening.

p.126: in the weight formula, factor L is 0.5 if compact, 1 otherwise.

p.127: in the cost formula, the "Options" part says to quadruple the cost
of a compact beam weapon.

This is, of course, incorrect.

GURPS Traveller uses _Imperial_ measurements, which means that you must use
Imperial gallons, not American gallons.

This is a disadvantage for Americans, forcing them to convert measurements
that only _seem_ familiar. On the bright side, it means that Traveller
players are entitled to larger pints of Scouts Brew at any SJG-sponsored
event :-)

In response to your specifications for the BRS VIP lifeboat:

We don\'t quite have a ready-to-build design yet, but we have a draft
design for a 20 dton craft that can carry three sophonts (two
crewminions hot-bunking, and an overlord in a small stateroom) at 2G
acceleration, with standard conveniences (armored hull, automated
point-defense laser, sandcasters, etc.) for MCr 105.18.  We expect to
have a completed proposal ready within the next two to three days.

Our design bureau team members suspect that your draft forgot to include
the MCr 50 13.5 sensitivity PEMS (range: 16 mkm).  After all, when
overlords abandon ship, it\'s usually due to some ungrateful
insurrectionist swine attacking their majesties\' vessels.  It wouldn\'t
do to lose track of said rebel scum, simply because some bean-counter
vetoed the best possible sensor suite.

	I believe it\'s actually to reduce the error rate. My copy of the
Space Data Handbook presents error rates in terms of normalized S/N
ratio lambda, which is energy per bit / noise spectral density, and
I\'m not qualified to convert back & forth ... however, for reference,
the chart for coherent PSK shows that at 0dB, the error rate is one
bit in ten; at 10dB, the rate is one in 10^5.

Not that I know *anything* about comms, but I thought that line noise was
the very thing Mandelbrot was studying at IBM\'s pure research labs? He
found that even on the quietest line they could achieve, unexplained line
noise occurred. The random nature of the noise is what led him into chaos
theory.

	Ah! Should have just read a few more pages. Converting to normalized
SNR (Eb/N0) from S/N should be

	Eb/N0 = T [ C / N0 ]

where

	C/N0 = B C/N

C = Carrier power
B = IF bandwidth
T = bit duration in sec = 1 / data rate

So let\'s take the S/N from above as C/N. Expressed in dB, that\'s
64dB. Bandwidth at audio frequencies on the phone is about 4000hz.
Bit duration n seconds is 1/28,800, or 3.5 x 10^-5. So, Eb/N0 works
out around 8.8dB. Binary coherent PSK, 9dB gives a bit error rate of
6x10-4. On average, one bit in about 2000 winds up incorrectly
received. Fortunately, we\'ve all got error correcting modems ...

Disclaimers: I\'m not an information theory weenie. I\'m using TRW\'s
"Space Data" handbook for back of the envelope calculations, and may
have made a few mistakes. Specifically,

	- The maximum baud rate for telephone lines is around 2400. To get
28.8k BITS per second (not BAUD--there *is* a difference), you need
to use higher than binary PSK ... and I know higher speed modems DO
use greater signalling density.
	- I\'m not completely convinced that Carrier/Noise is the same as
Signal/Noise ...

So it isn\'t metric. What\'s the big deal? Playing GURPS up here where
we use the metric system, we just convert the GURPS measurements into
metric. The most-often used measure in GURPS is the game hex -- one
yard. We use "one metre". We also just use "tonne" (ie, 1000 kg) for
"ton" (2000 lbs), and divide "pounds" by 2 to get kilograms. Not an
exact conversion, but close enough for gaming purposes. And we\'ve 
been doing it for over 10 years now.

BTW, I have no problem with the GURPS skill system. Degrees of
difficulty can be simulated by imposing roll modifiers...

Personally, were it not for GURPS Traveller, I doubt I\'d be playing
Traveller now... Traveller would have just been one more in the long
list of games I\'ve played and enjoyed but no longer play...

"Slowly" is an understatement. It takes over a year to get from Regina to
Capital (39 Jump-4 Jumps, if you can go in a strait line, which you can\'t).
A federal state, with each Domain acting as a state might work. Each
subsector sends a representative to a sector legislature, which in turn
sends a representative to a Domain wide congress, each of which sends a
senator to the Moot.

I don\'t really expect it would work. The elected representative on Capital
would be so far removed from the "folks back home" that your typical
American Senator, who often has lived in D.C. for the past decade and a half
would seem like a hometown boy.

I would expect that the 3I government would become even more fragmented.
Civil war would be even more likely, eventually.

Going farther afield let\'s look at the other cultures around the Imperium.
None of them are democracies, or even republics. The Solomani Confederation
is much smaller than the 3I and heavily fractionalized. The Aslan have no
true central government. The Zho\'s follow the Imperial Pattern, with a
Nobility and local control by that Nobility. The Vargr ... need I say more?

I guess I\'m clueless. My well thumbed GURPS Basic book list a gazillion
skills relating to tasks with the classifications (mental/hard) or
(physical/easy) with a default to indicate what Joe Genero has to roll to
accomplish a task using that skill. I always thought that was a "task

Canonically we know that a BG can be used to build a jump charge. Does that
mean that a ship with a black globe could be built with no fuel tanks at
all? Just get close enough to the system sun to charge the Jump capacitors
and jump. Or is the distance from the star that will produce the necessary
power too far inside the star\'s 100 diameter limit?

I\'ve got to say I really don\'t understand SJG\'s reluctance to publishing
dual unit rules. I mean their stuff is translated into other languages and
use metric (see GURPS Basic p 8) in those languages so somebody\'s already
worked out the conversions. Generally I use American units to work out any
design\'s and then convert to metric for player use. I generally fudge it so
yards are meters on hex ship layouts and maps, mass lbs to kilo\'s etc. The
hardest part is vehicle performance which I generally feel has to be closer.

Many of these "decade and a half" senators still get elected as a result of
campaigns that convince the voters in their state that they are, in fact,
"hometown boys." To take it a step further, voters are sometimes convinced
that senators from OTHER states are in fact "hometown boys."

As a result, I would think that the hometown factor you\'re referring to
isn\'t as important as it looks. Further, we know that the art of advertising
has transformed into the science of psychohistory.

>I would expect that the 3I government would become even more fragmented.


Possibly, but you haven\'t really made a convincing argument.

We already know that it happened with the Third Imperium\'s noble system, so
what\'s the difference, really?

Sure. Sounds good to me.

They were also on the losing end of a war in which they lost their central
rallying point. The government is also presented as one that would make the
U.S.S.R. during the Stalinist regime look like a paradise.

Those crazy anarchist Aslan. Gives the A in a circle a whole new meaning? ;)

Sort of, but not exactly, considering the fact that their government has
integrated psionics to the extent that... well... democracy would likely be
impossible.

>The Vargr ... need I say more?


Yes. You do need to say more! The Vargr, from where I stand, seem to
practice the truest and most primal form of democracy... a democracy of
charisma.

Why not? Are you a speciesist? ;)

The boats were fairly standard design CT ship\'s boats, IIRC.  They had 6G 
capability.  Only the total displacement of the Annic Nova whilst being 
pushed by the boats cut the accelleration down to the .1/.2G that they could 
move the ship at.  I don\'t see a bigger boat, at the 6G accel limit of CT, as 
being able to move it any faster, but still, it\'s an interesting idea.  Or, 
it could have been a humongous pod with a manuvering drive sufficient to move 
the entire ship at 1G or so, plus a reactor and enough controls to allow it 
to be controlled from the ship\'s bridge like the ship\'s boats are.  If 
somebody screwed up during a manuver and the pod seperated from the ship, it 
could have taken off for \'Never Nervous Land\' at a speed too great for a 
ship\'s boat to catch it.  And that could account for the damage at the 
midship docking port.

I could see this happening, especially if the computer\'s program was

experience in that area, I can categorically tell you that you *really* don\'t 
wanna make any plans under those circumstances.  And you *don\'t* wanna try

If they were minor humans from the Spinward Marches with technological 
competance, they would have been discovered before now.  They\'ve *got* to be 
extra-Imperial in origin or they\'d show up in the stock CT \'library program\' 
that you can pick up at most any starport in the Marches.  Also, since the 
Imperium has been around the Marches for about 700 years in M:1100, they 
would probably have been assimulated into Imperial culture by then, thus 
speaking Anglic.

Well how about this. Simply take 2 off. In addition to losing this problem,
the bell curve (WARNING Non social scientist/economics person talking) pops
down a couple of notches toward the lower classes where most of us reside. 

Thus the following ensues

SOC	EXAMPLES
0-1	Very Low Class (Street Peoples, people who lose welfare)
2-3	Lower Class (Welfare, Menial labour types, depressed minorities)
4-6	Lower Middle Class (most blue & white collar workers, military
enlisted personnel, me, majority of population)
7-8	Middle Class (Middle management, military field officers)
9	Upper Middle Class (executives, senior officers, regional
politicians etc.)
A	Upper Class (very senior military officers, federal politicians,
senior corporate execs, local nobility)

Of course this doesn\'t reflect the fact that the more technologically
advanced a world or nation is, the more the bell curve nudges up the social
scale. 

Also, when people do advance to nobility, to get over the Soc C; \'am I a
baronet or a baron\' hurdle, those whose initial Soc is 9- are baronets,
those with a Soc of A are Barons. 

Also IMTU you have to go through the noble career to get to Soc D+

They seem to be fairly high tech.  They *might* have access to cloning

*Sort of* related to this is the following:

- - "15mm scale" miniatures (traditional Traveller scale) uses  0.5
  inch square grid

- - "25mm scale" miniatures (TNE scale) uses 1 inch square grid

It seems to be industry wide and has caught a  number  of  people
out.  (Including GW when they used to make Traveller items  under
licence.)

And if anyone\'s interested the newly published _The Khiidkar Incident_ is

though that I\'m not familiar enough with the play to spot just where.

	I have never considered this to be a problem.  For me, Soc
	is an indicator of class in the same way that Edu is an 
	indicator of education: less about formal certification
	than about the general ability of the individual.  High Edu
	does not mean graduate degrees, post-docs, etc.  Rather it
	means a lot of general knowledge about the world, the 
	ability to converse knowledgably about a wide range of 
	topics.  High Soc indicates a sophont who dresses and speaks
	well, and can generally blend in at a high-class ball.
	Such a sophont would only have a title if they had followed 
	the "Noble" career in COTI.  All IMTU, of course.  As always,
	YMMV.

Hmm... I ran into this in about 1979 and started using a simple rule of
thumb: character initial social standing applies only to home world and is
normalized (in both directions) when off world.  For instance, your family
may be extremely well connected in the civil service bureaucracy where you
grew up, but who would know that in the Imperial Navy?  Or care?  Same thing
with extremely low SS; who would know your family were serfs on some
backwater planet once you are ninety parsecs away on a Scout tour?

For instance, Barry Bigwig has an initial SS of B on his homeworld of
Backwater.  He joins the marines and is sent off to the FFW.  His education
and demeanor make him good officer material, but the only ones calling him
sir are the enlisteds.  His effective SS is about 9.  Perhaps if he were
from Regina his connections would be better and his effective SS would be A.

I have also used the expanded nobility listing written by Charles Ahner and
published in the first issue of Adventure Gaming.

Not so. In all my calculations on the subject I\'ve included a jump drive on
the ship itself. It\'s true that if you assume that you can make do with the
capacitor part of the jump drive alone (having a jump drive sitting around
on a space station to provide the calculations), you can get even better
results, but it\'s the lack of internal tankage that\'s really important.

And Keven R. Pittsinger writes:

The energy storage devices on the Annic Nova accumulates solar energy over a
period of 1-6 weeks. Once they have accumulated enough energy the ship can
jump. If they are not jump drive style capacitors, they are something even
better. Annic Nova dosen\'t need any fuel tanks. That puts her one up on
every other known ship in Charted Space.

The original handwave explanation of why a ship needed 10 to 60% of its
space taken up with fuel tanks was that jump capacitors had to be filled
so fast that you couldn\'t use a normal power plant to fill them.
Introduce a capacitor capable of slowly building up a charge over a week
and you most certainly do break canon. (Unless the jump fule is actually
used for... no, let\'s not go there ;-)

It\'s true, as someone pointed out, that nothing says these capacitors are
capable of accepting energy _faster_ than minimum one week, and I suppose
that would do for a handwave to reduce their impact  --  claim that they
cannot be charged in less than a week. But you\'d still be able to do better
with Annic Nova type merchant ships than with standard Traveller Canon ships.

In light of the discussion that ensued, I\'m amending my theory to
include the possibility that the survivors were a mixture of adolescents
and children.

1. A teen-ager\'s bed, especially on a starship, would probably be
indistinguishable by size from adult beds. Thus the four "children\'s
beds" found would have been for youger children. The culture gap
may make it difficult, at least initially, for the adventurers to distinguish
between the personal effects appropriate to a teen-ager and those
appropriate to an adult (says the man with a matchbox Lost In Space
Jupiter II on his desk at work), thus the only division visible was
"Adult vs Child", not "Adult-Teenager-Child".

2. It is possible that the majority of the adults were in the landing
party that contracted the plague.

3. The remaining adults may have been involved in caring for the stricken,
or sterilizing the sickroom, and thus were prime candidates for exposure.

Thus the damaged "third ship" dock and the misprogrammed computer
would be explained through youthful inexperience, rather than fever
or panic. We also have a stranded bunch of kids who have been on
their own (if still alive) for years on a hostile planet somewhere, possibly
increasing the motivation to mount a search and rescue mission.

My take is that an initial SOC  roll  of  B  or  C  indicates  an
inherited  position,  whereas  SOC   bonuses   during   character
generation indicate rewards and/or renown for achievements.

For achieved social status this  does  not  confir  an  automatic
title ... that  is a GM decision and is influenced by medels won.

For inhertied position I use a modified version of the  En Guarde
character generation tables to decide the actual noble rank.  The
Traveller SOC  rating  for  each  title  is  merely  the  default
starting position.  Where a genuine title exists (as  opposed  to
being "the son of") the only career permissible is "Noble".

Note that character generation creates  PCs  ...  which  are  not
necessarily representative of the overall  population  (who  have
steady jobs, a wife, and 2.4 children).  One  day  I\'m  going  to
finish off my Traveller/En Guarde variant.

Now funnily enough, I\'ve been thinking about putting an adventure together
that would involve a similarly marooned bunch of teenagers - but several
(say, three?) generations on.  No, this isn\'t aimed at being as dark as
_Lord of the Flies_ but I\'d be interested to know what folk thought about:

a) the idea: is it \'overused\'?

b) How many kids would have to be involved to get a reasonable gene pool.
I\'d been imagining around 20 or so in the original population.

c) Does anyone know how easy ways to work out how many would be in the
population after, say, X generations given a percentage infant mortality
rate (which would be high given they have little skill and no equipment)

d) Or to turn c) around, how to work out how many generations would pass
before you had, say, Y number of people.

The recharge time would not be a big problem on long world adventures, but

     understanding of it\'s combat system, which I hate, is limited).

Traveller: The New Era
I don\'t have the basic rules for this game, so can\'t make an
evaluation. However, the TL12 4.7cm fusion gun cannot penetrate
the TL12 heavy battle dress in the RC equipment guide. The TL14
fusion gun has better penetration, but I have no idea of the armor
value of TL14 battle dress.

GURPS Traveller
Numbers: TL11 FGMP does 525 points damage average, TL11 battle dress
     has DR 240 (doubled vs energy attacks).
Evaluation: At 50 meters, a hit is very likely. On average, 45 points
     of damage will get through, forcing 6 death rolls for an
     average person.

In Summary
     GT battle dress seems to be reasonable close to the CT version with 
respect to FGMP/PGMPs, and the MT version for other weapons. FYI, the 6mm 
assault rifle in CT is -6 to-hit someone in battle dress at 50 meters (-2 if 
autofired), a little bit better than the chance to
penetrate the armor in GT (nil without a critical hit, but about the same in 
MT). This change may not keep the "feel" of CT, but is makes more 
"real-world" sense. Also, a LAG with DS, which has a good chance to hurt 
someone in BD in CT, has virtually no chance of doing so in GT (the odds are 
a bit better against TL 10 than TL 11 BD, but still pretty low).

There\'s a certain amount of organisation to be decided upon even at this
stage. For instance, the character generation ruleset (CT, GURPS, etc)
doesn\'t usually appear on a character sheet, because it determine which
character sheet to use! Campaign details (Milieu, general location, etc)
are also important to a character but not generally on the sheet.

So, you should probably decide what needs to go where. If there\'s
separate sections for "Rules" and "Campaign Setting" this info can be
skipped from individual characters. Or you could make it hierarchical,
with Campaign at the top and the others coming off that (probably my
choice).

Actually, everything I typed was completely irrelevant because I forgot one 
important fact -- in CT and MT, battle dress offers the same protection as 
combat armor. This is clearly not true in GT. Also, battle dress in CT 
weighs about 45 lbs (20 kg) -- it\'s about 1/5th the weight of the GT 
version.

So ... rename GT battle dress as light battlesuits. For true GT battle 
dress, use the description as given, except that the armor\'s PD and DR is 
the same as combat armor of the same TL. Weight is 3x that of combat armor 
of the same TL. Note that in CT, combat armor weighs only 13 lbs (6 kg) at 
TL 14 (GT TL 12) and 40 lbs (18 kg) when introduced (TL9 for both games, I 
think).

Personally, I would use the weights and costs from CT/MT for pretry much 
everything, but that\'s just me ...

Personally, GT should have used metric as well, to keep the same scientific 
feel as the other Traveller versions (OTOH, I would never use metric in a 
non-modern fantasy game, since it would have the wrong feel as well).

Here are some more exact shortcuts:

yards to meters: subtract 10%
pounds to kilograms: subtract 10%, then divide by two

I think you misunderstood me.  I agree that their *origin* has to be
outside the Imperium, or just barely possibly in a true backwater within
it -- but odds are heavily in favor of the outside origin.  What I wrote
above is that the castaways we\'re all arguing into existence are likely
*inside* the Imperium, and not necessarily on an uninhabited world;
specifically, I\'m arguing that they are stranded on Victoria.

However, I did blow something else; my "doesn\'t bother March-folk" point
is shot down by the fact that PCs (presumably mostly Marchers themselves)
can succumb to it.  Dang.

If the idea was to get rid of the ship, why not just send it into a star?
Certainly much, *much* more likely to solve the plague problem.  To do
what they did, they either have to (a) be so feverish they couldn\'t think
that straight -- which makes a piloted evacuation seem rather farfetched,
or (b) have some reason to want the ship intact for them to recover
if/when they get past the plague plus stranded on an interdicted world
problems.  I\'d tend to just send it out into the cometary halo to sit
quietly and peep every week or so on some out-of-the-way radio band, but
doing that part differently (and perhaps botching the autonav coding) I
can buy as the sort of mistake a moderately but not critically ill person
might make.

This is not a complete task system.  The ratings given (easy, average,
hard, very hard) rate the skills relative to each other.  What is
missing is rating tasks to the skill system.  For example, the following
tasks use electrical technician skill and require specifying components
as needed:

1) replacing a car battery
2) wiring a light fixture
3) wiring a house
4) wiring an office building
5) wiring a manufacturing plant
6) wiring a city-wide electrical distribution system

now how do you adjust the standard task roll for each of these tasks???

What is lacking from the task system is some guidelines as to how to
adjust the standard roll.  CT also suffers from this problem (until DGP
put out thier task system)

There\'s always Mick Bailey\'s TravTools package, whihc is what I used to use, 
before I blew away my Win9x partition.  I copped it at 
http://www.iinet.net.au/~mickb/Traveller/software.html.

You are obviously using the BD from GT. First In gives Scout BD at an even
lower value DR 60. The issue is the GTL-12 Imperial Marine Commando Battle
Dress from GT:Star Mercs p61, with DR 1200, which will basically ignore FGMP
fire.

That\'s the *point*.  <grin>  It\'s a good way to keep them local for a bit to really get the *feel* for the local worlds instead of just seeing what\'s inside the local extraterritorial wire.

Evil idea, isn\'t it?

Awful lotta inbreeding would happen at that level.  Course, if the

genes within a couple generations or so, if they didn\'t retain their

You\'d need life expectancy rates, age of fertility, # of births per year per 
person, % of chance for the woman to die in childbirth, etc.  For a low 
population, say, 20-30ish, it\'d be easy to do it by hand.

Got me.  I can\'t remember *any* of the statistics I squeaked through at college 25 years ago.

Actually, I don\'t think Dulinor wanted *democracy*, although he have
supported some "reforms" that could have been called democratic.
What I think he really wanted was the central government to take a
much more active role in the rule of the various systems.  I saw
him, and his faction, as insipent despots.  Events of the rebellion
didn\'t change my view of his faction.

...and self-interest.

I was never interested in the Rebellion, it self.  A post Rebellion
era with a fractured Imperium is interesting.  Thing is something
would have to prevent the surrounding powers from expanding into the
vacuum left as Imperial power declined.  We know what *that* turned
out to be.  <g>

I\'ve been wondering if this is too severe or not enough... or if it should

<MT Task System>
Maybe -2 DM for two low recoil guns, -4 DM for two med recoil guns and -8

Waitasec here.  You\'re talking about leaving the jump drives *themselves* 
behind during a jump???  The drive itself doesn\'t \'do\' the calculations.  The 
ship\'s *computer* does, per the CT/HG rules (and every *other* set of rules 
I\'ve seen so far as well, AAMOF).  It controls the jump drives, which open 
the hole into jumpspace to drop the ship into.  No jump drive, no jump.  
Otherwise, they could just send those big bricks (\'battle riders\') through 
jumpspace without bothering to have to build a tender for them.

Now, FF&S1 *does* talk about \'keyhole drives\', which is jump without jump 
drives, but that\'s *alternate* technology, not mainline technology.

She still needs fuel to *manuver*.

Again, the device being charged was *not* specified as being the capacitors.  
My take on it was that the capacitors are part of the drives themselves, 
which *are* accounted for in the design.  A high tech \'accumulator\' that 
stores the solar energy is seperate from the jump drives.  This space is 
*also* allocated in the design.  Now, under CT rules, that 10% volume per 
jump number is the amount of fuel required to provide the *energy* for a 
jump.  It was further explained that *part* of the drive was a fast-burning 
high energy fusion reactor that needed constant attention during the burn.  
The design was handwaved that it was not *practical* to use it as a regular 
power plant for normal useage because it would burn up or something.  That I 
could live with.  Let\'s face it, you *don\'t* need knowledge of tensor 
analysis or quantum physics to turn on a light switch.  <grin>  Assuming that 
it\'s *energy* which needs to be fed to the jump drives, and a *lot* of it to 
boot, then Annic Nova doesn\'t break canon.  It stores up energy over a period 
of 1 to 6 weeks, then bleeds it into the jump drive over a standard ship 
combat turn (1000 seconds, a bit over 20 minutes) to power the jump.

We\'re talking about a *LOT* of energy being stored here.  Those accumulators 
were *big*.  But still, they were beyond the state of the art technology of 
the 3I for energy density capacity.

BTW, although I owned the original supplement at one time (and just recently 
picked up a xerox copy of it again), I took one look at it, said to myself, 
"How do you fix the damned thing if the battery breaks?", and promptly filed 
it.

<< What are your thoughts? >>

Well, for starters, you are going to lose your natural site plane (front site 
to rear site to eyeball) since you can only line up one weapon at a time to 
your dominant shooting eye. You will have to either hip shoot (shoot from the 
hip) or point shoot (treat the weapon as an extension of your shooting hands 
pointed index finger. I find this a VERY difficult way to aim a handgun 
although experts are VERY good at it) when you use two weapons at a time. 
Either method is less accurate than site shooting in my opinion. You also 
have less control with a handgun with one hand (especially your non dominant 
hand) than with two.

I tried this experiment using my service revolver (a 1 kg, 102 mm barrel S+W 
model 10-see Americans can use metric...:-) ) in my strong hand, and my off 
duty revolver (much smaller) in my weak hand. I had a LOT of trouble with my 
weak hand hitting the center of mass part of the target at 14 meters, 
especially as my off duty weapon only had a 51 mm barrel which really affects 
accuracy. My strong hand was much better, though still very inferior to 
firing either weapon two handed... I concluded that I should only use my weak 
hand in emergencies.

As for your method of kicking up the difficulty level one notch; this seems 
reasonable, and you should remember that if he/she runs both weapons empty, 
they can only reload one at a time, so they either have to drop a weapon, or 
do the really awkward "tuck a weapon under your armpit or in your belt" 
method while you reload the other weapon. Of course, if I emptied two weapons 
at the bad guys and they\'re still on their feet, I\'m running the other way 
FAST...:-)

Probably not severe enough.  After all, there are at least five problems
with firing two handguns at once:

1.  Recoil.  I would expect most medium-to-large caliber handguns to be
designed for two-handed use, to allow for manageable recovery from the
recoil.

2.  Aiming.  Since most handguns are aimed by sighting down the weapon,
a person firing two handguns can\'t really aim either with any accuracy.

3.  Misfires.  If one weapon misfires or jams, a person firing two
handguns has no hands free to clear the weapon.

4.  Reloading.  When the weapons run out of ammo (and the type of player
who would want to use two handguns at once is probably of the "blaze
away" school of marksmanship), reloading will take more than twice the
time of loading one weapon of that type, since the firer will have to
set a weapon down to free up a hand, then waste time picking it back up,
then pick up the first weapon again.

5.  Keeping track of ammo.  It is difficult but doable to keep track of
the remaining ammo in _one_ weapon.  I can\'t see a firer being able to
keep track of remaining ammo in two weapons, under the stress of a
firefight.  Thus, rather than anticipating one\'s last shot before
reloading (and thus being ready to begin reloading), the firer likely
will not know that his/her/its weapon has run dry until he/she/it hears
that awful "click" on an empty chamber, or sees the slide lock back
after the last shot in the magazine.

Bottom line:  The player would be better served by having
extra-high-capacity magazines custom manufactured for an automatic
pistol, thus giving a reasonable chance to hit with one pistol, rather
than waste time firing two pistols, with little chance to hit with
either pistol.

I had this same situation, and applied the same modifier you did. In

True, very true. However, in the MT system, which is what I think the
original poster is using, there is no distinction between T4\'s \'aimed
fire\' and \'snap fire\'. It\'s all the same, unless you include the
\'bracing\' modifier.

To get the degress of realism you mention would involve a radical change
to the MT combat system. That may be desirable, but I think that\'s more
than the original poster wanted.

Here\'s what I do...AKUS players listen up...

1.  The To Hit task for the weapon in the dominate hand (right hand
unless you tell me different) is one level harder.

2.  The To Hit task for the weapon in the off-hand is two levels
harder.

...and I suspect it *should* be 2 and 3 levels harder. 

The only place this sort of thing would be useful is a shoot out in
a closed room where the object is to put a lot of lead in the air
fast and hope something hits the other guy before something hits
you. Not much skill in something like that.

BTW, weapons\' experts...what\'s with this sidearm pistol shooting
that seems to be so popular on TV/movies these days?  Is there *any*
advantage that you can see to it?

I\'m not a weapons expert, but here are the advantages that I could come up with anyway:

1. Ratings - movies tend to sell more when they have unrealistic & outrageous action
2. Showing off - If you actually hit something like that you look pretty good, even if it is only luck.
3. Wannabees - Wannabees get to pretend they are their favorite action hero.
4. Intimidation - people might be more frighten by someone firing two weapons instead of one.

5. Group hits - in densely peopled areas a pair of sawed off shotguns
maximize casualties in a short period.
6. Balance - a Colt 45 on each hip, highly recommended by chiropractors.

When it comes to guns, etc, I have no idea. I prefer FFS1 partly

TNE\'s FGMP-14 does 33D6 Damage, with a Pen of 1 (lose one die per point 
of armour). A TL-14 Suit of Heavy Battledress is AV 16 (the Light 
Battledress is AV8). Thus at 50m (well within Short Range) the FGMP-14 
will do 17D6 + 16 (blunt trauma) to the target, and will hit about 50% 
with a reasonably skilled firer. This is enough damage to critically 
wound almost anybody, and will certainly knock them over, etc etc.

In TNE a LAG DS round will penetrate AV6, so it won\'t penetrate TL-14 
HBD, but it will do 6 points in blunt trauma, which will probably knock 
the HBD wearer off his feet, forcing a panic check. The HEAP rounds 
won\'t penetrate either, but they do a bit more impact damage. There is 
no assault rifle in TNE that will go through HBD (or even the light 
stuff), but the 7mm ACR does enough blunt trauma to knock the clumsier 
wearers over. So in TNE battledress does stop bullets, but low tech 
opponents can still knock you down, pin you and then nickel and dime 
you to death.

I hav heard one possible explanation.

Supposedly if you put the ejection port facing down you\'re less likely to be
hit by the brass, and if you\'re interested in gathering it up again
afterwards, it won\'t fly as far or as erratically if it\'s directed straight
down

Lets be clear about this.  This is true if "complete" means "not just
like MT".  Otherwise, one could say that MT doesn\'t have a "proper"
task system because it, for example, doesn\'t have a way of
rating how some skills are harder than others.

The fact is that people have made such rating systems.  They
are fairly trivial.  I\'ve had one for years and it hasn\'t attracted
much attention because it just isn\'t a big deal.  Such things
can be convenient for new GM\'s, but to say the lack of one means
you don\'t have a task system (or a "proper" task system) is
just hooey.

Firing two guns at once means that you are trying
to do twice as much per round.  MT has a very clear
rule for this.  This is a hasty task and is +1
difficulty.  This should be the _minimum_ increase
for all such tasks.

If the two guns are fired at separate
targets an additional +1 difficulty 
because they can\'t focus their eyes on
both targets.

If the two targets are more than about 60
degrees of angle apart yet another +1 
difficulty mod.

The use of an additional penalty, possibly a
further +1 diff mod of the off hand is probably
also logical.

I do not shoot so you may want to
cross check this w/ someone with
small arms experience but in the
interests of a nice simple system how 
about the following:

Simply apply the appropriate
recoil penalty for the next highest class

2 low recoil = medium recoil

2 medium recoil 
or 1 medium + 1 low = heavy recoil

1 heavy recoil + 1 low recoil =
use heavy recoil + medium recoil penalties

1 heavy recoil + 1 medium
or 2 heavy recoil =

Simple. With the avialable thrust, that\'d take a long time. And even a

Which are you talking about?  The two guns / two hands approach, or the tilt
the gun over to the side gangster style as another poster suggested?

If #1, I can\'t really see it, no matter what.  You\'d have to be very strong
(especially with larger calibers), and OUTSTANDING point shot, and you\'d be
FUBAR when you had to reload or to clean a jam.  You\'d have to re-holster or
set down one of the weapons, at which point you\'d loose any advantage in the
spray-n-pray department.  I\'m a reasonably talented marksman in pistol,
rifle (semi-auto), shotgun, SMG (thanks Mark!), true assault rifle (as in
full auto, again thanks Mark & wife [oops!  forgot name!  DOH!], main battle
rifle (.308, yet again, thanks Mark!), and GPMG (guess what, THANKS MARK!!!!
:)  Both in bech shooting and in tactical shooting.  In the last year I\'ve
probably put a total of 2,000 rounds through my semi AR-15, 5,000 through my
HK USP .45, and about 1,000 through the various full auto\'s mentioned
(mostly 9mm & .223).  I would much rather use a main weapon with a backup
than to try and use two of anything at one time.  I\'m talking long arm, SMG,
shotgun, or HE weapon :) with holstered pistol should the long gun go FUBAR.
Do I think Lara Croft or the poster\'s player can reasonably use two weapons?
Yeah, right.  Beyond contact or close range, no way.

If #2, ala ganster style, don\'t make me laugh :)  As best can be determined,
some producer or director probably saw a US Marine Corp pistol champion
(whose name escapes me at the moment) who was cross eye dominant shoot.  He
was right handed, but left eye dominant.  In the classic one handed stance,
if he tilted the gun 45 degrees to the left, the sights line up perfectly.
I\'ve actually used this method when I lost a contact lense once, and it can
work, though for normal two handed shooting it was more comfortable to just
laterally shift my hands a couple of inches.  Anyway, some Hollywood type
probably saw this Marine punching single holes with multiple rounds, and
copied the move into a film.  It then gets copied in more films, and pretty
soon you see video surveilance footage on "America\'s Scariest Police Videos"
(thank you Fox >:P  ) of gangster punks holding up liquor stores this way.

Either way, your looking at purely a stylistic, artistic license thing.
Gee, that\'s never happened in Hollywood before :D

Actually, I was thinking of an almost Edenic environment (at least in the
locality of the original colony) as I would have thought 20 odd teenagers
would pretty much need that to survive.  (I\'m basically imagining they have
no experience of living outside their usual technological lifestyles; and
very little tools and technology to hand anyway - they\'re weren\'t supposed
to be or expecting to be here: misjump, adult supervisors dead, no chance
of rescue.)

I would guess that anything *but* an ideal garden type environment would be
pretty lethal under those conditions.  Particulary for what is essentially
an unorganized bunch of school children.  What I was interested in was what
kind of society might have developed after a few generations.

Something I didn\'t mention was that the original population would be
deaf/mutes communicating with sign language.  Presumably their descendents
would be physically able to speak but would still only communicate by sign.
I\'m guessing it would be more than a few generations before speech might
emerge again independently as it were.

Well, I did start on doing that with a giant \'family tree\' but I did wonder
about generalizing it so I could fiddle with the variables more!

Likewise.  (Though in my case the RAM failure is sooner at just 15 years.)

Yes, this was one of my favourite books in my youth  I just loved it so it
may have been in the back of my mind.  (I haven\'t read it for a while, but
would probably enjoy it just as much now).  What *was* the name of the

        I\'m by no means an expert (qualified marksman on rifle, sharpshooter
on pistol), but I assume you\'re talking about the current TV and movie
trend of holding the pistol sideways which I completely fail to understand.
However, the one-hand extended "profile" (or Old West) position was
always my prefered method of firing for a combination of two reasons;
1) my hands are large enough and wrist strong enough to handle even
a .45 one-handed and 2) my belly is large enough to make the normal
2-handed FBI or combat crouch position uncomfortable.  Basically,
as long as you have the strength/hand-size to control your weapon,
the best firing position is whatever one you are most comfortable in
or with.  The minor superiority that the FBI position gives is only
significant to a truly expert shooter, one who is aiming for the "ten-
ring" rather than center of mass of a silhouette-shaped target.

During the Falklands (or Malvinas) war I have seen a program which showed
one of brits was firing two rifles simultaneously, whether he managed to hit
anything I don\'t know, he was himself shot and endured months of therapy. So
firing two weapons simultaneously can be done.

This brings up a question, in TNE battledress has as far as I can remember
two sockets for fusion guns, one on each side of the chest. Could a fusion
gun be plugged into both simultaneously, if so would both receive the
targetting info allowing dual fire at one or more targets?

I\'ve tried using two SKS carbines at once from the hip. While an SKS 
has little recoil I found that the best I could do was to fire them 
alternately, so that the recoil from one countered the twisting effect 
of the recoil from the other. The reason I couldn\'t fire them both at 
once was that there was no way to brace against the recoil (by having 
one foot further forward), so I would have ended up on my backside. 

BTW with much practice it became possible to hit a 1\' x 1\' steel plate 
at 15 yards with most of the rounds from a 10 round mag in each. Of 
course the plate wasn\'t moving. With one SKS hip firing I could hit the 
plate with every round from at least twice the distance, with much the 
same ROF. It was an interesting experiment and much more fun than 
firing a 12 gauge shotgun one-handed - which I don\'t recommend, on the 
grounds that something that makes your wrist compress so that you can 
feel it bounce back can\'t be very good for said wrist.

Stobor.  I especially liked the scene when they were rescued, and found
out that their teacher had used the word "stobor" simply to concretize
the unknown threat of local fauna.  When one of the students said
something to the effect of "Then there aren\'t any stobor?", the teacher
responded that of course, there are stobor, since the students had built
stobor traps to protect their settlement from some local critter....

Suggestion:  To help players and you track situations like this, my 
gaming group has used glass beads and small containers (like cups, 
sewing organizers, etc.) to track these kinds of values.  Fill a 
container with the number of glass beads equal to the rounds 
contained in the weapon.  Each time it\'s fired, the PC pulls out a 
glass bead from that weapon\'s container for every round fired.  When 
the container is empty, the gun is empty.  When they reload, the 
player can pick up the beads they just emptied and return them to the 
weapon\'s container.  As a GM, it helps, because you can hear the 
clink of beads as they remove them from one container and place them 
with the "spent" ones.  And as a player, nothing\'s more satisfying in 
a gun fight than to hear the sound of all the beads as you return 
them to the "unspent" container, letting you know you\'ve got 
firepower again!  :)

We\'ve done this mostly when playing Hero System games, tracking such 
things as Body, Stun and Endurance, but it also works great for 
tracking ammo rounds and such in all systems involving guns with 
limited rounds of fire.

Hope this helps,
Jason

Just want to let everyone on the list know about the great time I had last 
weekend. My wife and I drove from Des Moines, IA to the St. Louis area for 
Archon, one of the best SF conventions in the midwest.

As a side trip, we drove about 15 miles further to O\'Fallon, Illinois and 
visited "Medieval Starship", Jay LaRosee\'s great little gameshop.

Just so everyone knows, Jay is a great guy. Couldn\'t be more friendly. And 
his shop is the kind of FLGS that I want to run myself someday. Besides 
games and comics, he has a great little section of arms and armor for sale.

Most importantly to those here, the shop is a Traveller "Shrine of Heroes". 
As most of you know, Jay has recently acquired the original GDW business 
sign, which is now fully restored and hanging on a wall next to the William 
H. Keith original canvas of the "Traveller Adventure" cover next to a framed 
version of the cover, and two old Traveller advertising posters. In a glass 
case, he has the hardback G:T book signed by Marc Miller, Loren Wiseman and 
Steve Jackson, right next to the hardbacked compilation of the GDW Alien 
Modules signed by Marc. The GURPS shelf of the game racks has all of the G:T 
materials prominently displayed.

Also, when I mentioned I was trying to fill a few holes in my collection, he 
invited me back the next day so I could sift through some of his duplicate 
items, and I found three things I\'ve been looking for for a long while.

Jay, it was great meeting you and reminiscing with a fellow Traveller. To 
anyone else on the list if you are anywhere in the area of his shop, stop 
in... you will have a great time.

Also, when I get my photos developed, I will try to email a couple of shots 
of Jay and myself with the sign and Keith painting to Swordworlder, so he 
can maybe put them up somewhere on his sight for everyone to check out.

And finally, it\'s worth the trip just to see the 2\' stained-glass window 
hanger portraying a 95-ton Shuttle!

See Bruce Willis\' role in _Last Man Standing_. His usual combat
technique in that movie was two pistols in a small room, emptying
both into a crowd of bad guys. Very expensive for ammo, but 
similar in effect to spraying the room with an SMG on full auto (both for 
doing damage and for suppressing enemy response fire).
He seemed to generally hold one weapon in sight plane, and the other
weapon paralell to it, so both were firing at the same target but with
a wider danger space and higher rate of fire.
As a friend of mine said after watching that movie, "He can\'t leave town.
He has too much ammo."

His character must have had very strong hands and wrists, of course.
Very cinematic, how realistic? I\'ve only held one handgun at a time
myself, and I never fired them...<G>

Makes me think of Gunkata. I don\'t know if it\'s real or not, it\'s supposed

combat instead of Sai, Nunchaku or such classic martial-arts weapons.
A handgun is about the size of a knife, I guess someone with a 
handgun got tired of being at a disadvantage against a knife in close 
quarters.

	There are a number of possible considerations.  I am an old
	CT fart, but here is what I do:

	1) -1 DM for shots from the off hand

	2) -1 DM for all shots if firing two weapons

	3) additional penalties it firing at more than one target,
	depending on how far apart the targets are

	4) additional penalties if a weapon is normally fired with
	two hands; -1 for a SMG, -2 for a carbine, etc.

There\'s a book by Jules Verne you may want to check out. I don\'t know the
French or English titles, but in Danish it was something like "Two Years\'
Holiday". It\'s about a group of school children who is accidentally
marooned on a small island with no adults around.

You\'ll have to deal with the first generation by hand, because it will be
demographically skewed. For instance, if most of the girls are prepubescent,
you won\'t get any population increase at all the first few years. Then, for
the next 20-30 years the population growth could be quite high, provided
the kids could solve the problem of death in childbirth. Theoretically
every girl could have another child each year, though personally I wouldn\'t
think that very lightly. 

Anyway, once the first generation begins dying of old age, you can begin
handling it as a simple percentage increase each year.

Personally. if I wanted to set up such a situation, I\'d skip lightly over
fertility and death rates and simply increase population by 2D6-2% of the
original population per year for the first generation, then gradually
throttle down to a steady increase of, say, 1% of the whole population
per year (or half a percent or 2).

No, unless you get points for style with the gangsta crowd. Of course, you
lose those points if you are haning out with shooters. I\'ve done some
practical pistol shooting like this (just for fun), and was promptly
ridiculed.

Not a bad idea.  However, I would have the GM handle the cups and beads,
requiring the players to keep track of their ammo mentally (just as one
must do when firing an actual weapon).  That way, if the player loses
track, and pulls the trigger on an empty chamber, the GM can gleefully
display the empty cup, shrug, and say, "C\'est la guerre."

Note:  As a player, I will often change magazines when I\'m getting
_close_ to running dry, especially if there\'s a short lull in the
firefight (such as when the enemy is reloading).

If you go by the rules as explained in _Starship Operator\'s Manual_, the
jump drive is simply a Honking Big Fusion Plant, and if that is so, you
don\'t need to have the jump drive aboard the ship, provided the jump
capacitors can store the jump charge for a few minutes before they
discharge. You can simply have a computer and a HBFD on the station and
charge the capacitors trough a big electrical cable to the ship. You
then release the ship, allow it to move outside the jump limit of the
station, and release the jump charge from the capacitors to the jump
grid. And, again according to _SOM_, the capacitors can store a jump
charge for several hours.

However, since CT does not explain what a jump drive is (just how it works),
I deliberately don\'t talk about leaving the jump drives themselves behind.

Indeed. And the power plant is far more efficient than the jump drive when
it comes to getting energy from fuel (IF, that is, the jump drive actually
use all the jump fuel for energy. So if you can charge the jump capacitors
slowly enough to let the power plant do it instead of having to have the
jump drive do it, you can jump with far less fuel.

So what? It\'s an energy storage device. You can charge it slowly. Once it
is full, you can jump. What difference does it make if you have to route
the energy through a "real" capacitor or not?

Really? Have you reverse-engineered the Annic Nova? Could you post the

I don\'t think it actually says so anywhere. Just that the fuel is used. But

No, I think that was in MT, not CT. Can you give any CT references?

I suspect that you are projecting your own assumptions onto the original
article. I don\'t remember anything about the Annic Nova having any volume
specifically dedicated to solar accumulators. But I\'ll check when I get
home.

There, now.  I\'m glad it\'s not just me going on about Medieval Starship ;-)
And don\'t forget that Jay offers a discount to TMLers.  Coupled with the
fact that he charges "actual shipping", instead of $5.95 P&H or some such,
he is a great source for that new G:T book that you can\'t find locally!

        While hardly an "expert" handgunner, I have fired my share of 9mm
into a body target.  The two-pistols approach has only every struck me to be
usefull for one thing...  allowing kinda-sorta SMG fire-rates from a single
shooter in situations where carrying an SMG will get you into trouble...
Particluarly if you allow "panic fire" rules.

        Yeah, it means that they don\'t have to train the actors how to
actually fire a handgun.  It is also used as a contrasting point between the
TV/Movie Spec Ops types (who always walk around with the weapon stiffly in
the double-brace position) and the Rest of the Crowd who look cool and
hip-shoot.

From Oeksos, Prince of Dzengagh:
"FGMP, or not FGMP, -- that is the question: --
Whether \'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
And with hot plasma end them?"

(This speech continues, and talks about:
"The undiscover\'d world, from whose bourn
No Traveller returns,"
which I think has something to do with Scout character generation survival
rolls.)

Or then there\'s Macbeth.  Of course, it should be set in Reaver\'s Deep, in
the Principality of Caledon, but it can also work in the Civil War:

"Be lion-mettled, proud; and take no care
Who chafes, who frets, or where conspirers are:
Gustus shall never vanquish\'d be, until
great Nivzhine Belt to Zhimaway
Shall come against him."

The most viable option, in my opinion, would be a Confederation, rather
than a Federation.  That is, the worlds would be the basic units of
government, while the interstellar state would be relatively weak, and only
deal with a few areas of responsibility.  This is of course, the notional
model of the Imperium, but in a "democratic" model, it would need to be
real.

The role of the interstellar government would roughly be to regulate trade
(kill pirates), to coordinate defence against external threats (kill
pirates), and to prevent warfare between the member worlds (kill pirates).

The big players in such a state would of course be the high-population
worlds, which would be also be the home bases of the megacorporations.  The
high-pop worlds contain the majority of the Imperial population, so
democracy works.  The people who are likely to come second in all this are
the populations of smaller and more backward worlds, who will have to sort
out their own way of dealing with their environment, but that happens
anyway.

Could some world governments decide to start empire building?  Hell yes. 
But this is the kind of threat the confederation was created to deal with. 
Everyone else gangs up on them, or else goes with the flow and creates a
new kind of interstellar state, which hangs around for 1100 years.

Oh, and a confederal structure can accommodate a wide variety of member
worlds.  Many of Jack Vance\'s books have interstellar governments of this
type.

I suspect that the Vargr model would be the most likely!  Specifically, the
Julian Protectorate is a large (multi-sector), very loosely organised
state, that doesn\'t really seem to have much of a centre to it at all, but
managed to kick the Imperium\'s teeth in in at least one war.  This is a
classic confederation, or actually, a confederation of confederations.

The Solomani Confederation *is* a republic, although not a democracy. 
Originally, republics were oligarchies, run by the "respectable" elements
of society, rather than the rabble.  The Sollie state, I suspect, would
pretty much break down into this pattern, with local social and economic
leaders tending to dominate the local Solomani Party organisations.  This
would not necessarily imply the existence of a "nobility", nor would it
preclude it.

        My players all make sure the last round in a mag or wheel is a
bright blue tracer.  When the tracer goes out the pipe, they take cover and
reload.  Usual SOP is for everyone to fire at the target the chap with the
dry gun was engaged with, just to keep the heat off while he shovels ammo.
They picked this trick up in my Cyberpunk game and ported it over to
Traveller (\'scuse the pun).
        It works.

Thanks for the tip on that.  It sounds like just the thing I ought to read

My \'solution\' was that they wouldn\'t \'solve\' it and have quite a high death
rate.  At the same time, I figured there might be one youngster who\'d
happened to attend a birth who\'d become the instant \'expert\' for what it
would be worth.

Many thanks.  That\'s just what I wanted - the complex low down followed by

        Which has the benefit of not getting caught with the murder weapon

don\'t leave them littered with DNA evidence.  Or that you Just Don\'t Care if

I am not a weapons expert, nor do I play one on TV. However, I know more
than a little about the "gangsta shooting stance." From my discussions with
shooters who have tried it, it seems to offer no real advantages. Some find
it to be comfortable, some find it to be uncomfortable. None consider it to
be their preferred style, although many shooters who learned the "right way"
hate it with a passion.

The stance is not a Hollywood invention, although it is an L.A. invention.
It owes its popularity to the gang situation in L.A. and first appeared in
the mass media in gangster rap videos of the late 80s, early 90s. It\'s a
result of people with little or no formal training using handguns for a very
specific purpose: "in your face" intimidation, which more traditional firing
stances are not suited for. Most gang members carry their guns in the front
of their waistband, as opposed to a holster, which naturally leads to
pulling the gun out sideways.

Remember, in most cases these are people who have never actually fired the
gun they\'ve acquired. It doesn\'t seem to impart any advantages other than
the fact that it\'s more comfortable to pull a gun out of one\'s waistband in
that fashion. Accuracy is really not an issue in these situations.

Make that the third from last round.  That way, you can have two shots to
help you get to cover to reload.  US Army SOP.

I help out at a local pistol range for NRA classes, and I am still amazed
how many of the younger shooters think this is the way to go.  It
completely throws off your sight picture; you are basiocally using the
forearm as your sight.  Also, the hold is a bit awkward and so the shooter
is affected much more by recoil than he would be in a normal 1-hand or
2-hand hold.

Purely Hollywood imagery.  Hollywood types are generally anti-gun, but that
does not stop them from having LOTS of them in their shows (generally used
incorrectly).

Possible drawback: once the enemy get wise to this habit then the
first time a PC is not in a coverable location (eg. he\'s  on  his
own) he\'s going to get quickly dead.

IIRC there was a WW1 or WW2 carbine  that  was  clip  fed.  Every
time the clip  was  empty  it  would  ping  out  of  the  weapon.
Opposing soldiers would stay under cover  until  they  heard  the
ping, then charge.

	Inbreeding should not be a problem within 3 generations
	(as long as there aren\'t brother-sister/cousin-first cousin
	pairings) with 20 people.  In the long run, it certainly
	can be.

	Perversely, this may be more difficult with a small group
	than a large one, because with a large one a lot of things
	tend to average out.  If you have the time, you can simply
	work out the \'family tree\' of the whole colony.  Another
	approach that population biologists sometimes employ is
	a Leslie Matrix.  This is a table set up to track the
	distribution of individuals of various ages, for example:

						time
	age	survival	fecundity	0	5	10
	0	0.5		0		0	10	12.75
	5	0.8		0		0	0	5
	10	0.9		0		0	0	0
	15	0.85		1		10	0	0
	20	0.75		1.5		0	8.5	0
	25	0.75		1.5		0	0	6.375
	30	0.75		1		0	0	0
	etc.

	Only females are considered (males are considered
	more or less superfluous by population biologists).  So,
	the above matrix indicates that a newborn has a 0.5 chance
	(50%) of living to her 5th birthday, a 5-year-old has a
	0.8 chance of living to her 10th birthday, etc.  On average,
	an individual will have one child between the ages of 15
	and 20, 1.5 children between 20 and 25, etc.  The columns
	on the right indicate the distribution of individuals at
	various times: at time 0 (at the start) there are 10 teenage
	women, after 5 years there are 8-9 women 20-25 (85% of the
	10 women that were 15-20 yrs old 5 years ago) and 10 infants
	(an average of 1 per woman aged 15-20), after another 5 years
	there are about 6 women aged 25-30, 5 children of 5-10 yrs, 
	and 13 infants.  If you want more precision, the time 
	intervals can be broken down into years, for less precision,
	use decades.  I did not round the numbers so that you could
	see how I calculated them, but you should round them in each
	generation since you cannot have half children running around.

>d) Or to turn c) around, how to work out how many generations would 
>pass before you had, say, Y number of people.

	This is easy enough on a large scale.  Just recall that 
	population growth tends to be exponential: (number at
	time t) = (number at time t-1)^r [this can be worked forwards
	or backwards in time.  For a small scale with a particular
	distribution of ages (as you have), it might be better to
	work the Leslie matrix backwards.

    'body' => 'Here\'s a easy, step-by-step method to creating meson screens of
appropriate DR for GT:

1. Decide if the ship needs to be protected against meson bays
or meson spinal mounts.

Example 1: 2000 ton ship (60,000 sf). Protection from a bay is
sufficient.
Example 2: 10,000 ton ship (170,000 sf). This needs protection
from a spinal mount.

2. Decide if you want average protection (assumes average die roll
of 3.5) or heavy protection (assumes average roll of 5.5).

Example 1: We pick heavy protection.
Example 2: We pick average protection.

3. Divide 20,800,000 by the surface area of the ship. This gives
the DR per square foot.

Example 1: 20,800,000/60,000 = 346.67, DR 347 per sf.
Example 2: 20,800,000/170,000 = 122.35, DR 123 per sf

4. Select the appropriate number from the table below. Divide it
by the result from step 3, rounding up. This is the minimum number
of meson screen modules required for the ship.

Protection          Bay            Spinal
Average             31,500         210,000
Heavy               49,500         330,000

Example 1: 49,500/347 = 142.7, need 143 meson sreen modules,
or 7.2% of the ship\'s volume.
Example 2: 210,000/123 = 1707.3, we need 1708 meson screen
modules, or 17.1% of the ship\'s volume.

4. Now calculate the ship\'s meson DR normally:

     (20,800,000/surface area) * (# of meson modules)

Example #1: The ship has meson DR 45,573. A maxium damage hit from a
meson bay will inflict 8427 points per hit (the ship has 90,000 HP).
Example #2: The ship has meson DR 208,979. A maximum damage hit from a
meson spinal mount will inflict 151,021 points per hit (the ship has
255,000 HP). However, the ship is also immune to meson bay hits.

Note that, due to rounding, the final DR will be a bit different
from the numbers in the table above.

could be used and still duplicate the storage efficency.

That really set them off. Spent a lot ot time looking for the origin of

This was the M1 Garand (US). I remember seeing one movie where a lone 
soldier (Australian?) used this to his benefit -- he was low on ammo, so 
after he fired a shot, he threw an empty clip against a rock. The Japanese 
soldier bit on it, and left cover to charge the Aussie. Nice plan, but the

        Hi, Doug!
        Is *that* where it comes from?
        I had them run into a CAT Squad in my first TU, and I had all the
bad-guys doing this.  The players caught on in a hurry...  I must have read
that in a military rag and forgotten about it.  Thanks very much.

        Maybe while we\'re talking about it, is a "tracer" round any less
effective a vest-puncher than a standard ball?  One of my CP2020 players
keeps a drum of assorted-color tracers for situations where he wants the
gangers to understand just how much lead is flying around.  I\'ve just always
treated a tracer as "same as ball, but visible" in terms of penetration,
accuracy, etc.  Is the accurate?

Apparently, during the Korean War, some American soldiers held on to the
clips. They would fire and ping the clip up in the air with their thumb,
which mimicked the distinctive sound, with obvious results.

*OR*, it could be an experimental ship that just happened to be \'papered\' 
with the serial number \'ANNIC NOVA\' in Alien, and other ships produced by 
that culture conform to the usual fuelled designs found elsewhere.  If you 
assume it was an experimental prototype, it helps explain *why* there was 
never another ship of this type mentioned.  It was produced, tested, and 
found to be inefficient for \'normal\' useage and sold to somebody who used it 
as a \'whatever\' before they died of this nasty virus...

No, not *THAT* Virus!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Actually, the credits show it to be 100% Marc\'s design.  <grin>

Personally, I see the manufacturing culture as trying something wild as a test
bed, and having the design killed after the first prototype.  Happens all the
time with defense contractors here in the States every time they develope a new
fighter aircraft.  After all, a 1 km diameter solar collector is pretty fragile
when actively being shot at, and even with the two 40 ton pinnaces, it can
barely get out of its own way <grin>, and if something happens to either the
solar panel *or* the accumulator banks, and you\'re away from the home port and
ready parts, yer SOL, pal.

OK, keep in mind that SOM is a DGP product for MT.  Now, I *personally* 
happen to *like* a lotta the DGP stuff for use in \'chroming out\' stuff in my 
PBEM.  Nice, but no longer canon.  <sigh>  Remember that Mark designed Annic 
Nova under CT Book 2 (*NOT* High Guard!!) rules.

CT rules *do* say that to jump, you need jump drives installed, otherwise 
it\'s a nonstarship.  Which, to me at least, means you *don\'t* get to leave 
them behind.  <grin>  HG continues in this vein.  It\'s when some of the DGP 
\'chrome\' shows up in MT that \'leaving your drives behind\' starts being 
\'within the rules\', so to speak.

The supplement shows that the two 40 ton pinnaces (pinnaci??) are pretty much 
standard CT LBB2 designs.  Which means, they conform to CT LBB2 fuel 
consumption.  The \'power plant\' I *think* you\'re refering to is the 
accumulator alongside Area 33 in the plans (Pg 8 in the supplement, btw...).  
The accumulator looks to be about 10 squares long & 1 square wide, which 
means on the order of 5 dtons *if* it is only 1 deck high.  I suspect it\'s 
probably *2* decks high, but I haven\'t read Mrc\'s mind lately.

The accumulator is charged up by a solar panel grid *1 km* in diameter in 1 
to 6 weeks.  It stores enough energy to power a J2 *and* a J3 *AND* provide 
internal power & life support for 60 days.

No, you\'re not getting it.  Marc specified that the drives in question are a 
LBB2 \'F\' jump drive and an LBB2 \'J\' jump drive.  Assume they take up the 
standard required cubic per LBB2 rules; the deckplan works out about right.  
And the accumulator is *specifically* stated to feed power *to* the jump 
drives, while implying it\'s not part *OF* the jump drives.

It\'s shown on Pg 8.  That\'s the grey stuff in the middle of the corridor.
<grin>  Of course, it *doesn\'t* show the solar panel collector...

The supplement says it\'s worth quite a bit.  Just took a look at the xerox 
about 2 minutes ago, AAMOF, and it said it\'s worth roughly 200MCr.  <grin>

I thought about using it in my very first FTF game that I reffed.  Thinking 
back, I *shoulda* done it.  That way, when the PCs got hit by pirates and 
their nifty ship got broke, they would now be on a Quest to fix the ship.  
Sadly, I didn\'t even *consider* trying to assign a place for the A-N Aliens 
to be from...  Whatta shame.  <sigh>  Prob was, my first group of players was 
pretty sharp, and they woulda figgered out sooner or later that it was just a 
matter of time before the ship broke down and they were VSF\'ed.

Just wave it off as \'higher than Imperial tech, with a bit of experimental 
look about it\'.  <grin>  After all, the accumulator banks are something on 
the order of 5 to 15 dtons...

Heh.  All good Quests *should* have the possibilty of resolution.  But nobody
sez it gotta come *easy*.  After all, getting the ship *itself* is relatively
easy using the adventure.  So it makes sense for the Parts Quest to be a real
*muther*.  <grin>  No free lunches, remember?

*OR*, conversely, they could scrap out the solar collector, salvage the
accumulator for its metals & components, and just install a proper power plant
and fuel tankage.  <grin>  It\'s *bound* to be less than the cost of buying a
Free Trader or Scout Courier...

If I were to use that today I would make a final resolution possible.
Back then I kept waiting for GDW to follow up wit an origin and was
afraid of spoiling it. It seemed to me tha it and Victoria were leading
to something. This wasn\'t a wild idea, since MOST of the stuff GDW did
as adventures all seemed inter-related in some grand plan. Sigh, I guess
that\'s what I miss the most today... Buying JTAS ans the adventure books
was kind of like following a BIG series, couldn\'t wait for the mext
installment to show up!

I don\'t buy this.  Ignoring orbital effects (a fair simplification at an
acceleration of .1 g) and presuming the ship starts at rest 1 AU from the
star, and applying t = sqrt(2d/a): 

  t = sqrt(2*(1.5e11 m)/(1 m/s^2))
    = sqrt(3e11 s^2)
    =~ 550,000 s
    =~ 6 days

...in other words, far less than the linger time in each system if you try
to \'lose\' it using the random-walk-away model.  And with active control
and constant .1 g thrust, I can\'t picture an autopilot more sophisticated
than a C64 (and not built by LockMart) missing the star.

Good point.  I am still deliberating over just what would happen after the
PCs encounter this group.  For all of them the world would be \'home\' so
they might not want to be \'rescued\'.  On the other hand, they might not be
allowed to stay way they are or find \'real\' colonists moving in and
threatening their way of life.  Haven\'t quite got that far yet.  Might be a
good moment to end the adventure with all that left wide open!

Such as the Calico? One hundred rounds in a helical(sp?) clip. Since there
are military folks on this list, I have to ask; Has anyone shot one of
these? How well do they perform? I have only used them in games, and am
curious as to the reality of the weapon.

As to the original query, if I really felt the need to throw extra lead
around, I would provide cover-fire with my off-hand and sight with my right.
But under most circumstances I would use one weapon at a time.

that\'s the M-1 Garand. It used an integral 8 round magazine, with a the ammo

Except the Calicos aren\'t military arms.  IIRC no military or police force
have actually used them.

I have fired the 9mm sidearm (50 rnd drum), the 9mm carbine (100 rnd drum),
and one of the .22 rifles (100rnd drum).

The 9mm is a fair sidearm - but quite a bit too heavy when loaded.  I\'m much
more accurate with my H&K and my arms don\'t get tired as quickly.

I actually rather liked the .22 rifle.  The 100rnd drum wasn\'t too heavy and
added some heft to the rifle.  The 9mm carbine was also very fun.

Recoil on all was negligible.

I have heard that the helical drums have problems feeding reliable.

Mostly, the Calicos are an exercise in large capacity drums.

For even more info on the Calicos, go to 
http://mem.tcon.net/users/5010/5491/calico.htm
This site has stats and pic for most of the Calico models.

Smart choice.  You can\'t miss fast enough to win.

"Required Items

"An operating jump drive requires several basic components which, when
operating together, make jump possible.
"Power Source: Jump uses large amounts of energy to rip open the barriers
between normal space and jump space. Normally, only a fusion reactor can
supply this energy. Some alternate systems make use of solar power
generators (which operate much more slowly), or anti-matter power systems
(rare and very high-tech)."

"Jumpspace", Marc W. Miller, JTAS#24, p. 35. 

"Annic Nova", JTAS#1, pp. 16-32, was also by Mr. Miller.

I concede the point, and withdraw the request.

I must admit to being totally at a loss at this point for why anyone would
waste so much economically useful space on LH2 tankage, if it is not a
requirement for jump (the only mention in the article is related to power
production).

I was taught to tactically reload my revolver as well in the Police Academy 
by one of the instructors when I asked him. Since you only get 6 shots, this 
IS a consideration...

 You fire two shots, break open the weapon (open the cylinder), and use the 
ejector rod to raise the cartridges PARTIALLY. You then use your off hand to 
MANUALLY remove the two empties and then insert two fresh cartridges. You 
then close the cylinder and fire two more rounds, and then repeat the 
procedure. This is a pain in the A**, but it does allow you to continually 
fire a revolver with a full cylinder, and if you are charged, you still have 
four more shots in reserve...

If you have only one weapon, this is a good method, since otherwise topping 
off a revolver meant dumping entire cylinder onto the ground (empties and 
unfired both). You rapidly ran out of ammo, especially as my gunbelt carried 
only two dump pouches (reloads). I cheated and carried Bianchi speedstrips 
and HKS speedloaders in my pockets (these weren\'t authorized in \'86). This is 
also how the "New York" reload was invented (you could carry a second weapon 
under your uniform, but no speedloaders - go figure); you reloaded by 
switching weapons...

Ob Trav: How many of your characters take Auto pistol instead of revolver for 
this reason?

Depends. I know that in high school we got at least "exposed" to
survival skills in the form of a couple of days in PE listening to an
instructor from the "nearby" Air Force Survival School.

And then there\'s "Boy Scouts" or the equivalent.

You can survive a long time in places that aren\'t all *that* Edenish if
you know some fairly *simple* survival skills. Like how to test food
for toxins. And how to build a fire.

It might take a *lot* longer than you think. I know that there are
documented cases of sighted children raised by blind parents. The
children are physically capable of seeing, but never *develop* the
ability. I\'d not be at all surprised to find that hearing children
raised by a deaf community won\'t learn to pay attention to noises.

In both cases, the parents *can\'t* receive the stimulus, and they\'ll
never try "training" it. An example from the blin parent/sighted child
bit was that the parents would always be saying "listen to the birdie,
and never call attention to anything visual (because they can\'t see it).

It\'d easily take a few generations before the adults realized that they
all shared this odd sense.

Because the energy density needed in the accumulators is so great, it\'s 
beyond TL15?

This is possible? I only have experience with country style firearms and
ammo, not military, although I have done some research for gaming purposes.
Could one of the military types on the list post a general overview of
state-of-the-art firearms/ammo and near future extrapolations? I am sure
that we non-military folks could learn alot. I\'m not talking energy weapons,
just projectile, both chemically propelled and Gauss. These last few posts
have both been very informative and entertaining, as well as showing me I

Sheese, I ask a simple, throw-away question and it generates 20+
messages  There\'s just no accounting for what you guys will respond to
is there. <g>  Of course, I know it\'s a Hollywierdism and it is in a
feedback loop with the "gangsta" stuff, and it\'s mostly to "look cool"
and provide a visual separation between the Cops and Robbers.

Interestingly enough, I did see mention of some possibly valid reasons
for holding the pistol sidearmed amongst the mass of posts. 

The one that got me thinking was the comment about dominate eye and
hand.  See, I\'m very righthanded, but left eye dominate. I\'ve *never*
been able to sight a rifle properly without closing, or covering, my
left eye and with a pistol I tend to sight along the side of the
barrel rather than with the sight, ie, I am a *poor* shot. However,
when someone mentioned turning the pistol over, I tried it...guess
what...the sight lines up with my left eye! That lead me to consider
that as a kid when we were playing cowboys I always favored the cross
draw holster and was snap firing sidearmed...sighting with the left
eye.  It\'s still not the best way to fire a pistol, of course, but I
can see it for cross dominate eye folks, and maybe for the firing two
guns bit...one up and one over.  (Not that *my* wrists could take it.
;)

Another reason that made sense was the intimidation bit.  Generally,
that means looming over someone, holding them down, literally "leaning
on them" with fist raised to strike a blow. Put gun in fist and it\'s
sideways...makes some sort of sense. Fits "gangsta" mode. 

Lastly, the fact that the recoil from a sidearmed position would tend
to spray bullets across a plain actually makes sense in some sorts of
combat. If you want to put a number of bullets into a group spread
across your front and you aren\'t really aiming, just pointing and
rapid firing I can see where having the recoil scatter your shots
around might be desirable.

As for actually firing two pistols at once (notice I didn\'t say
rifles, smgs, machine pistols, or *heaven*forbid* shotguns) I *know*
the only reason for that is filling the air with lead as fast as
possible and hoping something will stick. Or failing that at least to
make everyone duck for cover. <g>

There is a slight loss of penetration and accuracy, but unless you are
playing a hyper-anal system like Phoenix Command it\'s not enough to make a
real difference in game terms.

"Assorted colors"?  Last time I checked, they came in red and green.
Tracers are useless for signalling.  For one thing, they are just as fast
as a speeding bullet!  You have to be looking in just the right place.

Perhaps your player would like a selection of star cluster rockets and
colored smoke grenades?  The clusters burst at about 150 feet (45m) and
break into three brightly colored flares (red, violet or green).  The
flares aren\'t bright enough to provide any sort of useful illumination, but
are visible for miles.  Each star cluster lasts about fifteen seconds.

The *woosh* these little rockets make (each one is about the size of a
rolled up magazine and weighs about 1lb (.45kg)) is indistinguishable from
that made by the much brighter illumination flare.  Lots of fun to be
caught in the middle of an empty draw and hear one of these things go off.

Because it\'s more conveinent?  Think about it.. everyday people willingly
strap themselves into air craft and hurtle towards their destinations at
hundreds of miles and hour at altitudes abopve the highest mountains.  Why?

It\'s easier than going by ground.

Perhaps solar charging takes far too long for any real commercial
operations, so people accept the limitations of the massive LHyd load.

(Forgive me if this is not making sense, but I\'m rather medicated at the
moment.)

I believe I\'ve seen references to it for tank round tracers.  In any case, it should be viable at higher tech levels (not sure what tech the original discussion was at)

That post intrigued me as well, Jesse was the author, wasn\'t he? How common
is this cross-dominance? I have never heard of such a thing, but it brought
to mind the way I shoot. For firearms and bows I am right handed, but when I
shoot a wrist-rocket slingshot I am left-handed. When I first noticed this
quirk (actually a friend pointed it out) I tried to train myself to shoot
right-handed. I couldn\'t hit a tree that way, much less a ground squirrel.
Switched back to my left and could flip a squirrel at fifty paces.

Yo, right-handed, left-eyed dude here.  Mine is due to an astigmatism in my
right eye that caused me to rely on the left one (or so they said in
school).  The sight problem wasn\'t caught until the sixth grade, but I was
set in my ways by then.  One thing it does cause trouble with is baseball
batting.  The cross-dominance makes it very hard for me to hit right-handed
if I "keep my eye on the ball".  I hit the ball more often batting left, but
very little power.  I learned to switch up depending on what kind of hit was
needed at the time.

Doug can probably give a better answer, but as far as I know, a tracer
is a normal round with a *small* hollow in the base opf the bullet. The
hollow is filled with the same sort of stuff you use in colored flares.
It doesn\'t have to be a lot, because you don\'t really *care* if it
burns more than second or two. 

So it should pentrate as normal. With a slight chanche of igniting
anything flammable it lodges in (like a kevlar vest :-)

If the ship is "at rest" with respect to the star, you don\'t *need* to
do anything. It\'ll fall into the star (eventually, as I recall, free
fall from Earth orbit to the Sun is around 90 days).

But if you are in orbit or moving at typical Traveller "transit"
speeds, you\'ll have a *big* vector at right angles to the line joining
you and the star. You have to kill all but a fraction of that
"sideways" velocity, or it\'ll turn your attempt to hit the star into an
orbit around it (or just a clean miss). 

6 days at 40 km/sec (typical *solar* orbital velocity) gives about 22
*million* km side displacement. You\'d miss the star by quite a bit. And
the Autopilot is not going to *let* you set the ship on an impact
course for a star. 

The sun has a radius of about 7e5 km. So to hit it with a travel time
of 550,000 seconds, you need to restrict your side velocity to less than
1.3 km/sec. Actually, you could have a bit more than that, because
we\'re ignoring the sun\'s gravity. But not all *that* much more. 

At the end of 550,000 seconds at .1g, you\'ll be travelling at 550,000
m/sec. 1.3 km/sec is about .2% of that. So you have to have your
velocity vector accurate to about 2 parts in 1000. For six days...

What do you do with all the partial clips? :-)

Also, some miltary weapons (the SKS, for example) don\'t load via
magazines, but via stripper clips. Stick it in, ram the rounds down
into the internal magazine with your thumb, pull the "clip" and close
the action. 

I haven\'t tried it with a partial load already in the rifle. If it
*will* let me "top off", then I guess thins are ok. Matter of fact, if
it works, it\'d mean I could quickly "top off" again from the *partial*
clip. Can\'t do that with a removable magazine. :-)

*Please*. Do not use "unknown elements". That\'s Star Trek BS.

In the Real World any element (or mixture thereof) is easily
identifiable starting at around TL 5 or 6 (1910 technology). 

Add in the fact that properties of elements are actually quite
deterministic (that\'s how the periodic table was discovered in the
first place!) and it gets sillier.

What works *far* better is to let them try and then tell them that even
though the duplicate is an *exact* duplicate as far as they can tell,
it doesn\'t work. 

Why? Because there\'s something about it that their current technology
can\'t even *detect*, much less duplicate.

An example would be someone from the 30s trying to duplicate a
transistor, or worse yet an IC. As far as *their* technology can
determine, the transistor is *absolutely pure* silicon or germanium (or
gallium arsenide, or whatever). Their technology isn\'t up to detect the
parts per *trillion* doping that makes it work. 

With the IC, they can see that there\'s some sort of structure, if they
use the best microscopes. No idea what it means, nor how to create such
fine details. And without the theory, they can even determine *what*
the structures should be.

As a general rule, I say that scientists and techs can usually sort of
figure out stuff that\'s only 1 TL ahead of them. If it\'s 2 TLs, they
can\'t figure it out, because they\'d need stuff at the next TL to either
figure it out, or to duplicate it. If it\'s more than 2 TLs they\'ll be
lucky to figure out what it actualy *does*, much less how. 

As an example of that, back in the 30s modern gigahertz (and up )band
radio gear would be puzzling as all hell, because they wouldn\'t know
about wave guides, and on top of that, they\'d only be able to detect
the IF frequency stage output *way* up at the high end of their gear\'s
range. The actually operating frequencies would be out of reach. 

If you are feeling generous, let them get a few breakthoughs out of the
gizmos, even if they can\'t detect it. For example, the folks back in
the early 30s *would* learn one useful trick from modern gear.
Composition resistors. Back then resistors were still high resistance
wire. Realizing that the resistors in this gear were a mix of graphite
and other stuff, with the resistance controlled by the percentage of
graphite would be a major advance. They might also get the idea of
printed circuits from it as well. 

Both would be valuable "inventions". Just not what they were looking
for. With the Annic Nova, maybe they\'d discover a slightly better solar
cell, or a better way of transferring large amounts of power (ie they
can figure out how the stuff that lets the accumulators dump all that
power to the drive works, but not the accumulators).

Hm.  I\'m sure its a direct multiple of the time of an orbit, but not sure what
that time is.  In any case, this is true, but with traveller thrusters all you
need to do is accelerate in a direction which is the reverse of your orbital
movement for about 1 hour/Gs.  This is the kind of navigation problem you
could solve with 1940s technology.

So help me, I always feel a perverse thrill when canon breaks canon. It is
really a beautiful thing.

Now I\'m going to load up some TL-15 Battle Dress equipped Imperial marines
into my solar-powered Annic Nova to go in search of the AI controlled
Kinunir.

Anybody need any Tree Kraken glands? I have the feeling I\'m going to run
into a foppish noble who wants to go on a hunting trip!

In what system?  In GT a TL 9 brilliant micro-missile does 6d*10(10), which won\'t get through the commando battledress (due to laminate armor; avg penetration is 1050 DR laminate), but will kill anything an FGMP can kill, and weighs something like 2 lb.  A TL 8 DRL/120 will do 6d*20(10) and oneshot just about any battledress (not to mention punching through frontal armor on an M1 tank), but is closer to bazooka sized; the TL 9+ equivalent does half again more and is effective on TL 10- tanks, let alone battlesuits.

>My apologies, I blinked and missed it, what was \'r\'?

	Oops, sorry.  I kind of glossed that one over.  I also
	made an important error, which I will correct now.  The
	quantity \'r\' is known as the \'intrinsic rate of natural
	increase\' and is a measure of the rate at which a 
	population grows.  The correct formula is:

			N(t) = N(0)*e^(r*t)

		where	N(t) is the population size at time t
			N(0) is the population size at time 0
			* is the multiplication sign
			e is the constant 2.71828
			r is the intrinsic rate of increase
			t is the time since time 0

	Thus, with an r of 1 the population increases by a 
	factor of e in t years.  If r is 0, then N(t) = N(0),
	and the population is stable.  If r is negative, then
	the population is declining.  For your example, you 
	might use:

		N(0) = 20
		t = 50 years
		r = 0.02

		N(t) = 20*e^(50*0.02) = 54.37

	or

		N(t) = 100
		N(0) = 20
		r = 0.02
		Ln[N(t)/N(0)]/r = t (Ln is the log(base e))

		Ln[100/20]/0.02 = 80.47 years

	The latter formula is a clue as to why e is used as
	the constant in the r formula.  Note that the value of
	r will depend on the units of time used.  This whole
	thing is probably more involved than you need, and it
	would not work well with a population of 20 individuals
	with an atypical age distribution.  I only covered it 
	because I had made the earlier error and did not want 
	leave it uncorrected.

	IMTU, and I know I got this from somewhere else (probably equally
unofficial), the LH2 is not used for power to create the jump, but used
during the jump as part of the jump drive system to protect the ship.
I\'m not saying Marc is wrong (never argue with an Elder One), it just
never made any sense as described.

	<ping> memory segment recovered....

	High Guard 2nd ed. P39: "A ship which breaks off by jumping must have a
destination and enough fuel to get there. It must expend energy points
equal to two turns output from the power plant whos number is equal to
the jump being attempted. ... A ship which can not summon the required
energy in two turns may not jump at all."
	
	From this can be concluded the LH2 Jump fuel is *not* used before the
jump, but during the jump. The energy required to open the Jump Space
hole is supplied by the Power Plant, the Jump Fuel is used for something
else. 

	Oh Damn, I really don\'t mean to re-start the Nth annual "Jump Drive
Physics" flame war, but if we are quoting original sources....

Effectively at rest.  The Earth\'s orbital speed around the Sun is roughly
30 km/s.  To kill this speed at an acceleration of .1 g (1 m/s^2) requires
30,000 seconds -- just over 8 hours.

It\'s tough to realize just how *different* solar system navigation gets
with a constant-acceleration drive capable of tenths-of-a-gee performance.
Things that look hard with our rocket tech suddenly become trivial.  You
can kill the entire sideways component on the first work shift of the
first day of acceleration. :)

As for autopilot safety overrides, that\'s a possibly more valid point.
Especially if we presume the young or unqualified crew model.

But a functioning navigation system -- without safety overrides in place
- -- could hit the sun trivially.  "Step 1:  Kill tangential velocity
relative to the sun.  Step 2:  Keep the nose pointed at the sun and
thrust.  Step 3:  Turn to plasma." :)  Obviously this will lead to a
nonoptimal course, but a \'real\' nav system will have full optimized-path
generation capability wired in.  Tell it "Pass through this volume of
space as soon as possible, speed of passage is not a concern, and ignore
safety warnings," and it\'ll do the trick.

You\'re neglecting active correction based on optical navigation, tracking
signals, accelerometers, and so on and on.  You don\'t aim once then fly
blind.  You continuously correct the course on the way in.

Sudden fun thought...I think we\'re finally getting around to designing
Disaster Area\'s "Sundiver" ship. :)

Isn\'t there a cross-section view of Annic Nova in the book somewhere, to
show how the ramp works and pinnaces attach?

Okay.  Assuming 1 kW/m^2 incident radiation, a perfectly efficient solar
collector would generate 1 GW of power if it has an area of a square km; 
over one to six weeks, that\'s going to be somewhere between 600 to 3600
terajoules of energy.

T4: Roll to hit is on 3D at 50m (2.5D at 45m) versus average stat of 7 plus
say 1 for skill (in actuallity probably higher). An aimed shot would gain
DM +4 max and the use of a HUD would count this against evading. So say
target number is 7+1+4 which is 12. Average roll on 3D is 10.5 which is a
hit on >50% of occasions. Without target enhancement this falls...

Evaluation: the PCMP does 23 Dice of Damage against an AV of around 11 -
thus 12 dice penetrate.
The rules are unclear if plasma is excluded from the kinetic kill rule, but
as the blast has a side blast explosive effect I would assume so. Thus,
average damage is 12 x 3.5 = 42, and an average person with 21 stat points
will no longer exist. In addition, plasma weapons such as this cause a
further 4D explosive damage and a significant chance of flash blinding for
personnel without flash supressors.

Nah, you\'ve just got to set your spelling checker to "English".

On a more serious note - why fix the Annic Nova? It gives a little bit of
mystery - maybe it\'s something out of jump space, maybe the fuel is linked
up to a pocket universe etc...

Ix-nay on the incendiary bullets.  For the tiny fuel sources in a tracer to
actually ignite anything, it would have to be *really* easy to burn.. like
gasoline soaked clothing in an areas heavy with gas fumes.  Even then, I\'d
wager that a spark from a ricochet would be a better ignition source.

I have fired over two hundred rounds of 7.62mm tracer into dry brush at Ft.
Irwin in the hopes of setting it ablaze (he he he.. fire is COOL!!) with no
success.

While in the Army, I fired the M-16A1 left handed (and have the near
permanent burns above my right eye to prove it), but when I went to sniper
training, I learned to shoot *right* handed.  Nowadays I fire anything with
a scope right handed, everything else goes left.

Actually, it might be laminate (48) and it is thermal-superconducting (96 by
the rules, due to false beliefs about how shaped charges penetrated at the
time Ultra-Tech was first written).

But it will penetrate a fair amount of the time (still less than 50%, but 
enough to be worthwhile to try a shot).

Since the armor is laminate, it has DR 48 vs shaped charge attacks, but that 
doesn\'t help much -- 36 points of damage still gets through.

Apparently I missed this errata about thermal-superconducting armor.

I never got a chance to see the JTAS article on Victoria. I know from
Adv 12 that the ancients hung out there, and I know the basic stats for
the place, but thats it. Can anybody tell me whats going on there?

How about Corfu (2602 Sp March) as a home system for Annic Nova? Assume
a couple of discoveries (an 3I ship crash landing, recovery of ancients
relics) causes people there to send out a diplomatic/explorer type ship
(can u say Star Trek: Annic Nova). The map chip of Victoria could be a
copy from the relics mentioned above. Slap together some salvage parts
from the 3I ship, the Droyne, and their own technology, and !presto!
Annic Nova.

As for no one in the 3I not discovering a "Annic Nova" human minor race,
who says that they have\'nt. Maybe the 3I decides to keep their presence
secret for some reason. They could be dangerous (think X-files in
reverse, or the robots from Sabmiqs {Book 8}) or docile (3I interdiction
to keep the outside universe from destroying them). If so, the 3I isn\'t
going to let the PC\'s keep that ship for very long (possesion of
Ancients artifacts being illegal {Adv 12}).

And if they keep it, figure they owe taxes around say MCr 56 on salvage
income.

There\'s actually quite a lot of choice if you start looking at private 
company offerings, but I suspect that they would only produce to order, 
so you\'d need to be after quite a few of them. Of course in Trav I\'m 
sure that some world somewhere would have the \'cottage industry\' 
environmant conducive to limited runs of this sort of specialty item.

I read in some weapons mag a few yaers back that some private company

I presume that they aren\'t concerned with such trivial matters as 
whether or not there is enough food for all these children, then? I 
made a simple model of a primitive village few few years back, and came 
to the conclusion that killing off a goodly chunk of the adult male 
population (in a war, for example) would have almost as bad an effect 
as the death of the same number of women, simply because of the loss of 
food production.

It\'s not especially effective in the modern sense, but it\'s better
than just about any other non-technological methods. The rhythum
method is better, properly used, but that requires a stable menstrual
cycle - something that a group of teenagers in a high-stress situation
and possibly suffering malnutrition probably won\'t have. The best
contraceptive in this situation is obviously abstinence.

Also the maternal death rate in many pre-modern societies probably 
wasn\'t as high as many suppose. Our current perception is coloured by 
17th - 18th century europe where many deaths were the result of the 
existing medicine, and from the third world which has a higher rate of 
malnutrition than was common in some pre-modern societies. In 
particular hunter-gatherer cultures living on good land (something you 
don\'t see these days) had good nutrition and a fair amount of free time.

From some research I\'ve been doing on this area (for a fantasy 
campaign) I\'ve come to the conclusion that while the maternal death 
rate will rise quite a bit the biggest effect the lack of modern 
medicine will have is on the live birth rate. The rate of stillborns, 
misscariages and immediate post-natal child death would go up 
enormously, especially as the only cure for a lot of problems in 
pregnancy (aside from \'wait and see\') was to induce abortion, with 
varying death rates for the potential mother, depending on the method 
used.

In a SciFi \'marooned\' environment things wouldn\'t be quite as bad, 
because there would be a greater level of basic knowledge of such 
things as basic hygene and the importance of sterilization, etc.

Here in NZ we obviously have special high-flammability plants :) I\'ve

with 100 rnds of 5.56 tracer fired from a C9 (the Canadian licence 
built FN minimi) LMG. It\'s also quite common for tussock bushes to 
catch fire from tracer in summer, though the common cause of this is 
thunder-flash grenade simulators and idiots using flares in areas with  
total fire bans.

It\'s funny - I\'m left handed, and I learnt to shoot that way, so when I 
joined up I naturally shot that way. We used M16A1s and I never, ever 
had that happen to me. The only time it did happen was when some sod 
grabbed my Steyer AUG and I ended up with his. That really hurt! This 
is the major reason I dislike bullpup designs - a leftie can\'t use a 
rightie\'s weapon and vice-versa.

My intent was to say that the skill system by default rates the average
difficulty, and what both CT and GURPS lack "IN MY OPINION" is the game
designers intent of how different difficulties of tasks should be
handled, these should be given as examples so that the GM can have a
basis to judge other tasks.  NO game system can have a task system that
is completely developed so that ALL possible tasks have been defined.

MT had a task system that defined difficulty levels, modifiers to skill
rolls, and gave examples so that other tasks could be defined by the
GM.  So did T4.  I refused to play GT when it first came out because I
did not have the time to calculate the statistics of the game system to
determine the appropreate modifiers and I did not see anything which
calculated these for me.

Exclusively breastfeeding is a 99%+ effective contraceptive (thats equal to
the best chemical contraceptive). It drops off fairly rapidly once the child
starts to wean. Effectiveness is also decreased dramatically if the child is
not exclusively breasfed.

The /Annic Nova/ could be overhauled "in orbit, with the nearby world
having a tech level of at least 10," albeit by four very talented
individuals: "two with electronic-3+ and jack-of-all-trades-2+, and two
with mechanical-3+ and jack-of-all-trades-1+." (JTAS#1, p. 31). There is
also an extensive discussion of implementing breakdowns for the
character-owners to fix. This doesn\'t sound like superscience to me.

Doesn\'t help: according to Marc\'s JTAS article, energy is energy. 

If it is possible to jump using only energy (whether accumulated over weeks
using a solar array, minutes using a fusion power plant, or seconds using
an antimatter power source) then there is no reason for essentially half of
a ship\'s available cargo space to carry LH2 instead. This leads directly to
the kind of "jump station" that Hans Rancke-Madsen and David Summers have
discussed here in the past. 

I prefer to justify what we know of canon, rather than tear it down, show
how it won\'t work, and substitute something entirely different. Clearly, in
every version of Traveller huge amounts of LH2 are used for *something*
during jump, by every ship known -- except one. The LH2 fueling requirement
is repeatedly cited as a major factor in interstellar economics,
communications/transportation, and warfare. 

If there were a more economical alternative (such as jump stations), it
would be in use; since it is not in use, it doesn\'t exist; QED. [(A => U)
=> (~U => ~A) -- yeah, that\'s right. Modus tollens.] There are all kinds of
reasons why such systems might not be in use; that they are technologically
infeasible is, however, one of the simplest.*

The problem here is that HG/TCS also permits drop tanks: "Enough fuel for
the power plant must be carried in normal fuel tanks; jump fuel and
additional fuel may be carried in one of the additional tankage types..."
(TCS, p. 13). Thus jump fuel (from drop tanks at least) is expended _prior_
to jump. 

Moreover, Marc\'s article specifies only five "required items" for jump:
power source (which explicitly need not involve LH2), energy storage nodes
("capacitors or large fast-discharge batteries"), strong hull (with an
integral "network of wiring that maintains the jump field around the
ship"), computer, and jump coils. [Jump coils "channel a ship\'s energy
within the jump drive" and "are constructed of /lanthanum/" -- the only
such mention in the text, contrary to SOM.]

So I\'m stumped -- what is all that LH2 used for, if the /Annic Nova/
doesn\'t need any of it?


*For the record, I believe (based on detailed analysis by Hans
Rancke-Madsen, Jim Maclean, and Ian Whitchurch) that drop tanks are
feasible at TL15 (HG1, p. 32, actually said TL12), but that they are
probably too hazardous to be widely accepted. This fits established canon,
but does not invalidate them or prevent their use.

Well, what has been anoying me is the round of snipping at GURPS
by all those for whom it is some sort of heresy.  I wouldn\'t have any
problem with posts saying they liked the rating of task difficulty
in MT and stuff.  But instead we get this junk about GURPS "lacking"
a "task system" and other junk trying to imply it has some sort of
inadequate game mechanic.

I really wonder if there isn\'t a faction out there that thinks
they need to try and do their best to weaken/kill GT to "make
space" for some other version of Traveller.  Ironically, if GT
dies, I think publishers are going to be very leary of touching
Traveller after two failures in a row.

For all of my "Crusty" comments about various non-CT versions, I am actually
very happy to see so much material available and such a diverse following.
The fact that I have so far failed to catch on with the GURPS mechanics is
nobody\'s fault but my own.  The quality of the material is at least as good
as any other version and there seems to be a balance between editorial
prudence and perfectionism, which allows product to be published at a fair
rate.

There are two ironies in my own situation, first that, no matter what the
rules set, I don\'t play.  Probably contributes to my nostalgia for the CT
rules.  The second is that, when I did play, I disliked the "canonical"
background (preferring a more Asimov/Piper "post-collapse" galaxy) *and* I
made a mish-mash out of the rules.  So, no matter what the version, I\'m
happy to see Traveller material being published because I enjoy acquiring it
and talking about it and dreaming that someday I\'ll game again.  All
Traveller material is good, for the edifying of the body of gamers.

Besides, I\'m still fuming over the beating we took in the FFW.  Until the
Border Worlds are liberated I\'m just gonna be a grumpy and impossible to
please Sword-Worlder :-p

Its been my understanding that a man with a semi-automatic pistol who can
change magazines fast is a lot more deadly (and effective) than a man waving
a submachinegun around.

But since the rest of GURPS (N.American editions anyway) uses the US-Imperial

Heck, even using modern-day US measurements doesn\'t sound right. The distance
between two towns in a fantasy game should be measured in "leagues", not
"miles" or "kilometres". Similarly, other odd-sounding, outdated measures
should be used: bushels, pecks, rods, firkins, demijohns, and so on. Mind

farthings there were in a hogshead...)

Actual damage, assuming skill one, att DM +1, will range from 3 to 14,
TYPically 7. These 7 MT damage points become 7 dice to attributes (STR,
DEX, and END), at an average of 3.5 for 24.5 points to atts, vs 21 average.
0-out  3, you\'re dead... in most cases the FGMP-14 WILL reduce two atts to
0, and thus render the victim quite unconscious... and in need of major

The TL 14 FGMP, versus a Vargr in Combat-Armor, was ineffective due to not
hitting the head. The main shot is reduced quite a bit, and unless you hit
the head, you will merely inconvinience a character... I know from
experience. (I was using d10\'s for damage, BTW). The fragments were safely
ignored. The Vargr took a total of 7 point blank shots WHILE HE KICKED TO

Striker II).

Star Trek and a great huge number of other works of SF in print and

LH2 is (as far as I know) the highest density *long term* power storage
avialable to the imperium.

And I\'ll also state that just because something cranks out *huge*
amounts of power doesn\'t mean you can easily convert that power to some
other use. As an example a big rocket engine generates more power than
most power generating plants. But converting to to anything other than
thrust is a *royal* pain. So why can\'t the part of the jump system that
converts LH2 to huge amounts of power for the jump drive be converting
it to something that the jump drive can use, but is really difficult
to convert to power usable for things like weapons.

I recall a 4th of July a few years back when a friend had an
illumination flare he\'d gotten somewhere. This was *just* the flare
part, pull the pin and watch it go. I think it was originally intended
for hooking up to tripwires so that the enemy infiltrators would light
themselves up for you.

Anyway, we were out in the country at a friend\'s farm. We set it out in
the road and set it off. Sheesh! talk about *blinding*. And it lasted
such a long time too. 

I can truly understand how it\'d seem like *forever* in combat. And just
how well backlit you\'d be if you tripped one of these.

The period of an orbit depends on the semi-major axis (ie half the
length of the ellipse). For a circular orbit, this is the radius. For a
"degenerate ellipse" (ie straight line with perhelion and focus at one
end, and aphelion and the other focus at the other end) it\'s half the
length of the line.

Thus, the time it\'d take to fall to the center of the sun would be 1/2
the orbital period (because you only complete half an orbit) of a
circular orbit with a radius half as great. 

Periods of orbits relate by a 2/3rd or 3/2 power, I forget which. That
is:

P1^2   R1^3         P1^3   R1^2
- ---- = ----    or   ---- = ----
P2^2   R2^3         P2^3   R2^2

I just don\'t remember which.

The problem isn\'t so much killing the vector as it is killing it
*exactly*, and making sure that the new vector points straight at the
sun. It takes very little side vector to mess things up.

Aha! From part 4 of the sci.space faq:

	For circular Keplerian orbits where:
	    Vc	 = velocity of a circular orbit
	    Vesc = escape velocity
	    M	 = Total mass of orbiting and orbited bodies
	    G	 = Gravitational constant (defined below)
	    u	 = G * M (can be measured much more accurately than G or M)
	    K	 = -G * M / 2 / a
	    r	 = radius of orbit (measured from center of mass of system)
	    V	 = orbital velocity
	    P	 = orbital period
	    a	 = semimajor axis of orbit

	    Vc	 = sqrt(M * G / r)
	    Vesc = sqrt(2 * M * G / r) = sqrt(2) * Vc
	    V^2  = u/a
	    P	 = 2 pi/(Sqrt(u/a^3))
	    K	 = 1/2 V**2 - G * M / r (conservation of energy)

	    The period of an eccentric orbit is the same as the period
	       of a circular orbit with the same semi-major axis.

So...

P = 2 * pi/(sqrt(u/a^3))
P * sqrt(u/a^3) = 2 * pi
P^2 * (u/a^3) = 4 * pi^2
P^2 * u / a^3 = 4 * pi^2
P^2 * u = 4 * pi^2 * a^3

drop u & 4pi^2 as constants, and we get 

P^2 = R^3

So from earth orbit to the sun as a free fall is sqrt(.5^3)/2 years or
64.6 days.

I have this image of a ship with disabled drives (pirates?) taking this
long fall and hoping that somebody else jumps in system soon enough to
save them. 

Brrr. Can you imagine sitting there, watching the star get bigger and
bigger... <shudder>

As I recall, it\'s normal to be right-handed and left-eyed. Has to do
with the way the eyes and brain are wired. The eyes are wired like this:

        left-eye            right-eye
                 \\        /
                   \\    /
                     \\/
                    /  \\
                  /      \\
                /          \\
left-hemisphere              right-hemisphere

There is some "cross connection" where the bundles cross, but for the
most part the signals go to the opposite hemisphere. 

Nobody ever said that evolution came up with optimum solutions, just
*workable* ones.

Anyway, eye dominance is almost always based on which hempisphere is
dominant. I *think* I recall that handedness is also *mostly* based on
hemisphere dominance. But without the crossover.

I\'m reminded of the gun a friend once described. A turn of the century
"riot gun". Short barreled, double-barreled *4* guage. Standard load
being one barrel birdshot, one barrel rock salt. 

If that doesn\'t disperse the crowd nothing will. :-)

I have to confess, I stole it from a couple of editorials by the late
John W. Campbell. He pointed out that most authors (including himself)
made assimilating alien tech *way* too easy.

He then did a "thought experiment" involving a nuclear blast dropping a
ramjet powered recon drone through a time warp to 1930 (this was
written about 1960-1965) and landing at an airbase (I think he picked
Midway or one of the other Pacific Islands we owned back then). 

He then proceeding to describe the fun they\'d have trying to figure it
out. One of the other goodies was trying to figure out the ramjet
engine. It\'s just an open tube with a ring of ignitors & fuel injectors
part way down it. It won\'t even *work* until you hit an airspeed of
over 400 mph. Which was about 150 mph *faster* than anything flying at
the time. Try lighting it off below that speed and you get a nasty
fire. 

Sort of like what would happenm to us if we had a captured alien ship
with a jump drive and tried running it inside the 100 diameter limit. :-)

Another article tackling alien technology from a different viewpoint
was written back in the 50s by Poul Anderson. He pointed out that
there\'s not only no reason that aliens would use the same unit\'s of
measurement as we do, but that the base "dimensions" of their units
might be different, making duplication messy even with their help.

The "dimensions" bit has to do with how units are specified. For
example is the SI (metric) system of units, the "base" dimensions/units
are:

	  Length	meter
	    time	second
	    mass	kilogram
Electric current	Ampere
     Temperature	Kelvin
   illumination		candela

All other units/dimension are rendered in terms of these. For example,
electric charge is Amp-seconds (aka Coulumbs). Area is meters squared.
Density is kg/m^3. Etc. 

Try considering things from the point of view of aliens who may have
sense such that they consider other units more important. One of the
examples Anderson gave was trying to find out what the alien unit of
length was and finding out that it was the length of the side of a cube
of some substance the had a capacitance of ....

You get the idea. Until you have a conversion table for the alien
units, and know which ones they consider significant, you can know if
that 3.58723 megohm resistor has that value because it *has* to, or
because that was a "standard" value, and worked well enough that they
didn\'t bother with a custom value that\'d do better. Which is how the
values of most resistors an capacitors in most electronics are
determined. Except when the value *is* critical. :-)

It\'s gonna be a while before they can reverse the process. But in the
meantime, here\'s a lovely thought.

do this to a human volunteer and rig it to a microchip recording unit
inside him. Add the ability to trigger recording at will. You now have
a spy with a built-in camera. 

Or a different sort of "Perfect Witness". 

Add an encrypted broadcast link and you have a new sort of reporter. Or
the possibility of trusted agents who really *are* "the Eyes of the
Emperor".

I sort of figured it\'d be like that. After all, if it can punch through
a tank, then even if it *doesn\'t* penetrate, it\'s gonna leave *such* a
bruise. :-)

In reality, it\'d be "shock" damage as the side of the armor that was
struck hits you *hard* and then you hit the opposite side of the armor
equally hard...

Picture the poor soul who gets to test the new, experimental BD that\'s
designed to withstand a point blank round from an anti-tank gun. Now
picture them *pouring* him out iof the suit after the test... oops.
Back to the drawing board.

<evil thought>

Leave the suit "improperly" guarded in hopes anybody that sneaks into
the secret research lab will steal *it* instead of something workable.
You can leave the nuclear hand grenades next to it. :-)

If *that* doesn\'t cure a munchkin, nothing will!

I just saw a program on TLC that makes me think this is a lot more
likely than we thought. It was about a couple of mines in Irin
Jaya(sp), that\'s the Indonesian half of the Island.

The mines are at around 12-14 *thousand* feet in the mountains. One is
played out. The other won\'t play out for some time, but they are
hunting for more deposits. 

Anyway, this means they\'ve *already* got a road capable of handling
heavy equipment run in from the coast and up to the mines. Well, the
played out one (Ertsberg) has an aerial tramway for the last bit, but
it should still be workable.

They also have these monster pipelines they used to convey ore slurry
to the coast.

Since the mines are open pit, you could get one *hell* of a flat area
simply by blasting down some of the sides to fill in the middle.

Being that high up, and only 5 degrees from the equator would make them
one *hell* of a launch site if anyone ever feels like doing it.

If it takes a week at 1 AU, then by the inverse square law, at 1 parsec
it\'ll take (parsec/au)^2 weeks. Since a parsec is 206,265 AU, that
means it\'d take roughly 815 million years to recharge. Oops.

It\'s *damn* dark between the stars. 

It\'d likely be quicker to use one of the pinnaces to boost the ship
towards the nearest star. If it can push at .1g for a week, you\'ll get
up to a bit over 600 km/sec. Which will get you across a parsec in
about 1600 years.

When I originally qualified with a .45 the instructor insisted that I shoot
right handed, since that is my dominant hand. After I failed to qualify he
allowed me to use a left handed stance, where upon I promptly made my
qualifying score, since I\'m left eye dominant.  I eventually got passable
with my right hand, but never actually carried my weapon on that side in the
field.

Yes, but how much of your shots would actually be effective hits?

I\'m not defending the BD either, but it\'s obvious to me that the suit must
have been designed using Mecha rules--which means the suit running at 70 mph
should have no effect on the legs of the wearer, since the legs of the
wearer aren\'t in the legs of the mecha.

Alternatively if I wanted to design a suit to move along the ground at 70
mph on road I\'d lock the legs into position somehow and use retractable
powered skates. Gyrostablized the thing so it wouldn\'t fall over and you\'re
all set.

Would I call it Traveller BD? Not OTU. In IMTU? Possibly

Well, regardless of my opinion of the GURPs ruleset, I can\'t see that

I think that in the Starship Operators Manual it stated that most of the
fuel used by the jump drive fast burn reactor was actually used for cooling,
though I don\'t think it stated what proportion was used for the jump itself.
In FFS1 in the black globe section it stated that 35% of the jump drive was
a capacitor/HPG system with an energy capacity based on the TL of the
capacitor.
As far as breaking batteries, non-nuclear, and some nuclear (especially ex
soviet) type submarines get power from batteries while submerged. These have
built in redundancy, ie lots of smaller batteries connected together. Which
can have various sections switched out if damaged. Total power available
would drop of course, but any damage sufficient to destroy the bulk of the
battery system has likely destroyed the vessel or damaged it severely enough
to make abandon ship a good idea.
I have done a TNE version of my interpretation of the Annic Nova and if
anyone is interested I will post it.

Because the /Annic Nova/ uses electricity from sunlight to serve the same
function, whatever it is, and Marc Miller\'s article agrees that "large
amounts of power" provided from "[c]apacitors or large fast-discharge
batteries" is all that is required. 

Moreover, according to HG2 "energy that contacts the black globe is
diverted to capacitors ... contained in the ship\'s jump drive" and
"[s]tored energy may be removed from the capacitors by using it to power
the ship." As Thom Jones-Low pointed out, "If a ship absorbs enough energy
to make a jump, and is supplied with sufficient fuel, it may jump at the
end of the turn." /Annic Nova/ dispenses with the fuel requirement. 

Nothing I\'ve been able to find in CT so far explains why jump fuel is
required or what it is used for: hence my dilemma.

As I understand it, you need deuterium-rich hydrogen in order to create the
energy to store in the capacitors for a jump.  Absorbing energy seems to be
just another way to get it, albeit a much much slower way.  Skimming a gas
giant I would think would take a fraction of the time sitting there waiting
for the sunlight to charge your capacitors, thus making it a highly
impractical method.

This indicates that the destination host is deliberately rejecting the

GURPS Basic doesn\'t have a task system in the same way that most ex-TNE, MT
and T4 users would understand. It *does* have the success roll for
resolving task issues, but this has nothing to equate to the shifting
difficulty levels that Traveller editions have.

In all Traveller versions bar CT the prefered method of changing task
difficulty was achived through shifting the task\'s *difficulty level*
rather than the adding and subtracting of DMs to a dice roll or target
number. The philosophy behind this was gone into depth by Joe Fugate at one
point in either the MTJ or the Traveller Digest.

The result on this collection of (often differing) DMs for success rolls is
that most people new to GURPS from one of the task system based Traveller
editions perceive GURPS as having no task system.

Fundamentally, GURPS is more akin to CT in its style. In the later BITS
products we are putting a table in which equates the difficult levels of
the tasks to standard DMs for GT and CT. The system zeros at the difficult
level and has +/- 2 increments for CT (TN 8+) and +/-3 for GT (TN as usual).

Firstly, unless MWM pulls the license I don\'t think that GT will die easily
(12k+ rule books in first run, more in second run) if it maintains the
present level of product quality. The level of discussion on GURPS
mechanics and the level of criticism is nowhere near the level that T4
endured.

The real areas of concern for GT are those where the impacts of using GURPS
Vehicles without modification for Traveller has lead to items like
uber-battledress. To steal a phrase from TNE, the \'Technology Architecture\'
for the Traveller universe using GURPS Vehicles needs improved definition
to match \'canon\'. Some subdivision of the GURPS TLs would help this, and
this is something that G:V2 has the possibilty to help with...

Well, if on the one hand you have a game universe that has been built up
over 20 years with the assumption that one particular crucial detail is
absolutely necessary, and on the other hand you have one single instance
that shows that the detail is NOT, in fact, absolutely necessary, then one
of the two has to be \'fixed\'. I know which part I\'d select.

Alternatively one could just ignore the discrepancy. Unfortunately for me
I find ignoring such things about as easy as ignoring gravel in my cereal.

OK, I have no problem with that. The real money-maker is in the jump fuel

No, I expressed myself badly. I meant that any power plant is more efficient
than a jump drive:

a) A 100 T ship needs 1 T of TL 15 power plant to have a PP number of 1.
   Such a power plant produces 1 EP per combat turn.

b) One combat turn is 20 minutes. 1 T of power plant thus produces 72 EP per
   day or 2160 EP in 30 days.

c) A 100 T ship with a Factor 1 power plant requires 1 T of fuel to run the
   plant for 30 days.

1  T of power plant thus produces 2160 EP from 1 T of fuel.

d) A 100 T ship requires 7 T of jump drive to achieve jump 6.

e) Half of a jump drive\'s tonnage is capacitors (_High Guard_ 2nd Ed, p. 42)

f) Each T of capacitors can store 36 EP. (Same page) The 3.5 T of capacitors
   are thus capable of storing 126 EP. 

g) A jump-6 requires 60 T of fuel. If all the fuel is used for energy, the
   3.5 T of drive that isn\'t capacitors turns those 60 T into 126 EP. Each
   ton of fuel is thus turned into 2.01 EP.

Yes, you were right and I was wrong. There is a special accumulator in lieu
of fuel tanks.

Right, but why use solar power at all? There\'s nothing magical about the
electricity you get from solar panels. Why not just install a normal
power plant and let it fill the accumulators? By _High Guard_ a 600 T ship
only needs a 24 T jump drive to achieve jump-3; although the Annic Nova
does have a 50 T drive to provide the same (being designed before HG was
published), those 30 T are also legal; there\'s nothing to prevent the
owners to rip out the old jump drive and put in a more efficient one. So
the jump only requires energy enough to fill 15 T of capacitors, or 540 EP.
A factor 1 power plant (6 T) can provide that in 90 combat turns or 30 hours.

I got all that. What I don\'t get is what difference it makes (Well, about 5dT,

The entire ship is worth that much. The hull, the two drives, and the two

Keven, remember *you* said that. <g>

In the continuing saga of the Akus Moby PBEM, the "Cousins &
Company" have finally taken possession of their ship.  The /Mae Lee/
is a little worse for wear after having been shot up by the local
Space Patrol while preventing hijackers from running off with it.

After checking out the damage the PC\'s discover the ship is going to
need several hundred thousand credits of work, a new mainframe, work
on the maneuver drives, lots of hull patching, and assorted bits and
pieces to replace.  It looks like they\'ll be spending some time in
Pete\'s-U-Pull-It down by the port. <g>

However, the worst damage of all was to the ship\'s Jump Sensor.  The
ship sported a special Jump 2 Plus Sensor that just isn\'t available
for *any* price in this system.  It was this Jump Sensor that
allowed the ship to make occasional Jump 3\'s.

IMTU, it\'s the sensor that is the limit on jump range.  You can
build the drive and install the fuel tankage for even a jump 6 at
TL-9, you just can\'t build a sensor that controls a jump of that
distance.  Special Plus Sensors (I\'d call them "bis" if I was truly
CT ;) allow the Astrogator to attempt Jumps one parsec further than
the sensor\'s rating with an increased chance of misjump.  IOW, with
a Jump 1 plus sensor the Astrogator has to complete a Difficult task
to make a Jump 1, but can try a Formidable task for a Jump 2.

All the PC\'s know about this sensor is that it was made in a system
to coreward of them called Xtce, It\'s somewhere out beyond the
Montrose Collective and other than its name and a position on a star
chart no one knows much about the place.  Just how the /Mae Lee/ got
that sensor, no one living knows.

So, before the PC\'s can go anywhere they are going to have to
install a new Jump Sensor.  They can plug a standard Jump 1 Sensor
into the ship, for more money they can install a Jump 1 Plus, or if
they can get the government to provide one they might be able to get
a local state of the art Jump 2 sensor.  OTOH, they *know* there is
a better sensor available and they know where to get it...

Ick.  Trip flares.  At least with the rocket you get a second or two of
warning.  Those things just light up.  SOP is to freeze in place.  Don\'t
drop, don\'t move to cover, don\'t even *breathe*.  Just stand there and pray
you really look like a harmless little bush.

30-45 seconds.  One trick we used to pull was wiring ATWES charges
(Anti-Tank Weapon Emission Simulators, the things used to give a flash and
smoke to AT training devices) to trees along routes that the tanks were
using.  They trundle along, and all of a sudden, *FLASH* Driver and
commander can\'t see anything, and we\'re on the vehicle.

Hunting tanks is fun and easy.

With proper camouflage, back lit isn\'t the problem.  It\'s what happens if

For those not familiar with the M-16, it ejects spent casings to the right
and rear.  Great if you are shooting right handed, they fly over your
shoulder.  If you are left handed, your face gets in the way.  Maybe it was
just the rifle I had in OSUT, but it was a real problem for me (and
probably cost me at least two hits in our final record firing.)

To some extent, they can.  However, since jumping one parsec (1 hex on
standard maps) requires an amount of fuel equal to 10% of the ship\'s
volume, few ships can manage to carry enough extra fuel for more than
one or two extra one-parsec jumps.

Keep in mind also that, for every extra jump\'s worth of fuel carried by
a merchant ship, a significant amount of cargo space is used up.  For
instance, the 400-ton subsidized merchant (as described in Traveller 4th
edition [T4]) has a cargo bay of 207.9 tons, and is capable of jump-1. 
To carry the extra fuel needed for one extra jump-1, nearly 20% of the
cargo bay (40 tons) is needed to hold the extra fuel.

Of course, _none_ of this applies to the "Annic Nova", about which you
may have read recently.... ;-)

The problem is that it takes a *huge* amount of fuel to jump, 10% of the
ship\'s volume per jump number.  So a jump-4 frieghter is already committing
40% of it\'s volume to fuel for the jump drive.

You can see that it isn\'t commercially viable to add that much extra fuel;
you quickly run out of space for anyhting else (like manuver drives, cargo,
passengers, etc.,)

Yes, but unlike reactionless drives, they don\'t violate the laws of physics 
- -- they just stretch them to the snapping point (TNE HEPlaR drives may be 
absurd, but at least are remotely more possible).

(If you want to recreate HEPlaR drives using GVE2, use the stats for fusion 
rockets, except for fuel consumption: use 1/4 the consumption rate for 
optimized fusion rockets. Also, add a power requirement of 50 kW for every 
ton of thrust).

Although a lot of people who attack GT for not using metric seem to ignore 
that there is a practical reality that has to be taken into account. And 
really, how hard is it to come up with metric conversion for equipment 
_before_ play starts? For example, you can just use the equipment lists in 
CT/MT ...

Yes, you should use whatever measurements (including money) that is 
appropriate for the setting _unless_ the problems it causes outweigh the 
background feel.

Welcome indeed, Nathan!  The dreaded Cl*f was an unfriendly sprit

First, the quote about limiting range is for a *single* jump, but it
also refers to the limitation of economic utility due to increases
in the *time* needed to get from point A to B. Each jump takes about
a week regardless of distance, so it\'s generally prefered to make
one Jump 6 taking one week rather than six Jump 1\'s which would
take, at least, six weeks.  Next, see Black Ice\'s comment below...

Finally, there is a faction of us that play the game such that you
have to jump from star system to star system, IOW you can\'t jump to
an empty hex.  You could misjump there, and not all hexes without a
star are really empty, but that\'s another story.  <g> IAC, if you
can\'t jump to an empty hex then you can run into situations were a
limited single jump range can *really* make travelling and
interesting experience.

Example:  In my Akus Moby game, the PC\'s want to travel from Mark to
Montrose (a distance of 4 hexes).
  
1.  They could do it in one week with a single Jump-4, but that\'s
far beyond current technology.

2.  They could do it in a little over two weeks with a Jump-3 to to
Roudon and then a Jump-1 to Montrose, but their, beyond local state
of the art, Jump-2 plus sensor is toast, so they can\'t do a Jump-3.

3.  They could do it in a little over two weeks with a Jump-2 to
Leuet and then a Jump-2 to Montrose, and there are a few ships
around with Jump-2 drive sensors, but they are *very* expensive.

4.  If they are limited to Jump-1 and could jump to empty hexes it
would take them over 4 weeks, but IMTU (in my Traveller universe)
they can\'t do that.

5.  So, IMTU with a Jump-1 drive they will have to jump from Mark to
Serbia to Newton to Wrothag to Ansell to Montrose spending 5 weeks
in Jump Space and probably a couple more in normal space refueling
and resupplying as they follow the "main" winding toward Montrose.

To give you two more quick examples. Muan Gwi is 2 hexes from Mark,
but with a Jump-1 ship it takes *8* jumps to reach it as the ship
has to make a long loop coreward and back to get there along the
"main."  Darkmage is 2 hexes from Mark, but you simply *can\'t* get
there with a Jump-1 ship as it lies off the Jump-1 main, only a more
expensive Jump-1+ or *very* expensive Jump-2 ship can travel the
Mark -- Darkmage route.


If anyone would like to see more about my Akus Moby setting go to 

   http://www2.crosswinds.net/~erisr/
   
The starchart shows the area where the game is being played, as the
PC\'s know it.  I have a couple of deckplans up and some information
about the characters.  I\'m hoping to get some Astro-Political
information up this weekend.

Thing about it is, it\'s *different* for the _ML_ because we pretty much *know* where to go to get the goodies.  With the _Annic Nova_, there were *no* clues where it was from, other than the Victoria mapchip.

Well, you *don\'t* need to know the length of a \'wonqad\', for instance, to measure an object with a meter stick.  If you\'re doing a straight cloning of the device, it should be relatively simple, *provided* there\'s no \'cotchas\' like the integrated circuit would be for 1920\'s technology.  <grin>

IME, it is only useful for burst/full-auto weapons when doing "Sweeping"...
with, for ex, the atchison 12.ga. full-auto, flip it sideways, hold the
trigger, and let it pivot YOU.

It does not increase accuracy, it puts the recoil arc right towards the
face, and (in the right hand) puts the ejection arc right over or into the
firer\'s face.

For lefties, it might be usefull to prevent facial hits of ejected lead,
but I wouldn\'t count on it...

There are standard type deck plans in the book on Pg 7 & 8.  The accompanying 
text explains how the decks are put together.  There\'s just an overall sketch 
of the boat on the title page showing an outside view of the ship, but no 
cutaway view.

Assume it\'s not 100% efficient, and keep in mind that different stars put out different amounts, intensities and *colours* of lights.  A real dim red dwarf isn\'t going to put out anything *near* what a Sol-sized G will.  Also, the panel is 1 klick in diameter, and it\'s a *circle*, so you aren\'t going to get a full 1 sq km of collector.

Onesium is used in Traveller, guy.  *grin*  Mostly in the FASA supplements.  
It\'s described as being a transuranic element in the \'island of stability\' 
where the halflives go back up over microsecond duration.

	As a real person, this was part of my firearms training ... you
*always* take advantage of a lull to make sure that the next hot
period finds you with a full magazine. Sucks to run empty halfway
through.

	The other part of my training was to use the lull to pick up a
*real* weapon ... in combat, a handgun is only to give you a chance
to get the long-arm you should have already been carrying.

Being Right handed, left eye dominant, I discovered when shooting
competitively that it was in my best interests to shoot left handed. It
also freed up my good hand to work the action (Used a left handed rifle).
And, since we were using team weapons, it also meant fewer users per weapon.

Of the 12 guys I shot with, 3 were lefties, and only one shot leftie,
besides myself. The two other lefties were right eye dominant, and shot
right handed. None of the other right handers were left eye dominant.

Meep! Wrong Answer! The Annic Nova is a CT designusing CT pinnaces... Fuel
load is 1 month for the PP, and the drives simply require a working PP.
Based upon the canonical month that\'s 28 days.

I copped it and tried it out, but I can\'t get it to work.  Course, I\'m not a 
Perl *OR* TK programmer, so YMMV.

Hmm... Could be because the sail is also collecting hydrogen ions in it\'s
matrix for use in jumping???

Basic asumption of CT, TNE and T4 for jump fuel: 10% of the hull\'s volume
per jump number for jump fuel for one jump of the drive\'s rating.

So, at best, (since you need at least 10% for controls and a bunk, and
we\'ll assume 10% for a power plant and jumpdrive) is 8 parsecs range (80%
remaining), and then with no useful capacity.

Under MT, thigs are slightly better, but are still not great.
Jn	Drive%	Fuel%
1	2%	10%
2	3%	15%
3	4%	20%
4	5%	25%
5	6%	30%
6	7%	35%

since a ship can make no more than it\'s drive rating per jump, and again,
the 20% loss figure is useful (1g, J6) you can get roughly 2J6.

More reasonably, tho, 3J4 is much cheaper, and almost as good. But again,
you run into the lack of usefull payload. It is feasable under MT to carry
2Jx fuel on ships with j1-3, and still get a reasonable payload.

one other complication of TNE: Due to maneuver fuel and jump fuel both
being LHyd, one can easily steal up to a parsec or two worth of fuel from
the Maneuver fuel... in emergencies.

Most designs in traveller have fuel enough for one jump of max drive
rating. Demountable cargo tankage for extra fuel is canon, see The
Traveller Adventure, chapter "In Search of Longer Legs".
Drop Tanks (which you charge your drive capactiors on the fuel from, then
jettison) are also canon, See Bk5:HG and Sup7:Traders & Gunboats.

Charging off of a station is not canonical. It can be assumed therefore
that, for some reason, you can\'t do that.... altho, logically, I can see it.

Jump Torpedoes are semi-canonical; that it, they have appeared in cannon,
but not consistantly. Different printings of the LBB\'s alternated between
them being there and not. The Bk 2 and Bk 5 prohibitions on jump drives on
ships displacing less than 100 tons make it questionable. TNE allows jump
drives on smaller craft.

One other consideration: Banks aren\'t going to want to finance anything
that can get away from their skip tracers by reduced time between jumps.

Unless you\'re shooting a SPAS-12 one handed, which has almost no recoil.
You just have to have a pretty strong arm to raise that 10 pound beast :)

getting a classic revolver just to have it, but my HK USP will always remain
my weapon of choice for "social" situations about the house.

One of the things that we do at DSC (Defensive Shooting Club here in San
Jose, CA) is mandatory tactical reloads.  Stage begins, we engage a certain
number of initial targets, get behind cover, tactical reload, and engage the
remaining targets.  Finishing the stage with a tactical reload is also
common, and a very good thing to do.

FYI for those that are confused.  A "speed reload" or "emergency reload" is
when you shoot the gun dry and dump the magazine while you\'re reaching for a
fresh magazine.  A proper "tactical reload" is when you stay alert for
continued threats, reach for a fresh magazine while holding it between
pointer and middle finger with butt of mag in the heel of your palm, drop
the partial mag between your thumb and pointer finger, and immediately seat
the fresh mag in one motion.  Your weapon remains up and viable should a
target suddenly appear, and you retain the unused ammo should you REALLY
have a bad day and need to reload again.

If the descriptions confusing, let me know.  I can take pictures and post
them on my website for clarification.

Best,

Unless, of course, you\'re firing from the prone position (as I generally
am with my issue M16A2; I don\'t often "do" pistols).  Then you can set
the partial magazine somewhere nearby, where you won\'t confuse it with
either full magazines or empty ones.  Assuming that you win the
firefight (and, as a combat-support semi-REMF, I\'m not likely to be part
of an assault), you police up your magazines, and reload them all ASAP. 
I would imagine that the infantry types are taught something more
efficient, but that sort of training never made it down to us
non-combat-arms types.

You *sure* about that? I\'d *swear* this thing lasted more like a couple
of minutes. 

It had a metal (aluminum?) casing and was cylindrical, about 2" dia by
6" long.

I was thinking more of the fact that your silhoutte doesn\'t look a

your hands. :-)

I think it\'s just that the plants you were firing at wre such that the
bullet never *lodged* in any of them. 

I vaguely rtecall hearing about a forest fire traced to a guy going
hunting with some 30 cal rounds he\'d "liberated". Idiot hadn\'t noticed
that they were tracers. One lodged in a tree and got the bark/outer
wood to start smoldering.

Hmmm. Assume the PCs are in someplace with a semi-desert climate. Lots
of scrub brush. And they don\'t realize it has a high "oil" content. Not
until someone fires a PGMP/FGMP and they get to try outrunning the
resulting brushfire.

Or even just a prairie/steppe area during the latter part of summer.
Remember, in the "wild" state there are lots of places where the grass
is 8-10 feet tall!

Must have been a reprint. The original was in The Strategic Review, the
TSR "newslettr" that preceeded the Dragon. 

I\'ve got all 7 issues of that, all issues of the Dragon up thru 150 or
so, and several issues of Little Wars (the non-sf/fantasy gaming mag
that TSR split off from the Dragon around Issue 6 and then recombined
because of poor sales around issue 15-20).

I\'d love to hear *their* thoughts on stuff like fire-fights on
shipboard and life-support issues. After all, boomers and attack subs
are the closest thing we\'ve got to starship tech.

Check the amount of fuel tankage in a typical freighter design. Then
compare that with the amount needed for jump. In most designs you are
lucky if you can manage two jumps without having to refuel.

Except that you *still* need to know the units. Because it\'s not likely
that you *can* do a "straight cloning". For example, just *try* getting
screws with the same pitch as the alien ones. 

Does the screw pitch matter? It sure does for any adjustments.

And in any case, you *have* to be able to build it using your *own*
units to be able to mass produce it. At least until we reach the stage
of the "universal pantograph", "faber", "replicator" or whatever you
choose to call it.

Hum...well Feudal Technocracy is one of the "oft discussed" topics,
but until now, I\'ve never put my two kopeks into the pot...so here
goes. <g>

Feudalism is based on a set of mutual obligations among a
population.  Historically, these obligations revolved around support
going up and protection going down a hierarchical structure.  The
serfs supported the local noble who provided protection for the
serfs.  The local noble owed fealty to the Duke providing taxes,
manpower and other support in exchange for the Duke\'s protection
provided through all of his vassals.  And so it continued right up
to the king.

A Technocracy would be a government where power centered around
control and use of technology.  This could be where environmental
factors made certain technologies necessary for survival.  It could
be were a low tech population was in the hands of a high tech ruling
class.  It could simply be where control of technology gives those
who control it power within the system.  Technocracies could take on
virtually any political form from despotism to democracy.

A Feudal Technocracy would be where a technocracy organized itself
into a feudal system.  The people would be obligated to support a
technical class which in turned was obligated to protect and defend
the people.  The technical class might owe fealty to other groups
higher in a hierarchical organization, where each level had
interlocking obligations to both lower and higher levels.  In fact,
I can see where technical classes could have interlocking obligations
with groups on the same level as well.  

For example, there might be Power Lord who has the knowledge and/or
control of a local power grid, a Communications Lord who controls
telephone and media, a Water Lord and an Atmosphere Lord.  The
populous would be obligated to provide money, material, and manpower
to these Lords who, in turn, would be obligated to provide services
to the populous.  The local Lords would have obligations to others
higher in the hierarchy (or network) who would require materials,
money and manpower from the local Lords to create and maintain the
plants and factories that service the local grids...and so on.

All IMO, of course. <g>

Well, from what you\'ve said so far, at least they had *some* idea of
the way things really work. I\'d have to know what\'s so "special" about
it to say whether or not they\'ve fallen into the typical trap.

It\'s "sort of" ok to use a few new elements, as long as you pick
properties consistent with the periodic table. 

It was the "here\'s a new element, with made to order properties that
have *nothing* to do with the periodic table" style of doing things
that I was objecting to.

*hangs head in shame*

I must admit, I\'ve used the unusual element concept in games I\'ve run.

In my defense, I generally have used such names as "unobtainium",
"absurdium", and "quiterarium" for these materials, thus indicating that
I didn\'t expect to be taken seriously.

OTOH, it is not inconceivable that alloys using relatively stable
transuranic elements might be used in niche applications in the
Traveller Multiverse (including both official and heretical variants
thereof)....

Subject: The elusive Feudal Technocracy...


>I have read the definitions.  What does the TML have to say on it.  What is
>it?  Why does it come about?  How do the citizens live?  Interested to hear
>all answers.


Before I start: I\'ve always found the feudal technocracy classification
pretty absurd. It\'s not that I can\'t imagine a feudal technocracy. It\'s just
that a feudal technocracy seems so limiting. Personally, I use to feudal
technocracy designation to indicate one of two things: the world is ruled
directly by the Imperium, or the world is a technocracy of any sort (perhaps
something other than a *feudal* technocracy).

Miriam-Webster defines a technocracy as a "government by technicians;
specifically : management of society by technical experts". I know, you said
you\'ve read the definition. I just wanted to clarify it for myself.

I think the answer is then pretty straightforward. A feudal technocracy
would likely be much like the feudal system that was popular in Europe,
except instead of the upper classes providing protection, they provide their
technical expertise and abilities.

How a feudal technocracy comes about is a slightly more difficult question,
since it would likely be different for every society that the IISS
classified in this fashion. I think it goes without saying that a society
must rely heavily on at least one form of technology in order for a feudal
technocracy to come about.

The inhabitants of a world with a very high population might rely on complex
arcologies. A world with very high industrial production might rely on
automated factories to maintain their high standard of living. Hostile
worlds are already assumed to rely on high technology to some degree.

However, there\'s got to be something else, some other reason that feudal
technocracies arise, or else every world with a sufficiently high TL would
have that type of government. After all, we\'re beginning to reach the point
on modern day Terra that it would be difficult for many societies to survive
without a high tech infrastructure.

Perhaps there\'s some sort of ideology involved. Perhaps there was some great
philosopher or political theorist who, Marx-like, proposed a sort of
Technocrat Manifesto.

Going hand in hand with this idea, or ignoring it entirely, it would have to
be assumed that there\'s some reason that a certain group (or groups) of
technicians can seize power.

An idea:

Exotic Technology: The population of Tanbril (made up non-canon name) relies
on a series of massive arcologies to survive. For any number of reasons,
life outside of these structures is unimaginable or simply impossible.
There\'s only one problem: the arcologies were designed and built by a
corporation that disappeared during the long night. The technicians who work
on and repair the complex arcologies know what they\'re doing. They even know
how to replace or bypass systems that have failed. The only problem is that
the original plans for the structures no longer exist, or exist in some
capacity that is impossible to understand or have access to without being a
technician. Perhaps the skills are encoded as part of some religion, perhaps
they are merely jealously guarded. Perhaps several different guilds of
technicians have broken up the different systems within the massive
arcologies and it is this web of interdependencies that provides the
"feudal" half of the feudal technocracy. On the other hand, perhaps
different technicians control different geographical areas within the
arcologies, and it is this that provides the "feudal" half. Maybe a
combination of both.

I can think of other ideas, but I\'m really kind of too tired to type.

Y\'know... After I posted my message, I was mulling this very idea in my
mind, althought my thought process was rather convoluted in getting there
(from Marxism, to the idea I posted to TravCulture some time back, "food
communism," after all, there would likely be a point that food processing
would have to be industrialized, what would happen if the workers of Vland
figured that one out?). I\'d already considered early Vland to effectively be
a feudal technocracy, and I slapped myself on the forehead for missing such
an obvious link.

Doh! ;)

A few years back i was involved with a group that was trying to restage the

IIRC, the 3I would *buy* Ancient artifacts from normal citizens.  Of course, 
they\'d set their own price for them...  But there was *no* mention of 
Ancients technology being used in AN.
 
Damn, the more I think about this, the *crazier* it gets...

IIRC, it\'s got enough electrons in its outer shell to be a good conductor of 
electricity.  IIRC, they were going to use it to alloy with other stuff to 
make high temperature superconductors.

I used to *be* a machinist.  Trust me, we made \'nonstandard\' parts all the 
time.  And if your fastener has a diameter of say, .76 mm (which in Alien 
terms works out to be 5.5 terquats), you can still cut it for .76 mm and 
still have no clue what a terquat is.  And you can measure pitch of a screw 
fairly easily.  Case in point, me & a bud made a custom hash pipe in metal 
shop when I was in high school.  Totally weird measurements on it that 
required some custom threading.  Didn\'t take us but about 3 days to cut the 
threads in the bowl and the bowl plug.  We just hadda be *careful* while 
cutting them...

Now you know why prototype machinists make the big bucks.  <grin>  It\'s a
whole \'nuther discipline from *production* machinist.

Depends on what you use the fuel *for*.  If, as in later versions of 
Traveller, you use part of it as coolant, then Annic Nova\'s drives couldn\'t 
work.  But AN was designed *before* HG even came out, which makes things even 
more weird.

The nice thing I like about the CT ruleset is, technology is a \'black box\' 
thing.  You don\'t *need* to know how to build it or how it works to use it.  
Somebody in the game (by which I mean an NPC) knows how to build it and how 
it works.  From a rules standpoint, it\'s just plug and pray.

I tend to keep using Book 2 drives in Book 2 designs.  But why use the solar 
collectors?  Why do you think I think AN was a prototype that didn\'t quite 
measure up.

It means you can scrap out the accumulator and put in a \'real\' power plant if 
you *have* to without it screwing up the jump drives.

You don\'t have to invoke "unobtainium" for this sort of thing.  You
can just have the device have an internal structure that is
destroyed by any of the analyzation techniques the PC\'s have
available.  They have to invent or discover a whole new set of
technologies just to figure out how the thing works, and by the time
they do that they can *build* one of them.

Agreed! I\'ve made tools to make tools. Not the same as electronics
though. I\'d have to say that while the physical properties could be
duplicated, after very pains taking work, there are still a lot of
varables that can stop it from working. Probably why we aren\'t using
full fledged scout ships, just dribs and drabs of the technology from
them, as we reach a point where we can understand it enough to duplicate
it and finally get it to work.

Actually in TNE ships did have fuel requirement listed for launch. They had
no relationship to the real world, the amounts being broken, but they were
there.

I know, I know.. but think of it this way, I had four officers responding
to my commands for once!

Fun bunch, and the tour was interesting.  There were a couple of points
where I got instructions like "don\'t look into that access way on your
left, or else."  One of the players was a Weapons Officer, so I learned
more than I ever wanted to know about torpedos and missile tubes.

The game itself was great, although it\'s the first time I\'ve run Traveller
in a walk-in closet.  I\'m not claustrophobic by any means (hey, I enjoy the
MRI tube) but one week on any type of sub would drive me nuts.  The players
all really got into the spirit of the game, though it took them forever to
figure out the door lock on the tomb.

I got home at 0500 (first time in years I\'ve gamed all night) and the damn
Navy coffee I\'ve ingested wouldn\'t let me get more than two hours sleep.

One of the players was the chief life-support guy (forgot his exact title).
 He gave me some very frightening numbers on how fast the air goes bad if
they lose the ls equipment.

If you\'ve never seen the inside of a modern sub, it\'s quite amazing.  You
go from a room that\'s filled with bleeding edge computer equipment into a
steampunk maze of pipes and fittings.  After seeing the berthing
comparments, I have a new respect for the people who do this for a living.

I also go to listen to the sonar tape of a Russian boomer off the
Californai coast.  They wouldn\'t tell me exactly where or when, but hearing
that noise brought back that cold War fear.

Yeah, but a flyby of a formation of Type-S scouts painted in national 
colors and markings would make an interesting attention getter at the Paris 
Airshow or during the now in progress Fleet Week.  It would make ol\' Bill

Not sure about that. I would rather handwave a new technology than try and
justify broken science - which I have heard is the case here a few times. Not
that I have ever played TNE...

Wow. 200 times the fuel performance using a much lighter fuel. I see what you
mean about Heplar.

I am not trying to create TNE gear using GT, just working out the performance of
lower TL drives and missiles for my GT campaign. Is this stuff going to be
covered in any GT supplement?

Just altering the TLs in GV2 so that the GTL9 & GTL10 fusion rockets are
available one TL early in GT would provide a smoother transition in drive
performances. Looking at the figures from 101 Starships version 4 makes me
suspect something like this is in the pipeline.

Hehe... It is possible to be in doubt about that. I write, draw, paint,
etc... with my left hand. I throw, swing a bat, shoot a gun, dribble a
basketball and do just about everything else right handed. It was never
conscious, it just sort of happened that way.

So I\'m confused, am I a left or a righty? ;)

IMTU, the IISS makes errors in classification all the time. Not so much in
the physics of a star system, although I would expect an occasional error
there as well, but in the hazy areas of law level, government type, etc.
Your Nivenesque idea sounds like an example where this would be the case,
and I can see the crew of an IISS survey craft having a heated debate on
what to actually call it.

Y\'know, there\'s nothing in LKoO that would be outright impossible
in Traveller - once Cpl. Morrison arrives, there\'s no need for
the Paratime context - and in fact, there _is_ a version of that
same story that _doesn\'t_ have the Paratime element.  The reason
that it ended up being a Paratime story is because the original
story had independently evolved aliens (in the Federation
context) that were indistinguishable from humans.  This bothered
J.W.Campbell, who suggested that Piper shift it over to the
Paratime line.

The original version of the story, titled
_When_In_The_Course..._, was essentially the Not-Yet-Chartered
Freya Company landing on the planet in question and using their
advanced technology, including contragrav, to break the gunpowder
monopoly of the Styphonists, to bootstrap Hostigi technology, and
to help the Hostigi win their war against Nostor. Resulting,
ultimately, in the Freya Company getting their Charter. It was
never developed past that point, the way LKoO was. But it\'s a
_great_ adventure for a Traveller universe...

Yes. Unfortunately it has come down to getting the innocents customers
of the ISP to demand change from ISPs. As the receiver of the email, I
have no clout with the ISP since they make no money from me.

More and more sites are implementing anti-spam measures based on domain
names or specific sites, which inconveniences more and more innocent
people, just because those innocent people use ISPs also used by
spammers. However, only those innocent people (read: the paying
customers of the ISPs) can force the ISPs to change their ways.

I am the same way.  When I was a child I would write half my sentences with

Isn\'t a world ruled directly by the Imperium simply a 
Captive government? [Traveller government type 6 or 
GURPS government description Colony, subjugated, or 
military.]

Functionally they seem the same to me.  Are you 
suggesting that the Imperium has the IISS use a 
different government type to describe planets directly 
controlled by the Imperium to mask these similarities?

On another matter I am not convinced of the canonicity
of worlds ruled directly by the Imperium, since the 
Imperium is said to rule the spaces between the worlds,
not the worlds. However the existence of places like 
District 268 clearly indicates that the Imperium does,
in fact, control some worlds directly.

One method I use to get around this IMTU is to say 
that the Imperium _as_a_whole_ will not ever rule a 
world.  However an agency of the Imperial government may.
Thus canonical Imperial Reserve worlds are not ruled by 
"the Imperium" they are ruled by "the Imperial 
Conservation Department."  Thus worlds which rebel and 
are reconquered are not ruled by "the Imperium" they 
are ruled by "the Imperial Navy"

In a few cases a subsector capitol is listed as being a 
colony.  In some of these cases there are no other 
planets around that could have conquered it.  Case in 
point Sirim [1912 Verge] has (using the DGP stats and no 
I am not interested  in discussing the canonicity of those 
stats, this is just an example.) the UPP of

B 434966-G Hi Cp 210

I can not imagine that 2 billion people living
at TL G could be conquered by any of other
worlds in this subsector (or parts of neighboring
subsectors).  The next highest tech planet (2017)
is also TL G but has a population of only
2,000.  Now it is not inconceivable that 2,000
TL G nobles (with an F-tech government) might
rule 2 billion people in a colony, possibly the
luxurious homeworld A 85A351-G has its sparse
land reserved for the estates of the ruling
classes.  But that is not the situation I wanted
to portray.

Instead IMTU Sirim is owned & run by the Imperial
Department of Technology.  It is a base for
development of high technology (notice that Verge
sector is separated from all foreign powers by a
rift or a minimum of 4 sectors of distance). 
IMTU the Imperium takes advantage of this. There
are hints of this in canon if you read the Survival
Margin TAS reports dealing with the Verge Coalitions
secession from Dulinor\'s realm during the
rebellion.  IMTU losing Verge was the straw that broke
the camels back for Dulinor and caused Virus.  With 
the support of Verge Dulinor would have been able to 
take Capitol before Lucan had a chance to release Virus.

With Lucan dead & no Virus Dulinor would have 
probably been able to put a significant fraction of the 
Imperium back together.  By picking the right cause:
"Defeat the evil Solomani" he would have been able to pick 
up a good fraction of the rimward factions.  He could 
then gain peace with the Solomani by defacto abandoning
the Solomani Sphere & building up defense beyond it.
After taking a few years to do this he could have used
the same gimmick "Defeat the evil Vargr" to try & pull
the coreward factions back in.  I would have loved to 
have seen a TNE where the PC\'s were loyal subjects
of the elderly Empress Isis doing their bit "for
queen & country" to conquer the evil wogs beyond the
borders.  TNE as Space 1889 anyone ? :)

IMTU The University of Sirim is the best high tech 
university in the whole domain of Illelish.  The 
Imperial Department of Technology, and its 
subsidiary the Division of Education, run the whole 
planet. Thus I have explained how the most powerful
planet (despite their lack of an A port) in the
subsector is a captive government.

to build such a thing.

I predict that they will continue to reclaim land from the sea and
build a spaceport on the new land--probably adjacent to the existing
international airport.  Imagine a two hour hypersonic flight on a
Singapore Airlines aerospace plane and then a short five hour flight
to Japan, India, China or Australia.  Much better than the twenty
four hours it now takes.  (And yes, their stewardesses look exactly
like the ones in their commercials.)

Nope. Not suggesting anything of the sort. However, it seems that in my own
hand-rolled subsectors, feudal technocracies tend to pop up quite a bit more
frequently than I would like. Since there is no special classification for
worlds ruled by Imperial nobility[1], I just as frequently use that
government code to keep down the number of true feudal technocracies, while
allowing for the possibility that some worlds may be ruled by the Imperium.

[1] This probably has more to do with Traveller originally having been
something of a generic sci-fi game than anything else.

Supplement 11: Library Data (N-Z), p. 36

"Marquis: The third level of noble rank is the marquis. A marquis is
associated with a single world (generally a large an important one with a
type A or B starport). The title consists of the world name after the title,
as in the Marquis of Aramis (or, alternatively, the Marquis Aramis)."

The Imperium may be said to rule the spaces between the worlds, but that\'s
not entirely in keeping with canon.

You\'re absolutely right, but the assumptions of the Third Imperium really
rule out direct rule by the Imperium, don\'t they? Even the Domains aren\'t
directly ruled by the Imperium, but by an Archduke who is bonded to the
Emperor.

At that point it just seems to be an exercise in semantics. If the Imperial
Conservation Department and the Imperial Navy can be said to answer, on some
level, to the Emperor, then it\'s rule by the Imperium, isn\'t it?

Don\'t worry. There are very few silly questions...

Jump Drives are rated by the number of parsecs (hexes on starmaps) they can
cross. The maximum jump drive in M0 is a Jump 3 drive (3 hexes).

Each parsec of performance requires 10% of the volume of the ships\' hull in
jump fuel. This means to achieve a jump-3 a ship would need 30% hull space
for jump fuel, a jump-2 needs a J2 or better drive and 20% hull space for
fuel etc.

Bearing in mind that the maximum a ship could achieve (with internal tanks)
would be 90% hull volume for fuel, and that the remaining 10% needs to hold
the drives (jump/manuever), power plant, power plant fuel, life support,
quarters and cargo space this limits a ship to 9 parsecs range. In reality,
a viable (ie profitable) design would probably have, at most, 30% of hull
space for jump fuel.

So basically, ships can carry fuel for multiple jumps, but the economics of
doing so are prohibitive for cargo vessels. Even the top end Imperial TL15
M1100 ships only tended to have 40% of hull space for Jump fuel (one Jump
4).

Extra range may be gained by the use of drop tanks, but these are not
avialable in M0.

You know, I\'ve been good about ignoring this subject, but enough is
enough!  If you don\'t stop, it\'s going to turn into a canon debate...

"In the CT era, Eris was hairy, I tell you!", says Keven, "He had
hair down to there!"

"Well maybe, but I\'m telling you that in the T4 ear he had *much*
less hair."  Dom huffs, "and because Milieu 0 comes thousands of
years before Milieu 1100 you can\'t say Eris is hairy!",

"You\'re both wrong!  After the Virus got through with him all he had
left as that fur cap, so by GNU he\'s furry!"  Dave insists.

Chris breaks in with "Yeah, but if you use the GT character
generation he could have *both*...."

"Hey, cut that out!  I\'ve got plenty of hair and it\'s all mine,
too."  Eris growls angrily, "I paid for every damn bit of it!"

"These young whippersnappers...no respect for their elders."  Eris
grumbles as he wanders away, "Besides, what has that got to do with
my Parts?  Everything still *works*...usually."

Nooooooooo!  It is the time the prophets warned us of so long ago, when
the Four Flamewars of the Apocalypse would rage over the TML
simultaneiously!  Already we had "where does jump fuel go" and "what was
the best rules version".  Now the terrifying countenance of "what is a
feudal technocracy" blazes in the heavens.  Can it be long before "why
don\'t people fight wars with near-c rocks" emerges from the sea to
complete the prophecy and signal the doom of us all?

...but really, why *don\'t* they?  It\'s a lot more efficient than orbital
bombardment.  Of course, a lot depends on whether you assume HEPlaR or
t-plates...

Reminiscent of a Buffy the Vampire Slayer [Yeah, yeah, I know ;)] scene
where the curvaceous blond meets the big bad ultra demon who says:
"Last time it took an entire army to defeat me."
To which she replies, "That was then, This is now," just before she fires a
LAW at him, which blows him to pieces.

I think it\'s about time that the Keeper of the FAQ repost the TML FAQ

I inquired once before, but received no response: Can a Black Globe absorb

  {
    'body' => 'Personally, I can see no good reason at all why the term "Feudal" should be
connected to the term "Technocracy" -- except to describe a very specific,
peculiar government -- certainly not a general concept.

Feudalism is a perfectly good general government type.  I imagine that there
are many worlds within the larger 3I structure that maintain the Lord-Vassal
relationship throughout: from the Emperor --> High Peerage --> Subsector
Nobility --> Lord of the individual planetary \'fief\' --> Lords of the
\'counties\' on that world --> minor Lords of the \'estates\' within the
counties --> Yeomanry --> to the peasant/serf.  If the IISS classified such
a government, "Feudalism" would be the perfect term.

As far as Technocracy, there can be several examples that have nothing
whatsoever to do with Feudalism.  If an elite group or guild of scientists
represent the top level of planetary government, they could be described as
an \'oligarchy\', \'meritocracy\', \'captive government\', \'company\' -- just about
anything, including \'religious dictatorship\'.  Imagine a world populated by
low-tech human-types occupied by a spacefaring culture that decided to break
the "Star Trek" style "Prime Directive" -- they would not have to be very
numerous to take control, and to even be "worshiped" by the natives, if that
is what they wanted.  "Theocratic Technocracy", "Charismatic Technocracy",
"Technocratic Meritocracy", "Bureaucratic Technocracy", etc. are all valid
descriptions.  "Feudal Technocracy" is but a single, particular kind.

A \'Technocracy\' could be similar to Robert A. Heinlein\'s description of
"Functionalism" as government -- that is, those who actually make the
society *work* are the only ones who should have a say as to the policies of
said society.  The technicians, the inventors, the scientists, those that
make useful applications from theory, and those that can \'operate\' the
technology of a society.  In Heinlein\'s more well-known government type
(i.e., "Starship Troopers"), only those who have proven their dedication to
the wellbeing of the society (veterans, etc.) are allowed any vote or voice
concerning the policies of that government.  I would say that is more of a
"Meritocracy", myself -- though you can see how other CT \'Government Codes\'
would apply.  More importantly, you can get more specific in describing an
\'unconventional\' government by mixing and matching those same Gov. Code
labels, as was done above.

IMTU, (and please, no heretic pogroms, this is just my little opinion), Marc
Miller\'s use of hexadecimal for the purpose of easily classifying a large
amount of data in a short sequence of numbers, (each single digit/character
representing one specific thing) is great as a gaming device (and really
helps in getting one started in the mindset of \'high-tech\' digi-speak or
something like that) -- but it reminds me a lot of the Y2K bug...

There is, as everyone knows, plenty of data that would be useful for the
game and/or background that simply will not fit into a single hexadecimal
digit (or even an extended version of the LBB "0-F" as Marc had to do in
High Guard with USPs, and then everywhere else that needed more than 16
permutations.)  Now, IIRC, it is connonical to use 0-Z (excepting the
letters "I" and "O"), which yields 34 permutations for a single digit.  I
wish there were 34 Government Types listed and explained.  Same for just
about any CT classification.  But some things require even more than 34
levels/listed items/\'factors\' to accurately (even remotely) describe it.
IMTU, I have grown fond of using a separating character (like "-" or "/") to
separate *two* hexadecimal digits in a UxP code, affording more permutations
per item than I could realistically use (255?).  But I never run out of
numbers, even for long, detailed lists.  And the UxPs are perfectly legible,
if longer than usual.  I will sacrifice an extra line on paper for more
diversity and accuracy in information, especially for a planet.  (There is
so much that can be usefully classified about just an atmosphere besides
"Exotic" -- which is just asking for clarification.)

I know that many people prefer to use the LBB-style classifications as
general categories, and explain anything not obvious in text.  But "Feudal
Technocracy"?  That is not useful as a *basic* category.  It works fine
IMTU, because my UPP codes allow for enough diversity that I only have to
put it down in text once, then refer to it with a two-digit hex number.
Anything new can be appended to the main list and given it\'s own number.  It
would be difficult to run out of numbers, no matter what weirdness you may
come across.  It is this because of this designed limitation of the UPP
codes that there is only a small list of Government types, and the fact that
some worlds do not fit anywhere on that list.  It makes things a little too
fuzzy for my gears.

BTW: how would you classify a planetary government that was just a facade,
with a super-secret \'real\' leadership?  Would you use the government de jour
type in the UPP, or the nature of the de facto leadership?  And how to
indicate such a multi-faced government in a UPP?  Certainly not
"Balkanized".

The Japanese Anime show Macross Plus has a great shot of a commuter starship
leaving a port....sea port that is.

The people embark on the starship like a normal ship, then it clears the city ,
then lifts off clear of the population centre.

While some level of hydo is needed in order to do this, think of the benifits.

1. Starships and Seaships can share facilities.
2. Starports can be more user friendly (these facilities tend to be close to
city centres)
3. Starships do not land AT the port. The land in open sea then transit to
starport. No more falling starships blowing up your city.

So, using Singapore as a basis, It wouuld have most of the infrasturcture
allready for this.

This is the point I was trying to make, but much better worded.  But in
my experience "often" would be replaced with "always".  The group I am
gaming with now seems to be more consistant than the ones I have
previously gamed with.

My comments were not intended to be snipes at the game system.  They
were ment as statements of opinion and constructive criticism, I
appologize for any lack of tact in such statements.

In all the games I have been involved in, if there was not a well
defined task system, the game devolved into arguing about how tasks were
handled.

   Ex.
      GM:  That will be an electronics roll at minus 3.

      Player one:  We did the same thing 3 hours ago and you said that
it would be
               at minus 1.

      Player two:  And last week it was at minus one for a harder task.
How do you figure what the
               minuses will be.

We never got a CT game past the second session.  Part of the problem was
the limited number of gamers in the area, but I will not start a game
(as a GM) inwhich I do not understand the statistics behind the game or
have a defined task system. I have been burnt too many times.  The lack
of a task system is the reason I did not start playing GURPS in any form
or fashion until this summer.

>I really wonder if there isn\'t a faction out there that thinks

>space" for some other version of Traveller.

I have no intention to weaken/kill GT.  It is a very good source of
material to mine for other systems that I will run, the source books
(First In, Free Trader, etc.) are very good.  But due to the lack of a
task system I will not run GT, I will run MT or T4.  I will play in any
Traveller (any rules) in which the GM and players are compatible and
consistant.

If T5 does not come out then Traveller has lost a Game Master.  But NOT
a player.

I agree, even tho I will not run a GT game, I like the material that has
been put out and will continue to buy source books that I can mine for
the versions that I am willing to run.

I\'ve been trying to meld the KBv2 task system (\'cause I like how you get to
use your whole stat) into a combat system (CT/MT with T4 overtones), and
from this basis I agree that this rule is the best I\'ve seen so far. It is
logical AND simple - and interestingly, BTW, is logically identical to how
good ol\' AD&D handles the situation!!  ;-)

The only other modifiers I can see the player arguing for are:

     1.   Is my player ambidexterous? Suggestion: this reduces difficulty
to Normal (primary hand) and +1 level (secondary hand), and player probably
needs to roll 12 on 2D to be ambidexterous)
     2.   Can I specifically train for a skil level in two-weapon use?
(suggestion: reduces difficulty as per ambidexterous, taking a lot of the
character\'s time and money, of course ;-)

...and (suggestion) trained AND ambidexterous characters can use two
weapons with no penalties.

I mean, why not? Doesn\'t cause many more problems than allowing them to use
an SMG (a high-ROF, short range weapon), adds to the PC\'s
quirkiness/character, and the player is happy, thinking they have "got
away" with something! (just make sure it is costly to get trained in the
skill - and don\'t forget to charge them for all that practice ammo!!!

Of course, there will be situations where handguns are readily available,
but submachine guns are more difficult to obtain. A civilian may have
been able to burn thousands of handgun rounds on practice ranges,
but never have had even the opportunity to hold an SMG, much less
become proficient in the use of one.

On the other hand, since no "proper" task system can cover every possible
scenario, the risk of such arguments will be there as well.

The same exact argument can be said of task systems, since task systems
cannot prepare for every possible scenario that the skill might possibly be
applied to. This sounds more like a problem with the GM than a problem with
the system. If the GM has no clear and consistent sense of how difficult
something is, the same problem could just as easily arise in a game with a
"task system" as one without a "task system."

With all due respect, the statistics behind GURPS skill resolution are not
all that difficult to figure out, and if they are problematic, it\'s spelled
out for you on page 45. Even those who are particularly poor with math could
easily use the table on that page, and a little simple subtraction, to help
them to define modifiers based on difficulty.

Please note that I\'m not trying to be nitpicky here, but I do find your
comments rather baffling. I\'m not even a fan of GURPS to the degree that I
care one way or the other whether other people like the game system or not.

Of course in the OTU the technology that is under the control of the
technical class is the industrial complex that makes interstellar travel
possible. This means not just the star ships, and the space between planets
controlled by the IN, but also the shipyards and supporting industries that
build jumpships; the starports where they dock; the guilds of technical
specialists who man these facilities and the academies where they are
trained; the Megacorps (which are owned by the Nobility) which often also
own the academies, ships and ports. And of course the network of xboats,
couriers, stations, and communication gear which bind them together.

I think you\'d find the same exact thing happening in a "task-based" system
with players and a GM who aren\'t yet comfortable with the system.  We had
trouble assigning difficulties the one time I played MT, many years ago,
for example.  So did lots of other people, enough so that Joe Fugate
actually had to comment on it in one of the Digest Q&A columns.  He said,
in short "wing it."  The same thing is going to happen in any game until
everyone is familiar with the system and with each other\'s style.

I think this is part of the problem right here: if players (including GMs)
go into a game thinking that they are going to "get burnt" because you
don\'t understand the statistics, they\'re playing for the wrong reasons,
IMO.  It\'s about entertainment, not math.  

For example: I\'m playing Unknown Armies right now, and am having lots of
fun.  But I have absolutely no idea how the probabilities work in the skill
system (you roll percentage dice, but some skills allow you to read the
dice in any order, and some skills kick in only when you roll below a
certain target on another skill roll, etc.)  But that fact has nothing to
do with my enjoyment of the game.  I trust my GM not to screw me over, and
he trusts me not to rape the system, so we get along just fine.  

I can only see not understanding the statistics as becoming a problem if
the GM and players are in an adversarial relationship, which means the
group has problems that number crunching can\'t fix.

I was thinking about that as I was reading some non-canon Scroll of Heresy.
The question was probably the same as the Imperial Navy High Command asked
the Empress, "why can\'t we turn Terra into an asteroid belt with near-c
rocks?  After all, aren\'t we ruthless whatever-it-takes war-winning Vilani?"
The answer, after the Empress gently sighed, was "political backlash, fools.
After we take Terra, you will personally occupy Siberia."

Though the Imperium leaves the member worlds to their own devices, that kind
of tactic would scare the hell out of them.  There would be no way for the
Imperium to go back to the "benevolent protector" role.  The member worlds
would be too frightened to leave the people who would do that in power.  The
Imperium would not be credibly able to tout a philosophy of "no
infrastructure damaging wars" after doing something like that, and that
would lower the credibility of a fundamental Imperial law.  Kind of like the
USA saying another country can\'t be in the world trade organization because
of their hideous human rights record, and then killing an entire city for
rioting.  No one would take the US seriously on human rights again.

Not only that, but then the Imperium\'s enemies would do it too. (Avast, ye
scurvy....humans!  give our mighty corsair band tribute before we crack your
planet in half!)  Emperor forbid that the K\'kree get hold of that idea.

Even in the Frontier Wars, the Imperium has shown restraint in dealing with
planetary populations.  The infamous Maneuver of Ganulph was infamous
because it was rare.  The Imperium could have destroyed whole Zhodani
populations by poisoning atmospheres with a biotoxin delivered by a deep
strike, nuclear carpet bombing, near-c rocks, or all the rest of the
holocaustic surprises that tech 15 is capable of, but they didn\'t.  The
reasons I can think of are
1) political backlash
2) revenge by the Zhodani
3) it would make the war very, very personal, and harden the Zhodani,
perhaps into a more expansionistic government.

Thanks.  I like the simple part because I don\'t emphasise combat and
don\'t expect this sort of thing to come up often. ;->

I don\'t want to start up the "task system wars" again, but seeing as
you brought it up....;-> Multiplying by 3 always seeed a little high
to me, and anyway here are a couple of alternatives for KBv2 that I
like:

1.  Roll 1d6 the first time you get a skill (that\'s your "aptitude")
then add 1 for each additional level.  Ex:  you get a skill-3, so
you roll 1d6 and add 2 more (3 to 8, avg 5.5)

2.  Figure the Experience Level (Skill level by any other name) as
Skilld3.  Ex:  you get a skill-3, so you figure it as 3d3 (3 to 9,
avg 6) No, I don\'t like the d3, but if certain people insist on
having one in the task system then lets have *lots* of them. <g>

I actually use the first one with a TNE style resolution system. 

There, now one more of the taboo subjects is back on the table.
Muhahahahah!

	I\'ll assume this is a trick question and attempt to answer it anyway.
If you assume that you use the jump fuel for power generation and not
any other purpose, in theory yes. Since I have other uses for the jump
fuel, No.
	Under CT/HG, if you charge the jump capacitors you can jump. But
sunlight does not charge the black globe. 
	With GT, there is an unofficial option for building Black Globes which
allow you can charge the jump system from sunlight. Use the rules for
solar cells based upon the volume of the ship, and depending upon the
sun\'s luminosity and size. See pVE96. 0.08 Kw per square foot, times
luminosity of the star, divide by the distance (in AU) squared.

member to have a long arm (SMG, assault rifle, or shotgun) and use that

and his long arm goes Tango Uniform, or he runs dry just as another bad guy
presents himself, he will retain control of his long arm and transition to
his sidearm, quickly putting the bad guy under extreme duress :)

As for a SF Operator doing that thing with the shotgun, I can\'t imagine them
doing it any more than I can the LEO.

If anyone has any sources for either of these two scenarios as Michael
presented them, can they post it?

reactor from MTU and saying that the TL10 version was invented 
instead.  At least with it you can use the thrusters at TL8/9!

So, what good is this shuttle?  A really cheap alternative to some of 
their higher priced cousins; if you could find one of these in some 
scrap heap, with a little work (and 240K for reactor rods) you could 
be up and running in no time.  Buying one new would be a waste of 
money, though.  You could pick up a TL10 version far cheaper than 
you could one of these.  I\'ll be putting one of those up later.

Nope. Sorry, until we can come up with a cool acronym fot the treaty\'s name
I don\'t see how we can sit down and negotiate. We wouldn\'t know what we

More commonly, they have a sling rigged so they can let go of their primary
and go to the backup in the event of a mechanical problem, or if they need
a free hand for handling prisoners.  The sling arrangement is designed to
make sure the gun stays attached to the operator and out of the way when
you let go of the gun.  As for reloads, you see many operators using some
form of multiple magazine holder these days, with mags clipped together or
otherwise mounted on gun for fast reloads (but definitely not taped
together with one upside down as so often shown in the movies). This should
make a tactical reload faster than switching guns in most cases.

 As for Spec Fores on a room clearance, I heard that they often cruise in

That seems unlikely: a shotgun hanging from your belt is almost certain to
get between your legs and leave you lying in a heap on the floor if you
have to move quickly (Murphy\'s law and all that).  Besides, shotguns are
not the normal weapon of choice for room clearance.  They get used for
dismounting doors and the like, but submachineguns are better for clearing
a room where you might have friendlies.  (For known hostile spaces, that\'s
what grenades are for.)

GT Starships is going to extend the design sequence down to at least GTL9. 
I assume there will be GTL9 missiles as well.  But Chris Thrash is taking
contributions of modules and systems for the book, so you might want to ask
him if he needs GTL9 missile designs.

I don\'t think anything like that has been decided, but it\'s not a bad
option.  After all, grav stuff comes in way early too.

The only way to get a GTL8-9 starship to fly is extensive use of countergrav.
Else the option (IMO, but based on present technology) is to have dedicated
ships (ie starships dont land and thus for non combat ships dont really need
more than 1g thrust Then use crafts or some other method to launch into space)
(I was thinking os a jockey system as used in the space shuttle). GTL8 can not
have fusion plants , which is a royal pain in the posterior.

I dont paticularly like the way GT handles GTL8-9, but it poses real chalangers
and provides good ideas for an RPG system (You use internal combustion to power
your thrusters? Your braver than you look....).

I wonder has anyone done Greg Porter\'s Deisel powered spaceship?

How about this for a THUDD chalange. Design a practical 200tn GTL8 or GTL9
starship?

Maybe the commies knew a thing or two - all the SKSes and AKs I\'ve ever

From memory, and for a lefty using an M16A1 in the NZ Army:

Before the fun even starts place your full mags in your RIGHT pouch 
open end (the top) down (this helps keep dirt out), and facing so that 
when it is drawn and flipped top up the bullets face away from yout 
thumb (it\'s hard to describe, but easy to show). Make sure that you 
haven\'t put so many mags in that there is no room for your first empty 
(which should be loaded into your rifle).

Once things get underway -
1) Remove the (hopefully) near empty mag with your right hand.

2) Sweep your hand up past the right pouch undoing it along the way, 
then downwards placing the mag in the pouch top UP at the back of the 
pouch. This makes it esy to tell which mags are still full.

3) Grap a mag from the front of the pouch (where the full ones should 
be) and flip it top up as you move it to the weapon.

4) Insert the mag into the weapon.

And for those who emptied the weapon before reloading:

5) Hit the bolt release catch (whcih is on the left side, so you\'ll 
either need very strong fingers on your left hand, or you\'ll need to 
tip the weapon over to hit it with your right hand).

6) Hit the bolt assist plunger (this is really optional, but ensures 
that a slightly gummed up weapon will still have propley chambered the 
round).

7) Resume firing.

This may sound complicated, but isn\'t really, and can be performed very 
quickly with practise. Another point against the Steyer AUGs (aside 
from being a bullpup) - it has no catch to hold the bolt back after 
firing the last round, so running the weapon dry means that you have to 
relaod from scratch, recocking the weapon. This is much slower than 
just slapping another mag in.

Unless that\'s where you\'ve got a couple more full clips, in which case 
it goes in the pouch on the other side of your webbing. IME mixing near 
empty and full mags can lead to nasty surprises.

And of those seven hits the Vargr took, not one knocked him down? He

Actually it\'s more complicated than that - the part of the left eye 
that sees to ones right sends its signal to the left sude of the brain, 
as does the part of the right eye that sees to the right. The images of 
the left side go to the right hemisphere of the brain. The right 
memisphere also manages the left side of your body. Thus eye dominance 
is not really realated to handedness, and AFAIK has more to do with 
which eye is \'stronger\', and if there is no real difference the 
dominant eye is generally the same as the hand (and foot for that 
matter). All IIRC.

Nah, just an old side-by-side that weighed nearly nothing. It was quite 
a weird sensation - I could actually feel all the joints in my wrist 
squash down and spring back out again. It didn\'t hurt at the time, but 
my wrist ached for a couple of days.

The stats I\'ve been reading are somewhere in between these, and suggest 
that breastfeeding is of little use as a contraceptive after the first 
nine months of breastfeeding.

I\'ve found in my limited experience with pistols that I\'m equally good 
in either hand because in with my left hand my better coordination (I\'m 
a lefty) is off-set by my being slightly right-eye dominant, while when 
using my right hand I\'m not so coordinated. With a rifle or shotgun 
things are similar - I\'m not a terribly good snapshooter left handed, 
but quite good right handed, once I\'ve practiced a bit (I normally shot 
left handed, so it takes a little while to get things down right 
handed). For deliberate shooting it\'s the other way around.

Yeah, and I really want to dip my nice red-hot crytaliron hull in a 
brine bath. Seriously IMO landing recently re-entered, and thus 
somewhat warm, starships in salty sea water is proably not going to do 
much for their longevity.

I went and saw Wing Commander last week (the theatre had a cheapie 
night), and it wasn\'t as bad as I\'d expected. One thing I did like was 
the way the hangers were spacious, but the crew spaces and corridor 
were low and cramped (though the single rooms spoiled this a bit). 
Quite a nice change from Star Trek\'s nice clean hall ways.

Ok, now explain how come Lucan didn\'t use them in the Black War period 
of the Rebellion. He nuked quite a lot of planets bare, and 
intentionally left many other planets without the infrastructure to 
support their own populations, so near-c rocks would\'ve been right down 
his alley.

Human (most animal) vision is processed in the occipital cortex at the
back of the brain.
	The nerves from the retinae of each eye branch in such a way that the
half closer to the nose send fibres to the opposite hemisphere (so L ->
R and vice versa) while the lateral halves project to the same
hemisphere. The crossover is called the \'optic chiasm\'.
	In each hemisphere, the visual pathways travel through the geniculate
nuclei before reaching the cells of the occipital cortex.
	In the geniculate nuclei and visual cortex, the neurones that transmit
and process visual
data are organised into distinct \'dominance columns\'.
	The dominance column neurones were \'interrogated\' by the researchers to
reconstruct what the (anaesthetised) cats saw.
	Image reconstruction was based on a model of neuron network activity -
the electrical data obtained from the cats was plugged into the computer
and... you know the rest.

Re shooting and hemisphere dominance : the left cerebral hemisphere is
the dominant one in 85% of the population regardless of handedness.
	Eye dominance is a little harder to explain, but must have something to
do with training in early development - appropriate visual stimulation
must occur within the first 12-18 months of life if the geniculate
nuclei are to develop normally (as suggested by the experiments of Hubel
and Wiesel, et al. H. and W\'s. experiments were interesting in that by
applying various lenses or gratings over young cat\'s eyes, or by
colouring the environment appropriately, they could induce some profound
alterations in the development of the visual pathway).

Ob Travs :- the basis of synthetic vision (esp. pattern recognition for
robotics)(TTL 9-10), technological \'telepathy emulators\', part of memory
reading technology, neural activity sensor based surveillance (read
other\'s visual cortices/geniculates remotely), etc. etc.

These have been reproduced in lots of articles on Terra, so I guess they
are highly canonical (if there is such a thing).

The Australian starport (LaGrange) is in north-western Australia. The
closest major towns would be Broome, Katherine, Alice Springs or Darwin.
Perth is on the south west coast of Oz.

The north African \'port (AECO) I agree, would be in Algeria or Libya. I
thought AECO stood for African Economic Co-operation Organisation.
IMHO, YMMV.

The social sketches provided so far have been fun to read. Keep up the
good work, and don\'t get on the bad side of the Oxygen Guild. Or the

I don\'t have the program I\'m about to mention, but I\'m given to
understand that the Aide De Camp software is an excellent way to convert
_any_ board wargame to computer moderation.  I\'d suggest trying that,
before using your time to reinvent the wheel.  That way, you can set
aside time to reinvent fire.... ;-)

I suggest the Strategic Pun and Light-hearted Observation Reduction

posts, they often use the term "splort" to describe their reaction to
said posts....

Note:  I am only discussing one madman\'s reluctance to use near-c rocks
routinely.  I take no sides in the debate of whether near-c rocks would
be a viable weapon under any other circumstances.

My main guess as to why Lucan didn\'t use near-c rocks as a routine
weapon:

It takes too long to bombard a world using near-c rocks.  Nukes, gas,
and germs are much quicker.  After all, to use near-c rocks, one must
first occupy the outer reaches of a star system, then fit some sort of
drive to rocks, then fire them, then wait for the rocks to hit.  With
nukes, one merely puts some bombardment ships in orbit, then suppresses
the defenses, then pops nukes as desired.  The same applies to gas and
germs.  Quick, easy, and deeply unpleasant for the target world\'s
inhabitants.

Lucan doesn\'t strike me as the type of tyrant who would be willing to
wait for results.

(BTW, if you haven\'t guessed by my language above, I always thought that
Lucan was the _least_ qualified contender for the Iridium Throne....)

For Imperial ships, I tend to name ships after distinguished Terran
wet-navy ships of the same classification, or with similar conventions
to Terran (primarily WW II era US Navy) wet navies.  Thus, I\'ve designed
the ST. LOUIS, BROOKLYN, and TUSCALOOSA-class cruisers, the AGINCOURT
and YAMATO class battleships, and the REUBEN TUCKER-class platoon drop
transport.

However, I would expect the Imperial Navy to have ships with names of
Vilani (and various minor race) origins.  Meanwhile, the Zhos and Sword
Worlders would have their own naming conventions.  (I would assume that
the Solomani would use Terran-based names for most of their warships.)

This doesn\'t even begin to discuss ship names for the various
non-humaniti races....

Any suggestions?

        Hi, Doug!
        No, it was the *stupidest* in Trek canon.  In "Balance of Terror"
Kirk uses hose-the-hex concept proximity fuzed torpedoes to simply shell the
stuffing out of the area that Spock had been able to localize the probable
location of the Bird of Prey.  In fact, at one point, Spock is even able to
optically "eaves-drop" on a bridge camera, even though unable to exactly
pin-point the ship location...
       In ST:TUDC, he hangs around and lets the snot get kicked out the
Enterprise without even trying to use the three generations of tech newer
sensors and proximity torpedoes.  Duuuuuh.
        Excelsior was even less impressive, given that her ROF on her
torpedo tubes seemed to be 50% that of the Enterprise.  And when they beamed
down to prevent the assasination, where were the hundred-odd guys in Red
Shirts from between the two ships?
        Fun movie, yes.  However, suffered horribly from a good case of
canon-ignorance.

I agree the "no LH2" requirement could revolutionize starship propulsion...
if it could be duplicated.

I may have mentioned before that the Annic Nova was used in our old gaming
club. The rationalization for it not needing LH2 was that it was connected
to a stable normal-space bubble in jump space. Jump bubbles formed by
normal jump drives decay after a week, but the Annic Nova\'s stayed
indefinitely and could be used again and again. Such stable jump bubbles
were extremely rare and valuable natural phenomena which could not be
manufactured.

But most pistols eject from the right (for the majority of right-handed
users) so as the spent cartriges do not travel across their body/face
(safety and non-distraction -- two reasons I was given in the service)...
most of those scenes have the pistol layed inwards placing the port
uppermost not downwards?

Yeah that makes a whole lot more sense than what I said. Huh, that\'s what
you get for a civie trying to talk service.
Come to think of it, as per above, the SG\'s used to blow the locks then they
switch to a precision weapon upon entry.  

I\'m pretty sure about the releasing the primary when dry (and yeah I think
they said it was on a sling or some such) and going for the secondary as
opposed to reloading, on the basis that it was a lot faster to yank a new
weapon and fire than to reload the old. Though this scenario was to do with
a surprise entry into a drug den as opposed to entry after a siege, so I
guess that changes the rules a tad.

Honestly I\'m not talking pooh, however I could be relaying misheard pooh.

BTW I got so many ailments that conscription can be bandied about as long as
they like, but I\'m still sitting 4F pretty. 

I don\'t know why I just said that.

		The only way to get a GTL8-9 starship to fly is extensive
use of countergrav.

have dedicated

poses real chalangers
		and provides good ideas for an RPG system (You use internal
combustion to power

		I wonder has anyone done Greg Porter\'s Deisel powered
spaceship?

		How about this for a THUDD chalange. Design a practical
200tn GTL8 or GTL9

		From memory, and for a lefty using an M16A1 in the NZ Army:

		Before the fun even starts place your full mags in your
RIGHT pouch 
		open end (the top) down (this helps keep dirt out), and
facing so that 
		when it is drawn and flipped top up the bullets face away
from yout 
		thumb (it\'s hard to describe, but easy to show). Make sure
that you 
		haven\'t put so many mags in that there is no room for your
first empty 
		(which should be loaded into your rifle).

		Once things get underway -
		1) Remove the (hopefully) near empty mag with your right
hand.

		2) Sweep your hand up past the right pouch undoing it along
the way, 
		then downwards placing the mag in the pouch top UP at the
back of the 
		pouch. This makes it esy to tell which mags are still full.

		3) Grap a mag from the front of the pouch (where the full
ones should 
		be) and flip it top up as you move it to the weapon.

		4) Insert the mag into the weapon.

		And for those who emptied the weapon before reloading:

		5) Hit the bolt release catch (whcih is on the left side, so
you\'ll 
		either need very strong fingers on your left hand, or you\'ll
need to 
		tip the weapon over to hit it with your right hand).

		6) Hit the bolt assist plunger (this is really optional, but
ensures 
		that a slightly gummed up weapon will still have propley
chambered the 
		round).

		7) Resume firing.

		This may sound complicated, but isn\'t really, and can be
performed very 
		quickly with practise. Another point against the Steyer AUGs
(aside 
		from being a bullpup) - it has no catch to hold the bolt
back after 
		firing the last round, so running the weapon dry means that
you have to 
		relaod from scratch, recocking the weapon. This is much
slower than 
		just slapping another mag in.

		Unless that\'s where you\'ve got a couple more full clips, in
which case 
		it goes in the pouch on the other side of your webbing. IME
mixing near

		Actually it\'s more complicated than that - the part of the
left eye

the brain, 
		as does the part of the right eye that sees to the right.
The images of

dominance

the

that 
		matter). All IIRC.

  In keeping with the mandate of the 1997 ROM TL Flamewar Historical
Re-enactment Society* we proudly present "Trolling for Leroy-ites**":

  Seeing\'s as the indicator "Z" is listed in HG2 as being "reserved", you
may actually have hit upon the true (i.e., Leroys) answer!

  For your next assignment please choose one or more of the following:
i) why do no CT/MT books properly refer to the ROM as being explicitly
TL G+? Is it merely bad editing or is there a conspiracy at work?
ii) account for why the MT rules books listing maximum TL in the 3I as being
F really means "DGP wants to give out kewl TL G toys, so Terra was TL F or G
at a minimum during the Solomani Rim War".
iii) <fnord>
iv) why was Terra TL G+ between 2311 AD & 2745 AD, TL E or F circa 5520
AD, and neither maintained an empire during the Long Night nor was able to
further increase their TL in the intervening _two-and-a-half millennia_??

  Demerits may be issued for coherent arguments.

  Please work out the answers at your convenience, and then inform the list
of your success. _Do not_ explain any answers you might choose to provide.

For future reference:  _Please_ don\'t post attachments to the TML. 
While most of us Statesiders don\'t have to pay per-minute for the local
call to access the Internet, many of our overseas brethren _do_ have to
pay per-minute.  They shouldn\'t be compelled to waste bandwidth
downloading attachments that they don\'t want.

Downport.com should have an e-mail link on the site (I never looked for
one, but most sites have one).  Talk to them directly about file
transfers.

My wife works in childcare and has seen over the years, women whom breast
feed, with children only 9-10 months older than the new baby.  That\'s to say
that the youngest child was conceived within days of the eldest\'s birth and
while breastfeeding that child.  I can\'t say how common it is though.

Since dumping or reflecting heat is a serious design concideration, I would
assume that this is allready factered into starships designs.

The Space shuttle\'s black insulation bricks can be touched SECONDS after being
taken out of a furnace. While the bricks still glow.

A spaceship doing any reasonable speed required for landing/takeoff will be
designed to dump reaction heat generated by friction, if only to protect the
crew inside.

And lets face it, Travelelr material bounces plasma. Salt water would not affect
it...

ObTrav : A deralict spaceship is found submurged underwater, from the
Interstellar Wars. The hulls are fine, but the nuclear missiles have rusted to
critical state, and need to be removed before damaging the enviroment (booms,
radiation el at)

Apparently 40% of non-nursing and 15% of nursing mothers being 
menstruation within 6 weeks, and about 10% of mothers will be fertile 
before their first post-birth period, so I\'d say "not very".

Just curious with terminology now, but is a mecha (as you describe this) a
vehicle or a suit?  My personal take on the term "Battle Dress" was that it
was "worn" by the user, not sat in like a vehicle?  Could this be where a
lot of confusion stems from with these things/issues?  Is this unit a mech
or power assisted armour?

Depends on just *whose* national colors they are flying, now doesn\'t
it?

Personally, I\'d like to see a formation of Skalavans (from Lee Correy\'s
"Manna") do a fast pass.

For those not familiar with the book, the Skalavan were an interesting
"interface" fighter. Capable of operating from Geosynch orbit down to
sea level. For them a "fast pass" in the air would be at Mach 25.

I think a Mach 25 pass by *anything* would impress the folks at the
airshow. 

BTW, they used some cute induced ionization tricks to tailor the
airflow over the airframe. Kept the plasma from burning through, and
kept the airflow smooth even at hypersonic speeds.

Well, until you get to the really ridiculous drive efficiencies at
later TLs, you want to be near the equator (gives you a thousand mile
an hour boost), at high altitude (saves fighting air resistance).

Other considerations are having a whole lot of not much along the
prevailing launch path. That\'s why Kennedy is used for typical shots,
and Vandenberg is used for polar shots. Nothing but empty ocean for the
pieces to fall on if there\'s a problem.

Someone suggested Singapore. As I recall there\'s a lot of islands and
whatnot to the east of Singapore. New Guinea just has ocean. Plus
altitude.

From University of Aberdeen study (1988). Exclusive breastfeeding (that is
the child is exclusively breastfeed) was found to be over 99% effective in
preventing ovulation. This result was confirmed in several followup studies.
The effectiveness of breastfeeding as contraception in modern times has
been dramatically reduced by the introduction of infant formula and earlier
weaning.

Because by nine months the child is (or at least should be) no longer being
exclusively breastfeed. If the mother is not having to constantly produce milk
the conctraceptive effect is lost.

Either a type 6. Captive government or a classic type 3. Self-Perpetuating Oligarchy.

In point of fact, I think you\'re over-complicating things. The Government
types in the classic 0-D list are actually pretty wide open, and the
classification is supposed to represent which type it is _closest_ to.

Now, how your hypothetical Secret Society government would be classified by
the IISS...well that\'s another kettle of land crabs. Depends on how close to
The Truth the IISS got in it\'s evaluation of the system.

As far as your myriad \'technocracies\' go, they are all adequately described by
the existing gov codes; no where in the description of the government codes is
a description of the priveledged classes in each system, your Religious
Technocracy is simply a Religious dictatorship, wherein the prest class
_happens_ to be the techies.

Who said anything about being surprised? That wasn\'t my point at all. My
point was that the accumulators on the Annic Nova allowed a solar collector
to build up a huge charge over a period of 1 to 6 weeks. Substitute a
standard power plant and you can build up the same charge over a couple of
days[*]. Then, when the accumulators are fully charged, you can dump the
whole load into the jump drive capacitors over that 20-40 minute period.
The net result is that instead of 50% of the ship\'s volume used on jump
fuel tankage, you have 1% of it taken up by Super Accumulators (tm). Now,
unless such accumulators are insanely expensive (and the total value of
the Annic Nova was estimated to be only MCr200, hull, drives, and pinnaces
with a value from new of MCr214 included), they are far, far better
ecomomically than standard ships. Even if they are insanely expensive, 
they would be used for special purposes (A ship capable of multiple jumps
on a few tons of fuel would be able to cross the Great Rift, for example).

Thus there must be some reason why not everybody is using them. I liked
the suggestion about the very rare, naturally occurring jumpspace bubbles,
except that such a bubble would, IMO, be worth more than the estimated
MCr200 alone.

It would be interesting to design a dedicated 600 T merchant ship with a
set of Annic Nova accumulators, figure out how much more the extra cargo
space would allow it to earn and work out the value of the accumulators,
but I\'m swamped with work for the moment. Anybody else like to try it?

[*] Or in a week by a power plant one third as large if you claim that the
    one week period is an upper limit to how fast the accumulators can be
    filled.

I disagree. IMO the Imperial structure is split. I think that Imperial nobles
deal with Imperial affairs, not internal planetary affairs. Of course, some
Imperial nobles will have planetary-level vassals, but that would be wearing
a different hat (or coronet ;-). I posted my opinion of the structure of the
Imperium about a year ago, so with apologies to those who\'s seen it before,
I think there\'s enough newcomers to excuse a repost.

(BTW. if anyone has been selected to write GT:Nobles and you like any of
this, feel free to mine the article for ideas or even use it verbatim).
 
		      THE STRUCTURE OF THE IMPERIUM
		      =============================

In theory the structure of the Imperium is very simple: Each star system
constitutes a sovereignty governed in any way its inhabitants see fit. As
members of the Imperium these sovereignties have surrendered certain of
their rights to the Emperor; they agree to let him collect and administer
a certain percentage of their annual production, to obey a number of basic
laws (the Imperial High Laws), to let him tax certain activities, and to
leave foreign relations with non-Imperial states to him. The Emperor turns
over these rights to his vassals in return for fealthy and these vassals in
turn parcel them out to lesser vassals. Each star system thus have two
associated authorities: its own government administering system affairs and
an Imperial noble administering Imperial affairs.

That\'s the theory. Human nature (and most alien natures too) being what it
is, it is no surprise that in practice exceptions abound. Indeed, it could
be said that the exceptions are the norm.
        MULTI-SYSTEM SOVEREIGNTIES: The Imperium frown on multi-system
sovereignties, but quite a number of these exist. In the early days of the
Imperium many pocket empires joined it as a unit. Whenever possible the
Imperium tries to break these up eventually, but a number still exist even
today. On occasion the Imperium has even been obliged to form some of its
own to meet exceptional political problems; the largest and most famous
examples are the Antarean and Solomani Autonomous regions. A more frequent
source of multi-system sovereignties are the planting of colonies by member
systems. Imperial policy favors the granting of full membership to colony
worlds that have grown big enough to make it on their own (which is why some
colonies are deliberately kept much smaller than optimum by their mother
worlds), but if a former colony prefers union with their mother world there
is not much the Imperium can do about it. Mega-corporations and the largest
sector-wide companies constitutes another kind of multi-system sovereignty.
        IMPERIAL WORLD LEADERS: The principle of having two different kinds
of leaders, system leaders and Imperial nobles, frequently runs afoul of the
pride and ambition of powerful world leaders, especially if they are
hereditary rulers. It often becomes a political necessity to appoint them
Imperial nobles. Thus the Matriarch of Mora is both the head of the Moran
government and the Duchess of Mora Subsector. The reverse can also happen.
An unscrupulous Imperial noble assigned to a young, developing world is in a
very good position to acquire title to vast tracts of land. In some cases he
can end up owning, or at least running, the whole world.
	IMPERIALLY OWNED WORLDS: Over the years the Imperium have acquired
outright ownership of a lot of real estate including a number of whole
worlds. When that is the case, the noble assigned to it controls both its
internal and its Imperial affairs.
        
Imperial nobles have two different kinds of fiefs. One is a personal fief
granted to him in order to provide him with a secure income. Money
derived from personal fiefs goes into the noble\'s private accounts and are
theoretically his to spend as he wants (in practice nobles with really
big personal incomes may be expected to contribute some of that wealth
for various semi-official purposes). This kind of fief is sometimes also
called an estate (an Imperial estate to distinguish it from a personal
estate which the noble owns in his own right). The size and value of an
Imperial estate can vary tremendously. Not only may the Emperor give purely
symbolic estates to nobles who are rich in their own right and substantial
estates to others who are less well endowed, but a relatively poor estate
granted centuries earlier may have grown in value over the years.

The other kind of fief is the kind described in the first paragraph of this
article, the power to collect and administer (or in the case of lesser nobles,
to collect and pass on to higher authorities) Imperial taxes. This is also
sometimes called a charge.

It is usually said that each Imperial world has a marquis associated with it.
This is true if the world is of reasonably high tech level and has a
population level of 7 or 8. The Imperial taxes from such a world comes to
something between MCr1000 and MCr100,000. Any world with taxes less than
MCr1000 will propably only rate a baron. A world with taxes higher than
MCr100,000 rates a count. Some worlds are too small to rate even a baron.
Such worlds are usually part of a neighboring fief.

Traveller\'s Battledress is a suit of powered armour, ala Heinlein\'s
_Starship Troopers_ or Haldeman\'s _Forever War_.  Man sized, with human
limbs going into the suit\'s limbs.

Mecha are the traditional anime.magna giant combat robots.  Best examples
are Battletech\'s Mechs and Robotech.

As an aside, even though I find the concept of 10 meter tall humanoid
combat mechs utterly ridiculous, the Battletech novels from FASA are great
reading.  Mike Stackpole has written several excellent series focusing on
the leaders of the Inner Sphere over a fifty year period.  Find the 10th
Anniversary printing of the _Warrior_ Trilogy for a good read.

In really intense situations the empty mags go into the right cargo pocket
of my BDUs.  I may not have time to look down and fiddle with the ammo pouch.

If I\'m in exceedingly deep kimchee, just let the mag drop.  Reloading is a

You missed a few:

Excelsior was the ship doing the gas giant cartography, yet suddenly it\'s
the Enterprise that has the specialized equipment to detect gasses?

They don\'t do this normally?  Might be a good idea to detect these things
from time to time.

The only person on the bridge crew who thinks of this is Uhura, the commo
officer.  And she uses a reference to internal combustion engines to make
her point!

Out of a crew of over 400, the two most qualified to reprogram a torpedo
are the ship\'s science and medical officers?  I guess the gunnery crews
were on their coffee breaks...

I always assumed it was sturdy enough to handle minor course corrections
without a problem.  The hot setup to me always appeared to be, you manuver the
ship to where you wanted it, parked it in orbit, *then* deployed the canopy.

Unfortunately, the Challenger (r.i.p.) brought this point home to a
number of people (but not enough). Even after the Challenger disaster,
few people are aware of the existence of a Range Officer who\'s sole
purpose during launch is to destroy the launching vehicle (and any crew)
in mid-air should it appear the vehicle would go down over land. I\'ve
heard the Kennedy\'s Range Officer makes it a point to meet with all the
members of a launching crew. An urban myth, perhaps, but still sobering.

The problem with missiles is that they\'re quite heavy and expensive per shot.  A
grenade launcher is quite possibly more effective here; you can build nice
lightweight 60mm electromagnetic grenade launchers which will toast BD as
well.

Prep time really isn\'t that bad, because you don\'t actually need the rock --
just use the T-plate as your weapon.  If you take a 10 (static) ton 10-G
T-plate missile and fire it from an AU at a planet, it takes about 15 hours
to arrive, is moving at 1.8% of lightspeed, and has a kinetic energy of
.5*10^17 joules (about 35 megatons).  Of course, since you can just put a
nuke with considerably higher power on that missile (minimum weight for
nuclear weapons is a bit over 10 kilograms per megaton) it isn\'t worth doing
if you don\'t fire from 10 AU or so, and it provides so much warning that it
can be conveniently shot down by planetary defenses.

I\'m going to attempt to put the lid on this thing now, because otherwise
you will all attempt to strangle me.

Yes, you can make credible arguments why "great powers", who heed some
sort of Rules of War for the reasons you outline, would voluntarily
refrain from using weapons of mass destruction like near-c rocks and
biological agents.  The analogy is to the avoidance of nuclear weapons use
during the Cold War. 

However, the reason near-c rocks are especially difficult to deal with is
that they are so ludicrously easy to create in Traveller (if you\'re using
t-plates, that is).  Anybody, down to and including a group of average PCs
with an average ship, can create a world-cracking weapon with nothing more
than a few months\' effort.  Even if the great powers don\'t use them,
terrorist groups (and estranged boyfriends and disgruntled x-boat workers)
will.

We\'ve been through this a zillion times, and unfortunately there\'s no way
(short of getting rid of t-plates) to explain the Traveller universe as
presented *not* having experienced numerous, well-known near-c rock
incidents.  It\'s one of those things (like the energy/momentum problems
underylying t-plates, which is in fact the root cause of this dilemma)
that you (the GM) simply need to handwave out of existence to make the
official Traveller universe work.  Conversely, you can either ban t-plates
(a la TNE) or accept near-c rocks, and get a notably different universe.

Trust me, there is *no way* to make t-plates and Imperial military history
as stated work consistently.  A handwaved ban on near-c rocks is the only
solution.

Missiles (guided) are expensive; rockets (unguided) are cheap. However, as 
you have previously pointed out, the combination of laminate and 
thermal-superconducting armor will reduce a (10) divisor to (2.5)., so HEAT 
warheads are not exceptionally effective.

Note that once you get CG, reentry heating is history; you can waft down
gentle as a snowflake.  Even for hot reentries, water landing might make a
lot of sense; as mentioned, it\'s safer (for both ship and city) than
coming in over land.  And a ship doing hot reentries is probably going to
have some sort of expendable (or at least frequently replaced) ablative
skin, like the current Shuttle, so longevity isn\'t a factor.

IIRC, Pournelle used water landings (is that an oxymoron?) as the normal
mode of operations in his Codominium books.

Under the Library Data I snagged this:

Bakarov-Turner Hyperdrive

Also referred to in slang as the "jump drive" the Bakarov-Turner Hyperdrive
is the device which allows starships to cross interstellar distances
in reasonable amounts of time. The drive works, in simplistic terms, by
focusing phenomenal amounts of energy from semi-controlled fusion
reactions through a carefully aligned matrix of fero-metalic crystals to
produce a tachyon stream. When two tachyon streams collide, they
overwhelm the ability of the fabric of space-time to maintain the itegrity
of its normal curvature. A "rift-fold" opens at that point of
breakdown.

By manipulating the exact duration and quantum levels of energy, the
rift-fold in space can be manipulated to "touch" another point in space.
The starship "falls" into the rift-fold and after an average of 168 standard
hours "drops" back into normal space. Note that the time to "jump"
from one point in space to another is roughly constant, regardless of the
actual distance travelled.

Another issue of note is that the normal curvature of space-time is directly
affected by the tidal effects of gravity wells. Planets, stars and other
similarly massive objects increase the existing rate of curvature
dramatically within thier proximity. This in turn requires higher and higher
levels of energy to create and stabilize the rift-fold. At less than 100
diameters of the object, the amount of energy required is almost doubled,
which directly affects the life and stablity of the rift-fold. At less than
10 diameters of the object, the amount of energy required essentially
makes managing the creation of the rift-fold impossible.

If the rift-fold does not open or close under the control of the
Bakarov-Turner Hyperdrive, what results is called a Fold-Implosion. This is
usually fatal to the starship.

  Well, a disk 1 km in diameter is about 78% the size, but on reflection my
  numbers for solar radiation in the habitable zone are probably low.  I\'m
  going to stick with 1 GW at 100% efficiency for the sake of discussion,
  although you\'ll see that a decent case can be made for half that.

  Note that a 1 km diameter black globe is effectively a 100% efficiency
  solar collector.

  In High Guard terms this is equivalent to a 4 EP power plant at most, 
  which is only a PowerPlant-0.5 for the 800-ton Annic Nova.  No fuel
  required, though.

2) Using jump fuel tonnage in a High Guard power plant.

  A 800-ton ship capable of jump-5 carries 400 tons of jump fuel.  If a
  normal High Guard power plant converts all this fuel to power, it would
  generate 400 EP for a month.  Traditionally, 1 EP == 250 MW, so 400 EP
  would be 100 GW, which for a month is 259200 terajoules of energy.

3) Jump capacitor storage, standard, High Guard.

  A jump-2 and a jump-3 drive in an 800-ton ship contain 28 tons of 
  capacitors if both have them, 16 tons if both share the jump-3 unit\'s
  capacitors (assuming 50% of jump drive is capacitors).  One ton of a
  capacitor can accept the equivalent of 36 EP of power for one turn;
  that\'s 9000 MW for 20 minutes, or exactly 10.8 terajoules per ton
  of capacitor.

  28 tons of capacitor then holds 302.4 terajoules of energy; 16 tons 
  holds 172.8 terajoules of energy.

4) Power plant to generate 300 TJ of energy.

  Okay.  Number 1 and 3 are in the same ballpark; let\'s pick the smaller
  and say we need 300 terajoules to initiate a jump-2 and jump-3.  If we
  need to generate that in two turns, that requires a 125 GW power plant
  to charge it (500 EP, at tech-15 500 tons and MCr 1500).

  If we need to generate that much power in a week, then it\'s more like
  a 500 MW power plant (2 EP, at tech-15 2 tons and MCr 6).  This makes
  sense; 300 GJ is half the 600 GJ number we got from the 1 GW (4 EP) 
  solar collector in number one.

It\'s clear that the jump drive is much less efficient at turning LHyd
into energy than the fusion power plant; but a power plant which can 
generate that much power that fast is much bigger than the jump drive.

If it takes 300 terajoules to initiate a jump-5, then it probably takes
60 terajoules to initiate a jump-1.  For a LHyd powered ship, there\'s
also going to be a lot of unfused hydrogen and fusion products floating 
around somewhere.

Exactly.  Furthermore, the Imperium clearly has the other two pieces of
the Annic Nova puzzle; perfectly efficient solar collectors (the black
globe) and long-term accumulators (black globe capacitors).  Note the
implication here -- if the Imperium had the Nova\'s no-jump-fuel-needed
jump drive technology, then BG-equipped warships could refuel just by
turning on the globe!  The downside is that they couldn\'t refuel quite
so fast....

The typical scheme used in European (and European-derived) navies is to
establish a pattern for each major ship design, and name all ships within
that design series according to the pattern.  Thus, for example, in the US
Navy boomers (SSBNs) are named after states, nuclear attack subs after
cities, one set of CVNs after great military leaders, and so forth.  The
pattern isn\'t always followed rigidly; a ship can be specially named to
commemorate some person or event, and such \'breaks\' can make for
interesting backstory.  Or a subset of a design might follow a different
pattern.

It appears that the Impies follow the general pattern above.  The
Lightning class frontier cruisers are instructive in this regard; this is
the only standard line vessel for which we have a complete listing of the
series in canon.  Here, two primary naming conventions were followed.  The
\'type ship\' -- first constructed -- was \'Azhanti High Lightning\',
combining a minor race name with \'High Lightning\' for reasons best known
to the Admiralty. :)  The next several ships were also named on the
\'<Imperial minor race> High Lightning\' template.

Then the series naming scheme got changed, for whatever reason, and the
remainder of the ships were named apparently by an input-starved and
rather primitive AI. :P  The names all sounded vaguely heroic or poetic,
but made little or no sense...\'Grinding Starbow\' being my personal
favorite.

One ship in the series was renamed during construction to \'Children of the
March\', as it was (supposedly) financed by contributions from the
schoolkids of the Spinward Marches.

It does appear that the IN has a strong Solomani bent; perhaps it\'s still
dominated by Solomani culture after all these millennia.  The canon names
for IN ships have a strong Terran flavor more often than one would think
likely, though of course there are plenty of Vilani names (e.g., Kinunir)
used as well.

> Meanwhile, the Zhos and Sword
> Worlders would have their own naming conventions.  (I would assume that

If you consider \'all\' to be a valid synonym for \'most\', yes. :)  Sword
Worlders would probably tend to name their ships in the heroic/operatic
vein...I\'d have ships like \'Siegfried\' and \'Gotterdammerung\' and \'Glory\'
and \'Invincible\' and so forth, along with names of heroic leaders and
warriors from Sword Worlds history.

The Zhodhani are a tough call.  My leaning would be that they would use
the ship\'s class name plus a sequence number for official purposes --
\'Zhdant 1227\' -- but that crews would nickname their ships as they saw
fit, and such nicknames would be used for all but official purposes.  This
is just my guess, of course.

> This doesn\'t even begin to discuss ship names for the various
> non-humaniti races....

For inspiration, check out the \'Culture\' novels of Iain Banks (e.g.,
_Consider Phlebas_, _Use of Weapons_).  His ships are self-aware mobile
hyperintelligent AIs with droll senses of humor, who name themselves
things like \'Ultimate Ship II\' and \'Gunboat Diplomat\'.  My personal
favorite is a moon-sized vessel with a crew numbering in the millions and
almost godlike capabilities named \'So Much for Subtlety\'. :)

Nah, this debate predates GT by quite a bit.  That 400 tons of fuel is potentially 2-3 tons of energy, or about 2e+20 joules, if fused efficiently.  Since there\'s nothing really preventing recapturing most unused fusion fuel, it should probably be at least half this much energy, so call it 1e+20 joules over 2.6e+6 seconds, or about 4e+13 watts, which means 1 EP is around 1e+11 watts (100 gigawatts).

On a serious note, a lot of the hot topics don\'t have full information on

So when can we expect a Sunbeard declaration on the state of Eris\' furriness?

Maybe the architect was a Solomani who was homesick!
Earlier, a spokesperson for Auritech Shipyards asked:
>How do y\'all come up with names for warships?
IMTU:
I doubt seriously that the 3I would use to many names of old terran wet
navy ships that belonged to a single nation-state with so many trillions
of people probably not having any knowledge of what those ships were or
did. Lets face it, can you name the top 10 ships in any wet navies of
the Meditaeraen nation-states around 200 bc. Oh some ship names will
survive, what I\'ll call "idea" names, like Invincble, Illustrious,
Formidable, Enterprise, Resolution, Discovery, Endeavour, etc. As for as
place names, you have 11,000 worlds in the 3I to draw from, as well as
Sector names, Star names and so on.

>(Auritech) However, I would expect the Imperial Navy to have ships with
names of
>Vilani (and various minor race) origins.

Definetly! IMTU at least 40% of IN ship names are Vilani.
Now IMTU the Solomani Confed. Navy would probably dig up all those old
historical ship names(Scharnhorst, Prinz Eugen, Richellieu, Sovremney,
etc. You\'ll get alot of political names too(Solomani Destiny, Manifest
Destiny, the Party Congress, and so on).
For Vargr names, anything goes; I like to look up punk rock groups on
Yahoo for inspiration there. I dunno about Zhodani or Hiver ships, I\'d
love to hear ideas there. K\'Kree ships are easy; just call em TARGET
ONE, TARGET TWO, etc. (and pass the steak sauce!)

There is one stipulation I have strictly adhered to since January 28,
1986 on ship naming conventions:
Out of respect, no one in my group is allowed to use the name
Challenger.

IIRC there is a small section on starship names in the Starship
Operators Manual which may or may not be of interest.

The problem with grenade launchers (and most ballistic weapons) is the
launch point can be discovered using counter battery radar.

As compared to the ease of locating a person firing a fusion gun (oh look, a brilliant streak of fire going from that gun to that explosion over there) that\'s hardly a severe impediment.  Almost the only weapons that are hard to track back to the firing weapon are meson guns and drone missiles, neither of which are probably the most common anti-suit weapons (though actually, a 10 lb drone missile can do a _fine_ job of turning a battlesuit to scrap, assuming it can detect the suit).

I think you folks are arguing definitions.

What the original poster seemed to mean by "task system" was an easy way to
define relative task difficulty. How does pulling a splinter compare to
pulling tonsils?

What the second chap is describing is, for want of a better term, a "skill
learning system" which is an easy way to determine how hard it is to learn
skills (relative to each other).


The first system (a task system, in Traveller terminology) is used during a
game. The second is used during character generation. Both are useful.
Traveller has the first. GURPS has the second. Now if someone could convert
the MT/TNE/T4 task difficulties to some easy-to-remember type of GURPS
skill roll mod, then GT could have both.

Try diggiung thru the archives for one of my posts about the NERVA
engines that were actually *produced*. They got as far as testing
"flight configured" engines on the ground. 

I\'m not sure where the article is, so I can\'t post it right now. But as
I recall, they had a hell of a lot better performance (at TL6-7) than
this TL9 rocket does.

Actually, the Shuttle does *not* have an ablative skin. Just one that
can withstand high temps *and* is a superb insulator, so that the heat
doesn\'t leak inward and fry the crew. 

The ablative stuff was in the "heat shields" that the Mercury, Gemini,
and Apollo capsules used. As well as a lot of other "one shot" recovery
systems.

Interesting data point. The Chinese use *oak* for such disposable heat
shields.

Given that his "shuttles" came down *under power*, and had fusion
power, this is reasonable.

The Delta-X has shown that "tail sitter" landings are quite workable as
well. And they take up a lot less real estate.

My take is to ignore the stupid "thrusters" and go with reaction
drives. That makes near-c rocks *expensive*.

For that matter, even *with* thrusters, it takes a damned *big* rock
going really, really fast to be much worse than a nuke, or a redirected
asteroid. 

Just consider how *long* you have to push that rock to get it up to
even 1% of c.

Actually, the difference should be "does it use force feedback control,
or do you \'drive\' it."

You can "wear" powered armor that\'s big enough to hold you inside the
body. The "harness" you wear sends signals to the suit\'s limbs and
provides feedback from those limbs. 

And frankly, there\'s *no* way to do this for a size range from slightly
bigger than human to the size where the operator can be contained
entierly in the body.

That\'s because his body will have to bend in places the suit doesn\'t,
and vice versa.

You can scale BD up to the point where the operator is completely
inside the body. Then the BD can cover goround faster, because you no
longer need to have the joints bend where the operator does. You can
get 12 foot long legs, and let the operator move them as if they were
normal sized. That along will increase his speed quite a bit.

He\'ll need some practice, because the arms and legs will resist a bit
differently than his real ones do. That is, their "natural" movements
will be a bit different. Probably be a lot like being unarmored on a
low gee planet. 

The more I think about it, the less I think that a mansized suit of
powered armor is possible/practical. To get the joints in the right
places, you\'ll have to shorten the arms and legs relative to the
thickness they have to have for the armor, and the sensor effector
setup. The result would be *really* clumsy. 

And if you scale them up so the operator fits in the body, you get 9-12
foot "troopers" who stick out like a sore thumb. <sigh>

What\'s wrong with using fission reactors? By GTL8, they ought to be
able to do lots better than NERVA. So you wind up with a fission
powered rocket that can easily do single-stage to orbit carrying a
decent cargo. The engine uses LH2, just like the jump drive. 

Sure, it\'ll spend more time in system, because it\'ll need to save fuel
by boosting to escape velocity and then coasting util it hits the jump
limit. Likewise after exiting jump, it\'d boost into a transfer orbit
and then coast until it was time to either match orbits with a highport
or start an entry (not "re-entry" :-) burn for landing on the planet.

Unfortunately, it has other consequences if you want anything resembling a traveller feel for how people move about.  It replaces the \'near-C rock\' problem with the \'toasting cities with my rockets\' problem.  As I recall, HEPlaR thrusters have an exhaust velocity of 13% of c, and a power output of about 4 MW/newton.

3.5 days / Gs.  There is, incidentally, no point to a rock beyond shielding.  An engine without an attached rock becomes more dangerous faster than an engine attached to a big rock.

Hm...no, mansized power armor should be viable as long as you keep it quite small.  Doubling the volume of a human would not be crippling in terms of agility, though it would take some practice to deal with properly.

This world has a mixed methane, CO2 and nitrogen atmosphere,
41% surface water and a \'cold\' climate (the water must be frozen, very
salty/gassy or an ammonia-water eutectic mixture). The 1500 mile
diameter given must be 15000 (to permit atmospheric methane in largish
amounts).

* Otarri : Faldor/District 268 1131 E5936A7-2
A smallish world with a low hydrographic percentage. Despite this it has
"fishmen" natives. Perhaps the world has been slowly drying out (altered
output of primary star/greenhouse effect) ; or plate tectonics is
starting to slow down, and water recycling is beginning to fail.

* Saurians : Saurus/Vilis 1320  D888588-7
Fauna and flora is apparently similar to Cretaceous Era Earth.
The Saurians appear to be pretty dumb. Perhaps the Yilane (from Harry
Harrison\'s \'Eden\' trilogy) are hiding in the jungles somewhere, or the
big carnosaurs (or indeed the Saurians themselves) are just pretending.
(There was a cool thread on clever dinosaurs escaping Earth\'s
dino-killer by space travel on the TML last year).

* Shriekers : 567-908/District 268 1031 E532000-8
With the climate and hydro data provided, 567-908 is somewhat similar to
what Earth will be like in Sol\'s early cooling phase (prior to red giant
transformation).

* Tashaki : Retinae/Querion 0416 E8C69AA-5
Oxygen is present, so there must be oxygen producing life. The
silicon based Tashaki and other critters are probably solid state (too
hot for HF solvent, unless their \'skins\' enable pressurisation) and
partial ergovores (dependent on high background radiation).
	The abundance of radioactives must be of interest to planetary
geologists (and quite possibly to mining groups). The Tashaki are highly
interesting in their own right.

* Ursty : Yurst/Regina 2309  E7B4643-5
Given the chlorine taint, the Ursty are more likely to be chlorine
breathing (it is about 30-50X more soluble in water than oxygen).
	Since oxygen is also present in the atmosphere, this world could be
very interesting, with two biospheres developing in parallel - an
aquatic chlorine breathing one, and a land based oxygen breathing one.
(The \'Deep Green\' phylogeny project suggests that green plants on Earth
developed in fresh water, rather than salt as previously thought ; so
perhaps Yurst\'s life evolved in an even more radical manner). 
	Since the Ursty have attained TTL 5, their solutions to \'life in the
presence of poisonous oxygen\' would be worth studying and trading for.
	The drying out taking place on Faldor may also be happening here.

* Tethmari : Gyomar/Chronor 0108 D8B2889-5
The problem with Gyomar as written is that the average surface
temperature is below the melting point of ammonia, which is supposed to
form the world\'s 20% \'hydrographic coverage\'.
	Life\'s development is even more unlikely in the face of "tremendous
atmospheric pressure" which would make the ammonia even harder to melt
(would offset the freezing point depression effect of a reasonable
amount of dissolved stuff).
	Warm the planet a climate category to fix things. 
	Optionally, all life could be homeothermic (above the melting point of
ammonia) and primary producers rely on geothermal energy ; or, the world
could be in the grip of a catastrophic cold snap, and the ecology is
dying - but there are too many Tethmari at too low a TTL to easily fit
such a scenario.
	
* Viji : Zeta 2/Vilis 0919 X6B0000-0
I posted some stuff on this earlier. Not being able to track down a
description of H. Beam Piper\'s \'Niflheim\' (which Leonard suggested as a
reference for a high fluorine world), I\'d suggest changing the word
\'fluorine\' to \'sulphur\' in the descriptions of the world and the Viji.
	This has the advantages of simplicity and greatly enhanced
plausibility.

It wasn\'t meant to be a trick question. I just figured that since the
kinetic energy from an atmosphere\'s molecules impacting the BG can charge
the capacitors that a combination of stellar wind and radiation from a star
will also be converted to energy upon impacting the BG. I wanted to know
where canon stood on this.

It doesn\'t have the MT (or TNE) task system, but then it isn\'t
MT (or TNE).  People need to accept that.  It most certainly
does have a task system.

Which is what mostly rpg circles would call a tasks system.

The difficulty level in MT did just that, it changed the target number
(simple, 3+, routine 7+, etc.)

The only difference is that the DM aren\'t given desciptive names
like "easy", "routine", etc.  This is easily fixed but is generaly
unimportant to everyone I\'ve ever met.

This isn\'t an issue of how tasks are handled, but simply how many
times the book tells you how hard it is to do something.  MT gives
you a limited number of things a player might do and how hard they
are to do, GT gives you a limited number of things a player might
do and what the modifier is.  In both cases a GM is expected to
handle those inevitable situations where the rule book didn\'t
cover something.

Ah, yes.  "A Simple Desultory Philippic", IIRC (showing my age, I know).

For the curious, the lyric in question goes:

"... I\'ve been Ayn Randed, nearly branded
A communist \'cause I\'m left-handed
That\'s the hand I use...well, never mind."

ObTrav:  Given the mention of Ayn Rand in the above-quoted lyric, what
would be the most accurate description of a government based on
Objectivist principles?

Last time this came up, one solution was to have an upper limit on the
speed of T-plates, the handwave being something to do with the \'plates

That wasn\'t a "bad" solution, as solutions go...

At GTL12, it should be possible to put some fairly useful smarts into a
grenade at fairly low cost.  In GT, you probably need David Pulver\'s
expanded weapon rules to do this.  If the grenade is designed as a
Cannon-Launcher Guided projectile with passive millimeter-wave homing, it
gets very accurate for not much money at all (Maybe a few hundred credits).

Thermal superconducting armor ought not have such an effect on a HEAT
round: HEAT penetration is primarily a kinetic effect, not a thermal one. 
It\'s a design error in GURPS:Vehicles rather than GT, but one that should
be errattaed.

At TL12+, any battlefield weapon can be detected.  It\'s possible to track
bullets in near-real-time right now; this should be commonplace by the 53rd
century.  Energy weapons are probably worse; fusing guns will have
signatures light a trip flare, and even x-ray lasers are going to be
detectable by the heat trace of the beam through the air.  

The question is whether it matters.  Battledress is the ultimate in
shoot-and-scoot operations.  Troopers are going to have to be rigorously
drilled to fire and move, fast.

My GTL8 starships did. The problem with GVII/GT is that the weight generally
exceeds the thrust generated by thruster plates at GTL8.

I looked at that, GVII is a nightmare to design reaction rockets. The quick and
dirty method for a Traveller starship is CG. If you want to have reaction
thrust, there are a few GVII engine types.

Which is the best reason for reaction drives in traveller. Book Keeping is a

From what I\'ve read, such things do exist for specialty applications. 
However, there are several limiting factors (these apply primarily to
handguns):

1.  The mass of the weapon equipped with the high-capacity magazine.  As
one adds ammo, one adds weight.  Eventually (especially with sidearms),
one reaches a point where the weapon is simply too heavy to handle
easily.

2.  The bulk of the high-capacity magazine.  For instance, let\'s suppose
that a 15-round magazine for the M9 9mm pistol is 12 cm, all of which is
contained within the pistol grip.  Adding 15 rounds, while keeping the
pistol grip the same, will add 11-12 cm to the length of the magazine,
all of which will be sticking out of the pistol grip.  At some point,
this would become unwieldly, especially when trying to draw the weapon
from the holster.

3.  The circumference of the pistol grip.  One way to ease the problems
of point #2 above is to increase the circumference (and thus the
internal volume per cm of length) of the pistol grip.  However, this
quickly hits the limit of the average human\'s grip (assuming that the
weapon is intended for human use).

As a rule of thumb, I\'d say that you can increase the magazine capacity
by about 25-30 percent, without presenting too much of a problem, and
without modifying the pistol grip.

With rifles, a magazine much longer than the M16\'s 30-round magazine
will begin to interfere with one\'s ability to fire the weapon while
prone.  I\'d say, as a quick-and-dirty guess, that an M16 magazine could
be lengthened to allow for about 50 rounds of 5.56mm ammo, without
interfering too much with the ability to fire in the prone position.

In either case, a weapon gearhead could find the absolute smallest round
capable of inflicting a given damage factor, and design a weapon to fire
it.  This would increase the number of rounds per cm^3 of magazine.  (Of
course, such a custom weapon, and its ammo, would be rather expensive,
but what price peace of mind?)

        That is my experience.  Amongst other games I play, I am a fencer.
I also dabble in a MA that sims Middle Ages English broadsword and sheild
fighting.  I am "supposed" to be right handed.  I play raquet ball and fence
right handed.  I pitch softball and swing sword left handed.  I write with
my right, and heft with my left.  I call it adaptive ambidexterity....

  I assumed that it was learned (from examples) behaviour - I\'m left-

everything else (including batting & long-arms). I don\'t know what the

As HEPlaR has roughly the exhaust velocity as if it were achieving 100% efficiency fusion on it\'s power input, and does it even faster than the 30-day time, I\'m not sure if I call it a \'graceful\' option.  More like replacing one handwave with another.

Note: I\'m not a firearms expert... but I am a gun-toting firearms
enthusiast....

Past a certain size, clip design has to change to maintain action. This
varies by weapon, clip design, and sometimes even casing material of the
round.

ForEx: The m1911 .45 Cal ACP, standard load 7 round clip. You can put 7
rounds in, and expect enough pressure to feed the 7th, and not too much to
feed the 1st. Switch to the commercial 11 round "Extended Mag" for the same
gun... On less expensive ones, they are really 10 round clips, as with 11
rounds they often either don\'t feed the 11th round (not enough pressure),
or won\'t release the 1st of 11 (Too much). You have to design the clip\'s
spring such that with 11 rounds it doesn\'t overpressure, and on round 11
still gets enough to feed, and yet can hold that tension for a duration.

The Thompson SMG likewise has feed problems with odd clips...20 round
sticks were common enough, and 30 round sticks were available... but past
there, you switched to drum or (with enough modifications) other feeds...
simply because the coils springs of the drum provide a more even feed
pressure, and are more easily wielded than 40 or 50 round "Sticks". (By
stick, it refers to a stright clip). Note also that the Thompson fires the
same round as the m1911, but uses different clips... the thompson clip,
IIRC is straight, while the .45ACP slants.

In theory, you can built a drum mag for almost anything... reliability may
be an issue.

Oh, and the 30 round clips for the M16 also have a reccomendation of not
carrying more than 25 in them... so as not to compress the spring too much
for too long.

Also of note: many military weapon ammo sometimes ships on stripper clips,
for stripping into detachable magazines, rather than for feeding internals.
It was really a pain to reload M-16 clips from strippers, since the number
of rounds per stripper clip was different than the load we were ordered to
put per clip... in fact we were putting some 2 2/3 stripper clips into each
fireable clip....

For caseless weapons, the issue becomes quite different... most caseless
designs I\'ve seen use "Bricks"; if the weapon only takes a 200 round brick,
there is no place for more... (I\'ve never gotten a good close look at any
caseless weapons proper, only at specs...)

Actually, not too far from where I live, there was a tag that was spelled
incorrectly. Appended to the bottom of the tag was the message, "Damn, I
f\'ed up."

Still though, I must provide token dissent here, the great old school
graffiti that various artists did on the building tops off of the
Market-Frankford El has made more than one dreary morning trip to work more
pleasant. Living in a neighborhood that my friends have affectionately
dubbed "Old Detroit" (yes, a Robocop reference) I can\'t tell you how much
more attractive it is to see old abandoned rotting buildings with colorful
and well done grafitti as opposed to old abandoned rotting buildings
without.

The sad truth of the matter is that when you\'re from the places where
graffiti is prevalent here in Philadelphia, there\'s nobody there to offer
you a scholarship to the University of the Arts.

And just to be pedantic, there is no way to get rid of planetary bombardment
with quite-a-lot-less-than-c-but-still-damn-devastating rocks even if you
_do_ get rid of T-plates, it just becomes harder.

Refer Nivn & Pournelles "FootFall" for a belivable use of  small rocks in a
military assault.

Frankly, the Imperium as she is writ is completely "unbelievable" without
handwaves such as "Vilani conservtism", etc.

But so is Star Wars, and the World of Darkness, and believablility does not
neccessarily impact having fun.

Agreed.  And as cheap (in weight, volume and cost) as Contragrav 
is, there shouldn\'t be a reason it isn\'t installed on all vehicles by this 
TL.  Then, the only problem becomes trying to figure out how fast it 
goes ... not how much of the thrust you need to counter the weight 
and still move laterally.

Sorry, my AK\'s a bit shot out, so I\'m prejudiced.  I think it barely manages

Only in terms of mobility. An MI\'s suit wouldn\'t keep out any real 
firepower, afterall. Heinlein also make some rather optimistic 
assumptions about the value of a suit mobility when it comes to 
avoiding airpower, and seems to have assumed that only the MI carried 
homing missiles.

I fence either way, use a broad sword one-handed in my left hand, but 
use a broadsword or katana two-handed in the same way a right hander 
does. I also bat softball right handed, but pitch left handed. I\'ve 
come to the conclusion that this is the result of suffering under a 
fundamentalist who had a thing about leftys at primary school. He made 
every body bat in softball and cricket as a right hander. I suspect the 
only reason he didn\'t try to make us all write in our right hands was 
that the education department policy requires that children be allowed 
to develop as left handers if they wish.

Quite a while, depending on the G\'s you\'re willing to power. However as 
a secret weapon intended as a war stopper it maight be worth spending 
the time and effort to start a few rocks up in the outer system of your 
enemies capital system, and a few of his hi pop worlds. All very 
hypothetical of course, being as near-c rocks don\'t exist in the OTU.

Ah, but in the NZ army you\'re not supposed to do that \'cos they cost 
too much especially the plastic Steyr ones). They spend so long 
drilling soldiers into putting the mags back into the pouches that I 
suspect that when the cruch comes some of the younger troopies are 
going to get killed by spending too long following the drill.

AFIAK the last versions of the late G11 used a 50 round mag that could 
be topped up with 10 round \'bricks\', so at least you wouldn\'t have to 
wait until you were nerly out before topping up. It also carried 2(?) 
extra mags alongside the \'loaded\' one.

Bigger clips are harder to stow in pouches pockets, etc. High capacity 
mags also make the weapon more cumbersome. They are also unpopular with 
military brass and ordanance types because they encourage the 
consumption of more ammo by the troopies.

However for those that want them there are some nice 90-round magd 
available for the M16. They have a drum on each side, so they make the 
weapon wider rather than deeper. Those who want really large ammo 
supplies \'in-weapon\' should probably go for a belt fed machinegun, 
because that way you can just mash another belt on the end to your 
heart\'s content.

Star Trek has a canon? When did this happen? They have trouble staying
consistant from one episode to the next. 

Who remembers first season ST:TNG when they killed Tasha Yar and she showed
up in the next episode? According the the interviews I\'ve read, the
episodes were shown in the order they were filmed. So this little
continuity error slip right past them.

Actually, those are the *white* bricks. The black parts of the hull are
solid chunks of a very different material.

And the "bricks" can be touched at the corners, and edges, which cool
rapidly due to high surface area/volume. Try picking one up by the
*faces* and you\'ll need skin grafts.

Not really. The shuttle doesn\'t get very hot on launch. It gets hot on
landing because it *has* to use air friction to slow down. A ship that
can enter atmosphere under power can drop to a much slower velocity
before hitting atmosphere, and then "fly" down, without getting all
that hot.

But the sudden temp change *might*.

Fission weapons, or fusion weapons with fission triggers *can\'t* go
"boom" by accident. Getting them to go "boom" *at all* requires *rapid*
assembly of the subcritical masses into a critical mass. Both timing
and alignment are *critical*. If either is off, you just get a small
chemical blast with a small squirt of radiation. And a lot of
radioactive junk scattered over an area by the small blast. Maybe a
hundred yards.

We\'ve had several cases where nuclear weapons suffered catastrophic
damage, and only once did even the triggerring charges go off. The
safeties being physical chunks of metal blocking assembly of the
sub-crit masses made it impossible for fission to occur. They had to
sweep up the pieces and chip out some rock that had fissionables driven
into it. 

Also, while most fissionables have fairly long half-lives, it\'s
unlikely that they\'d be reliable after 50 years, much less centuries.
They\'d be too contaminated with decay products, many of which "poison"
fission reactions by absorbing neutrons. 

This is one of the reasons we used to conduct tests. We were checking
the reliability of weapons at various times after manufacture. We allso
have a regular schedule for "overhauls" which, after a certain period
consist of *replacing* the fissionables and sending the old ones back
for reprocessing. 

This could be a fun thing to do to some PCs. They find some intact
warheads that are centuries old, and unless they have the right
background or think to ask the computer the right questions, they may
be foolish enough to think the warheads are usable. 

More fun, if they send them in for maintenance, it\'ll be "obvious" to
the techs that these warheads haven\'t been near a maintenance facility
in *centuries*. Which may lead to questions the PCs don\'t want to answer.

Now we come to even more fun. Many (most?) larger warheads are
tritium-boosted. That is, the initial fission reaction is set up so
that a significant fraction of the neutron flux is redirected into a
mass of tritium. The pressures and neutron flux fuses the tritium,
releases *lots* of neutrons which can be used to boost the fission
that\'s already occuring *or* be used to trigger fission in a jacket of
something that normally won\'t fission, like U-238. This gives around a
10-100 time increase in yield.

A fission triggered fusion bomb uses the initial fission trigger, and a
*lot* of fusible material, usually lithium deuteride. This gives a bang
principally limited by how much fusible material you put in the bomb. 

And yes, that means that PCs too clever for thier own good could
use an old tanker, a det laser warhead, and a fuel purifier to build a
planet wrecker. Just use the purifier to fill the tanker with a mix of
deuterium & tritium (LD2 & LT2). And rig the warhead from the detlaser
inside a tank as the detonator. It\'d be a lot clumsier than a
conventional H-bomb, but the blast could rival a near-c rock. 

BTW, the US\'s first H-bomb usd liquid hydrogen. The Soviets skipped
that and went straight to lithium hyride, which the US also switched
to. Using liquid hydrogen just makes the bomb bulkier. 

Figure .1% conversion of matter to energy for however many thousands of
*tonnes* of hydrogen the tanker holds. Ouch.

Anyway, getting back to the derelict, the big danger would be when
water got into the warheads. Water acts as a moderator, by slowing down
neutrons. In practice, what that means is that if you take a big, but
subcritical mass of fissionable and dump it in the water, it\'ll be a
lot closer to being critical. Often enough closer to act like a *fast*
reactor. It won\'t go boom, but it\'ll pump out lots of heat and radiation.

For the warheads, this would go in stages. At first, no effect, as the
missile gets submerged. This is because they\'d be built with a fair
amount of "empty space" around the warhead, so that they won\'t be
affected by techs crowded around working on the missile body, or
loading it into a launcher. As far as the fissionables are concerned,
people are just mobile bags of water. More than one accident has
occured because a tech got between two or more sub-crit masses and had
his preseceense trigger a reaction.

Once water gets into the "carrier" you may get some increase in
activity. That\'s because the warhead itself (the charges and
fissionables) will be inside an airtight sphere inside the carrier. 

Once the space around the sphere is full of water, there will likely be
measurable amounts of fission going on in the warhead. It\'ll warm
slightly, and the neutron flux will make the container more susceptible
to corrosion. 

When water finally gets into the "cavity" containing the fissionables,
things will get interesting. The fision rate will climb rapidly, the
temp will increase, and the explosives may even go off. 

So it could be *real* fun removing the missiles if the "best guess"
says that they are just about due for that last stage. Bump one wrong
and the wekened metal could fail. 

Sure, the resulting blast from explosives and or radioactive steam
isn\'t nuclear. But it\'s enough to kill anybody nearby. And to cause the
contamination you were trying to prevent.

But it\'s highly unlikely that they *exclusively* breast feed. Not in

The info I\'ve encountered suggestion that the 99% figure is closer. But
*only* if that\'s how the kid is getting most of his food. 

In modern, "civilized" cultures, that rarely happens. And thanks to the
*idiots* marketing formula to third world countries, it rarely holds
there. Matter of fact the introduction of infant formula to third world
nations has *two* dramatic effects. First, it increases the frequency
of pregnancies, thus increasing the birth rate. Second,it increases the
infant mortality weight and frequency of infant malnutrition. That\'s
because it\'s so expensive that the mothers dilute it. 

ObTrav: Introducing "better" technology often *hurts* the cultures it\'s
introduced to.

For some reason, *this* time when I read your sig, my mind flashed on
one of the "Buck Godot" books. It has a couple of "characters" named
"Smith" and "Wesson". They are a pair of intelligent weapons (in much
the same sense as a D&D "intelligent sword"). They essentially control
the poor guy that carries them.

Those would be by *just* the weapons for someone to acquire (or is that
"be acquired by?" :-)

The trouble with counter-battery radar is that anti-radiation missiles
(HARMS) will blow it away.

And so goes the measure/counter-measure race.

It\'s fairly well known *why* the corridors in the origonal Star Trek
were so wide. They *had* to be, or the cameras didn\'t have room to
follow the actors.

My "in universe" justification for that sort of wide corridor is that
it\'s needed for "damage control". More properly, it\'s needed to let
them move equipment around the ship when the transporters are down. 

Given the way the "original" Enterprise seems to be organized, they
don\'t have the advantage of having all the "heavy equipment" either
centralized, or near the "surface" of the ship, unlike a typical
seagoing vessel.

We did this on purpose in our "Wing Commander meets Star Wars" Traveller
game,  where we played a squadron of pilot jocks on a Solomani fleet
carrier, doing things like flying up the spinal meson gun of the Imperial
ships to avoid the as much of the "AA" fire.

All players had to state that they ducked their head when they entered the
ward room, or they would bang it on the low hanging pipes.

The cheif engineeer would do hings like release steam from pipes whenever we
went to talk to him just so it looked like he was working hard, and then
turn of the steam when we\'d left.

It was a LARP,  and the only props we needed were black tshirts and a car to

Far too true.    2 gearheads, 2 rules rapists, and 2 game designers plus
a few others.  If I tryed a smaller group (ie subgroup) only 2 would
show for the game.  The MT task system stopped 90% of the turmoil and
allowed the game to progress, although there were heated arguements
after the game.

Wonderful for suppressive fire though - not only can you suppress the 
guy you\'re firing at, but his mate on the right, and his mate on the 
left as well :)

I belive that 6 MOA is considered not unreasonable for an AK. The 
M16A1s we had in basic were so shoot out that some regularly keyholed 
the targets, and most would do around 2 MOA. I got lucky - mine did 1.5 
MOA (mind you it was so worn that when firing the selector switch would 
sometimes bump round to full-auto).

I don\'t know whether the process is technically ablation or not, but for
whatever reason most (all?) of the shuttle\'s tiles get replaced after each
flight.  That was my point.

This was meant to apply to the "21st Century starports" topic, so the same
operating mode was assumed.

Yes, it\'s just a convienient way of carrying the belt around. The only 
problem is that the belt tends to make this annoying \'clunck, clunck\' 
noise against the box - not good when you\'re trying to sneak through 
the bush. We used to simply have a short belt (30 - 50 rnds) on the 
gun, and carry lots of 200 rnd belts in pouches and under our jackets 
(so they wouldn\'t give our position away by shining). When we were 
still using the M16s instead of the short belt we\'d have a M16 mag in 
the gun (the Minimi/C9/M249? will take M16 mags) for rapid response. 
Typical military logic that. They bought C9\'s partly because they could 
use M16 mags, and then went out and replaced the M16A1s with Steyer 
AUGs, which use a different plastic magazine.

You forgot one:  The lack of bacteria-free water with which to mix the

Sorry for drifting off-topic so quickly, but this anecdote reminds me of
a D&D filk I heard once:  "No-Ego Wood" (to the tune of "Norwegian
Wood").  The first lines went:

I once had a sword
Or should I say, it once had me

Does anyone here have the rest of the lyrics to this filk?

"High Velocity Planetary Bombardment Systems (HVPBS) ,  like Nuclear Warheads ,

the use of said weapons is barred as a first use weapon. The Imperium reserves
the right to respond in kind to any attacks used on its member worlds, but the
use of it as a first strike weapon will GARENTEE reponse from the Imperium"

"As per IO1109, and admended by IO2045, use of HVPBS must be authorised by the
Emporer or Archduke ON IMPERIAL STATIONARY. The Imperium that the use of HVPBS
is a political weapon, thus no Imperial Officer can initate use of this system.
The penalty is loss of all assets, up to and including his/her life."

"Informal discussions with the Zhodani during the conclusion of the First
Interstellar Wars agredd that both sides will informally acknolegde that HVPBS
will not be used by either side. Of all the Major races, only the Kree do not
pubicly renounce the use of HVPBS. However all Starfaring nations near the Kree
have advised the Kree that any use of the HVPBS will be met in kind, and it is
rumored that both the Solomani and Imperial forces have a class of ship based
near Kree space solely designed to accellerate projectiles. Of cause, both the
Solomani and Imperial Governments deny this".

The only person mad enough to use this would have to b Lucan, and maybe the
Solomani during the Black War period.

Yep, that\'s about the only credible fix.  Trouble is, "magic carpet"
m-drives are (at least for me) part of the \'feel\' of Traveller.

Well, you can trade off between how big and how fast.  Twice as fast
(well, the outcome of twice as much acceleration, allowing for relativity)
means the rock can be four times less massive for the same energy yield.

> even 1% of c. 

Roughly half a week at 1 g, a month at .1 g.  Not unreasonable for
t-plates.

IMTU, most of the ships are designed to make water landings, either
as an option or the primary method of landing.

The /Mae Lee/ which I\'ve talked about before, spent four years on
the bottom of a lake between the time it was "liberated" from the
Zeristu and the time Akus Moby raised it and sneaked it out of their
territory.  You know, I\'d like to write that story up as an
adventure one of these days. <g>

IMTU, BD has extensive fire control systems, allowing threat determination,

The dificalties will be based on the complexity of his/her computer systems, up

I was OK with posting the appropriate clip to the list, but as it is not my
campaign, I don\'t feel I have the authority to submit it to someone else\'s
site. I believe the author is on this list though. The Near Earth Campaign
is a wonderful site to visit if you haven\'t yet, thick with texture and
content. I have only browsed, but what I saw was great. I am still tweaking
my page, and someday the links, which will include one to TNEC, will be all
orderly, but Real Life(tm) has some of my time too.

That would be interesting to see.

Off the top of my head, this is it (from Niven\'s "Dream Park"):

     I once had a sword
     Or should I say, it once had me.
     I just picked it up,
     Oh what a sword, it was plus-3.
     Its ego was 12,
     A fact of which I wasn\'t aware.
     And when I tried to leave
     I found that the sword didn\'t care, oh!

     I walked through the halls
     Wasting my time, nothing to find.
     Then, I turned a corner
     And then I said, "Oh no - undead!"
     The thirty-two wights saw me coming
     And started to laugh.
     And I closed my eyes as my sword started hewing a path.

     And when I awoke,
     I was alone, that sword had flown.
     Now, I use a club,
     Isn\'t it good, no-ego wood!

I\'ve seen them depicted in a few low-budget movies ("I Come In Peace" was
one of them, IIRC).

The .22 LR version would be cool though, considering the extreme low cost
of such ammunition.  59 ounces fully loaded...

Here\'s a link showing the 9mm version (w/ 50 round magazine mounted
horizontally above the pistol grip).  As you can see, it is a *very* bulky
pistol.  The 100 round magazine would be twice as long.

Such pessimism. I wasn\'t around for the first (zillion - 3)
rounds so I don\'t know how near-c people were driving their
rocks, but back in August I applied a little calculus to the
definition of kinetic energy and posted (IMHO) a quite
respectable handwave.  It met with deafening silence then, but
here it is again.

The power rating for T-Plates is the maximum power used for
design purposes. Each drive has a V rating of (G-rating times 100
km/sec).  At velocities below this, T-plate drives have the rated
acceleration, but use less than maximum power.  At higher
velocities, they use the rated power, but acceleration drops off
to remain inversely proportional to the velocity. 
This means, for instance, if a 1-G ship is going less than 100
km/sec, its maximum acceleration is still 1 G, and it is not
operating at full power. On the other hand, a 2-G ship going at
1000 km/sec (5 times its V rating) at full power can produce a
maximum acceleration of 1/5 its G rating, or 0.4 G)

This amendment isn\'t overly complicated and it lets you have T-
Plates and conservation of energy, too. Going up to 1% c is
almost routine for 6-G ships, but it\'s a lot harder to go much
faster, or to do with slower ships. A rock with 6-G thrusters attached
needs about the width of the solar system and several months to get up to
about 5% c.

From the TNS dated 154-1124 commenting on an Ine Givar demonstration at
Rhylanor University:

"After chanting and handing out leaflets reading, "The Moment for Democrasy 
[sic] Is Now!" The demonstration disbanded peacefully."

So apparently, no they can\'t spell.

I\'m also right-handed, left-eyed.  No apparent reason for  it  in
my case, that\'s just the way I\'m wired.  What it means is that  I
am a completely crap shot with a rifle (kept closing my right eye
when squinting down the barrel held right handed, then missed  by
miles) yet I\'m significantly better than average with  a  handgun
held in 2-handed grip (or was until my  government  decided  that
"only evil people want to shoot handguns" and banned them 8-(  )

The baseball batting aspect is interesting:  I was crap at small-
ball games as well (cricket, baseball, etc).  Didn\'t occur to  me
to try left handed batting ... I\'ll experiment.

Here\'s the WBH vs GS/GC info you\'d requested earlier.  I finally dug it up
from my archives here at home.  Hope this helps in the development of your
latest and greatest!  :)

Keep up the great work,

Date: Thu, 31 Dec 1998 08:40:47 -0600 (CST)
From: "Jason Kemp" <Jason.Kemp@tdh.state.tx.us>
Subject: WBH vs GS/GC (long)

To all Scouts and World-Builders interested,

In the WorldBuilding thread, someone requested some information
comparing WBH and GS/GC.  In response to that request, I ran a quick
comparison of MT\'s WBH (World Builder\'s Handbook) vs CT\'s GS (Grand
Survey) and GC (Grand Census).  This is what I found out.

Most of the general material is very similar, although WBH changes
some of the wording and formats (sidebars, bulleted lists, outlines.)
 Beyond these general differences, I found the following:

The Donosev Survey Vessel is detailed under High Guard stats in GS 
and MT stats in WBH.  Also, some slight cosmetic differences in 
deckplans exist, but the layout remains the same.

As Extended System Generation is part of the normal MT system
generation procedures, all WBH utilize the Scouts formulas,
presented in a much more structured format using outlines.  GS and
GC offer Basic system generation alternatives.

Under Size-Related Details:

In determining Planet Density, WBH defines Heavy Core as a Core Type, 
achieved on a modified 1- on the Core Type Table.  The relavent 
densities for this type are (3d6):

3   1.10
4   1.15
5   1.20
6   1.25
7   1.30
8   1.35
9   1.40
10  1.45
11  1.50
12  1.55
13  1.60
14  1.70
15  1.80
16  1.90
17  2.00
18  2.25

Rotation Period:  To further define rotation periods expressed as 
days, WBH adds (1d6-3) X 4 hours, while GS adds 1d6 X 4 hours to the 
base rotation.

Seismic Stress Factor:  Heavy Core mods are 1d6-2.

WBH also adds the following under Size-Related Details that is not 
covered by GS:

*Gas giant UWP size generation, with a UWP table for both small (2d6) 
and large (3d6) gas giants.  These UWP size values enable primary 
calculations of mass from the density table, and satellite orbital 
period and rotation, for mainworlds that are satellites of gas giants 
in Habitable Zones.

*Asteroid/Planetoid Belt Profile generation (pg 61, WBH:  includes
Predominate Body Diameter, Max Body Diameter, Predominate Zone Type,
Zone Composition Tables, Belt Orbit Width and Belt Profile Notation)

Under Atmosphere-Related Details:

WBH determines Type F Atmosphere Surface Atm Pressure as a roll under 
the Thin column, minus 0.20 atm.  The referee just chooses one under 
GS.

WBH has a very easily utilized presentation of the Scouts Surface 
Temp calculations, and includes reference tables as needed.

WBH Resource information is slightly changed from GS:

*Heavy Core type has been added to the density sections of the 
Natural Resources and Processed Resources tables. 

*Terrain was removed from the Resource tables under WBH.  Density no 
longer effects Manufactured Resources under WBH.

*Under Natural Resources, Petrochemicals changed to Compounds.

*Under WBH, Processed Resources defines:  Agroproducts, Metals, 
Non-Metals.

*Under WBH, Manufactured Resources defines:  Parts, Durables, 
Consumables, Weapons.

*NEW to WBH:  Information Resources, which defines:  Recordings, 
Artforms, Software, Documents.

*Some DM differences between GS and WBH based on differences in 
Resource types between the two.  All of WBH Resource info is on pg 
71, WBH.

GC includes a means of determining the presence of a minor race on 
worlds with native evolved life.  (3d6: 17+, DM+3 if Pop 6+.  If a 
minor race is present, then it is a minor human race on a second 3d6 
roll of 15+)  WBH does not have a method to determine the presence 
of a minor race.

Under Technology Profile:

The Energy Lower Limit for WBH is High Common TL/2; under GC, it is 
Upper Limit - 5.

The Communication TL Base in WBH is Computer/Robotics TL; under GC, 
it is the lower of Computer/Robotics TL or Energy TL.

The Medical TL Base under WBH is the Computer TL; under GC, it is the 
High Common TL.

The Environmental TL Base for WBH is the High Common TL; while under 
GC, it is the Energy TL.

Under the generation of the Space Transport TL, GC states that if the 
starport type is X, then the TL=Space Transport Lower Limit.  WBH has 
no such indicator.

There were probably more differences, but that\'s all I could find on 
short notice.  I hope this helps out.

In Service,
Jason

Once tried to play 5FW (or FFW) round a friend\'s house ...  after
4 hours sorting out the counters and setting up it was time to go
home.  Now I just put the box on the shelf ...

Actually, 5FW is a source of background info (quick: name a Sword
Worlds admiral without referring to 5FW) ... I use  the  squadron
defense factor as a count of the number of capital ships present.

This one\'s on  my  list  of  things-to-do-which-I-never-do.  I\'ve
often thought of running 5FW as a PBeM.  The way I\'d want  to  do
it is have each admiral played by a different player (downside is
some players have to wait until late in the game before  becoming
involved) and replacing the planning  factor  with  proper  time-
delayed intelligence (only know what\'s in system  with  you  now,
and within 4 hexes a week ago).  Combat could be handled  with  a
comprehensive set of standing orders.

IMTU Strephon was smuggled  back  to  Capital  by  IRIS  and  was
recognised as the real emperor by the Moot (who were looking  for
a legitimate way to get rid of Lucan, as  were  the  IN  by  this
time).  Once back on the throne Strephon cancelled Lucan\'s  fleet
mobilisation orders to those factions under attack by  the  Vargr
or Solomani  and gave them amnesty in return  for  rejoining  the
3I.  Margret\'s  faction  also  rejoined.  Dulinor\'s  faction  now
faced a combination of growing internal dissent  (made  worse  by
the news of Strephon\'s return) and a fight against  a  united  3I
front.  Eventually the 3I is  restored,  however  not  without  a
price.  In recognising him the Moot removed some of the emperor\'s
powers in a sort of Magna Carta type document.

Then the "baddies from the core" pass through, just ahead of  the
Empress Wave!  The end.

Not at all surprising to anyone who\'s done any jewelry work. Charcoal blocks

	Incredibly enough, population biologists do think of such
	things.  The formulae that I was discussing describe the
	potential growth of a population, not the actual growth
	under any one particular set of conditions.  My posts were
	getting long enough without a long dissertation on the
	factors affecting the abundance of organisms.  As for
	the contribution of males, in many (probably most) species
	the male contributes little other than genes to the next
	generation.  In humans, males do contribute to their
	offspring, but that does not mean that women are helpless
	without men to feed them and their children.  I would 
	certainly expect that 9 women with 1 man could produce more
	children than 5 women with 5 men, unless the number of 
	children is restricted by something else.

I tend to disagree with this, if only for the Solomani.  Lucan was bent on 
revenge and denying planets and resources to his enemy, where the Solomani 
were seeking to reclaim territory.  I can see all factions setting a 
lifeboat or gig on a terminal course with military installations to try for 
the \'one shot stop\', but I can not see the Solomani dropping a rock on planets.

Rocking the K\'kree, hell, that should be a given.

Exactly!  The measuring system used (whether metric, Imperial, or
other) is part  of  the  "look-and-feel"  of  the  game  setting.
Fantasy RPGs *typically* use medievil European units ... feet and
inches, pounds and onces, leagues, etc.  (Many dungeons start off
"you are in a 10 foot by 10 foot room with a door  on  the  north
wall".)  Similarly,  since  metric  is  a  favourite   with   the
scientific community it sounds modern and thus is  common  in  SF
RPGs like Traveller.  (Standard corridors are  1.5  meters  wide,
and staterooms are 3 meters by 4.5 meters.)

However, while I think Traveller should use meters and kilograms,
don\'t forget that units like "displacement tons" are not metric!

No, if you want conservation of energy, you need to increase the power requirements from about 10 watts/newton (I think) to (thrust * velocity) watts/newton, or .1MW/newton for the 100 kps velocity suggested above.  Making this viable in turn would require appalling (4 orders of magnitude) increases in the power output of fusion plants.

Objection:  Velocity relative to what?  Absolute velocity is meaningless,
thanks to Uncle Albert.  If it\'s velocity relative to a nearby big mass
(the "grab and push" model), t-plates end up working unrecognizeably
differently from the canon description (though it does solve the runaway
energy problem, in much the same way HEPlaR does).  I get the sense this
latter is what you\'re suggesting.  If so, why not just bite the bullet and
go to HEPlaR instead?

Why is Heplar considered biting the bullet?  Is there a technical flaw in
heplar or is it just an unwillingness to give up thruster plates.

The problem is relativity - there is no \'stationary\' reference to measure
velocities relative to.  Yuor ship may me doing 1000km/sec in one reference
frame, but in another frame it may be stationary (ie You still get the full
2G accel.)!!

The capability now exists to trace the fire from an assault rifle back to 
it\'s source with a high degree of accuracy (even saw this on a show about 
military technology).

IIRC, the mile is derived from a Roman unit (milia passuum?) equal to 1,000
Roman paces (which were, in turn, equal to about 5 feet each). So I think
it\'s appropriate for a fantasy game, especially if it\'s Ars Magica. ;-)

Thanxx 1.0e6  I appreciate it.  Cynthia Higgenbottom came out with \'ssv\',
which works ok, except that it saves off in XWD format, which screws up the
colors pretty badly, *AND* makes a humoungous image file kinda like a Windoze
bitmap file.  Have to run it thru Convert & Xpaint to get anything rilly
useable.  I *suppose* it might be interesting to see if I can hack the
source a bit and see what I get; should teach me some stuff about C...

I think we are heading towards terminology differences here...

And what most RPG people I would know would call a \'skill roll\' or a

Please can you elaborate and state where in GURPS Basic there is defined a
common (ie across all skills and situations) set of TN modifiers which
relate to the difficulty of the task.  As far as I can see there is nothing
in GURPS Basic that presents a common set of modifiers based on difficult
of the test. As far as GURPS is concerned *unless* the GM decides on the
fly a modifier, or the description of the skill gives a modifer, there
would be nothing to differentiate between tests in two different
situations.

For example, using a vac suit to manuever across a brightly light room with
stable gravity against using a vac suit to manuever across a room with
fluctuating gravity and strobing lights. Both would have the same Target
Number on 3D6 using GURPS unless the GM improvised or found something in a
skill description or combat section to use.

No. There is no common system for rating difficulty or modifiers across all
task situations in GURPS Basic that I can see. This is important to a lot
of people I know.

\'Task\' based systems are games like: Traveller (not CT), Faded Suns, T2k,
James Bond, Cyberpunk 2020 etc which either have a different target to
achieve for different situations or a number of successes to achieve.

\'Skill roll\' based systems are games like CoC, CT, AD&D2nd, GURPS. These
modify a skill level or a target number dependent on the situation,
generally with no common structure between skills or situations. This is
very different to a task based system.

Cool, and while that radar is lighting up the grenade, we can fire a Harm

I\'ve done AHL, Imperium, Snapshot, Mayday, and Invasion Earth FTF...
likewise, it\'s been a while...

I used to use AHL/Striker with CT for damage and hit determinations... I
used a modification of the Striker/AHL table  converting from surplus pen
to dice of damage.

They\'d need some ignition source... IMTU, for an extra Cr 100, you can add

This is all true. But since it would be fairly easy to bolt a task system
onto GURPS, why is this such a big deal? Simply use standardized modifiers,
and go for it.

For example:

Simply assign a task a difficulty and apply the following modifier to skill:

Difficulty       DM
- ----
Simple ........  +6
Routine .......   0
Difficult .....  -6
Formidible .... -12
Impossible .... -18

Then make the normal GURPS skill roll.


Or you could do this:

Roll 3d6 + Skill + DMs v. Difficulty of Task. If the roll is equal to or
greater than the Difficulty rating, the task succeeds. If not, the task
fails.

Difficulty ratings (from MegaTraveller):

Difficulty   Rating
- ----
Simple ......... 16
Routine ........ 20
Difficult ...... 26
Formidable ..... 32
Impossible ..... 38

Then go on to make a simple list of what is simple, routine, difficult,
formidable, and impossible with each skill.

You\'ll have to reverse the critical results, of course (now rolls of 3, 4,
and 5 are bad, and rolls of 16, 17, and 18 are good). But it\'s really not
all that tough. Difficulty ratings are really only DMs in disguise, anyway.

Hah. I have the rebuttal... As amusing as Scott Adams can be, he
has always pandered to his audience.

Stammbach, Eduard. (1988). "Group responses to specially skilled
individuals in a Macaca fascicularis." Behaviour, 107 (December 1988),

Does the staggering wealth of particular engineers and programmers
mean that there is any chance for nerds to rise socially?
 
Stammbach worked with a colony of longtailed macaques. In the paper
cited above, the running header is "Responses to Specially Skilled
Java Monkeys." Stammbach took the lowest-ranking macaque out of the
society and taught him to operate a complex machine and obtain food.
When the trained monkey was reintroduced to the society, the higher
ranking macaques stopped kicking him out of the way long enough for
him to complete operation of the machine and obtain food for the
community. I.e., society cooperated to create the conditions under
which the nerd could toil for them. However, the monkey who acquired
these special skills and provided for the society did not achieve any
rise in his dominance status.

Poof. The globes work both ways you know. Just wait until the ship emits
enough waste heat from the crew, etc. Very environmentally friendly, recycling
energy that way you know.

The latter.  HEPlaR is unrealistically efficient -- above 100% depending
on how you model it -- but at least it acts like a physically consistent
drive system.  On the other hand, t-plates as written violate conservation
of energy, which is why you can use the \'free\' energy obtainable from them
to crack planets easily.  Any patch to t-plates that closes this loophole
ends up making them behave like HEPlaR, or worse.

However, an important part of the Traveller \'feel\' (IMHO, and excluding
TNE) is what I call the "magic carpet" model of normal-space ship
operations.  Moving around in a solar system basically consists of aiming
the nose where you\'re headed and thrusting, flipping over halfway, and
decelerating to the target.  Considerations of gravity, orbits, and so
forth disappear when you can thrust at 1 g or above for a month at a time.

Conversely, in the HEPlaR model one is constantly watching the fuel gauge,
and getting from A to B must be done in the JPL way (though hopefully
without help from LockMart), using a a few burns and a lot of coasting on
a transfer orbit.  Needless to say, this is both harder to model and takes
a lot more (in-game) time.

I\'d tone this down a bit:
Simple +4
Routine +0
Difficult -4
Formidable -8
Impossible -16

Note that a Formidable task can\'t succeed at skill-10 or less and an 
Impossible skill can\'t succeed at a skill-18 or less (effective skill would 
be 2, and your best roll is a 3).

I was using MT as a guide. Difficult tasks were 11+, Formidible tasks 15+,
and Impossible tasks 19+ (on 2d6). Impossible tasks were really impossible,
without big DMs.

I admit that I just threw it together as a demonstration piece. But if
anything, I thought I was being a little generous. ;-)

Well, maybe THAT explains why I\'m having trouble understanding your
point! I\'ve played all the games in your \'skill roll\' list and none in
the \'task\' list.

Hopefully this post will make clear what it is I don\'t get.

Compare the following:

  To make yourself understood on the net:
  Formidable, Liaison, 5 min (fateful, unskilled OK)
  [David rolls 6 on 2D, adds his Liaison-1 and compares with 15. Oops!]

and

  GM: "Roll against Diplomacy at -6."
  [John subtracts 6 from his Diplomacy-9 and compares with a 3D roll of 
   12. Rats!]
  GM: "There\'s a flamewar a-brewing..."

The only difference I can see is that MT has a convenient shorthand for
writing down the task definition. Since (like most non-combat tasks)
this probably wasn\'t defined in a supplement somewhere, that doesn\'t
seem a vital feature. The MT Referee probably thought something like "I
don\'t rate his chances - let\'s make it a Formidable task", while the
GURPS GM thought "wow, that\'s tricky - let\'s give him a -6".

What more general system can you have? Tasks don\'t generally match the
examples in the books, do they? If they don\'t, it\'s always going to come
down to GM fiat. Either you\'re choosing the task difficulty or the
modifier (and you can use a naming scheme if you want - remembering
\'formidable\' as a -6 modifier is no harder than remembering it as a 15
target number).

If tasks *did* generally match something in a long list laid down by the
game authors, I\'d ignore it - although GURPS lists modifiers for just
about everything to do with combat I can\'t be bothered to keep track of
it all, so I just wing it. But I admit that\'s just my personal style.

Sorry to waffle on. I\'m genuinely interested in the difference, I just
can\'t see it yet.

Regards,

John

It has happened, read "The Washing of the Spears", Queen Vicky\'s lads

I think the idea that Feudal technocracy is a more limited government type
than others is a result of misunderstanding what it means.  It\'s not
simply a feudal system (that\'s type 3: Self-perpetuating oligarchy, IIRC &
IMHO), nor is it necessarily government by "hi techs" of "lo techs".
Remember that "techonology" covers alot of ground.  Spears are technology,
writing is technology, and food preperation is too.  

IMO, ft was placed on the table as a bow to certain ancient asian cultures
which are often labelled as technocracies but which had a feudal element. 
In these cultures one could gain government positions by passing tests. 
Anyone could theoretically apply, down to the lowliest peasant, and the
person with the best "test score" got the position.  In this sense, an ft
is a government by those with know-how.  This can apply to a broad range
of things including the example just given as well as the TEDs of TNE,
certain forms of beaurocracy or corporate government and so on (yes these
overlap with other government types, but so do they all).  The Feudal part
is really just referring to a heirarchical system with allegiances running
up and down.

All IMHO,

I am an Australian. I see land  and want to either run sheep on it or rip it
open for mining. Apparently there is a huge tin deposit under St Mary\'s
cathedral in Sydney, I would not be supprised if the Catholic church gets
lobbied to allow mining under the most important catholic church in
Asutralia....

Well, lets see, someone behind partial cover is a -2 to hit.  Shooting
while on the move is -4 to hit.  Etc.  (there are as I recall as I
don\'t have Basic in from of me).

Exactly where is the difficulty to do this described in MT?

Yes there is.  Bad footing is a -2 to rolls across all task situations.
Just as is might be a "difficult" taskin MT.  The _only_ difference is the
table of verbal labels given to the labels.

    'body' => 'Here are a couple of possible solutions to the "Fermi paradox" of near-c
rocks ("where are they (in canon)?" :-).  I offer them up for your
nit-picking destruction...

1. Political reasons.  This has already been discussed and could explain a
relative _rarity_ of such incidents, but not a total absence.  Treaties,
Geneva conventions and the like could explain away regular use of killer
rocks, but we should still see them during the Long Night and in the Vargr
Extents.  I don\'t think it would damage canon much to say that a few such
incidences have occurred.  Perhaps their lack of mention is part of an
Imperial information suppression?

2. Practical reasons.  One thing I implement IMTU is _highly_ visible jump
flashes on entry combined with a randomization of vector on exit.  This
means you can\'t "jump in" your rock at near-c with any real chance of
hitting the target (you\'re at less than 1/million assuming you come in at
the 100 diameter limit). If you jump it in somewhere in the outer system
and accelerate it from there, you\'ll be seen far enough out for the locals
to launch counter measures.  You _can_ stop/deflect a near-c rock, you
just have to do it _really_ far out from the target.  Of course, there\'s
always some limit beyond which the locals won\'t be able to detect your
preparations, but when it takes a month or two for the rock to get there,
the weapon becomes less useful (your policies may have changed over the
course of that much time and all your effort will be wasted).

Between those two, I think it\'s not too much of a stretch to imagine a
Traveller universe relatively devoid of near-c rock attacks.  You _can_ do
it, but everyone will hate you, and anyway it\'s not _that_ easy to do.

Matter of fact the introduction of infant formula to third world nations has

The leftie community of Oz is particularly outraged at a certain corporation
for marketing formula to such countries due, in addition to above, to the
fact that it is often mixed with disease ridden water (RE dysentery) which
of course then infects the kiddies.

Ob RL: Big corporations will do anything to make a buck, even if it kills
their client base in the process, then spend an incredible amount of effort
to cover their tracks - RE tobacco companies. Indeed, to the extent where
they get a candidate for the rulership of the most powerful country in the
world to state that they don\'t believe the product is harmful when it so
very clearly is.

Ob Trav; PCs are approached by a corporate trouble shooter to \'reduce\' the
concerns of a well informed populace (Tech 8+, Govt 4) over the activities
of a company in a neighboring low tech world. The suitcase of credits
clearly implies that any and all tactics are acceptable provided they cannot
be linked back to the corporation.

Sigh.  Why do you guys always have to pick the hardest possible
solution to a simple problem?  Present day tracer amoo ignites
simply from barrel friction.  Given gauss projectile velocities
and improved chemcial technology at TL-whatever, why not just
have *AIR* friction ignite the little buggers as they exit the
barrel? :^(

Odd. I\'ve never had that much trouble. I just hold the rifle so the
sights line up with my *left* eye. I may have to tilt my head a little,
but I\'ve never really noticed.

Of course, I was also shooting at a pill bottle cap with my .22. I\'d
catch it "on the bounce just about every time, and I wasn\'t using the
sights. :-)

I mostly know about this from a late friend who was a gunsmith.

First problem is that the extra weight can do nasty things to the
magazine catch. Like cause it to fail, dropping a partially used
magazine at an inconvenient moment. Or to jam, making it impossible to
remove an empty. 

Next, the extra weight can make the weapon harder to handle. I never
got to *fire* it, but I did get to *handle an AK-47 with 30 round
magazine, 75 round drum, and 100 round drum. Those drums weigh a *lot*!

Finally, a longer magazine (like the add-on 30 round units for the SKS)
can snag on a lot of stuff that the smaller one won\'t. 

Oh yeah, an interesting idea for refs to dump on players. Have them not
be careful enough in buying ammo for their weapons. That is, buying a
crate of ammo that turns out to be oboxes of loose round, rather than
boxes of magazines or clips. 

In a combat situation, I\'d *much* prefer to have my ammo drop consist
of the ruggedized "cans" of SKS ammo. Each can contains a bunch of
10-round "clips" wrapped in paper. You peel the top off the can (easy,
even if you are in a hurry and grab a handful of these and dump them in
a pouch or your pocket. If you are *really* rushed, you might scrape
your fingers a bit on the edges of the can. Big deal.  The paper keeps
the rounds from collecting dirt, and unwraps easily (makes good fire
starter too!). And if you are in a hurry, you can throw away the clip
(a flat metal "stripper clip").

Contrast this with opening the crate and finding lots of cardboard
boxes containing 20(?) loose rounds. You\'d better have saved the
stripper clips from your original ammo issue, and have *time* to load
them with rounds. Or to load rounds by hand into the internal magazine
in the rifle. 

The above is based on personal experience dealing with two different
purchases of "bulk" ammo for the SKS. I\'m sure similar situations apply
with other weapons and ammo. 

Anyway, sometimes "cheap" can get *real* expensive (like trying to
reload magazines by hand while under fire).

Funny you should ask...

No Ego Wood
Words: ???
Tune: "Norwegian Wood" by the Beatles

     I once had a sword
     or should I say,
     it once had me.

     I just picked it up,
     oh what a sword...
     it was + 3.

     Its ego was 12,
     a fact of which
     I wasn\'t aware.
     \'Til I tried to leave
      and I found that the
      sword didn\'t care.

     I walked thru the halls
     wasting my time
     Nothing to find.
     Then I turned around
     and then I said,
     "Oh, no!  Undead!"

     32 wights saw me coming and started to laugh.
     And I closed my eyes as that sword started hewing a path...

     And when I awoke, I was alone.
     That sword had flown.
      Now I use a club,
      Isn\'t it good...No-Ego-Wood!

Also, the methane can only be present if the planet is very young or
the star is both far away, and "low energy" (ie type K or better yet M)
as otherwise UV from the star will have "cracked" water into H2 (which
leaves) and O2 which reacts with the methane to form more H2O and CO2.

*Or* the methane is being produced by lifeforms on the planet. They\'d
have to be forms existing by *reducing* reactions as opposed to
*oxidizing* ones.

Chlorine/oxy mixes are *really* unlikely for reasons having to do with
chemistry and the reaction energies of various molecules.

Maybe there\'s enough water to form a eutetic? 

And in any case, you have to explain how large amounts of ammonia can
exist in conjuction with oxygen (or does this planet not have Oxygen?).
And again, ammonia degrades to H2 and N2 in the presence of UV from the
star.

But at least it might help explain why the ammonia hasn\'t broken down
due to UV from the star.

What you need to track down is a copy of "Uller Uprising". I think the
reprint was by Ace back in the early to mid 80s. It includes the
article on Niffleheim and Uller written by Dr. Robert S. Richardson.

My copy is in storage, otherwise I\'d offer to xerox the article and
mail it to you. Maybe somebody else on the list can?

Heck, the shuttle gets a complete *rebuild* after each flight. The damn
thing is design for performance, not reliability. 

The reason for replacing/reconditioning tiles is that they\'ve got all
the structural strength of stryofoam. If they get chewed up a bit by
dust particles, insects, and gravel kicked up on landing, they get
replaced or refurbished (usually that means the damaged surface gets
smoothed out and the tile reshaped so it can be a spare for a smaller
tile.

Heck, it\'s the sort of thing I can see being done in the Imperium for
some uses. Things like disposable cargo pods for resupplying troops in
a hot LZ. 

I could actually see the contract for the heat shields being let out to
some TL4 (or less) planet, simply because they were the low bidder.

Yep. It does make for some interesting ideas though. Besides my idea
(in another post) of some low TL planet getting the contract for heat
shields for disposable supply pods for combat resupply of drop capsule
troops, I\'m sure there are lots of other places where such a low tech
idea can be used.

Say, emergency repairs to battle damage on the PC\'s ship.

Well, I prefer something more along the lines of a decent fusion

Actually *any* weapons grade laser is going to ionize the *hell* out of
the air it passes through. I\'ve seen photos of a 1 MW beam in the lab
and it looks like a cheap special effect, with various sized "globes"
of ionization forming and collapsing at random along the beam path. 

X-Ray lasers will be *worse*, because is *very* opaque at X-ray
wavelengths.

So most significant lasers will be located by the long column of plasma
that ocupies the beam path.

Worse than firing tracers or a flame thrower. A *literal* "neon sign"
pointing directly at you.

Well, only 2% of C isn\'t as bad, but it still has an energy requirement of 6 megawatts per newton (for any reaction engine, minimum power requirement = thrust * exhaust velocity).

Who needs a big rock?  Aside from making the projectile a bit harder to destroy, the size of the rock has zero effect on its damage.  Energy = force * distance.

It\'s also funny on how the odds work.  Mentioning this to my wife she tells
me that her brother\'s wife falls into the category of conceiving while
breast feeding some couple of weeks after birth, and that in one centre she
worked, there were three such mothers, but in other centres, she does not
recall any!  It\'s all or nothing I suppose.

I understand the concept, but was wondering if there is a cross in
comprehension of some of the battledresses?  One writer saying the infamous
commando BD is a suit, and another saying it is obviously a mech... I was
probably more thinking aloud to the list on how easy it is for two people to
read one paragraph differently, interpreting one rule differently, one BD
differently, etc.  Also, as I don\'t have the book with the Commando suit in
it, I was asking that particular writer to explain as I had understood the
suit to be that, a suit?

Not being cheaky or looking to start a flame, I was really curious about his
interpretation on that "Battle Dress."

I\'m not even that impressed with such mecha that I don\'t even read anything
with the tag "Battletech" on it, though my 11 year old loves playing
Mechwarrior2: Mercenaries whenever he has free time!

Oooohhhhh, now the old memory is working over time... but I believe I have
seen photos of probably half-a-dozen different weapons of automatic pistol
to automatic rifle (and a few SMG\'s?) with different sized magazines, mostly
WWII era (although the SLR [Self Loading Rifle -- a licensed FN design]
could comfortable take the double capacity mag of the AR [Automatic Rifle --
the upgraded, heavy-barrelled, squad support weapon version of the SLR]).  I
don\'t remember makes/types, but I have seen photos, so that is a basis for
anyone who wants to search them out, that they should find something at
least?

From memory (thinking hard now... why isn\'t this easy anymore?), I believe a
post-war version of the M1 Carbine had to types of box mags -- that is, the
extended mag was post-war, the Thompson had both a box and drum version, as
did both common Russian SMG\'s of WWII.  The MG34 and 42 had belt feed and
drum mags... nope, sorry, that\'s all I can think of from the top of my head,
but I also know there was at least one pistol that had an extended mag
(double capacity I think) that hung straight out the butt of the grip... I
personally owned a .22 semi-automatic Stirling that had three different
capacity box magazines.

Furthermore, my take on it was that weapon magazines were somewhat rugged
AND fragile, and were meant to be as inexpensive as possible.  Some designs
lent themselves to being extended with ease, but the technology for
designing a "reliable" spring mechanism for most would cost more than it was
worth in R&D because the tensile factor (the extended spring would lose it\'s
bounce/push when the mag was fully loaded for any length of time or it would
not extend straight and "kink" in the box) was way off (again, my learning
came from 50\'s/60\'s source material, so it is in all probability, possible
in our day and age).  For more capacity, I understand in the 80\'s there was
a company (I don\'t know if it still exists or not, was successful or not)
that was producing snail mags for different handguns.

For devious GM\'s, you can also use the "old design short fall" that some
weapons naturally possessed, such as the old Aussie 9mm SMG, the F1.  It had
a 30 rd box magazine that had two quirks in itself, one was that if you
reloaded and hit down on the top of the fresh mag with the breach block/bolt
open, some worn mags would deposit nearly half of the magazine\'s rounds
straight down at your feet -- the mag was top loaded and the ejection port
was directly below it... when the last round was ejected, the action would
carry forward with a resounding "Clunk" letting you know it was empty, the
IA was to cock the weapon, remove the empty mag and replace it with a fully
charged one, point the weapon at the target and squeeze the trigger to
release the action and continue firing, so the breach was fully open upon
reloading and with mags that had worn (I forget the term, arrrrrrgh!
Errrr... lips?  Flanges?), the rounds would just get pushed out if you hit
the top of the mag!

The other magazine quirk was that some of the older mags (that still had
good lips/flanges/whatever) would have springs that just lost strength over
time and to remain "reliable," couldn\'t have more than 20-25 rounds loaded
into them otherwise they wouldn\'t feed!  Mind you, it was a simple weapon
and fun for a yippee shoot nonetheless :^)

I also believe that squeezing both triggers at once (a la John Woo
movie-style) is not a natural action... obviously it can be done when
thought about, but not a naturally occurring action... like rubbing you
belly and patting your head, many can do it with thought (and some never
can!), but not many do it naturally.  Depending on how a player wants to do
it, this could also add another penalty?

The infamous commando BD is a suit, as I recall.  It has a battlesuit crewstation.  I think it also has the limbs in the limbs of the suit, not the entire pilot enclosed in the torso.

Wonderful for suppressive fire though - not only can you suppress the
guy you\'re firing at, but his mate on the right, and his mate on the
left as well :)

Hmmm, Group hits for autofire anyone?

I loved those Merc rules in CT, and spent ages as a 14 year old designing a
full auto shotgun for use as a defensive weapon mounted in pods on the
ceiling or walls of military vessels.  Have all the sensitive areas
approached only by long(ish... say 10m) corridors with no other exits. A few
full auto shotguns mounted at both ends of the corridor will fill the
corridor with such a vast amount of buckshot that even a platoon of IM in CT
BD will become a red haze if you use group hits by auto, and each of those
hits doing group hits by shotgun. Also, if the corridor is made of bulkhead
material, you can\'t damage your own ship (apart from sandblasting the
paintjob)

Ahhh, happy days <g>

Me! Me! Me!...

After splurging so much on eBay recently, it\'d be nice to actually use some
of the stuff I\'ve bought.

If we can iron out the basics, I\'d be willing to ref a PBeM of FFW or TCS,
as long as RL doesn\'t intrude too much.

I suppose weekly turns would be best (both from a canon an RL point of
view).  Say, all orders to be received by 23.59 UK time (with a little
leeway for late orders) on a Friday.  I adjudicate on the Saturday, and post
updates on the Sunday. Any comments or victi^H^H^H volunteers, email me at
the address below (or to TML if you don\'t mind your comms being intercepted
by potential opponents <g>).

All the best,

Matt

of the Rebellion. He nuked quite a lot of planets bare, and
intentionally left many other planets without the infrastructure to
support their own populations, so near-c rocks would\'ve been right down
his alley.

Some possible reasons Lucan didn\'t use near-c rocks could be:

1) He didn\'t want to spend resources researching and developing ships
capable of projecting rocks when he has ships capable of planet nuking
already deployed.  I think this is the most likely reason.

2) He wanted the planets to be salveagable, and replace the "disloyal"
populations with loyal colonists. (this one is hard, because I don\'t have
any of the Hard Times or Survival Margin material.  I don\'t know what the
factions did in the last years before TNE).

3) He was not an original thinker, and no one suggested it.

4) Mabye he did order asteroid strikes (somehow using standard naval ships
as tugs to get the asteroid on course) and it was never reported. Maybe his
or any faction\'s naval commander on the scene ordered asteroid strikes.  Not
at near-c, but incredibly destructive nonetheless.

If Lucan had them, I\'m sure he would have used them.  An Emperor of the 3I I
think would not have used them, because of political reasons.  Once the
Rebellion started in earnest, I think political considerations were last on
everyone\'s list of priorities, especially in Lucan\'s fascist "Imperium".

I gloss over the combat sections.  Honestly, Mike Stackpole writes such
great intrigue that you get caught up in the court politics of the Inner

Try, he didn\'t *HAVE* the resources to pull it off.  Remember, by 1120, most 
of the fleet engagements were over with, and any surviving fleet was at 60% 
or less of book strength.  If given the choice between trying to rebuild your 
fleets or trying something as ridiculous as trying to move an asteroid 
against a planet, 99% of the brass would rebuild their fleet.  It\'s just more 
practical.  You can *always* use the ship on different mission profiles.  
Moving a rock is just moving a rock.

HT says that the *only* one able to field a big fleet in 1120 was Lucan, and 
he threw it away trying to whack out Strephon in Gushemege.  Not exactly 
bright, lemme tell ya...

Big rocks need big energy to move them.

If he had the capability of \'rocking\' somebody\'s world, hell, yeah, he\'dve 
done it.  He just didn\'t have the resources.

I think the error may have been on the part of your local station,
which may have aired the episodes out of order. According to the
official episode guides, in the first season there were only three
episodes after the one in which they killed Tasha Yar -- and she
appeared in none of them.

That\'s the problem with syndication -- with hundreds of stations
showing the episodes, each scheduling them on their own, there is
bound to be a mishap here and there. (It\'s happened with my local
station at least twice that I can identify in the three modern-day
ST series.)

This is not to say that ST is otherwise self-consistent -- all the 
series are rife with contradictions, mistakes, and continuity glitches.
Then again, what TV series isn\'t? For some reason, Trekkies are more
obsessive about canon and continuity than any other series that I know
of. (You see the fans of Cheers getting that obsessive?)  :)

  Good fix - no more Killer Scoutships of Doom.

Mr. McKinney\'s TCS game will likely start realizing that the total #

Of course, AGIs (or other ships on intelligence missions) with black
globe generators could still jump in with impunity, unless this fix
supercedes the FFW rule allowing BGG-equipped ships to perform a "free"
action (due to their not being spotted coming in-system).  They simply
jump in with the black globe on full, wait until the jump-flash was
gone, then go into flicker-mode to adjust their vectors as needed.  Upon
reaching their in-system station, they go into low-emissions mode
(throttling back the power plant to reduce heat and neutrino emissions,
using PEMS rather than LIDAR or AEMS, etc.), and carry out their
mission.

Not really.  Life can be a series of compromises.  My wife wouldn\'t let
me have the master bedroom for my gameroom, but I did get to take over
one of the childrens\' rooms provided I "let" them camp out in the
yard every night.  ;-)

Seriously though, I would be willing to host a Traveller boardgame fest
at my place.  I already have one person interested.

In our campaign, my players all own Battledress, the TL 12 DR240 standard
type (I agree totally with Doug, Scout/Commando Battledress is just wrong,
the most biffo version that exists IMTU is  Anthony Jackson\'s "sane"
battledress which I think is great -so do my players but they don\'t have
any yet)

Before you claim that I am being overun by rampant munchkinism, they are a
Licensed mercenary squad specialising in GTL12 PROFORS / Commmando work.
But that license wasn\'t cheap, neither is maintainance, those TL12 parts
can be pretty hard to get out in the boondocks of the Spinward Marches and
Imperial Authorities keep on giving them "Loyalty" missions just to check
their integrity heh heh

Anyway they have taken a quite a few hits from HEAT grenades and keep
asking about point defense for battledress, I was thinking something like a
back mounted pod turret that sits just above your head with a small PESA
and low powered(4d) high ROF xlaser with computer control should be able to
knock out most grenades, missiles and rockets at least as long as the range
wasn\'t too short. I don\'t know about conventional fired projectiles maybe
low powered only ?

what does everyone reckon, can it be done, if so how would you run it, or
do you think its drifting off into scout/commando BD territory ?

 To my way of thinking thats the great strength of plasma/fusion weapons,
apart from having enough armour there\'s not much you can do to stop them

I would use the 20mm APFSDSHD disposable railgun (20mm IAAW) that Doug made
ages ago to crack battledress

A few other things

slang we use in trav
a "cracker" - a weapon capable of penetrating BD
to "beam him down" - kill a man gunslinger style with a laser weapon

has anyone elses gaming groups come up with any cool slang for traveller ?

the gangsta style of pistol shooting is a good technique with wheelock and
flintlock pistols as it gives you a better chance of the pan igniting the
main charge-  maybe all those gansters just thought that highwaymen looked
cool- "Stand and Deliver" ha ha

I understand exactly how you feel.  If I wasn\'t in the PBEM

Two main problems. First, you need something to *ignite* the tracer
compound. With conventional firearms, the powder does this nicely.

Second, the projectiles for man portable gauss weapons tend to be
smaller in diameter, thus making it much harder to get a decent amount
of tracer compound into them.

One possiblity (that risks ruining the weapon) would be for "rail gun"
type weapons to fire titanium projectiles and somehow ignite them
(preferabbly as they leave the barrel! :-).

That would provide a nice tracer effect, and possibly make a decent
incendiary round. Especially from larger caliber weapons. :-)

From everything I hear, the hand-made Afghani copies of just about
*any* gun are just as good as the original, unless the original
requires special steels.

The thing is, HEPlar, or even a more reasonable fusion rocket only
requires you to "watch fuel" *closely* if you try doing "absurd" things
with it. Like making normal space trips longer than a week.

Well, point defense weapons on powered battledress are included in the
T4 designs in both _Central Supply Catalog_ and _Emperor\'s Arsenal_
(both at TL-12), so I see no problem with the concept.  A very cursory
look at LB Books 1 and 4 give no details about the presence or absence
of PD mounts on powered battledress.  I don\'t own MT or TNE, so I can\'t
say yea or nay about PD weapons in those systems.

PD systems on powered battledress make sense to me, for all echelons of
powered BD use.

In T4, if one is willing to pay the penalties in power requirements and
sensor degradation, one can install electrostatic armor against any form
of plasma penetration (HEAT rounds and plasma/fusion guns).  I don\'t
know about other versions of Traveller concerning this matter.

justify the use of NEAR C Rocks , Moons, and other planets as weapons.

The Imperium explicitly bans two types of weapons systems for use of any
organisation within Imperial Space (Internal and External). They are the Hyper
Velocity Planetary Bombardment system (HVPBS) and the Large Mass planetary
Bombardment System (LMPBS). These are generally refereed to as Planetary Bombard
Systems (PBS), which is a misnomer, as they can be used against any target in
space, including vessels.

The definitions of these systems are intentionally ill-defined, as to cover any
possibility of variations.

Hyper Velocity Planetary Bombardment Systems (HVPBS) and Large Mass Planetary
Bombardment Systems (LMPBS)  ,  like Nuclear Warheads , are reserved for
Imperial forces only. Except that since Imperial Order 1109 , the use of said
weapons is barred as a first use weapon. The Imperium reserves the right to
respond in kind to any attacks used on its member worlds or installations, but
the use of it as a first strike by party will GUARANTEE response from the
Imperium

As per IO1109, and admended by IO2045, use of HVPBS must be authorised by the
Emperor or Archduke ON IMPERIAL STATIONARY. The Imperium that the use of HVPBS
is a political weapon, thus no Imperial Officer can initiate use of this system.
The penalty is loss of all assets, up to and including his/her life.

The United Planets (precursor to the Terran Confederation) is the first
Interstellar organisation barring the use of what it termed "Lensmen" scale
weaponry (it is generally believed to refer to a war before contact with the
Vilani between the Boskone and Arista nations). It is interesting to note that
the Vilani never envisioned PBS weaponry, and was stunned to learn that the
Terran Confederation actually considered to use them, until the tide of the war
turned to their favour. It was some indication of the alarm that the Vilani
caused in the TC that war crimes was considered necessary to "equalise" the
numerical advantage that the Vilani was perceived to have. Saner minds
eventually convince the TC that letting the Lensmen Weapons loose would infact
jeopardise the Terrans (as they had less planets to lose).

Informal discussions with the Zhodani during the conclusion of the First
Frontier Wars agreed that both sides will informally acknowledge that HVPBS and
LMPBS will not be used by either side. Of all the Major races, only the Kree do
not publicly renounce the use of HVPBS and LMPBS. However all Starfaring nations
near the Kree have advised the Kree that any use of the HVPBS and LMPBS will be
met in kind, and it is rumoured that both the Solomani and Imperial forces have
a class of ship based near Kree space solely designed to accelerate projectiles.
Of cause, both the Solomani and Imperial Governments deny this.

The dictates of IO1109 was only activated once. During the Jesma trade war  of
894, planet X (XXXX, YYYYYYY Sector) atempted to hamper the industrial and
manpower advantage of planet Y (XXXX,  YYYYYYYSector), by attempting to drop a
HVPBS (the asteroid \'Vengeance\') on planet Y\'s main contenant. The Imperial
Scout Service manage to get wind of the attempt, immediately activated every
scout in the subsector, and launched a pre-emptive assault on Vengeance,
distroying the installation. The Imperial Navy and Marines then proceeded to
deploy Nuclear Weapons on planet X until the government surrendered
unconditionally. The surviving planetary Council was immediately executed, and
the State religion (which proposed the use of the HVPBS) was suppressed (and
many of its hierarchy executed as well). Planet X is still under Imperial
control as of 1120.

Exactly. The reason for my post was in response to David Summer\'s complaint
that people were putting GURPS down on this topic. I tried to expalin why
GURPS skill system didn\'t feel like a task system to some ex TNE/MT/T4
players (something that the original poster who prompted David\'s ire
actually felt I clarified from his post). David has since claimed that
GURPS has a such a system. I couldn\'t find it so am looking forward to
receiving a Digest with its page reference in.

This lack of task system prompted us to look at it for GURPS - the reason
the system we adopted for GURPS is centred on \'Difficult\' is that the
numbers balance out between versions better (Andy L did some work on
probability before settling on the numbers we\'re using for the BITS sytem.)

The irony in complaining about peoples\' attitude to GURPS is that until now
it\'s been (deservedly) getting an easier ride than T4 did. Personally, I
think that GT is good for Traveller, provided T5 can hook into it.

Poul Anderson wrote a Dominic Flandry story in which he decides to get
rescued by setting fire to the steppe, which is the only resource on
that planet.  His analysis is that both warring factions will cooperate,
or at least not interfere, with each other\'s fire control efforts.  Then
he hopes he\'s closer to those he\'s running toward than those he\'s
running from.

You could build it and have your PCs grow up in it and run a campaign

I have for years been thinking about how to do Fifth Frontier War -- or
Traveller interstellar war in general -- in a way that captures the
feeling of not knowing where the enemy is.  Granted, I\'ve been
considering it for a map-and-counters game, not computer, but a computer
game might be the way to go.  I think the most important flavor of
Traveller interstellar war is the nature of intelligence about both
enemy and friendly units.  

Here\'s how I visualize it:

The player takes the role of the senior admiral in the action, and
starts with a fleet at a major world.  The map available to the player
shows every star system with all naval, military, and scout
dispositions.  Each disposition is dated, and, at the advanced level,
credited.  

So I\'m at Rhylanor on 1-1107.  My map shows me that the 193rd Fleet is
there as of 1-1107, and that information came from personal observation
(which is another problem that I won\'t address). My map also shows me
that the 212th Fleet is at Efate, as of 350-1106, and that information
came from or is confirmed by regular Imperial Navy channels, Imperial
Naval Intelligence, Office of Naval Intelligence, and IISS.  The Zhodani
43rd Fleet is at Riverworld as of 300-1106, according to Imperial Naval
Intelligence, but no one else.  So you have a problem of which
information is correct, as well as how old it is.  

The computer would take over control of scout squadrons and individual
scout ships, although the player should be able to set some general
parameters (focus on internal reporting vs. behind enemy lines, e.g.). 
The scouts will report their observations to the internal intelligence
network, which will eventually filter up to the player.  

The player would send orders to his units, which would eventually maybe
get the orders and maybe obey them if they still made sense and the unit
had enough morale.  Then the player would maybe get a report of what
happened (probably brought by a scout). Still, the after-action report
would not arrive for weeks after the action.  

I wonder if this hyper-realism would be fun to play?

Isn\'t there a Ministry of Ship Names (mentioned in Lightning Class
Cruisers, I think)?  I wonder what their regulations say.  The Traveller
universe is so big, so old, and full of so many different classes of
ships that almost any name is possible.  I tend to draw inspiration from
canonical sources (LCC/AHL, Fighting Ships, Traders and Gunboats, etc.)
and history.  

In the gas of Uranus:
"Sir, I\'ve got a big squadron of Solomani Confederation ships jumping in
at extreme range.  Cruisers and some smaller vessels... I think the
cruisers are the Adolf Hitler and the Genghis Khan .. and ... um ... the
William Jefferson Clinton.  That really big one is the dreadnaught
Dingir, and those are the troop carriers Pennsylvania and Guangzhou. 
The frigates are ... um ... the Pele, the Fafnir, the Shugashiika, and
the Tengu."

One of the things is that the task system is a VERY convenient shorthand...

By defining certain parameters one has a consistant memorable mechanic:
Difficulty
two modifiers (Usually one att DM and one skill, sometimes two skills,
	sometimes two atts), which are used both to increase success chances
	and reduce time taken.
a time increment (1/10 the expected time for a person with a total mod of 1,
	to wit, skill 0 (minimal/familiarity, rather than no skill) and
	att 5-9 (for DM+1).
and the following boolean flags (indicated only when set to true):
	Safe: No mishaps
	Hazardous: Mishaps are no more common, but more dangerous
	Fateful: any fail is a mishap
	Unskilled OK: no penalty for lacking a requisite modifier
	Confrontation: If present, list the modifiers opposing
	Uncertain: Player roll determines whether or not he knows how well
		he did.
	Absolute: The time shown is a fixed time, not a time increment, and
		no time roll is used, therefore skill has no effect on time
		taken.
Several of the tasks are very easy for me to remember, specifically many of
the starhip operation tasks (defined in MT Imp Encyc). The combat tasks
were quite well laid out, and far more mnemonic than the CT or Striker/AHL
Equivalents.

And because the basic interpersonal tasks are listed as well, including the
effects on reactions, the system had a broad repetoire of some 40
predefined non-combat tasks, in a consistant, memorable, mnemonic based
setup. Yes, some of the granularity was sacrificed. The effects of lack of
skill were one consistant mechanic, rather than a series of "Defaults" ala
GURPS. The effects of skill on time taken were one consistant mechanic.
Lacking appropriate tools? In GURPS, the modifier may vary from skill to
skill; in MT, increase difficluty 1 step. Things like this, where the Task
system is a set of modifiers shared by all situations (admittedly,
sometimes not quite right for certain types of play), rather than the
various and seldom clearly presented modifiers presented throughout GURPS...

Some comonalities between GURPS\' skill system and MT\'s Task System:
Consistant rules for exceptional success and failure. Self Consistant
methods of useing attributes in resolving skill use (albeit very different
ways; TNE is more similar).

The MT task system also had several other secondary mechanics in other
locations than the basic rules: Expanded interpersonal tasks in the
Referee\'s Gaming Kit (DGP), Expanded Sensor Rules in WBH (DGP), Expanded
and more detailed ship operation rules in SSOM (DGP), Low Tech craft launch
expansions in Hard Times (GDW), and the Research and Large Scale combat
systems in the MT Ref\'s Companion (GDW).
These were more than just collections of tasks, but all three included some

In TNE, several more interesting "Addenda" arise: Take a look at world
tamer\'s handbook.

GURPS lacks a consistant effect of Skill on Time Taken. 2300 and MT had a
consistant system. TNE dropped the time roll.

Also, once players understand how to use the task system, the Cautious and
Hasty modifiers really come into their own... players, when presented with
"To open the airlock Iris manually: Difficult, Str, Mechanical, 1 minute;
semi-safe" they know that a skill 2 Str 7 character should be able to do it
in roughly 8 minutes, and needs the right tools, and that mishaps, if any,
will be very mild (I added semi-safe to mean roll mishaps on only 1d rather
than the normal 2). Most would go ahead and take the extra time (cautious
task), knowing that it moves if from about 8 minutes to about 16, and from
roughly 45% chance of success (using above stats) to about 85% or so
(Needing a natural 8+ to Natural 4+). Explaining all the ramifications in
GURPS terms is less concise, and even breaking them down to plain english
is wordy.


Someone I know once compiled a file with all the MT tasks in print in
challenge, the GDW published MT products, the DGP MT products, and TD
through #18... he found over 100 distinct tasks.

In conclusion, Yes, the MT Task System is just an elaboration of a skill
system. No it is not JUST a skill system. GURPS has a system for
determining success or failure, including critical success and critical
failure; it lacks *consistant* sets of modifiers for not JUST difficulty
but also: lack of tools, hasty attempts, cautious attemps, modifiers to
chances of mishap other than skill level, a consistant and simple (and
easily memorized) unskilled penalty.

Yes, I remember that Katana defaults to Broadsword-2. But I can\'t remember
the modifier for defaulting from Dex to either Broadsword or Katana, nor
the penalty for Physics defaulting from IQ, nor the dozens of of other
defaults on the over 100 skills listed in Compendium-1; I have trouble
remembering which attribute a skill is assigned to under TNE. But in MT, I
know that basic ship operations are in Imp Encyc, in the section on
travelling. I know that sensor tasks are defined in WBH, and can loook them
up in a few seconds, and they satnd out in the text. I know also that the
Task definitions for interpersonal tasks are on the screen, and the
estimation tasks are also right there as meta-tasks (tasks with a range of
possible applications, but one definition). I know that to get passive
cooperation from a hostile (but not immediately violent) guard, the
character needs a critical success on the task roll to shift him two steps,
and getting active cooperation will require quite a while as the repeated
task attempt rules take over...

The task system, once understood, becomes a key to unlocking the game from
lists of modifiers or arbitrary modifiers. it becomes a major shared
frameowrk to reduce the arbitrarieness, and decrease the time needed to
impart a wealth of details. I loan new players a photocopy of the Player\'s
Guide to Tasks from the Player\'s Manual... 1 page, and it tells them what
they need to roll, and how to break down the code used in play. As a gm, I
use the task system, and have found it to be a cornestone of good gm\'ing.
Also, since I use a few tweaks, the sheet I hand out has the modifications
I use on it: att/3 (vs att/5 official), increased difficulties (Shift them
up 1 point), and max DM +10 (vs +8 official except for psionics) including
for psionics tasks, and the semi-safe description is sometimes pencilled in.

Two words:

Close Combat.  Microsoft\'s current series of WW2 games models practically
everything up to the chance your soldiers will wet themselves instead of
opening fire.

(There\'s also Harpoon, but that was a while ago, and YMMV on the "fun" part.)

<answer 1>
Does it? One article I read in some shooting mag (don\'t remember which, but
my ROTC unit had the sub) was a detail of various tracers and their
methods. Some are lit by contact with hot propellant gasses, and others by
the pressure wave, and others still by the combined pressure wave and heat
from various sources, including barrel friction and propellant gas temps.
There is a lot of heat energy present in modern powders; heat is the
driving force behind the expanding gas which drives the bullet. The article
also said many tracer compounds wer self-oxidizing compounds.

Also, how much heat on a hypersonic bullet is air friction, how much is
barrel friction, and how much is leftover heat transferred by conduction
from the propellant gasses? In the case of Gauss weapons, we lose 2 of the
three.

Interesting experiment for hand-loaders: make some subcaliber DS rounds
using a low-theroconductive sabots and some high-thermoconductivity sabots.
Fire them into water, and compare the steam flash.

Another experiment for bullet temps: Fire them into a paper stop. I know
that the .22LR CCI stinger, a supersonic round, will not ignite newsprint,
nor even mark it (note: the round is STOPING in the paper). firing a blank
will mark the paper (scorching), even if it doesn\'t go through. I\'m also
not convinced that the Gauss weapons are even all that fast.

<answer 2>
Simple: Look at the airflow around such a projectile. The tracer fuel will
be in the partial vaccum of the flow turbulence. Not reliable. Barrel
friction won\'t do, as IMTU, Gauss weapons don\'t have projectile contact
with the barrel, at least under normal operations, being coil designs, not
railguns. A coaxial laser is a simple solution, especially if the tracer
illum chemical is especially sensitive to the frequencies used.

Also, if you put the tracer chem where it will get significant air
friction, the loss of material as it burns is likely to rapidly affect the
spin and tumble characteristics, or have the illum more visible from the
sides than the rear; tracers are there for the FIRER, not the audience, at
least in proper field use. And as for penetrating heat from air friction,
I\'m not willing to rely on it, and in any case, I\'d rather have the tracer
lit as it exits the barrel, consistantly.

<both>
Another thing to note is that I\'m talking a laser firing out through the
barrel void, fixed focus at about the end of the barrel, rather than the
current use of coaxial, meaning mounted along a parallel axis, as used in
describing armored vehicle mounts.

Comparing the MT stats, the pen is comparable with the DS from the 7mm ACR,
and the atten is lower (therefore, the penetration attenuates more rapidly;
Atten is range bands past close per halving of Pen); so the round is
obviously losing energy faster than the DS round, and probably less massive
massive. MT damages are not indicative of mass or energy per se, as most
direct penetration rounds have a damage of 3. Extremely large personal
rounds (>12mm) seem to have damage increased by 1. (Reminder: MT damage
number is also number of d6\'s damage to attributes assuming unarmored
target or target with armor < 0.5x Pen). MT Pens correspond quite well to
3G3 DV\'s, which are based upon penetration.
