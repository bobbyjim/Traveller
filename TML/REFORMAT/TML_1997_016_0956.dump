   Yup...such style differences still exist today.  The \'pistol\' grip seen
on many epees and foils today is also called a \'Belgian\' grip.  When I was
activily taking sabre lessons a few years back, my coach was teaching
\'Russian method\'.  This was due to Russians cleaning up in Olympic sabre
lately.
  In M:0, the styles could be named after planets, sectors, Fencing
Masters, or after the name of a famous Salle d\'Arms.
  For a good read of well described fencing, try Zelanzy.  Two instances in
particular stand out.  In the first and tenth Amber books.  The first has a
duel between Eric & Corwin.  The tenth has a bought between a young punk
Amberite, and a shadow ghost of a Prince not named for those who want to
read the stories.  The punk kid is using a blade on the light side of
broadsword.  The Ghost is using a blade on the heavy end of rapier.

  This gets into whats the popular style of Court blade?  Rapier, sabre,
katana, or gladius?  A mix?  Is rapier & main gauche \'sporting\' to use
against katana?

You just have to be more patient with HEPlaR; you can\'t accelerate
all the way to a gas giant and back, but you can accelerate part way, coast
for a long time, and deccelerate at the end. (After all, NASA gets TL-7
probes to Jupiter without efven HEPlaR...) It\'ll typically take a week or two
to get to a gas giant, if I recall correctly. Most HEPlaR ships will have
enough fuel for 40 hours or so of constant acceleration. Nowhere near as
good for cruising around the solar system as thrusters, but it breaks fewer 
laws of physics.

If it covers CT, MT, and TNE, it could also be a long-lived cash cow...

Re-pressings of an extant CD can be done cheap.
And as often as needed.

At least, once the initial overhead is gone. I\'d also like to see it in
stores... or at least made available to stores.

If the price is low enough (30-50 $US), I know guys who\'d pick it up simply
to get a useable, hard to destroy, caffine and pizza-immune edition of
either CT or MT or TNE rules. That\'s part of why I\'d like the CD-Rom... and
same for 3 of the 5 guys interested locally. I dunno \'bout Peter Newman,
tho... and he orders for the FLGS in anchorage...

HEY, PETER, do you think it would sell locally???

Yeah, it\'s things like that I was meaning. I would like to think that major 
changes like raising the ROM 2-3 TLs and wiping out an entire Major Race were 
unintentional, and can safely be ignored.

Ship\'s computers do not need to be "AI" by the classical definition to be
interesting.  Programming, after thousands of years of evolutionary
development, should be able to come up with a "pretty smart" ship\'s
computer that is not technically AI. So what does that mean?  For me it
means that the ship\'s computer can follow orders, make sassy replys,
reorder supplies, learn from its mistakes within limits, recommend courses
of action (based on known and estimated data) and understand language
pretty well (when the meaning is relatively clear).  It cannot come up with
ideas not programmed into it (and who says how many crazy ideas are
programmed in), but it can initiate action if the right parameters are met.
It cannot alter its own programming unless programmed to do so.

The last ship\'s computer which had personality was an NPC computer
transferred from a Kinunir.  The programmer gave it Madeline Kahn\'s voice.

At one point she broke into the Lily von Shtup routine..."I\'m tired...tired
of being admired."

A classic moment for those who participated.

Perhaps the next one will have Eartha Kitt\'s voice.  That should please the
Aslan on board.

How about James Earl Jones?  ("Selden, I am your Father...oops, I mean

How about Mary Tyler Moore?  "Oh Rooob! the jump drive is offline"

And, as a marine once pointed out to me, the laser sight is as good as a
flashlight when trying to shoot at the *user* of the sight.  I would treat
anyone using a laser sight as a big target in a darkened room, for example.
Of course, the sight usually goes on just before a round is fired, right?
Maybe just an increase in what some systems call "signature" for the firing
weapon.

Anyway, the players in my group rarely use laser sights since I explained
this opinion.  Does anyone here use such devices, and can they verify or
comment on this opinion?

J.P. suggested that you were referring to the following:

  _Anomalies_, IG, 1997, pp 21-22.

  From 3: Lone Whisper, "The Prisoner in the Pyramid"

    "... The Droyne were ultimately destroyed in a centuries-long conflict
     by their very creator.  This being is referred to as \'Grandfather\' ..."

  Sounds like the final war to me, though Grandfather is somewhat
  exaggerated as their creator, it is easy to see that PoV.

  Then, after some additional gloss/insight into the Final War era:

    "... he [GF] reportedly hunted down and destroyed every powerful
     Droyne that existed."

  I do not read this as saying that _all_ Droyne were destroyed.  It
  says "every powerful", which I interpret to mean his grandchildren,
  his children, and all worlds that were high enough tech to be a threat.
  Certainly, that is the meaning of "powerful Droyne" to me, especially
  read in the context of CT/MT materials previously published.

I had previously covered this passage and hadn\'t considered that you were
referring to the above since I found it entirely consistent with what we
know, plus some embellishment, which I have previously stated is fine with
me.  Fill in more holes, fill in more holes, fill in more holes, fix some
particularly deep ones.

IMO :)

Oh yeah, and before this comes up again, even though AM5 said that GF was
very careful and kept count, there is room for one of the children/grand-
children being on _Khiinra Ash_, especially since I originally posted that
is was _easily_ possible to do a _perfect_ double for the child/gc.  I even
posited that a good question would be, which of the two (original or clone)
was in the pyramid?

The referee is _clearly_ left to determine the outcome of the adventure,
so nothing wrong or new there, eh?

If I have the wrong quote, please aprise me so that I can read that
correct one.

My preferences (roughly prioritized):

1.  ASCII text.  IMHO, this is a must for maximum flexability.  The
original information, except for significant errata.  Maybe include
original (incorrect) info for completeness.  Additional comments, etc.
should be added in a separate section and referenced, or possibly as
footnotes.

2.  Extensive search capability.  I consider an index (barely!) less
important than this, since _no_ index will contain _everything_ that\'ll
be searched for.

3.  A thorough index.

4.  Images separately scanned and stored in a common format.  I\'m not
terribly picky about what, although I do tend to agree about the
information loss problems with JPEGs.  Deck/floor plans in particular
should be separate high-quality images.

5.  _Simple_ HTML.  I would personally like to see fairly extensive
cross-referencing and a hyperlinked index.

6.  Some printable version of the original pages.  PDF or whatever, I
don\'t really care.  While this would be handy, it\'s quite secondary to
good qualtity searchable text.

I\'d also like to see some commentary from you, Marc, detailing the
evolution of Traveller and tying the various versions together.  Of
course, I realize this risks further effects on canon... ;)

I\'m fairly sure that 1-5 above would easily fit on a single CD-ROM,
although I can\'t prove it.  This is something I\'d readily buy; the USD80
figure that someone threw out would be fine.  Of course, discounts for
those who help but it together seem reasonable also. :)

If there\'s room, we might even sneak a few software utilities on it.  Of
course, then it looses it\'s cross platform appeal.  Well if we get to
the point of worrying about that, I, for one, will be ecstatic!

So Leroy is the other person who knows where it is! Since Marc actually
posted the original location of the Droyne homeworld on the TML a few weeks
back, and I actually read the post, Marc and I must be the two other people
Leroy refers to. To think that only Leroy and I actually read Marc\'s
posts... I feel so proud.

Which is why I feel a format with a few source-code-available reference 
implementations is a good idea. That way, any past/future computers 
with a C compiler can have at least a converter that can change the 
images into a \'native\' format.

At a guess it\'s growing. However, it *is* a minority format. No *way* 
are all those porn disks/bbb\'s/websites full of pirated gif\'s going to 
change over. ;-)

If I remember correctly, the next version of Netscape/IE are going to 
support it, and for now one can get a free plugin for both at 
http://speedy.siegelgale.com/solutions/png_index.html. (Only Win and 
Mac unfortunately.) Or one can simply do it the oldfashioned way and 
use a helper app that knows the format. ;-)

Well, BMP, while certainly an easy format (well, actually, it\'s too 
complicated for being a simple bit dump), makes huge files. PCX ain\'t 
too bad, only, it is (like GIF) a 256 color format. Not likely to 
matter much for this project, unless you want the color scans to look 
good.

While I don\'t agree about Unix ;-), I do agree about TIFF. It\'s not 
only designed by a committe, it\'s designed by several committees that 
apparently weren\'t on speaking terms. ;-)

For anyone who - for some arcane reason - wants more info, take a look 
at http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/~mxr/gfx/ , the near-canonical list of 
graphics file formats. (Can anyone tell I once wrote a graphics app? 
;-)

Plain text, it\'s not just a good idea, it\'s the Law. (Or it should be, 
anyway. ;-)

That I *can* relate to. (Not using OS/2, however. I still suffer from 
trauma brought on by having to use, understand and support OS/2 1.0, 
1.1, 1.2 and 1.3. I\'m no longer responsive to attempts to tell me 
that OS/2 is actually quite good these days. ;-)

I am, however, always willing to help a fellow OS/2 sufferer. ;-) Have 
you looked at this page? 
http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Tools/html2things.html He lists a lot of 
tools that convert HTML to a variety of formats, among them RTF, which 
I seem to remember having been supported in Word since day one. 
(There\'s even a converter to WP 5.1, so you\'re all set. ;-)

Oh, it handles tables quite nicely. It just displays all cells after

Well, basically, JPEG uses a destructive ("lossy") compression 
algorithm. That is, it \'knows\' what it can remove from the image 
without there being much chance a human eye notices it. While this *is* 
handy for \'final\' images (when you don\'t really want people to mess 
with it anyway), it does also mean that each and every time you save 
the image, it is re-compressed, meaning a bit more information is lost. 
(Not *strictly* always true, but for a general overview, true enough.)

Also, JPG/JPEG is primarily meant to display true-color high-resolution 
images - photographs - it\'s not really suitable for scanned text.

For more - and more clearly stated ;-) - information, please take a 
look at : http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/~mxr/gfx/faqs/JPEG.faq . Section 10 
is of particular relevance. Another good site
is http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/~mxr/gfx/

Now, I don\'t know why JPEG is important to you, so it may be that the 
above doesn\'t really matter to you (perhaps it\'s near-ubiquity among 
potential customers is more important), but if you work professionally 
with images you should at least be aware of the above.

things to say.

Compiled old Traveller stuff (CT, MT and even TNE) on a CD it a great
idea. But it\'s also a lot of work, I would like to side with those
suggesting we, the fans, assist in the task.

Even so, it would take a lot of time and effort. Here is my suggestion:
Why wait for *all* the material to be scanned and edited before
releasing it? Why not steal a page from TSR (see <www.tsrinc.com>) and
release the material one Little Black Book at a time?

As each book is converted, the doc could be published on the Imperium
Games site, for downloading by the masses. Once everything is converted,
it\'s a relatively simple matter of throwing everything on a
cross-platform CD and offering it for sale, (along with fan-produced
computer aids even). I predict that it will sell like hotcakes even if
the stuff is available for free on the \'net. Everyone likes to have
things neatly compiled and stored on one CD-ROM, to free up HD space.

Here\'s how I envision the process:

1. IG announces the next LBB that will be scanned (once or twice a week,
say) on the TML (great resource of enthusiastic fans) and website.

2. 2 or 3 (at most) hardy souls volunteer to compile the corrections to
the scanned material. Their mission is to match as closely as possible
the lastest printing of the book. Any errata is added in an ADDENDA. 

3. IG posts the email addr. of selected suck--er-- volunteers to their
website and TML. They also post the RAW scanned data, OCR\'ed, in text
format, to a web or ftp site. (A volunteer or IG itself may have
scanned/OCR\'ed it) All interested parties are invited to email
corrections to the volunteer editors.

4. Editors email corrections to IG for formatting. (give \'em 3-4 weeks)

5. Final doc is posted to web or ftp site for downloading by the masses.

FORMAT: Does .pdf suck?

I say no.

Why I like .pdf:
- - Totally cross-platform
- - Doc is encapsulated in one file, with all fonts and formatting intact
- - It can be printed with correct pagination
- - It can be indexed, and include a table of contents
- - *Notes* can be easily added by the author, or reader!
- - Hyperlinks can be imbedded to acess those mentioned websites/tools
- - It can be bookmarked and searched
- - Graphics can be embedded (and hot-linked too, iirc)
- - Line-Art can be printed crisply
- - Text can be copied and edited
- - Index and search across multiple documents (LBB\'s)

Some things about .pdf that suck:
- - Printing to non-postscript printers is sometimes problematic
- - Can be slow and a memory hog on older systems


Frankly, I can\'t see the advantage HTML would have over .pdf. For those
that cannot/will not use the .pdf, a plaintext version could be
supplied. Could you imagine trying to print a HTML version of a LBB? It
would look like a dog\'s breakfast. I hate scrolling through a long HTML
doc, or worse, linking through a folder of separate pages, even with a
ToC.

The customized java/java script tools could be provided by hyperlinking
within the .pdf to the file. Anyway, I think the whole idea of embedding
java tools is too ambitious for a project like this...

Final point: IM(ns)HO, it boils down to what the format was designed
for, and whether that meets the objective of a re-release project.

HTML: Distributed information across network, hyperlinking, device
independant browsing.

PDF: Electronic document publication, printing, local cross-platform
browsing.


Terribly sorry for being long-winded about this... I don\'t like it when
HTML is viewed as some sort of panacea. "Chuck it into HTML, everyone
can browse it, you can hyper-link it, it\'s active!" yadda yadda

Summary: Why HTML sucks:
- - Labour intensive. HTML tools are still in their infancy, any good word
processing or page layout tool can produce postscript faster and more
easily
- - Difficult to print it the way it was intended to look
- - Cumbersome to browse. Either everything has to be broken up in
separate files (labour again), you make lots of hyperlinks and indices
(ditto), or you scroooooll.
- - "Tags" get in the way

On problem which I don\'t think is well addressed is the fact that space 
weapons are designed to target and track objects 1000+ miles away. They 
need to be able to traverse very accurately and thus slowly, compared to 
to a vehicle mount which has to target bigger objects at very much closer 
range than space combat. Thus a G-carrier\'s mount would traverse quickly, 
and be pointed accuratley enough to have a reasonable chance to hit it\'s 
target.
In the scout vs. g-carrier scenario, the scout could get lucky if the 
carrier pilots are rookies, and down one, then he\'s dead meat. If the 
ship took off and got to a longer range, where it\'s mount\'s long 
distance accuracy counted for more, it could toast the beggars.

Hmmm, automatic hits? I don\'t think so. As soon as the G-Carriers are 
targeted by the ship\'s or turret sensors - they are going to evade - fast.

hope that helps,

Actually, I\'m pretty sure these were Marines assisting the DEA.  They
were fired upon.  Then gave a warning.  They were fired upon again,.
They fired a warning shot.  Then they were fired on again!  And then

But since Naval characters have Officer Flight School, and Amry grunts
have Officer Commando School, shouldn\'t the Marines have their own
specialized professional military school?  Something like Spaceborne
Combat School?  Studying such topics as Environmental or Zero-G combat,
boarding hostile vessels, repelling boarders, etc.  Perhaps:

Upon Graduation:  Environmental Combat, Boarding Tactics, enter Marines
at Rank 02

New Skill - Boarding Tactics:  The knowledge to secure hostile
spacecraft internally and defend from hostile boarding parties.  This
would involve locating critical systems in unknown ships, identifying
booby traps, etc., as well as isolating resistance.  In game mechanics,
it might function as initiative bonus.

A must for Marines and Pirates everywhere.

Cool. I\'ve got, funny enough, a Darrian TL-17 exploratory cruiser, called 
\'Far Traveller\' as an NPC in my current game. The PC\'s discovered the 
ship after a misjump, floating in the Trojan Reaches ever since she\'d 
misjumped herself to escape the Maghiz.

They got on board, started chatting to the ship, and then began to make 
decisions on her future all the whilst ignoring her prescence. When they 
made up their minds and gave her the orders she refused, stating that she 
was a Leutenant Commander in the Darrian Navy, and as the last surviving 
officer on the ship she\'d be the final decision maker.

Then they started treating her like a person and not a computer - she was 
very agreeable if treated well - not some cap-tugging AI simulation.

Her personality came across as a well read, amiable, and capable military 
officer - an Ivanova who wouldn\'t bite your head off on a bad day.

One of the PCs asked her what she\'d do when she was retired, after all - 
the ship would probably be scrapped. She replied that she\'d then be 
plugged into the Darrian World-Net, and really expand her horizons!

Yes, when I converted the MT imperial Encyclopedia, it took 45 min on the
photocopier, 1.5 hours to scan, and about 8-10 hours to go through clean up
and edit the OCRd  file in a Word Processor.

And that was before I started to think of hypertexting it!

Sadly, I couldn\'t find much of anything in the Texas and US Fed Law I
have access too.  There are laws on both Bounties and Rewards though
(omitted from my digests though, presumably because they haven\'t been
changed in a long time).  Bounties are authorized by the State
Legistlature for persons performing duties/services for the public good
- - but these are apparently specifically created.  Of some help are the
False Imprisonment laws which provide an affirmative defense for those
who \'lawfully\' detain or arrest people if there is sufficient probable
cause.  A warrant for arrest is probable cause (to be technical, you
need probable cause to obtain a warrant in the first place).

One digested case described an event in which a private citizen
(presumably a bounty hunter) kicked in the door of a fugitive\'s house
(without warning), "wrestled the fugitive to the floor" (read kicked the
shit out of), handcuffed him, dragged him out to his car and took him to
the police station.  The fugitive sued the bounty hunter in civil court
for false imprisonment.  The fugitive lost.

I think a mix of styles is about right.  Although, thousands of styles
might be created, its more likely that most off these would be
"anal-retentive" variations on several dominant schools.

This point is certainly true.  Several of the prominent films in the
last decade, and probably Star Wars too, that featured sword fighting
incorporate Kendo explicitly into the moves.  I\'m not a fencer myself,
but I\'ve seen several interviews with the fencing instructors to movie
sword fighters and they have said this.  Guess I\'ll have to watch the
Princess Bride again for what is surely the best film fencing scenes in
several decades.

"Why are you smiling?"
"Because I know something you don\'t know."
"And what is that?"
"I am not left-handed."

On a more serious note:  At higher TL\'s wouldn\'t it be likely that
swords of all sorts would be made of the best material around, as
opposed to plain ol\' steel?  What would a superdense claymore do
compared to a steel one?  And at what TL do we get the rapier that cuts
effortlessly though metal and stone?  12? 13?

Ask a *chemistry* buff, and the answer is H2 -- diatomic hydrogen, the
usual state of hydrogen at lowish temperatures and pressures.

If you ask a *physics* buff, the answer is 2 He 4 (think that order is
right -- anyway, \'normal\' helium, two protons and two neutrons).
Proton-proton fusion actually ends up involving four protons and yielding
a single helium nucleus.  

IIRC, the lightest viable helium nucleus is 2 He 3, with two protons and a
single neutron.

According to my lunchtime calculations, that\'s off by a factor of 10!  I

Yep! Slip of the finger, typing in bed in a hotel room on a laptop, etc,

Damn, I need to proof read more :)

Thanks for the page count and the bibliography search.  BTW, can I get a

I will look into this, but the best information so far is the number of
people willing to help. The best, most cost effective way IMHO is to
take advantage of those who are willing to help.

So far the best answer. 

I have not returned home, but enough people on this list have responded
to make me believe that this is ultimately possible. Grab a complete
collection of Traveller, ship it to some document company and get a cost
estimate. 

I have not heard from Marc.  Should we look into this anymore? Is
someone at IG going to take the ball and run with it?

It is a great resource for all kinds of ideas that
can be used in lower tech adventures.  

In addition, last January/February issue had quite a
bit of room dedicated to research into ftl transportation.
For instance, NASA has started an advanced projects
branch that deals only with finding possible methods to
break the lightspeed barrier.  The USAF has become 
involved as well, funding research by Rueda, Haisch, and
Puthoff.  These three men worked jointly on a paper 
published in 1994 that comes close to explaining gravity 
and inertia along with possible methods to control them.
Some of the other works being reviewed include Alcubierre\'s
Warp Drive (which just happens to use the same principles 
as described in the Rueda, Haisch, and Puthoff research).

Dr. Robert L. Forward (some of you may have heard of him),
has identified four experiments that could be done to test
the theory in Haisch\'s paper.  NASA and the USAF are allocating
grant money for researchers to run these tests and others.

Lets see, it\'s been eight years....?  Nope, still gotta
respond with the usual: If I tell you I have to kill you...

However, there are some very interesting historical 
writings in India concerning um, flying vehicles, including
the secrets required to keep them running.

Did you know that there is a Buddhist sect (Tendai) that
has believed that a man from the planet Venus came to us
in the past (don\'t know when) to save mankind?  He allegedly
travelled through time more than a million years....

Then for really interesting reading, check out Erich Von Daniken\'s
Chariot of the Gods.  Neat stuff to read and speculate about, 
but no way to prove.

So IMHO the Roswell ship was actually a derelict spacecraft
that finally reentered the atmosphere and crashed.  It was built
over 30,000 years ago, before the high tech society that created
it perished due to the onset of the latest ice age...

JPEG is not all that distructive if you are careful about how much
compression you allow.  When doing typesetting, we (my fellow workers
and the local graphic artist types) prefer TIF for the initial scans
(beacuse they are easy to work with) and generally produce EPS or
Illustrator 88 as the final product. (because they are vector formats,
and do not rasterize when resized within a document.)  Each file type
has its uses and drawbacks.  JPG is usually used when space is at a
premium (when isn\'t it?)  

My personal take on the cd is to use PDF or text.  I happen to prefer
PDF because I use it alot, and can appreciate its capabilities (if used
properly).  Text is acceptable, and just as useful.  All I want is the
material available for use in my homespun (read: heavily plagerized)
campaigns.

Sure do. But the scanner read lower case l (ell) as i (eye)  almost 100% of
the time. This was with relatively recent (bought within the last 6 months)
hardware and software borrowed for the occasion

A question: Are there no original manuscripts?

Much of Traveller was published before modern desktop publishing, so what
did the typesetters work off of? A typewritten, double-spaced manuscript is
*much* easier to OCR than a published work set in 8-11 pt. Helvetica.
Although you wouldn\'t have the formatting of the original books, the
information would still be there.

Which brings up the second question: What exactly do people want from this
project?

Some on this list seem to desire electronic carbon copies of all of the
books, complete with artwork, in .pdf or some other high-quality format
ready to output on their own desktop. Others seem to want only the
information in an easily accessable layout. This is a big issue when it
comes to cost. The better-looking you want the product, the more man-hours
are spent on creating it.

At the low end you simple scan in the text, OCR it, and then edit it (this
would take a little work). At the high end this would mean scanning it,
OCRing it, editing it, laying it out in Acrobat -- or better, Quark or
Pagemaker -- and then Distilling it to .pdf format (this would take a *lot*
of work).

BTW, the idea of saving the pages as 300 dpi images would probably be the
worst of both worlds -- even 300 dpi scans of text can look sloppy
(especially the small stuff), and not everyone is going to have OCR
software. Nor are a lot of people going to want to view this stuff onscreen
only (I wouldn\'t).

Of course, I am biased -- I tend to desire the information more than the
art and layout.

What is the classical definition of "AI" anyway? I am curious to know --
does it mean "thinks like us?" You mention that a non-AI cannot come up
with ideas not programmed into it. Does this mean that only AI systems can
generate novel, creative output?

The last two issues May/June and July/August had an interesting 2 part
article by Buzz Aldrin. It appears that he is involved with a company
called Star Boosters Incorporated that has a number of interesting
designs/plans to lower access to space costs.  There was also an
interesting article about a hybrid H2/O2 Fission rocket in the latest
issue.

Getting the magazine is worth the $20 yearly membership dues to belong to
NSS. As if supporting mankind\'s expansion into space isn\'t reason enough.

Yes, you are right. FFS laser sight are bit big and heavy, so it\'s not
usable on pistols.

My character have one on a (heavy) rifle. I assume the laser sight has a
tunable frequency so it can be from IR to NUV. Sure you nead a special
device to see the spot. But this weapon is build to be a snipper weapon, so
it\'s porvided with all the needed stuff (WSV helmet in the occasion).

     Obviously some people on this list know a lot more than me about the 
     history of fencing.  Reading some of the history, I\'m glad I only did

This gets into whats the popular style of Court blade?  Rapier, sabre,
katana, or gladius?  A mix?  Is rapier & main gauche \'sporting\' to use 
against katana?
     In modern fencing, it\'s only considered \'sporting\' for opponents to 
     have identical weapons (e.g. sabre versus sabre, or foil versus foil) 
     because longer weapons have a big advantage.

Well when are you going to make all these versions of the article
availale to those poor benighted souls who (unlike myself) do not have
Dragon #50.  I would venture to say that not only was this article the
definitive CT treatment of milk bottles but is bar none the finest
article on milk bottles I have ever seen for any RPG.  We really need to
have the stats in this article updated for T4 (and TNE, and MT) though. 
I shudder to think of all the Traveller referee\'s & players out there
trying to get along without this _the_ definitive article on milk
bottles. :)

    'body' => 'In my Traveller universe, sometime in the 1120s...

...there\'s a heavily damaged Kinunir-class ship from the Battle of 
the Two Suns still floating near the battlefield.  In the adventure I 
wrote, the PCs were looking for weapons to outfit a privateer to 
operate against the Vargr.  A rumour (or more accurately a covert 
DINI agent who\'s supporting the project unofficially) sent the 
PCs to the old battlefield, dodging unexploded ordnance and Imperial 
patrols, and eventually they found the ship.

To cut a long story short, the AI Yellow Streak blew the ship up out 
of sheer cowardice, then suffered severe remorse over the next forty 
years as it drifted, crippled, crew dead.  When the PCs find it it\'s 
a reformed character, desperate to prove itself, but doesn\'t bother 
to tell the PCs that it was responsible for the damage to the ship.
It calls itself "Blue Streak" to the PCs\' faces...

I have an early version of this adventure typed up, anyone 
interested?

It\'s too easy to control vermin on shipboard. Since all the "permanent"
fixtures have to be able to withstand exposure to vacuum (in case of
damage to the ship), that means that you can simply take out and
clean/fumigate the movable stuff and the things like curtains and
blankets, and de-pressurize the section you took them from. It\'d take
some pretty extra-ordinary critters to withstand a few hours of vacuum.

GIF allows for a *variable* sized color pallete. I have 2 color (black

you get with GIF is 256.

I may try scanning a few pages at work once we get the scanner back on

You mean nuclear physics, not chemistry! It\'s not a possible reaction.

> Would it be a lighter Helium isotope? (ie 2 He 2)

He2 isn\'t a possible isotope. 2 protons with with no neutrons will not
hold together as a nucleus.

"protium"	H1	1 proton	0 neutrons	stable
deuterium	H2	1 proton	1 neutron	stable
tritium		H3	1 proton	2 neutrons	short half life
Helium		He3	2 protons	1 neutron	stable?
Helium		He4	2 protons	2 neutrons	stable

The only reaction that works with only protium is 4 H1 -> 1 He4
And it\'s one of the harder reactions.

The scout ship can travel at hypersonic speeds. It routinely does so
when entering the atmosphere for landing. But it can\'t make rapid turns
at those speeds.

On the other hand, it is *more* than fast enough to overtake the
G-carriers, even throttled way back. And it\'s laser vastly outranges
theirs. (Think of a rowboat with machine guns vs a battleship. The
battleship can hit the rowboat at 20 miles, the rowboat is lucky to hit
at several hundred yards).

Sorry, won\'t work. At our *current* TL we can detect gas giants quite a
few parsecs away. Using spaceborne sensors we can do a lot better.

Also, there are rules about how far away "standard" ship\'s sensors can
spot a gas giant that date clear back to CT.

Star systems are *easily* located from more than a sector away using
astronomical gear, or "Survey" gear. Finding the gas giants will take a
few years worth of observations with a small scope, and that\'s only
because a small scope can\'t seperate the planet\'s from the glare of the
star. Get a one meter or bigger scope into space and you\'ll be able to
*see* the gas giants at quite a few parsecs.

JPEG is a "lossy" compression format. That means that the image created
by reading the file is missing some details that were in the original.
Hopefully these details are unimportant. But JPEG allows a *lot* of
loss if you set it that way.

    'body' => 'Many thanks to Commander X for reminding me about sabre fencing!  Can\'t
believe I forgot that...

        Dueling with sabres came into vogue during the early 18th century,
as most other sword types had fallen by the wayside due to the predominance
of firearms, and cultural changes amid the aristocracy in general.  The
sabre was a favored weapon of the cavalry, and was also worn by officers and
NCO\'s as badges of rank.  (Actually, to be precise, there were three
military sword types in use during this period- heavy, straight swords for
heavy cavalry units, sabres for light cavalry and dragoons, and long, thin,
straight swords for  infantry officers and NCO\'s.  The sabre was numerically
the most significant type.) 
        Sabre fencing style evolved from sabre combat tactics- every part of
the body is a valid target, including hands and feet, because cavalrymen
were taught that hands (reins) and feet (stirrups) could be incapacitating
attacks of a sort.  Sabre sport fencing also encourages making very
aggressive and forceful attacks- this comes from the fact that combat sabres
were cutting weapons that in general weren\'t kept much sharper than a table
knife, so a lot of force was required to deliver an effective blow.
        Now the point of all this is that a case could be made for the
Imperial military having their own systems of dueling.  Officers may opt to
duel with their issue swords, as appropriate to their status.  There could
well be a school of fencing devoted to the cutlass, which would be very
similar to sabre dueling, I expect.
        Of course, the military may not officially approve of its officers
killing one another when there are plenty of other fish to fry.  It depends
upon how the GM perceives the military and the aristocracy work together.
If the aristocracy is very influential in the military, then dueling (and a
lot of errant nonsense) might be the order of the day.  
        In my campaign, I preferred to view the Imperial aristocracy as
similar to the European nobility of the early 19th century- wealthy,
cultured, snotty, and bored witless.  Since dirtying their hands with
something so common as business or industry was downright obscene (they have
people to attend to such things), the only outlet for their ennui was to
embroil themselves in political intrigue or to put in some time in the
military.  Since the Empire required its planetary nobles to raise and
maintain local combat forces loyal to the Imperium, the aristocracy had a
lot of influence over military forces.  Commissions could be purchased
outright, and dueling was commonplace. 
        Sorry, I digress.  To get back to the original point, I would think
it quite valid for the Imperial military to have their own set of rules and
regulations regarding dueling, which would bind anyone under oath.

Your right, half remembered quotes from the TML are not a "good" source
for cannon (witness my belief that Marc said the Droyne HW was destroyed
vis what he actually said). Mayhap important bits of canon revealed on the
TML should be archived seperately somewhere? (now there\'s a nightmare for
someone).

Anyhow I went back in my archieves and found the relevant posts, which I\'ve
taken the liberty of reproducing below.

I agree.  I believe in the latest of Guns, Guns, Guns(3G^3) by Greg Porter 
details how to make these weapons out of advanced materials.  I would think 
the damage/penetration would be much higher than TL-1 material.  But mostly 
it would not break, dent, nick, or rust after battle.  Always keeping a 
sharp edge. Truly magical to a lower tech civilization.

Perhaps legendary swords like Excalabur, or the 7 Swords of Wayland were 
created from material procured from Vilani Scout/Merchants?  Maybe the 7 
mystical swords were created by Walaand of Vland with TL-10 or 11 material?

Having first referred to a "Classical Definition" I can only honestly
say...I don\'t really know what it is.  It is a comfort to me though that
probably any definition will have massive holes in it anyway.  So I\'ll
"make it up" (I did read some on this at different stages of my life.  I
was once a psych major after all).

There is a test called, I think, the Turing test which says that a computer
is intelligent (that is, artificially intelligent) if a human cannot
discriminate between the computer and a real person.  I think that\'s
hogwash myself.

I think we should look at the Traveller parameters for AI first.  AI
doesn\'t appear until TL 16 or 17 (I don\'t remember quite which) and has
serious stability problems at any lower level (as referred to in Robots,
Book 8, an excellent resource).  If the model of the game requires us here
an now to go through 6-8 more tech levels before we can achieve *true* AI,
then we are, according to that model, a long way from developing that kind
of technology.  Therefore our current "Expert" or well programmed systems
are nowhere near AI.

What\'s the point of that?  Well, I think we can assume a long period of
development of "really smart" systems that do not meet the AI test.

Ok Pete, come clean.  What is the AI test.

I hate using the word, but I will anyway, "Sentience".  An Artificially
Intelligent computer is concious.  It is aware of its own existance, and
aware of its being.  Only when a being (and it is a being when this barrier
is crossed) is aware of itself can it learn to recognize the causal effects
of its actions, and only then can that being rationally and independantly
predict what a certain action will accomplish, allowing it to come up with
an action or idea which it has never encountered before, nor been
programmed to recognize, and guess it\'s result.

Sentience is the quality, but creativity is the symptom of that quality.
Non-AI computers can be made to appear intelligent or creative, but only AI
machines can exceed their programming.

Ultimately, it is independant creativity outside the bounds of previous
experience (or programming) which determines intelligence.  Intelligence is
at its heart the ability to adapt through volition, as opposed to instinct,
to the environment.  I do not know if this can be programmed or integrated
into a computing structure at all, but that\'s part of Science Fiction,
right?

I imagine that we will find "fuzzy logic" to be at the heart of intelligent
thinking.  Usually, recognizably creative thought includes some "leap of
imagination" or so called "Eureka event".  This is when a thinker suddenly
sees the solution to a problem which she or he (or it) has been thinking
about.  This seems to often require the ability to think "outside the box",
or without regard to the usual parameters of the problem.

Ok, I\'ve rampbled long enough.

Pete

Here is a house rule I am toying with to generate a solar
system on-the-fly; i.e. when my group has blipped into a
system and need to know what it looks like (but I haven\'t
prepared anything).

1. Roll 1D times on the table below: once on row A; the remainder
   on row B:

	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9	10	11	12
- ----
A	----	pp-	p-p	-pp	pp-	S-p	p-p	-p-	--p	p-G	-Ag
B	pAp	-S-	ppg	-pg	pp-	-pp	p-p	-p-	--p	p-G	Agg

- - = empty orbit;  p = planet;  A = asteroid belt;  g = gas giant; S = star

Determine orbital distances and spectral classes from the 
following tables:

First Occupied Orbit:	1-3		4	5		6+
- ----
Stellar Type:		IV,V, or VI	III	II or D		I

First Gas Giant Orbit:	1-4	5-6	7-8	9-10		11+
- ----
Stellar Class:		M	K	G	F		(A)

Stellar Magnitude: # of planets + asteroid belts

Habitable Zone = if possible, 3 orbits in from the first
                 gas giant; otherwise, choose the middle 
                 orbit (might be empty!)

Far Companion: roll 2D: on a 2, roll a companion system at
	       1D x 1000au away.

Here is a house rule I am toying with to determine the relative
political strength of a world, and what kinds of nobility might
be expected to be present on said world.

World Political Strength: 
	TL(0-15+) 
	x Population(0-A)
    	x 2 if there is a naval base present.

Strong worlds will tend to have a strength rating above 200.

Here\'s how I divvy out the local nobility:

Strength	#Barons			Regional Seat?
- ----
0-24		0				
25-69		1 Patent Baron			
70-99		1	 		Barony
100-149		floor(Pop/2)		Barony
150+		Popul. Code		County
200+		Popul. Code		Marquisate
300+		Popul. Code		Duchy

On issues that call for world coalitions, one vote is given
per 50 units of power (fractions are rounded to the nearest
whole number of votes), usually cast by one of the barons.
Worlds with a Count are voting worlds; others must use a
less direct influence.

For you Classic Travellers, some sample numbers are:

World			Power	Votes
- ----
Efate			234	5
Extolay			160	3
Glisten			270	5
Inthe			126	
Lunion			234	5
Mora			300	6
Porozlo			110
Regina-Jenghe		214	4
Rhylanor		270	5
Risek			100


So, Efate has greater raw political pull than Regina.  However, it 
is located on the fringes of the Marches, and must not have the
natural resources Regina has.  Besides, everybody knows how unstable
Efate is, what with the recent rash of terrorism... so somebody must 
have decided that Regina is a safer capital... or someone greased the 
right wheels years back.

Suggestions would be welcome.

Here is a house rule I am toying with to determine the size
order-of-magnitude of a starport.  This helps me decide what
kind of facilities (or what grade or how much) are present
there.

Starport Size Rating =
	floor(The number of populated worlds within 2 parsecs / 3) 
        + (Starport Class: A=+2, B=+1, C=0, D=-1, E=-2)
      	+ floor(Tech Level / 4)
	+ 2 if there is a Naval Base.

Interpretation
- ----
A size rating is a relation to other size ratings by a factor of 2.
Thus, a size 3 starport is twice the size of a size 2 starport, and
a size 5 starport is eight times the size of a size 2 starport.  Wow!

So, the range of starports follow the relative trade-importance of a world:

  3 neighbor worlds, class D starport, TL4 world : starport class 1.
  6 neighbor worlds, class C starport, TL8 world : starport class 4.
  3 neighbor worlds, class A starport, TL8 world, Navy :    class 7.
  9 neighbor worlds, class D starport, TLC world :          class 6.

For you Classic Travellers, some sample numbers are:

World		Starport Size
- ----
Efate		9
Extolay		7
Glisten		10
Inthe		7
Lunion		9
Mora		9
Porozlo		5
Regina-Jenghe	9
Rhylanor	7
Risek		8

So, please note that even though Rhylanor has a superior technology
level (15), its starport is 25% the size of the Regina starport.
So, fewer ships call on Rhylanor.  Regina is a bigger trade center.

Efate and Regina have the same starport size.  Probably a greater
portion of Efate\'s starport complex is military, while Regina\'s is
probably more dedicated to commerce.

Suggestions would be welcome.

Here is a house rule I am toying with to allow players
to hack a world computer network, using the basic ideas
from Shadowrun with Traveller concepts.

These rules are not very solidified.  Suggestions would
be very helpful.

A hacker has the benefits of Computer skill and a 
specialised computer, for all practical purposes
a cyberdeck.  As a specialised computer, its
computational rating is +1 for grid-hacking.  The
size requirements of this deck makes its cost 
significantly higher than a regular computer of the
same TL and computational rating, but of a portable
size: say, 2-12kg.  Needless to say, there can\'t be
an unreasonable difference in weight between a deck
and a normal computer;  but something like this
ought to work:

Weight Ratio		Cost Ratio
Deck::Normal		Deck::Normal
- ----
1:1.4			 2:1
1:2			 4:1
1:2.7			 7:1
1:3			 9:1
1:3.4                   12:1
1:4			16:1
(maybe 1:4 is the upper limit)

A network has the benefits of connectivity, security,
and the world\'s TL.  Connectivity is (let\'s say) a
direct measure of the Law level of the world, and
provides additional protection to network security.
The greater security is compensated: the greater the
law level, the more networks are connected to the
Grid.  Security is based on the nature of the network.

So then, the base number for entering a node in a
network on a given world is:

  7
+ Hacker\'s computer skill
- - World\'s Law level
+ 1 if a civilian network
- - 1 if a telecom network
- - 2 if a government network
- - 3 if a military network

Roll that number or less and the hacker bypassed that
node\'s security and is in, or (if the hacker is in)
he has successfully executed a system command.

Okay, how many dice does the hacker roll?  

Dice: 4 
      + Node Computational Rating 
      - Deck Computational Rating.

Nodes
- ----
Grid nodes have specialised purposes and a certain
connectivity set:

Node Type	Class	Connectivity Class	Purpose
- ----
Direct Connect  I	N,S			Interface
Wireless Conn	I	N,S			Interface
Database	D	D,B,N			Distributed Data Warehouse
Bus		B	D,N,S			Intrasystem Data Pipe
Router		R	N			Intersystem Data Pipe
Processor	N	all			System and/or user tasks
Slave		S	I,B,N			Specialised system tasks

State Machine
- ----
Here is a state table to illustrate network navigation
steps:

State			Failure to bypass security leads to:
- ----
Data Access		[Protocol Match]
Computation Access	retry; [Protocol Match]
Protocol Match		[Security]
Security		System alert & [Intrusion Defense]
Intrusion Defense	Damage equal to world\'s law level?


Or something like that.

Again, suggestions, opinions and revisions would be
appreciated.

Good question.  Unfortunately, it\'s one that doesn\'t have an easy
answer.  The definition of "AI" is pretty much whatever you want it
to be.  Back in the old days, people used to say that FORTRAN was
AI, because it could solve mathematical problems.  Nowadays we like
to talk about expert systems, production systems and chess 
tournaments (yeah! Go IBM!).  

I know from the bio\'s posted a while back that at least one other 
person here on the list is better qualified than I to be talking 
about AI, but what the heck, it\'s Friday afternoon.  Abusive 
emails, near-c rocks etc to the address at the bottom of the 
message.

One possible definition of the research field that seems to 
fit the discussion going on here is from "Artificial Intelligence, 
2nd Ed" by Rich and Knight:

"Artificial intelligence (AI) is the study of how to make computers 
do things which, at the moment, people do better."

By this definition an artificially intelligent machine is one that
can do something as well as or better than a human can.  Perferably
in a field of endeavour that can be regarded as intellectually
challenging, but if you want to think of your washing machine as an
AI then feel free. 

What I\'m really trying to say here is that the definition of
artificial intelligence is entirely dependent on definition of
intelligence, and it is yet to be proved to my satisfaction that I
am "intelligent", let alone anyone or anything else.  The Turing
test may be a good benchmark, but only if you are building a
conversation machine.  A better thing for us to consider would be
the abilities of systems that call themselves artificially
intelligent, and go from there.

This thread started with the old quote about the Terrans using AI 
robots to crew their ships during the Interstellar Wars, yes?  And 
the resulting disagreement as to whether a they are true AI systems 
(and thus TL16-17) or not.  Well, it is my opinion that given 
appropriate conditions (money & people mostly) an "AI" crewmember is 
well within the reach of a TL12 civilisation.  

Justification?  In the late 1980\'s DARPA funded a project called the
\'Pilot\'s Associate\', goal - \'to define, design and demonstrate the
application of machine intelligence to the assistance of advanced
fighter aircraft pilots\'.  This technology has since moved on to the 
Rotorcraft Pilot\'s Associate program of the US Army, and now to the 
Crewmans Associate program, looking at applying AI decision making 
techniques to the army\'s future main battle tank.  If we are doing 
the research now, why shouldn\'t we be able to produce similar 
systems for starships in a couple of hundred years time?

The "classical" definition I\'m aware of, is called the "Turing Test".

You have two (relatively large) boxes. In one, put a human being. In
another, put a computer and a human being. Pass notes with questions
into the boxes. The human in box A. writes an answer and returns it
through a slot in the box. The human in box B writes the computer\'s
answer out and passes it through a slot in box B.

After a significant number of questions, if one cannot tell which box
holds the computer by the output of the two "boxes", the computer can be
regarded as being AI.

Well said!

I\'d like to add to that by saying that Marc told me (by phone, which has
the same limitations as canon over the net) just after I had finished
absorbing _Secret of the Ancients_.  It was Shionthy then, and it is
Shionthy now.

The point is that no matter how finely tuned any canon machine is, it
just _may_ not happen to match _reality_.  That is probably the best single
statement to describe the adaptive canon methodology I have only begun to
apply to the RoM tech level issue.

BTW, if you should doubt my word about _knowing_ the answer, a few of
us HIWG members were discussing it when we were putting together the
baseline sector data for _Regency Sourcebook_ (I did Spinward Marches),
and Mike Mikesh was shocked to find out that I _also_ knew what he knew.

Also, I dodged Volker\'s "hot needle of inquiry" by writing off as a joke
(which was the intent of mentioning it) my knowledge.  Afterall, I hadn\'t
followed the Shionthy Belt thread all the way through to see MM\'s 7/15
post.  Just my humble attempt at a spoiler destructor.

As your original post (see below) implied that the droyne homeworld was in
Yaskodray\'s pocket universe, _Secret of the Ancients_ does tell us which
systems were pinched off for Yaskodray\'s pocket, and Shionthy Belt is not
one of them.  The Shionthy Belt pocket is a _separate and different_
pocket universe entirely.

<FUN ASIDE>

As my campaign was based in the Rim (at the time of SoA), I got in on the
fun of pocket universes as follows.

I had some Ancients of my own variety for an adventure I had been writing
in anticipation of the SoA being released (again adaptive canon approach).

I entitled this adventure the "Gods of the Ancients" not to be outdone by
GDW <G>.  The Gel (rhymes with yell) were millions of years old and viewed
Humaniti especially of all the major races as their children.  The one Gel
(Aasmeer) that the players had met on a few past occasions, approached the
party and explained that a particularly foolish grandchild of Yaskodray had
pinched off a hot, massive young star into a "research" pocket universe.
Due to the "wrap-around" effects of pockets, the grandchild was not aware
that the eventual (and rapid) energy buildup within the pocket, from the
rather energetic star\'s output, would eventually result in an explosion
that would make a Type II Supernova look like faint flicker.

The party\'s mission:  flush the pocket universe into sub-space using the
Gel equilavent of a plunger, thereby temporarily reversing entropy, and
saving untold trillions of lives in this region of the galaxy.

The outcome: the pocket was at the "end" of the Great Rift in Vland
sector.  The Gel provided transportation through a network of something kind
of like the Jump tunnel in _Long Way Home_ with the help of some Gel-loyal
droyne, the players went into the pocket, defeated the droyne on the world
within, and came out with rather smallish handguns that were treated like
PGMP-13\'s!

I\'ve had this discussion in other contexts (point defence against 
missiles) on gdw-beta - maybe it should be a FAQ or something. The first
rule of laser weapons is very simple: Lasers Don\'t Miss.
(at least not until speed-of-light lag comes into effect.) It\'s 
*easy* to design a laser weapon where fine pointing of the laser is
done by a small,precise,fast steering mirror; such mirrors
can control positions to microarcseconds and slew over arcminutes in
milliseconds. (OVerall pointing is done with the big launch mirror,
which is much less precise bt can slew tens of degrees in a few 
seconds.) Fine tracking is done with a sensor (camera) that looks
right up along the exact same optical path as the laser will fire
along. Since the sensor uses light, and the laser beam is light,
they\'ll both follow the same path. If the G-carrier is on the
sensor when you pulse the laser, the laser pulse will hit it,
no matter how hard it tries to evade. Keeping the taqrget on the sensor
is also fairly easy; the sensr can run a closed control loop to move the steerin
g ,mirror to always
keep the target on the sensor.
The only way to not get hit is to be far enough away that
speed-of-light effects come into play, or to be out of line of sight.

This sounds complicated, but I\'ve seen very similar systems work
on astronomical adaptive optics systems - our fast steerng mirror
for the AO system my group at LLNL is building for the Keck telescope
will hold targets (stars) still to about a milliarcsecond - a 
0.1 mm error at 10 km ranges. It\'s also how the USAF\'s planned
airborne laser will work (with some other issues to do with 
atmospheric turbulence effects, since they need 300-km ranges.)

>From ambush, the PC\'s should be able to detect and lock up one G-carrier,
and fry it. THe second G-carrier then has to react and get into cover -
or out of the laser\'s arc of fire - before the laser gets its next
shot. That\'s the fun part.

off the pocket universe. For myself personally, I\'d much rather have
Eskayloyt still around somewhere intact (would make for one epic
adventure
to find it); but as far as the canon evidence goes, Shinothy was the
Droyne
Homeworld and it was destroyed when Yaskoydray created his pocket
universe
*******************************************

I think this situation makes the adventure to find Eskayloyt even more
epic....

Consider:

Eskayloyt was "pinched" off from the "real universe" some time ago with
the result of turning the remaining planets of the original system into
the Shionty Belt....or so is my understanding of what MM posted to the
TML in response to my initial question concerning the interdiction of
this area.  IIRC others on the list who have pontificated on this
question have stated that "pinching" is not as hard to do as "creating"
a pocket universe from scratch (i.e. the "cheaper, easier, more
economical way) and that Grandfather had generated pocket universes
using both methods in the past.  (If I have mistated this please do not
take offence....I am not stating that any of what I am saying IS WHAT
HAPPENED.......all I\'m saying is that it might be interesting it it did
happen this way.  Please do not call in the RCCC....My TL35RoMBD is
currently on the blink so I have no defenses from them right now)

Anyway, consider that maybe Eskayloyt was one of the early "pinching"
projects, or was done in a hurry, or was in some way performed under
less than ideal conditions (whatever those conditions may be).  I think
quite an interesting adventure could be constructed around the idea that
the "pinch" holding this PU is not perfect nor complete.....let the
several thousand years do the work that time offten does to things: 
show flaws that weren\'t apparent initially.  The "pinch" is weakening. 
The evidence for this is the appearence of antimatter in the system (as
predicted by the Lesser Handwaving Theory (and is is generally accepted
by the more heretical in the field that antimatter is emitted whenever
highly stressed space time begins to relax.  However these distinguished
gentlemen are also known to wait patiently each Halloween for the "great
pumpkin to rise from the pumpkin patch to....well you get the idea)  The
Greater Handwaving theory further predicts that if the point of origin
of this antimatter could be calculated, you would also know the weakest
point of the "pinch".  Looking through this point into the PU should be
possible once the "pinch" weakens sufficiently.  However, be aware that
even among those who hold the GHT to be true, there is a great deal of
diagreement on how much time elapses between the "looking glass" stage
and the CPF (complete pinch failure) stage.  When CPF occures Eskayloyt
would return to "our" universe....although no one is prepared to predict
how rough the ride will be....additionally you would not want to be
anywhere near the system when this happened.  There is even a fringe
group who beleive that this destabalization occurs (and has occured in
the past) every few thousand years....the pinch does not completely fail
it only weakens...almost to the point of non-existance....remains in
this state for a few years and then restablizes, returning Eakayloyt to
its PU.

As you have figured out I am very long winded.  I guess what I really
wanted to point out is that Eskayloyt was not destoyed, just made
inaccessable.  While desttoyed is pretty final, accessability is
something that is not so definite.  I may be wrong but I do not believe
that this violates any of the tenants of the RCCC (though their
doctrinal writing are so many...Is there anyone who is truly their
master?)  IMO finding where Eskayloyt should be and when we might see it
again could very well be a truely epic adventure.

Take it for what its worth.....

At higher TL the efficiency should increase, so I want to know how to

Well, that\'s slightly overstated - HST can\'t see gas giants, after all
(although that\'s partially dominated by surface ripples in the mirror - not
the big figure error, but ripples on the scale of the polishing machine;
considered acceptable in manufacture because planetfinding wasn\'t HST\'s 
purpose in life.) Still, with good atmosphere correction a 5-10m telescope
on the ground can see planets, so a TL9+ 5-10m sensor in orbit certainly can.
For a first cut, I would say that a T4 sensor can see gas giants out to 
a range of 2 parsecs*sensor rating (so a P4 can see gas giants at 8 parsecs);
this would be an Average task for a sensor operator and take 12 hours per
target system (but no matter how good the sensor operator there should 
always be a 1 in 6 chance or so of missing the planet because it\'s 
projected too close to the star or something.)

You can even detect earthlike planets with a really good spacebased
telescope; first cut I would let a T4 sensor detect earthlike planets out
to 1/2 parsec * sensor rating (so a P4 can see earthlikes at 2 parsecs);
this is a Hard task for a sensor operator and takes 100 hours per target
system.

This reminds me. Anyone interested in some of the GREATEST film fight
sequences of all time, bar none, run out and rent a copy of The Duellists.

Pre-Alien Ridley Scott film starring Keith Carradine and Harvey Kietel as
two napoleonic officers who fight what is esentially a 20 year long duel
(they keep getting interrupted, or fighting to a draw) They cover court
swords, mounted sabers, unmounted sabers (one of the most gruelling fight
scenes I\'ve ever seen) pistols, Epees, light sabers...

A great movie!

   I don\'t know about 3He2+n, but 4He2 + gammas will definitely work;
   even if 3He2+n yields energy, I suspect 4He2+gammas is more probable. 
   I believe that these secondary reactions are described in most
   accounts of the pp chain, so the summary is:
   	p+p+p+p -> 4He2 + e^+ + e^+ + \\nu + \\nu + \\gamma\'s

   See Leonard Ericson\'s previous post where he says basically the same
   thing.

I own one, like it a great deal, and would be interested in such software.

I am using a 120 with the 2.0 OS, and will upgrade when a version comes out
with back lighting, a faster processor, and a price tag of under $500.  I
may budge a bit if they add voice recognition.

I certainly hope at least some of them survived.  I can see not all doing
so, as once they are done, you can work from the films, the final copies,
and so on.  Further, much of this was old and out of print when GDW sank
under the waves, so some valuable things might have been lost.

Agreed.

I want the information.  Drawings are nice, but I can produce better sector
maps with my own mappers than those in the aliens modules (my opinion only,
of course), and I would profit more from being able to search the various
GDW items.  Just having a massive rumors collection would help my games along.

Weigh too much for the volume...

to get the effects of a greatsword/2hand claymore, it would be thinner, and
thus no better resistance, probably slightly more flimsy, and all in all,
no better, in order to be wielded as a claymore is wielded. OTOH, a man in
battledress (Augmented, for you T4ites), wielding a full SIZE claymore,
made of superdense, would probably be doing nearly 2-3x the damage, and cut
men up like butter... starting to make me think of Warhammer 40K....

> And at what TL do we get the rapier that cuts
>effortlessly though metal and stone?  12? 13?

I\'d put it around TL 17, where I put "Lightsabres" (field generated
magneto-gravitic-handwavamagic bottle and hot plasma)

The very Light, incredibly flexible without being limp, cross pattern (3-
or 4- edges) foil, I\'d put at about TL 13, with increased PEN, but not
damage, with a blade design that flakes so as to resharpen the edge when it
flakes... In one campaign, I allowed a player a foil that was actually a
mesh, with overlapping micro-scales that did just that... Incresed Pen by
2, damage by 1, but a crit fail resulted in nastiness to self.

Yes, it does. And fails to give the burst radius. I have the burst radii
(from striker I).. M= Values from the USP factor as radius or diameter (I\'m
not gonna look it up right now...); I did notice, though, that many ships
would be much larger than the 10 to 36m radii, and thus, would bbe capable
of taking the damage incurred. What I have done is rationalize MG\'s into
the MT Personal/Vehicular combat system by assuming base damage at "roll
made by 1+", and actual full bracketing at the "made by 8+" level, and
figuring said (full bracketing) damage is enough to destroy a craft of same
volume. Since MG\'s need no pen, they are assumed to always have a flat x1
from penetration. Disintigrators, BTW, would do approxamately double a MG
of same burst radius, IMHO. A simple, elegant, easy fix (although the maths
get interesting).

Full bracketing means putting aS much of your MG "Fireball" inside the
target as you possibly can.

BTW, source for SHips missiles being 15cm is _Special Supplement 3:
Missiles in Traveller_. 15cm x 100cm... I should use the 15cm warhead
values from MT Ref\'s manual.. but they only list even cm measurements, so
use a 14cm HEAP autocannon round for damage and Pen, with no atten, and use
special supp 3 to design and fly missiles.

I use the following:

        (Origional Price/20)*(10-Wear Value).

Thus, you lose 50% just for taking it out of the yards. Truly, tho\' this is
a base for negotiation, not a fixed final price. Roll on the Actual value
table, using the above formula to derive base value.

It is also covered in MT. Player\'s manual has stats for all covered ship 
weapons, except meson guns and disintigrators (i\'ve got a fix for that, 
will post once I triple check my maths while not in pain) and missiles, in 
the same formats as personal and support weapons. (Actually, for missiles,

- ----Quoted Material Follows----
 CRISIS OF \'99

   Albert Croale, in his book Almost Disaster presents a hypothesis that
   the Third Frontier War (979 to 986) occurred two centuries too late.
   After reviewing the progress of events in the spinward reaches of the
   Imperium from the antebellum period to the late seventh century,
   Croale then analyses the rise of the Psionics Institutes, their
   growing public acceptance, and their spreading power. Finally, he
   presents that a straight projection of events would predict a
   resurgence of the Outworld Coalition, increased hostilities, and a
   Third Frontier War.

   Instead, his hypothesis as stated in his book indicates that the
   Psionic Suppressions (800 to 826 and beyond) were a massive
   manipulation of the population of the Imperium, a form of
   psychohistory, intended to eliminate the power of the institutes.

   Preparations were ongoing for war, and the Imperium made
   representations of strength (in 799) to the Coalition. It backed down.

   But the pyschohistory project went wrong and resulted in widespread
   rejection of psionics as a whole within the Imperium to the point that
   even the government had difficulty in using the science of psionics
   for its official purposes.
   ----End Quoted Material----*

So the Institutes were not only public, but had "Power" until 799 at least.
Then, in a propaganda campaign that reminds me of a Tom Clancy plot line,
The Institutes quite suddenly became evil.

Can you say Hivers? or Elvis?  I wonder preciisely which Imperial organs
were behind this, if not all.  Or was Croale the lunatic conspiracy
theorist of his time?  Perhaps this is all speculative fiction rather than
fact, and the supressions were just a matter of time and circumstance.

The truth is out there...

There\'s a point about Dueling that no one has made yet, in many cultures
duels often weren\'t "to the death", but "to first blood", or even the
"first clash of blades."  The Duel\'s *purpose* also differed, but was
usually to satisfy the "honor" and test the character of the participants.. 
Putting yourself into a position where you *could* be killed was often
considered enough, and how well you reacted to the situation was more
important than how well you fought.  (Sir Leo was brave and unflinching,
even though he was facing a much more skilled opponent. For his part, Lord
Calvert disappointed us all by continuing to punish his opponent after it
was obvious to all that he was superior in skill.)

Somebody mentioned yesterday that in pistol duels the participants kept
reloading and firing until somebody was dead.  Not always! Sometimes it was
enough for each participant to fire a shot, and that was often into the
air.  (I might be remembering wrong, but didn\'t Alexander Hamilton fire
into the air, and instead of following suit Aaron Burr shot him dead? 
Isn\'t that part of the reason Burr was considered such a villain
afterwards?)

Duelists that *always* insisted on "duels to the death", depending on
culture, could be considered heros or villains.  I\'m reminded of the film
"The Duelist", where one character fought one duel after another against
another character until eventually, after several years of dueling, one of
them was killed.  BTW, the final duel in that movie was quite
interesting..it was basically you take some guns and I\'ll take some guns
and we\'ll stalk each other through the woods with no rules except we don\'t
stop until somebody dies.

Given the size and diversity of the Imperium (or the splintered environment
of my games), not only would fencing styles differ, so would dueling rules
and etiquette.  The PC better understand the local rules before making (or
accepting) a challenge, or she might find herself in an untentible
situation.

[big snip of some good ideas]

For hacking, I finally gave the following caveats;

To break into a computer system a character needs Intrusion as an enabling
skill.  Add 1 for each level of intrusion above 2 (using MT skill levels).

Tasks apon intruding were also skill related or enabled.  We found Admin
especially appropriate (Thought you\'d never need that skill, right?), but
also Forgery, Electronics, et al.  A rule of thumb is that just because you
can hack into a computer, doesn\'t mean you know how the organization does
business.

A character also needs at least a 2 in computer, and that\'s a minimum.

The relative tech level of the character and his equipment makes a big
difference.  In the end, I thought that a TL14 hacker (deck and skill)
should be able to "walk all over" a TL9- system assuming it is networked.
Of course, at that TL hacking into computers is much less useful than at
say TL12+.

Note that this means major corporations and gov\'ts on low tech worlds will
buy higher tech systems to protect their data, if they can afford it.

Hacker TL is the TL that the Computer Skill was earned at (Impy military
would use 14 or 15).

Computer TL is the TL the computer and software was manufactured at.

So;
For each TL difference between (lower of hacker or computer TL) and the
attacked system\'s TL give a DM to the task; + if hacker TL is higher, - if
lower, 0 if the same.

example;
Donny Claptrap is a hot hacker with a TL13 deck (computer) from a TL14
world.  He wants to hack the Navy Base Inventory computer (TL15, of
course).  He is hacking at TL13 (the computer\'s TL since its lower) so he
gets a -2 for *all* tasks.  He better have a good skill level.

Also, for each TL higher than the character his equipment is, DM -1.  This
doesn\'t apply to a hacker using lower tech equipment "Keyboard, How quaint."

I would also suggest looking for the Cyberpunk 2.0.2.0. rulebook, which has
pretty good rules, although it requires significant prep work.  Also the
Collectible Card Game Netrunner is adaptable to Traveller if you have
enough cards, and I have even written up some rules for adapting it if you
are interested.  email me privately if you are since its a long MS word
file and it has been posted before.

     How much is a second hand car?  I think you\'ll find a lot of difference

I like this a lot.  As a house rule, that is, not a "real" rule.

Missing Factors as I see it;
  Presence of Non-Navy base (scout base, scout way station, etc.)
  Planet is on an X-boat route
  Planet has a high population
  Planet is not an Imperial client (negative modifier for non-Imperial
planets or planets not members of an interstellar empire of some sort).

The problem is, one factor doubles the size of the starport, and I don\'t
think these factors (except perhaps population) would double the size, only
increase it incrementally.

Ok, but what is the actual size of the smallest starport?  At what point is
the starport orbital, and what is the tonnage of the orbital component?

We need acreage here! or tonnage!

In my Traveller universe, sometime in the 1120s...

...there\'s a heavily damaged Kinunir-class ship from the Battle of 
the Two Suns still floating near the battlefield.  In the adventure I 
wrote, the PCs were looking for weapons to outfit a privateer to 
operate against the Vargr.  A rumour (or more accurately a covert 
DINI agent who\'s supporting the project unofficially) sent the 
PCs to the old battlefield, dodging unexploded ordnance and Imperial 
patrols, and eventually they found the ship.

To cut a long story short, the AI Yellow Streak blew the ship up out 
of sheer cowardice, then suffered severe remorse over the next forty 
years as it drifted, crippled, crew dead.  When the PCs find it it\'s 
a reformed character, desperate to prove itself, but doesn\'t bother 
to tell the PCs that it was responsible for the damage to the ship.
It calls itself "Blue Streak" to the PCs\' faces...

I have an early version of this adventure typed up, anyone

My Comments:

You\'re using the populated world factor as a rough measure of the amount
of trade, yes? If that\'s the case, perhaps you should factor in the
population of *non interdicted* worlds within 2 parsecs.

The population of the world the starport is on should be a *very*
important factor. No way a backwater world with a few hundred sentients
has a large starport just because a bunch of worlds happen to be nearby.

I\'m not sure that a tech level factor makes sense. It seems to me that
higher tech planets would use more miniturization. If you\'re assuming
that higher tech means more trade and therefore more "floor space", then
the TL of nearby worlds should be important too... messy.

Also, trade codes (In, Po, Ri, etc.) might play some factor, since they
signify something special about the world that makes goods cheaper
(desirable to buy to sell elsewhere) or more expensive (desirable to
sell on the world), therefore generating more trade, and need for
warehouse space.

Here\'s my rough suggestion: (not "reality-checked" just of the top of
the ol\' noggin\')

Starport Size Rating =
    Population Digit - 5
  + (Starport Class: A=+3, B=+2, C=0, D=-2, E=-5)
  + (Sum of pop digits within 1 pc) /  4 (round down)
  + (Sum of pop digits within 2 pc) / 10 (round down)
  + Number of Trade Classifications
  + 2 if there is a Naval Base.

Less than zero rounds to 1. (Patch of bedrock size of a football field,
with a shack on the side functioning as a control tower... :)

I don\'t have my books with me to do some checks and see if the formula
is reasonable, I\'ll do so later. (This thread intrigues me...)

This Rating might give a wider range than yours, so one might want to
say that each difference in Rating is a x1.5, instead of x2.

Just some ideas.

- -- Glenn Hoppe 

PS. Remember that a world could easily have more than one starport. A
populated world could have several major ones scattered across the
globe. World Builders\' Handbook gave rules for this, iirc.

This is problematic depending on how difficult you imagine jump
astrogation to be mathematically.  The most difficult numerical
analysis problems today absolutely require supercomputers, for
speed and in some cases, parallelism, to effectively solve certain
problems (within a reasonable period of time).

If jump transitions are highly stable and predictable, they could 
be initiated by systems running fixed routines calibrated.  If 
jumpspace is an Ancients artifact, this could be the case.  I 
doubt it.  I expect jump physics and engiuneering will be "new" 
physics that will grow out of quantum gravitation, much as 
quantum mechnaics and relativity grew out of classical 
thermodynamics, mechanics, and electromagnetism.

Astrogation computers will need to be able to:

1) Rapidly measure and compensate for local conditions
2) Reference or directly measure destination conditions
3) Control jump drive power up, field initiation, and 	
4) Establish a local jump field (false vacuum?, hyperspace?)
5) Compensate for the effects of transition so that the jump field 
does not collapse prematurely

If calculations are required roughly one for each atom of a ship, steps 
1 and 2 could involve 10exp(30) calculations for a 100 ton ship in a 
very short period of time (say plank time).  That\'s faster than a 
pentium, even with the floating point error.

Only an IDIOT would use disintegrators, as described in Traveller,
in close combat.  They work (ostensibly) by neutralizing, that is 
NEGATING, the strong nuclear force between nucleons (not the true 
gluon-gluon force of which the "strong" nuclear force is but a 
residue).

The result of disintegrator use SHOULD be the catatrophic nuclear
detonation of the target, not just a Star Trek "warm white glow"
accompanied by a hissing sound.  Sorry, but imagine all the material
in a body becominging fissionable and unstable and supercritical in
a nanosecond.  

The operative word is "BANG!"

One\'s lasting contribution would be a very big hole in the local
geography which plate tectonics might erase after a few million years.
Quite a grave marker.

So then, those handy disintegrators the Ancients seem to use must be
in actuatity very advanced models which allow their targets to 
fission away at a controllable, not catastrophic rate without the
Chernobyl/TMI/Tunguska effects.

That\'s great!  I\'m reminded of a scene in Iain Banks\' "The Player of
Games," which I forcefully recommend (along with all his other stuff,
especially "Consider Phlebas" and "Use of Weapons") to all Trav people, SF
fans, and admirers of simply brilliant writing and plotting.  This is not
a spoiler, btw.

A representative of the Culture (very-high-tech sort-of-good-guys) is
speaking with an inhabitant of a lower-tech society.  The latter proposes
something you could accomplish using a high-tech starship, and the Culture
rep explains that first you\'d have to convince the ship to cooperate,
which wouldn\'t be likely to work.  The low-techer is flabbergasted.  "Your
starships think they are sentient???" he demands.  The Culture rep simply
replies, "A delusion shared by many of our human citizens." :)

I also join others in recommending Banks\' work as a source for the best
starship names ever seen in SF.  Favorite examples:  A 50-km intergalactic
starship with 250 million crew/residents named "So Much for Subtlety," and
a civilian craft converted for combat named "No More Mr. Nice Guy."
"Gunboat Diplomat" is also rather nice.  There are many *many* others.
READ HIS BOOKS.

The original poster never specified fusion.  He asked "all you chemistry
buffs" what happens when you combine two hydrogen atoms.  The *chemist\'s*
answer is what I gave above.  I went on to give the *physicist\'s* (fusion)

I would think you had to understand how germs worked before you could use it
as a weapon. The contaminated blankets were a case of well intentioned
ignorance (like most of the fatal interactions of European & Native
American) more than application of weapons. Most medical practitioners of
the time still did not believe the germ theory. That is why Eastern towns
would still have outbreaks of cholera & dysentery. 

You need enough of a tech level to understand the source and transmission
mechanism of disease before you can use it as a weapon. Would consider a 6
for a 5 tech level, due to chemical means like Chlorine & such, but nothing
much before that.

Actually, I\'ve seen in several places that \'common\' areas, such as halls,
dining rooms, etc, are carved out of the stated systems volumes, ie: A
stateroom listed at 4Td doesn\'t use all of it...some is part of the common
area allotment.

That\'s how I did the layouts for my YugoShips designs on my web pages.
Then with the block diagrams in hand I did the final layouts, adding the
details and carving out the common areas out the the leftover spaces.

Thanks. I downloaded the templates and the program and will try them

A superdense claymore would tend to do one thing... not break!  Harder
and tougher materials may be able to hold an edge better, but it still
takes a LOAD of force to drive a cutting surface through metal or
stone.  
(whirring and clicking as I switch to gearhead mode)

Acording to Kalpakigian\'s engineer\'s handbook,  the specific energy
required to cut through just plain ole steel is around 5 Joules per
cubic milimeter.  This means that you need roughly five (actually
between 2.7 and 9.3, depending on the alloy) joules of energy per cubic
milimeter removed (or sliced through) in the cut.  Assuming that the
average SMALL claymore is around one meter long (rough guess) and that
the cut passes through a SHALLOW path of about 50 cm... and the blade is
roughly 1.5 cm wide... a cut of roughly 75,000 cubic milimeters of
material are displaced.  You need a third of a MegaJoule to acomplish
this.  (this is ignoring friction btw.)  Machines get away with it by
applying the energy slowly (less power requred).  A swing applies all of
its force at once.

I would probably apply some benefits to the material (doesn\'t rust,
break, or go dull).  But I don\'t think that any NORMAL character will
ever cut through any hard material in this fashion.  (Cyborgs and other
odd technological oddities might make up for this though.)  

(Whirr... click...)

Sorry, must be the summer break... all those engineering classes have an
odd effect on those of  us who must put more important persuits (like
games) for the sake of classes.

Marc, Simon,

I totally agree with Simon\'s evaluation of the likely size of computers
in starships. The refinery I work in a a moderate size 150,000 - 170,000
barrels of crude through put. It is run (under minimal, as I \'ll discuss
in a couple of lines, human control) by a Hewlett/Packard TDC 3000 DCS
system, very simulair to the on e Simon discribed in hs post. In our
case the DCS operates everything from The boilers to the motor operated
valves, including power distribution from 2 steam powered 15 megawatt
generators and a 30 meg gas poweredd generator. The DCS system is housed
in a climate controlled room, with about 10-15 satellite buildings
(houseing slave processors to the Primary DCS, our refinery covers 80
acres so signal loss and tielag are a factor even with fiber optics).
Human control of the refinery is taken care of by a minimuim (night
crew) of 7 Console supervisors each running a multi-screen display that
represents the unit(s) under their direct control, there are also 1-4
unit operators at each unit to preform non automated tasks, contacted by
radio. During the day shift there is also a staff of approximately 10
programers and 3 technicians that work to keep everything operating
smoothly.

So I again say a that I don\'t disagree with the size of the computers. I
DO disagree with the flexability as stated in the rules! When operating
in Advanced Controls, the TDC 3000 we are using will make minute
corrections to the operations of each of those units (ie temperature
adjustments to boilers, flow corrections, blending regulation, etc.) to
maintain product specification at maximuim effecency. This (in effect)
one system working through multiple teminals. Yet in Traveller (T4, book
1) , your required  to install seperated software for each ship\'s
battery, or use a single copy of the software per battery per turn.

Also my comments were aimed more at the CT version, (which I am more
familiar with) which had only one PROGRAM operable at one time! and at
(if my calculations are correct) even larger volume per computer.

This has always led me to treat the computers in Traveller as "dumb
calculators". Since reading some of the posts to the TML, in spacific
the Darrians and AI, I see that I have been in the minority. Many of
these posts have made me rethink my position adn future adventures will
reflect a more flexible computing system. However, I would still like to
see an expansion set based around computers, their operations and
capabilities, not only for ships but for world nets etc. The CSC seems
to have some advanced rules for personal computeing but these do not
cover the networks.

Thanks

I\'ve created a Visio 4.0 template for some some common rooms and fixtures
that would be on deckplans. It\'s almost 500k, so I won\'t send it to the
list, but if anybody wants a copy let me know.

In my first Traveller campaign the starships also had AI computers and ran
themselves. In fact, many commercial and pleasure ships had no one on board
who knew how to run the ship; the crew handled passengers and cargo and the
captain ordered the ship what to do. Warships were completely automated and
couldn\'t even carry a single person. I was using the basic rules (not High
Guard) and in my campaign starships were used as a kind of expensive scene
change to simply move characters from place to place. AIs were also
powerful NPCs, with superhuman knowledge and intelligence.

In my current campaign there is no AI at all; ships carry large crews of
specialized personnel and people make all the business, combat, and
exploration decisions.

Why the change? Two reasons. First, I discovered that the established
Traveller rules did not have AIs and needed large starship crews. While I
regularly ignore rules I disagree with, I wanted to make my campaign
consistent with that of another GM\'s and I wanted to be able to use
published designs and adventures.

The second reason was that having powerful AIs tended to harm enjoyment of
the game. Since space combat (in my first campaign) was run by computers
and could be over in a fraction of a second, players were reduced to
sitting helplessly while their fates were determined by some die rolls.
This was very undramatic. AIs were very expensive, so wealthy governments
and corporations had an enormous advantage over individuals like the
players. In effect, AIs reduced the range of events the players could
contribute meaningfully to.

Also, with AIs running ships and institutions, players tended to simply ask
the computer about how to resolve problems. This was also counterproductive
to role-playing.

The answer, for me, was to severly reduce the capabilities of computers. In
my current campaign computers are powerful tools but starships,
corporations, and battles are all run by living beings.

The way I rationalize this in the game is to claim that intelligence and
creativity are noncomputable functions. As with the Halting problem, there
is no way a computer can even in theory replace a human (or whatever)
brain. Brains can do these noncomputable functions because of quantum
effects in biological cells, and any technological duplication of these
effects would result in a brain, not a computer, with all kinds of
nondeterministic behavior and idiosyncratic personalities. This is
basically the claim in Roger Penrose\'s "The Emperor\'s New Mind." Now I
realised than Penrose\'s theories are rather controversial, in fact I don\'t
believe them myself, but I can use them to put people into the dominant
role in my Traveller game.

I use various things (Visio, Some-kind-of-Cadd, Corel Draw), but end up
doing a lot of it by hand and then scanning the results in.

>How big should a bed icon be in T4 deck squares?( 2m ea)

That depends on the bed. ;-> I put "twin sized" beds (1x2m) in small cabins
and small staterooms, but they either fold up against the wall or are dual
purpose couch/bed futon-like things. In medium and large staterooms where
you are more likely to have 2/bed I install "queen sized" beds (1.5x2m).
Only in the large staterooms are these true beds, otherwise they are the
futon-like things.  

For PC sized ships, I use 1x1x3.5m (1/4ton) cubes for detailed plans, and
2x2x3.5m (1ton) cubes for summary plans. My scale for detailed plans is
200x1 (5mm to 1m), that gives you about 40x50m on a letter sized sheet of
paper.

>And I still have problems getting all of the equipment to fit into the

It *won\'t* fit! ;-> Just do the best you can.

Well, you\'re supposed to do that with staterooms, but not the rest, from my
understanding.  The stuff that goes on the bridge supplies the extra
walking around room there. The stuff that goes into engineering supplies
the working and walking room. Frankly, there just isn\'t enough room
alocated to living area, IMO, so I just add more.

>((that actually would work... if I do the rough outline of the ship decks
>and block off areas for a purpose, like a stateroom or reactor... hmm)

Actually, my prefered way of doing a ship is the draw the rough deckplan
showing the volumes of the living areas, engine rooms, bridge, cargo holes,
fuel tankage, etc, etc and then build a ship with a volume that will hold
it all.  I know that\'s backwards (start with the hull volume and stuff the
parts in), but it makes more sense to me to start with the parts and then
build a hull around them.

>I know all of this will be answered with the NAH, but I want to map my Lab

We can only hope! ;-> That\'s one reason I\'ve been dragging my feet on
deckplans. So when is NAH hitting the stores?  Heck! When is FFS/2 actually
going to be released?

	Actually, modern sport fencing (decending from the smallsword)

	Actually, the chainmail glove (guanto di pressa ?) was a Spanish
innovation.  The Italians were known to fight with a single weapon just as
much as with a secondard blade.  I always liked the Anglo-French
sword-and-lantern convention myself <g>.

	This sounds like a reconstruction.  The Spanish style from the
16-18th century was the Destreza, which was a circular style with 12
angles of attack.  It was a single blade style.  The Spanish system had a
LOT of foreign critics, but there some pretty good fencers from Spain...

	There was alos a wonderful "Highland Broadsword" and shield style

If you wanted to get way too rulesey with this whole process, one could
design a little chart that modified the sensor roll based on the size of
the star in the system. A small type M star would hardly be likely to
"drown out" any Gas Giants in the system while a type O supergiant may kick
out a lot of energy and litteraly dwarf Gas Giants in nearby orbits. Double
and Triple star systems would complicate matters even further. The range in
difficultly may remain the same (or in certain extreme circumstances be
raised), but DMs would add detail to what should be more than a simple die
roll. As a matter of fact, I would even consider this whole process as a
possibility for interesting adventure situations.

After all, stars are people too. :)

I\'m a lurker and a newbie to this mail-forum and am clearly at risk of
jumping into the middle of a discussion in which I don\'t have much
background or history...

HISTORICAL BIO - Blah, blah, blah. 
- ----
I was a big wargame and RPG fanatic going to all the conventions when I was
a teenager and into my college years where I studied physics and electrical
engineering.  To give you some idea, I owned all the SPI and Avalon Hill
games, I have a complete Strategic Review and Dragon Magazine collection up
through the early 80\'s, GURPS, etc. I\'m pretty confident that I still have
a pretty complete set of all the Traveller materials that were released
from numerous sources up through that time period as well. I began my
gaming in 73\' and faded out around 83. The risk factor here is that my
younger brother (10 years younger) who also really got into gaming (and is
still involved in non-science fiction RPG\'s) may have subsequently munged
through my collections of stuff.

I was located in Maryland, and have since moved to the West Coast. If I get
more into this group and this CD effort makes those materials useful to
your CD project, I could ask my younger brother to dig through my old stuff
at my parent\'s place and see if these old materials are lost or not. 

These days I am the president and founder of a software company that
produces software development tools, specifically a Smalltalk language
(Interactive Development Environment) product.  I\'m still an avid Science
Fiction fan which is why my wife ordered me a subscription to the SciFi
channel magazine "Science Fiction Age".  I was perusing the latest issue
reading about various stuff including Babylon 5 which is quite popular in
our company when I saw the inside front cover advertisement for
"Traveller". Fascinated that the game was being advertised and seemed to
have a lot of new titles I got curious and started checking out the web
sites on Traveller. In the intervening week or so I think I have looked
carefully at more than half of the Traveller Web-Ring\'s sites. 

I was impressed with the Artwork available and the Community that seems to
exist around the current IG T4 product.  I was also quite curious how Marc
Miller is doing these days and what he is really up to?  

Why is all this dialogue relevant? Well, I have been looking for a fun and
distracting hobby and thought I would see if an RPG like Traveller would
fit the bill for a few hours of time a week.  I am still pondering this
notion and would probably be more inclined in this direction if I found
some players or a gaming group in the Bay Area (San Mateo/Silicon Valley)
of San Francisco. 

Ironically enough, the reason I got into computers was because I got really
tired (as a gamemaster) of managing all the "administrivia" of gaming
mechanics and wanted to use computers to make tools to enable me to focus
on the gaming.  These days I have tools and capabilities I never even
dreamed of when I was gaming.  Who knows, given my old dreams of writing a
really cool gaming tool I may even find some time to write a few goodies
myself (but first I want to see what\'s around and make sure that my
activities aren\'t going to affect someone else\'s hard earned and probably
more dedicated efforts).

INTERESTING AND RELEVANT STUFF
- ----
Ok, so that was long winded but maybe it will help garner an invitation to
join some Traveller gaming group?

The intervening years since my gaming days have wrought many changes for me
and one that might be of some benefit in this discussion thread is in the
area of CD ROM production and software titles.  My company has produced a
number of CD ROM\'s in cross-platform formats and thus I have access to that
skill set and also the hardware and software required.

I don\'t know if what I am going to say is valuable but hopefully it won\'t
hurt <g>. At the risk of being redundant with regard to previous forum
discussions, here is a short (scratch that, it is now a long) take on my
experience with the mechanics and cost of CD ROM production and related
issues.

o  CD Blanks for one-off\'s cost around $3.50 depending on where and
   how you buy them. If you don\'t shop around then they typically
   cost $9 - $12 each.

o  CD Burners for one-off\'s cost around $450 these days for a 2x SCSI 
   burner. We\'ve got a number of burners in various speeds up to 6x.  
   Most of the burners come with software for one-off mastering.  If you 
   have a choice and you need to be cross platform, then do your production 
   work on a Macintosh.  The Win95/NT platform tools don\'t have Mac
   support but the Mac tools do have Win32 support.

o  It takes about 10-20 minutes to burn a complete one-off CD of
   some 500+ MB. I think it is highly unlikely that the 3000 to
   4000 pages of material being talked about would fill and entire
   CD if it was in a PDF/HTML/Text form.  It\'s the artwork files of 
   JPEG or GIF that will chew up the space quickly. The files 
   could also be maintained in a compressed form on the CD. Alternatively,
   The CD ROM product with two CD\'s could be produced for less than
   double the production cost of a single CD. Search/tools software and 
   its database indexes might also chew up quite a bit of space depending 
   on how they were produced.

o  It is pretty straightforward to prep a single CD that has a dual 
   format suitable for use on both Mac and Win32 (long filenames).
   This format preserves the Mac niceties of data and resource forks.  
   You can also easily add autorun features for both Mac and Win32.  
   (i.e., it launches some software when the CD is inserted into the 
   CD drive).

o  I didn\'t mention it above but my company has also been actively
   involved in DVD (digital video disk) software tools. We have 
   been working on a number of facilities under contract to an
   unnamed source and have experience there too. Although I suspect
   that for mass (gamer) appeal that technology is a few years away.

o  It takes a minimum of 3 days to "turn" a run of CD\'s from a
   "burned" one-off CD.  The typical timeframe is more on the
   order of 5-10 business days if you don\'t want to pay extra
   for a rush job.

o  The process involves providing your one-off CD from which a
   glass master is produced for the actual CD run.  You pay a
   fixed cost for the glass master and then a unit cost per/CD
   that depends on quantity produced.

o  There are a variety of options in packaging a CD from Jewel
   case to Tyvex sleeves.

o  The amazing element is that you can get up to 32 pages of
   color material in a CD insert booklet for dirt cheap.  Some 
   vendors limit you to 28 pages.

o  The other factor in producing a CD is the cost for artwork
   and the film used for the CD insert and booklet. 

o  Given all the above elements, a 1000 piece run with a 28 page
   color booklet could be set up and produced start-to-finish in 
   about 1 month (including time for the testing, artwork, film, 
   and CD pressing). The cost would range around $2000 to $3500 
   for the combination of the film and the CD pressing of 1000 
   CD\'s with Jewel cases, inserts, booklets in a shrink wrap
   form. [The big cost missing here is the "labor" of prepping
   the CD and its content, as well as the graphic arts labor.
   If the talent for that was volunteered by this group, as
   it appears that it would be, then the cost is pretty low].
   I.e., For comparison, a complete set of the new Traveller
   game aids available from IG is around $600 based on my quick
   look at the price sheets. I hope they\'re doing ok; I know
   that when I make IG T4 game aid purchases, I\'ll purchase
   directly from them to help them get the extra margin. I 
   would really hope that folks would let IG sell the CD ROM
   for a healthy price, they are in business and their making 
   a profit is obviously important for the health and well-being 
   of the Traveller game.

o  I noticed discussion on file-formats for encoding elements.
   My experience is that JPEG and GIF are your best choices
   for both cross platform and size.  I would not recommend
   either for textual content; they are both excellent for 
   graphics.  JPEG has the best compression and quality but
   it lacks the ability to have animation or non-rectangular
   images.  GIF can contain animations and artwork that
   overlays on a page with transparency (non-rectangular 
   images). There are many good tools (including shareware)
   that enable these images to be easily encoded using color 
   palettes that display well on Mac and Win32 machines with 
   only 8-bit (256 color) displays.

o  We have distributed our product documentation in .PDF and
   found that there were two distinct groups of customers/users.
   Those who loved it and had no problems with Acrobat and those
   who hated the reader and found Acrobat to be problematic on
   their machines since its installer\'s appeared to mess up
   their system configurations. [This is both Mac and Win32].

o  I personally like .PDF but find that it is equally valuable
   to have HTML and Text.  I think the decision to provide 
   documents in all three formats is going to be important 
   given the wide range of "uses" I presumed after reading the 
   20 or so postings related to this Traveller CD ROM topic.

o  PDF is cool because it enables book/quality reproduction
   and printing. It\'s browser is good for some folks but leaves
   a bit to be desired when compared to HTML/Web based 
   browsing or a custom software tool for searching and
   serving up formatted data.

o  HTML is cool because it enables integration of graphics
   and sound with a hypertext navigation system.  You can
   also use a variety of tools to provide auto-generated
   HTML or interactive tools in an HTML format.  (I.e.,
   Java and <grin> products like ours that can serve and
   generate HTML on the fly).

o  Text is cool because it is a clean format for software
   that would use it for tables and serving up data in a
   variety of forms. I.e., it is the best format to release
   information in for use in making software utilities and
   for re-use in authoring of new content (gaming aids,
   campaigns and adventure scenarios).

o  I personally don\'t have a lot of experience with OCR
   from typeset/DTP\'ed sources.  I suspect that the comments
   from another fellow "lurker" on this topic were accurate
   in that it has been my experience that typeface and
   the typesize of the source material make a tremendous
   difference in the quality of the generated result.  I
   would also agree with the same lurker that at least some
   of the original materials are still around on someone\'s 
   computer in electronic formats.  I also have found that 
   hiring people to type in textual material is not particularly
   expensive and can be a lot more cost effective than
   OCR efforts. In any case aggressive use of good spell 
   checker tools and the services of a professional indexer
   will almost certainly be invaluable to the success of the
   end resulting material. My limited experience was that the 
   tables were the toughest element.  Graphics like ship deck 
   plans or artwork would seem to be the aspect where scanning 
   was essential.

Valley area with Traveller interests. Also interested in e-mail, or better
yet an IRC/chat based game.

Um, we have a 2.4 m telescope in space right now, and I haven\'t seen a
flood of results finding gas giants out to a few parsecs.  A few
gas-giant like objects where they shouldn\'t be, yes, although I\'m not
sure that was using space-based observations.

Its a weekend,so I can\'t be bothered working this out, but I think
things are a bit more involved than that.  Current plans for looking
for extra-solar planets (in a serious way) require a multi-element
interferometer (to get the spacial resolution) operating in the IR (to
separate planets from stars) and placed in space (because its IR).
This technology is about cutting edge TL 9, so it is clear that the
Imperium will be able to survey a sector for star systems probably to
the limit of a sector from one point.  Of course, they also have the
advantage of being able to build an interferometer in more than one
place, which is sure to help.

	have you seen how many computers a modern freighter has.

	e.G.: a Finnish 17999er chartered for celulose for 5 years
	requires only a crew of 6 (they currently have 12 because
	of Finnish union). 17999 would be 1800 Traveller displacement
	tons. This ship probately had more computers and electronic
	than staterooms said Alex who was on this ship for one year.

	So we should not lower computer size but greatly reduce crew
	on civilian ships.

	Ok lets look at TNE :

			G	G-Hour	Jump	using all fuel
	Scout		2	40	2	56
	Far Trader	1	24	2	40
	Free Trader	1	28	1	40
	Yacht		4	16	4	44

	Patrol Cruiser	4	30	3	52
	SDB		4	60
	Merchant	1	30	1	41
	Donosev		2	57	2	79
	Liner		3	38	1	60
	Broadsword	1	53	1	64

	Be cautius that in TNE all ships had HEPlaR, and that T4 uses
	CT calculations for jump fuel. Calculations for HEPlaR stay
	the same.

	CT/T4 : Jumpfuel = Displacement*Parsec/10
	MT/TNE: Jumpfuel = Displacement*Parsec*(N+1)/20		IIRC ;-)
	        where N is the maximum jump number

	Hm truster plates are 4 times cheaper in T4 than in TNE, and
	4 times more expensive than in MT where they are calculated
	quite different.

	Are jump drives and thusters realy identical from CT and T4.

To first order, the luminosity of the primary star doesn\'t matter, since the 
luminosity of the planet scales with the luminosity of the star (a brighter
star means that the planet has more light to reflect, and gets hotter and
emits more thermal radiation too.) Second-order effects (changes in spectral
shape of the planet, 1/r^2 vs 1/r^11/3 dependence for scattered light, 
and photon noise) actually favour the bright stars somewhat (the simulations
my group does indicate, for example, that we could see a uranus-like planet
around sirius but not around a equivalently-distant M-dwarf.) So it\'s probably
not worth the complexity of a table (I don\'t get paid to make tables.)

	Ugh.  This thread is giving me Durandal flashbacks.  For those of
you who haven\'t played Marathon, Marathon 2, and Marathon: Infinity until
you\'ve had an irresistible urge to shoot people wearing green and
hallucinated little red and green motion-detector polygons in the
lower-left-hand corner of your vision, the thought of a completely obedient
as opposed to totally rampant AI ought to be anything but boring..:).

	It won\'t insult you, berate you, kidnap you, abuse you, run you
through behavioural experiments involving lots of heavily armed hostile
aliens, and then kidnap you again and use you as a flunky in a convoluted
plot to overthrow an alien civilization (which for some reason involves
beaming you alone and with insufficient ammo into places crammed to the
gills with more heavily armed hostile aliens) all the while subjecting you
to its incredibly egotistical and sarcastic sense of humour.

	In fact, the only thing worse than a ship run by Durandal would be
a ship run by Tycho, his archenemy AI.  They sort\'ve make a Bad
Cop/AntiChrist team with Durandal as a Bad Cop.

	OBTrav: check out the Marathon games if you haven\'t already.
There\'s lots there for a Trav game...

I don\'t know -- have experiments been done with cockroaches?  Lots of
arthropods can survive underwater for very long periods of time, so it
wouldn\'t surprise me if they could withstand vaccuum as well.

I seem to recall reading one story (H. Beam Piper paratime
story?) where the rules were somewhat more flexible - in one
scene, the terms were "twenty rounds, twenty meters, fire at will
after the signal".  Our Hero needed one shot to win.  I would
suggest that you can modify rules, customs, protocols, et cetera
to suit the needs of your campaign.

It\'s fairly obvious that there was a wide variety of styles;
again, this would appear to be a place where you have the
flexibility to set the rules to whatever would be best for the
needs of your campaign.  Also note that there are other weapons
beside traditional swords or guns; consider, for example, what
the rules and protocols for a Klingon duel with betleHmey
(bat\'telhs, those double-ended large Klingon weapons) would need
to be, to fit the culture.  Then consider how different a duel
with Daqtaghmey (Daktag, the knife with the small blades that pop
out from the side of the hilt) would necessarily be.

=46or your particular campaign, you\'ve said that you\'ve decided on
swords.  What kind of swords?  Foils?  Cutlasses?  Broadswords?
Sabres?  Scimitars?  Long Swords?  Short Swords?  Something else
entirely?  What are the fighting techniques that you would need
to use with the weapon?  What are the allowable target areas?
Does anything change in a blood duel versus a touch duel versus a
death duel?  How constrained is the Code Duello?  Can the party
with choice of weapon choose other than the "standard" weapons
form, or change the conditions under which they shall be used?
Does material make a difference in technique (probably; weight
and balance may be different; so too the response of the weapon
to different kinds of impact)?  In short, _what_else_can_you_

In Highguard only 2 tons out of the allocated 4 tons is actually used for
staterooms, the rest being used for corridors, recreation areas etc. (But
presumably not access areas in Engineering etc - I took part of the
drive/powerplant volumes to be for this.)

This always seemed to work pretty well - eg. Even on a Scout with 4
staterooms this gives you approx. 36 m2 of floor area.  This should be plenty
when you consider that space would be at a premium on starships and
floorplans would be designed to minimize space taken up by corridors. (eg
Access to the bridge, all staerooms, engine room etc could all be off the
main living/recreation area on a small ship - hence virtually no corridor
space required.)  Of course yachts etc would be a different matter - take as
much space as you like.

I\'d also tend to have even less free space on some military ships - warships
with free areas as cramped as today submarines would certainly be possible.
(And this is a fair analogy as people live on submarines for months at a
time.)

Not to get into a platform debate, but Apple is NOT the only source for a
Newton development environment. There is also a product called NS-Basic
available shareware. Last I knew, Turbo-Pascal wasn\'t free either...

Finally, Apple DOES have a version of the Newton Toolkit available free on
their web site. There are limitations to the package, and you can\'t sell
programs written with it legally, but it\'s free for the download.

It was produced by DGP, and contained two three panel GM\'s screens (which
explained the MT combat system properly), an adventure with links to
Knightfall (very subtle..), and a set of common components/equipment on the
same forms as used in the MTJ and TD.

Say a xenomorph with a three stage lifecycle, starting with an egg, then a
spiderlike stage with a long tail that impregnates victims with the last
stage, a very nasty adult form. We could make it very nasty by giving it
acid for blood, as well as the vacuum immunity.

\'Excession\' is also superb (it deals with the plot from the perspective of
the ships AI\'s).

I second Craig\'s recommendations on Banks - his normal novels are also
gripping. (Wasp Factory is a very grim, but strangely gripping almost
horror story). The Bridge, Espedair Street and The Crow Road are the ones
I\'d really recommend on the non-SF side. The new book "A song of stone\'

to me to run the various weapons in Marathon through FF&S.  Some won\'t
really work well; the WSTE-M Combat Shotgun (a sawed-off lever-action
double-barreled 12-gauge with apparently limitless mag capacity) for
example has serious reality conformity problems let alone doability in FF&S
problems.  However, the .44 Magnum Mega Class, the MA-75B Assault
Rifle/Grenade Launcher, the KKV-7 10mm Flechette SMG, and the SPNKR XM-18
Rocket Launcher do work rather well.

	Here\'s my first effort, the .44 Magnum Mega Class.  For
non-Marathon players, it\'s a .44 magnum sidearm with optic sight and
8-round magazine issued to UESC Mjolnir Mk.IV battleroid security personnel
(who pack them two-handed depending upon availability) and Durandal\'s BoB\'s
(enslaved former human colonists of Tau Ceti/crewmembers of the UESC
Marathon).  It has a nice smooth and rounded reciever and slide, brown
contoured grip, and an odd ringlike finger rest resembling a second trigger
guard ahead of the trigger guard.  To facilitate weapon retention in
adverse circumstances, a similar ringlike finger guard is provided for the
middle finger below the trigger guard on the grip.

Just a note as I saw this threat about some SF with good AI characters. 
If anyone\'s read "Golden Fleece" by Robert Sawyer, the computer is that
story is excellently portrayed as an AI villain.  Read it, you\'ll love
it!

    'body' => '	Here\'s another Marathon weapon run through FF&S for Trav use, the
KKV-7 10mm Flechette SMG.  For non-Marathon players, it\'s a blued-steel SMG
with a drum magazine, large cylindrical barrel shroud tapering forwards
beginning about 2/3rds along its length, no stock or forestock (just a
pistolgrip), and primitive ring sights. It fires 10mm flechettes at a high
rate of fire (I calculate approx. 960 rpm depending on your computer\'s CPU
speed ;>) both underwater (which I think would be dubious both IRL and in
Traveller) and in vacuum.  As with the .44 MMC, I designed it at TL-9,
which I think is consonant with the UESC Marathon\'s tech level in the game
(more or less).  Also note the use of a half die in the damage stat; I use
them in my game, YMMV.  The price seems low, but recall that this is a very
non-frills weapon.  Finally, FF&S2 states that flechettes are more
effective at penetrating flex armour; the special case for damage below is
my attempt at reflecting this).  This would give the weapon a distinct
niche; punching holes in EVA-11 suited targets.

A couple of years ago, a good friend and I played too many rounds of
Drunk Jutland (take a drink every time you score a hit, everyone kills
their drink every time an English ship explodes<g>), and created a list
of names we used for the fleet of what would now be considered a 
pocket empire that our campaign had harassing the borders of the 3I.
Every once in a while one stills turns up in the campaign I have now.
I\'m sure others who\'ve studied the *cough* quaint naming of British
ships have made similar lists:

ISS Idiomatic, ISS Ignominious, ISS Indisposed, ISS Immaculate, 
ISS Immemorial (an old TL 9 ship of course), ISS Immethodical, 
ISS Immitigable, ISS Impecunious, ISS Implausible, ISS 
Imponderable, ISS Improbable, ISS Impudicity, ISS Inapprehensible,
ISS Inconceivable, ISS Incommensurable, ISS Incomprehensible,
ISS Incontinent, ISS Incredulous, ISS Indistinguishable, ISS 
Inextinguishable, ISS Insalubrious, ISS Interminable, ISS 
Intumescence, ISS Invidious, and the ISS Involuntary.

And of course, the ISS Indefatigable, because some things you just 
can\'t improve on :)

	Dear Lord Byron,

	Vulkan Werft is interested to hear that you are planing to
	invest in System Defence Boats to secure our glorius empire.
	We are very glad that you plan to build these boats here to
	strenghen local industry and development.

	As you know Vulkan Werf has a broad competition in building
	civilian ships, small armed freighters, so called Rock\'n\'Rollers.
	A lesser known aspect is that our sister company Lren, who
	produces the Lren Class destroyer, had a design already in
	the shelf since several years, based on their well known destroyer
	vargs and priates fear as it makes the best of TL10 Solomani
	technologie.

	Your sugested purchase order of 4000 MCr would alow us to
	produce six 300 dt Eman SDB\'s and one Mcht 900 dt Battle
	Tender capable of transfering 3 SDB\'s up to two parsecs wide.
	All ships are streamline wedge with an 80 armor, have fuel
	scopes and purification plants to crack their LHy in 3 hours,
	to make it posible to run a secure frontier refuling in 6-9 hours.

	Our well known Lren 69 MW ultra heavy laser (3-3-2-0)
	provides fire power in long distance fights. Two missile
	auto launcher are able to throw 6 missiles per round, an
	impact even larger ships should fear. Two sandcasters
	and three 65 Mj point defence (2:1/6-20 rof 200) lasers
	serving as active defence. EMM Masking, AEMS-5 Jammer
	and decoy dispencers enshure that a typical corsair will
	not even get a fire control lock. Combat history showed
	up that quality of sensors and the number of fire controls
	make the difference between a win and a loss, so the Eman
	SDB is equiped with a A0-P5-J5 suite and 3 fire controls
	of that range.  A dedicated 4th point defence fire control is
	able to shot 6 missiles point blank per round, but
	is also able to act as a 4-0-0-0 battery in dog fights.
	A crew of 14 is recomended on battle stations, and of course
	the damage control team has also crew stations, as the Eman
	is able of 4G evasion.  A second A0-P4-J0 sensor suite and
	avionics at chiefs control serve as a backup, so its always
	posible to bring the Eman home as long as there is a
	running plant. The Plant of course is our well known
	1000 MW Wendelstein C-N-O Fusion. Eman\'s HEPlaR and jumpdrive
	for the Mcht Tender are also compatible to our civilian
	products, so maintaince should be easy on any starport
	subsector wide around.

	The Mcht Battle Tender is a warship of its own!

	3 Lren laser, 3 missile launcher, 4 sandcaster,
	6 point defence laser with 6+2 fire controls stretch
	the weapon combination of the Eman while still leaving
	room for accomodations.  As a sensor suite we chosed
	an A10-P5-J5 to show up the flag, to drive the oponent
	between the silent lurking Emans. The 1750 MW Wendelstein
	from our well known 2999er bulk carrier and the Niehlsboah
	jump drive from our 1499er wilds Rock\'n\'Roller are the
	backbone of ship. Both are reliable parts tested in our
	civilian line. The Mcht is intended to provide repair
	and recreation for the Emans in longer fleet operations
	so it has a big repair shop with 4 MFFs, and a sickbay
	with 12 low berths.

	The Mcht has a crew of 45 and 5 officiers.  A full
	scale operation would involve 92 warriors, 14 of them
	noble officiers, so the cantine for the crew is distinct
	from the a salon for the officiers. Your dear Son, Sir
	van Werschenrege, as a I\'ve heard the coming fleet comander
	would have a strong flagship with the Mcht, which would
	be together with the 5 Lren destroyers the twelved
	warship we build for our empire.

	With kindly regards,

Advisory Follows:


	WARNING: THIS THING IS A MONSTROSITY!  IT WOULD SCARE THE GUYS AT
FAMILLE SPOFULAM!  NO SANE SOPHONT WOULD CARRY ONE!


	I suppose it\'s only to be expected; video-game designers can hardly
be expected to let realism get in the way of coolosity.  In order to get
the grenade launcher numbers I had to fudge by running it through both the
small arms and heavy weapons sequences, and in the case of the cylinder,
work up the mass of the reciever by working backwards from the desired
magazine capacity.  So it\'s somewhat fudged, but I figure that given the
extreme nature of the design averaging the numbers from both sequences
would be a good way of reducing error.	I\'m tempted to put a stock and
pistolgrip on the grenade launcher; a 38-cm 40-mm grenade launcher is
pretty nasty and quite funky all by itself.


	Any way you cut it, this thing is simply scary, though; blasting
away on full auto while firing the grenade launcher ought a) to thoroughly
kill whatever you\'re shooting at, b) thoroughly spatter it all over the
landscape, c) make one helluva racket, d) light up the sky for miles around
due to absence of flash hiders etc, and e) knock you on your butt.  And
it\'s heavy as all bloody hell, even using advanced materials throughout
(and if you thought the weight was bad, wait until you see the price tag!).
However, at least the weight helps keep the recoil within the realm of
(relative) sanity.  On to the description!


	The MA-75B is a 5X75mm assault rifle equipped with a 7-round
40X140mm rotary-magazine grenade launcher slung under the barrel.  It is
issued to UESC security troops.  It is a standard configuration (i.e.
magazine in front of pistol grip) assault rifle with a smooth and rounded
light gray plastic housing protecting the reciever and barrel.  The grenade
launcher is similarly streamlined and slung beneath the barrel in lieu of a
forestock.  No stock is provided for the grenade launcher; its trigger is
housed just ahead of the rifle magazine.  The weapon is notable for its
complete absence of sights; sighting is done along a raised ridge running
along the top of the housing.  It takes a 52-round banana magazine; the
grenade launcher has a 7-round rotary cylinder which accepts 7-grenade
"speedloader" magazines.

If the charecters were all generated at the same time they are only
_supposed_ to have 1 ship in TNE. "One die roll is made for the entire
adventuring group and all die roll modifiers are added together." (TNE
pg 37 column 2)

So unless the player is a replacement charecter or is for a player who
joined the game late he should not _have_ a ship of his own.  I would
like to suggest that as referee it might have been easier if you had not
let the player start the game with a ship, this would require modifying
the rules to suit your campaign. One good possibility would be trading
both ships in to get a third ship that is better than either (if the
ship the party already has is sellable). 

Even if the player does not want to use the ship I would suggest that he
lease it out rather than sell it, if you are not playing in a seting
where this is out of the question (such as the Wilds), this might be a
better answer.  That way if and when the ship they are using is
destroyed/hijacked (and if they are lucky enough to survive) they will
have a ship available. Leasing it out is also better for the charecter
because he still owns it and can earn money off of it, while not
potentially upseting the campaign by having a few MCr in his pockets.

Divide the value of the ship by its wear value.(The wear value was
determined when the ship was rolled up, see TNE pg 37-38.) Take this
number as a base and roll on the Actual Value Table (TNE pg 240). I
would suggest that selling a starship is an adventure, not merely a die
roll however.  In addition the selling price of a multi MCr starship
should not be as volatile as that of a ton of cargo (IMHO). I would
suggest dividing the variance from 100% on this table by 5 or so.  (So a
roll of 13 (200%) of book value would be 120% of actual value ((200%
- -100%)/ 5) + 100% for instance.)

Aliens are (arguably) canonical in Traveller - be very afraid.

attacks with surprise, flees if surprised
Acid blood inflicts 100-600 points dammage per turn

JTAS #4 was published in 1980 so it was too early to have stats for the
Alien queens :( 	(I just picked this issue up, now I only need issue #1
and I will achieve world dominat -- er complete my collection.)

Kallenbach listed his sources as the movie novelization, the comic book,

	Would it be posible to write programs for newton using a

	( prefered languages Lisp,Smalltalk or Forth like )
	The newton still has a strange attraction, even as I will

Here\'s part 1...the data had been regressed back to M:0 using TRTOOLS, and

The Darrukesh Subsector

The Darrukesh subsector is named for the short lived Darrukesh Empiriate, a
pocket empire which dominated this and the adjoining Gadurur (subsector D /
Magyar) subsectors from -541 to -416.  At it\'s height, the Empiriate
claimed 19 worlds in the two subsectors, but collapsed into civil war and
eventually anarchy following the death of it\'s last Autarch in -419.  Only
ruins mark the Empiriate\'s existence on many of these worlds now.
The region has suffered during the Long Night, perhaps more than any other
area in the Solomani Rim.  What little recovery that did take place was
largely wiped out by the collapse of the Darrukesh Empiriate.
Over the past half century, merchants from the Easter Concord began
cautious forays into the subsector, but have found little to encourage
further engagement.  The subsector is likely to remain a backwater for many
years to come.

The spacebased interefeometer (which in fact has to go out around
Jupiter\'s orbit) is needed to detect earthlike planets, and measure
their spectra, which is much, much harder than detecting gas giants.
HST could detect gas giants with a slightly better mirror and/or a
camera designed to compensate for the surface ripples. 6-10 m telescopes
on the ground should also be able to see GG\'s with sufficiently
good adapative optics.

    'body' => 'Two things to remember about most swords:

        1) The sharpness of the edge is usually unimportant
        2) Fencing weapons were often sharp, due to lack of need to
                withstand edge impact against metal

Most historical european weapons were not very sharp; most about on par
with the average american table knife (A butter knife, for Euros and those
with high soc and/or edu). THe idea was not to slash open veins, but to
break bones through armour. A Sharp blade will flake and fracture against
armour, while a semi-dull (won\'t cut flesh with simple pressure or slow
draw) will shatter bones, and with a quick draw-cut/slash, rip open skin. I
assure you, ripped open skin hurts far worse than a good clean cut. (Plenty
of experience doing slow-work with live-steel.)

As for efficacy of a dull blade, back in high school, my frend and  NJROTC
Cadet CO nearly lost an ear due to an accident with a MODERN dress sworn,
US Navy Officer standard issue pattern... He went from "Carry" (back of
blade resting upon shoulder) to "reverse carry" (an exhibition manoever
where the blade front is lightly held against the back of the shoulder),
overextending, and lopping his ear off... save for about 5mm at the front
of the ear. 25 stitches later, he\'s now a US Coast guard officer, with an
interesting (but hard to notice) scar. The blade was as sharp as the BACK
edge of a table knife, ie, 1mm wide, rounded, and smooth.

Better take off and nuke(1) it from orbit then (it\'s the only way(2) to be

2 tri-fold carboard GM\'s Screens for MT, with player info on 4 (back)
sides, and GM\'s info on 6 sides, and a front and back cover taking the
remaining two sides. (Note, using side to refer to an 8x11 section).

It contains most of the task tables, the demo tables, flow-charts for
personal combat, a dot-map of the Imperium and Surrounds, generated from
the Atlas files. It has UWP and UPP explanations. Encounter tables

The insert has several of DGP\'s equipment sheets.

This a bit clearer.. Molotov had excellent Liason skills without having an

Excellent idea.  Keeps us from having shiploads of PCs who should be at the

Also good.. In experiementing, I found that people really could abuse the

Makes sense.. most governments are very careful about who they give stars
to.. also could make for some interesting back story.. a player rolls what
would have been a promotion to O7 except for the DM.. maybe he deserved the
promotion, but a rival sabotaged him..

>Merchant Academy: Graduation makes you a Merchant with rank O1.

Nice to have that clearly defined.

>Naval Academy. Graduate may select Marines with rank O1 instead.

I\'m still a bit wedded to the "up from the ranks idea.." but I\'ve seen a
lot of calls for Marine Academy grads also.. I guess the Stones\' were
right, you can\'t always get what you want..

>I am working on the following concepts:

If the vision for the Imperium is based on the British Empire during the
Victorian Era, this makes a great deal of sense.. second sons and
ne\'er-do-wells being shuffled off into the service.. makes the nobility
feel more like a ruling class.

>College after a career is complete.

Possibly allowed by sacrificing half of the allowed benefit rolls?

>A Marine Direct Commission program.

I\'m against this.. Since the Marine Force gets the real dirty jobs, I don\'t
think that they would accept for a minute some fop with family connections.
 Send him to the Navy, where he can be assaistant club officer.

>Second careers.

Allowed with no benefit rolls from first career, and a negative DM for
enlistment.

Someone wrote that Gateway was originally by Judges Guild.

is not the JG one. The only thing the same is the name.
Your description stands.

Related to this, Old Expanses was originally developed

    From what I vaguely remember of the pseudophysics desribed in the Darrian\'s
module the problem resulted from the fact that the Darrian\'s discovered records
from the original experiment that caused the sub nova flare.  Technical
schematics of the original probe, early data and such like and it didn\'t match
what they had on hand in their current (circa 1100+) Special Arm units.  So the
Darrian\'s started an emergency re-engineering to make their weapons match the
millenium old specs.
    Their diplomats and leader started wearing psionic screens because "they
knew" the Star Trigger was a bluff suddenly.  About a year or so later the
Darrian\'s had re-engineered their Star Trigger weapons to match the recovered
specs and they got back data matching the original data from the early tests.
Now WE, the overviewing GM\'s and Player who read AM8, know that the newly
re-engineered Star Triggers are worthless.  BUT the Darrian\'s believe they work
and it\'s that belief that the Zhodani telepaths read in the minds of the
Darrian\'s diplomat and leaders and thus are detered.  Because the Darrians
BELIEVE their Star Trigger works and in all likelyhood They Would Know. ;)
    As I remember the described pseudophysics in AM8, my copy is packed away,
the new Star Trigger wouldn\'t work either.  Mostly because the original sub
nova flare was a complete and utter accident.  Something to do with how all
those meson beams communicating with the probe deep within the stellar core
were interacting if memory serves.  OC the use of the Star Trigger is NOT
something you want to have happen in your local space.  The original one fried
electronics half a dozen parsecs away when the wave front got there.  And it
didn\'t do the Darrian\'s Primary Star any good either. ;)

describes it as "a brutal tool of mayhem".  Visualize a sawed-off 12-gauge
double-barreled shotgun with a lever action activated by twirling the gun
around in one hand like Arnie in T2.  It has a long pistol grip and ribbed
forestock covering the twin side-by-side tubular magazines slung under the
barrels, which are 15 cm in length.  The weapon itself measures 45 cm
length overall, or just a hair less than 18 inches.  I\'ve designed it with
TL-8 advanced materials, which keeps the weight down at the expense of
price.

	In Marathon, you never have to reload it; you keep on blasting away
until you run out of shells.  I\'ve implemented a more realistic magazine
capacity (in this case 2 shells per magazine); thus the weapon can be fired
three times before reloading assuming the magazines are full and there\'s a
round in each chamber.  With one in each hand, that\'d give the shooter 6
2-barrel blasts before reloading, and boy will he look studly while he\'s
blasting away.  Ross Coburn can testify to this, as I\'ve whacked him with
WSTE-M\'s once or twice in netted M2 games :).

	Under my house rules, this weapon benefits from a positive DM to
hit due to the shortness (15 cm or 6 inches) of its barrels, and suffers
from increasingly reduced damage at increasing range bands.

    'body' => 'Exectutive summary: these are the definitve rules for using the new sensors 
in FFS2 (the printed version is somewhat incomplete) and also definitive
rules for converting old sensors to the new system.

As part of the FFS2 project, I offered to help with better passive sensor
rules, based on realistic simulations of detector properties, background at
different wavelength, and brightness of a target spacecraft at different
wavelength.  Target signature was modelled with three main components:
reflected starlight, thermal emission from the hull, and thermal
emission from waste-heat radiators; the radiators were based on the
assumptions that went into FFS2\'s powerplant rules (please - no debate about
power plant radiator realism!) and were usually the dominant component, though
reflected sunlight is also very high for non-black starships.

I may write a long article about the results later, but the main result
was that even very small sensors can achieve initial detection - though 
not necessarily a position accurate enough for fire control - at very
long ranges; even up to millions of km for a TL-8 5-m diameter sensor (a P1
in T4 terms) for a 100-ton non-military target.

Based on this I set out to write more realistic sensor rules. Improvements
include a straightforward system for calculating initial detection ranges
for any target (based on some suggestions by Anders, mostly). This seems
especially useful to roleplayers - it\'s nice to have rules that define
precisely how far away (for example) at Type S can detect a powered-off
lifeboat parked next to an asteroid. it\'s also useful for heavyduty
military gearheads - it answers questions like "can a big military
sensor array detect a starship refuelling at a comet in the Kuiper belt".

The rules also make a distinction
between detecting a target and achieving a fire control solution, and 
adding a much wider range of possible sensors (it always bugged me that any
medium-sized FFS ship could fit the best possible sensor.) 

Unfortunately, while I know a lot about visible/IR sensors, I know very
little about radar - in the absence of a radar expert, Dave and I put together
active sensor rules through the ancient Vilani technique of "Making It Up."
In particular we tried to adjust
things so that active sensors were roughly game-balanced with passive sensors
(though I guess that this somewhat overrates active sensors.) 

Also unfortunately, the rules as they appear in FFS2 are somewhat incomplete;
they include the details of how big these new sensors are, but not much detail
on how to actually use these sensors in combat or role-playing.
So, as a preview and general service, I figured I\'d post my (draft) sensor
rules here. I\'ll also include rules for converting FFS/QSDS/SSDS sensors and
ships to the new system. FFS2 includes much more detail for designing ships
with sensors - including very large ones - optimized for this new system, 
new ECM options, etc., and is recommended for people wanting to take full
advantage of these rules.

I\'ve broken the rules up into three parts for this posting: Basic (Part 2), 
Intermediate (Part 4), and Advanced (Part 5), with Basic covering all you need
or simple spacecraft operations in a free space, intermediate adding more 
terrain options and a different treatment of active sensors, and advanced 
adding some even-more-complicated terrain rules for exotic solar systems.
The rating/conversion rules get their own section (Part 3.)

If any Traveller web site maintainers are interested in this, I\'d be willing
to see it posted on a (non-IG) web site. If IG is interested in this, I\'d
be willing to negotiate turning it into a JTAS article or a rules section
for a future book (like "Imperial Squadrons", or NAH.)

The rules aren\'t particularly tied to any combat system. They are
oriented towards role-playing with a referee keeping enemy ships hidden,
but could be used for two-player combat with a defending player keeping their
ships secret or both players using dummy counters a la BR.

[Some designer\'s notes are intersperesed in square brackets like this.]
[These are drafts. Not all the exotic situations have been modelled
in detail; some numbers are estimated and will change. I\'m also willing
to tweak models for game balance and would *love* to hear from people
using these in role-playing situations or combat.]

Sensors are used for two main purposes. The first is DETECTING a 
previously unknown target. The second is obtaining a fire-control LOCK on
a detected target.

The target detection attempts are resolved by evaluating the
SIGNAL of each attempt using the formula below, and then comparing the
signal to the success chart (Table 1) to determine the difficulty of the
sensor operator\'s task. The SIGNAL must be >=0.0 for there to be any chance
of detection; if the signal is sufficiently high detection is automatic.


Very important: only one passive and one active (if active sensors are on)
sensor can be used per sensing ship per
target per turn, even if the sensing ship has multiple sensors. [This is a 
game-balance decision; because the T4 task system is so coarse and 
even Impossible tasks so easy, it would otherwise always be better to put
two cheap sensors on a ship than one expensive one. The intermediate rules
do allow a ship to use multiple sensors for different purposes (like scanning
different arcs.)]

Table 1: Detection Task Difficulty

SIGNAL	Difficulty

<0	target cannot be detected under any circumstances.
0.0	Impossible	(TNE: Impossible)
0.5	Staggering	(TNE: Formidable)
1.0	Average		(TNE: Average)
>=1.5	Automatic detection
 


SIGNAL is calculated as follows:

SIGNAL = SENSITIVITY- RANGE + SIGNATURE +(MODIFIERS) 

SENSITIVITY is the sensitivity rating of the sensor attempting the
detection (determined in the design process.)

SIGNATURE is the target\'s signature, also determined during the 
design process but sometimes modified for specific conditions or actions.
Active sensors use the targets active (radar) signature.
Starships are rated with two different passive signatures. For the basic
system, use only the target\'s emitted (infrared) signature.
MODIFIERS will adjust the target\'s signature based on its actions.

RANGE is the range factor, taken from the range chart (Table 2) - note that
these range factors are chosen to match what I was told the T4.1
range bands would be.

Table 2: Range factors

Range:								RANGE
km			BL Hexes	T4 name	T4.1 name	term	
<=500						regional	8
<=5,000			0			continental	9
<=50,000		1-2		VS	planetary	10
<=500,000		3-16		S	far orbit	11
<=5,000,000		17-160		M and L			12
<=50,000,000		161-1600				13

<=50,000,000,000 (300 AU)			"oort"		16
<=500,000,000,000 (3000 AU)					17

Finally, the target\'s signature is modified by the following actions or
conditions:

Condition	  Active Sig.	  Passive Sig.
		  (radar)	  (emitted/IR)
Non-maneuvering		0.0		-0.5
Shutdown		0.0		-1.0
Using active sensors   +1.0             +1.0
Surprised	       +0.5             +1.0
same hex as planet     -1.0             -0.5
 or asteroid
in atmosphere	        0.0             -0.5
landed		       -2.0             -1.0

Explanations:

Non-maneuvering: no use of maneuver drive (except micro-evasion) during past
turn.
Shutdown: all power (except life support and passive sensors) shut down - 
 may not fire weapons or maneuver until powerplant restarted (which normally
 requires one full turn.)
Using active sensors: ships using any using any active sensor any active
	sensor must annouce this to all ships with functional active or
	passive sensors within the same solar system. [Yes, that\'s correct,
	within the solar system; there\'s an intermediate rule that defines
	precisely how far you can see an active sensor, but the answer is a
	long, long, way. For a real-world example, military over-the-horizon
	ICBM early warning radars (about a sensetivity 10 or 11) can be
	detected by an Arcebo-sized radio telescope (about a sensitivity
	14 PEMS) several parsecs away (range factor 19.)]
Surprised: Targets that are unaware of the presence of any enemy ship (ref\'s
	discretion) are significantly easier to detect. [Ships are normally
	assumed to manage their thermal radiators to radiate most heat away
	from suspected enemy craft - which is impossible if you don\'t know
	there are any enemy craft out there.]
Planet: targets within the same 30,000km BL hex as a planet or asteroid are
	assumed to be using it for cover wherever possible.


In the basic system, once a target is detected, the referee should inform
the sensor operator of that fact and the target\'s signature, and place the 
ship\'s counter on the map (if you\'re using one). In the basic system ships
remain detected forever (or until they move far enough away to reduce their
SIGNAL to -1.0). After one turn of detection, the referee can inform the
sensor operator of the tonnage and basic configuration of the target; after
two turns, the class.


Fire control:

At the most basic level, you can just allow any ship to fire on any
detected target.

For slightly more detail, at the instant of weapons fire, the firing ship 
must obtain a succesful FIRE CONTROL LOCK on the target. The same procedure 
as above is used, but the SIGNAL is reduced by -1.5 - firing on a target is 
much more difficult than merely detecting it. All other modifiers apply.
Optionally, targets without a fire control lock may be fired on, but the fire
task is increased by 3 difficulty levels.


Examples:
A Scout ship has a passive sensor sensitivity of 14 and an
active sensor sensitivity of 12. It is attempting to detect a trader with a
active (radar) signature of 0 and a passive emitted (IR) signature of 0.
At interplanetary (500,000,000km) range detection the passive SIGNAL is
         14        +   0       -  14     =    0
      sensitivity   signature    range      SIGNAL
and detection is an Impossible task. The active SIGNAL is 12 + 0 - 14 = -2
and the target cannot be detected with active sensors.

If the range were 5,000,000km, the passive signal would be 14 + 0 - 12 = 2
and detection would be automatic.

If the target had shut down its power plant at 5,000,000 km, the passive
signal would be 14 + 0 - 1.0 - 12 = 1 (average task.)

If the scout ship was then attempting to obtain a fire control lock at 
a range of 500,000km, the signal would be 14 - 1.5 + 0 - 1.0 - 11 = 0.5
(formidable task) - but the trader would be unable to return fire (since
its power plant is shut down.)

Note that FFS2 includes a much wider range of sensors for use on newly-
designed ships - including much more powerful active sensors and huge
arrays for use on capital ships. It also includes advanced stealth and
ECM options.

FFS2 also distinguishes between sensors that are optimized for detecting new
targets ("scanners") and those optimized for fire-control ("trackers") but
sensors converted from FFS are considered to be dual-mode tracker/scanners
(as are most high-TL sensors in FFS2), except for LADARs.

Sensor ratings:

Passive sensors from FFS/QSDS/SSDS are converted to the new system 
using Table 3:

Table 3: Passive Sensor Conversion Table

FFS range(hexes)		Sensitivity
or T4 rating
0.01 - 0.1			13
1-2				13.5
3-4				14
5-6				14.5
7-8				15.0


Active sensors use Table 4:

Table4: Active Sensor Conversion Table

FFS range(hexes)		Sensitivity
or T4 rating
0.01-0.1			11.5
1-7				12.0
8-16				12.5


LADAR sensors use Table 5 - but LADARs are considered "Trackers", and
can only be used for fire control locks or for maintaining contact with
previously-detected targets.

Table 5: LADAR Sensor Conversion Table

FFS range(hexes)		Sensitivity
or T4 rating
0.01-0.1			12.0
1-7				12.5
8-16				13.0



SIGNATURES:

A ship\'s active (radar) signature is calculated based on its surface
area using the following table:

The base radar signature is given by the following table:

surface area    radar signature		(hull size)

0.1-9m^2               -0.5		<1 ton
10-999m^2               0		1-200 tons
1000-99999m^2          +0.5		200-90,000 tons
100000-9999999m^2      +1		100,000 tons+

The hull size column is provided for T4 designs whose surface area is
not given in the USP - use the hull size column instead.
EMM decreases radar signature by 0.5.





The passive emitted (or infrared) signature is calculated based on a ship\'s
power plant output. (For T4 ships that don\'t list the power plant output,
use (Power Plant Rating * Tons / 2).)

Power            signature
0.000-0.009 MW    -2.5
0.01-0.09 MW      -2.
0.1-0.9 MW        -1.5
1 -9 MW           -1
10 MW             -0.5
100 MW             0
1000 MW            0.5 
10000 MW           1
100000 MW          1.5
1000000 MW         2

Ships with Stealth reduce their emitted signature by 0.5. Ships with
EMM reduce their signature by 1.0

(as an Advanced rule, increase the power by 0.0001 MW per m2 of surface
area to include heat loading due to absorbed sunlight - this is normally
negligible except for ships with power plants shut down.)

(also as an advanced rule, rather than using the generic -0.5 
non-manuevering or -1.0 shutdown bonus in combat, designers may rate
the emitted signature at different power levels (such as with all systems
except life support shut down, or with power-using weapons not firing.))



The passive reflected (visible) signature, used in the Intermediate and
Advanced rules, is calculated based on a ship\'s surface area:

surface area    	reflected signature	hull size

1-9m^2          	  -2			<1 ton
10-99m^2        	  -1.5			1-95 tons
100-999m^2      	  -1			100-200 tons	
1000-9999m^2    	  -0.5			300-3000 tons
10000-99999m^2   	   0			4000-100,000 tons
100000-999999m^2  	   0.5			200,000 - 1,000,000 tons
1000000-9999999m^2  	   1.0

(The hull size table is again provided for lazy T4 owners.)

Ships with TL10+ EMM reduce their reflected signature by 0.5

These base signatures are for normal TL10+ starships, which are assumed
to have "chameleon" hulls that can change color and pattern. This capability
is normally used for adverstising and thermal management, but in a combat
situation the hull is adjusted to be as black as possible (typically 99%
black for a civilian hull.)

Starships without this color-changing coating - TL9- ships, or (optionally)
some higher TL cut-rate civilian ships - increase their reflected
signature by +1. TL8-9 ships with Stealth ignore this penalty.

Example: A TL-12 100dTon scoutship has a spherical hull (with an
area of 600 m2), and a power plant output of 150 MW. It has an active
(radar) signature of 0.0. 
It would have a reflected signature of -1. ITs effective power plant
output is 150 MW + (600x0.0005)=150.3 MW, for an emitted signature of 0.
If the ship was equipped with EMM the emitted
signature would be reduced to -1.0 (and the active and reflected to -0.5
and -2.0 respectively.) If the ship was then running
without manuevering, with the powerplant running at 50 MW,
the emitted signature would be reduced still further to -1.5.
Even with the power plant completely shut off, the effective power
is still 0.3 MW, for an emitted signature (including masking) of -2.5
The scout has a T4 sensor rating of A2 P3, which converts to a new
sensor rating of A12 P14

A designer would record this on the ship record as follows:
Active Sig:                 (-0.5)
Passive Sig (emit.refl):    (-1/-2) 
			    (-1.5/-2 at 50 MW power)
			    (-2.5/-2 when shut down)

Or (the short form): Signature (act/emit/ref): -1/-1/-2

There are fpur main changes to the basic detection process. The first
is a different detection table for active and passive sensors, to reflect
the fact that active sensor detection probabilities drop off steeply:

Revised Table 1: detection task difficulties:

SIGNAL	active detection	passive detection
	task			task
<0	(target cannot be detected under any circumstances)
0	Impossible		Impossible
0.5	Average			Staggering (TNE: Formidable)
1.0	(automatic detection)	Average
1.5				Easy
2.0				(automatic detection.)

The second is a range table with fractional range bands (in-between the
T4 range bands):

Revised table 2: Range factors

Range:								RANGE
km			BL Hexes	T4 name	T4.1 name	term	
<=500						regional	8
<=1,600								8.5
<=5,000						continental	9
<=16,000		0					9.5
<=50,000		1-2			planetary	10
<=160,000		3-5		VS			10.5
<=500,000		6-16		S	far orbit	11
<=5,000,000		17-50		M			12
<=16,000,000		51-160		L			12.5

<=50,000,000,000  300 AU			oort		16
<=500,000,000,000 3000 AU					17

The third change is that all ships have two different passive signatures,
their emitted (infrared) signature, and their reflected (visible) signature.
A passive sensor detection attempt must be evaluated against whichever of 
these provides the higher total signal. Normally this will be the emitted
signature.

The fourth is that detected targets no longer remain automatically detected
but must be reaquired each turn; however, previously-detected targets get
a 1.5 increase to their signal, which generally makes repeat detection
automatic. (Note that this modifier does NOT apply to fire control locks.)

Finally, the intermediate rules use a vastly expanded table of
terrain and condition modifiers. These can be broken down broadly into
effects that modify the target\'s signature and effects that modify the
sensor\'s sensitivity:

Modifiers to signature

Condition	  Active Sig.	  Passive Sig.	   Passive Sig.
		  (radar)	  (emitted/IR)	   (reflected/vis)
	Target actions:
Non-maneuvering		+0.0		-0.5		 0.0
Shutdown		+0.0		-1.0		 0.0
Firing beam weapons	+0.5		+1.0		+0.5
Launching msls/SC	+0.5		+0.0		+0.5	
Using active sensors    +1.0            +1.0		+1.0
Evading			-0.5		-0.5		-0.5
using HEPlaR 1-2G	+0.0		+0.5		+0.0
using HEPlaR 3-20G	+0.0		+1.0		+0.0
using HEPlaR 21G+	+0.0		+1.5		+0.0

	Surprise modifiers:
Surprised	        +0.5            +1.0		+0.5
Alert		        +0.0		+0.5		+0.0
Battle Stations		+0.0		+0.0		+0.0

	Terrian modifiers:
same hex as planet      -1.0            -1.0		-0.5
 or asteroid
in shadow		-0.0		-0.0		-2.0
landed			-2.0		-1.0		-0.5
landed and camoflaged	-2.0		-1.0		-1.0
near large GG		-0.5		-0.5		-0.0
	
	Atmosphere modifiers
In atmosphere  6+	 0.0		-0.5		-0.0
In atmos 8-9		 0.0		-1.0		-0.5
In atmos A+		-0.5		-1.5		-1.0
upper GG atmosphere	-1.0		-2.0		-1.5
lower GG atmosphere	-1.5		-2.5		-2.5
deep GG atmosphere	-2.5		-4.5		-4.5

	General modifiers (not for FC locks):
Target was detected	+1.5		+1.5		+1.5
  last turn
Target was detected     +0.5            +0.5            +0.5
  within last 10 turns

Non-maneuvering: no use of maneuver drive (except micro-evasion) during past
turn.
Shutdown: all power (except life support and passive sensors) shut down - 
 may not fire weapons or maneuver until powerplant restarted (which normally
 requires one full turn.)
Firing beam weapons opens covers exposing (hot) weapon focal plane arrays
   and reducing stealthing. Firing missiles or launching/recovering small
   craft similarly increases signatures

Using active sensors: ships using any using any active sensor any active
	sensor must annouce this to all ships with functional active or
	passive sensors within a range equal to the active sensor range +
	passive sensor range minus 5 (which is normally the whole solar
	system and occasionally the whole subsector.) 
Surprised: Targets that are unaware of the presence of any enemy ship (ref\'s
	discretion) are significantly easier to detect. See the surprise
	rules in BR for details - ships can either be completely surprised, on
	alert status (some battle stations manned but no hostiles detected)
	or at battle stations with an enemy detected (no modifiers.)
Evasion: succesful BL/BR evasion attempt
HEPlaR (and Fusion rockets) have a large signature penalty. 
Planet: targets within the same 30,000km BL hex as a planet or asteroid are
	assumed to be using it for cover wherever possible.
  Ships in shadow (generally any ship in the same hex as a planet or asteroid
  may opt to be in shadow) have a much lower reflected (visible-light) sig.
  
  Landed ships are any ship that takes one turn to land on a planet or
   asteroid surface; they are assumed to set down to take advantage of
   terrain, and to dump waste heat into the object rather than radiate it.
   Modifier is not cumulative with "same hex".

  Landed ships may be camoflaged - this requires one person-hour per 100 dTons
   of ship, is a Formidable task (Ship Tactics or Sensor), and requires
   camoflage equipment (MCR 0.01 and 0.1 tons per 100 dTons of ship, comes
   free with EMM or any other masking.) Ships lose their camoflage
   advantage if they fire weapons or (obviously) maneuver. Clearing the 
   camoflage requires 10 person-minutes per 100 dTons of ship.

Being within an atmosphere (or a gas giant atmosphere) reduces
detectability and sensor sensitivity. 
These modifiers are cumulative with "landed" or "same hex" as 
applicable.
Ships in a gas giant atmosphere 
can be at one of three depths - upper, lower, and deep. Moving from one to 
another requires one turn.

Sensitivity modifiers:

Condition	  Active Sense.	  Passive Sense.   Passive Sense.
		  (radar)	  (emitted/IR)	   (reflected/vis)

In atmosphere  6+	 0.0		-0.0		-0.5
In atmos 8-9		 0.0		-0.5		-1.0
In atmos A+		-0.5		-1.0		-1.5
upper GG atmosphere	-1.0		-2.0		-1.5
lower GG atmosphere	-1.5		-2.5		-2.5
deep GG atmosphere	-2.5		-4.5		-4.5

Intermediate example: A scout (A12 P14) in space is trying to detect another
EMM-equipped scout (active/emitted/reflected signature -1.0/-1.0/-2.0).
The target is landed (sig modifiers -2/-1/-0.5). The range is 5,000,000km
(RF=12.) The active signal is 12 -2 -1 -12 = -3, undetectable. The
passive emitted signal is 14 -1 -1 -12 = 0, an Impossible task.
The passive reflected signal is 14 -2 -0.5 -12 = -0.5, lower than the
emitted signal, so the emitted signal is used.
The landed scout sees a passive signal of 14 -1.0 -12 = 1.0, an 
Average task, and will almost certainly get the first shot.

Ships that have detected an enemy target can employ "agressive baffling",
	turing their radiators away from that single target but increasing
	their signature elsewhere.
Being in the same arc as the star (in the Habitable zone or closer) relative
to the sensing ship decrease detectability. (BL/BR players should designate
one direction to be the "sun" direction and apply this bonus to any target
in the same 60 degree arc.)

Single arc: restricting a sensor to a single 30-degree arc
  improves sensitivity. Restricting scans to a single hex (including
  the ship\'s own) improves it still more. Note that ships may use multiple
  sensors to each scan a different arc or hex.
   
Location/Dust: sensitivity is reduced in the inner portions of a solar
  system due to scattered light from zodiacal dust.
  Some systems (referees discretion until I write the rules...) may
  have light or no such dust, particularly older stars and/or stars with
  no planetoid belts. Young stars or stars with several planetoid belts
  may posses heavy dust; extremely young systems with thick protoplanetary
  disks qualify for the "extreme" modifier.


Example: in a normal system, a battlecruiser (signature 0.5/0.5/-0.5)
has jumped near a comet in the Kuiper belt (Range=15.) A large 
sensor array (Passive sensitivity 15.5) in the inner solar system is
attempting to detect it. In the first turn, the battle cruiser
is operating at full power as it maneuvers to the comet and the emitted signal is
15.5 + 0.5 - 15.0 = 1.0, an Average task. If it escapes detection and
manages to enter the comet\'s hex, it would gain the -1 for being in the
same hex as the comet, and -0.5 for non-maneuvering, for a signal of -0.5
(undetectable.) A second sensor array located in the outer zone of the
system, however, would have a sensitivity bonus of 1.0 for a signal of 
15.5 + 1.0 + 0.5 - 15.0 -1.0 -0.5 = 0.5, a Staggering task (every half hour
turn) to detect the ship; it might be able to successully refuel and jump
out. (Clever system defence managers can probably think of ways to make
this harder...)

Scan duration:

The rules assume 30 minute turns. If the combat system has shorter turns,
sensor sensitivity will be reduced; in a roleplaying situation (such as
interplanetary travel) it will often be more convienient to extend the turns,
increasing sensor sensitivity. use the following table to modify sensitivity
based on turn length:

Turn Length	Sense Mod    Notes


1-60 seconds     -0.5	     personal combat turns
1-120 minutes	  0.0        space combat turns
2-100 hours	 +0.5	     "system crossing" timescale

    My, what a talent for understatement you possess!  Not to mention that it\'s

    IF this is going to get done, and while I and a lot of other Traveller fans
would love to have it happen.  Marc has only said he\'s considering it.  About
the only way I can think to see it done is if Marc let\'s the fans who have
volunteered to scan and edited do so, then grant amnesty for those of us fan
who have already typed this stuff into text files.  Though I suspect that most
of the TNE stuff is already in text files and such so that\'s less work to worry
about. ;) But still, this is going to be an awful big project.  Yet I suspect
it\'s only one that we the fans can do... if Marc will allow us too. ;)

    Please God too!  Let\'s make certain we get either bug fixed copies or
include the errata files!  There is NOTHING more depressing the spending a
bunch of money something and then finding out it\'s broken and that the errata
fixing it isn\'t available. :( And let\'s make it simple plain text, for all the
people who either don\'t have the machines to handle all the fancy formats or
can\'t afford to spend the money to buy them.  Plain text is the _ultimate_ in
cross platform compatability. ;)

    And then there\'s the appearance of that rabid feud between Marc Miller and
Roger Sanger over the DGP stuff he owns the rights to. <sigh> It would be nice
to get ALL of Traveller\'s heritage on CD though.

to which idiot/savant asked:

>Where?

I know of two Swycaffer trilogies:
Not in Our Stars
Become the Hunted
The Universal Prey (all by Avon Books)

The Empire\'s Legacy
Voyage of the Planet Slayer
Revolt and Rebirth (all by New Infinities Productions)

and the short story collection: The Praesidium of Archive (Avon books
again)

If you want further details - look out for a forthcoming bibliography!  :-)

I kind of assumed that these *wouldn\'t* be included on the CD for copyright
reasons, though of course, I\'d love them to be there.


Funnily enough I happened across a copy of _Voyage of the Planet Slayer_
last weekend for just $5.  If only it had been one of the ones I don\'t own.
If anyone wants this and will pay postage I\'ll see if it\'s still in the
shop. (likely)  I also have an extra copy of _Not in Our Stars_ if anyone
wants to buy it.



For those who don\'t know, these books are not set in The Imperium but are
stories based in an alternate Traveller universe (with permission from MWM
to use such concepts and ideas).

[deleted for bandwidth]

I haven\'t been entirely keen on some of the directions T4.1 has been 
taking on character generation, but all these changes sound 
excellent!

I assume Marine Force Lieutenants etc. would habitually be referred 
to as "Lieutenant Jones" except in formal matters or interservice 
dealings.  So the Marine CO might say to a trooper, "Report to Lt. 
Jones", but the Navy Captain would order "Force Lt. Jones" to the 
Bridge, and the court-martial for cowardice might begin "Force Lt. 
Jones, you are accused of the capital crime of cowardice in the face 
of the enemy.  How do you plead?"

	Actually, the staff are well trained.  The boss gets to play with
new toys as long as he wants so long as he doesn\'t compromise Orbital HQ\'s
structural or atmospheric integrity or he doesn\'t drool too heavily on them.

	Also, they\'re not dumb enough to hand them to Hengabar _loaded_ :).

	Seriously, though, I don\'t think that I\'d release that one as a
Spofulam design.  The inspiration wasn\'t mine, but rather that of the guys
at Bungie Games, whose games you should all run out and buy immediately :).

	Now that I\'ve got the main ones from Marathon done (with the
exception of the SPNKR SSM launcher and the TOZT-7 Backpack Napalm Unit and
the Zeus-class Fusion Pistol (which\'d have to be about TL-18)) I might just
take a stab at that funky little gun thing Gary Oldman\'s character was
packing in Fifth Element.  I think that it could be done by lifting some
data from EA (like the net gun and flamethrower) and creatively fudging...

The first Darrian Star Trigger was in fact a sham. According to AM8 it was
developed in haste in the mid 400\'s in response to a percieved Zhodani threat.
The Darrian\'s couldn\'t initially reproduce the star trigger because they did
not understand how they had triggered the Maghiz. However they fudged a
demonstration (one is left to puzzle at just how one \'demonstrates\' a star
trigger without actually setting it off) which convinced their own people that
it worked. The Zhodani then detected this belief telepathically and thus the
deterrent worked.

However shortly after the end of the Fifth Frontier War, some documents
relating to the probe thought to have caused the Maghiz came to light that the
creators of the star trigger didn\'t have, creating doubt that the star trigger
worked. This threatened the deterrent effect as the Zhodani would be able to
detect this doubt. The adventure in AM8 details the efforts of the Darrian\'s
to get the star trigger to work, without letting on that it doesn\'t. AM8 states
that the Maghiz was caused by the interaction of two ongoing probes into
Darrian\'s primary. While not specifically stated, the overall tone of the
adventure is that the Darrian\'s did figure out how to build a working star
trigger in the 1100\'s. However since it requires the deployment of two big
powerful meson beams close to the star to be triggered as well as physically
dropping a large probe into the star; I\'d say actually using it would be a tad
on the tricky side.

Scene in Zhodani Planetry Defence HQ.
"Okay, so we\'ve got two Darrian ships moving to flank postions on either side
of our star and another approaching the star at high-G\'s. Do you think they
might be up to something?"

WOW!
4 sets of house rules on the TML.  Robert you\'ve been busy! This is what I 
like to see on this list.  Creativity!

I enjoy rules variants, stuff like this makes the game that much more 
interesting.

These are some interesting house rules Robert.  Well done.  I particulary 
like your hacking rules variant.  I too have done a hacking rules system, 
based in part by info in CSC.

If you would like to check them out they are @

Keep up the good work!

Wouldn\'t they "disturb" sensors and laser mirrors as well? Couldn\'t you use
grav-soliton guns as defense against lockons of sensors?
Finally I\'m wondering if you do not need to resolve the target to be able
to use the image for FC purposes?

   Actually, what I have done before is that everytime I had another
group (I have moved so often because of my work that I have to start all
over again), I always start the new group in the Spinward Marches at the
time of the Fifth Frontier War.  It does require more work but it is
always a time filled with adventures.  It also gives a perspective on
the NPC that will get importance later (i.e. Norris).  For example, if
your characters meet Norris when he is not archduke and help him, they
will be interested in his rise to power in later years.

SMC contains useful information on the sector (and the map is a lot
nicer than the original one published as one of the supplement).  The
map in the front of the book is also useful if you photocopy it and give
it to your player as a player aid.  It helps them have an understanding
on the universe around them.  I have always found this book useful.  I
have used it so often that my copy is kind of beat up now.

The Vanefa Subsector

The Vanefa subsector is dominated by the Easter Concord, most of it\'s
worlds are either members of, or have close ties to the Concord.  The
subsector is named for it\'s primary world, which is the dominant in the
Easter Concord\'s spinward regions, and is a major power within the
Concordat Assemblage itself.  Vanefa, and most of the other member worlds
in this subsector joined the Easter Concord relatively recently (from -57
to -12).
Vanefa is critical of many of the Concord\'s policies, both internal and
external.  Wary of the growing tendency towards centralised government, all
of Vanefa\'s representatives are members of the Centrifugal Faction within
the Assemblage.

I disagree with you here, Harold. *Everything* in the published articles of
MTJ and TD should be construed as canon.

The Sparklers episode appeared in a lettercol at the back of MTJ4 and was
mentioned more as an idea that DGP was planning to develop. Since they
never did develop it, it remains an "idea" and Dave could invalidate it
without making the implication that everything DGP wrote bears scrutiny.

How did you figure the conversions?  I have been working on small craft and 
fighter designs recently.  I could only plug in relatively small sensor 
packages in the 10 ton fighter.  I choose the 12.5 Sensitivity rating 
passive sensor, hoping it would be adequate.  According to the conversion 
tables my fighter would only be able to sense ships in the same hex.  But 
after doing some math I discovered that my fighter could detect automaticaly 
things within the range of factor 11(3-16 hexes) provided the object had a 
passive signature of 0 with no modifications.

12.5-0-11-0=1.5 (automatic detection)

I am a little confused about all this.  This is going to shake some 
shipdesigners up a bit as we move to a new sensor rules structure.

   I don\'t know whether they\'ve ever been published.  Here are the T4
   stats from my High-Guard-to-T4 conversion scheme (which works pretty
   well IMNSHO).  I believe that T4-to-TNE conversion is pretty simple,

Which is odd, since I can go out now and buy a TL8 laser pointer for 
~$50 that\'s the size/weight of a pen and will reach 100m.

Okay, so it\'s not quite the same thing, but laser sights should be a 
*lot* smaller than FF&S said.

Simple solution: use a wavelength off the end of the visible spectrum and 
goggles that can detect it.

to the most wealthy states and people.  The 20t launch

be directly transferable.  We must also assume a space tug,
perhaps little more than a 50t engine which could drag

Life would be more precarious than that of the typical Imperial,

The whommmp isn\'t that much of an effect; the active optics in laser
mirrors and sensors should easily be able to cope with it.

My ultimate decision was that you don\'t. You can computer the
centroid (location) of an unresolved target to much better than your
resolution - a hundred or a thousand times better with enough signal-to-noise.
The new sensor rules model that; you need lots of S/N to fire (which is
why there\'s a big sensitivity penalty) but you don\'t need incredible
resolution.

What limited you to the 12.5? That\'s a pretty dinky sensor - a fighter
should be able to carry a 13 or 13.5.

A couple more things to keep in mind:
- -If you\'re looking for someone who\'s already been detected (by you or another
friendly ship you;\'re in communication with) you get a +1.5 (which is *huge*.)
A fighter can get targets handed off from the mother ship; or, if fighters
are going to operate independently, build one fighter with no weapons but
a bigger sensor array (maybe even folding) that acquires targets for the
whole squadron. 

- -In T4, an "average" task is pretty easy, so you really only need a signal of
1 to be fairly sure of catching someone

- -Limiting your scanning to a single arc gets you a sensitivity bonus;

- -Getting a firecontrol lock is even harder - it would be an Impossible task
for your fighter at RF 11 - but there\'s one really good option for fighters:
Ladar. Ladars are relatively cheap and very good for firecontrol locks. 
(Note that the Ladar table in the FFS draft was wrong - and the one in FFS
is probably wrong - all sensitivities should be increased by 6.) Fighters
can also consider a bigger single-function tracker. I may tweak the fire
control rules still more later...

The rules do make life harder for fighters trying to detect small ships
or other fighters (although they make life easier for fighters trying to
detect capital ships...) This is probably realistic, unfortunately. 
Fighters that want to do "space control" missions probably need a AWACS-
equivalent to fly with them.

I\'m happy to answer questions - and tweak the rules as playbalance issues
become apparent. Maybe I should participate in your ISBA forum...
I *think* the rules give us more options - as opposed to FFS, where 
pretty much any ship could carry a sensor big enough to make sensors 
irrelevant in combat - and ultimately will be nice to have.

for quickly determining the currency value of a world.

This cute little formula gives the value, in Credits, of

Of course, 0 or less means you gotta barter.

So,

Sylea\'s credit is worth		(15 + 2 + 3) / 20 = 1.0 Credits (surprise)
Regina\'s credit is worth	(10 + 2 + 3) / 20 = 0.75 Cr
Rhylanor\'s credit is worth	(15 + 2)     / 20 = 0.85 Cr
Arkadia\'s credit is worth	(6 - 2)      / 20 = 0.25 Cr
Darrian\'s credit is worth       (16 + 2)     / 20 = 0.90 Cr (I think)

Note: since Starport class and TL tend in the same direction,
the effect is non-linear, which is fine with me.  However, I
haven\'t spent a lot of time thinking about side effects.

Back in the Army a long time ago, phone etiquette demanded we identify  the

numerous soldiers who answered "Motor Pool, Bravo Battery, Six Battalion,

had an attitude problem back then.

And of course, there is the program Newt, which is newton hosted.  Download
text into the newton from any platform you care to, and you can develop away.

It is not free, but IIRC, it was cheap (under $50).  I liked it a great
deal when I was developing, as I was thinking kind of text like at the time.

N.B. I contacted him a few days ago about publishing the DGP stuff.  He
communicated willingness on his part, but that others were in the loop and
prevented it.  Going into more details would likely be outside the bounds
of good taste, as it was email.

I care not whether Roger publishes the information; I want it available in
some form from someone.  As he holds the copyrights, he has to be in the
center of any such discussion.

If there is someone else preventing Roger from doing so, I would be happy
to call, write letters, make Dark Hints, whatever it takes.

If it is him that is in the way, then I want him to find someone able to do
this particular task, and to let them.

All I want from Marc and IG is their agreement that this would be
acceptable.  IIIRC, they are the only other players who have a legal
ability to prevent it.  Once they assure me that they are not the sticking
points, then I know it is Roger who is the problem.  If they do not, then I
do not know who is obstructing the process.

I am not asking them, mind, to say that anything he chooses to do with it
is fine, only that they would not be opposed to the old DGP stuff being re
released, perhaps in an electronic form.

I like that idea.  I would be willing to contribute, though I would want to
see the price first.

through it all yet I have one major problem.

Jump Drive and Jump Fuel volume at higher TL is MY big problem.

The book tells me that at TL 11 and at TL 15 a Jump 2 ship takes the same
amount of volume for the Jump Drive and Jump Fuel, about 23%.

An advance of 4 TL\'s and NO benefit?!?

That just does not make sense to me.  My reasons are as follows:

1.  A Jump Drive is not much more than a specialized power plant.  Every
power plant decreases volume per output with advancing TL\'s.

2.  On page 58 I am told that 35% of Jump Drive volume is accumulator.
Accumulator volume modifier goes from 0.060m3/MJ at TL 11 to 0.035m3/MJ at
TL 15.  Again volume almost is cut in half.

I\'m not sure if these reasons are as compelling to anyone else as they are
to me.  As it has been explained to me.  It might be different if Jump
technology was explained differently, i.e.. something along reaction mass
vehicle mass or something.

I am really interested in hearing what anyone else thinks.  Dave, Guy, some
input from either of you might be enlightening.

Well I\'ll get off my soap box now and let the masses help me hash this out.

I gave the worlds of the subsector a higher average tech level and a
maximum TL of 11.


The EC is described as being almost all worlds within 10 parsecs of
Easter IIRC. And, as most PEs of Solomani fame are described, largely
surviving intact throughout the Long Night.

I can think of several amusing and not so amusing ways a Force
Lieutenant might be reffered to:F.L.T. (as in "report to eff-el-tee
Jones" - for casual conversations - might be corrupted at "Float"),
Fella (corruption of F.L.),
FooL (derisive term used by Naval personnel),
ForLiu ("for-loo"),
FoLi ("Foley" - but this could result in "Report to Foli Foley" ;-)

I like F.L.T., FooL, and FoLi the most.

   I\'m curious about what previous publications you have consulted in
putting this together.  

   For example, the Easter Concord, Vegan Polity, Dingir League, and Old
Earth Union had long since fossilized within their borders by M:0--how
is that suddenly the Easter Concord decided to start expanding again?  

   Also, I note that you use the old DGP stellar data for the sector. 
You should try to get the revised stellar data included in the New Era
version of the Solomani Rim, which was published in Traveller Chronicle
#10.  If you can\'t get access to a copy, the data is available free of
charge from the author.

This is the same line of thought that motivated me to buy a copy of the
Merc:2000 rules & gazetters. Was planning on using the political and social
background from them along with TNE:FF&S as the basis for a campaign set in
the time just before or during the initial Terran/Vilani meeting at
Barnard\'s start. 

Real life, as usual, kept it from getting very far off the drawing board,
but there are some interesting possibilities. Like long range Vilani scouts
as possible explanations of UFOs.

    Well, I decided that about fifty years or so before Cleon took over on
Sylea that there was a sudden infatuation with Dumas and an idealized form of
Earth\'s seventeenth century European dueling styles.  So Dueling with rapiers
became all the rage, but instead of fading away as a fad it took hold and has
become the Sylean Noble\'s standard for doing duels.
    Now they\'ve had a couple of decades to develop it, but I wanted some clear
idea of the original styles so I could figure out how it would evolve.  Now to
answer your question I\'m presuming Rapiers (TL 12 materials tech OC) with main
gauche, Duel protocals of First, Second and Third Blood, formal seconds and all
of that.  I figure that because this is how Sylean Nobles resolve their
disputes it\'s going to have a certain force amongst the new nobles coming in.
Eventually, especially will everything thusfar posted on this thread, I\'m going
to have some fun with the 3I encountering cultures strong enough to withstand
the Noble duel culture of Sylea and maintain their own, different culture of
dueling.  But that\'s down the road, after I get the details of Sylea\'s dueling
culture set. ;)

Rob, this isn\'t going to work in Milieu 0.

Right, but Sylea\'s TL isn\'t E, it\'s C in Milieu 0, so (12+2+3)/20 = 0.85

Maybe you should use something like Exchange Rate = TL+SP+Eco/IS

TL: planetary tech level

SP: Starport (A=2, B=1, C=0, D=-1, E=-2, X=-3)

Eco: Rich=+3; Poor=-3

IS: Imperial Standard (Milieu 0=17; Milieu 1100=20; etc)

Of course, outside the Imperium the Imperial Credit might not be worth very
much at all.  Players travelling into The Outlands aren\'t going to be able
to use all those convenient Credits they have in their pockets or on their
smart cards.  They are going to have to worry about exchanging credits for
local currency, working out "arrangements" with banks for letters of
credit, bartering with hard goods, and carrying *things* that retain
intrinsic value between systems..gems, gold, iridium, platinum, silver,
etc.  BTW, I know precious metals *shouldn\'t* be all that valuable in a
cheap fusion-starfaring culture, but knowing human-type sapients they
probably will be. ;->

  I ran a campaign around 1985, after getting my hands on a copy
of Triplanetary. I kept in the early-mid 21st century, using the
limited tech and exploration assumed in that game; e.g. fusion
(aka Heplar?) drives were cutting edge military equipment, and
everything else merely took patience to get to your destination.

  Nowadays such a campaign might risk getting turned into a cyber-
punk game, but it has the advantage that you can lavish effort on
the solar system and _know_ that the players aren\'t going skip into
the next sub-sector, never to return (unless, of course, UFO abduction
is real).

How did Sylea come up with the +3 bonus, it can\'t be for a Rich world,
since Sylea\'s population is much too high for that trade classification?

Have you got Central Supply Catalogue??  There\'s mention of a TL 10
Magnum Pistol favored by the nobility for the cojones it takes to carry
a 6-shooter manual loading weapon for personal defense in a time of
lasers and plasma, etc.

Perhaps, Magnum Pistol Dueling would be the more violent form and final,
though more rarely practiced, form of dueling.

There was also an adventure published in Dragon Magazine #59 back in March
\'82, called Exonidas Spaceport, by Jeff Swycaffer.  This IIRC, is part of
the setting of "Become the Hunted" and details the characters in some of
the novels and some of the ships (in High Guard stats).

    Ok, call me curious?

    Any idea how much Roger Sanger paid for the rights to the Traveller
    related DGP stuff?  Any idea how much he would sell the rights for?
    (Presuming he actually does have the rights to these materials in
     an uncontested form).

               effort, it will be a primary factor leading to...
- -2502 (AD2015) United Nations Space Coordinating Agency (UNSCA)

- -2498 (AD2019) First permanent colony on Luna.  For apparent reasons
               (all dealing with budgetary considerations), the 2007

- -2467 (AD2050) The ESA LRCM should leave somewhat later, thus 
               allowing technology a chance to advance a bit further.
               I would place it more toward AD2070-75. 

Unlikely       Bases throughout the Solar System.  While it is
               probable that the Terrans would have throughly 
               *explored* the Solar System by 2057 (with a combination
               of manned and unmanned vessels), there would not be
               any particular incentive to establish bases everywhere.
               Why?  In 2057 (a mere 60 years from now), the 
               technology wouldn\'t exist to exploit places like the
               moons of Neptune and Uranus.  Even if it did, such
               operations would be cost prohibitive given the
               distances involved.  After the invention of jump
               drive, and contact with the Vilani, bases would
               almost certainly be established however.

Other notes:   We can safely hypothesize that a scientific revolution
takes places in the mid-21st century that yields spacecraft-sized fusion
power plants, gravitics, and most importantly, enviromental controls
that can protect astronauts and colonists from the problems associated
with staying in space for long periods of time (cosmic rays anyone?). 
There would of course be other developments in the realm of computers,
etc.

   The political situation c. AD2050 would be anybody\'s guess.  Is the
U.S. still a superpower (we do know from the Traveller history it is
still a major player in AD2086)?  What becomes of China?  Has Japan
finally went into serious decline economically (one scenario I can
foresee is a tide of Chinese immigration sweeping over Japan in the
AD2040s that revives the country but changes its basic character)? 
Europe could go off toward the sunset or arise as a phoenix as a new
"European Nationalism" develops.  Perhaps there was a Third World War in
the early 21st century, which while it caused a great deal of damage,
did not cause a decline in technology (merely a bit of stagnation) and
political realignment which set the stage for the New Renaissance.

   Playing in this era would be very interesting, what with all the
national interests and megacorps (Terran version) competing for power. 
Then there\'s that conspiracy the elites are involved in--you know, the
one involving the detection of the Vilani by a SETI listening post in
AD2045, and how the elites are covering it up...

   Sourcebook anyone?

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Streamlining Cost Modifiers:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
AF
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dimension Modifiers for:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Length
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Width
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Height
&nbsp;
Are these not supposed to be there or are they just missing. If they
are just missing does anybody have and idea what they shoul be?

Years ago I revamped my CT/MT game with the following secondary
characteristics which worked out well. I use them today in my MT
universe.

Speed - PC\'s quickness and agility. I use Action Points with 6 second
combat rounds. I use Speed in determining Initiative Roll for surprise.

Body Mass - Indicator of PC\'s overall height, weight and physique. 
I then rolled body type as normal, endomorphic, ectomorphic or
mesomorphic. Weight and height varied between sexes.

Appearance - Indication of PC\'s physical attractiveness and personal
presence. Not just surface beauty, but also physical deformaties,
personal grooming, dress, mannerism, walk, and voice. Character with low
or hight Appearance will be noticable in a crowd. It would be race and
sex specific.

Charisma - Measure of personal charm, wit, humor, attitude, social
skills and sex appeal - in short, Personality. Used only when attempting
to influence NPC\'s.

Awareness - PC\'s observational and perceptive powers. Would include
sight and hearing abilities as well as an intitutive sixth sense. High
Awareness would imply character consistently notices details.

Loyality - Measure of patriotism towards the IMPERIUM. Defined as
attitude towards, or concern for, his homeworld, family, friends and
unit. I also use it as PC\'s sense of lawfulness, intergity and sense of
honor/duty. I intergrate this into my game as the military security
clearance and credit worthlyness (bank credit line). Low loyality rarely
gets weapons permits or cooperation from Imperial organizations.

Determination - PC\'s will power, ego strength, competitiveness and
bravery. High score here would means high confidence in his abilities
and would find it hard to give up on a task. I also use this as an
indicator of psionic aptitude.

Comments please.

At these longer ranges speed of light lag will become significant.  How
about, as an advanced rule, ships using active sensors only have to tell
ships that are close enough that they could detect it _in_1_turn_.  This
would seem to me to be only those ships at range 14 or less (3AU = 1,500
light seconds = 30 light minutes = as far away as you can get
information at the speed of light in 1 turn).  When you user active
sensors you do have to tell ships at longer ranges as well- but not for
a few turns.

For example your large military ship jumps in system and uses its high
powered active sensors to scan it.  The enemy scout ship in the Oort
cloud (range = 16) is going to notice this - but not for 50 hours.

On the other hand you may be able to detect their _mass_ right away
based on the gravitational effect.  Maybe as a further refinement ships
with can detect ships instantly at long distances only if they have the
right sensors.  I don\'t have FFS2 yet, what, if anything, does it have
that would include gravitometric sensing capability ?  Maybe these would
require a whole new type of signature - the Mass Signature- dependent
soley on the targets mass.

Let\'s talk about the WSV suit which have most of the visual improovement
such device can have.

So WSV is a passive IR to UV viewer suite

I both UV and IR uses false color to make the image visible to wearer but I
was wondering what the guy can see in different wavelength during
day/night/obscurity

Day/IR : much like regular VL image but in negative (white is colder than
black). Walking people leave trace of their passage for a fiew minutes on
the ground. Engins lights the road under the car, the top of the car is
very bright because of the sun. Boats leave a long "tail" behind them

Day/UV : ? (please help)

Night/IR : Doesn\'t make many difference from day except that the image is
less precise for non living and non animate creatures/objects. The car
would still lighten the road but the hardtop would be the coldest part of
the car. The driver could be well seen inside the car.

Night/UV : ? (please help)

Obscurity/IR : Only thinks that produce heat (people/animated objects) are
visible. would Plants be visible? Would a person create sufficient IR
emission to "light" a small room?

Obscurity/UV : ? (please help)


BTW what is the difference between HRT and IR viewer?

And if it possible to seen trought walls with IR devices. Surely not a
precise image, but maybe it\'s possible to know that the next room is
inhabited by one or two people...

Thanks for help

	mine also, I prefer TNE jump drives, where fuel was
	5*jdrivedisplacement for a full jump, and not
	10%shipdisplacement per parsec.

	A private rule of thumb, saying that any if you are
	building a jump drive on a higher tech level than
	the minimum for contruction, gives a discount of 5%
	per tech-level difference, would make me much happier.

	BUT: T4 changed it the other was round ;-(

	Here is my table for fuel consuption per hull displacement

	TL/Jump	1	2	3	4	5	6
	9	10%
	10	9.5%
	11	9%	15%
	12	8.5%	14.25%	20%
	13	8%	13.5%	19%	25%
	14	7.5%	12.75%	18%	23.75%	30%
	15	7%	12%	17%	22.5%	28.5%	35%

	divide these numbers by maxjump to get fuel for 1 parsec
	divide these numbers by 5 to get jump drive displacement

	So for a 100dt scout

	tl  9 jump 1 drive : 2.0 dt +10   dt fuel per parsec
	tl 10 jump 1 drive : 1.9 dt + 9.5 dt fuel per parsec
	tl 15 jump 1 drive : 1.4 dt + 7.0 dt fuel per parsec
	tl 11 jump 2 drive : 3.0 dt + 7.5 dt fuel per parsec
	tl 12 jump 2 drive : 2.85dt + 7.12dt fuel per parsec
	tl 15 jump 2 drive : 2.4 dt + 6.0 dt fuel per parsec
	tl 12 jump 3 drive : 4.0 dt + 6.6 dt fuel per parsec
	tl 15 jump 3 drive : 3.4 dt + 5.6 dt fuel per parsec
	tl 13 jump 4 drive : 5.0 dt + 6.2 dt fuel per parsec
	tl 15 jump 4 drive : 4.5 dt + 5.6 dt fuel per parsec
	tl 14 jump 5 drive : 6.0 dt + 6.2 dt fuel per parsec
	tl 15 jump 5 drive : 5.7 dt + 5.7 dt fuel per parsec
	tl 15 jump 6 drive : 7.0 dt + 5.8 dt fuel per parsec

	So the most fuel economic would be the Jump3-TL15 Liner,
	and a Jump2-TL12 Far-Trader would as economic as a
	Jump1-TL15 Main-Trader. This IMHO does not cripple
	balance as (in TNE setting) the price is dependent
	from tech level.

	e.G. a Jump 1 drive build on Regina would cost 58.8 MCr
	while build on a TL12 world it would cost 71 local MCr,
	converts by 17/20 = 59.9 Regency MCr. If the local
	starport is poor it only converts 14/20 = 49.9 R-MCr.

Is this for any evasion >=1g?  I wonder if (for advanced rules, of
course) evasion might get a bigger mod for outstanding success on
the FC solution roll at least.  That provides an incentive for
increasing evasion.  I guess a modifier on the fire task itself
covers that as well as anything else though.

Perhaps there would be an additional + mod for ships using HEPlaR
above a certain mass.  So Large+ ships add +0.5 for any HEPlaR use
and Gigantic add +1.0 or something (in additon to what is above).
This to just cover the *huge* exhaust plumes of a BB with multi-g
HEPlaR chugging along (the reaction mas can be thousands of dtons a
burn for those suckers).

There as just a post to the TML regarding light lag and long
distance detections using these rules.  I played around with
extremely long range targets, and capitol ships will be seen from
huge distances.  Getting a FC solution on something a couple
light-hours away seems a little odd, however.  As I see it FC "lock"
is arbitrarily based on assumtions about how well you think your
weapons have a chance of doing (or how well some idealized weapons
would do).  In any case, having the computer thinking is has a good
crack at hitting at a few lhs is a little odd.

It might need to be stated that when the distance is farther than
half a turn\'s time interval light lag, a FC solution is impossible,
and only BOL weapons may be launched with any chance of sucess.  So
for BL turn lengths 15 l-minutes would be the cutoff.  Another
ideas?

On the other other hand, according to special relativity gravity
propagates at the speed of light.

However, until we are able to detect gravity waves from a nearby

Andrew Jackson, before he was president, fought a number of duels. During
one, he was struck by his opponent\'s shot but managed to remain on his feet.
Jackson insisted on taking his shot, which killed his unfortunate opponent.
Jackson evidently carried the bullet in his chest cavity througout the rest
of his life ... tough old bird.

I have a reproduction copy of a Code Duello published in South Carolina in
the 1820s, which outlines a complex series of proceedures for duels.

I also find some of the sig modifiers playable but unrealistic:
Firing weapons shouldn\'t be a sig + as the signature from a firing weapon
has nothing to do with the vessels power output etc. I can see the
playability aspect here but it\'s definately unrealistic as it gives
stealthy ships far to big an advantage. Am I missing something here or

I\'ve used a simlar system to Bruces for a couple of years and we have Mass
and Neutrino signatures as well. Mass signatures depend on the mass of the
vessel, the gravthrust/thrusterplates thrust and the volume and strength of
g-comp. The neutrino sig depends on the fusion power output and fusion
thruster thrust. The BIG advantage with neutrino sensors is that they can
be mounted inside the hull. My grav sensors works as a VERY weak
tractorbeam that doesn\'t actually tractor anything but its powerconsumtion
depends on the mass in its lobe divided by range squared. This factor makes
them impractical to mount inside the hull as the short range between
detector and hull will make the powerconsumtion enormous.

I expect that _all_ the various wavelengths will be false colored to modes
similar to what we see in daylight, since that\'s where we resolve objects
best, so no \'negative\' IR images, no \'green\' light intensifiers (which
will probably be wide spectrum by that time, anyway).

As for seeing through walls with IR, that would likely be possible,
depending on the wlls thickness. Certainly, through a thin wall, with some
observation time, you could determine who was in there.

OTOH, they can \'see\' you, too!

These are ADDS to the base sig which is more or less dependent on mass.
Adding something with logs is the same as multiplying so thats already in
there.
In my rules I have a little table for each vessel like this (replace x with
actual numbers):
            Active      Passive
Type        Reflected   Reflected   IR   Mass   Neutrino
Popup       x           x           x    x      x
Popdown     x           x           x    x      x
Fullpower   x           x           x    x      x
Idle        x           x           x    x      x
Firing      x           x           x    x      x
Thruster-A  x           x           x    x      x
Thruster-B  x           x           x    x      x
Floorfield  x           x           x    x      x
etc

The highest sig in each category is used for detection purposes and passive
sensors can see in IR and reflected. Any sig that added with sensor factor
and range subtracted gets a 0+ is told to the player if detecting using the
best sig.

Getting an FC lock has nothing to do with having a good chance of hitting
the target but the fact that you have a good measurement of where the
target is. Shooting depends on target size, range, evasion and computer
speed. Hitting at several lighthours is a no no and also you\'d just light
the ship up a bit with your HUGE dispersed laser blob.

Don\'t forget, these are extremely fast and/or stealthy *TL16* ships. And they\'d 
probably have escorts and/or decoys. I wouldn\'t like to bet my system on being 
able to stop them in time.

I have been toying with a Milleu setting like this in my head for a while. 
 Basicaly its a universe in the late 21st century.  Terrans have explored 
most of the Sol syetem.  The moon and mars are major colonies.  J-drive is 
being used for \'microjumping\' to pluto and such.  Proxima and Alpha Centauri 
systems have been explored, pending posible coloinization.  And then the 
scout mission to Barnard in 2094(?) discovers something new.

Other HUMANS in space!

I think this would be a cool Milleu setting.  Kind of a "Traveller: First 
Contact" or something.  (Hey, I like the sound of that!)

The tech level would be a moderate TL-9.  Gravatics have been developed, 
making space travel much more easier.  Grav to orbit, then kick in the TL-9 
Fusion Drives.  Most of space is dominated by belters, ever since the big 
lanthanum(or whatever) rush of 2089 in the Asteriod belt.  Luna and Mars are 
major terran colonies, with outposts at the jovian satalites and the deep 
space telescope array at Pluto and Charon.

The PC\'s could be in the Infantile Terran Scout Service, jumping to Proxima 
or Barnard just in time to contact the Vilani.  Hey It could be the PC\'s who 
fire the first shot that leads to the Interstellar wars! ;->

This is true. These really really long ranges aren\'t "combat" situations - more
refereed pre-combat situations - so  I took it as given that a referee 
would deal with the lightlag, but maybe I should spell it out.

Gravitational effects propogate at the speed of light (at least in
our universe.

FFS2 omits grav sensors (an oversight, admittedly - it should have copied
the stuff from FFS1.) My personal feeling is that even with Imperium tech
it\'s hard to build a grav sensor that can see the gravitational effects
from spacecraft rest masses at any significant distance or with any
significant accuracy, so such sensors aren\'t useful in space combat.

What Whommp? The gravitic effects of a grav-focused laser should be
localized to the Firing end only... I thought it uses the gravitics as a
lens, not a confinement beam... based solely upon FF&S 1. I can\'t see a
canfinement beam until TL16+, based upon the established TL\'s for tractors
and Repulsors... Besides, Gravitics are OBVIOUSLY some kind of field
effect.

I now have it, and like it, but I do have a question.  Why was it published
in two parts?  This required duplication of some 25 pages or so of material
between the two, as otherwise, needed information would not be present.
This seemed inefficient, though I can see a number of reasons why this
could have been the best way to print it.  (Timing of a major convention,
IG policy that adventures should be short, etc.)

I found it quite worth buying, and will recommend it to people, but I was
surprised at the amount of material on, for example, the Sidurii cluster
that was needed twice.

Another point is that the person being challenged usually gets to choose the 
weapons and sometimes the conditions of the duel.

Quoting TNE Regency Sourcebook p83 Referees\' Library Data

"The Darrians
The Star Trigger
Through much of their recent history the fabled Darrian Star Trigger was
only a bluff. The Maghiz event of -924 was the result of Darrian
activities, but the Darrians were unable to reproduce the event. By keeping
this fact a secret, the Darrians were able to use the purported star
trigger as a powerful deterent weapon.

However, by the late 1110\'s they were able to isolate the true chain of
events that caused the catastrophic flaring, and by the later 1120s were
able to produce a functional star trigger weapon."

Nasty.

In Emperor\'s Arsenal, under Pistol, Laser - 13 it states; Never issued in
any significant numbers, they were still in the field testing stage when
production stopped. 

Earlier in the paragraph, it states that the RoM Laser PIstol was more
innovative, though less refined as the Vilani ones.

To make a long story short (TOO LATE), RoM was a shaky 13. The Vilani were a
solid 11. Like our society, certain technologies had surged ahead of others,
creating social instability. If the Terrans had slowed down their tech
surge, they might have been able to come up with a solution to ruling the
vast former Vilani Empire. But, without the tech surge (some areas reached a
very unreliable TL 14-15) they would not have had the drive to defeat the
Vilani.  The ferocity to kick an old empire over negates the possibility of
stability after. It takes a while to calm down after an adrenaline rush,
whether it is a society or an individual. The ancient Greeks fighting Persia
is a good parallel. The sheer will of the city states to remain free
prevented them from uniting after the immediate threat, and the methodology
for one problem was transferrred to other problems. It took an outsider,
assimilated in many Greek ways to end the wars and finish off the Persians.
American proclivity to firearms is a good modern example; it has been
proposed that since America was born in violence, and since that was the
solution to the first Problem, it follows that it is the solution to all of
them. But it gives America a dynamism that few countries have ever, or will
ever possess. If America dies, it will die in violence. Canadians tend to
see solutions in terms of new laws, as we were born by an act of
legislation. When we die, it will be because we legislated ourselves out of
existence.

Changing Careers. Sometimes, at one point in life or another, a person may
change his chosen occupation. For most people this is not an easy thing to
accomplish. Often, it is not so much a result of choice as of necessity: a
mandatory retirement due to injury, or a failure to continue. Still, some
people simply choose to quit their current career in order to attempt a new
one. Within the Traveller game system, a change in career occurs when a
character ends character generation and begins adventuring.
A character may also change careers and begin a new career in a different
field. After mustering out of his or her first career, the character may
attempt the entire career process in a new field.

Rolls for a second career (enlistment, injury, promotion, and continuance)
are subject to a DM of -2; all rolls for a third career are subject to a DM
of -3. All other DMs, qualifications, and preferences apply.

*** is someone really subject to a greater chance of injury in a second
career?

A character with a commission in a previous career automatically receives a
commission in the new career with a rank one less than the highest obtained
previously.

*** Commissioned rank gets a new commission at rank-1. What about enlisted?
Does it apply at the high end of the spectrum (E7-8-9 and O7-8-9).

Are some second careers precluded? 

Any other comments?

It was a while ago that I read that novel, but basically all the major
Terran cities put domes over themselves and, using some form of
propulsion and anti-grav, become mobile space vehicles. Each city
developed a culture all its own, but eventually their machinery began
wearing out. At the time of the novel there were only a few of them
left.

Yes, I know.  But the basic emission sig has to to with PP output,

Whatever you call an FC Lock it is arbitrary.  A FC solution is the
point at which you release you weapon to fire.  It has nothing to do
with to-hit, it is what you program your FC system to think "this is
good enough to release weapons."  So it has everything to do with
what your FC system _thinks_ about the chance of hitting.

You can take a shot at Impossible task level, so I\'d say that if the
computer says that the task is past impossible, you don\'t have a
"Lock."  You could just as well say that you don\'t have a Lock until
Average task level attempts are possible (tight weapons
control----wait until you see the whites of their eyes as it were).

For lightspeed weapons, the computer has one set of FC guidelines,
for missiles another.  A missile with some form of terminal guidance
can be fired with very rough data on where the target is, it\'ll
adjust for changes as it approaches.

You should put it on your "to read" list anyway, but there are
some basic assumptions in that story that don\'t fit with
Traveller.  I\'ve considered taking some ideas from it and
Traveller-izing them, but none of them really worked well.  The
idea I liked best was their concept of anagathics; the biggest
problem was that they were _too_ good - someone on a regimen of
them was virtually guaranteed to live forever (barring accidents,
etc.).  But rather than one single drug, they had a whole series
of them, each of which focussed on a different aspect of the
problem.

I sneakily divided all the active sensor sensitivies and signatures by two
(effectively) to save players from having to multiply by two while playing.
I think this is the right approach - but it does have two bad consequences:
active sensors have to use a different detection probabilities table (which
drops off faster) and active signatures are really, really coarse (only 4 
different values - -0.5 to +1.5 or so - as you go from missiles to Tigress.)
On the other hand, it has the advantage that active and passive sensitivity
numbers are directly comparable - an A13 and P13 have roughly the same
effective range - whereas if we doubled range factors for active you;d have to
have a A26 and a P13, which looks confusing to me.

No, you\'re not missing something - clever weasel that you are you\'ve picked
up on subtlties that everyone else missed. What Anders is saying is that
(since it\'s a log scale) the "+0.5 sig" for a 100-MW scout is a lot less
power than "+0.5 sig" for a 10000-MW cruiser; simplifying things to say that
"extra (heat) due to weapons fire is proportional to power plant output"
(which is not a bad simplification - the bigger the ship, the more weapons it
has.) However, as Anders noticed, I\'m also implicitly saying that weapons
fire on a 0-sig scout is more power than a -1 sig scout-with-baffling, even
if they are identical in all other aspects.

As a playability issue this is obvious - the only practical alternative 
would be to rate the ship;s signature while firing during design, and get a big
signatgure table like Anders. My mental justification was that stealthing
or masking includes putting effort into things like baffling your lasers
so they radiate less waste heat, cool off faster, etc, so a stealthy ship\'s
lasers really do produce less extra signature than a non-stealthy. This is
similar to the real world - if you design a stealthy aircraft you design it to
have stealthy weapons. It would be more accurate tomake people pay for
"baffled lasers" or soemthing like that - but I didn\'t do the FFS laser rules
and anyway the system is pushing the level of complexity most people are willing
to live with (opinions, anyone?)

>I\'ve used a simlar system to Bruces for a couple of years and we have Mass
>and Neutrino signatures as well.
It\'s a judgement call. My opinion is that even with 3-I tech grav and
neutrino sensors aren\'t good enough to detect spacecraft at significant
ranges. Among other issues, you have to have a way of sheilding your detector
against unwanted gravity and neutrinoes - otherwise grav variations from
people on your own ship, and neutrinoes from your own power plant and from
the sun, swamp the hostile signal. If you *have* such a way of blocking 
neutrinoes, why not just apply it to the power plant so no-one else can
see your neutrinoes?

Anyway, with the Realistic Sensor Model (tm) ships are very easy to detect
just with IR, so (in my opinion) neutrino sensors and grav sensors would add
little (except for detecting people hiding behind rocks.)

Anders - would you be willing to move this discussion to gdw-beta? I think
you and I could discuss sensors well, well past the tolerance of most TML
readers. (Although any TML reader has to have been pretty tolerant by
definition to survive the Task Wars and the Great Second Empire debate.)

Didn\'t he also kill a man with a Bowie knife? Also before he was President.
Speaks volumes for the changes in the "acceptable behavior" tolerated from
public officials.

Makes one wonder what manner of behavior is tolerated from nobles in the
Imperium, and whether or not all Imperial citizen are in any way equal.

But then that\'s a very complex and loaded question best left in the realm
of the philosophical.

Or is it? :)

Not obviously.

If you do the math, if you want the grav focusser to be a point source 
right in front of the laser, it has to have a field of tens of G\'s to 
bend the light enough - possibly thousands depending on the geometry. 
To me, this seemed implausible.

On the other hand, if grav focussing is a gravity wave travelling along with
the light, continously bending the light inward as diffraction bends it outward,
the required field is a G or less - nice and easy. It doesn\'t really carry
much energy, either, so you can\'t use it as a weapon or a defence or a sensor.
A grav field right in front of the laser has tens of meters to bend the
light, so it needs strengths of thousands of G\'s -  a travelling pulse has
thousands of km.

Put it this way: which do you find more plausible at moderate TL:

(a) a point souce of thousands of G\'s
(b) a travelling pulse of 1 G

I find (b) much more plausible. I think it actually made it into FFS2 as
canon (ha!). And, finally, it allows you to have cool sound effects during
battles (or even have the pulse rock the whole ship if it\'s a big laser and
a small ship), which is a nice effect. (The latter requires exaggeration of the
needed fields but might be worth it for drama.)

I have been using the Darrian as the bogeymen of the area.  I had a fair
number of Darrian ships survive, and go awandering post Maghiz.  wherever
they show up, they are a number of tech levels up from the locals, and
dangerous to boot.  Because they do not like coercion, they tend to help
people who want to escape it, and because they are not expansionistic, the
PE rulers whose populations have gotten suddenly very feisty have no idea why.

I ran a scenario in 1120 where the players found out that the Darrians had
lost the Star Trigger for a while, and had recently regained it.
Unfortunately, they found out about losing it first, and reported it to
various spy agencies they worked for.  Then when they found out the
Terrible Truth, nobody believed them.

Imagine the horror and shock on the part of the players when they realized
that the Darrians never back down from a bluff, and thus were quite serious
about their threat to blast a dozen stars into novae, flattening the
Zhodani consulate and the nascent Regency.  Further, nobody believed them,
and they were actually sympathetic to the Darrian cause, so they needed a
way to convince everyone to back off, without undercutting Darrian power.

Be aware: in my universe, the Darrian confederation of 1200 is back to full
size, and is up to TL17 on three planets.  They are holding there until
they have all of the planets of the confederacy up to at least TL16, which
they expect to take about 100 years.

They are not making a big deal of it, as they do not want to be disturbed.
The deal with Norris where the Regency made TL16 ships based on the Darrain
model actually happened, but was a double reversal.  Most people thought
that the Darrian ships had been given to Norris to aid in his tech, the
clever realized that the Regency contributed more than the Darrains, and
the truly connected realized that these ships were nothing compared to the
Darrian ships of the line.

Note: the Regency would be most horrified If It Only Knew - the real reason
the Darrians were not affected overmuch by the Virus was that their own
computers had a more stable, if more primitive, form of it installed
already.  Virus advanced Darrian understanding of AI by at least fifty
years.  The Regency can preen and strut about never making a deal with the
Virus, but they have a large power that did so a long time in the past
right on their border.

Hmmmm... Interesting. Your house rule comes close to the values I looked

Maybe you\'re reinventing the wheel in this case?

Marc, I hate to say it, but this rule isn\'t any better than the
only-one-career rule.  I won\'t play with it.  Its even a bit worse,
IMHO.  I think the rule in T4.0 of DM -2 to enlistment per subsequent
career is fine.  It makes it difficult enough to have several careers
but gives the possibility of having a neat character (gratuitous example
deleted ;-)

Also, the DM on all rolls is extreme.  I will never play with these
rules as you\'ve written them.  Sorry   :-(

I always thought this was a bit gratuitous, but you real military types
would know better than me.  BTW, does this mean that you get a bonus
muster out roll and skill for each military career?

An injured or exposed rogue might be forbidden from the Military  and
Noble service due to criminal past.  An exposed Agent would have a tough
time of it as a Rogue.

 The larger issue concerning careers is the relatively few
opportunities.  Basically it Military (Army, Navy, Marines, Scouts),
Dilettante (Noble, Entertainer), \'Business\' (Merchant, Rogue) and
Scholar.  Very similar to the old Warrior, Wizard, Rogue archetypes of
fantasy RPGs. If anything, Traveller should have more than simple
variations on that basic theme (although that may not be possible).  Of
course these categories are \'adventurous\' and PCs are more likely to
come from these backgrounds.  I guess my qualm is the insistence that a
character have an \'official\' career for at least a 4 year stretch.
Looking around the people I know, I would say that a great many of them
don\'t have \'careers\' at all.  Yet somehow they muddle through.  Yet I
love the traveller Char Gen system overall.  I think it would be
broadened by having a few more careers.  But also some standardized way
to generate a character who hasn\'t already led an adventurous life but
is beginning one.  When you generate a Marine for example and he gets an
injury and an MCUF or something, he already had the adventure.  The
insurance agent laboring away for a number of years in an office may
spend all his spare time learning to fence, or shoot, or star sailing,
or studying xenobiology, waiting for the day he can quit his job and
seek passage on a starship to see what happens.  Of course, I may be
transferring a lot   ;-)

Laser sights for pistols sell for about $400.00, and are about the size
of a cigarette lighter.  "Sight" isn\'t the right word; it\'s really a

environments, possessed NBC (Nuclear, Biological, Chemical)

Battledress, these days). 
Add in the Chameleon option, and you had great concealment. The CES was
especially useful in mercenary operations against prestellar-tech enemies

All in all, the CES was one of the best value-for-money outfits in the

but not the scenario which is, IMO, one of the best near-future RPG

Most of the \'cyberpunkish\' stuff in the CP game really bites, since it has
shown its age very quickly with advancing technology. But the NO and DS
modules, despite a few technical inaccuracies, still have some great
material. 

And finally - they acknowledge "Mark W. Miller" (sic.) along with Gerard
O\'Neill and Werner Von Braun as major influences on their material - thus
recognising Traveller\'s place as the progenitor of SF-RPGs. 

Check them out. Very worthwhile if you\'re considering a near-future space
exploration game.

The Perseids are one of the better annual showers; they\'ve dinged Mir
twice, NASA doesn\'t fly shuttles during their peak period, and they tend to
produce lots of big bright meteors.  In 1992 they were coming at a rate of
400 per hour; although they\'ve declined a bit since then they still put on
a great show.

	In order to observe them, head outside after midnight; the darker
the skies the better.  Look up.  Enjoy.  For more info, pick up the August
issue of Sky&Telescope at your local newsstand, or scope the following URL:

http://www.ticetboo.demon.co.uk/perseids.htm

It\'s a complete guide to the Perseids and how to observe them.

	Our gaming group has a semi-major expedition planned this year;
we\'re heading out to a dark-sky site out in the boonies, and weather
permitting will be observing all night long and sending our data in to the
IMO.  It\'s a worthwhile project; it helps advance science and promises to
be a lot of fun.  For neophyte amateur astronomers meteor observations are
one of the easiest astronomical projects; all you need is paper, lawn
chair, and warm clothes.  Telescopes, binoculars, and so forth are mostly
useless.

Good points - I admit that I interpreted \'almost all\' as \'most\'.  Perhaps I
should push the Concord\'s borders out a little...BTW, if anyone can send me
the data on subsector\'s M, N, O and P of the Diaspora Sector (in the
\'Astrogators Guide\' ?), I would be grateful...otherwise I\'ll use the DGP
Second Survey data.

On tech levels, I see your point.  I believe that I\'ll push up the tech
levels within the Concord, given that the polity has been stable for 1700
years...outside the Concord however, given that most of those 1700 years
were isolationist, I\'m tempted to leave as is or even push down a little.

Thanks for your input Chris.

It\'s tough getting your hands on a lot of the less available material down
here.  Supplement 10: The Solomani Rim, Alien Module 6:  Solomani and
Solomani and Aslan were used.  Unfortunately, I\'ve as yet been unable to
source the Trav Digest/MT journal issues that dal with the area.

\'Suddenly start\' is probably overstating it.I envisaged a slower (almost
glacial at first) process that picked up momentum in later years in
response to external events (the growing power of the expanding Aslan
Heirate, increasing expansion by other former Terran colonies (particularly
in the Aldebaran and Alpha Crucis sectors).  Also, at least one of thge
states, The Old Earth Union, would have to start looking outwards again
soon if, after 212 Imperial,  \'Terran exploration ships and merchant
cruisers began plying the space spinward of Magyar\' (Solomani & Aslan p62).
 It would make sense that the other states (except possibly the Vegans)
also began looking beyond their borders.

However, the dates can be adjusted, perhaps to place the 001-25 data at the
beginning of the acceleration, rather than a half-century to century into it.

For my campaign, the whole idea was to present the area as being in
transition from it\'s old moribund and isolationist state, into a period of
at least cautious expansion (reluctantly, but pragmatically)...a process
that has it\'s opponents.

Good idea, as I believe I have TC#10 in the bookshelf.  I used the DGP
data, then removed most of the dwarf and M class main sequence stars
without habitable zones.  Class VI stars were also altered, as were some
class IV ones (K5-9, M0-9).

YES!!! Thank you! The only suggestion I would have is that you might want to
have it be a straight -2 per career after the first, thus -4 to enter a
third career. This would make three career characters rarer, and thus
prevent abuse. (I unofficially limit the characters in my campaign to two
careers anyway.)
I assume Education "careers" are not counted toward this total :)

Thanks, Marc :)

Here is the current text from T4 for second careers.

Changing Careers. Sometimes, at one point in life or another, a person may
change his chosen occupation. For most people this is not an easy thing to
accomplish. Often, it is not so much a result of choice as of necessity: a
mandatory retirement due to injury, or a failure to continue. Still, some
people simply choose to quit their current career in order to attempt a new
one. Within the Traveller game system, a change in career occurs when a
character ends character generation and begins adventuring.
A character may also change careers and begin a new career in a different
field. After mustering out of his or her first career, the character may
attempt the entire career process in a new field.

Rolls for a second career (enlistment, injury, promotion, and  continuance)
are subject to a DM of -2; all rolls for a third career are subject to a DM
of -3. All other DMs, qualifications, and preferences apply.

*** is someone really subject to a greater chance of injury in a second
career?

A character with a commission in a previous career automatically =
receives a
commission in the new career with a rank one less than the highest =
obtained
previously.

*** Commissioned rank gets a new commission at rank-1. What about =
enlisted?
Does it apply at the high end of the spectrum (E7-8-9 and O7-8-9).

Are some second careers precluded?=20

Any other comments?

I thought it has always been 26-7+atmosphere as the denser the
atmosphere the more water there is likely to be.

There were a number of us who looked at the draft before it went to IG, and
I just want to say, in the last draft *I* saw this formula was correct. 

However, I viewed the draft using Word 6.0 and Dave used the formula editor
and saved it using Word 95. I had continuing trouble getting formulas to
display correctly. I\'d get all kinds of strange things instead of "pi" or
"times" or "square root", depending on the size of the fonts or the shape
of the formula area..and the phase of the moon. ;-< If I saved a file with
those strange things showing that\'s how they got saved too.  

I wonder if the IG folks (or printers) had a similar problem, but not
*knowing* the screwed up formulas didn\'t make sense....

Good question.  I know people that have moved from Marines to Army and Navy
to Marines, but I don\'t know how much, if any, rank they lost. Losing 1 or
2 levels seems reasonable.

>Does it apply at the high end of the spectrum (E7-8-9 and O7-8-9).

I\'d be inclined to say that once you get to E or O 7+, any time in another
*service* would be more a matter of cross-training/posting than an actual
career change.  Admiral Dudley leaves the Imperial Navy to accept a
commission as General Dudley..I\'ve got my doubts.

>Are some second careers precluded? 

Probably, not.

>Any other comments?

It might work best to have a PC start at the bottom for all careers.  If
you\'ve spent 16 years in the Navy working  your way up to Captain, the
player is going to think twice about starting a second career in the Army
as a 2nd Lt.  Doing this the PC can switch to any career, but there is a
severe penalty for doing so, especially once they\'ve built up some tenure.

Does this mean that there will be a THUDDD voting catagory this month
entitled "best bargain on the lot, er....ahem, I mean on the tarmack." :)
This lowest bidder thing may mean that some SDB are not exactly the best
money can
buy but the best that the Kaguk Fishfarmers Cooperative can afford to
protect thier great Red Tarbot stocks. Hey, wait a minute, that\'s an idea...

I still think 400 tons is the ideal size for an SDB. :)

Will you be giving us an example ship to emulate or scorn? Or is this ship
catagory too open ended for something like this?

Well, it shows, as I feared would happen, T4 is less hard sci-fi than any
previous incarnation pf trav. It violates one of marc\'s rules for the
traveller millieu... no zapotron rays. Any grav-pulse CAN BE a weapon of
it\'s own. I recieved 5-6 "hate mails" off-list when I pointed it out during
a previous discussion.

And also insures that I will not buy FF&S2. At least not new. T4 keeps
changing the mechanics of the UNIVERSE... (t\'were me big complaint bout
TNE\'s lack of T-Plates).

I cannot see a "travelling pulse" at all... as all known gravity effects
that have been measurable have been uniform field effects.

As for Whomping the ship, any laser HIT WILL create a whomp, as the
affected point of impact is vaporized, and creates a thrust.

To make a long story short (TOO LATE), RoM was a shaky 13.

   Interesting implications for MMT users.  Nothing new here for the
Traveller Canon Orthodoxy.

   Using this logic, the most technologically advanced societies today
should be the most unstable.  We\'re talking about the U.S., Japan, and
select countries in Western Europe (i.e. Switzerland).  Ooops!  All
those countries are by far the most *stable*.

   Rapid technological advance will not bring about instability in a
culture, but on the other hand, it doesn\'t guarantee it either.   

>But, without the tech surge (some areas reached a very unreliable TL 14-15) 
>they would not have had the drive to defeat the Vilani.  

   Speaking from the Traveller perspective, there is enough of a
difference between TL 11 and TL 12 that it would have given the Terran a
decisive enough advantage so that TL 13+ would not be required.

   From the Marc Miller\'s Traveller perspective, my impression was that
the Terrans don\'t go beyond TL 12 until *after* the Vilani Empire fell,
thus rendering your point moot.

   Well the Macedonians claimed to be Greek--even though the people from
the city-states thought of them as country hicks who should stay on the
other side of the mountians (funny...they still treat them the same way
today...).

   The primary reason that instability develops in the wake of an
empire\'s collapse has to do more with the power vacuum that gets created
than any failings on the part of the conquerers.  In cases where the
conquerers are able to "fill the shoes" of the previous government,
instability is less of a problem.

   While some Americans talk big, and a few of the crazier ones shoot
first and ask questions later, the vast majority of Americans see
firearms as a last resort, and pretty much always have (remember the
Declaration of Independence talks about how the Colonies tried to
resolve things peaceably first).  In the movies, the hero is the one who
takes up arms in response to violence or the threat of violence.  This
is a case where Hollywood reflects the people\'s attitudes and beliefs.

   In frontier days, people had no choice but to take up arms, since
bandits, ruffins, and the occasional band of natives could slaughter you
days (or weeks) before help could arrive.  Today, bandits and ruffins
still exist (though the natives now run casinos--these are still
potentially dangerous to your wallet), as does \'911\' and large police
forces who usually arrive in time to clean up the mess after somebody
breaks in to your home.  For this reason people generally still feel the
need to be armed.

>If America dies, it will die in violence.

   If America dies, it will be because the majority of people would
rather have the government take care of them instead of taking care of
themselves.  America is a set of ideas more than a set of borders.  When
those ideas die, America will go with them.

   Not to tell you how to run your country (that\'s not my job), but IMHO
before Quebec or the other provinces would be allowed to secede, they
would have to do so with the sword, not the pen.  "Anything worth having
is worth fighting for", so said somebody before my time.

Alien Star was a UK traveller fanzine from 81 to 82. Were there only 8

Were there only 2 issues of FASA\'s Far Traveller Magazine?

Were there only 5 issues of FASA\'s High Passage Magazine?

Did FASA ever publish the promised double adventure A8 - Piracy/Stardust

Both were meant to come out summer 82.

You guessed right, in that IG expect future adventure booklets to be 64
pages in length, and there was no way that we were going to be able to
squeeze the 100 pages of TLWH into 64 pages. We intended that the 50-odd
star systems should be detailed in both books but there was insufficient
room in LWH, so these were left for Gateway. We pointed out at the time that
there would be some duplication between the books, and encouraged IG to go
for a 100 page campaign booklet, but they had made their mind up (printing
costs, and all that). Hopefully the extra adventure we put in each book
will, to some degree, compensate.

>I found it quite worth buying, and will recommend it to people...

Thanks! :-) David and I are receptive to any criticisms anyone might have,
particularly anything that might help for the next adventure we\'re writing
for IG.

A closed structure is one that doesn\'t easily fit one of the other
descriptions, yet has a compact design. It doesn\'t look like a box,
sphere or wedge/needle. Offhand I can\'t think of an example of such a
ship.

>What is an open structure hull?

An open structure has a lot of "space" between the parts. The best
example would be the Constellation class starships in Star Trek. The
hulls are seperate from each other with connecting structures in
between. This hull IMO would be best for a carrier that you don\'t want
to land in an atmosphere, as all that surface area allows the small
craft to launch at once.

	Yeah... the production values on the game etc are generally pretty
high.  When you read the manual, scope out the blurb on the flamethrower;
it had Ross, myself, and another of our players laughing like hyaenas in
the subway.  Think we scared some passengers :).

	If you need any help through sticky spots let me know; I\'m
currently playing my way through M2 for about the 4th time or so.

	And you should dig the textures on the alien ships.  The guy who
came up with them had a pretty good if rather warped take on what H.P.
Lovecraft was driving at; Lounge Cthulhu :).

	Have fun.

	A few years back, Pierre Trudeau, who was PM for most of the 70\'s
and early 80\'s and IMHO one of the best PM\'s we\'ve ever had (prepare for
explosions from K.C. and Pierre-Louis on this one ;>) was walking out of a
restaurant when he was accosted by a comedian, whose schtick was to pose as
an annoying interviewer, accost celebrities, subject them them to a
fast-paced barrage of obnoxious questions, and show tape thereof on his
show (which was actually kinda funny; I used to watch it when it was on).

	At the time well into his 70\'s, Trudeau spun, kicked him in the
crotch in front of dozens of witnesses _and_ a couple of TV cameras, and
continued on his way unperturbed.  It was a good kick, too.

	Gotta love the guy for that :).

	Actaully, this whole grav focussed lasers question has always made
me wonder why gravitational weapons, either suddenly creating lenslike
point sources in the target\'s galley, er, bridge, or hitting it with
travelling pulses, haven\'t been developed for higher TL\'s in Traveller.

	I mean, let\'s face it; their destructive potential is _enormous_
<evil mad scientist laughter> and they\'d just be a logical extension of
either the grav point source lens or travelling annular pulse technologies.
I can just see an Ancient-level weapon that just collapsed targets into
little balls of superdense...

I don\'t think you understand.  I don\'t have windows 95, so the box is going
to sit on a shelf until I upgrade (probably when I get my next computer).
Of course, the place I got it for such a good price doesn\'t take returns
(even in the shrink wrap).  The joke\'s on me.

I think David\'s point is about the drive itself, more than the fuel.

The Classic Traveller model that requires immense amounts of fuel relative
to ship tonnage has an immense effect on the style and design of starships
in the Traveller unvierse.  Changing the quantity of fuel required
significantly would invalidate all the MT and CT ship designs (Well, the MT
designs are a bit different anyway) for use as T4 ships.  Right now, the
ships from those rules are pretty much usable (especially the important
large scale deck plans from seeker, DGP, FASA and others).

I despised TNE, not because of Virus, but because of Heplar drives, jump
drive changes, and the huge alterations in ship design.  There was also the
cultural change that made things like a Kinunir practically impossible to
encounter at all.

T4 is Classic Traveller, modified.  I advocate playing by the spirit of CT,
which requires the handicapping of Jump capable ships in this way over
non-jump capable ships.

You should go back and read T4. This is essentially the text from T4 on
second career.

My basic position on second careers is that they shouldn\'t be allowed for
humans. Your second career is adventuring. After I did that post, and I got a
wave of responses saying second careers are in T4 and we need to keep that, I
looked it up. The text above is the result.

   I did not work on this project, so I don\'t know.  (How could I answer
   your question then?  Basically, I\'m an old fogie who\'s seen this
   equation and others like it many times before.)   But the problem
   smells like software incompatability ---- the writers used one type of
   software, the printers another.  Often (always) non-standard characters
   like times signs and so on change their meaning from one program to
   another.  The printers should have known better (assuming this is the
   cause of the problem) and insisted (and checked) that the writers
   use appropriate software.

   (Occasionally, the writer is at fault for these problems; he tries to
   do an end-run around the software requirements by using his own
   favorite word processor and then doing some alleged `conversion\' to
   the required format while not checking his output.  Printers are
   usually pretty good at spotting this idiocy, but sometimes a writer
   is sufficiently clever enough to get himself into real trouble doing
   this.)

   It just goes to show that software is NO substitute for a
   professional editor who is in contact with both the writer and the
   typesetter.

* Introduction

* Setting
With the setting zoomed down to this scale, it\'s easier to encourage play
in a single star system. I think the sheer size of a star system should
be emphasized in this setting and more detail on each system should be
included to encourage interplanetary Traveller play.

* Characters
Characters are unlikely to own their own ships in this setting - the
stellar economy and trade opportunities will be so much smaller than in
the interstellar economy of the TI. It will be important for players to
belong to organizations to get out into space - Weyland Utani type
corporate employees etc will be the norm. Space travel will probably
still be relatively expensive.

* Mechanics
Keep this a source book rather than a complete game - T4 game
mechanics are largely unnecessary apart from setting specific rules
changes which should mostly concern character creation.

* The Solar System
Some decent maps of Earth/Luna and a terraformed Mars, plus details of
orbital stations and facilities (is there an orbital elevator?) Also,
I agree that nearby stars should be included, but I\'d extend that out to
a subsector\'s worth of systems. With only a moderate number of systems
being detailed, it would be feasible to provide system maps of each.
* Vehicles and Equipment

* Organizations (reasons for adventuring)
Will the UN or whoever have a navy? If they haven\'t fought any wars in
space yet this seems unlikely; or at least the Navy will be small and
inexperienced. There will probably be a science and mapping organization
- - but not a scout service as we know it. There will probably be some
equivalent of Larry Niven\'s ARM (the united nation\'s police force);
corporations/commercial concerns are important too.

* The grand story that is being resolved... moving toward a discovery of
jump drive and the Vilani.
Give the background in the form of a history that the referee can jump into
at any point of choice. I\'d begin about 20 years before the discovery of
jump space to allow adventure in the Sol system alone, and take it up to
the beginning of the war against the Vilani (when was this???)

* Sample scenario???? Very important.

This setting is a great opportunity to create a game that is traveller -
yet has a significantly
different more gritty, 2300AD type feel to it.

   Using this logic, the most technologically advanced societies today
should be the most unstable.  We\'re talking about the U.S., Japan, and
select countries in Western Europe (i.e. Switzerland).  Ooops!  All
those countries are by far the most *stable*.

Are they? Democracy provides a release valve. A sort of controlled anarchy.
And look how hard it was for the USA to maintain a common face amongst its
allies during the rough days of the cold war when we actually were afraid of
the USSR. Perhaps I should have phrased it more like saying that once you
get repeated successes on a certain path, it tends to be positive
reinforcement on that behaviour. This provides a distinction from merely
unstable to excessively dynamic.

But Canada\'s multicultural policy (good idea, lousy excecution) guarantees
that it won\'t be worth saving by that time. Nobody has any loyalty to Canada
itself (or at least, not enough to matter)

Maybe it hasn\'t been invented or perfected yet in Milieu: Zero?  At

	I think you\'re encountering a fundamental difference between the
U.S. and the Canadian conception of their respective statehoods.  Canada is
a loose confederation (in fact the loosest on Earth in terms of federal
power) of a few large former British colonies.  Our federal structure was
designed to allow provinces a great deal of autonomy; it\'s not too far off
the mark to see it more as an association of provinces rather than one big
country.  Our country was built because it made administrative sense, not
to champion the democratic ideal (which, nevertheless, we\'ve adopted
because it\'s right and it works).  The provinces came together because it
was mutually advantageous; it makes a certain amount of sense to allow them
to leave, on fair terms that are acceptable to all Canadians, if the deal
sours.

	This assumption seems to be built right in to our constitutional
amendment process.  It is possible to amend a province out of
Confederation; this would require assent from what in practical terms would
a large supermajority of Canadians and the provincial legislatures.

	The problem with the separatist movement is that it claims to be
able to unilaterally declare independence on the basis of a 51% or higher
referendum vote, unfairly short-circuiting the constitutional amendment
process.  This claim is false (I\'ll spare you the constitutional details
:>) and undemocratic since 51% of Quebec\'s electorate is under 10% of the
country\'s population.  While the racist and ethnocentric nature of the
separatist movement is why I\'m against it, the fact that the current PQ
government seems willing to flout the Charter of Rights and Freedoms (our
equivalent of your Bill of Rights) and the rule of law doesn\'t make me
think any more highly of them.

	However, should the PQ government eventually manage to negotiate
their way out of Confederation in a manner that respects the rule of law
and Canada\'s national interests, I will willingly accept that result; it\'d
be a very Canadian solution, arrived at in a democratic manner.

	So basically, and here comes the ObTrav, you shouldn\'t assume that
all countries or political units in Trav are put together and hang together
like the US; I\'m sure that out there in the Imperium there are loose
confederations of smaller political units that hold together because it
make political and economic sense.  Travellers might very well encounter
citizens who put their local political entity\'s interests above the larger
collectivity\'s, and who aren\'t firecely and ideologically patriotic;
they\'re merely patriotic because it makes sense...  Basically, politics in
Traveller should hopefully transcend the dreaded "Yanks in Space" syndrome
:).

One and the same. A.k.a., "the primordials." I ran Knightfall some years
back, so I know what you\'re talking about.

The Sparklers were detailed more in the lettercol section of MegaTraveller
Journal #4, the last Traveller publication put out by DGP in 1991 or
thereabouts. It was DGP\'s intention that the threat coming out of the
galactic core that was causing the Zhodani so many problems was to be the
Sparklers. The Sparklers were a race of psionic nautiloids who were
inadvertantly throwing the Zhodani Consulate into chaos by somehow
undermining the psionic basis of their government.

IIRC, the Sparklers were also referred to in the World Builder\'s Handbook.

You might wan tto think carefully about what to do about
sensors. FFS2 sensors are very different from existing ones...I\'ve posted
conversion rules to rate old sensors on the new scale, but this is somewhat
unfair, as the old ones don\'t precisely match (they\'re generally a lot
cheaper.) You might want to run this THUDD with only the old sensors.

On the hand...I think the new sensor rules are fairly cool, and especially
neat for things like an SDB where stealth and sensitivity are
important. I\'m hoping to write some QSDS-style sensor packages with the 
FFS2 sensors (if there\'s interest....) possibly this weekend. If I do
that, you could require everyone to use new sensors. But my main point is
that you should require one or the other.

You\'d have to show me the numbers to persuade me that this would 
possibly work. Grav focussing has to bend the laser path by several
arcseconds - to do that with a (quasi-static) field close to the 
ship would require fields in the thousands of Gs; gravity just doesn\'t
bend light by that much unless it has a long time to act over. (The
sun bends light by about an arcsecond, but the force has a long path
length - order of the radius of the sun - to act along. To get the same
bending with a path length of meters would requires thousands or
millions of Gs.) (And that ignores the fact that the beam would
diffract again as it leaves the grav focussing radius. To get the ranges
Traveller lasers have, the (glass) focal array would actually have to
launch a diverging beam, which would get caught by the grav focus at
a beam diameter big enough to give you the range you want and bent
back into a focussed beam. That would require black-hold level
gravity.

I hope this doesn\'t count as hate mail...The travelling pulse has to
have field strengths around a G and a duration (as measured by
someone "hit" by the pulse) of only a millisecond or so (the duration
of the laser pulse) and a diameter of a few meters.
That\'s not a weapon; even suggesting that it
goes "whomp" was a considerable exaggeration on my part. Even a ship
small enough to be fully inside the pulse would be accelerated at a 
G for a millisecond - you\'d never even notice.

On the other hand, if you can make point source fields of tens (your
interpretation) or thousands-millions (what the math demands) of
G\'s, that sounds like a nasty weapon to me - maybe not at ship combat
ranges, but certainly for point defence or ground combat. 

>I cannot see a "travelling pulse" at all... as all known gravity effects
>that have been measurable have been uniform field effects.

Have you ever heard of gravity waves?

Admittedly, they haven\'t been detected yet, but the GR equations 
allow for travelling waves in a relatively straightforward way. There
is indirect evidence for gravitational radiation in binary pulsar
orbit changes, and NSF is building a 100-million-dollar gravity
wave detector.

That\'s not to say that there is a GR solution that does precisely
what I want - a travelling wave with negative curvature perpendicular
to the direction of travel - but it\'s at least vaguely plausible. 

>T4 is less hard sci-fi than any previous incarnation pf trav.

Speaking as an Actual Scientist who\'s worked on some aspects of T4
(like inventing the "grav pulse" concept, and the sensor rules) I
take exception to this.
It\'s not quite as hard-sci as TNE (cold fusion - yuck!) but it\'s
reasonably close. The new sensor rules I just posted, for example,
are about as hard-sci as anything you\'re ever likely to see - I spent
days on signal-to-noise calculations and simulations to generate them.

>* Characters

Hmmm...Not realy any Space navy at this time, most space careers would be   
more like the Scouts in the 3I.  I see distinct posibilty of the revival   
of the Prospector or Belter Career.  Mining(Luna, Mars, the Asteroids)   
would be big business in the mid 21st. All those lovely natural resources   
Terra needs.   There will always be Rogues and the Military.  And   
Academia(Scholars) as well.

>* Mechanics

Hopefully nothing would change the rules mechanics much :)

>* The Solar System

Luna had colonies place on it since the Early 21st, and it was considered   
it\'s own country by the UN in the later 21st (2084). So that world is a   
major player.  Wonder what Luna culture would be like, a mix of Terran   
cultures I would think.  Mars is a major colony and mining world.  It is   
from here that most belters head off to the "rocks" and stake claims.   I   
would think a lanthanum or some other valuable metal rush would encourage   
more belt miners.  Belter rush of 2089?

"On a rock, in a belt, excavating for a mine,
Lived a miner \'89er and his probe called  \'Celmentine\' "

Proxima Centari System has been discovered but not explored

>* Vehicles and Equipment

TL-9 with some Higher Techs(shakey) for various items, such as computers   
at TL-11?

>* Organizations (reasons for adventuring)

Belter Companies (\'Red Dwarf\' Mining Ships?), Scouts as well. And Rogues,   
Schollars, and Military Guys (oh my!)

Claim jumping pirate types could hassel the belters :)

A company could hire the PC\'s to stake a claim on a world in the Proxima   
System

It\'s these same companies(Sternmetal? GSBaG?) that pressure UNSCA into   
devloping more Jump ships and explorations to other systems for mining   
that leads to First Contact, and Interstellar Wars.  IIRC it was   
originaly a dispute over Mining rights on Barnard right?  The Terrans got   
impatient and fired the first shot IIRC.

>What else?

	Perhaps a section on the then current research on Jump drive
technology (as a separate category from the "grand story" you mentioned),
since that\'s what will begin to drastically alter the campaign situation.
Some historical background that expands on the pre-existing Traveller canon
regarding this time-period would also seem to be neccesary.
	Alternatively, this kind of product could be presented as a "Terran
supplement" which instead of presenting a very specific campaign presented
a locale (the Terran system) and its campaign possibilities during various
periods (21st century, a few years after contact with the Vilani, the
height of the Rule of Man, during or near the end of the Long Night.) While
it may be interesting to set a campaign so early in  the established
timeline, it would also be more "Traveller-like" to look at other later
periods when the solar system was also more isolated than in the stardard
campaign (i.e. M1100). Without any FTL travel to other stars, even on a
very small scale, the games scope becomes a very different one.
	This is OK, but it should be noted nonetheless.

Hear Hear!! Just transplant the careers section from TNE (it even has
second careers for rogues...prisoners! ;-)

I\'d even put up with the crappy typography...just stick the thing in the
book!


Bloo is right...the restricted number of character options tend to produce
more one dimensional characters. While an experienced gamer can take an
Agent and make a journalist or a cop or a PI or a bounty hunter or a spy
from that generation sequence, having those careers explicitly laid out,
encourages even experienced gamers to rethink what kind of character
they\'re creating.

Otherwise you _do_ tend to end up with three fighters, two clerics, a
magic user and a half-elf fighter-magic user as characters.

Well, you\'re not quite the ONLY one to have some probblems with the
Starships book...

Here\'s a shot at some answers:

Closed vs Open structure.

Closed structure is an unstreamlined hull with all the components enclosd
in some sort of hull. It may be a thin skin of metal, but it\'s enclosed,
and in theory, maintains a shirtsleeves environment for all components of
the ship.

Open structures are frames with things hung wherever they\'re convenient,
and no pretense of a hull. Some parts may not be accessible in a
shirtsleeve environment.

Neither tends to be any regular shape, and neither can enter an
atmosphere.

A box becomes a slab when IMO, it looks \'slabbish\'; when the length and
width are considerably greater than the height; it\'s really a gradation.

A cylinder is that, a cylinder, it may be oval in cross section, but
nowhere does the curve of the hull \'straighten out\'. A box may be curvy,
but there are portions of the hull that are perpendicular to each other.

There are LxWxH ratios in FFS2, and (without looking, because I dont have
it here) I think in QSDS.

Too bad, I\'m sorry you wasted money on Starships, because it is truly one
of the crappiest game supplements ever produced.

Hmmm, you\'re showing your geographic bias here, Roderick! ;-)

Here the warm clothes are a bit too much (I think it got down to 80F

I believe it has already been discussed that a) and c) are impossible.
It takes a mass the size of our sun to bend light a *minute* fraction
of a degree.  To create a "gravity lens" capable of allowing lasers to
strike targets at the ranges associated with Traveller ship combat
would require the creation of MONSTROUSLY huge gee-forces which would
certainly damage-- and most likely destroy-- the firing ship.  A
thousand 1 Gee sources or ten 100 Gee sources... it wouldn\'t make a
difference-- you\'d still have to deal with a pulse of 1,000 Gees
originating a few metres away from the firing vessel (something I
don\'t think inertial dampers would be able to handle).

During a previous discussion it was determined that the gee-forces
necessary in a travelling "pulse" would be far less than those
required using a high-gee gravity lens.

A point source gravity lens would need to possess an immense mass (or
pseudo-mass) to improve the focus of light at such great distances.
The travelling grav pulse idea allows for a much lower grav source to
be used.  The gravity lens would need to apply its brute-force gravity
all at once, while the travelling pulse could apply a lesser force
over a longer period of time.

If you did allow the latter, you would also be creating another
powerful weapon... gravity bombs.  If you can create a gravitational
field to keep a laser focused enough to do damage at distances of
300,000 km, a ship docked at a starport could do severe damage to the
surrounding structures by simply firing its laser skyward.  The
resulting gravity field would cause an extremely brief but powerful
"implosion".  If you hand wave this away using some sort of shielding,
you now have to explain how one shields everything except the laser
beam from these immense gee-forces (no matter how short their
duration).

This is a poor example.  I find more realism in ultra efficient HEPlaR
drives than nonsensical "Thruster Plates".  HEPlaR is at least
possible using today\'s theories and technology.  Which one requires
the MOST hand-waving? :)

They would still have uniform field effects.  The pulse is merely
moving instead of being stationary.  After all, every body in the
universe is moving :)

More likely, the superheated region of the hull will cause such rapid
expansion that the hull plates will resound like a big kettle drum
(not to mention burst a few seams).  Callisto anyone? :)

In all previous THUDDDs except for last month\'s Yacht competition, there
has been a voting category for "Most Efficient Design."  \'Efficiency\' is
of course measurable along many parameters; for THUDDD 6, it will be
largely performance/price (= bang/buck :)).  This does *not* necessarily
mean that the lowest bidder wins; rather, it simply indicates that the
buyer(s) are very price-sensitive.  By contrast, an Imperial Navy design
would tend toward maximizing performance/ton; they don\'t care (as much)
about ship cost, but rather about ship quality in absolute terms.

That\'s why I\'m opening up the range of tonnage to a full factor of two,
from 500 to 1000 tons.  As cost is very roughly proportional to tonnage in
this regime, designers are welcome to trade off the lesser individual
capability but greater redundancy and operational flexibility of two 500
ton ships vs. one 1000 ton ship, or any point in between.

Speaking of which, I will probably require entries to list how many units
can be bought for ten gigacredits, so people can compare entries more
easily.

> I still think 400 tons is the ideal size for an SDB. :)

Depends on what you mean by SDB.  In a revenue cutter and anti-piracy
role, I tend to agree.  But as defense against naval destroyer-sized
targets, you need to get into the 500+ range to even make them notice
you\'re shooting at them. :)

> Will you be giving us an example ship to emulate or scorn? Or is this ship
> catagory too open ended for something like this?

Nope, no example this time; I only did that for the Yacht THUDDD so
non-gearheads could participate without dealing with the design system(s).

Some concern has been expressed regarding comparisons between
FFS2-designed ships vs. those using any of the older systems, as FFS2
sensor suites are cheaper (in both cost and volume/area) for the same
performance.  Does anyone have suggestions on how to handle this?

* Characters
Characters are unlikely to own their own ships in this setting - the
stellar economy and trade opportunities will be so much smaller than in
the interstellar economy of the TI. It will be important for players to
belong to organizations to get out into space - Weyland Utani type
corporate employees etc will be the norm. Space travel will probably
still be relatively expensive.

        I agree heartily that interplanetary travel should be fairly
expensive, at least out past Mars.  For Luna to become a viable, thriving
nation, I think there would need to be economical travel from Earth-Luna,
though.  
        As far as characters having their own ships- you could make a case
for characters being belters, prospectors, traders, or military types, and
having ships on a corporate-subsidized basis, similar to the old subsidized
merchants from CT.  Getting ships as "gifts" a la the 100-ton Scout would be
unheard of, however.
        Some suggestions for character types: Explorers (scouts or
privately-funded independants), Belters, Freighters  (tramp merchants with
subsidized ships, or corporate crews like on the Nostromo), Law Enforcement
(corporate, UN, bounty hunters and private investigators), Colonizers
(people with the skills to establish colonies on inhospitable worlds- skills
could cover adaptive agriculture, exobiology, etc.), Military (see below),
Scientists.

* The Solar System
Some decent maps of Earth/Luna and a terraformed Mars, plus details of
orbital stations and facilities (is there an orbital elevator?) Also,
I agree that nearby stars should be included, but I\'d extend that out to
a subsector\'s worth of systems. With only a moderate number of systems
being detailed, it would be feasible to provide system maps of each.

        I think you could get by quite nicely with just the solar system
detailed, along with orbital environments.  You could set an initial
campaign in the period leading up to the development of jump-1, and then
later expand to cover the near stars.  Can you imagine the cultural impact
of finally developing FTL?  Or the cutthroat tactics the corps would employ
to get a monopoly on such technology?  There\'s a whole campaign\'s worth of
adventures right there!

* Organizations (reasons for adventuring)
Will the UN or whoever have a navy? If they haven\'t fought any wars in
space yet this seems unlikely; or at least the Navy will be small and
inexperienced. There will probably be a science and mapping organization
- - - but not a scout service as we know it. There will probably be some
equivalent of Larry Niven\'s ARM (the united nation\'s police force);
corporations/commercial concerns are important too.

        I think that it would be better for the game if a fair bit of the
solar system was still unexplored.  The more distant planets and their
moons, the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, etc.  This would leave lots of room
for adventuring, and justify the existence for a scout-type service, or
privately-funded expeditions to search for all manner of practical or
oddball things.  I can also see reasons for having a highly-trained Search
and Rescue force, similar to the Coast Guard, which would be a multinational
group funded by the UN.  There would also need to be law enforcement types.
What about penal institutions in space?  Convict mines in the Ceres Belt,
for example.  It would certainly cut down on escape attempts.
        As far as a Naval service goes... Well, who is to say that all of
Earth\'s nations will be getting merrily along in the 21st century?  Each
nation might choose to maintain their own military presence in space, in
order to protect their interests systemwide, and there might be threats to
the interplanetary community which require militay force, but stem from
internal pressures.  How did Luna become a nation, for instance?  Anybody
read Heinlein\'s "The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress?"  Perhaps there was a revolt
of sorts, and in its wake the UN decided to mandate some sort of federated
military force to be mobilized in the event of an emergency.  You could also
have situations of piracy and terrorism, as ideological or religious feuds
boil over into space.  Imagine a final flareup in the Middle East, wherein
the nation of Israel is overrun by an alliance of Islamic nations, and the
Hebrew people are forced into a mass migration- up into orbit.  It is
unlikely that the struggle would stop there.

* The grand story that is being resolved... moving toward a discovery of
jump drive and the Vilani.
Give the background in the form of a history that the referee can jump into
at any point of choice. I\'d begin about 20 years before the discovery of
jump space to allow adventure in the Sol system alone, and take it up to
the beginning of the war against the Vilani (when was this???)

        I think that\'s a great idea.  If it were me, I would advocate
starting in the couple of years prior to the discovery of jump drives, and
work the players into the dramatic unfolding of events.

* Sample scenario???? Very important.

        Some suggestions:
        1.) "The Wreck of the Endeavour"- The characters are present on the
shakedown cruise of a new class of corporate spaceship.  It employs a number
of cutting-edge technological advances that promise to make it the leading
edge of a revolution in ship design.  Unfortunately, a group of competitor
corporations have plans to turn triumph into tragedy.  You could play this
as a "survive the spacewreck" adventure, or a complicated hijacking under
the cover of an accident, and the players are in a position to stop (or
cause) it.
        2.) "Deadly Seed"- The characters are the crew of a subsidized
freighter on the Ceres Run, carrying ores and minerals to Earth.  Strapped
for cash, they accept a lucrative side job carrying crates for a small
business- only to become embroiled in a well-funded terrorist plot to
smuggle fissionable materials onto Earth.
        3.) "Ship to Shore"- The characters, members of an SAR or
exploratory service, receive a weak distress signal from the Rim (the area
at Neptune\'s orbit and beyond).  They find a small outpost not listed on any
charts- an extreme oddity- and a scene of brutal piracy.  Everyone on board
is dead, and the computers destroyed, but there is enough evidence to
suggest that the place was used as a listening post of some kind, and th
eplayers manage to recover fragments of stored radio signals unlike anything
they have heard before.  But who were they listening to?  The mystery
deepens when the government immediately orders their ship to port after
making their report.  From here, the players are hounded and menaced at
every turn, caught up in a ruthless, shadowy struggle between the government
and a number of interplanetary coporations.  The prize is the final proof
that humanity is not alone- the station was established in secret to
catalogue the faint emanations of radio signals coming from Barnard\'s Star.
There is Someone Out There- the Vilani.  You could really have fun playing
this as a dark, gritty, X-files adventure.

This setting is a great opportunity to create a game that is traveller -
yet has a significantly
different more gritty, 2300AD type feel to it.

        I agree.  I love this idea, and I would have a blast helping out
with it.

Dear TML\'ers,
 
We ALL want to see DGP\'s Traveller archives made available to the
public once again.
 
Please keep in mind that DGP (or any other publisher) cannot
publicly distribute materials, under the Traveller trademark or
which portray the Traveller milieu, in any form or by any means
without first obtaining an official Traveller License to do so.
Note that creating a work and then "donating the copyrights" to
the public domain could be construed as a method of publishing,
and may still be subject to obtaining a license.
 
Besides, there are proper channels for publishing "official"
Traveller materials, and DGP is currently waiting in line for a
Traveller license. For DGP to step outside those channels would
be a display of disregard and disrespect to the managers of
Traveller, and to Marc Miller himself.
 
As far as we at DGP are concerned, with respect to the Traveller
universe, Marc Miller is GOD. We couldn\'t conceive of operating
outside the official pathways he and his associates have planned
for the creation or distribution of Traveller products.
 
 
 
BTW, we at DGP appreciate your anxiousness to see DGP\'s upcoming
(non-Traveller) release. Everyone seems to be eagerly waiting.
Thank you.
 
Though at times the creation of a brand new universe can be
overwhelming if not frustrating, we\'re having fun designing it,
and our "kibitzers" are having fun discussing and proofreading
it. That\'s what keeps us going. After all, FUN is what gaming is
all about.
 
We will continue to joyfully tinker away. We are creating what we
believe to be an innovative and entertaining milieu. DGP veterans
and newbies alike are involved with bringing this product to
fruition. I think you are going to like it. The excitement level
here at DGP is HIGH.
 
It\'s our biggest project to date, slated to be 320-pages in size,
over 3-times larger than anything DGP has ever produced before.
 
Wish us luck, for we definitely have our work cut out for us.

Roderick, that\'s what a lot of my ancestors thought about our united States
too.  Their States attempted to peaceably secede and were forced to remain
part of the United states.  Nothing in our Constitution expressly forbid
secession..then..and opinion was pretty evenly divided on the subject, but
that didn\'t stop the bullets from flying.  Don\'t get me wrong, I think
union worked out better than disunion would have, but a lot of good people
died while our basic governmental structure was being changed from a
decentralized union of independent States to a strongly centralized Union
of states.

So, when push comes to shove, law rides on the point of a bayonet, "them
what has the guns makes the rules", and history is written by the winning
side..and those are *not* uniquely American ideas.  ;->

!!Hypothetical Strawman Warning!!

Speaking TOTALLY hypothetically, how would Ottawa react if Quebec succeeded
based solely on a 50.1% vote?  If it seized military assets and closes its
borders?  If it revoked treaties with your First Nations and seized their
territory.  If it nationalized formerly Canadian and international private
assets?  If it suppressed Anglophiles, striped them of rights, refused to
allow them to take their wealth out of Quebec?

Now, I KNOW no Quebec government would do any of the above, but speaking
hypothetically would your Federal government just let it happen?  Or would
it *act*, saying it was in the best interests of Canada as a whole?  You
might be surprised by how *you* react..how your government reacts.

Ob Traveller, I wish you foreigners <g> would quit referring to Yanks in
Space..I ain\'t no "damn yankee!" ;-p

BTW, this is the setting for Traveller that I\'ve been waiting for, an
Interstellar Wars Era.  Definitely looks good.

> * Setting

The setting should explore the grandeur of a solar system.  All too
often, in Traveller we go to a system, set down on the main world, and
then leave for the next main world.  This should explore the business of
intra-system activities, such as trade, politics, communications,
colonies, etc.

Detailed maps of Terra, Luna, Mars, the Asteroid Belt would be useful,
with deck plans on some standard ship designs, and of the first jump
ship, etc.

The setting should explore the political landscape of 21st century
Earth, trying to stay as realistic as possible (it\'s not _that_ far into
the future).  A detailed timeline (ala T:2300-style) would be very
useful, and also add a ton of canon material into this vital historical
period.

> * Characters

Characters would come from either Mars, Luna or Earth, and specific
classes could be national military types, police, scholars & scientists,
rouges, merchants (employees of trading firms), belters & prospectors. 
When it comes into existence, the UNSCA will more than likely be a
scouting and scientific organization, but it gives more careers, such as
UNSCA scout, and UNSCA scientist, etc.

Also, there could be diplomats, etc.  Players whose character is from
Earth should choose a nation or at least geographic region that they\'re
from (ie. Europe, NA, SA, Africa, Asia).

A major point to characters is what currency is being used.  Will there
still be different moneys around the world (ie. Dollars, \'Euros\'?, etc.)
or will a UN-mandated coin have taken their place (unlikely, I think).

> * Mechanics

A more fully developed game mechanic for interplanetary travel could be
useful, but aside from that Is ee no changes being made to the game
rules.  

As to the mechanics of the time, in technology, it should be TL9, with
some TL10, and perhaps TL11 at various points (the higher ends, being
expensive and unreliable). 

> * The Solar System

A UPP rating for each world and major moons is needed (perhaps
downgraded from the information in S&A), along with explanations of how
far human or machine exploration has gone.

> * Vehicles and Equipment

Individuals will more than likely not own spaceships, as they will be
controlled by governments and large corporations.  A major space station
employing some kind of pseudo-gravitiy could be used as an adventure
jump off point, in orbit around Earth.  Also, information on the kind of
vehicles in use, along with laws about what weaponry can or cannot be
used at this time, etc.

Space weaponry will have been developed, although it may not be
necessary.  Explanation of different weaponry used in space should be
included.

> * Organizations (reasons for adventuring)

Major corporations, the UNSCA, organized crime, scientific foundations
(SETI?), and national governments all could be prospective patrons.  

> * The grand story that is being resolved... moving toward a discovery
> of jump drive and the Vilani.

I think that the possibility for adventure in Earth\'s solar system
should be given for before jump drive as well. Perhaps the source book
will cover 2050-2100 or so, which would nicely take on exploration of
the solar system, jump drive and the beginning of the Interstellar Wars
(why did they actually start?).

> What else?

A starter scenario has already been suggested, that\'s a great idea.  A
pullout poster map of Sol, and it\'s surrounding stars (indicating
Vilani-inhabited or not and including ALL stars, not just habitable
planets).

Useful artwork is always a benefit, as are well done charts etc.  Also,
one more thing would be a referee\'s section on any leftover Ancient
artefacts in the Sol system for characters to explore in adventure.  A
section detailing Bernard\'s Star and Proxmia Centauri is probably also a
good idea.  

Also, on a note unrelated to this, a name for the upcoming M200 campaign
came to me last night as I flipped through the Imperial Encylopedia. 
Perhaps something along the lines of "Milieu 200: Antebellum" would
work.  I thought it sounded kind of cool.

Thanks,

Whether or not any offical rules do it, I\'m going to put specific tech
level ranges on gravity pulses.  My handwave is that the pulse is composed
of a matched pair of tuned gravity waves and can be kept in a tight focus
for only X(tl) seconds after which the pulse pair cancels itself out and
the laser defocuses.

My comments are not intended to flame, merely to point out that certain
"American Values" are not widely held by the rest of the continent. I
respect the point of view of others, but I don\'t always agree...

Also note, that my point of view comes from who I am, and where I come
from. If I were constantly faced with violence, I *might* have different
opinions. Or, I might not, and have my life violently ended in
martyrdom. Thank God I haven\'t yet had much cause to worry about it
(yet)...

Weeeelll... It depends how one defines "stability". Sure, countries like
US and Japan have a relatively stable *political* structure, but Glenn
here is talking about *social* structure. I would argue that the social
stability of US & Japan fall somewhere near the bottom, and the cause
can be attributed to rapidly changing technology. ie. upheavals in the
workforce and family.

Tech changes aren\'t always bad, imho rapid tech advancement at all
costs, without regard to consequences, rapid development without study
of impact (environmental and social) is almost *always* a bad thing.

\'Course, speed of development and *how much* study and forethought is
required is a highly subjective judgement. It\'s my opinion that in most
cases, not enough forethought is used...

And this is where *my* beliefs diverge from those of Hollywood. (and
those of the American people, as you imply) Violence begets violence, it
does not solve it.

(Please note the generalization. I will not deny that the surgical use
of violence cannot be used as a means to an end. It is my *personal*
choice that I will *never* exercise it as *my* option, but I do not deny
it as an option to those legally enabled to use it, and use it legally;
or to those in dire distress, who use it only defensively to save an
innocent life or their own.)

It is my perception that more "messes" are made when households stock
their own firearms. Not having a whackload of statistics to back my
claim, I would just like to caution that there are certain risks that
one takes when one keeps a firearm. Is it *really* safer?

Actually, I take the opposite view. If America dies, it will because a
minority becomes overcome by a conspirational fervor, and believes that
government is "out to get them" "oppress the people" and take away their
"God given rights and freedoms". The countryside becomes fractured by
guerrilla fighting, cities become staging grounds for terrorist attacks.
I sincerely hope I\'m wrong.

America will die when it forgets their Government is "of the people, for
the people, and by the people."

And that\'s a bad thing? ;-) I feel uncomfortable with the use of "When"
instead of "If". Nothing is inevitable.

What would be gained, if the *people* of Quebec (not current government)
desired to "secede" and TROC (the rest of Canada) decided to call up
arms and not let them?

Scenario #1: Quebec declares independance. Canada balks. War declared.
Economic and political instability ensues. People Die. USA intervenes.
(Don\'t tell me you wouldn\'t, your largest trading partner fractures and
starts fighting on your border...) Quebec\'s nationalism increases and
becomes more militant. France gets involved. Things get *really* messy.
Devolution into a Northern Ireland-like situation, or a more global
conflict ensues...

Scenario #2: Quebec declares independance. Much political and legal
wrangling over what Quebec can and cannot do. How much of the national
debt do they assume? How much territory? (northern QC does *not* want to
separate, being mostly populated by First Nations peoples) Economic
instability. Both parties agree to take their grievances to Hague for
consideration... Separation terms are established, and Quebec becomes an
independant entity in a Canadian EC-esque economic federation. BC sees
the plum deal and wants out too... 

I find Scenario #1 highly unlikely and more distasteful than Scenario
#2. (Also unlikely, BTW) Most likely what will happen is that powers
will continue to be devolved to the provinces until a more loose
confederation (ala Swiss) is reached, sporadic cycles of Quebec
nationalism will wax and wane as they have ever since the British
defeated the French on the Plains of Abraham...

Governments in the 21st century become more and more emasculated as
Corporate entities displace their sovereignty in key areas. Democracy
stagnates and is replaced by a feudal technocratic system, where a tiny
oligarchy rules the majority of the world\'s citizens... whooops... I
digress...

Sorry for the increasingly off-topic rant. Won\'t happen again.

Strong disagreement.  I do like the minus on the enlistment roll, as it is
often hard to get into a career after you have some rank elsewhere, but
once in, you actually have somewhat of an advantage in experience, which
offsets your disadvantage in domain knowledge.  Further, people are going
to do something after leaving a career - they do not just die off, and the
world should model the fact that after five years, someone might become a
scholar, and then return to their old career, or start a new one.  From
where I sit, this is pretty darn common - most people will change careers
twice in a thirty year period.

I hope that the Imperium allows easy service jumping or cross training, as
the various military branches have to work together.

I have known people who lost none.  Remember that officer rank comes at a
rate of one per term, so losing a rank is fairly traumatic.  Losing an
enlisted rank, which can show up at one a year, is less traumatic.

Certainly - in a military system that has so many responsibilities as the
3I, I can see a planetary army wanting an admiral to plan their resistance
to invasion.

I would think not, as long as every service has either enlistment
requirements, or age requirements.  For example, I can see the Navy not
accepting anyone as an O1 if they are over 26.  They might, though accept
them as an O3.  This would be reflected in the harder enlistment roll.

This seems too severe, imho, given that the system does not allow cross
training or seconding.  I would prefer a system where people can move, but
it takes a lot of effort to move without losing seniority.  For example,
force them to make a promotion roll once per rank they used to possess.  If
they make it, they keep their old rank, if they fail, they lose one, and
have to roll again.  As a kindness, I would allow them to roll in advance,
because damn few are going to be caught out by this.

Alternatively, put a "special option" on the skill table, which allows a
service or branch jump.

While I agree that Roger has been singularly ineffective in
returning these products to the marketplace, and support the idea
that he should surrender the rights (possibly via sale) to an
individual or organization that can and will return them to the
marketplace, I cannot sign the petition as written.

Roger strikes me as a "creative type" of person: one who has many
ideas, and whose mind is never truly at rest.  This can be a
blessing for an individual who has trained themselves to focus on
a project and see it through; it can be a curse to one who has
not.  I get the impression that Roger is in the latter class, as
am I - but that Roger lacks even the rudimentary self-training
that I have achieved at a great cost in lost time, disappointed
expectations, and personal reputation.  Roger may honestly
believe that he has the ability to deliver on his promises;
certainly, I am not willing to cry insult over his failure to
deliver - disappointment, certainly.

Nor do I believe that "chastisement" is appropriate; this again
may be part of his "curse": that he is a poor businessman (as I
am), but again, has failed to realize it (which I _did_, and for
that reason alone I am not a consultant).  I would urge him to go
into partnership with someone who has abilities to complement
his; and can channel Roger\'s energy and keep him focussed until a
project has reached fruition. =20

Do not overlook the fact that Roger is as much a victim of this
situation as we are, even though the fingers (rightly) point to
him: Roger has made an investment of his own in those rights; he
cannot recoup that investment until/unless he either sells them
or brings the products back to market.  It is entirely possible
that he is as frustrated as we are.

Also, for good and proper reasons, neither he nor Imperium Games
can discuss the negotiations between them without the
acquiescence of the other - so unless the both agree on making a
public statement, we don\'t know whether there are any legal
issues standing in the way.  And if there are, the obstacles
could have been placed by either party - or by their respective
lawyers, regardless of how the principals feel!

Jo, I fully support your goal of getting the DGP material back in
print - and I would very much like to see even the unfinished
notes from some of the other products, like The Black Duke or the
third and fourth volumes of The MegaTraveller Alien.  But to take
what I can only call a punitive and truculent tone with respect
to Roger is not something that I can in good conscience acquiesce
to.

Nope. Marathon 2 is out for Win95, too.

Marathon Infinity (includes map and physics model creation tools) is
only available for Mac though, and I don\'t think the PC version of M2
sold well enough to warrant a port. Pity.

The game engine isn\'t much different, though. All it would take would be
to convert the sounds, textures and maps.

I\'ve had this tool to convert Mac maps to PC format on my drive for a
while now. I\'d have to change the Infinity textures to M2 textures, but
I could conceiveably [ie. theoretically] make a PC version of my Sub
Merchant map.

Tell ya what, if five PC users mail <jumpspace@geocities.com> to request
a PC-compatible SubMerchant, I\'ll do it this weekend, and post it.

Jackson was in his 80s, at the time, IIRC, and it was an assassin: the guy
walked up, whipped out a pistol and it misfired (percussion cap went off, but
the powder wasn\'t ignited). Jackson wacks the guy with his cane, and the
assassin whips out a second pistol, which _also_ misfires, and Jackson has to
be restrained from killing the poor schmuck.

Just happened to have my copy of AM 6 (Solommani) next to me when I read
this so I thought I\'d chime up.
First paragraph in the "Terran Confederation" Section, " Although each
of Terra\'s nations maintained its own space operations, the need was
seen for cooperation between those space forces in such simple matters
as traffic control, orbit assignment, and radio frequency allocation.
The agency established to meet this need was the United Nations Space
Coordination Agency - UNSCA."

The first mission to Bernard\'s Star was undertaken by the US Space Force
(indicating that the US was still a major player at this time), " It
took several years before a US Space Force team based on Luna tried a
mission which, in several trips, established an intermediate stopover
and refueling point about one parsec out."

Next paragraph states," Joint UNSCA expeditions were quickly launched -
to meet and deal with the Vilani on Barnard and later on the
Vilani-settled worlds of Nusku and Gashidda, and to explore the as yet
unsettled worlds of Alpha Centauri. A quick effort was also made to
settle Barnard even as Vilani prospectors were working on that world"
Later in the same section, following the uproar of finding that "most of
the worlds beyond a few parsecs distance were already claimed (by
Vilani)." ..."Individual nations began EXPANDING (emphasis mine) their
armed forces and building starships. Outposts on Barnard and Alpha
Centauri were reinforced and strengthened . In 2118 a minor incident by
a Vilani merchant caravan (it ignored traffic control signals from the
Terran base on Barnard) sparked the First Interstellar War."

I take this to mean that each nation had, at least, law enforcement
agencies involved in it\'s own extra terrestrial colonies. These served
as the core for military expansion following First Contact. These
national space agencies are organizations that would provide Characters
a means into space, and serve as adventure bases (as stated in previous
post, claim jumpers, criminal flight from Earth to Luna, Mars, Search
and Rescue operations, etc.)

On an another note, I like the idea of this as a source book/expanson
set to the T4 rules.

BOTH of you are right :-P

pg. 135 chart:  2D-7+Size
pg. 130 text:    2D-7+Atmosphere

Can we get a ruling?  I\'m no physicist but Size seems the better
indicator to me, since it corresponds to the amount of material that
gathered to form a planet, and thus corresponds to the amount of
hydrogen and oxygen that would be present.

Well, yes and no.  The T4 text says nothing about adventuring being the
second career.  It also says in paragragh 3, column 1, page 22:  "During
character generation, when a Traveller character leaves a career for any
reason, he may choose to pursue a different one, going through the
enlistment process all over again.  There is a penalty for doing this,
however.  The enlistment roll for a second career is subject to a DM of
- -2, for a third career it is a DM of -3, and so on.  All other DMs,
qualifications, and preferences apply."

There is no hint of a desire to limit the number of careers.  Indeed, "
. . . and so on . . ." implies as many careers as you can make the
enlistment roll for.  If it was your intention to limit careers, Marc,
its not evident in this language.  It may be in other language.

Granted, I did misread the increase of DMs by 1 per subsequent career.
But I like the current T4 language and would even increase the modifier
to increments of 2.

I guess I\'m most curious as to why you feel that way, Marc.  I don\'t
think that at all.  If it weren\'t possible to roll up octogenerian
players, I might agree, stopping character development before the onset
of middle age.  And how do you deal with the problem of a failed
continuance roll?  Take a hypothetical.  I want to make a character (or
NPC for that matter) who was born the same year as Cleon I for a
campaign starting in Year 0.  Should I have to abort or \'freeze\' the
character if he fails a continuation roll after one term?  (Now that I
think about it, some \'frozen\' characters born during or pre-Cleon might
be interesting  ;-)  And if he fails multiple continuation rolls or is
injured?

I\'m really not trying to attack your position at all.  I just want to
understand it.

Folding arrays: folding sensor arrays should be the same volume, mass, and power
as the equivalent non-folding array, but cost twice as much and require only 10%
as much surface area with no minimum diameter requirements. While a folding array
is extended a ship may not maneuver.

Power for passive sensors should be in MW, not kW

Conversions: the conversion table is in error in several respects - use the
table in Part 3 of the Definitve Sensor rules instead.

There are several other changes I am considering for game balance reasons:
adjusting the maximum fire range of LIDARS to match passive sensors of the
same sensitivity (to make play easier), reducing the cost of sensor arrays
somewhat, and reducing the power required for a PEMS jammer.

come up with a bunch of QSDS-style sensor packages using the new sensor
rules. Currently only TL-10 is supported.
I\'m interested in working with any shipbuilders who have special needs,
questions about the sensor rules or questions about sensors in FFS2.


These use the normal QSDS notation, but sensor sensitivities are on the new
scale, and a few new letters had to be added:

Letter	Meaning
A	AEMS active sensor
P	PEMS passive sensor 
L	LIDAR tracker
JA	AEMS deceptive jammer
JP	PEMS jammer
S	scanner-only sensor (may not be used for fire control)
T	tracker-only sensor (may not be used for detecting targets, only for
	  tracking already-detected or fire control solutions)
F	folding array (ship may not maneuver while array is unfolded; reduce 
	sensitivity 0.5 when array folded)
sc	Science-optimized sensor

Note that some packages include multiple passive, active or LIDAR sensors.

For example, a A11.5 P14FS P13.5T L14.5 JA12 JP13.
has an 11.5 active sensor, a 14 passive folding array scanner (not useful
for fire control), a 13.5 passive tracker (only used for fire
control), a 14.5 LIDAR tracker, a 12 active jammer, and a 13 passive jammer.


Please excuse the sales rhetoric following the sensor descriptions; I\'ve been
shopping for cars, which has infected my brain. There is some valuable commentary
buried in the rhetoric, though. The single most important lesson for ship
designers is "don\'t neglect LIDAR" - a cheap LIDAR will often be able to 
get a fire control lock when a medium-sized passive array can\'t.

Over the past year BamTech has been working quietly behind the scenes as a major
consultant to the Imperium on sensor and electronics countermeasures issues.
Now, BamTech is prepared to come out from the shadows of the "black world" and
apply its unmatched expertise in sensor analysis and design to the construction
of a whole suite of sensor products - ranging from the solid and reliable to
state-of-the-art equipment for the Imperial Navy.

Our first production facilities are located on Linth (Core 0502 B664884-A),
and until certain complex legal issues are sorted out, we are emphasizing
TL-10 sensors. These sensors can be maintained by less advanced worlds on the
fringes of the Imperium, and BamTech is even prepared to licence manufacturing to
local corporations. The initial annoucement was timed to coincide with this
month\'s THUDD competition for a TL-10 System Defence Boat. We at BamTech are
confident that our sophisticated sensors will provide several exciting design
options to THUDD participants.

In addition to sensors, BamTech is searching for industry partners for a planned
line of stealthy starship hulls. True stealth can\'t be added as an afterthought - 
it must be designed into a hull from the ground up.

The initial line includes no less than 8 sensor packages - more than any of our
competitors have ever offered! With such a wide range, ship designers can be sure
of finding the perfect package even for the most exotic requirement.

For civilian customers, we offer the BamTech Basic package, certified to meet
navigational requirements on all Imperial and neighbouring worlds. This package
is recommended only for the most confident of shipholders, as it provides effectively
no fire control capability.

The BamTech Standard adds a enhanced passive sensor, the BamTech P1300, capable of
detecting small civilian spacecraft at ranges in excess of 5,000,000 km. The
P1300 also provides a significant passive fire control capability. More importantly,
it adds a cost-effecitve LIDAR tracker, the L1400, capable of engaging twenty
targets simultaneously to ranges of nearly 1,000,000 km. Pirates will know they\'re
in for a fight when the L1400 lights up their hull!

The Small and Medium Military packages add enhanced active, passive, and LIDAR
sensors, together with sophisicated electronic countermeasures. The Medium,
with its dual scanners and LIDARS, allow a destroyer-sized starship to 
excercise absolute command over its assigned patrol area.

For the more peaceful customer, the BamTech "Tycho" Science package features
the most sophisticated sensor array available, the S1400 folding science array.
From the surface of Sylea, this array can easily resolve a man-sized target on
the moon! In addition, it includes the full functionality of a P1400 spacecraft
tracking array - including an unmatched passive fire control capability for those
tricky tenure struggles.

Finally, BamTech offers three sensor systems for specialized military needs. The
powerful Picket suite combines a large folding array - the largest BamTech
currently offers - with a powerful ECM suite, ideal for allowing small warships
to listen in on enemy ship movements and escape undetected. The Lurker suite
uses dual passive sensor arrays - one full-function, one scanner - while 
reducing costs by including only navigational radar sensors; ideal for those
who prefer not to announce their presence to the whole world. Alternatively,
the SearchLight suite is for combat vessels unafraid to be seen. It includes an
A1200 imaging active electromagnetic sensor, the same as the Medium Military
suite, but for a fraction of the total cost. Hostile vessels trying to hide
with their power plants shut down will be in for the (last) surprise of their
lives!

If these suites don\'t match your needs, BamTech is prepared to work with
major shipbuilders to assemble custom packages for any function - from
sensor drones to system control ships.

BamTech is prepares to ship all these sensor suites in limited (prototype)
quantities for the THUDD competition, and to ramp up production to meet the
needs of the winning team - and we\'re confident that the winning team will be
the one that choses BamTech!

	Ok... these are all highly unlikely scenarios.  While the PQ may be
capable of province-wide electoral fraud and incredible mendacity, they
aren\'t violent.  There was a short-lived and generally pretty half-assed
terrorist movement called the FLQ in the late \'60\'s, who managed to kill
more francophone workers than anglophone oppressors, but they and the
subsequent government reaction in the form of the October Crisis
(basically, martial law was declared, they arrested them all, and that was
that) have pretty well stacked the deck against political violence around
here.  An anglo lobby group office was torched some years back, there\'s the
odd bit of anglophobic graffiti and vandalism directed at individuals
flying Canadian flags on their property, but other than that things are
pretty peaceful.  Nobody wants to see tanks in the streets again.

	Secondly, diehard separatists are in the minority; approximately
35-38% of the province\'s population are what could be called "purs et
durs"; these are mostly concentrated in the rural regions of the province;
western Quebec, Montreal, and parts of the South Shore are mostly
federalist.  The problem is the so-called "soft nationalists" who are
lukewarmish Quebec nationalists but who are also kind of attached to Canada
and who form a large swing vote.  Thus, in order to win, the PQ would have
to convince these guys to vote yes.  In the last referendum, they promised
the electorate that they\'d get to keep their Canadian citzenship and
passport, they\'d continue using the Canadian dollar, and that the rest of
Canada would for some reason accept a new "partnership" where Quebec, with
25% of the population, would have equal power and representation with
"English Canada" in a new political framework whose details were howlingly
ludicrous.  According to exit polls, 20-30% of the 49% of Quebecers that
voted Yes in the last referendum actually thought that they\'d still be
sending MP\'s to Ottawa, keeping their passports, and using the Canadian
dollar...

	If the PQ can\'t convince the soft nationalists that they can have
the best of both worlds, that all will be sunshine and light, and that
Canada is an evil British plot to eradicate all French and that
anglomontrealers are its shock troops, they can\'t win.  There aren\'t enough
stupid and racist Quebecers out there for them to pull it off in an honest
way.  If it becomes quite clear that the rest of Canada will play hardball,
that Quebec will lose all input on Canadian monetary policy, that Quebecers
won\'t be able to renew their Canadian passports, and that Quebec will be
partitioned with Canada keeping the federalist regions, the soft
nationalists will vote "no" and the PQ will lose.


 However, since you asked:


1) Seizing military assets:  Highly unlikely.  The provinces do not have
armed forces.  The closest thing to a military Quebec has is the Surete du
Quebec.  They have eight armoured cars and some SWAT teams.  And they
aren\'t exactly the best police force in the world.  A few years back a
bunch of Mohawks successfully defended a reserve against the SQ, who among
other things attacked upwind into their own tear gas barrage and managed to
fatally shoot one of their own in the process.  The thought of the SQ
taking on even a reserve milita unit is hilarious.  Basically, I doubt that
the PQ are dumb enough to try this; they couldn\'t pull it off.

2) Closing borders: likewise highly unlikely; they could have the SQ put up
roadblocks, but the SQ would not capable of holding them.  Recall that
these guys got routed by a few Mohawks with AK-47s.  They could try and
barricade the highways, but they\'d fold as soon as the army showed up.  And
airports are a federal responsibility, so they\'d have to seize all of
those, too.  They simply aren\'t militarily capable of it, even assuming
they were inastute enough to try it.

3) Pushing Natives around: They could try...  the last time they tried to
push Natives around, the SQ\'s ass got kicked.  Basically, Indian relations
are a federal field of competence, so legally they couldn\'t.  And even if
they decided to play rough with the natives, well, the international
political fallout would be horrendous.  Besides, Quebec is a major exporter
of electricity, from James Bay and Churchill Falls.  These power lines run
through native lands.  A few strategically placed charges of dynamite and
the province is blacked out and losing gazillions of export dollars.

4) Seizing stuff: political suicide for a number of reasons.  First off,
Quebec\'s economy is highly export-oriented.  If the PQ pissed off their
major trading partners, the economy would tank.  Secondly, they can\'t win
without convincing the voters it\'ll all be a happy little walk in the park;
once things get rough and the soft nationalists realize that separating
isn\'t just going to be like waving a magic wand (like our premier claimed
it would be) support for separation will drop like a brick.

5) Anglo oppression: well, basically, I suppose they could try it.
However, their bond ratings would tank and they\'d never be able to borrow
money internationally again.  The political and economic fallout would be
horrendous.  Even with the relatively low level of discriminatory measures
directed at anglos (banning of the language from public view, barring
access to english schooling to non native Quebec anglophones, limiting
access to English health care via bureaucratic means, compulsory
francization of businesses over a certain size, trying to unilinguize the
civil service, censoring english-language web-sites) the province is
suffering economically.  Capital is trickling away, and the province is
recieving far less than its per capita share of foreign investment in
Canada.  While the rest of Canada is doing OK economically, Quebec is kinda
limping with growth rates well under 3%.  Over 1/2 of Montreal\'s population
lives on some form of government financial assistance.  Recruiting
qualified professionals into Quebec is difficult; people are concerned
about being able to educate their kids in english.  If the PQ turned up the
heat, things would just get worse.

	 I suspect that the feds would act in this case.  You see, while I
could condone a legal separation done democratically and constitutionally,
the current PQ position is that they are above the law, basic principles of
democracy, and the Constitution.  That I cannot condone.  If they act
illegally, I would hope that the feds would bring them to heel by whatever
justifiable means are neccessary.  And if this means putting tanks in the
street, arresting the ringleaders,and restoring the rule of law, then so be
it.  Its a basic principle of international law that states may use force
to deal with internal threats to their stability.  I just really, really
hope that things will not come to this.  However, "peace at any price" is
not something that I believe in.  I think that the _ideals Canada stands
for _ (democracy, human rights, pluralism, and the rule of law) are worth
defending; an illegal, unconstitutional, and unilateral attempt to subvert
them might IMHO depending on the circumstances justify reasonable armed
intervention.  However, _I_ _WOULD_ _NOT_ _BE_ _HAPPY_ _TO_ _SEE_ _THIS_
_HAPPEN_!!!  It would really, really, really suck.

	It is possible that military action would follow an illegal
separation attempt (and I think that regardless of how it\'s done, there\'d
be some civil violence).  It\'s just a possibility that nobody likes to
think about...  although there was one poll a while back that indicated
that 75% of Canadians outside Quebec condoned the used of military force in
the event of an illegal separation attempt.  It might be extremely easy to
score political points by taking an extreme hard line with the PQ in such a
case.


	And how would I react?  If Quebec separates legally, I don\'t know;
I kind of like it here, y\'see :).  It would depend on how bad things got.
If Quebec separates illegally, I\'d leave.  I have no wish to live in a
two-bit  banana republic where the weather is too cold for bananas.

I mentioned the idea of an object-oriented standard for ship\'s plans
when the CD idea was being knocked about.  I was thinking DXF, since it
seems the most universal from what (little) I know.  I\'ve got a few
deckplans in DXF format on my web page if you want to look at them at:

	http://www.umr.edu/~mkm/trav/travpage.htm

I\'d be quite willing to post any that anyone else has also.

Does anyone know of a freeware or shareware program that works directly
with DXF\'s and runs under win32?  The package I\'ve been working with has
a proprietary native format and converts to/from DXF.

Thanks,

The table says that a mass 4 object at speed 6 does 28d6 damage.
But in the text under TK it says cost 1kg for a cost of 1 point, and times
ten for each additional point, and speed is 1kph for one point and each
additional point times ten speed.

Does that mean a 1000kg projectile travelling at 100,000kph only does 28d6
damage. I think that is underestimating the damage.

Also a 1 kg lead ball will be 55.8mm in diameter a 1000kg lead ball will be
558mm in diameter. Hell I roll that 1000kg puppy over you at a walk and do
severe damage to you. Stopping it would be a real bitch.

Or could the table mean a 4kg projectile travelling at 6kph does 28d6?

Either way you interpret it is way off.

One would hope that Ottawa would react sensibly, and try to reach a
solution. Most of what you assume, of course, presupposes that French
Canadians are barbarians with absolutely no respect for the rule of law.
That this process has been going on so long without any major mishaps is a
testament to the exact opposite. In the 70s, some people thought that soem
of their goals were being pushed out of reach and went to far. But, in
effect, they were reacting to a situation which was already drastically
altered by the Quiet Revolution. That name itself speaks volumes about what
kind of a situation we have here in Quebec. As for Anglophiles, you might
find quite a few in suburban Toronto. Quebecers whose first language is
English are Anglophones.

I like Canadians, they seem to make so much more sense. I can see it was
obviously a U.S. team that started the First Interstellear War, (shoot
first, ask questions later) Rather than a Canadian Team (legislate first,
ask questions later). ;)

Yes but under Preferential Enlistment: if two qualifying characteristics at
least two points above the number necessary for the enlistment difficulty
modifier may *Automatically* enlist in the career, without making any roll....

So here what you do enlist in first career boost the stats to auto get you
into the second career, boost stats again and enlist in third career and so
on. The minus dm for second and beyond careers is null and void.

This may be a factor of age and/or number of terms in old career.  Maybe
a DM of -(total previous terms/2).

Depends.  Going into a dangerous career significantly different from the
previous one may result in greater chance of injury during the first
term.  Of course, if this is done, it should also apply to raw
recruits.  There\'s a reason noone gets real friendly with the new
replacement \'till he\'s been in country a while.  Personally, I\'d pass on
this one.

I _might_ also see a first-term penalty for promotion.  It doesn\'t
really make since to me for continuance; once you\'re in, you\'re in.

From what I\'ve seen, it applies for enlisted also.

Maybe base the rank in the new career on a D6:

       1: -2   (you\'re desparate!) 
     2-3: -1
     4-5: +0
       6: +1  (You\'ve got something they want!)

> Does it apply at the high end of the spectrum (E7-8-9 and O7-8-9).
I\'d think it applies more strongly at higher paygrades, since you should
be intimately familiar with a service to rank that high in it.  Maybe a
- -1 on the above D6.

> 
> Are some second careers precluded?

Depends on why you left the previous one.  If you got a disciplinary
boot from the Marines, chances are slim of getting in the Navy (except
maybe as a rogue!).  Of course, you might end up in the armed forces of
some PE somewhere; chances are they wouldn\'t have access to all your
records, and wouldn\'t care much, as long as you could do the job.

You made a comment about not moving between careers with ranks. I don\'t
think it should be precluded; maybe just made difficult, like with a DM
of -terms served in previous service for enlistment.
> 
> Any other comments?

It\'d be tricky, but I\'d like to see a reserve program.  Maybe someone in
academia or an agent is in the Navy reserves and picks up 1 service
skill per term in lieu of a normal skill.  Each term roll for
deployment, with deployment being resolved as an active term in that
service in all respects.  Don\'t know how you\'d resolve promotion; maybe
a -DM to the standard roll.  Reservists get promoted, but not as
quickly.

I don\'t think the number of terms should be arbitrarily limited.  Myself
as an example, I did six years active Navy, 2 years hanging drywall, and
I\'m ending about 8 years of schooling.  I\'m getting ready to start my
fourth \'career\', as soon as I finish my thesis and land a job, and I\'m
still in the reserves.  Maybe not common, but not that uncommon either.

If you tell them to "secure the building",

  The NAVY will turn out the lights and lock the doors,
  the ARMY will occupy the building and set up a command center,
  the MARINES will capture the building and defend it with suppressive
fire,
  and the AIR FORCE will take out a 3-year lease with and option to buy.

In early CT this was true, but once JTAS 23 (pp 45-48) came out we had the
TL 14+ Tailored Vacc suit.  This thing beat the old CES all hollow in
terms of armor, comfort, verstaility (it was a full vacc suit after all)
and protection (it was useful in almost any atmosphere and most
temperatures.  With a grav belt you could even survive in Jupiter\'s upper
atmosphere in one.  That\'s the one I truly miss.  I hope it appears in a 
future supplement.

Ways To Roll Dice
	Although there are many schools of thought on how dice should be rolled,=
 the
Traveller game system embraces only three for character generation:
traditional rolls, the pre-rolled sequence, and the specific manipulated =
die
roll.
	Traditional Rolls. As the player creates his or her character, the corre=
ct
number of dice are rolled at the moment the result is required. That resu=
lt
is used, and it cannot be changed or re-rolled.
	Pre-Rolled Sequence. Before the character generation procedure is starte=
d,
the player rolls the dice quite a few times and records the results in or=
der.
The player should roll the half die at least 20 times, a single die at le=
ast
40 times, and two dice at least 50 times.
	During character generation, the player selects the next die roll on the
list and uses it. Because the player can make decisions, the player is
allowed, within the context of the rules, to select what roll is next to =
be
made and can search out options within the rules for the best use of that
roll.
	Manipulated Die Rolls. In some situations, a player=92s goal is a very
specific result: a character of a specific age, or in a specific career, =
or
of a specific rank. In such situations, the player can manipulate the
required die rolls in order to achieve such a result.
	When the player is creating a character to be used for adventuring, the
manipulation of die rolls should be coordinated with the game master in o=
rder
to verify that they are legitimate.

   From the American perspective, if we had trouble maintaining NATO, it
was because certain members (who shall go nameless, though one is known
to be a bit Gaullic...) had trouble with the idea that things couldn\'t
go back to "business as usual" after WW II.  One member in particular
(our Gaullic friend again) became troublesome because they targeted
their nuclear weapons toward West Germany instead of toward the bad
guys, and generally tried to pretend they were an equal military power
to the U.S., which of course they never were. 

   Is the U.S. "excessively dynamic"?  It is far better in terms of
keeping together an empire/republic/kingdom/etc. to be too dynamic than
to be stagnant.  Being stagnant is an open invitation to those who are
dynamic to beat you up and steal your wallet (metaphorically speaking). 
That\'s what happened to the Vilani--the Terrans were able to move in and
steal an empire because of Vilani stagnation.

   Then it is in the best interest of Canada for the U.S. to continue to
be strong, since fear of being culturally "absorbed" by the Americans
seems to be the only thing keeping the Canadian Federal government from
falling apart.

   Thus another tie-in with Traveller: Without question there would be
factions within the Solomani Party that objected to the Solomani
invasion of the Imperium in 1117 on the grounds that it would only serve
to weaken the Imperium and ensure that the Solomani Confederation would
eventually dissolve into feuding factions (once the Imperium was no
longer a threat).  The Imperial threat seemed to be the only thing
keeping the Solomani Confederation together.

  It doesn\'t follow that fighting is the only way to solve problems, or
that what you want to preserve can even survive the fighting - certainly
many Americans regret the outcome or results of the Civil War, and any
real of a loose union with strong states probably died with it.

  Partially, it\'s a question of constitutional forms; the U.S. started as
a loose federation and tightened up quite substantially; Canada started as
a loose confederation and loosened up noticably, largely courtesy of the
legal interpretations of the British parliament. Mostly, we\'re happy with
the results.

  I was wondering how long it was going to take for someone to take exception
(humourous or not) to the tendency to refer to "yanks".

Hello,
  Any reaction to provocation - and from most Canadians\' point of view a
unilateral declaration of independence would be a significant one - is
going to be measured. Only a ridiculously overblown case such as the
one I snipped could prompt an armed response, IMO. But there are ways
to negotiate, with or without threats of force or economic coercion.

  On the whole I\'m surprised that threats of economic consequences haven\'t
quashed the movements commitment to separation long ago. Certainly I can\'t
see any real advantage to the U.S. from an independent Quebec, and possibly
a great deal of possible damage.

  I\'m not really following M:0 (anyone want to buy a copy of Starships?),
but this sort of discussion seems at least vaguely relevant to worlds
associated to some polity/PE or other. Of course, an important difference
would be that any Empire (or at least 1100 years of the Imperium) will
effectively prohibit withdrawal from the state, under threat of economic
embargo or economic action. Such an empire (especially a large one) can\'t
afford free-riders on its\' defence bills, or internal pockets that may
drift politically into enemies, nor can any corporate body (i.e., the
bureaucracies of the Navy, and the Imperial govt) allow the extent of 
either its\' budget or physical presence to be eroded.

expectation of over 400 jobs at the Scout base that will be installed,
four of which will be at the pay grade I\'ll be promoted to as a result".

Lighten up.  He\'s making an analogy to what happened in the U.S. to
precipitate the Civil War.  Of course, in a civilized nation like Canada,
that could never happen.  The people there aren\'t barbarians.  Apparently,
that\'s what the people of my state were 137 years ago, huh?

Let\'s take this to where it belongs: the Trite Political Discussion list
and return -this- list to Traveller.

   Such thinking is foreign to Americans.  While we have our share of
regional and even state rivalries (Ohio, for example, has a long running
feud with Michigan to the north and Kentucky to the south over seperate
border disputes), after 1865 these never get to the point of troop
mobilizations.  Ultimate Federal authority is unquestioned, though
admittedly this doesn\'t stop certain states from grumbling when they
feel the Federal government is imposing burdensome demands.  From our
perspective, the American Civil War was as bloody as it was because
regional issues were allowed to take prescedent over national interest. 
We have no desire to let that happen again.

   I doubt the seperatists in Quebec will care about Canada\'s

them.

   Again a very *foreign* concept to Americans.  States in the U.S.
became states because the population voted the join the union. 
Membership in the U.S. is forever--no provision is made for secession.

   As for a "very Canadian solution", it might be very Canadian, but it
would be in Canada\'s best interest.  No Quebec effective means no
Canada, or at least the pieces that are left would be sorely tempted to
make "other arrangements" concerning their central government.  My
understanding is that the Atlantic coast provinces have already decided
to petition the U.S. to join--is this true?

   As has been stated previously, Traveller and Marc Miller\'s Traveller
have been written by Americans for a predominately American audience. 
It is only natural that there would be a certain amount of bias
involved.  On the other hand, look at some of the alternative goverments
that have been established: the Terran Republic for the New Era milieu,
the K\'Kree, the Federation of Arden, etc.  These show alternatives to
the "Yanks In Space" syndrome you are complaining about.

[Excerpted from an official document released to Kaneshi shipbuilding
concerns by the Kanesh Chartered Guild of Shipwrights (KCGS), local date
Makan IV:33 Upper (Imperial 117-23).  The document carried the Autarch\'s
personal seal.]

Brave companions in our shared triumph!

We, the Council of Nine of the Shipwright\'s Guild, salute you!  Your
perseverence and dedication, your ceaseless toil on behalf of our beloved
Empire, are the shield and the sword which stand between our precious
realm and the barbarians beyond, eager to tear down all we have built, all
we hold most dear. 

[19k omitted.]

Thus, at the personal command of our beloved Autarch Zomaiir III, we
request your proposals for a vessel meeting the following requirements. 

The vessel will form the cornerstone of permanent in-system defense in the
key systems of our Empire.  Its size must be in the range 500 to 1000
displacement tons, and it should not be jump-capable.  It must be capable
of independent and covert \'guerrilla\' operation (e.g., lurking in a gas
giant\'s atmosphere and pouncing on refueling vessels); it must also have
superior sensor capabilities in order to serve in an \'early warning\'
picket role.  Maneuver capability and armaments should be consistent with
the vessel\'s role as a last line of defense against invading fleets. 

All components must be of Kaneshi manufacture, in order to ensure spare
parts are available locally in the event of war.

[The Kaneshi Empire is at TL 10.]

Noble colleagues, skilled shipwrights, honored citizens of our Empire --
heed our Autarch\'s call!  The rewards of success will be great.

Welcome to THUDDD meets Pocket Empires. :)  This info, along with new
rules clarifications and other useful stuff, will appear on the THUDDD
website soon.  Meanwhile, just keep in mind that the primary concern of
the Autarch is price...Kanesh is not a rich PE, and squeezing maximum bang
out of minimum bucks is the key to winning this contract.  To this end,
each contestant should list how many vessels of the proposed design can be
purchased for 10 gigacredits -- include this value with the \'header\'
design data.  If you can credibly provide peacetime roles for the design
(e.g., Coast Guard-like duties, in-system transports, or whatever), all
the better...but the primary mission is detecting and destroying invading
starships, and nothing else should interfere with this. 

FFS2 *will* be a valid design system for this THUDDD, along with all the
earlier systems.  Judges should take into account differences (especially
in sensor performance) between FFS2 and the earlier systems.

As usual, all entries should be sent to me at cberry@cinenet.net.  The

   Referee\'s Section - The real story behind first contact with the
Vilani.  We would almost certainly have overheard their prescence so
nearby by the mid-21st century, and they were probably vaguely aware
that we are here as well.

1) Who knew and when did they know it?

ask: Did the petition writer bother to get some sort of explanation
from Roger before setting about dissing him?  The tone of the original
email and the petition smack of personal animosity, and if this isn\'t
the case then please revise your manner!  Frankly, my gut reaction to
all this was "what a crock of sh*te", and looking at the comments of
the petitioners, I think most would agree.

It doesn\'t seem to be a matter of "giving Roger a chance" or "giving
Roger stick" but perhaps finding out what is really going on before
flying off the handle. Perhaps someone from IG or FFE would like to
confirm/deny Roger\'s assertions - or perhaps not!

Thanks

   I for one have never believed that the American Way is the only way,
or even the best way for everybody.  However, it does seem to possess
certain advantages over many other forms of governing and living.

   It is in our nature to be violent as circumstances demand.  For
everyone who claims to be a passivist, I can usually construct a senario
in which they pull the trigger.  Ghandi (the ultimate advocate of
passivism and passive resistance) was a *highly* unusual man living in
highly unusual circumstances.  It is doubtful that his methods would
have worked against the likes of Hitler, Stalin, or Mussolini.

   The social structure of the U.S. is still sorting itself out from the
massive upheavals that occured in the 1960s, however, I would argue that
it is far more stable now than it was 20 years ago.  Also, the changes
in the U.S. were due to *economic* changes, not so much technological.

   In the case of Japan, social problems there caused by technology go
back to the 19th century, and also appear to be disappearing over time,
however, new social problems associated with declining birth rates and
economic changes loom on the horizon.

   I don\'t know that outside of a purely philosophical discussion, much
has occurred in that regard.  Only recently did cloning come up for some
knee-jerk reaction by politicians here in the U.S. (and some modest
intellectual discussion here and there).  *Ideally* those in charge of
developing new technology think ahead about what it all means in the big
picture, but unless you want to go to the Vilani method, I don\'t see
central control of tech development being all that feasible or wise.

   Someone had to stop Hitler.  No one (or should I say 0.0001 percent
of the population) believed that Hitler and the Nazis Party could be
convinced in 1939 to withdraw their forces from Poland, free all
political prisioners, and surrender control of Germany to proper
authorities.  That\'s why WW II had to be fought.  It would have been
*wonderful* if Hitler could have been taken out early on and his
movement died before it could wreak havoc, but when you\'ve got a madman
with a large number of armed body guards, that isn\'t always an option.

   When there is an effort in the community to train people in the
proper use of firearms, and ownership of said firearms is tolerated,
crime in general (not just violent crime) declines dramatically--without
any significant increase in accidental gun deaths (if anything these
also decline).  Note I said *trained*.  I would not want anyone to own a
firearm unless they had received proper training on how to use and store
it.  Ownership of weapons in the U.S. may be a right, but with that
right comes a heavy *responsibility* to use them in a proper manner.

   It sounds as though you\'ve been watching too much "Clinton News
Network" aka CNN.  Oh sure, there are a few nutcases here and there, but
even the so-called "militia movements" consists of a bunch of basically
law-abiding people concerned about civil liberties.  Americans have far
more to fear from people who blow the threat of so-called "right-wing
terrorism" out of proportion and then take away freedoms in the name of
"national security".

   It\'s *war*, not a football match, of course people are going to die
(offer excludes England).  During the American Civil War, Atlanta,
Richmond, and countless small towns and villages were burned.  You can
expect similar results in Quebec (Montreal wouldn\'t be a good place to
invest in real estate).  The U.S. would probably not intervene--at least
not right away.  We would probably wait to see what the outcome of the
initial fighting brings about.  American troops would first be deployed
to New York and New England, but they would only be there to ensure that
some Quebec unit trying to run away from the Unionists doesn\'t stray
into some small town in Vermont and shoot up the place.

   As for France, I wouldn\'t worry.  Not even the French are stupid
enough to send arms and other supplies to Quebec.  The Monroe Doctrine
is still very much in place, thank you very much, and the French
ambassador to the U.S. would be reminded of this fact.

   U.S. troops would most likely be brought in as peacekeeping troops at
the request of the Canadian government as the conflict came to an end
(or in the unlikely event the Unionists lose, at the request of the
United Nations).  Sure, there would be a period of guerilla warfare
afterward, but if things are handled properly, this would eventually
end.

   Within five years the other Atlantic coast provinces opt out and join
the U.S., as a increasingly isolationist and hostile Quebec makes it
difficult for the central government on maintain contact with its
eastern fringe.  These would be followed by BC and some of the other
western provinces, who could go toward total independence or also
joining the U.S.  The new "rump" country of Canada is now virtually
landlocked and on the verge of lossing its national identity.

>Sorry for the increasingly off-topic rant. Won\'t happen again.

   Actually all this ties into our discussion of the 21st Century
Milieu.  Things should be coming to a head in Quebec within the next 10
years or so, and it would be good to have the political background stuff
worked out ahead of time.

Although he is certainly capable of speaking for himself [a subject our
long in person arguments/discussions about Traveller prove] I believe
what he is protesting here (and I agree) is that in CT and TNE ships had
thruster plates.  In TNE they did not have thruster plates
_and_we_were_supposed_to_believe_they_never_did_, thus canon was
changed.  I happen to agree that HEPlaR is somewhat more plausible using
current understanding of technology than thruster plates were _but_
HEPlaR instead of thruster plates was a big change in technological
history continuity for no more reason than the fact that the TNE people
wanted it to be that way.  

TNE changed the Imperium in a way that I was not wild at at first
(virus) but it did not go around saying "No, that never happened, there
never was an Imperium." it just said the Imperium fell apart because of
virus.  But when they stuck in HEPlaR instead of thruster plates they
_were_saying_ "No, it never happened, there never were thruster plates."
This was unneeded [IMNSHO]. When TNE\'s FFS 1 explained how traveller
ships used gravity focusing on their lasers because otherwise you would
need laser apperture disks 90 m wide to fire at the ranges traveller
ships could they were using science in a good way, to semiscientifically
explain previos canon (small laser dishes and long range combat).  When
T4 said that ships could have either HEPlaR or (at higher TL\'s) thruster
plates they were explaining previous canon (CT & MT\'s thruster plates &
TNE\'s HEPlaR)in a good way.

Change the year of the setting all you want (if you can get a good story
out of it) (TNE was set later and T4 is set earlier than) CT and MT but
don\'t change canon unless you have both 1) a _very_ good reason AND 2)
it is minimal change or reinterpretation rather than a "No that never
happened."  For example the current efforts to get the star generation
system fixed are a good example of a needed change.  Current astronomic
knowledge demands that we get rid of all these habitable traveller
planets aroung dim type M starssince it could never happen that way in
nature and it will only minimally affect canon if we do so since CT, MT,
and TNE never made a big deal out of the spectral types of the stars its
world orbited.  They mentioned it but it was almost never _important_.

from the time of the US Civil War.

The CSS Shenendoah, a commerce raider, had docked in the port of
Melbourne, in the then-British colony of Victoria. At the time, 
Melbourne was entirely undefended, having no shore defenses, Royal
Navy ships or anything else.

Never the less, the main Melbourne newspaper, the Age (www.theage.com.au ...
still a damn good read) wrote an editorial calling for the Governor
to commission a naval vessel to put a shot across the Shenandoah\'s
hull and demand it leave port (the Age\'s editors were strongly pro-Union 
and anti-slavery).

What makes it very Trav was that they envisioned a rowboat containing
six men and a rifle be used, on the grounds that should the Shenandoah
return fire, then the entire force of the RN could be brought against
the Confederacy, making life interesting and short for blockade runners
among others.

I can see similar events happening in the 3I, with a air raft crewed by four 
desperadoes and a Naval Officer with a laser rifle and an newly-written 
authority from  the local governor closing in one some pocket empire\'s
battlewagon, demanding it withdraw from Imperial Space, or face the full
wrath of the Imperial Navy ...

Yes but "entrance is automatic" could also be interpreted as "entrance
on a roll of 12 or less than the negative DM\'s would matter.  In
addition if you disalow choice of advance it becomes harder to raise
attributes enough to automatically qualify.

I would errata it to say that automatic enlistment is only allowed in
the first career _or_ that the negative DM is also a negative DM to the
attributes required for bonuses to enlistment (and thus for automatic
entry).  For example under T4 entering the Navy has DM\'s for INT 8+ and
EDU 9+ therefore is automatic at INT 10+ and EDU 11+.  If the later
career negative DM\'s were used here in your third career you would need
INT 10+ to get a +1 bonus to enlistment roll or EDU 11+ to get a +2
bonus and INT 12+ and EDU 13+ for automatic entrance into the Navy (-2
DM to each).

This raises a point that seemed unclear in T4 - the new career starts 
AFTER mustering out from the old career.  So what happens about 
mustering out benefits, specifically starships?  The only reasonable 
courses of action that I have found are to say to the players either:

1) \'OK, you\'ve rolled a starship.  Now you can either keep the ship
and start adventuring, or re-roll and start another career.\'

OR

2) \'OK, you\'ve rolled a starship.  You don\'t actually get it now, but 
when you start adventuring you\'ll have it, and the reason will be 
something to do with this career you\'ve just left.  Think up 
something good.\'

What do other people do?  What does Marc suggest?

Just a small counterargument:
Some graphics people believe that voxel graphics (that is, 3d pixels,
little cubes filling space) will replace current 2d and 3d techniques
just as raster graphics once replaced vector screens.

One 4000x4000x4000x32 bit image will then take up 256 GB.
Suppose you want to do an animation? 100 fps yields 25.6 TB/s.
That\'s 40 seconds per PB. And so your storage media would only
hold 600 seconds, or ten minutes of video (unpacked).

I realise this argument is a tad extreme, but at least it shows
that there will always be applications that use more storage than
you have...

defending a system from succesive attacks by Vampire ships in a TNE

for reloads were really expensive, and that beam weapons of one sort or

	While I have responded to Harold privately, I won\'t do so to the

getting grumpy.  Anyone else wants to read what I had to say to Harold, let

This is a bit inacurate.  If you mean that rivalry between the states
has not resulted in troop hobilizations since 1865 I believe you are
correct. If you mean ultimate federal authority is not questioned by the
_states_ to the point of mobilizing troops you are ignoring various
charming events (occuring mostly in the 1950\'s, 60\'s, and 70\'s) that
were part of the oppostion to the Civil Rights movement. Perhaps some of
you out there recall George Wallace standing in the doorway to the
University of Missippi and sying (basically) that this is a white
university and will stay one.

 If you mean ultimate federal authority over the states is unquestioned
in general by the _states_ you are ignoring vast ammounts of legal
precedent in which the states sue the Federal government and say "You
can\'t do that because you do not have the Constitutional right to do
so."  Lately the Supreme Court has been backing them up (sometimes). 
Something about the 10th Ammendment I believe....

"Article [X.] 

The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor
prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to
the people."

US Constitution Ammendment 10

If you mean that the federal government authority to do so is not
questioned by the _people_ that depends on which people you are refering
to.  I realize that this is off topic but I can assure that I do
consider that the federal government has the authority to do so. In my
not so humble opinion the North acted in a way that was blatantly
illegal and Lincoln violated the US Constitution in an unforgivable
way.  Moreover I would like to point out that neither historians nor
Americans in general agree that 

> "From our perspective, the American Civil War was as bloody as it was > because regional issues were allowed to take prescedent over national > interest." 

I would suggest that the American Civil War (alternately The War Between
The States) occured because the North illegally attempted to prohibit
the southern states from leaving _As_was_their_right_to_do_so [IMNSHO].

(If you disagree the proof I require to convince me otherwise would
consist of words in the US Constittion (circa 1861) saying that states
do not have the right to secede and _NO_ such text exists.  The 10th
Ammendment once again applies - the power to stop states from leaving
was not reserved for the federal government and therefore it was
reserved to the states.)

> We have no desire to let that happen again.

You\'re not from the South I take it :)

Also ObTrav - Nor should we assume that governments are now constituted
as they were one or two hundred years ago.  Nor should we assume that
the popular view of the "legitemacy" of a government (whether Imperial
or US Federal) is correct.

Yes and I have always found it strange that more Traveller players are
not more sympathetic towards the Solomani.  After all almost all
Traveller players are 100% Solomani. 
 
P.S. Where can I get my  Solomani Party membership card ? :)

Actually the emissive sig for thrusters, PP etc should be calculated
separately and the largest one used. The current rules are simplified for
playability(?) compared to my original homebrew upon which these rules are
somewhat derived.

Nope, some guys smarter than me figured that the only way to do it without

fire a gravity soliton along the beam that would interact with the photons
all the way to the target.

(sigh) well, I hope this doesn\'t degrade into a flamewar or anything, but
here I go;

Well, Stewart, as one of the petitioners and, like you I think, a long time
member of this electronic Traveller community, I have to completely
disagree with your position.

Roger has held license to the DGP material for a long time.  In fact, he
has had that license through three different Traveller management teams
(GDW, IG under Whitman, and the current "regime").  I will not repeat what
rumors I have heard, instead I will simply point out the possibilities
1). IG is not allowing him to reprint the materials (as Roger has implied),
2). he has not done anything about publishing the materials himself.

if (1) is the case we must ask ourselves if Courtney Solomon or Marc Miller
(Both of whom would have to agree, as I understand it) might not have a
reason for this.  I would suggest that the reason is that Roger *has yet to
prove he can produce any gaming product at all!*  This is in spite of
various efforts to do so.  It is also possible that Courtney or Marc are
afraid that the DGP material would compete for dollars with new T4
material.  I think this is relatively resonable too, although I might not
like it.  In this case Jo Grant\'s petition is a means of \'asking\' Roger to
give up or sell the rights to DGP\'s traveller material.  Perhaps not the
friendliest method, but this is the \'net after all.

if (2) is the case, then the petition is perfectly justified.

 I was involved in an effort which Roger initiated a few years ago,
starting with a message to this mailing list (or it\'s direct predecessor,
if you wish) inviting participation.  I found that project to be thoroughly
disorganized, and the effort he was undertaking seemed more aimed at petty
empire building than serious game design.  Perhaps it was a learning
experience for him, but it left me with a poor impression.  If this
impression is incorrect, them I\'m sorry that I took it as such, but it is
the basis for my signing the petition and my basis for believing the things
stated above.

Roger\'s message redirected us to another product - non-traveller - which
DGP is apparently working on.  I will consider it Vaporware until it is
actually published, but perhaps that is the sign IG will need to allow
Roger to proceed.

I have nothing against Roger personally.  I simply do not believe he would
"do it right" similar to the way that Ken Whitman fell short in certain
areas.  I still like Ken (I met him at GenCon and spoke on the phone
several times) but I really feel the change in management was best for him
and IG.  Similarly, without regard to Roger\'s personality or other
unrelated factors (of which I have no knowlege anyway), I do not think
Roger\'s republishing the DGP material is the best thing to do with that
material.

Naturally I am simply expressing my opinion, no hurtful comments or angry
retorts expressed or implied, nor would such be welcomed in return.

    'body' => 'The talk of M:E21 has prompted me to think about the Interstellar Wars
(actually this has been in the back of my mind for a while). I gone
through my Traveller library to find what I know about the Interstellar
Wars with the aim of producing a hypothetical Interstellar War sourcebook.
So far this is what I\'ve found:

The first war lasted from -2408 to -2400, this was followed by eight
more distinct numbered wars (2nd through 9th) and then the Nth (-2235
to -2210). If one regards the Nth as simply one war, this gives 10 wars
over a 198 year period.

The Terrans won the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 8th and 9th Wars (and the Nth of
course); no mention of who won the 4th, 5th, 6th or 7th Wars. The 1st War
was fought by the independent nations of Terra, under the loose control of
the UN. After the 1st War the Terrans brought all their forces under a
single strong central command. The 2nd through 7th were fought mainly in the
Dingir and Sol subsectors (early wars in the Sol Subsector, later wars in
Dingir), the Barnard and Fenris systems were crucial points during the early
wars and were fiercely contested. The 8th War involved a very successful
Terran offensive into the Albadawi Subsector, and resulted in the Vilani
ceding all worlds rimward of Vega to the Terrans. The 9th War involved saw
the Vilani central government deploy significant forces for the first time,
but they were defeated due to the Terran\'s invention of jump 3 drives and
meson guns and the Vilani lost the entire sector. The Vilani were at TL 11
through out the wars. At the start of the 1st War the Terrans were at TL 9,
at the end of the 1st War they were at TL 10, two years after that they were
at TL 11 (equal to the Vilani). The Terrans started moving into TL 12 just
11 years after the end of the 1st War, but did not fully reach it until the
9th War.

So heres my highly unofficial "brief" summary of the 1st to 9th Interstellar
Wars.

First Interstellar War (2118AD to 2126AD)
The war started accidentaly over a minor incident on Barnard. Initially the
Vilani provincial government paid little attention to it, deploying minor
forces to contain the Terrans. The Terrans however were throwing everything
they had into the fight. The Terrans quickly expelled the Vilani from
Barnard and it settled down to an attritional battle as the Vilani attempted
to break the Terran perimeter at Barnard and Fenris. However the Vilani
underestimated the Terrans and never committed sufficent forces to break the
perimeter. During the war the Terrans launched many deep penetration raids
into the Vilani Imperium resulting in significant economic dislocation.
The Vilani governor, concerned at the continuing drain on the economy of the
war made peace in 2126AD, recognising Terran control of Barnard.

Second Interstellar War (2145AD to 2150AD)
A new Vilani provincial governor launched a suprise offensive aimed at
regaining Barnard. However the Vilani had seriously underestimated Terran
strength. The Terrans had by know equalled the Vilani technologically and
brought their forces under a single central command. The initial offensive
was easily contained and in 2147AD, the Terrans launched a counter-offensive
at Agidda. The Vilani response was difficent and the Terrans captured Agidda
in 2148AD. The Terrans followed up their success at Agidda with an attack on
Nusku. The local Vilani forces put up a heroic resistance here and the
Terrans were stalled. The Vilani then launched a counter-offensive aimed at
Fenris, but this was defeated with some difficulty by the Terrans (having
suffered heavy loses at Nusku). Again throughout the war, the Terrans
launched many deep penetration raids into Vilani space; and  with the war
stalemated, the Vilani made peace in 2150AD, ceding Agidda to the Terrans.

Third Interstellar War (2154AD to 2166AD)
The Vilani governor, severly humiliated by the Terran victory in the 2nd War,
launched simultanious offensives aimed at Fenris and Agidda. The thrust at
Fenris was held with some difficulty, but the Agidda offensive was successful
and the Terrans were forced back to Barnard. Barnard fell to the Vilani in
2156AD and the Vilani moved to attack Terra directly in early 2157AD. This
proved to be a miscalculation on the part of the Vilani, as it incited near
fanatical resistance in the Terrans. The Vilani were defeated and forced from
Terra in mid 2156AD with heavy losses. By this stage both sides had suffered
severe loses and paused to regroup. This phoney war period lasted until late
2159AD when the Vilani (reinforced by central government troops for the first
time) again attacked Fenris. Whilst not able to take Fenris, the Vilani were
successful in besieging it and moving on to attack Junction in the middle of
2160AD. The battle of Junction was the turning point of the 3rd War. The
Vilani Fleet was defeated and scattered in late 2160AD and the Terrans moved
on to lift the seige of Fenris in 2161AD. In mid 2161AD the Terrans launched a
diversionary attack at Barnard. The diversion was successful and the Vilani
diverted significant forces to hold Barnard. In early 2162AD the Terrans
launched their major offensive at Sirus. With most of their forces tied up
at Barnard, the Vilani were woefully unprepared for this attack. In little
more than 18 months the Terrans had seized Sirus, Shulimik, Iilike and
Markhash. The Terrans then transfered the weight of their forces to the
Barnard Front; and quickly recaptured both Barnard and Agidda. In early 2166AD
the Vilani provincial governor was replaced and the Vilani made peace ceding
the Sol Subsector to the Terrans.

Fourth Interstellar War (2185AD to 2191AD)
An uneasy period of peace followed the 3rd War. However the Terrans allowed
their defences to run down during the interwar period. In 2185AD the Vilani
launched an attack at Nusku. The Terran defences proved inadequate and the
world was quickly overun. Rather than turn towards the heart of the
Confederation, the Vilani chose to drive to liberate Ishimshulgi and Lagash.
The drive was successful and by 2186AD the Terrans had lost both worlds. The
Vilani then turned their attentions towards the Terran worlds in the Dingir
Subsector and attacked Iilike in 2187AD. By this stage the Terrans had rebuilt
their forces and successfully held the Vilani at Iilike. The war then bogged
down into an attritional fight around the Terran perimeter at Iilike and
Agidda. With the usual long range Terran raids into the Vilani Empire, this
form of warfare proved to be to costly for the Vilani to sustain. In 2191AD
a negotiated settlement was reached with the Vilani regaining the Coreward
portion of the Sol Subsector.

Fifth Interstellar War (2203AD to 2213AD)
Still smarting from their defeat in the 4th War, the Terrans launched an
attack aimed at retaking the worlds lost in that war. The Terran strategy was
not however aimed at directly reconquering the worlds, rather isolating them
and reducing them at leisure. The initial Terran target was Nusku which fell
after a brief siege. Then rather than turn to trailing as the Vilani expected,
the Terrans drove into the Dingir Subsector taking Apishal and Zaggisi in
2203AD, thereby establishing a strong defensive position. Only then did the
Terrans turn their attentions on the Coreward worlds in the Sol Subsector.
Whilst holding of the Vilani in Dingir, the Terrans reduced these worlds one
by one over the next 3 years. During this period, the Vilani launched a
number counter-offensives aimed at relieving their posestions in the Sol
Subsector. However the Terrans held off each one (albeit with some difficulty).
With the Sol Subsector secure, the Terrans turned again to Dingir. In 2207AD
they moved against Shuruppak and Meshan. Both these worlds fell with little
struggle and the Terrans drove deeper into Dingir. However they were now
starting to overreach themselves. In 2210AD the Terrans reached Kinunir. Their
defeat at the Battle of Kinunir marked the high water mark of the Terran
advance in the 5th War. Over the course of the next 3 years the Vilani
gradually pushed the Terrans back. However the war was proving to be a strain
on both parties economies and in 2213AD a treaty was negotiated returning the
border to it\'s pre 4th War state.

Okay, its 1am here now. I\'ll finish the 6th through 9th Wars tommorrow.

Strangely, here in New Zealand (once described not inaccurately as the

Pro Solomani. Maybe its something in the water.

Only if the wavelengths of the emitted radiation are different.  If
I look at a certain bandpass and count 1 photon from the ship, and
10 from the drive plume, I still caught 11 photons at that
wavelength.  My detector doesn\'t care that one was made by the hull
and the rest by the drive plume.

When you have ESM intercept that might be radio transmissions, or
radar, then you\'re looking with a different detector than your IR or
visual telescope so adding up signals isn\'t as appropriate.

So certain mods would be cumulative while others wouldn\'t as I see
it.  Anyway, I guess PP is tied to size to some degree, but the
balance of size vs. PP output certainly changes from civilian to
military ships.

Microsoft has a patch for outlook available on it\'s website that corrects
this issue (the internet mail enhancement program or IMEP). I don\'t know

	The Long-Range Colonizing missions sent out in generation ships to
the Islands _had_ to be a worst-case insurance plan against destruction by
the "Baddies from Barnard."  There\'s no other reason to send slowboats so 
far to such a totally isolated region of space except to preserve the race 
in case of catastrophe.  So, obviously the ESA knew it, and presumably 
the US and other powers of the time, whoever the were, probably knew it, too.
	The expedition to the Islands was launched in 2050, so, 
considering preparation time, the ESA had to know by at least 2040, 
probably earlier.

> 2) What preparations were made on Terra for our first face-to-face
> encounter?

	The space-faring nations established significant space fleets both
to gain experience and as defensive forces.  Perhaps one of these fleets
captured a Vilani prospector or some such who came into the system, and
this ultimately allowed them to duplicate the j-drive.  There might also
have been defense installations secretly constructed, like giant PAWs in
hollowed out asteroids. 

> 3) Why didn\'t the Vilani just absorb us?

	Probably it was just politically inconvenient for the first 
governor who discovered us to admit it.  After that, it became harder and 
harder to explain why no one had noticed us before.  Or maybe it was a 
lot of work for the bureaucracy to integrate a new species into the 
Imperium and they didn\'t want to be bothered.  Besides, what\'s one more 
human minor race, more or less?

You have heard of telephones, right? If you haven\'t, they\'re these marvellous
machines that would let a central government keep contact with its 
"eastern fringe" no matter who\'s in the way. 

Seriously - I can\'t imagine any quebec government closing its borders;
trade with the rest of canada will be crucial to its economy. The worst I can
possibly imagine is a dispute over Quebec charging excessively high transit
fees - and even that is unlikely, as a Quebec government is really, really
going to want to be part of NAFTA and hence will be bound by NAFTA 
rules on free trade.

Yeah, will you please rein that in?! <g>

Seriously though, John, I appreciate your post here. I had stumbled upon
the description of Blue Planet a few months back at the Biohazard site and
sort of forgot about the game since then. I was intrigued by the
description.

Thanks to your ad, I\'ll probably buy a copy, so your advertising and
shameless self-promotion guaranteed at least one sale!

Best,

A little handwave for my gravscanners/massdetectors:
In my uncanonical but remarkably similar universe tractors/pressers come in
at short range vs missiles at TL 15 and real long range such at TL 16+
(remember that Strephons palace was held in place not by gravthrusters but
repulsers on the ground according to DGP Capital issue). Before TL 15
however we are able to make VERY feeble tractors. They pull SLIGHTLY at far
away targets and the power consumtion of them is the sum of mass/range^2
for all targets within its lobe. Thus by measuring the powerconsumtion they
can detect massive targets. they cannot see through planets as the power
for tractoring the planet will noise out any starships etc on the other
side. Another drawback here is the fact that as armourplate will be pretty
close the sensors will have to be put on the outside of the ship - not as
convenient as neutrino sensors.

>>If you *have* such a way of blocking
>>neutrinoes, why not just apply it to the power plant so no-one else can
>>see your neutrinoes?

I do not buy this argument as this would apply to other signatures as well:
"If you can detect photons why not use that technology to block the photons
thus making the ship invisible"
I know the anology falters due to thermodynamics etc but if one can detect
say 1 per million neutrino shot off it would be useable for detection but
not for shielding.

My larger reason for using neutrino/mass detectors is that I tend to look
at Traveller tech as more than quantative change: At TL 6-7 we generally
look at planes/ships with radars, at TL 8 we gradually go over to
IR/visual. The IR/Visual sensing rules supreme in space until TL 13 when
(in my Universe) thrusterplates arrive that make starships MUCH harder to
detect (no exhaust plume); luckily enough gravscanners arrive at about the
same time to detect those thrusterplates (each ton of thrust from
thrusterplates/gravthrust produces the equivalent of 10 tons of mass sig)
and at really high TLs (14+) shipboard neutrinoscanners arrive that make
heavily armoured battleships practical. This (in my Universe) is the main
reason that battleships tend to be so large in traveller (the larger the
ship the more armour and they have to be big enough to room several
neutrinoscanners).

In summary I want my spaceship fights to be different at different TLs/eras.

being curved.  A star (or planet, or pocketwatch for that matter) makes
a \'dent\' in the fabric of space.

A grav plate, however, _wrinkles_ the space around it, making a very
sharp local distortion or gravitational gradient.  The greater the
gradient you wish to create, the more energy you have to put in.  If you
want a larger gradient, again it requires more energy.  However, because
the warp is small, the effect dies off at a very short range--space for
all intensive purposes, wants to remain flat (via the conservation of
energy).  Creating a sub meter radius, 1000 G gradient to focus your
laser would have little practical effect beyond the confines of the
laser turret.

Rather than a single device that creates such a powerful field,
G-focused laser (graser?) would employ several small gravatic devices,
each focused on a small area just outside the columniation chamber\'s
emitter.   The fields overlap, creating the huge gradient needed to
focus the laser.  Also, this provides the method to _focus_ the
laser-altering the individual field strengths changes the laser\'s point
of convergence.

Another matter is why the ship doesn\'t implode on the laser turret.  Two
reasons-artificial gravity fields decay at an exponential rate and
contragrav devices are used to \'\'shield" the device from the rest of the
ship.

True. Your mention of a "space elevator" would make shipping freight
relatively cheap though. For an interesting mishap with a space elevator,
read Kim Stanley Robinson\'s RED MARS. Reading this book will make you
believe that security for a space elevator would be extreme because the
consequences of sabotage to such a device could have effects on the entire
Terran population!

Yeah, pretty much. I\'ve been slowly developing an Interstellar Wars milieu
for my players for some time now. The premise would be that they are a crew
of diverse backgrounds who are hired to serve as corsairs during the 1st
Interstellar War. Without an interstellar navy to speak of, the Terrans
would have to rely on commerce raiding to destabilize the local Vilani
economy.

A similar scenario could be played out in the E21 milieu. Here I go with a
literary reference again. Ben Bova\'s PRIVATEERS presents an interesting
prototype for such a setting.

There are many photo maps at this site that could be squeezed into the

During the construction of the Hoover Dam, there was a huge argument
between the states of Arizona and California over the division of the water
of the lower Colorado river.  This argument (which really dates back to the
days of the Spanish rule of the region) grew and grew until the governor of
Arizona mobilized the state militia with orders to seize the Hoover Dam.  A
quick response by the Federal government ended the impasse before the
troops actually took possession of the dam, but the forces were mobilized
and preparing to go.

So, to bring in the obligatory Traveller reference; how would the Imperium
resolve such a situation?  Image a subsector in some backwater new sector
of the Imperium.  There are two TL10 worlds here, Planet Alpha and Planet
Beta.  Both worlds are relatively similar, but Planet Alpha is more wealthy
in minerals and has a higher technology, and Planet Beta has a higher
population and larger economy.  Planet Beta gets a large portion of its
mineral needs from Planet Alpha.  Both worlds are not so hot
agriculturally, and both depend on large colonies on Planet Zeta (a nearby
agricultural world).  The Imperium comes in, and suddenly Alpha and Beta
are part of the Imperium.  Zeta has no government of its own, but two
colonies from worlds that are now part of the Imperium.

So - does the Imperium force Zeta to become independent?  Does it hand it
over to either Alpha or Beta for sole rule?  When a minor famine hits Zeta
and the more-populous Beta decides to grab all of the crop for the year,
how does the Imperium react?  Does the Imperium act immediately>  Does it
wait until Alpha sends a military force to occupy Zeta?

I would suspect that the Imperium would not allow the dual-ownership of
Zeta; it would either be made its own independent polity or it would be
granted to one of the two other worlds when the Imperium took over.
However, this would not remove the fact that both Alpha and Beta need Zeta
to survive.  The Imperium does not take a huge interest in the internal
affairs of its member worlds, but this situation would demand some sort of
Imperial attention because:
   A.  Relations between member worlds are an Imperial prerogative
   B.  Any military activity between Alpha and Beta would involve the space
lanes, another Imperial prerogative.

and, of course, the Imperium would not want to lose a significant part of
the population of one of its member worlds to an argument over resources.

Any thoughts?

Well, I have a plead. It is tangentially linked with Chargen per se, but
here it comes anyway:

May we (please) have a non-starship Engineering skill (at least one...) for
people who build houses, bridges, airplanes and so on? 
I\'d like a career based on some kind of "blue collar merc" like the ones
who (here on Earth)  work on oil rigs, build dams in remote regions and so
on, someone who works on the various kind of infrastructure  for a planet.

An Imperial Civil Engineering Corps woul be nice and I think that an
official "Engineer" skill would be a godsend.

And very nicely put too. :)
Stewart, I have to say that I am actually quite interested in this
discussion. Hearing an insiders view about their own government (as well as
an outsiders point of view of that same government) actually helps to give
me ideas about different traveller governments. My view of a foreign
goverenment will always be tainted by my own misconceptions. Hearing about
the varios problems not only helps me with an understanding, but also leads
me to plot ideas. 
Still, you are right, we should rememeber that this is a list for
discussing traveller in it\'s various forms, and try not to get too carried
away.

	But it was to late, the virus spread around the Vilani rimward

Make it DXF then as ALL 3D apps can read/write that despite its crappiness

To be polite.  I picked Quebec because I was discussing this with a
Canadian, and because it *is* relatively unlikely that anything this
drastic will happen there.  If I had been discussing this with an
Englishman, I would have used Scotland...using Ireland would have
been...well, I *was* speaking hypothetically.  ;->

However, if you want to get right down to it, I don\'t really KNOW that *no*
Quebec (or Canadian) government would ever do any of the above. Heaven

acts, and yes, this includes various governments in the United States. 
What I was attempting to get at was what I perceived as an attitude of "It
can\'t happen here, because *we\'re* different.", and IMO, it can happen
ANYWHERE.  If you think it can\'t happen where you live, then you\'re half
way to letting it happen.

>>Ob Traveller, I wish you foreigners <g> would quit referring to Yanks in

In reply to someone\'s question as to how you should refer to us, well, I
live in the United States of America, and I\'m an American.

American is what we call ourselves, and whether Canadians, Mexicans,
Brazilians, Englishmen or Swedes <g> think that\'s fair, that *is* what we
call ourselves. We would *like* you to call us that too.

Specifically, "Yank" or "Yankee" refers to Americans that live in the New
England states..or generically to any citizens of the north or midwestern
states.  Just as you shouldn\'t call Scotsmen or a Welshmen, English, you
shouldn\'t refer to *all* Americans as Yanks.  I had intended my comment to
be taken as a joke, but, if you like, you can think of it as defending our
trademarks.  ;->

Finally, Peter, it was Alabama, not Mississippi, where Wallace "stood in
the schoolhouse door."  Mississippi didn\'t need the Alabama governor for
that, they had enough idiot politicians of their own stirring up trouble.
Racial bigotry isn\'t unique to the American South, but the racial bigots of
my region *are* a continuing embarrassment to many of my fellow

Oh! I thought it was for the Mac. Can you point me towards somewhere (ideally

Due to the simple fact that we\'re dealing with a pretty steep logscale
max(log(a),log(b) is about the same as a+b, right?
As the factor for drive, pp etc will change during play we need to
recalculate them during play; either we calculate them, sum them and log
them or just take the max of the dominant one. I\'ve tried both versions and
believe me to the latter is far easier to cope with.

Your example of 1 + 10 would be:

max(log10(10),log10(1)) = 1

log10(10+1) = 1

Hello,
  Peeling off territory that rightly belonged to the Race (i.e., every
human inhabited, or uninhabited star system in this galaxy, at least)
is certainly a moral duty of any loyal Sol-Sec representative. Given
the fact of the Rebellion, they could always helpfully prevent Imperial
collapse by supporting one or more factions; being effectively undamaged
they could certainly afford it.

  Also, didn\'t Vega go hedgehog around an Imperial Navy concentration?
Daibei could also be represented to Confederation politico\'s as a threat
in order to maintain cohesion. Sol-Sec wouldn\'t hesitate to subvert the
intelligence feed to other state institutions, if it could.

Meanwhile, the intent of Nth Interstellar War was to convey that toward the
end of the period, some groups of worlds were at peace while others continued
to fight. The Ziru Sirka (or is it Sirkaa?) talked out of several sides of
its collective mouth, and kept fighting etc.The traditional numbering system
for wars was used (1-8) or so until it fell apart.

I have been talking with Loren Wiseman about he and I doing the E21 milieu,
and it would be a natural for us to do the Interstellar Wars after that. I
believe that a Milieu should be used to reflect on a specific type of play
and emphasize that. E21 would emphasize the Soalr System and the Grand Story
of first contacts with the Vilani. The Interstellar Wars would benefit from
emphasizing space battles and ship design.

I assume you meant, of course, "reintroduction of Cutlasses for Marines". I
never thought they went away, myself, just got subsumed into the "Large
Blade" skill category.

I really like what I have seen of the new chargen rules, especially with
multiple careers reinstated, after a fashion. I like all of the things
listed above, and look forward to utilizing this in future Traveller games.

  Been there. Nothing new :) An interesting point on the perhaps
unlikely prospect of provinces trying to join the U.S.; how much
trouble would be caused by, say three more New England states
each electing radical left wing Democratic senators (hmm, the NDP
claims to be an avowedly _socialist_ party - kinda makes calling
opponents "liberal" pretty weird in context)?

  This also raises a question in small interstellar states that
aren\'t simply based on one conquering power - what will the new
balance of power within the polity be after admission of new
members? The 3I in 1100 is too big for any single member to matter,
but to a single sub-sector or even sector government it can make a
great deal of difference, particularly if factions aren\'t ideology
driven (see 18th C. Britain). This also remembers the pre-ACW
period somewhat, correct?

All wars, even the mythological American Revolution, are complex events

and power.  In the case of IW #1, one object was simple, survival.  Even 
a poor tactician could sense that envelopment of Terran space, however large 
and vibrant, would lead to the assimilation of Terra into the Vilani state.
That couldn\'t be allowed, so all that was required for war was a pretext.
Perhaps that wasn\'t even necessary.  Maybe the Vilani were in violation of
some very basic agreements.  After all, these were the same people who
expended great effort at subjugating every race and people they 
encountered by convincing them that they were inferior to Vland, and who 
hardly balked at using mass-destruction warfare to achieve the desired
ends.

Perhaps that merchant caravan was armed, perhaps it intentionally
hazarded Terran astrogation or facilities at Barnard.  

And I don\'t mind anyone using the word "Yankee" of me (I consider it a

An idea I often use in some of the worlds. Often, I treat some of the more
main-stream balkanized worlds this way. They, as a group, joined the
Imperium... even though they actually are merely in a treaty to jointly pay
the taxes and levies of imperial membership. The scouts say they are
balkanized due to no common rule of law; the imperium sees them as a
"Member World"...

  The canonical material doesn\'t cover a lot of the important
points necessary to play in the later 21st century. Admittedly,
we have to decide whether states have mostly withered away (let\'s
assume not for now), which doesn\'t seem indicated in the material.

  The UN must have been pretty weak until the Wars. So power in
the classic Realist sense lies with the Great Powers. Unless
there\'s been a tremendous upheaval of one sort or another then
both Japan and the U.S. are going to qualify. Europe will if united,
and possibly China if it\'s somehow continued to advance under
it\'s burdens. Who else would qualify as Great Powers in 2050
rather than regional powers (seriously, Nigeria may end up as
the strongman of sub-Saharan Africa, but the U.S. would still
tell them where to stick it when it mattered to them).

  Also, when the Terran Confederation is formed, what bribes
are used to bring the less-developed countries on-board to a
group that is just a fig leaf for the bigger powers operations
(or suggest why all is sweetness and light)?

  BTW, what is the minimum heredity for Solomani citizenship?

Personally, I\'d rather have more career branches than more careers (although 
ideally I\'d like both) - an Army infantryman has more in common with a 
Marine infantryman than with an Army filing clerk!

The problem with this approach is that the field has to be bigger than 
"sub meter radius". Whether you use glass or gravity to focus light, it\'s
still limited by diffraction - a 1-m diameter beam coming out of a 
magic grav device will still have an angular spread lambda/D and hence
not be very useful - no better than a glass lens 1-m in diameter could have
made. (We can make mirrors or lenses that achieve essentially perfect
wavefronts - grav lensing wouldn\'t let you do any better.) To get decent
beam performance with this approach the beam as it leaves the gravity field
has to be tens of meters across, which means the gravity field has to be 
tens of meters across and millions of G\'s...Which is hard to do. The 
travelling pulse is somewhat more plausible.

The problem is that sensors are on a log scale - you can\'t add numbers on
a log scale. (Well, you can, but you\'re multiplying when you do.)

Look at the signature table:

Power		Signature
0.01-0.09 MW      -2.
0.1-0.9 MW        -1.5
1 -9 MW           -1
10 MW             -0.5
100 MW             0



Consider for example a missile with wimpy little batteries and a power of
0.05 MW - signature -2. We calculate somehow that its thrusters radiate
about 5 MW of heat - signature -1. How do we calculate the total signature
with thrusters on? If we add the signatures we get -3 - clearly wrong.
We could add the power (0.05 MW + 5 MW = 5.05 MW) and then look up that
on the signature table - and we\'d get -1. The scale is so coarse that
just using the largest signature pretty much always works.

Now, what I\'ve done is implicitly assume that power due to HEPlaR is
proportional to ship size (fair enough) and ship size is proportional to 
power plant output (less fair) so that lighting up the HEPlaR always
basically increases your signature by a factor of ten. This isn\'t
perfectly true because military ships have bigger power to weight
ratios than civilians - but military also have masking (bringing their
sig back down), and anyway the table is so coarse that we only have
to be right to within a factor of 3 or so - so for playability I made the
tradeoff.

Is there some form of backwards compatibility here?  I want to match up
with the Advanced Military sensor package I installed in my THUDD entry,
but none of your choices are even close in power, volume and price to the
numbers I have.  We\'re talking major revisions here.

Perhaps there is something I am missing.  I am tempted to submit my THUDDD
entry with sensors as-is and let the jury decide what to do about it.
Maybe it would be best to wait for the next THUDDD to use these new rules?

My point wasn\'t about detection but shielding; the neutrino sensor is much
closer to the sensing ship\'s power plant than any target, so the signal from
the target will get completely swamped by the signal from its own power
plant, unless you can perfectly shield the sensor from the power plant.
(The same applies to IR photons - you have to have the sensor inside a very
cold enclosure - and as you point out, thermodynamics prevent you from making
the whole ship that cold.)

Anyway, it\'s a matter of taste and philosophy. Actually, it\'d be interesting
to see your neutrino and mass signatures and sensitivities adjusted to 
my range scale - maybe post them as a variant.

Think this also depends a lot on whether or not your version of jump drive 
drops you into predefined areas of space or whether popping into another 
system is random. Does your campaign\'s version of a j-drive always drop a
ship into the same "entry point" in a system? Can you choose your "entry 
point"? Are "entry points" random? The same questions for "exit points".
What about micro jumps; a ship can\'t jump out of a grav well without 
major problems, what about jumping in? In a campaign that allowed ships
to choose their entry points (to preposition them in the correct spaces about
the star), and to them quickly microjump into range around the star, would
be a campaign in which folks gave the Darrians a wide right of way.

More so.  The US is not in the unenviable position of having C3I be months
or years behind the action.  There will be times where Something Must Be
Done, and the right tool for the job is a Marine.  The Navy will know this,
and will either need to have some Marine-trained navy chaps, or will need
to be able to get some Marines under their command.  I could see either,
but I have always liked the idea of any given area being under primary
control of one service, with smaller groups of the others as time, space,
and budget permit.  This would lead (imho) to more inter service crosstalk
and rivalry, unfettered by high command.  Clever high officers would use
the other services around when possible, while foolish ones would snipe
when they do not have to.

In my universe, which is fairly non canonical, most characters who wish to
go into another service are still on the rolls of the initial one, and are
merely counted as seconded.  This requires a new enlistment roll for both
services, representing what your present and your future service thought of
the idea.  Failure is not terribly bad for a person, though, as it is
usually kept quiet.

If your present service says no, but you made a better than average success
on the other\'s enlistment roll, it means that the other service really
wants you.  You can then switch without penalty, but cannot return to the
old one.

If, on the other hand, both agree, then you are seconded.  You receive a -2
on all promotion rolls, as you must convince both services to give you
rank, but you roll for skills, promotion, etc. on the new services table.
At the end of the term, you roll continuance at -2.  If you make it, then
you stay in the new service, if you fail it, but would have made it without
penalty, you return to the old one, and if you fail, you are out of both.

If you switch, then you have to make a series of promotion rolls as I
described earlier to see how many ranks you lose, but you have no penalties
at all to promotion or continuance.

Practical upshot - a service change often leads to loss of rank, benefits,
seniority, brownie points, and so on, but if you can convince them to
second or switch you, there can be large benefits.

I prefer the travelling gravity wave concept to static focusing for one
reason:

What would happen if you mounted one of these puppies you describe on a
bomb, drop it from a plane and hit a city. Just before it hits ground,
kill the "contragrav shield" device.

Grav implosion. Ouch.

I trust BAM\'s scientific background and reasoning behind his sensor and
laser rules. Like he said, a weak travelling grav pulse makes an easier,
less disruptive handwave than a static, powerful grav focussing effect.

I think a hurdle a lot of people get caught up in is Einstein\'s analogy
of space being warped like a rubber sheet by mass, and that\'s what
creates gravity. Then they wonder how dimples are moving without mass
attached! Remember: it\'s an analogy. It\'s like saying an electromagnet
warps magnetic-space around it causing dimples on a rubber sheet. He
used the rubbersheet analogy to graphically illustrate the fact that
gravity is inexorably linked to mass. Spacetime is "curved" because mass
exists.

Obviously with things like contra-grav, inertial compensators and
whatnot, Traveller-tech has found a way to create dimples without mass
attached. Why is it such a leap to be able to move the dimples wrt the
source?

Gravitational field effects are similar in many respects to
electromagnetic fields. Gravity is the weakest of the forces, weaker
then electromagnetic fields. It\'s no wonder we haven\'t yet discovered
the graviton or measured gravitational waves.

OTOH, physicists may be out to lunch. It boils down to this: What\'s the
least disruptive, most elegant handwave to explain why we can keep
lasers focussed at such long distances? I like small travelling grav
pulses. As the technology improves and becomes more efficient, repulsor
beams are developed by firing stronger or more rapid bursts...

Ultimately, IG is at fault. They should have gotten galley proofs from the 
printers and reviewed them themselves. They definitely should have sent
those galley proofs to Guy and Dave for reviewing; and they definitely should\'
have had at least one person sit down and try to design a starship with the
galleys.

You can convert FFS sensors to the new scale (see part 3 of the
DSR). I would say most THUDD people should at least do that for kicks.
On the other hand, the prices and sizes for a given sensitivity do
vary from FFS to FFS2...it\'s more "honest" to use FFS2 (If you have it)
or my sensor packages (if you\'re using QSDS/SSDS) but it\'s ultimately
the THUDD organizers call. My main purpose was to let QSDS users
use the new sensor scale and options.

LIDAR and LADAR mean the same thing, but the new ones are certainly better; 
I think LIDAR performances were underrated in original FFS (they certainly
should have better perfomance than radar at even moderate tech levels.)
FFS2 does give you more LIDARS at a given tech level...I hadn\'t realized
how much worse the LIDARs in FFS1 were.

Yeah, I know, I\'m just being a geek :-)
 
> Your example of 1 + 10 would be:

Of course, but you\'d add up theenergy per unit time emitted and use
the power table in the rules to get the sig.  I never suggested that
you\'d add up the log sigs, just that you\'d add up the photons.  In
the case of hull radiators for something like a Scout ship (~150MW)
with a 2g drive (~100MW) we have something much different than 10+1.

Actually, we can assume that the exhaust is radiating the 100MW it
uses, and the hull radiators are taking up the 50MW slack, so we\'d
just look up the sig for 150MW.  The problem is that the exhaust is
harder to hide than energy lost with the radiators----add to this the
fact that the HEPlaR contains more than the 50MW a g it was given by
the PP, and I\'d say it would be at least fair to add them together
and check vs. 250MW.  In this case it won\'t matter, but in other
cases it might.  I tend to think it\'ll matter more for powered down
units really trying to have tight emission control. 

For play sake, it makes sense to assume the largest is the one used,
however, I agree with you there.  Otherwise you\'d have to keep track
of way too much.  Actually allowing HEPlaR sigs (in their log form)
to add makes sense too, since we know HEPlaR is really a fusion
rocket, and should be 100 times brighter :-)

Or you simply rule that auto enlistments only apply to first careers; that\'s 
the assumption I make in Beginnings. Nobles are an exception to that, and
I\'m thinking of possibly others, e.g. Scholars. What does the List think?

How much grav does it take to collapse matter to superdense?  Almost
white dwarf or evenneutron star level gravs.  This technology exists in
Traveller, at least for contained sourses of unimaginably high g,
according to the existence of these materials.

Anyone care to take a wag a the g level needed to collapse matter to
this state?

Wonderful! I highly recommend that you make this your second "milieu."

I think from the general level of interest on the list, you can see that
many Traveller players are interested in roleplaying in the IW era.

Some considerations you might take into account:

o Design the milieu to cover the entire period of the Interstellar Wars
  (-2408 to -2219 3I, or 2112 to 2301 A.D.), with the technology
  advancement bar listed alongside the timeline. That way, players and
  refs can determine what level the Vilani and Solomani would have
  achieved depending on what year they played in (e.g., -2398, Solomani
  achieve TL 11 with advent of the J-2 drive; -2280, Solomani achieve TL
  12 with advent of the J-3 drive, etc.)

o The types of warfare fought in each war.
    - 1st IW: Commerce raiding by corporate-sponsored ships, brushfire
              wars over small area.
    - 2nd IW: Continued commerce raiding and limited naval engagements
              with brand new Terran navy.
    etc.

o Alien races: One of the things this milieu potentially suffers from
  is a lack of alien races. Develop the Vegans so that they can be used
  in the IW milieu. As far as I can recall, there are very few significant
  alien races in the Solomani Rim, but the Vegans are definitely a standout
  who deserve more attention. Loren was recently involved in an email
  discussion about the Vegans with a couple of us on HIWG, so perhaps
  his interest is piqued!

o Space combat: If you\'re going to develop space combat in more detail
  for this milieu, please take a long look at TNE\'s Brilliant Lances. In a
  simplified form, this game could be by far the best Traveller starship
  combat system the game has ever seen.

I can\'t wait to see what you come up with!

Best,

On a slightly related topic, what kind of meson beam generator would
be necessary to replicate the ones used in the "UDH Project"?  Since
the ones in the project where moon-based, does this necessarily mean
that they would have to be extremely powerful?  Since damage wasn\'t
the intent of the meson guns used in the project, might you be able to
get away with a specially designed spinal mount?  Any ideas?

According to CT Book 3 that I have, on page 7 it is 2D-7+atmosphere, and on
page 12 it is 2D-7+size.
According to the CT Traveller Book it is 2D-7+atmosphere on page 82, and
2D-7+size on page 85.

According to MT Ref Manual, page 24, it is 2D-7+size.

So, NO it has NOT "ALWAYS been 2D6-7+Size until T4 came out."  This error
has been there since the beginning and just not been pointed out until now.

The compatibility is limited, unfortunately; in particular the new
sensors tend to occupy a lot more volume than old ones. (The other 
numbers are all within the same order of magnitude, at least - my
medium mil is three times as much power, 5 times the cost but half the
area of T4. Maybe I could tweak things to match T4 numbers a little
better (figure out what I can fit into the same area as the QSDS ones...)
(Is "Advanced Military a SSDS sensor? I don\'t own "Starships" so I
tried to match QSDS more.)

That would be fair enough - I\'m sure the jury will be capable of
mentally switching back and forth. You can always use a QSDS/SSDS
sensor and rate it on the new scale with the conversion rules...

(ahem)...

A wise old Master Sergeant once gave me this bit of wisdom.  
I thought I\'d share it with you all.  

In the Marines, the officers and enlisted are the first to hit the beach.  
In the Army, the officers and enlisted hold onto whatever the Marines have
conquered (excuse me, I meant to say "secured" :-).  
In the Navy, the officers and enlisted are aboard ship offshore, within
range of combat.  
In the Air Force, the enlisted escort the officers to the planes, salute
smartly as the officers take off to fly to the combat zone, and return to
the NCO Club to "guard the base."

<Bandwidth trimming>

I agree with Chris\' opinion that this would be a great second Millieu,
to potential for adventure is at one of it\'s peaks in Traveller history
at this time IMHO.

One point about space combat, however. Since Traveller has always been
one of the most inovative S.F. games I\'m surprised at the lack of role
playing rules for space comabt. Since High Guard (Hat\'s off please!) the
emphysis in Traveller has been on multi ship combat, even the turn
outline in T$ reflects this. Somewhere on the internet I\'ve seen role
playing rules for first person ship operation, and I assume, combat (I
lost the adress of the site, so if anyone has it please let me know!).
My point is that usually my players are all travelling in one ship. Wehn
combat occurs, I take on the role of one or more opposing ships. Now,
typically what happens is that the  most combat oriented of the players
takes control of the player\'s ship and we two duke it out. The other
players kibitz or drift into the other room to watch the tube. When the
combat is done, they come back, sometimes reluctantly if a good movie
was on, adjust their characters for damage and pick the game back up.
For this reason, I\'ve virtually stopped using ship to ship encounters at
all, (sadly since a good customs boarding can be fun, but I don\'t want
possible combat to drag down the game).

Has anyone else seen this problem ?
What have you done to correct it?
What are the chances of seeing a good set of first person ship operation
and combat rules for T$ in the future?
I\'ve recently began to think about Fasa\'s old (gasp!) Star Trek rules,
which I think used First person ship operations. Now if I still have
that book around....

Hello,
  It sounds like this sort of situation is easily resolved in the
structure of the Imperium, at least in the long-term. Neither world
will be allowed to control the agri-world, as the trend to mercantilism
and mini-empires harms the Imperium. If trade is good for the 3I then 
any major world having true captive markets or directly controlled
reource worlds undercuts the revenue of the 3I, those planets loyalty
to it, and reduces the flexibility of the entire surrounding community
of trading worlds.

  This hardly begins to touch on the potential security threat of such
local hegemonies, especially as they may clash with each other, and
some will very likely develop their own expansionist tendencies. One
item that would need clarification is the Imperiums view of indirectly
controlled worlds, especially if used as pawns in a tradewar.

  Anyways, starvation hardly seems likely for a world with exports;
buy, borrow, and import. If economics drives everything, then while
finding a way to profit from a situation may be difficult, it is
rarely impossible.

I live in Boston and am from Texas.  In Boston I\'m a redneck.  In Dallas I\'m a Yankee.
To call all US Yanks is a major insult to Suth\'ners.  I\'d watch it aroud
them.  Remember those crackers shot first.

BTW:  Left-coasters are referred to as various things that make up trail
mix: nuts and fruit (although the latter is much less common these days)
as well as freaks, weirdos, etc..

So, in sum, we\'ve got (for the white population anyway)

Yankees - Northeast-Mid-Atlantic States

Crackers - Deep South, ex-Confederacy

Rednecks - Plains States and Southwest (may include Texas, which is
separated from  the Crackers by Hillbillies and Cajuns, although Texans
are virtually their own category)

Hillbillies - From the Ozarks of Arkansas and Missouri to the
Appalachians

Cajuns - (Descendant\'s of French Canadians I think) A world unto
themselves

Assorted Nuts - West Coast

(Crackers, Rednecks and Hillbillies can be collectively referred to as
Hicks - which can also used for anyone from rural areas through out the
US, but in this usage it is mutually exclusive with Yank.  For a non-US
to refer to an Okie as a Redneck Yank would be fine, but to call him a
Hick Yank wouldn\'t make much sense)

Thus, the simplest three categories would be Yanks, Hicks and Weirdos.

Harold, you have interesting & useful things to say about Traveller, but
please cut the politics.  I disagree very strongly with almost everything
you have said, but I am (with effort) avoiding responding to it, because I
don\'t want to embroil the TML in only of the many internet
Libertarian&Guns flamewars.  *Please* take this to email. 

For the record, not all US citizens approve of militias or oppose strict
gun control.

   Mr. Wallace was an Alabama man.  I do recall an incident during the
Kennedy Administration when the National Guard was called out in a state
(Mississippi I think) to prevent a black woman from attending what had
been an all-white college.  President Kennedy promptly nationalized the
troops (as was his perogative as Commander-in-Chief) and brought them
under Federal control.

   True enough, localized incidents involving state National Guard units
have taken place, but when the Federal government intervened, the
National Guard yielded to Federal authorities.

   I believe you are referring to the issue of unfunded mandates (the
Federal government forces states to institute programs and then provides
no funding for them).  While that is of questionable constitutionality,
the Supreme Court had no problem with the Federal government forcing
states to enact laws (i.e. the 21 drinking age) by threating to withold
Federal funds.

>Something about the 10th Ammendment I believe....

   This amendment, like the others (particularly the 1st and 2nd) have
had numerous interpretations and re-interpretations applied to them. 
Today, the Federal government has a broad range of powers (no small
thanks to Bill Clinton) that allow them to seize control of your
property without compenstation in the name of "The War On Drugs", the
"wetlands" or whatever excuse some bureaucrat can think up.

   And who was it that fired upon the Federal garrison at Fort Sumter? 
Who seized Federal arsenals and other Federal property for the purpose
of making war against the central government?  That\'s *sedition*, and
reason enough for Federal authorities to bring full military force to
bear against those committing the aggressions.  Claims that the 10th
admendment makes it all OK ring hollow in the face of criminal (some
would argue treasonous) activities.

   The Constitution of the U.S. in *no way* guarantees the right of any
state to nullify Federal laws within their particular boundaries, nor
does it grant the right to any state to secede, period.

   Of course no such text exists, but that doesn\'t mean that the 10th
admendment therefore applies either.  It was *never* the intention of
Madison, Jefferson, Washington, et al. that any state have the ability
to pull out from the union just because things weren\'t going their way. 
The Constitution was suppose to provide for a *stronger* central
government, not a *weaker* one.

   Born in Kentucky (as was Lincoln and Davis, the leaders of the North
and South during the Civil War), and raised in Ohio.  While I respect
men such as Lee, Stuart, Jackson, Longstreet, et al., at the same time I
recognise that the cause they fought for was in support of slavery and
the ultimate division of the United States.  Those ideas could not
allowed to win out in the end.

   Something goes terribly wrong with the public perception of the
Imperial government by 1116, otherwise Dulinor would have been hunted
down and killed for his actions against Strephon.

Then there\'s them what falls somewhere in the middle.  Imagine my
surprise after joining the (US)Navy and finding out I was a southern
midwestern yankee who came from out west back east depending on who I
was talking to.  (Shame on me!  I mean, \'to whom I was talking.\' ;-) ) 
I spent a few months in Idaho and found out that anything east of the
Mississippi is considered the east coast.  Funny how point of view
changes things.  Then we got to Scotland, and the bartender says he
can\'t detect a difference between my accent and that of my Texan friend,
who _did_ have a well-developed drawl.  Of course, that third pint may
have blurred things a bit :).

I always found it amusing that a Marine considers it an insult to talk
about the Navy carrying them places to do the fighting.  Personally, I
rather preferred it that way.  That\'s one reason I _like_ Marines.  To
say nothing of respecting them.  (Just don\'t let that last bit get out

Now that has a certain charm.  Send the officers off to fight the war. 
To bad it couldn\'t be the officers and enlisted sending the politicians
off to fight it.

Ah, yes.  Like the sonar and nav equipment spaces on the boat, where
they had to where sweaters on watch, and still took showers before and
after watch, leaving no hot water for those of us who worked in the
80-degree plus engine room.  And yes, I\'ll have a bit of cheese with
that whine.  A nice Brie, perhaps. ;)

Oh, yes Traveller.  Well, to secure the building, the SCOUTS would
investigate from a distance, interdict the area to minimize disturbance,
and perform an in-depth analysis of the political and economic
ramifications of admitting it to the Imperium.

Specifically, I think you\'ll find that the above is true *if* you\'re

Outside of the US the distinction is blurred and \'yank\' *tends* to
generically mean \'American\'.


"Most People" (?) know, however, that it\'s mildly derogatory in the same
way that calling an Englishman a \'limey\' (or indeed a \'whinging pom\') is.

I can supply a dictionary reference that says just this if anyone really
cares.  But it\'s certainly been my experience Travelling some 30 odd
countries.

Whoa, surely ex-Rogues could become sojer boys (if only via the "join
up or get a nice wardrobe with pretty arrows on it" variety of draft,
or even the normal variety now I think of it) and certainly become
agents (eg. the Stainless Steel Rat)?

Transfer to the Noble career sounds excellent, although presumably
those who gain their patents as a result of service or achievment
would be expected to continue to do their Emperor proud?

A more realistic (but more complicated) method may be to have
unfavourable enlistment modifiers between some careers, eg. a Noble
finds it harder to become a Rogue than to become a Scholar.  Its very
hard to see that any career could be absolutely barred on the basis of
a previous career.

factions of the UN/some Terran Nations or factions therein were
actively trying to negotiate a peaceful settlement with Vland, there
were Hawks who provoked the war (or maybe reacted strongly to Vilani
provocation).  The cited reasons included "stalling" by Vilani, which
of course the Vilani would view as being cautious.

I\'ll see if I can dig out my copy of the adventure tonight.

I seem to recall AM8 saying that the meson beams were being used to
communicate with the probes - although a stellar atmosphere they may
still need to be relatively powerful.  Also, the experimenters weren\'t
intending to set it off "it just went off in me hand, your honour", so
perhaps the Darrian Confederation either want to make sure, or want to
impress, or assumed that a powerful meson beam is needed.

Traveller ship design rules you really can\'t duplicate a ship like that at

  Based on my fiddles several months ago with low tech SDBs, designed as
opponents for the Merc and Patrol Cruiser THUDDDs, TL10 SDBs should be
larger, esp. if they are going to use anything but missiles.  TL10 sensors
are expensive, and it only makes sense to wrap those sensors with more
armor and firepower, at least in my opinion.  YMMV, of course.

Can anyone tell me the typical size of a normal field-stretcher?  I
could have a good guess, but I\'d like to get a correct answer.  The
reason I ask is that I\'m writng up a Trav description of an LSTAT,
which is a life support and trauma unit for use on the battlefield,
and is described in the New Scientist article I read about it in as
"the same length and width as a normal stretcher" which isn\'t very
precise.  Basically, you pop your casualty on this thing, plug them
in, and it provides early stabilisation and life support on the way
back from the front.

Please use direct email to reply, unless you have info which may
interest the list as a whole (ie. more than just the stretcher
dimensions).

Well it is not actual proof per se but a few months ago on the list we
were talking about the fact that Sumer must have been a lost Vilani
colony or Vilani names would not sound Sumerian.

Some list members presumably have Summerian anscestors and are therefore
_not_ 100% Solomani.  However since we have not yet realized the extent
of the Vilani colonization & infiltration of our fair planet this will
be hard to prove, thus the tabloids are not offering me any money.  :(

I think the tabloids would use a title somthing like "Romans from Outer
Space ! - since their audience has not heard of Summerians but may have
heard of Romans, if only from old movies.

In M -25C, there isn\'t one -- but there hasn\'t been much 
interbreeding, so by and large Solomani communities are wholly 
Solomani, tho\' decreasingly so with time and distance from Terra.

In M1100, since the Solomani party is rather Nazi-like in its views 
on race, it\'s not unreasonable for 1 Vilani grandparent to make you 
non-pure Solomani.  Perhaps 1 Solomani grandparent makes you 
noticably and acceptably Solomani.

[Sarcasm mode on !]

No anything east of the _Rocky Mountains_ is the east.  Of course none
of these distinctions you are talking about really matter. The only
distinction that really counts in US politics is that between Alaska and
the Lower 48 [The 48 contiguous US states- Hawaii does not count].  I
forget what the official motto of the state is but I can assure you that
the unofficial motto of the State of Alaska is

 "We don\'t give a da** about what they do in the lower 48."  

Similarly anything below 55 degrees north is the south and Canada is the
country to the southeast of the United States. :)

What makes you think, that we have a true understanding of what they are now?
We only really know how they act in certain circumstances.

The Sixth Interstellar War (2221AD to 2231AD)
The 6th War opened with a Vilani attempt to outflank the Terrans. Their
initial offensive was launched from the Vega subsector using a deep space
refueling depot to extend the range of their fleet, enabling them to attack
Lagash directly from Shulgiasu. This strategy did catch the Terrans off
guard, who had expected any attack to fall in the Dingir Subsector. Lagash
fell in late 2221AD, but the Vilani strategy proved to be deeply flawed. The
Vilani attempted to push on toward Ishimshulgi and Nusku, but their supply
lines were totally dependent on the deep space depot and they could never
gather sufficent forces to reduce Ishimshulgi, and in 2223AD the Terrans
forced them back to Lagash. Lagash was to prove to be a weaping sore in the
Vilani war effort during the 6th War. The Terrans never made a concerted
effort to retake the world, but were well contented to just bleed off Vilani
strength as they tried to hold. Eventually the Vilani recognised the futility
of this front and in 2228AD they withdrew from Lagash.
However, in the meantime, events had not remained static on other fronts. In
2224AD the Terrans launched an offensive into the Dingir Subsector. This
offensive was aimed directly at the Vilani provincial capital at Gashidda.
Shuruppak and Enki Kalamma both fell in 2224AD and the Terran gathered their
strength for an assault on Gashidda itself. The Siege of Gashidda lasted for
most of 2225AD and into 2226AD before the world finally fell to the Terrans,
but not before the Terrans had suffered significant losses. With Gashidda
secured, the Terrans drove deeper into Vilani territory. Shilgiili and
Kinunir fell in 2227AD, and Shulgi and Meshan in 2228AD. However with the
Vilani withdrawl from Lagash in 2228AD, they were able to significantly
reinforce the Dingir front in late 2228AD. The overstretched Terrans were
unable to hold their gains and by 2230AD the Vilani had retaken Shilgiili,
Kinunir and Shulgi. By this stage the war had taken a heavy toll on both
sides and the more moderate elements in both camps were calling for a peace
treaty. A treaty was negotiated in 2231AD with the Terrans retaining Enki
Kalamma, Shuruppak, and Meshan; and the Vilani regaining Gashidda.

Seventh Interstellar War (2237AD to 2244AD)
The end of the 6th War proved to be only a brief respite as both sides
furiously rebuilt their strength. The period between the 6th and 7th Wars
was more like an uneasy truce than a time of peace. Both sides engaged in
frequent raids and there were numerous skirmishes during this period. In
2237AD the expected 7th War finally started. The opening move was a Vilani
attack on Enki Kalamma. The world fell in late 2237AD and the Vilani drove on
to Shuruppak, which fell in 2238AD. Iilike was the next Vilani target. By
this stage however, the Terran defence was starting to stiffen significantly.
Iilike held until 2239AD when the Vilani abandoned the siege to meet a Terran
offensive towards Apishal. Apishal and Zaggisi fell to the Terrans in 2239AD.
From there the Terrans drove on to Karkhar with the aim of reopening a link
to Meshan. Karkhar fell in 2240AD, but by now the Vilani had transfered
enough forces to hold the line. However they did not anticipate the rate at
which the Terrans could shift the weight of their offensive and in 2241AD the
Terrans were on the offensive again using Iilike as a base. Faced with
presure on two front and with the Terran technological advantage becoming
quite marked by now, the Vilani buckled. In 2242AD the Terrans retook
Shuruppak, Enki Kalamma and Shilgiili. The Terrans had finally learnt the
leasons of the 5th and 6th Wars and were careful not to overextend themselves
again. The war settled down to another prolonged attritional struggle were
the traditional Terran commerce raiding tactics wore down the Vilani will to
continue the war. The war was to drag on like this for another 2 years before
the Vilani finally yelded and ceded the trailing half of the Dingir Subsector
to the Terrans in 2244AD.

Eighth Interstellar War (2266AD to 2269AD)
The 7th War was followed by the so called "Long Peace". Both sides had been
heavily drained by the efforts of the 6th and 7th Wars; and neither was keen
to renew hostilities quickly. However, this lengthy period of peace was to
favour the Terrans far more than the Vilani. With the relative stability of
the Long Peace. Substaintial colonies were established to rimward, the former
Vilani worlds were absorbed into the mainstream of the Confederation and most
importantly; industry was rationalised and the technological advances of the
previous 150 years fully utilised for the first time.
Finally however the 8th War came in 2266AD. The war opened with a Vilani
attack on Karkhar. The attack proved to be misjudged. The Terran defences
were far stronger than the Vilani had anticipated and the Vilani forces were
badly lead. In 2267AD the Terrans launched their counter-offensive. Shulgi and
Kinunir fell quickly in 2267AD. Launching a faint towards Gashidda, the
Terrans turned and siezed Dingir in 2267AD. This threw the Vilani into
confusion; and provided the opportunity for Admiral Albadawi to launch his
master plan. He gambled on the Vilani being unable to react to the change in
Terran focus quickly and moved to seize and fortify Enulsur (now Oudh). Taking
possibly the biggest gamble of the wars, he took the bulk of the Terran fleet
and in 2268AD he reduced Gaea, Tonopah and Duriim. This maneuver totally
outflanked the Vilani and left their entire fleet cut off and stranded at
Gashidda. The Vilani tried franticlly to break out of this pocket, but the
Terran line held and in 2269 the virtually the entire Vilani provincial fleet
surrendered. In the subsequent Treaty of Enulsur, the Vilani surrendered all
territory rimward of Vega to the Terrans.

Ninth Interstellar War (2274AD to 2280AD)
With the crushing defeat in the 8th War, the Vilani central government finally
took notice. Substainial forces were dispatched to the Rim and preperations
were made to put an end to the Terran menace once and for all. However the
Terrans struck first. Utilising their newly developed jump 3 drives (deployed
experimentally in limited numbers at the end of the 8th War), the Terrans
totally outflanked the Vilani forward positions and destroyed the Vilani fleet
in detail. The Vilani were thrown into a panic; the provincial forces, already
demoralised after the 8th War disintergrated and collapsed, whilst the newly
arrived central forces were totally at a loss to cope with the deep penetration
and raiding tactics of the Terrans. By 2278AD the Vilani were in full retreat.
The newly developed Terran meson guns further added to the Vilani collapse and
the retreat turned into a rout. By 2279AD the Terrans had driven the Vilani
from the Sector. However the Terran Confederation government was by now
concerned at the rate of advance, with the forwards elements of their forces
being virtually out of control. In 2280AD the Confederation government called
a halt to the offensive and announced they were ready to bring an end to
hostilities. The Vilani were by now desperate and gladly accepted the
opportunity for a respite and in 2280AD ceded the entire Sector to the Terrans.

Nth Interstellar Wars (2283AD to 2299AD)
The Confederation\'s fears about maintaining control of it\'s forces proved to
be well founded. In 2283AD a minor incident on the frontier sparked the
beginning of the Nth Wars. Intially the Confederation only intended to use the
opportunity to seize a few strategic border worlds to secure the frontier.
However the time delay between the front and central command prevented the
government from ever gaining control of the fleet. As the Vilani collapsed in
front of the advancing Terrans, local commanders were constantly presented
with opportunities too good to ignore. Many historians have commented on the
fact that it took the Terrans 16 years to finally defeat the Vilani was more
due to the fact that the Terrans could not keep up with the rout more than
any resistance from the Vilani. The entire period of the Nth Wars is
confusing; to all intents and purposes the Ziru Sirka had ceased to exist by
around 2287AD. The bulk of the Nth War were fought by local Vilani commanders
and worlds with little or no reference or support from their higher government.
On the Terran side the continually lengthening lines of communications
prevented the Confederation from exercising effective control of their forces.
The setting of the end of the Nth Wars is a purely arbitary date based on the
surrender of the Ishimkarun at Vland on 14th September 2299AD. In fact the
fighting continued for at least four years after this date as some Vilani
continued fighting either from a sense of honor, denying the inevitable, or
simply because they did not know the Wars were over. However by 2303AD the
Wars were over and the Terran Confederation was left in control of the Vilani
Empire.

Ok max(log10(150),log10(100)) = max(2,2) = 2
Or log10(150+100) = 2
More or less the same (given another logscale things would be different)

I use the following for calculating thruster sigs:
Chemical: Tons of thrust x 10 = Equivalent MW
Fission: Tons of thrust x 100 = Equivalent MW
Fusion: Tons of thrust x 1000 = Equivalent MW

In the above logscales this is the same as
+1 for chemical, +2 for fission and +3 for fusion/Heplar

Maybe I\'m just being naive, but would the mdrive actually radiate it\'s full
output?  Seems to me that some large prtion of the energy output from the
power plant to the mdrive goes into propelling the vessel.  It\'s only the
"leaking" energy that has to be radiated, right?  Not that it takes much
energy to radiate like a lightbulb in a dark room, but It seems like you\'re
throwing around 100% of the PP or mdrive output.

Correct me, I know I\'m probably wrong/came in too late.

I\'ve been playing with short range lasers (about 10 000 km combat ranges)
with good effects. You could really build 50 kg missiles that work on those
ranges, even chemical (remember that CT canon has missiles massing 50 kg).
No need for gravfocussing either and space battles where dodging behind
planets, slingshotting with gravity, aerobraking etc really worked. The
problem was that Bruce calculated realistic detection ranges for sensors
and shot this scenario to hell (at least if you want sensor ranges on par
with shooting ranges).
Now I\'m working on a rewrite of my spacecombat system with longer ranges
(100 000 km typical shooting ranges) and using much shorter wavelength
light (x-ray etc) to still avoid those pesky gravfocussing abominations.
OK, you\'ll need one set of lasers for atmospheric work as the air absorbs
the x-rays too much but that I consider good as well (no PCs will a
civilian merchant terrorizing some government with their good-of-thunder
lasers in atmosphere).

	The fact that Western Australia voted 75% to separate in a
referendum on the subject held back in the 1930\'s occasionally gets
mentioned up here.  Of course, the constitutional situation was and is
quite different, but it\'s an interesting little precedent.

I think someone already mentioned, but, I\'ll mention again: and a polite
request it is. 

However, the chances of getting a Canadian to stop talking about the
Quebec situation are about as high as convincing a bunch of Orangemen
to give up their parades. It is some sort of bizzare, masochistic
failing that\'s inside all of us.

Anyways, it is perhaps more interesting to look at Quebec and contemplate
why it is part of Canada in the first place. Quebec has (and I\'m sure
I\'ll be corrected if I\'m wrong):

 - it\'s own set of laws, using a civil code instead of a common law code
    like the rest of Canada has
 - it\'s own set of immigration laws
 - it\'s own parliment, which passes laws independently of the federal
    government
 - it\'s own retirement fund/pension plan, which the separatist gv\'mt
    uses to play games with the Canadian dollar (well, only once)
 - it\'s own set of culture laws, even more strict, and bizzare than
    Canada\'s national culture laws
 - it\'s own (inept) para-military force, which I don\'t think other
    provinces have
 - even worse drivers than Toronto and bizzare no-right-turn-on-red-light
    rules

and other things that I\'m not aware of probably.

At any rate, the only things that Quebec shares with the rest of Canada
are the dollar, the Canadian passport and a general dislike of weak
American beer. By all rights, it should be a different country already.

   Hmmm.  Japan may wind up being less of a power when the other Asian
   Tigers begin competing with it ---- unless it re-establishes its
   empire.  I\'d put my long-term money on resource-rich Indonesia and
   Malaysia, and possibly China as you point out.  When Russia stops
   falling apart I suspect it will really take off;  Siberia may be THE
   wild frontier and land of oportunity for the 21st century.  Barring
   WWIII Europe will certainly be a world power (when has it not been in
   the last two millenia?) either as a polity or as amalgam of
   independent states.  If India ever modernizes its infrastructure (it
   may be able to if it has a whole century) it may just become the most
   powerful country in the world.  Brazil is getting stronger every day; 
   in a century it may be the dominant power of the western hemisphere.
   And don\'t forget `Arabia\', if it ever unites. (Hey, it happened
   before and with little warning!)  The US will probably still be a
   force to be reckoned with unless it falls apart (which could happen
   very quickly ---- compare the rhetoric of the southern state
   governments when they seceeded with the rhetoric they used a mere ten
   years earlier when many were swearing to `perpetually vernerate the
   sanctity of the Union\').

   But of course, the possibility of political instability makes all
   these predictions mere guesses.  A lot can happen in a century.
   Heck, a lot can happen in a decade!

Darn! All this time, I\'ve been seething with ideas for an Interstellar
Wars/Rule of Man type Milieu supplement and now the cat is out of the bag...
oh well. Here\'s some of the ideas that had been dancing around in my head:

 - profile the Vilani and some major worlds in the area, to give the 
   players some idea of what purely Vilani run worlds are like
 - lots of info on the Vegans, who with the advent of Interstellar Wars,
   shrug off their Vilani overlords and become a major force in the
   area and a signifigant Terran ally.
 - a description of how Terra has changed in the last hundred years,
   going from being the rulers of the universe to being just another
   human race - this revelation alone will change Terran society 
   immensely
 - a description of the Terran Navy - during the period of the Interstellar
   Wars, there would be very little "civilian" space traffic, as least 
   from Terra. Chances are that all Terran jump-capable ships are
   Naval vessels and that civilians have to charter space on them for
   cargo, passage, etc. (Makes a good plot hook for getting civilians
   into those tight spots they have no place being...)
 - a description of some of the new Terran colonies - no doubt some of the
   larger ones are going to try to push away from the distant
   Terran rule...

I also envisioned a sample campaign setting, a large Vilani highport
on a conquered world (this is more towards the end of the Nth Interstellar
War, on the cusp of the declaration of the Rule of Man by Estigarribia)
to which the Pc\'s are assigned as high-level commanding officers, in
spite of the fact that they\'re all, oh, you know, about 25 and fresh
out of the Naval Academy... of course, this has lots of options for
all types of characters. (It\'s kind of Deep-Space-9-ish, but only in
the sense that the campaign would take palce primarily on the station,
as opposed to on a ship travelling between systems, like most Traveller
campaigns seem to).

Anyways, if you\'re interested Marc, I\'d love to help out or contribute in
some way to the project. And never fear - if you don\'t need or want
help, I\'m too busy to bother to sue you. ;)

Go read a book, called (I believe) Quantum Electrodynamics, by Richard
Feynmann. It is a series of lectures, allegedly aimed toward the lay
public (ghod how we have fallen) written in the late 50\', early 60\'s,
which explains chemistry from quantum mechanincs, and it matches
perfectly. A number of people have gotten Nobel Prizes for their work in
determining exactly how chemistry works. 

Chemistry, we understand perfectly well, _if we have knowledge of the
exact conditions pertaining_, and we\'re gainng on knowing what happens
when we don\'t know them all the time.

I couldn\'t do it now, but once upon a time I could tell you precisely and
mathematically what happens when you mix oxygen, hydrogen and a spark.

Should be "Military".  I\'m using Andrew Akins SSDS template, so it should
be standard.

Here\'s his table entry (mass omitted for comparison sake);

TL    Vol	Area Power  Price	Crew(mx)	Crew(el)
	Rating	       MinLength
10  143.8	 554  413.9  248.91	  0.41	   11	A10 P4 J10          0

One thing to mention, I think Andrew has lumped the communications package
into this as well.

Let me find one close to the new table you provided;

I\'d prefer Mil Picket (good descriptive names btw);
TL   Vol	 Area   Power  Price	  Crew(mx)		Rating
10   629     96     111.2  1605      3       A11.5, P14FS, P13.5T, L14.5,
JA12, JP13.5

Ok, this will save on power and area (area doesn\'t matter to me on this
design one bit),  dropping 300MW of power will save space and crew to some
extent.  The price though is 6.4 times the price I had.  This is quite
significant.  I\'m not sure, but I think crew requirement has increased as
well, and that implies a lot of extra space needed for their needs,
probably more thanthe savings in PP volume.

Lets try Medium Mil - oops, cant use it due to the 1000 ton min hull! (my
submission is 700 tons)

Ok, SmallMil still has active jammers, lets try that;

No passive jammers?  seems a bit silly to have active jamming but not passive.

Anyway, this component much smaller than the "standard" SSDS one I picked,
uses 1/60th the power, and costs half as much. I feel like I\'ve got the
wrong sensor here; is it as capable?  the A, P, and L ratings are
comparable, but what about the J rating?  No passive jammers, but otherwise
similar.  Are the values actually comparable though?

In fact, the main difference between the small mil and the mil picket seems
to be that the mil picket has to deploy a folding array to do passive scans
and the small mil doesn\'t.  for that and the passive jammer the mil picket
pays over 100MW in power, over 500m^3 in space (35 tons!!!) and almost 1500
Mcr in price!  Oh, and they get half a factor additional passive scan (but
only with the folded array open) and a full factor better active jammer (is
this really a significant impact?).

What am I missing?

by the way, I do not mean, in any of this, to demean or be critical of all
the work that has gone into this.  I am sure I am missing something and I\'m
just running through my logic to make it possible to poke holes in it.  I
appreciate the feedback loop.

began wandering onto things traveller...

1. I have read that Vet\'s don\'t recommend feeding chocolate to dogs, because
    it as a strong narcotic effect on canine brains(similar to cocaine 
on human brains)

    This got me wondering, if Vargr have the same sensitivity to chocolate
     as their distant biological cousins,  does this mean that chocolate is
     a dangerous narcotic menace on Vargr worlds?  Visions of Heroic(or Corrupt)
     Chocolate Interdiction Task Force agents battling  the nefarious chocolate
     smugglers from the infamous Mother See\'s and Hershey\'s chocolate cartels                 abound. Every ship from human space is a 
potential menace in the struggle to keep Vargr worlds safe from the scourge of  chocolate addiction.

2. 	That also ead to the interesting idea, that there is a significant 
part of the solomani
      population that would never VOLUNTARILY  leave earth to colonize 
new worlds light years away, unless it was proved to their 
satisfaction, that either a frequent supply ship is going to be 
bringing the chocolate around, or they were shown the carefully
packed cocoa bean plants in the hold, along with the other terrestrial 
crops being
shipped.

Then it hit me, that there would also be those who would demand to see the coffee
bean plants, and those who would want to check out the brewing/distilling equipment
in the hold before they would ever agree to go find their berth for 
take off.

So the question is folks,  what vital cargoes are going to be needed to be shipped
before billions of solomani voluntarily leave Terra, for "uncivilized" places like
sylea, alderbaran, home, dingir and other places...

(Sure, I will emigrate  to Dingir! I just need to  travel in the liner(first class please) and
you can ship all the stuff I\'ll need in a  cargo ship dedicated just for me and you can

This would be an excellent Milieu, and I second the motion for a source
book.  However, I think that the Canadian Civil War (known to
francophones as La Guerre entre Quebec et Canada) has to be included. 
Maybe the colony Nouveau Quebec is in danger of falling to the Vilani
and France and les Puissances Anglophones (USA, Britain, Australia) have
to cooperate to save it from alien invasion -- until they can get back
to their own warfare.  Or maybe the real danger is that Nouveau Quebec
wants to secede from the Terran Empire (er, confederation, sorry) and is
willing to take Vilani help to do it.  Hmm -- lots of possibilities
here.

Thanks, Mark -- that was exactly my thinking in going to the 500-1000 dt
range for this THUDDD, but I hadn\'t gotten the chance to lay out my case.
I\'m actually pretty sure that the \'optimum\' displacement without price
constraints for a TL-10 SDB is more in the 2-3000 dt range, but as this
THUDDD is aimed at an impoverished PE, I moved the range down accordingly.

Actually, I suspect it would take a lot less, given that degenerate matter
and neutronium are both far, far more dense that superdense.  Superdense is
only a factor of 2-3 denser than plain steel, right?

Note - center of the earth pressures are sufficient to compress matter to
more than double its normal density, I heard once, but I have no references
for that.  References appreciated, or counter examples.

>Anyone care to take a wag a the g level needed to collapse matter to
>this state?

Would a short 100G pulse do it?  IIRC, the pressure at the earth\'s core is
in the tons/in^2, which seems in line with thousands of gees.

Ah. I shall investigate. I\'ve nearly finished Duke Nukem 3D, so I\'ll

Well, this is cheating because I saw it on a .sig on this list (or
gdw-beta), but IIRC, his initials were A.H.  His second prediction was
certainly correct, and it looks like the third one may also be. :-(  The
first prediction could, I suppose, be taken as a POV issue.

If you do the numbers, a huge amount of waste heat shows up in chemical
or fusion rocket exhausts compared to the kinetic energy that goes into
the spacecraft - and (paradoxically) the waste heat to kinetic energy
in spacecraft gets much higher as the exhaust velocity inreases (which
corresponds to decreasing Traveller fuel consumption values.)

Basically, if you have a spacecraft of mass M and rocket exhaust (in a unit
time) of mass m, with velocities V and v respectively, starting from rest,   
the changes in momentum have to balance

                MV=mv

This means that if M>>m (an efficient rocket), V<<v. Since the kinetic energy
of the two components is 1/2MV^2 and 1/2mv^2, the kinetic energy of the 
exhaust is much higher than that of the spacecraft.

>Crackers - Deep South, ex-Confederacy

Cracker comes from "Sand Cracker" and refered to poor dirt farmers that
attempted to scratch out a living by "cracking the sandy soil" down in the
hollers between the hills and throughout the pine barrens.  

>Rednecks - Plains States and Southwest (may include Texas, which is

>are virtually their own category)

Redneck came from the sunburned color of their necks. These were the poor
working class that worked outside all day. It is applied throughout the
southern part of the US from the Atlantic down to the Gulf and across to
the lower classes of California.  Today it refers, primarily, to bigots,
the overtly violent and the slovenly poor. The stereotypical redneck is any
big, dumb Hollywood heavy with a southern accent.

>Hillbillies - From the Ozarks of Arkansas and Missouri to the Appalachians

Also to the Smoky Mountain areas of Alabama, Tennesee, Georgia and North
Carolina. Hillbillie refered to males originally, as in "billy goat", but
very few references were made to Hillbelles and it became generic for both
sexes.  The stereotypical hillbilly family really *is* the "Beverly
Hillbillies."  The stereotypical hillbilly that made good is Dolly Parton.
The stereotypical hillbilly villains can be found in "Deliverance."
 
>Cajuns - (Descendant\'s of French Canadians I think) A world unto
>themselves

Correct, the displaced Arcadians. Read all about them in Longfellow\'s poem,
"Evangiline."  Cajuns were settled in southern and central Lousisana, and
that\'s where you\'ll find most of them today.  Their music, speech and
culture is still similar in many ways with rural Quebec.  A representive of
cajuns is Justine Wilson (he\'s only an honorary cajun, though ;-). 

In case you don\'t realise it, all these terms are generally considered
insults (except Cajun, of course).  Mountain folk wouldn\'t refer to
themselves as hillbillies, nor would poor whites call themselves crackers.
As for rednecks..well, if you *are* one then you\'re too stupid (or drunk)
to care what anybody calls you, and if you aren\'t "them\'s fighting words."

>[various questions boiling down to comparing the sizes of old and new
>sensors]

>What am I missing?
There are a bunch of complications - some unfortunate, some unavoidable.

The first thing to remember (when comparing one of my sensor sets to another)
is that because of the log scale a difference of 0.5 in sensitivity is a 
factor of 3 in range - so the mil picket has three times the effective range
of the small mil, due to its huge folding array. Unfortuntately, fundemental
physics means that to see 3 times further away you need a sensor ten times
bigger in area...Most of the rest of the difference is the power for the active
jammer (which maybe I should have made smaller) and the passive jammer (which
is a real power hog.)

The second thing is that the sensors then span a huge range in size; my main
goal was to have sensors that went from missile-sized to just-barely-fits-on-
the Tigress. Combined with the coarse range scale Marc chose for T4.1, and
the need to not have the tables get to big, this results in big jumps from
one sensor to the next.

The third thing is that the conversions to FFS are hard to make perfect. 
I pegged them by making looking at the sensor sizes in FFS and figuring out
what that amount of surface area buys you in my sensor system. Since the
volume per surface area, mass per surface area, cost per SA, and power per
SA are all different in FFS, it was somewhat hard to match things perfectly.

I matched things at TL12. Unfortunately, in FFS, sensors get a lot 
smaller with tech level - more smaller than I could mentally justify,
for reasons too detailed to go into now (the readers digest version is that
even TL-8 sensors are already close to 
perfect, so I couldn\'t see how much better they could get.) That means that
at TLs below 12 FFS sensors tend to be bigger than mine for a given 
performance and above they tend to be smaller.  

The range scalings in FFS1 are really, really weird - I couldn\'t for the
understand what determines how sensor size increases with range - which 
complicates things also; a PEMS 5 and PEMS 6 in FFS get the same rating on
my scale even though the latter is 5 times large in area. 

So that\'s the story...conversions to old sensors are weird mostly because of the
TL effect and slightly because of the different mass/cost/price/surface/power
ratios. Some of this could have been improved with more (any) playtesting,
but FFS2 got little playetesting. The conversions will never be perfect
plug-ins. On the other hand, the new sensors are 100% guaranteed internally
consistent, and you really do get a bigger benifit than you might think
with the +0.5 the Mil Picket buys you for all your money.

(Crew requirements on the sensors might differ from SSDS because I couldn\'t
understand how to do crews - I just sort of guessed. Feel free to substitute
the old values.)

One last thing you mention:
>No passive jammers?  seems a bit silly to have active jamming but not passive.
That\'s mostly because it\'s a TL10 package. Passive jammers are generally only
good against lower-TL passive sensors and (like all jammers) no use at all
against higher TL opponents; I figured a TL10 pocket empire is unlikely to be
invaded by TL9 opponents, and should mostly be concerned with fighting 
TL10-12 - so wasting money on a passive jammer on most ships seemed
of limited use. The Picket got one because it\'s mostly for dedicated spy/recon
ships.

>(also BTW I won\'t be back \'til Monday to respond to any messages).
Unfortunately I\'ll be away from next tuesday (vacation) but I\'ll try to catch
up before I leave.

I am currently on a vacation from work (whatya callit??) and when i do

drawings on the starship "stormwind" will be updated soon with an excact

will have a complete console for every "command" and other "crew" console.

Tell me what formats you can handle, cause i can convert to great deal of

.dwg .dxf .gif .tiff .3ds .bmp .jpg .iff .wmf .sat .eps .dxx

Be aware that Dick Feynman was a genius physicist, Nobel laureate, and many
other things, but he was terrible at knowing the level of his audience.
The Feynman Lectures on Physics came out of his attempt to teach a group of
CalTech frosh their first physics class.  The lectures were meaty enough
that just about every grad student and professor showed up and profited,
but they lost most all of the freshmen very,very quickly.  He managed to
drag QM into something like the fourth or fifth lecture, though admittedly
in passing.  He was not wrong, mind, but it did pitch the class beyond the
sophistication of the group.

Do not get me wrong - I read them first as a frosh, and then again over the
following years, and learned a lot each time.  They were not impossible to
follow, just pitched very, very aggressively.  If I remember his QED book
properly, it was pitched even more aggressively, given that his target
audience was not Cal tech freshmen.

According to one of my Physics professors, who idolized Dr. Feynman, the
level of preparation of the students did not significantly change at
CalTech over that time, so it was not a sampling error.  Feynman was just a
very, very bright guy, who, I think, was never aware of just how much
brighter he was than the average bear.  Contrast with Freeman Dyson,
arguably of the same caliber, who could easily talk about exceedingly
complex topics at a level of sophistication appropriate for his audience.
I have heard both speak, and enjoyed both experiences tremendously, but
they did have somewhat different ways of approaching the world and
describing what they knew.

I would play it that Vargr _do_ have this same sensitivity.  This

what do you do for "drug laws" when a substance that is very evil
for some of your citizens is innocuous to others, and pleasurable

minor race around (say the Bwaps) to whom chocolate turns out to
be the most efficient way of providing them with a biological

Coffee, yes; distilling/brewing equipment, probably not - beer
and wine are essentially TL1 products; freeze distillation ditto;
heat distillation maybe TL3 or TL4.  Believe you me, if there\'s
no equipment for alcohol production shipped, they\'ll find it, or
scavenge it, from what they have that they "can do without for a
while".  It\'s also likely that if the biochemistry of the planet
is broadly terrestrial-compatible (i.e., at least as compatible
as Vland was), there will be something native to the planet that
will make a nice alcoholic beverage.

"Vital" was obviously intended to be in quotes, there... :)

H. Beam Piper suggested that coffee and tobacco would be in that
set; you\'ve suggested chocolate; I think there should also be
some sort of crop from which sugar could be produced - either
sugar maple trees (trees, not seeds; it takes too long for the
first crop to come in from seeds), sugar beets, or sugar cane.
It\'s possible that bees and terrestrial flowers would also be
sent along; honey is nice to have - it sweetens things nicely
as-is, crystallizes into sugar, and can be fermented into a quite
palatable alcoholic beverage (mead).

For a reaction drive, all of the output that isn\'t heat absorbed by
the drive machinery goes out the tailpipe.  The shhip goes forward
from conservation of momentum (the sum of the exhaust momentum and
ship is zero (0th order :-)

A reaction drive has fuel (burned to make energy (burned could be
"fused" in this case), and the reaction drive has propellant.  The
propellant is inert stuff thrown out the tailpipe.  More stuff,
bigger thrust----that\'s why ion drives with huge exhaust velocities
produce small thrusts, they throw very little material out the
nozzle.  Anyway, the propellant in HEPlaR has lots of kinetic energy
(ie: it\'s hot) so it radiates light (through various interesting
mechanisms, but IR will be well represented).

The bottom line is that much of the energy will end up as EM.
Compared to the input energy of HEPlaR, more will come out than was
put in since we know that the drive must produce more than the
energy put in in FFS to work.

This is probably true. However, 400t is still an interesting and useful
size for an SDB at any tech level. Their performance won\'t equal a TL-12
SDB, but could still be designed to pack a good punch in a small package.

I find the biggest problem is not in the cost of sensors, but in the size
of the power plant needed to power TL-10 thrusters. The fact that thruster
plates don\'t use up a lot of energy makes them quite a technological leap.
A high G-maneuverable SDB (i.e. 4 or more) needs one heck of a power plant
at TL-10, particularly if armoured and highly streamlined.

Once you cross the 500t barrier, crew size seems to also increase to the
point where you looking for spaces to put them in, especially when you have
such a huge power plant.

At least this is what my little experiments have revealed about a TL-10 SDB
so far.

Armament (lasers vs. missiles) is a whole other thorny issue. Depending on
the concept, it seems that missile racks are a good idea. Presumably, more
targets can be engaged at longer ranges with missiles, but is this
neccesarily the case? Starship combat experts may have something to say in
respect to this.

A little more offical clarification of First Imperium Vilani Culture.

Would a First Imperium Govenor have any reasons or motiviation to have a
clandestine operation several parsecs outside offical borders? One line of
adventures I had sketched out assumed that one or more factions in the First
Imperium\'s provincial government had justifications for unoffical and or
unsanctioned interference with the barbarians just a few jumps away.
Somewhat of a Traveller:Invaders or Traveller:UFO where PCs would be
involved in clandestine operations against unidentified aliens.

No. The reason that dogs can be harmed by chocolate is that one of the
components of cocoa beans, theophylline, is poorly metabolized by dogs. 
Theophylline has a <oh hell what is the name> heart-rate affecting
property. In short it can give them irregular heartbeats, and it kills
them by interrupting cardiac function. 

This will do the same thing to humans, but we metabolize it faster, so
it\'s in our bloodstream less time.

Secondly, small dogs especially are susceptible to it, because they can
get such a large dose, relative to their body weight. A small 10 lb dog
can easily glom down a pound of chocolate. This can kill them. A 75 pound
dog can do the same thing and just be mildly ill. A 200 lb human can do
that and think, "what a nice snack!".

However, if that human ate 20 lbs of chocolate, the theophylline in that
dose would definitely put you in the hospital cardiac unit.

_Then_ they\'d put you in the loony bin for stuffing 20 lbs of chocolate
down your gut;-)

Dunno for certain. One dog owner of my acquaintance says that of two dogs
surveyed (English translation: snuck a bite of a hershey bar while no one was
looking), one reacted to a small dose as a human given a large dose of
codeine (i.e. fell asleep immediately), the other got a protracted case of
the runs. I am given to understand that in many dogs, it can be fatal.

    'body' => 'Density and Toughness factors aside, I see the essential problem with
superdense materials as being the lack of a sustaining grav 
field.

Materials are largely what they are due to electron-electron repulsion
and interatomic/intermolecular quantum stability effects that result
in repulsion from unstable states and attraction to stable states.  

Ordinary matter is stable, but if you compress it using any sort of
force, such as a strong mechanical compresson (i.e. Journey to the Center
of the Earth), you\'ll get a counterforce resisting it attempting to
restore the stable state.  The stuff at the earth\'s core is dense only
under compression, but it will probably expand to normal density if
released from compression.

For gravitically fabricated superdense matter, there is therefore an
implicit assumption in Traveller of a metastable state between true 
degeneracy (white dwarf matter) and the normal stable state.  To my 
knowledge, there are no such states yet known and Traveller mentions 
no sustainer field for the SD materials.  Any comments or information 
to the contrary?

In other words, superdense material as a useful construction material is
not yet a plausible future technology (as are lasers, fusion, etc...).

My guess is that creation of such materials does require gravitic compression,
but also requires manipulation of the quantum manipulation of the material
matrix to stabilize it.

This soundss reminiscent of Bonded and Coherent SD technologies.

central corridor.  Emergency exit hatches are placed in the ceilings of the
cockpit and pasenger compartment.  A 16 m^3 cargo compartment, accessed by
a side-opening small cargo hatch, is emplaced aft of the passenger
compartment.  4 3.625 Mw MHD power plants are emplaced in the hull at the
base of the wing roots; fuel storage is along the underside of the hull.
Landing gear consist of 4 short retractable landing legs with sturdy pads.

	True.  Quebec is a civil law jurisdiction, much like Louisiana;
private law is governed according to principles of the civil law rather
than the common law.  However, public law (criminal, constitutional, and
administrative) is the same as that prevailing throughout Canada.


> - it\'s own set of immigration laws


	Sort\'ve true.  Although immigration and citizenship are a federal
field of competence, the federal government has delegated a fair bit of
control over the immigration process to Quebec; however, final control over
citizenship remains in the hands of the feds.

	Much like states in the U.S., the provinces have their own
legislatures; these deal uniquely with provincial fields of competence.

	Yup; this was another bit of administrative delegation from the feds.

	This actually implies that Canada _has_ an equivalent to Bills 101
etc.  In Canada, individual liberties and freedom from discrimination are
fully protected by the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  If I wanted to put
up an 80-meter tall pink, yellow and orange neon uniligually French sign in
downtown Toronto I would be free to do so.  In Quebec, if I were to put up
such a sign in English I would be subject to prosecution by the government
(and likely vandalism and numerous hostile editorials in the separatist
press).

	While Canada does have a few sillyish rules on Canadian content in
broadcasting, there are no laws that systematically discriminate against
one particular ethnic group because of an ethnocentrist fear of cultural
contamination on the part of an arguably racist political movement claiming
to represent the majority.

	The Surete is just another provincial police force much like the
Ontario Provincial Police.

	You left out the Constitution (despite what the PQ says the 1982
Constitution is in force and is routinely enforced by the courts) and all
the shared democratic and judicial institutions that this entails,
centuries of common history and a shared tradition of tolerance and
peaceful co-existence (despite the PQ\'s rabid attempts at fomenting
discord), and a common love of hockey that transcends any language barrier
:).

    'body' => '	While some people bash out future histories, I seem to obsess about
gear.  Inspired by the thread on ME21, I decided to design a TL-9 HOTLHL
space-plane (I used FF&S1 since I only had an early playtest draft of
=46F&S2).  Stats follow.  I also have a question: nowhere can I figure out
what velocity is required to attain, say, high Earth Orbit.  I know that
escape velocity for Earth is somewhat over 11 km/sec, but if I understand
correctly you wouldn\'t need to reach that velocity to reach orbit.

	The thing follows this flight profile: 1hr climb in turbojet mode
to get up to stratospheric levels; aerial refuel with HCD then takes place.
A 15 minute climb at 0.76 G\'s in ramjet mode follows to gain both more
altitude and speed; finally a 7 minute burn at 1.86 G\'s in rocket mode is
made to punch it into orbit is made (these numbers take into account fuel
consumption).  On landing, a partial refuel is made during post-rentry
glide in order to allow it to land under power.

	What I\'d like to know is how close to Reality=81 are these numbers
wrt velocity at end of each phase:

Turbojet phase: 0.437 km/s (based on max velocity of 1575 km/h)
Ramjet phase: 7.277 kms (based on acceleration of 7.6m/s^2 for 15 minutes
giving increase in velocity of 6.840 km/s over velocity of .437 km/s at
beginning of burn).
Rocket phase:  15.089 km/s (based on acceleration of 18.6 m/s^2 for 7
minutes giving increase in velocity of 7812 m/s over velocity of 7.277 km/s
at beginning of burn).

	Also, since FF&S1 doesn\'t provide for calculating rate of climb, I
don\'t know how long it would take the plane to get to ramjet altitude; I
figured 1 hour, but I could be way off.  As well, since FF&S1 doesn\'t
provide for calculating air resistance, I have no way of accounting for
that during the ramjet phase which annoys me no end since it might throw a
monkey wrench into the works.  And finally, since I don\'t know how fast you
have to be going to reach orbit, I\'ve designed this thing as one big flying
fuel tank.  If I can reduce burn times I\'d like to increase its passenger
and cargo capacity; as it is, this thing is a Learjet capable of going to
the moon; I was hoping for something like a Bombardier RJX.

	So can any of you rocket science types help me out?

  I don\'t have any specific references to either big wars or major
powers; we can I.D. the U.S. as a Great Power via the Screaming
Eagles, and possibly some of the other troop counters may help.
India and Brazil are unlikely to approach "Western" development
levels in the next century - given their demographics the social
changes needed would likely be inimical to Western sensibilities.

  The OPEC nations are largely screwed when cheap fusion arrives
(either RL or Trav) - their resource drops hugely in value when
demand drops and supply increases, both greatly - graph that puppy.

  I assume no major social upheavals in the U.S. (or seismic
events in Japan); discussing these options seems unprofitable,
as it would seem to largely represent a deus ex to remove them
from the field (see 2300 AD, ad nauseam). Otherwise, Japan seems
safe - the risk of competition from wholly owned subsidiaries
is phantasmal, as London realized prior to the Great War.

  As far as it goes, the exploitation of the solar system makes
mining copper in some Indonesian swamp simply uneconomic. And
Siberia will be hard pressed to compete for investment money
with the Belt. And we know that extra-orbital locations do get
developed, and the early stages must be money sinks.

  We can also posit the signing of the Treaty of New York in
2022 as the successful avoidance of a runaway space arms race;
that\'s a complete shot in the dark, and there\'s probably a
better explanation (hopefully, it doesn\'t involve dice...)

  Hmm. Must seek food. Hopefully, new digest when I come back.

Hello,
  The last suggestion there would fit well with the suggestion from
the RoM dust-up that Solomani grav tech was -1 TL. It would also be
a neat adventure or campaign item for the IW\'s - capturing a supply
of _real_ grav plates to sell at a premium over the cheap Terran 
knock-offs (by 2150, all of the ruling elite will want grav cars),
or a proper Vilani maintenance manual (with the culturally indicated
index of the 3000 fully annotated supplements to the original). A
military objective might be a maintenance facility capable of limited
remanufacturing capability.

  Of course, Terran troops will continue to put great effort into 
stealing enough Vilani grav trucks for their own needs...  ...they
may even leave them green rather than updating them to primer gray.

   In Ohio, people from Kentucky are called "briars".  I\'ve also heard
the expression "briar hopper", which is presumably what "briar" is short
for.  Briar jokes have a similar structure and punch line to Polish
jokes (i.e. How many briars does it take to screw in a light bulb? 
None, briars don\'t have electricity; *or*  three, one to screw it in,
and two to get it out of the back of the cow and put it in the light
socket). 

   In Kentucky, "briar" (sometimes pronounced "blar" down there) used to
be interchangable with "redneck", but is starting to fall out of use as
"redneck" increases in popularity.  As a retort to Briar jokes, people
from Kentucky tell the following: What is a buckeye (Ohio being "The
Buckeye State")?  A worthless nut (buckeye nuts are in fact inedible).

   I have also heard the expression "Ridgerunner" used for people from
eastern Tennessee.

>Assorted Nuts - West Coast

   "California, Land of Fruits and Nuts".  FYI, people from northern
California do not like people from southern California.  Northern
Californians consider southern Californians to be flakes and weirdos,
whereas southern Californians consider northern Californians to be jerks
and names that go unsaid in this format.  Northerns also tend to be more
conservative than Southerns in California, though over the years that
distinction has blurred (particularly when you consider San Francisco,
in northern California, which is about as Liberal--and liberal--as any
city in the U.S.).

   ObTraveller: Without question, both humans and aliens would have
nicknames for other races, some of which are used in front of members of
that race and some which are not (unless you are looking for a fight). 
Anyone have a list of names used that have been cited in previous
material?

   I\'ve taken the bulk of the political discussion off list already,
thanks.

   For the record, I support *both* the First and Second Amendment--the
Constitution is not a Chinese restaurant menu (choice one from column
\'A\' and one from column \'B\').  

   I didn\'t say that all Americans support or approve of militias.  I
was merely commenting on their actual nature versus what gets reported
(and believed by some people) in the mass media.

   As for strict gun control, true enough, there are people in the U.S.
who support it--but they are a minority.  If anything, the trend the
last few years has been to loosen controls rather than tighten them,
evidenced by the fact that an increasing number of states are allowing
licensed individuals to carry concealed weapons.

Regards,

Harold

P.S.  Please no flame wars over gun control!  If you dislike my
viewpoint, respond directly to me!

The reason I\'m asking is that according to my draft copy of TTA,
det laser warheads are very expensive (KCr600 to 1200, depending on
size).

On of the ideas I\'m kicking around for TL9-11 is building a fighter 
that is cheaper than a det laser warhead.

A 50 megawatt laser is well within the reach of such a small cheap
fighter (2m diameter grav focussed TL11 laser comes in at 5.52 m3,
9.52 t without power source. Cost is KCr40, without the cost of the
focussing array, and range is 30 000km), but it could be easier to use
a conventional or kinetic-kill missile in this role.

The abomination known as Fusion Plus is ideal as a power plant, 
although you could fake it with a fission plant and lots of batteries
(does our Pocket Empire have access to TL10 Fusion Plus ???).

In either case, it would have a small HEPLAR maneuver drive (200 kN),
which can easily be powered by batteries.

I dont have the numbers for active sensors, becasue they werent in
my draft copy of TTA. I cant imagine a 30 000km Ladar or Radar
system would be that expensive though, and long-range target
indentification could be provided by the mother ship.

Tactically, theese fighters would screen the fleet at outside the
15 000km range of det lasers, and take out any missiles that approach
the fleet. If the fighters could be built for less than KCr250 each,
then they will be superior to using det laser missiles.

Any comments ?

This is a favorite quote of those opposed to any form of gun control. It\'s
their way of saying "See!! See!!!! See!!!!!!" It does nothing to validate
any argument for or against gun control -- it just makes the quoters feel
like they have the moral high ground.

Unless the air is very smoky or dusty, the only trace of the beam will
be the spot on the target. Unless you are the target you won\'t see any
light from the sight. 

I can confirm this from having played with laser pointers and one laser
sight.

Hmm, this definitely has some merits: Picture this: 
Somewhere on the Edge of Vilani Space, a small undiscovered (so far) 
human minor race exists. It is just about to move into space, when a 
new threat comes into existance. The Vilani discover the Planet. 
Since they have pressing problems elsewhere (IW\'s perhaps?), they 
can\'t send more than a few scout ships to analyse the world. This is 
percievedas threat by the people of that world, so the govenments 
decide to found a secret organization (for simplicity, let\'s call 
them Shado ;-), to battle the invaders. It must be secret because a 
planetwide panic would erupt if the danger became public knowledge. 
To keep everything secret, a second agency, tasked only with keeping 
this under wraps (Majstic, anyone) is founded. They operate in small 
teams of two operatives, dressed entirely in Black, equipped with the 
best secret technology, that the world has to offer.
Other organizations sense there is something afoot and try to uncover 
the secret, to inform the public (Mulder, i saw something!).
Thus, we have a setting where different agencies battle the external 
theat, but also themselves, the Referee could coose the side the 
players are on (Maybe even Vilani) and plot a campain accordingly. 
The Campaign would include elements of UFO (the British SciFi-Show), 
UFO (the Computer Games), X- Files, Men in Black and other series 
along these line.

Well, there is valuable info in those maps, crude as they are. You can

On the other hand the "point defense" weapons *do* have to swing
quickly. And for that matter, can\'t weapons like lasers engage multiple
targets during a turn (if they have a high rate of fire)? If so, then
they *can* shift aiming points quickly.

Even roaches have to breathe. Underwater, it may be possible for them
to get enough oxygen from the oxygen dissolved in the water. But in a
vacuum, not only is there nothing for them to breathe, but they\'ll be
losing water through accelerated evaporation. After a few hours the
likely result is "freeze dried" roaches.

Not really.

Consider, the effect is to turn the nucleus into free protons and
neutrons. The neutrons have a half-life of 17 minutes, so their decay
is going to be messy, but not a "bang". The protons are stable (ie you
get hydrogen).

The energy of a bunch of hydrogen and free neutrons is *higher* than
that of any remotely stable nucleus. So the breakup will *consume*
energy, not liberate it!

You\'ll get some explosive effects from the (effective) high pressure of
the hydrogen (being crammed together so tightly), and the decay of the
neutrons will release a lot of beta radiation, which will wind up as
heat.

	I\'m heartily in favour of depriving the Terrans of gravitics in
M:E21 (at least early on).  I think that the variety of extremely funky
vehicles that would result, such as walkers, advanced rotary-wing aircraft,
rocket-propelled ground-to-space vehicles and so forth, would really add
flavour to the setting.

	And, they\'re more fun to design.  That space-plane thingy I just
posted to the list took four stabs at getting the size right because of
thrust and fuel requirements.  Doing grav vehicles is easy; drop in the
black box and a Fusion+ unit and wham; you\'ve got a grav bike that does
20G\'s :).

	So Marc, please give the Terrans leads in genetics and medicine
since canon requires it, but stiff\'em in the gravitics department...

	2-3000 means a PAW. Less 1000 tons is less 70 meters which
	is to short for a TL-10PAW. 3.6m round*70m length would be

	can you tell me price, weight, volume, mw for tl10 lidars.

	I\'ll certainly place an offer under size, and even than a
	small fleet operation 1tender+2sdbs will involve 92 people,
	14 of the noble officiers. I\'mho there are 4 costs for SDBs:
	purchase - crew - maintaince - munition.  Small "high-tech"

	bulk carriers.

	In combat missiles are the great equalisers, as the are deadly
	enough at TL10. On the other hand side missiles are very expensive.
	My stats (BL) show a price of 850kCr for a 1/14-45 controlled
	missile (6G - 2 BR/T4 points damage). A 65Mj laser with rof 100
	making the same for cheap (but only at 2 clicks)

	BTW TL12 should show 1/25-80 missiles which should make 3
	points of damage in BR/T4 (4G - cost 2 MCr). Those slow
	fat semi independent missiles are missing in T4 ;-(

Basic life support does not include a _bathroom_ and this vehicle has a
10 hour duration.  I suggest you change to standard life support and
allocate 1m^3 to water and waste handling.  (Central Supply Catalog pg
67). If you do not everyone on board is going to be a bit distracted
during the later parts of the flight....

In the article \'One Small Step\' in Challenge 45, Charles Gannon 
mentioned \'\'...the intrasystem skirmishing of the prestellar 
Solomani, circa 2050... Various global and off-world power blocs 
were involved in small squadron actions in the asteroid belt and 
amidst the moons of both Jupiter and Saturn during that time. Some 
confrontations included planetary assaults, such as the fiercely 
fought Titan conflict of 2053, waged between the Pan-Asia Combine 
and the Multinational Corporate Forces.\'\'

The Pan-Asia Combine? Perhaps an alliance between China and Japan, 
which dominates the eastern hemisphere.

	I\'ve been following the discussion of the game setting idea and
have a couple of coments.

1) A decision has to be made as to what direction the world is going as
far as countrys are conserned.  It can be argued on one hand that countrys
are seeking larger political entities such as the EU.  On the other hand,
a lot of the countrys in the world have been splitting into smaller units
(most recently the Czech republic and Slovakia, for no appearant reason
other than self rule of an ethnic group).  Which of these trends will
become prevelant in the 21st century?  Or, could the boarders become
frozen over the next 100 years?  One item of consideration  that should be
taken into account is that many countrys boarders are artificial, having
little to do with the people living there. 

2) I recently heard (I think it was on the Adam Smith show) that India has
the fastest growing middle class of any country on earth.  If this is
true, and the trend continues into the next century, India will become one
of the strongest Economic powers on the planet.

3) On the technical note, when should fusion power become available?  One
expectation of the introduction of fusion is an economic boom unlike any
previous in history.  Should this be the case?  Could it destablize the
the planet?  (This might be a good adventure plot.)

I\'ll list some more things when they occure to me.  Great topic though;
leaves a lot to think about.

I agree, and I also wonder if you would need this shilding to make
your detector directional----it doesn\'t do you any good if you get an
increase in the neutrino count, but you have no idea from what
direction.  Presumably you\'d assume that the detectors tell you
something about direction as they interact with the detector instead
of just giving a count/energy.  Still, noise from your drive would
be nasty :-)  

If you allow such a directional neutrino detector that doesn\'t
require shielding, then it might be neat to put them on drones that
use other sources of power.  Your own ships would still be a source
of noise, but less so if the sensor was deployed far away.  Might
make good pickets in the Kuiper belt.  Of course it\'s kinda silly to
rely on catching the odd neutrino that goes through your detector when 
you catch 99% of the IR that goes by :-)

Yep-the type used for transatmospheric vehicles and the sort.  
Can\'t remember why the limitation exists, but mach 3 is the number I
remember. Must be thinking of scramjets.  As I recall, the ramjet just
has to get going up to the point the compressor section does its job.

I don\'t know whether the star map matches, but in _GDW_\'s _Alien_
_Module_3:_Vargr_, there was complete CT-style information (No
PBG or stellar) for Gvurrdon sector, in the back, as part of the
information included for the adventure "Gvurrdon\'s Story".

Anglic-transliterated Arrghoun (a Vargr tongue), which gives some
very interesting information about Vargr contacts with humans.

Actually, in addition to material heating problems, at high speeds current ramjets
simply stop producing thrust - the drag of air going into their
chambers (and being slowed down enough for combustion to happen) equals
the thrust they produce. Scramjets - supersonic combustion ramjets -
were supposed to overcome this, but haven\'t been perfected yet.

>This gives a V(orb) of 7.72 km/s
You have to add a couple of km/s for gravity losses for a conventional
rocket (the fraction of the rockets energy that goes into lifting it up
early in flight is mostly wasted) and atmospheric drag. And, of course,
you have to get up from the surface to a few hundred km, which takes more
energy; the proper calculation for that isw the same as a transfer orbit
(you spend fuel at the end to circularize the orbit.) You win some back
by launching from near the equator heading east.

All told, the proper number for a spaceplane (which has no gravity losses
and can use its turbojets to get above much of the air) is probably about
9 km/s (plus ten minutes or so of turbojet fuel.) Save a half km/s for
deorbiting at the end and ten minutes of turbojet fuel for the landing
(enough for one go-around if you miss the runway.)

	What I do is just put a bunch of SR1 lasers on the mothership 
itself.  A 65Mj laser and SR1 MFD fits inside a 3-ton turret with room to 
spare and is essentially a guaranteed kill on a missile before it gets 
within det-range.  Admittedly, I use BL rules rather than T4 so this sort 
of thing is a little easier to handle, but the principle should work fine 
and it allows you to save money, space, pilots, etc that would have gone 
into all those little fighters.
	You can also use Fusion+ to power your PD lasers since you won\'t 
use them that often.

	This is actually a subject of much current debate among social 
scientists.  A prof in my department recently presented a paper where he 
argued that the future would look more like Medieval Europe before 
the rise of the nation-state, when economic and political allegiances 
were a multi-level tangle.  For instance, someone might be an Indian, 
educated in Britain, living in the U.S., working for a Japanese company, 
and married to a South American.  Describing this persons is much more 
complicated than naming their nation of birth.  Of course, most people 
will likely pretty much stay put as the always have.
	My take on the whole thing is that the nation-state was a very 
effective unit in its time because the efficient boundaries for economies 
and political/military units essentially coincided.  Now, many countries 
essentially exist in supra-national economies.  Cross-border trade in the 
EU is at something like a third of GDP, though trade still acounts 
for only about 10% of US GDP.  So for many countries, the economic 
motivation for a nation-state is gone.  Things like the EU, NAFTA, and 
the WTO (formerly GATT) have replaced nations as the primary economic 
arbiters.  Similarly, military requirements for nation-states have 
diminished with the rise of collective security arrangements, the US 
world presence, and the long shadow of nukes.
	So with no compelling military or economic need to stay in larger 
polities, various ethnic and cultural groups are aggitating for their own 
nations.  Their desire for separation has to some extent always been 
present, but in some cases has recently been exacerbated by what they 
perceive as the erosion of their culture by outside influences through 
TV, movies, fashion, etc.
	Though there may be a proliferation of smaller nation-states, the 
demands of the global economy will require them to be more and more 
similar in their economic policies.

	ObTrav:  I think the ME21 would see the relegation of 
nation-states to a secondary role behind Global or Regional economic and 
security organizations.  For instance, Canada and Britain could easily be 
broken up into their constituent parts politically but remain united 
under larger North American and European organizations, respectively.  
The U.S. is unlikely to break up, but the Federal gov\'t might wither away 
in favor of the states and international organizations below and above 
them.  Alternately, it could become the de-facto North American gov\'t by 
taking the lead in designing and managing the various cross-border 
agencies that did the real work of running the NA region.

	Projecting those sorts of trends indefinitely into the future is 
a notoriously bad idea.  Some people looked at the rate of growth in 
industrial output in the USSR after WWII and predicted that their economy 
would soon surpass ours.
	No doubt India and other developing nations will continue to 
enjoy rapid economic growth rates, but these rapids rates are possibly 
precisely because they are so backward.  As they develop growth 
inevitably slows to a more moderate rate.

	Fusion will no doubt be a great boon, but given that we are 
rapidly moving to a service/information economy, cheap energy is less 
important to our economic growth than it used to be.  Transporation would 
be most affected, and trade would become even easier, which would have a 
positive effect on the economy.  But I doubt it will be as dramatic as the 
industrial revolution or even the coming/current information revolution. 
The best thing about fusion would be that we could finally stop 
putting all that extra carbon into the atmosphere.
	ObTrav:  Fusion power also means fusion rockets which would 
really open up the solar system and present lots of opportunities for 
exploration and adventure by players.

As I recall, the Saturn V 1st stage r burned 1/2 its fuel clearing the
launch gantry.  Kerosene/oxygen there.  My earlier calc was just an
approximate, as I could only guess at what atmospheric drag would do to
the thing.  

For additional info, the distance to the moon is 242,000 miles off the
top of my head.  I think HEO is considered 10,000 miles and up.  Geosync
is 22,300 .  

I\'d guess the drag problem would be significant up to 50 miles.

Check out the SSTO sites, as there may be something useful "out there."

I should note that the V-1 was actually a pulse-jet.  That is to say, it relied
on an _interrupted_ flow of air to operate.  Should dig out my copy of German

  Sure... you may fire a X-ray pumped Det laser/missile at another 
missile that is in flight,  but not at a missile that is in the
process of detonating.   Only \'beam\' lasers have the reaction time
to target once a missile starts it\'s X-ray rod deployment.

   To really upset the other guy,  put 2.6 meters of armor on this
fighter to give it some resistance <grin> to the tactic of using the
first wave of missiles to clear your fighters.   Of course this forces
a redesign to account for the extra mass of that much armor,  and it
won\'t be as cheap,  but it would be a surprise.

   Good point.  It could be a combination of the two occurs: that is, a
breaking down of larger political units which leads eventually to new
collective arrangements and new large political units.  For example, the
Czech Republic, Hungary, Austria, and Slovenia forming an economic and
defense alliance that leads to a kind of neo-Austro-Hungarian Empire.

   India must somehow overcome the rampant corruption within its
government that sometimes finds its way to the highest offices
(including Prime Minister).  Also potential problems for India are the
ongoing disputes with Pakistan and China.  Pakistan either has nuclear
weapons or soon will, and even a limited nuclear exchange would ruin the
Indian economy.

   According to Traveller, about 2010.  According to reality, perhaps
some 5-15 years later.  Like room temperature superconductors,
economical picture phones, and the Falco comeback CD/tour, seemingly
just around the corner...

Beyond The Pale.  Here\'s the post-game summary:

The Cast:

Amr Santayema: a young and sneaky merchant, played by the TML\'s own Ross
Coburn, who the dudes at the Sylean Atmosphere Surfing Club would find
like, totally guava and gnarly in the extreme.

Lt Kehaaarl: An Aslan ex-marine.  Big, bad, furry, heavily armed, and a
real hit with the kintergarten set (like, we\'re talking Barney with teeth,
claws, and a gauss gun here).  Played by the TML\'s Jason Jones.

Sir Loreni Vilash: Vilani merchant from a poor family whose trading acumen
led him to a knighthood, and who will doubtless have massive screaming
post-traumatic stress flashback fits if he ever sees a G-tank with the
Famille Spofulam logo on it again.

Perlis Dalal: a muscular female ex-scout, who most emphatically does _NOT_
read Harlequins.  Played by the TML\'s Glenn Grant.

Elo Lezaar, a highly geeky Vilani ex-Navy sensors and electronics tech.  He
mumbles, collects meditation rugs and gravitationally abuses bees, and is
played by TML\'er Sebastien Normandin.

Lt. Kurek: A tall, blond, shades-wearing former Navy gunner who\'ll be
manning the nuke damper and serving margaritas to the passengers.



	This bunch of intrepid adventurers is presently assembled, along
with a growingly large number of fellow fortune-seekers, on Mishegaan III,
an LSP mining colony, waiting for an Imperial interdict to lift on a
cluster of main-sequence stars three parsecs away.  However, Ling\'s
unpleasant labour relations practices have led to a full-scale worker
revolt involving nukes and other unpleasantnesses that have sent them
running about safeguarding corporate records, being kidnapped, having to
resort to personal re-entry kits, and other fun stuff.


	Things went a little differently this week: various schedule
screw-ups occurred; some players arrived late, and others had to leave
early.  Therefore, I decided to issue some players with expendable NPC\'s
(generated by Paul D. Owensby\'s wonderful character generation program) and
do the events of the previous game from the point of view of the Imperial
starport security force, in order to get Sir Loreni, whose player had
missed the previous session off the planet and hooked up with the rest of
the party again.  So basically, the first part of the session dealt with
the events of the previous game session from another point of view; the
second dealt with what happened after Sir Loreni rendezvoused with his crew.

	The session opened as a lovely day dawned on Mishegaan III:
completely sunny skies, with pressure at 0.13 atmospheres and temperatures
in the low -20\'s.  Sir Loreni sauntered out to the spaceport bar, threading
his way through the crowded concourse, to meet with a contact from Ling\'s
supply department to negotiate the purchase of some cargo.  Negotiations
were fruitful; he acquired 40-odd tons of plascrete slurry and 21 tons of
industrial diamond sheeting, which were to be delivered to a cargo loading
dock shortly.

	In the meantime, Lt. Ningaa Butall, of His Imperial Majesty\'s Army
(played by Seb Normandin), was on duty when he received a call from Lebar
Eehrt, the spaceport chief, requesting him to take a private and go find
Sir Loreni in the bar and bring him up to the spaceport operations room
(for commendation in his crew\'s having saved Ling\'s corporate treasury the
previous day).  Lt. Butall summoned Pvt. Chauncey Wilsonthorpe (played by
Ross Coburn in a manner somewhat reminiscent of Baldrick in Battledress).
Pvt. Wilsonthorpe promptly folded out of his card game, suited up in
Battledress, checked a PGMP-12 out of stores, and clomped off to meet Lt.
Butall.

	Sir Loreni was somewhat disturbed by their arrival; his contact
from Ling immediately excused himself to the bathroom and began unscrewing
vent grills in order to make his getaway.  After being informed that he was
not yet under arrest for anything, he willingly accompanied them up to the
spaceport operations room (and despite my best efforts, Ross rolled
amazingly well on his battledress-related rolls and didn\'t walk through any
walls or decapitate himself saluting with his visor up and so forth).

	In the Op Room, Lebar Eerht greeted Sir Loreni; while a recording
of SIr Loreni meeting with Liontzel Huutzaa and two of his crewmembers
prior to them entering the colony armed to the teeth played on his desk
screen (events which Sir Loreni had previously denied knowing anything
about), he offically thanked him for his invaluable assistance in foiling
the nefarious terrorist plot to seize Ling\'s records and treasury (and by
showing him the video also warned him to toe the line in future).

	As this was going on, a broadcast was suddenly recieved from the
terrorists who had kidnapped Amr, Dame Berek\'san, and Vought Hendaar
(Ling\'s CEO); the video showed the unconscious bodies of Dame Berek\'san and
Hendaar, and apnned over to show Amr at the controls of an ore hauler going
through his preflight routine at gunpoint; the terrorist leader threatened
dire reprisals should any action be taken against them.  Lebar Eerht gave
orders that they be allowed to depart; then recieving a comm call, he gave
orders that Sir Billum Egassa\'s ship (a heavily armed privateer; these were
the ones who shot down the ore carrier last session) also be allowed to
depart.

	Moments later, the horrified comm station technician warned Lebar
that they\'d just recieved notice that a nuclear device had been emplaced
under the spaceport tarmac; tuning into the appropriate frequency, they
overheard the bomb (actually a standard (if somewhat large) mining fission
nuke) broadcasting its registration number, kilotonnage (341 kt), time to
detonation (at this point, 45 minutes), and polite requests to clear the
area as per Imperial regulations.  However, the bomb appeared to be
shielded somehow, as interrupt code transmissions failed to deactivate it,
so Lebar Eerht ordered Lt. Butall and Pvt. Wilsonthorpe to proceed to the
vehicle pool, rendezvous with a bomb disposal technician, and proceed to
deactivate the bomb.  They saluted and hastily left.  A general evacuation
warning was broadcast.  The Versailles was the first ship away, already
having been warmed up to go chasing after Amr\'s kidnappers.

	Eerht then requested Sir Loreni to proceed, with the aid of Sgt.
Dentask and Cpl. Mibutaakaagash (two more expendable NPCs) to the spaceport
kindergarten, where there were a half-dozen small children belonging to
spaceport staff.  He gave Sir Loreni a data chip containing the location
and pass codes to a vessel that Vought Hendaar had secreted away nearby in
case he had to make a quick getaway; Sir Loreni was to take the children
and proceed to the getaway vessel, and evacuate them if neccessary.

	Meanwhile Lt. Butall and Pvt. Wilsonthorpe had proceeded to the
vehicle pool, where they met up with a bomb disposal tech (well, actually,
one of the spaceport\'s engineers who knew a bit about mining nukes); the
tech provided them with a route (based on hastily done densitometer scans)
into the mine and to the secretly dug tunnel under the spaceport tarmac
where the bomb had been emplaced.  Piling into a grav speeder, with Lt.
Butall driving, they headed for an access shaft into the mine.  As Lt.
Butall\'s player failed his grav craft roll, the ride was a hair-raising,
bouncing-off-the-walls-and-ceiling, high-speed one down mineshafts, along
corridors and so forth, with the bomb\'s warning broadcast providing such an
annoying accompaniment that Pvt. Wilsonthorpe switched it off.

	Finally, after really damaging the grav speeder\'s paint job, they
reached the mouth of the recently dug tunnel leading to the bomb
emplacement.  Arriving at the bomb (which was wrapped in a great deal of
shielding with only the broadcast antenna protruding) with 20 minutes to
spare, they contacted the Op Room.  Op Room responded with a horrified "You
idiots!  Get out of there NOW!".  Quickly switching the bomb warning
broadcast back on, they heard "...thirty-one seconds to detonation.  I
lied!  Twenty-nine seconds to detonation.  Twenty-eight.  Twenty-seven.
Twenty-six..."

	Lt. Butall, Pvt. Wilsonthorpe, and the bomb tech piled back into
the grav speeder in a complete panic, and Lt. Butall floored it out of
there, with Seb failing his grav craft roll again.  Lt. Butall lost control
of the speeder, which went caroming off the walls and tumbling end-over-end
down the tunnel before finally coming to rest completely totalled.  As they
hung there in their restraint harnesses, the inertial compensators and
Tl-12 airbags and seat belts having saved them from serious injury, they
heard an explosion echo down the corridor.  The bomb\'s detonator had gone
off, and the Versailles\' nuclear damper had prevented it from fissioning,
although they didn\'t know this.  They radioed back to the Op Room for a
lift back.

	Meanwhile, Sir Loreni and his escorts were proceeding down a
corridor in a ground car when a breaching charge blew in a wall some meters
down the hall.    Sgt. Dentask quickly bailed out of the car, ran to an
almost safe distance, and fired a round from his PGMP-12 into the hole; Sir
Loreni took a bit of sunburn from the blast, and was quite horrified to see
what it had done to the revolutionaries who had been about to burst through
into the corridor.

	Arriving at the kindergarten, they found the children (six of them)
already suited up in environment suits and respirators; after the children
had been loaded on board they proceeded to the nearest vehicle airlock,
where there was a moment\'s delay as Sir Loreni had to change into an
environment suit.  They then floored it out of there towards their
destination, approximately 30 kilometers east.

	The trip was event-free, with Sir Loreni narrating it like a field
trip for the children\'s benefit: "Today kids, we\'re going to see some
rocks!".  A few minutes after the bomb\'s scheduled detonation time had
passed, Sir Loreni recieved a call from Lebar Eerht.  Eehrt told him that
his crew had managed to damp the nuke, thus saving the spaceport from
destruction.  He asked Sir Loreni to nevertheless continue evacuating the
children as there was some fairly heavy fighting taking place in and around
the spaceport.  He also noted that Amr ought to be visible overhead soon on
his PRK re-entry; shortly thereafter Amr\'s meteoric trail did indeed appear.

	Some time later, they arrived at their destination, which appeared
to be a medium-sized mountain, with what appeared to a long-disused linear
accelerator track about three km long, mounted on massive trestles,
emerging from a cave at its base.  The accelerator was a relic of the
Second Imperium, formerly used to fling ore buckets into orbit.  Sgt.
Dentask parked the car behind a boulder a kilometer away from the cave, and
he and Cpl. Mibutaakaagash proceeded to scout out the cave.

	Shortly thereafter, however, Sir Loreni and the children were
horrified to see a brilliant flash, followed by a mushroom cloud, loom over
the horizon in the direction of the spaceport (this was the second nuke,
that destroyed the Ling mining colony town).  At this, several of the
children panicked, and started running back towards the spaceport, ignoring
Sir Loreni.  Sir Loreni had to go running about rounding up the poor
terrorized children.

	Somewhat earlier, Lt. Butall and Pvt. Wilsonthorpe had been picked
up and returned to the Op Room.  There when the second nuke had gone off,
they\'d been ordered to join Sir Loreni and assist in evacuating the
kindergarten.  Issued with one of the few grav speeders remaining in the
vehicle pool, they quickly took off.  Encountering hostile tracer fire
coming their way, Pvt. Wilsonthorpe (who was driving this time) was forced
to take evasive maneuvers.  Arriving at the mountain after some NOE flight,
they saw Sir Loreni running around with a child under each arm chasing a
third.  They landed and assisted him in collecting and reassuring the
children.  Once their charges secured, Lt. Butall ordered Pvt. Wilsonthorpe
to aid Sgt. Dentask and Cpl. Mibutaakaagash in securing the cave.

	[at this point Jason arrived; I gave him Sgt. Dentask\'s character
sheet and we ate some pizza]

	Some minutes prior, Sgt. Dentask and Cpl. Mibutaakaagash had
encountered hostile fire; however, the Rye-Ben revolutionaries had not been
equipped to deal with Battledress and PGMP-equipped opponents, and they
quickly found themselves pinned down inside the cave mouth.  Sgt. Dentask
ordered Pvt. Wilsonthorpe to fly the grav speeder along the top of the
linear accelerator, land, and proceed to catch the hostiles in a crossfire.
Pvt. Wilsonthorpe complied, parking the grav speeder on the linear
accelerator about two kilometers from its end.

	Proceeding down the accelerator on foot, he quickly reached a point
where he could observe the revolutionaries, who were in the process of
affixing a piece of white cloth to the longest weapon they could find.  He
fired a warning shot into the cave wall over their heads, and reported the
fact that they appeared to be ready to surrender.  After radio contact was
established, the revolutionaries confirmed this fact as they picked
themselves out of the rubble; they laid down their weapons and were
escorted out of the cave by Sgt. Dentask, who confided them to Cpl.
Mibutaakaagash.  The revolutionaries claimed to be members of Ling\'s house
union and denied having any links with the several unofficial unions who
were wreaking most of the havoc currently taking place.  They informed Sgt.
Dentask that many non-combatant Rye-Ben had been escorted to a nearby cave,
and pleaded that these be spared.  Cpl. Mibutaakaagash ordered them to lie
down ont he ground, and kept them covered.

	Afer Sgt. Dentask had taken charge of the prisoners, Pvt.
Wilsonthorpe had continued scouting out the cave on foot.  At the head of
the linear accelerator, he found a long, rakish, 200td needle airframe
starship, mounted on some sort of jury-rigged sled designed to ride the
accelerator\'s rails.  What appeared to be locally-manufactured Tl-7 solid
rocket boosters were attached; two to the sled and four to the ship.  He
was joined shortly thereafter by Sgt. Dentask, Lt. Butall, Sir Loreni and
the children, with Cpl. Mibutaakaagash remaining at the cave mouth guarding
the prisoners.  Entering the pass codes to the ship, Sir Loreni and the
soldiers boarded the empty ship, which the starship-savvy Sir Loreni
recognized as an FSY Moonshine Rapid Insertion/Extraction Starship, with
some retrofitted solid rocket boosters, mounted on a rocket-boosted sled
that rode on the accelerator track.


	Had FSY been alerted to this unorthodox modification, they would
have warned the Moonshine\'s owners that this would completely void their
warranty, and been really annoyed that they hadn\'t thought of it
themselves....


	Sir Loreni and the soldiers discovered a largely spartan interior,
notable for the numerous grav tanks at the crew stations and in the
passenger quarters.  As the cockpit proved to rigged only for G-tanks, Sir
Loreni proceeded to disrobe and enter the grav tank, which involved filling
his lungs with an oxygen-bearing fluid, fed to him via a face mask.  It
also involved filling his digestive tract with a Tl-9 smart gel which
prevented internal organ displacement under high G, via a somewhat
uncomfortable rectally inserted probe.  Once these unpleasant formalities
taken care of, he filled the tank with its fluid and began warming up the
ship\'s power plant and drives and reconfiguring the control panel so it
made more sense to him.

	Meanwhile, the soldiers had raided the galley, dispensing snacks to
the children, and then began the difficult task of getting the kids into
the grav tanks for takeoff.  However, Lt. Butall had neglected to post
guards outside the ship.  Sgt. Dentask was suddenly surprised by someone
slapping something onto his back, then the sound of feet running for the
airlock.  Stumbling around trying to view his back with his gun camera, he
turned his back to the children he was strapping into their G-tanks.  The
children, spotting what was on his back, screamed.  Sgt. Dentask stumbled
out into the corridor; Pvt. Wilsonthorpe spotted what appeared to be a
sticky bomb stuck to his back.  Pvt. Wilsonthorpe bravely leaped to the aid
of his comrade, shoving him out the airlock before he could blow up inside
the ship.  Spotting a bunch of Rye-ben at the base of the boarding ladder,
Sgt. Dentask heroically went crowd-surfing in battledress, squashing
several of them before blowing up.  Meanwhile, a second group fired a
jury-rigged mining laser at Pvt. Wilsonthorpe.  Screaming to Sir Loreni to
take off, Lt. Butall sprayed SMG fire out the airlock while hitting the
emergency close button.

	Sir Loreni, meanwhile, was in the middle of reconfiguring the
rather idiosyncratically set up pilot\'s control board in his G-Tank.
Spotting a likely-looking large red button labelled "Maximum Angle of
Attack"*, he hit it.  This had the effect of firewalling the ship\'s 6G
T-plate drive, flooring its 3G HEPlaR auxiliary drive, and igniting the two
solid rocket boosters strapped to the sled and the four SRB\'s strapped to
the ship which together added a further 6 G\'s worth of thrust.  The
Moonshine surged forwards like it had been punted by a giant, accelerating
at a truly demented 15 G\'s (well over its structural G-limit).  Poor Lt.
Butall was killed instantly by the 2-meter fall to the end of the corridor;
his massive deceleration trauma was compounded by the impact of the
battle-dressed Pvt. Wilsonthorpe who likewise did not survive the fall.
The revolutionaries in the cave were instantly vapourized by the SRB and
HEPlaR exhaust.

	Going from 0 to 60 in a terrifyingly small fraction of a second,
the Moonshine screamed up the linear accelerator track, with Sir Loreni
getting crushed back into his seat by 10 G\'s (three being compensated by
the ship\'s inertial compensators and another two by his G-tank).  The cave,
meanwhile, was getting radically enlarged by SRB exhaust and the
relativistic plasma from the HEPlaR drives.  In the back, the children were
all screaming "Wheee!" but since they weren\'t plugged into the intercom,
Sir Loreni didnt hear this over the catastrophic racket.  They emerged from
the cave mouth (500 meters from their starting point) less than three
seconds after Sir Loreni hit the button, blasting out of it like a cork out
of a thermonuclear champagne bottle, their combined exhaust dramatically
reshaping the mountain and melting the accelerator track behind them like
butter under a blowtorch.  The grav speeder that the late Pvt. Wilsonthorpe
had left partway up the track was simply smashed to bits; it didn\'t even
check the Moonshine\'s acceleration.

	A few seconds later, the Moonshine shot off the end of the track,
the sled falling away beneath it, to impact many kilometers downrange.
With the acceleration dropping to 14 G\'s, the autopilot slewed its nose
upwards and the Moonshine surged skywards like the proverbial bat out of
hell.  Sir Loreni began to lose consciousness, but was revived by the
G-tank\'s injecting him with a near-overdose of Combat Drug and zapping him
with an electric shock via the rectal probe.  Adrenaline and electric
shocks rushing through his system, he continued to try and bring the ship
under control as it hurtled upwards, the creaking and popping of
overstressed structural components echoing throughout the ship.

	Meanwhile, back on the Versailles, Elo was surprised by a
surprising new sensor reading; sensors were picking up a truly spectacular
exhaust plume boosting off the planet; it showed strong gravitic emissions,
a massively red-shifted hydrogen line in its spectrum, and spectrogrphic
emissions consistent with low-TL solid rocket exhaust.  However, since the
Moonshine\'s EMS masking was defeating the Versailles\'s sensors, this
exhaust plume appeared to have no associated ship.  Initially thinking that
it was a missile, Amr alerted the defensive gunners, but ordered them to
hold their fire when it was clear that whatever it was it was not directed
at them.

	Detecting the Moonshine via optical observation, Elo hailed it; Sir
Loreni recieved the transmission, but due to the fact that he was currently
breathing a liquid and was under 9 subjective G\'s, he was unable to respond
coherently.  A few seconds later, the empty SRB\'s automatically dropped
off, peeling gracefully away from the ship whose acceleration dropped to a
mere 9 Gs, of which Sir Loreni only experienced a subjective 4, and Sir
Loreni was finally able to cut the throttle.  Establishing contact with the
Versailles, he requested that they rendez-vous with him.  The Versailles
then notified the Imperial squadron, reuesting that they send a pinnace to
transfer the children from the Moonshine and the rescued Imperial troops
from the Versailles

	After some time spent accelerating after the hurtling Moonshine,
whose structural integrity was gravely compromised, the Versailles managed
to match speeds with it.  Kehaaarl, Perlis, and Amr donned EVA suits and
boarded the Moonshine.  Kehaaarl was first into the ship.  Moving forwards
to the cockpit, down the slightly out-of-true  main corridor, he
encountered Sir Loreni exiting the G-tank before it had fully drained,
coughing up respiratory liquid.  Leaving the cockpit rather slimed, Sir
Loreni headed for the san, retching as he went.

	Kehaaarl and Perlis helped the children out of the G-tanks, none of
them seeming the worse for wear.  Their initial fear of Kehaaarl wore off
quickly, and they began to scratch his ears and pet him, which eventually
escalated to things like whisker-pulling and the like.

	Meanwhile, Amr, after claiming salvage rights with the Navy, began
investigating the ship and discovered the Moonshine\'s (highly illegal)
jettisonable secondary transponder (which unlike its regulation
transponder, could be set to broadcast any number of spurious ID codes,
then left in a legitimate orbit while the ship itself was off committing
mischief).  Releasing it, he raced to the airlock.  EVA\'ing the transponder
to the Versailles\' airlock, trying to get it aboard before the Navy
arrived, Amr miscalculated its inertia and managed to badly break his leg
wrestling it into the airlock, whereupon he passed out.  Leilei, their
engineer, got him inside the ship; Perlis, who had crossed back after
hearing the mishap, helped her wrestle the transponder into Amr\'s quarters.

	Kehaaarl, left alone on the ship, was having an increasingly
difficult time keeping the children under control, let alone away from the
remains of Lt. Butall and Pvt. Wilsonthorpe embedded in the bulkhead at the
end of the corridor.  When the Marines finally arrived, finding him with
one child held in each paw and a third clinging to his leg, he helped them
peel Lt. Butall and Pvt. Wilsonthorpe off the bulkhead and stuff the
children into rescue bags.  In the meantime, the Imperial troops were being
transferred off the Versailles.  Towing the thoroughly exhausted Sir Loreni
across in a rescue bag, Kehaaarl returned to the Versailles.

	After informing them of the cargo he\'d lined up for them, Sir
Loreni headed for his quarters, a nice warm bath, and a bottle, and passed
out.  The Versailles headed back to what was left of the spaceport.  After
a four-hour wait while the Marines finished securing the port and environs,
they landed, and commandeering some cargo loaders, began loading their
cargo on board.  While this was taking place, Amr began advertising passage
out for the Ling refugees left on plant; he managed to round up three (two
security officers and a secretary) who were willing to pay the viciously
inflated price he was charging.  Amr also managed to inveigle some newly
declassified system data on their destiantion out of the Navy.

	After loading had taken place, the Versailles lifted off, finally
heading for jump point, which they reached 2.7 hours later; engaging the
jump drive, Perlis sent them on their way to the Shugilli cluster.

	And we called it there.  More next week.

Eric, the details depend on whether you follow the T2300/2300AD model
really closely or not.  If you strictly adhere to T2300, StutterWarps
become useless in low orbits, so you can\'t use them to get from the planet
to orbit or orbit to the planet.  They also don\'t create any real vector
change, so your ship has to match real orbital velocity som other way. 
Finally, there is the 7.7 light year limit...if you don\'t discharge the
stutterwarp drives in a gravity field every 7.7 light years they irradiate
your ship and kill everybody aboard.

I would also like to see this. Not to get rid of the grav-focussing
handwave, but to make the Terran-Vilani Wars milieu more distinctive. I
would prefer if the technologies in each milieu were different enough to
have characteristic ships, combat tactics, designs, and campaign styles.

  Lies, damned lies, and statistics :) ; their growth rate is high because
their starting point is so low, relatively. Besides, if this trend should
somehow not flatten out, the social tensions will be enormous, both with
the land-owners who won\'t like being squeezed for power-sharing, and the
poor who will still have squat, from a material-consumer POV (i.e., a

  {
    'body' => 'I like the idea of the Terrans having a few technological *disadvantages*,
balanced by a number of advantages. This will give Milieu E21 a
significantly different flavour to the other Milieux. 

I don\'t want to rekindle the flamewar about technology, but I suggest
(only a suggestion, mind) the following modifications to \'Terran Tech\': 

TERRAN TECH LEVEL MODIFICATIONS
- -2 Gravitics/Thrusters, 
- -1 Jump technology (since these technologies are
nowhere in sight as at 10AUG1997...)
- -1 Power generation, energy weapons (since we have not developed such
things as the TL8 Laser rifle or fusion power, although we have a few
promising leads...)
+2 Computers, Medical, Genetics (these are the areas which, as of 1997,
seem to be moving ahead with still-frenetic pace...)
+1 Robotics, non-energy weapons (ditto, pace somewhat less frenetic but
still impressive...)

\'Flavour\' of Terran technology: (initially) non-gravitic, relying on
reaction drives; space weaponry heavily biassed towards missiles, nukes, 
railguns, shot cannisters, DU penetrators and the like, BUT guided with
highly accurate semi-intelligent \'brains\'. Computers involved in
every aspect of life. Genetics \'dabbling\' may have
led to a number of (very minor) modifications to human gene stock, as well
as a series of modified animals - note most of these will not be
intelligent (eg supercows enhanced for milk, not for carrying on
intellectual conversations). High medical technology will have significant
positive impact on morale; prosthetic/bionic limbs (etc) will be common,
particularly among Belters and space warfare veterans. Overall effect:
near future \'hardtech\'. Jump technology developed late, and flawed
theoretical basis means that initially only useful for insystem
\'microjumps\'. However, even this gives a massive boost to insystem trade
(and therefore the economy). 
Power generation technologies based on fission, battery, solar, chemical
etc. sources - some fusion plants exist, but until the mid-21st
century, they are mostly too large for any use in gameplay. 

Some reasoning: 
The standard Traveller technological tables are not handling the changes
in technology over the last 20 years. Rather than change our definition of
technology, why not just declare us \'Terrans\' as an \'anomaly\' - and
\'tweak\' Terran technology to suit what we see around us...the Vilani would
maintain their \'standard Traveller\' technology. 

That \'canonical technology\', up to M:1100, is Imperial standard, which was
based heavily on Vilani measurement standards established by the AAB and
dating to the First Imperium. The Vilani had thousands of years to develop
a \'stable\' technological level of (almost uniformly) 11, with the
exception
(for cultural/environmental reasons) of medical and genetic technologies, 
and (for cultural reasons, ie racial myths of cybernetic \'monsters\' AKA
war machines left on Vland from the Ancients\' Final War) also some
retardation in computer and (particularly) robotics technology.  

VILANI TECH LEVEL MODIFICATIONS
- -3 Medical, Genetics. 
- -1 Computers. 
- -2 Robotics. 
\'Flavour\' of Vilani technology: Labour intensive (few robots/less computer
enhancements) ----> large ship crews. 
Lack of medical technologies should extend to low berths as well - I think it 
unlikely that the Vilani will have low berths, given that the real trick
is not freezing somebody, but thawing them out...  ;)

Once the Terrans conquer a few Vilani warships, they will capture
working models of gravitics/thrusters, etc. that they can reverse
engineer. The Terrans thus \'catch up\' very rapidly in the critical fields 
of gravitics, power generation, energy weapons, jump drives, etc. 
Vilani successes will also give them models of Terran technology, but
Vilani scientists consider them \'perverted devices\' and
impound or destroy them. The one thing the Vilani will *not*
do is try to copy Terran technology...cultural factors again.  

So the Terrans maintain their lead in many technological fields, lose
their disadvantages in most others, and maintain their breakneck rate of
technological development. 

And eventually win the war.

Fighters could attack the missiles from different angles, preventing the
missiles having a cloud of sand pumped out ahead of them by other missiles
dedicated to their defense (the old SFB ECM drone escorting a swarm).

OK. What about a missile with a conventional warhead, either direct

Hmmm, I\'d have to do the numbers very carefully. I\'m inclined to think
the armour would make the fighters so heavy as to be real sons of bitches

I can make sure they only ever call you when they really have to.  And
it\'s so simply.

Move to a foreign country.  Get a few Time Zones between you and them
and they can never call you.

Well, they never called me until I gave them a total incorrect Credit
card number on the Order form.  Like what was I thinking.

In many ways, alaska is still a colony. We are not equipped with any heavy
industry (of note), we produce many raw materials which, by various federal
laws, MUST be exported to the "lower 48" (the 48 contiguous states in the
temperate belt; continental but south of Canada). Most of the land in
alaska is owned by the federal government. Alaskans are not supposed to be
allowed to serve their first term in alaska except when in a mission
critical field that is understaffed. (Was told this by 4 different
recruiters, and have friends find out when enlisting in the lower 48 and
requesting 1st assignment to AK.)

Alaska has an active movement for separation; all the cities are easily
taken by military force. The pipeline is easily shut down (DS or HE in a
45-70; I can make either at home with a reloading kit).

One city has about 1/3 of the state population: Achorage (and environs).
There are more men than women (2:1 in Anch, 3:1 statewide, as conservative
estimates). Another 1/3 of the state lives in the other cities:
Juneau-DOuglass, Fairbanks, Sitka, Homer, Seward, Kenai-Soldatna,
Wasilla-Palmer-Houston-Big Lake. Anchorage\'s environs include seeral towns:
Eagle River, Peter\'s Creek, Chugiak, Eklutna, Girdwood, Indian, Bird Creek,
Rabbit Creek. Official census figures put the state well under a million
people. Unofficial figures put alaska right about 0.95 million. Nobody can
be certain, as alaska has villages that have disappeared for up to 3
years... due to bad weather, and no contact... no way in or out, save by
air, and constant bad weather cuts a few off for months at a time.
It was only in 1986 that the last of the village schools was forced to
teach enlgish rather than russian.
Many villages do not speak english; they use Inuit, inupiaq, Russian, or
one of 20 other native languages. Most villages are unreachable by land
during the spring and summer. Air and river are the basis all travel to
most places in alaska.
State police have the authority to declare legal death, sign death
certificates. They are also the magistrates in areas far from cities.
There are no Sherrifs Dept\'s, and no counties. There is one Borough (our
county equivalent) bigger than any single US state exept texas.

Independance is not viable, because we cannot afford to be without the
mandated trade. We cannot legally gear up sufficiently to have the
industrial and farming base needed for self sufficiency due to federal laws
restricting such. Without the bases covered locally, we could not stand on
our own.


Ob Traveller: Any place where you find lacks like alaska, you will also
find a totally different (and often strongly libertarian) approach to
government, law enforcement, and such. You can, however, keep such
movements small, and often marginalized, by careful taxation and limits
upon what can be locally produced.

You need not prevent local production of a product, but merely limit it so
that it cannot produce product any cheaper than import, which usually means
there will be sufficient demand to require import.

You often cannot control all of a colonial zone... all you need to control
is the basis for their defense and urban lifestyles, and you\'ve got them
hooked.

Excellent!  I think they should be written in this order regardless of
relative popularity, since the extra detail added to E21 will help flesh
out IW and bypass compatibility problems that would be more likely to
arise if written the other way round.  Of course, if sales indicate, IW
could begin soon after, with slower support for E21 overlapping.

I agree.  This is one reason I\'m so fond of Pocket Empires - it\'s the
book that most distinguishes M0 from M1100 or M1200.

Can I second the recommendation of _The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress_ by
Robert Heinlein as a source for ideas on Luna?

I\'d like to recommend GURPS Terradyne as a solar-system-only RPG not yet
mentioned, but guess you might want to avoid looking at other RPGs in
case it\'s hard to disentangle their influence.  The political setup
isn\'t at all compatible (a single earth government, most of the solar
system controlled by a single megacorp), but the other material is
useful - other list members might want to take a look.

A few system features I\'d like to see appearing during the 21st:
* Colonies on Luna (first) and Mars (second).
* Orbital habitats.
* Manned scientific bases on the gas giant moons - probably with
  conditions as comfortable as (say) the Mir station at the moment.
* Asteroid mining.

In RL I\'d probably push some of these a bit later (or even omit), but we
want a good variety of terrans-only settings before those blasted Vilani
turn everything upside down...

> The Interstellar Wars would benefit from emphasizing space battles and
> ship design.

That makes sense.  Although this is of less interest to me personally, I
suspect this would be the bigger seller of the two.

The IW book should definitely have a section on the effect the start of
the 1st War in 2118 has on existing E21 characters (military and non-
military).  There is no time gap between the two milieux, so you don\'t
need an excuse like cold sleep (as in MT->TNE) - you can play right
through if you like.

I imagine there will be a period of military build up before 2118 in any
case, as governments would have realised something was bound to happen
eventually.  I\'m not sure if this should be dealt with in E21 or IW -
but it won\'t require much space anyway.

This is good.  Following recent debate on RoM TL, I\'d say this would be
a good opportunity to give some serious thought to differing TLs in
different fields, since the Terrans\' development seems to be quite
uneven (at least on the standard TL scheme - I support the idea that
this is a Vilani scale).

The style has already been done-a completely reworked 2300. Thats what I
though it was going to be when it came out anyway.  Why not find a way
to bring stutterwarp to the 3I? 

Aside from massive game alteration, what effect would stutterwarp in
Trav actually have to the game mechanics?  Existance of such a drive
would alter the 1 week travel time, but how much would this cause the
universe to change?

(No wonder the Terrans kicked some Vilani butt-they never did develop
jump drive.  Who needs Jdrive when you have SWarp;)

the Swarp drive than the mystical  "Its...radiation!"  An object quantum

space.  There is not much in the vacuum, but it IS there.  The drive
gradually "includes" these items into the ship (as jump drive would

Over a period of time a process called hydrogen embrittlment takes
place, weakening structure and maybe putting a good bit of free hydrogen

your ships structure.  There may be other quantum mechanical ways of
dealing with this, but none I currently know of.

This all brings to mind a problem I\'ve been meaning to bring up since I
started work on Beginnings, but other matters kept pushing aside: Why
do characters from TL 7+ Homeworlds get Grav Vehicle skill? If Grav
Vehicles don\'t come into use until TL 9 (and possibly late TL 9), why
are we allowing characters from a TL or even 2 below that automatically
gain it as a background skill? I have similar problems with the Computer
skill gained at TL 5+, but it\'s a bit easier to believe someone used to 
adding machines *might* be able to use HAL (and if you use the excuse
that computers become so much easier to use that anyone can use them,
then why only limit it to TL 5?)

Just ponderin\'.... and I don\'t care iffn y\'all call me a Yank, Cracker,
Redneck,
or what have ya... cuz I won\'t answer to none of \'em <g>.

outstanding.  The "standard" by which the 3I\'s IISS evaluates TL
must be Vilani in its basis.  This allows reassessment of Terran TL
by category (ala DGP\'s references) and accounts for any "anomalous"
developments here at home.

The slow rate of Vilani technological avdance as well as their
obsession with oppression through classification would have 
encouraged such a regimented system of tech classification.  

WE speak the TL code on the TML because we learned it from Traveller,
but how many of your non-TML friends talk like this?  basically none. 
Most folks talk of "High Tech" and "Low Tech" at best without any
greater gadation.

Even 2300 (Star Cruiser) evaluated tech only as "New Military (TL12),"
"Old Military/New Commercial(TL11.5)," and "Old Commercial(TL11)."

Gravitics could actually exist right now.  The alleged Biefeld-Brown
effect and actually documented and reasonably understood "Casimir 
force" have been known since the 30\'s.  

But what about those microjumps?  Sounds like something similar to
stutterwarp.  To the Vilani, SWarp would have seemed like J-Drive
with different visual effects and limitations.  

Maybe the Terrans were using SWarp when they encountered the Vilani.
As discussed in 2300, SWarp would require enormous computing 
resources, possibly quantum photonic computers, a technology the 
Terrans would have had but not the Vilani.  This technology would 
have been lost during the Long Night as the capability to produce the 
required support systems was lost.

And who really invented the Terran J-Drive.  Did we copy it from 
the Vilani?  If so, why, if we already had SWarp?

If anyone is interested if discussing SWarp in the Traveller universe
on a serious technical basis, let me know.  I\'ll have you believing
it really works as a microjump drive.

I don\'t know if you are considering the binding energy of the 
affected nucleons.  That\'s the mass-energy the particles give up 
when they all come together as a team.  They are held together by the 
residual strong nuclear force (left over and mediated in the form of 
pi neutral mesons from the quark-quark gluon force inside each 
nucleon).  But protons repel each other...a lot.  Do the qq/r^2 
calculation for the electrostatic repulsion of two protons at one 
fermion distance and you\'ll find it to be large. 

What holds them together is the strong force.  Turn it off and the
protons leave....fast!

Present day fission reactors do not consume energy, they exploit nuclear 
resonances to induce instability in certain fissile materials and thus
break down nuclei into smaller mass components (fission fragments) with 
about 200Mev released per nuclear fission.  

Then they do the heat exchange thing with
water-steam-Pennsylvania-Ukraine 
and use the nasty evil glowing steam to generate electricity through the 
Rankine cycle.

Yes, the energy of free protons and neutrons IS higher than the same
nucleons confined in an atomic nucleus.  What is missing is the nuclear 
binding energy, which is related to the strong nuclear force.  When 
you disrupt this force, the Coulomb (electrostatic) repulsion between 
protons drives the nucleons to infinity as free particles, turning all
of
that binding energy you just destroyed into kietic energy of the
nucleons. 
That binding energy has to go somewhere due to the Second Law of 
Thermodynamics. Coincident to this, the electrons now have no bound 
states and also go away.  Bye bye matter.  This, in short, constitutes 
disintegration.

Strong force damper nodes somehow must act to interfere with the 
mesons transmitting the strong nuclear force. If you were dealing
with dampers that acted on the gluon level (quark-quark strong nuclear
atrraction...the only true nuclear attraction), the bang would be
bigger,
since quark quark binding energies are infinite, whatever that
means on a practical level.

Since I don\'t consider T4 mature enough to buy, I would be interested
and would subscribe to that kind of list.

However, it should be stated that T4 is the future of Traveller. If
this game is to survive then it must attract new purchasers. They won\'t
be buying MT or CT, they\'ll want the latest version. My concern is that
a wholesale exodus of people from the TML (and the implied withdrawal
of support for T4) will eventually hurt everyone, including us MT
and CT fans.

Hmmm only time will tell if T4 is the future of Traveller. As for hurting
CT or MT well since nothing is going to be published for CT/MT by IG, any
ideas that such a list might foster can only help CT/MT, since IG will give
no support. 

I don\'t think that there will be a exodus from TML, but I have been wrong
many times before.<G> I am currently on the TML, GDW-Beta, and TNE-RCES
list, I think that a lot of the TMLer\'s will do similar things. On such a
list suggestions for CT/MT can be freely exchanged with out *wasting
bandwidth* for the non CT/MT persons.
 
From what I have seen here if TML has evolved from a bunch of buy anything
that IG *shovels out*, to lets wait and see what those that bought it think
about it. 

For myself I think that the lack of comment on FFS2 by those that have it,
does not bode well for it as a product. Where are the reviews, every other
IG T4 product to date has had reviews both pro and con after a week of the
release. It is not IMO the fault of the developers but due to IG\'s
inflexible time schedule for *Shovelling* things out the door, and the we
will fix it later attitude. From the few FFS2 comments it would seem to be
at least an errata feast. So I am tempted to wait for the second edition of
FFS2, I really don\'t like having pages of errata almost as big as the
original book.

Also I wonder if they ever fixed the 20kg+ M-16 designs that FFS1 had.

Speaking as a survivor of the _last_ Great List Split, I can tell you two
things: one, there will be no \'wholesale exodus\' of people from the TML,
and two, in time it will probably just dwindle down to nothing but
cross-posts from the main list, like the last time. 

rant/

	Personally, I\'m getting tired of the constant whining of a few on
this list that "T4 is broken, no good, and I just wanna play CT and
pretend that nothing else has happened". Fine, we heard you, and if you
want to take your ball and bat and go away and play with yourselves, fine,
do it.

	There is of course room for improvement, large and small in T4,
and if something bothers you that much, just throw it out and use what you
want. I can assure you that neither Marc or IG has a secret corps of
Imperial Men in Black waiting to pounce on anyone Not Following The Rules.

	The vast majority of the contributors to this list seem to be able
to reconcile themselves to the inconsistencies and handwaving of the
current rules.

	The vast majority of contributors on this list will continue to
contribute useful, creative ideas. Why just look: in the last week, the
rough outline of an entire Mileu book has taken shape, with enough detail
that someone who wanted to could run such a campaign in fair detail right
now. Notice, that during the _entire_ M21 discussion, there has hardly
been one word about rules.

	This kind of material is the meat of what the TML can produce when
it wants to, and if you go off to play in your own little CT sandbox,
you\'ll miss a fair bit, if not the large majority of it. 

	But hey, it\'s your bat and your ball, so gowan, beat it, if you
don\'t want to share the playground!

First, I\'d like to thank all of those who replied to my request for 
info on the Gvurrdon sector.  It was very nice to see all of that 
work done for me, and I can\'t tell you what a resource the TML is for 
a Traveller GM.  I would have been stuck with either a lot of work to 
do or running the scenarios I have planned as my players go 
extra-Imperial very differently that the way I want to do.

Even if you never post on this list, it\'s worth the subscription and 
review time for all of the game related benefits that can be obtained 
here.

Thanks.  Thanks very much from a busy Traveller GM.

Now for a new question.

I\'d like to roll up Ht and Wt for my characters.  I\'ve been using the 
TNE method for my T4 characters.  Does anybody know of some alternate 
charts for rolling this up besides what\'s in TNE?

I\'ve looked at the T2300 stuff, and that looks interesting (for body 
mass), but it does not have ht and wt figures.

I\'d like something put out by GDW or DGP, but home grown systems are 
very useful too.

Thank again,

Kenneth.

PS  If you haven\'t looked Joe Walsh and Co.\'s Role Playing Space 
Combat System, then do so.

This thing is incredible.  They did a wonderful job on it, and after 
you print it out, it is as good and anything IG has released to date. 
 They even have it formatted well--and you  can get it on the net FOR 
FREE!	

Good job RPSC people.

I agree that Traveller has always been an innovative S.F. game. However, it
is not a terribly innovative role-playing game. Many of its rules, space
combat in particular, are based on wargaming and not role-playing. I\'m not
saying that is bad, its just that space combat is innovative in things like
ship movement and turn mechanics and not player interaction.

>What are the chances of seeing a good set of first person ship operation
>and combat rules for T$ in the future?

I\'d say the chances are high, especially since Joe Walsh, Eris Reddoch, and
a few other familiar names have already put together a pretty good set of
role-playing rules for Traveller ship combat called, simply, the
Role-Playing Space Combat System. I use it exclusively in my campaign.
Innovative features include active roles for non-weaponry characters like
engineers, pilots, and sensor operators, and tradeoffs for things like
sensors and lasers so simply turning on everything in the ship is not the
best combat tactic. Overall I recommend it highly; it\'s far superior to the
basic ship combat system in the T4 rules.
Try it yourself; it\'s available at http://users.qrc.com/~wildstar/rpsc/.

I beg to differ.  The nation-state isn\'t dead. I think its more likely

management.

People like Gates have more financial power perhaps, but that doesn\'t
translate perfectly to popular power.  Greed is a powerful motivator,
but I believe that its not the strongest, at least not always.  And
people don\'t always vote for what makes them the most money.

Only way to go.  Unless you want a specific character type.  Then give
the character the minimums and let the referee and the player work out
any possibility of higher than minimum stats.  Oh, you might as well
make up a system, I guess, based on the available range between the
minimum and a roll of 12, with it being weighed towards the low end.

For example:  I want a noble character.  He gets the minimum Soc of 10
(A).  Its possible that he could have a higher Soc.  So, make me roll
again on 2 dice.  If I roll 10-, the minimum stat sticks.  If I roll an
11 or a 12, take that roll.  How\'s that?

Huh?  Thats a bit extreme don\'t you think? 110 die rolls?  Anybody who\'s

Maybe TL 7 is the TL at which the average population is rich enough that
they can afford to import grav vehicles and they become ubiquitous.  I
usually prefer to give charecters from TL 7-9 their choice of Grav
Vehicle _or_ Ground Car.  If you have the time you can do WBH detailed

Same reasoning perhaps, at TL 5+ worlds are normally importing computers?

Hmmm.. maybe not.. running a nation like a corporation can only really
happen over a short amount of time, before the people of the nation get
angry over being the lack of social responsibilty and do something about it. 
Anyway, if you are running a nation like a corporation, how do you downsize

And the rest of the country still calls us secessionists!

Yeah, then the Privy Council in London (which up to 1983/4 was still the
highest court recognized by the Commonwealth), ruled that W.A. could only
secede with a through the passage of a secession bill through both houses
of parliament.

Since the House of Representatives is formed on population, and there was
no way that 90% of MHR\'s would vote for the passage of such a bill, it was
all quietly put aside.

Nowadays, secession is used mostly as a rally cry by local pols who are
performing badly in the polls (although that recent High Court decision is
bound to stir up the nest again).

Still, at least we could have fielded our own Test Team! (and Aussie Rules
would be a truly international sport).

ObTrav:  Joining the Imperium seems to be very much a one way proposition.
The Illelish Revolt probably made it quite clear that the Imperium would
not allow member worlds to leave.  On the other hand, the Solomani
Confederation (I\'m speculating here) might very well have had a mechanism
in it\'s charter to allow member states to leave.  After all, the founders
had enough trouble getting everyone to agree on the charter in the first
place....their job would have been slightly less difficult if the member
states thought that they could back out at any time.  Of course, having the
mechanism doesn\'t mean that it was possible to leave...especially as the
Confederation government slowly accrued more powers in it\'s latter
years...likely as not, the Secretary General would ignore the charter and
send in the cruiser\'s (and the Doochten VeldtKommandoes....but that\'s
another thing entirely).

Hmm,
  This might be a bit stale, but I think there are two views
here, each accurate within their context. The latter points
out that the highly developed economies of the West are in
a situation of long-term political stability. 

  The former is emphasizing various current or historical
economic dynamics. Certainly the UK, US, and Japan have 
all been significantly destabilized by economic changes
in the past. 

  The near future can\'t be ascertained, but we know that
the last generation has seen large re-allocations of wealth
and income with new technologies, and structural changes
affecting most of the work-force. Blue collar jobs have
given way somewhat to the new or expanded service sectors,
and combined with other factors has resulted in a strong 
downturn in the living standard of a single-income family.

  Mind you, CPI increases and lower standards of living are
nonsense if you like desktop computing. Many people on the
list have equipment that would\'ve been impossible or hugely
expensive even five years ago. But is the so-called information
revolution not potentially destabilizing in itself?

  M:0 would seem to resemble M: -2500 in this respect, as just
with the current world everyone (or everyone who matters) can
be in near-instant communications with anyone else ("). The
3I of 1100 has the same political command structures as M:0,
but far more lower echelon centers that can go it alone; witness
the Rebellion, and the Regency.

I must admit that my choice of 50 kg as a nice mass for a missile

Reducing laser ranges slightly sounds like a good experiment.

I\'m more convinced with the realism of detection ranges than I am
with the realism of laser ranges and power.  A typical lab laser
(today) would produce a 1 ns pulse at 30 MW = 0.03 J; multiply that
by maybe a thousand for the size of a starship laser, and you get
30J per pulse, not truly good.

X-lasers are sort of hard to power... do you have a little fusion 
chamber powering each one?  The famous SDI X-lasers were powered by 
atomic (fusion? fission?) bombs, which suggests they\'re not easy to 
pump!

As for atmosphere absorbing X-rays... depends on the atmosphere, 
doesn\'t it? 8-)

But the ship\'s gravity has *always* been radiating out from it. So a
ship jumping into system *can* detect it immediately (if it can detect
it at all). It\'s no different than being able to see the star
immediately. You are observing photons that left the star some time
ago.

But detecting *mass* is *not* the same as detecting gravity waves. In
the first case you are detecting a steady field. In the second, you
are detecting the way the field *varies*. Much like the difference
between detecting a charge or a magnetic field, and detecting
electromagnetic radiation. You can\'t even use the same sort of sensors!

Geologists use mass detectors all the time. But gravity wave sensors
are quite different and far cruder.

Actually, "Cities in Flight" is an omnibus edition of *four* novels.
But it\'s not Traveller. The drive used propels you FTL thru real space.
And it also works better with higher mass ships. So the title is
*real*. They are *literally* flying cities around. In fact, at one
point, they are flying a *planet*.

They also have FTL radio. Which is another thing that prevents the
background from being Traveller.

"Cities in Flight" is the source for TDK and anagathics. Jerry
Pournelle\'s CoDominium/Empire universe is the source of black globes
(Langston Field) and white globes (Motie modified Langston Field). E.C.
Tubb\'s "Dumarest of Terra" series is the source of slow drug, fast
drug, and high, middle and low passages, as well as the low passage
lottery. 

Free Traders are mostly based on Andre Norton stories (especially the
Solar Queen books) and possibly on Heinlein\'s "Citizen of the Galaxy".
The Scout service is almost certainly based on Norton\'s "First In
Scouts" which are referred to in many of her SF novels.

You could do *far* worse than dig up such of Norton\'s SF as you can
locate and use it for ideas. It fits the Traveller universe quite well,
except that in her stories hyperdrive travel of any distance is
performed in one "jump", and it\'s possible to exit jump in the middle.
Duration seems to vary with distance. But that\'s a minor consideration
given the richness of her worlds.

For that matter, in E.E. Smith\'s Lensman books, we get to see a duel in
Boskonian society (the bad guys). In D&D terms this is a *very* "lawful
evil" culture. In traveller terms, it\'s high law level, but not nice.

The big difference in their rules is the rather than the *challenger*
getting to pick weapons, etc, the higher ranking person does! Status is
everything...

That could be a rude shock for a player on some world out in the
boonies. :-)

Another oft overlooked detail is that an "edge" with a quite wide

quite well. I have a nice scar on two finger from being careless while

four feet in diameter and several inches thick.

Who\'d have thought a 90 degree edge could cut? :-(

The "negative" appearance black&white IR sensor displays is just due to
our prejudices about what things should look like. Color IR looks just
as "different" (for example, vegetation winds up *red*).

If you use black & white IR, the lighter the color, the hotter the
object is. If you use color IR, red is cool, blue is hot, green is in
the middle.

If you want to see through walls that are much like current house and
building walls, use millimeter band radar. This is already being tested
both for airport security and for covert surveilance.

I must admit, I like the idea.  (Based on the couple of episodes of 
Space: Above and Beyond I saw, the feel might well be similar: clunky 
Terran tech and enemy grav tanks, energy weapons etc.)

However... the point is made somewhere canonical (AM6 or MT I\'d 
guess) that the reason Terrans took so long to develop fusion power 
is that they persisted in using EM fields to contain the reaction.  
Once they developed gravitic containment, fusion power became viable.
In other words, something very similar to contragrav is available in 
the E2100 era.

Of course, the technology would take a while to supplant existing 
military gear; this could be a factor creating a state of 
over-armament and military tension as major powers requip with new 
fusion/grav powered vehicles and sell their old equipment to client 
states.

(*Can* one build reasonable grav tanks without Fusion+?  I\'d think
TL 9 fusion plants would be too large...)

From part 4 of the sci.space FAQ:

	For circular Keplerian orbits where:
	    Vc	 = velocity of a circular orbit
	    Vesc = escape velocity
	    M	 = Total mass of orbiting and orbited bodies
	    G	 = Gravitational constant (defined below)
	    u	 = G * M (can be measured much more accurately than G or M)
	    K	 = -G * M / 2 / a
	    r	 = radius of orbit (measured from center of mass of system)
	    V	 = orbital velocity
	    P	 = orbital period
	    a	 = semimajor axis of orbit

	    Vc	 = sqrt(M * G / r)
	    Vesc = sqrt(2 * M * G / r) = sqrt(2) * Vc
	    V^2  = u/a
	    P	 = 2 pi/(Sqrt(u/a^3))
	    K	 = 1/2 V**2 - G * M / r (conservation of energy)

	    The period of an eccentric orbit is the same as the period
	       of a circular orbit with the same semi-major axis.

	Change in velocity required for a plane change of angle phi in a
	circular orbit:

	    delta V = 2 sqrt(GM/r) sin (phi/2)

	Energy to put mass m into a circular orbit (ignores rotational
	velocity, which reduces the energy a bit).

	    GMm (1/Re - 1/2Rcirc)
	    Re = radius of the earth
	    Rcirc = radius of the circular orbit.

I *am*. For any nucleus lighter than Fe56, the binding energy curve is
such that fissioning the nucleus *uses* energy, rather than produces
it. That\'s why you can get energy by *fusing* them. The new combination
has *less* binding energy than the old one.

Nuclei heavier than Fe56 will produce energy when fissioned. And Fe56
is the most stable configuration. Again, the new configuration has less
binding energy than the old one.

Remember, binding energy shows up as "missing mass". So by breaking a
nucleus down into protons and neutrons, you\'ll *only* produce energy if
the mass of that many free protons and neutrons exceeds the mass of the
nucleus you started with. And for anything up to Fe56 that\'s *not* true.

I also suspect that it may not be true of at least some heavier nuclei.
That is, breaking them up into smaller nuclei may release energy, but
not breaking them all the way down into individual nucleons. I don\'t
have a CRC handbook handy, so I can\'t check a table of isotopes.

As I play in CT/MT era and find T4 buggy albeit improving I\'ll join such a
list as well.
As for the statement that Traveller will die if T4 fails seems a bit
strange. I\'ve been playing Traveller more or less weekly for lots of years
now without ever using TNE/T4 material. Shure - T4 as a commercial thing
will die but that\'s hardly a problem for us. I\'ve got CT/MT material to use
that will keep me going way off into the next millenium not to mention the
ability to write my own stuff as well.

It\'s a bit like saying that Christianity will die unless someone comes out
with some new chapters for the bible (now that\'s an idea...).

The snag I see with this is that suggestions for CT/MT are hugely useful
for T4 supporters and I\'d have thought I fair bit is useful from T4 for the
\'old guard\'.  I would hate to have to subscribe to two lists, essentially
discussing the same things.  I foresee a whole lot of cross posting and
thus more *wasting* of bandwidth for those on both lists.

I\'m sure there will be folk who feel the need to subscribe to both if
there\'s another split.  Someone, please make this spectre go away.

   What makes you think that everyone here supports Marc Miller\'s
Traveller (at least as a replacement for Traveller)?  It seems to me
that there are a significant number of people here who are continuing to
use CT, MT, and TNE and have no intention of buying more than a couple
(if that many) MMT products.  They aren\'t going anywhere, or at least I
hope not.

   As was pointed out to me by someone else off list, the lack of
comment is probably due to the UPS strike here in the US (hard to
comment on something you don\'t possess), GENCON, and the summer vacation
season (hard to comment when you aren\'t here to comment).  Now if it
starts getting on toward the end of the month and we don\'t start seeing
some critical evaluations, *then* I would start wonder.

   FF&S 2 marks an important milestone for MMT.  This, IMHO, is a book
that simply must be good quality for the product line to be taken
seriously.  I look forward to some reviews in the near future.

but I did read almost all of them, and I personally know that Dave and Guy
did a commendable job on a difficult product. They, however, were simply not
given enough time to properly debug the thing. This is where the problem
lies, IMHO; IG is so committed to their release schedule, they are willing
to shove inferior product out the door to meet it. They also decided to
shove ALL of the tables into a confusing and errata-ridden section in the
back of the book rather than go the extra expense and time of properly
formatting each relevant table into the text in the proper location or, as
had been discussed,   at a tables section at the end of each chapter.
        I don\'t think Courtney Solomon is a gamer, if I remember correctly,
and I would suspect not many of the people involved in the business end of
IG are. This is where the problem lies. They do not realise that we want
QUALITY, USEFUL books, that come out RIGHT rather than ON TIME. Delays are
not that uncommon in the RPG business; other companies don\'t announce all
their planned releases for the year, announcing by quarter instead, and are
not afraid to delay a book if it needs additional work. Yes, businesses have
to make money, but let\'s face it, RPG\'s are not a big money business. There
is, in my opinion, no excuse for the kind of shoddiness that went into
FF&S2, and I want all to know that the authors were not responsible.
I also want IG to take close note of the people here who are so frustrated
with the quality of IG\'s products that they have announced their intention
to leave TML. For every customer like that, there are 10 you don\'t hear from
that simply quit buying. And there are a lot of people not on this list who
may be feeling the same. Short-term, Traveller may be doing well. Long-term
is the issue here.

Please bear in mind that I am not a physicist, this is just some stuff I

Ok, heres the deal.
I was thinking about antimater while studying one day. This was in Chemestry 
where we were discussing ionizations.  I remember something about stripping 
away electrons.  I soon thought about the anti-electron, or positron.  Now 
according to what little college chem and physics I had I was thinking that 
if most matter is joined togeteher through these electon bonds, what would 
happen to that matter if shot with a steady stream of positrons.   Would the 
electrons and positrons anihilate each other, thereby destroying the 
electron bonds and causing the ions or pure nuclei to fly appart?  Would 
this positronic beam then be a true disintigrator?

This sounds too simple, and I know physics isn\'t :)

Ok physicist guys, is there some other law(s) I\'m ignoring here?  Or are the 
effects of a positronic beam that devistating?

While I don\'t have a technical problem reinstating X-Boat, I have to agree
with Bruce.  While it would give the CT/MT a place to call their own, after
a bit its double the traffic on both lists.  More than 80% of the
readership will be on both lists.  That is if each list contains 500 names,
only 100 in each list will be unique, the other 400 will be on both lists.  

There was a time where I was reading the same message three times, once on
TML, once on Xboat and once on GDW-Beta.  All the cross-posts are a heavy
burden on our network both in CPU time to process and diskspace to archive
and spool the duplicate mail.

Unfortunatly, Email lists are not Usenet news.  Cross posts actually
manifest themselves in real space consumption, where as netnews, Cross
posts are Symbolic Links (under most news systems) and not so bad on
resources, even with a good news reader, you may only have to see a message
once.  Even with the best mail reader, you get them.

The last time, TNE was radically different from CT/MT.  Only parts of the
history remained intact.  T4 is a lot closer to the original CT but as Marc
has said many times, its been updated.  I just don\'t see a need for
seperate lists.  

I would encourage subject tags as a first step, then people could filter
out the unwanted messages.  If a message is T4 specific, then have the
subject start out T4:.  If it is CT specific, CT: or TNE specific: TNE:

Other generic messages that fit most everything would pass through the
filters and you get the content you want.  Just that everyone has to make a
concerted effort to use the tags.

As some of you may know, I was a subscriber to the old X-boat list 
but not to TML, simply because I had no active interest in TNE.  By 
the time I left, X-boat had more or less wound up in expectation of 
T4 being a worthy sequel to CT and MT.

As long as TML tolerates/encourages posts concerning other flavours 
of Traveller -- like the occasional TNE design we see -- then IMO a 
new Xboat would mean duplication of material for those who read both
and missing some great ideas for those who don\'t.

The perfect Traveller system will always be T++

Well right now there are ideas posted to the TNE-RCES that are not cross
posted, and some discussions on the GDW-Beta list that do not make it the TML.

Well at least here at my end FFS2 available, and several people have
replied that they have gotten their copy via the mail/post. My LGS does not
seem to be having much of a problem getting things past the UPS strike. But
then I am in a major metro area which may have something to do with it.

This statement has, I think, been misinterpreted. Let me try again.

Where I live, Calgary, I have seven MT players. We originally started
with CT rules and moved to MT. I\'m skipping TNE and plan to move to
T4 once I consider it mature enough (based on what people on the TML
say) to purchase.

My players are unable to purchase their own CT/MT stuff easily. That
is, they\'d have to do serious hunting to find the stuff because it\'s
out of print. To solve this problem, I\'ve taken the liberty of putting
the MT Player Manual, Referee Manual and Library online. I provide them
with copies (hopefully I\'m not violating any copyright here). This
provides me with a side benefit; I can edit these versions to use my
home-grown rules and to introduce library entries I feel are important.
If these manuals were available in stores, I\'d get the players to buy
them there.

This state of affairs is fine for me because I already have a full
group of players (my brain can\'t handle more than about that number).

However, consider a group of people who want to start playing Traveller
for the first time. The only material they can get easily is T4 stuff.
New players and referees are, because of availability, almost forced
to use T4 stuff. As the number of Traveller players grows (which it
hopefully will) the number of people using T4 stuff will become 
greater than the number of people using CT/MT/TNE stuff.

To assure the survival of the game, we must support T4 or convince
Marc to release the old versions again. People will use what they find
in gaming stores.

I think Traveller is the greatest game ever invented. I want to see
it thrive. When T4 is mature enough, I intend to make the switch.

How\'s that for muddying the waters even further?

	tl10, 9dt, 3g, 18 g-hours (0.6 m3 of fuel each), 40 armor

	Base price 3.821 MCr is fairly higher than a missile.

	Hm : proper training what do you want paramiliz or hunting club,

	are magazines with adverisments, and e.g. a Tschechishe MP is

	who are not member of a hunting club "schuetzenverein")

	Weapons are like drugs. What I mean ?

	If there is a law against alcohol there will be a Mafia, selling
	wine. If there is a law for mariuana there are "tuerken" ( i thing
	american weed is crown in califorina and mexico ) or a mexican
	selling it. Any time a government increases law level in a part
	I produces a new wealthy class of criminals, and of course an
	opportunity to suppress lower class, political subversives,
	foraign people, and to have a legetimation to also increase
	police, and government "burokratie".

	I always wonder why traveller law level only means weapons.

	We had a planet in our campain, UDP stated law level A. We
	had a job to do there. Ok there we had our guns hidden (in
	nr 5,6 and 7 sandcaster carton) in jumpspace. In habour we saw

On the other hand, had a certain island nation and its gallic ally been a
little more forthcoming in honoring alliances and taking action in 1939,
WW2 would have ended sooner still.

Unfortunately, very few nations in 1939, 1941 oreven today were blessed
with prescience or foresight.

Actually, *none* of the four players in my group are members of the TML and
at least two of them speak quite frequently of varied TLs. It\'s not so much
a TML thing as it is a World Builder\'s Handbook thing. The divided tech and
law levels have been part of my campaigns since MegaTraveller.

Actually, TNE only covers a character\'s mass, and this is a function 
of that character\'s Str and Agility (would be T4\'s Dex) score.

Substitute Dex score for Agility score below.

For males, weight is--
                  80 + [4 x (Str - Agl)] kilograms

For females, weight is--
                    65 + [4 x (Str - Agl)] kilograms

There has to be a theoretical upper limit on efficiency way below 50% for
free-electron "lasers" they generate the beam from "bremsstrahlung" but
only the forward part of it adds constructively to the laserpulse - the
rest is bled off.

Those thinking that x-ray lasers and gamma lsers are much to hard to make
efficient should note that we are comparing them to gravity focussed
gizmos! How efficient can they be without breaking the soundbarrier through
severe handwaving?

Without bashing that Norton guy/girl(?) too much the free traders were

the feel of the empire in its last grand days before the collapse fits

Maybe they were originally intended to go somewhere closer, but the destination

Hewlett Packard Abandons Indian
 Plant Plans
         9:55 a.m. EDT (1355 GMT) August 11, 1997

 NEW DELHI - Hewlett-Packard has abandoned plans to
 locate a $400 million inkjet printer plant in India, the head
 of the company\'s India unit said. 

 "India does not have the infrastucture to support the plant.
 The choice is now between Penang in Malaysia and
 Shanghai in China,\'\' Suresh Rajpal, president,
 Hewlett-Packard India Ltd (HPIL), told Reuters. 

 Rajpal said HP already had a large presence in Penang and
 in Shanghai. 

 "Why can\'t India have at least one international airport
 from which it takes 30 minutes to exit ... within easy reach
 of a manufacturing destination, from where a product can
 be shipped out in four hours.\'\' 

 He said it takes seven to eight days to import goods into
 this country. "Sometimes, you can\'t even find your
 products in the customs warehouse for days.\'\' 

 Earlier this year, HP pulled out from a joint venture with
 India\'s HCL group, HCL Hewlett-Packard, which
 manufactured computers in India. 

 HP has not written off manufacturing printers in India,
 Rajpal said, but will wait for local demand to drive it. 

 "If we can get up to a market share of 250,000 printers a
 year, based on the sales of about two million personal
 computers (PCs), we could drag manufacturing to India,\'\'
 he said.

	Actually, I\'ve seen smaller ones too. Small enough to fit in the 
gun, in fact. About an year ago, I got to test-shoot a Glock 19 with 
a built-in laser sight that replaced the spring guide rod, with 
bateries located in the grip.

	The really cute feature was that the laser flashed on and off:
saves power and is easier to find with naked eye, even in bright
daylight. It was an indoor range of only 25 meters, so I didn\'t get
to test how far the laser dot is visible, although IMO if the target 
is further than 25 meters away handguns are good for "suppresive 
fire" only.

	One more mention about laser sights: It takes a whiule to get used 
to one. The first time I tried a laser (attached to a Beretta M92F) I 
was completely at loss. I knew there was a red dot somewere out 
there, but it took me several seconds to find it - seconds which I 
could\'ve spend aiming using iron sights in a competition, or seconds 
in which the opposition could\'ve taken a nice and cool aim at your 
humble narrator had that been a combat situation.

	Lasers have their uses, but for 70% of the time, they\'re just fancy 
toys that get in the way. How to fit that into game rules, that\'s 
different... :)

Do you have some references to this? The IPP\'s web page regarding the
Wendelstein doesn\'t mention this, only that the Wendelstein is a
stellarator-type reactor designed to study the feasability of this.

If they\'d achieved steady-state energy production, I\'d think it would be
trumpeted on the web page...

Also, one of the groups to reach breakeven WAS a tokomak type reactor. I
could be wrong, since I\'m vaguely recalling something I read on the TML.

(Oh great, now the TML is up there with "I remember something the other

"other month" parameter that produces decade old hits ;-)

	Even better, I quite like the scenario of "Russians in Alaska", as 
in Twilight:2000. Doesn\'t quite work anymore, back in the days of 
Soviet Union it would\'ve been great to run a T:2K campaign with the 
PCs as Soviet soldiers stuck in Alaska (kind of turning the table, so 
to speak).

	Also regarding Alaska, years ago I read a Clive Cussler thriller 
(can\'t remember its name right now) in which the heroic scientist 
Dirk Pitt hunted an old document that provided the Soviets the right 
to buy Alaska back within 150 (?) years, at the same price. Nifty 
idea, too bad the book itself was crap.

	Back to gaming, in an alternate reality campaign I ran a few years 
back (GURPS: Rocket Age) Alaska was used as a dumping ground for the
un-Americans (anarchists, gays, native Americans, social democrats, 
communist spies etc.), until the situation blew in the 1970s. Alaska 
declared independence, Federal Government sent in the troops, all 
hell broke loose. Especially since the Imperial Japan had promised 
the native americans to keep Alaska as their new homeland if they 
could drive the white gaijin away. :) The war in Alaska became the 
equivalent of Vietnam in the minds of Americans after over 10 years 
of guerrilla warfare.

Actually, the core of physics is stunningly simple.  It\'s all the
applications that get hard. :)

Well, I\'m more of an ex-chemist guy, but I\'ll take a shot at it.

Your beam would be a true disintegrator, but it would be even more
\'violent\' than the strong-force-suppression version previously under
discussion.  Each e-p annihilation produces two 511 keV photons (= gamma
rays).  These would tend to strongly couple with nearby matter,
immediately heating it into a plasma (= big fusion-bomb-type explosion).
The effect of bare-nucleus electrostatic repulsion would be swamped by the
effect of e-p annihilation in terms of disintegration energy.

The other problem with a positron beam is beam dispersion.  In a vacuum,
the beam would \'repel itself\', so to speak, causing any reasonably dense
beam to smear out after a *very* short distance (order 10s of meters, I\'d
guess); this would thus be useless as a space weapon.  In an atmosphere,
one might expect to use the CPAWS ion-tunneling effect, but as the
positrons would annihilate electrons in the air just off the end of the
barrel, you\'d end up blowing up your own weapon before anything bad
happened to the target.

My own favorite disintegrator is Niven\'s version.  This device suppresses
the charge on either the electron or the proton (depending on the model
and setting) using some unspecified handwave technology.  Matter in its
path explosively turns into plasma due to mutual electostatic repulsion of
whatever charge you haven\'t suppressed, and electrons no longer being
bound to nuclei.  It reforms (into dust and gas) with much discharge of
static electricity once it blows out of the beam.  For *real* fun you can
aim the proton- and electron-suppressing versions at two spots on a planet
a few dozen kilometers apart, and watch a solid bar of \'lightning\' flow
across the resulting voltage difference, eradicating everything in its
path. 

Sometimes Niven at his best gets into "Doc" Smith territory... :)

This seems a reasonable explanation; I just am one of *those* people who
have problems with the TL being very loosely tied to what can be found on
the planet. I know the explanation that some have made with TLs being
what can actually be produced on the planet; it\'s just my personal prefer-
ence that if you can buy a TL 9 car on the planet, it\'s a TL 9 planet... But
I think I can live with a 2-level "slop" factor, I guess.

That\'s one of the problems of the "what\'s canon, T4 or the old GDW stuff"
debate as I see it: so many of us don\'t have items like WBH in our 
collection... I\'d love to run a world through its paces, but alas...

armed with rifles, while a TL 15 unit may be a squad of plasma cannon
armed soldiers with combat armor.

However, size of the units is based upon the sum of their offensive

amount of space to transport no matter what the TL may be.

The idea that the above squad of TL 15 troopers needs as much

Why is china so low?  (I just picked up this thread, sorry if I

China has over a billion (thousand million) now, so how did it
lose half its population? I believe India now has over 800 million
but I\'m not too sure on that one.

Also, not just because I\'m patriotic, but Canada should be included
as one of the spacefaring nations. Or by "spacefaring" do you mean
nations that build/launch their own ships?

All true.  Disintegrators wreck havoc on that curve.  I\'m not saying 
that if you fission a carbon atom you get a lot of energy released, I 
know better than that.  I\'m saying that if you disintegrate it you 
get a lot of energy released.

How do disintegrators work?  

Do they simply neutralize the SF as Traveller canon indicates? If this 
is the case, then you are left with nothing but the proton-proton
repulsion due to the Coulomb force, essentially equal the negative of
the binding energy.  Again, the nucleus would fly apart violently, as
would the First Law of Thermodynamics.

The BE curve is compiled using empirical, statistical data.  And those
data reflect nuclei assembled AND disassembled in the presence of
the nuclear force.  Disintegrators disable that force.  Perhaps through 
a complex interplay of the Coulomb and Nuclear forces (e-weak force?)
the Coulomb repulsion energy can be exchanged to disable the SF
binding the nucleus together, allowing the constituent nucleons to
simply drift away.  Sounds implausible to me, though.

Perhaps the damper/disintegrator provides the BE required to dissociate 
the nucleus.  This means that disintegrators will require a lot
of power to operate.  Maybe anti-matter.  They simply pay off the
binding energy by pusing the protons to infinity.  Hmmm.  No
strong force manipulation necessary.  This seems wrong.

If this isn\'t the case, what mechanism might you propose that will
keep the proton-proton Coulomb force from driving the nucleus
apart when the SF is disabled?  It sounds like the disintegrator
may violate the First Law if it can make all of that BE go away
without a peep.

If the skill level averages have risen, shouldn\'t the table for crew
salaries be revised to reflect the higher levels?

(Divide base by 1.25 and similarly for increases?)

Is Skill-1 still adequate to obtain a position on a ship?

Howdy!

I wasn\'t implying that Traveller players don\'t use compartmented 
tech levels, I just meant that very few non-Traveller players 
talk of technology in terms of tech levels.  Most normal folks 
can only conceptualize tech levels as "high-tech" and "low"tech" 
nd "what I use to brush my teeth."  I think most Traveller players 
will understand the TL concept.

Composite TLs are also useful concept and should be based on some
sort of figure of merit, say an average of the component TLs.

*Give it an overall flavour not unlike T2300 to make it distinct from M0
and M1100. Nice and gritty.

*Most in system ships will be Heplar, and J-Drive will initially be used in
system to reach outer worlds faster. In fact, Jump Drive should be given a
specific name after someone, to preserve a different PoV. "Jump-Drive" only
becomes the name popularised after it becomes common...

*Look at the way the various colonies in the solar system are developing
unique divided cultures (I recommend the Red/Green/Blue Mars Trilogy by Kim
Stanley Robinson for a good take on this) and how the encounter with the
Vilani starts to stop the increasing factionalism.

*Maybe even have different money systems (eco-economics) like the Mars
books describe.

*Belt operations should be addressed and similar to those described in the
CJ Cherryh book \'Heavy Time\'.

*Have Earth itself a real environmental mess suffering from global warming
(as hinted at in S&A) and expansion a necessity to survive.

*Have the cities in a mess like Bladerunner but *not* cyberpunk.

*Solar sails and cyclers (constant looping ships between earth and Mars as
described in the Cyberpunk supplement Deep Space, and also the Mars books...

* detail the Transnational corporations and friction between them and
governments.

*Reflect the arrogance within the culture assuming they are the most
advanced and alone in space..

And then you drop the Vilani on them.

*Have interesting groups like \'Terrans for Peace!\' agitating for the
benefits of joining the Ziru Sirka.

*The CJ Cherryh book \'Hellburner\' is a wonderful description of service
in-fighting in the development of warships to fight the enemy. And the
necessity of recruiting Belters and Shepherds (who collect the rocks the
belters give to the Mass Driver Ships to send...) to man military vessels
as they think in the right way. This gets interesting if they are
culturally opposed to the military...

Sounds like experience implores that Traveller remain one coherent
entity online.  My support of a separate X-Boat list is predicated
on the impression that some might take offense to Rebellion era

Yes. Stutter Warp is just an alternate application of the same principles
that produces Jump effects. Functional difference is that Stutter Warp
requires a stop after approximate 2 parsecs, where jump limits at 6. 

And both are predicated on an understanding of gravity; basic gravitics
gives you thruster plates, jump drives and stutter warp. You may not be able
to make the gravitic control small enough to stick under someone\'s car; but
you can shift a 100+ dt ship about a start system with it.

I would say this is an opportunity for those with more experience in PE to
apply the PE rules to Earth in the 21st century as a Balkanized world, and
start us from that point on in development of ME21.

How lovely, I arrive back from a wonderful GenCon to find some utter moron
has trolled the TML with this entirely off-topic crap.  Yes, I know who
said this.  He also built lots of road in Germany, does that make
supporting road-building suspect too?  Most of Western Europe has full gun
control including all the Scandinavian nations.  Are they all fascist
police states?  Sweden has a higher standard of living than the US, higher
literacy, less crime, and gun control, but wait, I guess we just can\'t see
the invisible Nazi\'s swarming all over Western Europe, I\'m certain that
you can. 

This is not the place for such arguments, but if idiots post stuff like
that quote I will respond to it.

[snip crazy predictions]

>Corrections and additions, anyone?


   Barring some monumental catastrophe (e.g., large meteor impact) these
numbers are way off.  As said by many others, China is well over a
billion.  Also, for the US pop to reach 400mil in even mid 21st isn\'t
going to happen, its well shy of 300mil now and not growing particularly
fast.

Population growth varies widely among countries.  Some lesser developed
countries are doubling their poulations every 20 years.  Some more
prosperous are fairly steady.  And other factors are involved.  Recall
that China, even with its Billion+ pop has a one-child rule.  If that
changed anytime soon its poulation would really jump.  Better access to
health care and a better diet would both decrease mortality and probably
increase fertility, compounding the problem.  Also, since the one-child
rule has led to a high rate of aborted female fetuses (presumable
because males are better able to contribute financially to the family)
if it changed, there would very likely be a dramatic change in the
male-female ratio towards the female side, increasing pop. further.

Regardless, I am beginning to seriously question whether a Milieu 21st C
can work.  Canon is serioulsy threatened.  Its time for the Deus Ex
Machina.

Go the Physical Adept! (for all you Shadowrun players out there).

Seriously, I remember there was a discussion on the martial arts vs
brawling thing when I first joined the list (back in mid-January). The
argument seemed to go \'round and \'round in circles about how much advantage
martial arts would give you over "the school of hard knocks" form of
fighting. As with a lot of the discussions on the TML, I don\'t think
anything was ultimately agreed on. Personally, I wouldn\'t add it as a
seperate skill unless the skill was harder to get/raise levels in (with an
associated bonus to to hit/damage in unarmed combat). Unfortunately T4 does
not have such a mechanism.

Cheers,
Jason

Not meaning to sound Euro/Ameri-centric, I find it hard to believe that China
and India will be able to project the "power" you predict.  China might be a
possiblility if they maintain a population on the order of 800million as much
of their economic power is based upon individual humans.  China could occupy
Siberia and that would give them the resource base with which to build a
self-sustaining "modern" infrastructure. 

India is in a more precarious position due to several factors.  The caste
system stratifies Hindu culture to such an extent that educating the
1.25billion plus citizens that would be more likely by the Milieu E21 setting
would be a phenomenally daunting task.  That\'s not even taking into
consideration that they are pretty much geographically/sociopolitically
isolated.  Islamic Pakistan and the future Islamic bloc(?) would prevent
expansion to the West while China\'s successful incorporation of the South
East Asian countries excepting Indonesia prevents expansion to the North and
East.

I believe that an interesting development would be the annexation of
Australia by Indonesia.  After all, Java alone has 90 million people versus
Australia\'s 18million.  Australia has incredibly vast natural resources and
the thought of those infidels possessing such wealth will prove sorely
tempting to an aggressively expansionistic nation like Indonesia.

Oh well, my .02Cr or should that be rupiah?

	current pulse on the small Wendelstein is 10 seconds, aquiring
	12MW to heat the plasma, and producing about 14-18MW. The
	Wendelstein princip is capable to enclose a costant plasma,
	but as the small Wendelstein is an experimental reaktor, short
	test pulses (about 2500 for AS-7) with steady reconfiguration
	are dayly work there. Longes pulse tested was 5 minutes on a AS-X.

	Der geplante Nachfolger, die vollst&auml;ndig optimierte Anlage
	WENDELSTEIN 7-X soll nun die Reaktortauglichkeit der neuen
	Stellaratoren demonstrieren.

	Money for this reaktor was founded 96, and they started to build
	it. Size is 35m diameter and produced energy should be around
	1000 MW.

	While Wendelstein type reators have a steady stream of plasma,
	with injection of LHy (55 keV) and Deuterium (65 keV), Tokamaks
	are limited to short pulses, So I wont think that they reach
	production state soon.

	There was an article in "Bild der Wissenschaft" and one
	in "Science", covering the Wendelstein project.

	BTW: Here are the stats of the small Wendelstein :

	- Mass 550 Tonnes
	- Diameter 15m
	- Hight 3m
	- Plasmawendel 5.5m * 0.53m
	- Magnetwendel 3 - 3.9 Tesla
	- Heating 12MW
	- Heating frequence 30-120 MHz (tuneable ;-)
	- Injection 3 milligramm at 12 million degree
	- Working temperatur 50 million degree 10 seconds later
	- Steady injection 0.5 milligram/second

 I recently read something somewhere about serious commercial interest
 in launch sites in Northern Australia which had the advantages of
 (a) proximity to the equator - cheaper launch vehicles/greater payload
 (b) better weather than other launch facilities (ie, the US/European
 launch sites)

 Milieu E21 should reflect these sort of factors either in
 (a) countries with good launch sites having involvement in Space
 (b) conflict between nations over good launch sites.

 for example, taking the aforementioned launch sites in Northern Oz,
 E21 could see major conflict between Australia and Indonesia for the
 launch facilities on the Northern portion of the Australian continent.

 (either that, or a joint Oz:Indonesian collaboration)

   Space: Above and Beyond would make an excellent role model. 
Thrusters with thrust vectoring on assault landing craft and fighters,
and treads on armored fighting vehicles for the Terrans.  The way I
envisioned the Interstellar Wars working, the Terrans would eventually
have an advantage in space naval tech, whereas the Vilani would have had
an advantage on the ground.  Fortunately for the Terrans, the outcome
hinged more on happening in space rather than planetside.

   I had not read this.  Gravitic containment doesn\'t necessarily
translate into grav vehicles, however.  It could be that the Terrans get
gravitic vehicles from the Vilani after capturing a few.

>(*Can* one build reasonable grav tanks without Fusion+?  I\'d think

   Using FF&S I it was possible, I can\'t say for the MMT version.  My
guess would be no.

Yes this is what I meant all along.  I meant when you jump in system you
should be able to tell right away where masses were a little while ago.
If your sensors are good enough this may include masses as small as
those of a ship.

  Er. Having read both Norton and Anderson extensively, I can say quite
honestly that Traveller owes a lot to both. Andre Norton (aka Alice Mary
Norton; one of those female writers forced to adopt a male name to get
published at all, since she started writing in 1932) wrote several dozen
books in at least one future history. More of a storyteller than a hard
SF writer, Norton nonetheless is very consistent with her hardware.  I
consider her Solar Queen series necessary reading for any Traveller
player interested in doing a Merchant character.  Other books I consider
worth reading for Traveller players are the Time Traders cycle, the Zero
Stone/Uncharted Stars pair, and of course Star Rangers. There are others
as well, as she has written nearly 100 novels in her long career.

  Poul Anderson has been writing for almost as long, has many books
worth a Traveller players\' time, and did indeed (according to an interview
of Marc Miller that FASA did) contribute many ideas and concepts to
Traveller. Traveller players would be remiss to not have read his Flandry
series and the Van Rijn/Falkayn cycle (both part of the same future
history). I also recommend the Psychotechnic League cycle and most of
his other SF.

   News Item, Imperial Yacht Club Newsletter, IY 16-322:
   
    Famille Spofulam Yards Launches New Yacht
    
   Recently, I was given the opportunity of touring the first production
   model of Famille Spofulam\'s latest yacht offering. Greeted by Hengabar
   Spofulam at Famille Spofulam\'s orbital HQ, I was treated to the usual
   Spofulam wet bar and buffet before being ushered onto the antiseptic
   floor of Production Line #3 to tour the prototype, which is to be used
   as a corporate yacht by FSY.
   
   This reporter\'s first reaction upon viewing FSY\'s latest, sitting
   incongrously next to the hulking black form of a Bludgeon-class patrol
   cruiser, was: "It\'s a baby Caligula!". Indeed, the Imelda-class yacht
   (named after an ancient Terran queen renowned for her love of luxury
   and lavish tastes) is outwardly very similar to FSY\'s well-known
   1000-ton megayacht; it has an airframe saucer hull with prominent
   vertical stabilizers evoking early space-age Terran ground craft
   styling, in default hull colour settings of hot pink and chrome.
   Although the Imelda is somewhat sleeker than the Caligula, the family
   resemblance is pronounced.
   
   The Imelda\'s performance and specifications are pure Spofulam; 4G
   T-plate maneuver drives, a 3-parsec jump drive, a hull stressed to
   10G\'s for atmospheric operations and heavy armour are what we\'ve come
   to expect from Hengabar\'s boys and girls. The only exception is the
   rather prosaic 95 Mj laser/sandcaster armament suite. Scoops, a
   purification plant and a hangar for a 20-ton launch reflect the
   Spofulam concern for spaceworthiness and functionality; the Imelda is
   capable of more than just the Highport to Highport run. In general,
   this is a fast, long-ranged and capable craft.
   
   While the exterior and performance specs are fairly standard for a
   Spofulam vessel. the interior decor reflects a new departure from
   FSY\'s trademark blond wood and indirect lighting motif. Rather than
   striving for simplicity, maximum ergonomic efficiency, and richness of
   material, FSY\'s interior designers have gone for all-out opulence in
   the newly popular Restoration style; an ornate fusion of First and
   Second Imperium motifs expressed in Sylean materials. The result, the
   product of months of work by noted designer Chonpohl Ghohltyeh, is
   stunning: the panelling is of burled green Lartsa-wood, with obsidian
   tile floors inlaid with green and white nephrite. Fixtures are crafted
   of Iridium-plated gold engraved with both Imperial Sunbursts and Ziru
   Sirkaa and Rule of Man heraldry, and the furnishings are upholstered
   in the finest butter-soft Noggah skin, dyed to match the panelling.
   Ghohltyeh\'s services are available for those wishing to create their
   own decors, albeit for an additional fee.
   
   Mr. Spofulam led me in through the hangar, as the passenger airlocks
   were not yet fully completed. The hangar is situated right aft,
   between the two vertical stabilizers. At the moment empty, the hangar
   is designed to accomodate an Imperial-standard 20td launch, with space
   enough to permit maximum ease of on-board service. After a perfunctory
   explanation of the hangar facilities, I was led forward, detouring
   through the somewhat smaller (20td) cargo hold, into the working areas
   of the ship, on the lower deck.
   
   The lower deck is laid out in a rather simple manner; right aft is the
   hangar, which connects to the cargo hold as well as to the central
   engineering area. A rather nice touch in the hangar area is the large
   and luxuriously appointed passenger grav shaft leading directly up to
   the main corridor on the passenger deck; this permits passengers to
   disembark in style and proceed to the passenger areas without having
   to tour through the working areas of the ship.
   
   Forward of the cargo bay lies the engineering spaces; the J-3 Famille
   Spofulams Subsystems Jump Drive hulks immaculately in the center in a
   large compartment, where the two engineering workstations are
   situated. Access hatches to the spaces containing the twin 10,000
   ton-rated Spofulam Gravitics maneuver drives (mounted aft, outboard of
   the vertical stabilizers) are situated at the rear of the jump drive
   compartment. Likewise, access hatches for the 600Mw Zhunastu Fusion
   Systems power plant (to portside of the jump drive compartment), and
   purification plant (to starboard of the jump drive compartment)
   radiate from the jump drive compartment.
   
   Forward of the jump drive compartment is an access hatch leading to a
   compartment holding a grav shaft to the passenger areas, and
   connecting to the sickbay and 5-workstation bridge. From here on,
   Ghohltyeh\'s hand became evident; the decor changed from workmanlike
   Spofulam engineering-area industrial chic to Restoration-style
   splendour; the sickbay is as much of a work of the desinger\'s creative
   mind as it is one of medical engineering. Like the sickbay, the bridge
   has Lartsa-wood panelling on all non-instrument surfaces, and is laid
   out around a massive owner\'s chair, with power swivel, an endless
   range of adjustments, a refreshment center in one arm and a
   comm/computer panel in the other, and upholstered in what must have
   been the hides of the softest baby Noggahs.
   
   Returning to the grav shaft in the hangar, Mr Spofulam led me up to
   the passenger deck. The grav shaft opens up onto a
   luxuriously-appointed corridor leading forwards. Discreet panels at
   the aftermost end of the main corridor lead to the crew quarters and
   galley and stewarding areas. The accomodations are luxurious, even for
   the crew; all crew save gunners and the two junior stewards have large
   staterooms to themselves. While not up to the standard of accomodation
   of the passenger areas, not even the most work-to-rule member of the
   Spacers Guild could find anything to complain of here: the staterooms
   are all done in traditional Spofulam blond wood and indirect lighting.
   After a brief tour of the crew areas, which connect to engineering via
   twin grav shafts to port and starboard, I was led back into the main
   corridor and into the passenger areas.
   
   The double-width doors at the end of the corridor open inwards, to the
   tune of Famille Spofulam\'s corporate anthem, to reveal an immense
   (300M^3) oval lounge divided into dining, recreational, and lounging
   areas by artfully placed and shaped planters filled with a variety of
   Terran, Sylean, and Vilani vegetation. The Imelda\'s passenger areas
   are centered around this space: eight staterooms are provided for the
   comfort of the owner\'s guests, five of which are standard 4td large
   staterooms, and three of which FSY has termed "MegaStaterooms"; vast
   and opulent 150M^3 spaces containing every possible amenity.
   
   Even these are beggared by the master\'s stateroom, which at 216 M^3,
   or 15 displacement tons, is quite simply immense, with huge panoramic
   viewports set in the ceiling. The furnishings are of course quite
   spectacular; a large canopied bed, sunken coversation pit, immense wet
   bar carved from a simple lump of black jade, and amazingly, a
   fireplace crowned with an actual working ancient Terran "Lava Lamp",
   one of only four known to be in existence. However, these are all
   minor details compared to the Imelda\'s most noteworthy feature; 66M^3
   of the master\'s stateroom are taken up by what has to be the single
   most gigantic \'fresher ever installed on a private vessel, situated
   dead forwards. Resembling more a tropical greenhouse than it does a
   sanitation facility, it holds a hot tub, a sauna, and several large
   planters filled with a variety of Sylean, Terran, and Vilani tropical
   plants. Terran bats and parrots and other exotic flying life forms fly
   from plant to plant, their cries echoing pleasantly from the walls.
   Most remarkable, however, is the massive alabaster-and-Iridium toilet,
   situated at the very front of the vessel, facing huge panoramic
   windows dead forwards.
   
   FSY expects to begin semi-custom production of the Imelda-class early
   next year, at the rate of "one or two" a year.

   Several.  First my list of spacefaring nations:

United States of North America 
Note: This may or may not include Canada and Mexico, would probably
include more than fifty states.

Australia (formerly Australia, New Zealand)

East Asian Alliance (formerly China, Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Mongolia)
Note: More a result of Chinese immigration than an economic alliance.

Oceania (many Pacific islands including the Philipines, Indonesia,
Malaysia, Brunei)
Note: Formed in response to East Asian Alliance.

South Africa
Note: May include Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique.

West Africa Federation (from Nigeria northwest along the coast to
Mauritania)
Note: Led by Nigeria, formed in response to chaos in the interior.

Egypt

Israel
Note: Space provides Israel for an outlet to its sever population
pressures.

India

Arab Republic (Syria, Jordan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Oman, Gulf
States)

Turkey

Russia

Kazakstan

Ukraine

European Union (current members, plus several more)
Note: May not include the UK--a lot depends on how the neo-Thatcherites
fare in the early 21st century.

Brazil

Argentina

Central America
Note: Led by Costa Rica and Panama.

Additional considerations: The above assumes that the cost of space
travel drops considerably by the mid-21st century.  Also, "space-faring"
can include everything from countries with a few token research craft
and a space station to countries that have a space merchant fleet and
the beginnings of a TL 9-10 space navy.

   Population-wise, as has been pointed out by others, population
figures should be much higher, unless of course a world war is factored
in that kills *large* numbers of people (most likely nuclear or
biological).

Harold

The population drop has been mentioned elsewhere...nuff said, apart from
the fact that both nations will have a lot of trouble tackling endemic
corruption and religious/ethnic confict...India and Pakistan may well have
nuked each other into tatters as well...
>USA		400M		0.90

Fair \'nuff...the US has a lot of momentum and infrastructure on it\'s side

>Indonesia	300M		0.70

Politely disagree...Indonesia is a hotbed of ethnic and religious tensions,
looking for an excuse to explode into conflict.  (My opinion only)
Indonesia as an intact state may well not survive Suharto\'s death (with
fairly ghastly security implications for it\'s large, largely empty and
resource rich southern neighbour).

>EU		250M		0.60

Populalation may be a little low, tho\' Europe (esp. Western Europe) has had
slightly negative growth rates for some time.  Does this include the former
WarPac states.

>Nigeria		200M		0.40

The next successful African nation (apart from _perhaps_ South Africa post
1993/4) will be the first...ethnic and tribal tensions have a nasty habit
of causing chaos, corruption and widespread famine.

>Spanish SA	200M		0.35

Possible...although I\'d be tempted to go with just Brazil (isn\'t that a
former Portuguese colony?) and perhaps Argentina.

>Japan		100M		0.30

Pop a little low - I\'d shoot for about 150M.  Lots of infrastructure.

>Korean Union	120M		0.30

After the generation it will no doubt take to rebuild the former North
Korea from the ground up.

Other possibilities/additions:

Russian Federation - c\'mon, it wouldn\'t be the same without the
Russians...and who knows, their economy might even start growing again in
the next few years...I\'d picture an authoritarian state, perhaps a military
dictatorship, but with a very strong free enterprise slant...Russia does
not have a tradition of democracy.

Islamic Confederation - take the former Soviet central Asian republics, add
Iran, perhaps Pakistan, Iraq, Syria and Saudi Arabia...bind them in a very
loose confederation and see what happens...should be interesting (don\'t get
me wrong, I _like_ a lot of Islam\'s points - the lack of racism dictated by
the Koran for one, and it\'s tradition of hospitality and charity...don\'t
judge a religion by it\'s extremeists).

Or (flight of fancy)...the Pacific Rim Co-Prosperity Sphere:  China, Japan,
Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, a few other (less prosperous) S.E.
Asian nations, add Australia (you listening, Dr Mahathir?), Papua New
Guinea and New Zealand.  Huge population, land (and sea) area, resource
base, parts of the area have an extensive hi-technology
infrastructure...and a genuine multi-racial coalition. 

All my opinion only...food for thought...

   How do we know that \'jump drive\' isn\'t the name the Terrans came up
with?  If I remember the Traveller canon material correctly, there was
no one person responsible for its development.

   The canon material indicates that the Terrans had national fleets,
which implies that: a) military spacecraft exist  b) there has already
been actions between them.

   It is quite possible that Terra is working toward a common currency

   <buzz!>  I\'m sorry, wrong answer.  I\'d much rather see an optimistic

forest, re-creation of certain species (giant pandas, etc.), etc.  Save
the grit for space!!!

  Excellent idea.  The transnationals would almost constitute a shadow

   I disagree here.  While that may be the propaganda used on the
masses, the "powers that be" have known since the 2040s that the Vilani
are out there.  This creates an atmosphere of in which the PCs are never
quite sure if they know the whole truth.  S:AAB did an excellent job of
presenting this kind of feel.

>And then you drop the Vilani on them.

   Remember that the Americans find the Vilani and then *quietly*
return, perhaps using the discovery of a habitable planet in the
Prometheus system as a bit of PR cover.  At first, no one would be sure
what to do, but they would also realize that the existence of the Vilani
could no longer be kept a secret.

>*Have interesting groups like \'Terrans for Peace!\' agitating for the

   Maybe not joining the Ziru Sirka, but advocating the sending of
ambassadors to negotiate peaceful coexistence (as if that were
possible).  There will always be people like that around...

It\'s not a "bug", it\'s a "feature", indeed an "opportunity". The factors
used in the War system are intentionally extremely vague, and thus in some
cases (as in the example you\'ve picked) one has interpret the data
accordingly. There is no \'fix\' for such situations, unless you want to model
in detail the precise ships, troops, etc. used. The whole point of the War
system was to avoid this level of detail, while still giving a reasonable
representation, so that the non-wargaming types could resolve the odd battle
without needing pages and pages of complicated combat statistics and rules.
Once could hand-wave and say the high tech guys need tons of equipment space
for all their technical support, etc., while the low tech troops are packed,
sardine-like, into as small a space as possible - perhaps the high tech
troops expect individual cabins with the latest entertainment equipment! :-)
I repeat, this is not a bug, but if you want to suggest alternative rules or
interpretations, then the TML is the place to do it! ;-)

I suspect that mass detection of small ships even in TL 15 will be pretty
close range - nowhere near AU ranges. The enormous gravity wave from the
injumping ship though will be another matter. It could easily be detected
and triangulated in the entire system. I suspect that this is the main
reason fleets are able to detect one another and not simply pass through.

Can you say any more about how these work?

When I hear "free electron" I start thinking about the Fermi level of 
metals; can you use metal crystals as an X-ray laser cavity pumped 
with cyclotron radiation, lasing at the K-alpha frequency, or 
something?

Core rules delayed and riddled with problems
Starships rushed into production, delayed, and riddled with problems...
M0 riddled with problems...
First Survey rushed into production (from my understanding), material left
out, and therefore riddled with problems...

Plus, JTAS delayed and riddled with problems...

And problems with shipping (quality of packaging), broken promises on speed
of shipping, and pre charging of credit cards when product was significantly
delayed past date of charge...

Then we got religion. Courtney came down from the mountain top and promised
us new wonders. Efficiency. Quality. Proofing.

Under the "new management" we have received...

PE with a missing table...
M0 reprint...delayed so far...were our requests for material to be corrected
ever put in? Who knows? Was the material missing from First Survey put in?
Who knows? Wait and see...
FFS2...apparently same old story--authors rushed to finish, company needs it
**now**! Product delayed in production, then looks like a rush job anyway
with typos and problems with the tables--the most important part of the book,
IMHO!
The Long Way Home/Gateway--a great one volume product turned into a two part
product with material duplication...haven\'t checked for errors yet!

And...

Will we see the rules reprint under the revised release date? Doubtful, I
say...

The new management doesn\'t seem that interested in quality control. They are
more interested in getting a lot of product out--maybe it\'s a "critical mass"
theory, throw enough stuff out the door and something will stick!

The new management doesn\'t seem interested in supporting things like
conventions.

The new management apparently can afford to hire a "customer service rep"
(i.e., telemarketer), but not real customer service/quality control
people...or even a proofreader!

If the management supported conventions by attending they could probably sell
all those t-shirts and mousepads they have sitting around by bringing them to
the conventions! After all, gamers go to conventions to buy products. They
could also be used in prizes sponsored by the company, etc.....

This company sucks. There, I\'ve said it. I\'ve been a Traveller player/ref
since 1977. GDW may have had problems, but they had great staff and great
customer service. They kept you informed. I never had a charge put on my
credit card before a product was ready to ship. If a product was delayed,
they kept you informed...in the days before electronic mail, they did a
better job of keeping us informed and getting out the message.

If there were errors, they kept track of corrections and sent them to you for
the price of a stamp. How many errors have we found in Starships and M0 and
First Survey? Are they up on the web page? Are they available for the asking
in e-mail or SSAE\'s? Funny how small game companies like The Gamers, Inc. and
GMT Games can do this...

Look at JTAS. Expensive. Thin. Delayed. Funny how a small company like The
Gamers, Inc. can put their company rag out on a timely basis...cheap, when
compared to JTAS...and filled with useful information. Overfilled with useful
information!

Maybe it is the summer doldrums again. Maybe I\'ll "get religion" again when I
see the reprinted core rules come out on time and hit my mailbox three days
after it ships, as promised. Maybe the rest of the products coming this year
will be error free.

I doubt it. Unless things change, I\'m "picking up my ball and bat". I\'ll not
pre-order anything else (it isn\'t worth the trouble...just about every order
of mine has been at least slightly screwed up...and some have taken multiple
e-mails, multiple phone calls and multiple faxes to straighten out!). I may
not even buy any more through the stores! True, there isn\'t anything new
being published for CT, MT or TNE. But at least all the bugs have been worked
out and I don\'t have to worry about my credit card being charged or getting
irritating telephone calls with more broken promises.

In disgust...

BTW, the rules to the _original GDW Great Game_ for Twilight 2000 and
2300AD are on Steven Alexander\'s Great Game ][ web site at =


http://www.nicom.com/~artcraft/gg2.htm

which also has an economic model for the period 2302 in the 2300AD canon,=
and intends to develop the timeline for 2300AD from 2302 to about 2315
or so. This might be useful to all you PE fans out there.

Aha, OK, I know how these puppies are powered!

Electron bombardment of a metal gives off EM radiation in a continuum 
(bremsstrahlung, the "braking radiation" given off by the electrons 
as they decelerate) plus a few high-intensity peaks from the process

o incoming electron kicks out an electron from atom
o electron from continuum level "falls into hole" left by ejected 
  electron, generating X-ray photon.

This is a very good way of getting monochromatic (single frequency) 
X-ray radiation, but how do you use it to get a coherent (laser) beam?
Is it just a case of making an appropriate cavity?

I suppose you could use the strong emission lines (K-alpha etc.) to 
pump a laser at X-ray frequencies, but then you\'ve got two lossy 
processes: generating the X-rays and pumping the laser.

Quite.  And near-c handwaving is sufficient to power a small rock 8-)

Not quite as I understand it. Stutterwarp is a scaled up version of
electron
tunnelling, with jumps hundreds of metres long repeated hundreds of
thousands of times per second. Jump drive on the other hand is
passage into another dimension ( "jumpspace" ) for a fixed duration.
Stutterwarp does not require interdimensional gateways, and the ship
is in normal space whilst in flight. You can shut down a stutterwarp =

on a dime, but you can\'t leave jumpspace early. Ships using
stutterwarp can take part in sublight combat actions etc, whereas ships i=
n =

jumpspace are prevented from interacting with anything in the normal
universe until they return to it.

Gravitic theory may give you thruster plates, but it has little or anythi=

what we needed and will add a great deal of realism to space combat.
Bruce, I encourage you to sell these to JTAS or for an IG product.

The list split issue.  I am firmly against any list split that isn\'t for a
single concern sub-list (ala TravLang or the TNE folk.)  I use CORPS to run
a classic era campaign.. should I demand my own list?  I get to much good
information from everyone on all topics to afford losing someone; and since
my experience with X-Boat was that it was mostly cross-posts I\'d avoid
subbing to any new list.

Sorry if I made no sense here, but the meds are still wearing off...

Under FFS2/TTA rules, you can build a truly evil grav tank at TL9.
1 m^3 of contragrav lifters gives you 3333 kN. Power it with
fission, fuel cells or batteries.

In most duelling conventions I\'ve heard of the *challenged* party choses

This point is made every so often by those defending a more casual attitude
to previously published material and every time I find it more difficult to
respond in a civilized manner to it. But here goes, for the umpteenth time:

Of course we are all at liberty to take what we want and throw out what we 
don\'t want. That is so obvious a truth that I really think it goes without
saying (ought to, anyway ;-). It is also completely and utterly besides the
point. The point is how much of any new material can we use and how much do
we have to throw away? The more the new material deviates from what I have
established in my campaign, the less I can use it and the more work I have
to do to fit it into my campaign. Work that I would much rather spend doing
campaign-specific material. If the work involved in getting a given module
to work for me exceeds the work of doing it myself from scratch then there\'s
no real reason why I should buy it. And if I buy something expecting it to
fit easily and find that it does not, then I _do_ have a legitimate beef.
IG has the legal right to publish a set of heroic fantasy rules under the
\'Traveller\' trademark, but I daresay you\'d feel a tiny bit put out if you
came home with your shrink-wrapped "TRAVELLER: The New Rules" and found out
it was about swords and sorcery in the Imperium on the mysterious planet Arth.
Well, that\'s the way some of us reacts when we buy something we thought was
based on the old Traveller background and find out it is not.

Frankly, I\'d really like a definite answer from Marc Miller to the following
question:

"Is T4 supposed to be based on the CT, MT, and TNE background, or are you
creating something new, merely mining the old background for ideas?"

China could occupy Siberia and that would give them the resource base with
which to build a self-sustaining "modern" infrastructure.

Methinks the Russians would have a little to say about China going after
Siberia. They may be out of it now, but please try to remember these are the
same people who took millions of dead in WWI, about 25 million dead from
Stalin then another 15-20 million from Nazi Germany, then went on to be a
superpower. They are not dead, just resting. If you wannna see em back,
invade them, that\'ll provoke em

India is in a more precarious position due to several factors.  The caste
system stratifies Hindu culture to such an extent that educating the
1.25billion plus citizens that would be more likely by the Milieu E21
setting
would be a phenomenally daunting task.  

Perhaps a more realistic future would be "sputter, sputter, collapse,
sputter, sputter, violent uprising"

In all fairness to the Navy (and after watching the Discovery Channel\'s
show about the Forrestal fire), squids face more danger than most grunts do
on a day to day basis.. If I get hit, I fall down and bleed a lot.. a ship
gets hit, and it\'s a long ride to the bottom for a lot of young guys (and
women these days.)  I may rag on the Navy, but I wouldn\'t want their jobs
for the world.

Heh.  Reminds me of the time we were getting in a C-130.. This AF-type was
lording over us about his cushy job, easy hours, etc.. until one of my
buddies showed him a Stinger SAM and told him that it could blow the wing
off his Herc from miles away, and we were the ones wearing parachutes and
equipped to survive in the field.

In the last week I have discovered that my blood doesn\'t respond to normal
clotting agents, I have almost no detectable blood pressure at rest, I have
an unexplainable wave in my EEG, I am a bone marrow match with less than
.01% of the world\'s population, and that I have managed to regenerate a
major organ that was surgically removed.

We are here, we come in peace, and when a bug-free edition of Traveller is
released you will be welcomed into the cosmos.

We also have our own satellites in space. Also, there\'s a Canadian

Perhaps the definition of spacefaring, like the definition of major
race, depends upon your point of view.

You will, of course, note that Germany and Japan are Minor races. (HA! in a

BTW, the overall environmental situation is improving. We are still on a
curve down due to momentum, (other than inexplicable oriental decimation of
bears for their bladders, tigers for paws etc), the number of species on
endangered lists is decreasing. As far as Global warming, it is a THEORY,
not a fact. For everyone that screams MELTING ICE CAPS, another yells
GLACIERS. Our biggest environmental problem for the forseeable future will
be human habitation (and there, primarily in the Third World)

The biggest problem humanity faces is ourselves. Namely, increasing
religious fanaticism, cut-throat capitalism, a lack of hope, and a strong
tendency in humanity to follow dictators. 

On a personal note, I think once we get the mass of idiots collectively
known as the human race past the millenium  (thus showing them that no great
apocalypse is going to strike) I think we are going to be okay. (I am a
fervently democratic and humanist, but that does not preclude the fact that
the mass of the human race are idiots)

this is the dominant trend.  I\'ve noticed that most of the suggestions tend
to be the same nations we know now or the super-states ( such as the EU or

Is it not more likely to see a great deal of nationalism ( or more likely "

In all fairness to both services, the Army did the dirty work in Europe,
but the Marines got the Pacific.  Personally, I think it\'s a toss up on
which would have been worse...Omaha Beach or Okinawa.

Actually, I was hinting at my desire to see the possibilities of Indonesia
and Australia "merging".  The rupiah is the form of currency used in
Indonesia.  The resulting confederation/alliance would be extremely powerful
and control several of the most important seaways in the world.  A further
alliance with Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, and the Phillippines would ensure
that the resulting "nation" would be one of the most powerful in the world.
Mt. Wilson on Papua New Guinea is on the order of 15,000ft in elevation

Free Electron lasers work by firing electrons through a series
of magnetic fields. As the electrons are deflected from their
paths, they can be made to emit photons. You can "tune" the
emissions by varying the deflection.

I don\'t recall reading anything about bombarding anything with the
electron beam. I thought it was just EM emission from electrons in
a strong magnetic field - isn\'t this synchroton radiation or whatever ?
Anyway, there wasn\'t any mention of bombarding metal crystals.

Errr ... coherent light is single frequency, isn\'t it ? Or have I missed

Gravitational lensing sucks :-)

Actually, I think it\'s a huge bodge in Traveller that you need this tacti=
c
to get around the fact that UV lasers would never make good weapons at
longer ranges.

Also, the intensity of the field required to do this is awesome - we can
only observe this effect in nature by watching stars be occluded by plane=
ts
and other stars. That\'s 1 g field strength or much higher causing the
effect, and I still don\'t buy this in a ship mounted weapon.

Gravitics in Traveller is a weird subject anyhow - has anyone ever answer=

how
a ship\'s floor plates manage to switch off their field beyond a certain

from the ship ? Why aren\'t things external to the ship attracted to the
floor plates ? Cause havoc in a star port, wouldn\'t it ? Or imagine turni=

  So, I apologise if this is a rerun.  -R ]

Here is the first revision of my Quick \'N Dirty House Rules
for hacking a world computer network.  Thank you for
responding, commenting, and referring me to hacking rules
variants.  Ok, here goes.

Once again, suggestions and further critique are solicited.
This thing has changed a lot over the past week or so.

Network Intrusion
- ----
Network Intrusion is almost an art form, relying on white-
knuckle rides through dangerous systems.  World networks
are powerful, relying on connectivity to provide a measure
of protection and tracing ability.  A secure system depends
on its computational rating primarily; in addition, the
nature of the system also determines security.  Finally,
the Law Level of the world the system is on places some
final touches to system security.

On the Network Intruder\'s side are the invading computer\'s
computational rating, the NI\'s computer skill and related
task skills, and the option of a dedicated program running
a system-hack program.

Architecture
- ----
Just as a world network is made up of computer systems
(connected by Routers), each computer system is built of 
discrete nodes.  Each node has certain elements inherent 
to it that can be manipulated by a user.

Node Class/Type		Connects with	Elements
- ----
I / Direct Interface	N,S		Lockout setting
W / Wireless Interface  "		"
D / Database		D,B,N		Data files; 
					File access list
B / Bus			D,N,S		Connection list;
					Connection access list
					Activity monitor;
					Bus status
R / Router		N		Lockout setting
N / Processor		all		Security setting;
					System map;
					System task list;
					User task list;
					User list;
					Access code list
S / Slave		I,B,N		Task list


Various Traveller skills can manipulate different parts of a system.
The charater\'s Computer rating is always a +DM to the target number.

Skill		Chr	Function/s
- ----
Admin		Edu	Get element
Camouflage	Int	Access system from router
Communications	Edu	Send/Receive external messages
Electronics	Edu	Change element
Forgery		Int	Change element; Access system from router
Intrusion	Int	Enter system; Delete element
Investigation	Int	Get element; Detect IC
Intimidation	End	Cybercombat
Perception	Edu	Get access list; Detect IC
Research	Edu	Get element


So, for instance, to enter a system one would use Intrusion + Int,
with Computer as one of the DM\'s...


Target # and Dice
- ----
Operations have the following target number formula:

Hacker\'s Computer skill
+ applicable skill
+ applicable base characteristic [ probably EDU, INT, or END ]
- - world law level

The number of dice to roll are:

2
- - Hacker Computer\'s computational rating
+ Node computational rating
+ 1 per hacking time reduction (otw 10 sec is assumed)
+ 2 if hacking a business ("amber") net
+ 4 if hacking a military/govt/megacorp ("red") net


Failure
- ----
A failure sets a node on internal alert, adding 2 to subsequent rolls. In 
addition, things like traces and sniffers may be sent out. A second failure 
triggers a system alert, and something bad happens to the hacker or h/is/er 
deck.


Alternate Algorithms
- ----
To help even the odds some, the hacker has a set of alternate
algorithms per hacking run.  These consist of thought-out,
preprepared contingency plans in case a phase of a run goes
awry.  On any failed roll the hacker may elect to execute 
(and expend) one of these algorithms.  The player may remove
one of the dice from the roll, simulating the effectiveness
of the added algorithm.

The number of algorithms available per run equals the hacker\'s
Computer rating.


Hardware
- ----
The typical hacker, being extremely mobile, will have a palmtop
R2 computer, or a briefcase/attache\' R3 for more serious work.

A dedicated "cyberdeck" can be bought, with circuitry geared 
for hacking, with a +1 hack rating and -1 general purpose rating.
They are lighter than standard systems, and cost more:

Cost multiple	Size multiple
- ----
2x  (m2)	0.71
3x  (m3)	0.57
4x  (m4)	0.5
5x  (m5)	0.44
6x  (m6)	0.4
8x  (m8)	0.35
11x (mB)	0.3
15x (mF)	0.25

These beasties range in cost multiples from 2 to 15.  The computer\'s
weight ratio varies directly with the square root of its cost multiple.
Is that a dense paragraph, or what?

Desk models tend to be R3\'s and R4\'s, and are easy targets
for goons to track down.  House computers range from R0 to R2.

Wireless data transfer rates top out at R2, so dedicated systems
aren\'t worth it here.  Wired systems have no limit.


Example 1
- ----
Alright, two examples.  Let\'s assume an R4 Telecom network on
a planet with law level 7.  It\'s effective rating is R6.  On
an LL7 world, it\'s a challenge.  The network looks like this:

              D			2 Databases
              |			1 Bus
        W--N--B--N--R		2 Processors
              |			1 Router to the Grid
              D			1 Wireless interface

The goal: fetch billing records stored in one of the databases.

Our first contestant is a minor noble from Lunion, 97BCDA, Comp-2,
Intrusion-1, Investigation-1, Forgery-2, Perception-1, Admin-2.  He
has an R2, attempting a wireless connection.  Ha!

He has only 2 \'alternate algorithms\'.  He\'d better be lucky.

For entry he needs: 2 + 1 + 12 - 7 = 8

Once he\'s in, simple navigation will require a target roll of:

	2 + 13 - 7 = 8

Dice to roll = 2 - 2 + 6 = 6, which is awfully high for this neophyte.
He\'s not going to get far.  Those 2 \'alternate algorithms\' are going
to be used up pretty fast.  He should work on less dangerous nets
first, to improve his skill ratings.  

Perhaps he would fare better by entering from another system via the 
Router, forging access codes for entry.  The roll for entry would
then be:

	2 + 2 + 12 - 7 = 9, slightly better but still not good.


Example 2
- ----
Our next contestant has more experience: a rogue working for a
trading outfit, working from the central office.  Edu=15, Int=9, 
Computer-6, Intrusion-1, Investigation-1.  He has 6 alternate algorithms 
to spare.  We\'ll assume he\'s also got a wireless R2 connection.

For entry he needs: 6 + 1 + 9 - 7 = 9

Once he\'s in, the navigation roll is: 6 + 15 - 7 = 14

Not bad.  Dice to roll = 2 - 2 + 6 = 6, still tough but the odds are 
better than the noble\'s.  The network is small enough that he probably
has a good chance of getting in, getting the data, and jacking out
with algorithms to spare.  Maybe.

Look up Robert L. Forward\'s work on using black holes to warp space-time.
In one of his science fiction novels he described a vehicle that utilized
"Black Hole Dust" in a warp drive.

next century.  I think this will work.

My assumption was that, somehow, maybe inexplicably,
India is also able to put in very strict population 
controls.  Y\'all are probably right, it may be too difficult.
Also, if India\'s internal struggles don\'t calm down, 
perhaps they won\'t be able to pull it together, but then
neither will the Arab states or East Asia or the zillion
tiny nations out there who won\'t play together.  So I dunno.

Great Suggestions:

Wow, this could be a really great concept.  Given the current
state of the world, play out the development of the countries 
to determine the state of things... very cool!


Questions:
- ----
What should the global population be?  I think the
upper range should be 40 billion.  If it\'s that far
up there, then country populations should be scaled
upwards.  Otoh, if we\'re down around 10 billion, then
that\'s a different thing.

I assume there are no companies which are exclusively 
space-oriented, or is that untrue?

Does someone out there know about Pakistan\'s ability and
plans for aerospace?  (I am ignorant of them)  Ditto for
Nigeria.

And what do y\'all think about Brazil?  And Canada?  And
if you prefer Argentina over SA, let me know.  Give me
some numbers, insert them in the table, remove some from
the table, whatever!

Well as former squid, my instructors always taught us that the closest land
was straight down. I too have watched the Discovery Channel;s Forrestal
Fire show, boy it has brought back memories for me. We used to see those
films about once a year with some that I only saw in USN. Once a year they
put me and some of my ship mates into a small compartment and then flood
it. We had to stop the flooding with our training and brains and
limited(read none) DC support. The first thing we did when we entered the
compartment was to strip off our clothing. To use with the various plugs to
ensure a *leakproof* seal. As in the Forrestal fire I too had to help fight
a ship fire onboard my second ship, I was a twidget(read electronics type)
but due to duration of the fire, the DC(Damage Control) parties were in
need of relief. I used the Twin Agent fire fighting rig ie CO2 and *Purple
K* potassium carbonate. As for why I was selected well sometimes being a
BUFF(Big Ugly Fat Fellow) has its disadvantages. The fire was the result of
a electrical system shorting out and catching other flammables on fire. The
fire was hot enough to melt the aluminium in the overhead light fixtures.

Well I have worked with several former AF people, they were Viet Nam
vets, *protecting the base* was a hell of alot more dangerous than being a
plane jockey.

I learned it at HMC, when the professors would start writing ever so
slightly faster as they neared the nasty bits of a calculation.  For
something particularly nasty, the chalk dust flew, and the audience,
reduced to stenographers, wrote it down, and hoped it would make sense later.

In general, I use it for any argument that sounds reasonable on the
surface, but that depends on smooth talking, and just slipping by for its
validity.

Ahem. We\'ve been building spacecraft since the early \'70s - and launching
them into polar orbits from our own launch site, near Churchill, Manitoba.

A weird story: A friend of mine is the son of a former Canadian Space
Agency director. His dad is currently in Thailand working on a project.
Seems that a Thai princess has just finished a degree in Geology at some
American university, so her father, the King, has decided to give her a
graduation present: her own ground-imaging geology satellite! Spar
Aerospace, builders of the Canadarm and Radarsat, won the contract to build
this little toy.

Spar managed to get a choice slice of waveband for data transmission, at a
frequency which allowed them to build a particularly small ground station -
less than four meters across IIRC. The cost advantages are obvious. But
then the Thai officials found out that the Malaysians, who already have a
satellite or two, have a much bigger groundstation, more than ten meters
across. So the Thais demanded to have a ground station that is _bigger_
than the Malaysian dish! The Spar folks tried to explain why smaller was
better, but to no avail. So they\'re going to build the groundstation with a
ludicrously oversided dish, and most of its surface area will be purely
cosmetic.

ObTrav: If we project this sort of behavior into the Traveller universe, we
can imagine some Padishah on a Balkanized Tech-4 planet, hiring offworld
contractors to build him a railway system - with gigantic fusion-powered
trains equipped with inertial compensators. Just to out-do the dictator
next door.

Don\'t free-electron lasers produce the coherent beam using "wigglers", a
series of electro-magnets that "wiggle" a magnetic field along the beam
path. I don\'t think the photons get bounced back and forth with magnetic
fields, ;-> but somehow or other magnets are involved in creating and
focusing the beam.

I realize that Imperium Games is a business, and must make its
decisions based on what is good for the business.  But, and this
is strictly my opinion, not to be taken as gospel, they do not
have a feel for either the industry in which they are working or
for their specific target marketplace.  There appears to be too
much of a focus on timely product releases rather than on quality
product releases - yet they have shown that they can release
quality product, and have the market (as semi-represented by the
TML) notice and react positively.

I feel that it is time for the gloves to come off at Freelance
Traveller.  Effective immediately, the policy of not publishing
outright negative reviews of products is rescinded.  I can no
longer square with my conscience the conflict between complete
information to Traveller players and the desire to see Imperium
Games succeed.  Since IG has proven that they have what it will
take to succeed (even if they don\'t wish to use it), I no longer
feel that it is appropriate to in effect protect them from their
own mistakes.  I will continue to support their efforts to bring
_good_ products to market; I will encourage others to buy those
products that are worth buying.  I will no longer refuse to
comment on poor product.

To that end, I am requesting reviews of those products which are
currently not reviewed on Freelance Traveller.  I will also take
additional reviews of those products that _are_ reviewed on FT;
variety of opinion is to be desired.  It is preferred but by no
means mandatory that reviews be aimed at the player unfamiliar
with previous Traveller incarnations.

The latest version is version 2.3; it\'s available from his pages
or from the InfoCenter/Software page on Freelance Traveller.  It
has some nice enhancements; for example, it is now possible to
add jump routes via point-and-shoot; you can also identify
hydro-0 worlds and systems with gas giants and bases without

???  What\'s your reference for the plan to "halve the current population by
the next century"?  And -- while contemporary demography is not my strong
point, I had got the impression that the single-child family policy in the
PRC has been steadily disintegrating over the last 6-8 years, and
accelerating in that trend.

Japan looks small to me -- how much population can we expect it to lose in

I can\'t speak for GDW-Beta, but you can subscribe to TravLang by
sending email to maiser@earth.execnet.com with any subject line

You\'re idea of what\'s a bug and what isn\'t is a lot different from

No interpretation is needed. The text specifically states that two
units, no matter the TL, are the same size if they have the same
combat factors. Size is determined by adding the combat factors
together.

There\'s no "interpretation" to this rule.

Oh please. With all those nice factors and tables in the book, are you
saying there wasn\'t room to put in one where (for example) a TL 13
combat unit\'s size was determined by adding combat ratings, and for
every TL increase or decrease you increased or decreased size by 25%?

At the same time you\'ve got convoluted rules on how to subvert
governments, how to maintain a pocket empire economy, etc, etc, all
which have quite complex calculations and equations.

OK, here\'s my off-the-top-of-my-head solution to the size problem.

A TL 12 combat unit determines its size by adding the combat ratings,
just like it says in the book. For every TL increase over 12, decrease
the size needed (rounding down) by 25%. For every TL decrease below
12, increase the size needed for transport purposes by 30% (rounding
down).

That way, if you want to drop TL 15 troops onto a planet, each unit
with an offense and defense of 1 would take 75% less transport than
the TL 12 unit would. If you decided to round up enough men on a TL 8
world to make up the same amounto firepower, you\'ll need 120% more
transport to carry them around.

There should be a bonus to using high tech troops on lower tech
worlds. Right now the way the rules are written, there is not.

Could we possibly reign in the rhetoric?  I run a campaign set in the
Lunion subsector set in the year 1105.  Very Classic.  I also am an active
participant in the ISBA/THUDDD competition.  Very T4.  If called upon, I
will discuss Dulinor\'s (lack of) strategy, the evolution of Virus, the
development of the Rule of Man out of the Nth Interstellar War, or just
about anything else of any possible connection to Traveller!

It is all useful!  Almost all of it is interesting!  To make my point, this
is what I enjoy about each of Traveller\'s "periods"

Classic:  The setting, espically the Spinward Marches through the Fifth
Frontier War.

Mega:  The DGP background publications (Alien Books, WBH, etc..) and the
task system.

TNE:  The harder edge to technology, increased detail in developing
starships and weapons using FFS.

T4/M:0:  The different look to the Imperium, the feeling of getting in on
the ground floor as it were.. also, QSDS/SSDS/FFS2 providing still more
options for the gearhead in all of us.

I use just about everything I read here in some way or the other.  It
really amazes me when somebody can\'t mentally seperate the useful nuggets
of information from whatever context they are given in.

Close your eyes...Drift back slowly to either a high school or (most)
under graduate physics classes (especially those taught by a TA.  OK are
you their?  Good.  Now remember, when someone asked, "how gravity really
worked" or "explain what holds protons together in a nucleus" or any of
a number of topics clearly beyond the capability of the "instructor" to
answer.  Now whereas some of your better instructors would have admitted
that they weren\'t sure or at least that scientists as a whole were not
sure, there was undoubtably someone in your educational past who would
proceed to "explain" how something worked...or at least their best guess
on how it worked--but they wouldn\'t tell you the "best guess" part.

Now if you recall the fervent, highly animated explaination that
followed...often with pretty blackboard pictures but no equations...then
you will have relived a "handwaving" explaination.  A handwaving
explaination usually involves theatrics, diagrams, and rhetoric designed
to back up arguements with little (or carefully selected) scientific
backing.  It is more often as statement of a persons beliefs (which
depending on the person) which may or may not be true.

This all puts handwaving in a negative light; however, I have also had
professors who used it in a positive way.  Sometimes a question would
come up that he (she/it/they) and others in the field had experimental
answers for but for which the theory had not yet been fully developed. 
A "handwaving explaination" would then begin outlining what they
believed was a move in the right direction and was the thrust of current
experiments to prove or disprove.

Sorry--this is more than you wanted I\'m sure.  Just goes to show
you...don\'t ask a question that I might answer--I\'m quite long winded:-}

On the TNE-RCES list we have started updating various sectors for 1200

people have agreed to do Lishun next, but I am not sure.  

The available data for Alpha Crucis  only had names for the high
population planets, so we came up with names for all the planets. 
Harold Hale also updated the Stellar Data, so that it agrees better
with current stellar evolution, and also identified named stars that
exist in Alpha Crucis.   Many of the important worlds were given short
writeups.  Also two pocket empires were created, one of which has a
history that goes back to the Long Night. The 1120 and 1200 data are
presented on available on teh web. (Address below) 

The Massilia data was alot easier, because it had been developed for
the Rebellion in Knightfall. This gave a good jumping off point. 
Massilia also has many world write ups.  

In both sectors we tried to make everything agree with canon.  

The sector data for 1120 and 1200 are located in the OPAL section of
the BARD pages at:

Tokamak as a power generator if it consumes 10-100 times more energy than

I was also interested to hear that the Terrans didn\'t develop fusion power
until late because they insisted on using electromag rather than gravitic
containment. Seems to me that Milieu: E21 technology will be very \'hard
SF\', with gravitics and fusion research as emerging (ie less reliable)
technologies. 

Here are some ideas I\'ve had for E21 technology: 
DRIVES:
Ion drives - for outer system/unmanned vehicles
Solar sails - inner system \'clear space\' runs - but v. limited payload
probably means unmanned, specialist (non-cargo) vehicles. Initial launch
by some kind of rocket booster assisted by laser? 
Daedalus Thermonuclear Pulse Drive - military applications only; early
fusion (ie semicontrolled fusion) = approx. early TL9
HEPLaR drives - military/early fusion technology = approx. early TL10 -
direct descendant of Daedalus H-bomb drive? 
Fusion rockets - TL10 - fusion era technology. 
High-efficiency rockets - TL8 - civilian. 

PROPULSION:
Maglev lifters - very expensive, need planetary magnetic field. Limited to
Earth atmospheric and orbital defence ? 
Ducted-fan hover technology - \'hovertanks\' with amphibian (and
limited flight) capabilities.  
Improved cybernetics gives capability for specialist \'walker\' vehicles
Wing-In-Ground aircraft for long-distance transport (troops and heavy
cargo). 
Advanced submarines, fission-powered with deep-dive (?1000metres?) and 
(maybe?) Wing-In-Ground flight capability for strategic deployment. 

POWER: 
Fission plants
Solar arrays
Batteries
HPG/capacitors - applications needing short peaks of sustained power eg
communications, active sensors
EPG (explosive power generator) - for weapons etc. requiring large peak
power. 
Huge fusion plants come into military use once Terra gets the fusion
containment problems under wraps. 

SPACE HABITATS: 
\'Gravity\' problems solved using spin modules (eg spun hulls, \'hamster
cages\', spin capsules and spin habitats). 

WEAPONS:
TERRAN: Mass drivers, lasers, missiles (nuclear and conventional),
\'grapeshot\' weapons - made effective because of advanced cybernetic fire
control. Advantage in biological weapons; may
also create eg specialist bacteria that corrode plastics, metal alloys
etc.
VILANI: Particle accelerators, plasma/fusion weapons - made effective
because of huge battleships (10000+tons) with multiple batteries and very
large crews.
Initial advantage, but *only* where the few large battleships can be
deployed in the right place at the right time. 

Once the Terrans realise the nature of the Vilani forces, hit-and-run
tactics will keep the enemy on the defensive. Terrans reverse-engineer
captured Vilani ships and weapons and quickly correct their theories about
gravitics and fusion technologies. 

A new generation of Terran weapons systems - fusion guns, particle
accelerators, gravitic-guided missiles and fire control systems (Asimov\'s
*Homo Sol*, anybody?), powered by fusion plants only slightly inferior to
those the Vilani use, gives Terran forces a slight one-on-one advantage. 

The edge is in Terran cybernetics (fire control, missile guidance, etc)
that allows them to strike the enemy from beyond the enemy\'s maximum
weapons range. Strategically, the Terrans are willing to take far more
risks, and therefore are far more unpredictable than the Vilani. Deep
raids and strikes disrupt the Vilani economy and society over whole
neighbouring *sectors*. 

Perhaps most importantly - the Vilani are demoralised by contact with a
race that has developed jump drive without Vilani assistance. The Terrans
also possess a demented genius for weaponry, and a willingness to pursue
\'perverted\' (ie new) technologies. The Terrans also have few qualms about
modifying *themselves* (eg cybernetics, genetic manipulation, surgery),
and, what is probably most disturbing of all, their bodies are infested
with *diseases*, yet they still live... 

Given that the Vilani have spread across so many systems, and
encountered so many minor human races, they must have experienced disease
before (infrequently). However, with their limited medical
technology, quarantine might be the only way the Vilani would have of
checking the spread of disease. 

The Vilani would therefore have an even *greater* horror of
disease, since any individual becoming infected would be exiled from their
community. For the communal Vilani mindset, this *social* form of death
might be even more terrifying than physical death. The thought of 
Terrans walking about with disease germs, fungi and parasites continually
infesting their bodies could be enough to strike terror into the souls of
Vilani soldiers and starship crews. 

Indeed the Vilani must believe Terra to be a hell-world of bizarre
technologies, sociopathic lunatics and pandemic plagues. No wonder the
Vilani never launched an invasion of Earth! In fact, they may have
suppressed information about Terra\'s location, in case any of the Vilani
subject races visited it, and spread contagion to the rest of the Ziru
Sirka.

economical transfers to orbit, and that the greatest wealth/opportunities
are to be found in space rather than on beat-up, overexploited old Earth,

towards the equatorial nations. 

Another factor influencing this might be increased reliance on the oceans
for foodstuffs, mining, living habitats and so on - shifting the balance
further in favour of the hitherto underexploited Pacific, Indian and
Southern Oceans. 

With massdrivers and beanstalks being built around the equator (say,
Kilimanjaro, Solomon Islands, Java, Brazil, and so on) and the planet
depending more heavily on space and the oceans for resources, we might see
Europe and the USA thrown onto Hard Times (tm). 

Political groupings: (suggested)
Oceanic Union (Aust, NZ, SW Pacific islands and a number of SE Asian
nations in an economic/military alliance along the lines of the European
Union/NATO. 
Japan/Korea bloc. 
China/Russia bloc. 
Europa (current-day European Union plus Eastern Europe, Turkey and Egypt?)
North American bloc (USA, Canada, Mexico plus a few other Central American
states)
South American bloc.
Middle Eastern bloc. 
Subsaharan African bloc. 

Each of these would be organised upon economic/trade lines, but with
integrated defence arrangements (something like the European Union today).
Member states would still retain national identity, but with much less
economic and political autonomy than today. 

Of course, the *real* powers would be the corporations, particularly those
controlling access to the massdrivers and beanstalks (projects that would
strain the finances of nation-states, but well within the capability of
corporations). 

This offers us a trigger for the First Interstellar War: corporations
become impatient with negotiating for resources with the Vilani, and
fabricate evidence of a Vilani \'attack\' on Terran interests...drawing the
various power blocs, and the UN, into war.

ahead with their technology in certain fields, missing others that they
had to return to later. 

If (as I am pretty sure) the technologies of fusion, jumpdrive and
gravitics are linked quite strongly to a good knowledge of \'gravitic
physics\' that we Terrans have only got a sketchy knowledge of...

Then perhaps the Terrans have raced down a couple of dead ends with these
technologies, because of slightly flawed gravitics theories. Hence
retarded development of fusion power, anti-grav/thrusters, and jump drive. 

We know that the Hivers spent a few centuries using some really crappy
jumpdrives - you know, the ones that self-destructed after a few jumps. 

Maybe Terran J-drives are similar. They\'re fine for microjumps around Sol
system, but if you try to take them on more than a few successive
parsec jumps, they turn into radioactive slag. That would delay
interstellar exploration for some time after the discovery of \'jump
drive\', until a way of overcoming these difficulties is discovered. 

The thing that suggested this to me is the 2 tech level \'step\' in
developing jump drive - looks to me like races discover jump, but have a
lot of trouble pushing it beyond jump-1. This would make the Vilani\'s
discovery of jump-2 an even more precious secret than previously imagined. 

Once the Terrans have captured a few Vilani ships, even only j-1 merchant
ships, they would be able to reverse engineer (not just the jump
drives, but the thrusters, grav compensators, sensors...) and fix their
theoretical framework of gravitics. This would lead to explosive
technological growth...which we know is what happened. 

The dozens of years of effort in trying to upgrade the inefficient Terran
j-1 drives later leads to many new insights into the physics of jump,
allowing Terra to surpass Vilani technology (achieving jump-3 and thus a
strategic advantage). Parallel to this: application of \'outdated\' 19th
century Gatling Gun technology to modern machineguns, thus producing
modern autocannons and similar super-high rate of fire weapons. 

BTW, speaking of \'explosive technological growth\' - has anybody read
Damien Broderick\'s "The Spike"?

I couldn\'t agree with Douglas more. Unlike (it seems) most people on this
list, I have started with T4*, and am looking back at on all the CT/MT/TNE
stuff. I find reading the various supplements and magazines that my
Traveller fantical friend owns (you out there Harry? :) ) very interesting,
and almost all of it is useful with T4. A list split would be a major pain,
since it means subscribing to two lists, with the large possibility of
reading the same things twice due to cross posting.

If people are really that upset/worried/bothered/harassed by T4 (or TNE, or
MT, or even CT) then we should all try to at least label our posts with the
[T4] or whatever prefix, as suggested earlier in the thread. That way those
of use who find everything useful will still get everything (and only one
copy to boot), while those who only like a particular setting can skip over
what they don\'t like.

Of course, this will only work if we _all_ put in the effort.

Cheers,
Jason


* Sort of. I knew of Traveller, and had read the MT and TNE rulebooks, but
T4 is the first Traveller I have played or bought supplements for (although
once I started playing T4 I did pick up a few supplements for the other
settings).

	Gee... sounds like my kinda place.  Diseases aside, it almost
sounds like Famille Spofulam HQ :).

	Seriously, though, I really like the disease explanation for why
the Vilani never invaded Terra; the first few scout teams that landed came
back horrendously diseased.  I\'d think that the only disease
micro-organisms that the Vilani and other non-Solomani humans would have
encountered would have been alien ones that adapted to humaniti within the
past 300,000 years.  It would have made no sense for the Ancients to have
scattered diseased humans thoughout the stars...  I\'d imagine that the
number of disease micro-organisms that the Vilani would know would be at
max a few dozen, all of them not terribly well adapted to infecting humans.
I\'d think that in most cases, they\'d be organisms that simply found the
human digestive tract a nice place to live.

	So imagine what their reaction to a whole planetful of diseases
that have evolved to parasitize humans.  Just imagine how they\'d freak out
over antibiotic-resistant superbugs.  And then there are the seriously
killer diseases; viral meningitis.  Tuberculosis.  AIDS.  Flesh-eating
bacteria.  Mad Cow disease.  Ebola.  The bubonic plague.

	And then of course there\'s the other parasites; mosquitoes, jock
itch, tapeworms, lice, fleas, leeches, black flies (I can just see the
first Ziru Sirkaa ship landing in northern Quebec in spring time :>),
hookworms...

While that\'s certainly an *application* of handwaving. The origin of the
term *may* lie elsewhere.  I first heard the term in a conversation between
my father and one of my uncles, over 30 years ago, regarding a politician\'s
speech. Said my uncle, "He was just handwaving his vote away.", or
something like that.  I asked what that meant and was told that handwaving
was what a magician does when he\'s doing a trick.  He "waves his hands
about" to distract the audience from what is really going on, just like a
politician will try to distract his audience from the truth.  

So, anytime someone wants to distract you from what\'s really going on (for
whatever reason) and they use theatrics, diagrams, rhetoric, hand gestures,
emotional speeches, calls to patriotism, statistics (real or made up), or
plausible sounding explanations they are "handwaving."

We Traveller folk, use it to explain how jump drives, gravitics, thrusters,
heplar, and so on work.  We don\'t *really* know how they work, but to
maintain our player\'s suspension of belief we give them a reasonable
sounding explanation.  A good "handwave" should be internally
self-consistent, so as to not allow them to come up with those big
game-breaking tricks, otherwise we have to "handwave" why those tricks
won\'t work.  ;->

Does that explain it?  Good!  My arms where getting tired. ;->

	K.W.Jeter\'s novel Bladerunner 3: Replicant Night had some 
interesting ideas concerning used jump drives - they became _the_ 
environmental hazard of the time. As jump drives are based (at 
least partially) on gravitics, they create a sharp bend in 
the space-time fabric.

	However, space-time fabric doesn\'t just bounce back into normal
shape once the drive is disengaged, but leaves a temporal anomaly
with the drive. After a couple of longer jumps, the drive and the
rest of the ship are shifting and flickering on and off existence
and produce severe temporal side effects.

Hello,
  N. Oz also has easy sea access for cheap transport of materials
down from the rest of the System. What prevents equatorial islands
in Indonesia from providing the same capability?

  Probably either coast of South America would be a great site,
but neither is likely to be able to compete economically with
whatever facility gets built in the continental U.S. Equally,
unless the U.S. wants Pacific coverage, there is unlikely to
be major civilian unloading capacity in Hawaii.

  A question for list discussion is whether major wars or

  Umm, I don\'t have to be anti-anything to point out that GDP is a
singularly unhelpful stat, and GNP is no real improvement. For the
"national power capability" debate (dice help us) actual potential
outputs count for a lot, among various "soft" factors.

  Quite right, I hope. Methinks the Russians will recover before

But in Imperium, the war game of the Interstellar wars, the Villani are
forbidden from building any ships larger than cruisers without the
Emperors permission.  Presumably the Ishimkarun does not trust his
provincial governors with heavy ships for fear they will use them to
rebel.  From what Traveller has said about the disintegrating nature of
the First Empire at this time this makes sense.

  How can you be demoralized, when you know it\'s not true? :) All

Its a science term describing a scienntist describing his theory that has a
lot of holes and badly defined stuff. The scientist will typically show a
lot with his hands to cover up the lack of facts.
In traveller it refers to the technobabble we sometimes use to
scientifically justify some game mechanic or story background that doesn\'t
fit physical principles.

Why doesn\'t fuel efficiency go up with TL the same as with fusion drives?
Well, eh err the term fuel is actually hm err displacement mass ah yes
therefore the term displacement ton and um it creates a bubble of
spacetime-vortex-gravity-soliton-thingy-gizmo that enables the jump.

I find Indonesia an interesting case, because it is one of the few cases
where a nation state exists through the efforts of a single institution -
the armed forces (the ABRI). I find it easy to imagine that interstellar
states may exist where the Navy is and sees itself as the sole unifying factor
preserving a transtellar state. This runs into quite a bit of earlier thought
on the TML about an "Imperial" culture coming into existance - a cosmopolitan
culture transmitted through the trans-Imperial institutions of the IN, the
IISS, the TAS and the megacorporations.

A collapse of Indonesia into feuding ethnic and religious groups isnt the
bugbear for Australian military security some people think it is ...
the disruption from the refugees would arguably be greater. The air-sea
gap between the Indoneasian archipelago and anywhere worthwhile in
Australia is just too great (northern Australia is basically jungle and
desert, and the number of vital transport links can be counted on the
fingers of both hands). The resource richness of Australia is in many
ways a myth IMO, and the empty bits of Australia are empty for a damn
good reason (viz, there is no bloody water, and it is a huge long way
from anywhere).

The next issue is whether it includes the African Meditteranean states. Turkey

Lots of countries with little to no infrastructure, and lots of mutual

emnities than on dealing with external matters. Lets not forget the

I actually think that the SE Asian countries are going to act together
as a bloc more and more in the future. I can easily see that list happening,
but minus China, Japan and Korea. South East Asia has several common
interests (eg China and India), and common interests are always a good
start when considering co-operation.

PE did spend "pages and pages" on the War chapter - eight, plus just
under two pages of charts. It is a *lot* weaker than the rest of PE.

My quick fixes are ...

(1) Allow units to be built according to Orders of Magnitude ... any unit
that is outnumbered by 10:1 dies in the first round of combat. However,
this does let small worlds have military units and fight each other.

(2) Maintainence is 10% of unit cost per year at War readiness, and 2% of
unit cost per year when Mothballed. I find it a bad design decision that
a TL12 unit costs 2% of price per year at War maintainence while a TL6 unit
costs 0.2% of unit price per year at War maintainence.

(3) A unit needs it\'s (cost/200) in TRN points to transport.

Does anyone else perceive the influence of the nation state diminishing?  
The globalisation through trade, free movement of capital, etc, are 
increasing the influence of corporations.  Even now, I\'m sure the biggest 
companies can affect countries\' economies as much as their governments.

Case in point: Unilever is the world\'s tenth biggest employer - employing 
three times as many people as, for example, the entire British armed

influential than many governments, I\'d say.

OK, thanks, I understand now.  The deceleration is uniform (assuming

Coherent light must be monochromatic, but I don\'t think the reverse 
is true.  If you combine photons of the same frequency and random 
phase, you ought to get a monochromatic beam of strongly varying
intensity, as the phase differences interfere.  Or am I forgetting 
something important here?

(Only really bothered by electron and proton waves recently...)

For the record, why\'s that?  Is the dispersion likely to be higher 
than for e.g. IR/vis lasers?

As opposed to the highly likely TL9 jump drive, you mean? 8-)

I would assume that if one can produce both local decreases and 
increases in the gravitational field, it is possible to combine 
devices which do this so as to create highly intense local fields
which don\'t obey an inverse square law.

Crude example: let\'s take a point source which generates a change in 
gravitational field of +4g at 1 unit from the source.  Three units away 
from the source, we put point sources which generate -1g at 1 unit 
distance

Total field has the following values:

Distance  Field
   1      +3.75g
   2        0g
   4      -0.75g

whereas the unmodified 4g field would have generated

Distance  Field
   1       +4g
   2       +1g
   4      +0.25g

You can imagine a second set of small +ve point sources being used to 
"smooth out" the fluctuations from introducing the -ve points, and so
not quite ad infinitum, but perhaps until the effect is negligible.

I would expect equipment to produce intense local fields to require
volume proportional to G^3/2 where G is a measure of gravitational
field strength, or maybe G^2.  A large fraction of the power required
would be used in "damping" the field, using a 3D analogue of the 
above technique.

Thanks for the explanation (and thanks too to Andy Brick for a 
similar one).  A "wiggled" B-field would probably produce a 
laser-like effect -- the field intensity would govern wavelength
(for a given velocity of electron beam) and the wiggling would 
provide the coherence.

    That\'s kinda the point.  I\'d like T4.1 to HAVE such a game mechanic.  As it

I\'d urge that M:E21 avoided it as far as possible.

Has anyone found data in S&A or AM6 which contradicts/supports what\'s 
already been said?

Free electron lasers use electron beams and varying magnetic fields so
that the "waving" of the electrons due to the mag fields (aided by the
resonances designed into the laser cavity) *directly* produce the
desired wavelength of EM radiation.

For a fixed installation, FE lasers are the best bet for high power.

Easiest solution that I can see is that it\'s a "field effect", and
either "borrows" energy from the electrostatic repulsion, or some other
handwave. That would have the nucleons move apart, but not as
violently, and let the SF return after they were too far apart for it
to force them back together.

Actually, the bit about aborted females is purely cultural. The culture
does *not* consider females to be of any worth. Several other male
dominated cultures are using sex selection, but since they don\'t have
limits on family size, it\'s not as noticeable.

China is exerting *major* efforts to lower population. As I recall,
couples are allowed *one* child. They know they\'ve got too many people
and are willing to be pretty draconian about reducing population.

And trying to reduce population. They are quite likely to succeed, but
for a very unfortunate reason. They haven\'t gotten too far pushing
family planning. At the same time, though there\'s no official word
about it, the number of well-to-do Indians seeking treatment outside
the country for "odd" ailments that their doctors can\'t seem to figure
out is fairly high. And the cause of the "odd ailments" is AIDS...

A lot of the third world is going to have *major* population crashes
due to AIDS in the next decade or two.

I\'d bet on Brazil to be spacefaring long before the rest of South
America. And being on the Equator gives them an advantage.

Likewise, *somebody* is going to try setting up a launch site in New
Guinea (high mountains, on or near the equator). Australia would be a
good bet as a partner in such a venture. Possibly an Aussie/Japanese
partnership. 

I also don\'t see the Russians dropping out of the space business. Their
launching services are one of their major sources of foreign exchange
right now. 

One possible "joker" in the deck is that if space resources become
important before oil ceases to be a major commodity, the Arabs are
definitely smart enough (and rich enough!) to set up their own program
so that when oil is unimportant, they can use space resources of some
sort to maintain their income. Hell, they could be the ones to finally
fund Solar Power Satellites!

Did you perchance catch my highly unoffical history of the IWs?
The way I saw things was that during the first three wars the
Vilani provincial government regarded the Terrans as little more
than a large pirate haven (incidentally probably not too far from
the truth) and treated it accordingly. The Terrans long range
raiding was at best pinpricks, but over the course of several
years, those pinpricks could start to add up and the Vilani\'s
war balance sheet move into the red. When this happened, the
Vilani governor would be willing to make peace for some minor
territorial losses.

>>Perhaps most importantly - the Vilani are demoralised by contact with a

>to pay our fees, uh, the fleet? In case we get lonely, yeah..."

Almost certainly the concept that the Terrans could have developed
jump drive independently would have been inconcievable to the Vilani.
They would assume despite the Terrans claims that they must have
somehow copied it from them or one of their clients. Again another
factor in the Terrans favour "These Terrans just copy our technology,
they\'ll never actually develop any of their own".

>>Indeed the Vilani must believe Terra to be a hell-world of bizarre
>>technologies, sociopathic lunatics and pandemic plagues. No wonder the
>>Vilani never launched an invasion of Earth! In fact, they may have

The biowar element would be the Terrans "ace in the hole". Not only do
they have far superior biological and medical technology, but they also
have access to the largest resevior of pathogens and organisms specifically
evoloved to attack humans in the galaxy; and further more the Terrans have
natural immunity to most of them. The Terrans could easily geneer a pathogen
to attack the Vilani from some minor aliment such as flu or the common cold.
It would have virtually no effect on Terrans but be devastating to the
Vilani. Also since Vilani medical science is so far behind the Terrans,
the Vilani would find developing counter measures very hard. Take Typhus
for instance. Amongst populations with natural immunity the fatality rate
is something like 10% to 20% without treatment, with Terran populations
without natural immunity it can go as high as 40%; just what would it do
to the Vilani who have never encountered any organism remotely like it?
Small pox is another good one. The Terrans have a very good vaccine and
high natural immunity (if you catch chicken pox as a child you have a good
immunty against small pox). Drop a few aerosol bombs over some crowded
Vilani cities and bingo, a pandemic that puts the Black Death to shame.
I don\'t think the Terrans ever would have actually done that, but it would
make for a **very** powerful deterant. What I think the Terrans would have
done is used debilitating non-leathal biowar agents. Drop one on a world you
want to take and watch it\'s infrastucture collapse as they try to cope
with 80% of their population sick in bed. Sure they\'ll get better in a few
weeks, but by then the Terran troops have landed and are in control.

What goes wrong is that the rumors about Varian\'s death split the rest of
the Imperium and prevents Lucan from having enough clout to defeat Dulinor.
And his subsequent errors of judgement dosen\'t help much. If Varian had
survived he\'d propably even have accepted Strephon\'s return (He wouldn\'t
have any reason to fear him).

   China is a *big* place.  Crossing China is not like walking down to the 
corner chemist.  The one-child rule is in strict effect in the cities and 
other areas where Big Brother is close and hand and firmly in control.
Out in the boonies, implementation is still in progress.

I\'d agree to this completely.  I think that the nation-state itself will
shrink to smaller units ( ie Scotland breaking from the UK ) and that
corporations ( particularly those who are spacefaring ) will rule the day
by and large.

As I posted in another post, the books of Allen Steele are a good example
of how I would invision this occuring.  In his books there is a rather
powerful corporation called SkyCorp which pretty much does as it pleases (
even though, in thsoe books, the governments are still more of a force to
be reckoned with than I believe they would be ).

Small black holes are dead thanks to Hawkins radiation but there are lots
of SF stories about them flying around.

 Yes, thats how they do it but as the electrons are accelerated not in a
single direction a lot of the bremsstrahlung will be wasted and therefore
you\'d never even in theory get above (or even near) 50% efficiency.

As I\'m sure eight people have already said by the time you read this, 
IIRC it\'s fundamentally because the diameter of the beam is 
dependant on wavelength.  A laser beam viewed side-on looks like a 
rubber strap that you\'ve taken in both hands and stretched - widest 
at the ends and narrowest in the middle.  One end is the projecting 
lens/array, and the bit you want to hit the bad guys with is the 
\'waist\' (the narrowest part - AKA the focus).  As the wavelength 
decreases, the size of the waist for a given size of projecting lens 
decreases, but unfortunately the distance from the lens to the waist 
decreases.

In short, as you decrease the wavelength you move the focus closer.

It\'s also possible that I completely misremembered those lectures, 
it\'s been a while since it last mattered.

Yes you might be right but think of the PE rules as they stand:
As exchange rates favour buying military stuff from low TL systems and the
fact that the cost to move them is the same per combat factor then we\'ve
suddenly got a reason why there are so many low TL planets in Trav. If you
want a ground war you simply buy mercenaries from the lowest TL possible
due to favourable exchange rates. Imagine huge starships filled with
battlecrazed stoneagers ready to do battle. Feels a bit like Warhammer 40K
AD don\'t it.

Yes I am insinuating that this PE rule is blatantly wrong and calling it
not a "bug" but a "feature" is laughable. The same was said about the
equally weird infrastructure not depending on pop but on size rule!
Please, admit your faults when they\'re pointed out instead of burying the
head in the sand.

When the black globes are fully ON they\'re ignoring gravity according to CT
canon (I\'m not shure where I read it but it\'s in some pretty old stuff -
possibly JTAS). They\'re not gaining any energy this way (I\'d say) because
conservation of potential energy is totally broken by J-drives,
thrusterplates etc anyways. Stars proper motion seem also to be ignored
when jumping etc.

I tend to ignore black globes as much as I can as they invoke relativistic
handwaving from square one.

	First, the Wendelstein is a \'stellarator\' type fusion test
reactor, which uses external magnetic coils to compress and contain the
plasma in a toroidal configuration. A Tokomak uses the plasma itself to
compress and contain itself by running large currents through the plasma
generating the requisite magnetic fields.

	In theory, a Tokomak is capable of self sustaining fusion reaction
with fewer parts to the reactor, and thus would be more reliable. Alas, we
have found that, with fusion, the leap twixt theory and practice has been
a long hard one. Current designs do take more energy to run than they
produce. But, once started, you can generate larger and larger magnetic
fields by feeding the current the thing is producing back into itself,
thus, a self sustaining tokomak will be more stable than one that isn\'t
self sustaining.

However, I\'m ignorant of all but the most basic details of current fusion
research, and so cannot begin to claim thatI know that one is inherently
better than the other.

I do know that the \'stellrator\' type of reactor wasn\'t at all feasable
until relatively recent advances in magnetic technology, and shows a great
deal of promise _if_ we can get room temp, or near room temp
superconductors.  

Both types of reactor are still dealing with the major problem of keeping
the plasma from contacting the walls of the plasma chamber, simultaneously
cooling the plasma tremendously, and contaminating it horribly.
Controlling the plasma is on the order of balancing a broomstick on your
fingertip...while riding in the back seat of an F-14 during a dogfight.

Jerry Pournelle wrote a novel using precisely that concept some years
ago...which title escapes me now (Oath of Fealty perhaps?), but the
Arcologies were the comfortable, secure suburbia. And we\'re heading that
way faster than you know... 

Finally, people seem to have a view of arcologies that is extensively
dystopian...there\'s no reason on earth that an arcology needs to be a
\'sardine can\' Most people living in luxury high rises don\'t seem to regard
them as \'sardine cans\', and an arcology isn\'t much more than an apartment
highrise, with an office building attached, sitting on top of the Mall Of
America...with a few grocery stores in there, and it\'s own subway station.

Think of how much time we already spend indoors in an urban environment.

[Welcome back, Doug!]
I find about half to 2/3rds of it interesting and/or useful (less when
there\'s a big rules or hardware debate, more when there\'s something like
the M21 discussion).  That\'s fine; I just skip the rest.

Definitely.  This was the only period I\'ve run/played in, though Pocket
Empires is changing that.  It\'s also got a more upbeat feel than MT/TNE,
which can be refreshing (and which is back in M0).

Just the former for me, really.  Though the Rebellion Sourcebook got me

previously.

Hm.  TNE is the one I mostly just pick odd bits from.

Again, just the former for me.  Though I am looking forward to Naval

Different people\'s minds work in different ways; it\'s not something I
have trouble with, but then other people can manage things that I can\'t.

Three comments about the Chinese "one child" rule.  First, the Chinese have
said consistently that the planet will do just fine with a population of 30
to 40 billion..they aren\'t looking to shrink their population, just slow it
down while they develop.  Second, the "one child" per family is tied to tax
and social services incentives..poor country families still find it a *net*
benefit to have several sons, and even though it is discouraged there isn\'t
a requirement that families stop with one child..many don\'t.  Third,
daughters aren\'t considered worthless..just worth less..and a strategy of
per and post partum abortion is a dirty big not-so-secret secret..this is
will be a problem down the road.

So Robert, unless you want to postulate massive die-offs, from disease or
war, in China and India you need to double, or triple, your estimates for
their populations.  While you\'re at it cut their economic power by, at
least, fifty percent.

Comments on your figures and other things:  Europe is underpopulated and
probably under rated economically.  US is overpopulated (unless you include
Mexico and Canada in your definition of the US..I wouldn\'t) and it\'s
economic rating is too low.  Don\'t expect Spanish SA to unify, unless it\'s
to defend itself from Brazil, which you should include as a major regional
player.  Russia, as a union or Empire, is going to be in the game.  The
African states (except *maybe* South Africa) aren\'t going to get anywhere
until tribalism dies out, and I don\'t see that happening anytime soon.  The
Arabs have similar problems, they\'ll have money if the oil counties will
share (they won\'t), but there are so many ethnic, religious and cultural
grudges among them that I can\'t see them ever uniting longterm.  Japan has
hit a wall, they need room and resources to keep growing (the same problem
they had in the 30\'s)..space *might* give it to them, because they will be
hard pressed to get any on Earth. Australia can be a regional power, but
that\'s all.  India...poor India, I have no idea if India\'s middle class can
survive resting on the back of a billion desperately poor people struggling
to survive.

Andrew, you make a good point, but you don\'t take it far enough.  The
Terrans wouldn\'t have to distribute diseases with aerosol bombs, all they
would have to do is sneeze.

Whenever the Terrans interact with the Vilani they will be carrying all
those childhood diseases that we catch and shrug off, like chicken pox,
measles, mump. Diseases that absolutely destroyed natives in the Americas
and the Pacific islands.  The effects on the Vilani will be every bit as
bad as the effects the European explorers had on isolated native
populations. 

Then there is the common cold...the Vilani will have NO immunity to any of
the cold and flu viruses.  What percentage of Terrans die from a new strain
of flu?  Not a huge number usually, but the Flu of 1919-20 killed millions,
among the Vilani it would kill whole planets.

Then there is our friend E-coli, we carry strains of it around in our
guts..*we* probably couldn\'t live without it. If we travel a few hundred
miles and "drink the water" we\'re likely to shallow a *slightly* different
strain of the bacteria and we get very sick. We can\'t keep food down, we
get dehydriated, we get so sick we can\'t take care of ourselves, and in
serious cases if somebody doesn\'t take care of us we die.  Imagine exposing
any Vilani to *any* of our little friends?  

Notice we haven\'t even gotten to the diseases *we* consider deadly.

If you want my opinion, it will take the Vilani several generations to
adapt to the dieases of Terra, and it quote a song from a few years ago,
"...but there weren\'t near as many as there were a while ago."

Eris

ps. I have an alternative to the beginning contacts between the Terrans and
Vilani, that is *much* different from what I\'ve been seeing suggested here. 
Andrew, I absolutely *loved* your outline though. ;->  I\'ll try to write it
up and post it. --

If these numbers drop it will not be due to AIDS or wars. Influenzas are

Starvation of significance is also unlikely, except by their own governments

As far as GNP (it is a fair measure of economic power) China (at current

At the moment, a tokamak is a very big fusion plant that burns graduate
students to produce energy.  :)

To be a bit more serious, they are pretty useless for energy production at
the moment, as IIRC, they can contain plasma to the densities needed for
commercial fusion power, but they still need far more power than they
produce.  This is, I believe, more an engineering problem than a physics
problem - the underlying physics is tolerably well understood, now we need
designs that approach the theoretical models.

If, as, and when they get those designs, Tokamaks have a lot to recommend
them.

in the process, opened a big can of worms.

I though, "As long as I am fixing the strange data, why not take a look at
stellar type, planet size, and so on?"

Silly me.

I am going to post the fruits of my labors, but I wanted to post a short
summary first, to give the astrophysicists a chance to tell me of any blind
alleys before I tread down them.

I need proportions for the various stars out there.  I have a distribution
based off of an HR diagram in a 1987 book, but I am not convinced this will
make me happy.

I then need to generate the planetary systems.  I am working from a Bode\'s
law approach, because I seem to recall from Astro 101 that a working theory
is that the first big body in the system sets up where all the other bodies
will end up.  In our system, it ended up that there are three potentially
habitable planet orbits.

From this, assume ten orbits that have bodies of interest, and that those
orbits almost certainly have something of size 1 or greater in them.  The
orbital distances are set by placing the biggest thing in the system,
making it one of the orbits, and all the others fall out from Bode\'s law.

Further, assume that gas giants can have a little flock of moons, of which
perhaps 3 +/- 1 of any twenty are of significant size.

Gas giants: we want ~80% of the systems to have them, according to cannon,
so how about 1D-1?  If the gas giant is in the near or habitable zone, it
has best be large.  The moons might be habitable.

Planetary belts - I think they are inevitable near a brown dwarf, and
likely near a big gas giant, so 1D3-1 per system?  Perhaps 80% of
existence, and 1D3 if exists?  I have no strong feeling, and not enough
theory.

Given that the gas giants have something like 99.?% of the mass in the
planetary system, and some amazing fraction of the angular momentum, there
is no reason to assume that the average sizes of the planets we see here
are typical.  Even a slight imbalance could have doubled or halved the
sizes of the rocky bodies in the system.  Because I like earthlike planets,
I am assuming that the size of earth is typical, I am working on
distributions where most planets range fairly uniformly from size 3 to size
12 or so.  As a result, most systems will have at least one, and likely
three or four planets with gravity somewhere close to human norms.

Atmosphere - from tables in the astro books, plus the delightful "World
Building" book, I have gotten the idea that nothing below size 3 is going
to have a human breathable atmosphere over the long term.  I am working on
distributions for the pressure, and am willing to assume across the board
that 25% of all atmospheres are tainted in some way.

Hydro - No strong feelings, but there seems to be a lot of ice in the
universe.  Perhaps a mild push towards more middling values.

I intend to add resource and life ratings to planets as well, so that one
can know just how good a place actually is after a preliminary survey.

So, anyone who actually knows this stuff want to point out any flaws so
far, so I can fix them before going further?

What Glenn didn\'t add was that at a 1.8% growth rate that 5.5 billion
balloons to 34.5 billion by 2100.  Personally, I think that exceeds the
Earth\'s carrying capasity, and there will be some Malthusian hell to pay,

Yep, a hugh mall area covering the lower couple of floors, hotels and
convention centers around the outside of the next few floors, office
complexs rising up the center, and rings of garden apartments around lower
priced inner apartments further up.  Stores, shops, government offices,
mini-malls, churchs, and recreation areas strategicly placed here an there
as you go up.  You could spend almost your entire life in one of these

The BBC manages to blur the distinction between the various nations in the

IIRC Vilani and Vargr explains the Sirka/Sirkaa difference as changing the
emphasis to mean \'restored\' in the second case...

Yes! I actually look forward to this more than M0 stuff... Must be the
T2300 GM in me. I do think that you should blur E21 and the Interstellar
Wars together, else the feel could end up being too claustrophobic for a
very long term campaign.

I tried sending a complete copy of his request, my (polite) reply, and his
asinine response to it to his postmaster.

Utter failure - apparently, they did not define postmaster, and I could not
find a whois record for them.  The second copy went to root.  I suppose I
could threaten to send a half a billion "Please send me information on your
nose hair clippers" messages to various cyberpromo sites, but I have a
feeling that this would lose me the moral high ground.

Pity, as it is so tempting.  I suppose I will stick to just being a polite
usenet admin, though, and try root and postmaster addresses at other
machine up the line.

This, I think, is why most SF/gaming worlds do not accept data and info
feeds from other worlds.  Can you IMAGINE the spam resulting from 30
billion people?

We may be differing on interpretation. No matter how I tried to image it, I
could not get comfortable with Jump as a different form of space. My own
handwaving explanations on what the jump fuel was used for, what would be
seen outside the ship during a jump, and why you couldn\'t intercept a ship
in jump just did not fit with out calling jump an effect instead of a space. 

I did not begin to develop a final, satisfying explanation until I ran
across a book called \'The Iron Sun\' by Adrian Berry (1977). It was the first
one I found in which the idea of skipping thru space time distortions caused
by black holes. This is where I started the explanation I posted earlier in
the form of Professor Davros intoductory lecture on Jump Theory. The arrival
of \'Secret of the Ancients\' with pocket universes and teleporting by
twisting space time to match up entry and exit points confirmed my feelings
about this explanation for Jump. 

The ideas in the Iron Sun, Grandfather\'s pocket universes & teleports all
are based on distortion of space time, an effect of gravity. This melded the
idea that gravitics and Jump are related. When 2300 came out with
Stutterwarp, even though the analog was to electron tunnelling, the only
logical way I saw to achieve it was by rapid short distance space time
distortions, micro jumps. A field effect touching every atom within it
leaves you facing the same Heisenberg (sp?) principle that chucks Star Trek
type transporters into the fantasy realm instead of the science fiction realm.

It fits my view of the Traveller universe. It adds a layer of consistancey
to the universe; gravitcs are key to several technologies. Early gravitics
gives you some benefits without handing out aircars as soon as it appears.

It certainly eleminates the question of what all that Lhyd is for.

That reminds me...I got the numbers wrong. Those little limes aren\'t

The civilian models only pack 2.4MJ\'s (20d6) explosive force.  Of course, I

<g> Yeah, I did too. Then when I got *the* response, I emailed a complaint
to his postmaster, with a cc to him.  The postmaster wouldn\'t accept the
message..and an autoreply said "cremark\'s" address was full..couldn\'t
accept more mail.

True, they could not build anything larger than a cruiser, but what was the
First Imperiums tonnage classifications for ships? Supplement 9, fighting
ships of the Imperium gives us the THIRD Imperium\'s classifications, but
what were the FIRST Imperium\'s? A 3I cruiser could be in the same tonnage
class as a 1I  destroyer.

	It looks like this guy has an automatic mail response set up. It could be
he is away on holiday and not back for a while, or there may be some other
explanation.

	The PC\'s have to use a combination of computer skill and lots of detective
work to track down the location of this irritating user on Sol\'s computer
net. They will find that they have to travel to Singapore, where the user
is actually an old tramp who lives under a bush with a laptop and a mobile
phone with fax / data facilities. The tramp will explain that he has been
trying to post a bug-free version of all the T4 rule books to TML, but as
they only exist in grandfather\'s pocket universe, he was unable to obtain
them and realised that no one will ever get to see them. This got him
particularly miffed with the whole thing, and he says that this is his way
of lashing out. Before the PC\'s get a chance to unhook his connection, he
will attempt to press his delete key. Roll D6 to see what this does to the
net. On a 1 etc...

Trouble is *finding* agents that are that mild. Given that the Vilani
have 300,000 years of isolated development, the odds are strong that
anything that causes noticeable illness in Terrans will be life
threatening to Vilani (check the experiments that raised animals in a
sterile environment). So you\'d have to use Vilani as guinea pigs to
find some organism that we aren\'t affected by at all (100% immunity)
that they have enough immunity to to survive.

Isaac Asimov told a lovely story about his novel _The Caves of Steel_.
TCoS is set in a future New York which is entirely enclosed (and mostly
underground); it\'s also rather crowded and \'cramped\' in feeling.  Soon
after the book was published, a fan asked him how he had come to write
about this dystopia.  Asimov double-taked..."Dystopia?  What dystopia?"
You have to understand that Asimov disliked open spaces, was thrilled to
live in deepest, densest Manhattan, and did most of his writing in an
attic garret too low-ceilinged to stand upright in.

In other words, one man\'s hell is another man\'s heaven...

  The Malthusian case assumes that the capacity for improved
agri-yields was exhausted around 1795. However, for the Third
World this case seems substantially accurate. They won\'t be able
to afford and won\'t be given geneered crops (Monsanto isn\'t a
charity), nor are they likely to develop other industries to
pay for food supply augmentation. While segments of their
population (assembly-line workers in Japanese or American
owned factories, bureaucrats, professionals) may be able to
hang on, that will only last until the society as a whole
collapses. Of course, the original theory hasn\'t been
exemplified yet either.

        Yours truly,
                Steven Hudson

  That\'s the one - that\'s what I meant about economics, as in OoF the
arcology was a _big_ real estate venture.

  Agreed. I don\'t think it would be horrible, but the outside
conditions driving the process may very well be. But a lot of
people do view apartments and townhouses as being too cramped.
In fact, an arcology can have _lots_ of floor space - even at
modest heights a too high density will lead to access problems
if based on individual vehicles, and certainly marketing problems
in NorAm.

Finally, I\'ve finished updating my Traveller Web Site (for now). It
features new Library Data entries and more worlds that have appeared in

Library Data now contains 723 seperate entries, still extensively
hyperlinked!

The list of worlds now has 1039 references to systems appearing in
Traveller \'canon\' - that\'s about 10% of all the worlds in the Imperium!

Also at the site: Robots with pictures now in color! Deckplans for the
Nishemani Class Corsair!

The advantage of an equatorial launch site is marginal. The additional
launch velocity from planetary rotation is only a few dozen km/s, which a 1
G drive can match in seconds. Launch sites will be located wherever
convenient for passengers and industries. Equatorial launch sites are only
useful for beanpoles or space elevators, which become economically unviable
after the invention of HEPlaR at TL 10.

how about

Current UN estimates place earth\'s pop at (mid. 1996) 5.77 Billion. An 
important thing to remember is that the growth rate is *declining*. Peak 
growth rate has been reached, we are beginning a long "levelling off" 
process. 

That 1.8% growth rate that Glenn C. cites is outdated. Between 1990 and 
1995 the world population grew at 1.48 per cent per annum, below the 
1.72% per annum at which population had been growing between 1975 and 
1990, which stands as the peak period in the history of world population 
growth. Growth rate in less developed regions is 1.77 per cent per annum.

Right now there are 10 nations with greater than 100 million: China, 
India, USA, Indonesia, Brazil, Russia, Pakistan, Japan, Bangladesh, and 
Nigeria. According to the medium-fertility varient projection, by the 
year 2050, seven more countries will have crossed that mark: Ethiopia, 
Iran, Zaire, Mexico, Philippines, Viet Nam and Egypt.

The UN projects a world population of 9.4 billion in 2050, nearly 
half-a-billion lower than projected in 1994.

Here\'s some milestones I gleaned from the UN Population Info. gophers 
(that 34.5 billion M2100 figure is out to lunch!) Note that World 
Population is projected to stabilize at 11.6 billion by just after 2200.

  Only if nation states are the only major actors and the resource
bearing under-developed countries can lock down control of their
economies. More realistically, they\'ll get screwed selling to the
markets and companies of the First World, and if they attempt to
re-write the rules they\'ll be punished, brutally if necessary,
until they change their minds. It ain\'t pretty, but I\'m sufficiently
confident of the systems perpetuation to not worry about a future
decline in my standard of living.

  In all seriousness, would the U.S. _not_ have a major spaceport
capacity in the lower 48? Would they rely on Mexico, Panama, or
Ecuador, if the country in getting weren\'t a satellite or willing
to grant extra-territoriality?

  The UN Law of the Sea (unratified by U.S. still?) would still
allow any company to mine/exploit/use international seabed, and
ship the product home, or sell on the free market. That is, the
Indonesians are probably still screwed, but the US and Japan are
quite well looked after [Canada too :) ].

  I would strongly suggest that no single modern corporation would
undertake such a venture. A consortium (or zaibatsu) might do so
under special conditions (Pentagon cost-plus, or MITI) but projects
like such are typically beyond most MNC\'s interests. The Apollo
project, OTOH...

If the blackglobes can mask gravity (as implied by really old canon stuff)
then they wont be detected when injumping but they\'ll give the save huge
gravitywave when switching off the black globe so no big deal. Flickering
black globes would produce enormous square wave gravitywaves detectable by
mass detectors systemwide. This seems pretty strange to me so despite what
canon says I think we let gravity get through black globes (thus allowing
high tech ships to hurt one-another with pulsed tractors etc and also to
senso when the globe is 100% on using mass detectors.

It is easy to pinpoint an injumping ships location by stationing several
mass detectors in the system and triangulating when the gravity wave hits
each sensor. Then they\'ll know where the ship jumped in but not where it is
going as it\'s normal sigs will not be detectable at AU+ distances.
Pretty cool think I: Most systems with good starports and all with
scoutbases/naval bases will have massdetector ships/stations spread out
throughout the system (maybe 5 or 6) that will monitor traffic. The
amplitude of the gravity wave will tell you what displacement the ship has
and the wave shape its J-nbr.

This is not a good idea.  If you check Deja News you will find a message
from some list admin somewhere indicating that this person and one other
have been subscribed to lots of mailing lists without their permission
or knowledge.  Hopefully Rob has unsubbed this person now, since he is
obviously not interested in doing it himself.  As someone else pointed
out he is almost certainly not even reading any of his mail at the
moment.

In all likelihood it is this persons abbrasive and ignorant attitude
that caused some other idiot to subscribe him to so many lists, but this
does not make it smart to further propogate this matter by further
bothering him.

Nevertheless, Jumpspace is a canonical "fact".  I guess it boils down to what =

Heisenberg stated that you could not know _everything_ about a particle
or group of particles without changing their properties in some manner.

However, this is unimportant as regards Stutterwarp. Consider a balloon -
I can move the balloon and all of the air inside it without any knowledge 
of the properties of the various particles it envelops. In other words, I
can generate a field that affects a system of particles without needing
to know much if anything about that system. Think of magnetically 
confined plasma as another example of a "dumb" field that touches
every atom within its domain without violating Heisenberg. If I move the
field, I move the plasma. Now, while I agree that 
the "Heisenberg compensators" in ST are VERY suspect scientifically,
I see no problem with a "dumb" field moving everything along with itself.

It\'s no more than a container.

I pointed out the changes i made in the spaces below the data, along with the reasoning and

Namechanges where only made when sufficient evidence pointed out that the particuar world
had that name back in the time of M:0 as well.
The Changes made are according to Canon, and logic (Barren Worlds usually have no tech
and Starport), if they do, they are an exception. I have removed all TL and Starports from
Barren worlds, but feel that a few could be reinstated later (Discussion on TML or MM-ruling))
I have found no planet with pop greater than A, have i overlooked any?
Some changes could still be discussed on this basis. Any comments?

So, now which sector data needs repairing?
AFAIK, Corridor (Me), Core(Me) and Massilia (Carlos) have been done already. Any other
TML\'ers volunteer for the other sectors? I hope we can finish this job soon, now the char-gen
and task system discussions have almost died down. That about leaves us with Antares,
Dargushaag, Delphi, Fornast, Gushemege, Ilelish, Lishun, Zarushagar and most importantly,
Vland (anybody with the TD issue that deals with Vland??). Any new volunteers?

You are operating under something of a misapprehension here. Sure,
European diseases *did* have a high lethality rate on Pacific
Islanders who had never been exposed to them before, up to 90% for
some of what we would think of as "childhood" diseases. HOWEVER,
that\'s a "kill" rate NOT an "infection" rate.

In other words, somewhere between 5% and 90% of (based on experiences
in the Pacific Islands) of those who *catch* these diseases die. This
is NOT the same as 90% of the population dying off!!!

Diseases simply do not work like that.

Might I suggest that you look at --

"Plagues and Peoples" by William H. McNeill

Which is a bit dated, but I\'m not aware of anything more up to date
that is as accessible. (and if anyone knows of anytrhing more up to
date, emauil me, I\'d like to read it myself).=20

As a matter of interest the Spanish Flu killed, worldwide, perhaps 20
million people. Sounds like a lot, eh? But, wait a minute, what was
world population in 1918-20? Two Billion? (Close, I suspect) ... this
means that the Spanish Flu killed ... wait for it ... *one percent* of
the world\'s population!!!

Also note that the Spanish Flu was probably the worst, most lethal,
that is, pandemic in history ... it killed that many people on little
more than a year. This eclipses even the Bubonic Plague of the 1300\'s
which took 100 years (and multiple outbreaks) to reduce the population
of Europe by around 1/3rd (perhaps 20-30 million people).

So, we drop the Flu on a typical high-tech Vilani world with 2 Billion
people and kill 20 million. A public health disaster, but not one
likely to cause societal breakdown!

Also, as an interesting sidenote, the Spanish Flu evidently killed
only people between the ages of around 18 and 40 ... if your were
older or younger you didn\'t seem to either catch it or die of it (I
don\'t know which, the source I got that from didn\'t say).

Of course, the reverse is also true! The Vilani "version" of e coli
will have a similar deleterious effect on us ... "Vland\'s Revenge" so
to speak!

Much less, based on Pacific Islands and New World experiences -- a
generation at most.

Very true, which is why its such an advantage for the Terrans "This just
can\'t be happening, I don\'t care if our intelligence says they have Tl 12,
they just can\'t and that\'s that." Of course when it does become painfully
obvious that the Terrans have surpased them, the Vilani mindset carries
a huge amount of baggage that prevents them from reacting. Plus they have
no meaningful capablity to reverse engineer Terran technology, their
scientists just don\'t think that way. "Copy a meson gun? But we\'d be
infringing on patent".

You don\'t need 100% immunity, you just need effects on Terrans not too
"unplesant", a reasonable level of natural immunity boosted by a vaccine,
and a good treatment for it. We have a host of symbiotic bacteria and
viruses which would be good candidates for geneering (a Terran speciality)
into Vilani specific biowar agents. However, as you point out, testing them
would be a problem, but not insurmountable.

The most likely Vilani response would be to convoy. This would have the
effect of hurting trade all by itself, plus pull valuable military assests
out of the front line. Then there\'s all the warships tied down trying to
hunt down the pesky little raiders (a 10 to 1 ratio is not unreasonable).
Worse still, the Terrans initally control such a limited area, that doing
the same back is impractical.

Probably not. They\'d believe that someone had actually come a long and
handed jump drives to the Terrans. Which would make it inconvieable to them
that the Terrans could then improve their own tech by reverse engineering
Vilani items. When it became apparent that the Terrans could reverse
engineer, it would be equally inconvieable that the Terrans could improve
on their technology. When it became apparent that this was also false a very
real inferiority complex would likely set in. The way I see things is that
the Terrans would quickly build up a reputation for being "supermen" in the
Vilani mind. "You copy our technology, You change our technology, You live
with disease and you change yourselves. How can one fight an enemy such as
this" (A quote from an unknown Vilani prisoner during the Nth Interstellar
Wars).

I\'ve always seen the Terrans in the IW\'s as being more driven by ethical
concerns than the Vilani. The Terrans place a far higher emphasis on
individual freedom and have just recently emerged from the late 20th Century
insanity. The Vilani place their emphasis on the needs of the community and
have been ruling hordes of "lesser" races for thousands of years. Anyhow if
you want just the real estate, biowar is they way to go. That way you also
get vacant possession :*).

I\'ve always thought of the Vilani as being a relatively impassionate lot
when compaired with Terrans. The Vilani might wipe out a race for "good"
practical reasons; the Terrans would do it because they pissed them off :*).

I was actually only thinking of the Terrans deliberately using biowar agents,
but once the Terrans moved in on a planet the results would have been very
devestating for the Vilani (and all the other minor human races). I\'d
expect a die back (there\'s a quaint term for you) of greater than 50%. I
don\'t have the figures at my fingertips, but I believe that the Conquistadors
achieved something like that with the Mezoamericans and they were only
seperated by 30,000 years or so. I think it actually would have come as
quite an unpleasant shock to the Terrans. They conquer a planet and suddenly
everybodies dying. Not exactly the image one wants to project to the galaxy *).

Well, the Vilani must have E-coli and a host of other symbiotic microbes too.
After all they did come from Terra originally. so they would have some degree
of immunity, just not a hell of a lot.

This is the "real" reason for Solomani domination of the rim. These worlds
would have had a Vilani population at least an order of magnitude greater
than the entire Confederation, but along come our pals Influenza et al; and
hey presto the rim gets a whole lot less populated. The only way for the
Vilani to survive is to become Solomani. The Vilani culture makes them a lot
more vulnerable, all nicely prepackaged for disease.

    Okay, that\'s a major change for Melee from T4.0 where it specifically
states that Melee combat is for the use of hand held weapons.  How were you
planning to handle Melee weapons in T4.1 if I may be so bold as to ask?
    Understand I don\'t go out and run Martial Arts campaigns that happen to be
Traveller.  However a goodly number of my players over the years have been
Martial Artists an in lower tech cultures the development of this sort of thing
is pretty much guareenteed!  Just look at all the Hundreds of fighting styles
that have evolved around the world if you doubt me.

    India has a similar problem/practice, the practice now has a name.
Femicide, the murdering of infant or pre-infant girls because their sex is
inconvient.  If memory serves the World Health Organizations and a bunch of
Human Rights groups are estimating that the death toll runs into the tens of
millions by now, with no end in sight.  In India the ultrasound has begun
moving out into the countryside and the aborting of fetuses for sex selection
is an accepted and approved practice of the IMA.
    It\'s a cultural thing unfortunately, girls and women are simply not
considered as valuable by these cultures, or worse, expensive.  Throughout
their history there have always been more then enough women for men seeking
wives.  The question is can their societies, heck their cultures SURVIVE male
to female ratios of 3 to 5 or more to 1?

    No, you are quite correct, it IS a looming problem.  Those men are going to
want and demand women, in the traditional mold they grew up with.  And here we
sit in the West with a surplus of women... ::shudder:: The Pentagon is already
quietly putting contingency plans into place for this BTW.

    How about focused mirrors?  I remember back in the Boy Scouts using mildly
concave mirrors to start fires by focusing the sun\'s energy.  So is it possible
to convey that heat energy across a fabric which is containing the Hot Air?

    Never assume, that\'s for me BTW.  I forgot the entire list isn\'t in my game
and thus doesn\'t know the situtation...
    The situation is as follows... The PCs were passengers on a big liner which
had paused in this system to refuel at the planetary starport via shuttles the
liner had BTW.  After various skuddugery related to an old debt one of the
characters owed to a certain mobster and thus was supposedly being killed for,
and the rest of the group stumbling into the attempt... the PCs ended up in a
sabotaged lifecraft which they managed to keep from burning up on reentry but
was pretty badly wreaked on landing.  Thus they are trapped on this TL3 world,
on the other side of the planet from the minimal starport (D) facilities.
    The planet D-A96770-3 has the atmospheric taint of Too Much Oxygen at the
lower levels, enough to kill you rather quickly actually.  It\'t fairly
geologically active however so about 8% of the surface, in the form of mountain
tops and high platues, is above the Oxygen toxicity level and thus habitable.
And the locals use Hot Air Balloons to move from one safe area to another.
    Problem is the PCs seriously pissed off the locals where they landed and
have had to pretty much make their own balloon from scratch and are now trying
to sail it around the planet to get to the Starport.  So they can\'t use any
tech above about early TL4, knowledge of it is another matter entirely!
    Thus the Lady playing the academic came up with the bright idea of using
focused mirrors to heat the air inside their jury-rigged balloon to higher
temperatures then they\'ve been getting burning the equivalent of the local
swamp gas. ;) Especially since buying fuel to burn to keep the balloon in the
air is an expensive proposition to them.  FoEx; One of the natives took a wad
of ten Cr notes and used them as toilet paper, which really blew the Rogue
character\'s mind!
    But it\'s the focused mirror idea that\'s got me a bit stuck.  Her plan,
barring violations of the laws of physics OC, is to use a couple to catch the
local sunlight and focus it through the fabric and into the hot air interior.
Her reasoning being that if you can use focused sunlight to cook food.  You can
both she and I have seen it done before.  Then you can use it to heat air in an
enclosed space.  Perhaps even superheat it to 200 or 300+ over the air
surrounding the balloon for greater lift.
    That\'s where I, as the long suffering GM, get stuck trying to figure out if
it would work. ;)  In short... HELP!?!

A number of people seem to have totally misunderstood my post on the PE

Clearly I have to refrain from using sarcasm in my posts. Being a worker at
a large (telecommunications) corporation, and an avid reader of Dilbert
cartoons, renaming "bugs" as "opportunities" is an accepted way of life.
Obviously my post was meant to indicate that the transport "bug" was an
accepted fault of the system, but that (as per usual on the TML) someone
would come up with an acceptable fix. Clearly the message didn\'t get
interpreted that way.

The entire PE work was completed to a ridiculously short ("challenging")
development and play-testing time. PE has, to my knowledge, received a much
more positive reaction than most of the preceding T4 products.

Given that I\'m trying to finish yet another 101 book for publishing by
European GEN CON in the next week or so (plus all the tournaments and God
knows what else I\'m doing at the moment), plus starting the first
compilation of data for writing a World Design Handbook for IG, I really
honestly didn\'t have the time to sit down and redesign a fix for your
complaints about the war system.

given elsewhere in PE)

* IT IS BY NO MEANS INTENDED TO BE A REPLACEMENT FOR BRILLIANT LANCES,
BATTLE RIDER, FFW OR ANY OTHER STELLAR COMBAT SYSTEM.

* IT IS DELIBERATELY DESIGNED NOT TO SCARE OFF THE MULTITUDE OF READERS WHO
ARE NOT AVID WARGAMERS AND WHO DO NOT WANT TO CALCULATE EVERYTHING TO 35
DECIMAL PLACES

* DUE TO ITS SIMPLICITY, IT HAS A NUMBER OF PRETTY OBVIOUS FAULTS.

Note the last line. Admission of total liability. Stu and I worked on the
system and did the best we could in the time available. I wouldn\'t want to
have Stu blamed for anything, since I did the final editing. It\'s my fault,
all mine!

Thank you to those who have, rather than just complaining, suggested fixes.

FIrstly, the Spanish flu, and the Black Death, even were both handled by
people with some clue to the germ theory of disease...people were
quarantined, and the highest infection rates were in areas where lots of
people lived in close proximity...sort of like the Vilani way of communal
living. I\'m not sure that the Vilani have all that developed a system for
infectious disease, particularly as harsh (to them) a treatment as
quarantine.

Secondly, you don\'t need high death rates to make a disease an important
factor in warfare...all you need is to incapacitate enough people, by
making them sick, making them care for the sick, or making them do the
jobs of 5 or 6 people who are sick or caring for the sick to make
everything collapse. Not a fall down go boom kinda collapse, but it is
a distinct military advantage to have. Arranging a garbage strike two
weeks in advance of an attack will accomplish the same thing, in a highly
populated area.

(Spoken as a survivor of the Great New York Garbage Strike sometime in the
80\'s...there were piles of garbage 15-20 ft high in places...made getting
around the city _interesting_ to say the least. We had the biggest %#$@
rats for a while after that...)

 Yes, i\'d agree... I didn\'t even check for bases in my revisions, my

I think you would need to use the "basalt rock" method with the mirrors.

If you don\'t have something to focus the mirrors on, you need to focus
on a *point*
(i.e. a geometry style point ... infinitesimal), an impossibe task,
especially
at TL 4.  If you don\'t have a solid object to focus on, you run a GREAT
BIG HUGE
chance of burning a hole through the fabric of the balloon. (You would
need to focus
the mirrors up...through the normal heating hole or bye-bye balloon)  I
don\'t think your
characters want to plummet several hundred feet.

However, if the balloon fabric is able to handle the necessary
temperature without
burning a hole in it, you could just focus on the balloon.

I hope your characters don\'t run into cloudy weather at an inopportune
moment ;-)

There\'s an interesting White Dwarf scenario called Tower Trouble which had
a look at a terran beanstalk. Interesting criminal based adventure which
could result in having some dire environmental consequences. The beanstalk
touched down in the US, IIRC. I would advocate that a beanstalk is included
on Terra in the supplement.
