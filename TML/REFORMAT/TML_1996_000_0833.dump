    'body' => 'Multi-Player Games Network, our host for the mailing list, would like me to
post this announcment here.  They let us have this list for free, so one ad
in two years shouldn\'t offend any one :-)  Besides, some of this is of
interest to people on this list any way.

        Multi-Player Games Network would like to announce the availablity of
        its World Wide Web home page, and a new Windows95 based network --
        MPG-Net Showcase.

        The Web pages can be seen at:  http://www.mpgn.com
        Included at the site is a tour of the System Access Software, and all
        of the multi-player games that we currently have online.  You can also
        read reviews of our products as well.  You can create an account, and
        download the software to get started playing right away.  

        MPG-Net Showcase consists of the Win95 System Access Software (SAS)
        and Win95 frontends of our games.  The frontends are free to download
        from the web site.  All you need to play is machine capable of running
        Win95 (486/33 8mb RAM) and access to the Internet via Winsock.  A
        Pentium with 16 mb of RAM is suggested.

        The games that are currently on line include:
     
              * The Kingdom of Drakkar -- Fantasy Role Playing, quests, etc.
              * Empire Builder -- Based on the Mayfair Game, you and upto five
                others try to build a nation spanning rail-road system.
              * Minion Hunter -- Based on the GDW board game, which is based
                on Dark Conspiracy, you and upto five others work together to
                fend of the Dark Minions and their quest to take over the world.
              * Operation: Market-Garden -- Based on the GDW board game, you 
                command troops on either the Axis or Allied sides as you try
                your hand at the largest Airborne operation of WWII.
              * Imperium -- Based on the GDW board game, which is based on
                Traveller, you go head to head against another to control 
                space near Terra/Sol.

        So check out the web page, read about the games, and give MPG-Net 
        Showcase a spin!!!  You get five free hours to try it out.  After
        that, the rate is $2.00 US an hour to play. 

Wew, that was painless.  Any way, for you Imperium fans, we do have Imperium
on line.  Also, I will probably be starting up a Classic Traveller Online
game in 
the next few weeks.  I hope to use the web to distribute maps, text, and other
information, and MPG-Net Showcase\'s conference rooms to conduct the sessions.

Again sorry for the blatent commericalisam, but they are nice enough to give us
this list!!!

Sorry, there is a major bug in Your derived formula. The quick and dirty
formula for penetration is:

>d = k * m * (v^2) / (c^2)
And in fact, simply is the energy/surface the projectile has. However, all
formulas to calculate penetration have to be used carefully, because materials
are very different and the toughnes of materials does not increase linearily
with their thickness.

There is in fact no other exact way to determine if a projectile penetrates
so and so much cm of that material except shooting at it. I think there
are very complex computer simulations for this, but they are not exact, too.

If You are looking at the formulas You will know they can\'t be exact (or
even almost exact) because they mess up with the units.

Funny, one of my players asked me this last night, but we play using HEPlaR.
How would this type of engine do underwater, can they be used to create propultion
under water?

I figure that an output that creates a pressure higher thab the waterpressure would
at least keep water out. I guess that propultion would woork also but would that 
leave a rather distinct heattrack from the vaporized water.

Any comments ?

Ice buildup? Water gets most dense at +4 degrees centrigrade so if your
oceans aren\'t deepfrozen no ice will form on the SDB/sub unless you surface
often.
If you surface often in a warsituation the ice will be melted off by your
enemys lasers as they vaporize you :)

Thats what happens when you go off to aberdeen. You don\'t get to hear that
our group already does that, or did. I got the idea from this list.

Now i use another system. To make things a little more worrying, i do not
use the hit location chart anymore with the exception of being hit by
autofire and with precise aiming into various body locations. Generally (
and i think this is true in real life, tell me otherwise if i am wrong) a
person shooting at another will tend to instinctively shoot at the chest
and abdomen as it is presents the largest target with a higher probability
of hits, with greater chance of incapacitating or killing. Professional
users of firearms are tought to \'double tap\' targets in the chest for good
reason.

Thus in Traveller (and i am talking TNE) most combats tend to involve a lot
of chest damage. I\'ve found my players starting to worry about the damage
they are receiving now its hits almost entirely to the body area.


>Is there anywhere rules for designing aqua-space craft.

I believe that traveller space craft are capable of operating in water to
some extent. Underwater SDB bases for instance, and most atmosphere capable
ships can certainly land in water (see one of the MT book covers...can\'t
remember which one it was) which aids ocean refuelling when land masses are
scarce.

I do not know how well HEPLAR (TNE) drives will function under water, but
i\'m sure MT thruster plates would perform adequately.

To arm a star ship with torpedos would be silly IMHO. A starship has a
primary role for interplanetary or interstellar operations. The torpedos
would be wasteful on internal volume. Better to fit more useful equipment.
Fitting of torpedo\'s, a fairly antiquated technology at TL-10+ is best
assigned to purpose built submersibles. Submarines would make useful
planetary defense role is carrying a meson weapon or PDM\'s.



>The ship would have to be laid out differently.
>Go on! Design me a ship (max 350 tonnes).

Erm... see the Shukugan (Dragon) class SDB in Brilliant Lances but thats
400 tons i\'m afraid.

  I have no problems coming up with something like this if there is a demand
for it. What do other people think? Is it necessary?

  Another option which could be done either along side the periodic posting,
or instead of it, could be a general quoting/posting etiquette section

I have not derived my formula from Rheinmetall, I have found that impulse
per area is more accurate than energy per area when not limited to small
arms.
I agree that there is no accurate formula but the problem with the above
one (used bt BTRC in 3G^3 as well) is that it fits well with smallarms but
gives KEAP projs to much penetration. As small arms pen doesn\'t vary a lot
my thinking is that it\'s more important to make the KEAP projs fit.

These Heplar plates, what is the effect on the water and would it cause a
submerged craft to be easier or harder to detect than other means of propulsion?

HEPlaR is not plates but stand for

  High Energy Plasma Rockets

so their effects on water would be that it vapourizes it and becomes rather 
detectable in the thermal spectrum.

hadn\'t seen a single response to it, and have never seen it show
up on the digest.  So, if it has posted, and you are tired of seeing it,
please let me know!

What you will find below is an ascii "Summary" of the combat mechanics of
the GDW house d20 rules, with my changes...
I\'ve written some simple enhancements to the TNE rule system that can be
incorporated very smoothly into the existing frame work without complicating
the system.  The GDW d20 house rules system with these modifications allows
for a very reasonable simulation of real world fire fight combat.  I\'ve
talked to the Frank Chadwick on the combat mechanics and he admitted
basically "toning down" the lethality because "too much realism" didn\'t sell
- - a philosophy I find distasteful.  If anyone is interested in my military
and gaming credentials, I\'d be more than happy to talk about it off line.

One of the things I did was create a spreadsheet (because it makes nice
forms) using Excel 5.0; This spreadsheet is about three pages long and is
simply a summary of the house rules tasks for combat, wounds, etc.  If you
are interested in this spreadsheet, in Excel or some other format, contact
me at....

jwlovelx@ibeam.intel.com

If someone wanted to put the formatted version of this in an ftp site, I
could mail it to them.

I have gone through the trouble of creating an ascii version in a simple
outline format, and have tried to limit the line length so
as to not have this get all skewed in the formatting for the plethora of
mail readers out there, but you might still have to select the entire text,
copy it, then paste it into a word processor and choose Courier text...(when
I tried mailing it to myself it became strangely formatted) and clean up the
carriage returns...

GDW d20 HOUSE RULES SUMMARY

RANGED COMBAT

1.0	TASK DIFFICULTY SUMMARY	

Easy:			Asset x 4	
Average:		Asset x 2	
Difficult:		Asset x 1 	
Formidable:		Asset / 2 			
Impossible:		Asset / 4				

1.1	SMALL ARMS ASSET

Small Arms Asset:	Skill + (Str+Agil/2)  

[The averaged attribute, if greater then the skill, 
will have only half the value of the points that exceed 
the skill added to the skill.] 

1.2	SMALL ARMS RANGES

(SR)Short Range:	Modified Base Range x 1
(MR)Medium Range:	Modified Base Range x 2
(LR)Long Range:		Modified Base Range x 3
(XR)Extreme Range:	Modified Base Range x 4

1.3	AIMED DIRECT FIRE

[Assumes 1 action spent aiming]
[Also see modifiers below]

(SR)Small Arms Asset x 2
(MR)Small Arms Asset x 1
(LR)Small Arms Asset / 2
(XR)Small Arms Asset / 4

1.4	RAPID DIRECT FIRE & AUTO/BURST FIRE

(SR)Small Arms Asset X 1 - (Skill-(#shots/bursts)X(recoil value))
(MR)Small Arms Asset / 2 - (Skill-(#shots/bursts)X(recoil value))	
(LR)Small Arms Asset / 4 - (Skill-(#shots/bursts)X(recoil value))	

[Autofire Notes]

[Suppressive Fire Chance to hit is 1/4 normal at given range]

[A 1d20 is rolled for the total number of shots in the burst(s), modified as
follows:

ROF(3) lose 1d20 per range beyond short (Danger Zone = 1m)
ROF(5) lose 2d20 per range beyond short (Danger Zone = 2m)
ROF(10)lose 3d20 per range beyond short (Danger Zone = 3m)]

[Danger Zone (effective for entire turn for all fire, including suppressive)
where 1/2 of all missed dice, (including dice lost from above table) are
applied against targets in that area at 1/4 normal chance at a given range.]

[For Shotguns at Medium & Long range, treat as a 10 round burst.  Each hit
does 1d6 dmg. If an automatic shotgun, each burst is treated as a 10 round
burst.]	

1.5	SMALL ARMS MODIFIERS

Small Arms EXPERTISE
								
[Note:  Recoil Skill Bonus applies to SMALL ARMS SKILL, but only for the
purpose of calculating the recoil penalty.]

III	 14   20   3	   25m	   Level III Exp. w/weapon skill	

*  Recoil needs to be calculated as normal, but against the Small Arms Skill
(Not Asset) INSTEAD of basing it against the STR.  (Strength has nothing to
do with marksmanship in real life, you
can\'t strong arm recoil! You can only learn to re-acquire your sight picture
really fast)
** Range Bonus applies to Aimed Direct Fire Shots only.

1.6	ADDITIONAL FIRE MODIFIERS

OBSCURED TARGET: If target obscurred +1 DIFF
MOVING TARGET:  See page 294 of the rules.
OUSTANDING SUCCESS:  Doubles Damage (Accumulative w/Shrt Rng)
SHORT RANGE: Doubles Damage (Accumulative with OutstndSucss)	
TWO HAND HOLD: Reduces recoil value by 1 of Handguns
BRACING: Adds 10m to Base Rng for all direct weapons fire.
PRONE: Adds 10m to Base Rng. Can be added to bracing.
ELECTRONIC SIGHTS: All direct fire within 20m is -1 DIFF;* 
SMART LINK: If Smart Link all direct fire = -1 DIFF*
SCOPE: Add 10m per x1 power to Base Rng for Small Arms Aimed Fire.
ENHANCED ROUNDS: Add 1 to Dmg & 2 to Pen. If Pen is equal or greater than
damage, then Pen = Nil

    'body' => '     I have been perusing various starship construction rules (in CT/MT, 
     FFS, ICE\'s Space Master and Trav:2300AD) and am curious about how 
     displacement tonnage is handled in Trav material versus other 
     games...basically, which one is most precise or correct based on what 
     is known.  
     
     For example, SpaceMaster says that Vol of a starship in cubic 
     meters=Mass*3, while FFS says V=Mass*14.  How does this relate to 
     displacement tonnage???  Supposedly, FFS says that each ton of liquid 
     hydrogen takes up 14 cubic meters of space.  It seems to me that 
     SpaceMaster on the other hand, says that each ton of mass takes up 3 
     cubic meters (I\'m assuming here that they use water versus hydrogen 
     for their calculation).  Does anyone know how CT/MT handle this??  I 
     can\'t remember where the Starship Construction stuff is.  Also, how 
     does 2300AD handle this...I really can\'t remember.
     
     Also, another question related to CT/MT power plants...why do these 
     craft require so many MW of power???  IM not an educated 
     physicist-type as you can tell, but I know that approx. 515MW is equal 
     to about .1% of USA\'s annual power needs.  Some large MT warships use 
     540 billion watts and some smaller 400 ton craft use almost 1 billion 
     watts!!!!  In 2300AD, some of the larger ships require 150 to 300 MW.  
     Realistically, does all this make sense??  I can understand that a 
     jump drive would require sufficient energy, but the other ship systems 
     shouldn\'t require more than 50 MW on even the largest 
     starships....help!!  How many MW of energy does an wet-navy aircraft

While everyone is putting in their request for the new mailing list
divisions, I though I\'d add my thoughts.

If, as it seem so far, many of the members of the two lists are going to
"upgrade" to T4, then I would suggest two lists.

        CT/MT/TNE - A combination of the two current lists.  Mainly this
list would be for those few who refuse to upgrade and use one of the three
old rules systems.  Also this list would be for mileau\'s not yet covered by T4.

        Traveller - This list would be for anything covered by the new system.

Another worthy idea is to split the list up among time periods, like Rob
suggested, but we don\'t want to end up with 4 different lists.  At least not
until T4 attracts the droves of new travellers.  :)

That sounds about right, one of my players did the same to a platoon of
novices with a about three rounds from a laser pistol. It worked so ell 
because the novices would take 1 point, and fall into a screaming heap to 
the ground (init drop to 0 after 1 hit, I\'ve since changed that rule..)

I must say, if they were not lethal against unarmored opponents, what use 
would they be... and yes, give them a few combat armoured villians, that 
will soon bring them back to the good olg ACR.

JonOz:	Traveller should be going forward
ImperGame:	but first I will answer JonOz question
OGF Zeus:	Queue on hold. :)  Let me know when you want the queue back Ken. :)
ImperGame:	Jon, the New Era does not revertback to Marc Miller until August
ImperGame:	I know we can not please everyone

ImperGame:	we are not GDW
Allen024:	!
ImperGame:	If you have CT
ImperGame:	you do not have to buy any new books
ImperGame:	it is compatabile
ImperGame:	does that answer your question JonOz?
ImperGame:	Anyway
JonOz:	Not really...why should you go back to a first generation system when
an excellent
ImperGame:	there is one big change with the new Traveller
OnlineHost:	KFS1068 has left the room.
ImperGame:	which, by the way, will be called....
ImperGame:	Traveller

itself was far
Willem:	Gee...what a great, riginal name! :)
JonOz:	superior to the CT.  The task system and char generation is excellent
ImperGame:	I\'m afraid that Marc Miller belies that the new ares is...
ImperGame:	well... crud.
ImperGame:	There are some REALLY great ideas
ImperGame:	and we WILL use them
ImperGame:	Marc wants to go back to the "old reliable"
ImperGame:	and we plan NOt to change it again
ImperGame:	maybe update and modify
ImperGame:	but the system eill stay the same
ImperGame:	I promise it will be for the best
ImperGame:	but once again we can not please everyone
ImperGame:	sorry JonOz
Willem:	?

ImperGame:	sorry!
ImperGame:	your GM will do that
ImperGame:	everyones gaming groups will be different
ImperGame:	Why?
Willem:	Yes!
ImperGame:	Because if you read up on Traveller History...
Willem:	(oops..sorry...enthusiasm overwhelmed me...)
ImperGame:	you will see that the first servey is not done untill year 300
ImperGame:	now any questions?
WCook616:	?
OGF Zeus:	Allen.
OGF Zeus:	FrogGod is next.
Allen024:	Will there be anything like Fire, Fusion and Steel (the best book
in the TNE line?) I like
ImperGame:	Dont worry everyone
Allen024:	the level of detail on ships it provided.
ImperGame:	I will stay on untill the last one of you leaves
OGF Zeus:	We are now in PROTOCOL mode.  Use ? for a question and ! for a
OnlineHost:	KFS1068 has entered the room.
OGF Zeus:	comment. I\'ll let you know when you\'re up.
OGF Zeus:	Hello KFS1068, Welcome to the Game Designers Forum Conference!
OGF Zeus:	We are now in PROTOCOL mode.  Use ? for a question and ! for a
OGF Zeus:	comment. I\'ll let you know when you\'re up.
Frog God:	More a warning than a question...
Frog God:	With all those cooks in the stew, make sure that there is a
cohesive editor on the project...
Frog God:	Otherwise it will look like Shadowrun 1st Edition...:D
Allen024:	Excuse me, but my question wasn\'t answered.
ImperGame:	We have plans to do a FFS like suppliment
LeeGarv:	?
Allen024:	Thanks. (done)
ImperGame:	Actually, Greg Porter, who is on line will be handeling it
ImperGame:	Any input here Greg?
BTRC:	Well, I don\'t have a lot yet, since I\'ll be working heavily off the
existing background material,
Allen024:	If it\'s half as good as GUNS, GUNS, GUNS, it\'ll be excellent :)
ImperGame:	We have plans to release an equipment manual
BTRC:	but the coarser scale of Classic Traveller should make it an easier
task than say the level of detail
ImperGame:	this will happen in OCT
ImperGame:	and a wepions manual in JAN97
BTRC:	in GURPS Vehicles or FFS. I\'ll work with it as best I can and see what
percolates out.
OGF Zeus:	Frog God is up, or are you done? :)
ImperGame:	is you qustioned answered?
Frog God:	done
OGF Zeus:	YbrekP is up.
YbrekP:	Will starship combat be more abstract or more along the lines of
Batlerider or Brilliant Lan
YbrekP:	ces?
OnlineHost:	Mmohrfield has left the room.
HDI Bryce:	?
ImperGame:	Thats a hard one to answer?
ImperGame:	That question is one we are working on now
ImperGame:	I think it will start of simple
ImperGame:	and get more complex as time goes along
OnlineHost:	CaBil has entered the room.
ImperGame:	We do plan to release a board game(ship to ship) in AUGUST 97
YbrekP:	Thank you. (done)
ImperGame:	By the way
OGF Zeus:	Hello CaBil, Welcome to the Game Designers Forum Conference!
OGF Zeus:	We are now in PROTOCOL mode.  Use ? for a question and ! for a

ImperGame:	and two products a month until AUG 97
OnlineHost:	CaBil has entered the room.
OGF Zeus:	FeldK is up, HDI Bryce is next.
Feld Kuche:	Will the combat system be re-vamped?  The system now is probably
the best one out there....
ImperGame:	One product will be a suppliment about, ships, equipment, aliens,
etc
Feld Kuche:	Unlike Phoenix Command (too complex) or Recon! (too unrealistic).
ImperGame:	the other will be a full color map book (playing aid) or the TJAS
ImperGame:	It will be streamlined
OnlineHost:	YbrekP has left the room.
ImperGame:	and get more complex as time goes along
ImperGame:	or until costermes say Stop
Feld Kuche:	Any idea along which lines (faster/slower time)?
ImperGame:	It will take a year to get rules from simple to med
ImperGame:	and another to get them to complex
Feld Kuche:	Thank you (done).
ImperGame:	howevr if you have good houserules fell free to use them::done::
Allen024:	?

ImperGame:	we are coordinating some new release when the new game somes out
ImperGame:	they are 25mm::done::
OGF Zeus:	Apollo, you are up. :)
OGF Apollo:	I enjoyed the Traveller novels that came out, any plans from
Imperium for novels?...

OGF Apollo:	I understand the author is a big fan of Classic Traveller...

ImperGame:	::done::

OGF Zeus:	Allen is up.

**********************

Frog God   : Our guest tonite is Marc Miller, creator of 
             Traveller.
FarFuture  : How do we start this thing?
Frog God   : First, why don\'t you tell us about the current status 
             of the game, and an overview of your plans.
Frog God   : Then we can move to specific questions and the 
             overall chaos that generally ensues.  :D
FarFuture  : First, we all know (and regret) that GDW has 
             determined that it has to close its doors.
FarFuture  : As a result of various agreements and conventions 
             which GDW worked under,
Frog God   : We *will* be using protocol this evening, so please 
             don\'t just jump in.  Enter "?" if you have a
Frog God   : question.
FarFuture  : the actual rights (including copyrights and 
             trademarks) to Traveller
FarFuture  : have formally reverted to me.
Frog God   : You will then be called in order (sorry Marc...:D)
FarFuture  : In addition, those rights which belonged to other 
             (like
FarFuture  : Frank Chadwick and Loren Wiseman) have, through very 
             reasoned agreements,
FarFuture  : also come under my control.
FarFuture  : So all of Traveller is now in my hands (ie under the 
             holding company I call
Harrisonk  : ?
FarFuture  : Far Future Enterprises.
FarFuture  : In addition
Frog God:	(Go ahead, Marc)
FarFuture:	I am now trying to set up a publisher who will be the publisher of
record for Traveller
FarFuture:	That would be Imperium Games, with its team of Ken Whitman, Don
Perrin, Greg Porter,
FarFuture:	Jean Rabe, Tim Brown, and Lester Smith.
FarFuture:	On top of that, I think it is important (and I use a buzz word
here) that there be a
FarFuture:	"vision" for where Traveller is going and what it will be over the
long haul. That falls
FarFuture:	on me, and that is what we\'re all working on.
OnlineHost:	Sajin has entered the room.
FarFuture:	Where! I\'m long winded here.
OGF Zeus:	Hello Sajin, Welcome to the Game Designers Forum Conference! This
is
OGF Zeus:	our second conference with Marc Miller talking about Traveller.
Sajin:	Good evening evryone
FarFuture:	I always like to respond to questions because it tells at least
one person what he or she
OGF Zeus:	We are now in PROTOCOL mode.  Use ? for a question and ! for a
OGF Zeus:	comment. I\'ll let you know when you\'re up.  Please type :done: when
OGF Zeus:	you are done typing your question or answer. Thanks! :)
OGF Zeus:	HarrisonK is up. :)
FarFuture:	wants to hear. So lets start with questions, and I\'ll see if I
have any answers.
OnlineHost:	Sajin has left the room.
OnlineHost:	MWall1964 has entered the room.
FarFuture:	I do not control 2300 AD. That property has been sold (by all
individuals involved) to
FarFuture:	Tantalus, Inc. of Key West Florida. However, I act as agent for
them, so inquiries about it
FarFuture:	are still directed to me.
OnlineHost:	Paragon369 has entered the room.
OGF Zeus:	Hello Paragon369, Welcome to the Game Designers Forum Conference!
This is
OGF Zeus:	our second conference with Marc Miller talking about Traveller.
Paragon369:	MADE IT!!  Hi folks.... ;)

OGF Zeus:	Hello CaBil, YbrekP, Welcome to the Game Designers Forum
Conference! This is
OGF Zeus:	our second conference with Marc Miller talking about Traveller.
Frog God:	pontific8 is up...:D
OGF Zeus:	PontifiC8, you are up. :)
PontifiC8:	(Oh wow the power;)) In a like mode ,who controls T2K as of now ?
:done:
Harrisonk:	?
Frog God:	?
OnlineHost:	ImperGame has entered the room.
FarFuture:	Ditto for T2K. It\'s in the hands of Tantalus. Address queries to
me at FarFuture@aol,com
FarFuture:	:done:
OGF Zeus:	Harrisonk, is up, Frog God is next.
Paragon369:	?
OnlineHost:	YbrekP has left the room.
Harrisonk:	are licenses for 3rd party Traveller products (like the old FASA &
Paranoia Press stuff)
Harrisonk:	going to be available again and if so from who (Far Future or
Imperium Games)? :done:
FarFuture:	The licenses for FASA, DGP, Seeker, and Paranoia (among others)
have expired.
FarFuture:	Nevertheless, some (f not most) of that material has great merit.
DGP, FASA, and (I believe)
PontifiC8:	!
Harrisonk:	Yes, but are you going to be granting new licenses to interested
parties?
FarFuture:	Seeker, are in the hands of Roger Sanger in Seattle. He and I are
working on
FarFuture:	a renewal of those licenses to allow
FarFuture:	1) republishing the material that already exists,
FarFuture:	2) an archival publication of all of that material on CD-ROM,
FarFuture:	3) new stuff from the writers of the old stuff. :done:
Mmohrfield:	?
OGF Zeus:	Da Froginator is up. :) Pontific8 is in the batter\'s box
Frog God:	Much ballyhoo has been made in recent days by TNE players who feel
betrayed/abandoned/annoyed.
FarFuture:	And we (ie. Imperium Games) are working on new licenses as well.
Frog God:	Any comment on their dilemma?
Frog God:	(i.e. are you planning virus related material?)
FarFuture:	Yes. The conventional wisdom of what some call Traveller 4
FarFuture:	is that we should move 50 years into the future in order to get
past the ravages of the
FarFuture:	virus. Instead, at least partially to address the concerns of the
TNE people,
FarFuture:	we are moving to doing Milieux, different eras, which will allow
FarFuture:	playing Traveller in many different eras within the Traveller
universe.
FarFuture:	In addition, the recent suggestion of a TNE wrap-up book reflects
the sort of thing we want
FarFuture:	to do with the Milieu Books: address what people want to see about
specific eras. "done:
OGF Zeus:	Pontific8 is up.
PontifiC8:	My comment is obsolete:(
OGF Zeus:	Mm is up. :)
Frog God:	(sorry...:D)
FarFuture:	Great. Than I am answering the questions you want to have
answered.
Paragon369:	?
Mmohrfield:	Will the new edition of traveller contain alternate technologies
rules such as stutterwarps and subspa
FarFuture:	The new addition "will reflect Classic Traveller in light of 20
years of role-playing
Mmohrfield:	subspace radio, so that trhose of us who want to can run
non-imnperium campaigns?:done:
FarFuture:	experience." I don\'t expect to provide stutterwarp or any such
items initially. Traveller
FarFuture:	has a few basic assumptions which shape its universe: grav plates,
jump drive, cold
FarFuture:	fusion, no FTL communication except by ship. I won\'t close out the
possibility of
SDraper999:	?
Paragon369:	? ? ?
FarFuture:	alternative technologies to be discovered and experiemented with,
but otherwise, no. :done:
OGF Zeus:	Paragon369 is up. :)
Paragon369:	Thanks.. first, are you going to put out a supliment dealing with
\'alternate\' technologies?
Paragon369:	This could include stutterwarps, warp drives, worm holes, star
gates, etc.
Paragon369:	Since we\'ve all used them from time to time....
Paragon369:	Second.... when is the JTAS due out?  Is it going to wait till
the game is produced?
Paragon369:	Third.... is Far Future going to have a posting area on AOL...
and a home page????? <g>
Paragon369:	:done: Thanks....
FarFuture:	First: I think any good background for Traveller has to stick with
the basic assumptions.
FarFuture:	So the basic game system will not incorporate such non-standard
items. On the other hand, I
FarFuture:	expect to incorporate an academic/ researcher/ university type
character into the system
FarFuture:	this go round, and he/she/it will need scientific puzzles to meet
and deal with. Under those
FarFuture:	circumstances, I think Traveller needs to allow characters to meet
and deal
FarFuture:	with such "aternatives", provided they don\'t disrupt the fabric of
the game.
PontifiC8:	! (This time for sure)
FarFuture:	Second. JTAS is due out in August. I envision it as the vehicle
through which we
FarFuture:	a) publish many adventures,
KFS1068:	?
FarFuture:	b) make it possible to get glimpses of miliuex before their
documentation is out,
FarFuture:	and c) make it possible to refine the art of adventure writing and
story telling within the
FarFuture:	Traveller game system (ie. I think this go round, Traveller has to
emphasize PLAYING the
FarFuture:	game.).
FarFuture:	Third, Yes, we\'ll have several home pages (one for Imperium Games,
one by Far Future, and
FarFuture:	hot links). :done:
OGF Zeus:	:::If we can ask one question or make one comment at a time, I\'d
appreciate it. ::: :)
OGF Zeus:	SDraper999 is up. :)
SDraper999:	Are there any plans to give robots a bigger role in this
incarnation, perhaps
SDraper999:	even in the basic rules?  :done:
FarFuture:	I envision Traveller as a cosmopolitan universe with many
different inhabitants of different
FarFuture:	races, ethnic backgrounds, and even structures (ie robotics). That
is not to say, they get a
FarFuture:	along all the time, because they don\'t. But the game system should
always have many
OnlineHost:	Mmohrfield has left the room.
Paragon369:	?
FarFuture:	different "types" in it. One of those types is robots. But the
robot that thinks and acts at
FarFuture:	artificial intelligence levels is rare and of a player character
type rather than ubiquitous
FarFuture:	and NPC. Just having many different robots of different
configurations for its own sake is
OnlineHost:	Mmohrfield has entered the room.
FarFuture:	not conducive to good game PLAY. Instead, I see unintelligent
robots as no more than
FarFuture:	different model cars; smart robots are rare and need to have true
goals which will help good
FarFuture:	role playing action. :done:
OGF Zeus:	Pontific8 is up. :)
PontifiC8:	But, some folks I know use the Traveller system w/o the backgrnd
or The Basic Assumptions because the
PontifiC8:	game mechanics regardless of
PontifiC8:	of version have always been flexible and

RPG referees who create t
OGF Zeus:	!
FarFuture:	their own universes (based on, but expanding upon) the Traveller
universe are acting on one
FarFuture:	goal that the game system has: to lay a foundation. And I support
that 100%. But Traveller
FarFuture:	cannot be all things to all people. The path that GDW took
Traveller reflected the interests
FarFuture:	of those at GDW: gritty, military futures. Now that I am in
control of where it goes, I
FarFuture:	fully intend to take the system down a path that is satisfying to
me, because I think I have
FarFuture:	a track record of meeting the interests and needs of a large
portion of the SF RPG players
FarFuture:	and refs out there. Which brings us to this "vision" thing. Right
now, there are
FarFuture:	two SF universes of any major importance: Star Trek and Star Wars.
Both have their
FarFuture:	followings, and both have their defining characteristics.
Traveller has its own defining
FarFuture:	characteristics, which, if properly presented, can make Traveller
the third major SF system.
FarFuture:	That\'s what I want to work toward. :done:

mentioned before. I see the

FarFuture:	preferred structure being rolled. But I have also said I want to
revised based on 20 years
FarFuture:	of role-playing experience, and that means we need to recognize
the advances that have
FarFuture:	been made: like templates, or points. And I want the system to
include provision for

wishy-washy; it is recognizing the

FarFuture:	Two of the strengths of Traveller are the detailed rules that
allow playing at

at the same time, I don\'t
FarFuture:	want the design system toi be an excuse for not including

ships in combat and
FarFuture:	large scale Naval Operations. I want to have a system wherein this
ship fights that ship and

where my fleet or squadron
FarFuture:	encounters your fleet or squadron and we fight out a classic naval
encounter. :done:
OGF Zeus:	Clay is up. :)
ClayRBush:	? On naval combat: Will the new rules be specific about how
squadrons jump? The standard
ClayRBush:	?rules said that jump time was indeterminate, but Joe Fugate had
said that high levels of
OnlineHost:	Allen024 has left the room.
ClayRBush:	? Navigation would permit a fleet navigator to choose destination
_and_ destination time.
ClayRBush:	? Which made Navigation a great skill for Traders. :-( I favor
having jump duration or
ClayRBush:	? destiunation being predictable, with the other then being
random. It permits admirals to
ClayRBush:	?maneuver without worrying about some ships arriving 36 hours
before others do. :done:
FarFuture:	I say jump takes 168 hours plus or minus 10%. I think skill and
equipment can narrow the
OnlineHost:	Allen024 has entered the room.
FarFuture:	time to 5% or even 3% tolerance, and then luck can influence the
exact duration. I think the
FarFuture:	same applies to destination. But I want to avoid deciding that one
or the other can be
FarFuture:	pinpointed just to make it easier for the players to get what they
want. I\'ll think about it

roll for jump duration?

I assume that these system-aqua fighters will be attacking an enemy world
possessing the theoretical underwater base from what has been said. I also
assume that all planetary defences have been neutralised in order that
these fighters have access to the ocean?

Surely if the planetary defences have been neutralised, then the orbiting
vessels are likely to possess meson weapons with which to neutralise deep
core meson gun mounts. Why not use the meson gun on the base in question?

True you assume that large vessels with meson weapons might not be
available (i wish you luck neutralising all the defences), then the
fighters are presumably carried aboard a tender or fighter carrier of some
kind to move them about? Surely its escorts would have meson guns?

If you mean that the aqua fighters are based upon a world already then why
are they attacking a base that will in all probability belong to the world
government? If the world is balkanised then fair enough.

I think submarines at this level would still fulfill the role better. Such
submarines would not have to take weeks to get on station in a patrol area.
Such vessels would be able to quickly (relatively speaking) fly close to
the patrol area then vanish below the waves. The same when a quick move is
needed.

Basically IMHO, sub aqua fighters armed with torpedos would have very
limited use and not fulfill any roles other than a very specialised niche
which in itself is questionable.

I don\'t think anti-gravity drives allow you to increase the mass of
the ship, just to negate most of it.  As such "flying down" means you
are going to have to basicly up end your ship and exert thrust to get
it down, and to keep it down.  I don\'t know how "visible" thruster
plates are when they\'re on, but as far as TNE thrust systems go, this
is going to keep your fuel processing plants going over time, and it\'s
going to be rather easy to spot you (not good for an SDB).

The Roman numeral "level" is not associated with the skill level, it is
an indicator of "level of expertise", so you can have a Small Arms Skill
of 8, with Level II Expertise, etc.

I didn\'t invent it, I just tweaked it.  This might have been in the TW2K
d20 version...I can\'t recall if it was in the TNE book....

It\'s a problem if we want to preserve the canon of hiding SDBs underwater. 
Perhaps we should assume that SDBs, corsairs and other ships in need of 
concealability have some kind of magneto-hydro dynamic drives rigged in the 
fuel scoops. (This may not be entirely correct) MHDs work by passing an 
electric current through water in a magnetic field inside the MHD tube, this 
produces a force on the water which jets it out the back of the MHD tube. Given 
the power generation capacity of Traveller ships, and the availability of 
superconductors to make magnets, I don\'t think that adding this to the fuel 
scoops (which would require a hatch to open at the closed end of the scoop for 
MHD operation) would really take much volume/weight/cost. This offers a quick 
fix solution to keep ocean-deployed SDBs in the canon.

Kinda like the "catapillar drive" from "Hunt For Red October" ?

The only problem that I see involves keeping a ship with positive bouyancy from
returning to the surface.  A ship\'s drives could certainly force a vessel under
water but would require continual operation to keep it under.

Ballast tanks would certainly solve the problem.  I thought I read somewhere
that a ship\'s fuel tanks were compartmentized and could be individually empty or
full (this would prevent the liquid hydrogen from sloshing around during
high-stressing maneuvers and keep the ship\'s balance in check).  I don\'t see why
these tanks could not also be filled with water to act as ballast.

The tactics article is pretty far back on the back burner, I have paying
projects with deadlines for other game companies coming due, but I can write
up a quick note or two...

Unfortunately, a LOT of the little things that make up gunfight tactics are
not translateable to a RPG, at least not without making a lot of minor rule
adjustments.  Sorting through the major stuff will take some time.

Example:

A lot of what makes a person vulnerable in a gun fight is stupid mistakes
caused by poor habits during practice / training.  For instance, knowing how
to clear a misfeed, reloading when you can and not when you have to,
learning to deal with the physiological changes that combat stress induces
(loss of fine motor skills, tunnel vision, excorporation (out of body
experience), time slows down, etc.) all contribute to survival in a gun fight. 

You almost need a new skill: Combat Tactics, where if you fail, you do
something stupid.  (You know how many officers are killed because of taking
their eyes off the target while reloading?  Or from focusing on only one
combatant and getting flanked? Or from "spraying and praying" - not taking
the time to aim?  The answer:  Most of them.)  Training yourself to behave
intelligently under stress fire is a skill in it\'s own right.

At the moment though, in my games, a successful Difficult Perception roll
from the PC\'s (and NPC\'s) is needed to notice things going on outside their
immediate area of concentration, unless the Players specifically,
constantly, state they are checking.  It\'s very easy to get flanked when you
don\'t see it coming.

(In real life Deadly Force training, trainee\'s are drilled constantly so
that after engaging a target to immediately pan around the area, moving the
body like a tank turret with the weapon at a high ready position.  Basic
marksmanship is constantly repeated like a mantra, "Front sight, trigger
control", because you fall back on training instinctively under stress, and
these words magically appear in your mind, making you take control of the
situation.  He who shoots most accurately first, shoots last.  

You have to train exactly how you want to behave in a real firefight.
That\'s why you always dump and forget about spent ammo / mags while training
- - so you don\'t get killed like the cops in the 70\'s did when they got in
firefights.  They wasted time bending down to pickup brass and dropped
bullets after reloading in a real firefight because that\'s what their range
instructors made them do in practice.

I also have the PC\'s deal with an abundance of crap guns, cheap guns,
expensive crap guns, good and crappy ammo, all kinds of manufacturer\'s
brands, and it gets worse from world to world.  

They have to "learn" what\'s good, what\'s not.  And if they trust the advice
of a minimum wage old fart / kid behind the counter to sell them a good
weapon, they better hope he\'s the rare, knowledgeable gun shop owner and not
some armchair general who gets them some piece of hype.   I love to role
play the store people, I can sucker the PC\'s into buying anything, until
they learn better in a scary situation.  They pretty much learn to research
things on their own, stick to know reliable "companies" and verify things on
their own.  They also learn that out of the box is rarely good, and
reputable tactical modifications is a good thing.  (spend money, or learn
gunsmithing skills)

How many games do you know of where the PC\'s buy guns, go on a mission, and
don\'t even think twice about how well it will work for them?  

Don\'t get me wrong, I don\'t waste a lot of time nitpicking the PC\'s, their
characters are supposed to be the experts, not the Players, and a lot of
this is simply narrated into the story for flavor and background.  

I\'m just trying to point out that a lot of real world tactical knowledge
doesn\'t translate well to game mechanics.  

Here are a number of survival tips that would translate into combat
mechanics, some tongue in cheek:

1.  Learn the difference between Cover and Concealment.  A lot of things
that you might think would be Cover won\'t.

2.  Reload when you want to, not when you have to.

3.  In the game, have the character carefully weigh the factors important in
a firearm, Recoil Value, capacity, damage, penetration, and base range.
Those lasers are great, I wish I had one.

4.  You can never have too many bullets.  Many a gunfight survivor has
claimed they wished they would have carried more ammo.

5.  Maximize use of Cover and Concealment.

6.  Allies should cover each other, and do so when "leap frogging" from
cover to cover.

7.  If the enemy is in range, so are you. Good old Murphy-axiom.

8.  Avoid gun fights.  If you must get in one, make sure you have a gun.  

9.  Keep aware of your surroundings, always expect to be flanked.  

10. Flank them first.

11. Use body armor.  

12. Carry a backup gun. At the very least you can arm an ally who might not
be armed, or loses their weapon, or if you are being grappled with, you can
grab it (if you didn\'t stick it in your ankle) and use it.

13. Handguns should just be used to defend yourself until you can reach the
rifle/shotgun you should have had in the first place.

14. Marksmanship, marksmanship, marksmanship!  If your character is not a
super skilled shooter, take the time to aim.  Take cover first...


Well, hope you enjoyed my lecturing.  This was just off the cuff, haven\'t
written the article yet that I had in mind.

Message-ID: <199604100209.TAA17869@usr6.primenet.com>

There was discussion a while back about engineering crew sizes. On complaint
about TNE ship is the large crew sizes. After much analysis, I have come to the
conclusion that the TNE formula is flawed.

Each Engineer can operate, maintain, and repair a set number of engine
components. The flaw is that if the engine outputs 4x more power, the complexity
will increase by 4x also. Not so, the number of engine components will increase,
but so will their size. 

So a 100mw power plant, having about 100 different components will require one
engineer. The 400mw power plant has 200 different components, these being 2x as
large, would need only 2 engineers.



To correct ships already built. find the square root of the required engineering
crew and multiply by the square root of the number of drives.
IE a 2x 4,000mw tl-12 fusion power plants, would need a crew of 13 not 93!

	This is actually pretty similar to a discussion we had on the 
beta list a few months ago.  We were talking about heplar in the 
atmosphere, but it should work roughly the same in water also.  
Basically, spacecraft with airframe hulls and all grav vehicles would 
have air intakes which they used to bring air into the HePLAR chamber 
where it would be superheated along with a very tiny amount of hydrogen 
before being expelled out the thrust nozzles.  This allows heplar to 
actually be "no more dangerous than a jet engine" as GDW claimed because 
by using much more reaction mass you can have a _lot_ lower exhaust temp.
	Not only does this provide another reason to have an AF rather
than SL hull (you can fly near inhabited areas) but it gave us an excuse
to have a minimum size for heplar in space but not in atmosphere.  This
was important to us because we were trying to stuff the genie of heplar
missiles back in the bottle while still allowing air/rafts. :-)
	Underwater, this could work pretty much the same way.  In fact, 
it might work even better since water makes such good reaction mass.  Of 
course, you still have the problem of a big thermal sig.  You\'d have to 
drop the part about only AF hulls, too, because IIRC, SDBs are usually 
only SL.

	This makes perfect sense.  After all, ships fill their tanks with 
water to convert it into fuel all the time.  Why not just use it for 
ballast?  Of course, if you tanks are already full, this may require you 
to dump refined fuel and take on unrefined (water) but then SDBs don\'t 
have jump drive anyway, so what does it matter?

For what it is worth, water masses 1 metric ton per cubic meter. To get
the mass of a cubic meter of other materials look up the specific
gravity (aka density) and multiply by it:

(these figures are from memory)

air		  .001
aluminum	~2.5
titanium	~4
iron		~7.8
copper		~8
lead		11.3
mercury		13.6
gold		19.3

I think you better recheck your figures. For one thing I\'ll bet you
that the figure you saw was MW/hours or some such. Which makes it a
measure of *energy*, not power.

Even so, 500 megawatts is a not all that large power plant. Big, but
not *huge*.  (Remember .1% is 1/1000th!) Commercial power plants are
rated in *gigawatts* these days.

Consider. It takes a *lot* of energy to change the velocity of a
multi-thousand ton ship. At 10 m/s a 1000 ton *mass* (not displacement)
ship has a kinetic energy of 50 Mj. As a *vast* oversimplification, to
accelerate at 1 g, you have to add that much velocity ebery second.
Which would (ignoring *lots* of details!) require 50 Mj/s which is the
same as 50 MW. In reality, it takes a *lot* more energy than that,
partly because propulsion isn\'t 100% efficient, and partly because
kinetic energy goes up as the *square* of the velocity.

Look at it this way. 50 MW is *only* 68 thousand horsepower. That\'s
*way* too low.

> How many MW of energy does an wet-navy aircraft carrier, nuclear sub,
> or cruiser produce currently???

A normal *freighter* produces enough power to run a small city. That\'s
how Con-Ed got the power to start up the power plants in New York City
after the great blackout in the late 60s. They had one of the
freighters in New York harbor tie up at the dock by one of the power
plants and they ran a cable from the ship\'s generators to the power
plant. That gave them *more* than enough power to run the fuel pumps,
automatic stokers, etc, *and* run the control systems. 

Likewise, in the early 60s a hurricane knocked out all power on one of
the smaller Hawaiian islands. The Navy sent a nuclear sub to the island
to provide power. It had enough *spare* power to run the city.

And if I recall correctly, standard items in the Army are such things
as portable generators up to half a megawatt. 

> And also, over what time period does the reactor output this energy??? 
> Is this a per/kw hour type figure??  How many volts in 1 MW???

You don\'t understand the units. Watts, kilowatts, megawatts, and
gigawatts are all units of *power*. Power is "so much energy per unit
*time*". So a 1 MW power plant produces up to 1 megawatt. Which is 1
megajoule per second. A megajoule is roughly the energy required to
lift 100 tons 1 meter against 1 gravity.

Watts are the *rate* at which energy is produced.

Units like "kilowatt hour" are units of *energy*. A kW hr is 3600 kW
sec or 3.6 Mj. Or the energy required to lift 360 tons 1 meter.

The relation between volts and watts is only useful for *electrical*
power. And the rule there is volts times amps equals watts. So the
question "how many volts in 1 MW" doesn\'t mean anything. If I had 1 Mw
of electrical power, it might be 1 amp at a million volts, or 1 million
amps at 1 volt. Or 1000 amps at 1000 volts. 

Another quick example. The "srvice" coming into the average house is
220-250 volts, and the breakers are rated for at *least* 60 amps total.
Maybe more. I think the incoming lines are good for something like
100-200 amps. That\'s a peak draw of 50 kW. So a 500 MW power plant
could only handle the peak load from 10,000 such houses.

Luckily, houses rarely draw anywhere *near* that much power. But ask
around. Find out what the backup generators at your local hospital are
rated at (then pick your jaw up off the floor). If you live near a
seaport, find out what the power plants on ships are rated at. If you
live near a railroad, find out what a diesel locomotive is rated at. If
you live near an airport, find out what the engines on a jumbo jet are
rated at. If any of these figures are in horsepower, look up the
conversion factor (I seem to recall that 1 hp = 735 watts). 

The power consumption figures do get argued about from time to time.
But quite often it is because they are too *low*!

        If you\'re going for concealability, an MHD is a great big "sink me"
sign. Look at one of the premier subhunting aircraft, the P3 Orion. That big
boom sticking out the back is a Magnetic Anomaly Detector, and it works by
detecting the minute disturbances the sub causes in the Earth\'s magnetic
field. And that\'s just the passive effects of a large metal object in the
water. Now you want to put these powerful magnetic fields in there? Go for
it! You be the defender, I\'ll be the attacker!

        Somebody else mentioned the "caterpillar drive" from "Hunt For Red

Just thought I\'d add my 2c\'s worth to this disscussion. If we assume that
the thrust pressure of the HEPlaR drives if sufficent overcome the pressure
of the surrounding water, then a problem would arise when starting the
drives. I would propose a large explosion (size dependant on drive rating
of ship, exhaust port area, etc...) to create a pressure wave that would by
immediately followed by the drives powering-up. This would not be ideal for
a stealthy getaway and would annoy the hell out of the planetary ecologists
and environmentalists.

Also, when under the water, how does it\'s preformance differ? Water is a
much denser media than space (what is\'nt?) so would there be restrictions
on its speed, fuel efficency etc..

These are only thoughts, and are open to disscussion and alteration.

>Yeah, but those rules from Best of JTAS #1 mean that high tech goods are

The exchange factor was 1.00 at Tl-F A-port and lower by lower TL and port.
When you go to a world you convert your trusty Imperial Cr to local and you
would always get the same or more local creds for your Imperial.
How could that make high tech goods cheaper on low tech worlds?
I only have the original JTAS issue (#4) so maybe they changed it in Best of=
=8A?

/Backman
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I think the original idea was derived from the fact that shoes made in the 
US are more expensive than ones made in Thailand. Same shoes, same tech, 
different price. 

When dealing with stuff beyond a systems nominal TL; 
I always kick the price up. If some TL15 thing costs 1000CR Imperial @ a TL15 
starport A world than I would divide by .7 (for example) if that was the ap-
propirate multiplier for another world with a lower TL. This would still be
in Imperial Credits, btw, so the cost in \'local\' credits would be even higher.
This makes hi-tech stuff more expensive out in the boonies, even when buying 
with Imperial Credits, which is what I assume most Travellers will be carrying,
& is just the way I like things to work. It can get expensive out there on the 
Fringe when you rely too heavily on the highest tech.

My POV is that all these things  are major plusses.

In general, I\'m just about positive, I\'m going to go for it. Of course
I didn\'t bother with the last rule set so this one fits right in with
where I\'m at right now.

IMHO something generating heat like the starship drive would be too obvious.
Ok you say, im not going to be under water for too long, lets do a cold

would the starship have to be designed a different way to withstand high

There isn\'t one.

Example: Joe (Str 8) has level 4 in Slug Rifle. Asset is 12. At short
range, he automatically fails with a roll of 17-20 (see combat rules) even
though this is an average task (Roll <= (2x Asset)).

Now, let\'s say he\'s got 4mm Gauss at II. He still rolls versus his Slug
Rifle, but now only has an autofail on a 19-20, and reduces the recoil per
shot by 2, as well. This is shown on his sheet as follows:

        Slug Rifle      4/12
                Gauss R II
                18mm SG III
His 18mm Shotgun also uses the same Slug Rifle Skill and asset, but since
it\'s level III, he reduces the Recoil by three, and only fails on a 20! The
rules actually say to add the level to Str when figuring recoil penalties,
but every gm of t2k and TNE who uses the specialization rules subtracts it
instead from the recoil#, with a minimum recoil of 1 per shot, period.

Also, in both cases he\'s got a longer range for the 18mm SG and the 4mm
Gauss, but uses only his slug rifle base skill (with full recoil, normal
range, and 17-20 automiss) for all other slug rifles, such as 7mm mausers,
5mm assault rifles, etc. He wouldn\'t even get the bonus with a 19mm
(roughly 10ga) Shotgun.

He\'d also not get it with different brands until he\'d familiarized himself
(about as many range hours as required XP), but wouldn\'t have to rebuy for
a different model of same caliber and case sizes, just practice.

Pre-Rebellion 	Zloff - C674666-8  Ag Ni     302 Im

Before the collapse Eos was Nike Nimbus\' Breadbasket, and a retreat world
for the upper classes of Nike Nimbus. Ruled by a Govenor appointed by 
the Nimban dictator, it was a quiet world.
Nimban corporations controlled vast swathes of the planet, Plantations, 
usually used for agriculture, though some were used for retreats and resource 
exploration.
Most areas of natural beauty on the planet were the siting of Domains - each
a home for the super wealthy of Nike Nimbus, called Landholders.
The atmospheric taint is pollen, released by Eosian plants. Whilst the 
introduction of Terran plants for agriculture has decreased the pollen level
significantly, it is very irritating. Due to the small axial tilt of Eos,
seasons are almost unnoticable, and pollen is present all year round. Only the
Repos islands, whose plants have all been replaced by Terran varieties by
their Landholders, are remote enough from land to not suffer from the pollen at
all.

The coming of the rebellion brought great change to Eos, the Nimban Military
established a base on planet, and upgraded the starport to B class. The 
planetary tech base was increased to TL-12 to provide better support to 
the military forces. Nimban corporations diversified, many investing in Eos,
for products and resources that were now imposible to import from elsewhere.

The Virus didn\'t hit Eos unawares, there was sufficient warning for it to
\'harden\' it\'s high tech equipment, as the majority of its tech base was still
TL-8 this was accomplished quickly.

Once it was certain that interstellar civilization had fallen, the Govenor of
Eos, Francine Dubar, declared herself Empress. Using the Marine garrison of
the capital, Port Albert, she attempted to enforce her rule accross the whole
planet. The ordinary population may have been willing to kowtow to her - the 
Landholders and the Corporates were not. Using their well equiped security 
forces they launched a bloody campaign that ended with a lightning strike on 
the capital that killed the Empress and forced the Marines to surrender.

Once order was restored the victors set up the Grand Council. Here 
representatives of the Corps - who owned most of the surviving high tech
industry, and the Landholders - who owned most of the lower tech industry, met
to run the planet. The Council continues to run the planet to the present day.
The only events of note up to the formation of the Dawn League was the First 
Fall Revolt of 1171. This ended in 1173, with the Lords of First Fall being 
given seats on the Council. First Fall is a continent peopled almost 
exculsively with Eos\' original Rule of Man colonists. By 1190 the planetary TL
was 10. Contact with the Hivers and the subsequent formation of the Dawn League
led to the Starport being reactivated as a C class facility, and by 1198 the
Tech level stood at 11.

The Council takes a mild Centrist stance in the Coalition\'s affairs, and has 
cordial relations with all of the Centrist bloc. Relations are cool with Nike 
Nimbus, their former master - as it is associated with the last Govenor, and 
her imperial ambitions. The Nimbans may not have helped matters by insiting Eos 
resume her position as a Nimban colony on recontact in 1192. The most recent 
source of friction between the two planets was a diplomatic offensive by the 
Nimbans to recover two Vixtrix Sloops of the old Nimban Navy, grounded at
the Port Albert Starport. This was only solved when the Eosians donated the 
ships to the Dawn League, who refurbished them.

The goverment takes a back seat in most Coalition affairs, most of its energies
are devoted to expanding its high tech production facilities, which still are
small compared to the lower tech facilites which are the norm on the planet.
The goverment, and the Landholders sponsor SAG missions to former TL 10-12
planets to get the equipment they need. First Fall Lords also sponsor covert
missions to obtain modern weapons to secure thier positions.

Eosians weathered the collapse well. They see the Coalition\'s rise to be 
irisistable - and their place will be at its heart.

Hi folks

I\'m writing a scenario (that I expect will turn into a
campaign) set on the world of Arden in the
Spinward Marches.

I would like to try and keep this material within the
existing canon as far as possible.  I have consulted
all the sources that I have at my disposal (Spinward
Marches, Library data, Regency Sourcebook)
that at least cover the area.  I was wondering if any
of you knew of any information relating specifically
to Arden that exists outside of these?  I\'m referring
to anything from scenarios to snippets of information
about names of cities etc. (pref. 1110 or earlier)

If you know of anything I\'d be grateful if you could
e-mail me with the name of the publication so I can
try and track it down (or if it\'s only a little bit of info,
perhaps you could just let me know what it is...)
Thanks a lot.

By the way, in all the discussion about new lists and
names for the new incarnation of Traveller, and in the
light of the ongoing CT/TNE schism,  I\'m surprised
that nobody\'s mentioned:

Traveller 4: The Empire Strikes Back ....
;-)

Cheers

Iain

Hi All.  I think with this discussion swinging into full action, it\'s 
time for a little game of "survery says!".  Please email me at:

charles@hebb.psych.mcgill.ca

The message subject line should be "Survey: Option x", where x 
is the number of your preferred option.  

Options:

1. Leave Traveller and Xboat alone, create new mailing list for New 
Traveller.

2. Leave lists as are, but discuss New Traveller on Xboat.

3. Leave lists as are, but discuss New Traveller on Traveller.

4. Leave lists as are, and discuss New Traveller on either/both.

What have I been doing while off the Net? See below...

Here is a summary of the "Whither Traveller" debate, as at digest 614 (Thursday
29th February 1996). In many cases, I had to glean people\'s "votes" from one or
two throwaway sentences, so please forgive me if I have noted your vote
incorrectly. It dates from the time Marc extended his invitation to comment on
Traveller\'s direction (Digest 536/Xboat 490).

While you may think that this just gives everyone something to shoot at (ie.
another flame war is in the offing), my belief is that all the arguing has been
done - to death, in fact.

...And if you don\'t believe me, just review these threads (cross-postings to
Xboat & Digest are only counted under Digest figures):

          "Nilsen\'s Departure" -- Digest 484 to 499
          "GDW Closing Down"   -- Digest 536 to 540, Xboat 490 to 496
          "Whither Traveller"  -- Digest 536 to 598, Xboat 490 to 518

So please don\'t restart the TNE-vs-MT/CT thing again, OK? We all know the
sentiments on both sides. 

However, if you are not in the list below, feel free to cast your vote, now
that the battle lines have been drawn! I have already added mine ("DJW").

NOTE: "Voters" are abbreviated. I will send a separate list linking names to
abbreviations (eg. "MM" = Marc Miller).

COMMENTS ON THE ABOVE STATS

     a. General (my personal comments - feel free to ignore)

Everyone expects the world of Marc - and there is *no way* he will be able to
please everyone. I hope that everyone involved is able to understand this.

I have never been happy with combat in Traveller. I am happiest with MT combat.
However, I\'m an AD&D man, so feel free to ignore this ("Fireball, fireball,
lightning bolt! - is it dead yet?" - Andrew P. Madden).

As to backgrounds, no matter what comes out, as a *referee* I run my own
campaigns. These are loosely based on GDW\'s background, but are changed to
surprise the know-it-all players (eg. I ran my own version of the 5FW,
beginning it in late 1105, and allowing the PC\'s to zap the 40th at Fulacin...
etc.) I don\'t accept the supposed problem of "the Imperium is too big for the
PC\'s actions to have any effect" rubbish! Change things -- it is YOUR
campaign!. However, as a *collector*, I want to know about the "Empress Wave",
and possible alternates to the Rebellion aftermath -- etc. ("I want it all --
it\'s mine, I tell you mine, MINE! Bwah hah hah!!").

A background sourcebook on the Imperium could include sections on the Imperial
Navy, Nobility, etc.

     b. Subscriber Stats

          TML:       452 subscribers
          XBOAT:     357 subscribers
          TOTAL:     556 unique addresses (~250 people are on both lists)

     c. Summary

Discussion began in Digest 536, with largest posts being "wish lists". First
nasty comment occurred in 569. Slugfest started in Digest 575 and began to die
down by 593, when we returned to wish lists.

     d. Analysis Highlights

          i. General

EVERYONE wants new stuff to be properly proofread, quality-controlled etc (and
many have offered their services to this task, some suggesting to beta-test via
the Net). NO-ONE is unhappy that GDW has given control of Traveller to MM, BUT
everyone expects the world (should that be "the universe"?) from him. Good luck,
Marc.

          ii. Rules

CT/MT vs TNE is a BIG debate - it suggests that MM tread carefully and test the
water more. Having both simple and expanded Char Gen seems to be the way to go,
including more than the original 4 careers and possibly an aliens section. Task
Resolution is wanted, but type is undecided. Simpler combat than TNE appears
favoured. Expand world profiles, especially LawLvl and TL.

          iii. Design Rules

FF&S "Lite" (suggested first by M but named by J) seems to be a real winner -
both GearHeads and NGH\'s want this one. Many people liked FF&S (was this the
most populer TNE item? -- it seems so!), and most want to see it again. General
consensus is for a re-write, many wanting it to mesh better with Traveller\'s
background (many called to look at the GDW-Beta list for ideas AND for
computerised design sequences - especially as part of a CD-ROM). Many want BL
and BR kept, and asked for conversion rules.

          iv. Backgrounds, Books and Magazines

CT/MT vs TNE is STILL a big debate, evenly split, BUT multiple eras gets a big
thumbs-up. As for books it is a scattered reply, with "Aliens - Give Us
Anything!" and an Imperium Soucebook being the two front-runners.

          v. CD-ROM Discussion, Traveller on the Net

Many approved of the concept, but are undecided on the contents! World Gen,
Craft Design, Library Data, and an Atlas are the most favoured. Net Traveller
is favoured to garner interest in the product, more than as a serious full-on
venture.

          vi. Marketing stuff, Other

Luke-warm responses to the marketing ideas, maybe just because it is very low
on everyone\'s agenda.

P.S. This is NOT my normal Net address!! I\'m using pine and a 1200-baud modem,
so found it hard to send this message from home.

Nope. In any formula I know, energy is more importend than mass. In
the Rheinmetall formula they have the same relation as in the
energy formula(the only diffference is, that mass is square-rooted
and energy goes linear instead of squared energy and linear mass)

Using ^0.3 to ^0.4 will solve the problem. However, than You are very close
to the Rheinmetall formula. If Your assumptions where right the whole modern
method of using discarding sabots would be outright stupid, because to
accellerate the projectile You need ENERGY (i.e. m x v^2) but You would
get only (m x v). This would result in very long, very large(never smaller
than the bore) heavy projectiles with high mass and low velocity having the
best penetration with a given amount of gun powder.
But the realworld (tm) tendency is to produce small(smaller than the bore), 
but dense(that\'s good anyway), very fast projectiles.

A few days ago someone posted a set of "levels" which modified combat weapon 
results.  

The question is how does one determine what level a specific character has 
attained?  I was thinking it was based on their skill (i.e. I = skill 0-2, 
..), but from subsequent messages I no longer think so.

So what\'s the scoop?  and what t2k book is it in?

     I have found some of the video/book reviews to be very enlightening,

     considered how characters (PC or NPC) might react to their first 
     shoot-out?  The review mentions reactions such as joi-de-vivre ("I\'m 
     alive, I\'m alive!), social withdrawl  ("I\'ve just killed someone, and 
     you want to play squash?"), even promiscuity (common with young 
     policemen who were virgins till they wed, apparently "I nearly died

     Joel,
     I enjoyed reading your post.  I hope you get the chance to expand it 
     soon.  My objectives for refereeing a game where combat occurs are not 
     to provide an accurate simulation of ballistics, timing and terminal 
     ballistics (the polite way of describing the interaction between 
     bullet and soft tissue, ahem).  Instead, I would like to give players 
     the feel of being in a life-threatening situation through their 
     characters perceptions.  I don\'t think this can be achieved 
     exclusively through the rules, although I think the rules can be 
     slanted to help, but it requires a discussion of the subject as part 
     of the rules.
     
     I\'ve got more to say on this subject, but I have to be somewhere soon 
     (yes some of us have a social life ;-)).
     
     Cheers,

Impressive technology, I had no idea about this, but there may be a few 
differences for starships hiding compared to subs

- - Range. Even with techonological advances, it would probably be difficult to 
do this kind of scan from more than one or two BL hexes out. 

- - Depth. With the armour of a typical SDB it could hide much deeper than a 
modern sub - this might make it harder to spot?

- - Also, the drives would only be necessary to actually move the SDB into place, 
once it was in position it could just sit and wait. It wouldn\'t even be 
necessary to use the drive to surface, as turning on the contra grav and 
pumping water out of the tanks could produce a significant upthrust.

Hiding underwater probably still makes sense.
- - (Assuming magnetic scanners are short ranged) it hides you from long range 
scanners.
- - It makes you largely immune to lasers, particle accelerators, and 
conventional missiles (the laser communicator for the guidance wouldn\'t work 
underwater, even if it didn\'t burn up on re-entry or detonate on impact with 
the water)
- - You can still fire back with missiles and meson guns. 

An advantage for the defender even with magnetic scanners, I think...

        Agreed. I believe the P3 has to be flying at a few hundred feet to
have a chance of detecting a shallow sub. Perhaps there are some Navy types
on the list who can come up with a few (unclassified) numbers?

>- Depth. With the armour of a typical SDB it could hide much deeper than a 
>modern sub - this might make it harder to spot?

        Everybody seems to think spacecraft hulls are automatically stressed
to handle high pressures, but I\'m not so sure. They\'re intended to (a)
resist stresses cause by approx 1 atm pushing _out_, not 100 atm pushing
_in_, and (b) survive _localized_ impacts (particles, weapons, etc.).
They\'re not built for the structural stresses of deep submergence.
        Of course, now we get into the argument of "holy canon," which says
1 atm internal and 100 atm external produce the same stresses. And I\'ll
admit, it makes a great idea at first blush, and most referees will
(rightly) ignore the details for the game\'s sake.

        True too -- as long as you don\'t move around.

>Hiding underwater probably still makes sense.

        I agree ... but I was just pointing out there are better ideas for
underwater propulsion than MHD. Ducted fans, MT\'s thruster plates, gravitic
or repulsor tunnels, etc.

All too true.  If we don\'t support the new Traveller, folks, there ain\'t gonna _be_ a

As I see it, there\'s going to be a wide variety of Traveller topics
and discussions that are going to \'spin-off\' with the creation of
the new game.  This is a fact that\'s shown itself to be true with
the advent of MegaTraveller and then The New Era.   There\'s no
reason it shouldn\'t happen again and many reasons that it 
should happen, especially NOW!

This is a very different situation that the second and third 
\'incarnations\' of Traveller.  They were re-vamps of the original
game system.  This time, they\'re doing it right and creating
and entirely new game system while using the \'skeleton\' of
the Classic Traveller as a framework and adding various 
useful \'organs\' gleened from sources that have shown true
value over the years.  This very concept lends itself to a
massive amount of debat on a wide variety of topics.

For this reason, I suggest a version of option #6.

There needs to INITIALLY be a place for all aspects of the 
gaming system to be ironed out.  There just isn\'t enough
room for everything to be done in a couple of publications
and on a timely basis.  With a multiplicity of lists, we could
attack each problem individually and deal with them.  Then,
when the interest in any one list wained, it could be dis-
continued with no problem.

There... do I make sense??

The reason for sabot rounds is simply:
Given a set muzzle velocity ie energy it is better to put a given mass in
as small as possible surface area. This has nothing to do with pen being
m x v / (cal^2) or m x v^2 /(cal ^2).
If pen was prop to energy and not impulse it wouldn\'t matter what mass the
projectile had as the proj would have the same energy no matter what.
This is nitpicking (from my part at least) and we should probably move this
to e-mail to stop bothering other listoids.

PS I think that my formula is more accurate when proj speeds approaches
soundspeed in armour and your when proj speed is considerably lower like
small arms. Also for very low speed projs like thrown knifes et c your
formula is way off DS

One BIG problem with discussions about sensors in Traveller is that
everybody seems to think that rules of thumb of todays sensors translate to
the future.
For instance using radars at the ranges used in BL & BR is a nobrainer.
Passive sensors diminish at 1/(r^2) while active diminish at 1/(r^4) ie
radars are useless in spacecombat, not only because telling the enemy where
you are.
Another problem is that whenneutrino sensors are available you cannot hide
anymore. No fusion powered stealthy submarines anymore. The only way to
hide a fusion plant is (I think) with the sun at your back. When practical
neutrino sensors are available there could of course be possible to shield
neutrinos as well.

Ah, but the turbulant atmospheres of gas giants are supposed to create similar
pressures (and don\'t find yourself within the actual _liquid_ hydrogen of a gas
giant or you\'ll be facing pressures in excess of 3,000,000 ATMs!).  Does anyone
out there have any figures or formulae for determining Atmospheric pressures at
different depths?

Part of the concept behind SDBs is that they *begin* hidden under water and
you\'re not supposed to have even the faintest idea where to start looking.  If
you want to go hunting SDBs, you\'ll have a LOT of surface area to cover (trivia
question: how long would it take a P-3 Orion to do one sweep over the entire
hydrosphere of a planet identical to ours?).  The SDB wouldn\'t have to hide
itself *that* well, relying instead on the shear unlikelyhood of their location
being the starting point of a search attempt.  SDBs might even make use of
underwater caves and revines to shield themselves.

The weapon specialization is TOTALLY unrelated to your weapon skill LEVEL.

Specialization makes your skill more usefull at any level that it is
possessed, and requires IIRC a minimum of level 1 in the weapon skill, but
a person with a skill of 1/2 could be level III specialized (Why bother,
though), and specializations are not able to be gained during CGen, only
during play, via Experience Points

The Source for this nifty (anf oft misunderstood) rule is T2K\'s d20 upgrade
booklet, which appeared (in my experience) only in the Referee\'s Screen for
T2K.

Again, specializations are BOUGHT SEPARATELY.

At the next tech level to ours(TL8), anything underwater would show up in an 
orbital sweep, either fixed instalation, or a spaceship in orbit. And 
spaceships produce a lot of heat, even with its reactor off. Like a desil 
sub today, body heat from the crew, machinery, electrical radiation and 
secondary engines show up on a heat scan.
Eithen the metal will affect the magnetic fields, as noted in the origanal 
part of the thread.

Space is a better place to hide. Its bigger for one, and heat dissapation 
would be hidden better.

True. But its makes role playing easier if people have a common reference. 
But I know radar techs tell me that something I was running was blatently 
wrong, even though I justifed it to the way I percieved technolagy to 
behave. Its a compramise, realism and the \'wow\' technology.

Why? Surely drones or small ships can give radar infomation without 
revealing locations of main ships. Otherwise, all those Hawkeyes on Carriers 
today must be a waste of space.

Black globes. No radiation in, no radiation out. Ultimate stealth fields.

Just a thought ( he says donning his Battledress ) but why don\'t we
finally get a Traveller newsgroup set up. It would certainly make
thread following a lot easier ( my biggest gripe with the current
lists ). I can understand that in the past a mailing list was probably
the only way to bring in people on the proprietary networks, but now
that they all seem to be providing Internet access is this still a
problem? If it is then I know that you can have combined
list/newsgroups.

Thoughts??

But how do you dissipate heat in space?  Since space is a near-vacuum, there is
nothing to transfer the unwanted heat TO.  Some of the heat naturally radiates
as infra-red but heat build-up on spacecraft is still a big issue.  One possible
way today would be to transfer the heat to the excess water vapour produced by
the burning of hydrogen and oxygen aboard the spacecraft, and ejecting the
matter (along with the stored heat) out into space.

cents worth.

Sure, neutrino sensors will make fusion reactors stand out. So what?
Fusion is merely the most *convenient* power source. Fission reactors
produce neutrinos, but if I recall correctly, they produce *anti*-
neutrinos, while fusion produces neutrinos. That makes a *big*
difference in detection. It\'s quite likely that sensors will have to be
"tuned" for one or the other.

Energy spectrum makes a difference too. High energy neutrinos are going
to be harder to detect than low energy ones.

So, fission plants are one possibility. Finding a way to "tune" the
energy level of the neutrino output may or may not be possible. Ditto
for shielding. Either of the last two could be considered as "partially
stealthed" fusion reactors. (Ie costs more, but harder to detect)

But there are still a lot of *completely* stealthy power sources (at
least as far as neutrino emissions are concerned). Since we are talking
about "submarines" the first idea that springs to mind is batteries. As
I recall, Traveller has some *damn* good batteries.

So, the ship can have a *huge* battery bank. That lets it have life
support for a *long* time, move slowly, and even fire missiles or other
"low power" weapons. For moving quickly or firing heavy weapons, you
kick in the fusion plant, fire and *move*, then kill the fusion plant
and make a course change while continuing on batteries (which got a
fast recharge while the reactor was up).

For things like deep meson sites, or even just seabottom bases,
geothermal power is *more* than adequate. Drill a shaft deep into the
crust and use the temperature differential to generate power. You\'ll
just look like another undersea volcano. 

If you are a deep site, you use the temp differential between different
parts of the crust or between the crust and mantle. This generates less
power per unit area, but you can build *big*. And the miles of rock
above will effectively eliminate any thermal signature. 

Heck, it might even be possible to generate power from the currents of
molten rock in the magma. Now *that* would be a power plant. Low speed,
but *very* high mass flow. 

However, all is not good news. There\'s a *much* under rated sensor that
is going to make SDBs hiding in oceans *or* gas giants very vulnerable.
The mass detector.

Even with the crude units we have now we can easily forsee being able
to detect the *major* density discontinuties represents by a ship in
water or a gas giant\'s atmosphere.

I understand the US Navy has been *very* interested in mass detectors.
Of course, any improvements they\'ve come up with are classified. 

Oh yeah, it\'s vitually certain that *however* CG works, it\'ll stick out
like a sore thumb on a mass detector. Thruster plates may or may not.

        And thoroughly cooked crews? All that heat _has_ to go somewhere, so
the time you spend in a black globe is probably limited.

It\'s called "black body radiation".  ANYTHING with a temperature (i.e. not
absolute 0) radiates thermal energy (read "light" or "elecromagnetic
radiation".  Practical proof: it gets warm during the day.  You feel
thermal energy that the sun radiates across the 92 million odd miles
of vacuum between us and it.  The weird/interesting thing about Black-Body
radiation, is that that it is completely dependant on the temperature of
the object, and completely independant of the material of which the
object is composed.

I was thinking heat convection, ie , the cold of space would "suck" the heat 
out. If this needs matter, then I am wrong. So be it.

I don\'t really see the point of finding out how long it would take a 
P-3 to do a sweep of the Earth\'s hydrosphere, or, for that matter, 
discussion of todays MADs [magnetic anomaly detectors] in the context 
of Traveller.  Traveller is set in the future -- according to canon, 
technology is going to get much better (reach farther, work faster, 
etc.).

Extrapolating optimistically, you can (I think) safely assume that 
anybody attacking on a planet that hides its SDBs in the first place 
will just hang about outside the atmosphere and use neutrino counts 
or something to find the little buggers. 

And, no.  IMHO, ravines and underwater caves won\'t stop anybody from 
finding them (sub-atomic particles tend to fly right thru rock and 
water).

I think that you miss Phil\'s point.  Sure, we can\'t/don\'t make 286s
anymore, but take your generic $1000+ XT clone from that era.  OK, how
much does it cost to make a computer that meets the same benchmarks
(speed, memory, etc.?)  I bet a Newton can out perform the XT gathering
dust in my shed, and it\'s maybe 1/2 a kilo and the size of an
addressbook.  It is also somewhat cheaper.

Since the tech in traveller is grouped by the specs it meets, that\'s
what you need to look at.

So why would we expect a computer manufacturer on a TL15 world to make
a computer (using TL15 tech) that has does a fraction of what their top
of the line does, but takes up much more room?  At the very least you
could allow that even if it were the same price as it would be at TL12,
it should at least be the smaller size at all times if made at a higher
TL.

That was my point but I don\'t think it translated into words very well  8-)
Convection requires a moving air or fluid (eg: convection ovens) to transfer
heat from hot objects and carry it away.  Radiated heat (ie: IR) moves at the
speed of light, transferring its heat energy to objects which it collides with
(walls, dust, water vapour, etc.).

In all fairness, the few scattered hydrogen (etc.) atoms in a typical vacuum are
individually extremely HOT (something on the level of plasma).  But since there
are so few atoms in a particular volume of space, the temperature is "averaged"
down to a few degrees above absolute zero.

Nope, conduction is a much more effecient means of heat dissapation than
radiation.
NASA has problems figuring out how to keep their spacecraft cool.
I think the ocean would be a great place to hide.  Im a Navy helo driving type

        I tried to check this out, and then send e-mail to the address
listed there. I keep getting the message back with the error "Exceeded the
maximum number of hops," so I thought I\'d try passing my comment on to you.
If you\'re not an appropriate person for this, I apologise.

        Unfortunately, I can\'t comment on the page itself, because it\'s
virtually illegible. The dark blue text and the black background force me to
touch my nose to my monitor before I can make anything out, and my
eyesight\'s bad enough already.
        In fact, one of my pet peeves is Web sites that change
foreground/background colors. First of all, the original intent of HTML/Web
was to provide _content_, while letting the user\'s system determine the
_format_. Another reason it bothers me is too many people don\'t do it right
... if you change some of the colors, you _must_ change them all. Users may
have configured their browser to use your text color as their link color.
Now how are they supposed to tell the difference between normal text and a
link, if they\'re both the same color? And when you change the colors, you\'re
overriding the way _they want_ to see web pages.

        Just a few comments.

    'body' => 'Hi,

I am going to start a new Traveller Campaign in the next couple of
weeks, its going to be set in the Reformation Coalition.  I thought
that would better with my players, who have never played Traveller
before. Anyway I was trying to come up with major plot to happen in
the background of the campaign. Here is what I came up with.

After the collapse, the Hivers started to wonder what to do with the 
humans.  After a long discussion period, which probably involved several
manipulations, the Hivers decided to help wolrds with a progressive
outlook expand.  The Hivers reasoned that this way the new human
empire would a good neighbor, rather than if a Xenophobic Empire
arose, and would eventually draw the Federation into a war.

Most Hivers agree with this, but not all.   Some feel that the 
Humans are too dangerous to be allowed to form any interstellar 
government at all.  Some thought that humans should be exterminated,
others thought that was a bit extreme, and humans just needed to 
be nudged into a more friendly form. This thought that the humans
should be absorbed into the Federation.  Others thought humans
should be kept primitive and not allowed to develop advanced technology.

These dissedent hivers have formed a Shadow Nest, which is a loose
network of Hivers. About 20 Manipulators, several hundred normal
hivers.  Some are secretly working inside of the Reformation Coalition,
others have secret bases int eh Wilds where they plot doom for the
humans.  Others are working in the Federation to sabotage the Federation
plans to help the Coalition and othe rhuman worlds.  

The Shadow Nest has dozens of different plans going.  They sell
biological and nuclear weapons to low tech balkanized worlds, hoping
they will kill themselves off. One faction is trying to build up other
human pocket empires, and manipulating them into conflict with the 
RC, hoping that in the war, the humans will finish the job the Collapse
started.  Others are trying to genetically engineer humans into a more
acceptable form.  They manipulate the Coalition into engaging in violent
smash and grab missions which alienate the native population.  
The Shadow Nest will do anything which divides humans, kills large 
numbers of humans.

The Shadow Nest will be the major villian behind many of the adventures
I run in my campaign.  Its a bit a of the Illuminati, and hopefully will
make the players quite paranoid.  

So what do you think?  Does it sound reasonable, any ideas on how
to help the Shadow Nest destroy the humans?

Me too.  I already posted to Ken directly expressing my thanks.
Wouldn\'t it be nice if several of the Imperium Games folks were
regular contributors to the lists!  At least were regular lurkers...or
*are* they already? <g>

BTW, how can we do an interview on a mailing list?

I suggested the interview take place on the Internet Relay Chat (IRC). 
Now that ImpGames has direct access to the net all they need to do is
set up an IRC client and post a time and channel.

I\'d be there, wouldn\'t you? <g>

ps.  There isn\'t much on the web page yet, and it was hard to read

Classic Traveller: I liked its simplisity, an adventure could created and
modified 	Quickly. The Antebellum Period provided a stable enviorment to setup
	campains. The JTAS was a good source for adventure ideals and 	expermently
rules.
Mega Traveller: DGP\'s Task System can\'nt be beat for its easy of use and
	flexiblity.
New Era Traveller: I am one of those wierd persons that liked it. The best thing
	about it, is you can design your own weapons. The idea of having 	different
campian settings was basicly sound. There was just no outside 	support. Though I
liked the Regency, I couldn\'t stand the Coalition. The 	whole setting was so
onesided. I would liked to have been the Tech Priest 	preventing the infidels
from violating the Oracle of Knowledge 	(9/fib c	omputer).

Sorry, but the pc was extremely lucky. If You don\'t roll an outstanding 
success You should interpret the shot as a near miss (for Plasma/Fusion guns)
or a bare hit(for bullet weapons) just touching the skin of the target.
And, as in reality, in TNE the most hits are of this type.(I have a table
about the percentage of people killed by bullets in WWII, and over 50%
survived HEAD shots. I know someone, who was hit by a bullet to the
head, the bullet travelled between his head and his helmet along his
upper head and left. There is still a visible scare, but he suffered just
a scratch wound from a head shot(something that almost never happens in
TNE). 

About the "You can\'t miss in point blank range". I know of an incident, 
where a soldier with a LATW missed a Tank at 5 metres, because he was 
so stunned by the gigantic mass of metal appearing just before him.
Another thing: If someone fires at true short range(ie below 2
metres or so) I rule an automatic outstanding success if the shot hits.
Also at this distance, weapons are usually pointed at the head. Also,
please don\'t cry if the system doesn\'t work if You ignore some rules
(ie sudden death). I can\'t understand it, You are saying
"Oh the pc\'s can\'t die suddenly in the TNE system, and we just removed

	Most ships are powered by fusion which produces helium from 
hydrogen.  There\'s still no reason, as far as I can see, that the 
hydrogen used in HEPLAR thrusters couldn\'t be "pre-heated" by the excess 
heat on the ship and used to remove it.  This might even make the heplar 
thrusters marginally more efficient by using "waste" heat instead of 
reactor output to heat reaction mass.

If you are going to extrapolate sensors, then you *must* extrapolate the
technologies developed specifically to defeat those sensors.  Apply
"Stealth Bomber" technology to high-tech submarines and you once again have
an extremely invisible and potent offensive asset at your disposal.

There is *no* sensor that cannot be defeated, given time.

Omniscience does not exist.

I repeat: Passive sensors diminish at 1/(r^2) while active diminish at 1/(r^4),
therefore they\'re pretty useless at the ranges used in BL, BR.

The Imperium cannot manufacture black globes and TNE shure cannot. How many
of those are there? Grandfather must\'ve been really sloppy if he left a
large number of them laying around after wiping out his children.

Apply the Marconi radars on most French and some British ships and you
once again have an extreme waste of time and money.

For those unaware of the facts: the American military were apparently
rather upset when French frigates in the Gulf could see their
multi-million dollar stealth planes.

There is no "Stealth Technology" that can not be overcome, with a
little bit of thought.

Anyone looked at the amp in their car (provided you have a certain level
of power...)?  Are there any reasons anyone can think of that heat
"baffles" or sinks on the outer hull, made of a heat conducting materials,
of course, wouldn\'t work?  Sure you wouldn\'t want to use it if you were
trying to be on the stealthy side, but I see no reason that the increased
surface area provided wouldn\'t dissipate energy that much quicker.  It
certainly seems more efficient than trying to eject the heat by containing
it in waste particles.

If you\'re really desperate to see what\'s there and you can\'t easily change
colours interactively within your web browser then save the page to disk (in
"source", i.e. HTML format) and edit the TEXT="#000000" (in the first line
or two) to read TEXT="#FFFFFF".

It\'s just changing the RGB colour codes from black to white. Alternatively
if you just delete the TEXT option then you should probably get the standard
colour for your display. You can change the background colour too, etc. etc.

Needless to say I\'ve sent my own comment to Imperium Games. I didn\'t get a
bounce or anything from the IG site, so I assume it got through ok.

TRAVELLER CHARACTER GENERATOR

I need to update the Traveller Character Generator program which I posted to
the ftp.engrg.uwo.ca site some years ago. The copy there was a beta test
version with a limited lifetime which has now expired; in order to avoid
anyone downloading the program and then finding they can\'t run it, I need to
update the copy.

So, who\'s administrating "sunbane"? Who do I need to contact? Please reply
directly to my e-mail address. Thanks.

Biological and nuclear weapons are overkill. Give the humans sharp flints
and you can still pretty much guarantee they\'ll try to wipe themselves out.
Plus this way the planet\'s left habitable for the Hivers and they get to
watch much longer bloodier wars, which they would probably find much more

I don\'t know that neutrino sensors are all the\'re cracked up to be.
Granted, Traveller tech is different from earth tech, but currently,
neutrino sensors are VERY unweildy things (a couple of tons of chlorine in
a tank), and not very accurate at all.  We have only been able to detect
one third of the neutrinos that should be emitted by the sun, should it
function by fusion.  ...Which means: either the sun doesn\'t function by
fusion reaction (and that kind of throws a monkey wrench in everything),
OR, 2/3rds of fusion emitted neutrinos are VERY hard to detect.

Thoughts?  Remember we catch very few neutrinos.  If I recall correctly,
it takes about a cubic mile of pure lead to stop all neutrinos passing
through it.  And remember all of the fusion drives in Traveller (that I\'ve
seen) produce a fraction of the power of the sun, and hence, a fraction of
the neutrinos.  Are there any Physicists/Astronomers out there that can
tell me if I am remembering correctly?

If so, it would take the instantaneous nature of detection out of neutrino
sensors.  It would then return to something along the lines of reading a
very good passive sonar array.

Plus, there weren\'t any links anywhere, so no need to fiddle with it.

        Now I understand they\'ve got a special offer on a hardcover version
of T4, signed by MM himself? That sounds really interesting, but I still
don\'t know if I\'ll blow my money on T4. I really want to see what it\'s like,
first. All I\'ve heard depresses me more and more ... no detailed design
system, 70\'s era rules ...

Well, given strong/weak force control at higher TLs (dampers) it might
be possible to catch more neutrinos (maybe increase the cross section of
the detector with magic force control?)----then you\'d use an array of
detectors to shield one in the middle so you could get some
directionality (since detectors of this type would be better shielding
than a few klicks of lead :).

Now, given a sensor that would actually fit in a ship, we could talk
about signal to noise ratios.  Since other than detectors, nothing
shields neutrinos well there would be a whole lot of noise from all
directions.  Add to this that if it is possible to shield a detector,
it\'s possible to shield a drive and the chances of useful neutrino
detectors drops a bunch.  If the drive is reactionless, then there isn\'t
even an open hole at the back----your PP is shielded by "detector" tech,
and you\'re invisible neutrino wise.  Or at least you get the emission to
the large background level.

I don\'t think they\'d be very useful.

When I initially mentioned transferring heat away in waste particles (like water
vapour) I was commenting on how today\'s astronauts deal with heat build-up in a
vacuum.  Heat baffles such as you describe _would_ work quite well in an
atmosphere or under water but not in a vacuum.

There are three main ways to radiate heat away from an object.  One would be
direct Infra-Red radiation (eg: a light bulb).  The second is conduction,
involving direct contact with another object (eg: a soldering iron).  The third
is by way of convection (eg: the fins on a high-powered amplifier).

Convection is identical to conduction, except that the primary heat exchanger
(ie: water, air, etc.) is constantly moving.  Heat is transferred from the hot
internal components inside the object to the cooling fins (via conduction) and
the moving air draws away the waste heat.  Convection works best if their is a
large temperature difference between the air/water and the object being cooled.
If the air is already hot, it doesn\'t work nearly as well.  This is also true in
a vacuum, where there are very few particles to transmit this heat TO (and these
*individual* particles are already quite HOT).  Transferring the heat to
something that you are going to throw away anyway is one solution.  Radiation
fins are also a problem when it comes to streamlining a vessel.

IR detectors detect only radiated heat, either directly radiated from the target
object or from the radiating atmospheric particles that have been in contact
with the target (and absorbed some of its heat energy via conduction).

Think of it this way... after drinking a beer on a nice hot day, you can either
wait around all day to sweat it out of you or you can simply dump it as waste
particles.  The latter is obviously easier and more satisfying  8-)

A fairly obvious question presents itself.  

    Why not create a newsgroup AND keep the list going?

This may seem foolish and double effort on the part of all concerned, but
look at it this way.... Traveller has enjoyed a pretty good following in it\'s
years.... but game systems like D&D have been positively meteoric in their
growth.  Why?  As Andrew stated in his post, it\'s a matter of profile or
visibility... read that as good advertisement.....  The fantasy style games
have gotten good press over the years from various sources... but just how
much press have the sci-fi games gotten??  None that I can remember.... 
Maybe Andrew here is on to something that we should take a good hard look
at... maybe this is the wedge that our particular type of system needs to
slide into that sci-fi universe out there.... I wonder.... would Sci-Fi Buzz
on the Sci-Fi channel be interested in the New Traveller???   Couldn\'t hurt
to find out....  Marc?<g>

Ah, but extend the example a bit further - if I want to run Digger (a
favourite game from my college years) I need an XT/AT with CGA graphics,
or a very close copy.  Nothing else will do.  A Newton, a P6 or an Alpha
will not run Digger for me.
Now say I need Digger to run my reactor or my navigation systems, I\'m in
some trouble.  I\'m going to have to either go from garage sale to garage
sale until someone sells me their decaying old hardware or I\'m going to
have to have once-off, custom hardware or software produced for me. 
This is probably going to cost serious cash (always assuming I can
specify what I want accurately enough).

The whole area of technology, TL\'s and pricing in Traveller is a messy,
infuriating one (but only if you think about it :>).  

Hopefully the Imperium team will come up with a solution that will keep
the majority of us happy.

It takes MUCH more than a mile of lead to stop all neutrinos.
Todays neutrino "sensors" are totally useless in detecting fusion drives
etc but the neutrino sensors given in MT and TNE are supposed to do just
that (check out the rules), either the referee don\'t allow neutrinosensors
in his campaign or he allows them and has to come up with reasons why SDBs
stay undetected.
In my campaign deep mesonguns are huge mobile subs that run on MHD turbines
and when it is time for action they start their fusion plants, shoot a bit,
switch off and try to move to another location.

No heat baffles dissipate heat by air passing by and doesn\'t work in space.
One way of increasing the surface area of a spaceship is having two plates
with opposite charge and passing hot, charged particles between them. In my
campaign the the engine looking nozzles at the back of all shipdesigns are
in fact heat dissipators that push superheated hydrogen iones out of one
nozzle and receive them in the other noticeably cooler (they could of
course just eject the heated hydro and never receiving them, this would
account for the extreme fuelconsumtion for MT fusion plants). The reason
they\'re at the back of ships is to avoid hitting them when accelerating.
I think this idea was used in Pilots handbook or whatever its name was.

You run your digger on SoftWindows on your 180 MHz PPC 604. Almost all
dinkytoys computers from the 70s, PC included, have emulators that can run
their software.
There\'s even a Sinclair Spectrum emulator that uses the macs sound input
the read old software tapes for the spectrum.
My point is that if there\'s a need to run old software etc from obsolete
tech then sombody will make an emulator that can do it ie no need to
produce lower tech items on higher techs.

not... I originally envisioned only a few habitable planets in the

anyone know a program out there which will allow me to enter data

just that I was unable to change the core programming (i.e. no hex

start generating TNE or MT stuff *that* is the program to check out.

        Baffles also increase the surface area radiating heat, and therefore
_will_ give you some benefit in space. You just won\'t get the convective
heat transfer you do in an atmosphere.

Space actually has a fairly high temperature!  Not much heat, being so thin,
but \'hot\'.

In space you lose energy (heat) by radiation only.  You can only lose heat by
conduction when you are in contact with something.  (Convention is just
conduction to a circulating fluid.)

A big problem in working close to a star will be heat buildup.  This will
also be a problem with large power plants operating in a stealthed ship.  How
much attention you want to give this depends on how realistic you want your
game.  (One of my players - a physicist - used to do black body
calculations!)

We don\'t know.  <g> I think the current theory is that most
main-sequence stars will have companions..either a binary pair or
planets of some sort.  Binary systems are unlikely to have terran-like
planets..just a few gas giants or ice balls far out. Solitary stars
between F5V and M0V are the best bets for terran-like planets.

Galactic is close to real Traveller rules, and real Traveller is sort
of based on *lots* and *lots* of habitable planets.  <g> You can find
programs that give more *realistic* results than Galactic...and I\'m
*not* knocking Galactic. I *like* it\'s results.

Not on a sector at a time.  If you are willing to generate a system at
a time and manually convert the data to UWP then contact:

    p6inf282@cicrp.jussieu.fr (Aina RASOLOMALALA)

He/she (I don\'t have the slightest idea which Aina would be), has
developed a good extended system generation program called STAR. He
pulls ideas from Accrete, Traveller, 2300, and other sources to
produce very good systems.  He sent me the source, in pascal, to
compile so I could modify the parameters if I wanted.  

You might want to find Accrete, start looking at
http://www.clark.net/pub/nyrath/starmap.html, this is a *good* page on
3-D Starmaps with lots of links..one of which leads to the Accrete
program.

Drop by Logicrucible\'s home page, http://www.logicrucible.com, and
look at the specs of Astrologicus.  I bought it two years ago and use
it in a couple of games.  The details aren\'t UWP based, but the detail
and modifiabilty is good.  Downside is the $$$. <g>

Personally, I\'m only interested in generating complete systems, not
just main worlds.  I want details on the star and all planets, because
my players spend several days to several weeks in each system.

I\'m in the very early stages of creating such a program myself. It
will include random generation with optional customizations. My
algorithm doesn\'t match Traveller\'s too closely, but it\'ll produce
UWPs..plus lots more eventually. <g>

That\'s true, but you\'d need *very* big baffles if you wanted to depend
on convection!  <g> Standard design in my games is for ships to get
rid of waste heat by venting coolant...often through extendible fins
or baffles.

A point I\'ve *never* seen brought up is the heat build up inside a
ship while it is in Jump Space.  A week of heat build up in a perfect
vacuum bottle would roast the crew in their own juices!

In my universe, a ship has to continuously dump waste heat, and the
only way to do it is to expel some sort of coolant.  This is where the
majority of the jump "fuel" goes..not fuel for the jump, but coolant.

I use both jump coils and a jump grid in my setup.  The grid in the
hull insulates the ship\'s interior from the Jump Space (Jspace)
environment, providing protection for the crew from "jump psychosis." 
The grid needs power to stay up, and can fail or degrade with all
kinds of game consequences.  The coils are what tears open the door
from normal space (Nspace) to Jspace, they aren\'t needed while a ship
is in Jspace.  A ship automatically comes out of Jspace by nearing a
gravity source..a star. 

In my game, ships can only jump from far away from a star to very near
a star (or other high grav source).  This forces players to travel
across every star system, from where they enter (near the star), to
where they can jump out (some number of AU away from the star).

For in system travel I don\'t use reaction drives..or thruster plates
for that matter.  <g>

If anyone is interested, I\'ll post my variant.

Mmmm... tasty!

Perhaps the waste heat can be converted back to electricity via a
technologically advanced Therelectric Converter for use in maintaining the jump
field while in J-space (or built up and stored in the ship\'s Jump Capacitors).
Extra heat energy could also be transmitted to the microwave oven in the ship\'s

If any one wants to go through the process of creating a news group, more
power to them.  However, this list will remain and as list administrator, I 
will not support any attempts to rationalize the new news groups by claiming
a conversion from an existing mailing list.  As administrator, I have no
intentions on letting this list die.  I was not handed the reigns by the creator
to just close its doors.  This list has a long successful history and I think
it has a long successful future.

Here are my reasons for not supporting the news group idea:

Netnews is out of control.  A full news feed cannot be transmitted over a T1
without falling behind.  Netnews\' days are numbered.  Between the web, and
the total amount of worthless spam in the news groups, administrators are
less likely to want to carry netnews.  We receive a restricted feed of just
alt.,comp.,rec., and sci. (less alt.binaries).  Even then, as much as I have 
been a big news advocate for the past 12 years, find myself asking why?

So as diskspace becomes more precious, and so does bandwidth, admins will look
for things to eliminate.  News is at the top of the heap.  If sites stop
having netnews, then our group dies with it.  Mailing lists are more popular
than ever right now because they are not open to spam, they are low bandwidth
and they are effective.

I would like to ask a favor of the subscribers.  Please drop this thread and
return to discussing Traveller.  I have no intention of making any changes
in the lists or creating a new list until the new game takes shape and we have
a clearer picture about its make up.  Any discussion about what to do is very
pre-mature at this point.  Lets wait a few months.  If we let this kind of
thread die, and go back to discussing the game, and traffic looks like it 
warrents it, I will create a special, short term list for discussing the future
(i.e. news.groups) where we can rationally discuss the various options.  I 
like to think of this list as your list, since you are the people that makes
the list, so your opinion is very very important.  But my job as administrator
is to keep things in focus and maintain the lists.  At this point, there is
no need to change things, and there may never be.  Let it die, and we will
fix it when it breaks.

Thanks for your understanding
Rob

In my campaign I apply a DM of -1 for each neutrino source within detection
range to pin-pointing any specific neutrino source. That means that if the
world has a few dozen fusion plants, any ship is quite safe unless the
searcher is nearer to them than to any other neutrino source. And ships
jumping into remote parts of a high-traffic star system can expect to
remain undetected if they are reasonably lucky. Works quite well.

Will you be doing any work on making the economic systems (living expenses,

With an IR sensor (EMS sensor), are you detecting the heat generated by the
power plant operation or the exhaust from the engines? If it is the exhaust
from the engines, then surely once you have finished acceleration, then you
can shut the manuver drives down therefore creating no more exhaust (ie. no
more heat sig.). If the sensors are picking up the heat from the power
plants operation, then surely you could run a coolant arround it and
shrouding the heat signature. By encasing the power plant with a outer
shell of, say liquid hydrogen or nitrogen, then the heat would be
transfered to the liquid gas and the signature radiating out would be less.

This is just a way I thought up to ease the problem of the heat sig.
effect. The rate of exchange of the liquid gas would need to be calculated
with regards to the power/heat output of the ship to see if it would be
effective.

Just a final note but something to think about. I\'ve a friend and his 
brother back home in my tax haven who used to go hunting rabbits with 
an elephant gun (we have these things left over from the Empire you 
know), they discovered the most effective way to stop a fast moving 
bunny aws not to shoot at it, but to fire at the ground near it, the 
resulting impact would either cause a concusion wave to stun the 
rabbit of else the round would fragment and do bunny in. According to 
my sources though fatalities were quite high in our fluffy tailed 
friends, there normally was not much worth eating, apparantly a 
direct hit would leave a smooking fluffy tail but no rabbit. 
Kinder of like firing plasma/fusion guns at lightly armoured people, 
though let\'s be honest that\'s what a RAM GL loaded with Flechette is 
for and a whole lot easier.
Hope I didn\'t spoil any of your diners, I yet to tell you my sticking

But then where does the heat go...it will still have to be removed from
the ship somehow, lest one encounter the "jump-cooker" effect that some
(devious) person postulates...

What prevents ship designers from using Black Globe type systems to absorb
heat energy and return electically storable (and reusable) energy?

What would the detection range of a neutrino detector be?  We could look
at the deBroglie wavelength of a neutrino and do some angular resolution
numbers (making some assumptions about detector size vs. resolution for
neutrinos) and go for some minimum resolution I guess.

Do stars count for this?  say every background star within some solid
angle of the target area being swept by the sensor?

If the detection range has to do with signal to noise then we need a
ballpark figure for a powerplant, then an idea on the background.

I still have the feeling that even with magic strong/weak control
neutrino detectors would be very short range critters (100s-1000s of km
at most (off the top of my head)).

This is kinda cool, actually.  You\'d get them appearing with damper
tech, and they\'d be used in astronomy and for scans from orbit.  You
might be able to make out really big PPs from low orbit assuming they
weren\'t shielded using the same tech that allows you to make the
detector in the first place (remember, you have to be able to stop the
thing to detect it for the most part----so you can then use the
technology as a shielding material).

Starships operators manual is MT and the Traveller novels is TNE ie
different universes and different laws of physics. Antimatter is too high a
TL to use in either MT or TNE but other energy sources could do.

Another note about LHyd as fuel: If LHyd is required and jump dependent on
volume of ship then an important issue would be to pack as much hydrogen
per volume as possible, right? Then on X-boats and other ships where mass
is not as important one could make the fueltanks out of solid Titan. It is
possible to pack at least 10 times as much hydrogen into solid Titan than
in empty fueltanks! An even better material would be Palladium which has
even better hydrogen packing abilities but it is a bit expensive <g>.

OK, to get this straight the surface area for thermal radiation is not the
same as what we normally consider surface area. A sphere with a smooth
surface has the same radiating surface as a wrinkled one in this regard.
The reason for this is simply put if you have two adjacent baffles
radiating they will simply radiate onto one another and no heat exchange to
the universe occurs. The area in use is something like the projected
surface of the ship/object averaged over all viewing angles. This is
obviously nitpicking (on my part) but the problem with heat dissipation
remains and I think some sort of superheated mass ejection and/or
electrostatic cooling cloud has to be used if one want realistic rules.

If the sensor is picking up the sharp temp at parts of the ship surface
then the coolants would work but if the problem is the total heat generated
then the cooling will only smooth the heat distribution over a larger area.
IR stealth tech on tanks etc are distributing the heat over the entire
surface of the tank and do not actually cool it down. In vacuum you cannot
cool things down by any other means than radiation or exhausts, neither is
good if you want to stay undetected.

these systems often have planets.  Is this realistic?  I seem to remember
from a first year astronomy class that their is no analytical solution to
the N-body problem in astronomy for N > 2.

Translation please, Mr Spock.

It is quite easy to calculate the orbit of a planet around a star, of of one
star around another, using Newtonian physics.  Because only two bodies are
involved this is called the two-body problem.  Although there are 10
significant bodies in the solar system, the two-body equations provide an
accurate description of their movements because one body (the sun) so so
much more massive than the others, and the planets are so small and so far
apart that their effect on one another is negligible. ( this is a gross
simplification!)

The problem arises when trying to calculate the motion of a small body under
the gravitational influence of two bodies of comparable size; for example, a
planet in a binary star system.  This is the 3-body problem, and it really
is a problem because there is no analytical (i.e. exact)solution to it.
This is not because astronomers are not bright enough to solve it, its just
that there really is no solution to the equations.  High speed computers are
used to generate closer and closer approximations to the solution.

These computer solutions show that there is no stable orbit for the small
body (the planet).  Any planet in a binary (or higher order) system will
describe a chaotic orbit and will eventually be ejected from the system
altogether (after a few million orbits)

What does all this technobabble mean for traveller players?  It means that
the ~60% of star systems that are of binary or higher order cannot have
planets (including the all-important gas-giant filling-stations) and that
the universe is therefore much more difficult to get around in.

Can any real astronomer confirm or deny the above?

I hope you were taking notes, because there will now be a short test..... :-)

These emulators would only work when you\'re talking about software.  Yes,

programs.  I think I\'ll go out and buy a pentium and program an emulator."
Most programmers already have the capital investment they need, and once
they invest the initial time, the product can be sold multiple times with
negligible expense.  A power coupling or data transfer cable on the other
had requires raw materials and manpower and equipment for each item
produced.  Unless there is a grand market for these items, the return on
investment just wont be large enough for anyone to invest in the production
of them.

There is a solution to the three-body problem, but it is diffucult to find. To give
you an example the Troyan-astroids (located 60 degrees behind Jupiter in the Jupiter
orbit) is a solution to the Lagrange three-body eqaution, using the Sun, Jupiter and 
the asteroids

There are stable solutions but thaty are rare and rather strange. I quess it also
heavyly depends on the makeup of the system. A very heavy star circled by a white 
dwarf would give a Sun-Jupiter type system.

I\'m currently taking a beginners course in Astronomi and havn\'t gotten to the

Message-ID: <199604200205.TAA13943@mom.hooked.net>

With the impending release of T4, I find myself most excited by Milieu
0.  For me, the prospect of being there when it all starts gives an
almost unlimited potential for adventure.  I am going to explore a few
of the possibilities that have come to mind in the last few weeks.  A
copy of this is being sent to Marc Miller, in hopes that he might be
able to find something for me to do on the production of this book.

MILIEU 0:  The Sylean Federation was good enough for me!

One thing to consider is the birth pains of the new Imperium.  Despite
Cleon\'s PR campaign, many Sylean citizens are opposed to the new
government.  This opposition will range from angry editorials to
terrorist bombings.  An important test of the new order is their
reaction to this dissent; do they tolerate it in the name of an open
exchange of ideas, or crush it beneath the Imperial boot?

Many of the early nobles, drawn from the Sylean Navy and Senate, are
given grants of land in areas they already administered.  For most, life
will continue on with the introduction of a new level of social
interaction added to the mix.  There will be those, however, who find
the title an invitation to tyranny.  Some nobles will begin amassing
personal fortunes, start a little "empire-building" of their own, or
just engage in the type of anti-social behavior that has been expected
of the nobility throughout history.

THE SCOUT SERVICE:  The Brave, The Resourceful, The Short Lived

The transformation of the Sylean Survey Office into the Imperial
Interstellar Scout Service is likely to be traumatic.  For centuries,
the Survey had only been called upon to keep the maps up-to-date and
monitor local conditions inside the Federation; now, they are tasked
with exploring the whole of the old Imperium!

I must point out that the Scouts have almost no information about the
area beyond Federation borders.  They may have a vague idea where Earth,
Vland, and Hub are, but beyond that, nothing.  Every system is an
unknown.  (I would like to thank Mr. Miller and Imperium Games for
making the decision not to detail the sectors, leaving that job for the
gamemaster.)

Many Scouts in the first few decades of the Imperium would be drawn from
the edge of Federation space.  Offering the chance for adventure - with
the bonus that if you live long enough, you get to keep the ship you
serve on - will attract the numbers of recruits needed for the huge job
ahead.

The opportunities for a Traveller group are obvious:  Seeking out
strange new worlds, boldly going where no man has gone... oops, don\'t
want Paramount mad at us..  :)

DIPLOMACY:  How much for just the planet?

One area of Traveller that I always considered sadly neglected was
diplomacy.  As a long time fan of Keith Laumer\'s "Retief" stories, the
thought of adventures where wits, not firepower, were the solution
intrigues me.

The Third Imperium is going to need diplomats.  As it expands, the
Imperium will contact many cultures that have drifted far from the
cultural legacy left by the Rule of Man.  Since civilization will most
likely survive on the worlds most desirable to the Imperium, skilled
negotiators will be in demand.

Hey Phil,

I got your message, and I am replying to both the list and to you direct.  You

Subject: Dave Nilsen

I spoke to Dave Nilsen yesterday.  For the record, Dave is NOT burned
out on  gaming, although he was glad to get a vacation.  He is very busy
with his new  job working for the Army but is potentially interested in
joining these lists.  I gave him the addresses information for many 2300
and Traveller-related lists  and websites, including these two, and some
other interesting sites (such as  the 3D starmap, GDW-Beta, and the CJ
Cherryh sites).

He gave me permission to pass on his email address --
dnilsen@msn.com.  For  the record, I met Dave in person a few years
ago, and he took pretty much an  entire day to show me around GDW.

I told him about the idea on the 2300 list to recreate The Game for the
post-
2300 timeframe (although I did not give him any details, as I have not had
a  chance to read through that thread).  He tells me that he saved what
he could  of the original Game, including the map and some counters.  In
fact, he said  that he had just been in his garage 20 minutes before I
called, and as of  then, "the map still exists."

Also, the third volume of Paul Brunette\'s series may come out -- it\'s still 
being worked on, and they may get it published yet.  I hope so.

Through sheer random chance, my employer may  someday agree with
something I say.

If the sensor is picking up the sharp temp at parts of the ship surface
then the coolants would work but if the problem is the total heat
generated then the cooling will only smooth the heat distribution over a
larger area.
IR stealth tech on tanks etc are distributing the heat over the entire
surface of the tank and do not actually cool it down. In vacuum you
cannot cool things down by any other means than radiation or exhausts,
neither is good if you want to stay undetected.

Subject: Astro-babble.

Many star systems in Traveller are binaries.  In addition to the two stars
these systems often have planets.  Is this realistic?  I seem to remember
from a first year astronomy class that their is no analytical solution to the
N-body problem in astronomy for N > 2.

Translation please, Mr Spock.

It is quite easy to calculate the orbit of a planet around a star, of of one
star around another, using Newtonian physics.  Because only two
bodies are involved this is called the two-body problem.  Although there
are 10 significant bodies in the solar system, the two-body equations
provide an accurate description of their movements because one body
(the sun) so so much more massive than the others, and the planets are
so small and so far apart that their effect on one another is negligible. (
this is a gross simplification!)

The problem arises when trying to calculate the motion of a small body
under the gravitational influence of two bodies of comparable size; for
example, a planet in a binary star system.  This is the 3-body problem,
and it really is a problem because there is no analytical (i.e.
exact)solution to it.
This is not because astronomers are not bright enough to solve it, its just
that there really is no solution to the equations.  High speed computers
are used to generate closer and closer approximations to the solution.

These computer solutions show that there is no stable orbit for the small
body (the planet).  Any planet in a binary (or higher order) system will
describe a chaotic orbit and will eventually be ejected from the system
altogether (after a few million orbits)

What does all this technobabble mean for traveller players?  It means that
the ~60% of star systems that are of binary or higher order cannot have
planets (including the all-important gas-giant filling-stations) and that the
universe is therefore much more difficult to get around in.

Can any real astronomer confirm or deny the above?

I hope you were taking notes, because there will now be a short test.....
:-)

These emulators would only work when you\'re talking about software. 
Yes, you could have some type of physical converters, but why would
someone mass produce this sort of item.  Software emulators are
available, but creating software doesn\'t require a lot of capital
investment.  Let\'s face it, you don\'t wake up one day and think, "Gee I\'d

Most programmers already have the capital investment they need, and
once they invest the initial time, the product can be sold multiple times
with negligible expense.  A power coupling or data transfer cable on the
other had requires raw materials and manpower and equipment for each
item produced.  Unless there is a grand market for these items, the return
on investment just wont be large enough for anyone to invest in the
production of them.

Anyone interested in picking up a copy of Mayfair Games "Hammer\'s
Slammers" game for
$4 plus postage, send me mail (directly; don\'t bother clogging the list).

The game is fairly simple, but gives a decent feel for company/battalion
combat in David Drakes Hammer\'s Slammers universe.  Units are
platoons; scenarios range from company to battalion v. battalion.

I have access to a cheap source for a limited time, so act fast or forget
it....

To give you an example the Troyan-astroids (located 60 degrees behind
Jupiter in the Jupiter orbit) is a solution to the Lagrange three-body
eqaution, using the Sun, Jupiter and  the asteroids

There are stable solutions but thaty are rare and rather strange. I quess
it also heavyly depends on the makeup of the system. A very heavy star
circled by a white  dwarf would give a Sun-Jupiter type system.

Subject: Re: Astro-babble.

Actually, I recall reading that planets within 1/3 of the distance between
the binaries (i.e. <2 AU if the separation between the stars is 6 AU)
should have stable orbits.  So the range available is limited, not
eliminated.
Of course, gas giants could still form and cause trouble for more inward
accretions (e.g. Jupiter and our asteroid belt).  So habitable planets in
binary systems are unlikely, but not impossible.

Martyn Fogg wrote a splendid series of papers for the Journal of the 
British Interplanetary Society (available at a good university library  near
you), one of which calculated the probability of Earth-like planets circling
nearby stars (using the results of a Monte-Carlo simulation he\'d written,
descended from ACCRETE).  It\'s an interesting paper, both sobering and
uplifting.

Subject: Milieu 0
Message-ID: <199604200205.TAA13943@mom.hooked.net>

With the impending release of T4, I find myself most excited by Milieu
0.  For me, the prospect of being there when it all starts gives an almost
unlimited potential for adventure.  I am going to explore a few of the
possibilities that have come to mind in the last few weeks.  A copy of
this is being sent to Marc Miller, in hopes that he might be able to find
something for me to do on the production of this book.

MILIEU 0:  The Sylean Federation was good enough for me!

One thing to consider is the birth pains of the new Imperium.  Despite
Cleon\'s PR campaign, many Sylean citizens are opposed to the new
government.  This opposition will range from angry editorials to terrorist
bombings.  An important test of the new order is their reaction to this
dissent; do they tolerate it in the name of an open exchange of ideas, or
crush it beneath the Imperial boot?

Many of the early nobles, drawn from the Sylean Navy and Senate, are
given grants of land in areas they already administered.  For most, life
will continue on with the introduction of a new level of social interaction
added to the mix.  There will be those, however, who find the title an
invitation to tyranny.  Some nobles will begin amassing personal
fortunes, start a little "empire-building" of their own, or just engage in the
type of anti-social behavior that has been expected of the nobility
throughout history.

THE SCOUT SERVICE:  The Brave, The Resourceful, The Short Lived

The transformation of the Sylean Survey Office into the Imperial
Interstellar Scout Service is likely to be traumatic.  For centuries, the
Survey had only been called upon to keep the maps up-to-date and
monitor local conditions inside the Federation; now, they are tasked with
exploring the whole of the old Imperium!

I must point out that the Scouts have almost no information about the area
beyond Federation borders.  They may have a vague idea where Earth,
Vland, and Hub are, but beyond that, nothing.  Every system is an
unknown.  (I would like to thank Mr. Miller and Imperium Games for making
the decision not to detail the sectors, leaving that job for the
gamemaster.)

Many Scouts in the first few decades of the Imperium would be drawn
from the edge of Federation space.  Offering the chance for adventure -
with the bonus that if you live long enough, you get to keep the ship you
serve on - will attract the numbers of recruits needed for the huge job
ahead.

The opportunities for a Traveller group are obvious:  Seeking out strange
new worlds, boldly going where no man has gone... oops, don\'t want
Paramount mad at us..  :)

DIPLOMACY:  How much for just the planet?

One area of Traveller that I always considered sadly neglected was
diplomacy.  As a long time fan of Keith Laumer\'s "Retief" stories, the
thought of adventures where wits, not firepower, were the solution
intrigues me.

The Third Imperium is going to need diplomats.  As it expands, the
Imperium will contact many cultures that have drifted far from the cultural
legacy left by the Rule of Man.  Since civilization will most likely survive
on the worlds most desirable to the Imperium, skilled negotiators will be in
demand.

I am a Grad Student at Georgia State Univ, and we use interferometry to
observe binary stars. I don\'t know that much about planets in a binary
environment, but I do know there is a conference about Formation of
Planets in Binary System later this summer, so people do believe it is possible.

We do know that stable Three body orbits are possible, there about 600
known Multiple systems, (Systems with 3 or more stars.) Most of these
are triples, but I think they go as high as 6 stars gravitationaly
bound togethor.  But these system form hierachal systems.  For example,
in a triple system, you will have two stars orbiting close togethor,
and a third star far away.  The Third star will see the two inner stars
as one gravitational mass, and it will happily follow a two body orbit.
 (Its not a true two body orbit, it wiggles a bit, in fact people want
to use those wiggles to find planets)
 
What this all means to planets, is that you can have nice stable
planetary orbits, if the second star is far away.  I don\'t know off
hand how far is far away, but Traveller probably puts its binaries too
close togethor.  In my campaigns, I have never worried to much about
this, after all its a sci-fi game and sci-fi games need planets.  

>It means that
>the ~60% of star systems that are of binary or higher order cannot have
>planets 
The binary frequency depends on the age of the star, Young stars tend
to have very high frequency, over 90%, while older stars tend to be
about 1/3 binary.

Laminate the hull of the ship with superconductor.  That\'ll spread 
the heat quite nicely.  And, if you make it double-walled (one 
coating inside and one out), you effectively double the amount of 
time it will take for your superconductor to heat to a noticeable 
temp.  Also, this would be a good protection against massive amounts 
of radiated energy -- like lasers.  The attacker would have to dump 
_alot_ of energy into your superconductor to burn the stuff away. 

As always, only supposition.  Nobody\'s actually done anything like 
this yet.

and related that to neutrino emmision as well.  This means that a Tigress
(remember them?) running only life support (or possibly less) would barely
register as a neutrino source.  In practical terms if your ship limits its
power consumption, and generation, then the "stealth" world awaits. Very
similar to the noise problems in submarines, with similar solutions, and
LOTSA tension for the players.

Best guess so far is about two weeks after the US launch (expect to see it 
by the end of August - assuming it makes it\'s launch date at US GenCon).

>  Is there going to be any official presence at Euro Gen Con by those 
involved in T4?

Official presence in terms of Imperium Games I don\'t know about, but BITS 
[British Isles Traveller Support] will be running rolling demo games, and 
there will almost certainly be a tournament too.

Also, Valkyrie magazine will be running a Traveller issue which should be 
published just in time for Euro GenCon (printers permitting). It will 
contain an absolutely cracking scenario, two or three articles and some 
other Traveller-related stuff (including a review if I can get Ken to send 
me something to review).

   That would be mine.  I still have the responses (around 90 of them)
sitting on my desk, waiting to be recounted and turned into data.  The
final results should be ready before June 6th.

   Preliminary findings:

   The split between CT/MT and TNE players was about 60-40 in favor
of TNE.  Many of you have modified (to varying degrees) the rules set,
regardless of what basis you use for game mechanics.

   The most popular setting by far is the Spinward Marches, with the
Solomani Rim finishing a distant second.  So many people use the
Spinward Marches (CTers, MTers, TNEers) I\'m surprised that GDW even
considered releasing the Reformation Coalition material first when they
developed TNE.  Without question (IMHO) TNE was not an attempt to
``appease current players`` as at least one person has suggested, but it
was an attempt to bring in new players to the game (an attempt  that
was not as successful as perhaps it should have been).

   The most surprising result was the answer to the question regarding
whether or not people were considering the purchase of the new
Traveller.  My theory going into this exercise is that there would be a
small group of people who had been around Traveller for a while, who
were still die hard fans of the game, but had had enough, and while
they still planned on playing some version of it, it would be T4.  If that
group does exist, they didn\'t respond to my survey.  The overwhelming
majority of you plan on buying at least some of the new IG\'s Traveller
products, and many of you plan on buying all of them sight unseen.
While there was a significant percentage of you that still want to see
more before you will consider a purchase, *no one* ruled it completely
out.

   As for the date the respondents said they started playing Traveller,
most of you said that you started playing in the early 80s (for some
reason the year 1982 was very popular--what was released that year
Traveller-wise?).  Significant was the drop off of new players after
1985-86.  Apparently MegaTraveller brought very few new players into
the game.  It appears that were more people that took up Traveller during
the TNE era than the MT era, but the number were not particularly large.

   Prelimary conclusion: MegaTraveller did more to kill GDW, than TNE
(though I\'m sure at least one of you will say that while MT put the
company on life support, TNE pulled the plug); and Traveller fans are
probably the most loyal in the gaming industry--or perhaps the most
stubborn. <g>

   More later.

Regards,

Harold

Dave Nilsen said that he came to the conclusion that GDW was screwed when they 
issued the Regency sourcebook, for which everyone had been clamoring, but the 
distributors didn\'t pick it up in any significant quantities.  [My guess is 
the distributors had all their ready cash sunk into CCGs.]  After the TSR 
debacle, GDW just didn\'t have the reserves to continue.

I can\'t comment about other people, but TNE was what got me interested in 
Traveller.  I found both CT and MT uninspiring (although I liked 2300 a lot). 
Then, towards the end of MT, I began finding things I liked (the Rebellion 
Sourcebook, Starship Operators Manual, Survival Margin, the reissue of 
Imperium).  The more I read about TNE, the more excited I became.  [Incidently 
I claim to be the first person in the world to buy a copy of TNE -- I handed 
the money to Dave Nilsen while standing in the GDW warehouse the morning it 
shipped.  The distributors didn\'t have it yet.] After buying TNE, I began 
going back and purchasing all the CT and MT stuff, and now I have about 80% of 
the MT stuff and 70% of the CT stuff, including all of the boardgames.

For the record, though, I\'m not much of an RPG player (although I\'m certainly 
a buyer).  I\'m an SF and history buff, so RPGs often make good reading for me.  
Most of my gaming is historical and SF boardgaming, although I also play SF 
and naval miniatures.  My three favorite games of all time are probably Space 
Hulk, Triplanetary, and Imperium -- the last two being "proto-Traveller" games 
put out by GDW.

Joesph is correct (though I\'m not completely sure about the 1/3 figure.) 
There\'s a similar set of stable orbits far away from the stars if the two
stars are very close together.

The mean separation for binary star systems is around 40 AU, which means
orbits in the habitable zone of either star are stable.  The distribution of
separations is very flat, though, with lots of binaries that are within a 
few AU and lots that are separated by a thousand AU.

There\'s some evidence that the distribution of orbits and/or frequency of 
binaries changes with age (young stars seem to have an excess of close
companions). The overall effects of this on planet formation are pretty
poorly understood (we don\'t even understand where all the binaries come from,
let alone planets...) Traveller is probably as good a guess as any. It\'s worth
noting that the extrasolar jovian planets recently discovered by Marcy et al 
were much closer to their stars than anyone expected them to be - planet
formation is a really fuzzy subject right now.

Sorry if I\'m babbling - binary star systems and brown dwarfs were my
thesis topic.

Solomani Sydney class Heavy Cruiser
      The Sydney class heavy cruiser is a modificaiton of the Scharhorst heavy
Cruiser design.  The Sydney replaces the Scharorst massive PAW with a meson gun
, and improves the ships Meson screens.   The Sydney class does not have the
 fuel shuttle or the fuel purificaiton plant that the Scharhorst has.  This was
 done in order to improve the Sydney\'s meson gun and Meson screen.  Althought d
ependent on tankers, and with it limited jump capability, the Sydeny class crui
ser can make its presents felt in any fleet action.
     The first of the Sydeny class cruiser was seen in a small boarder clashbet
ween the Solomaniand an Aslan Fleet.  Since that time Sydney class cruiser have
 begun to appear in small numbers throughtout solomani space.  There have uncon
firmed report that one of the ship yards producting the Sydeny has retooled.
Intelligence sources have speculated that this may mean the Sydney class main
gun may be soon upgraded to TL-15 standards.

I probably have a top 5 list of q\'s for Marc, but I\'m hoping that
others will ask most of the "Whither Traveller"-type ones.

My question is:
"What are the differences in circumstances that have caused you to
return to producing Traveller now as opposed to when you left GDW
a few years ago?"

If you think this is meant to be a sneaky way of asking, "what 
happened back then" and "why now", you would be correct.

Actually, I got a short response from Marc Miller to my essay.  (My wife
claims that I looked like "I had gone to see a department store Santa, and
he told me to take all the toys".

In his all-to-brief note; he suggested another effect that brought about the
Third Imperium\'s rapid ascendancy: the development of tech 12.. I\'m mulling
that one over.  Any gearheads want to break down the advantages of TL12 over
TL11?  He mentioned something about improved power sources...

Very true.  My email to various members of the design team have all been
answered politely, but briefly.  Let them work, I say.

<Deleted> 

   As for the date the respondents said they started playing Traveller,
most of you said that you started playing in the early 80s (for some
reason the year 1982 was very popular--what was released that year
Traveller-wise?).  

Harold
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I came on board in \'82 & the reason for me was that SPI went bankrupt early
that year. I had been a heavy customer of theirs for almost a decade & it was 
their \'Universe\' sci-fi rpg that actually got me into the genre. Casting about 
for a replacement, I came upon CT, remembered GDW as a good solid wargame com-
pany (I already had purchased \'Imperium\' years earlier, along with some other
of their products) & decided to go with them.

BITS (British Isles Traveller Support) will be supporting Imperium Games by
launching the new version of Traveller at Euro Gen Con at 
Loughborough (September 5th-8th). We will be providing participation and 
demonstration games throughout the event, in addition to running 
THE TRAVELLER TOURNAMENT on the Saturday.

Exact details (scenarios, etc.) are still under discussion with Ken Whitman,
but we\'re hoping that we\'ll have pretty much the same setup advertised for
the US Gen Con on the Imperium Games web pages (http://www.ImperiumGames.com/)

If you want 4 days of solid Traveller, get yourself to EGC!

BITS is also intending to release several supplements at EGC, including a
sector-spanning adventure and an extensive bibliography of just about every
Traveller product ever released.

When I last talked to Ken he said it was unlikely any of the team could make
it to EGC. Not too surprising given the pretty tight schedules they have set
themselves for releases after August!

REVIEWS OF THE NEW TRAVELLER
- ----

Alpha or beta copies of the rules may be available in the near future but
I\'m not quite certain how widely these will be distributed. Needless to say,
if a review of some sort is possible (i.e. it can be agreed with Ken, Marc,
etc.) then I will post one.

I can tell you that the task system has changed. Very briefly, it has drawn
together parts of MT and TNE but using an innovative dicing technique.

Here\'s my question for Marc Miller.  It\'s kind of a two parter.

Recognizing that Traveller is first and foremost a pencil, paper and 
dice game, it perhaps more than most other RPG\'s makes heavy demands on 
referees of a bookkeeping nature.  Is there any plan afoot, for 
either Imperium Games or a third party licensee to make software 
supporting the game, such as a ship/vehicle building system, world 
generation in the vein of World Builders Handbook, cargo system 
or anything else?  Will IG be defining standard data formats for others 
to use in designing such software?

possible replacements for the acronyms we\'ve been using for the new
Traveller.  Some people don\'t like NT because it reminds them too much of
Microsoft, and others don\'t like T4 because it reminds them of Revenue
Canada :-) (plus it\'s sort of innaccurate).  So, here are some
possibilities.  

MMT:  Mark Miller\'s TRAVELLER.  This is what Imperium Games seems to be 
calling the new version, so maybe this would work.  Or does this seem too 
much like MegaMegaTraveller :-) ?

IGT:  Imperium Games TRAVELLER.  It won\'t be confused with any of the 
present acronyms and hopefully it can also stand for "Incredibly Great 
Traveller" :-).

FFT:  Far Future TRAVELLER.  Possibility of being confused with FF&S?  
(Yes, you\'d have to be a dunderhead, but never underestimate the power of 
human stupidity).

	Despite my flippant tone, I really would like people to consider 
these. I think it would be nice to agree on what to call this phoenix.

Happy Travelling,

  The most surprising result was the answer to the question regarding
whether or not people were considering the purchase of the new
Traveller.  My theory going into this exercise is that there would be a
small group of people who had been around Traveller for a while, who
were still die hard fans of the game, but had had enough, and while
they still planned on playing some version of it, it would be T4.  If that
group does exist, they didn\'t respond to my survey.  The overwhelming
majority of you plan on buying at least some of the new IG\'s Traveller
products, and many of you plan on buying all of them sight unseen.
While there was a significant percentage of you that still want to see
more before you will consider a purchase, *no one* ruled it completely
out.
- ----

	I don\'t see why this result is surprising at all.  So far, almost
everyone I\'ve talked to or emailed with has reacted positively to the
things they\'ve heard about NT/T4.  I personally know at least 5 people who
refused to buy TNE but plan to come back for NT/T4.  Phil MacGregor even
saw a draft of the equipment section and seems to have given it his
hard-gained approval (Not a flame Phil, but you do seem to have, shall we
say, a knack for incicive critique? :-). 
	Everything I\'ve seen indicates that IG is a company that will 
love Traveller as much as its fans (unlike GDW, who seemed reluctant 
about the whole thing).  And I am absolutely impressed by the team 
they\'ve assembled and most (though not all, of course) of the ideas they 
have put forth.  I would say this is a common opinion among the Traveller 
devotees I know.
	I would say that I\'ve only seen a minority of TNE blowhards 
(diehards! I meant diehards! :-) who absolutely refuse to go back to the 
so-called "70\'s era rules" (whatever that means).  And even long-time 
TNE\'ers are considering the NT/T4 project. 

Okay, I time to don the asbestos underwear...

I agree with you about being excited about the IG team.  They\'ve
really jumped on this one.  I get really good vibes from them.  I\'m
sure that T4 will be fantastic.

As for being a blowhard...  I don\'t think that most people are worried
about the mechanics.  The MT task system will forever remain as one of
my favorite ones, so going to one more MT-like is a "good thing" (tm).
I think what most the the TNE people are upset about is the lack of
something like FF&S.  It\'s hard to have the world in your hands and

I genuinely wonder how many people actually use FF&S.  Not own it, 
but actively use it.  I don\'t mind bookkeeping, but I took 1 look at FF&S, 
and thought, "Gee, with my spare time, it\'d take me about 2 weeks to generate 
a ship..."  Not to mention having to design turrets and ammunition for the thing...  

Sorry, but IMNSHO, science fiction is high adventure, contacts with 
aliens, alien artifacts, starship battles...alien worlds and 
cultures, not a geeky discussion over HEPlaR vs. Thrusters, neither of which 
exist, and most likely won\'t exist in our lifetimes...

True, somebody could design stuff with an FF&S Lite, but then you 
might as well go ahead and use a different, less comprehensive design 
system...

Accordingly, I think it\'d be worthwhile to take a poll  (OH, GOD, NOT 
ANOTHER ONE...)  :-)

The What Design System Are You Using Poll:
1. Are you currently playing Traveller using Traveller: The New Era 
rules, regardless of setting?

2.  Do you own a copy of FF&S (Fire, Fusion & Steel)?

3. Have you ever used FF&S to design a starship, weapon, vehicle or 
other items?

4. Have you ever used the posted FF&S Lite rules to design items?

5.  Do you own the Megatraveller Rules?

6. Have you ever designed a starship, vehicle, or small craft with 
the MegaTraveller rules?

7. Do you own a version of the Classic Traveller rules (Traveller 
Book, Little black books, Deluxe Traveller, Starter Traveller)?

8.  Do you have Book 5, High Guard?

9.  Do you have Striker?

10.  Have you ever designed ships using Book 2, Starships?

11.  Have you ever designed ships using Book 5, High Guard?

12. Have you ever designed vehicles or other items using Striker?

13. If you have experience with more than 1 system, please state your 
preference for designing starships: (Book 2, Starships, Book 5, High 
Guard, MegaTraveller, FF&S)

14. If you have experience with more than 1 system, please state your 
preference for designing vehicles (Striker, MegaTraveller, FF&S)

I am taking you up on your offer (forwarding one question per person to
Marc Miller).  My question is actually two questions in one, but both
parts involve the same subject, namely, the acquisition of skills and
levels (primarily during character generation).  

- ----
Mr. Miller, 

I have been a fan of Traveller since 1979.  Traveller is one of my two
favorite RPG\'s.  I am very interested in seeing Traveller continue in the
gaming community and market.  I have the following questions regarding the
new version you intend to publish this August: 

1) Will characters in academic / non-military careers be *as* *skilled*
(total # of skills/levels; max skill level; etc.; not necessarily the
same specific *skills*) as military / non-academic (i.e., *traditional*
adventuring) careers?  If not, *why* not?  I would suggest that a
"veteran" of 20+ years in academia be *as* *proficient* in academic
circles as a 20-year military veteran would be in military matters.  

2) Will characters be able to get "hobby" skills and/or default skills
easily during character generation?  In "Real Life (tm)"  :-)   I\'d say
that I picked up as many "skills and levels" (if you will) from my hobbies
and pasttimes as from my training and work experience during my 12 years in
the Air Force.  Consider the following example: 

	*SET GEEK-MODE = ON
	*INSERT CHARACTER-WRITEUP = MYSELF

	UPP: 5669A7
	ex-Air Force; 3 terms (age 31); final rank: SSgt (E-5)
	Skills: Computer-3, Gaming-3, Mathematics-3, Cooking-2, History-2,
Admin-1, Disguise-1, Ground Vehicle (Wheeled)-1, Handgun-1, Instruction-1,
Leader-1, Physics-1, Rifle-1, Acting-0, Chemistry-0, Hunting-0, Shotgun-0

	*SET GEEK-MODE = OFF


Thank you.

Mr. Whitman, 

I have a further comment for you.  

Now that IG has a web page, I *strongly* advise you to borrow a strategy
from Steve Jackson Games.  They post material onto their web pages
(appropriately safeguarded with "registered/trademarked materials; copy &
die" warnings :-) *before* sending it to the publishers, so as to allow
their fans to playtest, proofread, spell-check, grammar-check, etc., the
material *at NO COST* to SJGames!  

*PLEASE* look at the old errata sheets (*plural*!) for Mega-Traveller. 
Look at the errata sheets for TNE and FFS.  Then, look at what happened to
GDW.  I *know* all the fans (OK, just *most* of them :-) here on the lists
would *love* the chance to help you make the best Traveller products
possible.  

Please consider this.  Thank you.  

Franklin W. Cain

        Turrets & ammo are mostly predesigned unless you want something
non-standard; even so it takes me a few days, not weeks. Say 4 to 6 hours.

People must be using it otherwise they wouldn\'t be complaining about
it.  I found it no more cumbersome than any other design system once I
got the hang of it (and yes, all design systems take some getting used
to).

I\'d say the same thing, but then why do people complain so much about
how accurate is the system generation rules?  Why do the combat rules
work the way they do?  What about character generation?  The fact of
the matter is that rules make a game and the people playing that game
make it an adventure.  It\'s all the same argument, people just tend to
not care about something unless it\'s what they\'re interested in.

: True, somebody could design stuff with an FF&S Lite, but then you 
: might as well go ahead and use a different, less comprehensive design 
: system...

FF&S Lite is an idea to make FF&S feel more like the old design
sequences.

I think that FF&S is greatly stigmatized because instead of being in
the form of basic and then advanced, it was just advanced.  My best
friend said it looked like an old calculas textbook to him (but then
again, he used WBH to create a planet of Flea and Mary Lou Retton
clones--he likes to make planets and systems, and I like to make
gadgets and ships).

Then again, for MT, to be able to create anything that I could with
FF&S, I had to own the Referee\'s Manual, COACC, Hard Times, and a buch
of issues of Challenge which had low-tech design systems in them.  And
BTRC\'s 3G^3 for weapon design.  I think I preferred the convenience of
having them all in one place with FF&S.  Ask William Hostman about the
package I sent him.

Why should I have to create?  Why shouldn\'t I?  I like to be able to
create items that are consistent to game universe.  With no guidelines
this can\'t really happen.  After all, my def of TL15 and yours could
be radically different.

As an aside, I remember back in 1988 people bitching and moaning that
MT\'s design system clobbered their HG designs.  No longer could you
have a 6G, J4, outta this world agility ship in under 50 tons.  Man,
there were a lot of unhappy people out there.  And many of them got
used to MT and then became unhappy when there was yet another design
system to get used to.

One last rant.  I don\'t see why people argue over the differences in
technology.  Let\'s look at some of the changes over the years.  100
ton limit for starships, HEPlaR vs Thrusters, jump fuel usage.  In CT,
I don\'t ever remember seeing a 100 ton limit, as far as I know, it was
added in MT.  All of the sudden it\'s an issue to CanonMongers?  Why,
because it doesn\'t fit in with TypoTraveller or because it\'s part of
TNE.  What will we do if T4 has no 100 ton limit.  HEPlaR!  What a
great subject.  I once asked someone why they don\'t just use Thrusters
instead.  There are even design rules for them in FF&S.  I mean we all
know that HEPlaR was just a tool to make space combat more exciting.
And it\'s not like every player follows the rules religiously and
doesn\'t change anything to their liking.  His response basically was
that if he use Thrusters, he wouldn\'t have anything to bitch about
with TNE.  And fuel use.  We do all know that you use all your jump
fuel whether you jump the full capacity of your drive or partial
capacity.  However no one seemed to mind this CHANGE IN CANON.  That\'s
probably due to the fact that many people did away with this
restriction under CT and MT.

Take it easy, and remember I\'m not really defending TNE per se, but
rather pointing out how people always look for something to complain
about.

The definition is given on page 12 of Book 2: Starships.  "...  A ship is any
vessel of 100 tons or more.  A starship is a ship which has jump drives and can
travel on interstellar voyages.  A non-starship is a ship without jump drives.
A small craft is any vessel under 100 tons; all small craft are incapable of
jump."

And I disagree that "rules make a game."  The proper wording might be "a game is
only as good as its REFEREE" (or at least his or her interpretation of those
rules).

   Every retailer I\'ve talked to (about 30 all told) has said that their
reluctance to carry ANY materials with the TRAVELLER name on them stems from
MegaTraveller. Apparently, they had a hard time moving the stuff. Two years
ago, I went into a hobby shop in Grand Rapids and was AMAZED at the MT stuff
they still had on the shelves; Vilani and Vargr, for instance. The stuff was
marked 50% off and they STILL couldn\'t move it. The reason, when I asked,
was "Well, MegaTraveller was so full of mistakes that everybody assumed all
the other stuff would be, too." Now that\'s a spurious assumption, especially
in regard to the stuff that DGP put out, but that seemed to be the prevalent
opinion among all the retailers. Many people makr GDW\'s decline as starting
with MT. So, one could blame the death of GDW on MegaTraveller (among many
other things), and not TNE.
   I\'m hoping that something can be done to de-stigmatize the name
"TRAVELLER" so that the new game doesn\'t suffer too. Maybe the fact that
it\'s not GDW making it will help (although I\'ve already run into one guy who
said "GDW, Imperium Games...they\'re all the same guys anyway". of course,
this guy is a buffoon...)

This is somewhat incorrect.  Playtest drafts of many SJG products are posted
on the Web, but are accessible only to members of the Illuminati Online 
(io.com) online service.  (Though, with telnet accounts available at $10
per month, that isn\'t hard to do).  I shudder to think of making drafts
available for free to everyone in the online universe....

Also, the primary purpose of the online playtest files is NOT for fan-
assisted proofreading, but rather to have as many eyes as possible to
check for agreement of new material with older published matter, unseen
holes or munchkin-bait in prospective rules, alternative perspectives
on, e.g. historical data and representations, etc.

SJG hires competent editors to proofread products.  The fans have little 
or nothing to do with it.  And that\'s what IG ought to do as well.

(Proviso here: I don\'t work for SJG, except as occasional convention
booth-staff and correspondent on rules issues, product aims, etc.)

I _would_ agree, though, that IG should post "teasers" -- excerpts from 
upcoming products -- on their Web page, as well as, perhaps, making
available unpublished material like tournament adventures.

	Ooh.  Even I, a Classic Traveller enthusiast, like this!  I like 
it a lot.  It sounds much better to say, "I\'m an expert computer 
programmer," than, "I have 5 skill levels of computer programming."  This 
one I\'m definitely going to save.

	Even though I loathe the arcane design sequences of FF&S, I prefer
	its approach.  The sections explaining the rationale of the technology
	are excellent ambiance.  However, please include MORE prefab-flimsy-
	throw-away-junk components that would be manufactured by every
	wannabe industrial world...  Standard ammunition, communicators,
	fusion plants, etc.  Complete with manufacturers\' names, address, and
	SKU numbers...  ;-)

	I find it difficult to stomach the "hand-crafting" per se of each little part
	of a one-shot ship, toy, cybernetic implant, etc...  By this time in history, 
	especially with the Vilani legacy, EVERYTHING would more or less be 
	standardized to help facilitate the repair and maintenance of starships 
	gazillions of parsecs from their homeport...  [The argument in favor of 
	choosing 9mmP weapons, I believe, for survivalists...  But I digress...]
	They are nice for RC campaigns in which lives can hinge upon such
	"hand-crafted" parts.  [They only thought I was an evil referee, until I
	handed them FF&S, and said, "Thou shalt design, or asphyxiate painfully
	upon vacuum..."  -ed.]

	FF&S, see above.  I still PREFER a bunch of spiffy equipment guides,
	though.  BUT PLEASE make sure that they all jive with the nice little
	design sequences...  ;-(
 
> "Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent" -Isaac Asimov, from "Foundation"

	Hey!?  !@#$ you, too, Isaac.  I resemble that remark!  ;-)


All in all, I think a FF&S Lite would be excellent food for the gearheads, but
supplying the mathematically-challenged amongst us with lots of standardized
parts and explanatory fluff would be the best of both worlds...

Not having GDW\'s name on it will be a big help, IMHO...

I like FF&S\'s detail but MT was a lot easier to use. The reason I haven\'t
made starships with FF&S yet is because I still haven\'t played with all the
numbers yet. (I didn\'t even find out about TNE until late last year)

>14. If you have experience with more than 1 system, please state your

Same comments as above.

Okay, so FFS was broken... I liked the added level of realism.
Unfortunately, it was neither real enough nor "space-opera" enough. It still
lacked pricing for common starship/vehicle items and it could have saved
tons of debate by providing a rationalization for thruster plates rather
than ditching them in the face of  years and years of support. Either
Traveller clings to the past or discards it entirely, you can\'t have it both
ways. Nobody plays Traveller the same way. The only thing that has been
consistent in all my years of role-playing has been those ugly little
doorstops called Scout/Couriers....<G>

    'body' => 'The What Design System Are You Using Poll:
1. Are you currently playing Traveller using Traveller: The New Era 
rules, regardless of setting?
Yes, with some modifications

2.  Do you own a copy of FF&S (Fire, Fusion & Steel)?
Yes.  The most impressive game supplement (of any game) I\'ve seen since 1990 
(my pre-1990 vote would be ICE\'s hardback Minas Tirith sourcebook).

3. Have you ever used FF&S to design a starship, weapon, vehicle or 
other items?
Yes, quite regularly.  Between my own stuff and the TML data, I have a pretty 
extensive collection of vehicles, ships, weapons and other implements of FF&S 
mayhem.

4. Have you ever used the posted FF&S Lite rules to design items?
No - I must have missed those.  Are they available at one of the Web Sites?

5.  Do you own the Megatraveller Rules?
Yes (unfortunately)

6. Have you ever designed a starship, vehicle, or small craft with 
the MegaTraveller rules?
Yes; quite possibly the worst gaming experience I ever had.  I immediately went 
back to High Guard.  The vehiocles were no as bad, but still left much to be 
desired.  And Lord, the poorly-written design rules still give me the willies.

7. Do you own a version of the Classic Traveller rules (Traveller 
Book, Little black books, Deluxe Traveller, Starter Traveller)?
Yes (several copies, ranging from totally shredded to pristine)

8.  Do you have Book 5, High Guard?
Yes (same comment as above)

9.  Do you have Striker?
Yes (also the same comment - I see a trend there)

10.  Have you ever designed ships using Book 2, Starships?
Yes (Boring and cookie-cutter)

11.  Have you ever designed ships using Book 5, High Guard?
Yes (a vast improvement over book two)

12. Have you ever designed vehicles or other items using Striker?
Yes (Hey, I\'ve even PLAYED Striker as a Wargame)

13. If you have experience with more than 1 system, please state your 
preference for designing starships: (Book 2, Starships, Book 5, High 
Guard, MegaTraveller, FF&S)
Overall, I would say High Guard, but it is a very close race between High Guard 
and FF&S.  If I was rating by simplicty, I would say High Guard most 
definitely.  If I was rating based solely on realism and gameplay value, I 
would vote overwhelmingly for Fire, Fusion and Steel.  I will say that if I had 
no computer, I would never have used FF&S.

14. If you have experience with more than 1 system, please state your 
preference for designing vehicles (Striker, MegaTraveller, FF&S)
Fire, Fusion and Steel (Striker was a good ruuner-up, but needed more 
flexibility in terms of what things you could design (rather than pick off a 
list) to put on your vehicles.

No.

Yes, in the good old days--when it first came out.

Yes, all of the above, several copies of each.

8.  Do you have Book 5, High Guard?

Yes, both the first and second editions of this supplement.

9.  Do you have Striker?

Yes, two copies of book edition (first) and four copies of Striker II.

10.  Have you ever designed ships using Book 2, Starships?

Yes, many, including a erzatz version of the Millenium Falcon (renamed the
Millenium Pigeon)!

11.  Have you ever designed ships using Book 5, High Guard?

Many.

12. Have you ever designed vehicles or other items using Striker?

One or two. Note that all this design with Book 2, Book 5 and Striker Mk I
took place between 1977 (when I first started playing/running Traveller) and
when MegaTraveller came out (which is about when I stopped playing/running
Traveller).

13. If you have experience with more than 1 system, please state your 
preference for designing starships: (Book 2, Starships, Book 5, High 
Guard, MegaTraveller, FF&S)

Note that I am not a real "gearhead". For the level of detail that I desired,
and the level of detail that my players desired, Book 2 worked great for
small ships. Book 5 worked great for larger ships (and in a related
sense--Book 2 worked great for small actions and Book 5 worked great for
fleet actions).

I did not do much more than a few designs with MegaTrav, and can\'t remember
how that worked out.

I never did intend on using FF&S/TNE when I started getting re-involved in
Traveller until I had a good chance to look at it. My plan was to start
running a "classic" campaign and work my way up to the TNE setting...

14. If you have experience with more than 1 system, please state your 
preference for designing vehicles (Striker, MegaTraveller, FF&S)

Probably Striker Mk I, but I\'d like to find the extensive article that
appeared in Steve Jackson\'s SPACE GAMER way back then. As I recall, that
helped in the design process.

Basically, I have felt for a long time that the limit on total skills was a
bit too low under CT, and noticably low under MT. TNE was easily abused by
players, as it lacked an upper limit to skills, and an upper limit to any
given skill. (MT placed that at lvel 8 by the task DM limit).

   Every retailer I\'ve talked to (about 30 all told) has said that their
reluctance to carry ANY materials with the TRAVELLER name on them stems from
MegaTraveller. Apparently, they had a hard time moving the stuff. Two years
.................
with MT. So, one could blame the death of GDW on MegaTraveller (among many
other things), and not TNE.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sounds to me as if GDW killed Traveller.

Considering the attitude they had towards it & towards the fans on these
lists, I dont think that\'s much of a surprise at all.

FF&S probably was overcomplex and needed more ready designed components, but it
could do whatever you wanted and fixed the problems in the Striker and MT design
systems. What we need is an FF&S second edition, not Book 5 Mk 2. But my real
complaint over T4 is still the lack of TNE milieu support.

Updates on how the product is coming would be nice.  The automatic reaction
when I say "GenCon release" is for the person to respond "nice Christmas
present".  Are things on a schedule that y\'all are happy with?

Hints about what is going to be in T4 would help us get ready for the
transistion.  For example, since your forte is stsrships, are we going to be
using vector/thrust (TNE) or thrusters (CT/MT)?  Little things like that
will keep us going until the rules fall into our hands.

I remember Imperium Games announcing a mailing list.  I subscribed, but as
of yet haven\'t recieved a thing from them.

One thought just came to me.  A semi-regular IRC wouldn\'t hurt..

1. Are you currently playing Traveller using Traveller: The New Era

I am running a Megatraveller Game solely for the Character Generation, but I
have  stomach cramps when I realise the shortcomings of the basic game rules
from MT to TNE

2.  Do you own a copy of FF&S (Fire, Fusion & Steel)?
Yes, three actually (First edition, Mod1, and One from Deluxe)

3. Have you ever used FF&S to design a starship, weapon, vehicle or

Yes for all, mostly weapons.

Nope

Yep

6. Have you ever designed a starship, vehicle, or small craft with

Sure, tons of them

7. Do you own a version of the Classic Traveller rules (Traveller

All of them

8.  Do you have Book 5, High Guard?
Yep

9.  Do you have Striker?
Both

10.  Have you ever designed ships using Book 2, Starships?
Sure, about 25-30 then I went to High Guard

11.  Have you ever designed ships using Book 5, High Guard?
Sure, about 100 types

12. Have you ever designed vehicles or other items using Striker?
Sure easily 25-35 vehicles (maybe more liek 50-60)

13. If you have experience with more than 1 system, please state your 
preference for designing starships: (Book 2, Starships, Book 5, High 
Guard, MegaTraveller, FF&S)
Book 5 or MT is probably the best as the deign was simplest, althout I think
FF&S is the best.  It is a bit too time consuming and suffered from a
plethora of errors. (to whit the range for Mass Drivers)

14. If you have experience with more than 1 system, please state your 
preference for designing vehicles (Striker, MegaTraveller, FF&S)
I always likes Striker the best, but MT was basically the same.  FF&S was
good but suffered from a lack of tons of ready built drop in components.

This is an interesting poll.  I have responded to the main list for this
reason.  I really like FF&S it is in my opinion the one thing that set
Traveller apart from the rest of RPGs.  It had its failing, mostly from
overambition.  What was needed was a complement of equipment designs that
could be dropped into other designs.  The prior systems (HG, MT, Striker)
had this to a large degree, and the design sequences were thought out.  I
will miss the ability to design my own Plasma Grenade Launchers, or Mass
Driver ACV, or the Grav Bike.  FF&S was the logical next step from the MT
and HG design rules, but GDW shot itself in the foot by totally revamping
the entire Science basis for most of the universe.

I have designed most likely hundreds of ship/vehicles/weapons in systems
from Book 2 to HG to Striker to MT to FF&S.  FF&S was by far the most
involved, time consuming, and tedious, but it was also the most rewarding.
I still have fond memories of sitting in Algebra II class in 1983 merrily
ignoring the teacher and designing HG ship after HG ship to populate my
universe.  FF&S gave me the opportunity to fill in the cracks in the weapons
area.  I was frankly tired of just the 20 or so standard weapons available.
I wanted the ability to use more.  Thus is born the Plasma Grenade Launcher,
the Guild SMG w/ 30mm Greander launcher, the Hold-Out laser, etc.  These
weapons fill a niche, sure the GM could just say that they exist, but then
there would be arguments on effectiveness or weight, or what if an
industrious player wants to create something.

My point after all of this rambling is this.  If we lose the ability to
create vehicles, weapons, armor, or starships, then we lose an incredible
amount of flexibility for Traveller also.  Then we have to rely on Imperium
Games to tell us what exists, and we will have to adhoc the design of
specials for our adventures.  Players will design things the GM will have to
review even closer than currently for design flaws.  I wouldn\'t mind a new
simpler system, although I will miss FF&S, but I will be upset if all we can
do is a quick starship design and a quick vehicle design.

My opinion on it is that after Marc Miller left, Chadwick & co. at 
GDW looked at it as the ugly stepchild...maybe even before...

Somebody else\'s design that he didn\'t really have his heart in.  This 
was obvious by the s***ty editing job on the MegaTraveller books, and 
so on...

 Hey, Isaac was right!  Heinlein explained why:

 Only an incompetent waits to use violence until it\'s his _last_

	Hmmm.  It seems I have been mistaken about tech levels all this 
time!  I thought the level indicated that at which the device or whatever 
is invented/created/produced/whatever.  It appears from what you say 
above that, instead, the tech level refers to the time in which the item 
is common.
	Correct?

	True.  That bothers me somewhat as well.  Hopefully, T4 will 
rectify that...for a few years, anyway. :)

        I like this, and it does sound very much like the Senior. If you

I\'m not currently playing/GMing Traveller, but when I do it\'s going 
to be with the TNE rules... with a healthy dose of redesigned 
background and higher-tech, but that\'s about it.

Sure do.

Mostly starships at the moment... I haven\'t found a need to design 
anything else, though I am looking at vehicles (lift vehicles, 
airships, that sort of thing).

  > 4. Have you ever used the posted FF&S Lite rules to design items? 
  
Hmm... couldn\'t say that I have seen then, though I have sure heard a 
lot about them.

  > 5.  Do you own the Megatraveller Rules? 
  
\'Fraid so.

  > 6. Have you ever designed a starship, vehicle, or small craft with  the

All of the above.

  > 7. Do you own a version of the Classic Traveller rules (Traveller  Book,
  > Little black books, Deluxe Traveller, Starter Traveller)? 
  
No... shame as well, then I would be able to tell what people are 
continually moaning about.

  > 8.  Do you have Book 5, High Guard? 
  
Nope.

  > 9.  Do you have Striker? 
  
Ditto.

  > 10.  Have you ever designed ships using Book 2, Starships? 
  
Can\'t say that I have.

  > 11.  Have you ever designed ships using Book 5, High Guard? 
  
Nope.

  > 12. Have you ever designed vehicles or other items using Striker? 
  
Same again.

Out of the options and the systems that I have used then it would 
have to be FF&S.

  > 14. If you have experience with more than 1 system, please state your 
  > preference for designing vehicles (Striker, MegaTraveller, FF&S) 

Again, this would have to be FF&S from what I have seen of the 
system so far.  Though it can be a complete pain at times to go 
through the book looking for all the stuff that you need - and then 
some when you find out that you have to design *that* piece as well - 
it still beats MT hands down.  Okay, MT had a simple design sequence 
and I could knock out a ship, space station, whatever, in a very 
short period of time.  I can\'t do that with FF&S but I tend to think 
that the ships are more logical and consistent with the physical laws 
that operate within the universe.  Also, FF&S tried to answer to the 
fact that some people just don\'t like some features of the Imperial 
Traveller universe... personally, I don\'t like the idea of artificial 
gravity at the moment so I\'ve got all these nice spinny-things to 
provide the glue to stick you to the floor.

If there is one thing that can be said about the MT system... the 
*lack* of design sequences gave some people a \'free hand\' in 
designing stuff for the universe.  Okay, it might not have been 
completely consistent with all the number crunching that someone had 
done, but it sure made them think "Like, wow!"  FF&S put a stop to 
this (well, with my friends anyway) since they didn\'t want to root 
through the back to make it consistent with the universe.  In 
addition - and I have said this before - it just didn\'t seem to cut 
it when you considered what it was going to do.  "Give you the 
factory of the future," or something like that... kind of makes you 
think that it\'s going to all add up.  However, kind of made me think 
of 1986 with spaceships (he says again ;-)  

If there was going to be anything done about technology in the new 
version, that it sure would be nice to see little articles discussing 
the relative advantages and disadvantages of incorporating a certain 
piece of technology into your universe (assuming that T4/MMT)... 
okay, it won\'t be the Imperial Traveller universe but it would be 
nice if they did this.  For example, what would be the effects of 
nanotechnology upon medicine, computers/communications, robotics, 
engineering, materials technology, etc.  If there are any people who 
are in the "know" and wouldn\'t mind patronising me they could sure 
tell me, or point me in the correct direction, but I would still like 
to see \'official\' or \'semi-official\' articles on these subjects.

Anyway, thanks for listening to me rant and rave.

1. Are you currently playing Traveller using Traveller: The New Era 
rules, regardless of setting?

Yes.  TNE rules, Spinward Marches, post 5th FW.  Thruster Plates in use.

2.  Do you own a copy of FF&S (Fire, Fusion & Steel)?
  Yes.  One of my most favorite game suplements.

3. Have you ever used FF&S to design a starship, weapon, vehicle or 
other items?
  Yup.  I\'ve built numerous firearms, starships, winged aircraft, wheeled
vehicles, and even a zeppelin.

4. Have you ever used the posted FF&S Lite rules to design items?
    Yup.

5.  Do you own the Megatraveller Rules?
Yes.  A very early, very broken copy.  I did have 2.5cm thick errata
printout to go
with it at one time too.

6. Have you ever designed a starship, vehicle, or small craft with 
the MegaTraveller rules?
   Not successfully.  The rules were too broken.

7. Do you own a version of the Classic Traveller rules (Traveller 
Book, Little black books, Deluxe Traveller, Starter Traveller)?
  Yes.

8.  Do you have Book 5, High Guard?
        Yes.

9.  Do you have Striker?
        Yes.

10.  Have you ever designed ships using Book 2, Starships?
   Yes.  Very simple.  I perfer the FF&S rules with FF&S Lite for quick and
dirty.

11.  Have you ever designed ships using Book 5, High Guard?
   Yes.

12. Have you ever designed vehicles or other items using Striker?
    No.

Traveller.  *BUT*, even if they do this, that doesn\'t mean the CCG will do

1) The CCG market is *flooded* with games.  Try convincing a distributor
or retailer to sink money into *yet another* "new CCG" that will sit on
his shelves taking up valuable space and not turning around as fast as
MTG.  If you can\'t get your product to the distributors and retailers,
you\'re out of business.  

2) Illuminati (by Steve Jackson Games) is a classic game of conspiracy
(just as Traveller is a classic RPG of science fiction).  Yet, Illuminati:
New World Order (INWO), their CCG version of Illuminati, isn\'t moving
worth beans, from what I can see.  (Don\'t get me wrong; I love INWO.  It\'s
a damn fine CCG.)  Every time I check my mail, I get another catalog for a
store that sells singles on the CCG after-market, and they\'re selling INWO
at a discount!  Just because Traveller is a good RPG doesn\'t mean that a
Traveller CCG will sell.  

3) I doubt IG has the financial strength, at this time, to adequately
support T4 (the RPG) with regular supplements *and* do a Trav:CCG.  Maybe
in a couple of years, once they get off the ground and running, but not
now.  In that case, I, as a long-time fan of the Traveller line, would
rather see a strong support of T4, and *maybe* a Trav:CCG in a few years.

I think the problem here is that FF&S and the Ship Design Worksheet included
with the Player Forms Supplement work this out in two different ways.  A
Thrust-Megawatt(ThMW) is a Megawatt from the power source devoted to thrust.
According to the Ship Design Worksheet, a ship must have ThMW equal to:

Ironically enough, the more opinions I get, and the more I think 
about it.  A Traveller CCG would probably do more harm than good.

Hands down, FF&S.  The old traveller stuff was OK, but lacked the detail I
wanted.  With FF&S I can generaly produce anything I want or need (within
reason).  Also, I found the book\'s math  to be of the "plug and chug"
variety.  There was nothing really difficult in there, just common sence and
a little bit of time.  

Of course, if you were trying to convert some of the old big ship designs to
TNE, you might see things a little differently.

I\'m currently refereeing Traveller using TNE rules and the Regency setting.

Yes.

 3. Have you ever used FF&S to design a starship, weapon, vehicle or other items?
  
Yes, all of the above.

 4. Have you ever used the posted FF&S Lite rules to design items?
  
No, it\'s an additional complication that I don\'t want to deal with.  I know FF&S by 
itself has glaring inadequacies, but it works for me and my players.  Downloading 
gigabytes of additional rules is only going to make it tougher to do what we like to 
do: PLAY the game.

 5.  Do you own the Megatraveller Rules?
  
Used to.  Sold them after the demise of MT.

 6. Have you ever designed a starship, vehicle, or small craft with the MegaTraveller 
rules?
  
Yes, all of the above.

 7. Do you own a version of the Classic Traveller rules (Traveller  Book, Little black 
books, Deluxe Traveller, Starter Traveller)?
  
Used to.  Sold Books 1-3 also.  I still have and frequently use for reference Books 
4-8, however I use several of the other CT supplements and adventures as well to 
enhance my TNE campaign.

 8.  Do you have Book 5, High Guard?
  
Yes.

 9.  Do you have Striker?
  
No. Once again, used to, but I never played and eventually sold it.

Yes.

Yes.

No.

 13. If you have experience with more than 1 system, please state your preference for 
designing starships: (Book 2, Starships, Book 5, High Guard, MegaTraveller, FF&S)
  
FF&S.  There\'s a bit too much detail, but the _lack_ of detail in the CT and MT 
versions is a problem for me.  I\'m no gearhead, but I like a few gadgets and CT/MT just 
don\'t support them very well.

  14. If you have experience with more than 1 system, please state your preference for 
designing vehicles (Striker, MegaTraveller, FF&S).

MT.  The FF&S design system makes it a genuine pain in the @$$ to design and evaluate 
vehicles, especially of the grav variety.  MT made it simple and I felt, effective.  
Unfortunately, there isn\'t a way to convert MT vehicles to TNE.

	Okay, usually I would be the last person to defend CCGs, but I
wonder if it would not be a good way to bring in some money which would
support the RPG side of things?  That\'s the way I see it:  a sideline to
make some money to support the important stuff :-).  Others have expressed
fears that the CCG would lose money, but I have to wonder how much it
costs to develop a CCG.  Aren\'t they cheap enough to produce that even
modest sales bring returns?  I thought that was the reason for the CCG
craze in the first place: low overhead.  Of course, I\'m speaking from a
position of zero experience here, so feel free to correct me.  It\'s just
that I can\'t see them taking that much time in terms of rules design,
playtesting and so on (though the artwork might take a while). 

What do y\'all think?

 That would be my main personal reason.

 Because the market is already flooded. Lets look at the successful games,
the only ones that survive are the first ones(Magic, and sorta Jyhad) and
StarWars. The rest are marginal at best.
 The main reason is, in addition to taking away from ImperiumGame\'s
limited staff time, it would also, IMO, degrade the traveller universe
serverley. Rember, CCG\'s are not about role playing, they\'re power
mongering.

I think the first guy was talking about full auto fire from a .50 cal

A good point, but should resources be split between an RPG and  CCG?

  world out there, and I went exploring.  I found these neat things
  called "bookstores" and "malls", as well as stopping in at the
  Compleat Strategist on 33d St. in NYC.

  Compleat Strategist _wants_ to carry T4.  They want promo
  material as soon as possible. (Hey, Ken!  Is IG listening?)  They
  _like_ Traveller, even though they give CyberPunk 2020 and GURPS
  and AD&D _each_ about three times the shelf space that Traveller
  has ever had. But then, with GDW not supporting the system,
  they\'d\'ve had to order a 20-year supply of each item to have
  enough stock to match any of the above.  There\'s good and bad to
  it...

  However:  Several comic shops in the malls, and most of the
  bookstores, had at least one shelf for RPG stuff, and most had
  more.  So did the toy stores.  But, y\'know, the only game I saw
  on those shelves was AD&D.  Maybe part of Traveller\'s problem has
  been _exposure_?  Or, more accurately, the lack thereof?

  Maybe IG should try to put Traveller right next to AD&D in Barnes
  and Noble.  Or in Squiggy\'s Cards and Comix.

  Maybe buying a "spot" during Star Trek/ST:TNG/ST:DS9/ST:V and/or
  during Babylon 5 or during SeaQuest:DSV (if it\'s still on) or
  during Sliders (ditto) or... would be a good idea as well.  Maybe
  space in Asimov\'s would also be a good idea.

  Heck, there are companies that think of these things for money,
  and they probably do a better job than I would.  But there
  shouldn\'t be any question of what I\'m trying to get at.  And
  now\'s the time to start - certainly not _after_ the release, and
  not only in the few days before the release.  There are a lot of
  gamers, and a lot of potential gamers out there - and most of
  them would say "Huh?" if you said "Traveller".  Don\'t you think
  that needs to be changed?

Ok, a bit of experience here...
I was a tank crewmember (driver) on M-1 series tanks, and I was deployed
during the gulf war.  I\'ve seen everything from .45 ACP to 125mm rapira-3
tank rounds.  The truth is that the .50 BMG will kill darn near anything on
the battlefield, (except tanks of course :>) ) and 7.62mm eastern block
rifle ammo will cut the armor of an M113 APC to ribbons at 100 meters.  (if
you consider aluminum plates to be armor)  Typicaly the "grunts" use sand
bags (and anything else) to supplement their fighting positions (foxholes).
Two rows of "properly" stacked sandbags is generaly considered to be
"acceptable" protection against schrapnel and other flying nasties.  The .50
BMG is generally too heavy to move quickly and is not always a concern.
BTW, the M-16Ax rifles do not do a particularly good job of piercing armor,
but the accuracy is hard to touch.  

The larger weapons and "guns" found on tanks and APCs are another story.
Most tank guns are designed to defeat heavy armor.  Consequently, 75 to 100
inches of penetration in homogenous steel is not uncommon.  (depending on
the penetrator used).  The "Soviets" and those who use their equipment
typicaly don\'t use sabot ammo, and typicaly don\'t have the standoff range
that we do in the US and most NATO countries.  By comparison, the rapira-3
gun used on the T-64/72/80 tanks typicaly uses HE/frag or HEAT ammo to
defeat armor, where the US prefers to use sabot almost exclusively.  The
soviet equiped gun can be expected to have effective ranges of about 1800
meters, compared to the 3000+ of sabot equiped guns.  

As far as protection is concerned, a flack jacket is only good against
schrapnel and pistols.  The assesment that very little will protect you
against (heavy) machinegun fire is quite correct.  The only thing I\'ve seen
actualy stop a BMG is the hide of an M-1 tank (which I\'ve also seen stop the
rapira-3 ammo described above.)  If you\'re considering the penetration rules
you might want to take this into consideration.  

Its just a thought.

Message-ID: <25EB35F0280@daisy.le.ac.uk>

Okay then, maybe my use of the term "nano-robots" was misplaced.  
However, it was more a case of we can construct *very* small 
machinery, which someone termed "nano-machinery" (or something like 
that).  Whether we have it 20 years or 80 years is not really the 
point - it was more a case of "look at technology now, and look at it 
in Traveller."  Regards to my comments upon Traveller as space-opera 
(which is something that I desperately do not want to see).  However, 
thanks for the reference /Backman, I shall endeavour to have a look 
at it.  Remember, for flame-reference, I\'m only a poor archaeologist 
;-)

A quick question that someone should be able to answer, prompted by 
my current reading of the powered-armour theme... is there no 
possibility of upping the endurance of the suits past the 10 hours 
produced in the various sourcebooks for the RC?  I haven\'t looked at 
the numbers yet, so it\'s a blind question.  Surely with all that 
space kicking around in battle dress - the heavier versions at least 
- - you should be able to put some extra batteries in!?  I saw someone 
us a micro-fusion power plant for Tl-16 "Nemesis" Battle Dress, but 
surely you could just up the endurance by the extra batteries?  

As a point of interest, someone mentioned the cost of the modern 
soldier.  Apparently (can\'t validate it for various reasons) the 
concept of an armoured trooper is not that far off in the future.  
Topics which came up in the same conversation included, essentially, 
arm-mounted mini-guns with gyro-stabilisation, IHADSS (Integrated 
Helmet and Designated Sight System methinks, but don\'t quote me on 
it) for targeting, and that sort of thing.  Powered armour may be a 
bit more in the future, but where does Traveller put it?  12-14?  
What\'s that in our terms... another 150-200 years?  Early decades of 
this century were the estimates I heard given the rapid increase in 
military technology... not saying that I\'m an expert on it, though.

Again, thanks for listening to an arty-person rant about \'science.\'

I would just like to throw in a thought that was raised last year on 
either X-Boat or TML: AFV readiness after touchdown. Someone(sorry, can\'t 
remember who :-) ) devised a series of rules for the breakdown of 
ground/air vehicles while in transit. Think about it, your rotary wing 
assault choppers are hardly going to be sitting in the cargo hold with 
rotors unfolded etc. Same goes for external sensors and antennae on AFVs.

Loren,

Do not take offense at this question, I am seeking an answer from 
someone in the know. 

In the period prior to the release of MegaTraveller, GDW released 
things for CT at a very fast clip, quite often several supplements, 
adventures, & modules a year, in addition to a totally Traveller 
dedicated magazine for a few years (JTAS) and its successor, 
Challenge.  

Other than Challenge, the bulk of MegaTraveller itself was collated and 
rewritten by what was in essence, the staff of DGP.  Prior to Hard 
Times (1991), the following supplements were published for MT.

1988, Rebellion Sourcebook, written by DGP &  GDW staff, with 
contributions by HIWG
1989, COACC, GDW
1990, Fighting Ships of Shattered Imperium, GDW & DGP staff
1990, Knightfall, Joe Fugate, & essentially DGP
1991, with Hard Times, GDW took back a more active role.

Let me know if I missed something.

It would appear that the bulk of the design work on MT (outside of
COACC, and maybe Rebellion Sourcebook) prior to Hard Times, when GDW
essentially took back control of the direction of the game),  was basically handed 
over to DGP.  This process actually began when Marc was still on 
board.

In addition DGP published World Builders Handbook, Starship Operators 
Manual, Flaming Eye, a full magazine (Travellers Digest, then later 
MTJ) as opposed to a few pages in Challenge.  WBH & SSOP were two of 
the best supplements to the MT system, and yet they were written by a 
3rd party company.

Maybe I misspoke myself in saying that GDW treated it as the "ugly 
stepchild", but it would certainly seem that the bulk of the design 
work and publishing for MT, were done by DGP.  What prevented GDW 
from better supporting the game system in those years?

Have the CCG be aimed at planetary/interstellar politics. Including
Clausewitz\'s "diplomacy by other means" (ie war).

It\'d give a nice, semi-abstract way of playing out political
interactions, and thus giving refs a way to take a bunch of generated
worlds and turn them into a bunch of territories, complete with a
"history" of deals, wars, etc.

Heck, handled right it might even work the way some gaming groups used
to do things. They\'d use some "grand strategic" type rules to generate
the conflicts and find out *where* the battles were going to be. Then
they\'d use tactical level rules to fight out the battles. 

As I\'ve noted before, I\'m in favor of having the rules set up such that
you can handle things at any desired level of complexity and get
"equivalent" results. 

So if a CCG would work for the highest level, what the heck.

concept has matured past the original speculation phase, and no one can now
expect to produce a CCG that "ignites" the market like Magic did.

Look at history for an indication of what will happen:

When TSR produced D&D, they found that it sold "like hotcakes." They
naturally expected any game title they produced (ie. Metamorphosis Alpha) to
sell in similar numbers. The new publishers jumping on the bandwagon thought
their new games would be the next D&D. In reality, D&D created a new category
and spurred the publication of many new games. But each sold an appropriate
number instead of an outrageous number.

I think we will see the same in CCGs (or just CGs). CCG imitators of Magic
will sell an appropriate number in the market place, but not an outrageous
number. Speculation will not be a component of most new CCGs; players will
buy them because they want to play them and participate in the fun of
searching out new cards. Good game play value will make CCGs sell, as will
good distribution contacts.

I think a Traveller CG (note: not CG) has some potential as a combat resolver
(whether personal combat, military combat, or starship encounters), and some
day we may do one. But not right now unless we can find the right publisher.

Also, what I would like is your fabulous design and research abilities. I\'d
like a set of statistics, a 100 to 250 word description of the ship, the
name of the first known example of the ship, and the USPs of the following
ships:

Mercenary Cruiser
Laboratory Ship
Safari Ship
Close Escort
Gig
System Defense Boat
Corsair
Military Destroyer
Light Fighter
Medium Fighter
Heavy Fighter
Missile Fighter
Military Carrier

Please use as much of what\'s already out there in your designs. I will
credit you in the work as the "Chief Naval Architect" in the book. Please
email me if you\'re interested, and what ship(s) you\'re interested in doing.
Remember that we\'re doing this in the Year 0 of the Imperium (or within 20
years). If I like your design, I will use it. If you have access to a
program that will produce Illustrator style .eps files, and you want to do
deck layouts, we\'d love to see those, too.

Let me see what you can do!

The What Design System Are You Using Poll:
1. Are you currently playing Traveller using Traveller: The New Era
rules, regardless of setting?
Yes, in a sense. We are using the new task system (it is especially 
favourable to a certain Psi-15 Droyne) but haven\'t used the combat system 
yet. This appears to be reasonably unwieldy, at first perusal. BTW, we 
have NEVER been happy with Traveller combat. Admittedly I am from an AD&D 
background, but I do believe that the PC\'s are supposed to be heroes and 
that this is a game, not real life. I WANT to be able to play "Die Hard" 
- - with so-called realistic rules that movie would have been "Die Quickly".

The best TRav combat rules, for us, are the MT rules. However, the 
uniform armour on vehicles is a simplistic cop-out, making them very 
under-armoured.

2.  Do you own a copy of FF&S (Fire, Fusion & Steel)?
Yes - the first release, plus the errata and high energy weapon fixes 
from _Challenge_.

3. Have you ever used FF&S to design a starship, weapon, 
vehicle or other items?
I have attempted to create an Excel spreadsheet to create starships. 
After working through the confusing rules on hulls and internal 
structure, I got through to the Controls section and the conflicting 
tables of Flight Avionics and Navigation Aids and gave up.

FF&S is a worthy attempt at creating an all-inclusive design sequence. I 
will be most unhappy if it is not re-released (with its pseudo-science 
conforming to Traveller ;-) under T4. However, Basic, Intermediate, and 
Advanced sections should be included, with many pre-designed components 
tyo drop in (a la HG) but the ability to design those bits yourself if 
you want to tweak the system. ie. FF&S Lite _plus_ FF&S Gearhead.

4. Have you ever used the posted FF&S Lite rules to design items?
I thought this was only a discussion idea - or is this what I missed in 
Mar-April?

5.  Do you own the Megatraveller Rules?
Yes

6. Have you ever designed a starship, vehicle, or small craft with
the MegaTraveller rules?
Yes, yes, yes. I created an Amiga spreadsheet for MT. Apart from the pain 
of the recursive pp calcs, it works great. Did you know that the best 
defensive DM is comp-9 + size-2 + agility-6 = 17? ...and that the lowest 
emission level is Nil? (I built a stealth ship for my players - actually, 
they stole it from the Ine Givar - and a stealth Resolve-class G-Carrier 
called the Unresolved-class).

7. Do you own a version of the Classic Traveller rules (Traveller
Book, Little black books, Deluxe Traveller, Starter Traveller)?
Books 1-8, Starter Trav.

8.  Do you have Book 5, High Guard?
Yes.

9.  Do you have Striker?
Yes.

10.  Have you ever designed ships using Book 2, Starships?
No. They looked too simple - I went straight to HG.

11.  Have you ever designed ships using Book 5, High Guard?
Yes, many. I even perfected an Amiga spreadsheet for HG.

12. Have you ever designed vehicles or other items using Striker?
Yes. I built a grav version of the Vector W2 Twin-Turbo, and even 
translated it to Striker. Also built about5-10 other vehicles, many of 
them civilian. APM created a battle tank (50t?) that mounted a 
ship\'s fusion gun - the most awesome weapon short of a tank m-gun.

13. If you have experience with more than 1 system, please state your
preference for designing starships: (Book 2, Starships, Book 5, High
Guard, MegaTraveller, FF&S)
MT, for its plug-in equipment and stealth capabilities, plus its higher 
level of detail than HG. However, if FF&S was easier to use and 
compatable with the earlier versions of Trav, I would probably prefer to 
use it. I like to tinker with items to give the players a unique "gimmick".

14. If you have experience with more than 1 system, please state your
preference for designing vehicles (Striker, MegaTraveller, FF&S)
MT is really just Striker without the different armour facings and 
battlefield meson accelerator. Add these in, and using my spreadsheet, I 
prefer MT (ie. I prefer a structured Striker - which FF&S should have been).

>From David C. Broussard (broussa@connecti.com):
>What was needed was a complement of equipment designs that
>could be dropped into other designs...

Yes! This IS the concept that this list dubbed FF&S Lite.

>FF&S was the logical next step from the MT and HG design rules, but GDW
shot
>itself in the foot by totally revamping the entire Science basis for most
of

Agreed wholeheartedly. Again, as per MT, no conversion rules/backwards 
compatability. As this list often noted, if you designed things from 
scratch under FF&S, the standard ships would *never* have been built.

PLEASE bring out FF&S Lite + Advanced (and backwards-compatable). I\'d 
like to see that.

Note where the CT/High Guard results landed: 6 out of 57? And the recent
thread about design sequences seems to be showing similar results. 

Not that people object to a simplified design system ... FF&S Light was the
most popular idea. But they want it to be CONSISTENT! which a CG/HG mix is
definitely not, and they want it FLEXIBLE, which CG/HG lacks, and they want
it EXTENSIBLE to GREATER DETAIL, which CT/HG does not provide.

I\'m going to continue to follow this list, and support Traveller via my Web
Page, but right now I\'m not even going to think about wasting my money on a
retrograde rule set. If I wanted to play CT or HG, I could already. But I
don\'t and I haven\'t for years.

Just my opinion. Considered comments to the list or to me, flames to
gatekeeper@hell.org.

  For the most bang-for-da-buck, I would suggest B5.  For one thing,
it\'s a better SF show than DS9 or ST:Lost in Space.  
  It has more of a Traveller feel, for me at least, as well.

  As I had to explain to one kid in a SR game, "It\'s not a \'bullet-proof\'
suit, merely \'bullet-resistant\'."  The twit didn\'t get it and ran out where
da bad guys, in set positions with .30 cal ARs, proceeded to shoot him full
of very many holes.

  You can get a vest that will stop a 7.62 NATO round, but the metal plates
weigh lot and is rather cumbersome.  Translate this to game terms, do your
characters want to be well protected, or slowed down enough to be easier
targets for head shots? :-) 
  You probably are safer in the tank, since you once you armor the legs,
head, etc. as well, the local police will ask why you are wearing combat
armor in the local mall...but then they would also ask questions about the
tank. :-)

Even better, try the RPG Albedo, based on the _Erma Felna_ comic.  The 
Interstellar Lupine Republic is a racist splinter government, based on the 
premise that rabbits are the superior lifeform.  They are locked in a cold 
(but getting warmer) war with the Confederation government, a collection of 
several species.  All the species are genengineered from Terran animals, for 
reasons unknown to the characters.

This RPG actually has a very hard science background, and is worth purchasing 
just for that.  I even prefer the Albedo jump drive explanation over 
Traveller\'s...

5.56mm, based on the FN Minimi, either belt fed from drums or uses M16 magazines

one or two other NATO nations use it as well. The M60 is retained at platoon

Well, let\'s look...  Twilight: 2000 [end of the world as we know it],
Merc: 2000
[almost the end of the world as we know it], Dark Conspiracy [end of the
world 
as we know it], MegaTraveller, Hard Times, and TNE [end of Traveller as we

know it].  Oops, how could I forget Cadillacs and Dinosaurs? [end of
roleplaying
as we know it].  I\'m sorry, but I see a trend here...  [2300AD was omitted
due to

BTW, The Ithklur "Buddha" wore a Santa Klaus hat, for pity\'s sake!!! 
*scream*

I remember speculating to a friend way back when DC came out, along with a
few nice supplements like DarkTek...  "Who are these guys?  Prophets of
Doom?
Every game they publish seems to be the world gone all to hell..."  BTW, I
miss
DC.  Who owns the rights to it?

An evesdropping game store proprietor noted, "Well, they missed the boat,

something a little more upbeat...  Typical GDW."  [Only the names have

This is in no way to be construed to mean that I am against ending the

the

I noticed a few minor changes from my copy of CT in the computer

One thing: Allow higher types of computers at lowish tech levels but at
a BIG increase in size and price. After all, saying that we can make a hand 
computer with the capacity of univac today is really the same as saying that
they could make a hand computer the size of a room 40 years ago. There would
be a lower limit, of course, but theoretically one could make a type 9
computer with vacuum tube technology - it would just be one BIIIIIG sucker!

Going the other way, make the type 1 computers\' size neglible at TL E and
F and the same for the type 2 and 3 computers at TL F.

My impression was that FFS was a response to the *demand* for more real
science in Traveller. The *real* science that was started in 2300 was
importred into TNE/FFS. Let\'s face it, an RPG without *hard* science
may as well be fantasy. 

The problem is: at what level is it represented in game terms. The
referee is the one that deals with the selection of design elements
from FFS. My players don\'t know the science or the problems with
designing from FFS at all. They also don\'t really care until I tell
them they cannot put that on their ship.

I like FFS. The starship stuff is a bit thick, but I can work around
it. The other equipment design stuff is great. When used in the context
of the combat system, the vehicle/weapon design results are very
consistent.

I also run/play other of GDWs *core* systems. MERC, TW2000, DC, and
even Cadillacs. Some of the designs I came up with went into those
systems as well. 

The starship design sequence needs plug-ins that are consistent with
the rules, (especially space weapons and electronics) but the science
is all there. 

Having been part of a senior design project for a mining mission to
Phobos, I understand the design tradeoffs that are necessary based on
mission. Spacecraft are hard to design.

I think that FFS goes a long way to easing that difficulty. I for one
would like to see plug-ins for FFS rather than a return to the CT/MT.

Sorry for the length, but there\'s my 1.63 in [you-name-it] currency.

I guess its a money thing, but I had hoped that IG had kept

referee a self-designed world and have a clear view of what
my ships should look like. I have would have converted to the

I need the FFS supplement to make my world come to life.

I guess I could try to use the TNE ship forms and change

Yippi, more work.

I agree with Tommy on this one. I do not think that I will go back to
the CT ship design. I will continue to use FFS in its present or (some
modified) form. I do not like the too simple combat system of CT. I
prefer (as do my players) the hex grid combat. 

Anyone else?

BTW, thanks Tommy for the FFS Lite pointer.

That is a bad move: CT-HG is too simple for most players, and the clamor is
for an FF&S Lite/MT-Lite type of system. NOT the simplistic
oversimplification of Book2 &/or HG. Knowing this as of now, while I WILL
buy T4, neither I nor any of the four players in my group of 7 who are
gonna buy T4 will buy starships.

None of the computers hsould mass over a ton at TL10+. Please also drop the
"Software" rules from the CT model: They\'re so inheretly broke that I have
never met ANYONE who actually used them in the \'80\'s, let alone would they
be used now.

Don, Please reconsider your approach, as you might gain a few by
simplicity, but you will alienate many many more by it.

Sincerely,

CONSTRUCTIVE criticism is healthy.  Impoliteness is not, nor personal 
attacks.  J. Michael Straczynski left the UseNet Babylon-5 newsgroup
because of the personal attacks and vendettas launched there, depriving
many fans of his obvious insight and expertise until a moderated newsgroup
could be established to exclude the boobs, idiots, and sickos.

Like it or not, the former staff members of GDW (Wiseman, Chadwick, Nilsen)
have valuable experience and information about Traveller in ALL of its 
incarnations.  And while you personally may not agree with some of the steps
they took with the game, other may.  Are you so childish that you\'ll drive
off anyone who disagrees with you?  Dave Nilsen arguably knows as much 
about the Traveller background as anyone else (MM included), and the 
inconsistences thereof.  Mightn\'t that be a valuable perspective?

I\'ve met Dave Nilsen at two separate Origins conventions where I was 
staffing (for SJG, not GDW).  He\'s a kind, personable human being, and
he had good reasons for everything he did and wrote.  You may not agree
with all of them (I don\'t), but that\'s no reason to attack the man as 
well as his work.  Would you act as you do in person?  I have this image
of you, Butthead-like, muttering "Huh-huh. It sucks." without meeting his
eyes.  That\'s the maturity level you\'re advocating.  And it\'s that 
attitude which sucks.

Jesus Christ, you half-wit, what reject logic class have you oozed in from?
Do you seriously intend that catalogue to justify your attitude?  I could go
on and on about the need for conflict in drama, the hopeful elements present
in several of those settings, etc., but you\'re just not worth it.

So was Space:1889, and both were hopful settings.  Bad research.  Bad

So?  If you don\'t like it, change it.  But at least don\'t attack the man

    'body' => 'Mr. Perrin:

I have been a fan of Traveller since my sophomore year in high school
(79-80).  I have a copy of *every* Traveller product published by GDW,
with the exception of the very earliest issues of JTAS.  

I *never* liked the construction rules in CT Book2; I always used Book5
(HG) for starship construction (until Brilliant Lances & FFS came along,
that is, whereupon I dropped Book5 like a hot potato).  

Some of my complaints about Book2 (and Book5, to a lesser extent, where
applicable) are as follows: 

	1) The capacity of computers compared to the requirements of
programs is ridiculously inadequate for a industrial technological society
that is *several* *thousand* years old.  (I am a computer professional who
has studied the trends of increasing capacity vs. increasing needs, with
avid interest, for many years.) 

	2) The vector-based movement system of Book2 was too
space-consuming at the scale used (one inch representing one thousand
miles).  In Book5, however, the resolution of combat/movement was *completely*
intangible (which is intolerable to an anal-retentive detail-freak like me
:-).  

	3) The design systems made *no* allowance for sensor and/or commo 
systems (range; detection/counter-detection; detail of resolution; etc.).  

	4) Book2 produced starship design that were space-inefficient when 
compared to Book5 (*my* Bk5 X-Boats had J5 *and* M1; under FFS, they had
J4, M1, *and* 1,000 flight computers [simulating the mythical "extensive
arrays of databanks" always mentioned but never seen]).  
	(BTW: Can you *really* envision the Vilani using an as inefficient
a means of designing merchant ships as this? :-) 

In short, now that I\'ve been spoiled with FFS, anything less is
insufficient.  I would suggest that you design a modular system in the
same *style* as Book2, but build the various modules/components using your
/ IG\'s version of FFS.  (Then you can "publish" your version of FFS on your
web page for the gearheads amongst us who want it.)  

You and Marc and Ken have said that you\'re revising the CT rules "in light
of 20+ years of experience."  As *several* members of this list (i.e.,
"potential customers") have stated, once you have a light-detail framework
in place, it will be difficult to design a more detailed framework *that*
*fits*; if you *start* with a more-detailed framework (even if you never
publish it), you can "dumb-down" the level of detail very easily.  

OTOH, you asked us to tell you if we saw any "glaring holes."  Your chart
of "Size (in displacement tons) of Computers by Tech Level" forgot that
*spaceships* (not starships) can be built at TL-7, 8, and 9.  You need
entries for these TL\'s on your chart.  

I\'d be interested in hearing your refutation/rebuttal.  Thank you.  

Franklin

I don\'t think anyone has ruled out a supplement with complex rules such 
as those in FFS.  IG has only given us a peak at what the /core/ rules 
will be.  Don\'t throw the baby out with the bathwater! :)  If IG follows 
the product development method of the CT era, I think folks such as 
yourself can look forward to a system much more to your liking being

Am I right, Mr. Whitman?

I think that this statement is basically true----but it requires that
certain adjustments are made to baseline HG (IMO).

Since in the case of weapons/screens factors include number of weapons,
weapon "strength", TL, to-hit, screen penetration, and damage it makes a
later FFS-type system much harder to fit in.

I\'d also like to see sensors added.  They could mesh with HG by lowering
the bridge % such that once you add the "new" sensors the result comes
out close for old designs (the old designs would be assumed to have some
basic sensor package depending on ship type subsumed in the bridge %).

Then just add an extension to the USP for sensor type (with factor being
range, say).

I\'ve been playing whatever you want to call this game since approx. \'79...
And I have to admit that i thought the presentation format of FF&S was a
little confusing...almost as bad as the character generation (naw,
impossible). 
While a person could say "well, everybody likes the system that they first
learned best" I do not think this was the case; I loved FF&S, because it
was interesting, complex, and open, but it was MORE complicated for a new
player or ref to understand easily, in comparison to CT.
BTW, has anyone considered the possibility that imperium might not legally
be able to use the material from FF&S? kinda like TSR "had" to switch to
2nd ed. ADnD, because E. Gygax withdrew permission?
Anyway, i get the distinct impression that the upcoming release will be
MUCH easier to learn, and therefore, more likely to achieve popularity.
I am gonna miss FF&S, tho.

I was thinking the same thing last night.  Traveller isn\'t the details
of the technology, it\'s the interaction of the PC\'s with strange and
new enviornments.  The ships were always just a way of getting them
there.

Went back and looked over Books 2 and 5 (Starships and High
Guard)..and remembered why I ended up rolling my own design process. 
Simple...too simple, not enough detail for me.

>MT was a mess...

Yes it was.  I had high hopes, but never could figure it out. Turns
out it wasn\'t me, it was errata city.  I ended up continuing with my
own methods.

Yes, I\'ll want the ability to include more detail, but I can stay with
my own techniques until IG give me a good FF&S like system.

5.56mm, based on the FN Minimi, either belt fed from drums or uses M16 magazines

one or two other NATO nations use it as well. The M60 is retained at platoon

Incorrect.  The M-240 is 7.62mm nato, belt fed, and quite heavy.  It is
actualy used as a COAX or pintel mounted weapon.  (especialy on the M-1

"Hey ref, how many lasers has this thing got?"

"003 batt 2 bear 2."

"3 turrets eh?"

"No, factor 3."

"Which is?"

"Wait until I calculate back from the rules."

TNE ship data sheets gave a real feel to the ship.

Why those old rules! At least with FF&S you felt that the ships were
feasible, if a bit heavy. All this stuff about factors and \'can my computer
fit a program in?\' is so unreal. 

Why also the change in Jump Drive min tech level? Tl 9 starships are cool, if
you\'re a nasty gm. :->
The TL change will invalidate a lot of prior material - expecially in the New 
Era......hmmmmm.


I think whatever design system is used it should be easy to use and realistic -
these arn\'t mutually exclusive goals, it just means that the descriptive text
and layout has to be good, unlike for example the TNE Combat rules. If they had
had better text and layout then I may not have cursed so much whilst running 
combat in TNE. 

Please, please do not go back to the old rules.

Moi aussi, mein freunds.  I hated the CT hit-point-style wounds that
subtracted from STR, etc. even when it was really the only game worth
playing...  Okay, so it still is...

Pero, pienso que se dice, "C\'est la guerre."  I\'ll buy MMT anyway,
just
because I\'d buy frozen pizza if they put the Traveller logo on it... 
;-)

BTW, I am very impressed with the artwork on on the webpage, guys.
Some of its a little fanciful, but very nicely done!  Maybe the cover
art
will make up for any deficiencies in the rules.

Actually, it\'s the M-249 SAW (Squad Automatic Weapon), built to bridge the
gap between the M-16 Assault Rifle and the M-60 GPMG.  The Fire Team member
in the position of automatic rifleman generally carries it.  The M-60 is
retained at platoon AND squad level, as well, depending on the specific
platoons.

Just another quick thought.  Invasion onto a planet on which you have a
strong well equiped determined force becomes much easier if you don\'t care
about the status of the world afterwords.  In other words you can bomb them
into the stone age.  Another possibility that I was considering was the
concept of planet hopping like the U.S. did in the Pacific Theatre in WWII.
Only land on the worlds you HAVE to control.  Blockade the others (wipe out
local Navy, then bomb startports to smithereens, leave a smaller holding
force behind).  Then you will be free to concentrate the majority of your
forces on the critical worlds.  

This works esp well on planets that cannot support themselves without
external aid.  A few well placed ortillery barrages to take out the
Atmosphere Processors etc. can hurry along the surrender.

Lastly I have gotten the impression that Imperial Citizens for the most part
cared very little about who ruled them as it seemed to effect them very
little.  This only changed with the onset of the "Black War".  So
generations had lived under the pretense that warfare was much like the 18th
century limited between military forces only, minimal collateral damage etc.
They were concerned about the outcome of a planetary assault but felt that
they would not feel the effects too much.  The thought never really crossed

I have the following comments.

I have designed hundreds of ships, mostly using High Guard, then Book 2,

found it to be the most difficult to work with.  The FF&S Lite rules might
be a solution, but I think that a suplement with lots of plug ins would also
do the trick.  Also a number of design examples would do it.

Since we are most likely not going to get that, I have the following
suggestions to make:

1. Totaly redesign the Computer design and use rules.  Looking at the table
you included that listed computer names sizes and capacities, I feel that
even starting down that path will lead to ruination.  I would prefer that
you treat computers as Black Boxes instead of using 1970\'s ideas about
computers.  Look at what has transpired in 20 years, much less 3000.
Computers are likely to be incomprehensible by Year 0, so let them be or
design something that WORKS!!!

2. You can use a system like Book 2 or High Guard, but try to make it
extensible so that at some point in the future there might be a IG version
of something like FF&S to let us design vehicles, weapons, electronics, etc.

Other than that, although I prefer the TNE style of ships (excluding
thruster plates), I am eagerly awaiting T4 (especially the character
generation system)

Conflict is one thing, but nihilism another.  The settings seemed to
be contrived
not for their inherent drama, but the gritty feel which they were
supposed to
portray, cut all of the same cloth...  1889 and 2300 never received

[text wherein Don Perrin announces his plans to use the old CT design 
 rules for the new IG Traveller snipped -- you\'ve probably already read it]

First of all, let me begin by stating that going back to the CT/MT system 
would be a very bad move.  I\'ve played Traveller since it came in little 
black books, and the FF&S/Brilliant Lances was by far the best starship 
design and combat system the game has ever had.  For one thing, in 
Brilliant Lances, the same rules apply to both small and large ships 
(although a separate rules system, Battle Rider, is available for large 
scale combat between capital ships, but FF&S is still used for ship 
design -- performance aspects are merely simplified to make large scale 
conflicts between large ships easier to resolve).  Also, choices made in 
the design process actually affect how the ship will operate in combat.  
In the old systems, the only things that varied when it came time to 
trade lumps was how fast ships could accelerate and how many weapons they 
carried (MT almost succeeded in rectifying this).  Most importantly, with 
FF&S/Brilliant Lances, the players skills actually have a bearing on the 
outcome of the battle, something that was only partially true with the 
previous rules sets.  If you\'re going to go \'forward to the past,\' then 
don\'t even bother coming out with design rules -- just come up with a 
bunch of standard ship designs instead.
 
> Computer table:
> Capacity is rated as optimum foreground/background capacity.

[tables snipped]
 
Well, for one thing, why did you move the tech level at which FTL travel 
becomes possible back to 10?  This is a fundamental change to the tech 
structure of the whole Traveller universe, and I feel that you\'ve taken 
it far too lightly.  If you have a rationale for doing this that fully 
takes into account all the implications (such as the delay of the Ziru 
Sirka by several thousand years), I\'d love to hear it.  Also, space 
travel is possible at tech levels far earlier than 10.  If we hadn\'t been 
fighting a world war at the time here on Terra, we might have managed it 
at TL-5 instead of TL-6.  IF Charles Babbage had access to a masterfully 
competent machinist, we might have had computing devices as early as TL-4.

Also, please don\'t bring back the starship computer software rules -- 
they were inherently broken, and I never, ever used them because of it.  
Computing power should not be a function of ship size under any 
circumstance.  True, larger ships will have more control electronics than 
smaller ones, but make this function of ship size, rather than what kind 
of computer was bought for it.  The same computer that calculates the 
jump vector for a 100 ton ship can also calculate the jump vector for a 
100,000 ton ship.  If simplicity is your goal, than adopt the FF&S method 
of figuring starship control and computing requirements -- they were 
vastly superior to earlier solutions.

As I\'ve stated before, I view a return to the CT/MT starship rules with 
about as much enthusiasm as I view a return to communism in Russia.  No 
other rules set meshed so well as FF&S/Brilliant Lances did.  Check them 
out and learn from them.  Do NOT adopt an abstract starship combat system 
as the only starship combat system.  I preferred the Brilliant Lances 
hex/vector system to the old CT vector movement system, because it didn\'t 
require a ruler and protractor, and didn\'t require the sacrifice of my 
living room ("My ship just went under the couch -- do we move it or 
everything else?").  Having experienced all three previous Traveller 
incarnations, I cannot believe that IG has decided that the CT/MT system 
is the best and most popular.  The recent poll and discussion (6 of 57 
respondents preferred the old CT/MT system) also seems to bear this out.

My suggestion:  Don\'t get caught up in the \'forward to the past\' hype.  
TNE failed because GDW failed, not because it was a bad system.  If they 
hadn\'t lost their shirts in that Gygax lawsuit, none of this would be an 
issue.  Check out the FF&S system.  It isn\'t perfect -- there are a few 
things that I would change -- but it bears objective consideration, if 
for no other reason than that many of the same rules for building 
starships also apply to smaller systems, such as vehicles.  Keeping an 
FF&S-type system will save you, and the poor sap who has to come up with 
the vehicle design rules, a lot of work, and providing a common base for 
the design of all systems/vehicles/starships/etc. now will save lots of 
translation headaches in the future.  In the past, if some tank gunner
decided to take a pot-shot at a landing starship, I had no way to figure
out what the effect would be, because I would have to translate between 
at least two different design and combat systems.  Please don\'t put me 
through that hell again.  Don\'t throw out the baby with the bathwater.

You\'re likely to reply:  Well, BL might have been a damn good space 
combat system, but FF&S is so complex that few people find it 
accessible.

Well, that\'s a valid comment, and would agree with you.  Here\'s the fix:  
If the player wants to do the hard work, let them.  If they don\'t want 
to, make it so that they don\'t have to.  Having pre-designed starships, 
vehicles, weapons, equipment, etc. is a good start, and I can\'t recall 
anyone accusing TNE of being delinquent in that regard.  To ease starship 
design tasks, pre-designed sub-systems (\'macros,\' if you will...) such as 
weapons, missiles, sensors, electronics, and the like, that designers can 
\'plug in\' to their ships whenever possible, would help.  Also, rewriting 
some of the design rules for the sake of clarity (such as the umpteen 
unit conversions necessary for figuring out the right size HEPlaR drive) 
should be done.

With the TNE system, I got more pre-designed starships than I could 
stand, and I was damn happy for it.  Even with an FF&S-type design 
system, you\'re likely to get more designs than you can deal with if you 
give credit where it\'s due.  If you task a few people to do a lot of 
work, you\'ll probably need to lay some cash on them, but you probably 
already know that.  Another thing to keep in mind is design variants.  
Many of the merchant ships in TNE (and earlier rules sets) were 
under-gunned, which was no good for someone seeking higher profits doing 
higher-risk runs.  Every standard design should also include some common 
variants (that actually MAKE SENSE).  A word of caution:  Without at 
least a firm \'beta-test\' version of the design rules available, you\'re 
going to end up doing a lot of re-writing, or publishing a lot of 
erratta.  You might want to put off your request for designs until the 
design system\'s been firmed up.  If all you have so far are those flawed 
tables, you\'ve got a lot of work ahead of you (another good reason to 
adopt FF&S <grin>).

[stuff about ship pre-designs snipped]
 
> Let me see what you can do!

Unless the Army sends me to Bosnia, I\'d love to put in time on this 
project over the summer, if it\'s one that I can believe in.   If you 
decide to adopt an FF&S/BL system, I\'d love to help refine it, and put in 
some of the work necessary to make it accessible to those who don\'t 
relish anal-retentive number crunching.  It is, by far, the best 
evolution of design and combat rules that the game has ever seen, despite 
its faults.  If I didn\'t think so, my little black books wouldn\'t be in a 
storage locker right now.
 
> Thanks for your interest and help!

You\'re welcome, but please take heed:  If this \'Forward to the Past\' 
hysteria is the prevalent mindset at Imperium Games, then they\'re not 
going to get my dollar.  Judging by the \'majority mood\' in TML right now, 
you\'re not likely to get quite a few other people\'s dollars either, and 
that would be a damn shame.  If the refinements and enhancements in TNE 
are chucked in favor of alphanumeric Universal Profiles, 2d6 statistical 
curves, and abstract combat systems that have little discernable common 
basis with design, equipment, or character generation rules, then I\'m not 
going to by your supplement, the new Traveller, or anything else IG puts 
out -- I\'ll just stick with my TNE.

I respect IG\'s efforts to maintain continuity and get the Traveller 
machine going again as quickly as possible.  When Marc Miller first 
announced that control of Traveller had reverted to him with the demise 
of GDW, and laid out his vast, ambitious plans for the game\'s 
resurrection, I was quite pleased.  There are many things that he 
indicated that he\'d like to see happen that I\'d be more than happy to 
assist with, especially in the realm of computer-driven player aids, as I 
feel that these would go a long way towards making more complex elements 
of the rules system accessible to those unable or unwilling to do the 
number crunching (although a CD-ROM version of the Imperial Encyclopedia, 
or even the AAB, would be a hoot as well).  However, I find the 
gravitation towards the old CT and MT rules systems disturbing.  I urge 
the guiding hands of Traveller, Mark IV not to take the easy out and rush 
a clunky CT/MT-clone to market.  Take the best of what\'s available (20+ 
years of experience should help you), including the many parts of TNE 
that WEREN\'T broken, and work with them.  Don\'t let the fact that GDW 
went under while handling TNE bias you towards any previous rules system.

 If you mean "Why didn\'t Frank, Marc, and Loren design
 more Traveller products?" there is no simple, words-of-
 one-syllable answer. I can\'t go into the full details,
 but:
 
 Each of the design staff had one or more game lines to
 oversee (we called the position line manager) Marc was
 line manager for Traveller, Frank for 2300 AD (and
 eventually Space: 1889, Cadillacs & Dinosaurs and others).
 I was line manager for Twilight: 2000/Merc: 2000. In
 addition, we all had growing (some might say festering)
 administrative responsibilities that sucked up increasing
 amounts of time and energy. I cannot speak for the others,
 but I discovered that I could develop three products in the
 the time it took me to design one. I began asigning projects
 to outside designers and overseeing there work from GDW. I can
 only assume that Marc discovered the same thing (3:1), and I
 chose to assign work to DGP because of the overall quality of
 their work. Why didn\'t I do any MegaTraveller products? I was
 totally absorbed in Twilight: 2000 and (to a lesser extent)
 2300 AD. I was so deeply into these lines that I did not
 have time to keep up with MegaTraveller advances. Any creative
 energies I had in the SF line tended to go into 2300 AD because
 I managed to stay up to speed on that game\'s system and background.

 I\'ve wasted enough phosphors, but I have one more thing to
 say: No one at GDW hated Traveller. None of us wanted the
 game to fail, and none of us took conscious action to destroy
 the game (some people feel that our decisions, conscious or
 otherwise destroyed the game -- they can believe what they like).

 Ummm...I dunno...perhaps because some of us believe that every
 person (adult, quasi-adult, or otherwise) is worthy of a
 minimum level of respect and courtesy? 
 
 > I think criticism is a healthy thing, be it polite or not.
 
 I don\'t mind critiism, but I find that a reasoned critique
 without personal attack is more likely to be accepted and
 acted upon than the so-called "in yer face" variety. Maybe
 this is only true of us Mesolithic holdovers from a
 previous epoch, but I don\'t think so.

 Was Space: 1889 omitted because of your lack of knowledge, or
 because it doesn\'t support your hypothesis?

 Tantalus...same folks who own Twilight: 2000, Merc: 2000, 2300 AD, and this

Second-guessing is a very popular pastime. GDW lasted for 23 years, which is
longer than most small businesses. If I had it all to do over again, I think
I\'d do everything the same, except that I\'d probably not spend  good money to
see Aliens 3, and I\'d try to eat less junk food.

I guess I fall somewhere in the middle on this one.  

I don\'t want to go back to something as simple as Book 2.  As soon 
as I bought Book 5 High Guard, I basically all but forgot about the 
book 2 design rules (and that was 15 years ago).  I thought the 
results were too abstract, and I liked the combat system less than 
the designs.
I really didn\'t find High Guard to be all that cumbersome a design process.  
They were still relatively easy to design, and the combat system was much 
improved, although it is now dated.  I would suggest that a High Guard system 
(revamped) should be a bare minimum for simplistic design rules.

I don\'t like FF&S.  I thought the organization of the book made it 
difficult to read, and I really didn\'t see the point in devoting a 
lot of space to "alternate" technologies that weren\'t ever going to 
be supported by any other book in the system.  I guess the 
overwhelming complexity cut into my limited time too much to think 
about using it.

I liked MT, at least after taking advantage of the errata.  It was 
complex enough to really make ship design interesting, yet it still 
takes me just a little while to design a vehicle or ship.  I thought 
the complexity was just about my speed.  Frankly, If the new design 
rules don\'t grab me, I\'ll probably continue to use MT rules.

I would make the following suggestions at a minimum for whatever 
design rules are used, and whatever form Starships take.

1.  Proofread.  Both FF&S and MT suffered grievously (especially MT) 
from very poorly edited design rules.  I would rather see well 
written and edited design rules that I\'m not real crazy about than 
have to white out several pages and insert new tables...

2.  Design lots of ships.  Some of us who run campaigns are pressed for time.  
Although I enjoy designing ships, there are lots of times where it just isn\'t 
possible.  It\'d be nice to have a couple hundred ship designs to pick 
and choose from to incorporate games.  

3.  It sounds like you actually figured this one out, but don\'t make 
a system as complex as FF&S as your ONLY design system.  While I see 
no problem with designing an FF&S style supplement for the gearheads, 
I sure wouldn\'t want to be FORCED to design a ship with one.

        Thanks for the plug, but what I\'ve got there isn\'t really a working
design sequence, as I haven\'t had time to fill out the charts. It\'s more of
an outline of how FF&S Light could work. Comments are welcome, and if
there\'s enough interest we could develop it further for those who aren\'t
interested in Paleolithic Starships, and intend to stay with FF&S/TNE.
Assuming Marc Miller doesn\'t consider that an infringement of his copyright.
And, of course, if they actually listen to their customers and go with
something along those lines, we can develop it for them and hand it over.
I\'m not greedy ... a single line of credit would be more than I\'d expect...

        CT *Style*, not CT. That\'s the whole idea behind Fire, Fusion and
Steel Light. Take detailed rules, create a set of plug-n-play systems a la
CT/HG, and make that the basic design sequence. Those who want more detail
can use the full-up system to design ships FULLY COMPATIBLE with the basic
ships. Which a CT/HG clone won\'t do, even within itself.

        Why start with something that\'s (in my humble opinion), substandard
by today\'s lights AND by what most customers want, and then try to build on
it? If your foundation is weak, the house will be weak. Start with an
improved FF&S and publish the Light version as the basic design sequence.

        AND! Imperium Games will have a stack of starships ALREADY DESIGNED!
That\'s what they\'re asking for, right? Spend an hour browsing the web sites
and you\'ll have scores of ships. A quick e-mail to the author and you\'ll
have permission to publish.

        I agree, and so does most of the list. The whole idea behind FF&S
Lite was to have a Book 2/High Guard STYLE of design, while still
maintaining compatibility with a full up design system.

        Then we get the same old problem as ever -- designs produced with
the detailed version will be completely different from the designs produced
with the basic version. I HATE that as much as I hate having predesigned
spacecraft in the game that don\'t bother to follow the game\'s rules.

        And mixing Book 2 and High Guard makes the inconsistency worse. Try
designing a ship using each method and compare them. Having different rules
for starships and nonstarships is asinine. A nonstarship should look and
perform just like a starship with the jump drive taken out.

        As for the time to develop a new detailed system -- DON\'T! We\'ve
already got FF&S, there\'s a very active core of people on the Beta list who
WANT to fix it and would do so for free. The new system should be an
improved version of FF&S, with a modular, HG style Light design system
derived from it. Developing the Light system from the detailed should be a
matter of days ... I sat down and came up with an outline on my Web page in
an afternoon, and surely professionals could do better.

        Incidentally, the MAIN reason I\'ve always been interested in
Traveller was the Hardcore "Hard Science Fiction" feel. If it\'s just going
to turn into Yet Another Science Fantasy Space Opera game, there are plenty
of those out there for me to turn to.

        The GDW-Beta list and the Traveller list came up with this idea some
time ago: it\'s what everybody is referring to as FF&S Light. A CT/HG *like*
design model that avoids the clunkiness/inconsistency of CT/HG, but is still
as simple. And Merrick Burkhardt (among others) on the GDW Beta list has
done some work on a HG-like combat system for FF&S ships.

recent response to your stated intention to go back to CT/HG design rules
for spacecraft, most people (your customers, that is) are opposed to that
idea and prefer something more. The most popular design system by far seems
to be FF&S. Complaints against FF&S include its poor layout and the
excessive complexity for those who simply want to bash out a design quickly.
However, a solution, in the form of "FF&S Light" has been proposed, which
would have the simplicity of CT/HG-like design, provide a little more
detail, and still being compatible with a detailed design. 

        Furthermore, a design system based on FF&S would answer Don Perrin\'s
original request very quickly -- he was looking for predesigned starships. A
few hours on the Web would yield scores of designs, of a wide variety of
ships. E-mail the author to get permission and the original worksheet, and
you\'d be set. My site alone has 23 different TNE designs, of all types,
military, scout, diplomatic and commercial, ranging from a 200Td Yacht to a
2,000,000Td MegaMerchant. Current designers would already have a "draft"
version of the new rules, and could begin churning out more designs. These
designs would then only need slight tweaking to the final version.

(***** BEGGING MODE ON *****)

        PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE
        Reconsider using CT/HG design rules. You could do a much better job
by adapting FF&S, and creating a Light version. I realize you\'ve committed
yourselves to putting out an MMT product, regardless, by GenCon, but I
believe this part could be done in a matter of weeks. Especially given the
level of free help that is available.

        I volunteer as much time as I have available to help, outside of
grad school and my real job (keeping the Milstar comsat working). In fact, I
have three years\' worth of accumulated leave, if needed. I\'m not asking for
anything in return ... not money, not credit, not free products, not thanks,
nothing. I just want the new Traveller to be something I\'m willing to spend
money on. And something with spacecraft based on 20+year old rules is not it.

        And I think you\'ll find others are willing to put in sweat to get
the best design system that is (1) simple for the beginner/non-gearhead, (2)
provides a decent level of detail at the basic level, (3) is extensible and
satisfies gearheads, and (4) isn\'t as "retro" as CT/HG.

        Thisbasic  design system could still be no larger than one of the
original black books, and would be as easy to use, but would be head and
shoulders above CT/HG. You would also already have one supplement, the
detailed design system, written and ready to publish.

(***** Begging Mode Off *****)

        Please, don\'t misunderstand me. I\'m not trying to attack anybody
personally, or gore anybody\'s ox. The feeling of "pseudo-realism" in
Traveller is what first attracted me, and is why I have followed each
improvement. If I wanted "soft SF" Space Opera, there are plenty of other
games I could have chosen, and still could. Since I don\'t, I\'ll give up
entirely and stick with what I\'ve already got.

        I realize you have your own vision of where Traveller should go. It
is Marc Miller\'s Traveller, literally, and he can mold it to his own vision.
But it\'s not a religion, it\'s a business. If that vision doesn\'t match up
with what others want, they\'re customers not believers, and they won\'t
follow. And that\'s what scares me. If this flops, there won\'t be an
opportunity to turn around and try again. Traveller will be dead except in
the hearts of those who\'ve "kept the flame."

        Just to harp on the same subject one more time: I agree a simpler
design sequence is needed to help draw new players. I disagree that that
sequence is CT/HG. The new sequence should allow *seamless* extension for
old hands, and for new players who want more detail. A revision of FF&S, to
include more predesigned components and simplified integration rules is the
way to go.

        Thank you for your time in reading this. I welcome responses, either
public on the Traveller mailing list, or private to me. I really would like
to hear from you, even if it\'s just "Bugger off, who cares if you buy MMT?
We know what we want."

A brief update on the Traveller Sale & Auction I\'m running...

For the first two weeks of this run, I\'m taking bids. If you bid for an item
and nobody else bids on that item, then it will be a straight sale to you at
the end of the two weeks.

If there are multiple bids on an item, then we will go into auction mode for
the next two weeks.

If there is anything unsold after these first four weeks, then I\'ll probably
have a "fire sale" with gut-wrenching low prices. Gut-wrenching, that is, for
you--if you want something real bad, but think I\'m asking too much, your gut
will be wrenching while you wait four weeks (snicker).

I\'m not trying to make a profit here--merely trying to sell off duplicates
and get them into the hands of folks who can use them.

I currently have a number of individual bids on items, plus a block bid of
$300 cash or $400 in trade for the whole thing.

I received one piece of mail that (I hope jokingly) called me a racist for
disallowing non-US/Canadian customers from participating. Obviously this
person does not know me personally, as they would find that I am one of the
more mild and inoffensive persons around. So, as I said, I hope this was a
joke. Certainly, though, the accusation make my blood boil.

The reason for the exclusion on non-US/Canadian customes is simple: Several
years ago I sold off a number of items from my collection (mostly duplicates)
as I pared back. The ratio of money recieved to pain received was not good. I
had problems with shipping stuff overseas. I had problems with foreign
exchange rates. I had problems with people sending me checks with foreign
funds. I had problems with customs. I had problems with the Post Office (and
with foreign post offices). I had irate letters from people who could not
understand why their first class/airmail letter reached me faster than the
package I sent them--when they had paid for "ground" postage. Do you know
what "ground" postage to Europe gets you? A berth on the bananna boat, and
that ain\'t a fast way of travelling.

So excuse me if I exclude non-US/Canadian customers. I\'m trying to get this
stuff out with a minimum of hassle. I\'m not trying to hassle or exclude
folks--just trying to help you out and spread the wealth of information that
is currently locked in my basement.

I\'m following up on David Golden\'s suggestions. There\'s a lot of good in what
he says, but let\'s try and take it one step further.

How about we use a multi-part approach.

For the first release (the August rules set) and the Starships book (which is
just finished ship designs, if I understand correctly), the rules are FF&S
"ultra-lite" and the ships in the Starships book are designed with full FF&S
rules.

As long as the ultra-lite or lite rules and the full rules are compatible,
i.e., you can move from one to the other with a minimum of trouble, this
would seem to be the best of all possible worlds.

This would satisfy folks like me who want a quick-and-dirty rules set (which
"Classic Traveller" did have) and those who want to design ships down to the
last rivet (just kidding). A future Imperium Games release could then be FF&S
Mark II, the full-blown hard-core book for those who like that kind of thing.

Of course, I\'d buy both. But then I\'m certifiable when it comes to collecting
game stuff!

Not everyone wants FF&S.  I want it to go back to the way it was.  Yes provide
more detail, but don\'t force the people that play and ref the game to spend
hours on something that should take minutes.  I could build a specialized 
starship for a session in a few minutes, and spend the rest of the time on
the scenerio.  I don\'t want ships defined to the nth level of detail.  Frankly
it just doesnt matter.  You need J distance, M-speed, fire power and defense.
(Ok sensors are a good idea, and the computer needs to have less of a role)
You need state rooms, and cargo holds, but not much more.  The number of MegaJoules
produced by the power plant is completley irrelevent in role-playing.  Yes its
fun for the gear heads.  

I did not like High Guard\'s USP.  There were too many codes to remember their
positional locations and what they ment.  But at least you could use high guard.
Now with the ship designs in FF&S and TNE, you cant easily take ship A put it
in a fire fight with ship B, and in less than 5 minutes solve the combat.  In 
my TNE campaign, I almost refused to do ship-to-ship because it was too complex.

Why is AD&D so successful with the most unrealistic combat system?  Because it\'s
simple.  Roll to hit, roll to damage, next contestant.  This should be the guiding
rule-- Keep it Simple!  Traveller is a Role-Playing Game, not a lesson in mechanical
engineering.  

Besides this FF&S vs. CT debate has been hashed out before.  There are two camps
and both camps have valid points.  Don came on here specifing his criteria and asked
for help.  He didn\'t want to be blasted with opinions on which system is best.

Yes they have, Starship\'s Book 2.  The Traveller Book, Book 5 High Guard.
An FF&S ship uses 250 words just to get through the systems on board, with
no room left for a description.

Okay, time for the arts student to speak up (life\'s like a box of
chocolates...:-)!  I don\'t know where the rest of you get the time to spend
4 hours designing a starship for an RPG, but I have a life to worry about. 
FF&S is completely impractical for me and (I suspect) the vast majority of
the population out there.  I really like the HG design system, I can get
a ship up and running in 15 minutes.  That leaves me 3.75 hours to
actually RPG (or maybe like, y\'know, work or socialize or something!). If 
I need a ship in the middle of a session, I can send the players on a 
munchie run and by the time they get back, it\'s ready.

Sorry, this is sounding a little beligerent.  Too much caffeine I guess.  
But my point is that for me personally a return to HG is wonderful.  I 
could stand a _little_ more detail, but nothing like FF&S.  Detail (IMHO) is
pointless for role-playing purposes.  If what you get off on is designing
stuff, then do that, but I don\'t think it is integral to most people\'s 
concepts of roleplaying.  Certainly not the hordes of gamers who buy (and 
actually play!) such games as GURPS and the Storyteller series.

Having said that, I could live with an FF&S light product, but I think 
I\'m talking "fat-free" where others are thinking "calorie reduced".

        That\'s exactly why we want a light version of FF&S. Nobody is saying
the only design sequence should be the ultra-detailed FF&S. But we want all
the systems to be consistent. If I "bash" a ship together using the basic
system, I want to be able to tweak it later. If somebody designs a ship
using one system, it shouldn\'t be significantly different than one designed
using the other, except in level of detail.

        I agree it should "go back the way it was" in that you should have
an easy way of banging out a one-use ship for a scenario in minutes. I
disagree that CT/HG is the way to go. When the detailed system comes out,
it\'s going to have to live with whatever limitations are in the basic.

        And the idea of using CT for some ships and HG for others is, in my
opinion, a perfect example of an inconsistency. If you design a starship
with a jdrive, and a non-starship with an equivalent amount of lead ballast,
they should be otherwise identical.

    'body' => 'Okay, while we\'re taking a new look (or an old look made new, or whatever)
at Traveller starship construction, I\'ll draw some fire by talking about
the perennial problem of crew sizes.  Some heretical changes in Traveller
"canon" are going to come out of this, but I think the discussion might
prove interesting.

I\'d like to advocate the larger model of crew sizes used by TNE rather 
than the smaller model pursued first by CT and then by MT, but perhaps
with a stronger variation as tech level increases.  I\'ll support my 
position with some math below: for now let me address the role-playing
possibilities.

David Nilsen (whom I do _not_ regard as Truth Incarnate, but who strikes 
me as a smart, thoughtful fellow with some good ideas) defended the
larger crew sizes at one or another Origins talk by describing the
potential for NPC\'s (whether as social acquaintances, redshirts for
the bloody-minded beasties, etc.), technical difficulties to be solved 
by skill rolls and exciting role-play when the vessel\'s crew size
drops significantly (due to, say, starship combat, which also paid more
attention (laudably) to the individual in TNE), and a sense of greater
"realism".  One of the things that always disappointed me about TNE/FF&S
was the assumption that crew sizes had always been thus, even in the 
pre-Virus, heavily-computerized Third Imperium.  I wanted to hear about
cargo bays aboard relic starships partly transformed into extra state-
rooms to allow the RC\'s (or Free Traders\') TL12 human-controlled systems
to handle starships designed for the TL15 Imperials.  But somehow that
bit of chrome didn\'t make it in, except in a few GDW-beta discussions
on the topic.

More widely-varying crew sizes would also exacerbate TL differences
during interstellar wars, which would help explain Vargr futility in
attacking all but weakly-defended systems during the Frontier Wars,
the rapid Terran victory in the original Interstellar Wars after
leap-frogging the Vilani, and so on.

I\'ll take a fairly hard-line approach below, and my assumptions are of 
course open to argument.  For the sake of simplicity, I\'m going to assume
fairly steady rates of variation in the "assist" provided to crew by command-
and-control systems.  Linear rather than geometric progressions would change
the results a lot.

Now for some math:  I\'m using the "All Hands: Magazine of the U.S. Navy"
"Owner\'s and Operator\'s Manual" from January 1996.  A Los Angeles class
attack submarine (probably our closest analogy to a Traveller starship),
has a displacement (submerged) of 6,927 tons and a crew complement of
145 (p. 39).  Now, those are tons of water.  I figure an English ton is
around 908kg (though I\'m figuring this in spare time at work and might be 
off a smidgen here or there: I\'m sure someone will correct me if I\'m wrong!
:-).  So a displacement ton is around .9 m^3 (1 m^3 of water weiging 
1000kg).  So a displacement ton is around .9/14 or .0643 Traveller
tons (14 m^3 of LHyd weighing 1000kg).  And the Los Angeles submarine is
thus about 6,927 x 0.0643 = 445 tons, which seems about right.  (It\'s
a system defense boat!)

Now, with 145 crew for 445 tons, that\'s about 0.326 crew per ton.  CT\'s 
TL12 400-ton SDB, from CT Supplement 7 "Traders and Gunboats", has a crew 
of 10.  That\'s 0.025 per ton.  So the TL12 SDB requires 7.7% as much crew 
as the TL7 sub, on a ton-for-ton basis.  That\'s like achieving a 30% 
reduction in crew size at each tech level (12-7 = 5, (.077)^.2 = .60),
which I find only barely on the verge of believable.  At that rate, a
TL15 SDB would require only 1.7% as much crew as the sub (.60^8 = 0.05),
or about 0.006 crew per ton (that\'s two people for the entire SDB).

MT kept the crew size for the SDB about the same, at 12 (p. 85 Imperial
Encyclopedia, though I don\'t have the errata handy with me, alas).  TNE
yanked the crew requirement for the SDB to 24 (p. 373 main rule book),
which, at a ratio of 0.06 (18% the sub), gives a decline rate of about 
29%.  Hmmm.

Let\'s assume that a true "singleship" (e.g. an IISS Scout/Courier, which 
we\'re told can be run by one person in a pinch (which would be 0.1 persons
per ton)) only becomes possible at TL15.  This yields a decline rate of
24%, which somehow I feel happier about.  The SDB, at TL12, would thus
have a crew size (roughly) of [(.86)^5]*.326*400 = 61.

Now hold on there with the tar and feathers!  I don\'t have any problem 
with that crew size for a vessel that\'s got to be able to maintain itself 
while hiding out in gas giants while armed with heavy ordnance (nuclear
missiles, sensitive lasers, or what-have-you).  And that\'s still less 
than a third of what a modern nuclear submarine has to work with, under
much less challenging conditions.  The higher crew size, in fact,
INCREASES my sense of wonder rather than lessening it, thinking about
all those guys scrambling around the ship while prowling on patrol.

A non-military vessel like, say, the standard far trader (200 tons), 
might be able to get away with, say, a third of the ratio of a military
ship (fewer complex and highly-ruggedized systems, no necessity for 
redundancy in case of casualties, etc.).  So our Empress Marava, at 
TL12, might need only [(.86)^5]*.109*200 = 10 crew.  And by TL 15, in 
the height of the Third Imperium, far traders would be down to 
[(.86^8)]*.109*200 = 6 or 7 crew, around the size of the stereotypical
gaming group.

Traveller\'s huge capital starships would now become truly impressive war 
machines on the _human_ scale as well as the purely physical one.  We\'d
have a good explanation for the failure of many TL9 or TL10 cultures,
during the Long Night, say, to form self-sufficient interstellar trading
communities (a crew of (.86^3)*.109*200 = 14 on a far trader crimps
the economics a bit more, except, perhaps, to visionaries like Cleon
Zhunastu, who see what wider trade and technical dissemination will do
for his people).

Comments?  Suggestions?  I think I\'ve managed to keep things _reasonably_
close to the CT scale, except for military vessels (which I always found
too small) and low-tech ships (which adds to the allure of "trading up"
to higher-tech equipment).  Heck, I might throw these into a home-grown
campaign even if IG doesn\'t in the formal rules-set.  And I don\'t even
belong to GDW-beta... maybe I should join all the other heretics over
there....  :-)

Dave,

Why don\'t you submit your material to Imperium Games and see if they\'d
like to use it? Like - mail them a paper copy and send a paper copy to
Don Perrin & Marc Miller?

The only thing I\'ve heard is that it _has_ to be 100% compatible with
CT systems. As long as it fits - send it, and maybe they\'ll like it.

In the meantime, they\'re never going to do anything based on the near-flame
experiences happening here.

be in place as a target for the add-on products to present!

Book 2 was great fun for starship construction when I was in junior high.
I believe West End Games has a very similar product for their Shatterzone
sf-rpg system.  Book 5 produced both more detail and more abstraction,
ironically enough.  But MT and FF&S, despite some of their other flaws,
are what got many people excited about Traveller.  The game system should
be able to grow with the players, whether they be junior-high or post-
graduate students, of any level of mathematical or tinkering ability.
I think Dave (and I) are merely trying to forestall any "growing pains"
by ensuring that a highly-detailed system, or at least the rudiments
of one, is in place _before_ the simpler system is created at all.

I\'ll continue to use FF&S, I suspect, regardless of what appears from IG.
I\'d like to make a combination easier (or even unnecessary, by surpassing
the former product!).  As many have said, SF games, and Traveller in
particular, are in large part about PEOPLE, not parts, about exploration,
not inventory... but we all also know that too much handwaving, as in
ST:TNG, leads rapidly to technobabble and difficulty in satisfactorily
sustaining that same story.

Please allow the same attention to starships that you do to characters:
I\'d like to see old "rust-bucket" free traders be able to be as well-

stewards, and captains.

  US Subs are actually not as automated as they could be. The newest
Swedish sub (Gotland, around 1500 tons submerged) has a wartime crew of 
around 17. For example there is only one man at the helm, not four+one
officer to oversee them.

        And there\'s actually some logic behind that. Automation is great,
until it gets damaged. And military ships (space or sea) are more likely to
be damaged than merchants. So you have to carry enough people to handle
things when the new-fangled autogizmos go out. But those people will get
bored, stale and lose their skills if all they do is sit around watching
"George" run things. So you dispense with some of the automation in the
first place to keep them busy. That, and you\'re carrying them anyway. Might
as well use them.

        However (and I just put some of this stuff on my FF&S Light page), I
do think Traveller needs more variety in crew setup. I don\'t see any reason
why, if oil tankers can be crewed by a dozen, large ships in Traveller
can\'t. There\'s no reason a TL-12 50,000Td bulk carrier should need more than
8 or 10 crew. Stuff really doesn\'t break that often, and computers do a fine
job of running things. On the other hand, a 5,000Td destroyer should
probably have quite a few more. They need gunners, they need damage control,
they need to make up for the possible loss of automation, and they need to
have more crewmembers on shift. The bulk carrier just needs one person on
the bridge to watch sensors, monitor engines and comm, etc. The destroyer
should have people on duty in engineering, separate comm and sensor
operators, backups, etc.

        Then you add cultures such as post-Virus Reformation Coalition, who
have an innate aversion to automation, and even their merchants will be
closer in manning to a military vessel.

The other night, on X-boat, tc@library.solent.ac.uk asked if anyone 
was going to publish the rumored \'unfinished DGP Aliens Modules.  
That tickled my memory; back when GDW was going down and no one here

something about the rights to DGP stuff.  I wrote him, and he\'s given 
me permission to quote his reply:

- ---- Forwarded Message Follows ---- 
Dear Bruce,
 
Thankyou for your interest in DGP\'s operations. DGP is working
diligently on its very own game system. We\'re working on a set of
core rules, and 3 distinct campaign settings. We have no idea
when these will be ready for publication.
 
We are also looking forward to rereleasing DGP\'s Traveller
archives in various forms, and we are interested in publishing
new works for the Traveller game system. WE ARE CURRENTLY IN
NEGOTIATIONS WITH IMPERIUM GAMES & MARC MILLER. We\'re in
agreement on the general terms of the licensing contract, but
these things take time, and there are still details to be worked
out. Just as soon as the contract is signed, we will get back to
work on Traveller. We won\'t even wait for the ink to dry!
 
And yes, there are unfinished Traveller projects in DGP\'s
archives in various stages of completion.
 
I hope I\'ve answered your questions satisfactorily.
 
Sincereley,

The variation by tech level is a good idea.  Crew sizes for small

I\'m glad you wrote this!  I don\'t really like the Traveller way of
describing ships in H2 displacement tons.  I describe my ships using
H20 displacement tons.  Doing it this way allows players to directly
compare ship sizes to real ships:  ex 3000 ton destroyer is a 200 ton
ship in Traveller terms (I appox conversions back and forth */ by 15),
a 7,200 ton Layfette class sub is 480 tons, the 42,000 ton battleship
Bismark was 2800 tons, a 80,000 ton modern aircraft carrier is 5400
tons.  Another way of saying this is 100 ton Scout = 1500 ton (frigate
sized) ship; 200 ton Free Trader = 3000 ton very small cargo ship; 400
ton Subsidized Trader =
6000 ton small cargo ship; 800 ton Broadsword = 12000 ton light
crusier.

I sniped your math...good work!  It mirrors a lot of what I\'ve done
intuitively.  My version of the universe doesn\'t allow automation to
increase very fast.  Crews stay larger longer.

Military ships always have had larger crews than civilian ships, for
combat replacements, fire control, etc.  It makes sense to continue
that into space.

BTW, is the GDW-Beta list still active?  If so, what\'s going on in
there? And how would one join?

So I noticed.  <g> I eagerly dropped by the other night and got what

I hope you continue, if you can.  I\'m not a gear-head, when it comes
to ship, but I do want to have as much detail as I need, and more over
time.

Like several folks have said, I want pre-gened ships, a light system
AND a detailed system.  Most of my ships start off as quick slapped
together jobs, and then acquire more and more detail as they are used. 
Using CT the detail totally had to come from me, and it followed no
standard.  Using FF&S there was no way to produce a quick ship, but it
gave me something to adapt and add into my simple CT like ships.  It
would be much better if the light and detailed systems worked together
better.

If you are working in space (exploring, fighting, whatever) your ship is
very important in some ways for roleplaying.  Aside from the details
that give the story life, I think sensors, for example, are very, very
important.  Many players and refs don\'t really have a feel for what they
detection problems really are.  These are mostly physics limited, so we
can actually have a decent idea of what it would take without much work
(0th to 1st order, anyway).  We have history for low end base point,
physics-limit as the upper end, and now for a midpoint.

Weapons/screens are similar.  Why, for example, have a combat system
that allows a few kg HE warhead do more damage than one with a smaller
warheard when they both hit the target at 10s to 100s of km/s?  These
are not things that need to be written about in detail in published
materials----but we\'re being asked for feedback on the design
assumptions.  The finished product will be simple to use, and internally
consistant.  Fine, I like that, too.  But why not fix some assumptions
that have to be made before gelling up the final, simple rules (there\'s
another end-point for assumptions, the canon (although that has some
stray ideas here and there that should be cleaned up once and for all
(jump-torps, etc.).

I think that the gearhead, physics types aren\'t crying out for an
impossible to use system----what we want is to know that _underneath_ the
simple system to be published soon there is some serious thought to the
nature of the technology.  And, yes, on a nitty gritty level.  FFS did a
good job, but didn\'t use the CT canon as an end-point, so it never
replicated CT designs very well.

What I want is a HG-like system.  Simple base construction, then plug-in
sub-systems.  Then I want a FFS-like system to make the tables that
appear in the HG-like system.

That\'s fine with me, as well, but retrofitting a detailed system could
be really hard if there are no changes in HG as it stands.  Modular to
me means that a detailed system won\'t break *any* designs made with the
simple system.  Book2 vs. HG does not meet this test.  B2/HG/Mayday/MT
all produced different combat results using ships designed to the same
specs.  Which is canon?  (HG with Mayday worked pretty well, IMO).

HG also produces optimized navies that don\'t mesh with canon very well
(could some hardcore TCS players comment?).

I enjoy the level of detail that FF&S gives me when I need it.  If I don\'t
need it, I just describe the ship.  I have never, for example, paniced when
a ship encounter roll gave me a ship that I didn\'t have right on hand.  

For exceedingly large ships, the method is simple:

Me:  "It\'s a 30,000 ton RQS Cruiser.  They\'re hailing you.. want to do a
customs and safety inspection."

Player 1:  "Hmmmm.. What\'s it armed with?"

Me:  "It has weapon bays larger than your ship.  Lots of them."

Player 2:  "I\'m cutting the drive.. everybody into their best uniforms!"

Someone mentioned not needing to know the exact power output of the power
plant.  That information was critical when the characters had to make it
look like a planet\'s defences were working by running the mount for a deep
meson site off their engine.

Please give us the detail to design what we need.  Using a modular system at
the lower level, but you will lose players the farther you get from hard
science.

Steve\'s Expanded USP
XX-000000AB0-000000C-00000-0

1.  Sensors (and Detection Rules)
I have always used two additional values in the UPP to describe the Active and 
Passive Sensors on the ship (noted by A and B in the sample USP above).  The 
Passive Sensors were available in a number of different sizes/powers, 
restricted by the size of the ship and its tech level (as well as the bank 
account of the ship builder).  The Active Sensors were also available in a 
number of different sizes/powers, restricted by the ship\'s Computer and Tech 
Level.  Different sensor packages had different ranges, and in some cases had 
better performance in special circumstances (detecting things in an atmosphere, 
or high-radiation area etc).  The passive sensors were all basically the same, 
differentiated mainly by detection range.

But of course Sensors are of little use without sensor rules.  I used straight 
High-Guard combat for squadron actions, but for ship-to-ship battles or similar 
small engagements I would use a combination of Mayday movement rules and High 
Guard combat.  In Full-Scale High Guard combat the sensors were fairly 
lobotomized.  Sensors would allow the squadron commander to get initiative, and 
could be used as jammers against the other side\'s sensors.  Their main High 
Guard effect was sensors acted as Fire Directors for missiles.  The sensor 
would allow only a certain number of missiles to be controlled per turn.  In 
the "tactical" combat sensors would work to detect the target and to lock on, 
as well as to detect incoming missiles and other surprises (very similar to the 
2300AD sensor rules, though less complex).

Price drops 10% per TL above minimum.  Volume is constant.


2.  More Missile Information (Different Types?)
In the text of the ship description, I would include how many salvoes of 
missiles the ship carried.  Salvoes could be made up of any of several types of 
missile:  Contact, Proximity, Antiradiation, Nuclear Contact, Nuclear 
Proximity.  Contact missiles depended on pure explosive power to damage the 
target.  Proximity missiles would either explode when near a ship or lie in 
wait for a passing ship before exploding; filling space with lots of metal 
particles to damage the passing ship (due to relative velocities and other fun 
physis effects).  Antiradiation missiles were Contact missiles designed to home 
in on radiation or sensor signatures (no controller required!).  Nuclear 
Contact missiles were like normal contact missiles, but far more devastating.  
Nuclear Proximity Missiles acted like the normal Proximity Missile, but instead 
of fast-moving fragments they depended on EMP to damage their enemies.  Except 
for AntiRadiation Missiles, all missiles would require sensor assistance for 
control guidance to target.

3.  Point Defense Weapons
Like Sensors, I altered the USP to support Point Defense batteries.  These 
batteries were low-powerd lasers that lacked the range to acck other starships, 
but could be used to attack incoming missiles or fighters.  The advantage to 
these weapons was that the batteries fired twice in defense: once during the 
normal defensive fire portion of combat, and once as a "second chance" when a 
successful hit was scored by a missile.  The PD Lasers could also fire on 
nearby fighters at the end of movement.  And best of all for the bloodthirsty, 
the PD lasers made excellent antipersonnel weapons while the ship was in port.  
These lasers had the same characteristics as the standard lasers.

4.  Computers
I added volume differentiation by tech level to computers (Yes, you can have a 
TL6 Model 9 computer, but its Megahuge).  I assumed that the Computer included 
other controls and communications gear, so I was not overly bothered by some of 
the volume restrictions, but I did feel that volume could be sacrificed to get 
desired computer technology earlier.  One thing I did do was largely do away 
with Computer Programs.  They really did not seem to add much to the game.  
However, I see no reason why software cannot be left in the game for those 
people who like that sort of thing.

In General
I am very hopeful that at some point in the future an effort is made to provide 
FF&S-like design rules for the various starship and vehicle subsystems, which 
produce results consistent with your "Base-Level" starship rules.  I thought 
High Guard design was an order of magnitude better than Book 2 Design, and I 
thought that FF&S/Brilliant Lances was an order of magnitude better than High 
Guard.  I really liked the details given by FF&S, but I do appreciate the 
ease-of-use from High Guard.  Being greedya nd self-centered, I want the best 
of both worlds.  So hop to it!  I\'m part of the Instant Gratification 
Generation, after all, and I want to be gratified instantly.

Sreiously, though, I do wish you the best of luck Don & Co..  As you\'ve no 
doubt noticed, there are lots of opinions around here, and they only rarely 
agree with what you want to do at any given time.  Basically, I\'ll prbably do 
something similar to what I noted above whether its in T4 or not.  That\'s not 
going to stop me from buying T4, or using a lot of other T4 rules.  I was happy 
enough with the TNE rules, but I\'m fairly flexible.

Does your statement about TL9 & 10 cultures have the underlying
assumption
that the pay scale for these crew would be comparable to "modern"
(Year 0)
levels?  Would this assumption apply to fascist governments, or true
altruistic
socialist states?  Or privateers/pirates/slave-traders?  Or does it
only apply
to profit-motivated corporate types?  There are other reasons than the
almighty
Cr to go into space, and we\'re lead to believe that a modicum of space
travel
did continue...  (Drake\'s _Igniting the Reaches_ has a good example of
the
privateer model, and exemplifies your crew levels theory, although it
does lack
in technical matters.)

Question:  Has anyone else theorized why the Long Night was less
traumatic
for the infrastructure than the Collapse (other than Virus)?  Given
the length of
the Long Night, wouldn\'t the majority of the "uninhabitables"
collapse?  OR
(my theory) was manufacturing of "high tech" components less
decentralized, 
less specialized, with individuals worlds being more self-sufficient? 
*Wow*,
just looked up the Long Night in my trusty Imperial Encyclopedia... 
1,776 years
of \'anarchy\', longer than the whole of the Third Imperium...  And the
Pacification
Campaigns only lasted 50+ years, assuming the Imperium was fully
integrated
at that time...

If the latter is the case, which influence later centralized things? 
Increasing tech
complexity?  Vilani bureaucracy?  Megacorporation streamlining for
efficiency?

Curiousity:  Has anybody out there run a generation-ship campaign?

Personal question, Joseph:  do you use the GURPS rules for Traveller?

        Star Frontiers, also by TSR wasn\'t the most realistic of game
systems. It was simple enough but the popularity of Traveller must have
drowned it out (unless someone knows the facts). The starship design was
very simple and the starship combat although extremely simple. Ships had
data sheets showing maneuverability rating, acceleration/deceleration
factor, hull points, weapons and defences. It was enjoyable back in 1981 or
whenever but far too simple for consumption by Sci-Fi RPG gamers these days. 
        At the other end of the scale is FF&S and the Brilliant Lances
starship combat system. IMHO FF&S and BL are ok although i\'m personally not
keen on the vector based movement system (however realistic it is). Neither
am i keen on the simplicity of High Guard which does not use a map of any
kind at all and does not aid visualisation of whats going on very well. In
some ways my own opinion is of little consequence. I\'m the GM for a group
numbering up to about 6 players although 3 is the standard turn out in
addition to myself. They have become extremely turned off to Traveller
especially in the case of BL. None of them own any Traveller material at all
(however much i might have suggested purchasing some), and they don\'t want
to sit down and with FF&S and follow The Way Of The Gearhead. BL seems to be
their ultimate gaming nightmare. Starship combats using BL _always_
degenerate into a case of "Oh we can\'t be bothered with this", and i tend to
agree with them. We know that the BL portion could completely consume the
game session. Calls for playing Call of Cthulhu go out and Traveller goes
back on the shelf. Enthusiasm for a system must work both ways. Rob
Miracle\'s posts indicates that he knows what sort of thing i\'m talking about.

I\'m not a gearhead myself, but i did persevere with FF&S and created a
number of designs. Looking back at them i realise how bad conceptually they
were but thats because of a lack of reference to gauge what is a good armour
value etc when designing vehicles. The tanks i created were, well made of
cardboard in comparison to those in the Regency Vehicle book. But i digress.

Not everyone wants FF&S but i suspect fewer want to go back to CT/MT. Can
some sort of compromise be reached. FF&S lite seems a highly popular option.
Don Perrin must have been reading the volume of posts concerned with this
important area of Traveller. The question is, whats going to be done about
it? Anything at all? Comments please Mr Perrin or anyone else?

One more thing, whatever the outcome of the starship design sequence, be it
too simple or too technical, please make sure starship combat uses a hex map
of some kind and is actually fun and easy to play. When play testing, see if
the game works well when the players have not read the rule book.

This seems like a sensible request. Are we certain, however, that this IS
NOT  the way the rules are being designed? from the statements I have
seen, I can not rule out the possibility.

Why not contact Imperium directly on the feasabilty of having an expansion
similar to FF&S? I could see the HG rules being used for refs who like
games played with mainly role playing, and a FF&S style supplement for
those who are primarily interested in war gaming, or who just have a lot
of time for design.

Can you make a valid comparison? Swedish subs are designed primarily for
coastal patrol purposes, with short "at sea" rotations; the 688 sub used
for the math is designed to be, if neccesary, Submerged continually for 6+
months.

pointed out.  Their trip times are measured in hours rather than
the days to weeks of a starship (or submarine), they operate in
a generally less hostile environment to their passengers and crew,
and they rely on far more extensive post-flight maintenance and
overhaul than the starships Traveller postulates.  (Subs, on the
other hand, would likely receive a dry-dock overhaul, I\'d guess,
every four or five years or so, if they\'re anything like the Navy
surface vessels my father used to captain).

I should point out that the Los Angeles is an ATTACK sumbarine, not a 
ballistic missile submarine.  The OHIO class (of ballistic missile 
submarines) displace 18,700 tons of seawater (or 1,202 Traveller
tons, a bit over an Xboat tender.  But those ain\'t Xboats in them
there bays....  :-)  It carries a complement of 154, giving a "crew
ratio" of 0.128 crew per Traveller ton, or about 40% of the ratio
for the Los Angeles.  So much for the claim that such subs are
over-manned to reduce the risk of accidental launches....  We could
argue that the Ohio represents the "next tech level" of command and
control systems (in which case I might grudgingly have to accept a 60%!
reduction rate, maybe tapering off as tech levels continue to increase),
though I\'d consider it far more appropriate to treat the Ohio as
closer to a cargo-carrying merchant vessel which tries to _avoid_
combat rather than the conflict-seeking, other-sub-killing Los
Angeles vessels.  Remember, I was ready to grant those a half to
two-thirds "discount" on crew levels.

I\'d take the Seawolf attack subs as a more likely candidate for a higher-
tech system.  They displace 9,130 tons (587 Trav tons) and carry 133 crew,
for a ratio of 0.227 crew/ton, a 30% reduction from the Los Angeles.  There,
I\'m handing you ammunition for a higher fall-off rate.  :-)  If you\'d
like to further argue that many of the command & control systems on
our subs may more resemble TL6 (circa 1950) more than the full potential
of TL7 (circa 1970) (an assumption I\'m not quite prepared to make), you
could get another unit added to the exponent for the rough, back-of-the-
envelope hand-wavings we\'re dealing with here.

But in the mean time, my argument still stands: that ideally, realistically,
AND more entertainingly for role-play and conjecture, crew sizes in 
Traveller should vary by tech level and ship function.  I know there\'s
a great desire to simplify rules for the beginning market, but now is
also the time to be considering the variants to appear in the advanced
system.

For what it\'s worth, I rather like Mr. Golden\'s system of skeleton vs.
duty shifts, etc..  It assigns easy-to-understand words to the numbers,
and gives referees a fair amount of hand-waving freedom.  The basic
rules for the system would assume standard, civilian crewing (and if
military vessels were presented, crew numbers might be higher with
an explanation as to why: new referees could interpolate to get rough
values for ships they created using the basic rules, then polish them
up when the actual "advanced" rules arrived).  Dave, do you want to
toss around a few ideas off-list and then report back with any results?

A pleasant change, I must admit.  Thanks for being more thought-provoking

Fascist governments are probably unlikely to want to expand on an 
interstellar level in Traveller: the communications lag makes rigid
control impractical.  Socialist states I can\'t comment on, not knowing
the technical basis on which they\'d operate and survive (Traveller,
perhaps short-sightedly, seems to assume mostly Western-capitalist-style
societies among the humans of the 58th century).

Pirates and slavers seem a much more likely prospect (recall the Reavers
of Reavers\' Deep, so-called only because they hung on there longer than
anywhere else as the Long Night drew to a close).  I\'d also accept family-
based "space gypsies" a la TNE\'s Free Traders, who would wander as much
as part of life as in quest of profit.

> (Drake\'s _Igniting the Reaches_ has a good example

I\'ve been meaning to read that one.  I hear it\'s quite Traveller-esque.
Is the new sequel any good?  A quick flip-check suggested it got rather
space-opera-ish... more so than most of the Traveller material I like.

The Long Night didn\'t destroy as much infrastructure precisely because it
lacked Virus, which tended (in suicide strains), to take just about any
available technological items along with itself to destruction.  I suspect
many marginal planets did perish, which is why exploration, colonization,
and unification were able to proceed so quickly.  (Recall, the Imperium
reached its current size by, what, 400 or so?  That\'s pretty quick!)

Recall, also, that the tech level spectrum was probably "flatter" in the
First and Second Imperia.  The maximum was 12 or 13, I guess, and I strongly
suspect that Vilani expansion towards Terra was stretched fairly thin,
extending only to habitable worlds and strong bases around captive cultures.
(About the only way to justify the odd growth of the Ziru Sirkaa is that
one of the bureaux had to assimilate more alien cultures than the others,
and thus was forced to extend further and faster in spite of natural 
Vilani conservatism.  Otherwise why not hop right from Vland through 
Corridor to our favorite hang-out in the Spinward Marches?  It\'s far
closer than the Solomani Rim, and just about as rich in potential).  So, 
yes, the population was probably concentrated in high-tech centers which 
could survive to eke out a more stable economy and eventual independent 
expansion.  At least, that\'s my take on things.  We\'ll see what Marc 
Miller has in store by December.  :-)

> Pacification Campaigns only lasted 50+ years, assuming the Imperium was 
> fully integrated at that time...

>From what I recall (I can look up references if you like), the Imperium
expanded around and past resistant cultures and worlds, so the Pacification
Campaigns were, in many places, more "mopping up" and unification efforts
than out-out-out extension of frontiers.  (The latter sparked the Julian
War, which was a resounding failure for the Imperium....)

> If the latter is the case, which influence later centralized things? 
> Increasing tech complexity?  Vilani bureaucracy?  Megacorporation

We know Solomani interests declined at court, particularly after Zhakirov\'s
rebellious marriage.  And the "canon" history does seem to indicate a sort
of Vilani renaissance (culminating in the Restored Ziru Sirka of the 
Rebellion).  So, if I had to speculate in HIWG-ish terms, I\'d put my
money on the second of your choices.

> Personal question, Joseph:  do you use the GURPS rules for Traveller?

Alas, I\'ve never been able to _run_ GURPS:Traveller....  My group rotates
refereeing as well as campaigns, and there\'s been such clamor for my Roman
Fantasy setting (or the occasional excursion into Golden Age Supers or
Cthulhoid Horror), that I haven\'t yet been able to stake out a slot for
a Space campaign.  But my Interstellar Wars setting continues to gestate...
One of these days....  David Summers, on both this list and the GURPS one,
has created some rules for GURPS:Traveller.  I believe they\'re available
on the ftp.io.com site, in a fairly-findable directory.

A splendid topic, and just as relevant to the upcoming revival of Traveller
as these heated debates on starship construction.  Anyone for further
discussion of the Long Night?

Apparently this is not true. If HG is so much different than FF&S, then
FF&S should not have been made (it doesn\'t fit with the ships designed in
HG). I\'m looking at FF&S Light (still undeveloped) and FF&S/Brilliant
Lances Technical Booklet, and it is cumbersome and very
non-role-playing-inducive.

I\'m struggling on this issue, and must keep in mind the stated goal of
Imperium Games. We are to provide a role playing experience that is based
on Classic Traveller, and set in the environs of Year 0. The combat system
cannot be hex based (otherwise it\'s a board game, not a role playing game,
and won\'t be at all suitable for inclusion in a book) and should be
something that a referee and players can handle in less than half an hour
to further their role playing experience.

The combat system, and some pre-generated ships will show in the main book.
The Ships book will contain the ship building system (basic) and some stock
ships, some with deck plans (to aid in role playing adventures).

If I do decide to go with a High Guard system, then I think it would be
fair to expect an FF&S system in a future expansion, along with a more
detailed hex based combat replacement. As was pointed out, Traveller is
nothing if not modular. If you don\'t like the basic system, then replace it
later with our advanced system, or, in the meantime, with FF&S/Brilliant
Lances.

For those who have offered to help me with the ship designs, please hold
off for a very short while until I am finished grappling with these issues.
I should have an answer for you Monday. Thank you to all the comments. They
have helped modify and improve what I\'m doing, regardless of the path. Your
input has been invaluable.

I\'ll get back to you.

Cheers!

The real problem is scaling some "real" number to HG "factors."  The
only reason that this is a problem is that so much stuff is folded into
HG factors.  It\'s in no way insurmountable, though.

I can see that point, but it might be nice to make the abstract system
(HG) have at least some indication of more complicated range bands than
"short" and "long."  If the distances are given (as in book2, for
example) then conversion to a hex map is simple for anybody with mayday,
BL, or BR (or starfire, triplanetary, etc.).  Bashing a hex game from an
absract system is easy if you have scale.

First I would like to say that I am very glad that Mr. Wiseman, Mr. Miller, 
Mr. Perrin, and many others officially involved (past or present) in 
Traveller have begun to be more active on this list.  It is very 
enlightening to read what they have to say.  Thank you!

I too shudder at the idea of going back to Book 2/5 design sequences.  In my 
opinion, it\'s a great leap backward.  I agree that there should be a simple 
system based on a complex one, with both being available for use.  I\'m happy 
to see that Mr. Perrin is interested in FF&S Lite!

Now, what I really wanted to say was:

Since TNE is not being supported officially for at least a very long time to 
come, would it be possible for the people who thought up the Empress Wave 
and Black Curtain to fill us in on what they had in store for these things? 
 I would really like to know what the plans were and so on, so please share 
that information with us.  Please!

That\'s the best thing about Traveller:  it\'s the setting, not the rules that

at one stage about using RoleMaster/Spacemaster to play a couple of

My solution was to let robots replace crewmembers, but to give them (robots)

terms, ships with robots had their initiative severely crippled in combat,
and had negative modifiers for all emergency tasks.

This seemed to work satisfactorily.  A merchant on a safe, fixed route could
save money by using robots.  One in the Marches, with the possibility of
Vargr corsairs, or a tramp trader refueling at gas giants, would be better
off with expensive but flexible sapients.

I don\'t think commmand and control reasons really affect crew size that much -
- - there are only three or four officers on a US boomer with launch keys, so 
even if you wanted each key to have two officers (primary and backup), that\'s 
only six bodies.

A much bigger factor is that trained crew can fix broken machines, but 
machines can\'t fix broken machines.  Russian/XSSR subs are more highly 
automated, and have crews that are up to one-third smaller than an equivalent-
sized US sub.  The USN has always believed that the greater the level of 
complexity, the more problems you will have.  The number of Russian/Soviet 
subs lost over the past three decades (I can think of at least three off the 
top of my head) versus the number of US subs lost (the last one lost was USS 
Scorpion, in 1968) seems to support the point, although I will be the first to 
admit there are a lot of other factors involved.

NASA once reached the same conclusion: it did a study in the 1960s on manned 
vs unmanned spaceflight, that concluded that people are the only self-
programming, self-maintaining computer capable of being created using low tech 
means.

Jerry Pournelle wrote an essay entitled "Building the _Mote in God\'s Eye_" 
that made this exact point.  The original opening chapter of _Mote_ included a 
space battle between an automated rebel cruiser and a fully-manned Imperial 
warship.  Before the battle, the rebel captain laments that moral was low 
because his crew was bored.

Airliners aren\'t in the air constantly -- they stop at places were people 
service them and they change crews.  Imagine them minimum crew size of a 747 
if it (1) carried the maintenance crew withit, and (2) was in the air 
continuously for months at a time.  I suspect the normal crew (flight plus 
attendants) for a 747 is around 10; in the above scenario, it would probably 
be closer to 40.

complain that FFS takes some of the fun out of ROLE-playing

But FFS is not a player aid to the game, it is a clear Referee
supplement to design no-standard ships, vehicles and equipment,
so that every refree has the oppertunity to make his/her gameworld
uniqe. Every group can of course play with only the ships that
IG designs, but some of the referees out here need a supplement
that details the designing of ships to fit the rules of starship
combat. If this is not available the diversity of the game is 
prohibited by the stuff IG gives out.

Therefor I\'m disapponted that IG decides to go with a system of
combat that has no clear designsequence for the ships that is
to participate under these rules. Why not use the FFS rules, a
good TRAVELLER-Referee supplement, and build on this. This gives
the referees of the game the oppertunity to make good and detailed
ships that is needed in a "hard science" rpg. 

But I also feel that FFS fills another void. A void that the basic
rulebook ahs no way of filling. How does equipment (sensors, lasers,
missiles really work). FFS gives detailed descriptions of alot 
of the stuff the players are bound to ask. "Can I do this with 
this sensor?" and so on. 

Well, I have to stop now before my frustrations take over.

I\'m all for it.  I\'d like it if IG introduced a milieux book based on it, 
as it would be an exciting time to play in.  The canon is that some 
worlds never really knew what happened - ships just stopped coming.  The 
onset of the Long Night would be a great starting point for a campaign.

Of course, Milieux 0 will be equally exciting, since it presents the 
opposite scenario.  Some worlds will be happy to see the renewed expansion 
of trade, while others (quite likely those groups of worlds under one 
rulership - pocket empires) will resist.  

Getting back to the Long Night, not much has been written about it.  I 
have always taken the obvious path of likening it to the dark ages that 
followed the collapse of the Roman empire.  People progressively lose 
technological know-how, yet the technological artifacts of the previous 
age remain.  Economies that were propped up by the empire fall to pieces, 
and the people suffer because of it.  

I probably have some incorrect ideas about the Long Night since I am not 
an expert in the collapse of empires.  I\'d like to hear the opinions of 
those who studied the dark ages.  What does history tell us about what 
probably occurred during the Long Night?

A few things that would be nice to see...

1.  Explicit mention of what the drive tech is someplace.  

2.  If sensor rules aren\'t detailed in the first stuff out, how about at
least the Book2 detection ranges, etc. 

3.  When doing the travel tables (in-system) it\'d be nice if ships had
limited delta v, even with thruster plates.  Even if it\'s very high, it
would really help to suspend disbelief since every lifeboat won\'t be a
planet killer.

4.  More clear-cut examples of ship configurations would be really nice.

5.  The old list of upcoming stuff shows small craft design as a
separate title.  This is silly, IMHO.  A book of small craft would be
cool.  Having this book include rules for alternate sublight drives
would be cool (hey, Milieux 0 will have more low-tech races being
found).  But having a separate design system for craft that differ only
by not having J-drive makes no sense.

Not a complete list, but worth throwing out there.

I know Don was just saying the first books won\'t have a "board game"
system, but a more abstract system can still be played out on hex paper
if at least something like the Book2 rules are given for movement.  We
almost always (in CT) did a Mayday/HG hybrid using hex paper instead of
a map and counters.  It is simple to keep track of, and gives a nice
hard copy of they ship-ship interaction.  As a ref, and as a player I
really liked the sense of scale it gave (draw a planet on the hex paper
if it applies and the scale makes sense).

I\'d suggest that in place of a Book2 system of playing it out on the
floor, use similar rules, but suggest using hex paper.  It would eat up
any more space than the Book2 rules did, and people would actually use
it (I did use the Book2 rules for a long time, actually :-)

I\'m afraid, you\'re wrong here, Andrew. There are people (like me) who prefer
a simple and easy to use system. I\'m not sure, which group is the larger one
at this list but I believe that most gamers would be more attracted by the
easier rules.

I don\'t see ship design as an end in itself. I put my emphasis on role
playing characters. For me, I expect some answers on the following question. 

How long does it take to go from A to B? What are the costs for that? How
difficult is it to reach the destination (measured in skill rolls)? How
large is the crew (minimum and best)? What\'s the vessels capacity? What\'s
its combat value? What\'s its picture? What\'s its price?

That\'s all, a ship design system needs to answer. I\'ve no need for further
details. Eventually, I can come up with them without rules if they\'re needed.

I never managed to build a ship sucessfully with the FF&S rules but with CT
it a matter of half an hour or less. Well, I don\'t think the old rules are
perfect. In fact, there\'re a couple of things I would like to change, but
they are a better starting point than FF&S IMHO.

It\'s a problem with Traveller since the beginning. I wouldn\'t even allocate
space for a computer because it should always fit into the bridge.

>I\'d rather have *NO* ship design system in the main rules (with FF&S Mk2

I found TNE very incomplete without the ship design system. Otherwise, 
with the same argument you could leave out the world design or even the
character design (simply supply 30 ready-to-run character in the basic rules :-)

Nobody\'s forcing you to do anything. If there are enough pre-generated

It *can* be useful to know: that your ship has longer-range sensors (or
weapons) than your opponent; how long your fuel will last; if you can use
your ship\'s power plant to power external equipment, and still keep
life-support running; etc etc

I agree that we need a simpler combat system, so as not to slow the *game*

A lot of people here never had them, since they began with MT or TNE.
Others (like myself) dumped them when something better (ie MT) came along.

When I used HG as shipdesign system way back I always figured computer volume
was for the computer(s), sensors in the ship for stresses, temperature etc
and most importantly external sensors of the ship. I also ruled that
fighters (and other ships as well) could use another ships computer/sensors
given that it was within a certain range from the other ship. This gave
neat effects as Luke Skyrunner shot down the main commo dish on Faders
capital ship making the huge fighter armada blind and useless.

The powerplant fuel is mostly for cooling. Extract the tiny amount of

The reason why fusion guns are useless as spaceweaponry is not their speed

I know I\'m going to get flamed for this but what the heck...  

This has always been my argument against FF&S.  We really don\'t 
know if meson guns, lasers, j-drives, etc, will ever exist or work as they are 
described in any version of the game, so why get so excited about 
designing fictional vehicles down to the last nut and bolt.  Give me 
something quick, clean, that captures the feel of what space combat 
MIGHT be like, because let\'s face it, none of us will be alive to 
ever experience what it will REALLY be like, if it ever happens...

While I may not like FF&S, I have no problem with IG designing 
something more complex for the gearheads, as long as the end results 
in design are compatible...

That\'s the way I looked at it to.  I figured "computer" in HG/B2 must
mean "electronics."  Given that computers have so many uses other than
running starships, I\'d suggest making a new list of computers that are
cheaper and smaller, and just make an electronics suite that would fill
the place of the old HG "computers" when describing old designs.

I agree with this arguement, but I\'d rather see a _combat_ rule that
penalizes trying to shoot more than 1 spinal mount during a turn (time
interval, whatever).  Then the old HG rule is really just a very
accurate "rule of thumb."  A subtle difference, but easier to make sense
of.

At what point does a fusion/plasma gun get called a C-PAW?  I\'d assume
when the plasma gets relativistic.  At least having an energy weapon
slot in the USP leaves room for some other kind of weapon to get bashed
in :-)

Yeah!  Another subtle difference, but it makes sense that such "1 per
100 tons" rules are just good rules of thumb.  Why would the Zhodani
have the exact same limit as the Imperials (or the Hivers, or Aslan,
etc.)?  Even if the rule was just rephrased to express this it\'d make
more sense when detailed add on rules are published.

A lot of the physics was not perfect, but I like the attempt to
charaterize the physics of the technology a little.  Of course a lot of
my favorite science fiction involves technology/physics and interesting
results of such.  It doesn\'t have to be as detailed as FFS, but *some*
detail (in the background now, to be published later, hopefully) would
be nice.

Another point is that the published history includes wars fought with
this tech----and the tech _described_ doesn\'t always mesh with what works
best using HG.  Since the background is one of traveller\'s best points,
it would be nice if fundamental rules don\'t make us scratch our heads
when we read background (see lasers in TNE rules vs. published use as a
recent example).

bit different.  I\'ve only lived here for a few years, so I don\'t have the 
advantage I would if I were still in northern CA, where I grew up.

In addition, where I live (northeastern Illinois), there aren\'t a whole 
lot of RPG stores (Games+ is the only one I know of in Lake County).  
There\'s Gamers\' Paradise, but they seem to be concentrating on videogames, 
puzzles, board games, and other non-RPG stuff.  Plus, their RPG section 
leaves much to be desired.  Take out the AD&D stuff and the Games 
Workshop stuff, and you don\'t have much left.  This is even more true of 
the area comic book shops.  They carry AD&D and a few White Wolf 
products, and that\'s about it.  

Given that, how in the heck is Traveller going to gain a wide audience 
around here?  I can\'t go to these stores and tell them all that I want 
them to carry T4 because I\'ll buy it from them - I\'m not going to lie to 
get them to carry the game.  I can go there and talk to them about this 
great new/old game that is coming out, but from the existing product 
selection, I have doubts that would be effective.

I am sure that Games+ will carry it (they carry everything - even a 
surprising amount of out-of-print stuff).  Gamers\' Paradise is a chain, 
so I don\'t think working on them would do much good.  I think the best 
chance lies with the independently owned comic book shops.  Perhaps I 
should just go in and talk to the owner, eh?  I don\'t know these people, 
though.  Are they going to listen to me?

Is anyone else in a situation similar to mine?  What are your plans?  Any 
recommendations?

        Unfortunately, there isn\'t a finished FF&S Light product. It\'s
something that has been batted around on the Traveller and GDW-Beta lists
for a while, and I have a draft outline published on my Web pages at 

http://www.usa.net/~goldendj/Traveller/Admiralty/FFSLight/FFSLight.html

I can zip that up and email it to you, in HTML format.


Also, because of my vocal support for the idea, somebody (I can\'t find the
original message) challenged me to develop it and make an unsolicited
proposal to you. I\'ve already started on that. If you _are_ interested, I\'ve
already had some ideas on improving what\'s I\'ve published, and with inputs
from the Traveller and GDW-Beta lists I\'m willing to bet we could have
something available within a week. I can take some leave and spend much of
my time working on this (I\'m already scheduled to be off the week after this).

SUMMARY
- ----

The basic idea behind FF&S Light was this: While the full design rules given
in FF&S are very powerful, some folks don\'t want to have to design each and
every system -- maneuver drives, jump drives, power plants, weapons --
they\'re putting into a starship. Furthermore, we felt that manufacturers
would have "prebuilt" major systems. ("The AstroTech model XVI Jump Drive!
Provides Jump-2 when installed in a 100Ton hull, or Jump-1 in a 150Ton
hull!"). If we were to take the rules, and provide predesigned components
that could be plugged in, a casual user could bang out a design in minutes.

The downside would be that the design would not be fully "optimized." For
example, if the design require 78.7MW of power (or 78.7 Power Points for
those who feel uncomfortable using Megawatts), and the closest available
predesigned power plant was 85MW, the ship would have a little less free
space than one with a custom-designed power plant.

>From the play point of view, this provides some distinction and variation in
otherwise "similar" designs. One is custom-built to the customer\'s specs,
and costs more. The other is built from "standard" components, isn\'t
perfect, but costs less (because the builder just runs down to the warehouse
and pulls something off the stack).

Another benefit of this is the one many "gearheads" like -- the casual user
gets an easy system. Gearheads can go into more detail, handcrafting ships,
and they are fully compatible with each other playwise. And you can slip
into "gearhead" slowly. If you don\'t want to waste the space for the 85MW
power plant, but you\'re satisfied with the rest of the design, you can
design _just_ the powerplant in detail.

>From your point of view, it also gives you something more to publish in
magazines or supplements: additional predesigned components to expand the
basic system.

Finally, while I (and everybody else) has been referring to it as FF&S
Light, doesn\'t mean we claim FF&S is the be-all and end-all of design
systems. Gearheads want that level of detail, and FF&S provides a good
starting point. But if you want to tinker with the FF&S rules to create a
new advanced system, and then abstract it to the basic system, that\'s fine.
The benefit of sticking with an FF&S-derived system is threefold: 

        [1] You don\'t have to create the advanced system from scratch (and
you need the advanced to generate a good basic system). This saves you mucho
time in preparing for publication of the rules.
        [2] Many people are familiar with FF&S already, and can help design
and playtest modifications. 
        [3] There are a huge heap of predesigned vehicles and spacecraft out
there, that would only need minor tweaking to comply with any changes. This
saves you time towards publication as well.

My offer stands: I will provide as much help as possible in getting this off
the ground. If you\'d like to talk to me personally, I can e-mail you my
voice phone number. I\'m not asking anything in return.

I think you\'ll find a fair number of highly creative and talented people
willing to make the same offer.

I don\'t have any CT material (Except Adventure 2: Research Station Gamma),
so I can\'t comment on the quality of the High Guard design system, but I
believe you\'ve answered almost everyones concerns here.  I think the simple
system is necessary for the beginning to be included with your supplements
release.  When I started in MT, I never could bring myself to buy any of the
pre-designed ship/vehicle books for the simple fact that I already had the
design system and a dozen ships/vehicles in the basic rules.  Including the
basic system in the core rules is a must.

I also believe that your idea to do a FF&S system in the future is a must.
I was thrilled with FF&S.  The reading and formula deciphering was a bit
tough, but the overall concept was terrific.  I\'m upset that we can\'t get
this type of supplement sooner, but then again I understand the publishing
constraints you guys face.  I think the biggest point that you need to
concentrate on is making sure that:

        1. Your basic book is as flawless as it can possibly be.  As has
been pointed out before, MT as well as other Trav products suffered heavily
from the misprints and editing problems.  Make sure your book (and all the
other Trav products) are error free (or as close as possible).

        2. Make triple sure that your future FF&S system is backwards
compatable(sp?).  This is really the only issue, I think, that you haven\'t
addressed, and, consequently the biggest worry from most of us here.  No
matter how simple your initial system is, I think the future, more detailed
system needs to be compatable with it.  In other words, the official
Imperium Scout/Courrier published in your first book... I should be able to
design it with the simple system you include with that book as well as with
any other, more detailed system you publish in the future.

These two issues are, IMHO, the most pressing.

I would love to help with the design of some of these ships, but I have no
access to the HG design system.  If you have some way that I can get access
to this system, I\'d love to help you wherever you need the help.

        If you start out with the basic system, and then try to graft on a
more detailed system, you\'re going to have trouble with the compatibility.
The proposed rules are the perfect example: Design a starship with Book 2,
and then create the same ship with HG.

        I have, and that\'s what I expect they\'re already planning anyway.
But like I said, I think the advanced rules have to be developed first, and
then abstracted to the basic rules.

        Call it Megawatts like FF&S does, call it Power Points like High
Guard does, it doesn\'t matter. Either is just a way of rating the output of
generators and the needs of other systems.

        Well, I did some thinking while I was up in the mountains last night
(great time, until this miserable cold moved from the back of my throat to
the rest of my body). Here\'s what I\'m visualizing now:

        1. Each system has a basic "Crew Factor" associated with it. This is
the number of skilled bodies needed to routinely operate the system, monitor
its behavior, identify problems, etc. This would be a "minimally" automated
system (for that TL).

        2. Automation can reduce the crew required significantly. The level
of automation would be a simple multiplier. Add up all the crew factors,
multiply by the automation factor, and that\'s the number of people you need
to run the system at one time.

        3. Some systems don\'t need full-time crewing: weapons, for example.
Others do. The ones that do would need enough personnel for shifts. There
might be a variance here among races, too. Perhaps human ships carry three
shifts, working 8 hours on, 16 hours off. Aslan might carry two, working 10
and 10 (or some such).

        4. Crews would still be broken up by specialty: Engineering,
Maneuver, Gunnery, Medical, Flight, Electronics, etc., etc.

        5. Systems that aren\'t properly crewed can reduce the efficiency of
the ship.

        This still needs more work. If the whole list isn\'t highly
interested in this, perhaps you (and anybody else) would like to hold an
e-mail discussion and just bring back the results?

        Cheers indeed! To be honest, I had the half-formed opinion I (and
others) was just blowing into the wind with our comments, that the decision
to go with CT/HG wasn\'t one to be reconsidered lightly. The fact that you
are at least thinking about it is very, very heartening, even if you decide
to continue that way.

        The ease of integrating FF&S into T4 is my concern. One of the
reasons I\'m so hot about getting compatible, scaleable rules into T4 is so
everybody can exchange designs. But if I\'m using FF&S & somebody else is
using a slightly different version of FF&S and somebody else is using CT/HG,
that becomes more difficult. Looking back over the TML, and looking at my
Web pages and others\', the two most popular things for sharing are Ships,
Ships, and occasionally adventure ideas or equipment.

        I\'d be interested in how you see expanding CT/HG design rules into a
*compatible* detailed set. Especially since CT and HG are themselves
somewhat inconsistent to my eyes. At least, from memory. It\'s been years,
but I do remember trying to duplicate CT designs with HG (so I could draw
deckplans), and not getting the same results ...

        The question I suspect they\'re facing is _which_ customer is right:
those who could care less about the physics of lasers at space combat
ranges, or those who start talking about Planck\'s Constant when arguing
about sensor performance. Face it, T4 _has_ to attract new customers to
survive. Many of those customers will be from the "MTV/Nintendo" group who
wouldn\'t understand why spacecraft move differently than airplanes anyway.
And there are the existing fans who are concentrating much more on the
"feel" of the game than the details. I think you can satisfy all of them
with the right system.

I have a similar problem.  I live in South Mississippi.  Down here all we
have are a few stores and even fewer gamers.  I\'ve had a notice up in the
main RPG store down here for three weeks trying to get an RPG group going,
but no one has responded yet.  Most of the folks down here can\'t think about
anything more than the beach, the horse, or the auto races.  Redneck heaven. :)

I went in (before IG began taking part on the list) and asked both of the
two main shops down here if they had any promo literature on the New
Traveller.  The response, in both cases:  "Oh, you haven\'t heard that GDW,
the company that makes Traveller, went out of business.?"

I explained to both of them that IG and Marc had gained the rights and were
promising that Trav would not die, but all I got out of either of them was a
slightly raised eyebrow (over a glazed eye) and a non-committal grunt of
"Oh."  I\'m all for helping T4 (sorry Canadians, read that MMT) succeed, but
I\'m like you, only I think I\'m worse. IIRC you at least have a current
gaming group.  I, on the other hand, spend my Trav time coming up with great
adventure ideas, but never write them out cause I have no group (sniff,
sniff).  I\'ve been working off and on on a book since we moved down here,
but even there I\'ve run into problems (mainly the putting off of the TNE era).

I\'m going to do the only thing I know to do.  I\'m going to go in to both of
the stores and ask them to carry the new Trav.  And when it comes out, and
I\'ve had a bit of time to learn the system, I\'m going to seek out a playing
group more actively.  Hopefully this will spread the fires a bit, but I\'m
not too sure.

    'body' => 'About six years ago I ran the MegaTraveller Referees\' Exchange, providing
at-cost copies of source material from my library (and waiving charges in
exchange for material).

I discovered that there were a few prolific designers out there, but that
most referees just wanted to get some predesigned equipment (or worlds, or
adventures, or...).

The most popular ships were commonly encountered types, well-designed, had
vivid descriptions, and exterior drawings and/or deckplans.   (Strangely,
ships designed with varient rules weren\'t popular, even when they had cool
deckplans and good descriptions.)  

This is probably painfully self-evident to Imperium Games (being
professionals and all that) but it was a surprise to me.  After all, my
players loved getting into the guts of everything.  (When was the last time
you had a player start working out black-body calculations to prove a point
about sensor performance?  Or do an energy analysis of a planetary ecosystem
to show that that large carnivore attacking her needed more nutrition than
the occassional traveller to survive?)

Anyway, the obvious solution to the \'which system\' debate is for someone to
use FF&S (or something similar) to create the basic CT-style ship components.
 Of course, these will have to be over-engineered a bit so that they always
work together, but that shouldn\'t be a problem to someone that knows FF&S. 
These basic components, and the rules to use them, would be included in the
basic T4 book, along with a storytelling-style combat resolution system.

The full FF&S-style design system, included alternate technologies, could
then be released later but would be totally compatible with the basic system.
 If IG decides that the FF&S market is too small, they could publish the
system in JTAS.

To stop a custom-designed ship from having all the advantages over one built
of standard modules, I would rule (in my game) that non-standard modules
require special construction at a starport, and thus repairs to a custom ship
cost _lots_ more.  So the hotshot engineer can customize the group\'s
merchant, but then she\'ll spend a lot of time tinkering with the engines -
which makes for great adventure hooks.  


I think a tactical space game is, at some point, essential.  Of all the
systems (Book 2, Mayday, High Guard, MT, TNE, BL, and BR) I preferred
Brilliant Lances, once I figured the rules out.  (Very poorly explained, but
they do make sense eventually).  I think this was mainly because I was always
having to make trade-off decisions (when to go active, when to burn...), and
also because the feel was more realistic (especially facing affecting what
systems get damaged, and damage working its way inside past armour).  

However, even though I like playing Brilliant Lances (with miniatures of
course) I wouldn\'t use it if I had more than a couple of ships to control. 
Too many decisions at that level.  Battle Rider seems to do that job OK, but
I haven\'t had enough experience to offer a firm opinion.   I do like the way
Brilliant Lances and Battle Rider seem to get the same resolutions - but
again I haven\'t tested that thoroughly.

In general, I think we will need/evolve three levels of combat system:

(a) A simple storytelling system giving vivid descriptions and quick results.
(b) A boardgame-style system for playing out the conflict.
(c) A detailed boardgame/miniatures ruleset for those who want to fight in
detail.

Ideally, all of these should fit together, but only the simplest needs to be
in the basic game.

One of the ideas I\'ve been playing with is creating a flowchart for a battle,
much like the one in JTAS #3 for asteroid mining.  At each step the players
would make a simple choice, and that choice plus a dice throw would dictate
what happened next.  I\'d probably need a way of creating a unique flowchart
for each battle, as well as a library of vivid descriptions to spice it up. 
I think that in situations where I\'d use this (mainly non-military players)
I\'d have all routes lead to the same general result, but let the players
decisions influence their fates.  (Eg. are they wounded?  Do they get loot? 
Are they heroes?  Have they made an enemy?  Saved a friend?  Rescued some
children trapped in a burning school?)  


On a slightly different note, one of the things I\'ve found helpful for
introducing new players to the hobby is miniatures.  Many kids nowadays thing
that Magic and Nintendo are role-playing games because they have the same
plot elements (magic, swords, monsters...)!  The miniatures provide visual
cues to a generation raised on tv and videogames.  I also put some effort
into preparing colour building plans, ship plans, and so on, which further
increases their enjoyment.  After a few games they don\'t need the props as
much, but it gets them over the hump.  (I do this at work - I teach high
school.)

Message-ID: <N3N8mD1w165w@krypton.rain.com>

Several people seem to think that ammo for gauss weapons and mass
drivers would be complex and hard to manufacture. One cited FF&S.
I don\'t have FF&S but I have talked with folks who work with the real
thing (at Lawrence Livermore Labs).

While it\'s true that you can\'t just take a random hunk of metal and
shape it to produce a round, it won\'t be *that* much harder except for
the hypervelocity weapons, where you have problems with the round
*flowing* under its own weight.

FF&S may be using "fancy" rounds. But a gauss rifle that fires solid
"needles" at 5000 fps or so is easily doable with "near future" tech.
And making it able to work with a variety of metals isn\'t much harder.

Yes, you can magnetically accelerate *non-ferrous* metals. It just
requires a *changing field, not a steady one. And in fact, the "rail
gun" type setup is actually quite insensitive to what the projectile is
made of. It just has to be conductive.

So for this type of "gauss rifle" you could use *current* tech to put
"in the field" ammo manufacture into the back of a small van! Give that
you need some tools and the like for the unit armorer to do maintenance
on weapons anyway, having this as part of a support vehicle at the
company (or lower) level isn\'t *that* much of a stretch.

All it amounts to is something for chopping metal up into workable size
chunks, and then forcing the chunks thru wire drawing dies. Then the
pieces of wire get die formed into rounds. Sure, it\'s crude. and you
could improve it in several different ways. But it\'d *work*, and it\'d
be pretty rugged.

For the bigger mass drivers, things get a bit more complicated, I
agree. Then again, anything above squad support weapons is probably
better as energy/plasma weapons, except where you need indirect fire
weapons. And most current uses of *those* are better served by
ortillery.

a the UPP. Though the world has a high populace, it lacks most of the other

*The presence of same require a high enough tech lvl to sustain it, correct?
(Ebekhar had a Pre-collapse TL of 9, it now has a 7)

                            Laser Tightbeam
                            
  Standard Sensor pack:     Passive EMS Interstellar
                            Active EMS Far Orbit              

  Computer:     1/bis
                4 bridge consoles
  
  Standard Life Support Control
  
  Standard Security Control
  
  Standard Gravtics Control    
  
  Flight Control (for Maneuver and Jump)
      Pilot Station
  
      Co-Pilot Station
  
  Astrogation Table
- ----  

Does this give you an idea of what I mean by a Package?  

The Jump Drives would be discrete units designed to boost a given
volume into jump space.

Maneuver Drives would also be a discrete unit based on standard
volume.

Power Generators (Fusion Plants really) would be standard sized units
that produce a standard power out and use a standard amount of
fuel/hr.  I based mine on a standard 6 (2x2x1.5) cubic meter size
using cold fusion to generate 4MW, admittedly this didn\'t come from
any canonical source.

The details could be designed down to as fine a point as you want. 
The data could be presented on a level not much more detailed than CT. 
It could also be *very* detailed.

Ok, does this make sense to anybody?  Is this too complicated? To
simple?  Should I just go back to my star systems and forget this?

improved ship design process.  Nobody has, so I will.  I\'m really
going to hang myself out here, so be kind. <g>

I\'m not a "gearhead", especially, when it comes to ship design.
Actually, my area of interest is star systems and I\'d rather be
working on that, but this has so captured my attention that I\'m going
to get squat done until I get this out of the way.

I don\'t present this process as *the* way to go.  All I want to do is
stimulate some thought about the process.  Something detailed enough
to please the FF&S people, but easy enough for the rest of us.

What I\'m proposing is to create ships from standard parts that can be
picked from tables and plugged together.   This doesn\'t differ much
from the FF&S lite concept, but I think my pieces  are less finely
grained.  I\'m also coming at this from a CT/HG/MT direction rather
than FF&S.

                        Simple Ship Design

1.  Set Ship\'s main function:  Scout, Merchant, Combat, etc.

2.  Decide base tech level

3.  Choose standard hull size (increments of 100 Tons).

4.  Pick Bridge Package from Bridge Table.
       (Each Bridge Package includes basic controls, equipment &
        workspace for basic Command and Control functions:  Comm,
        Sensors, Computer, Security, Maneuver, Jump, &
        Astrogation.)

5.  Optional Bridge additions:
    a.  Communications
    b.  Sensors
    c.  Computer
    d.  Security
    e.  Screens
    f.  Aux controls

6.  Pick Engineering Package from Engineering Table    
       (Each Engineering Package includes basic controls &
        workspace for power generation, maneuver drive, jump
        drive, & a basic repair shop.)

7.  Optional Engineering additions:
    a.  Machine Shop
    b.  Electronic Shop
    c.  Weapons Shop
    d.  Gravtics Shop
  
8.  Jump Drive
    a.  Pick Jump Drive for the J factor desired and for the hull
        size from the Jump Drive Table.
    b.  Volume of fuel needed for 1 jump = (Vol of Jump Drive) * 5       


9.  Maneuver Drive
    a.  Pick Maneuver Drive for the G factor desired and for the
        hull size from the Maneuver Drive Table.    
    
10. Install Weapons Systems from Weapon Tables.
        (I\'m not going to detail this here. Surfice it to say
         we\'re talking about standard plug in weapons like in the
         example.)
        
        
11. Install Defensive Systems from Tables
        (Same as with Weapons.  The tables would have plug in
         systems.)


12. Pick number of standard Accommodations from Accom Table.
    a.  Low Berths
    b.  Bunks
    c.  Small Staterooms
    d.  Large Staterooms
    e.  Commons Areas

13. Gravity Control
    a.  GVOL = Sum of volumes under gravity control
    b.  Look up Grav Ctrl factors P and C from Gravtic Table
    c.  Calculate Power required = GVOL*P
    d.  Calculate Cost = GVOL*C

14. Life Support
    a.  LVOL = Sum of volumes under gravity control
    b.  Look up Life Support factors P and C from LF Table
    c.  Calculate Life Support power required = LVOL*P
    d.  Calculate Life Support cost = LVOL*C
        
15. Power System
    a.  PwrReq = (Sum of power required)*1.5 for safety
    b.  Add enough standard Generators to exceed PwrReq, look on
        Power Systems Table
    c.  This is PwrAvail

16. Fuel for Maneuver Drive, Weapons and Ship Systems
    a.  How many weeks of fuel?
    b.  (fuel/hr from Power Systems Table)*PwrAvail*Weeks*168
    
17. Determine current volume

18. Misc
    a.  Increased Compartmentalization: +1% current volume
    b.  Streamlining for atmospheric flight: +1% current volume
    c.  Bracing for landing on planets: +1% current volume

19. Cargo Space
    a.  Total current volume
    b.  Cargo = ((Hull Size)*14) - current volume
        (This is the cubic meters of cargo space to figure the
         tons divide this number by 14.)

20. Fill out a Standard Ship Form.


And here\'s an example I built with the process...

    'body' => '        Since I\'ve been a rather vocal proponent recently of a better design
system than merely CT/HG, spouting off about the benefits of an "FF&S
Light"-type system for both the nongearheads and gearheads alike, somebody
challenged me to put my money (and effort) where my mouth is: Develop a
draft of FF&S Light and submit it as an unsolicited proposal to Imperium
Games, to see what they say.

        Well, it would be rather presumptuous of me to try to do this on my
own. Especially since somebody else first came up with the idea. Instead,
I\'m volunteering to act as a kind of coordinator. I\'ve already got a rough
draft, and I\'m asking everybody to tear into what I\'ve got. If we can all
come up with a design sequence that satisfies everybody, we can only win.
Gearheads: look at what I\'ve got, see if it makes sense. Non-gearheads,
especially those yearning for something as simple as Book2/High Guard, shred
into it. Rational criticism is always welcome.

        The idea here is to provide something as simple as CT/HG while still
remaining compatible with a detailed advanced system to be published later.

        Note that IG has NOT approached me and asked for this, although Don
Perrin has publicly asked about what is out there, for possible consideration.

A few requirements I\'ve set myself
   1. Should come damn close to CT/HG in simplicity. I\'ve got an initial
goal of no 
      more than 10% more steps or calculations. I don\'t know how doable this is,
      but it\'s a starting point.
   2. Straightline design sequence -- no flipping back and forth. Each step
      should rely only on information already recorded and information
      presented in the step itself.
   3. Mathematically simple -- Beyond adding up the results of each step, 
      avoid complex equations wherever possible. Simple tables are 
      preferred, but a _FEW_ straightforward addition/subtraction or 
      multiplication steps are permitted.
   4. Based on FF&S, and fully compatible with it.
   5. Where needed, improve on FF&S.
      Capture those tweaks and make sure we provide them as inputs to the 
      detailed design sequence supplement
   6. The rules should provide 
      a. Thruster plates or equivalent low-fuel reactionless drives for those 
         who like the feel in CT and MT.
      b. "Realistic" drives, especially for those like me who like the
tradeoffs 
         limited maneuver fuel forces into combat.
   7. Perhaps provide both CT/MT style anti-gravity (my favorite) and TNE style
      contragravity?

        I\'ve started updating the rough outline I have on my Web page. Check
it out, and respond asap! I think we can get this done and near-finalized in
a few weeks. The only changes needed then would be where the basic rules for
combat, etc. change.

        Even if Imperium Games decides not to go with this kind of system,
it\'ll provide a welcome resource for the people who want it.

        What I\'ve got so far is at

        http://www.usa.net/~goldendj/Admiralty/FFSLight/FFSLight.html

        There are already some glitches there that I need to fix, but it\'ll
give us a starting place.

Once again, I\'d like to emphasize this is not sponsored or condoned by
Imperium Games. I\'m just out acting on my own like a loose cannon, hoping to
have some impact. Who knows, if we\'re really good, we\'ll have sped up the
release of both the basic rules AND the advanced design supplement.

        1. Not everybody has Web or even Internet access. How many people
are subscribed to the mailing lists, vs. how many are playing Traveller?

        2. No matter the final design system, the existing Web designs will
need at least some tweaking. Even if the gearheads had won a devastating
victory months ago, when the idea of T4 was first broached, the detailed
design rules are going to be different from FF&S to some degree. The core
rules are changing, and the designs have to reflect that. But it\'s easier to
start with something and modify it than to start from scratch.

        3. Very few of the posted Web designs have fancy artwork, deckplans,
nice printing, adventure nuggets, etc. IG can and probably will be adding
quite a bit of value to whatever they publish.

        4. Because there will be more in the supplement than just the
existing Web designs -- this was merely a suggestion to help pad the book out.

        No, don\'t! Please stay involved! This is useful stuff. Just a few
comments:

        You talk about using discrete packages for things like power, etc.,
just increasing the number of packages to get the desired output.

        I don\'t think this is very "realistic" way that a starship designer
would work, given economies of scale. That is, one power plant producing
twice as much power as another would be smaller and less expensive than
simply two of the lesser powerplants. A better idea would be simply a table
of different-sized power plants, for example 5MW, 10MW, 25MW, 50MW, 75MW,
100MW, etc. The 100MW plant will be smaller, more efficient and more
reliable than twenty-five 4MW power plants. The designer can then either
pick the one plant closest to his/her needs, or perhaps multiple power
plants. For example: if I need 87.5MW to run my ship, I can either go with
the 100MW power plant, and have a little excess capacity, or I can install a
75MW, a 10MW and a 5MW. Whichever combination took less volume and cost less.

 One musen\'t forget the nuclear or conventional power plant needing alot
of maintinance.
 Course, if it was a short duration sub it woulden\'t be a problem, but
current 6mo boomer cruises need engineering crew.

Of course.  <g> The Johnson/Lewis 2T-4MW is but one model that would
be available on a table.  I\'m with you on larger size models, but not
too many, or you lose the economy of
*manufacturing* scale!  One or two at the 4 to 8 level, the 30 to 40
level and the 100 to 200 level, maybe.  Power Plant designs can be
created and published like anything else.

Now the but...

1.  My ship is being built on Kittle Prime by Drise and Son,
Shipbuilders.  I want to built inexpensively, so they are using as
many "off the shelf" parts as possible.  They happen to have 40, 4MW
generators in stock left over from some system boat work they were
doing for the local navy and so...<g>

2.  Seriously, I visualize Traveller ships to be a good bit like steam
ships early this century.  All large steam ships had multiple
boilers..why?  So one could be taken down for service or repair and
still have 3/4, 1/2 power.  Warships, especially, would want
redundancy.

I\'d try to get ship designers to avoid that if possible.  I think 3 to
6 "boilers" of the same model would be better:  easier to repair;
interchangeable parts; less training/maintenance overhead for the
engineer.

You\'ve added a *lot* since I dropped by last week!  <g> I dled all
your pages tonight..this morning so I can study them off line.  

Two things to think about...

First, I think some of your systems might be too finely grained. Group
*everything* needed for a 3 or 4 standard bridges together and make
that a plug in.  Let folks customize by adding on enhanced
controls/computers/sensors as a more advanced process. It looks like
you\'re doing that for weapon systems already.

Second, we always pick the hull size & configuration first..what if we
didn\'t?  What if we did it backwards:  

1. picked out all the systems that go into the ship

2. put in a plant to power them

3. put in a maneuver drive 

4. put in tanks for the fuel

6. put in a jump drive and fuel for it

5. put in a minimum cargo area

6. added it all up and picked the next biggest hull

Would that be easier for everybody than having to keep fiddling trying
to fit everything in a 800ton hull?

I can\'t do anymore tonight!

        True. Although I\'d probably make a few more steps in the chart. And
for the larger systems, you\'re not really talking the economy of
manufacturing scale ... just the economy of not having to design, test and
qualify a brand-new design. A customer comes in looking for the 1500MW power
plant, you call up the plans in the computer and set the factory humming.

        This is true, too. Traveller has always assumed a power plant can be
partially damaged and still work. I think it\'s more likely that anything
beyond superficial damage will shut it down, so you\'d probably need multiple
power plants. There\'s a tradeoff here -- a warship will want more
independent units for battle damage, etc. while a merchant will want only a
few, to cut down cost and increase cargo capacity.

        The problem with all this is it\'s more detail than the target
audience really wants. Remember, part of the FF&S Light target audience is
the guy who yearns for the Book 2 days, but wants to be compatible with others.

        That\'s basically what I\'m doing with the electronics already --
sensors, comm, computers, etc. all in one package. But the rest of the
bridge (number of workstations) is going to depend on crew size.

        I\'ve deliberately designed the worksheet so you can work it in any
order you want. But how are you going to size the maneuver drive and the
jump drive without already knowing the ship displacement?

Don\'t waste them, there are many harried refs on the list who love to see

That sounds good to me.  I\'ve examined your system-under-construction on 
your web page, and what you have there has merit.  But (you knew that was 
coming, didn\'t you?:) it still seems too complicated for a basic system.  
Perhaps I am reading it wrong.  Your system seems to have one overall 
design checklist, then another checklist for each major component (hull, 
jump drive, maneuver drive, crew, etc.).  

Isn\'t it possible to boil it down to a single, 16-item checklist 
supported by a single table for each design component?  I\'d rather not 
worry about what tech level my hull is designed at, what G acceleration 
it can take, etc.  I realize there are compatability issues involved 
here, but why not make those choices for people?  If 6G is the max 
acceleration any ship is capable of under this system (for example), then 
the basic system should have a table of hulls, and each hull should have 
the capability of doing 6G factored into its statistics.  Sure, they\'re not 
going to get a good deal on that hull if it is for a ship that only does 
1G.  But it will still be compatable with the full-up system, while 
retaining simplicity of design.

Similarly, design decisions could be made for all components.  Get them 
all down to a single table for each, just like in the Book 2 rules, and I 
think you\'ll have a winner.  Just explicitly state which design decisions 
have been made, so that it will indeed be possible to design those same 
items under the full system to ensure compatability.

Do you see where I\'m going, or am I not making sense?

Yes!  This is what I advocated in my previous post.  Provide basic 
components in a few charts, with notes that they are of such-and-such 
configuration, and this will solve the compatability issue.  Sure, 
provide all the statistics but don\'t require the user to make design 
decisions on each statistic.  For example:

Standard Hulls Table

Tons	Main	Drives	Max. Accel.	Configuration	MCr	Time
100	85	15	2G		Needle		2	9
100	75	25	4G		Wedge		3	9
200	185	15	1G		Sphere		8	11
200	175	25	2G		Cylinder	9	11
...etc...

Include some basic configurations.  Additional ones could be included in 
a supplement, in JTAS, or whatever.  This sort of table would provide all 
the information required to reconstruct the exact same thing under the 
full system, with the same result in time, cost, etc.  Obviously, I 
didn\'t include everything (ie, armor) in the above table, but it could be 
done (I just took the table in Book 2, and modified it based on what is 
required for a full-up system, and also what sort of drive compartment 
size is required to fit a standard drive that would allow the given-sized 
hull to achieve the acceleration given as the maximum).  A gearhead could 
do a much better job of constructing such a table, I know.  This is just 
a quick-n-dirty example for illustration.

Pardon my ignorance, but what is a "storytelling-style combat resolution

Sounds good, so long as one of the above is something like Book 2...

        I\'ll probably agree with you there. Part of that may simply be the
way it\'s laid out right now, which can be fixed. But I\'m also looking for
ways to simplify it somewhat.

>Perhaps I am reading it wrong.  Your system seems to have one overall

        Well, that\'s partly just the way it\'s presented right now, since
it\'s a work in progress. But even High Guard had a "checklist" of sorts for
each major component: for example, the hull was (1) select size, and
configuration, (2) calculate cost, (3) select armor, (4) calculate armor
mass ... mine is (1) select hull size, configuration, armor and
acceleration, (2) read factors off the table, (3) do four simple
multiplications.

        I thought about going with just a single table, but there\'s so much
more detail to be gained at virtually no cost whatsoever -- just by being
willing to choose one of seven tables (really not that much more difficult
than looking at a single table), you gain the ability to look at different
hull configurations, which means even the simple system lets you make tradeoffs.

>here, but why not make those choices for people?  If 6G is the max

        I think "6Gs is the max" is an example of an arbitrary limitation,
something most people, even under the basic system, would like to get rid
of. On the other hand, it would simplify the process *slightly*.

        So, perhaps instead of presenting a single table for each type of
maneuver drive and letting the designer pick, just assume all basic system
ships will use thruster plates? I\'d certainly thought of that, and it\'s
eminently feasible. But again, by simply having a few extra tables that all
work the same, and asking the designer to take the extra microstep of
choosing one of them, even the basic system will generate some of the
richness of detail of the advanced system, without any increase in complexity.

>Do you see where I\'m going, or am I not making sense?

        No, you\'re making perfect sense. That\'s what I started out aiming
for, but then I felt _too_ much detail would be obscured for little gain. If
I can create a simple system that can provide much of the detail *without*
forcing the designer to cope with the complexity behind that detail, I think
it\'s a good thing. After all, nobody objects to having detailed information
about ships. They just object to having to wade through all the grunt work
in generating that detail.

        Basically, if the detail can be pregenerated and reduced to a menu
from which the designer can pick, I don\'t see any reason not to include a
few extra tables. The resulting system may take up more pages than High
Guard did, but it should be as simple to use.

        Anybody else have a comment on this? Keep the number of tables to a
minimum, or more detail is fine as long as you don\'t have to calculate it.

        Hmmm. I must have missed Rob\'s original post. So I\'ll have to
respond to it by proxy:

        YES! I\'ve said much the same thing ... your average customer is
going to walk in and pick systems "off-the-shelf" because they\'re cheaper.
The builder doesn\'t have to design, test and qualify a new design. Small
ships from one shipyard will tend to have the same stuff. But a
megacorporation, government or rich noble may have more detailed
requirements AND the money to pay for them.

        Although I think the non-standard construction will cost more, I\'m
not so sure the repairs will cost "_lots_ more" depending on how you define
"lots." Even a custom system will probably make maximum use of standardized
parts. But if you define repair costs as a percentage of original cost, then
from that alone the repairs will cost more...

        I completely agree. Even under CT/HG, ship design was an iterative
process. What I meant by linear was that in step 5, I shouldn\'t have to
refer to chapter 1, 3, 7 and 9 to get all the information I need. Hull
design was annoying under FF&S, because you had to look at two different
tables, plus several equations, plus a table in another chapter! Flipping
back and forth is tedious.

The same reason they\'d by the "Complete Works of William Shakespear" - because
they want it in print, easily and efficiently formatted, and ready to us.

And... you can always add those juicy tidbits to the print that aren\'t in
the basic sort of "online" stats.

The situation sounds bleak in both our cases.  Sigh.  It is beginning to 
sound more and more like IG is going to have to work on it from their end 
by providing store owners with initial product knowledge.  Thereafter, we 
can tell the owners we want them to stock it.

Afternoon Don,

I hope you\'re not reading this on Sunday (grin), but whenever you happen
by my message, I would like to develop something or three for you. I 
especially enjoy deckplans and I\'m good with Illustrator... Anyway, please
add me to the list of those folks who\'re thinking about developing something
for you. I\'d like to know which design sequence to use...

I thought perhaps the web-page format, and the fact that it is a 
work-in-progress, might have something to do with the complexity.  But I 
wasn\'t sure.  I\'m glad to see you comfirming that the complexity will be 
decreased in the final product.

I think this is where we\'re diverging.  You are comparing the proposed 
system to HG, while I am comparing it to Book 2.  I consider HG to be a 
complex system for a beginner.  What you are talking about is something 
at least that complex, and I\'m afraid the result will be unpalatable to 
new gamers.

I agree that dividing the hulls into a number of tables wouldn\'t put an 
undue hardship on beginners.  

What you are proposing is that, after selecting a hull from one of seven 
tables, they will then multiply the cost by an armor factor, a factor for 
acceleration reinforcement, a factor for streamlining, and a factor for 
landing stress.  Doesn\'t sound too hard.

Okay, now that you are explaining it, it doesn\'t sound like a bad 
system.  I guess looking at all that information on your web page, and 
realizing that a lot hasn\'t been completed yet, I got the feeling that it 
was going to be more complicated than it is.

So the player will not have to design any specific piece of the ship.  
They will only have to select them, determine their interactions (by 
using some simple formulas), and add up the cost.  Sounds simple enough 
for me, in principle.

Right.

More detail is fine...to a point, of course.  But it sound like you could 
keep your system down to one page of tables or less for each design 
element (ie, one page of hull types, divided among seven tables; one page 
of weapons, divided among, say, four tables; etc.).  The system you are 
explaining here sounds like a good way to satisfy everyone.

I guess we\'ll just have to wait until Monday to find out what Don decides 
is feasible given the publication time constraint.

    'body' => 'No matter what the final design system is, we will need some way to
represent the results in a compact format, such as High Guard\'s Universal
Ship Profile (USP).  However, limitations of the USP format were one of
the things driving the (IMHO) rather artificial limitations on ship
weaponry (you couldn\'t have bay or turret particle accellerators if you
had a spinal installation, because there was only one position for
particle accellerators).

SO, I propose breaking out the offensive weapons into separate groups for
spinal (two digits), bay (four types), and turret (four types).  Theese
new groups would replace the existing five-place offensive weapon group
in the USP.  The defensive weapons don\'t need breaking out like this,
because they can only be installed in one type of mount (sandcasters only
come in turret installations, repulsors are so large they must be mounted
in bays; and all the rest are internal).  In the examples below, I\'ve also
added the sensor/EW group that was proposed recently.


Old USP Examples:

BC-9514 Kinunir  BC-A2447G2-000510-50202-0  MCr1336.63  1250 Tons
batteries bearing                  2 2 2

        batteries            A   N AXA1Z


NEW USP Examples:

BC-9514 Kinunir  BC-A2447G2-000510-00-0000-5022-0-7741  MCr1336.63  1250 Tons
batteries bearing                          2 22

batteries bearing            5   B  1    Y 5R5
        batteries            A   N  1    Z AXA


Here\'s the complete breakdown of the new USP format:
XX-@@@@  Example  XX-1234567-89ABCD-EF-GHIJ-KLMN-O-PQRS  MCr$$$$$$  ### Tons

Ship Identification:
XX = Ship Type code
@@@@ = Ship Number
Example = Ship Name

General Information:
1 = Tonnage code
2 = Comfiguration code
3 = Jump Number
4 = Maneuver G\'s
5 = Power Plant rating (is this still needed?)
6 = Computer Code (or computer DM, perhaps?)
7 = Crew code

Defense:
8 = Hull Armor factor
9 = Sandcaster Turret factor
A = Meson Screen factor
B = Nuclear Damper factor
C = Force Field (black globe) factor
D = Repulsor Bay factor

Spinal Weapons:
E = Spinal Particle Accellerator factor
F = Spinal Meson Gun factor

Bay Weapons:
G = Energy Weapon Bay (plasma and fusion gun, if still used) factor
H = Particle Accelerator Bay factor
I = Meson Gun Bay factor
J = Missile Bay factor

Turret Weapons:
K = Laser Turret Battery factor
L = Energy Weapon Turret Battery factor
M = Particle Accelerator Barbette factor
N = Missile Turret Battery factor

Fighters:
O = Number of fighter squadrons

Electronic Warfare:
P = Active Sensor factor
Q = Passive Sensor factor
R = Active Jammer (ECM) factor
S = Stealth and EMM factor

Additional Information:
$$$$$$ = Cost in MegaCredits (to six significant figures)
### = Exact tonnage, in displacement tons.


Despite the complexity of decoding the USP (I drew up special ship control
sheets that helped immensely in my own games), I think it\'s important to
have a compact format for representing everything important about a ship.
The longer descriptions, particularly those used in MegaTraveller, always
seemed cumbersome when attempting to compare ship designs.

It seems that I have been swayed by the myriad of discussions here on the
Traveller and the XBoat mailing lists. I\'m willing to give FF&S Light a
try. Dave Golden (goldendj@mail.usa.net) has volunteered to coordinate the
design of this system. Please email comments and suggestions to him.

FF&S (and Light) will need a method of creating a USP however. The basic
combat system will still be High Guard-like. The changes will probably
include two more range bands (a la Battle Rider - short, medium, long,
extreme). In fact, Battle Rider could be used as a semi-basis for this
method. See what you come up with. Also, the design of starships using FF&S
Light should take from 15 minutes to 30 minutes to complete. No more.

I\'ve given Dave until Friday to come up with a working model of the FF&S
Light system, including the USP generation sub-system. If I accept the
system, then this is what will happen:

        The Main Book will contain some stock ship designs, their USP\'s,
        and the Modified High Guard combat system.

        The Starships book will contain more stock ship designs, their deck
        plans, their USP\'s, the FF&S Light building system, and some other
        stuff.

        Later, we\'ll publish FF&S (updated) again under a new name.

This would mean that FF&S is the system for developing starships. You can
still use it. FF&S Light will be used by new players, and those not
interested in the level of detail from FF&S. Tech levels for jump drives,
et al, are as per FF&S. Ignore what I said earlier.

BTW, fusion is a little strange around year 0. The fusion from FF&S is what
we call "Fusion Plus". Before year 0, no one had Fusion Plus, only fusion.
What this means for ships over 100 tons is - nothing. However, the power
plant necessary for a 100 ton ship is as small as it could get.
Effectively, there were no starships of less than 100 tons. Then came the
Empire, and they invented Fusion Plus. Now they can build a 10 ton fighter,
a 50 ton modular cutter, a ship\'s boat, etc. Other people can only build
100 ton shuttles or the like. Now you can see why so many people wanted to
join the Empire back in Milieu 0.

For those of you who expressed an interest in designing ships for me,
please hold off until Friday to see what the design system will look like.
You could, however, use FF&S to design the ships, if you like. I\'m looking
for TL11 ships for Civilian service and TL12 ships for government/military
service. I\'d prefer to have deck plans in some .eps style format, if
possible. Use 2 meters per square, if you will. The plans must fit on an 8"
by 10" page (or, for large ships, two pages.)

Thank you for your support and encouragement. Let\'s get to work!

Just a quick question:  Which should we use for maneuver drives,
thruster plates or HEPLaR drives?

Start it up on the beta list and I\'ll do what I can as well.  We need to
keep in mind that there was talk of a HG-compatible requirement.  This
would mean fixing FFS until certain numbers replicated HG (drive %s,
etc.).  As long as the ships _work_ the same way, I\'d think there\'d be
leeway here.  For weapons, etc. FFS goes from real units (MW/MJ) to
abstract units used in combat rule (damage points, etc.).  We could
easily just change those arbitrary conversions to result in HG factors.
The same is more or less true of energy points, as well.

Hmm, I only used book 2 to design ships until I bought HG.  Never used
B2 again for that.  I could knock out a HG desing in no time, even in
the early 80s (back in high school).  I saved up and bought HG within a
few months of buying the boxed set as I recall.

I don\'t think that the design system should be limited to people that
can\'t add or multiply :-)  HG\'s most complicated math is to figure,
what, energy points?  Agility?  The actual design process has no more
than taking %s.

        From my discussions with Don this morning, both types of drives will
be available in FF&S Light. It\'s going to depend on whether you like the
tradeoffs in combat associated with limited fuel, or if you\'re willing to
ignore the "Doomsday Lifeboat" possible with virtually unlimited

Hey,

A simple addition to the canon (I haven\'t thought it through all the
way) might be this:  repulsors might work better as target velocity
(relative to the repulsor) increases.  They\'d get better and better at
deflecting  nasty stuff.  Low tech civilizations would go through a
risky period where interstellar/interplanetary wars would be really,
really nasty, but things would get better after that.  It would also
explain the missiles in CT/MT.  I have yet to think of an even
hand-waving reason why this would be so, but the end result works :-)

A navigational repulsor would be standard on ships at TLs to support it.
Without one, you\'d have limited velocities relative to the
InterPlanetary Medium (IPM) unless you wanted to trash your ship... has
interesting implications.

Adopting High Guard rather than a developed and streamlined FFS is akin to
evolution selecting the archeopteryx over a peregrine falcon. High Guard had
faults and you\'ve just thrown away ten years of experience in streamlining the
design process. If you absolutely must use High Guard, dump the USP as a first
move - I was and am a Traveller fanatic, yet I never learnt to read them without
a copy of book 5 in hand (much the same goes for planetary stats). A verbal
description is much more evocative (and readable) than a number string. A
bifurcated (large ship/small ship) design process is also a mistake, IMO. Why
should I have to learn two systems when a single integrated design system has
been demonstrated - twice (and even HG worked at the small ship scale, so make
that three times).

I am afraid that any attempt to integrate the original computer system concepts
into the rules is going to lead to me considering them as little better than a
joke. I work in the defense avionics industry, anyone suggesting this
architecture would be laughed at all the way to the door, proposing it as the
cutting edge a thousand years down the line is inviting disbelief (or worse).
Centralised multi-purpose computers represent a design concept that was out of
date when Traveller was first conceived. To attempt to resurrect that system in
T4 is little short of unbelievable. Consider this - almost without exception the
potential market for T4 will have been exposed to low cost micros, very likely
to networkable games or the Internet. They know and have an instinctive
understanding of distributed computing power as the modern approach, that
mainframes went out of the door years ago. For a retro-styled game such as Dark
Conspiracy centralised computers might have worked, but for Traveller?!

Commenting generally, rather than specifically WRT the ship design rules, I must
admit that what we know of the design decisions behind T4 worries me. It seems
to me that everything we have learnt is being sacrificed in pursuit of the
mythical \'compatibility\' with CT rules. What percentage of your market will be
CT fanatics, playing using CT rules and CT backgrounds? Very few, I suspect.
Even those few who are will be abandoned, because the first Milieu won\'t be CT\'s
Spinward Marches in the early 1100s, it will be Sylean space in Year 0, and for
those of us running Rebellion or New Era campaigns help is even further away -
to be frank, as a TNE player I feel betrayed. T4 is going to have a tough time
establishing itself, not only does it have to overcome the inertia in the games
distribution networks caused by a surfeit of CCGs, but it is launching at almost
the same time as The Babylon Project, a game with inbuilt TV advertising and
brand recognition and likely with graphics even Chris Foss can\'t hope to compete
with. Against this kind of competition T4 needs to play to its strengths, and
its strengths are the depth of its backgrounds, not the outmoded CT rules
system.

Compared to a Book 2 design? Or a High Guard design? The ship design process is
something essentially separate from the role playing aspect of Traveller. The
crossover is the final design, printed in a book or a magazine adventure, or
just in the ref\'s notes. Can you honestly say that a Book 2 design is more
inspiring than a BL one? IMO BL gives much more of what the players want to know
about their ships, whereas Book 2 gave a bare bones text summary (let\'s not even
try to discuss the applicability of a HG USP to roleplaying). The only time the
Book 2 designs really worked was when Marc (usually), took that skeleton and
fleshed it out in one of the adventures - but how much of that came from Book 2
and how much from Marc?

But do you want something that feels like CT to the players, or something that

So, Sylean designs, not the ones we know and love, but not otherwise different

Effectively you\'re working with a tech-level limitation, but the freedom to do

Heresy <g>. If you\'re going to tabletopping (name a RPG that doesn\'t resolve
combat on table top or hex grid) then that isn\'t too bad, though hex grids are
more convenient for many of us. If you mean to reinstate abstract range bands
then the system becomes less attractive, if doable. The unfortunate corrolary is
that this means forcing disparate weapons into identical range bands.

That might satisfy me, but modular must mean modular - ie same design decisions

        That\'s not my understanding from Don. While the mechanics are going
to be the same, I don\'t think there\'s any intention of "altering" FF&S in
that drastic a manner. In fact, FF&S should be left virtually unchanged.

        Certainly. We want to keep the detailed FF&S units in FF&S, but we
need a way to convert an FF&S laser\'s "Rng: Pen-Dmg" to some kind of
single-digit combat factor.

        Some things definitely need tweaking, such as crew. I\'m inclined to
use the FF&S crews as "low-automation" and come up with a simple multiplier
for automation effects. But at the same time, we need to do this fast, and
with as little change to FF&S as possible.

        Rule of thumb, or perhaps just "Imperial Ministry of Commerce and

still going to be limited by surface area as per FF&S.

        My understanding is we\'re sticking very closely to FF&S. I
specifically asked about having multiple drive tables, but didn\'t think to
clarify whether the "standard" would remain HEPlaR or revert to thruster
plates. I\'ll ask about that.

        The one subject where FF&S is open for changes! By now you\'ve read
Don\'s message about the nature of fusion plants at TL11 ... too big for
ships much smaller than 100tons. We\'ve got to come up with some rationale,
handwaving or not, for this, so we don\'t get stuck with an arbitrary "before
TL12 thou shalt not have fusion in small craft." Anybody got any ideas about
a physics breakthrough in fusion technology that won\'t necessarily increase
the power density, but will allow smaller minimum sizes?

        FF&S Light will consist _mostly_ of tables of "standard _____s." And
since most ships will probably have an odd power requirement, chances are
good there will be multiple pplants: say you need 87MW: put in three 25MW
plants and a 15MW plant...

        Good idea ... I\'ll see if I can tweak the hull tables some more. I\'m

        I\'m leaning toward recommending that FF&S crew levels be taken as a
"low-automation" level, due to Virus. Pre-Collapse crews will be smaller.
Maybe just a simple fraction of the "book" levels, by TL perhaps. Suggestions?

        Well, even a custom designed system will probably be designed around
mostly standard-type parts. But if you just define repair costs as a
fraction of the original cost, then the higher original cost will drive
higher repair costs without a separate rule.

        Custom designs are coming <G>. In fact, they\'re still here.

me into the hot water. I\'ve got until Friday to come up with a basic working
model of "Fire, Fusion & Steel Light." I need some serious help to do this.
During my talks with Don Perrin this morning, here\'s the guidance I got:

	1) "Fire, Fusion & Steel" (FF&S) _will be_ the detailed spacecraft design
supplement for MMT, with little change. He doesn\'t want a wholesale rewrite.
Only if something is seriously broken will it be tweaked. However! If it
does get fixed, it needs those fixes identified NOW so they are incorporated
into the "Light" version. IG will eventually reissue FF&S, and any updates
will be made available on the Net for those who already have it.

	2) Combat will be "High Guard-style," using single-digit ratings for
systems in a Universal Ship Profile, and separate to-hit/to-penetrate tables
instead of tasks. So we need to come up with a way of converting detailed
statistics into single-digit type ratings. But we\'re not rewriting FF&S to
look like HG. My understanding is that the combat rules will *not* be
straight out of "Book 5, 2nd Edition" as far as actual values, etc., just
that the mechanics themselves will be very similar. As an intermediate step,
the abstracted combat values in "Brilliant Lances" may be a good start for
generating USPs.

	4) The USP really shouldn\'t grow much bigger -- Don thinks it\'s probably
too long already. He\'s talking about coming up with some way to roll ALL the
offensive and defensive systems into a single factor each, i.e. Attack 7,
Defend 5. Just for the basic rules, folks, calm down. Something like
"Brilliant Lances" (and probably "Brilliant Lances") is also being planned,
and they\'ll use mechanics much like the existing ones, in all their glorious
detail. But a quick firefight in the middle of a roleplaying session
shouldn\'t break the momentum.

	5) Fusion power plants are one thing that needs fixing in FF&S. One of the
"hooks" in the Milieu 0 setting is the idea of "Fusion Plus." Ok, it\'s not a
very catchy phrase, but here\'s the basic idea. The commonly available fusion
plants are big. You really can\'t build them small enough for a fighter, for
example. The Imperium, with a common TL of 11 but a military TL of 12 has
had a technology breakthrough which allows them to build much smaller plants
that can fit into fighters (or other small craft). The new plants don\'t
produce more power per unit mass; you can just build them smaller. One of
the reasons many "pocket empires" are willing to join the Imperium is this
technology. 
	So we need to tweak the fusion plant rules enough that it\'s not practical
to put them into ships much smaller than 100tons prior to TL12. I repeat,
they\'re not necessarily more efficient, they can just be made smaller after
TL12. I _seriously_ need some inputs on this one, folks.

	6) The variety in armor materials, maneuver drives, etc. will be kept.
However, the basic design rules need to be structured to make design as much
as possible a "Pick a system, deduct its volume from the running total, add
its price, mass and power requirements to the total, and press on."

	7) "Basic Working Model" means all tables basically complete. Prose to make
it look good can be added later, as long as the system is testable now.

	8) If possible, don\'t pester Don about spacecraft design, he\'s probably
busy with the combat rules. I get all the hate mail now.

	9) I\'ll follow discussions on all three lists (Beta, Traveller and XBoat)
as soon as I get resubscribed to the XBoat. If you sent a message on XBoat
before receiving this, I didn\'t get it. I\'ll probably get three or four
copies of every message as people echo them to all the lists, but it\'s
easier and quicker than asking everybody to join just one of the lists for
the discussion. I need everybody\'s ideas.

	10) I\'ll keep copies of work-in-progress on my Web site at 

		http://www.usa.net/~goldendj/Traveller/Admiralty/FFSLight/FFSLight.html

	What\'s there right now isn\'t yet the latest version, as I\'m in the middle
of changes, but I\'ll get it up soon.


SUMMARY: We\'re _not_ designing a new system, nor doing wholesale surgery on
FF&S. We\'re taking the existing rules and coming up with a simplified system
for quick & dirty designs. And we\'re doing it fast, so there\'s not much time
to squabble. My basic plan of attack is to convert all the FF&S rules to a
set of tables from which you can pick items. But I need input from
everybody, especially those who\'re most interested in a basic system.

        That\'s the goal: create "HG-style" USPs, not a High Guard version of
FF&S. The design system will remain FF&S -- all Light is is a set of
pregenerated FF&S systems.

        Small ships ... I was only planning on going up to about 5,000Td.
Most customers for bigger ships are going to be governments or megacorps
with detailed specs and more money. Plus, most shipyards aren\'t going to
have "standard" equipment big enough for the rare big ship.

        As little as possible, with one exception. To fit the basic setting

        Well, Don seemed very firm about not changing FF&S. He did agree
that we can tweak it somewhat if absolutely needed, but no major revisions.

Yup, it\'s very, very simple.  Strong/weak force control.  Dampers
represent this tech, and come in at TL12.  Before that fusion plants are
quantitative improvements on what we might be able to do in the next
century.  After TL12 it\'s a whole new ball game.

I am not talking about math so much as the process itself.  That is, the 
number of steps involved,the number of tables involved, etc.  But, if you 
read the rest of my earlier reply, you know that I came to the conclusion 
that what David Golden is proposing is indeed appropriate for beginners.

Possibly.  But consider how repairs work.  (Details thanks to an aviation
tech I know.)

Airplane lands with problems: that radar isn\'t working properly.

Tech pulls the three modules most likely to be broken and tests system.  If
it doesn\'t work, she repeats it with the next three modules.  Eventually it
works.

All pulled modules are sent back to the factory for reconditioning.  (Even
the ones that were ok go back - less chance of a human error, and they may
have been damaged by being pulled.)

The tech doesn\'t attempt to repair the broken module.  Too much time,
requires equipment sho doesn\'t have, parts she doesn\'t have, and probably
requires knowledge she doesn\'t have.  besides, it would void the warranty.


This is what I see starport repairs as like.  Thus, opening up the standard
module to repair/tweak it is a possibility, but the players will have to do
it themselves, or hunt for a good (and expensive) technician.


If you want more justification, keep in mind that the actual construction of
each standard module is protected by patents (and possibly black epoxy and
anti-tampering devices, depending on how paranoid the manufacturer is :-) ). 
An LSP avionics package meets the same specs as a General Products one, but
its interior circuitry will be different.  (Rather like chips nowadays: same
specs, different masks.)

Before we go off and cause problems for Imperial Games in our haste to
shoehorn FF&S into something that might use I make the following points.

1. Where does Greg Porter\'s equipment guide(which is to include personal
weapons) figure into this? From messages that he has posted, the tech will
have a "Mr Fusion" type power for personal equipment and weapons. Any of you
that have used his "Guns, Guns, Guns" and "More Guns" know that weapons
designed with G^3 are 180 degrees out of phase with FF&S. If we do not get
some input from Greg we may have a Starship design and personal
weapons/equipment that are not seamless in their design and effects. Ie
starships using FF&S for starship weapons/equipment and personal
equipment(Read vehicles)/weapons using what Greg Porters equipment guide
will use. 

2. Let fix the problems with FF&S before we shove it into Imperial Games
Starship creation system. If that means that it will not be ready by this
friday so be it.
        FF&S Problems/Issues IMHO
        A. Homopolar Generators(Not in my starships!)
        B. Beam Pointers(Why, what is there use(s))
        C. Violation of the Laws Of Thermodynamics(ie liquid gases for

        E. Grav Focussed Lasers cludge(Hey but it makes for neat wargame of

Check.

About the only thing I can think of in regard to FF&S fixes that are
critical at this stage of the game are:
1) The "laser limit" rule, which I feel should be added.
2) A decision needs to be made with respect to the maneuver technology
   used.  HEPlaR (and it\'s fuel usage) will require the current J-Drive
   fuel consumption.  A return to thruster plates should probably be 
   accompanied by a return to larger quantities of jump fuel.  This
   is a philosophical decision, and may need to be made by Marc.
3) Alternative (smaller) crew rules for civilian ships.

> 2) Combat will be "High Guard-style," using single-digit ratings for
> systems in a Universal Ship Profile, and separate to-hit/to-penetrate tables


OK, this is something we can work with.  Basically, then, the single-digit
"factor" needs to combine chance to-hit, chance to penetrate, and damage
done.  I\'d suggest a system based on the expected value [*] of the damage
against a standardized target - perhaps something that delivers an expected
value of 1 major hit (nominal damage value of 40) should be USP 1.

The system can then scale exponentially (much like the original High Guard
system - a single laser was USP 1, but battery of 30 was USP 8).  As a
starting point, here\'s a suggestion:

USP = 1 + 2.1 * ln(Nweap * Deach / 40)
	where ln is the natural logarithm,
	      Nweap is the number of weapons in the battery,
	  and Deach is the damage value per weapon.
Increase the USP factor by one for batteries which have a Master Fire
Director dedicated to them.  Multipurpose MFDs can be  subsumed into the
computer/electronics USP.

For FF&S Lite users, a table could be provided listing USP factor and the
number of weapons required for a battery of the given factor (much like
High Guard, again).

[*] Note: this is a prob/stat term which means the number of the hits times
    the probability that they will occur.  For example, a system which does
    4 "hits" damage, but has a 50% "to-hit" roll and a 50% "penetrate" roll
    against our standardized target has an expected value of 1.

Well, you all know my feelings on that subject.

This might be a little _over_ simple, IMHO.  Perhaps a better idea might be
to make the USP an optional thing (much like it was in Classic Traveller;
USPs only came along with High Guard).  In the basic game, if you include
only lasers, missiles, and sandcaster turrets (again, much like Classic
Traveller) things become much simpler.  The USP can be presented along with
either the boardgame system or the detailed design system (or both).

Well, we\'ve already got a mechanic for this in FF&S, it just seems to me
that the values need changing slightly.  The (current) FF&S power plant
table looks like this.  I\'ve added a second column; this replaces the old
minimum volume and is the only change we need to make (the last column,
labelled "Std" is the same volume, expressed in displacement tons).

				Smallest Plant (in m3)
	TL Plant	MW/m3	FF&S		T4	(Std)
	 6 Fission	0.30	 30		  30	 2.1
	 7 Fission	0.60	 20		  20	 1.4
	 8 Fission	1.0	 10		  10	 0.7
	 9 Fusion	2.0	100		1000	71.4
	10 Fusion	2.0	 50		 500	35.7
	11 Fusion	2.0	 20		 100	 7.1
	12 Fusion	2.0	 10		  20	 1.4
	13 Fusion	3.0	  1		  10	 0.7
	14 Fusion	3.0	  0.25		   1
	15 Fusion	6.0	  0.1		   0.1
	16 Fusion	7.0	  0.075		   0.05

With the above table, you can see how fusion plants progress from large
installations (at TL-9, they would be ground based, or installed into
starships of several hundred displacement tons or more).  The TL-10 plant
isn\'t very useful for small ships, either (though you could try building a
75-ton craft around it), while at TL-11 things are looking marginally useful
for small craft above about 30 tons.

As I understand the Milleu 0, the Imperium will be at TL-11 to -12, while
most of it\'s competition will be at TL-9 or TL-10.  This is a significant
advantage for the Imperium, and also shows a distinct development curve
for power plants, as the gravitic and damper technology is mastered from
TL-11 through TL-13.

How\'s that for a starting point?

Sounds good ... though I think the system you\'ve got posted on your Web site
has a way to go before it is really this simple.

I\'ve got your answer...2 options...pick one, or both.

1. Nuclear Damper Technology!  

Quote:  Nuclear Dampers neutralize nuclear warheads, the effects of
high radiation, and disintegrator beams.
  ----  
  
First becomes available at Tech 12 as an focused defense at extended
ranges against nuke missile attack.  Perhaps available at 11-12 at
very short ranges to shield radiation from a fusion reactor.

Prior to the development of the ND shield all reactors needed massive
shielding around their cores.  Fusion reactors needed less than
fission, but still made it impossible to engineer reactors below a
certain size.

With Damper technology, a fusion reaction held in place by gravtic
controls could be engineered down to under cubic meter volumes.

[This requires a fusion that produces radiation levels high enough to
require a good bit of shielding.  I think what we expect from \'hot\'
fusion would give us this.  There might have to be some hand waving on
how damper boxes would allow a fusion reaction within the core and
prevent ionizing radiation from escaping into the ship, but it could
work and it\'s at the right TL already.]

2. Cold Fusion Technology!

Quote:  "There is no bottom limits of the size of this device. It is
lightweight, since it does not need heavy shielding...It is not
dangerous. It can..run off of water...", FF&S 68.

So, the Imperium discovers (not rediscovers..this is a real
breakthrough) a way to make cold fusion work.  Cold Fusion reactions
are at a lower efficiency on a cubic cm by cubic cm basis than older
hot fusion methods, but the shielding the older models needed can be
dispensed with so the amount of energy output evens out.  And much
smaller units can be build..literally fusion in a 2 liter bottle.
 
[My preference out of these two is for Cold Fusion.]

Here\'s a third one I just thought of...

3.  Advanced Gravtic Control!

Although gravity control first becomes available at TL 9, "Advanced
Control" is listed as TL 12.  

  A. With advanced control, a gravitation well around a fusion
     bottle traps escaping particles.
  
  B. Advanced gravity control allows proton-proton reactions for
     the first time...more efficient.
     
  C. Gravtic squeezing allows practical Cold Fusion..see idea 2.


I am NOT a gearhead!

I know what you mean.  At the design\'s highest level I\'d like to just
plug parts together period. Virtually no math.

I know what you mean.  Maybe we should round everything off to the
NEXT highest ton for the simple system.  That would mean wasted space
in a ship design (as if *that* doesn\'t happen <g>), but it could be
explained as the misc overhead of fitting the pieces together.  At
higher design levels you could *optimize* designs and remove wasted
space.  It\'s a time/money/space tradeoff.

My vision of the simple system is more simple than David\'s FF&S Lite.
I\'d present complete systems to just plug together.  

I see 4 levels of complexity

Level 1:   Completely pre-generated Ships

Level 2:  Pre-generated systems you just plug together.

Start with a worksheet with eight short sections.

1.  Pick a hull from a list of the size, armor and config you want. 
The hull comes complete with integral grav control, and all the
piping, wiring, etc needed for everything else.  This also gives you
the available volume..no math required.

2.  Plug in the Jump drive and Jump Fuel volume from a list and
subtract vol from vol still available.  At worst you\'d have to
multiply the fuel needed for one jump by some small number.

3.  Plug in the Maneuver drive from a list and subtract vol from vol
still available.

4.  Pick a Bridge Package from a table and subtract it\'s vol from the
vol available.  The Packages would be very high level including
sensors, electronics, control, communications, security, computer, and
flight controls.

5.  Pick 0 to n weapon systems from tables and subtract from available
volume.

6.  Add accomidations from a table:  so many low berths, small cabins,
large cabins, commons etc. and subtract from vol.

7.  Pick an Engineering Package from a table and plug it in.

8.  Plug in a Power Package exceeding the total of power required by
the other 7 subsystems.

Level 3:  Pre-generated subsystems that you plug together to make
complete systems, ie. create a hull, create a custom Bridge from lists
of pre-gened sensors, computers, commo gear etc.  (This is FF&S Lite I
think.)

Level 4:  Create the subsystem parts themselves, ie. design a custom
sensor system from the physics.  (This is FF&S!)

If I were IG, <g> I\'d put Level 1 and 2 in the basic rules. I\'d
include Level 3 with lots of ships, and ship systems in _Starships_,
and put Level 4 in an updated FF&S...which I\'d rename something like
TRAVELLER TECHNICAL DESIGN MANUAL.

Maybe I\'m a bit dim but what does "USMC adopted this gun, army guys use
that gun, my gun is bigger than your gun=8A" et c has to do with Traveller?
If you\'re about to discuss guns please confine yourself to gundesingns in
Traveller, 3G^3 et c as this nitpicking on contemporary gun use is
uninteresting to me and (probably) most subscribers.
There\'s probably lots of mailing lists for military types and gun freaks in

The main difference between what is "doable today" and Traveller\'s version of
gauss weaponry in the future lies in energy consumption.  Today\'s mass drivers
must energize sections of the "barrel" one at a time to accelerate a projectile,
timing the switching via computer.  FF&S\'s design incorporates the projectile
into the electric circuit which creates the magnetic field, allowing the weapon
to more accurately localize the field.  As the round moves forward, so does the
circuit, and so does the resulting magnetic field.  By creating such a localized
field, energy consumption goes way down and portability becomes possible.

FF&S is talking about an extremely refined version of the mass driver technology
available today.  Just as a piece of magnetite (or loadstone) makes a fairly
decent magnet, wrapping it around an iron core improves its efficiency by quite
a bit.

I suggested that too, but...I\'ve been thinking.  What does that do to
the previous several thousand years of Traveller history? I don\'t know
the max TL\'s of the First or Second Imperium.

Is the history going to get us into trouble here?

If nobody had hit TL 12, or Nuclear Dampers, then we\'re
OK..otherwise we\'re going to have to come up with something else.

        Would you use Discharge Energy, or try to do it using the actual
penetration/damage values? That gives us a direct tie between the armor and
the weapon ratings. However we scale the weapons, we have to make sure they
still get through the same armor. Maybe some kind of logarithmic scale:

        Pen/Armor       USP
           0-1           0
           2-4           1

           245-665       6
              etc.

        Obviously I\'m using natural logs here, but this is just an example.
How does BR scale BL weapons & armor? I need to dig up the rules and check.

        I believe Don wants to add some sensor info to the USP, which is why
he\'s reluctant to go even further than that -- he thinks it\'s already
bloated. I wanted to break out a variable number of digits for each weapon
type, since HG assumed all lasers were identical and that\'s not true. You
also can\'t have particle bays if you\'ve got a particle spinal, for example.
I saw it something like this

        xxxxxxx-842-xxxxxxxx
                26A

meaning 2 weapons (say, lasers) of factor 8, 6 more lasers of factor 4, and
10 of factor 2.

        Sounds reasonable. Now we just need to figure out the specific

        As I recall, MMT will have the combat rules and some predesigned
ships. SS will contain more stock designs, deckplans, and FF&S Light.
Finally, FF&S 2 will follow.

        Don was pretty clear about not wanting to change FF&S -- I had to
convince him that a few tweaks would be worth the effort. Do we really want
to try to swing something this major while trying to get the whole thing
done by Friday?

        I think our best bet is to concentrate on first getting FF&S Light
rules written to convince him it\'s workable, and when we turn them in try to
convince him we need to go back and fix FF&S. At that point, since most of
the work on USP conversion and etc. will have been done, updates to FF&S
shouldn\'t be too difficult to flow into FF&S Light -- just a matter of
changing tables.

        We really need to knock the rules out quick.

        Comments on the combat system should probably go straight to Don (or
the list; he does read it). I\'ll be trying to coordinate with him as far as
our numbers. But once we get the basic rules down and a general method of
converting to USPs, adjusting the conversions to provide desired output
hopefully won\'t be too difficult.

        Already being addressed, although specifics are still in flux (i.e.
formless). Basically, I\'d like to assume that the FF&S crew rules are for
post-Virus paranoid minimally-automated ships. The basic crew factor for
each system will be its straight FF&S crew requirement, and then we\'ll
multiply by a fraction (dependent on TL?) to come up with crews for more
automated systems

        Hmm ... sounds like a start. I was thinking of using the same
scaling for weapons and armor factors ... after the conversion a weapon
should still be as effective against the same converted armor.

        If I can get it to work out, I\'d really like to have the only math

        Unfortunately, although that\'s my goal, I\'m still a long ways off.

        I\'ll put this in front of me to keep my own feet to the fire. I\'ve
already come up with a way to ditch a little flexibility from the Hull
section in exchange for the ability to have just tables, with no other math
required like my original design.

Explanation of columns:
USP = USP hull size factor (as per High Guard).
Config = (new) USP configuration factor.  No relation to any prior config USP.
MaxG = The maximum maneuver G\'s the hull is rated for
Armor = (new) USP hull armor factor, based on new FF&S USP calculation.
StdTons = The familiar Standard Displacement Tons of the hull.
Volume = Remaining (usable) volume inside the hull.
Power = Power in MW required to run this hull (mainly for Grav/G-Comp system).

All of the hulls were built with (I hope) standard FF&S rules.  Included
in every hull is also Basic and Extended life support, one airlock per
100 displacement tons (up to a maximum of ten), one large cargo hatch per
200 displacement tons (up to a maximum of four), and a few small cargo
hatches.  The hulls also have artificial gravity and g-compensation
installed, and are built at TL-10.  Note that (as long as TL-10 materials
are used), the capacity of the G-compensation system increases with TL, but
the hull statistics remain otherwise the same.

Oh ... a word of explanation is in order about the hull configuration
USP codes.  They\'re basically the same configurations that are possible
with FF&S, except that I gave them each a USP code letter.  The codes
are arranged as follows (with no attempt at being compatible with any
other edition of Traveller and it\'s USP configuration codes).

USP	Form
0	Open Frame
1	Needle
2	Needle Streamlined
3	Needle Airframe
4	Wedge
5	Wedge Streamlined
6	Wedge Airframe
7	Cylinder
8	Cylinder Streamlined
9	Cylinder Airframe
A	Box
B	Box Streamlined
C	Sphere
D	Sphere Streamlined
E	Disk
F	Disk Streamlined
G	Disk Airframe
H	Close Structure
J	Slab
K	Slab Streamlined
L	Slab Airframe

That\'s enough for tonight; I\'ve got to go to work tomorrow, and it\'s late.
Hopefully soon, I\'ll be able to do some more systems.

Well, since I\'m alerted to the urgent need, I can promise to check for
administrative requests several times a day; and give good response.
This sort of thing _is_ why the list was created in the first place.

ALSO, as far as I\'m aware, the GDW-BETA list is the only one that is
archived to the World-Wide Web in real-time.  Even if I haven\'t subscribed
you yet, you can read the entire traffic off my web site (organized by date
and thread, too):

	http://www.qrc.com/~wildstar/gdw-beta/

The gdw-beta list software will also allow anyone (who has the posting
address) to post to the list.  Therefore, if you just want to monitor the
discussion and make an ocassional comment, you can do that without being
subscribed.  The posting address is:

        Convinced me. From here on out, I\'ll try to address FF&S Light
questions & comments straight to the GDW-Beta list, although for the next
day or so, as stuff trickles in, I\'ll make sure I reply to the source list
as well. That way, people who don\'t care won\'t be bombarded with all this
stuff, and those who do won\'t have to look at it three times ...

A fusion/plasma gun becomes a C-PAW when it becomes something else 
entirely, namely a particle accelerator.  As I recall, particle 
accelerators have their own spot in the High Guard USP.  The whole USP 
thingy made me consider one point:  Since when does a string of 
alphanumeric characters provide a greater role-playing experience than 
the readout for a ship designed using FF&S?  "Sure, the USP is 
05-91JF$322F-XJ930q7-19, but what does that MEAN?"

I think "We imposed that rule so that users of the simplified system 
could strike a whole column off of their design table and save some 
sanity points" would be just a good an explanation as any.  If you start 
with a complex FF&S-ish system, derive a simplified system from it, and 
publish the simple system first (since IG wants/needs to get a simplified 
system to market this fall), you can impose any such rule you want, 
just so long as it maintains consistency and compatability with the 
complex rules system that forms its basis.

"the physics behind it was mostly crap"?  FF&S was broken in a few 
places, but what led to THAT statement?  Did they print the wrong figure 
for acceleration due to gravity at 1G or something?

Some sort of misconception has crept into the whole discussion, and I 
want to address it here:  Since when do complex design rules detract from 
the roleplaying experience?  Who the hell, during an actual gaming 
session, works up a ship design?  Nobody I know.  I may be an odd duck, 
but I save the number crunching for the time between games, or I use a 
design off the rack.  If a player comes to me and says, "I wanna plunk my 
400 MCr lottery winnings into a starship of my design" then I get 
together with him/her and have him/her hammer out the specs and a 
workable design that follows the rules some other time than during the 
game session.  If they can\'t fit that into their busy schedule of work, 
school, kids, and minivans, then they can either trust the work to a 
shiftless, no-life lowlife like myself, or they can take a design \'off 
the rack.\'

When playing TNE, I never had an experience where knowing more about a 
ship detracted from the role-playing experience, especially when the ship 
in question is the PC\'s.  It\'s their baby, their livelihood, and if it 
dies, most likely, so do they.  They want to know how fast it can go, how 
far it can jump, how far it can see, and how far its lasers can reach.  
They also want to know if they\'ve got power to spare (in case they need 
to run a meson gun, to cite someone else\'s example) and if the inertial 
compensators are going to interfere with their pool game during routine 
maneuvering.  The players don\'t care that they didn\'t do the work that 
determined how their starship runs, but they\'re glad to know how it runs.

In many roleplaying situations (and here\'s where I address another 
misconception), the manner in which ships are designed has little or no 
bearing on what the players encounter.  If I roll on the encounter tables 
and the result specifies that the players get ambushed by a 400-ton 
patrol cruiser crewed by rebellious space-hamsters, I don\'t have to say 
"Hey, guys, can you wait four hours while I design it?"  I just flip to 
the page that has the stats and go from there.  If they do a good job of 
hiding (or the hamsters really brick their sensor task rolls), then I 
don\'t even have to drag out the Brilliant Lances hex sheets.

Does a complex design system detract from the role-playing experience?  I 
don\'t think so.  For players seeking touchstones with which to orient 
themselves in the universe I am attempting to describe, no amount of 
detail is too much.  On the other hand, I definitely believe that a 
too-simple design system can detract from the role-playing experience.  
The answer to too many questions becomes "Who knows?"  Can a CT-designed 
starship run a planetary meson gun on an emergency basis?  Who knows?  At 
which range does a ship become undetectable to another ship designed 
using High Guard rules?  Who knows?  What the heck is \'Near\' and \'Far\' 
range anyway?  Who knows?  "Who knows?" is not an answer that my players 
like to hear, especially when their notional butts are on the line.

At first, I kinda chafed at the way TNE/FF&S treated lasers.  However, I 
read an article in one Challenge magazine (I forget which) in which the 
people who came up with that stuff explained their decisions for making 
the rules the way they did.  Even so, they bent a few rules of physics to 
come up with the rules for lasers which many people are decrying as too 
restrictive or revisionist when it comes to published material (can you 
say \'Gravitic Focussing?\'  I knew you could).  I prefer rules for lasers 
(and space combat) which have a closer grounding to reality than some 
fanciful crap I\'ve seen (I won\'t mention the other game systems) in the past.
Of course, if someone could cite an example where the new laser rules 
conflict with old, published Traveller history (Tales of Future Past?), I 
wouldn\'t mind.

Interplanetary Medium?  Say what?

The only \'medium\' between planets is stark, empty space, which is 
notoriously difficult for anything, radial tires and repulsors included, 
to get a grip on.  Since a repulsor is essentially a large, focussed 
anti-grav generator useful for deflecting incoming missiles (or trashing 
small craft) or, when coupled with a tractor (focussed gravity 
generator), manipulating nearby objects, it needs something to push on in 
order to generate a corresponding push in the opposite direction.  In 
combat, the incoming missile will push just as much on the 
repulsor-equipped ship as the ship pushes on the missile, although the 
ship itself, owing to its larger mass, will hardly be budged.  A repulsor 
cannot push on empty space, and there is no such thing as some convenient 
\'interstellar medium\' that permeates outer space that is there for 
repulsors to push on.  The thruster plate is a convenient shortcut for 
those who don\'t want to be bothered with worrying about how much reaction 
mass they need to take along in order to maneuver in normal space.  By 
merely adding wattage, you get thrust.  This is explained as having 
something to do with quantum physics, but the simple fact of the matter 
is, since you\'re not ejecting matter from the ship in order to generate a 
corresponding, opposite acceleration vector, and there\'s nothing out 
there to push on, you\'re getting something for nothing.

The sidenote:  The IG folks are going to have to decide on one system or 
the other (HEPlaR or thruster plates), because that\'s going to affect 
many other things.  If we go back to thruster plates, suddenly there\'s a 
whole lot of hull space that doesn\'t need to be devoted to reaction mass 
anymore.  Such ships would have a huge inherent advantage over those 
using physically correct (PC?) HEPlaR drives, unless some game-balancing 
rule was imposed, such as forcing thruster plate starships to use the 
volume and mass regained only for hot tubs and pool tables.  Sure, TP 
ships\' crews might have more fun, but there\'d be no game-unbalancing 
advantage when it came time for combat.

Now, granted, there are many things that I don\'t disbelieve in order to 
play the game, such as FTL drives, lasers capable of scoring worthwhile 
hits on other ships at space combat ranges and speeds, and dogs with 
thumbs, but when you toy with something that is taught in the first week 
of high school physics, namely the lack of a universal frame of reference, 
you\'re making far too many demands on my Suspension of Disbelief ability 
to make the Traveller universe one that I can immerse myself in deeply 
enough to make the roleplaying experience worthwhile.

The following document was sent to Imperium Games a while back, in an

T H R U S T E R   T E C H N O L O G Y
=====================================

The thrusters of \'Classic\' and \'Mega\' Traveller (CT and MT) were 
discarded in The New Era (TNE) for fusion drives et al., on the grounds 
that the thrusters were \'reactionless\' and could not be explained using 
the current laws of physics. Heated discussion on the "xboat" and 
"traveller" mailing lists has indicated that many people preferred the 
original \'thrusters\' but no logical explanation (using either \'soft\' or 
\'hard\' science) could be found for their operation.

Discussion between myself and BITS member Nick Munn has brought us to 
the conclusion that thrusters CAN be explained using Traveller \'canon\'.

Some \'Canon\'
- ----

Several points of apparent \'canon\' should be considered:

(1) Thrusters have existed throughout Traveller \'canon\' until TNE.

(2) Thrusters are associated with gravitics technology (Starship 
Operator\'s Manual and other sources).

(3) Operating thrusters emit a (blue?) glow of brightness proportionate 
to their operating level (Starship Operator\'s Manual and other sources).

(4) Jump grids emit a glow when powering up to enter jump space 
(Starship Operator\'s Manual and other DGP sources).

(5) Thrusters on almost all deck plans have some form of link to the 
outside of the ship, much like a conventional jet exhaust.

(6) Thrusters were discarded in TNE because their \'reactionless\' 
operation did not fit with the \'hard\' science desired by GDW.

(7) Ships are supposed to have some form of huge central fly-wheel/gyro 
to form a centre of momentum about which they turn (Starship Operator\'s 
Manual). However, I am unaware of any canon, or non-canon deckplan which 
incorporates such a flywheel/gyro!

(8) Thrusters have a main thrust direction but can direct a reduced 
proportion of thrust to the side or even in the reverse direction 
(Starship Operator\'s Manual and other sources).

A new \'Canon\' for Thrusters
- ----

Given (3) and (4), Nick and I started pursuing the possibility (however 
tenuous) that there is some link between jump drives and thrusters. In 
order to counteract (6), we must assume that the thruster is emitting 
something away from itself to produce the forward thrust force (i.e. 
equal and opposite reaction principle). However, this \'output\' does not 
appear to be into normal space, hence the \'reactionless\' tag applied by 
GDW in TNE.

Let us assume that the thruster is indeed producing some form of output 
force. This will be some form of gravity force, i.e. via gravitons or 
somesuch (hence the link with gravitics of (2)). However, this is being 
output not into normal space but into one of the alternative dimensions 
associated with jump space. Original discussions many years ago with 
Marc Miller indicated that each jump distance (from 1 to 6) was 
associated with a separate jump dimension. Our \'thruster\' dimension is 
clearly a weaker link and thus might be linked to the Jump 1 dimension 
or a lower dimension.

We therefore need an interface to this dimension. We don\'t really want 
this inside the ship, so we need to let some part of the drive protrude 
slightly outside the ship, explaining (5). The interface will glow, much 
like a jump grid when it is in operation, explaining (3).

If we can control the gravitational flow across this interface (either 
across the width of a single interface, or by using two interfaces, one 
pulling, one pushing) then we can exert forces sideways or even in 
\'reverse\' (i.e. \'pulling\' against the interface to produce drag on a 
craft down). It seems logical that it will be easier to \'push\' against 
the interface than to \'pull\' (the latter being likely to weaken the 
interface), and hence the thrust off-axis will be reduced, satisfying 
(8). This also removes the need for a central gyro system of (7) which 
appears never to have been accepted as \'canon\' anyway.

Summary
- ----

Our new \'canon\' for thrusters satisfies points (2) to (7) and allows 
thrusters to combine some simple physical science with the science-
fiction \'mystery\' of jump drives, gravitics and extra-dimensional space, 
to produce a logical, working thruster system. This satisfies our 
original aim (1), i.e. to bring thrusters back into the mainstream 
\'canon\' of Traveller.

No its not a save assumption.  I\'m not on that list.  I\'m also not opposed
to creating a T4-beta list either.  Though I would recommend a traveller as
the list of choice, since it is the primary traveller list (and has the larger
FF&S supporters).  I dont know much about the GDW-beta list.  However since this 
is no longer a GDW product, is it appropriate to keep associating it with GDW?

As long as they do the same thing, for the basic purposes you could call
them batteries or duracells or clockwork mechanisma or whatever. Part of the
hypnotic luster of FF&S (for me) was the explanations for why the numbers
did this or didn\'t do that.

Gearhead I am not. But INMO more is better on the order of "if I don\'t like
it I can ignore it later" and such. However, as much as time allows (don\'t
hold your breath- finals are coming soon) I think I can try to assist in
whatever capacity as I am able.

Steps are rarely a problem in limiting complexity. For an example,(albeit
one that might show some of my gaming heritage) AD&D second edition
character creation can have MANY steps, and still are simple enought that I
have taught a group of 15 year olds the system in about 10-15 minutes (and
only because there were so many of them). The main point about limiting
design steps is that indexing too many pages worth of steps will get to be a
bitch, and also that I\'m sure that Mr. Perrin has only a set amount of space
to work with. Thats something you don\'t think about on the computer much,
but it translate quite vividly when trying to market your product for cost.

Amen. Suggest to Mr. Perrin that if I ever see a book of design sheets sold
as a separate product from the design workbook ever again I will probably
rip the game to pieces on the spot.

I\'m not sure ANYTHING is compatible with FF&S. I think a better (wording
perhaps?) would be to have a product that preserves the spirit and essence
of FF&S. Of course I spent months playing with alternate drives right after
I got it. I don\'t claim to be anywhere near a majority viewpoint.

I don\'t agree that the basic version requires "realistic" drives. I like \'em
too, but everyone important in T4 will be using Thruster plates to move the
metal. Other systems can wait for a supplement (I hate to imagine me
actually suggesting this but, you could move ALL of the alternate
technologies to ANOTHER supplement and make a bundle off of people like me
who like the idea of powering out to Jumpradius by lightsail) However much
you might dislike them sometimes as a consumer, you only have to look again
to TSR to find out where the money is in the gaming industry nowadays (The
Complete Traveller?)

Ditto as above. I would like though a reason why antigrav works THIS way and
not THAT way blah blah blah included into the basics...I tend to design for
stylistic effects, not just for hardcore results. What flavor of gravity
control I\'m using has a big effect on how I do things.

I think this is a matter of style as for the power plants...Once you have
them and they plug in you could do pretty much what you wanted with them
right? If you want to have two 1500MW powerplants or 1 1500MW and 1500 1 MW
powerplants shouldn\'t change anything about the basic numbers, which should
be IMO : 
Powerplant   Volume Mass Price Output
It\'s simple and it works. I don\'t even think this needs to be thought out.
This is a style issue. The warship with doubled full output powerplants
though is wasting a grand opportunity to find a waste for all that juice ;-)

I actually work my designs on the level of this:

What does it do and how does it do it?

This usually gets me target numbers for the jump performance and maneuver
performance. 
If it is a merchantman I put down cargo first, hopefully I\'ll know how much
I want to throw around at a time.
If it is a warship, I would put in the weapons (nothing spoils your warship
more than "I don\'t have enough room to put a powerplant in")

I don\'t think I\'ve ever worked a sequence by the numbers yet. Hmmm, I do
tend to choose hull sizes very quickly though. That may be more intuitive
than anything else though.

I have to go to sleep myself. The sun is coming up 8-)

I\'ve got a different idea to the TL*50 power limit.

Try 250MJ input power per square metre of FA surface area MAXIMUM.

This can be justified by technobabble along the lines of "micro-distortions
in the FA at relatively low power levels causing beam distortion and heat
build-up".

Note that this removes a particularly arbitrary looking self imposed limit,
means that really powerful lasers mass/vol etc increase with the cube of the
power rather than the square, deals with the HPG problem to some degree and
makes non-grav focussed lasers worth a really good look.

Ah... No.  There is a fair amount of junk in interplanetary space (comet
debris, solar wind particles, etc.)  Most of what we do in space there days
can ignore all that because we are not going all that fast, and the really
big chunks are pretty rare.  Bump the speed up to about 1000 km/s (which you
do given continous acceleration movement between planets) and this gets
serious.  You either armour the ship to resist sandblasting (and not just
the front, you have to allow for turnover) or do something non-material
about it.  I think that\'s what Merrick was talking about.

I can live with this.  Actually, since I can enjoy a Larry Niven story in
which Louis Wo calmly refers to reactionless thrusters and gets on with his
life, I\'m not going to worry about it at all.   I\'ll only get uptight if the
game abandons vector movement.

Sure, easy. Design a BB that fits canon.  I\'ll make a DD with a 150
laser bay that\'ll chew it to pieces every time.  You\'ll never even hit
me, I won\'t come into MG range.

This assumes you use the broken laser rules in FFS.  Using them you can
make 800ROF lasers that can critical a battleship with an armor of 4000
at 80 hexes----even if you don\'t let it shoot past 44hexes, it\'ll hit on
a Difficult or easier task (don\'t have stuff here now) task at that range 
due to ROF DMs.

That breaks the history since we see that ships actually *use* other
weapons?  why when a laser is always better?

Surely you jest?  Does WWU teach astrophysics?

If you lived someplace where the sky was clearer yopu\'d notice something
called the "zodiacal lights" at sunset/sunrise.

This is light reflecting off of dust particles inside the orbit of
Venus.  It is an extreme example of the desity gradient of the IPM.  The
baseline stuff, is, of course hydrogen at something on the order of
atoms/cm^3.  But there is also a significant amount of dust.  More so if
you move through large volumes of space in a time interval (well, more
in the sense that you *hit* more).

I\'ll give you hard numbers on the densities of the IPM, ISM, and IGMs
once I get to my references.  Bruce, have any handy?

Allowing ships to accelerate at 6gs for days gets you to the point where
your chances of hitting decent scale-sized dust is increased (since you
sweep up more volume by going fast relative to the IPM).  At
relativistic velocities, the hydrogen (solar protons, as well, not to
mention cosmic rays) are cosmic rays.

Are you trying to look dumb?

It would add a drag force, actually.  Simple.  Space is full of atoms
and dust.  It still beats a good lab vaccuum here on earth, but when you
hit that one grain of rice per cubic km (or whatever) at .2c it\'ll ruin
your whole day.

Joe,

Looking at what your average RPGer uses today, I don\'t think a book 2 
system (or facsimile thereof) is really going to satisfy a beginner 
anymore.  I thought that book 2 was too abstract in 1981 when I got 
High Guard.  I haven\'t used it since, and won\'t use it if it becomes 
the base system for T4. The nice thing about High Guard was that 
although it had a fairly long checklist for design, it was at least 
laid out and presented in good order.  I used to knock out High Guard 
ships in about 30-45 minutes on nothing more than notebook paper with 
a pencil and calculator...

I think that a bigger concern than the type of system for a basic 
ship design system (unless its insanely complex like FF&S), is that 
it be well written, that the steps are in logical order, and that 
they be clear.  Walking people through a couple of examples step by 
step might be good too.  

The other thing to remember is that the bulk of RPGers now are going 
to have access to a spreadsheet.  High Guard is infinitely easy to throw 
onto a spreadsheet (heck I did on Practicalc on the old C-64, back in 1984).  
A modified High Guard style system, with better coverage for sensors and 
screens, and breakouts as far as range, should be a bare minimum.  I 
think that Book 2 is so simple that most non-Traveller RPGers would 
take 1 look at it, sniff, and buy something else instead... 

:-(

Actually, if IG is listening, why not take the time to design, or have
somebody design some sort of a software supplement to design star
ships.  Most people could probably run some sort of a DOS utility. 
You could offer it as a supplement to the "Starships" book for $14.95
or $19.95 or so...

Don,

I applaud you for soliciting and listening to opinions.  I think that 
you, Marc Miller, and everybody else, stand a great chance of not 
only designing the next Traveller, but probably the BEST Traveller.  
Keep up the good work.

Dave, good work and lots of good caffeine.

Guess I better start reading FF&S.

I would like to know if Don Perrin and Greg Porter have discussed issues
concerning the use of FF&S Lite in the design of starships for MMT. If Greg
does not know what Don is planning and vice versa, then we will have a two
different systems one for starships and another for vehicles/personal
weapons. What that will mean to the referee and players is this:

Player: I firing my Gavit Fairfax 50, on full burn at the hatch to breech
the lock.

Referee: Hmm taking the "fifties" DV converting to Dam/pen, throwing salt
over left shoulder, running the Pentium 166 to factor in variables, looking
up four different tables in two different books and seven pages, takes four
asprin, swallows with a pint of bitter, finally decides on flipping a coin,
"heads it breeches, tails the gun blows up".

I for one WILL not buy a game system that one has to go thru anything like
the above. I have not seen any input from Greg Porter concerning starship
design using FF&S Lite. Despite what some people think the starship and
vehicle/personal weapons systems have to in sync. I also do not believe in
"Let Greg Fix that issue/problem that FF&S has" attitude in order to get
FF&S lite into the Don\'s deadline. 

I want a QUALITY product if it is late so be it. If it is going to a half
baked, mu-quark nightmare, fix it later product, I will not be a buyer.

IMHO FF&S and FF&S Lite have too many issues/problems that HAVE to
addressed/deal with before either can be considered into the MMT/T4 design
sequence. I do not believe that the issues/problems can be adequately
resolved before the Don deadline. People have stated that the crew size has
been resolved, but no one has posted it to the list lately for the rest of
the list(s). The starship design system and the vehicles/personal weapons
design system HAVE to be as seamless as possible.

Does anyone have Greg Porter\'s email address, and would you post it. I will
ensure that the last week\'s messages concerning FF&S lite starship design
will get to him.

More importantly, Ship Construction, Weapon Design, and The Combat System
go hand in hand.  If the core rules are going to be based off of a CT/HG
based combat system does FF&S as it stand work?  I am buying a role playing
system.  If the combat system doesn\'t work, my players arnt going to play.
20 Years of evolution doesn\'t mean things have to be more complex.  They have
to be error free, game balanced, and usable.  The differnt parts have to have continutity between them.

Er..um...so, are you saying the system proposed by David Golden is too 
abstract, or are you echoing my agreement that David has a good system?  
Your post seems to have a tone of disagreement, but I thought you were in 
support of David\'s system...

Here here!!  If this kind of behavior keeps up there is bound to be some
fantastic products in production.  There is noting like some good market
research.  (so quoth my wife the economist!)

Ain\'t it the truth!  As an engineer (by trade) I can tell you that the
design process usually goes from simple to complex, BUT when using an
abstract system to design components (such as bearings, which are usually
selected from a catalog) the detailed work must have already been done.
This is just another example of real world common sence bearing itself out
within a game.

Reality check . . .
My players (for the most part) are about as non-technically inclined as they
come.  These folks probably some of the best role players I\'ve ever met
though.  They are however always asking about what capabilities the
machinery has.  Megawatts are something real, somewhat tangible, and provide
an excellent scale for  comparison.  Besides, my players provide some
interisting technobabble :>)

by the way, I hope the new game system makes combat somewhat more deadly.
Having seen real life combat, I tend to believe that it is something that
should not be entered into lightly.  In TNE, I started using a D-20 for
damage dice.  This made the fighting much more deadly, and forced my players
to consider other options before starting a fight.  (just like real life.)

Its just a thought.

position I have already taken! :), I want to say once again that I fully 
support the vision that David Golden has articulated.

I think his idea of a high-level design system based on the low-level 
FF&S system is a good one, given that the high-level system will be 
comprised mostly of menu-like tables from which the user can pick and 
choose options and put them together without much beyond some addition, 
subtraction, and a bit of multiplication.  I think the completeness of 
this system will be welcomed by new players (which was my primary concern 
in the determination of which system to use).  

BTW, I believe the whole confusion over where I stand is my own fault.  
In the last public exchange I had with David, I allowed my thought 
processes to show through.  That is, the first few quote/reply sections in 
the message were dissenting, while the end of the message had quote/reply 
sections that were in agreement.  I was trying to show /why/ I had 
changed my mind, since I had initially been opposed to the FF&S Light 
system.  I didn\'t want to look like I was just jumping on the bandwagon, 
because that was not the case.  At any rate, I am very sorry for the 
confusion, and I hope this message clears it up.  I want to get beyond 
the argument and into the development stage! :-)

This is an exciting time to be a Traveller enthusiast, and I\'m glad to be 
among so many people who not only share my interest, but who have a lot 
of knowledge and ideas that are being put to use so we can all have the 
best Traveller yet.

The lists are:

    2300ad@mpgn.com / 2300ad-digest@mpgn.com
    twilight2000@mpgn.com / twilight2000-digest@mpgn.com
    darkconspiracy@mpgn.com / darkconspiracy-digest@mpgn.com

To subscribe to one of these lists, send mail to:

    majordomo@mpgn.com

and in the body say:

   subscribe listname email address

example:

   subscribe twilight2000-digest bubba@bubba.org


Regarding uploads:

   Tantalus Inc. doesn\'t mind any fan created materials for Dark Conspiracy, 
Twilight 2000, or 2300AD. You may do so as long as it meets the following
critera:

1. It has to contain a disclaimer.  See ftp://ftp.mpgn.com/DISCLAIMER.TANTALUS
   For text documents, the disclaimer needs to appear at the top of the 
   document.  For programs, it needs to appear on any title/splash screen or
   About box.

2. Tantalus Inc. would like you to upload it to ftp.mpgn.com in the /incoming 
   directory. Then send mail to ftp-maint@mpgn.com that you have uploaded it 
   and its for one of the systems listed here (which this isn\'t bad advice for 
   any upload) and upload a .submission file.  A template for the .submission file 
   can be downloaded from ftp://ftp.mpgn.com/incoming/template.sub.  After its 
   reviewed to make sure its cool (i.e. you haven\'t scanned in the books, its not 
   offensive etc.), MPG-Net will put it out for public access.

3. If you have a web page for your product, or gaming, or other appropriate
   content, please include a link to our site http://www.mpgn.com.

Now for the products themselves, I really don\'t have any answers so asking
isn\'t going to do much good.

Actually, I think they should go with the FFS approach, where there were 
\'official\' technologies (e.g., jump drive), but unofficial variants.  The 
answer to the problem of variants unbalancing things is simple: (1) don\'t use 
them in your campaign; (2) make them a very high tech level.

Would this entail additional equipment/fittings (like the HAIS concept) to 
reduce crew size, or would this be simplified into a (variable) larger volume 
devoted to computers and electronics?  Either one seems workable; I suspect the 
Gearheads will prefer the separate HAIS equipment, while the High Guardians 
will prefer a higher overall electronics volume.

It would be good if this could be done in multiple levels.  For example, a 
yacht or hunting/vacation ship might have near-total automation to preserve the 
guests\' solitude, a big MegaCorp freighter might have less automation to save 
on robot maintenance costs (but enough to keep crew costs down), and a military 
vessel might have little automation to retain flexibility in combat.

PS - Combining all of the USP weapon values into one value would be WAY too 
oversimplified.  Please avoid this if at all possible.

Good luck on your task.

Absolutely.  The format used to create starship and generally adventure in
CT and MT was a system that while created in a wonderfully interesting
setting forced the players and GM\'s to play inspite of the rules.  THere
seemed to be little rhyme or reason on how equipment worked or if there was
any kind of physical reality that it was based on.

PLAYER:  What is it?

GM:  Its a small back box 25cm by 25cm by 10 cm.

PLAYER:  And when I push the button?

GM:  You trigger a magnitude 10 earthquake that quickly sends the planet
back to the stone age.

PLAYER:  How did it do that?

GM:  Ummmmmm...  Its a sonic. . . no metaphysical. . . no hyperdynamic ...
awww crap, just trust me it flattens the planet.

What kind of a system is that to play in?  Things have to possess some kind
of hard physics behind them, even if the physics are far further advanced
than ours they still need to have some kind of logic behind them.

Truthfully, having studied forensic\'s and having to watch numerous FBI and
local police video\'s on the lethality of gunshot wounds I"ve come the the
conclusion that generally speaking gunshots are only slightly more deadly
than they are portrayed in TNE and not nearly as effective as the average
person tends to beleive.  Short of being peppered with ammunition, ie.
shotgun or fully automatic gunfire, nine time out of ten its a lucky bullet
that kills an individual.

Case in point.  THe FBI had a fugitive trapped in a small area, the fugitive
started firing at the FBI, who in return fired back.  THis went on for
several minutes before the individual got into a car and sped off.  Ten
blocks later the suspect dropped dead.  He\'d been shot over thirty five
times causing apparently minor damage, the thirty-sixth shot had penetrated
the individuals heart causing him to die.  This fellow was shot with .38\'s,
.45\'s, 9mm\'s and shotguns.

As I said its usually the lucky bullet which kills an individual.  The human
body is an amazingly resiliant piece of equipment and bullets do really
strange thing when they encounter it.

Second point.  An individual in LA had been targeted by a gang for death.
The gang members got a hold of this fellow tied him up.  Shot him in both
knee caps, in the chest, in the mouth and through the forehead.  He walked
away after they left.  The attending surgeons couldn\'t beleive this guys
luck.  None of the bullets, fired close enough to leave powder burns on the
mans flesh, had hit any major organs.  In fact the shot to the head had
penetrated between the eyes bounced right and left a groove around the
interior of his skull before exiting at the exact point of entrance.

Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction.

True, but that\'d be an extreme density anyway.  The real question is
this:  When do the chances of hitting a rice grain and being destroyed
start to bother you, or your passengers, or your insurance company?

As for the game use...

Knowing how your armor withstands such stuff would help to answer this
question.  Knowing things like the (as you point out) the local density
of such dust also helps.  It adds flavor and hooks, as well----your ship
has weak armor, so your insurance premiums go up when you decide to
operate in certain systems.  The system ship traffic control beakons
warn of a local increase in IPM density due to a recent comet close
flyby----keep velocity relative to mainworld below 100km/s.

Repulsors would work well for armor in this case... they can stop dense
particles (missiles) moving at 100s of km/s.  We could get a ball park
figure then on how fast a "typical" nasty dust particle could be
deflected.

system. Don agrees, and he says the coordination will happen. Worst comes to

        Sorry, I thought I\'d explained my thinking. The "Crew Factor" listed
in my tables is the FF&S crew the system needs. FF&S, being written for TNE
with Virus, assumes automation is very low and unintelligent. A simple
fractional multiplier would then be used to reduce that crew factor down for
more automated ships. This tweak doesn\'t invalidate FF&S, it just expands on it.

I\'ve been calling it "hyper-space", but I like "Fractional Jump space"
much better!  It links Jump and Maneuver Drive tech together and with
gravtics as well.  Now the whole tech structure can be grouped around
gravity control, I *like* this.

Ooh!  Neat!  I\'ve *been* doing it like this:  MDrive is internal, it
injects mass at near c into a small hyper-space area where it
translates into velocities of >200c accelerating the ship.  So my
drive isn\'t reactionless, but the reaction mass is *very* small
compared to \'realistic\' rockets.  The mass leaves the area re-emerging
into N space behind the ship as a swarm of quarks releasing energy as
a blue glow.

I\'ll probably change "hyper space" to "fractional J space" (fjs), and
inject gravitons rather than simple matter.  Hum, I might still want
to inject mass and use the gravtics to *create* the opening into
fjs..there are good role playing elements in needing mass onboard for
movement through N space.

One more point...Velocity limits!

I ran into the planet killer shuttle early on, and have squashed
that..effect.  Here\'s my solution, see how it strikes you...

Acceleration by ships is at several hundred g, but maximum velocity is
limited to between 10 and 20 million kph, depending on a number of
factors:  TL, engineering skill, Mdrive quality. I do this by giving
the "hyperspace" field area (now fjs) an inherent drag,  (In fact,
this drag effect is how I explain the time in jump space too, so fjs
fits even better!) that limits speeds.  Maintaining speed requires
continuing thrust (continuing to use up mass).  If you leave the fjs
field on (requiring power), but cut thrust you\'ll decelerate toward
zero relative over several hours.  If you turn off the fjs field, you
would maintain the velocity you\'d built up...except the way I do it
<g> the fjs field once created will persist for over an hour after you
turn it off slowing you down anyway.  Fast deceleration requires
flipping over and producing counter thrust.

Effect:  Ships in space can go from 0 relative to a max velocity of
10-20 million kph during about an hour of acceleration.  They can
travel across a system maintaining that velocity by continuing thrust. 
Nearing their destination, they can
decelerate and match orbital velocities.

Jumps can only be initiated at great distances from stellar
objects..generally >2AU.  Ships leave jump space only *very* near a
stellar massed object.  It takes a slow merchant ship a little over 24
hours to get from where it jumps in to where it can jump out. Fast
ships (fast merchants, scouts, couriers, warships) can cut the time
down to 12 to 16 hours.  This forces ships to stay in system for
extended periods..with all the danger that could entail.  It makes gas
giant refueling less useful..it takes a long time to get out to the
outer system.  Ships are more likely to seek water/hydrogen on planets
instead of trying to get it from the outer system.  I compensate for
the extra time a ship spends in a system by making the time in jump
space a little shorter, ~150 hours and 10% less for each jump level
less than the drives max rating.  EX:  J3 drive - jump3 takes ~150hr,
jump2 takes ~135hr, jump1 takes ~121hr.

I know this doesn\'t match canon, but it\'s the way I do it, and it
works nicely.

        Actually, I was planning on neither ... what I\'m thinking of as
automation isn\'t mechanical stuff that fixes things, etc. It\'s software that
enhances the ability of the user, and hence doesn\'t really add space.

Example: Now, instead of having a guy sitting in front of a radar screen, a
guy sitting in front of an infrared scanner, a third guy monitoring the
optical telescope -- you pipe a processed, enhanced and interpreted image
combining all three to one guy (sensor fusion).

Or, instead of having a dozen people monitoring dumb readouts in engineering
to baby the power plant, you\'ve got one guy with his feet up on the
terminal, watching the computer watch the system

Why am I thinking along these lines? It\'s much simpler and quicker to
implement than coming up with new rules for controls, etc, and it extends
FF&S without changing any of the existing FF&S rules. In the same manner you
can say Einsteinian physics didn\'t change Newtonian -- it merely addressed
an area not covered by Newtonian.

Not that I\'m opposed to new rules -- we\'re in a time crunch here. If
somebody can pull up the HAIS rules (I\'ve lost them), and integrate them
into the existing FF&S rules, I\'ll slap them in and go to bat for them. But
they\'ve got to be something we can pull back out, just like we can take the
crew multipliers back out, if we have to.


<BRAINFLASH>
        Duh... if I\'m talking about multiplying the crew numbers as an
"extension" to the rules, we can also multiply the basic control system
numbers by a factor ... say, for example, at TL12, each 10% increase in size
in the basic control system gives you a 5% reduction in crew requirements.

        Anybody wanna take this & run with it?

As for redesign try this
Lasers

Damage Value

2.5(sqrt(DE(1/r^2)\\) to arrive at FF&S Damage value.

I for one would not care to convert one design to another even with

Penetration scale:

Hmm let test this out with a example

The Starship "Go For it" has landed at the starport "Ty Me Down". After
having a dispute with planetary authorities the ship attempts to lift off
without permission.

The locals bring out the "Dorkbruiser" Superheavy Assault Tank mounting a
555 Mw Gatling Partical Beam weapon. The "Dorkbruiser" is armored with 100mm
of Hemostatic Crystallized Feldercarb. The Bruiser has Mu-Quark Nightmare
Integrated Sensor Fire Control System with optional beer cooler.

Meanwhile the "Go For It" unlimbers it\'s 300 Mj Laser Barbette with a it\'s
own MFD and beam pointer!!! The ship has a Armor Value of 100 in Superdense
Armor.

Gee now the Bruiser\'s weapon has pen/damage of 45/67 versus 1cm of
Feldercarb armor, the 300 Mj Laser Barbette has pen of...

Well you could see a worst case situation.

But can I still make a laser that will critical something bigger than
1000 tons that is smaller than a MG that does the same?  If so, it
doesn\'t work.  We need a solution that limits the DE absolutely so that
lasers are kept only as small weapons.  Anything else smashes all canon
to bits where space weapons are concerned.

The TL*50 DE limit could be explained (technobable coming, duck!) as
follows:

Grav Focused:
Grav focused lasers need to have as small a focal area as possible since
the micro-singularity (or damn steep gravity gradient) used to focus
requires 
the light to be near the optical axis----this ain\'t a mirror!

DE is the actual energy going through the focusing array, IE is mostly
used (80% in fact!) to create the gravity gradient required to focus
light (a non-trivial task).  TL*50 characterizes the ability for the
grav-focusing array to do its job.

I\'d be willing to allow them to work at higher DEs, but have them drop
off so fast after TL*50 that they are useless for ship mounted (even
Mton ships) weapons.

Normal Focusing:
Non-grav focused is harder since as Upton states, it\'s the energy
density on the mirror/lens that will be the limit (too much and a tiny
mote will make your optics blow up).  Would it help to rewrite his idea
as DE/area?  I\'d rather see it work this way, but we still need a TL
addition (we make better optics for this now than we did 20 years ago).

One, the limit should be on DE.  If the optics are what\'s absorbing
energy, the thing is fried----hey!  Assume it is the optics!  Require
heat sinks for energy above some density that the optics could take (TL
dependant).  Above this energy density (ROF included here!) you need to
get rid of waste heat on the optics, and fast.  A tiny change in the
shape of the optics and you miss the target, much more and you burn off
the reflective coating (how much of a wave by TL15?).

So what we do is that above this threshold we require a big heat sink,
and it gets bigger fast enough that at TL*50 the thing uses straight
FFS, at TL*55 it\'s impossible to conduct the heat away, and have some
value for inbetween (or just say that for work-a-day uses the gains
aren\'t worth the reduction in FA life (plus the maint. headaches!).

Actually, this would be the worst thing they could do...at least for 
the purposes of developing the (OH GOD IT\'S THAT WORD AGAIN!) canon.  
Nobody is going to buy into a universe that has two different (and 
in some cases diametrically opposed) assumptions on which to base its 
universe... 

I have to admit that I hate the HEPlaR concept, but I\'d rather live 
with it than have 2 explanations.  As far as having alternate 
technologies at a high (read Beyond Imperial Maximum) tech level, its great, but only as long as the 
alternate technology does something spectacular for me.  If I\'ve 
bought a TL15 ship, with Thruster technology, and I stumble upon an 
Ancient artifact ship that\'s TL21, but has HEPlaR that creates the 
same speed, I\'m not exactly going to get excited...

        After talking to you about this, I actually sat down and looked at
what kinds of tables would be required. I\'m now thinking this may not be
such a good idea ... it drives the table size _way_ up. Now, for each
combination of displacement, configuration, streamlining and armor you\'ve
got to have a separate line. For a given configuration you could need up to
12 lines for each displacement (3 streamlining options * 4 armor options).
Then add in the fact that all the stats vary depending on TL -- for each TL,
you need a column for mass, volume, and price. Ignoring the high (TL 16+)
band, that\'s 4 brackets times three columns each -- 12 columns in addition
to the column listing displacement, armor, streamlining, volume, and area.
This is something that has to fit into 15-20 pages.

        I compared four different methods of presenting hull tables; all are
posted on the Web site. The most flexible one, which allows variable armor
and streamlining, only requires a single calculation more than High Guard.
Unless somebody really opens my eyes, I think that\'s the way to go.

        A later supplement, or perhaps a Web supplement, could present some
predesigned hulls for use with Light. There\'s absolutely no reason there
couldn\'t be a mess of additional stuff ready by GenCon ... how many people
out there have FF&S?

        Unfortunately, there\'s not much that I can do about it. All I\'m
going to do is plug the standard FF&S weapons into the tables, and assume
that if they\'ve changed somebody at Imperium Games has the new stats. If
nobody does, then obviously they can\'t have been changed.

    'body' => 'Ok, here are some thoughts on possibilities:

Traveller fusion plants seem to use some sort of magnetic confinement
(as opposed to inertial confinement). And as researchers have learned
the hard way, there are *definite* scaling problems with the magnetic
fields. For a given type of magnetic field setup there is actually a
minimum size at which you can make a reactor work! If you try building
one smaller than that, you get losses of plasma that prevent operation,
long before you get to the fusion temperature and pressure ranges. 

So you add subsidiary magnetic fields, to help "stabilize" the plasma.
But the new configuration has its own scaling problems. 

So all that is really needed is for the Vilani to have made a
breakthrough in finding a new field configuration that has acceptable
leakage rates and acceptable stability at less than 100 ton sizes.

For what it is worth, reseaerchers did some calcs *years* back on the
minimum size required for a workable "magnetic mirror" (ie long
cylindrical magnetic field, like you\'d get from a *huge* solenoid type
coil) and simple torus (field bent into a "donut" shape). As I recall a
magnetic mirror reactor would work just fine if you were willing to
make it 10 *miles* long. And a toroidal reactor would work fine at 8
miles in diameter. (If we wanted to get *really* "gearhead" we could
allow for scaling bonuses at such sizes :-)

Another possibility is muon-catalyzed fusion. If you inject megative
muons (mu mesons) into the plasma, they replace electrons, and allow
the protons to get *much* closer. This gives you fusion at *much* lower
temps and pressure. The problem is generating the muons. By any chance
woul TL-12 be the level at which the meson gun first shows up? If so,
that would tie in nicely. The same breaktrough that allows the meson
gun would also allow the smaller reactors. Even if meson guns show up
at TL-11, it\'d still work, you just say that it took another TL worth
of developement to make it suitable for use in a reactor instead of a
weapon.

Either of the above (revolutionary new field config, or muon catalyzed
fusion) should do as "fusion plus".

as I\'ve stated before, I\'ve ref\'d this game since \'79, love the FF&S
rules, but they are to time consuming. A quicker alternative design
process is req\'d.

No.  I guess I misinterpreted what you wrote.  I have no opposition

Actually, what David proposes is just about what I was hoping for,

I am mostly over my predisposition against it. :)  I wish IG had time to 
let the gearheads and others fix the problems with FF&S, though.  That\'s 
my only remaining reservation...and it won\'t prevent me from buying the 
new FF&S whenever it comes out.

There is already a computer modifier for the amount of crew. Why not
decrease the values (Control Modifier). Or include another modifier

Here\'s a crack at pseudo-science:

How about quantitized micro-scale black holes replacing the standard
high-enegry laser containment fields. The micro-scale black holes offer
denser containment properties (and require less shielding) but because
of Quantum effects produce nearly the same output. ie. equivalent
output for less volume.

Pseudo enough for you?

Two comments from above. Guess I\'m a tech-head, but...

Just because the sensors can locate a target does not mean that the
weapon is pointed at the target. beam pointers correlate the target\'s
sensor-derived position with the position that the beam is pointing at.
Your radar can find the guy, but the laser may not be pointing at the
same position. I feel that you should not have a beam pointer
requirement if the weapon is integrated with a Master Fire Director.
The MFD integrates sensors and control to perform the beam pointing
task. A beam pointer is required for non-integrated systems. (such as
those manned by a PC in the turret)

Second, the early Apollo missions used liquid hydrogen as the
combustion chamber coolant. That is at tech level 5,6,7? With heat
exchange technology improvements of advanced tech levels, keeping the
coolant a liquid should be easy enough.

more pseudo science.

You are absolutely right!  I\'ve been proposing a 4 level approach
(Pre-gened, Simple, Medium, Complex) the whole time.  The 3 level
(Pre-gen, Simple, Complex) approach creates a tug-of-war between easy
of use and functionality than WE CAN\'T WIN.

Basic Rules:  A few Pre-gened ships and a VERY simple design
              system for only a few small ship types with very
              simple plug together modules.  (Keep it down to 3
              pages max for the design sequence AND THE TABLES,
              and one page for 2 examples...maybe Don could
              squeeze that in!)

STARSHIPS:  Lots of Pre-gened ships and a Moderate design system
            (like QSDS or FFSL) with mostly plug in parts, but
            more functions, more sizes and types.  Here\'s where
            most military oriented stuff comes in!

FF&S redux:  A complete design system for everything from soup to
             nuts.

That\'s my Level 2!

Then Level 3 could be a *little* more complex than HG.

Yes!!!

Simplify until it\'s way too simple for you!  Then it\'s still to
complex for the beginner, so simply some more!

..and David, please try to convince Don to put the simplest sequence
in the Basic Rules.  There are going to be lots of complaints it the
rules don\'t have any ship building rules at all.  I remember thinking,
"what a rip!", when I went through TNE and found no ship design rules
at all.

Although I\'m not convinced that David\'s system will be too complex (heck, 
how I can I be...there isn\'t enough on the web site yet), I would love 
for the basic rules to have a ship design system.  The basic rules should 
be everything that is needed to play Traveller in every sense of the 
word.  I would no more advocate leaving ship design out and having only a 
dozen or so predesigned ships than I would advocate leaving world 
generation out and putting in a few dozen pregenerated worlds.  

If this means whittling the system down to what you describe, then so be 
it!  I still think David\'s system will have broad appeal and will 
probably be purchased by 75% of Traveller referees.  But if it is too big 
or complex for the basic rules, then put something small and easy enough 
in there!  Please!

Oh!  Just thought of something: the suggested marketing ploy of adding a 
mini version of Traveller to the back of books would require such a 
small-scale system as you are advocating.  I really think 
back-of-the-book Traveller is a great idea (read: marketing ploy), and 
this would increase the chances of that actually happening (unless, of 
course, Marc and/or IG is completely opposed to it ;).

opens up a hole into jump space and the thrust is output there?  The 
reaction mass travels at some huge velocity in jump space and thus very 
little of it is needed to get huge amounts of thrust.  Some 
version/part of the reaction mass comes back as energy (some of it 
being short wavelength light or something that breaks down into SWL, to 
give that beautiful blue glow).  Works for me, though it of course 
violates lots of laws :-).

Another possibility would be to have m-drives be "warp drives".  They
expand the space behind the ship while contracting it in front of the
ship, and the ship "surfs" the wave of expanding space.  There is a more
official name for this type of drive, but I can\'t remember it.  I do
remember that it has been mentioned as one of the few ideas for FTL 
travel that sorta fits with modern physics.  However, there\'s no reason 
(I think) that this sort of idea couldn\'t be used for slower than light.  
You can just put some sort of arbitrary limit on it (this is 
pseudo-science after all) and say that it can provide no more than 6g 
acceleration, but that it does so with high efficiency.  Since the ship 
is not actually accelerated through space, there is no violation of laws 
of conservation.

    'body' => 'Hi David.  I admire your dedication to this project.  Keep it up!  I 
would like to make a few (hopefully helpful) suggestions:

	The first is a reminder to keep things simple.  I like what your
doing so far, but you should be wary of the temptation to complicate
things.  Remember that something you design always seems really simple to
you, but may not be to others.  Some possibilities you might want to
consider (not being an FFS aficionado, I\'m not sure if these are feasible,
but here goes...): 

SIMPLIFYING SUGGESTIONS

1) Regarding the problem of hull armor and bracing for thrust.  Could you 
not simply declare a certain minimum armor value for a certain thrust 
value?  Or are bracing and armor seperate?

2) Why can\'t jump fuel just be 10% of the ship\'s volume per parsec?

3) When assigning crew, why not include their quarters with the 
components as you buy them?  For instance, if you just installed 200 tons 
of drives, why not have a "mini step" afterwards in which you put in 
staterooms for the 2 engineers that will be required (or 1 room if ship 
is military).


FUSION PLUS SUGGESTION

	I\'m no phsicist, but aren\'t there a number of different fusion
reaction types (e.g. deuterium-deuterium, dueterium-tritium), and don\'t
these have different efficiencies?  Perhaps the d-d reaction is too
inefficient and plants below a certain size don\'t provide appreciable
amounts of energy.  But when one masters d-t reactions, one can get good
energy out of even a small plant.  The above is sort of sketchy, but maybe
someone with more a physics background can fill it in. 


MANEUVER DRIVE LIMITS

	On your web page you expressed a problem with the 6 g limit,
saying that it seems quite arbitrary.  Also, people have frequently
complained about the huge upper limit of velocity for ships with thruster
plates.  I have a suggestion that might solve both problems.  I was
thinking that t-plates might be thought of as slower-than-light "warp
drives" (there\'s a more official name, but I can\'t think of it right now). 
These drives expand space behind a ship and contract it in front, allowing
the ship to "surf" the wave of expanding space behind it. 

	This drive concept has been put forth in various fairly reputable
places as one of the few ideas for FTL travel that doesn\'t violate modern
physics (more or less), but I don\'t see why it could not be used as the
basis of a maneuver drive.  One simply has to put arbitrary limits on it. 
Normally, I don\'t like arbitrary limits, but since this is
quasi-scientific anyway, it should be a little easier to take.  The
handwaving explanation could be something like "the fabric of space/time
will not tolerate expansion /contraction rates above a certain limit, and
thus 6 g is all the thrust one can get out of such a drive".  This also
allows one to put an uppper limit on the speed of the ship with "the
expansion/contraction limits also place a maximum of .1 C on the speed of
a ship using such a drive"  or something like that. 

Hope this helps,
Charles.

Ok, perhaps I should rephrase my statement.  I have been on both ends of the
gun in combat (Saudi to be precise), and yes you do have a point.  HOWEVER,
I would like to point out that the weapons used in your example were PISTOLS
and generaly on the low end of the firepower spectrum.  When dealing with
pistol and smg ammo, (very low kinetic energy, and a typicaly fat stubby
round), VRI (very rapid incapacitation) is typicaly impossible.  My
experience relates more to rifles and machineguns and tanks etc.  I did
witness a "friendly-fire" incident where one of our newbie loaders (we were
tank crews) accidentily shot his buddie in the belly at 2-3 meters with a
.45.  Both of them lived, but the offending private was pretty pale for a
while ;>)  In actuality, the sergeant (who should have had the common sence
to have the private CLEAR the weapon BEFORE training the private) was quite
lucky.  The round passed all the way through without destroying too much.  I
guess it just goes to show you that you can\'t bee too careful.

Seriously though, if you examine the rules (and ignore double damage to the
head) it is possible to be shot in the face with a hunting rifle and live
with only a scratch wound!  (yes, I\'ve also read the reports of people being
shot in the face and living to tell about it, but I\'ve not seen it happen
very often in my thankfuly small experience on the battlefield.  Usually the
poor sap just dies on the spot.)

The other point, is that I would like my players to consider their options
before shooting up the place.  Combat with serious implications helps the
case a bit IMHO.

It is an interesting point though . . . perhaps I should consider using a
D-10 for pistol damage. :>)

Ok, here\'s my two cents worth:

I use the 50MJ/TL limit myself, but the recent unrest has given me an idea.
Allow lasers to be as powerful as spinal mounts IF AND ONLY IF they OCCUPY
AS MUCH SPACE.  This could be done by imposing a variable power limit, as
follows:

base power output:                      25MJ per TL
double focal array size:                50MJ per TL
quad focal array size:                   75MJ per TL

or something similar.  This allows you to have your heavy hitting lasers,
but only if they get really big in the process.  (e.g. the death star and
its planet smashing beam of whatever-it-was-that-it-fired.)  Now this is
just an off the cuff suggestion, please feel free to crush it into something
more usefull.

Just another of my off the wall suggestions, but perhaps the gravitics
technology availability could be moved to TL 12.  I realize that this is NOT
cannon, but think about this for a second:

1.      at TL-12, you can all of the sudden use gravitic confinement for
your fusion reaction, augmented with magnetic fields to stabilize the flow
(or something similar).  something similar to FF&S gravitic compression
fusion cartridge.  (stars use inertial/gravity confined fusion, and they
work just fine)

2.      at TL-12 there is a shift from HEPlaR to Thrusters.  (don\'t shoot me
yet, its just a suggestion)  This gives the fledgling imperium a REAL combat
advantage over all of those  old HEPlaR driven ships with their nasty fuel
requirements, and reinforces the mad rush to sign on with the imperium.
This works only if the thruster plates are a gravitic technology.  

3.      at TL-12 artificial gravity becomes feasable aboard ship.  (those
imperials are looking like a better option all the time Ethel...)

I\'ve said it before and I\'ll say it again.  Never ever go to war with a new
guy, they\'re just plain ass stupid.

Absolutly.  Head shots possess the greatest lethality of any and in that
case the double damage rule should always be applied.  While it is not
impossible to walk away from a rifle shot to the brain bucket it is also not
terrible likely.

>The other point, is that I would like my players to consider their options

Again I agree totally with you here.  Players, and I\'ll admit when I\'m a
player I do this on occasion, tend to approach problems with two solutions.
1) The ubiquitious "big hammer approach" and 2) the often encountered bigger
hammer approach.  Hey after two failed attempts at lock picking or
negotiating when your GM just doesn\'t want to conceed a point we all feel
like saying.  "Screw it break out the grenade launchers and lets party!"
The thing is as the hero\'s of the game we\'re not supposed to do that.  And I
think that\'s really the point we\'re debaiting here.  HERO\'s  As hero\'s they
have more hit points and can take more damage than the baddies because
they\'re supposed to survive.

This is the best news I\'ve heard in quite some time. Traveller, just like
wargames, went down-hill as complexity increased, no matter what this sur-
vey says.
=======================

I\'m going to continue to follow this list, and support Traveller via my Web
Page, but right now I\'m not even going to think about wasting my money on a
retrograde rule set. If I wanted to play CT or HG, I could already. But I
don\'t and I haven\'t for years.

Just my opinion. Considered comments to the list or to me, flames to

        Originally (in FF&S), because the new maneuver drives required much
more fuel, so the jump drive fuel was scaled way down. Since thruster plates
are back, the jump fuel probably will go back up.

        I still think even basic designers will want some flexibility in
deciding how the accommodations should be arranged -- who gets single
stateroom, who gets double. Plus, the crew listed in the tables is the
*base* non-automated crew. Depending on TL the crew requirements go way
down, and it\'s easiest if you collect them all and do it all at once.

        Thanks for the inputs!

        After talking with Don, we\'re going to go with a simple TL-based
modifier. At TL10, automation really hasn\'t taken off yet, so this is the
basis. By TL15, crews are down to 25% of the basic size -- (do the math) ...
hmmm .... looks like I did the math wrong while I was talking to Don,
because we agreed the crews should be 25% at TL15, and that the rate would
be 10% per TL.

        Are you *sure* I should be coordinating this thing?

        Anyway, that\'s what we\'re looking at. At TL10 (or postVirus), crews
are their full FF&S size, and go down with TL. Simple extension to the FF&S
rules which doesn\'t impact anything else (except accommodations. OK, and
workstations. Accommodations and workstations. That\'s all. Nothing else. And
power. Accommodations, power and workstations ...)

Excuse me, but space is *not* empty, except by comparison to planetary
atmospheres. At sufficiently high speeds, the fairly good vacuum
between planets in a system like ours *is* hazardous to your ship (and
your health). For instance, as you start getting near 1% or so of C,
every single atom out there is effectively a cosmic ray, with all the
attached hazards.

The larger particles are rarer, but do note that we are *already*
having problems with "space junk" in Earth orbit. And that\'s at normal
orbital velocities and rather modest accelerations. With ships that can
boost a several gees for *hours*, you hit velocities where a paint chip
like the one that put that quarter inch crater in one of the Space
Shuttle\'s windows can get *really* dangerous.

A rule of thumb from the sci.space FAQ: At 3 km/sec the kinetic energy
of a body is equivalent to the same mass in TNT!  And since the energy
goes up as the *square* of the velocity, you get this:

velocity	TNT equivalent (mass of TNT/mass of object)
- ----	----
3 km/s		1
6 km/s		4
9 km/s		9
12 km/s		16
15 km/s		25
18 km/s		36

You get the idea. Note that a typical velocity for stuff orbiting at
300 km is almost 8 km/sec. Escape velocity at that altitude is near 11
km/sec. 

Orbital velocity for the Earth is about 30 km/sec. And system escape
velocity is around 42 km/sec. So any space junk in orbit around the
*sun* will have anywhere from 0 to 72 km/sec relative to a ship in the
same orbit. At 72 km/sec an object has the energy of 576 times its mass
in TNT! That means a one kilo object is equivalent to more than half a
*ton* of TNT. At a "median" 30 km/sec, a 10 gram object is equivalent
to a kilo of TNT. There\'s gonna be a *lot* of 10 gram junk out there.

>and there is no such thing as some convenient 
>\'interstellar medium\' that permeates outer space

Better talk to some astronomers. They *study* the interstellar medium.
It may be thin, but it is there.

I do agree about about it not being terribly suitable for something to
push against. But that\'s not what the section you quoted says. It\'s
referring to *protecting* ships from the stuff that\'s out there. And
any ship that can reach CT/MT velocities has a *lot* to worry about. 

For example, if I recall correctly, a Scout from Book 2 can accelerate
at 2gs. And they note somewhere that if you need to worry about
extended use of the drive, assume one *month* of fuel. So, that means
you can accelerate for two weeks at 2gs, then decelerate at the same
rate for another 2.

At that sort of speed, you can pretty much ignore things like stellar
gravity... :-)

So, 2 weeks is 1209600 seconds. At 2 gees, that gives a velocity at
turnover of 24 thousand km/s (8% of c!). And a one gram micro-meteor is
equivalent to 64 tonnes of TNT.

At turnover, the ship will have travelled 14 billion km (about 96 AU!).

BTW, I\'m one of the folks who just *assumed* that the manuever drives
in CT were some sort of *highly* efficient reaction drive. Say
something with an ISP of 500k to 1M.

Slight problem here. 10-20 million kph relative to *what*? Relative to
the planet you left, you may be moving that fast. Relative to every
other object in the universe you are moving at a different velocity.
Relative to a ship going the other way, you may be moving at 20-40
million kph. Relative to various distant galaxies, you are moving at
nearly light speed.

This is the whole *point* of relativity. There *isn\'t* any absolute
frame of reference. So your "inherent drag" is impossible. Because
"drag" means that you are moving relative to FJS. And that means that
you\'ve just created an absolute reference frame, and *worse*, one that
"just happens" to be more or less at rest with respect to this portion
of our galaxy. This has side effects you don\'t even want to *consider*,
even without dragging relativity into it.

This is also why any sort of reactionless drive is such a problem. You
pump in energy, and you get out momentum. The trouble is, momentum
relative to *what*. Y\'see, the change in your velocity is a change in
kinetic energy. But the amount of that change depends on what you
measure your velocity against. With a reaction drive, it isn\'t a
problem because the exhaust has an equal but oppositte change in both
kinetic energy *and* momentum.

But with reactionless thrusters, you can do things that really screw up
the world, or you have to (once again) come up with an absolute frame
of reference. Not good.

If you want an effect *similar* to a reactionless drive, figure that
your drive is a sort of "graviton laser" or some such, and you use it
to push/pull on the "nearby" bodies. This has limits which make it work
a lot differently than the thruster plates though.

Excuse me. But you are a mite confused. The *rules* don\'t define a
universe. The *background* does. 

You can look at it one of two ways:

First, the options are for designing different backgrounds in a
consistent way. This allows people freedom to develop a campaign with a
"different" universe, but still be able to let folks know easily what
the differences are. (ie, "we\'re using fusion drives and stutterwarp,
not thruster plates and jump drive")

This is a lot less disruptive than changing to a campaign that has a
whole new rule set.

Second, it\'s perfectly possible for there to be multiple ways of
accomplishing the same thing. It\'s just that the Terrans and Imperium
(and most others) hit on one way, while there are alternate ways that
they may have missed (it does happen, there are a number of things that
the Greeks *could* have built, it just never occured to them).

This allows for some *real* surprises for the players when they are
exploring unexplored star systems. Picture the Imperium running into
the Klingon Empire or the Romulans. Or running into civilizations
using Stutterwap, Alderson drive, Bussard Ramjets, generation ships,
sleeper ships, near C ships, etc. All of these have *both* sides trying
to deal with a technology that they don\'t understand, and that has
advantages and disadvantages that they are going to find out the hard
way. 

Examples:

Jump drive:
Advantages:
	can\'t be tracked
	can\'t be attacked
Disadavantages:
	100 diameter limit
	one week per jump
	small size of jump

Warp drive:
Advantages:
	no 100 diameter limit
        fast!
disadvantages:
  	can be tracked
	can be attacked

Alderson drive:
advantages:
	jump is instantaneous
disadvantages:
	limited routes
	*known* fixed jump points

I could go on, but just the above should give a creative person some
ideas for *nasty* surprises each side could give the other.

Frank Chadwick wrote an article where he defended the TNE hit and
damage results. The article showed the actual number of hits in a
firefight and the results. I can\'t remember the exact details, but it
was in a Challenge magazine.

I like the damage rules. If medicine healing and recovery are played
right, just the sort of action that was described will result. For
*impact* damage, ie. the shock of the round hitting the target, I like
the roll versus damage for head and chest shots.

Quantum black holes are out, you\'ll find them in old SF stories but the
physics behind them was killed by quantum tunneling by Stephen Hawking. The

 There IS a frame of reference (sort of) in the real world(TM): Solar
systems have stars at their center and the solar wind is moving at
aproximately 5 km/s relative the sun. Ships accelerating for a couple of
days will experience an increased energy from the solar wind particles that
hit. Lideboat doom will need som pretty heavy shielding of drives and
attitude stuff, not to mention sensors to be able to aim at high speed
because of this. In my campaign this solar wind sets a "speed limit" for
intrasystem travel that differs from ship to ship depending on shielding.
SDB can go as fast as they like but they use fusion drives because
thrusterplates show up too much on gravscanners.

: double focal array size:                50MJ per TL
: quad focal array size:                   75MJ per TL
: 
: or something similar.  This allows you to have your heavy hitting lasers,

Technically this works and keeps them limited.  However, I would
decrease the levels a little more to make them a tad weaker than meson
spinal mounts.  The only reason being that in the Traveller universe
the meson gun should be the final word in Big Guns (tm).

Well, those choices are being made _now_ because they replicate the environment
from when the choices were made _then_ (in 1977) when the game was first created.

Since we have no idea what a "far future" empire would be like, I suspect your 
question is closer to "why is the Traveller empire analogous to one of the pre
18th century empires, rather than a modern state?"

And the answer to that is manifold.  First, the colonialist/swashbuckling 
interstellar empire is a staple of much 1950-70\'s science fiction, much of
which inspired Traveller in the first place.  Second, an old-style empire
is a different type of society from the modern one, thus providing an interesting 
change-of-pace for roleplayers.  Third, and again, the technological assumptions
(jump drive, no commo without transportation, etc.) have been made in order to
make as few assumptions as possible and to make those that _are_ made as exciting,
roleplay-inducive, and "realistic"-feeling as possible.

This doesn\'t work.  A good sized turret/barbette laser has a focal array
volume of ***~0.05kl***  it\'d need to grown very much faster than you
list.  Maybe as array volume ^5 or something.

  ... is being compiled by Yours Truly for inclusion in the RICE
  Archives.

  However, I need the jargon to compile, and not just the stuff
  that I make up out of my own head, or that my former gaming group
  used when we played.  I need yours, too.  And yes, that includes
  you all the way in the back waving your hand at me.  Oh, you want
  to know what I mean by jargon?

  That\'s easy.  It\'s the "slang" that\'s not part of standard
  Galanglic as it appears in your particular incarnation of
  Traveller\'s reality (IOTR), and that your players\' characters are
  likely to encounter in the course of adventures.  Shipboard
  slang, ground slang, military slang, all of that is good and
  useful.

  Examples?  Sure - just a few off the top of my head:  In my IOTR,
  a good ship\'s cook is called a "gil", a "gilly", or occasionally
  a "shu-li", all deriving from the old Vilani "shugili", the guy
  who knew the techniques for making edible the inedible plant life
  on Vland.  A "cork" is a nuclear damper, when used to disrupt or
  terminate the output of a power plant that relies on nuclear
  reactions for power production (fission or fusion, hot or cold),
  and using "cork" as a verb is what a "cork" used as a noun does.
  The guy in your crew who always seems to have a knack for
  managing protocol is a "newt", because before it became
  politically correct to call \'em "Bwabs" or "Bwaps", that\'s what
  members of that race were called - and everyone knows that they
  handled protocol like nobody\'s business.  Stuff like that.

  What I\'d like for each entry is the word itself, the part of
  speech, the definition, and the origin, if known.  Set it up like
  it might be in a dictionary.  Don\'t worry about the same word
  having multiple, even contradictory, definitions, or two
  different words having the same definition - after all, "fat
  chance" and "slim chance" mean the same thing, don\'t they?

  Example:

  gil (n) [from Old Vilani "shugili", a food preparer/witch
  doctor/shaman]  (1) A cook, usually one who can create high
  quality meals out of poorer-quality materials

  If you don\'t want to waste space piecemeal here, post to me at
  jeff.zeitlin@execnet.com.  I\'ll whip it all into shape, and put
  it up in the RICE Archives, and post it here all together.

I think Traveller is the best choice because it has always been for Traveller
regardless of era or rules set.  CT and MT posts have always been welcome. 
The only rule was no TNE on Xboat.  I was waiting to see what the game was
going to look like before I tried to urge a direction (which I didn\'t want to
do).  Thanks for taking the time to keep us informed!!!

Agent...whoo hoo!  One of my favorite alternative character types (as 
evidenced by my home-grown advanced generation system for them :).  

The skills list looks excellent.  I just have one suggestion:  I found it 
convenient to create a new skill called Concealment for the Agent 
character, so that they could hide items about their body with some 
skill.  Sure, it\'s better to role-play that out, but such can be said of 
many (if not all) skills on the list.

Thank you for posting this information!

  {
    'body' => 'Hello all,

I finished tabulating the results of the design poll.  Rather than clog 
the mailing list with a million lines of statistical analysis, I would prefer 
to send the information to you individually.  E-Mail me if you want the 
full blown report.  Here are a few general conclusions, to whet your 
appetite (or make you feel grateful I didn\'t post it to the list, depending 
on your point of view).

There were 62 total responses.  The most popular design system 
for starships was FF&S, although it was preferred overall by only 35% 
of total users.  Of those users familiar with the CT & MT systems as 
well as FF&S, that percentage rose to 52%, still only a slim majority 
of total players.  MT was a distant second with about 25%, with High 
Guard at about 20%.  Virtually nobody wants something as simplistic 
as book 2.

Of those players who were not familiar with all 4 systems, the 
majority owned MT & CT, but never bought FF&S.   GDW had a good idea 
in FF&S though, as several players who do not use the TNE background 
still use FF&S as a design system (and presumably TNE rules for 
vehicular/ship  combat.  

Vehicles: 
There was nothing approaching  a consensus on what system was preferred 
for craft design.  Several people who liked FF&S as a ship design 
system expressed a dislike for FF&S as a vehicle design system, and 
many of those expressed a preference for MT.

The breakdown between MT, Striker, & FF&S was as follows:

FF&S: approx. 30%
MT: approx 25%
Striker approx 20%
N/A approx 25%

There was no significant difference in percentage for those who were 
familiar with all 3 systems.  Ironically enough, about 1/4 of the people 
who responded to the poll said that they\'d never used any of the three 
systems to design a vehicle of any type.  Clearly, a Sears catalog of vehicle 
types would satisfy a lot of these people.  An FF&S lite may not be as 
necessary for vehicles as ships.

General Conclusions:
Just about everybody wanted some complexity to ship design.  Book 2 
was familiar to all but 7 of the 62 respondents, and yet only 3 of 
them expressed any desire to still use the system.  FF&S was a 
favorite of the more complex 3 (MT, HG & FF&S), but not by much 
of a margin.  When compared by those who\'d owned all 4 systems, 
FF&S was a majority favorite, but not overwhelmingly so.  A 2 tiered 
approach such as that espoused by Don & Dave would appear to be 
the way to go.  Clearly, there is a market for something as complex as 
FF&S, but it is equally clear that GDW made a mistake when they did 
not release a less complex ship/vehicle design system for those unwilling 
to tackle FF&S.

As far as vehicle design, results are less clear.  FF&S is still a 
favorite, but frankly, there were a number of advocates for MT & 
Striker as well.  FF&S would probably be the way to go, but it may 
need to be tweaked, refined or overhauled to satisfy a number of the 
complaints I heard about it.

My unsolicited and perhaps unneeded advice to IG:

Use a 2 tiered approach for ship design &.  There are a number of 
"gearheads" who love the detail and complexity of FF&S, but there is 
a nearly equal number who still want a certain level of detail, 
without getting into overwhelming complexity.  A Medium Complexity/High 
Complexity step is probably the way to go.

Finally, whatever system winds up going into the ship design rules, 
it is ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL, that these rules be carefully proofread 
and laid out in a logical fashion.  Judging by the responses given to 
the unworkable parts of MT & FF&S, as they were prior to the errata 
fixes, this really hurt GDW.  The number of comments like:  "I tried 
to design a ship using XXX 1st edition, got halfway through and gave 
up, because the rules were poorly written..." comments that I got 
were unbelievable.  It is my opinion that the poorly edited ship 
design and combat rules killed MT they consumed most of the errata 
(other than the Merchant Advanced Character Gen system)..., and they 
turned a few people off from FF&S as well.  In GDW\'s defense, they 
did do a good job of making these 2 systems workable with the error 
corrections, but they lost a lot of people by not releasing a 
finished product to begin with.

Believe it or not, that is a synopsis of the conclusions and data in 
the report.  For the full report, e-mail me at the address below.

I must say that I\'ve continually been annoyed by people who post
to the list cursing Traveller writers, though most focus their
ire on Dave Nilsen.


Now I\'d like to see people being a bit more civil on the list - then maybe 
we would get responses from people like Dave and Loren that arn\'t just
one-line refutations of some hurtful and unhelpful comment.

Eamon Watters. 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I lot of the antipathy towards GDW et al. goes back to when TNE was first
announced & described to this list. You may have read earlier references
to the arrogant attitude that GDW displayed towards subscribers to this
list. I would use the word condescending, myself. When you treat people
in such a fashion it can\'t be surprising that reciprocation occurs, esp.
considering it\'s long been obvious who turned out to be the most accurate 
when predicting the fate of TNE. 

Conclusion? Treat people poorly & you will be treated likewise.

Doesn\'t people from university go for adventure? What\'s about Scientists,
Engineers or Doctors? Or should Scholar be a collective category for them?
But why didn\'t you then also summarize Army, Navy and Marine to (for
example) Soldier? 

>Consolidated Skill List (* indicates Default Skills [see below])

To justify my following critics I\'d like to say that if I\'ve made no
comment, I agree with that skill. The game should have about 50-60 skills,
but not more. Perhaps you should drop one or two skills to lower the number. 

>Archery*

The use of archaic missle or throwing weapons a default skill? I don\'t think so.

>Armorer

Building armor on your own? I would drop this skill in favor of some more
important skil.

>Craftsman

What does a craftsman craft? A baker? a bricklayer? A goldsmith? I would
drop it.

>Environment Combat*

I\'d count special training to the corresponding weapon skill and drop this.

>Equestrian*

Does this skill also include normal riding (for me, it\'s a somewhat unusual
term I had to look up)? Why not call it simple Riding?

>Fencing

A special skill? Why not included in Blade weapon?

>Forward Observer

I never understand what\'s the roleplaying use of that skill. As a general
rule, I would try to distinguish between occupation (or role) skills and
activity skills (more general). To be a forward observer is an occupation
(IMHO) but to be that, you have to be trained in communication, stealth and
to keep cool.

>Gunnery
>Heavy Weapons*

What\'s the difference between these two skills? Isn\'t a cannon a heavy weapon?

>Jack of All Trades

I would drop this skill because experience with old Traveller has show that
this \'Mac Guyver\'-like skill causes lot\'s of problems because it\'s too
advantagerous.

>Melee (Armed)*

That\'s the difference to blade weapon? (What I\'d like to say: think about
building more general skills where blade weapons are a special case)

>Performance (Art)
>Performance (Dance)
>Performance (Drama)
>Performance (Music)
>Performance (Writing)

Nice, but very unimportant for roleplaying in the Traveller millieu, IMHO. Drop.

>Philosophy*

Again. That\'s roleplaying but no player can stat \'my character has just
created a new meanful philosophic statement because I rolled successfully
against philosophy. GM, think about something like "I know that I know nothing"\'

>Psionicology (an academic endeavor)

Oh, that\'s a real improvement. Good.

>Research*

Can you research something independ from a scientific discipline? As far as
I know, no German university teach general research but you only learn
researching together with all other knowledge of the specific discipline.

>Surface Vehicle*

Including boats that swim on the water\'s surface? :-) (What\'s about Ground
vehicle?)

Btw, will the basic rules book also cover alien races? Does they have
special skills which have to be considered?


For my game, I use own rules (based on Forgotten Futures) with the following

        Well, despite all the Politically Correct "let\'s get rid of violence
in roleplaying games" some people *like* military adventures. Doesn\'t mean
they\'re going to hole up on a farm in Montana or anything; it\'s simply exciting.

>to keep cool.

        There\'s quite a bit more than that. You have to know ballistics, be
familiar with the performance of all the kinds of weapons your military
uses, know their effects and how to employ them, you have to know the
tactics and the procedures of whoever is doing the shooting (artillery,
aircraft, ship), you have to be skilled in recognizing all enemy *and*
friendly vehicles.

        Being able to communicate is important, but you could be the world\'s
best communicator and be *worthless* as a forward observer if you didn\'t
know *what* to look for, how to interpret it, and what to tell the firing unit.

        Sneaking around has nothing to do with being a forward observer,
although in some situations it may be helpful. Air Force forward observers
in airplanes aren\'t exactly inconspicuous, for example.

        Keeping cool applies to just about everything.

        I would think that forward observer would be a skill limited to
either low-tech armies or the equivalent of Special Forces units...  Given
that militaries as primitive and low-tech as late 20th century American
forces <grin> show a remarkable trend towards recon drones, satellite
observation, and the like, wouldn\'t higher-tech militaries tend to use even
more sophisticated variants on the same approach?  I\'m not saying that F-O
would be an obsolete skill, just that its usefulness would be limited to
(relatively rare?) situations where hi-tech means would be useless or
unavailable.

into whence they came and very rapidly, that way you wouldn\'t have do deal

fine, it\'s your gazillion million credits. Thrusters woudl work the same way
as they ever did, except the won\'t be reactionless. They HAVE a reaction but
its on our side. Thruster plates become technology reserved for races which
have jump drives. If you wish to further limit the maximium velocity of
thruster plates, then make assumed generalizations about the maximum
emission of the quasi-particles from the skin. And now you have to worry
about mass when figuring out your M drive and surface area...hmmm, maybe I
haven\'t thought this out as well as I thought...but I really think I am

Where do energy weapons of various kinds fit into this framework?
Are they subsumed by the Handgun/Rifle skills?  I would hope not,
as I think there is a good case for keeping them distinctive.

Are they to be held over to a supplement to the main rules?

Or am I just being pedantic and picky and I should just assume
that they will be included under gun combat?

Hi all,

Thanks for posting this and allowing a sneak preview at the skills in T4.
One omission I found in the skills was on related to Geology. I think this
is one of the fundimental sciences, along with Physics, Chemistry, Biology
and Astronomy. Geology would be of use to a Scout character when they are
dealing with the mineral resources of a planet, assessing the weather
patterns and climate. This could be covered in the Survey skill, but to me
this is more about how to get the information, the use of sensors and there
deployment.

Hope this is of some use.


Thanks in advance,

Because, like it or not, Traveller always has and always will have a
higher proportion of military characters than a true cross section of
Imperial culture would have.

Why?  Most referee\'s are just going to end up devising new skills anyways,
why remove "one or two" to satisfy some arbitrary limit?

It is a good rollplaying skill.  Someone with a high craftsman skill would
have income to fall back on, or might be hired by some noble to perform
some work.

Ummm...gunnery applies to ship turret and bay weapons, heavy weapons to
ground based weapons.  Big difference in paradign and operation.

*very* important to some people.  what if someone wanted to roleplay a
famous writer who decided to travel and seek adventure to write his
greatest work.  Or a skilled actor who seeks anonynimnity in the stars,
dissolusioned by life under the lights...the list goes on.  No need to be
so closed minded.

No, but the referee can use the skill to judge if a character would know
about a particular race\'s philosopy, or that of a given system.

The ability to research is independant of any scientific discipline.  Ask
anyone in the research dept. at a big newspaper.

Inquiring minds want to know!!  I for one think aliens would perhaps best

You could say this about any profession that would be around in the 5000th
century.  Where are the computer programmers, law enforcement (not quite the
same as Agent), Wet Navy, Air Force, etc.  The plain and simple truth is
Marc wants to keep the number of classes low for the basic game.  That
doesn\'t mean we wont have a "Citizens of the Imperium" like supplement later.

Why not consolidate Army Navy and Marines?  Well this is a Sci-Fi game, and
in most sci-fi settings, the military represents a large portion of
\'importants\' of the genre.  Particularly with the Imperium\'s natural ability
to engage in wars, that is one area where consolidation is not practical,
and its not CT compatiable.  Law Enforcment, Bounty Hunters, etc can be
consolidated into Agent.  Scientist, Computer Programmers, Doctors, can be
consolidated into Scholor if necessary, but you can be a Noble Doctor, or a
Navy Doctor as well.

>>Archery*
>The use of archaic missle or throwing weapons a default skill? I don\'t
think >so.

I don\'t consider my self to have an Archery skill, but I can certanly pick up a
bow and have a reasonable chance of hitting a target.  I think that more skills 
should be defaults.  There are a lot of these skills that I (In real life)
would classify my self as a skill level of 0.  Not good enough to be a 1,
but not bad enough to warrent a penalty on a chance to do something.

>>Armorer
>Building armor on your own? I would drop this skill in favor of some more
>important skil.

I think I have to agree here.  In a Sci-Fi setting, people are going to be
more likely to purchase armor than build it.  As far as Battle Dress repair,
that could be included as part of the Battle Dress skill, or Mechanic.  Yes
there are some barbaric planets where this skill would be applicable, but
there isn\'t a barbarian career.

>>Craftsman
>What does a craftsman craft? A baker? a bricklayer? A goldsmith? I would
>drop it.

This is a good skill to have as a default skill.  Most people can pick up a
hammer or saw to preform the basic tasks, but most people arnt going to have
a skill level of 1, which would be able to build a house for example.  I can
see this as being a good background skill (limited J-o-T for engineering types).

>>Environment Combat*
>I\'d count special training to the corresponding weapon skill and drop this.

This seems to replace Zero-G Combat, and High-G Combat.  Still needed.

>>Fencing
>A special skill? Why not included in Blade weapon?

Seems redundant with Blade Combat but if you notice, the Blade cascade has
long blade (cutlass, etc) and short blade (knife).  These are skills at
delivering harm to someone.  Fencing is the art of swordsmanship.  Someone
trained in bayonet combat, or with a cutlass, isn\'t necessarily going to
know how to fence.

On the other hand, we are making an assumption here.  This could be a "how
to get rid of that stolen data chip" fencing skill. :-)

>(IMHO) but to be that, you have to be trained in communication, stealth and
>to keep cool.

Forward observer, the occupation has to know communications, stealth, etc.
Howver there is a Forward observer skill as well.  This is the skill of
using laser designators, reading lat/long coordinates, using specialized
equipment
etc.  This the ability to actually determine what to call in for an air-strike.

>>Gunnery
>>Heavy Weapons*
>
>What\'s the difference between these two skills? Isn\'t a cannon a heavy weapon?

Heavy weapons is a ground based weapons skill.  Gunnery is a ships weapons
skill.  There is quite a difference in firing a morter, Rocket Propelled
Grenade, and an artillery piece and firing a turret laser on a ship.  I
would allow someone with certian Heavy Weapons expertiese to have a default
in gunnery.  Things like sand casters, and missle batteries on a ship could
be operated in a pinch by a person with Heavy Weapons, but they are different.

>>Jack of All Trades
>I would drop this skill because experience with old Traveller has show that
>this \'Mac Guyver\'-like skill causes lot\'s of problems because it\'s too
>advantagerous.

J-o-T isn\'t as powerful.  It gives players a chance at having a Level 0
skill in any thing they try.  All it does is remove the penalty, if they
make a J-o-T skill check.  I need to disarm that nuke before it blows.  I
don\'t have electrician, so I use my J-o-t--3 skill.  I roll a 3, and need a
8.  3+3 =6,
sorry, I have to take a penalty on my skill check.  Too bad, you should have
cut the green wire....

>>Melee (Armed)*
>
>That\'s the difference to blade weapon? (What I\'d like to say: think about
>building more general skills where blade weapons are a special case)

I have to agree with this, unless this skill is going to include things that
there arn\'t blade skills for, like hammers, clubs, saps, staffs, chairs,
golf clubs, hockey sticks . . .  Brawling with Weapon as opposed to Brawling
(unarmed). (which was listed BTW)

>>Performance (Art)

>Nice, but very unimportant for roleplaying in the Traveller millieu, IMHO.
Drop.

Needed for the Performer career.  I suspect that this will be more NPC
related, but if you want to play a Music Star, justifying that
Battle-dress-5 skill will be a bit difficult.  There is a need for the
Performer career, and that career needs some skills.  


>>Philosophy*
>
>Again. That\'s roleplaying but no player can stat \'my character has just

>against philosophy. GM, think about something like "I know that I know
>nothing"\'

Ah contrair.  Its easier to role-play a character who is dumber than the
player, but it is hard to role-play a character who is smarter.  You may
have a player who has never had a chemistry class, but his character is
expected to perform some chemistry related skill.  You wouldn\'t expect the
player to know that you add the acid to the water who has never had a
chemistry class.  That is why you have skills.  You are not playing your
self.  "Geez, I need to understand the way they think.  Can I use my
philosphy skill to do that?"  

>>Research*
>
>Can you research something independ from a scientific discipline? As far as
>I know, no German university teach general research but you only learn
>researching together with all other knowledge of the specific discipline.

Since this is marked as a default skill.  I think it is for those who have a
strong Chemistry background to be able to research an astrophysics problem.
Chemistry isn\'t the right skill, but they learned their Research skill from
Chemistry class.

I think this is a good first cut at the skills list.  If I had to cut out
any one skill, it would be to consolidate First Aid and Medic.  We always
played Medic-1 was first aid, Medic-2 was EMT, Medic-3 was Doctor.  Medic-0
may be more appropraite for First Aid though as the default skill (again
most people can fix a cut, or treat a sprained ankle but would not be
considered to have any medical training.)

I would also consider changing Athletics to Performance (Athletics) or
dropping the "Performance" all together, and having the skills: Athletics,
Art, Dance, Drama, Music, Writing.

I always had trouble justifiing the belter.  Seems that the belter could be a subform of Merchant.  A belter is a merchant who is a hot pilot, and enjoys sandblasting rocks a lot.  In the end, he has a bay of goods to sell.

The Hunter could be a Rogue, or Noble, or an Ex. Scout.  Actually, its one of the classes that is missing, that seems to fit the sci-fi game.  However, for a player character, their role is somewhat limited.

I agree. Even in my TNE games, my players still like the BELTER class.
Is the 10 character class limit arbitrary, self-imposed? Or are your
plans for more, detailed, character classes to follow in supplements?

Remember though, not every world  in the Imperium is going to be

Sender: owner-traveller@MPGN.COM

        As a previous survey and an ongoing survey have shown, and the
recent response to your stated intention to go back to CT/HG design rules
for spacecraft, most people (your customers, that is) are opposed to that
idea and prefer something more. The most popular design system by far seems
to be FF&S. 

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Just because the bulk of the players on this list want what you want doesn\'t
mean that that\'s what the general public will buy enough of to support Trav.
In fact, from what happened with TNE, there\'s evidence of the opposite. Trav.
is supposed to an RPG, first & foremost, not a wargame or miniatures or gear-
head exerciser. I believe that TNE was way too complex to bring in the general
public. It\'s the same thing that happened to wargames more than 15 years ago.
There were warnings then, in S&T esp., but the hobby just kept on adding more
complexity until it became a niche. I applaud IG for recognizing this and tak-
ing steps to put Trav. back where it can once again appeal to a wide audience.

Among the missing skills(that I noticed);

Observation
	Everyone has a chance to notice things, some are trained to.  I\'m not 
sure how close this is to Perception, but I would guess that where 
perception is;
"He was lying, his supplier can drop the price another 50 credits"
Observation is;
"He was wearing a brown Armani suit with traces of a white powder on the 
right sleeve"

Persuasion and Act/Bluff (TNE skills?) are missing, equal to Fast Talk I 
guess

Equestrian seems to replace riding.  I liked riding better because it 
implied non-terrestrial animals.

Don\'t see any skills for belters, should be Geology, and/or Mining (just 
Geology is probably enough).  They also would use Survey, Sensors and pilot 
of course, but they are there.

I would like to see a "Scrounging" skill, but I suppose that\'s too much for 
one task role.  ("We need 200 linear meters of ybrenium tubing and 50 rolls 
of duct tape in half an hour." "What color duct tape?")

I used \'Machinist\' as the ability to manufacture parts (with the proper 
equipment).  This has come in handy at times.

>Melee (Armed)*

Is this intended to indicate both armed and unarmed?  If not, unarmed 
combat is a big gap.
oops, just noticed;

>Brawling (Unarmed)*

This is ok, but I\'d prefer \'unarmed combat\' of which level 1 is akin to 
brawling, whilst level 4 is akin to a black belt in Tae Kwon Do (or the art 
of your choice).  "Brawling-5" seems to me to be the ability to break 
someones nose easily, not break someones neck effortlessly.

Having specific effects for the results of different styles of unarmed 
combat is the realm of house rules (or perhaps a supplement).

>Ship

What\'s this?  typo for ship\'s boat?

I always thought that ship\'s boat and pilot were so identical that they 
should be combined.  Now we hav "Grav Craft" as well.  What\'s the 
difference?

>Mechanics

This should be a cascade, or specialized skill.  I have used as a roll to 
fix grav vehicles (along with gravitics only if the grav units themselves 
are damaged/broken), internal combustion engines, damaged turret mechanisms,
 damaged or broken fixed wing aircraft parts, also to conduct maintanence 
on a helo, etc.  Perhaps this should be kept to a house rule, but it seems 
a bit too general of a skill to me.

Perhaps to repair a specific vehicle one would need the skill required to 
operate that vehicle as well as mechanic skill.  This is a bit unrealistic 
(Do aircraft mechanics need to know how to fly the thing? no.), but 
provides a limit on mechanic skill.

Positive comments;
I like First Aid as seperate from medical.
I can see a good basic set of skills for small unit combat/mercenary 
campaigns.
I like having a law skill distinct from Admin.
Vacc Suit is much easier to say than Environment suit (but zero-g-combat is 
easier to say than environment combat).
Athletics and performace skills have interesting role playing 
possibilities.
I like the concept that some skills are present in everyone at 
not-very-useful levels, and some are not.

Additional suggestions;
Skills should be interrelated.  This is akin to the concept of \'enabling 
skills\' from some version of trav.  If a PC has both engineering and 
mechanics, for example, she may be able to apply both skills to a 
particular repair, increasing the chance of success perhaps by half of the 
less applicable skill.

Cascade Skills. A cascade skill allows the character to choose from a list
and receives level 1 in that skill; He also gets level (1/2) in all others
within the cascade.

Aircraft
Blade Weapons
Gun Combat

*Default Skill (A character can always try a task at using one of these
default skills at level 0). This is not an especially lucrative endeavor, 
but
it does have some chance of success.

We must be careful about the definition of Craftsman. IMO the skill
represents specialized knowledge that an artisan would require. It
replaces the Jewelry, Metallurgy, Carpentry etc. from TNE. A default
skill here (and I would require my players to specialize the craftsman
skill anyway) would indicate that a Jewler can lay bricks. Maybe if his
background was right, but, I don\'t think so.

I liked the Liason skill from CT for this skill. However, Liason
suffered from the Ship to Shore limitation. The FO skill is more
general. It includes surface to surface. I would keep it. My players
have attempted to attack surface targets with thier shipborn weapons
and lamented not having the FO skill.

>>>Gunnery
>>>Heavy Weapons*

Another difference is the range of combat. With Gunnery (ship weapons)
and the scale of distances that space weapons operate, the shooter
doesn\'t see the target, judge projectile drop, windage, etc. Heavy
weapons includes indirectly fired artillery, which may include these
things. However, most applications of Heavy Weapons will be by the
player aiming at a target he can see. Subconsciously (or consciously)
accounting for variations and pulling the trigger. In general, the
shooter computes the firing solution. With Gunnery, the shooter has a
target from a sensor, an abstract set of variables that describe its
motion, and a computer to tell him how to aim the weapon. Only at
extremely close range will the computer be the human (or Aslan, or
whatever). The infamous star-wars turret shooting at targets with
speeds in excess of 4000 kph. (That\'s a sore nerve for me, knowing
something about air defense.) Bottom line and no more waste of BW, keep
both.

>>>Melee (Armed)*

How about cascading Brawling (armed and unamred) and keeping blade
combat separate as shown?

Got to keep them. Instrumental in developing an in-depth character. as
an aside, I have a Dark Conspiracy character that is a lawyer turned
mystic turned performer. Performance skills would have allowed me to
specialize in acting. (She has a Cable show about alien/psychic
phenomenon.) Keep the performer skills. Maybe separate, but keep them.

Amen. I frequently ask for rolls versus specific training/education
skills in order to give information to the player and for that matter
how much. I regularly use Philosophy as one of these rolls. Primarily,
it is an *enabling* roll. The best analysts I professionally
encountered were adet at figuring out the philosophy behind some
functionality. A successful Philosophy check would allow an Electronics
check to determine the function of that Thing on the alien globe
generator capacitor linkage. What was the design philosophy for its
existence. Obviously, you can stick to the literal definition of
Philosophy, but I have reasons for extensions.

More generally, from the process of being educated. For instance, I
knew how to use the library before I went to college. (Which made
college easier)  New generations will know how to get information *on
line*. All a part of the education process. You do not need to be a
graduate student to do research. Ask that game store owner how he found
out about the taxes he would need to pay.

I agree with the first cut. As Rob points out, referees will create
skills when there is no other way around it. The *legal* list is for
those who want to publish completely compatible products.

Doesn\'t people from university go for adventure? What\'s about Scientists,
Engineers or Doctors? Or should Scholar be a collective category for them?
But why didn\'t you then also summarize Army, Navy and Marine to (for
example) Soldier?
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

I think the idea here is that military types are more likely to 
adventure, so they can be differentiated more.  Also, in terms of 
designing character generation systems, it\'s easier to group scholarly 
disciplines than military ones (in my experience, which is fairly extensive).


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>Consolidated Skill List (* indicates Default Skills [see below])

To justify my following critics I\'d like to say that if I\'ve made no
comment, I agree with that skill. The game should have about 50-60 skills,
but not more. Perhaps you should drop one or two skills to lower the number.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

To me, the number of skill is unimportant.  There can be hundreds for all 
I care.


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>Archery*

The use of archaic missle or throwing weapons a default skill? I don\'t think
so.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

I agree with this comment.  Someone who\'s never been trained to use a bow 
should definately get the -5 DM for unskilled use when using one (or 
whatever MMT\'s replacement will be for this).  This is also true of 
several other skills listed as "default".  I would suggest looking this 
over again.


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>Armorer

Building armor on your own? I would drop this skill in favor of some more
important skil.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

This is an extremely important skill for primitive types, so I would not 
drop it.  However, I would subsume it into craftsman (see below).


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>Craftsman

What does a craftsman craft? A baker? a bricklayer? A goldsmith? I would
drop it.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

I would not drop it, but make it a cascade skill with specializations 
allowed.  This again is important for primitives (usually NPCs, but they 
gotta have skills too).


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>Environment Combat*

I\'d count special training to the corresponding weapon skill and drop this.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

I think this should be a cascade skill too.  Including such things as ZG 
and Hi-G combat.


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>Equestrian*

Does this skill also include normal riding (for me, it\'s a somewhat unusual
term I had to look up)? Why not call it simple Riding?
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

Because "Riding" is not the correct term.  Anyone can ride on something 
being controlled by another.  Equestrian is the skill of controlling a horse.


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>Fencing

A special skill? Why not included in Blade weapon?
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

I think you may be confused here (or I may be also :-), but I think this 
is referring to the skill of putting stolen goods out on the blackmarket 
(also called fencing).


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>Forward Observer

I never understand what\'s the roleplaying use of that skill. As a general
rule, I would try to distinguish between occupation (or role) skills and
activity skills (more general). To be a forward observer is an occupation
(IMHO) but to be that, you have to be trained in communication, stealth and
to keep cool.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

FO is the skill of calling in artillery fire or orbital artillery fire. 
You seem to think it is the skill of "scouting" or something, which has
been covered in CT/MT as Recon.  If you\'ve ever watched a movie about Viet
Nam, they\'re always calling in strikes from aircraft and artillery.  That
is what FO is for.  I agree with someone else\'s comment that this would be
a TL 5-9 skill, after which it would become rare (though it\'s always nice
to be able to go manual when your fancy electronic FO computer breaks
down). 


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>Gunnery
>Heavy Weapons*
What\'s the difference between these two skills? Isn\'t a cannon a heavy 
weapon?
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

Gunnery is for space combat, and refers to use of turreted lasers and 
plasma weapons.  Heavy Weapons are things like squad support weapons 
(MG\'s, LAW rockets, etc.), and are generally portable or semi-portable.


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>Jack of All Trades

I would drop this skill because experience with old Traveller has show that
this \'Mac Guyver\'-like skill causes lot\'s of problems because it\'s too
advantagerous.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

I love this skill!  Please don\'t drop it, but _do_ clearly delineate how 
it is to be used.  I\'ve always made it that a character with JOT can 
"expand" his skills into related areas.  e.g., you have mechanics-3 and 
jot-1, you can handle electronics-0.  If you have jot-2, I\'ll let you get 
away with engineering-0 and computers-0.  And so on.  In Shadowrun, they 
have a "skill web" and I\'ve always meant to make one for Trav.  It would 
formalize the system I outlined above.


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>Melee (Armed)*

That\'s the difference to blade weapon? (What I\'d like to say: think about
building more general skills where blade weapons are a special case)
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

I agree with this.  Isn\'t this brawling and/or blade?  Perhaps blade 
should be dropped and Melee be the replacement, including clubs and 
hammers and such things which are not "blades".


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>Performance (Art)
>Performance (Dance)
>Performance (Drama)
>Performance (Music)
>Performance (Writing)

Nice, but very unimportant for roleplaying in the Traveller millieu, IMHO.
Drop.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

Sorry, Stefan, but I completely disagree with you here.  They may not 
have been important in your games, but I\'ve had to invent them myself for 
my campaigns.


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>Philosophy*

Again. That\'s roleplaying but no player can stat \'my character has just
created a new meanful philosophic statement because I rolled successfully
against philosophy. GM, think about something like "I know that I know
nothing"\'
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

This is simply meant to imply that the character has knowledge about 
philosophy and can write and comprehend papers on the topic.  Try reading 
a high-level philosophy paper (or even a mid-level one) and tell me then 
that this isn\'t a skill.  You could just as easily say that any academic 
discipline should not be given a skill (e.g. history, political science, 
etc.).  All of these are areas of knowledge, and make useful skills.


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>Psionicology (an academic endeavor)

Oh, that\'s a real improvement. Good.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

Yup, I like this too.


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>Research*

Can you research something independ from a scientific discipline? As far as
I know, no German university teach general research but you only learn
researching together with all other knowledge of the specific discipline.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

You can research something independent of a discipline.  Many Canadian 
univesities have degrees in "Information Sciences" that relate directly 
to this skill.  It is the ability to search and organize information 
meaningfully.


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>Surface Vehicle*

Including boats that swim on the water\'s surface? :-) (What\'s about Ground
vehicle?)
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

This should definately be a cascade skill.


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Btw, will the basic rules book also cover alien races? Does they have
special skills which have to be considered?
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

I don\'t think it should cover alien races.  I would like to see (as much
as possible) the rules be relatively free from the background so that
people can use it for non-Imperium non-Standard sorts of campaigns. 
Alien skills will presumably be covered in Alien Archives.

Bureau of Standards
Imperial Ministry of Trade

As the Imperium expands its territory and brings more and more systems into
the community of worlds, the Imperial Ministry of Trade is charged with the
responsibility of regulating trade and commerce: to promote economic
expansion as well as to reduce or eliminate fraud or deception.
The Bureau of Standards administers a wide variety of standards and
specifications and disseminates this information as an educational effort to
all of the members of the Imperium. Typical standards which are promulgated
include the metric system of measurement, statistical standards used in
quality control, and specifications for packaging, safety, and convenience.
The Office of Calendar Compliance is considered a sinecure: a cushy job
inspecting member world compliance with the standard Imperial calendar.
Working out of a suburban office complex, the OCC sends its inspectors on
annual inspection tours in which they visit the Imperiums worlds, promoting
the convenience and logic of the Imperial Calendar. They hold instructional
seminars, meet with educators and legislators, inspect textbooks and computer
systems, and generally gauge compliance with the Imperial standard. The
office also publishes an interesting pamphlet about the Imperial Calendar and
an annual report to the Moot documenting the state of Calendar compliance
within the Imperium.
The employees of the OCC must have a variety of talents: they are called upon
to speak in public, negotiate compliance agreements, and generally get along
with people.

Agents of the OCC travel on ITRs (Imperial Travel Requisitions; they can
travel on scheduled liners or charter ships as necessary) in order to reached
their scheduled destinations. They can call on any local or Imperial forces
for assistance in order to inspect existing records or documents. Their
authority to inspect is guaranteed by the documents which establish
individual world membership in the Imperium. Since the authority of the
Imperium itself generally ends at the edge of space, OCC agents are virtually
the only agents with authority in peace-time to visit, inspect, and enforce
on world surfaces.
Are they ever co-opted by the Minister of Trade to achieve clandestine
missions?
Are they trained? In what? Are people temporarily assigned to OCC?

    'body' => 'Guns in Traveller need to reflect a science-fiction feel as opposed to a
concentration on weapons you can buy at the store today. 
Ammunition. I fully agree with Greg Porters proposal that the source of
damage be ammunition rather than the gun. Ammunition should be classified in
round millimeter calibers (i.e. 5mm, 9mm, 18mm). In addition, adjectives can
tell us it is trank, explosive, etc.
Weapon Nomenclature. There is a standard weapon model designation system used
by the Imperium and based on the Imperial calendar. For example, P indicates
Pistol: P017 is the Imperial Pistol model adopted in the year 17. People
probably call this pistol a P17 (they may also call it by a nickname like
Esseye).
We also want to have names for guns that are not the standard words we
typically hear. Instead I want to see names that reflect the future and a
different culture.
On the other hand, we will see illustrations and representations of typical
or conventional guns, and there has to be an explanation for them. That
explanation is that there are many alternate cultures around the Imperium,
and they are also the source of weapons.
Older Weapons. Typically, earlier technology weapons have been traced images
of real guns (like a Springfield Musket, or an aquebus). Instead, we specify
some characteristics and then define the gun without reference to a
historical photo or drawing and get it drawn.
Accessories: Laser spots. Optical sights (unit and telescopic). Stabilized
stock. Silencer.
Id like to see the following basic personal guns (and an increased emphasis
on non-lethals for a larger proportion of conflict resolution) in the basic
edition (were not talking about military crew-served or explosive-type
weapons).
 
Civilian Weapons
Body Pistol. Flat plastic pistol. Passes through metal detectors. Fume proof
to avoid sniffers. Flat self contained chamber bar ratchets up (used portions
can be broken off after a battle). 6 rounds. Ceramic bullets. Entirely hand
operated (not semi-auto).
Snub. Fires a 4 or 5 mm cartridge; odd number of rounds (like 11 or 13),
rotation of the cylinder skips a cylinder (mechanical reasons). Hi velocity
rounds.
Magnum Revolver. Larger caliber round: 9mm 10mm, 11mm. Can be downloaded for
on ship use. Various cartridges: shot. Trank. Explosive.
Self Defender. Commercial mass market. 20-round 4mm. Rounds constructed to
shatter rather than penetrate walls/ partitions. Issues cloud of invisible
dye to mark all participants for later police reports. Radio frequency
screamer comes on when fired (credit: John Barnes)
Staplegun. A basic user-friendly pistol.
BullPup. Plastic stocked 5mm rifle. Semi-auto with burst mode. Pump forend to
operate the action. Magazine inserts in buttstock; 50 rounds. This is
essentially the non-military standard issue rifle. You find it in the mechant
and scout ships lockers.
BullPup Shotgun. Shotgun version of Bullpup. Same weapon, but fires
shotshells (maybe 18mm bore) or flechettes.
Hunting Rifle. For big-game hunting. Twin superposed barrels upper is
spotting rifle small bore (4-5 mm) with semi-auto feed; lower is 18mm
explosive rocket with radio frequency seeker head for big game.

Alternative Weapons (Statistically Non Lethal)
Many of these work best in close quarters (on starships or in buildings).
Zapper. Handset with 10-self contained cartridges each with a pronged barb
set, cable, and thermal battery. Trigger controls firing and turns the
electric on and off.
Fogger. Releases a cloud of opaque gas (perhaps room sized cloud). Options:
anesthetic, flame damp, pepper gas, poison gas.
Slapper. Fires high density plastic bullet (10mm) which expands 10x to "slap"
the target.
Flasher. Add on to most shoulder weapons. Flashes high-intensity white
(colored) light to distract / disorient the target.
Screamer. Puts out a disorienting loud scream (several options available).
Hand-held device (looks like a phaser). 
 
Military Weapons
Esseye. Standard Issue Semi-Automatic Pistol. The basic pistol people in the
military carry (like the 45 Auto of several years ago). There will be basic
differences between models issued to the scouts, navy, army, marines, etc.
Fusil. A standard military rifle carried by infantry troops. Of conventional
design, it is the equivalent of the M16 or the AK-47 (at the appropriate
technology level).
Carbine. A short version of the Fusil (and based on that pattern). For
officers and rear-echelon troops.
Sniper. A super accurate version of the Fusil (and also based on that
pattern).

...Dave said. I had absolutely no intention to tell other people how to
game. Without a good fight, roleplaying becomes boring, IMHO. But sometimes,
it also can be more challenging to solve a problem without combat. My
overall oppinion is only, that a gaming system should be open for any
direction and not overemphasis military (or non-military) actions. In my
mail, I questioned whether the skill "forward observer" is a very useful one
or if it should be dropped in favor for other skills.

I\'m a military layman with only some very theoretically knowledge from books
and movies. You showed that the job of a forward observer isn\'t a trivial
one. But to justify a skill, there should be more.

I imagine a f.o. as follows: Private Dan (the f.o.) is watching the
advancing enemy with his infrared binoculars. "Donald to Mother Duck" (they
always use this kind of silly abbreviations :-) he whispers in his com
radio. Defense fire welcomes the enemy. The other soldiers drop into the
dirt and answer the fire. "We need some help here, Zetas at region
delta-three." "Here\'s Mother Duck. Hold on for fifty seconds. We\'re going to
order some HELL fire." "Understud." Somewhere at the orbital command center,
somebody presses some buttons, some computers go working and attack
sattellite TH-93 send its deadly HELL-missiles to the ground, varporising
everything of sector D3.

No need for a skill roll, that least at my abstraction level of play.

Perhaps one should try to come up with three common situation (scenarios)
for every skill that should be included into the rules to proof its
usefulness. The scenarios should cover a wider range of situations.

For example: Astrogration:

1. Calculate jump destination (routine, if computer works, otherwise impossible)
   for own ship or of escaping ship based on current sensor (another skill)
data 
   to plot a similar course to follow it (at least difficult).
2. Determine current position to proof correct jump (routine) or after misjump
   (difficult because of sensors still suffer from jump-field anomalies).
3. Plan a rendevouz between two ships (normal)

I hope you know what I mean.

>        Keeping cool applies to just about everything.

No doubt about this :-)

like the character types supported, though it would be nice to have some

fill that role?

NEW Consolidated Skill List

D indicates default skill, all characters have this at level-0 at the 
GM\'s option ("primitive" characters will not have some of these, but will 
have others that moderns won\'t have).

G indicates grouped skill, from which one "specialty" must be chosen, 
with all other members of the skill group being level-nil (level-0 at 
GM\'s option).

C indicates cascade skill, from which one "specialty" must be chosen, with 
all other members of skill group being at 1/2 level (level-0 if specialty 
is at level-1).

It is the FO\'s responsibility to keep the HELL fire in sector three. If
the FO can see the enemy with binoculars, he may be subject to the fire
he is calling in. Ever see Hamburger Hill? where an inexperienced
officer called an artillery strike onto his own position by mistake? He
missed his skill roll. This mistake is more common than admitted in
combats.

People look like ants on the ground. Which ones are ours and which are
theirs. FO: "I\'ll make it easy for you. The ones reflecting laser
designators are the bad guys. And forget the ones over in sector three,
they are decoys."

No, I think that the FO skill is still important to the game. I don\'t
run many military scenarios, but making a skill check for the FO skill
lends some excitement to the game. Fail it and you kill youself or they
do.

With gravitics, there is less distintion in military roles.  A Grav Tank
could turn out to replace a Helicopter Gunship.  Combat kinda takes a bit of a different shape, when you are no longer constricted to the ground.

The roles of the vehicles will not change drastically in post-modern warfare.  You will still need ground support (a grav based replacement for Apache and Harrier), close air support, air superiority, tactical and strategic bombing.
You will need troop carriers (mass, airborne, insertion (blackhawk)).  You will need to move cargo.  Tankers wont be necessary once fusion plants start powering everything.

        We\'re not saying keep it complex to keep people out. We\'re saying
keep the complex option in for those who want it, and provide a simple
option for those who don\'t. ***THAT\'S how you appeal to a wider audience.***
After all, the complex people plus the simple people is a wider audience
than the simple people.

        The other half of the argument was that the simple option and the
complex option have to be compatible with one another, so you can move back
and forth between them as you want, to whatever level of complexity suits
you. That\'s the idea behind FF&S Light.

        There\'s a _lot_ more to it than that, regardless of TL. You\'ve got
to tell the firing unit where to hit, what to use, what *not* to hit (like
the innocent civilians next door, or the friendlies being attacked). Then
the firing unit fires. Until higher TLs, chances are they may not hit the
target. So you have to know enough about the weapon\'s performance that you
can figure out how the firing unit, x kilometers way, has to adjust its aim
point. Then they fire again, you correct again. Meanwhile, you may have a
moving target, friendlies are moving too ... it\'s not something any joe can
just walk up and do.

        Not that I\'m saying you need to role-play the entire interaction ...
then *you* would need the specialized knowledge. That\'s the purpose of
skills -- they show what specialized knowledge the *character* has, that you
can then simulate ("Ok, the Kinunir fires her weapons. The roll is a 6,
modified by your skill ... they hit about 10m northwest of the aimpoint.")

	I would like to second (third?) the vote for a Belter class.  It
can be part of merchant or something, but I would definately like to see
it included.  This would require some sort of prospecting skill (though I
guess this is just a combo of geology and sensor skills).  I was never so 
hot on the Hunter class.  
	I was also thinking that "Agent" might be expanded into something 
broader like "Security Forces", and include police, spies, private eyes, 
etc.  

Survey skill:  what is this skill for?  I\'m not saying it should be 
dumped, I just want a description of what it\'s good for.

Recon:  same as above.

Liaison skill:  someone said this had something to do with orbital 
artillery.  I\'m pretty certain this was an error. It\'s more of a 
"Diplomacy" skill.

Equestrian:  In retrospect, I think this should be renamed.  It does 
imply horses only (what about Ton-Tons and Tarsus Nobbles?).  Riding is 
not a great substitute, but it would do.  I was thinking that maybe 
"Ground Vehicle" or "Surface Vehicle" could include "riding animal" as an 
option.

	As a more general comment, I like the way MT handled skills.  I 
like the idea of groups of skills, and categories like "Inate" which 
contained streetwise, leader, etc. that you could choose from.  This 
helped in directing character generation.

Comments? Criticism? Flames? (<--in order of preference :-)

Did I miss Hovercraft, light, medium, and heavy; and Tilt Rotor medium
and heavy (no light). Would you consider these grouped with other
types?

This assumes technology development in line with out rather dense
atmosphere. What about rocket propulsion for aircraft. German\'s did in
WWII. We (humans) have better ways because our atmosphere burns.

Wait a minute, I\'m stumbling into FF&S territory here. Changing lists.

    'body' => '        If you\'d like something to do, and you enjoy using FF&S, here\'s how
you can help. I need some things designed for FF&S Light, and I\'m running
out of time (deadline to Imperium Games was Friday, midnight).
        All designs should be straight stock FF&S except as noted.

        1) I need weapons designs -- TL8-15 concentrating on TL8-11,
standard turrets, bays or spinals with a short range of 5. Lasers should
observe TL*50 limit on DE. Missile launchers should be for the standard
7m^3-sized missiles, and BAYS should contain an integral MFD capable of
controlling the missiles, with a short range of 5. Please submit the design
worksheet with the weapon. List standard FF&S crews. I\'ll worry about
refiguring out crews if we go with Derek\'s proposal.

        2) Defense designs -- TL8-15 concentrating on TL8-11, short range 5.
Again, please submit the design worksheet. List standard FF&S crews.

        4) Small craft facilities -- Internal hangers, launch tubes and
grapples. Small craft sizes 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90. Ditto
the worksheet.

        5) Fuel purification plant designs -- TL8-15 concentrating on
TL8-11, designed to handle 700, 1400 and 2800 m^3 of fuel per 6 hours. Ditto
crews and worksheets.

        6) Power plant designs -- TL8-15 concentrating on TL8-11, nuclear
power and fuel cells. For fusion plants below TL12, the minimum size is 10
times the listed FF&S value. Ditto crews. 

        After looking at the 3,000Td Midu Agashaam, which requires about
10,000MW, and the 10Td launch, which requires 14MW, I think good values to
on which concentrate would be        5, 25, 50, 75, 100, 250, 500, 750,
1000, 2500, and 5000MW

        For the working draft, I\'ll generate the table for TL12 Fusion.

Wherever it\'s appropriate I\'d like the original worksheets as well. By
appropriate, I mean the design was more complicated than "1000MW pp, at
2MW/m^3 that\'s 500m^3" -- weapons and the like.

        Please either post them to the GDW Beta List (gdw-beta@qrc.com), or
email them directly to myself _and_ Wildstar@qrc.com for his QSDS.

IF AT ALL POSSIBLE:
        I would humbly ask that you put your donation in the form of an HTML
table; not only am I using the Web to draft this, I\'ll import the HTML files
straight into Word to send to IG. I\'m really running behind here, so the
less time I spend on formatting the better. But if that\'s not possible,
still send something in!

        Making a table is really easy. Here\'s how:
        1) Start the table with "<table border=1>"
        2) Start each row with "<tr valign=bottom align=right>" -- that
aligns the bottom of the text in multiline boxes with the bottom of the box,
and puts everything flush right. I can fix those few that don\'t need to be
flush right later.
        3) Start each data item in the row with "<td>" and end them with "</td>"
        4) End each row with "</tr>"
        5) End the table with "</table>"

Here\'s an example:

   <table border=1>

   <tr>
      <td>TL</td>
      <td>Power</td>
      <td>Volume</td>
   </tr>

   <tr>
      <td>12</td>
      <td>1,500</td>
      <td>750</td>
   </tr>

   </table>

This would look like this:

  +----+----+----+
  | TL | Power  | Volume |
  +----+----+----+
  | 12 | 1,500  |    750 |
  +----+----+----+

Um, no.  I guess I thought that you were.  I took your comments to mean 
that what little there actually is in \'empty\' space constituted a medium 
of sufficient density to push against for propulsion.  Oh, well...  Were 
you actually talking about using a repulsor to clear a path in front of a 
ship to avoid damage from micrometeorites and other such debris?  I know 
that several versions of the design rules (from HG or MT, onward) 
incorporated minimum hull thicknesses necessary to avoid damage from 
space debris, but this seems somewhat shortsighted given that even a 1G 
craft can achieve astounding velocities if given a long enough 
acceleration burn.  Since none of the extant ship design rules have 
ever incorporated \'navigational\' repulsors (which currently don\'t appear 
until TL-16), and any space debris events are almost exclusively referee 
imposed (unless someone bricks their piloting roll during atmospheric 
entry or gas giant refuelling), I suppose that such events can remain in 
the realm of the many other hazards of interplanetary travel conveniently 
unemphasized.  I\'d much rather continue to ignore space sandblasting on a 
routine basis than re-hack the repulsor design tables in order to further 
complicate the spacecraft operation and combat rules.

I prefer to use the explanations that have been used since High Guard all 
the way up to FF&S:

Plasma/Fusion Gun:  A device that injects matter into a containment field 
(magnetic or gravitic) or chamber, ignites it to a plasma state, lets it 
cook for a few microseconds (proceeding to actual fusion in a fusion gun) 
and then vents it towards the enemy (at about ten thousand meters/sec).

Particle Accelerator:  Accelerates particles (typically hydrogen nuclei) 
to relativistic speeds and fires them at the target, imparting thermal 
energy and not a little bit of radiation.

I should have mentioned that.  Somebody else did, but since I couldn\'t 
figure out who or when, I addressed it while replying to you.  Sorry for 
the confusion.

I didn\'t mean to accuse you of doing so.  I was addressing the 
misconception in a general manner, without attributing it to anybody or, 
at least, that was my intent.

Ahem.  I do believe that there is a bit in their about limiting maximum 
power output per laser, and this was done to prevent the scenario you 
describe (near as I can tell).  I actually had to get off of my lazy butt 
and get my references, darn you!

To make my case slightly easier, and not knowing off the top of my head 
what the proper tonnage for your average battleship is, I\'m going to put 
it in the Very Large size category, which is 100,000 to 999,999 
displacement tons.

First of all, Brilliant Lances does not allow any combat between ships 
beyond 44 hexes, assuming the target is no bigger than Gigantic (the 
largest size category) at TL-15.  Now, the difficulty modifiers:  +14 for 
absulute range (assuming you engage at exactly 44 hexes), -4 for target 
size (VL), for a base total of +10 (I\'m not bothering with EMM, evasion, 
or other factors).  Presume a TL-15 MFD, so we can disregard six of 
those, and we\'re down to +4.  With a ROF of 800, we can disregard up to 
five more Diff Mods, so that puts us down to 0, with one to spare (in 
case the target is evading or has EMM, or some other such thing).  Keep 
in mind that higher ROF\'s can\'t actually make the firing task simpler 
than its base level which, given beam pointer technology, indicates that 
any to-hit beyond 40 hexes is an Impossible task (relevant asset/4).  
With a line crew, that means they can hit 3 times out of 20, or 15% of 
the time.  That\'s not great, but not bad, considering that we\'re talking 
about a distance over one and a quarter million kilometers.

Laser power output is limited to 50Mj per TL (no, I CAN\'T cite the 
source!  I *know* I\'ve seen it, though!  Can anyone who remembers where 
it is help me out?  I\'m not making this up!).  At TL-15, this means we 
can\'t make lasers that push out more than 750 Mj, so lasers don\'t 
actually come much bigger than the barbettes on the Kinunir Colonial 
Cruiser.  At 750 Mj, maximum damage value is 69, and the penetration 
rating is 1/22 (rounding to nearest whole number, and taking reciprocal), 
which allows us to penetrate 1517 armor factors and inflict one point of 
damage.  Keep in mind, though, that the laser can do no higher than 69 
damage points (if someone were dim enough to build their battleship 
without a hull), which is good enough to do three minor damage, but won\'t 
even hurt a system rated in major damage boxes.  In fact, only ships less 
than 1000 tons will suffer an automatic critical hit each time they\'re 
hit by such a laser.  So, even if my batteship closes in order to use 
that meson gun, I\'m not going to get my skin totally scorched off by 
those laser bays before I give you a traditional inside-out cooking with 
my meson gun.  Of course, I could exacerbate things by using 
sandcasters... (A TL-15 sandcaster blocks 2d10x50 damage points, making 
it possible to block one entire hit from the 750Mj laser with one canister)

Well, if I hallucinated that whole bit about the discharge energy limit, 
then your argument holds true, otherwise, historical canon is maintained.

Something to keep in mind about the survey.  With only 62 people responding
it\'s not a very representitive sampling of those who might buy the system.
Also, most of the people on this list (who would respond) are more likely to
be engineering types who like detailed complexity.  If you wish to add my

Maybe rules for the creation of \'generic\' aliens would be a good idea.  But
I would ask IG not to include named aliens in the basic rules.  Keep the
rules pure of background because not everyone is interested in \'official\'
background.

Hundreds!  Then the game becames a record keeping nightmare.  Also the more
skills in the game the less important are the players basic stats.  Rather
than have a philosophy skill, use the players Education to determain if they
know something of the current planets philosophical beliefs.  Another comman
example, rather that use a swimming skill, just use the players strength
when the player is in the water.

Also, in games with hundreds of skills the players tend to spend most of
their time trying to learn every single skill.  One of the best rules of GT
was the Int + Educ limit to the number of skills a player could know.

A small number of skills makes each skill that much more important to the
players.

easily be placed in the bullet.  You would have a heck of a lot better

2) Sonic Stunners.  There is evidence that they would work and they

If Traveller is to avoid becoming a primarily military game Traveller
needs good non-lethal weapons.

First off, I\'m sorry if that was too flaming a response.  With you
Subject line, yours seemed it to me at the time.  If your was a flame,
take mine that way, if it wasn\'t, sorry (and don\'t take mine that
way)----fair? :)

I added the idea to try to justify why CT/MT ships could ever go so
bloody fast.  BTW, the density of dust is on the order of fractions of a
particle per cubic km.  Typical scale sizes are on the order of microns.
Enough that a 10,000km/s ship will hit hundreds at least per second.

Well...  sort of.  I used to be a FO, and it goes like this:  PFC Dan,
attached to the HQ of a lift-infantry battalion, is alerted by the 2nd
platoon that they\'ve spotted something.  Getting a visual confirmation of
their exact location, he contacts the Fire Officer of the battery in support.

"Romeo-64, this is Bravo-2-6-Sierra"  (note: the silly niknames are never
used.. try to figure out if Donald just ordered Huey, Duey or Louie to
attack over a PRC-77 radio)

"B-26S, go"

"Fire Mission.  I have five-zero infantry, with three wheeled APC moving
south along road 19.  Grid reference TW25498792.  Mix HE-Airburst and
FASCAM.  5 rounds."  (that\'s 5 rounds from each gun in the battery.. US
Army, about 40 rounds.. half of which will carry mines)

At the battery, gun crews enter the information into the ballistic
computers, as others start packing.  If this is ground based, shoot and
scoot is the only way of life.

Depending on the weapon/ammo, Bravo could call for more fire, adjust the
impact of the rounds, or designate targets for CLGP.

As for the deadly HELL missles..  I am *not* going to wait 10 minutes for my
fire support.  Artillery is like CPR: if it doesn\'t happen quickly, it ain\'t
going to help.

Good, back to the classics..  but may I make a suggestion?  Get rid of the
term "Marine".  I use Naval Infantry myself, and the "Imperial Marine" line
is a nickname.

Since it has come up, there is a wide gulf between weapons training and
combat training.  The US Army trains heavily at night, which makes us
skilled at operating in the dark, using nightvision devices, and
instinctivly protecting our eyes from flares and the like.  This has nothing
to do with how well I shoot.  I see this as an open-ended cascade skill..  A

Cool!

As for missing skills:

Geology, Prospecting.

As for the "Better when roleplayed" argument: I\'d rather have them in the
rules. It doesn\'t prevent good roleplaying, but it does back up the poorer
roleplayers, and allows them to do it.

I\'d also like to see Genetics.

Medic/First Aid: Keep them separate, and add surgeon

Armorer: I figure this is more repair than building, and like the idea.

Make Computer a Cascade: (Operation, Repair, Design)

I like these!  Performers sound like much fun.  I do think 
Journalist, Diplomat, and  Doctor would make useful additions to this list

As for the skills:

>Brawling (Unarmed)*
Will there also be Martial Arts?

This seems like it should come under Recon or Stealth

>Equestrian*

What about animal handling, Guard beast is a great skill,
especially when using geneered animals

Why  is this separate from Melee (armed)?

Please cut this, the game has enough skills already.

Medic 1-2 does this perfectly well.

>Forensics

>Investigation*

How are these two skills different?

>Language (Specific)

I much prefer the MT Linguistics skill.  There are a whole bunch of languages
in the Imperium.  making everyone buy specific skill levels in a 
language either means no one will know more than at most two languages, 
or anyone who learns more will have few other skills left to play with.

>Navigation*

How is this different from Astrogation?  If it is for watercraft I 
believe the two skills should be combined for simplicities sake.

>Performance (Art)

I like these, but I\'m not sure writing is a performance skill (except

>Psychology*

Will this be treating and understanding the mentally ill, or simply and 
understanding of human (and alien) behavior?  I recommend the 2nd, 
Traveller has always suffered from a lack of social/interactive skills


Overall, I like the list, but do think the skill list should be reduced 
somewhat.  Too many skills depowers the characters and slows down the game.
Fewer more general skills increased PC versatility and makes the game 
easier to run.

    'body' => 'Greg Porter dropped a bomb into the new starship design discussion by pointing
out that the proposed new "Fusion Plus" power plants in T4 have a baseline
of 1 megawatt in a *10kg* package.

I would like to  suggest that this be reconsidered - it\'s 
an enormously higher power-to-mass ratio than any previous iteration; even
Classic Trav/High Guard power plants were only 10 MW/tonne or so at TL-15,
not 100 MW/tonne. It\'s an *enormous* change - unless we redesign all the
starship systems to suck more power, power plants become a negligible part
of TL-12 starships. Personal weapons will probably be dominated by lasers - a
1 MW continous beam laser is a fairly scary thing. 11 kg thruster-plate missiles
can accelerate at 40G\'s forever. I\'m sure clever minds can come up with ways
to turn a Mr. Fusion into a bomb (build a machine that you drop in a sewer
that makes hydrogen using allt he power, for example - the sewers fill up with
hydrogen gas until something sets them off - boom.)

Even more important than the changes to all the rest of the technology,
the social changes are almost completely unpredictable; it\'s very hard to 
imagine that a society with this much power available looking as much like
our society as the Imperium of 1107 did.

My advice would be to keep the Mr. Fusion concept, but decrease the power 
density; 10 kW for a 10kg fusion generator would be reasonable, still allow
all sorts of cool technological toys but not completely change the shape of
Traveller technology and society. even 100 kW per 10kg would be better...

price of the ship is directly relatable to the Thrust value, and even
1G ships cannot take on enough cargo (let alone Freight) to pay the

 This is the primary reason I assumed duel technologies in my 1120s
Spinward Marches game (er, make that DUAL technologies).  Most people
use HEPlaR because it\'s really cheap to build and use.  Those for whom
money means nothing (Pirates, the Government...) use Thrusters because
of the tactical advantage of no fuel tank limits and because they don\'t
have to deal with the bank for one reason or another...

        How about the following:

Goopguns (aka Personnel-Immobilization Gel [PIG] Dispensers):  Short-range
(maybe a max range of 3-4 meters) weapons that spray adhesive that when
released immediately expands into a foam and sets very quickly and very
hard.  Some variants, to add insult to immobilization, could dye the target
as well, to further impede escape (imagine trying to fight or flee with a
cubic meter of bright pink foam that\'s spread liberally about your person,
cemented itself to your body and clothing, and set rock hard, turning
everything that it\'s touched bright pink in the process).  I imagine that
due to volume requirements, handheld versions would only have a limited
magazine capacity.

        Another variant could be goop canisters fired out of shotguns, riot
weapons, and grenade launchers.  The grenade launcher/riot weapon variants
could have an area effect, the shotgun versions proximity fuzes that would
release the goop 1 to two meters from target to achieve maximum dispersion.

        I would see goop weapons as being primarily used by law enforcement
personnel, in situations where the live capture of the target would be
desirable (however, PIG deployment could prove fatal in the event that it
set over the target\'s breathing orifices, inducing axphyxiation).  Degooping
the target could be achieved by application of solvents, belt sanders (or
the TLxx equivalent), or carefully chipping it off with hammer and chisel.

Definitely.  I would expect them to have to write \'context reports\' about 
the
worlds which they visit.  These would ostensibly be to provide contextual
information for the MoT, but in reality would be distributed to several
government agencies.

>Are they trained? In what? Are people temporarily assigned to OCC?

I would imagine that for any serious clandestine work it would be more
efficient to use an intelligence agent posing as an OCC operative than
an OCC operative attempting to act as an intelligence professional.
Having said that, most OCC operatives would have training in skills
which would allow them to function in low level intelligence roles -
research skills, liaison skills, computer skills - but I wouldn\'t expect
them to have Interrogation-4 Resisting Torture-6 etc.

OCC would have a number of \'seconded officers\' seconded from
other eveyday branches of the Imperial governmental apparatus,
such as the Imperial Records Office, Bureau of Social Trends,
Office for the Promotion of Travel and Tourism etc. Strangely enough,
to anyone digging around, computer personnel records for these
agencies might show that these people appear not to exist...

Some of my comments where thoughtless, some showed me that my English isn\'t
that good. A few replies:

I\'m still in favor for a set of 50-60 skills because the more skills you
have, the longer the character creation process could (please note, I didn\'t
say "will") last. It will (at least for me) be more complicate to memorize
the skills and, probably most important, with more and more skills, the
single character has lesser abilities.

Some skills are TL-depend. Some (like Archery) make most sense for low tech
characters, others (like Computer) only for high tech operations. It\'s
difficult to decide which to include but I think, when in doubt, include the
high tech ones because that\'s probably the TL where (most of) the characters
come from.

To fix a battledress, I would suggest to use the Battle Dress skill (same
counts for weapons, IMHO). To handle this and all other kinds of occupation
skills, I would suggest to introduce exactly this skill, Occupation (which
one). Now you could have all your bakers, armorers or architects with a
professional rating.

The performance subskills have of course to be included. My fault. But
perhaps I would perfer the single skills Art, Dance, Drama, ... (not sure yet)

Philosophy, for me it was the abstract or even spiritual way of viewing the
world. Form your postings I got the impression that you understand this in a
wider, more practical way, as a general idea of how things work. Especially
to figure out, how alien artefacts or alien societies work. That\'s a useful
skill, however, I would prefer a different skill name then.

Same on research. You seem to understand this not only in an accademic way
but as something, the Call of Cthulhu rules know as Library Use. (As a
sidenode "Information Sciences" is unknown in Germany (AFAIK). You\'ll study
for a master in history to work at archives, for example)

On character classes: IMHO, we should not consider character types who might
go for adventure but people who go for travel. This also goes conform with
the game\'s name :-) While traveling, they might truggle into adventures.
Will only army or navy people travel? I don\'t think so. 

There are at first astronauts (a collective name for all people who fly
starships), space marines (the armed security forces aboard), traders
(people who go and buy or sell good on other planets), explorer (who explore
and survey foreign worlds), hunters, prospectors, and all other kinds of
soldiers-of-fortune (who want to become rich (of money or something else)),
diplomats, soldiers and mercs, wealthy travellers (who want to have a good
day or exciting holydays), scientists (who hunt for fame and scientific
discoveries), criminals (who run away from law), police (who follows them),
entertainers (big stars who travel around and perform life-shows), preachers
(who want to save people\'s soul and/or make a lot of money) or dozens of
other adventurers.

A few, perhaps most of them, have also a military training, are perhaps
retired marines but only few of them are in active duty. These should be the
character types one can play (named after the current occupation or
activity, not after the job they have done in past). The provided character
types should be a fast and easy way to build a character to play, not a
restricted group of persons who may go for adventure (I didn\'t think anybody
has meant this but just to make sure :)

A navy doctor, for example should have 1 term Navy (basic training) and 3-4
terms of Scholar (Medicine), to use the current characters types. I would
call this a Doctor, who works for the Navy and not the other way round.

A member of the ISS could first be a criminal, then a prospector, then doing
three terms of scout. It\'s now a scout but he was more in his past (and he
was never a soldier ;-)

Noble as a character class is also a little bit difficult. To be a noble is
not an occupation but a luck-of-birth. To be a wealthy traveler, or a
diplomant, that\'s an occupation and a good character type (IMHO). Being a
Noble is too generic.

Btw., the role of a hunter, who wants to collect trophies from a dozen
worlds for a wealthy aristocrat, ignoring the fact whether this might be
legal or not, could be a good player character. He could be a former army
men, perhaps a sniper. She could also have served one or two terms in the
ISS, to learn somthing about piloting a star ship and surviving.

Also the belter (or better general prospector, I wouldn\'t restrict this to
asteroids mining) is a very good character. He\'ll browse all kind of unusual
or lonely places to find the valueable claim. 

Back to skills. In the meantime, I\'ve compared the posted list with TNE and
would agree that Geology (for the prospector) and Observation (as general
skill, if you will not replace this will simple INT-rolls) are missing. 

What\'s about Climbing or Mountaineering? 
To support roleplay, I would like to see something like Seduction.
Two Occupation subskills might be Farming and Animal Handling. 
Construction could be also useful, the last three especially for colony
foundation adventures.
I also would try to compact as much as possible combat skils to subskills to
help military (or other combat oriented characters) to know a wider range of
weapons. 
And I would perfer Unarmed Combat instead of Brawling, I think, which should
also include martial arms at higher levels even if experts might cry about this.

Or what\'s about

        Melee (Unarmed)
        Melee (Blade weapons)
        Melee (Clubs)
        Melee (Polearms)
        Missile combat (Throwing weapons)
        Missile combat (Bow)
        Missile combat (Crossbow)
        Gun combat (Early firearms)
        Gun combat (Modern firearms)
        Gun combat (Energy weapons)
        Gun combat (Heavy weapons)

Please don\'t nail me down on exact naming, but I like this uniform
structure. Perhaps one should also distinguish between pistols, guns and
shotguns but I would in the first trial for the snake of simplicity. My only
own experience is Bow, which I tried some time ago. It\'s quite difficult to
use compared to crossbow (which is easy) or other thowing weapons which also
need strength as a bow but an other kind of targetting.

On Gunnery. Somebody said, it\'s for space combat. My German edition has the
skill "Bordschuetze" (combat pilot), perhaps that\'s the same?

What\'s the skill to shoot with an shoulder rocket thrower? Hvy Weapons?
What\'s the skill to use a small MG (20mm) aboard a grav tank? Hvy Weapons?
What\'s the skill to use its main fusion gun? Gunnery?
What\'s the skill to use the small ground-to-air defense missile? Gunnery?

If these are the correct answers, I\'ve understood the skills :-)

On to Charles skill list. I like most of his suggestion. However, 

I would like to suggest my above combat-skill hierachy,
replace Craftsman with more general Occupation skill, 
replacing Commo and Recon with their long terms, 
set computer only for hitech characters as default,

On F.O.: okay, you all have convinced me. I give up. At higher TL, probably
the computer systems used have the needed skill which gives a bonus to the
character rolling for his F.O. skill.

Andrew Boulton also suggested the skill Xenobilogy which could be a very
important (and very general) skill used for many adventures. We should
include it.

Just one last thought to use occupation skill rating for calculating income:
I think, this works for crafts but not so good for arts. A rockstar, for
example isn\'t wealthy because he\'s a good singer, player or even performer
(even today, there\'re good one and lousy one) but perhaps because he or she
has a good PR manager. So one should determine the income either be chance
or use the manager\'s skill instead.

I\'ll stop,

        Here\'s another one: Tangler guns.  Projectile weapons that launch
projectiles with a high rate of spin.  Once out of the weapon\'s barrel, the
hollow projectile casing splits into 6 segments, linked at the centre by
meterlong strands of hi-tensile fibers coated with, you guessed it, a
powerful adhesive.  Centrifugal force on the casing segments tensions the
web, and their momentum and spin cause the web to wrap around the target,
seriously impeding its mobility.

        Again, this is the sort of thing that would be used by riot police
who wanted to apprehend suspects alive.  Tangler rounds could be fired by
riot weapons, grenade launchers, and the like.

        A really nasty (highly lethal) variant would use monomolecular
monofilament instead of sticky string.  Ouch.

STAR[SPACE]SHIP TECHNOLOGY
=============== ==========

It would occur to me that the potential for many types of propulsion
technology to be developed would exist in the universe.  In fact, "older
types" of propulsion might well be developed only to be outmoded by "newer"
types of propulsion.  

A limited example of this here on Sol/Terra would be the development of the
railroads. First propulsion technology used there, and used for a long time
was steam which was eventually displaced by diesel technology.  For a while
there diesels and steam locomotives ran on the same track concurrently.  In
fact, worldwide there are still steam engines in every day use in some
underdeveloped countries.

Taking this tack a little further automobile and truck technology uses
several technologies concurrently with no sign of any technology getting
totally squeezed out.  These include gasoline internal combustion, diesel,
electric, propane, and LNG. Yes, it could be argued that really there are
only two general types of propulsion technology represented, that being
internal combustion and electric.  I see them as separate developments as
they each have their own peculiar challanges.

In aircraft development jets and props, fixed wing and rotary wing, are the
technologies that are predominant.  But, guess what,  lighter than air
technology is coming back for limited roles.  Another wrinkle to consider in
a gaming system is the idea that an older technology gets dusted off and
through the use of "modern developments" gets new life breathed into it.

So:  what\'s my point?  For one thing I don\'t really think that a linear
development cycle of technology is vaild.  Sentient beings are too random to
have their creativity limited like that.  There is room in the universe for
many solutions to the same sets of problems. I seem to remember reading
science fiction and watching in the visual arts scenes where a character
that was in the know looked at somebody\'s starship and said "it works but we
don\'t know what makes it work."   The other guys had solved the problem of
covering large distances in space in a reasonable time quite differently
than the paradigm that the main characters of the story were used to.

Playablility issues with the above:

Having said all that, some points to consider...

        +       Many was the time where I was GMing a game and I wanted my party
                to encounter a ship and I didn\'t want to spend 3 weeks
designing it
                and drawing it.  There was no need for that detail.  There
needs to 
                be a mechanism that allows GMs to produce a ship that is within 
                game balance ("... should be 100KT is size and armed to the
teeth..")
                without fleshing out details. 

        +       There also needs to be several types of ship design methods.  I 
                loved High Guard and the MT ship design rules drove me nuts.  I 
                still can\'t design ships with it.  For folks who can wade their 
                way through that stuff it needs to be there as it *does* produce
                elegant looking designs.

        +       If there are considered to be multiple drive technologies
out there
                then rules would be needed to cover fitting that
matter-anti-matter
                drive into that TL12 ship that the crew of which happened to
steal.

You simplify here...

quite often the first round, or first several rounds are going to 
miss the target.  A forward observer not only calls in the fire, but 
also gives the artillery instructions to adjust the fire.  He needs 
to know communications, trajectory, and the capabilities of the gun 
or craft he\'s directing fire for.  In late 20th century combat, this is with 
artillery pieces a few miles away or aircraft coming in on the fly.  
With fire coming from say, an Imperial battlecruiser in orbit, the 
need for a good Forward Observer will be even more acute.  

True, not everybody wants to get into heavy military adventures, but 
the capability should be there if somebody wants to.  TNE\'s biggest 
mistake, IMHO wasn\'t virus, it was the fact that they spent 2 years 
publishing nothing but military adventures for the system.  I don\'t 
think T4 wants to make the same mistake in reverse.

Great, that makes it 4 out of 63 who expressed any liking for book 2 
at all.

The survey was posted twice in the 10 days it ran.  If a larger 
number of people didn\'t respond, this would seem to indicate they 
really don\'t care what they wind up with (or just lurk).  I venture 
to say that there are very few people out there who want to return to 
Book 2.  This is reflected by the fact that virtually EVERYBODY who 
responded (90%+) was familiar with Book 2, and yet only 3 people out 
of the 58 who expressed familiarity with Book 2 want to use it again. 
 Heck, although I didn\'t keep numbers on this, I seem to recall that 
probably 10-15 of those people sold their CT books at some point.  
The VAST majority of those who still use the CT rules, use High 
Guard, not book 2.

On the other hand, if you want to use book 2, even with T4, no one is 
going to stop you, so go ahead.

My understanding of this skill (as used in the army, which may just
invalidate what I say here ;>) )  was that an armorer was one who was
skilled in weapons repair.  Each unit in the active U.S. Army has a unit
armorer assigned to it to oversee the maintainence and so forth for the
unit\'s weapons.  I see no reason why this skill couldn\'t be used to cover
both armor and weapons.

How about a weapon that shoots lots of viscous gel/resin that incapacitates 
or immobilizes.  I think I read about that kind of thing in Time magazine a 
few months ago (really!).  I think they said that the stuff would dissolve 
in water or alcohol or something like that.  The weapon could be tanks with 
a hose, or something like just another type of grenade for a grenade 
launcher.  It would be great for riot control, and wouldn\'t tear out the 
insides of your starship either.

Character Types:
I suppose I could just bend the rules on my own to do this, but I would like 
it if the new character generation system allowed for the possibility that 
military (law enforcement and so on too) characters are still on active 
duty, and not every character need be a retiree/veteran (which is what CT 
implied).  After all, scholars and performers will likely still be "active", 
right?  It would be interesting to have the players be Imperial Navy captain 
and officers or something.  They would trade the access to resources for 
having to follow orders, but they could have lots of power/leeway to make 
interesting decisions.  They could also have interesting responsibilities. 
 Kind of like Star Trek, I guess.

Skills:
I too would like to see more attention paid to categorizing skills 
carefully.  I\'m glad many people have suggested this.  It would help the 
referee to include new house skills because they would be easy to 
categorize.  I like the TNE skill categorization system, I guess.  If skills 
are categorized well, then we could have more of them and it would still be 
manageable (relatively).

Alternate Technology:
I realize the emphasis is on the canon universe, but I think that it would 
be more interesting if non-Imperial civilizations had a few unusual 
technologies to surprise the players.  This might be more important to the 
game than before, since one of the interesting things about Milieu 0 is 
exploring and contacting.  We\'ve already started down that path with fusion 
plus and the idea of using thrusters and HEPlaR together.

Just my 2 yen worth.

fighting other peoples battles.  Out of the party of 10 ended up a
corporation that was called "Armageddon Industries" that eventually, because
the ref at the time could figure out a way to put a lid on us, ended up
being a government unto itself.  Such experiences tend to warp a person\'s
perspective on things.

My longest running character is a retired Marine Colonel, Thul Jonson, that
made quite a name for himself as a repo man retrieving skipped ships. He
retired from that profession because he became *too* well known.

On the other hand when I\'ve refed campaigns in the past the types of
adventures I\'ve had in the campaign have run the gamut of exploration (my
personal favorite to GM), merchantile (read the book "Tai-Pan" by James
Clavell to get an idea of what I\'m talking about here.  Merchants can be
exiting folks if they are played well.) Of course, the odd military
adventure made its way in. 

Point being: In almost all of those adventure types rules from each were
needed to play any one of those.  Let\'s not throw out the bath water with
the baby.  (or is the other way around?) 

Let\'s see... ball, powder, patch, and then primer..  NO! WAIT! ... :)

Daniel,

I got to thinking about your reply and I realized that I responded 
a little harshly.  What can I say, I\'m part Irish & Scottish, and 
we\'re not exactly noted for controlling our temper...  :-)

I tried as much as I could to keep my personal opinions out of the 
survey.  I guess I got so angry at you because you made it sound as 
if I had some sort of personal agenda here.  If I did, my personal 
agenda didn\'t work.

Anybody whose read my opinions for very long on this list, 
will realize that they are quite a bit different from what the survey 
bore out.  I don\'t like FF&S.  I don\'t want to spend that long 
designing a ship.  I\'d much rather take that kind of time to detail a 
few critical NPC\'s, a few worlds, or write a few more adventure 
hooks.  My time is too precious to take the time to design a ship 
with FF&S.  I like MT, and may still use it if I don\'t like the less 
complex system that is being worked on as we speak.  It still gives 
me a reasonably detailed ship, and doesn\'t take long to do on a 
spreadsheet.

On the other hand, there are a lot of "gearheads" (I hate that term 
now just about as much as the word  "canon" on this list) who want 
that level of detail, and frankly, some of them present quite 
convincing arguments on why a FF&S style product is necessary.  I 
don\'t agree with them, but they are obviously passionate in what they 
feel, just as you are in your defense of Book 2.  They were also out 
there in much larger numbers than people who leapt to the defense of 
Book 2.

When 58 out of 62 people responding to a survey tell me they\'ve seen 
Book 2, and only 3 of those people say they still want to use it, I 
think my statement that "virtually no one wants to return to a Book 
2 system" is not jumping to conclusions without the data to back it 
up.  I recall Rob Miracle saying that there are about 500 people on 
the 2 lists about a month ago (maybe Rob can update this number).  If 
this is the case 62 is about 12-13% of that number.  That is a far 
larger sampling than most polls taken in other arenas.  Heck, 
presidential victories are usually called on less than 13% of the 
returns.  

No it is not scientific, and yes you can dispute the findings if you 
wish, but everyone on this list had a chance to make their feelings heard.  
If they choose not to do so, then as in any other democratic process, 
silence is assumed to be consent...  Obviously the majority didn\'t want 
to take the time to respond to a poll.  Maybe they don\'t care what the 
next system looks like.  Maybe they\'re shy or afraid of being flamed 
(although they had my e-mail address to mail it privately to me if they 
wished).  Maybe they didn\'t read either of the messages about it I posted.  
Or maybe they came to the same conclusions by themselves that the poll did.  
All I can do is report the results and draw conclusions based on the 
data I have.

I\'m sorry that the results didn\'t come out the way you hoped, but 
hey, they didn\'t come out the way I would have liked either...

Exactly! Only, I see that as an *advantage*. I don\'t like games where 
the sole determinant of a character\'s abilities are the basic stats. 
I prefer games where change is possible.

Not in my experience. I tend to have the opposite problem, that 
players *concentrate* on one or a few skills to a ridiculous degree.

And I ***HATED*** that rule. Didn\'t feel it made any sense 
whatsoever. But then, it was easy to rip it out of the rules... ;-)

Brief comment about the T4 Language skill.  The main problem with
making this a single skill per language is that if you have a
restrictions on the number of skill levels, a multi-lingual character
will need to scrifice other skills.  This doesn\'t fit in with my
experience - a lot of people speak several languages while having as
wide a range of skills as the next man - they can\'t all be geniuses!

The point is, I think, that many languages are sufficiently related
that once you learn one, others with a similar history don\'t require
as much of your "skill quota".  Thus, someone who speaks Italian and
German will have an easier time picking up other European languages.
Perhaps a language group which counts against the "skill quota", with
for example learning languages of different races or cultures with
radically different histories being a seperate group.

Yes, and I think that is realistic.

I must side with Marc\'s idea here.  I\'m a college language teacher and 
linguist and I know how much hard work it is to learn languages.  I think a 
whole skill is justified.  It may not be convenient, but it\'s not convenient 
in real life either.  And unless we want to go into the details of which 
languages are related closely enough to others to allow transfer of half the 
skill level for a cascade, the Language skill should not be a cascade. 
 Learning a foreign language well enough to use it is not a trivial matter, 
as I\'m sure many of you know.

Additionally, linguistics does not mean the learning of languages. 
 Linguistics is the study of the properties of language, not the learning of 
the languages themselves.  Linguists do not necessarily speak many 
languages, and multilinguals are usually not linguists.  Are all French 
Canadians who speak French and English as native speakers linguists?  It\'s 
the same as knowing music theory vs. being able to play an instrument.  It 
is possible to have one without the other.  One is knowledge, the other a 
skill.

Language (Specific) as a separate skill would also help simulate the 
necessity for having translators and linguists along, in addition to 
diplomats, when contacting civilizations after the Long Night.  There were 
1500 years for language change to occur, and that\'s time enough for 
significant language diversion; a different language could have branched off 
from the original Galanglic of 1500 years ago (OLD Galanglic).  All that 
time there was little or no contact with speakers of Galanglic on other 
worlds.  Many of these old civilizations might have even stopped using 
Galanglic in favor of a local language.  Language (Specific) would simulate 
the great language barriers involved.  Although I love Star Trek, I always 
cringe when they make first contact with a new civilization, only to find 
that everyone speaks perfect American English, and no-one even mentions the 
universal translator from the old show.  It takes away from the realism and 
suspension of disbelief (not to mention the fact that almost all the ridgie 
aliens look way too human).

Darn.  Roderick Elliott beat me to the goop-guns.  Oh, well.

I think limiting the skill to individual languages is fine, as long as
there are guidelines (that is, modifiers) for allowing characters to
understand/speak related languages.  As an example, fluent speakers of
Spanish have a reasonable change of understanding and speaking some
Portugese given a little exposure.

Alternately, the language skill could be modified so it is actually a
skill in a language family.  Thus anyone with the Language(Terran Romance)
skill could communicate with anyone whose language is derived or
heaviliy influenced by Terran romance languages.  It\'s a little
unrealistic, but not terribly so.

	Okay, while we\'re all revealing our personal academic 
affiliations, :-)  I\'d like to point out that there is not a _single_ social 
science on the skill list. What about scouts or scholars who want to 
study the peculiar organization and customs of planets isolated during 
the Long Night?  Or identify the important power blocs on a new planet?  
Or an Imperial agent who wants to determine the economic might of 
potentially hostile pocket empires in the empires path?
	From a role-playing perspective, an Anthropology skill could be
used like the old Liason skill to avoid cultural conflicts.  Political 
Science could be used to determine whether a balkanized world would unite 
aganist the empire or whether individual states could be turned.  It 
could also be used to deduce, from the power structure of a world, what 
underground or opposition groups might exist and what sort of people 
might compose them.  Economics skill could help a character discover that 
a world\'s industrial output was not sufficient to support the military 
that it displayed and that it must therefore be receiving outside help.  
It could also be used by merchant characters to determine the best trade 
routes in a new area or the best goods for trading.
	I realize that many people who write sci-fi and many of the 
people who play sci-fi games are from "hard" science backgrounds, but if 
we want to attract new people to the game, maybe adventure plots and 
skills that went outside this traditional domain would help.
	Thanks for listening.

Skills are only tools for the players to use.  A good player with a single
skill will always out play a poor player with all the skills.  Somehow I
think to many people have the idea that the game is about skills.

In Classic Traveller a surgeon was an individual with Medic of 3 and a dex
of 9+.  I see no need to complicate the game with to much detail.

Example of the use of a social/interactive skill during a traveller gaming
session:

GM:  You are standing before Luke Foobar, Arch Duke of the Zetta subsector.
What do you do?

Player:  I roll against my Wit/Charm skill!  I got a ten!!  Did I impress him?

GM:  Let me check the chart..  Why yes you did!  In fact he\'s so impressed
that he aggrees with your plan to use his private yacht as a pirate ship.
- ----
- ----

Perhaps we should let players do the social interacting for themselves!  If
a player doesn\'t enjoy (or isn\'t very good) at roleplaying social events.
Then don\'t try to change the rules to make it easy for them, change the
settings, change the problems.  With practice the players will develope the
ability to deal with these roleplaying situations.

If you think Traveller as proposed has too many skills, I recommend
Over the Edge. It surrealistically has a maximum of three skills which
double as stats and the player makes them up, subject to approval by

This is an opinion not shared by all players of Traveller.  Skills are also
ways to define and diversify characters, encouragements to role-playing, and 
goads to the referee to create appropriate adventures ("Hm, let\'s give the
Priest of the Stellar Divinity something to use his Philosophy skill on....").

In GURPS games I have seen many poor players who take overspecialized characters
(ones with only a few skills, but highly-developed ones) distort adventures or
situations to fit their narrow conceptions, stealing the limelight and the fun
from players with more diverse but perhaps not as limitedly competent characters.

The game _is_ about skills, and the characters who possess them.  It\'s about the 
different personalities and backgrounds of the people being portrayed and how they
cope with the obstacles and dangers that the referee presents, not about "using"
them as "tools" of the players to work through some glorified Scott Adams Adventure.

IMNSHO.  :-)

> Example of the use of a social/interactive skill during a traveller gaming session:
> GM:     You are standing before Luke Foobar, Arch Duke of the Zetta subsector.
> Player: I roll against my Wit/Charm skill!  I got a ten!!  Did I impress him?
> GM:     Let me check the chart..  Why yes you did!  In fact he\'s so impressed
>         that he aggrees with your plan to use his private yacht as a pirate ship.

This is a disingenuous example!  Any referee worth his salt should be able to do 
better (roll the dice himself to over-ride an undesirable result, ask the Player
for at least a description of the tack she\'s taking with Wit/Charm and assess
appropriate modifiers, subtract for unlikely suggestions (like the above), etc.).

How about:

GM:     You\'re at the reception, and you see Archduke Luke Foobar by the gravshaft.
Player: Why isn\'t he circulating more widely?  What\'s wrong with him?
GM:     You don\'t know.  He\'s just standing there by himself with a drink in hand.
Player: I roll against my Psychology skill.  Do I notice anything unusual?
GM:     <rolls dice> Why, yes.  He\'s gazing with a rather baleful look at the
          Viscount d\'Arcture, who\'s discussing his latest commercial success
          with quite a crowd of hangers-on.
Player: I sidle up to him and mutter something about how nice it would be if the
          Viscount were to meet with an accident.  I\'ll use my Charm/Wit skill.
GM:     <rolls dice> He looks at you with surprise and interest.  "Why, yes, it
          would," he says.  "Did you have anything in mind?"

Social and interactive skills _help_ players with deficiencies in these areas,
and provide the bridge to support them until they can do the sort of more
genuine role-playing that you advocate.  The trick is not to let dice rolls
_replace_ planning and ideas, but merely _supplement_ them.

For that matter, I\'ve also seen social/interactive skills used to _limit_
players who are more suave than their characters.  If the actor is playing
a low-life bum, the referee can use the character\'s low social abilities to
justify treating him properly, even if the player has a silver tongue.  :-)

There is a point at which your analysis breaks down.  There is a 
flaw in basing it on the European family of languages.  How much is 
the knowledge of Anglic going to help you in developing a knowledge 
of Old High Vilani, for example...  In the case of Europe, you\'re 
looking at a situation where in a day\'s drive you could tour 
enough land to encounter people who speak 6 or more different 
languages.  Not to mention the fact that 20th century Earth has 
instantaneous communications.  Frankly, without FTL communications, 
its almost certain that "Anglic" would evolve into a new language on 
worlds without a lot of interstellar contact.

To use your example, how much would the knowledge of German help you 
to learn Mandarin Chinese.  These languages developed on the same 
world.  Now imagine it on an interstellar scale.  I for one like the 
skill to be language specific...  

Your ideas on language group does have some merit, but would add 
another layer of complexity.  Still it is food for thought.

    'body' => 'Hi, everyone.  I\'m returning to the game after about a 10 year hiatus (couldn\'t find
anyone to play after I got out of the good ol\' USN) so my background is pretty much
straight CT.  However, when I started trying to get a group together here at the Black
Hole of Missouri, the general feeling seemed to be that the biggest problem wasn\'t so
much any given set of rules as it was the many different versions out there (CT, MT, 
TNE).  Anyway, here are a few thoughts on the whole FFSLite thing.  (And it *does*
need another name!  Maybe FFS Standard and FFS Professional after MS (tm)?  NOOO!! 
I\'m just KIDDING!! Don\'t shoo .. AAAAHHGGGG!!)

I like the concept of FFSL a lot.  I found these groups late, so I missed the survey.  
I was delighted when HG came out because I love to design custom starships.  I even had
a ref. who let me run a Nav. Arch. character.  But I don\'t think that 100% accuracy in 
technical theory or detail is *required* to make Trav. a good RPG.  After all, how
accurate would 1900\'s (TL 5-6) descriptions of TL 8 technology be?  And we\'re trying to 
jump ?000 years and 7 to 10 TL\'s ahead!  I would like to see a self-consistent set of 
rules and scientific assumptions which optimize playability without overtly upsetting 
what scientific understanding we can claim to have.  But this doesn\'t mean that my 
players (or myself) have to be whiz-bang technonerds! I\'m a bit of a gearhead my self 
(6 yr as a submarine mechanic and working on my MS in Nuc. Eng.) but my time is *very* 
limited (married plus MS work plus GRA not related to thesis plus ...) so somthing on the 
order of HG in difficulty would be just about right.

I think that the 6-day deadline on coming up with something is *very* unfortunate.  I
realize that there are limitations, but do we want to do this right, or what?  Anyhow,
a lot of my comments are probably moot, since the thing has been forced to take shape
by time damands, but here they are anyway.  If anything I say is *stoopid* due to my
lack of experience with MT, TNE, & FFS, I won\'t be offended if you say so, just so you
don\'t try to say _I_ am stupid.  OBTW, I like the civilized tone of this group! (If you 
want to reply re: my comments, please feel free to nuke everything above here!)


First off, I feel that one of the strengths of the HG system was that everything (pretty
much) was done as a factor (or maybe a 1st order polynomial) of the ship\'s displacement.
IMHO, if the ship could be designed this way, it would allow more variety than the 
\'standard\' hull sizes concept, which I always saw as a major weakness of book 2.  For
instance, your basic \'non-gearhead\' doesn\'t really care what material the hull/armor is
made of at a given TL.  If TL effects on mass, volume, and price could disappear into 
TL based multiplication factors for these items, it should allow more flexibility and 
fewer (or smaller) tables, without limiting upgradability to FFS.

Similarly, other (non-weapons) items could (?) be based on ship\'s displacement (or mass) 
as applicable, e.g. command space (bridge), fuel purification, etc.

BTW, what was ever the justfication for making computers so bloody large?  Maybe a 
plateau to the rate of growth of their capabilities?

Weapons are more complicated.  Maybe just a few standard sized mounts with standard 
weapons and UPP factors based on tech level?  Obviously, this is an area where some
standardization will have to limit selection to keep it simple.  It seems to be going
in this direction with the requests for designs of bay weapons et. al.

Speaking of weapons, I like the idea which was mentioned of using the old 1 hardpoint 
per 100Td rule, maybe with a multiplication factor based on hull configuration.  More
\'thumbrules\' like this are what I think might be needed, as long as they don\'t break
FFS rules.  Maybe the thumb rule (standard) designs would receive a discount at the 
shipyard, while full priced \'custom\' designs could have all the advantages of FFS.


One thing that I think needs to be remembered is that we\'re looking for the *BASIC* game.
The beauty of the original boxed set of CT (IMHO) was that anyone who was likely to get
interested in the game could pick the rules up in an evening.  If basic T4 comes out at 
this level, we can always add to it.  We do need to maintain compatability though!

Well that\'s enough babbling on this topic.  Feel free to flame my opinions at will, they\'re 
quite heat resistant!  But do try to explain any disagreements.

Thanks,

e-mail I fired off to David Golden about a week ago regarding guidelines 
for the new design system and some \'hooks\' the IG folks were attempting 
to work into the Milieu 0 scenario, specifically the benefits of the 
former Sylean Confederation\'s (now Third Imperium\'s) advanced 
technology.  From the start, I\'ve felt that the whole concept of "Fusion 
Plus" which, as initially presented, is an advance in fusion power 
technology that finally makes it possible for small craft (hulls less 
than 100 tons) to be run on fusion power, is artificial, unnecessary, 
somewhat hackneyed, and ultimately creates more problems than it solves.

I feel that the fusion power plant tables/formulae, as presented in FF&S, 
ought to be transplanted into T4 without modification.  They are more 
generous than any prior rules system, especially in regards to fuel 
consumption, and ought not to be made more so in order to support "Fusion 
Plus."  The advances in efficiency and minimum size owing to advances in 
relevant technology are already included in the table -- that phenomenon 
doesn\'t need to be further tweaked in.

An excerpt of my e-mail to David Golden follows:

Why this arbitrary distinction?  Sure, there are many other benefits to 
joining a higher-tech civilization, but is being able to FINALLY have 
small craft going to be the Great Big Impetus that leads to the growth of 
the Sylean Confederation and the inception of the Third Imperium?  Come 
on!  The History of Future Past has already been outlined, so don\'t bother 
yourselves with such a piddling detail.  There are so many other 
advantages to higher tech besides this totally artificial distinction 
about "Fusion Plus."  Hell, the sticks and stones folks will already be 
wowed by the higher power density, better laser performance, improved 
sensor performance, ad infinitim, ad nauseam, possible by tying their 
fortunes to a dynamic, advancing TL-12 society.  They won\'t be jumping 
around yelling "Martha, I can finally get my 50-ton cutter off the 
ground!"  They\'ll be muttering "gee, we\'d better make nice so\'s they 
don\'t use those nifty lasers on us!"

The fusion power plant table doesn\'t need fixing as much as IG\'s list of 
Milieu 0 hooks does.  Just figure out what the other, minimal power 
requirements are for a 100-ton ship using only 1-G drives, no lasers, no 
active sensors or other power-hungry items, and set the minimum size 
figure on the table so that you can\'t build a smaller ship unless you\'re 
willing to sacrifice crew comfort, cargo capacity, and profitability just 
so that you can accomodate a fusion plant.  Of course, someone might 
decide that it\'s really important that, in addition to all their 
shipboard systems, they also be able to power an average sized city, or 
three and a half discos.  Basically, don\'t worry too much about it.  
There are plenty of other advantages to higher technology that you don\'t 
need to go out of your way to come up with such a stale, transparent, and 
ultimately useless hook as "Fusion Plus."

Think about it:  Are there not plenty of alternatives for those who want 
to power a ship of less than 100 displacement tons?  How about nuclear 
fission, or fuel cells, or batteries?  Is the advantage of finally having 
a fusion plant small enough to run the dingy really big enough to have 
all of Charted Space beating down the Syleans doors?

- ----

So there it is.  "Fusion Plus" is an unnecessary hook.  There are many 
other things that the Third Imperium can do bigger, better, faster, more 
efficiently, and in a more pleasing range of colors and styles, than its 
surrounding neighbors can.  Hell, the ability to do Jump-2 (starting at 
TL-11) would probably be an even bigger sensation than the ability to 
run a cutter all year on two kegs of liquid hydrogen.

Well, that\'s as good a fix as any, I\'d say.  There\'s plenty of rationale 
for it to:  Optics at a given TL can only handle so much energy density.  
I\'ve heard that one of the problems with contemporary UV lasers is that 
contemporary reflecting and cooling technology can\'t deal with the heat 
they impart on reflecting surfaces.  Basically, the tiny amount of energy 
absorbed (and radiated as heat) is enough to cook the coatings right off.

Still, I could SWEAR that I\'ve seen that rule in print somewhere, and not 
just on TML.  This is going to cause me a lot of sleepless nights.  
Besides, I\'ve already used it.  The PC\'s wanted to put a Laser Barbette 
of Doom on their ship; I told them they were welcome to try to buy a 
reconditioned 700 Mj barbette from the Navy or search out a supplier of 
750 Mj models, but that was it.

    'body' => 'Howdy!  This is just a bit of an overview of my views on the skills thing.  I just got done 
waxing philisophical (or not) on T4 and some basic ideas I have in a mailing re: FFS Lite, 
so I\'ll keep this a bit shorter.  I\'m not going to comment on every skill (which doesn\'t 
mean I like or dislike any given one), but make a few more general comments.

IMHO, in keeping with the idea of a *BASIC* T4 that can be sold to a new (and non-gearhead) 
audience, we don\'t need to get overly complicated in defining all the skills. Maybe a 
supplemental publication on skills ... ?

As a for instance, let\'s look at medical.  For many of us, the following worked well enough: 
   Med-0 = mother kisses knee and puts on bandaid and knows not to put tournequet (sp?) 
around neck, 
   Med-1 = standard 1st aid such as taught in the military, 
   Med-2 = EMT/field medic, 
   Med-3 = (basic) doctor.
For others, splitting into specialties at Med-3 (or 4) and taking partial skills in other 
areas seems good.  e.g.: My combat doctor character (Admin-1, Medic-6, GC(Pistol)-5, ..., 
not necessarily a pacifist ;) ) specialized in Trauma(effective level 6), has a related 
ability of 5 in (Macro-)Surgery, and maybe a 4 in other specialties.  

Computer has also been commented on.  Face it, your average non-chiphead (not in this 
mailing list; maybe an MD who cares a lot about the preceeding) doesn\'t know and couldn\'t 
care less about the differences between hardware and software, much less AI, operations, 
programming, etc.  While most of us know that there are a lot of (critical) difference, they 
won\'t reduce playability if the group involved don\'t care about them.  ( ref: \'OK, the 
spaceport supervisor\'s left his office to check out your little diversion.  Yes, his 
terminal\'s powered up.\'  player: \'I\'ve got comp-4, and I\'m looking for the last month\'s 
cargo manifests.  (out of character) I don\'t know if it\'s AI, operations, or programming!  
I\'m a psychologist, for Pete\'s sake!!)

This wasn\'t well developed, but shows what I mean.  Most players have areas of greater or 
lesser interest, and this will be reflected in which skills they wish to expand.  Maybe a 
rule that any skill at a given level (4?) or higher must be specialized.  After all, my BS 
in Nuc Eng was very general, covering Health Physics, Fission power, fusion theory, 
requlatory concerns, waste management, radiochemestry, and a number of lesser topics.  My MS 
work, on the other hand, is concentrating on radwaste remediation, and specifically 
groundwater transport of nuclides.  However, I\'ve gained a lot of experience in researching 
and (with time and a successful research task?) could expand my knowledge in other areas to
meet or exceed that in my area of specialization.

I think it is definitely necessary to have a limited number of canon skills, particularly 
for the first release.  After all, you could have 200+ skills, and each of us would still 
find something we\'d like to add.  Limit the basic (official) amount, and allow refs to add 
via house rules.  It may, however, be a good idea to require new skills to have a canon 
skill to which they are identified for transplant to other games.  (I know this isn\'t always 
practical, but wouldn\'t it be nice?)

Default skills: how about a default number (6? 10?) of default \'slots\' which a player could 
select skills for?  Those skills not available for default (battledress!, etc.) would be 
identified.  Others would be limited by background (vacc suit-0 not likely for a ground hog, 
unless a SCUBA diver).  Most players would not have bow skill, but I\'ve messed around with 
them enough to have a bow-0, without living on a TL 5- planet.  This would allow a lot of 
background development without a lot of time, effort, or effect on game balance.

Comments on a few skills:

Armorer:  One who works in an armory?  IMHO, both (small) weapons and armor.  Low levels 
imply can maintain effectively, ensure continue to work, fit to individuals.  Higher levels 
allow repair, possibly with mech/electronics/computer/etc. skills as required/beneficial.  
Also maybe customize to an individual to improve effectiveness (after SORAG) or reduce 
encumbrance.  Only at very high levels, with additional skills, TL/item-specific training, 
and proper tools/materials/workshop would creation be possible.  Of course, may allow use of 
non-standard materials to simulate (limited) armor capability.  Higher levels may require 
cascading to weapons(slug/laser/energy) and armor(cloth/hard (ceramic, metal, etc.)/power).

Fencing:  If swordplay, this might be a high level speciallization under blade combat.  If 
dealing with grey goods, maybe streetwise?

Regarding some of the particular skills people are asking for, it seems possible to have a 
supplement which spells out some additional skills.  Alternativley, combinations of skills 
which give the desired effect.  (e.g. GC(Cbt Rfl)-3 + Vacc-2 + Elect-3 + Mech-2 = Armorer-2)
Once again, you\'ll never make everyone happy.  I, for instance, find a single skill for 
Engineering to be ludicrous!  But it needn\'t affect playability.  A few score skills which 
are fairly abstract seems a good idea for the basic version of T4.

That\'s all for now - for what it\'s worth! ;)

I always thought the sole determinat of a characters abitities to be the
experience and problem solving skill of the player.  A good player with one
skill will always beat a bad player with all the skills!

Only the GM should view the players skill list and stats as limiting
factors.  If a PC has to fix a radio and doesn\'t have electronics skill the
easy answer is to find someone who does.  Not change the system so that
every PC can fix radios.

Change was possible in CT, it had rules for gaining new skills and skill
levels.  And with the introduction of Instruction skill it became even
easier to gain skills.  Maybe that\'s why the limit of Int + Educ was included.

Maybe Marc can comment on why that rule was in CT and (hopefully) tell us

This is my suggestion how to handle computers and robots in Traveller. It
probably violates the canon, so feel free to criticize.

Computers become common at TL7. Prior to this TL they only count as
experimental. At TL8 one could expect a world wide computer information
network. Both TLs use only silicium-chip based systems. Computer programs
are primitive, userunfriendly and prone to errors. Computer systems are used
for data storage and processing but no complicate calculations like jump
point determination can be computed. Input devices are mainly keyboards or
(at TL8) pointing-devices. Output devices are (at TL8: color) screens and
paper line-printers. Best personal computers at TL8 are small laptops (about
3kg). Common personal computer capactiy: TL7: 0,01-0,1GB, TL8: 0,1-1 GB.

At TL9 standards make computer programs exchangeable. Because of some bad
experiences with defective programs, a paragim shift in software development
occures and programs are built of correctness-proven components. This slows
down component development and makes software expensive but it\'s the only
way to go. Although TL9 computers are 10 times faster than TL8 (which again
are 10 times faster than TL7) the new software architecture will eat up this
speed gain and computer system have an overall working speed similar to TL8
systems. Besides conventional chip-technology, self-connecting neuronal
computer systems are introduced (experimental). Computing speed is still not
powerful enough to do complicate calculations. Input devices are now speech
(very basic), touchscreens and keyboards. Output devices are flat high-color
screens and fast paper page-printer. Personal computers are so called
Consoles (2kg), computers build into paper-sized (21mm x 29,7mm) flat
touchscreens connected via infrared link to the world wide network. Common
capacity: 1-10 GB.

At TL10 there are now two kinds of computer architectures: super fast
processing chips (based conventional chips or (at higher cost) optical
effects) and self connecting neuronal network chips. The first kind of
systems has reached a processing speed needed to calculate jump points or to
do weather prediction. Of course, the much more greater effort had to be
spent on the right ideas and software. Huge systems of massive-parallel fast
Supercomps have to be connected to do such calculations. The needed software
is the work of a lot of genius scientists, written with the help of other
computer systems. The other kind of computer is used to simulate human brain
activity. The dream of AIs is still alive and still unreached. Neurocomps
are used for all kind of regulating-software and for building simple robots
(experimental). Because especially Neurocomps are very susceptible to
radiation and Supercomps have more calculation power, starships use these
conventional computers. In society, small computer become useful tools built
into nearly any device. (They\'re as common as cars today.) TL9 experimental
virtual reality programs are make perfect and become a common spare time
attraction. TL9 experimental human-computer- interfacecs are dropped (just
to avoid cyberpunk-like gear). Military is quite suspective about TL10
computers and stays with TL9 systems relaying more on humans than on
machines. I/O devices are the same as TL9 but speech recognation is settled
and speech output is common. Personal computers are most powerful Consoles
(1kg) with included folio-printer with reusable folios instead of paper.
Common capacity: 10 GB.

AT TL11 and 12 computer technology seems to reach its end. Supercomps became
more efficient, but only the latest TL12 computer has 10 times the power of
a TL10 one. Neurocomps obtain great improvements, they get cheaper and
smaller. Their computing capacity at TL12 is that of a TL10 Supercomp.
Software technology is still behind hardware technology and accients will
lower the peoples interest on computers. Software is written by three
different groups. Most people connect existing building blocks or
parameterize. This works by speech control. Some people write new software
blocks by connecting subblocks. This is called (graphical) programming.
Complex testing programs exists to help this affort. A few real programmers
write software that is then transformed with the help of development
programs to subblocks. About a dozen programming languages exists (which
have an abstaction level as for example a modern graphical design tool).
Beginning with TL12, computer networks will exchange calculation capacity.
Fast networks will make this transparent to the user.

At TL13, holographic output devices are developped and computer technology
is adjusted to utilize this devices. Neurocomps have now the capacity of
TL12 Supercomps. Faster optical-based computers replace electron-based
systems. Ship computers have now about half the size of a TL10 computer. To
calculate a jump point, the ship\'s computer, a network of 5-6 Supercomps and
Neurocomps tries at least 4 different algorithms to gain the needed safety
factor, retrying if some calculations differ. The algorithms are all of
heuristacal nature but improved since centuries. Robots become useful and
are introduced to the mass market. A Perscomp, a personal computer has the
size of a cigaret box (0,3kg) and uses a holographic output device and
speech input. It has only 1 GB capacity, but will contact other computers
for help. Because TL13+ computers can now break most codes in days, Imperial
bureaucracy distance more and more from computer technology. Information is
often exchanged but transfering the whole computers and not the data because
that\'s safer.

With TL14 and TL15, experimental biological computers become reality as
computer implantats to animals do. They have the power of TL9 Neurocomps.
Robot-programs are made perfect. Simu-AIs are possible. They have no self
awareness but are very good simulations of human behavior pattern. Computer
databases store now data of 1000-100000 GB.

On TL16, it is possible to build robots with human-like Biocomp-brains which
could be trained and instructed as real humans. AIs become reality. At TL17,
they can be built into robots.

At TL17 and beyond, synaptic links are possible and computers can be
connected with human brains. Computers work now at the speed of light and
have great self-programming capabilities.

AT TL20+ it\'s possible to build artificial life forms of any kind. Computer
have incredible knowlege because of access to myriads of information and
unbelievable computing power.


>From TL7 to TL9 the only common form of robots are primitive industry
robots. beginning with TL10, the first true robots (after Asimov\'s models)
are built. However, they have to be remote controlled.

Beginning with TL11, robot technology is supported by the Imperium to get
cheap soldiers or worker to settle new worlds. The first real successes are
made at TL12. Now robots are autonomous and able to perform simple tasks.
The military doesn\'t take long and abandon robots as soldiers after some
disappointing experiences. From there on, they are strictly against massive
usage of robots in the Imperium. An additional point for rejection is the
use of Robots by the Zhodani, robots are distrusted.

TL13 is the high of the usage of robots in the empire. In the year 298,
Makhidkarum Megacorp introduces the first autonomous robots.

I haven\'t cross-checked this list with Book 8: Robots but wrote this without
exact Traveller knowledge.  Key-event I looked up where the TL13 holographic
devices, the TL13 robots and the TL17 AIs. I still have the feeling that
TL14+ computers and robots are too familiar and some improvements could be made.

One last comment onto the drafted skill list. Interestingly, even native
speaker come up with different meanings for some skills :-) To reduce this
confusion, I would suggest to try to keep the skill names as simple as
possible, even if this means to avoid military technical terms.

It also could be helpful not to build skill names from occupations (as
forward observer or armorer) but to use names that describes the activity
(Repair (weapons) or Forward observing{?}) The majority of skill names
already follows the descriptive approach.

GURPS, in my oppinion, lacks from the problem of too much skills. Combined
with the free character creation process it\'s a nightmare for me to build a
character or worse, have to watch other people building their characters.
For occasional players, it\'s much easier to handle characters with less skills.

Here, I\'ve to agree with Jonas. I also like games more, where basic
attributes aren\'t that important. However, you haven\'t to enlarge the skill
set but only to use better rules to prefent overimportance of basic attributes.

A somewhat artificial relic rule to equalize player characters somewhat, I
believe. It should be needed in T4, I hope.

Languages could be cheaper to aquire or could be defaulted on each other as
a cascade skill.

Another solution would be that a character with Language-3 would know three
additional foreign languages, all at skill-2 (language skill minus 1). Okay,
a bit unrealistic, but simple. (And that\'s my excuse for nearly everything :-)

Well, theoretically yes, but in your example no :-) Italian is a Romance
language but German not. If you know Latin, you could read some Italian
texts and figure out its meaning, but you can\'t speak it. For example Danish
and Swedish are similar, Northern German ("Plattdeutsch") is similar to
Dutch and in lesser extent also to medieval English. Finish, although, is a
language not related to other languages.

To know and understand different dialects of the same or of similar
languages it would be sufficient to use the cascade skill rule, I would say.
Perhaps you woudn\'t cover these dialects with rules at all. To handle the
knowledge of very different languages (as for example German and Chinese or
Imperial and Aslan) one has probably to sacrify additional skill points.

What about Hungarian?  (It\'s also part of the "Finno-Ugric Family").

We know that the Terran Confederation and Rule of Man were characterized
by colonization by ethnic enclaves, so a lot of planets probably speak,
or at least use terms derived from, Terran non-Galanglic-precursor
languages.  In the millenium and more of the Long Night, I shudder to
think how many possible combinations and distortions of Vilani and
Anglic probably occured (linguists would have a ball with all the pidgins 
and creoles that would have appeared!).  And each minor race, both human
and non-, also has its own language (Suerrat, Geonee, Newt, Virushi....).

Of course, this is the Far Future, so language instruction has probably
been improved significantly.  In the interest of color and playability,
I think a single Language skill would work well.  It would allow the
possessing character to speak n languages (where n = skill level), one
at n, one at n-1, and so on, _or_ n/2, say, at skill level n/2.  So 
players could rank which languages they were best at, but not automatically
be savants.  This is just a thought: I\'ve by no means playtested it.

I think that perhaps the point we should all be looking at here is not how
many points a person has put into a language as when the language was
learned.  It has been proven that children are much more capable of learning
additional languages than are adults to this end perhaps we should say that
any languages learned as background skills (we can\'t ditch these they are
the skills that define our characters as individuals) should convay upon the
character total fluency where as any language learned after the character
begins generation, i.e. while the character is in career development, should
be bought at a point per level of proficiency.

This pretty much models the way we as human beings learn languages, if we
learn a number before we have mastered our native tounge we are not bound by
the conceptions of language that we hold to be true.

The problem we are dealing with here in the Imperium is not languages which
have originated on a single planet but rather languages which have been
developed on a multitued of planets in responce to a myrid of different
environmental conditions.  These languages would be completely unrelated to
any other in the universe.

It would be like trying to teach a Spaniard, Basque.  Though both of the
languages are found in the same geographic area, the Iberian Peninsula, the
tounges are completely unrelated, in fact basque is unrealted to any other
known language on the face of the planet.  A totally indepentent development.

I don\'t think a Terran native would have a hope in hell of understanding a
Vilani with a knowledge of Terran languages and imagine the havoc that would
insue when he encountered a Zhodani.  He\'d be totally screwed.

Yeah!!!  Absolutely right.  These are cultures that have been isolated for
hundreds of years.  There\'s a fair amount of time for indepented development
there.  Imagine how much the language has changed, not to mention the
cultural beleifs and such.  Mind boggling.

Actually, rockets use "rocket propulsion" like the V2 or Saturn V.  The V1 *Buzz

Gee... does this mean we\'re at TL14 or TL15 in the computer arena now?  I
don\'t think so... what I\'m referring to is the fact that we have 100TB
databases in existance now. In fact, I\'m working on a project now that is
going to call for 50Tb (50000Gb) in three different locations for a total of
150Tb. 

By TL14, my prediction is that you\'ll be able to fit that much data in what
is now being stored in the same footprint as 9Gb disks today.  At that point
100Tb databases are going to be child\'s play.  In fact, I\'m even wondering
if they are going to dispense with the byte count measurements of database
sizes and use some other not yet considered measurement...

    'body' => 'Hi all.  Here is my latest attempt as far as skills lists go. I welcome
comments, suggestions, information, corrections, additions and deletions.
I have tried to address several concerns brought up on the list regarding
various skills, and have tried to run the middle road between those who
want detailed skills and those who want broad skills.  I leaned a little
towards detail for military skills to satisfy all the merc types out
there, and I think the technical skills are a little on the detailed side
as well. Let me know what you think. 

NOTE ON SKILLS BY TECH LEVEL

I think skills should be understood to be mediated by the character\'s 
native TL.  Someone from a TL-5 world might have mechanic skill, but he 
won\'t be able to repair starship turrets (At least not  easily.  I\'d say 
give a -DM equal to the TL difference).


SKILL CATEGORIES

Skills below are placed in categories mainly for ease of organization.  
These categories could also be used in chargen, just like in 2300AD 
(e.g., you get x number of skills from Underworld Skills).

Skills come in several types:

(D) Default: represents a skill that everyone has at level-0.
	(DL): only individuals at low (3-) tech levels get this as default.
	(DM): only individuals at medium TL (4-8) get this as default.
	(DH): only individuals at high TL (9+) get this as default.
[I considered having Dn+, where n would be a specific tech level, but I 
think this is simpler and does the job just as well. Comments?]

(C) Cascade: represents a group of related skills.  Pick one of them and 
all others are at 1/2 level.

(G) Group:  represents a group of related skills.  Pick one of them but 
get level-nil in all others (or level-0 at GM\'s discretion).

Unarmed Combat (D)  
[I don\'t like the idea of distinguishing Brawling and Martial Arts.  Yes 
they are different, but they aim to achieve the same goal and have the 
same results. I would lump both into this skill.]



***ACADEMIC SKILLS***********************

Research (D)

Instruction  
[Not default, I teach and it took a while to learn.  Most people are 
lousy at it on their first try (many are lousy their whole lives).  Maybe 
I\'m too close to the problem, though...]

Science (G)
	-Astronomy 	: stellar processes and physics.
	-Biology	: Includes Xenobiology as a matter of course at 
high TLs.
	-Botany		:
	-Chemistry	:

of skills.  It represents knowledge about systems of thought and 
"standard" philosophies].
	-Political Science.
	-Psychology, applied [The "softer" side of psych, social psych, 
talk therapy, etc.]
	-Sophontology [this is a more universal version of anthropology].

skills.  It represents knowledge about belief systems, holy writings, 
etc. from various cultures]


***CRIMINAL/POLICE SKILLS******************

Blackmarketeer [Refers to the ability to find buyers for elicit goods.  
Not as easy as you think. Replaces "Fencing" which is confusing.]

Break and Enter [Replaces "Intrusion" which is not overly clear and 
sounds sort of immoral :-) ]

Bribery (D)

Disguise [not default, in my opinion]

Fast Talk (D) [Refers to convincing someone to do/think something by 
spurious logic and/or intellectual intimidation.]

(Fence has been replaced with Blackmarketeer to avoid confusion)

Forensics

Forgery [Definately not default, IMO]

Gambling (D)

Interrogation (D)

Intimidation (D)

Pickpocket

(Intrusion has been replaced by Break and Enter and Pickpocket)

	-Uniped 	: giant snakes, snails, etc.
	-Biped	: Ton Tons and similar beasties.
	-Multiped	: horses, hivers (who\'s driving who? :-)
	[Should one have to choose a specific animal instead?]
	[Again, I really don\'t think this skill should be default.]

Animal Care (C)  [includes training, maintaining, packing, and husbandry]
	-Choose specific animal.

Aircraft (G)
	-Helicopter	: copters, autogyros.
	-Prop Plane	: including VTOL at TL-7+.
	-Jet Plane	: including VTOL and trans-atmosphere at TL-8+.
	-Light-t-Air	: blimps, baloons.
	-Glider	: 
	-Jet Pack	:
[Can anyone think of others?  Are the last two too specific? I was 
thinking of lumping them into "Personal Flyer" or something like that.]	

(Astrogation has been replaced by Navigation and Astrography).

Communications (DM) (DH)

Computer (C)
	-Programming	
	-Repair		
	-Hacking
	-Applications (DH)

Craftsman (G)
	-Armorer	: weapons and armor repair/maintenance.
	-Carpenter	:
	-Smith		:
	-Machinist	: machine parts fabrication.
	[I\'d like suggestions to fill this in with]
	[There should be a note to players that many others may be 
created as desired]
	[Some craft skills will be (DL) at GM\'s discretion.]

Designer (G)
	-Spacecraft	:
	-Architectural	:
	-Vehicular	:
[Can anyone think of others?  This is supposed to be "engineering" in the 
20th century sense, but is called "design" to distinguish it.]

Electronics 

Engineer  [This refers to running and repairing starships as opposed to 
designing them.]

Farming

Grav Craft (C) 
	-Personal Flyer: grav belt, grav cycle.
	-Grav Vehicle (DH): air rafts of various sorts, including 
spacecraft when using antigrav.

Gravitics

Ground Vehicle (C)
	-Wheeled (DM)
	-Tracked
	-Hover

Mechanics

Navigation [Refers to spacecraft in jump space. Pilot covers navigation 
in real space. Orienteering covers navigation on planet surfaces.]

Pilot [Refers to spacecraft (of any size) maneuvering/navigating in real 
space. Ship\'s boat is eliminated and/or covered by Grav Craft]

Prospecting [Or is this just a combination of Sensor Ops and Geology?]

Robotics

Sensor Operations

 Space (G)
	-Pilot
	-Navigation
	-Engineer
	-Gunnery
	-Vacc
[Am I missing any here?]

Vehicle (G) (see individual skills for cascade options)

	-Animal (C)
	-Grav Vehicle (C)
	-Ground Vehicle (C)
	-Vacc Suit
	-Watercraft (C)

Watercraft (C)
	-Powered
	-Sailboat
	-Hover
	


***PROFESSIONAL SKILLS********************

Diplomacy (D)

Law

Medicine (DM) (DH) [I like the idea of Med-1 being 1st Aid up to Med-4 
being surgeon].

Performance (C)
	-Art
	-Dance
	-Drama
	-Music
	-Writing
	etc. etc.

Politics


***MERCANTILE SKILLS************************
[I\'d like formal definitions of the skills below, I\'m not sure what they 
refer to specifically]

Administration

Bargain

Broker

Steward (D) [where does this go? Professional Skills? Other Skills?]

Trader



***OTHER SKILLS**************************

Athletics (C)
	-Running (D)
	-Swimming 
	-Climbing/Mountaineering
	-Specific Sport

Carousing

Innate (G)
	-Carousing
	-Leadership
	-Streetwise
	-Liaison
[Missing any here?]

Jack-of-all-Trades [I picture this as a skill which enables your other 
skills to wander into neighboring disciplines.]

Language (C)
	-Choose a particular language 

[Note:  I think language skills should be given as part of the 
character\'s "background package" or some step which is not part of career 
resolution. This resolves the problem of "wasting" skills on gaining 
languages.  Having grown up in Quebec, I\'m bilingual, but not because of 
any "training"]

Orienteering [refers to navigating on planet surfaces]

Perception (D) [I don\'t like the idea of a seperate Observation skill.  
The argument was good, and I too am a good observer but bad perceiver, 
but I feel this dilutes things a bit too much]

Recon (D) [maybe we should call this skill scouting or something like that?]

Survey [could someone please explain to me what this skill is?]

Survival [Not default, lots of people have died cuz they didn\'t know not 
to drink salt water.]

seduction, carousing, tactics).  The way I do it is that I consider the
player to be taking care of larger scale stuff (e.g. what to say when
seducing someone), while the character and his skills are taking care of
details (e.g. body language and tone).  Thus, if you simply say "I seduce
her", bzzzt!  You lose!  You have to play out the dialogue and then make a
roll.  If your dialogue stinks, your roll better be pretty good, and vice
versa. 

To take another example, consider tactics.  You can\'t simply say "I come 
up with a brilliant battle plan.", you have to make up some sort of 
strategy.  Your character takes care of the details of how to make that 
strategy work.  I as GM will judge (yes, subjectively, and yes based on 
my own limited knowledge) whether it\'s a good strategy or not.  If you 
come up with a great plan, but your character doesn\'t know the first 
thing about tactics, he will bung it up in the details.  If you come up 
with a mediocre plan, but your character is a master tactician, he will 
"make it work".

    'body' => '        Here\'s another non-lethal weapon idea: Sandbag Jelly rounds,
shamelessly cribbed from William Gibson\'s Neuromancer, where they\'re
referred to in passing, but not actually used in the story.  I\'ve developed
the following from the term:  rounds with a flexible casing filled with gel,
that instead of penetrating the target, spread on impact, delivering kinetic
energy over a wider area.  I think someone floated an idea called a
"Slapper" recently.  Sandbag Jellies use the same principle (delivering the
kinetic energy from the round over a wide area, administering a blow rather
than a puncture wound), only the rounds wouldn\'t deform until impact.  I\'d
imagine that spreading into a disc form as in the Slapper proposal (if
memory serves) in flight would be, aerodynamically speaking, a very bad
thing and have a negative effect on impact velocity, accuracy, and range;
thus a sandbag jelly round would have a longer effective range, and be more
accurate.

        I think that a sandbag jelly round would probably require something
in the 10mm + caliber (largebore handguns, shotguns, riot weapons, grenade
launchers) to be effective. Rifling might pose a problem for the casings.
Unlike my Goopgun idea, Sandbag Jelly rounds could very well be used by
indivduals who were not in law enforcement; practically speaking they\'d be
identical to regular ammunition for the same weapon.  Thus, they\'d offer
non-lethality (if bruises and contusions administered to the target are not
a problem) while avoiding the size, weight and range disadvantages of
handheld Personnel-Immobilization Gel sprayers.

This is true but what happens when your GM knows some stratigie of his own.
Here\'s my problem.  My GM has spent the last year as a member of the
Canadian Forces Armored Recon Division.  Here\'s the problem I come up with
an idea, an idea that prehaps my character should know better than to do
considering the 12 years of military experience, so I make a tactic\'s roll
succeed and figure it\'s a good idea.  Unfortunately my GM realizes it\'s a
crappy idea and rather than pointing that out or perhaps saying, "You know
that goes against your basic training." or something he uses my own limited
personal knowledge against me.  Now when you\'re trying to enjoy a game and
your GM keeps fragging you it really bites.

Although it does keep you on your toes and we did have an interesting
discussion about booby traps and their purpose.  It still kind of sucks when
he nails you to the wall on something your character should have known
better than to do.

sophistication of technology required for ship to ship space combat would
make FO\'s obsolete at a certain point.  If a weapons system can  track and
hit a spacecraft (at a very great distance, at very great speed), then
surely hitting a target from orbit (nearer by, and moving, far, far more
slowly) must be within its capabilities.  I can see a battery of modern-day
howitzers needing some guy with binoculars telling them to walk the fire a
little east \'cause they\'ve missed a few, but if you\'ve got sensors and
weapons capable of ship-to-ship combat then frying a few tanks from orbit
has got to be a piece of cake.  The same argument would probably apply to
ground-based armaments...

        Even if cloud cover or other atmospheric distortions interfere with
shipboard targeting sensors (which is reaching, but hey), wouldn\'t it make
more sense to simply use targeting drones, which store more easily, remain
functional over longer periods of time, and pack sensors far more sensitive
than a human?  While Bob the  FO can identify a threat, speak into the mike
("This is Foxtrot-0-Bravo-Alpha-Romeo, I have, etc, etc, etc,"), a
hypothetical targeting drone could have been constantly relaying its
position via datalink, acquired the target earlier due to superior sensor
apparatus, and transmitted to the big guns a data pulse stating existence of
target, position of target relative to the drone, and the target\'s
direction, speed, astrological sign, hair colour, and sexual preference.  If
verification by human beings is required, it can transmit data back up to a
nice airconditioned workstation on board ship or behind the lines so that a
human being can decide whether to vaporize it or not.  And then the big
guns, wherever they\'re located, can aim and fire...

        I think that FO\'s would be a military specialty belonging only to
lower tech levels that just wouldn\'t be found later on (do U.S. Navy vessels
carry sailmakers these days?), and, therefore, its place on the skills list
could be used for something like, oh, say, anthropology :).

Counterexample of the use of a social/interactive skill during a 
traveller gaming session:

GM:   You are standing before Luke Foobar, Arch Duke of the Zetta
  subsector. What do you do?

Player:  I roll against my Wit/Charm skill!  I got a ten!!  Did I
impress him?

GM: Hang on! You have to tell me what approach you\'re taking first, 
and the better *you* play it, the more likely it is he\'ll react the 
way you want it. Remember, *you* play the character, the skill only 
add in what you (the player) don\'t know, or can\'t handle. So, what, 
exactly, are you saying?

Player: Oh yeah. Um. Okay, how \'bout this. <changes voice>"Lord Foobar, how pleasant 
to finally meet you..."

[Time passes in conversation while the player does his best, and the 
GM might occasionally roll dice/ask the player to roll dice to see if 
the *character* actually commits any of the social gaffes the player 
commits. Either way, after considering the conversation he figures in 
his mind how much it was worth, rolls the dice and (based on his 
knowledge of the player\'s social skills) determines that the player 
had indeed, through a combination of a good line of blarney and 
amazing dice rolling, somehow managed to convince the Duke.]

GM: "Your plan intrigues me. But this is not the place to talk about 
it. Visit my yacht tonight. We have much to plan..."

<Raises eyebrow> Your players must be miracles of patience and 
learning ability. I know I\'d jump ship from a campaign if the only 
character type I could play was a moderately shy programmer who 
*hates* standing up in front of crowds, couldn\'t maintain a witty 
banter if it meant his life, etc... (In other words, I roleplay to be 
someone else. Not to be myself in funny clothes... ;-)

Now, you are right to some extent. The skills/dice *shouldn\'t* 
resolve the situation all by themselves. And the GM *should* make the 
players stretch themselves. But a players who knows (virtually) 
nothing about a particular social (or whatever) situation should 
still have the possibility to succeed in such a situation. If his 
*character* knows how to handle it. The players must, of course, give 
input on what he intends to do. The more the better. But the 
*player\'s* ability shouldn\'t be the only thing that matters. Then 
you\'re just acting.

My last statement probably reveals a philosophical difference between 
us. I don\'t consider roleplaying to be acting...

As I develop safety critical software (FBW computers) I\'m in a good position to
comment on this. The places you need safety critical software are also the
places you need fast operation (we count nanoseconds of execution time and
machine cycles as part of development, and redesign if a routine takes too
long). You are also always on the cutting edge, trying to get maximum
performance from the architecture. What that means in the end is that languages
are simplified to their simplest, safest instructions, the ones that operate
quickly. You simply can\'t afford the processor clock cycles to allow for a
common, safe, slow component (which would have to have its safety reproven in
the particular application anyway). Even if the processor speed is increased
tenfold I can guarantee that the demands on the programme will expand to fill
that space, it\'s the way things work.

The steps are far, far more than that. Processing power is probably doubling
yearly at the moment.

Current (ie T7/8) speech input devices have already passed beyond \'basic\', the
only real limitations on them are the need to break speech into distinct words.
By the turn of the century they should probably be able to parse continuous
speech. Conversation parsing is something else entirely and an AI problem.

Short term (daily) and longer term (seasonal) forecasting has pretty much been
cracked already. The intermediate weekly forecasts still need improving in
accuracy, but the problem isn\'t computing power (though increased resolution
always helps in analysing any chaotic system and the greater the resolution the
more computing power you need) or programme design, it\'s the base understanding
of weather systems and the effects that contribute to them. It\'s the
planetographers/meteorologists who need to make the breakthroughs, not the
computer scientists.

Military systems are already completely dependent on computers. You don\'t so
much have a trigger on Phalanx or Aegis as a safety catch, given its head the
system will engage independently. Hi-tech fighter aircraft don\'t just fly less
well if the FBW system shuts down, they fall out of the sky because they are
unflyable by an unassisted human under _any_ conditions.

For me, DL, DM and DH seem to be sufficient.

I agress with you, no default, even for low TLs.
I would change this to (G) and drop Atlatl.

>["Armorer" has been placed as a cascade of craftsman, below]

I would include the ability to fix devices into the corresponding useage
skills (mainly Fire Combat and Battledress), as Derek sugested earlier in
this list.

>	-Short Blade (D): knives, daggers, blades...

"2 Hand Club" to be uniform?

>Environment Combat (C)

I would abstract this to "trained to fight in unusual environments" and drop
all cascades.

>Field Artillery 
>Gunnery

Are here great differences? Oh, some people would say, of course I suppose.

>Hammer/Axe/Mace (C) [Can anyone think up a better term for this?]

I wouldn\'t divide melee weapons so far. Perhaps impaling and slashing
weapons are enough. For a fantasy game, a broader diversification might be
useful, but I think just to provide some primitive barbarian skills, this is
enough.

>Heavy Weapons (C)
>[I would also include laser-based variants at TL 9+, and plasma/fusion

Will they really work so differnt that different (sub)skills are needed?
Isn\'t it all about targetting and pulling the trigger? :-)

>Melee Weapon (G) (see individual skills for cascade options)

I feel that a third level isn\'t a good idea. I would go with only this melee
skill and drop the cascades of these subskills.

>Ranged Weapon (G) (see individual skills for cascade options)

Same goes here.

>Slug Weapon (C)  [Each includes tranq, googun, and tangler equivalents.]

I don\'t think, that pistols and rifles should be D. Perhaps it\'s that way in
the U.S. but in most parts of the world weapons aren\'t freely available and
most people will have no training in these skills.

>Unarmed Combat (D)  
>[I don\'t like the idea of distinguishing Brawling and Martial Arts.  Yes 
>they are different, but they aim to achieve the same goal and have the 
>same results. I would lump both into this skill.]

I agree.

>***ACADEMIC SKILLS***********************

>Instruction  

Is this skill useful I a lot of roleplaying situations? It\'s also difficult
to learn Calligraphy and it\'s no skill in Traveller (yet) 

Science = natural science and Scolar = liberal arts? These are the
(translated) terms I would categorize the skills under.

>	-Theology 
>[This does not represent one\'s faith, which is outside the realm of 
>skills.  It represents knowledge about belief systems, holy writings, 
>etc. from various cultures]

That\'s the right definition, IMHO.

>***CRIMINAL/POLICE SKILLS******************

>Blackmarketeer 

I would drop this skill, because most social skills should be left to
roleplaying and selling "hot" goods isn\'t that different to selling or
buying any goods.

>Break and Enter [Replaces "Intrusion" which is not overly clear and 
>sounds sort of immoral :-) ]

I would prefer one-world skill names.

>Disguise [not default, in my opinion]

I\'d agree

>Forensics

I also could be a subskill of medicine, IMHO.

>Forgery [Definately not default, IMO]

Yes.

>Gambling (D)
>
>Interrogation (D)

To get information from a suspect or witness isn\'t that simple, I think. No
default.

>Intimidation (D)

I would drop this.

>(Investigation has been removed.  In my opinion it is a combination of 
>Forensics, Interrogation, Perception, and Streetwise.)

Then, it\'s a good canditat to include this skill and drop all other (just
kidding :-) Perhaps, I would drop Forensics and replace Interrogation with
(the more general) Investigation.

>***TECHNICAL SKILLS*********************
>
>Animal Rider (C)  [note, this is here because technically, it\'s a vehicle]

I would simply call this "Riding" and drop the cascade for simpicity.

>Animal Care (C)  [includes training, maintaining, packing, and husbandry]
>	-Choose specific animal.

Again for the same reason, drop C.

>Aircraft (G)

>[Can anyone think of others?  Are the last two too specific? I was 

Yes.

>(Astrogation has been replaced by Navigation and Astrography).

What\'s the need of Astrography besides Astrogation?

>Computer (C)
>	-Programming	
>	-Repair		
>	-Hacking
>	-Applications (DH)

Computer usage (Applications) should be open for everyone. No skill needed.
I would put Hacking and Programming together (even it Hacking is only a form
of creative application use but I need some more knowledge) and to repair
computers, I would suggest the Electronics skill. ("How many computer
scientists do you need to change a defect light blub? Zero. It\'s a hardware
problem.")

>Designer (G)
>	-Spacecraft	:
>	-Architectural	:
>	-Vehicular	:
>[Can anyone think of others?  This is supposed to be "engineering" in the 
>20th century sense, but is called "design" to distinguish it.]

I would drop this skill. 

>Engineer  [This refers to running and repairing starships as opposed to 
>designing them.]

>Farming

Isn\'t this a craft? (At least with my understanding of craft)

>Gravitics

Isn\'t this a science?

>Navigation [Refers to spacecraft in jump space. Pilot covers navigation 
>in real space. Orienteering covers navigation on planet surfaces.]

If that\'s no more, I would stay with Astrogation.

>Pilot [Refers to spacecraft (of any size) maneuvering/navigating in real 
>space. Ship\'s boat is eliminated and/or covered by Grav Craft]

Piloting a space craft is either done with some programming or the same as
flying with a grav vehicle, IHMO. Sophisticated controls will reduce the
needed instruments to a minimum. So I would introduce something like general
Spacecraft Operation add Spacecraft as subskill to the general driving skill.

>Prospecting [Or is this just a combination of Sensor Ops and Geology?]

No, I don\'t think so. I would see this as own skill, perhaps named Mining?

> Space (G)
>	-Pilot
>	-Navigation
>	-Engineer
>	-Gunnery
>	-Vacc
>[Am I missing any here?]

All skill are already listed anywhere. Why a special Space-Group?

>***PROFESSIONAL SKILLS********************

>Diplomacy (D)

I would drop D.

>Medicine (DM) (DH) [I like the idea of Med-1 being 1st Aid up to Med-4 
>being surgeon].

>Politics

What\'s that? Oratory? Diplomacy? Unscrupulousness? 

>Steward (D) [where does this go? Professional Skills? Other Skills?]

I would say professional.

>Innate (G)
>	-Carousing
>	-Leadership
>	-Streetwise
>	-Liaison
>[Missing any here?]

Where the difference between innated streetwise and normal streetwise for
example?

>[Note:  I think language skills should be given as part of the

Good point.

>Perception (D) [I don\'t like the idea of a seperate Observation skill.  
>The argument was good, and I too am a good observer but bad perceiver, 
>but I feel this dilutes things a bit too much]

Keep it simple.

>Recon (D) [maybe we should call this skill scouting or something like that?]

Yes, please.

>Survey [could someone please explain to me what this skill is?]

As far as I believe, a systematic scouting and cartographing of unknow
regions, or more general, the collection all all data worth knowing.

Still a large set of skills, but it looks good. I still prefer a more
uniform set of combat skills as follows:

Melee (Unarmed)
        Covering brawling and at higher levels artial arts.
        Also covering combat with iron-fists or similar weapons.

Melee (Blade weapons)
        Covering attacking, parrying and (at higher levels) fencing with
        pointed weapons.

Melee (Clubs)
        Covering attacking, parrying with hacking or slashing weapons
        where you have to wing your weapon instead of stabbing.

Melee (Polearms)
        Covering combat with long, mostly two handed weapons.

Missile combat (Throwing weapons)
        Covering targetting with throwing knifes, spears or axes.
        Also covers sling weapons.

Missile combat (Bow)
        Use of historic (curved) or modern (composite) bows.

Missile combat (Crossbow)
        Use of all kind of crossbows.

Gun combat (Early firearms)
        Covers use and maintenance of simple black powder weapons.
        Also covers the basic knowledge about these kind of weapons.

Gun combat (Modern firearms)
        Covers use and maintenance of modern slug weapons
        Also covers the basic knowledge about these kind of weapons.
        Gaus weapons are included here.

Gun combat (Energy weapons)
        Covers use and maintenance of lasers and plasma rifles.
        Also covers the basic knowledge about these kind of weapons.

Gun combat (Heavy weapons)
        Covers all kinds of rocket throwers, anti-tank weapons or
        heavy machine guns.

Hi, everyone.  I\'m returning to the game after about a 10 year hiatus 
couldn\'t find anyone to play after I got out of the good ol\' USN) so my
background is pretty much straight CT.  However, when I started trying 
to get a group together here at the Black Hole of Missouri, the general 
feeling seemed to be that the biggest problem wasn\'t so much any given 
set of rules as it was the many different versions out there (CT, MT,
TNE).  Anyway, here are a few thoughts on the whole FFSLite thing.  (And 
it *does* need another name!  Maybe FFS Standard and FFS Professional 
after MS (tm)?  NOOO!! I\'m just KIDDING!! Don\'t shoo .. AAAAHHGGGG!!)


I like the concept of FFSL a lot.  I found these groups late, so I 
missed the survey.  I was delighted when HG came out because I love to 
design custom starships.  I even had a ref. who let me run a Nav. Arch. 
character.  But I don\'t think that 100% accuracy in technical theory or 
detail is *required* to make Trav. a good RPG.  After all, how accurate 
would 1900\'s (TL 5-6) descriptions of TL 8 technology be?  And we\'re 
trying to jump ?000 years and 7 to 10 TL\'s ahead!  I would like to see 
a self-consistent set of rules and scientific assumptions which optimize 
playability without overtly upsetting what scientific understanding we 
can claim to have.  But this doesn\'t mean that my players (or myself) 
have to be whiz-bang technonerds! I\'m a bit of a gearhead my self (6 yr 
as a submarine mechanic and working on my MS in Nuc. Eng.) but my time 
is *very* limited (married plus MS work plus GRA not related to thesis 
plus ...) so somthing on the order of HG in difficulty would be just 
about right. 

I think that the 6-day deadline on coming up with something is *very* 
unfortunate.  I realize that there are limitations, but do we want to do 
this right, or what?  Anyhow, a lot of my comments are probably moot, 
since the thing has been forced to take shape by time damands, but here 
they are anyway.  If anything I say is *stoopid* due to my lack of 
experience with MT, TNE, & FFS, I won\'t be offended if you say so, just 
to you don\'t try to say _I_ am stupid.  OBTW, I like the civilized tone 
of this group! 


First off, I feel that one of the strengths of the HG system was that 
everything (pretty much) was done as a factor (or maybe a 1st order 
polynomial) of the ship\'s displacement.  IMHO, if the ship could be 
designed this way, it would allow more variety than the \'standard\' hull 
sizes concept, which I always saw as a major weakness of book 2.  For 
instance, your basic \'non-gearhead\' doesn\'t really care what material 
the hull/armor is made of at a given TL.  If TL effects on mass, volume, 
and price could disappear into TL based multiplication factors for these 
items, it should allow more flexibility and fewer (or smaller) tables, 
without limiting upgradability to FFS.

Similarly, other (non-weapons) items could (?) be based on ship\'s 
displacement (or mass) as applicable, e.g. command space (bridge), fuel 
purification, etc.

BTW, what was ever the justfication for making computers so bloody 
large?  Maybe a plateau to the rate of growth of their capabilities?

Weapons are more complicated.  Maybe just a few standard sized mounts 
with standard weapons and UPP factors based on tech level?  Obviously, 
this is an area where some standardization will have to limit selection 
to keep it simple.  It seems to be going in this direction with the 
requests for designs of bay weapons et. al. 

Speaking of weapons, I like the idea which was mentioned of using the 
old 1 hardpoint per 100Td rule, maybe with a multiplication factor based 
on hull configuration.  More \'thumbrules\' like this are what I think 
might be needed, as long as they don\'t break FFS rules.  Maybe the thumb 
rule (standard) designs would receive a discount at the shipyard, while 
full priced \'custom\' designs could have all the advantages of FFS. 


One thing that I think needs to be remembered is that we\'re looking for 
the *BASIC* game.  The beauty of the original boxed set of CT (IMHO) was 
that anyone who was likely to get interested in the game could pick the 
rules up in an evening.  If basic T4 comes out at this level, we can 
always add to it.  We do need to maintain compatability though!

Well that\'s enough babbling on this topic.  Feel free to flame my 
opinions at will, they\'re quite heat resistant!  But do try to explain 
any disagreements.

Thanks,

Matt McL

Rockets use the jet propulsion principle which involves expanding a hot
gas out the back o something.  The V1 was a ramJETS, the F-14 uses
turboJETS, the Saturn V uses rocket engines to produce a JET of hot
expanding gasses!!!!!

Howdy!  This is just a bit of an overview of my views on the skills 
thing.  I just got done waxing philisophical (or not) on T4 and some 
basic ideas I have in a mailing re: FFS Lite, so I\'ll keep this a bit 
shorter.  I\'m not going to comment on every skill (which doesn\'t mean I 
like or dislike any given one), but make a few more general comments.

IMHO, in keeping with the idea of a *BASIC* T4 that can be sold to a new 
(and non-gearhead) audience, we don\'t need to get overly complicated in 
defining all the skills. Maybe a supplemental publication on skills?

As a for instance, let\'s look at medical.  For many of us, the following 
worked well enough: 
   Med-0 = mother kisses knee and puts on bandaid and knows not to put 
            tournequet (sp?) around neck,
   Med-1 = standard 1st aid such as taught in the military,
   Med-2 = EMT/field medic,
   Med-3 = (basic) doctor.
For others, splitting into specialties at Med-3 (or 4) and taking 
partial skills in other areas seems good.  e.g.: My combat doctor 
character (Admin-1, Medic-6, GC(Pistol)-5, ..., not necessarily a 
pacifist ;) ) specialized in Trauma(effective level 6), has a related
ability of 5 in (Macro-)Surgery, and maybe a 4 in other specialties.

Computer has also been commented on.  Face it, your average non-chiphead 
(not in this mailing list; maybe an MD who cares a lot about the 
preceeding) doesn\'t know and couldn\'t care less about the differences 
between hardware and software, much less AI, operations, programming, 
etc.  While most of us know that there are a lot of (critical) 
difference, they won\'t reduce playability if the group involved don\'t 
care about them.  ( ref: \'OK, the spaceport supervisor\'s left his office 
to check out your little diversion.  Yes, his terminal\'s powered up.\'  
player: \'I\'ve got comp-4, and I\'m looking for the last month\'s cargo 
manifests.  (out of character) I don\'t know if it\'s AI, operations, or 
programming! I\'m a psychologist, for Pete\'s sake!!)
 

This wasn\'t well developed, but shows what I mean.  Most players have 
areas of greater or lesser interest, and this will be reflected in which 
skills they wish to expand.  Maybe a rule that any skill at a given 
level (4?) or higher must be specialized.  After all, my BS in Nuc Eng 
was very general, covering Health Physics, Fission power, fusion theory,
requlatory concerns, waste management, radiochemestry, and a number of 
lesser topics.  My MS work, on the other hand, is concentrating on 
radwaste remediation, and specifically groundwater transport of 
nuclides.  However, I\'ve gained a lot of experience in researching 
and (with time and a successful research task?) could expand my 
knowledge in other areas to meet or exceed that in my area of 
specialization.

I think it is definitely necessary to have a limited number of canon 
skills, particularly for the first release.  After all, you could have 
200+ skills, and each of us would still find something we\'d like to add. 
Limit the basic (official) amount, and allow refs to add via house 
rules.  It may, however, be a good idea to require new skills to have a 
canon skill to which they are identified for transplant to other games. 
(I know this isn\'t always practical, but wouldn\'t it be nice?)

Default skills: how about a default number (6? 10?) of default \'slots\' 
which a player could select skills for?  Those skills not available for 
default (battledress!, etc.) would be identified.  Others would be 
limited by background (vacc suit-0 not likely for a ground hog, unless a 
SCUBA diver).  Most players would not have bow skill, but I\'ve messed  
around with them enough to have a bow-0, without living on a TL 5- 
planet.  This would allow a lot of background development without a lot 
of time, effort, or effect on game balance. 

Comments on a few skills:

Armorer:  One who works in an armory?  IMHO, both (small) weapons and 
armor.  Low levels imply can maintain effectively, ensure continue to 
work, fit to individuals.  Higher levels allow repair, possibly with 
mech/electronics/computer/etc. skills as required/beneficial. Also maybe 
customize to an individual to improve effectiveness (after SORAG) or 
reduce encumbrance.  Only at very high levels, with additional skills, 
TL/item-specific training, and proper tools/materials/workshop would 
creation be possible.  Of course, may allow use of non-standard 
materials to simulate (limited) armor capability.  Higher levels may  
require cascading to weapons(slug/laser/energy) and armor(cloth/hard 
(ceramic, metal, etc.)/power). 

Fencing:  If swordplay, this might be a high level speciallization under 
blade combat.  If dealing with grey goods, maybe streetwise?

Regarding some of the particular skills people are asking for, it seems 
possible to have a supplement which spells out some additional skills.  
Alternativley, combinations of skills which give the desired effect.  
(e.g. GC(Cbt Rfl)-3 + Vacc-2 + Elect-3 + Mech-2 = Armorer-2) Once again, 
you\'ll never make everyone happy.  I, for instance, find a single skill 
for Engineering to be ludicrous!  But it needn\'t affect playability.  A 
few score skills which are fairly abstract seems a good idea for the 
basic version of T4. 

That\'s all for now - for what it\'s worth! ;)

I\'m sorry, but I don\'t see these two areas to be interconnected. For your
kind of software, this might be true, but generally, software that has a
mathematically proven correctness has no relation to software that has the
requirement to react as fast as possible (or in a given time-span).

A good example for a piece of software which should have proven correctness
is a compiler. Today every programmer blindly trusts on the tested
correctness of his compiler. A compiler hasn\'t to be fast. It a nice-to-have
but no critical requirement. Another example are operation systems which
provides the base for all application programs which depend on its
correctness and will fail, if the underlying OS fails (Windows shows this
much too often). And the common OS for end users hasn\'t to be fast but to be
usable easily.

To make the point: it\'s not only definite software that have to be proven to
work correct but *any* software need. Otherwise, someday in near future,
critical systems will break down. Same goes, of course, for hardware. But
it\'s easier to do (Intel provides the counter-example) and can be checked
with software to a high degree (you can notice that something has failed but
not what - perhaps it\'s the error-routine?).

It\'s my oppinion that generally the trend goes not towards simpler assembler
languages but towards higher, more abstract, languages and development
tools. (Look at IBM\'s Visual Age or ParcPlace-Digitalk\'s Parts for Java for
example). Textual languages will be replaced by visual or graphical "languages."

Do you use assembler-like languages because it\'s easier to prove? That\'s the
way to start, but when you have proven poof-programs, you can bootstrap to
higher languages and components.

It could be different, of course. But I would suggest exactly this trend
also for Traveller to give an answer why Traveller has relative simple and
slow computers which probably are "canon" to the game. Think of a computer
not as number cruncher but as generalized communication and working tool.

Yes, if you look at the processor speed alone. But if you compare the
application speed, you can\'t write your letters faster with a today computer
than with a 10 years old PC. Although, it has became much more comfortable.
And here is, where the processing power got lost.

And keep in mind, we need some manipulation towards the Traveller canon.

Let\'s distinguish experimental state and a state useful for the mass market.
Even today (at TL8), you can\'t go and buy your speech input program that can
understand any speaker, at normal spoken speed, and that understands the
meaning of informal sentences ("please copy the file" instead of "copy ++
file ++ A dot Tee Ex Tee"). Perhaps in one or two years, we will have
reached this state but today, it\'s still unavailable. So I think TL9 is a
good assumption.

And, using the rules as argument: we can\'t put all computer technology to
TL8 & 9 and have no further improvements because we can\'t extrapolate how it
could look like at TL15. ;-)

Correct. And this has to be also solved to use "real" speech input, IMHO.

Yes, agreed. Drop this argument. Problem with weather prediction is more the
mathematics of chaos theory than the processing power.

Well, definite not in Germany :-) But this is what I really meant: Computers
are seen as cars today. They\'re easily used by everyone but only a small
minority really understands how they work. They change from a technical tool
to a Perhaps one should compare this with TVs or radios.

Same is true for the European Airbus, AFAIK. After an accident they changed
the computers to only make suggestion but let the pilot manually override
certain command, I was told. Now, the crew can lower the landing gear even
if the computer is convinced it\'s already down for landing.

I thought it this way and I feel, sometimes in the future, the military will
notice this problem and try to change it. One approach is to improve
computer and especially software quality. Another is to use independent
computer systems to have a higher chance of working. 

This could be one reason, why Traveller ship computers are such bulky. It\'s
because the computer space is filled by heavy shieldings and a large network
of interacting and supervising computer systems.

Finally I would like to repeat my question? 

How could really advanced computers of TL14+ look like? Would we recognise
them still as computers at all? When will bio-technology will be introduced
(to make the virus at least possible, only at TL16+)? What\'s about
nano-technology?

I\'d like to get some feed back on a thought I\'ve got on this.  I know
that this audience may be heavy with those who like the full-blown FFS,
but picture yourself or your players in the position of having to whip
up a quick ship in 20 minutes or so.

My ship design experience has been with HG.  As such, I\'m used to most
components (drives, armor, etc.) being proportionately based on ship\'s
displacement.  I pick a tonnage, pick what drives and armor I want, 
pick weapons/defenses, calculate how much powerplant I need, add misc.,
staterooms, bridge, etc., and I\'m pretty much done.  This allows a lot
of flexability in a fairly short time.

I\'m not familiar with FFS, but from looking at the tables on Dave\'s 
page, it looks like most of the calculations are made the same way.  
The point is, I don\'t see a few simple multiplications as being terribly
restrictive.  There are so many ships already out there that anyone who
wants to design one should be willing to go to at least that much 
trouble.  Maybe we could add a catalog of off the shelf components like
CT2, but I hope we don\'t need that!

As far as I can see, it seems like where things might need to be simpler
is where there are a near infinite variety of available options, such as
in weapons design.  Create a few standard varieties based on experience
and make them the options.  And allow those who like greater detail to 
really optimize them with the full FFS.

I guess I\'d rather just a simple list of straightforward calculations,
even if they involve 3 or 4 multiplications at a time, than having to
wade through a ton of tables which limit me to \'standard\' hull sizes.

Comments, anyone?  Don\'t worry, I\'ve got my asbestos underwear on, over
my lead jockey shorts.  Flame away!

The definition of jet propulsion is "movement in a specific direction via the

Rockets, however, provide their own oxygen and do not require an inlet such as

Using the term \'jet\' informally, what you say is true.  In technical
terms, however, there\'s a significant difference between a jet and a
rocket. 

A jet is by definition an air-breathing propulsion system.  It takes in 
air through a forward inlet, uses various mechanisms to compress and heat 
this air, then ejects it behind the jet with higher momentum, thus 
producing thrust.  Therefore, a jet cannot operate in vacuum.

In contrast, a rocket carries on board all fuel and reaction mass.  It 
imparts high momentum to the reaction mass, either by external means or 
by liberating chemical energy in the mass itself, then shoots the mass 
out the back of the rocket, producing thrust.  Rockets work equally well 
in atmosphere or vacuum.

Germany was in fact experimenting with a *rocket* fighter (the Me120, 
possibly?) toward the end of the WWII; it used a non-air-breathing, 
all-fuel/mass-on-board propulsion system.

Certianly for a quick, bash it out ship for a single adventure this is the

To refer to the FF&S system as a few simple calculations is something of an
understatement.  One of the systems greatest problems was in the final few
steps where you had to put in a powerplant and allocate fuel.  Inveriably
you found out some where way up the list you\'d over budgeted the beast and
wound up starting all over again.

I\'m a great beleiver in the custom hullsize.  Talk a look at Dave Golden\'s
page to see what I mean.  The 120 ton Artemis is something I sat up for
hours figuring out how to cram everything into a single small hull.  It\'s a
cramped beast but they refered to the Victix as high strung, hell this thing
was way beyond high strung, it was damn near insane.

Question is, can\'t a lot of the stuff be done as straightforward calcs while
letting the more detailed stuff (like weapons design) be off-the-shelf?

Actually, I think the design is fairly realistic.  It reminds me a lot of
what I saw in the Navy; the average Traveller ship seems like a hotel!

I did six 70-day plus patrols on a Posiedon sub, and the quarters were nothing like 
Traveller (at least CT/HG) required even for military ships.  And the LA fast attacks
are even worse.  The CO & XO have separate staterooms, and other officers are 
stacked three high in a space ~3m x 2m, including bunks, foldup desk, & foldup
 sink.  The CO & XO staterooms are about 3m square and 3m x 2m, respectively, and
they share a head.  The other officers (~11-12) share a common head (3 stalls?).
Riders can be accomodated by wardroom benches which convert to racks.  The enlisted,
CPO & ratings, are all in racks stacked 3 high on either side of a passageway ~1m
wide, with access to ship stores in the deck of crews berthing.  ~ 90 crew share
2 heads on either side of the passageway from crews berthing with a total of 3
showers, 4 stools, and 4 sinks.  All berths (racks) are about 24 in wide except the
CO (and the XO?).  If I was on my back with one arm between myself and the
bulkhead, my other arm was in the asisle - you learn to be careful how you sleep.
Surface ships are in general more spacious, but IMHO, the submarine is closer to
what we want for starship design, what with volume restrictions and operation in 
an inherently hostile environment (vaccuum/underwater).

While I realize that this environment is too cramped for most people, what says
that the average person is able to serve in a spaceship?  The standard rules may
be fine for civilians, but seem excessive for military types or the hardy 
adventurer (obviously character dependant!).

You might be surprised!  <g> Being an insurance agent might be a bit
more than just writing the policy.

Example:  The players are employed as agents of the Actarus Starship
Assurance Corporation, assigned to investigate a series of claims on
missing ships on the route between Azur and Karob.  Is it an uncharted
astrogational hazard?  Pirates?  An organized insurance scam by the
ship owners?

Example:  The player\'s ship is hired out by a commercial policy agent
of the Imperial Insurance Company (\'As solid as the Imperium!\').  He
needs transport to various systems as he visits the branches of a
business his company is writing a policy for.

Example:  Cal Peecee spent 20 years as a commercial factor\'s agent for
Imperial Insurance, then one day he just decided he\'d had enough of
the sedate life on Sylean.  Taking his life savings he bought a
partnership in a tramp freighter and set off to see the galaxy.  He
doesn\'t have a lot of space experience, but he has contacts with
several dozen commercial factors, a good knowledge of commercial trade
in the Imperium, and a great deal of experience in negotiation
contracts.  He\'ll let his ex-military partners handle flying the ship!

How\'s that? <G>

Stefan, I\'m pretty good at using a computer...can\'t fix one. I\'ve been
driving a car *many* years, but I\'m no auto mechanic. I can use a dish
washer, washing machine, TV set and VCR, couldn\'t fix any of them! <g>

I went to the hospital the other day for some tests. The
technicians used some pretty sophisticated machines with some
complicated electronics inside. I wouldn\'t trust them to fix that CAT
scanner and then use it on me!  Would you?

Being able to use a device doesn\'t mean you can fix that device when
it breaks.  Maybe you can tell when it isn\'t working, make good
guesses as to why, and *maybe* fix simple malfunctions. Even an expert
user, doesn\'t imply much when it comes to repair.

Being able to fix a device doesn\'t mean you can really use it either. 
If you are an expert at repair it does imply you would be able to use
that sort of device a little, but not necessarily at an expert level.

I\'d say an expert at both use and repair is very rare.

ps.  Concerning meanings of words in the American/English language. 
It might be different in your native language, but we have many,
*many* words that are spelled the same and have different meanings. 
Words that are spelled differently, but sound alike.  Words that are
completely different, but have the same meaning.  It makes it tough on
us sometimes, but it also has wonderful opportunities for word play.  

The discussion of "Fencing" is an example:  Fencing in one context is
the art of swordplay, in a different context it is the skill used by a
\'Fence\' (a person who buys and sells stolen or blackmarket goods), in
a third context it is the act of putting up a fence..or the materials
that make up that fence.  It goes even further, someone might say "He
was fencing with words, fencing me into a corner."  Meaning:  He was
skillfully using words, overcoming all my objections and forcing me to
agree with him. Maybe!  <g>

Because of this wonderful diversity of meaning, we have to see words
within the context of a phrase or sentence before we can be sure of
its meaning (if even then <g>).

Actually, "Theology" is a skill.  Knowing the precepts, dogmas, and so forth
of a religion is an area of knowledge.  The (sad) fact that most church-goers
know little about these aspects of their religion doesn\'t invalidate it as a
useful skill.

(Parenthetical note: I\'m not trying to stir up an argument about a possibly
touchy subject.  Direct flames to me personally, not the list.  For the
record, I\'m an Anglican, warden of my church, and on the boundary between
inclusivism and pluralism.)

For many campaigns I could see this as a useless skill, because religions
don\'t really enter into the game.  But the same could be said for sociology -
many campaigns don\'t really have different cultures.  However, religion _can_
be important in daily life, and understanding how religions work would be an
important skill for a first-contact team to have.  

I would put Theology/Philosophy in the Social Science skill cluster.

Another thing I do with my students is use their character\'s skill/attribute

character\'s skill/attribute, the easier it would be to spot the message - but
the player would still have to do some work.

Actually, they had a Rocket fighter in the closing stages of WWII.  I 
believe it was the Me 163.  The designation was Komet.  It had a 
total fuel endurance of about 20 minutes, which meant it wasn\'t 
exactly built for long-range patrols :-)

The Komet was much more dangerous to its pilots than the Allies, btw. 
 I don\'t believe there were very many, if any incidents of the Allies 
actually shooting 1 down.  Reports of them exploding on takeoff or 
landing, were very common.  I believe they first saw combat in 
February or March, 1945.

And all this time I thought there was air in space, give me some credit!!!

Rockets still use the jet propulsion principle to propel themselves.
That was the point of my original statement.
There is no such thing as just a jet engine without some means of producing
the jet.  Turbojets compress air, mix it with fuel and burn it. So do pulsejets
they just do it differently,  Rockets mix LOX with Propellant or use Hydrogen
Peroxide (as with the German rocket plane the Komet it was called.) or
Hydrazine as in the case of many missile solid fuel motors to produce a jet
which propels them.

is that given jump drive, a simple astronomical sky survey in two
adjacent sectors will give you the positions of every star system for
*thousands* of parsecs, except where there\'s some sort of nebula in the
way. 

In actual practice, I expect that the Imperium Survey would do it like
this: 

Set up *several* observatories one parsec apart, plus some farther
apart for the future. Use a *big* precisely pointed laser at each end
to send atomic clock signals to the other observatory. This will
(eventually) give you the *exact* distance between the observatories.
What you do is compare clocks, which tells you (probably* how far apart
you are, plus, once the signal gets there, you echo it back to the
sender on another "channel", which refines the figures even more.

Meanwhile, you shoot pictures of the full sphere to a reasonable
precision and scan them into the computers. As time goes on, you
increase the precision. 

Once the 3.26 year lag has passed, you can start determining distances
by parallax. Once the 6.52 year round trip has occurred you have things
nailed pretty damn well.

I\'d expect that powerful radio transmitters would broadcast the time
signals omni-directionally as well. Eventually, this would give precise
distances for nearby systems. I\'d say that such "benchmark beacons"
should average one for every two subsectors or so. And be tied together
(eventually) with laserlinks to establish a "survey grid" (much like
the USGS system of surveying benchmarks in the US.

Once established (which will take quite some time), this is a godsend
for ships that misjump into empty space (if they have fuel for another
jump). Given the resources on a ship, it\'s a hell of a lot easier to
determine where you are by rigging up a big antenna and listening for a
while than it is by trying to match stars against a chart!

BTW, if IG is interested, I could expand this, and a few other ideas
into an article on surveying and nacigation, complete with "what do you
do if you jump into empty space" :-)

Note that the observations required to detect *planets* take
considerably longer than the ones required to establish the position
and stellar type of a star. So the maps for the "lost" areas should
have the stars positioned ok, and the stellar type should be known. 

As the survey progresses, nearer stars would get studied to see if they
had planets. This is going to take *years* of observation per star for
anything other than gas giants. So jumping out and looking is a good
idea.

Damn straight! Counter battery fire is murder.

Reminds me of an ex-friend. He used to talk about the time in Nam that
they needed fire support *now* (large numbers of NVA on the next hill)
and all the local units were "busy". Finally they patched him thru to
somebody he\'d never talked to before. They got the co-ordinates and
gave the usual "on the way" message. It seemed to take a bit longer
than usual. Then the other hill disappeared!

Seems he\'d gotten patched thru to the New Jersey.... :-)

Getting back to Traveller, if the ship is in a position to give support
from orbit, it *won\'t* take any "10 minutes". Assuming nothing more
than a boost that changes the *vector*, but not the velocity of the
projectile, fire from a ship 1000 km up, would impact in 125 seconds. 
Fire support ships are likely to be at more like *100* km, so it\'d take
13 seconds. And make a mess of whatever it hit.

Not quite. Space combat has the advantage that your target has to
behave according to the rules of orbital mechanics. That means that a
lot of forms of dodging we take for granted on the ground just aren\'t
possible. Predicting where the target will be is much harder.

Second, Forward observers are used for *indirect* fire. That is, for
cases when the unit doing the firing can\'t see the target. 

You will get better chances of a hit on the first shot as tech
improves. But you still have to deal with the matter of correctly
specifying *where* you are supposed to hit.

And while sensors get better, camoflage, jamming, and "spoofing" get
better too.

Remember, "default" means that players have skill level 0 in the skill.
In other words, they are allowed to *try* to use the skill. If archery
wasn\'t a "default" skill, then your character wouldn\'t be able to
figure out how to use a bow and arrow unless he\'d specifically *chosen*

The *modern* meaning or "armorer" is someone who builds, maintains (and
at higher skill levels) *designs* weapons, usually firearms. It\'s an
actual specialty in the armed forces.

Because then some idiot would think it applied to bicycles and

riding".

No. A cannon is artillery. Heavy weapons are thinks like .30 and .50
caliber machineguns, mortars, etc. They get carried by a "heavy weapons
squad" in a platoon (or is that company?). Anyway, they are "crew
served weapons". Portable, but requiring several people.

Melees are multi person fights. Also, "armed" could mean with clubs,
blades, whatever. :-)

"research" is a skill taught in secondary schools here. Things like
being able to look things up in the library, understanding *how* card
catalogs and the like help you find the info you are looking for. These
days, I\'d add some web-searching skills to it.

Research is merely being able to search for info you don\'t have in an
organized manner. It doesn\'t have any connection with science other
than as a skill you need to have to have to do any scientific work
other than perform experiments.

A forward observer is *not* someone doing recon. He is directing
artillery fire and other froms of "fire support". He\'s the guy in the
movies on the phone of radio going "Fire mission, grid xx." and "Drop
10 and fire for effect". The folks *firing* the weapons can\'t see where
they are hitting, so he has to tell them how to adjust their aim.

When drones are used for observing, the person watching the picture the
drone sends back has to have forward observer skill, or he can\'t give
useful instructions to the artillery battery. It\'s a skill that\'ll
alway be around until we get ammo smart enough to find the target on
its own.

This is a defendable point of view.  Just to play devil\'s advocate, small
hull size is an important part of the survivability of a sub, since it
contributes to the ability of the hull to resist exterior pressure: the
number one consideration, certainly.  For space craft, this is not exactly
true (sensor profile and radiation shielding are factors, though).  The
trade off of crew comfort (which is of some importance, if only in
simplifying recuiting) and ease and speed of movement though the ship
against the virtues of small size might come out with a slightly less
cramped optimum than your average attack boat.  Subs do how exceedingly
generous the traveller stateroom allotments are.

I don\'t think I was clear in my original post (by \'official\', I meant 
\'canon\'), which was in response to a question about the "thruster plate or 
HEPlaR" debate.  I think IG should go with thruster plates as \'canon\' but 
include HEPlaR (and stutterwarp) rules as well.  Wes Payne had said that IG 
needed to pick one or the other technology, because a ship using thruster 
plates instead "would have a huge inherent advantage over those using 
physically correct (PC?) HEPlaR drives, unless some game-balancing rule was 
imposed"  such as limiting what the excess space could be used for.  I agree 
with the diagnosis but disagree with the prescription; I think it can be 
balanced by making thruster plates a much higher tech level.

If GMs don\'t want to use thruster plates, they can use an alternative.  If 
they want to use both, then increase the TL needed for thruster plate 
technology.

Given that almost every Traveller player I\'ve ever met (either on the \'net or 
in person) has tinkered with something in the official universe, it makes 
sense to provide a few alternatives in the design sequence, even if those 
alternatives aren\'t supported with \'official\' ship designs.

No, but you _will_ get excited if you have a TL 15 HEPlaR ship and discover a 
TL 21 Ancients ship with thruster plates...

So you\'re saying you approve.

I watched every submarine movie I could just to design that beast.  Actually
it came through in a number of different modifications untill it finally
reached the stage it is now.  It orignially had two missle bays and no cargo
space but that got changed along the way as the design became tighter and
tigher.  Some one suggested I make the crew hot bunk it in an attempt to
save space and get some more cargo room.  I tossed the idea reasoning on a
ship this tight who really needs the stress of sharing your bunk with some
one else?

I\'m rather proud of her and I have two more designs to post to Dave\'s site.

Thanks for the clarification.  I knew that the plane existed, but had

        Since I started the (wrecking) ball rolling about the 
Religion/Theology skill I thought I should reply to some of the 
ideas and comment you have all sent.

First off, I do not see how a theology skill can be more shocking 
than say, a heavy firearms skill.  (No I won\'t go into the fact that 
both can cause people to die.)  A lot of people do have religions, 
and not necessarily the same as ours.  If I am shocked by the use of
another religion (especially a make-believe one!) in a game, then I 
am the one who is is bigoted and close-minded.  Everybody can profit
from a healthy exchange of ideas - especially in the field of 
religious beliefs, where a lot of ideas have the same sources.  If I 
really cannot admit another religion in your game, then I make sure 
my referee respects my wishes and only allow the religion of my 
character to come into play.  

Note that Traveller does mention religions in his rules, and one of
the leaders (Lucan?) is part of a well-known (Traveller) religious
group.  Traveller is not \'politically correct\' in that way, thank
God.  <grin>  (yes, that was sort of a pun :)

Anwyays. :)  Now that wasn\'t much of a help for the T4 skill issue so
let\'s move on to that now. :)

My original idea was to put the Religion/Theology as a Scholar skill.
After reading some of the comments I\'ve come ot the conclusion that 
my original idea was ill-defined.  We also have to take into account
that only skills that HAVE an effect on the game should be noted
on the character sheet.

1) Religion is NOT a skill.  It is faith in a system of belief.  
Therefore there cannot be a skill named \'Religion\' beyond what the
common practitionner of that religion knows.  If it is absolutely
required by the referee, he could add a Religion-0 as a default skill
for people who come from planets with heavy emphasis on religion.
However we can just treat Scholar(Theology)-0 as being Religion-0 so
we can save some room and ink in the book. :).  This skill would
be used most of the time to avoid a blunder and upset local mores.

2) Theology is the study religions, and therefore very much a
skill.  Only "scholars" have this skill and so it should be reserved
for that character class.  You should be able to study one or more 
religion - one can easily imagine running into a white-haired 
university professor who has spent his time studying the ideas 
common to two distinct religious groups at two opposite ends of the 
galaxy, and postulating a visit by space travellers, for example.

3) Sociology is a skill that CAN include the study of religious 
groups.  This skill can be a good thing to have for a scout, for 
example, and has good potential for role-playing.  Moreso than the 
Theology skill, which would probably only be used by NPCs in certain 
encounters (say for example, running into an Aslan priest and asking 
him about what happened to make the Aslan clans stop fighting).  A 
sociologist would be able to understand why certain rites are done 
and such - a theologian would know exactly what the symbolism of the 
rites are. Sociology skill should give a character the chance to 
avoid a blunder in any society.

So to resume my point:
Add a Scholar(Sociology) skill to the Scholar skills.
Optionnally, Give a Scholar(Theology)-0 (D) skill to characters from 
Non-Balkanised Religious places.
Optionnally, Give Scholar(Theology) skills to religious scholars 
characters.

Sorry for being long-winded, but I tried to take all comments into 
accounts.  I\'d like to conclude by saying that I think that Religions
already are a good part of Traveller and actually taking them into 
account in the rules can improve the game.

It has an article on the new technologies the US is using in Bosnia.

I am worried, though hopeful, that T4 will finally result in a SF game

>Draft List (Subject to Revision).
>This list provides the basic character types and the range of skills which
>will be available in the character generation process in T4.

>Consolidated Skill List (* indicates Default Skills [see below])

>Language (Specific)

I\'m pleased to see this, I think, after having had to make up my own
language rules for many years.  How do you imagine this skill working in
practice?  I\'ve usually broken language out somewhat as follows (this is not
complete and may have some inconsistencies, but I present it as something
that may help you formulate your use of this skill):

Language involves two sub-skills:  oral and written (in my own experience,
these are actually four skills -- speak, listen, read, write -- and I have
different abilities in each of the four in each of the seven foreign
languages that I know, but that much complexity isn\'t necessary or desirable
in a role-playing game). 

Languages are of two kinds:  native and foreign.  Languages fall into
language groups (Romance languages:  Latin, French, Italian, Spanish,
Rumanian, etc.; Gvegh languages:  Gvegh, Arrghoun, etc.).

A character can be a native speaker of up to two languages (determined
during homeworld and family generation).  Native languages need not be of
the same language group.  No task roll is necessary to communicate orally in
a native language. No task roll is necessary to communicate in writing in a
native language if Education 4+ (if edu 3, difficulty is difficult; edu 2,
formidable, edu 1 impossible).

Each foreign language is learned in two steps:  oral, then written.  So a
character would first get Zhetl/oral-1, then Zhetl/written-1 (if edu 3+),
and then would get to choose which to add.  So a character could have
Zhetl/oral-3 and Zhetl/written-1, or Zhetl/oral-2 and Zhetl/written-2, e.g.
I always assumed that characters learned at least basic writing skills.

Foreign languages may be learned before age 18 in school as well as during
character generation.  Education and social levels at age 18 determine
foreign languages, limited or increased by intelligence.  I don\'t remember
the details.

Foreign languages may also be learned during character generation.  I used
to add "language" to the available skill list where appropriate, such as
intelligence school.  The first time the PC got a language skill, s/he would
then roll against a table to see which language. Thereafter, s/he would have
to roll rank or something similar to avoid having to take another level of
the same language.  

To understand or express oneself in a foreign language in which the
character has no skill is an impossible task.  If the language is in the
same language group as one in which the character has any skill, it is a
formidable task.  The task difficulty is reduced one level for each two or
three levels of skill in related languages.  Only oral skill levels can be
applied to oral communication, and only written to written.  

To understand or express oneself in a foreign language in which the
character has any skill is a difficult task, reduced one level of difficulty
for each level of appropriate language skill (oral or written).

I don\'t remember how I handled hivers without a translation device.

I hope that you find the foregoing useful.  Please don\'t hesitate to contact
me with any questions.  I\'ve enjoyed the game for a long time (since 1978 or
\'79), and look forward to T4.

Good luck!

"Rockets use Jet propulsion."

I think it was quite obvious that the original author (who it was, I do not

technology used by the Reich for their Me 163\'s.

In my opinion this is an honest mistake that CT\'s designers made. By
far the worst offense was in computers but that was understandable
because in 1983 a cheap and powerful computer was a Digital PDP-11 and
the model of computing was time-sharing one powerful CPU. CT assumed a
linear evolution of computers along this model e.g. a more powerful
single CPU system, CT didn\'t anticipate the paradigm shift to a cheap
processor on every desk and communications in between model that we
have today. In 1977 the PC was little more than a toy with no
applications to take it from hobbiest circles that it occupied so who
could have guessed that in 1983 IBM would take the hobbiest toy and
turn it into a business toy sparking the entire microprocessor
industry. 

I do hope that the starships of T4 take advantage of cheap local
microprocessor controlled technology and networks much as cars and
racing sailboats do today. But I cannot blame them for not seeing this 
technology in 1977.

Basically, a rider is a person on board on a temporary basis who
is not a member of ship\'s force.  This may be an inspector, a 
tech team testing new equipment, or some kind of a special ops 
or spook group.  Since there is no room for \'spare\' berthing, 
this typically causes a shortfall of berthing.  This is more
likely in the case where equpipment upgrades have increased
crew requirements above design specs.  I know that my boat (a
posiedon type) had foldaway racks in the lower level of the
missle compartment.  My understanding is that it is not unusual
for the (very) junior (and unqualified) guys to have to hot rack
it (3 men/two bunks) on the fast attacks.

Agreed that the hull pressure issue is not an issue as such. (Unless you
have a team which likes to submerge, which I, playing with a bunch
of bubbleheads (USN slang for submariners), did run into.  As I recall,
was allowed by CT, or was it HG?  I\'ll have to check.)  There are
still considerations such as the amount of material required for 
construction, the price and mass of drives, fuel, etc., and the amount
of breathable air which your life support must maintain.  It seems that
the idea of ship design, particularly military, would be to minimize 
these for a given weapons capability, with some sacrifice in creature
comforts being acceptable.

Of course the sub is the extreme case.  Someone on one of the lists (I
think GDW-Beta) figured a 6k ton H2O displacement sub at about 450 Td
H2.  Picture a 450 Td SDB with a crew of 150!  At two per stateroom and
4 Td per SR, 75% of your craft would be berthing!  Even surface ships,
particularly smaller ones, cram the people in there, stacked 3 high,
albeit with a bit more width in and between racks.

The interesting thing is that this might properly be a cascade, with 
area(s) of specialization and lesser skill transfering to others.  For 
example, I hike and camp in the desert a great deal, and have made it my 
business to learn how to survive there.  I know about diagnosis and 
treatment of sunstroke and heat exhaustion, dehydration, cactus injuries, 
snakebite, and so forth, along with general first aid.  I know where I 
might find water in the Mojave...and also know how low the odds are that 
I\'d succeed in doing so.  *However*, I know zilch about, say, Arctic 
survival, or jungle survival, or grasslands survival.  Drop me onto the 
tundra, and some of my desert survival skills will transfer.  A lot 
won\'t, though.  Having a single "Survival" skill might be justified in 
terms of simplicity -- but it\'s not especially realistic.

In terms of back-country cluelessness, my all-time favorite story was of a
group who became lost on a desert day hike, and proceeded to climb *up* a
nearby mountain -- away from shade, rescuers, possible water, roads, et al
- -- because they decided they\'d be more visible to search helicopters up
there.  They were found (by searchers on foot, by the way), but it may
have been a net loss for the human gene pool that this was the case.

        Another drawback of the Me-163 was that one of the propellants
combusted on contact with human flesh.  The aircraft itself was apparently a
sound design from the aerodynamic standpoint; it\'s just that the lack of
landing gear (you took off from a dropaway dolly and skidded to a landing on
a ventral fin), and the unbelievably dangerous propulsion system had this
really bad synergy going :).

Include the "mechanical time" of making sure the correct round is loaded,
training the missle launcher, uploading the shot parameters to the missles..
now add crew fatigue and indifference (the "I\'m not being shot at" syndrome
that affects some artillery types).

And drones make people nervous.  There is only one reason to fly an
expensive drone over an area where it might take fire, and that is that a
world of hurt is planned for the region.  A trained FO, hiding in a bush,
can call in literally tons of fireworks without giving up the show.  The
first hint that something is wrong is the whistle of incoming (or, at higher
TLs, your point-defence gun opens up).

Picture the scene on most Fire Support ships...  panicked calls from all
over the planet, a limited supply of missles..

        But the point is is that dodging something like that 16" naval shell
from the New Jersey (to use a low-tech example) is going to be really,
really hard even if you\'re moving at 60 MPH, especially when it\'s targeted
with a system that can handle the demands of ship-to-ship combat.

        Right... and if you\'ve got satellites, ships, or other eyes in the
sky, there won\'t be much of need to put a lowly grunt, with a visual range
of a few kilometers and using the primitive MKI Eyeball, perhaps with some
assists, into harms way...

        Which, arguably, could be done more effectively and economically
with machines.  Why do you think the US puts so much money into spy
satellites and surveillance drones?

        True... My take on the FO thing is just that it seems to be the sort
of skill that\'d be very useful in the brief technological window between
getting decent artillery and developing good battlefield  surveillance
drones (which, I\'ll note, are already being deployed by many nations).
Gamewise, it strikes me as a rather specialized military skill that wouldn\'t
be found across as wide a range of planets and TL\'s as would any of the
social sciences, for example.  I guess it just depends on the sort of game
you\'re gunning for: if you want something with lots of emphasis on the
military, FO makes sense.  If you want a system that can reflect a broader
range of SF adventures, it doesn\'t...

    'body' => 'I can\'t exactly say that I\'ve been watching the ongoing T4 character 
skills debate with much fascination, but I now feel compelled to 
interject something into the discussion which I feel hasn\'t adequately 
been addressed yet.  No, I\'m not going to bore you with "my own" full 
list of skills for Traveller players, I\'m not going to repost someone 
else\'s list of skills with my own counterpoint-for-point comments after 
each one, and I\'m not going to go on about how certain skills are 
important or how others are not.

In Classic Traveller, it was not possible for a character to amass a 
great deal of skills during their pre-adventurer career, and the 
distinctions between different skill levels were not fine ones.  The 
INT+EDU limit on total number of skill levels knowable was, in my 
opinion, a somewhat arbitrary limit, but it did serve to discourage 
people from running excessively long careers during character 
generation.  One of the biggest pains in the butt I\'ve suffered as a 
referee is trying to find ways of integrating former colonels into 
parties of former lieutenants.

Also, in CT, there was quite a bit of difference between different skill 
levels, depending on the skill.  Medical-1, for instance, was a basic 
medic or EMT, while characters desiring to be surgeons needed to get 
Medical-3.  Level 1 was competent, Level 3 was expert, and anyone with 4 
or higher (except in combat skills) was nigh godlike.  When working with 
a 2d6 statistical range, it didn\'t take much skill to give a character an 
advantage.  Of course, one of my biggest gripes about CT and MT was the 
number of different modifiers one often had to dig up to resolve the 
results of task attempts.

With TNE, and its 1d20 statistical range, the calculus of character 
skills shifted quite a bit.  Now, it was possible for characters to amass 
a great number of different skills, or high levels in a few skills, over 
a small number of terms.  The balancing factor against this was that now 
characters had to have higher levels of a certain skill to gain the same 
advantages than they had to in CT and MT.  In order to gain the same 
effect of a level 3 skill from CT or MT, one needed at least 5 or 6 in 
the equivalent TNE skill.  The advantage was that, with a greater number 
of different skills possible, an individual character could be defined in 
greater detail.  A character that became a medical doctor in order to 
satisfy the prerequisites for getting into a career as a psionic 
researcher could be employed (in an adventurer capacity) as a ship\'s 
medic (normally a somewhat boring job) with some interesting diplomatic 
talents ("Wait!  You\'re not sick, you\'re just malingering!").  Of course, 
it was still possible for a character to take too many terms during 
character generation, or switch careers too many times, and come up with 
someone who\'s just "too big" for the rest of the party, which led me to 
impose some limits on what players could or couldn\'t do while rolling up 
a new character.  Some things never change.

One of the things that I liked about the TNE skill and task resolution 
system was that, provided you added up your assets (skills + controlling 
attributes) ahead of time, figuring out required rolls was quite easy -- 
just figure the target number depending on how difficult the task was (a 
multiple or fraction of the asset), and roll that number or less to 
succeed.  Rarely, if ever, did one have to dig around the rulebooks for 
all of the necessary modifiers.  Of course, this was a shock for players 
used to AD&D.  "I rolled a 20!  That\'s good, right?"

So, rather than arguing about how big the skill list ought to be or which 
one should be included at this point, perhaps it would be better to know 
how the character generation and task resolution procedures are going to 
go.  If opportunities to gain (or improve) skills will be limited, and 
there are significant advantages between different levels in a single 
skill (as in CT/MT), then keep the skill list small, and the skills 
themselves general (like Combat Rifleman instead of Rifle, Autorifle, 
SMG, Shotgun, and Laser Rifle).  On the other hand, if characters can 
gain a larger number of skills during their career, and it\'s easier to 
improve old skills and learn new ones during the course of a campaign, 
and if higher skill levels are needed to gain the same advantages (as in 
TNE), then the skill list should be more comprehensive, and the skills 
themselves more specific.

I\'ve been playing (and refereeing) Traveller since the Little Black 
Books, and of all the systems I\'ve used, I prefer TNE the most.  It 
allows the greatest detail for individual characters, and the wider 
statistical range allows a greater variety of possible results to a given 
task attempt.  Naturally there are some things I\'d change (such as 
Strength being the major factor in marksmanship), but I feel that, when 
compared to CT and MT, it offers the best balance of character detail, 
task detail, and ease of use.

I\'m not sure that I\'ll find arguments citing CT and MT as having simpler 
task resolution systems very credible, but I agree that the TNE character 
generation system can be a daunting obstacle to the new player.  What 
skills are important?  Which backgrounds offer the best skills?  Those 
are hard questions to answer for someone unfamiliar with the rules 
system.  If the new character generation system is going to be closer to 
TNE than to CT or MT, or if whoever\'s doing it is leaning toward the 
older systems because they\'re afraid that the new systems will be found 
to be too complex, I\'ve got a suggestion:

Obviously, pre-generated characters are out.  Who wants to run someone 
else\'s character?  However, you might try what other RPG systems refer to 
as archetypes (I first ran into this while playing Mechwarrior).  One can 
prioritize what they feel is most important for their character (such as 
skills, starting equipment, or other advantages).  These choices will 
lead to a list of what types of skills the character will have, and at 
what levels.  A possible example:  I want a former military character 
that will make a good mercenary.  Starting equipment isn\'t important (the 
patron will supply it, probably), but I want a few extra initiative 
points and rich parents, so my priorities are:  Skills, Background, 
Advantages, and Equipment.  The result is a three-term Marine officer 
with a social standing of 9 (not quite nobility), an extra initiative 
point, and a 0.75 modifier to starting cash.  The skill package includes 
two expert-level skills, three high-level skills, four mid-level skills, 
and six low-level skills, all chosen from the Army and Default skills lists.
Obviously, this example makes quite a few assumptions about the final 
shape that T4 will take, but hopefully it illustrates my point.

Interesting concept, but I, for instance, am at best a Swim-0 after 6 years in the
(US) submarine force.  Of course, the likelihood of swimming being terribly useful
 if a sub sinks if just a bit on the low side! :)

  Indeed - this is one of the things I positively detested from the CT
system. When GURPS appeared, it wasn\'t long before I was using that in CT
campaigns! Of course, this doesn\'t solve your modifiers complaint...

   Yep, it also allows creative players the leeway to have skills that
contribute to the atmosphere of the character without playability becoming
a worrisome factor.

   The TNE version of anagathics also cures a problem I\'ve had with CT and
the 2D6 range where very old characters can literally be the center of the
party and wear five hats, doing everything from piloting the ship to
patching the engines, to medicking the wounded. Not to mention,
shooting the turret lasers and repelling the boarders
single-handedly...(Yes I know you can limit the usefulness of this by
requiring crew at each crew for each "position", the point is these
characters are powerful beyond any credibility!)

   Age helps a LOT, my crew generally doesn\'t like aging their characters
much beyond the age 33 borderline, plus some of my guys are tech-heads
that like the Hiver academy! <g>

  That\'s one of the things I really liked as well, MT task resolution gave

  I\'m divided on this. Their rationale for strength with slug weapons
makes _some_ sense, but surely the benefits of strength are already paying
dividends in reducing recoil effects. I\'d be comfortable with AGL as the
controlling attribute for _any_ ranged weapon.

   This isn\'\'t an issue with anybody a play with. In fact, CT is often
roundly criticized around here for not having a complicated ENOUGH system.
IMO, any system that doesn\'t have the range of options that TNE does
seriously limits the playability of the game in that the player may not be
able to create the kind of character he wants to play. I\'m used to getting
requests on how to fit a particular character type into CT\'s rigid class
structure, and all I\'ve talked to like the flexibility of TNE.

   This is interesting. Are you thinking of the Shadowrun style priority
system? It\'s a good idea for an *optional* quick character generatuon
system. Say, allow players to choose between stats, skills, resources
(money, social, equipment), maybe even important contacts. This way
players just prioritize and select what stats/skills they want, with an
appropriate age assigned by the referee based on the type of character and
skill base.

I agree in principle that the tactics skill should be role played.
However, I also play as a PC in a Dark Conspiracy campaign. My
character is about as civilian as you can get: a 49 year old
laywer/mystic. I play with a group of young rhino-types that create
special forces characters. My personal background is well-grounded in
tactics. In the game I have to bite my tongue when the rhinos make
blunders.

In my own games of TNE, when the player is about to make a tactical
blunder, I have him make a tactics check. Success and I give him
insight. Catastrophic failure, I give him misdirection. Outstanding
success I give him an answer.

I feel that a multitude of skills allows the referee to assist the
players in the creation of their story. For this reason, I have no
limits on the number of skills that a character can *know*. I also
allow the players to propose new skills for addition to *my* universe.

Part of my attraction to Traveller was the multitude of skills with
which to define my character and his background. The rival system at
the time, D&D did not have a skill system. Characters could make and
did make up their backgrounds as they went along. Oh yeah, I passed my
Intelligence check, so I know all about Ancient History.

*Situations* should be role-played. Skills should be used to resolve
player actions from within the context of the situation.

Spent 14 years in the service, never was called on to swim. However, I

is a background type skill. Players in the definition of their

There were many *strategic reconnaisance* teams deployed across the

high tech TASMs, and optically guided air strikes. Simply put, what can
be seen from overhead, can be deceived on the ground. The periods of
orbits that satellites and drones can provide do not compare to the
several days that a SEAL team can provide to determine if that
baby-milk plant was really a chemical weapons facility. Or to tell the
striking forces which building in the facility was the actual
laboratory/production facility. Only observation over a period of days
could determine such a thing.

These kinds of operations require several skills. Survival,
concealment, FO, commo (to get the low-probability of intercept sat-com
working), stealth, the list goes on. These are real skills not the ones
we will use in T4.

By the way, what made CT Books 4 and 5 and later ones so popular? The
expansion of the skill list and the depth of character that the systems
provided? I wouldn\'t limit any skill lists at all. I would include
limits to the skills given the career selection that the player made. 

Maybe I am a wierd ref, but I make my players state their career
intentions before they go *shopping* for skills. If I detect that they
are shopping, I limit the time they are allowed to make their
decisions. They are usually sorry later. I intend this to be a part of
the RP process. Character development. If you want to play a series of
stats, you don\'t need to role play. I use the skills as a definition of
the character development, annotated after the career development has
been made.

In which case, they wouldn\'t have routed the support request to you. :-)

Ortillery *does* tend to require either a *huge* number of ships, or
having ships that are using their drives to "hover" over the area of
battle. (and no, I doubt that they\'d stay stationary. They\'d probably
be jinking like mad!)

Nope. The fuel was *behind* the pilot\'s seat. And you tried to make
*damn* sure that it was all gone before you landed. Being a
monopropellant, it had a tendency to explode if handled roughly.

The Komet used a built in belly skid for landing. The drop-off wheels
were for keeping the takeoff short and smooth.

I hope you are taking my suggestion about maneuver drives (that
you must do something about the amount of kinetic/fusion/etc.
energy available as a planet-killing force) to heart.

I have a bit more to add about it. I know you like the idea of
using reaction mass, but the decision has been made to make
thrusters canon after TL12. Here\'s a way you can have your cake
and eat it, too:

 Use the "mass-nullifier" concept I proposed. This would allow
 non-reaction drives and would be incompatible with the old
 HEPlaR drives (which is good because one of those can really
 ruin your day at a spaceport/planet/etc.). These would very
 quickly become the drive of choice for non-military ships--
 they should be more economical as well.

 Now, military ships are likely to have a HEPlaR for backup if
 nothing else. If they find a way to combine it with the mass
 nullifier (e.g., large enough ships could leave their tail
 end out of the field), then they might have a maneuvering
 advantage over regular thrusters.

Note that I don\'t really care about the technology that is
used--I am trying to justify the Traveller universe, with
small-time ships flying into busy spaceports all the time.
I also don\'t care about what is aboard military ships, but
commercial ships must not all be potential planet-killers.

While we\'re on that topic, another piece of "canon" is the
fact that rifts without stars are a serious obstacle to
travel. In other words, deep-space jumps are either very
hard or are impossible. From an early-CT standpoint, they
were impossible. Future products stated their existence,
but I consider the organization of the universe to be the
true canon here. It is my opinion that you can reconcile
the apparent discrepancy by stating that gravity wells ARE
involved in jump dynamics. You cannot get too close to them
(the 100 diameter limit), but they are somehow used in the
jump (as a target reference, to help you enter normal space,
or whatever).

One way to justify deep space jumps/refueling stations is
to say that "dark matter" or other hard-to-find "stuff" in
interstellar space is used. Without this, deep-space jumps
are either impossible or at least risky due to targetting
difficulties (or require significantly more energy to get
into normal space, etc.).

(Sorry to have moved this discussion from X-boat to the
traveller list, but I\'m sure any interested parties are on
both.)

Actually, it was about 8 minutes, not 30.  And there was a throttle of

	If you don\'t have a religion skill, what are you going to tell all
those people who are taking Religious Studies and Theology courses?  That
what they\'re learning is really just general knowledge (based on INT/EDU),
or that they should be in the History or Sociology departments?  Theology,
like many other skills in Traveller, is an area of knowledge.  One\'s faith
does not necessarily come into it.  One does not really gain any skills
from being a member of a certain faith (at least no more than one gets
from being part of a certain culture, and we can\'t have a skill for each
one of those).  But one does gain special and extensive knowledge from
studying Theology, which is an area of research much like sociology,
history and anthropology, but which has its own domain. 

	A preist might have skills like Orate, Liaison and so on, but
these are not "Theology".  Theology is an area of study with its own
particular emphasis.  It is not history, nor anthroplogy, but a field on
its own.  One can debate the "usefulness" of this skill, but one can do so
with many others.  I think Theology definately has a place in Traveller.

Actually, default means that you can try a skill with out a -3 penalty.
There are many skills that are subject to defaulting.  I think most people
who have watched TV can pick up a bow and arrow and have a reasonable chance
of not killing a friendly and launching it somewhat toward their target.  I
don\'t think it should be a default more for the reason that if you default
it, you have to default a boatload of other skills, then all of a sudden,
your character sheet is real messy.

Since nobody else has yet replied to this, I feel I\'d better:

Even if someone can pick up a bow, and fire it in the general
direction of the target thier chances of hitting it without prior
training is going to be virtually nil, even after practising with it
for a while.  If my memory serves me correctly I\'ve heard the figure
of twenty years of training in the longbow as being not a bad starting
point for an archer.  If you\'re wondering at this point how the
English fielded so many longbowmen, training with your longbow on a
Sunday used to be required by law (only repealed early this century),
for every man and boy.

Archery should not be a default skill.

    'body' => 'I know now is not the time to make radical suggestions, but...I have a few
anyway, for simplifying the system

They aren\'t fundemental - they\'re the sort of thing that can be added
to later drafts, I think:

(1) Calculate all volumens in the classic displacement ton, not m3; round to
nearest m3 (which may result in some components, like controls, having
zero volume.) Rationale: fewer fractions for people to deal with, smaller
and less intimidating numbers, saves converting back and forth from
disp-tons

(2) Ignore power requirements for all devices taking less than 0.1 MW (for
starships, not vehicles, obviously.) Again, saves lots of addition

(3)(4)(5) and (6) all go together and are more controversial:

(3) Ignore mass
(4) Ignore surface area
(5) Limit starships to a certain maximum armor value as a function of hull size
(6) Limit number of weapons and sensors as a function of hull size

These would *really* simplify the system. If we set the limits conservatively
enough (the classic one turret per 100 Tons leaps to mind, for example),
the *results* will never be different from FFS - ships will always be lighter
than the Slop Rule, and always have unused surface area. FFS-lite designs will
also always be much less optimal than full FFS designs, but that\'s life - 
high-end warships will probably need full FFS no matter what. 

Opinions? This might satisfy the (few) people who want HG-level design while
maitaining upward compatibility with FFS. We could still include the mass and
surface numbers in the tables, but make calculating them optional for people
who obey a maximum weapons armor rule, as a compromise...

cc\'d to the TML because that\'s where the non-gearheads, who might like this
best, hang out.

The problem here is that firing a weapon is more a case of controling the
damn thing, than aiming it.  Basic Rifle Marksmanship stresses using
supported firing positions, keeping a tight lock on the weapon, and only the
most basic of aiming procedures.

I don\'t know how many on the list have fired a modern assult rifle, but they
are ridiculously easy to use.  For most, a simple "ring and post sight" is
used, and with experience and training, you find yourself ignoring even that
basic aid.  Most soldiers I served with could make snapshots by simply
aiming down the barrel.. if it seemed in line, they took the shot.

Let me admit it:  I am a klutz.  My Traveller character would have a DEX of
about 5, but I qualified Expert on the M-16A1, and later on the M-21.

For lasers, on the other hand, using AGL/DEX makes more sense.  This is a
"finesse" weapon, where reaction speed and steadyness of the hand are important.

        One of my refs, in a (vaguely) Traveller-derived game, didn\'t use
"character generation" at all -- he gave you a number of points, you decided
with him what background you wanted, then used the points to buy skills that
matched that background. With some slop for outside interests, hobbies, etc.

I\'ve got a number of questions and requests to ask of the general public out
there.  I\'m going to be taking over the TNE section of Dave Golden\'s page
and I was wondering if any of you with scanners would be so good as to send
me a number of graphic images.

1)  The Regency Insignia

2)  The Guild Insignia

3)  The Wild\'s Insignia found in the Reform Coalition Equipment book

4)  The Empire of Solee\'s Insignia (Personalities of the RC)

and finally

5)  A Map of all of Imperial Space.  Not one that show\'s stars just one of
the one pagers early on in the TNE manual that shows all the sectors and
subsectors.

Thanks to anyone who can help me on this.

There\'s another question that\'s again TNE related that I\'m dying to ask and
I realize that this kind of buggers up the T4 discussion train but here goes
anyways.

GDW, we all remember them don\'t we, was going to put out a suplement
entitled "Worlds of the Coalition".  It was to be a basic player\'s
supplement with enthnographic information reguarding each of the worlds that
comprises the Reform Coalition.  Does Imperium Games, specifically T4 have
any plans to resurect this supplement?

And can anyone give me more, canon, knowledge on "Spires."  Here\'s the
debait my GM and I are having, hell its more like a heated argument.  He
feels that the Spiri were abandoned on Spires during the Long Night and that
their technology degraded to it\'s current level, TL2.  I on the other hand
bleive that the Spiri were transplanted there by the Ancients and have since
developed on their own.  This whole argument is based on a single line in
"Path of Tears."  The line reads "Lacking fossil fuels or significant
surface deposits of useful metals, technological development stalled fairly
early, but philosophy and the arts flourished."  Now my whole argument is
premised on the words, "STALLED FAIRLY EARLY," as the line does not read,
"REGRESSED TO A LOWER TECH LEVEL" or some such thing I take it to mean Spiri
culture developed insitu and they would have their own unique language and
social customs.  Rather than just a diivergent form of our own western culture.

  Yes, but isn\'t that what your strength is doing in reducing recoil 
penalties? My view is that this is paying you twice for the same 
attribute, when using this skill.

  True, but again we could make the same arguments you make regarding 
assault rifles "ridiculously easy to use". If you talking single-pulse 
lasers I would agree, beam lasers or auto-pulsing lasers would make them 
trivially easy to use.

1 other thought on "Ortillery."  As somebody else said, what can be 
observed from the air can be faked from the ground.  Especially, when 
you consider that vehicles can be EMM Masked, and Battle Dress after 
a certain level will not leave a heat signature for IR to trace...  I 
think that there will always be a need for men on the ground to spot 
some targets.

Hi Jonas!

This works well if your players are, in fact, good roleplayers. However, there
are cases where players enjoy playing the game, enjoy "being there" and
interacting with the environment of the Imperium, but never really develop
differing character personalities.

It\'s not a disaster; the games I run are enjoyed by players and GM alike (ie
they\'re now threatening to hang me from my nunchuku unless I restart the game
_now_!). But high RP of the type you describe just doesn\'t happen. Our guys
aren\'t natural actors - but they love gaming.

This is where skills like Liaison and Persuasion and Trader and so on come in.
If a player weaves a skilled, well roleplayed depiction of the things his
character says and does to persuade someone or something, I\'ll perhaps just
check he _has_ the appropriate skill - and then adjudicate the results on the
value of the RPing. (Which is largely how Gensalorn works, as you know!). But if
the character is known to be articulate, persuasive and diplomatic and my dear
old tactless buddy Allan is playing it, the skills are there as a safety net to
maintain the consistency of the character.

They\'re also useful in the rare cases where someone is playing a stated bonehead
marine or thug pirate who has markedly _less_ social skills than the player can
depict - or if the character is struggling with a foreign language. The player
waxes lyrical about the effects they want, and the skill roll decides what
proportion of this actually transpires.

It is rounded down to the nearest whole number, in this case 0.  A primary
cascaed skill of 4 would yield an effective skill of 2 in related (sub)
skills, so would a 5.

Not to mention the fact that people build plywood replica\'s of things to
fool aerial recon.  The Nazi\'s did it with whole factories, the Iraqi\'s did
it with inflatable tanks.  

One of a defender\'s greatest advantages is being able to create more targets
than an attacker can properly deal with in an attempt to increase the
survival ratio of his limited equipment.

You need that man/woman there on the ground to confirm your sensor readings.
Don\'t forget there\'s likely to be some kind of atmospheric distortion
involved too.

You don\'t actually.  What\'s being refered to here is the GDW house rules
system.  Where a character, for ease of calculation.  Picks up 4 levels in
Slug Rifle.  With his strength of 8 that gives him a Slug Rifle of 12,
modified according to difficulty of course.  Because the character has 4
levels in Slug Rifle he automatically picks up Slug Pistol at 2 giving him a
Slug Pistol skill of 10.

If the numbers are not even, i.e. 1,3,5 etc.  round down (hey it\'s a cruel
universe).  This gives the character a skill of 0,1,2 you can do the math.

Actually it\'s a very good system for figuring out tasks because not only are
they tied into your skill but also your governing attributes.  Some people
are just naturally better at some thing\'s than the rest of us are.

Kinda adds new meaning to the phase "Express Elevator to Hell."

Trivia fact.  The Komet was test flown by a woman.  Can\'t remember her name
though, they found it rather difficult to get male volountiers to test fly
the thing.  This was all of the original test flights, not just one.

That was my understanding.  Much later people started talking about
jumping into empty space...I didn\'t do it like that, so I sort of
ignored it.

I agree, but I handle things a little differently.  Ships can Jump out
from empty space, in fact they can\'t jump until they get the ship well
over 200 stellar diameters out (about 2AU for a G2V star).  On the
other end, they Jump in very close to a star, or other very large
gravity source, (a gas giant won\'t do)!  Ships could jump from "empty
space" if they could get there, but they can\'t jump to get to empty
space.

This means that ships must travel from close the the star across the
inner system before they can jump out again.  If they are running from
pursuers, they will have to outrun them across the system before
jumping out.  If they are in a frontier system, they could be hit by
pirates during a period of many hours. If they are low on fuel, they
will make for inner planets (more likely to be inhabited) rather than
for the big gas tanks..I mean giants.

It means that misjumps will always put a ship near a star, brown
dwarf, or black hole.  The player\'s, now lost and out of fuel, may not
know where they are, but they are somewhere more
interesting than deep space...and with at least a prayer of surviving. 


It means that invading forces can\'t jump right to the gas giant, OR to
the planet they want to attack.  They come in close to the star and
fight their way out to the planet...or past it to the outer system
where they can jump out.

Lastly, the only way this works is to have an MDrive that can get a
ship from .1AU to 1AU in less than a day, and then out to 2AU for the
jump.  If ship\'s can build up those kinds of velocities, then you have
planet killers..in spades!  

So you have to find a way to put a speed limit on MDrives.  I have
come up with several ways to do that over the years:  

1.  Interaction between Tplates and velocity. The faster you go the
more energy it takes to go faster...a constant power in will result in
acceleration decreasing toward a maximum limit (no physical
rationalization).

2.  Stutterjump (or stutterwarp).  Your ship makes millions of
microjumps/second, each of less than a cm. They can\'t get
pseudoveolocities greater than a small fraction of c, but they can get
across a system nice and fast. Because the ship is jumping it doesn\'t
really build up an actual velocity to whack a planet. The microjump
also doesn\'t work within a diameter of a star/planet. So you need AG
or rockets to land or launch.

3.  Hyperdrive.  Different from jump drive/space, and could someday
provide an alterative FTL drive, but today only allows ships to travel
at a few percent of c.  Hyperspace, unlike normal space induces a drag
on objects, so you have to continuously apply thrust to maintain
velocity, and there *are* limits on actual velocity.  Ships use a
hyperspace "screw" where mass is swirled through a turning screw
extending into the hyperspace medium.  There the mass is accelerated
to speeds of several thousand c, propelling the ship forward.  The
mass looses coherence and emerges from hyperspace a few meters behind
the ship as a diffuse swarm of recombining quarks..visible as a
swirling bluewhite glow.

    'body' => '	Hi all.  Sorry if this topic bores some of you, but it fascinates 
me.  I think it is very important for an RPG to have a proper skills 
list.  For those of you who are less interested, I\'ve tried to minimize 
the length of this message.  I\'d consider moving this to the GDW-Beta 
list, except that I think it would get lost in the FF&S flood.  For those 
of you who are interested and wish to give me a point-by-point or 
otherwise lengthy reply, please respond to me directly so others don\'t 
have to pore through the long messages.  If you made a suggestion before 
and isn\'t implemented here, it doesn\'t necessarily mean I disagree with 
you, it may mean I simply forgot, so suggest it again if you think it\'s 
important.

	Below is "Mark III" of my skill list.  Again revised based on 
comments by various people.  Main points include:

o	The social sciences have been included in the form of Economics 
	and Political Science skills.
o	Geology is still included, but is now called Planetology to make 
	it more "universal".
o	Theology is still included as an area of study.  I consider this 
	to be nothing more controversial than the inclusion of sociology or 
	anthropology, and (IMO) it is not replaceable by any other social
	science as it is a discipline all its own.
o	The "Scholar" vs. "Science" distinction has been eliminated.  Not 
	sure how it would be implemented in the game anyway...
o	Weapon skills have been re-organized in line with several comments.

o	Default skills have been eliminated for the time being.  I now 
realize that default skills are a product of one\'s profession, culture 
and homeworld characteristics.  Instead of trying to take all this into 
account in a skills table, I feel default skills should be part of 
"background packages" or lists of automatic skills given based on career 
choice (e.g., Army characters get Rifle-0, Navy get Vacc-0).  I\'ve heard 
that such background packages will be part of MMT, and automatic skill 
have always been part of it, so I think this would be a better way to 
handle things.

o	Cascade skills have been revised.  I have not cascaded all the 
skills that I feel should be subdivided.  This is for two reasons: 1) It 
makes for too many skills, 2) It makes skills less likely to be useful.  
For instance, a character is not likely to be able to use his "Farming" 
skill often in adventuring.  This becomes even more unlikely if one 
subdivides it (even though there are good arguments for doing so in terms 
of realism).


SKILLS BY TECH LEVEL:  I think skills should be understood to be mediated 
by the character\'s native TL.  Someone from a TL-5 world might have 
mechanic skill, but he won\'t be able to repair starship turrets (At least 
not  easily.  I\'d say give a -DM equal to the TL difference).  
Differences in tech level which are too great should preclude any attempt 
at using the skill, at the GM\'s discretion.

SKILLS BY CULTURE/SPECIES:  Skills should also be mediated by the culture 
in which they are learned.  Someone learning medicine in the Sylean 
Federation will not likely be able to use their skills as effectively on 
other species.  Negative DMs would be given for alien surroundings (the 
more alien, the worse the DM).


SKILL GROUPINGS:  Skills are again divided into categories simply for 
organization.  The following sub-groupings are also used:
	(C) Cascade: represents a package of specializations in a 
particular field.  Pick one of them and all others are at 1/2 level.
	(G) Group:  represents a group of related skills.  Pick one of 
them but get level-nil in all others (or level-0 at GM\'s discretion). 
Sometimes, the group will contain cascade skills.
	(RPG) Roleplay it Gomer!:  This notation is a reminder that this 
skill should not replace roleplaying, but add to or enhance it.  Of 
course, this sort of applies to all of them :-).

	[In an interstellar community, Biology is indistinguishable from 
Xenobiology, IMHO.  Just as we study biology over the entire world (and

I have not included Skill Clusters such as those used in MT (e.g., the 
Space Cluster has Pilot, Nav, Engineer, Gunner, etc.).  I felt these were 
sort of redundant for the purposes of a skill list, though I would like 
to see them in CharGen for MMT.

That\'s it.  Once again, apologies to the uninterested.  As always, I 
welcome all inputs.

Actually, I managed OK as a Traveller character, once I remembered that
Medical-3 means that I\'m a doctor.  Thus, your Ski-3 means that you are as
good as a professional skier, Wheeled Vehicle-1 gives you better-than-average
driving (like 90% of people believe they are)...

Now, this no longer holds if you weaken the significane of skill levels.

No, the Komet had a bi-propellant engine, T-Stoff and C-Stoff, one of which is
hydrogen peroxide. Explosions were a problem, but more the fault of hard
landings rupturing the tanks, and even if it didn\'t blow the hydrogen peroxide

        Call it the Galactic Positioning System, or GPS :).

        Timothy Ferris had a similar idea, but one where the stations
function as automated *libraries*, as well as observatories.  Essentially,
they\'d serve as a galaxy-wide internet (with massive propagation delays).
Where radio emissions from an emerging planet were detected, the nearest
station would begin  recording data and beaming info towards it, and once
the new civilization picked up and deciphered the signal, it could download
and upload, the uploads being distributed around the net over the course of
centuries.  This presupposed no FTL travel of course; otherwise an emerging
and aggressive civilization could get its hands on all sorts of nasty tech
and emerge to kick some galactic butt :).

        OTOH, it might make a neat Traveller campaign if one were willing to
mess with the historical background.  The concept has lots of potential:
imagine a system of the sort set up just before the Long Night as a means of
bringing civilization back together again, but that never came fully online.
For whatever reason, centuries later the characters\' homeworld discovers the
existence of the net (which in the meantime has been gathering information
about hundreds of systems, aside from its library of pre-collapse knowledge)
and sends the characters out to the the nearest station to secure the
immensely valuable information, encountering all sorts of nifty hazards
along the way.  

        I can think of several others (pirates getting their hands on the
local station and wreaking havoc, factional struggle for control of the net
as it was being set up, campaigns based around discovery of and battle for
control of the net by several worlds, but I\'ll spare you all :).

Actually, you should have a single-jet, and a multi-jet, as well as 
single and multi prop skills.  There are differences between all of

        There\'s not that much converting back & forth anyway. Off the top of
my head, I can\'t think of a single place. Frankly, I\'d rather ditch disp
tons anyway ... they serve no useful purpose, they\'re inconsistent with
vehicles and they\'re a confusing unit for people ("100 tons ... that\'s not
very big" "One ton is fourteen cubic meters" "Oh, ok. Waitaminit ... you\'re
telling me my 2 ton car is 28 cubic meters!?!?!?" "No, that\'s a different
type of ton" "Ok, how much does my spaceship weigh?" "700 tons, fully
loaded" "Oh boy ... I need some excedrin" It\'s a volume measurement hiding
behind a mass name, referenced to an uncommon physical unit. Cubic meters
and mass tonnes are something much more familiar to most people, even us
jingoistic, stick-in-the mud Americans who refuse to rationalize. When
trying to explain something to somebody, it\'s easier to describe it in units
of "about the length of your arm" than "well, it\'s related to a vast
quantity of cryogenic hydrogen." But enough ... I didn\'t realize I had that

the top, and winds up much higher on later lines, I\'ll keep it in

>(3) Ignore mass

        Mass is pretty much ignored anyway. But it\'s in there for two
reasons ... some people want to know how heavy something is (yes, I know the
difference between mass & weight), and some people want to use this for what
it started out as -- a quick & dirty Fire, Fusion and Steel!

>(4) Ignore surface area

        Already written into the rules that you can ignore surface area in
favor of the "rule of thumb" of one turret per 100Td or one bay per 1,000Td.

        Puttin in a limit would actually complicate the rules right now, I
think. And I\'m trying desperately to avoid "arbitrary" rules.

        Already don ... either by area or by "one weapon per ..." If you can
come up with a good rule of thumb for sensors?

        They are optional.

Unfortunately as the ages have progressed it has become necessary to become
increasingly specialize in our feilds of expertise.  Back in the 1600 it was
all well and fine to be a Renesance Man but now a day\'s it\'s very different.
How many computer technitians can fix the monitor as well as the computer
and how many computer programers know how to figure out which chip on their
main board is fried.  Next to none I\'ll bet.

As things become increasingly complicated the human job market becomes
increasingly specialized.  It\'s just the way things work.  Lets face it by
the time the T4 time frame rolls around thing\'s will be even more complicated.  

Take your average engine.  Internal Combustion right, fuel injected or
carburated? computer controlled timing, electronic ignition, spark plugs.
Diesel or Gas.  The average gasoline engine mechanic spends two weeks a year
learning what the latest technologies are in his particular brand.  Imagine
if he had to learn all of the new motor advances on every engine designed
and constructed every year in the USA alone.  It\'s pretty mind boggling. 

Imagine if you had to keep up on advances in electronic, sensors, weapons,
gravatics, power plants and every other system that keeps the average
starship up and running.  I realize that the average starship engineer
devotes a career to a single ship but lets face it, the average navel tech
would be so specialize it\'s not funny.

"Hey buddy, this gravatic system\'s acting up.  You wanna fix it?"

"Sorry man, I do the magnetic focusing systems on partical accelerators, I
don\'t know a damn thing about gravatics any more.  I mean I took the entry
level course in the academy but that was twenty years ago things have
changed.  You want to talk to Dave over there, he\'s the gravatic\'s engineer."

The Discovery channel has a series called WINGS, one of the episodes
was on the Komet..veeeery interesting.  <g> 

The undercarriage didn\'t roll past the plane after it dropped off, it
bounced!  The wheel assembly didn\'t drop until the pilot pulled a
lever just after leaving the ground.  The carriage dropped off and
bounced, hitting more than one Komet on the rebound.  The results of
the wheels bouncing back up and hitting a tank of monopropellent can

Normally, a lurker (I\'m on 12 Mailing Lists) I had to mention:

Me 163 fuel was T-STOFF and C-STOFF. It had a tendency to eat through their
tanks. Occaisionally they\'d leak on the ground and the crew would find only
melted pilot. C-Stoff through chemical reaction would make bodyfat boil. The
fumes often killed the pilot despite protective clothing and oxygen mask.
The resources to this project if applied to the Ta-162 Volksfighter or the
Me-262 programs would have been a better idea. The decision to keep the
Me-109 line going after 1942 instead of pusuing the Me-208 or FW-190 really
destroyed the Luftwaffe (and not gearing up for wartime pilot training). 

But I digress, if you think the Komet was nasty,you should try the Natter, a
vertically launched solid rocket powered missle carrier. This probably what
a T6 or T7 culture would develop to fight in ultra-high altitudes.
Fortunately for people in the 8th Air Force most Natters blew up on the
launch pad during the flight testing phase in Fall 1944.

It depends on how you want to approach things, I guess.

Scholar - Studies existing data in a field and seeks new insights and
conclusions.  May or may not apply the scientific method to his
studies.  Most useful for re-examining existing data for new insights
and rediscovering old ones.

Scientist - Seeks new insights in a field through application of the
scientific method.  Proposes an hypothesis, performs experiments,
evaluates results.  Most useful for creating new data and discovering
new knowledges.

Example:  The University of Sylean receives a grant from Cleon to
reproduce the Thruster Plate MDrive used during the Rule of Man.

Scholar Zar digs through the archive\'s records finding bits and pieces
of data where T-Plates are mentioned.  From his search he reconstructs
how T-Plates must have worked.  

Scientist Flan forms the hypothesis that T-Plates worked through some
sort of gravity control. So he studies what is known about gravtics
and constructs a series of experiments hoping to learn how T-Plates
work.  

In this case either method might work, or fail.  The work of the
scholar would be very useful to the scientist.  The experiments of the
scientist would give the scholar more data to work with.

Both approaches can be useful, but they aren\'t the same.

Absolutely.  The format used to create starship and generally adventure in
CT and MT was a system that while created in a wonderfully interesting
setting forced the players and GM\'s to play inspite of the rules.  THere
seemed to be little rhyme or reason on how equipment worked or if there was
any kind of physical reality that it was based on.

PLAYER:  What is it?

GM:  Its a small back box 25cm by 25cm by 10 cm.

PLAYER:  And when I push the button?

GM:  You trigger a magnitude 10 earthquake that quickly sends the planet
back to the stone age.

PLAYER:  How did it do that?

GM:  Ummmmmm...  Its a sonic. . . no metaphysical. . . no hyperdynamic ...
awww crap, just trust me it flattens the planet.

What kind of a system is that to play in?  Things have to possess some kind
of hard physics behind them, even if the physics are far further advanced
than ours they still need to have some kind of logic behind them.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All TNE would add to this is a lot more "official" elaboration that would
be gobbledegook nonetheless . In the end, we still would have no real idea 
how something like this would/could work. Sometimes, in real life, we just 
don\'t know. I don\'t see why such an occurrence should be forbidden while 
role-playing. By adding all the extra complexity, instead of just letting
the GM free-lance in this sort of situation, you wind up restricting pos-
sibilities instead of expanding them. Complexity just for the sake of com-
plexity is counter-productive. FF&S is a prime example.

If you are dropping it from orbit it is effectively APFSDS. :-) Though
it acts a lot like HE too. Remember, the kinetic energy at 8 km/sec
(typical orbital velocity) is 7 times that of an equal mass of TNT. 
So there\'s no point trying for fancy round types.

Drones are getting a *lot* cheaper after a couple of fiascos where the
government contractors took a *cheap*, reliable design and made it
expensive and less reliable.

Since the missiles are essentially "smart crowbars" for attacks on
things like tanks, and "flying telephone poles for attacks on larger
things, the supply can be a lot bigger than you\'d think. Besides, you
are gonna have to "station" the ship over the fighting, or else have a
*lot* of ships.

Oh yeah. it just occurred to me that there might be a third "ammo type"
for ortillery. Something along the lines of the "lazy dog" they used in
Viet Nam. At a *high* altitude above the target the round breaks open
into several *tons* of 50 gram (2 oz) projectiles. Properly deployed
you get many per square meter, making things fatal for even troops in
battle dress! Near as I can figure, one ton of these, dispersed to a
density of 10 per sq meter would cover 20 hectares. At 1 per sq meter
it\'d cover 200 hectares. That\'s what I call cheap anti-personnel
rounds. :-)

Maybe you can send me a copy of the book? :-)

Anyway, here\'s what I came up with:

                           Navigation

Interplanetary navigation uses principles that date back to the 20th
century (Old Terran). Much like the Global Positioning System (GPS) of
that era, most systems in the Imperium have a number of satellites
scattered widely around the system. Each satellite broadcasts a data
stream consisting of its ID, its position relative to the mainworld,
and a precise atomic clock time.

Onboard a ship, a special receiver unit takes the data from 3 or more
such signals and integrates it to determine the ship\'s position to an
initial accuracy of 100 km or less. by using more signals and 10
minutes or so of listening to them, a ship can get a position to
accuracies of 1 km or better.

A portion of the data from the satellites is encrypted. Ships equipped
with the proper decryption circuit can get the 1 km accuracy
immediately. Such gear is reserved for the Imperial military and it is
a criminal offense to posses it without authorization.

In time of war the entire signal is encrypted, thus forcing non-
miltary users to go back to the methods used in undeveloped systems.
These amount to using the ship\'s radar and/or telescope to locate the
planets and determine the ship\'s position from these sightings with the
aid of an ephemeris for the system. This can take 30 minutes or longer
to get a fix that\'s only good to about 1 light second, unless they are
within a few light seconds of a planet.

This gives the Imperial military a distinct advantage when they jump
from or to a system equipped with SPS (System Positioning System)
satellites.


                         Imperial Survey

The Imperial Survey was established to help map both the existing
territory of the Imperium and the surrounding areas that had been lost
during the long night.

The mapping project started by establishing a pair of observatories in
the outskirts of a pair of systems one parsec apart. The line between
them became the baseline for the Imperial maps. (My maps are in
storage, so I can\'t check this, but it\'d be nice if one could be
"Capital" and another the system immediately "above" or "below" it, if
such exist).

The observatories each had large telescopes used for sky mapping.  They
also had a LARGE laser aimed in the direction of the other observatory.
The lasers were modulated with a signal similar to that used by the SPS
satellites.

Once the laser beam reached the other observatory (3.26 years after it
started), comparing the time information with the clocks at the
observatory gave the distance between them to an accuracy measured in
fractions of a millimeter. For additional accuracy, the time info was
echoed back to the originator over a second channel in the laser link.

Thus, after three and a quarter years, the length of the baseline was
known with incredible accuracy. And after signal info had made a round
trip (7.52 years total), the distance and relative movements of the two
observaties was known exactly.

With this info, the sky survey photos from the two observatories could
be compared for positional differences in the stars (parallax). The
parallax, plus the length of the baseline allowed precise location of
stars even *thousands* of parsecs away. Only stars oscured by dust
clouds and nebula will be hidden.

With positions known, other telescopes studied the nearer stars in the
uknown territory. With careful observations, it is possible to detect
gas giants, and even normal planets or asteroid belts. Even more info
is possible with careful study.

The initial parallax survey determined only position and stellar type
(O,A,B,F,G,K,M, etc). The follow-on surveys of stars can determine
*class* (ie the difference between a G0 and a G9 star) quickly.
Determining presence of gas giants takes a year or so.  Presence of
smaller bodies can take several years, and detecting atmosphere and
hydro (to the limited extent possible by astronomical observation)
takes even longer (a decade?).

This meant that it was determined that the best course would be to have
to survey determine positions, and presences of gas giants *only*, and
send ships to determine the rest. Thus was born the Imperial
Interstellar Scout Service.


                 Interstellar Navigational Grid

As a secondary goal, the Scout Service established a "survey grid" of
beacons that would allow generating even *longer* baselines for
observations, though at lesser accuracy. It also had an unintended
secondary effect of allowing misjumped ships to easily determine where
they were even if there are no nearby stars.

The "grid" consists of extremely powerful transmitters, distributed
throughout a sector. On average, there will be one for every two
sub-sectors. These transmitters send out an ID and a time signal. As
with SPS systems, and the Imperial Baseline, signal comparisons give
distance.

It wasn\'t until a liner misjumped and landed in "empty space" a parsec
from the nearest star, that the other use for these beacons was
invented. The ship had fuel enough for another jump, thanks to being
lucky enough to find a small comet-like body within manuever drive
range. But they didn\'t know *where* to jump, and while they were using
the ships telescope to attempt to match stars to their charts, they
weren\'t certain that they\'d be able to pinpoint their locate before
they ran out of food. (The telescopes on ships are *not* intended for
that sort of work!)

One of the junior communications officers had run out several
kilometers of wire from engineering spares to make an antenna. He was
hoping to be able to pick up an identifiable signal to help with
narrowing down the ships position. A navigotor wandered by as he tuned
past one of the beacons and recognized the signal for what it was.
Within hours they\'d reprogrammed an SPS module to handle the grid
beacon signals. And a week later they popped out of jump near a
starport.

The news of this "miraculous" escape spread quickly, and gear for
determining the ships location in interstellar space by using grid
beacons is now standard emergency gear.

Actually, that\'s close I believe, I\'ve been trying to find the correct 
spelling of Hanna\'s last name, but I also found out that she wasn\'t the 
only test pilot of the ME-163.  She was just the only WOMAN test pilot.

It never got beyond the test-pilot stage(I think) because their chief pilot

As has been previously mentioned here, and if you watched the Wings 
episode on the ME-163, you should realize that the Walther rocket motor 
was a BI-propellant motor.  Again, it used two fuels that were kept 
seperate until they were fed to the rocket motor.  These the Germans 
called T-stoff, and C-Stoff.  They were quite volatile when mixed.  
Seperate, they weren\'t too bad, unless you got some poured on you, in 
which case you simply dissolved to nothing.

I hate to nit pick, but the Volksjaeger was the HE-162, not Ta, that was 
the Ta-152, a further development of the FW-190 series, and a prop plane,

What was the ME-208?  I\'m not familiar with this particular model.

I must have missed something.  All posts I have seen have been in favor of
"First Aid" == medic 1.  That is the Traveller Way.  I can\'t possiably see
some one with First Aid-4 having a better chance to fix someone than a
Doctor which is defined in CT as Medic-3.  To have First Aid be a seperate
skill means that you have to give default First Aids to people with medical:

  Medic 1 = First Aid 2
  Medic 2 = First Aid 4
  Medic 3 = First Aid 6

Etc.

I think "First Aid" as a skill is a bad idea all together.  Use Medic for
what  its for:

    Medic 0 -- Able to render First Aid
    Medic 1 -- EMT/Nurse
    Medic 2 -- Paramedic/RN
    Medic 3 -- Doctor
    Medic 4 -- Specialist

We are discussing the skill list for Traveller not any other system.
Traveller has a way of doing things and you can\'t fractionalize a skill like
this.  This would be like taking Vehicle(ground) and breaking it into:
Sedan, 4x4, race-car. 
I would have a skill of race-car-5, but only a sedan-1, and have a worse chance
of driving the family car.  Some how I think that Michael Andretti can
handle the family car better than the average driver.  Medic is the skill of
fixing a hurt/ill body.  First Aid is the lowest level of that skill.

I don\'t think there is anymore canonical details about Spires.  One of
my players just rolled up a character from Spires, so I have been
thinking about it lately.  I assume it was an colony that regressed in
the Long Night.  If they were transplanted by the Ancients that would
make them a minor Human race, like the Vilani, Zhodani, Suerat, Geonee,
etc.  POT never makes any reference to this, so I tend to assume it didn\'t happen. 

Just what I think.

These things would have to be extremely powerful (to the point of requiring
small stars for power sources), and it would take decades before the "grid"
was useful, due to the delay in propagating the signal accross 30 light
years of space.

This all seems rather wasteful, when there\'s already a grid in place that\'s
usable by anyone, anywhere [*].  All a civilization needs to do is some survey
and calibration work.  There are quite a number of pulsars in the galaxy;
they produce a distinctive radio signal that slowly changes over time,
making it a natural "clock".  The pulsars are powerful enough that their
signals can be detected all over the galaxy.

Using the very-long-baseline observatories mentioned earlier, the exact
locations of the most useful pulsars can be determined.  Benchmarking
surveys both within and outside of Imperial territory can sample the
pulsar\'s signal, so that it\'s "clock" is known with a high degree of
accuracy.

Finally, with all of the information published, any ship, literally anywhere
in the galaxy, that has a set of IISS pulsar charts can determine where it
is in deep space (even in previously-uncharted deep space) with a good
degree of accuracy.  Well, that and a working radio communicator.

It\'s also and adventure hook: PCs in a scoutship could be charged with
performing a benchmarking survey: literally all they have to do is to travel
ten parsecs in a given direction, stopping for a while at each location
along the way to record singnals from the various pulsars.  And return.

The only thing that makes this challenging is that it\'s into relatively
unknown, unexplored territory.  The benchmarking has to be performed before
the survey work starts, so all they\'ve got to work with is a map showing
star locations and the presence or absence of gas giants.


[*] Anyone that writes an adventure crediting (or blaming) Grandfather for
creating pulsars as a private navigational aid had better write a _good_
one!

This was probably the thing that damaged the original Traveller system in the first 
place.  It bit, chewed, sucked and just plain smelled bad.

I mean I\'m all in favor of simplification but there comes a point when simplification 
goes way to far.  To say that there are only five grades of people doing medicine, 
computer programing or whatever is just plain wrong the world is more complicated than 
that and the game should relect that in such a way that it\'s easily role-playable.  
This five tiered system was the single reason that Traveller was a game you played in 
spite of the rules rather than because of them.  THe setting was probably the greatest 
sci-fi setting ever created, with only one personal exception of course, but the task 
resolution system stunk.

See I\'m not so sure, that one line just rankles my sence of completion.  
Somethings not right there and i just can\'t put my finger on it.  Plus the 
place was originally red zoned (if you read the codes and right up) why would 
they do that if these were just poor unfortunate Solomani settlers.  Plus 
there\'s the reference to surface metal deposits.  Now if you\'re a settler 
from a highly advanced world that really doesn\'t matter, mining is something 
you\'ve invented centuries ago.  However, if you\'re a developing culture, see 
the Aztecs, Maya and Inca, and you lack surface metals in any kind of 
quantity you\'re technology is going to stall out pretty quick and you\'ll be 
stuck at a lower tech level.

It isn\'t a five tiered system.  You can have a medic-8.  This would be like
the leader in bio-mechanics/bionics in todays society.    The point is CT
skill levels worked.  You could very well be a computer-8.  The point of
using descriptions to describe a level was to quantitate where a particular
person compares to a real world level.  Medic is the easiest skill because
there are licensed levels that compair to each level.  Brawling-0 means you
have been in a fight or two.  Brawling-1 = Hockey Player, Brawling-2
Amaturer Boxer, Brawling-3 WWF designated looser, Brawling-4 WWF designated
winner, Brawling-5 UCF champion, Brawling -6 Black belt etc.

Computer = 0 may mean you have one at home and can log onto AOL
Computer = 1 Means you know a little programing or means you have written 
             your own web page. Some formal training
Computer = 2 Equiv to a 4 year degree
Computer = 3 Equiv to a Masters degree
Computer = 4 Equiv to a Doctorate
Computer = 5 Subscribes to alt.2600
Computer = 8 Lives in the ethernet.

In Traveller, most highly skilled people will be at a skill level of 4.  Yes
there are a few that exceed this, but the norm, would have it at 4.

Now just what do these number mean to the role-playing game.  You take Dr.
Bob and EMT Carl out into the field for an adventure.  Mr. Pit Viper takes a
shot at their friend Motz.  Motz, of course is somewhat susceptable to the
venom of a pit viper.  Dr. Bob has about a 20% better chance to treat Motz
than does EMT Carl.  Both have good chance, Bob\'s is somewhat better.  Very
real world.

The numbers serve two purposes:  Let us apply the skill to an adventure
setting situation and let us quantativly describe the approximate level of
ability.  If you can do both with one number, it makes the game more
playable.  Having seperate First Aid and Medic, is like asking for seperate
Agility/Speed/Coordination/Dexterity stats.  If you want to emulate real
life, the numbers you would need to manipulate are more complex than a GAME
needs.  

Traveller isn\'t about real life.  Its about sci-fi role playing.  Its about
a game.  It doesn\'t matter if my laser carbine emits 23MegaJoules.  All the
game cares about is how much damage does it do in the end.  Do I hit?  How
much damage did I do?

What gaming advantage is to be had by breaking Medic into:

    First Aid
    Pharmocology
    Nursing
    Family Practice
    Toxicology
    Surgeon
    Cardiology
    Hemotology?

Every one of those specialties build upon previous knowledge.  A
Hemotologist has had the core training as the Family Practicioner.  They
have the same core as a Nurse, etc. etc.

Your computer neural network specialist has the same core abilities as your
4 year degreed business application programmer.  Tools may be different, but
the skill set is the same.  Both know more than the operator, but include
the operators core knowledge etc.

<Reality Check Mode ON>

Yes, but this isn\'t real life...

This is an RPG, which means it is little more than interactive story 
telling.  With all the nuts and bolts skill systems, all the "canon", 
all the the ships, vehicles, and so on designed down to the last nut 
and bolt, this is a game.  It is meant to be fun.  Yes, things have to 
make some sense, and have to build a coherent universe, but I don\'t 
think most people mind something that keeps it simple.

I come from a theater background originally.  The skills & ships 
discussions remind me sometimes of an early 20th century playwright and 
director named David Belasco.  Belasco was famous for bringing the 
ultimate in reality to his plays.  He tried to design slice of life 
sets and plays.  One of them (I can\'t remember which), opens with a 
sunrise, simulated with a few lighting tricks.  The problem is he 
simulated a sunrise in real time (i.e. the audience watched lighting 
behind the set simulate a sunrise for 10-15 minutes.  The audience 
was bored to tears.  Belasco was a flop who never could understand 
why his play failed...

I recognize that this analogy is going to be dismissed as irrelevant 
by a lot of people, but the more you complicate the rules system, the 
harder it will be for new players to get a handle on it, and 1 of the 
stated goals of T4 is to broaden the appeal.  I don\'t see the point 
in a 1st aid skill when there is a Medical skill.  Medical skill at a 
lower level really is nothing but 1st aid training.  At higher 
levels, what is 1st aid skill going to do for you?  Enable you to 
apply a tourniquet properly in 1.2 seconds as opposed to 10 seconds?  
Why complicate things needlessly?

Probably, but then controversial ideas usually do.  :-)

The Me-208 was a fighter prototype used to set the world-air speed record in
1941.
It was used a propaganda device. It was faster because it had no armour or
guns, and the Germans wanted everyone to believe it was so when it set the
record. However, the Luftwaffe did not have the brains or resources to
pursue production. Neither was the HE-100 or its follow ons. The Hungarians
I think flew a couple dozen production HE-100\'s. BTW, My favourite plane was
the Uhle, the 450mph twin engine night fighter.

Please reconsider.  The skill list should be kept as short as possible.
For example if one charator has \'First Aid - 5\' and a second charator 
has \'Medical - 1\' which is the more skilled at healing??  

IMO \'Medical - 0\' means the charator only has basic medical knowledge.
IE they can apply first aid only.

Also, I find breaking down aircraft skill into multi vers single engine
a little to far.  Perhaps you should break Revolver skill into 
\'Single Action Revolver\' vers \'Double Action Revolver\' as well.

  The IG web pages cites a number of previous achievements of
Lester Smith. However they have left out one that (I feel) beats
the rest and is very relevant to traveller:
       BUGHUNTERS.
  Anyone remember the "Amazing Engine" generic system brought
out by TSR? No? Well, they only brought out 5 universe packs
and it has never been seen since. Some good idea, but well...
  Anyway, BUGHUNTERS was one of the universe packs. It is sort
of a "Aliens - The Role Playing Game - Done Right". Ever see
the Aliens role playing game? It sucked. Great if you were into
intricate combat stuff. Completely dry for role-playing.
  BUGHUNTERS is amazing. Sort of SF-Horror. Big, tough PCs fighing
amazingly nasty aliens. Sounds like tripe but everything is
extremely well justified in the DMs section. An intergalactic
plot to rival Cuthulu.

  If you see it anywhere cheap, get it. It is great source
material for ideas. As for use in Traveller, well in the Early
Solomani expansion it was kind of them-against-the-universe.
Also they used a lot of genetic alteration and birth labs which
figure in BUGHUNTERS.
  It would be cool to see Lester Smith\'s talents in this area
brought to bear on a future milieu supplement for the early 
Solomani Years. Glad to see him on board.

  Check it out.

Actually Harn Master, a good game in its own rights does have a seperate 
Agility Dex and Speed skill.  Agility refers to your physical prowess, 
dexterity refers to your motor manipulation skills (eye/hand) and speed, well 
speed is speed.  Speed and agil may not differ by more than 5 points I think.

I\'m not advocating breaking up every skill into a thousand and one cascades, 
although cascades are great because they improve the general abilities of the 
character all over while allowing for that specialization in a single field.  I 
agree a computer programer has to know how to operate the machine.  THe point 
that I was getting at is in order for the task system to more accurately 
refelct things the tasks have to be tied into the attributes that\'s simple but 
it accurately reflects real life, some people are just naturally better at 
things than others are.

Strength helps in controlling recoil, definitely, but there are other 
factors in marksmanship, such as hand-eye coordination and depth 
perception that do not depend on how strong the firer is.  At least, 
that\'s been my players\' gripe.  I\'ve been trying to come up with some 
sort of compromise like a separate Marksmanship attribute derived from 
the character\'s Strength and Agility.

I definitely propose it as an optional character generation system, sort 
of like the simplified "FF&S Lite" Plug-n-Play system for quickly 
designing starships that\'s being hammered out.

The whole argument here is related to the TNE skill system.  Medical and 
First aid were two different thing.  First aid implied trauma aid, being 
able to patch people up and we must admit there are some extremely skilled 
Paramedics there, but lets face it a paramedic would never even consider 
operating on a patient.  That\'s where medical comes in.  To say that all 
Paramedics are the same is a gross simplification and in turn to say that 
in order to become a doctor you had to progress though the Paramedic stage 
is also just plain wrong.  They\'re two completely sepearte careers.  
Granted a doctor understands trauma aid, but lets face it he\'s used to 
dealing with things that are generally very different than what the average 
medic encounters.

Cool...  If the play was at all interesting in the first place shouldn\'t

I agree there has to be some kind of happy medium between skill cascades 
and just getting to far gone.  A new skill has to make sence.  How much 
difference is there between flying a single engine plane and multiple 
engine plane?  Personally I don\'t know but I\'d imagine there\'s just two 
throttles to watch and duplicate RMP etc. gages.  Is there a difference 
between a Paramedic and a Doctor or is a Paramedic just a Doctor who 
couldn\'t make it.  Here I think there is a difference.  To say that a 
paramedic is just a poor excuse for a doctor is wrong, there are 
paramedics out there who are far better than doctors but they\'re dealing 
with something else, something other than what the average doctor 
experiences.  Pulling out an appendix and treating a gunshot wound where 
the kid is in the process of bleeding to death are two totally different 
experiences and I don\'t think the average doctor has ever had to deal 
with that.  Some yes but most no.

TNE tied them to skills, as such that it was: (Skill + Stat) * Difficulty >= D20

CT allowed some pluses to the skill role for high strength and dex on some 
skill checks.  2D6+Skill+DMs >= 3+ Routine, 8+ Average 11+ Difficult, 15+
Formidable

MT added 1/5 of your attributes as a DM to the check, and the values were
somewhat different (acutally the ones above may very well be MT levels ....)

Someone did some stats and the TNE and CT success chances were not too far
off from each other, however, TNE definatly deflated the value of a skill
because stats made up most of the roll.  CT stats may modify the roll, but
it is the 
skill and the difficulty that is important.  So if you have a -3 to your
archery skill because you have never used one before, you have a good chance
of messing up.

Cascades are fine, but makeing them seperate skills is looney.  I like
cascades. In fact a good way to Cascade Medic would be:

Medic (Cascade: Emergancy, Obstetrics, Pharmacology, Internal, Orthapedics)

Your levels can mean different things again.  With a Obstetrics specialty
and a skill level of 2, you might be a mid-wife.  Obstetrics-4 would make
you a doctor who can deliver babys, and your emergancy medicine abilites may
be a 2.

Some people are, but you cant say that Joe with his Int of 12 is going to be
a talented Computer Programmer and because his Int is 12, he is also going
to be a talanted biologist.  Attributes are good for things that are common
to a lot of things like using Int to look for clues (frankly an observation
isnt a skill but a function of intellegence -- another argument for another
day.  I have never seen a "Observation Class" offered at a school).  You can
train skills, natural ability is the attributes.  Let the attributes modify
the skills, but don\'t make the skills modify the attributes.

Example:  Joe Int 12, Computer-4, and Will, Int 8, and Computer-4.  Both
have the same training and experience with Computers, but a problem shows
up, Joe should have an edge over Will, but 4 points worth because that says
that Joe with a computer-0 and an Int 12 is equal to the training and
experience of Wills Computer-4, that isn\'t real.

I have had several friends whos career was:  Life Guard > EMT > Paramedic >
Med School.  This is not an unrealistic progression of events.  Now most
doctors go straight to school to become a doctor and most have to live in
the ER for a while.  The point is that a doctor has been trained (at the
point he was a medic-2 to have the same medical skills as a paramedic)  The
skill system is not saying you progress through these stages.  In fact if
you look at High Guard Navy Doctor generation, you are a Medic-3, no
progression.  You have trained for  four years solid and have a Medic-3 to
show for it.

CT as it stands does a pretty good job at imitating life while keeping it
simple and playable.

    'body' => 'I\'ve been reading this debate back and forth for awhile, and I\'ve got 
some thoughts on it.

First of all, I recognize that in RL (and quite possibly in RPG, too) 
Doctor and Paramedics are *different* things.  If was in a party that was 
in a lot of fights, I\'d want a paramedic around. After all, i want to 
live to visit the doctor.  Not that a doctor can\'t do those same things, 
if he is the right kind of doctor (so your a podiatrist....can you take 
out a bullet?)

In game terms, though, and as a GM, I\'ve constantly got to answer the 
players questions about there skills...where do *I* draw the line?  What 
do I allow this skill to do?  I\'d hate for a player to die, because of 
the way i interpret the rules (sorry, you don\'t have medical/first aid, 
and thought you have the other...you can\'t use it....).  

So here\'s how I use these skills.   I try to determine *how bad off* the 
character is. For the case of light wounds, i don\'t sweat it.  Usually a 
first-aid-0 or a Medical-0 will take care of this...(ie most ppl know a 
little, and if we assume these are mostly military charactes, well, *I\'d* 
make it my business to know...)  If the wound is moderate to bad, i\'ll 
let first aid stabalize the character, but he\'ll need further treatment 
by someone who has \'medical\'.  By my normal interpretation, I\'ll let 
medical treat it, but it\'s not a \'first aid\' type of treatment...it will 
be more difficult and take longer to use the skill(that is a full 
treatment takes longer than, here\'s a bandage, we\'ll get you to a doctor.), 
unless the same player has both skills.

By this I mean that Medical allows you to actually treat the wound, fix 
the problem, etc. If firstaid has been applied, then it is easier to 
apply the medical (heal time may just as long).  First Aid\'s main purpose 
is to stabalize, and let the character survive long enought to see a doctor.

So they aren\'t exact replacements for each other....As a player, or a 
group, I\'d want a couple of people with first-aid, maybe at moderate 
levels -1, or -2, who could fix immediat problems (maybe bringing a 
player back into a fight, or allowing him to escape) and a Medical-3, to 
sew \'em up when they get home (and this could easily be an NPC)

This would give the PC\'s the option to have other skills...besides a big 
medical skill, while still knowing that they saved their own butts (which 
is always a gratifying experience:)

I basically agree with the above.  While there are differences, we need a
certain level of generality for playability.  Maybe require specialization
above a certain skill level.  After all, no matter _how_many_ skills you 
add, your will _never_ please everyone.  Leave something for the ref!

So where would a battlefield medic come in?  Or an independant duty corpsman?
Man, you should see one of _those_ guys in action; I had one stitch up a
(small) cut artery in my leg, and the same guy did some moderately serious
work on a messed up shoulder where a guy had landed on the end of a pipe 
during some heavy rolls at periscope depth.  The doctor on shore (about a
month later) opened it up, said he couldn\'t have done much better, and closed
it up.  These guys do appendectimies (sp?) and pull teeth.  Point is, he\'d
probably be a 1st aid 3, but he\'s approaching the skills of a doctor,
at least in terms which would be practical for most games (patching up
combat damage).  Furthermore, there\'s not much else for this guy to do short
of being a doctor with gaining of more skill levels. 

Personally, I think some of these 3 and 4 layer deep hierarchies of skills
 are one more intimidating complication which may scare away new players.  
Chances are that anyone who want\'s this detail will be modifying it in-house
anyway.  There\'s also the minor point that it\'s easier to expand it later when
we have a sane amount of time available than it is to properly optimize a more
extensive list under the deadlines that IG\'s got.  Let\'s keep the basic T4 
simple, and let additions be published as supplements.

  I agree.  I would also suggest that Medic-0 be a default skill for anyone
with military/Law Enforcement/Scout background.
  Medic-1 would be a good entry for a background skill table.

Amen. ;-)

In fact, in point-based games (like Gurps &c) I tend to go the 
opposite direction. That is, I don\'t allow characters with too *few*

important those skills are to the RPG itself.  I\'m sure that there are those out
there that would admit that Medical-1 probably covers more "learned knowledge"
than Slug Pistol-1 (or *all* of Firearms-1, for that matter).  Since combat
seems to be an essential part of most RPGs, however (they do-- after all-- have
their own dedicated rules section), the skills pertaining to the different
aspects of ranged weapon combat must be broken down to allow players more
choices.

This is quite obvious with the TNE cascading skills of Pilot, Energy Weapon,
Slug Weapon, Medical, Armed Martial Arts, Gunnery, Screens, Ground Vehicle,
Music, and Muscle Transport.  Except for the last two, these skills can all be
interpreted as potential combat skills, representing what most people view as
*exciting* in an RPG.  Their break-down gives these players more choices with
regards with character creation and tactics during play.

Skills such as Electronics-1 and Mechanics-1 cover even more "information" than
Medical-1 due to the fact that the human body doesn\'t come out with new models
every few years or so.  We don\'t ask for cascades for "microchip design",
"fibre-optic repair", or "hydrocarbon engine repair" because these skills aren\'t
as central to RPGs (in general) as are Combat or Starship skills in a game like
Traveller.  How about the Physical Sciences?  Most people would state after
attaining their PhD that these skills could likewise be broken down into
cascading sub-skills.

I once had an argument with a fellow that played a historical boardgame that
depicted the European theater during WWII (ETO).  I was playing Avalon Hill\'s
Advanced 3rd Reich (A3R) at the time and this guy was trying to tell me that A3R
wasn\'t realistic because it took several liberties to keep a campaign game
(1939-1945+) from taking any longer than 24-36 hours to complete.  His new
version of ETO (which he was working on to submit as Advanced ETO or ETO 2nd
Edition) was much more complicated and I was told it took over 100+ hours to
playout the same time frame!

The amount of detail in any role-playing game is directly proportional to how
long it takes to play out certain situations (most commonly, Combat).  I prefer
a game with a simpler combat system, that takes a *few* liberties at the expense
of realism, all for the sake of keeping the combat situation FLUID.  If a two
minute combat takes three hours to role-play, it is no longer realistic from a
certain perspective.  The hard part is drawing the line; there will always be
players on both sides.  Perhaps there is call for a backwards-compatible,
advanced character generation & interaction rules set like the FF&S lite rules
going on at Mr. Golden\'s web page?

  The IG web pages cites a number of previous achievements of
Lester Smith. However they have left out one that (I feel) beats
the rest and is very relevant to traveller:
       BUGHUNTERS.
  Anyone remember the "Amazing Engine" generic system brought
out by TSR? No? Well, they only brought out 5 universe packs
and it has never been seen since. Some good idea, but well...
  Anyway, BUGHUNTERS was one of the universe packs. It is sort
of a "Aliens - The Role Playing Game - Done Right". Ever see
the Aliens role playing game? It sucked. Great if you were into
intricate combat stuff. Completely dry for role-playing.
  BUGHUNTERS is amazing. Sort of SF-Horror. Big, tough PCs fighing
amazingly nasty aliens. Sounds like tripe but everything is
extremely well justified in the DMs section. An intergalactic
plot to rival Cuthulu.

  If you see it anywhere cheap, get it. It is great source
material for ideas. As for use in Traveller, well in the Early
Solomani expansion it was kind of them-against-the-universe.
Also they used a lot of genetic alteration and birth labs which
figure in BUGHUNTERS.
  It would be cool to see Lester Smith\'s talents in this area
brought to bear on a future milieu supplement for the early 
Solomani Years. Glad to see him on board.

  Check it out.

Right. For the longest time one of my pals played the same character 
in most games, irrespective of genre. (Well, in Fantasy games he 
usually had magic...) We had a lot of fun, but there wasn\'t much

Absolutely, just trying to be over-obvious. ;-) <Looks around to see

High Roleplayers among my friends. At least when they bog down the

Hmm. Think I need to upgrade my Oratory skill,  \'cause, you know, 
you put it a lot better. ;-) That is, the above is pretty much the 
way I run things. Guess I got overwrought at the thought of 
such useful tools as social skills being wrested from my hands. ;-)

(Btw. I\'m past hurdle one, job-wise. Now for the final interview day 
after tomorrow. Big corps seem to take their interviewing a lot more

As a long time GM myself, I have to agree on this.  If the skill isn\'t 
there, think of a name, how it works, and --poof--!! It\'s there.

Perhaps its just the descriptions of skill levels that are really getting under 
my skin.  I like the cascade as I\'ve said before.  Those descriptions of skill 
levels bother me for some reason, don\'t know why, they just do.

To true.  Never did like that either, but lets face it what are the odds of 
having an Int of 12?  Slim and none and Slim just left town.  I think that using 
the governing attribute to modify the skill shows inate ability.  That certian 
something that some people just have.  Lets face it we all know someone who\'s been 
told the correct way of doing something a thousand times and still can\'t do it 
right and we all know someone who gets told once and knows for the rest of their 
life.

Truly we all hate to have players die because they don\'t have the right 
skills for a job.  That\'s where the cascade comes in.  A person with medical 
gets first aid and vice-versa.

This is what I feel, first aid is used to stabilize a patient, medical us 
used to fix the patient.  Because they are both cascades of medical a doctor 
can stabilize a patient and an EMT can in a pinch preform minor surgery.

Basically, I agree with Derek that the real world is becoming more and more
complex and a single person will understand only a shrinking part of it.
People have to become experts in there niches.

However, Traveller is a game and so it should (at leat IMHO) be no mirror of
society but abstact from the real world focussing only imporant issues.

Probably the main reason for the success of fantasy roleplaying games set in
pseudo Middle Ages against science fiction system is their simplicity.

>>Adventurers must be _generalists_, because they will have to adapt to
>>different situations, equipment, and so on!

And otherwise players would be only field idiots (Huh, that\'s probably not
translateable. I mean, they\'re good at only one small subject and no nothing
about all other subjects) The more skill exists, the less the single
character actually knows.

I second that.

But the game shouldn\'t. 

And it also depends on education. My university tried to offer the broadest
approach to computer science that\'s possible. We had no classes of how to
program in a special language (for example C) but generally about programing
languages of all kinds. And I tried to stay as long as possible a generalist
on all subjects of computer science.

Perhaps with better education methods, it would become possible to make
students more to learn in less time in the far future. Perhaps the common
scientist or engineer will be older than today because its possible due a
longer life span.

He would have to accumulate a lot of reference-knowlegde, I would call it.
He didn\'t actually know the details but only the general repair procedures
and know how to look up the details.

At my company, we\'ve a photocopy-machine which has a little interactive
expert-system to locate and fix simple malfunctions. Very nice and quite
simple to use even for people like :-)

These all might be explanations why in the T4 universe life isn\'t as complex
as one might expect.

They need no (academic) degree at all. It\'s helpful to have a "Master" in
some liberal arts (for example Germanist or History) but otherwise it\'s an
occupation you could learn for three years like a joiner or electrician.

I took this example from a Renegate Legion supplement. Is anybody familiar
with FASA\'s future technology here? For me, the descibed combat tactics are
quite believable and I would like to hear some other voices commenting this.

In a nutshell, to conquer a planet, the main battle ships (called Leviathans
here) will do the battle for system majority, using spinal mass
accelerators, rockets and lasers, supported by different kinds of fighters
(called Interceptors). Ideally, one side will gain orbital majority. To
attack the world, transports will drop grav tanks and grav transports
carrying infantry. Because such a drop seldom will be unnoticed by the
defender and because the battle ships can\'t maneuver in such close orbit,
the first landing will be a contest between drop tanks and intercepting
fighters. At the ground, air support will be done by either missle carrying
fighers or thor-sattelites, using orbit-to-ground missiles. Ground combat is
done mostly by grav tanks, supported by troops to conquer and secure cities.
Troops will wear only light battle dress (power armor is unknown in that
universe, I think). Their heavy laser weapons can be connected to the fusion
plant of the grav carrier. While ground combat lasts (which is simulated by
the game Centurion, to mention also the third board game :-) the main fleet
will blockade the world to prevent reinforcements.

I second this. (Or a little bit weaker: Stay with one unit, don\'t switch
back and forth as FF&S did.) Perhaps one should use dt for "displacement
tons" to not confuse this with metric tons.  Also with naval vessels on
earth, you will confuse their "gross register tons" with metic tons, will you?

Yes. I would also ignore displacements on large ships (say about 1000 tons)
of only a few tons (for example computer sizes (which should be included in
the bridge displacement, IHMO!)).

>(3)(4)(5) and (6) all go together and are more controversial:

I still agree.

I think, the old system did this. I remember something like 1 weapon turret

Thanks.

There\'s one topic, I would like some more detail. I would like to see
improved jump drives, converters and/or maneuver drives with higher TL. I
also would like to see crew size depending on civilian or military ship type
and on TL. Finally I would like to see a list of ready to include components
like

        small cabine (middle passage 1 person civilian, 2 military, 
                      for up to 2 weeks use about a liner or carrier) 2t
        medium cabine (middle passage 1 c, 2 m, unlimited) 4t
        large cabine (high passage 1 person) 8t
        small sick bay (up to 4 patients) 10t
        small machine shop () 10t
        recreation area (needed for passenger ships) 1t per passenger
        ...

        weapon turrets and bays should already contain crew stations
        bridge should also include computer

See thats where the cascade comes in.  With Trauma Aid/First Aid whatever, you\'d 
get Medical/Medic at half that ablitiy.  I will not deny that EMT\'s Paramedics 
etc. are very skilled individuals and in situations where there can be no 
immediate evacuation to a safe place they have to be even more competent.  In 
the case of a starship/submarine etc. medic I\'m sure they\'d have to have the 
skills of a doctor, lets face it you\'re a long way from home and the last thing 
you want to do is lay around for six days with an unsplinted arm or open wound.

I don\'t think they are all that frightening.  Cascaded serve to broaden a 
characters knowledge at a lower point cost while still allowing for 
specialization.  If the character wants to be a podiatrist in the 54th century, 
power to the people man.  There is however a point where cascading skills 
becomes nitpicking and it just goes way to far.  That\'s the way things seem to 
be going.  

i.e.  Pilot, jet, multiple jet, prop & multiple prop.  The basic mechanics 
involved in flying a fixed wing air craft are the same reguardless of the plane. 
 THe engines push or pull you forward, the increased airspeed over the wings 
foil shape creates low pressure on the upper surface creating drag.  Honestly if 
you could fly a cessna could you fly a lear jet?  Probably, might take you an 
extra twenty minutes to figure out what all the extra dials are for but the 
basic controls are the same and inspite of the fact the plane responds a little 
differently you should be able to fly it.  Same thing goes for larger aircraft 
still, it may feel like you\'re flying a mac truck but the principle and the 
controls are very similar, more sophicticated but similar.

I\'m sure my better half would say so :-)

But I doubt you need to break down the difference between medicine docs
and surgeons too much.  Actually, you might put "specialist" after
surgeon, since they usually do fellowships after residency.  Even
surgical specialties.

The rules should add that if you are one of the higher levels that you
think the others (above and below) are weenies :-)

Doesn\'t it say that the Imperium left the planet interdicted as an
experiment.  I assume that the scouts found the planet, and then
decided that it would make a nifty anthropology experiment to see how
the civilization developed without the aid of metal and fossil fuels. 
I always thought this was pretty callous, to condemn people to a live
of primitive technology just as an experiment, and the expanding Dawn
League contacted these people and set about fixing yet another error of
the Imperial era.

I thought that the original settlers didn\'t mine their own materials,
maybe they used the asteroid belt, (Does it have an asteroid belt ?) or
maybe they just used lots of synthetic materials.  During the Long
Night their society collapsed, and the technology plummeted.  For the
last 2-3 thousand years, they haven\'t been able to mine significant
amounts of metal.  Maybe enough to make the odd sword, but nothing to
allow an industrial revolution. 

I do think that Spires would have developed many different attitudes,
than the rest of the Imperium.  For instance on Psionics, they didn\'t
undergo the Psionic Suppressions, so psionics are more common there.

(Hard to believe you have a theater background.  Most such people would
try to explain why we should be enjoying paying big bucks to watch a 
20 minute sunrise!)

I think your analogy also applies to the debates on star ship design.
Just why do I care that my tech 10 radio gear takes .000032 Mega watts?
All I want to know and all my players want to know is "Does this ship 
have a working radio?"

Certainly some gear heads just won\'t be happy without page after page
of boring charts showing the power requirements for endless technical 
dribble.  But when they try to explain how page after page of boring 
technical dribble in chart form is realy a new \'simplified\' system 
it makes me want to just shake my head a reach for book 2.

I have found that when I manually calculate the surface area of the antenna

AD is the antenna diameter in meters
AA is the surface area in square meters
Calc is the surface area calculated from the AD value.

If the surface area from FFS is a two dimensional measurement then how do
you have less surface area than the formula will allow. If the measurement
is meant to an actual surface area of Three dimensional object(antenna) then
it is really off. Ie how do you have volume measurement less than the
surface measurement?

Then you can make for even greater error at various tech levels you can get
even a smaller area than on the table. ie at TL 15 you modify the surface
area by .025.

You\'re thinking of Flugkaptain Hanna Reitsch, one of the 
leading, perhaps best, German test pilots during the war. 
However, Reitsch was _not_ one of the prime test pilots 
in the Komet flight test programme. Test pilot for the 
first flight (March 41) of the Me 163 was Heini Dittmar, 
who also made the first powered flight later the same year 
and then spent two years in hospital after breaking his 
back in a crash later in the programme. Dittmar was joined 
by Rudolf Opitz, who made the first flight in the production 
Me 163B-0. By early 1943 test flying had shifted to the 
regular Luftwaffe unit Erprobungskommando 16. Reitsch did 
fly it, crashing and severely injuring herself when trying 
to land after the wheeled dolly failed to release on take 
off (Opitz was the only pilot ever to succeed at that).

While I\'ve got my references out, I can give precise answers 
to a few of the points made in this thread over the last few 
days. C-Stoff was a hydrazine hydrate in methyl alcohol solution 
and T-Stoff was hydrogen peroxide. The T-Stoff tanks were behind 
the cockpit and on either side of it, the C-Stoff tanks were 
in the wings.
 
As for not knowing what they were getting into, early pilots 
were above average and went through a training programme 
involving training gliders, towed flights, glides in a water-
ballasted -A, powered flights in a -A, and only then flights 
in the combat capable Me 163-B. By the time they were ready 
they would know precisely what they were facing.

Take-off and landing accidents accounted for 80% of Komet 
losses, 15% were in-air accidents, primarily near-Mach 
compressibility which wasn\'t understood until post war, 
and 5% to enemy action. An improved version with proper 
landing gear and an improved motor was designed but not 
completed.

Can we get back to Traveller now?

Derek Stanley and Rob Miracle are discussing skill levels. One possible

This allows things like the Imperial Academy of Science and Medicine

Actually xenobiology was considered to relate to totally alien species.  ie, the 
Cymbiline chips.  Aslan are carbon based lifeforms with a life cycle very much 
like our own.

Exactly.  Just because you\'re training to be a in charge of your ships black 
globe doesn\'t mean that you get to slack off on learning about sand casters etc. 
What if the guy beside you can\'t do his job, you\'ve got to do it.  This is 
exactly what I\'ve been arguing for is the cascade system.  But not to the point 
where it becomes ludicrous.

Yes it does the world was intedicted as a scientific laboritory to study social 
development.  The exact phrase reads "During the Third Imperium this was a 
primitive world placed under Imperial Interdict as and anthropological laboratory 
for observation of and controlled experiments on social development.

Given the decay rate of synthetic materials, lets face it they\'ll be digging us up 
for milenia to come, I can\'t accept this either.  Surely if the supposed colony 
possessed equipment they must have known that the raw materials necessary to keep 
their culture running existed quite literally beneath their feet.

On this I agree totally.  In fact given Spires developent of philosophy and the 
arts I\'d say psionic tallents and psionic training are not uncommon.  Granted 
they\'d be shamistic types thats for sure or something like that.

I still can\'t beleive that the Imperium, which brought all these other worlds back 
from the dark ages would single out a planet and decide these people shall remain 
in the stone age just so we can study them.  Think of the outrage, amongst the 
Solomani population if these were Solomani colonists.  Where as if these peoples 
culture developed insitu they would merely be creating an historical preserve for 
scientists around the galaxy to experement in.  If they\'re settlers they\'re 
someones relatives or belong to some culture, if they\'re genuinely legitamit 
inhabitants then whats the harm, the first and second imperiums probably observed 
them too.

Hmm could you not also have a decrease in the needed diameter too at higher
tech levels. From personal experience the optical range finders(Fire
Directors) used by the US Navy before radar, the lenses apertures were over
twenty feet apart. But refinements of optics at later TL\'s decreased the
apertures distances to less than half of twenty feet. The higher TL also
provided greater resolution and speed of calculation.

Actually, most of the folks I worked with at BNR could trouble-shoot down to
the board level.  That\'s 2000+ people at a single lab!  Even our secretaries
were multi-talented.  (Kelly taught herself the CAD system and helped us out

Actually, the current job market is becoming more generalized.  Employers are
searching for people who are adaptable, able to handle a variety of tasks,
and able to train themselves.  (Sounds like adventurers, right?)  In this
environment you can\'t afford to be too specialized.  (End of career lecture.)

Seriously, and leftover lectures aside, the world belongs to those who do not
limit themselves.  One of my friends in university was an artist, professor,
tv & computer technician, printer, machinist, fencer, chef, and architectural
draftsman.  (That\'s just what he was good at - he tried everything.)  Steve
Williams (you know, head animator at ILM) was advising my kids to broaden
themselves out.  He himself draws, animates, fiddles with computer code,
shoots, rebuilds engines, cooks well, gives haircuts to his colleagues... --
and his colleagues attribute his success to the way he always tackles new
fields.

Given the right tools and manuals, my colleague Dave can fix nearly anything
that moves.  He has a good understanding of the principles of small engines,
and a methodical way of working.  (Seems like magic to me, but he says the
same about my computer troubleshooting.)

I disagree with you, but assuming what you say is true, how do you handle the
gaming aspect?  Must my character always keep the same equipment?  Can Han

I really have to disagree with this (is disagreeing with the listmaster a 
dangerous thing?).  You are comparing apples and oranges here.  Operating a 
wheeled vehicle, whether pickup truck, sedan, sport-utility or family van, all 
require basically the same skills and the same sorts of reactions.  You could 
make an argument that offroad driving is different, but overall the wheeled 
vehicles are very similar.  

I always look at First Aid as being trauma care; attemtpting to save the 
patient\'s life by stabilizing the patient until better care can be found, or 
until the EMT can get the info needed to give better care himself.  Medic, on 
the other hand, takes the longer-term view of curing the patient.  This means 
EMT/first aid is a far different  task (with different skills and instincts) 
than providing long-term doctor-style health care.  That is not to say that 
there is no overlap between the two, but the two jobs demand different skills 
and strengths.   In the case of a doctor, he can probably do most everything an 
EMT can do and just as well, but the doctor will be working under the handicap 
of a much different work situation.  The doctor will be working to CURE the 
patient, which is a much larger, longer and more comlex task than simply 
stabilizing the patient.  An EMT might not be able to perform many of the 
delicate and highly-skilled functions of a full surgeon, but he is trained in 
rapid triage-type decision processes, and trained to STABILIZE (not cure) the 
patient.

What I could see is that a person with Medic-4 (a full Doctor) could use First 
Aid at one skill level less than his Medic skill.  On the other hand, an EMT 
could use his First Aid as Medic, but with a two-level penalty (minimum zero).  
That is to say, Medic-4 could act as First Aid-3, but First Aid-4 would act as 
Medic-2.

This would render a breakdown like this:
Level    Medic          First Aid
0      Med Student      Red Cross Volunteer

Clinical: standard GP stuff.  Lower levels are nurses, higher generalist

As usual with cascade skills, a character would have half level in other

Uh, what?  Oh.  Wow.  I\'m not sure that I\'d want to go too far into 
something like that without some input from the Valiant Heroes (Poor 
Souls) actually hammering this stuff out for the new Traveller.  Although 
there has been quite a bit of input on this list about the direction that 
the starship design rules ought to go, starting with Don Perrin\'s request 
for comments and culminating in David Golden\'s being happily tasked with 
refining FF&S Lite by the IG Press Gang, there has been no equivalent 
discourse on the other aspects of the new release, such as Greg Porter\'s 
bit on vehicles and equipment, or the basic character generation and 
combat rules.  I haven\'t seen the GDW-beta list, and have no idea whether 
or not subscribing to it would shed any more light on what those folks 
are up to.

Since I don\'t know the basic assumptions of the new rules set, I really 
don\'t want to muck about with it beforehand.  For instance:  Are 
controlling attributes the most significant part of a relevant skill 
\'asset,\' as in TNE, or is the skill level itself the biggest factor in 
determining potential success or failure?  How do attribute levels (such 
as social standing) affect career options, and how do career paths affect 
attribute levels?  I\'ve really got no idea.

Sure, I suppose I could bang something out based on the TNE system, once 
finals week is over, as some sort of prototype.  I\'m going to be a 
rent-a-cop this summer ("Here\'s a gun -- you don\'t get one!"), so I\'ll 
likely have plenty of time on my hands, and this project will go a long 
way towards making sure I remain awake for my entire shift.

You must work in an office of super genius\'s.  I work in a fairly technical place and 
other than the technical support staff I\'m the only person who knows how to fix things. 
 If something goes wrong with the computers I get first crack at it and if that doesn\'t 
fix it they call in our techs and wait an hour for them to arrive.

You must work in a wonderous place.  Every job add I\'ve ever seen, and beleive me I\'m 
looking a lot now because my office is on strike.  You have to have four years 
experience, understand the basic nature of atomic physics, write nobel prize winning 
literature and be able to operate a scanning electron microscope.

I know the kind of people.  I\'ve got a BA in archaeology, I know how to fix cars, I 
operate a 3d animator for kicks, write short stories and game articles as well as 
understanding the nature of most special effects, camera operation and script writing

Again Dave appears to be the exception rather than the rule.  I work, used to actually, 
closely with a number of professional mechanics, several refuse to touch diesel engines, 
and only one really understands how to properly tune a propane engine.

Solo is a single vehical specialist, he\'s spent years learning the insides of the 
Falcon.  He knows it like the back of his hand.  Any engineering officer serving aboard 
a single navel vessel would have the same degree of knowledge about his vessel.  
However, I was refering to the average Navel tech at a refit yard.  I didn\'t clarify the 
point did I?

Lets face it most of us who surf the net with any regularity can to a certian degree 
refer to ourselves as "Renesance Men" (no offence intended to the women out there but 
that is the original term) meaning that there is little that we don\'t know at least 
something about.  

I\'ll admit I\'m totally ignorant of computer programing, don\'t even want to know about it 
really, I just want the application to do its job right and I\'ll take it from there.  
But I can rip apart and repair anything in my computer, but the code itself may as well 
be written in ancient egyptian.  Sure everyone on a starship would be expected to 
understand how things work to a limited extent but how many of they would really 
understand how a jump space field is formed or what it is exactly that makes a ship 
precipitate out of J-Space at 100? diameters.  Its gravity, but what is it about gravity 
that makes it happen.

b***s***! You can\'t get any library job above shelver in Virgina without a
Masters of Library Science accredited by the American Library Association.
It is the same for MD. Penn., Del., NC, SC, and WVA. and 48 of the 50
states. You can get a full time job as a "part-time\'\' circulation, research,
or shelving clerk. I\'ve worked in Richmond, Virginia Beach, and two college
libraries in Virgina without an MLS, and I know that management and
supervisory positions are filled with MLS holders. MLS people are in such
surpluss their filling the lower rung positions as well.

Library science involves a lot more than looking like a spinster and saying
shush! With modern record keeping and archival storage, combined with
digital storage and on-line research data  services, it getting harder and
more professional each year, I\'m sure by the 30th century it\'ll be as
specialized as agriculture or medic [as mentioned on a previous posst ;)].
Information sciences and library science until recently were two different
fields but are now blending together. Someone in a information science
program will be required to learn library science skills and vice versa. MIS
will still be business oriented and libraries public or research oriented,
but as we know with the net, everything is starting to blur when it comes to
data and communications!

My apologies, but this is my field of employment, and it stings a little to
say that you can just learn it like a journeyman electrician. Maybe in the
Imperium, but not in the real world.

I think you are generalizing too much about "doctor-style"
care.  Doctors may
go about learning the same "trauma" skills via a different
approach:  anatomy,
biology, chemistry, first, then on to the visceral skills
of surgery, controlled
substances, etc.

HOWEVER, this does not mean that they apply different
techniques than a
"trauma care" practitioner a la EMT, just that they have a
better understanding
of the whole procedure and its ramifications.  The same
reason the Terminators
were programmed with biological data about humans, to make
them more 
efficient...

Any doctor on the scene of an accident would be doing
exactly the same things
as an EMT, and with better understanding of the
consequences...  Apply pressure,
lie down, that is CSF leaking from his ears we need
lifeflight NOW!  Oh, and they
have the authority to call the lifeflight choppers, too. 
Bonus.

I think any MD who hasn\'t been out of med school for 30
years would probably
remember most of the vital trauma skills learned therein,
however, I don\'t think
they teach long-term wound care, chemotherapy, or
pre/post-natal care to EMTs...

This WILL make for a lot of Med-1s out there, but that is
infinitely preferable to
a proliferation of nonsensical skills...  If necessary, I
would separate Surgery
and Medicine, but no further...  without adding another
level of complexity with
subskills...  counter to the Traveller ethos.

True, but what about the difference between a 9 and a 5?  A 9 is good, but
hardly impossible (1/6th of the time in fact ), a 5 is only 1 point below
average. 

Under TNE this difference becomes *vast*.  Skills are basically worthless
in TNE.  Good stats = competent character average or poor stats = poor
character.  That\'s why I much prefer MT.  In MT the same difference
between a 5 and a 9 (in MT a 6 and a 10) is 1 point.  An MT character will
have on average half as many skills as a TNE character, so Skill/2 and
Stat Bonus/4 = stats are twice as powerful in TNE, which IMHO is a *very*
bad thing.  

In MT good stats can turn someone who is a good with a skill into someone
who is very good with it.  In TNE good stats can turn someone who is poor
(ie skill level 1 ) in a skill into someone who is better than a trained
professional (skill level 4).

thought that that was what differentiated the doctors from the nurses,
orderlies, candy-stripers, paramedics, and technicians (now that more women
are becoming doctors, we can expect to see salary levels decline, so there
will no longer be an order of magnitude in income difference to help us tell
the classes apart at the hospital).  

The doctors have a license to diagnose what\'s wrong with the patient --
whether it\'s severe lead poisoning, some rare disease, or a bullet wound --
and select treatment based on that diagnosis.  Administering the treatment
can be done at a lower skill level.  Paramedics or EMTs have some authority
to diagnose and treat, but only within their field of expertise, and are
licensed to do so.  

2)  What about psychiatry?  Psychiatrists need M.D. degrees (in the
contemporary U.S.A., at least).  They probably spend a turn in ER in medical
school.  Then all of their post-med school rotations are probably
psych-related, so they don\'t see more surgery and emergency.  How do we fit
them into the game?

As for straight role-playing, a psychiatrist could have unusual insights:

Captain Blood:  Well, we\'re outnumbered and outgunned, they\'ve cut off our
only available avenue of escape, and they\'re about ten minutes behind us.
Suggestions, staff?

Bob Weasel:  Why don\'t we offer to split the loot we\'ve stolen, and tell
them where we\'ve cached what we couldn\'t carry (lying about the location, of
course)?

Mad Mike:  You guys should continue running in the same direction, but I\'ll
stay here, camouflaged.  When they\'ve passed me, I\'ll sneak up behind and
take one prisoner -- preferably one of their leaders.  Then we can parley
our way out.

Dr. Reich:  Remember that we\'re dealing with some badly-adjusted, borderline
personalities.  Their inner parent figures -- called superegos in ancient
times -- are in control, not their inner adults.  So they won\'t respond
rationally to Bob\'s and Mike\'s suggestions.  I suggest that instead we act
like good children:  show some contrition, like making an offer to surrender
and to give everything back.  Tell them how bad we feel and how we know we
need to be punished.  Then when they get close and their guard is down, we
blast \'em with everything we have and run like hell!

        Up until here, I agree with you.  I\'d argue that eventually, the
attackers will either attain total orbital superiority, or withdraw.  If
they want to capture the planet relatively intact, and don\'t want to wipe
out the population or urban centers, etc, then they proceed to the next
step.  Otherwise, they just break out the planet busters and trash the place.

        Here\'s where I really start disagreeing with you: the next step
would consist of the orbiting force suppressing the planetary-based defenses
(assuming they are not foreced to retreat).  The big, obvious targets such
as defense installations and other strategic targets would simply have rocks
dropped on them (why waste a good nuke when a nice handy nickel-iron
asteroid will do just as well).  The smaller or mobile targets would be
dealt with by energy weapons and "smart telephone poles" and "smart
crowbars"; guided kinetic-kill munitions.  
        Once all targets detectable from space are destroyed, *then* you
start dropping in a *few* grav tanks & transports, with lots of decoys mixed
in, and backed by lots of jamming.  The idea is to make feint attacks, and
try and eliminate as much of the remaining defence as possible before
sending in the main body of troops.  Once all the remaining defences that
can be drawn out have drawn themselves out, *then* the troops are put on the
ground, with the orbiting force continuing to provide fire support (directed
by forward observers or not; it\'s up to you :>).

        The idea here is simply that a) being at the top of the gravity well
provides an immense advantage (free kinetic energy!) and b) wasting infantry
is criminally stupid.

(Fears of diverging this into a Star Wars thread aside), Han Solo did
manage to pilot that captured Imperial Transport with no problem, and
Lando Calrisian (sp?) did destroy the death star with the Falcon.
Granted, he did own it previously, but Lando has got to be the prime
example of generalization (pirate, trader, business man, pilot, etc.).

     I go away on honeymoon for a fortnight and when I return there are

     David, at some point 20 or 30 digests ago (it seems - my head is still 
     spinning after reading them all, and I\'ve still got Ars Magica, 
     Runquest and X-boat to get through yet) you asked for specific help 
     (although I don\'t remember the details.  Do you still need any help?

Being a great fan of heinlein, I have always incorporated drop troops in
my games.
However, using Traveller/striker rules, about the only way to make a good
analogous game using drop troops is if you have contest between two widely
dispersed, poor in resources enemies; otherwise, the commando tactics as
covered in the novel do not make a whole lot of sense.

She flew herself (and someone else relatively important, whose name escapes
me at the moment) to visit Hitler in the Reich Chancellery bunker and
reassure him of their personal loyalty to him and the party.  Although unable
to leave the way they got in, Reisch and her companion subsequently escaped
from Berlin and the Soviets.

Interesting book of the week (no matter if you belive his thesis or not):
_The Murder of Adolf Hitler_ (Hugh Thomas?).  I never new Hitler had
Parkinson\'s disease (Parkinson\'s was un-treatable in the 1940\'s, and gave
him only a few more years to live by 1945 in any event).

You make a good point, but consider this.  For someone to have Medic-1, the
ability to provide long term care, they have had to learn emergancy medicine
(which is currently required of almost all medical school programs I think).

That means that a Doctor or Nurse, who can provide long term curing has to
have strong first aid skills.  Not that there isn\'t a emergancy medicine
specialst who is better than a doctor.  Doctors are at least as good at
emergancy medicine as an EMT.

>From a game perspective, we don\'t need both.  How does the skill used in the
game?  From a players perspective, it is only a first aid skill at varying
levels.  An "adventuring Doc"\'s medic skill is only going to be used in
emergancy situations.  The long-term care you described will be reserved
primarily for NPC\'s and generally wont involve a skill check because it
takes place over down-time.  The check that matters is the one made by the
medic in the field.  We only need one skill.  Call it what you like:  First
Aid, or Medic, but we only need one for adventuring reasons.

My preference is to stay with Medic because of all the previously printed
materials.  Use the characters history to define exactly what the Medic-7\'s
abiltiies are.  Just remember that a "typical" docter will have a "medic-3",
a typical "specialist" will have a "medic-4" for comparisons.  That does not
mean that Mr. Medic-7 has a Dr\'s License.....  But he can be pretty gosh darn
good at fixin\' up a blowed-up solider.

So?  This is not an error.  Study the picture and read the captions on FF&S,
pp.50, which are intended to explain this to the reader.

There\'s no requirement that antenna arrays have to be circular dishes,
you know.  Many modern sensors aren\'t, and in the Far Future, I\'d expect
more use to be made of conformal arrays (which don\'t even have to be vaguely
circular).

"Antenna Diameter" is the measurement of the baseline of the antenna array,
and the primary determinant of it\'s resolution (and therefore range).
"Antenna Area" is the measurement of the area of the antenna array available
for intercepting energy.  You need to have enough area to intercept enough
energy to be able to pull the signal out of the noise.  More than that
is gravy.

I agree with you entirely (and I like your picture of J-drives). However,
I think you can get around the planet-killer problem through some simpler
technological mumbo-jumbo without resorting to stutterwarp or hyperspace.

Here\'s my idea (sorry for those that saw this before on X-boat):

M-drives consist of reactionless thruster plates and a mass-nullifying
"zeta field". With the field on, your "apparent mass" is changed so that
you go much faster, although your total *kinetic energy* never reaches
planet-killing amounts. With the field off, your ship would still be
moving in the same direction, only much slower (you might be able to run
on "thrusters only" in spacedock).

I don\'t really care how the thruster plates themselves work--they could
even be a reaction drive for all I care--but the planet killer problem
needs to be resolved. (BTW, it looks like thruster plates are going to
be based on some sort of gravitic technology that only works in-system,
according to the FFSlite web page).

Without a change such as this, thruster plates tend not only to create
planet-killers, but also to yield more kinetic energy than the total
amount of energy put into them. Note that HEPlaR rockets could be used
to satisfy the "free energy" problem but still are planet-killers in
their own right (even small free traders can torch cities from orbit--
small-time operators would not be permitted to use HEPlaR freely).

You might be tempted to simply say that the "zeta field" transfers
inertia, although you must be careful because inertia is proportional
to velocity while kinetic energy is proportional to its square. The
effects of relativity on "apparent mass" should also be considered. I
don\'t consider these complications insurmountable, although I\'ve never
needed a complete scientific explanation to the field\'s workings. If
you rationalize the science behind it, you could use this to place
additional constraints on the drive as well (energy requirements, top
speed, etc.).

   I just _have_ to respond to this.

   I\'m pretty much in agreement with a lot of what\'s said, but I *love*
the tech rules, for one simple reason. THEY GIVE YOU A CONSISTENT SET OF
GUIDELINES FOR DESIGNING EQUIPMENT.

   This is a science fiction game, and it\'s impossible for GDW (or IG) or
anyone else to design and list *all* the possible equipment that would be
available in a universe with 15 different levels of tech and a
mindboggling set of possible societies. This way, any given GM could
design a piece of equipment and any other GM could pick it up and use it,
fitting it into their campaign seamlessly. (Look at the Dean files, for
example) One thing that used to bug me big time was some of the kludgy
equipment that would get designed by amateur engineer refs in the early
days of CT. The FF&S rules (which btw are OPTIONAL) fix all that.

   You\'re right, players don\'t need to know that a particular piece of
equipment consumes 0.00034MW and takes up .001 m^3 of space. But if the
question get\'s asked, you can give \'em the answer.

   I could also think of a number of situations where this knowledge could
come in useful. For example, the PCs are stranded in orbit after a space
battle, they\'ve been left for dead and the fleet is leaving orbit. The
planet is uninhabited, and the players have no functioning PRKs. The
players have to get the radio working FAST. This means routing power, and
enough of it to run the radio with a wrecked power plant. You work it from
here...

Actually, since a podiatrist would have the same core training as a 
trauma doctor, probably...unless its lodged some place interesting 
like say, the base of the brain or something, in which case the EMT & 
the podiatrist are going to be looking for the services of a 
neurosurgeon...

An EMT isn\'t going to do it in most cases.  He\'s going to stabilize 
the patient, and let a doctor in OR do it, most likely.

OK, you make a somewhat convincing argument overall for a First Aid, 
but let\'s face it, even by your own definition, it would be worthless 
after about skill level 2.  Why can\'t a low level medical skill (1 or 
2), which does not qualify 1 to be a doctor be defined to do the same 
thing.
