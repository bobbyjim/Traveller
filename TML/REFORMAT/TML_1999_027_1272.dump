Frankly, it\'s a virtual *certainty* that most worlds will have local
clocks and local calendars *in addition to* the Imperial ones. The
exceptions will be worlds where the local day is unreasonably long. And
even then, they\'ll *track* it unless they are so far from their star
that it makes no *difference* whether it is day or night when you are
on the surface.

One *obvious* ommission is a *knife*. A machete can substitute for a
hatchet, but you can\'t use it to cut up food or trim things. BTW, old
survival school tip (picked up from an old National Geographic article
about the USAF survival school "near" Fairchild AFB in Washington
state). Do *not* use your thumb to test the sharpness of the knife.
Doing so guarantees a lacerated thumb. Those babbies are razor sharp
when issued!

A small sharpening stone would be a good idea too. And a medium sized
tarp, "dull" color on one side, "bright" color on the other. This is
because even *with a "shelter suit" you may want to keep yourself and
your gear dry. And the colors are because you may not want to attract
attention from the natives.

Sideral years are of no real interest except to astronomers. On
planet\'s with axial tilts sufficient to have them cause seasons, the
tropical years will be the important period (that\'s the time between
vernal equinoxes, or summer solstices, or...). 

On planets with low axial tilts but very eccentric orbits, the solar
year may be more important (time between periastrons).

It depends on the fault lines. California is one of the more prominent
cases of a crustal plate sliding along the edge of another. 

Most others are either seperating (Africa\'s Great Rift valley will be
an arm of the sea eventually, much like the Red sea). Or they are
impacting (such as the Indian plate slamminmg into the Eurasian plate
and raising the Himalayas). 

> Like the chain Hawaii.

Hawaii is a geological oddity. There\'s a hot spot *deep* in the mantle
there, which causes a rising plume of hot rock. This melts thru the
thin oceanic crust, and the Hawaii Islands are the result. The plume
hasn\'t moved in millions of years, but the crust the island sit on
*has*. Thus the chain of islands.

Possibly. After all, India is still trying to ram Asia.

Check geology books. There\'s a book I read a long time ago that I know
had maps of the *past* continental layouts. It may have had future ones
as well, but I don\'t recall. After all, it was more than 30 years ago.

Well, the sun will continue getting hotter. We may or may not cause an
increase in the greenhouse effect. Odds are strongly in favor of few
glaciers and a very small icecap around the south pole. The Arctic
ocean may only have seasonal ice. And the rising sea levels will
require either massive dikes or change the coastlines *significantly*. 

Just as an example, in downtown Portland, there used to be a USGS
benchmark across the street from Pioneer Courthouse Square indicating
100 feet above sea level. It was removed when they put in the light
rail system. 

But try checking USGS and USCGS maps (or the equivalent) for areas you
and people you know live. Check out where 50 feet above sea level is.
Where 100 is. Where 200 is. Then consider that 50 feet of ise in sea
level is just about certain, 100 is likely, and 200 is far from out of
the question. 

Anybody want to visit the Cascadia Islands?

That\'s just Charles II returning from exile.

The "Glorious Revolution" usually refers to when we forced James II to
abdicate
and replaced him with an Orange (William and Mary) from Holland.

We did get invaded by the Scots afterwards but they never got south of Derby,
so it doesn\'t count.

Sorry, no dates available because "1066 and all that" is noted for not being
in to dates.

Interesting point, and I suppose the same holds true along other fault lines
(at least the sideways sliding types), and other geological activity would
have changed the terrain as well. Like the chain Hawaii. Aren\'t the
Himmalayas still rising?  Has anyone considered or actually mapped such a
"far future Terra," and what all should be taken into consideration? Are
there canonical (or non-canonical) refs to metroplexes or superstructures on
Earth, or lasting war damage? Has the ecology changed at all, have
extraterrestrial life forms entered our biosphere? Oh my, what a can of

</BZA>

Depends on how far in front you wanna look.  Under one model, we down here follow our destiny and completely overrun PNG and grind it under the northern parts of the continent.  The same model (IIRC) has the two halves of NZ becoming more widely seperated.

In terms of Trav timelines, not a huge deal of difference.  Couple of meters here and there.  Himalayas probably be a bit higher.  Few islands will have drifted a little, continents may have moved a bit and sea-levels will have probably altered significantly.  The damage form all those really-quick rocks will have been cleaned up and provision will have been made forthose feline-like humanoids with a comfortable choice in footware.  San Francisco\'s water supplies will have been relocated and the Red Wings will have been hailed as the gods of Hockey.  So, all in all, not a great deal of change will have taken place.

Actually, the Anasazi are relatively recent, dating, at most, from a few
hundred BC. The large Chaco Canyon site, the classic Anasazi cliff
dwelling was constructed around 1000 AD.

Now, depending on who you talk to, the Anasazi _are_ still around, as the
Pueblo and Hopi tribes in AZ and NM. 

In fact, all of the \'great Empires\' of the New World are relatively
recent. The Olmec culture, the progenitors of the Maya, and who influenced
the other cultures in Central and South America, date from about 1500-900
BC.

"To the shores of Tripoli" refers to US operations against Barbary Coast
pirate states well  before the War of 1812, that could only be carried
out since the US was at peace with Britain at the time.

There were no significant US naval operations in the Med in the actual
war of 1812, and no troop landings of any size that I\'m aware of.

>Item: The Brittish did not mobilize their army in any great force.
Britain\'s mobilization or lack thereof was determined by the course of
the Napoleonic war. It might be more acccurate to say that they finally
demobilized a significant fraction of their army after years of the bloody
Penninsular war.

Sometimes, it is best for friends to step back, shake hands, and
congratulate each other on a good game.

Then, they can go about the important stuff.

	In the last century, we have had countries that were at war with
each other become steady friends.  Why?  Does anyone see the 3I ever
becoming friends with a polity that they had a war with?

Trav Digest 13 gives details on Terra.  Stuff relevant to North America:

Largest city is Los Angeles (pop 12.2. bil).  The starport in NA is called
\'Starport Paulo\' - originally named \'Starport Phoenix\' but renamed because
this was the name of Solomani underground resistance.

A dome was built over New York (originally because of pollution) and it had
since been turned into a museum.

And we REALLY needed to talk last night.

The CAT\'s name is Tissriel.  I know it\'s not Japanese, it\'s from a
language I use in the universe I do my novels in, which is also my TU.
Princess of a major non-Aslan feline race, when Tissriel was a child she
was famous for chasing her tail.  So was my cat when she was small.

This is actually an oddity about the Invasion Earth map.  Most of the
continental outlines don\'t look much altered -- but it looks as if there\'s an
arm of the Mediterranean stretching up the Nile Valley, and most of
the West Siberian Plain is underwater.  Meanwhile other places that are
much closer to current sea level are drawn as land.

My guess is (if you can take the I:E map seriously) that there hasn\'t
actually been any huge rise in sea level, but that there *have* been some
massive hydrological-engineering projects which have submerged certain
areas.  Why Egypt and Siberia?  Your guess is as good as mine. . .

And doing a pretty good job of it.  The Himmalayas are indedd rising, a few
inches per century.  In fact, in about 5000 years Everst won\'t be the

northern Quebec seems to be gone, for instance, and there are big new seas
in Siberia and Africa.  Actually, this map is a bit screwed up.  If you
actually assemble it into a polyhedron things in NA wouldn\'t match up!

As for population centers there appears to be mega-cities in Mexico,
Buenos Ares, London, Berlin, Cairo, Moscow, Beijing, Tokyo, South Africa,
Sydney (Sydney?), and Antarctica (something called Shackleton).  

They seem to have saved the rain-forest and reversed the desertification
of Africa as well.

Regarding what the US looks like at this time, there appear to be massive
population concentrations around Detroit and the East Coast.  The
Northwest is still heavily forested and there is a major starport in the
rockies called Paulo.

As for the lasting of political entities and cultures, I\'m pretty sure
divisions will remain, but things will be much more fragmented.  I see
earth as a future version of Jerusalem: Highly important historically and
politically, fought over constantly (in various violent and non-violent
ways), over-crowded and a little run-down.  Pockets of preserved
wilderness remain, but most of the surface is (or was at one time at
least) devoted to agriculture and other human-centered activities. 
Variations in skin-tone are diminished, with very pale and very dark
people being rarer, but race is far from being eliminated due to
back-lashes against homogenization.  Still, the dominant ethnic conflicts
are between Solomani (when they arent\' quibbling amonst themselves) and
Vilani/Mixed individuals.  (All IMTU IMO, comments welcomed)_

BTW, I only skimmed the thread on Zhodani and Vilani races, but it occurs
to me that just about every pic I\'ve seen of either of these groups
portrays a white person.  Did they have suns with lower UV or something?
Or do we just have to accept that it\'s a marketing/artist\'s bias kinda
thing?  Actually, the latter seems like the necessary explanation, as
most Solomani are portrayed as white also...

Why is the Imperium as large as it is, and how could it be considered to be
a whole? It takes (correct me If I am wrong) a year or two at maximum jump
to go from the spinward marches to the Solomani rim. The Imperium exists to
facilitate free trade... however, few worlds would ever trade with worlds
more than a subsector away. Sectors would surely exist almost entirely in
isolation. The cost of transporting goods from one end of a sector to
another would be phenomenal (if monthly payments had to be met... I suppose
not a problem for the megacorporations...)

Either way, trade from Britain to the colonies (and later independent
states) in the age of sail was not only common but vital for the economy.
How frequent is trade over these distances in the Imperium? I would imagine
it would have to be carried out by huge vessels that were fully paid off.

DSM-IV is a *lot* "looser" than DSM-III with regards to being "kinky". 

Basicly, If it doesn\'t bother *you* and doesn\'t interfere with your

Being that this list isn\'t XXX rated, and most of you *really* don\'t

Even if we forget the freighter long-distance trade routes tended by 
megacorporations like Tukera, there is a fundamental difference 
between the Britain/Colonies situation and the Imperium: while the 
Atlantic Ocean was a discrete jump between Britain and the Colonies, 
there is no such "jump" on the Imperium (with the exception, maybe, 
of the Rift/Corridor area separating the Domain of Deneb).

The imperium is basically a *connected,* continuous area of 
reasonable stellar density. Even if one world (A) only trades with 
worlds up to a subsector apart (B) , those worlds (B) trade with 
other worlds (C) a subsector apart from (B), and *two* subsectors 
apart from (C)... from the individual world point of view, trade may 
be local. But when you aggregate it, it is *not* true that sectors 
are isolated. Subsector A of a sector will trade with subsector M of 
the sector coreward, with subsector D of the sector spinward, and 
with subsector P of the sector spinward-coreward... there is simply 
no place inside the Imperium where you can trace a line and say that 
no significant trade is conducted between both sides.

I can just see it: a  Vargr  stuffs  his  mouth  full  of  mashed
potato, then punches his jowles sending out a white  spray.  "I\'m
a zit, geddit?"  And before anyone  can  react  the  Vargr  yells
"Food Fight!" and chaos ensues.

The "no pets" rule sounds very sensible to me!

beginning to end. If I recall my history correctly, the Americans (in
the form of \'shopkeeper\' militia) invaded Canada and grabbed some
land - at one point claiming a \'major\' victory over half a dozen
trappers in a permanent camp. The British promptly sent regular
troops - who took the land back in no short order - and \'blockaded\'
the US ports (basically an excuse for outrageous piracy). America then
sent *their* regular troops into Canada and pushed the British
regulars out - notably at York and a string of frontier forts - only
to find out that the Indian \'troops\' (including, bizarrely, the ones
\'loyal\' to the French, who the British were supposed to be fighting in
the first place) virtually destroyed the supply lines and meant they
had to give the gains back. In the meantime, the British ships -
basically just merchantmen with a few guns - came up against American
warships and came off worst (for the most part). To bring an end to
it, the British burned Washington to the ground and attacked New
Orleans under the very mistaken impression that only the American
French would defend it. Having been beaten to a bloody pulp (they
refused to retreat at first) by the massed forces of most of the
American army, they realised that they had utterly underestimated the
national feeling of the still new country and promptly negotiated a
weird peace just to get their troops back to mainland Europe. Total
shambles.

ObTrav: So how would that fit in with Mileu 0, as the Imperium is
growing. For example, what would have happened had the \'Imperial\' Navy
met both the Vilani and a pocket empire at the same time, and found
the two were trading outside the Imperial economy?

Well, there _was_ the minor problem that the British Navy was also

It depends.  Asking the government of the Soviet Union
or the Solomani Confederation to follow the laws on
its books could get you sent to the gulag.  You would
be called an opportunist for making that argument,
comrade, so watch out.  

On the other hand, the Imperial government is not a
government of laws, so it just follows its own
procedures at its own discretion.  Individual citizens
are rarely aggrieved by Imperial action, although
member states, starship owners, and corporations
typically are, because they function within the web of
Imperial regulations.  In my Traveller universe,
review of administrative action is usually available.

Having lived in the uS Southwest most of my life, I am
accustomed to seeing weapons, long ones, short ones,
smooth ones, rifled ones, sharp ones, blunt ones.  One
of the things that all the areas of the Southwest that I have
lived in had in common was that you don\'t point a weapon,
any weapon, at someone without cause and get away with
it.  You leave it in its holster, sheath, sling, ect. until you are
ready to use it and when you unholster, unsheath, unsling,
unetc. it, everyone assumes that you are going to use it.
If you use it for anything other than self defense or to kill
meat (or to practice for one of those), you have committed
a crime and will probably be punished.

According to a Senate decision in the last year, yes.

I am reminded of Tom Lehrer\'s song about the Multi
Lateral Force, which was an idea in the 1960s for the
defense of Europe that would have put nuclear weapons
under the control of West Germany.  In his
introduction to the song, he notes that MLF is touted
as a good idea because it is supported by our
"traditional allies, the Germans", even though opposed
by "our recent allies, the French", which brings
considerable laughter from the audience.

I have no doubt that the various great and small
powers in the Far Future exist in a flux of changing
alliances.  For example, between Frontier Wars, the
Imperium and the Zhodani Consulate probably cooperate
on curbing Vargr piracy.  Local nobles probably have
considerable discretion to make temporary to ad hoc
agreements with extra-Imperial neighbors, even if the
general situation between the Imperium and the other
power is hostile.

I vaguely remember hearing about some Soviet-era ideas to flood Siberia
to try to moderate the climate.  Don\'t recall any references.  Barrier 
island erosion will be fairly severe by then too.  For example, Cape Cod
itself is predicted to erode away in only 5000 years -- it\'s a transient
feature, a 15000 year old glacial moraine.

Marc Miller\'s _Luna_ article seems to suggest that Terran government is
based around continental "provinces", with Luna counted as one of the
continents.

Nielsen was better in his comedy stuff.  He did a movie about 25 yrs ago 
whose name escapes me, but one scene I remember is him pouring a bottle of 
whiskey on some corn flakes for breakfast, then saying \'Crime time!\'  They 
were out to hijack a ship...

Anybody else remember this movie?

Could it be the rainforest (tropical and PNW temperate) are actually

Well, this is *Traveller*, and you\'re on the TML, so there\'s only one real
answer: white people have an evolutionary advantage, and other races just
*naturally* became extinct.  What else explains it?

Wondering if a race war on the TML would be more interesting than a guns &

That\'s right, baby, bow before the American entertainment industry! We might
not have "won" the War of 1812, but we put out a movie in which a French
pirate, played by a guy from Vladivostok, came along with his motley crew of
buccaneers saved Charlton Heston from certain doom at the Battle of New
Orleans!

So you can *keep* your Ray Bradbury Theater... and your half of the that
other show with the Canadian mountie, his dog, and the American detective!

I don\'t think China has changed that much, actually.  Instead of Shang, we
now have the Mao Dynasty.  And recent events with the Falun Gong suggest
that this dynasty may have lost the Mandate of Heaven, meaning another
Warring States period could be on the horizon...

Sometimes I wonder if all of "Western" civilization will be only a blip in
the thousands of years of history of the Middle Kingdom.  (Of course, such
continuity is only maintained through often heavy-handed stifling of
innovation which might upset the balance of society... suddenly the
longevity of the Ziru Siirka begins to look more plausible.)

Yes, but if you are looking for a game one presumes you might be able to

And big bucks.  I really do want to know the technical uses of this and
that in the Far Future... I\'ve had a few PC\'s that would have taken this
information and run with it.

Julissa, for one.  She was every Bad Noblewoman on the Side of the Good
Guys in space opera, rolled into one curvaceous package.

(I really want to recreate her!  I think the thing I like about the idea
of GURPS Traveller is that characters like Jiss, who were born of lucky
die rolls, can actually be *planned*.  I REALLY, REALLY want to play
Julissa haut-D\'Bari again, but I don\'t know if I even have a character
sheet any more... sheesh, I created her when I was 16!  Which is longer
ago than I care to admit.)

Ooh, flamebait!

Question: how much  of  the  American  entertainment  industry  is
American?

Hmmm ... we\'ve already had a list of non-American actors posing as
Americans (could probably add others).

Location shots when not by that rock  in  California:  X-Files  is
shot mainly in Canada, Earth 2 (well  I  liked  it)  was  shot  in
Mexico I think, Matrix shot in Australia.

Studios: Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Aliens, ... shot in UK.

Seems like the  "American"  entertainment  industry  is  really  a
global entertainment industry that packages itself as American  to
get around the average American\'s stunted  education.  See  recent
TML thread about people  thinking  "Saving  Private  Ryan"  was  a
Vietnam War film and the bad  guys  were  Japs,  James  Bond  film
"Licence Revoked" was renamed "Licence To Kill" cos most Americans
asked don\'t know what \'revoked\' means, "The Madness Of King George
III" was renamed "The Madness Of King George" cos  most  Americans
asked said they wouldn\'t see it before seeing the first two  films
... I could go on.

Consider the picture of a *faaaaar* future earth painted in Vernor
Vinge\'s "Marooned in Real Time."  The Juan de Fuca Plate dissappears
in the Pacific Northwest subduction zone, the Cocos Plate continues
to pull away from the Nazca Plate and move north, which continues to
push the tiny San Andreas Plate in a northwesterly direction, over the
top of the Pacific Plate.  By some time around MegaYear 50, all of what
is now coastal California, from San Francisco to the tip of Baja, is
a long, skinny island off the coast of what used to be Oregon and
Washington.

Right, because the Pacific Plate is moving slowly north and west.  In
the western Pacific, It is pushing under the Eurasian Plate (in the
north) and the Philippines Plate and Caroline Plate (in the south.)
This is why the islands of Japan and the Philippines are so tectonically
and volcanically active.

> > Aren\'t the Himmalayas still rising?

Right again.  As the Indian Plate moves northeast, it piles up on top
of the much larger Eurasia Plate and the Himalayas are the result.

Hm, what\'s changed, say, just between Shang and Qing... mode of

"Often heavy-handed stifling of innovation????"  I\'ll give you my spot in
the department if you can name, say, three imperially-stifled innovations
in Chinese history (caveat being that I don\'t regard armed insurrections
as innovations per se.)  That\'s around one per millenium.

Basically, my response is as follows:

The canonical assumption about a free (or \'tramp\') trader is that you\'re talking about something equivalent to a small business.  The assumption is that a typical free trader is sort of the \'han solo\' type, poor and on the edge.

Now, a free trader, depending on your ruleset, represents a capital investment of between 25 and 50 MCr.  Assuming a 20% down and that the captain has a 10% share, that means his investment is 500-1000 kCr.

This means that your average free trader is, by standards of most worlds (and most other traveller characters), extremely wealthy.  This is _not_ the image of the classic trader.  

Assuming you don\'t want every free trader to be quite wealthy, an order of magnitude reduction in the cost of a basic trade ship is in order...

Not a Canadian, but IIRC it was a Native American word/phrase \'Kanata\' or 
some similar spelling that referred to a local landmark.

I might be right, I might be wrong, wouldn\'t be the first time for either. :-)

Note that the easiest way to do that is to have an \'entry-level\' trader which is just very small.  It will not be particularly competitive on rates with larger ships, however.

Note that the easiest way to do that is to have an \'entry-level\' trader which is just very small.  It will not be particularly competitive on rates with larger ships, however.

You\'ll need to do some tweaking of the design and/or economics rules
for this to work. Certain items hit minimum price and displacement limits
where you just can\'t make them smaller or cheaper, no matter how
small a ship you are making. A type-A Free Trader from CT had the
cheapest, smallest drives and computers available, for example - making
the ship smaller won\'t save on the really expensive stuff, it\'ll just
reduce the size of your cargo bay.

it referres to a village. French exploreres misstook the word \'Kanata\'
(meaning the village they were being brought to) as being the name of the
land and marked there maps as such, but spelled \'Canada\'

This is supported in canon by equipment such as the high-tech "universal

adjusts itself to show "local time" as well as Imperial...

Sorry, can\'t remember its exact name, it was in the MT equipment list and fully

I\'ve played with this by hand waving the costs in the books as Military
grade equipment.  This makes civilian cargo vessels extremely fragile in
comparison to military ships, so combat is a big no-no.  Also the
civilian jump drives have less redundancies and fail safes than the
military models causing the chances of misjumps from unrefined fuel and
poor maintenance to be much higher (I had to lower the chance of fatal
misjumps to keep PC\'s alive).

I\'ve also played with having most of the large bulk cargoes of food
stuffs and equipment being handled by bulk merchant fleets that belong
to mega-corps and merchant prince families.  This leaves small size,
high value courier cargo for PC\'s in ships.  Most of this trade are
things that either need more security/lower profile than a ship with
several hundred tons of other peoples cargo could provide.  This seemed
to fit with the mix of players I get having a lot of ex military combat
people along with a few scouts and such transporting 5 & 10 dT
prototypes and such.

	No, Sir John A. MacDonald drew letters out of a hat and

	You are right, though the spelling is arbitrary.  My

Sounds typical. Save money by closing hospitals, yet don\'t put some of that
money back into community care.

Last year I assigned my students a research project on homelessness. (A
"hot issue" here in Hogtown, with advocacy groups demanding money for
shelters, and rich folks demanding human trash removal from their
neighbourhoods.)

Step one was, naturally, trying to discover the root of the problem. My
best group read a lot of reports, conducted interviews, visited shelters...
(it became something of a passion for them). They decided that the start of
our homeless problem was the closing down of psychiatric facilities without
any provision for continuing treatment. Were they right?  Their numbers
were convincing, certainly.

I rather liked their solution, too. Stop giving professional sports teams
tax money, and instead spend it on community health care.  They\'d added up
the money given to professional sports teams, and figured that less than
half of that total would be enough to provide good community care.

Tenuous ObTrav: IMTU, professional sports teams get no government money.
They are either supported by gate receipts, or noble patronage.

True, but there\'s still a considerable difference between 100 tons and 200 tons.  If you really want the \'tramp freighter\' model you\'d probably have to reduce the minimum size of a jump-ship.

Sydney alsmost qualifies for a megacity now, except for the population.

the Greater Sydney Metro area is the same size as London. Again though, the

Actually, this is deadly serious.  We don\'t get roommates, our rent goes
from $440 a month to $1317 a month in a heartbeat.  And we can\'t afford to
move ourselves to anywhere within fifty miles of were we work, which our
car wouldn\'t be able to take.

Er, the challenge was so taken up, in Ireland. That\'s a part of what all this
stuff in Ulster is about (or at least part of the tradition of troubles). As to
"then-current-regime" - the King was removed by Parliament and replaced with
someone with better protestant credentials. In the modern sense, the best
description would be a coup.

btw, Parliament enshrined the principles underlying its actions in a document
called the Bill of Rights.

Well, this is *Traveller*, and what with all of those High Law worlds out
there
and PC\'s as you know are all incredible anarchists, so the actual real
answer is:
The pictures are of PC\'s, PC\'s are wanted on at least one or two planets
apiece,
White folk are the only group too stupid to duck when the cameras are
rolling.
(Yes I\'m so pasty white it hurts.)
I Suspect this would also result in a disproportionate arrest and conviction
rate
for whites in the 3I as well. YMMV.

HUH????   Are you serious?  I thought the lease just wasn\'t renewed
because they wanted to put in a child care instead.

I\'m sorry for your loss, and I understand that it was an old respected
place... but I have noticed that there are no longer SUV\'s parked on our
sidewalks *every single night*, directly under the "No Parking" signs.
One night I came home and there were three SUV\'s parked in the cul-de-sac
at the end of our side street right in the road-- if my building had
caught fire I\'d have lost everything because the fire engines would never
have gotten in.  Nobody who owned a car on our street (Bird Street) liked
the Dovre because you had to get home before 6 PM if you wanted to park
your car.  I have never owned a car, but my ex did.

Not picking on your club in particular, but there are just too many bars
in this neighborhood.  If only they\'d closed the Albion instead.  I have
to walk past it every morning to get to the bus stop to go to work-- it
always smells like a blasted urinal.  I don\'t think it\'s the homeless
people because it\'s right outside the bar and not all over the rest of the
street...

Call me ignorant (because I am, living way out of the CON US), but surely if
all firearms were illegal, then finding any kind of gun means you can peg
the guy for carrying an illegal weapon. And then the jury are pretty damn
sure the "defendant" can\'t be that honest.

Yup.  10 November 1775, in the Tun Tavern in Philadelphia (now you know
why the Marine bar on S:AAB\'s SARATOGA was called the Tun Tavern!).

FWIW, the US Army was formed (as the Continental Army) on 14 June 1775. 
I don\'t know about the swabbies or zoomies....

This clearly isn\'t true; the invasions of Canada were among the first
military actions of the war. (If the US *wasn\'t* planning on invading Canada,
what exactly did you think they *were* planning at the start of the war? To
stare at the British until moral outrage forced the UK to surrender? Even the
US was surprised by US naval successes, but everyone realized those
successes also couldn\'t be sustained inevitably - by the end of the war
almost no US superfrigate was in battleworthy condition.

Well, this just ties in neatly with the War of 1812 thread.  "Perfidious
Albion", indeed!

OTOH, during our T:2K campaign a couple of years back, our referee
generally referred to the French as "the ancestral foe."

Well, this is highly dependent on my success in getting my SO into 
Trav. The plan of attack is for me to run a one-on-one game with her,
see if I can get back in the swing of GMing, see if she gets into it
(she used to play a little D&D eons ago, so the indications aren\'t too
bad), and if that happens, then, well, gaming is a mutual hobby and 
therefore something we can spend time together on. 

Between her work schedule and mine, any hobbies that reduce our time 
together are frowned upon.

No you didn\'t, you gave them that strange game with body armour, a

*We* (the UK) gave them football, which is always played with a round

Hmm.....I\'ve looked back over this thread, and it\'s interesting to note the
number of "How can you even THINK the Brits won this war" posts coming from
US addresses (and the number of "No, the Brits/Canucks won the war" posts
coming from UK/Canada addresses).

Is it really so important to attach \'won\' and \'lost\' labels to a war?
There\'s really no such thing - there\'s just the state you\'re in before it
starts and the state you\'re in when it\'s over. All else is spin for the
plebs.

Of course, there\'s the matter of national pride....

I suspect the best way to put this is to claim that the major "racial"
differences once visible among Terran humans still exist, but that most
fine distinctions have gotten blurred out of existence over the millennia.

Besides, there\'s been 3,000 years of opportunities for people who *really*
want to cling to their ethnic identity to emigrate, rather than trying to do
it cheek-by-jowl with all those foreigners. . .

Actually, given the usual distribution of stellar types in canonical material,
most inhabited world *do* suffer a UV deficit.  All those itty-bitty red dwarf
stars.  Not even I would offer that as a handwave in this case, though :-).

 Simple enough to do in MT... MT\'s hits for vehicles were "errata\'ed" in

Reduce costs by factor of 10 except for hull, and use the listed DP\'s,

True enough, except under TNE, were the minimum was eliminated. They had a
65 tonner...

The order of precedence for US services (based upon year of foundation) is
Navy, Army, Marines, Coast Guard, and Air Force. There were Marines prior
to the USMC, but they were not the "US Marine Corps", but instead, naval
infacntry. Got this drilled into me by a USMC Gunny Sgt, while a Navy cadet
in High School. It was also in the NS1 text. (Item of irony: the NS1-4
texts we used in NJROTC were the same ones in use for PSU\'s NROTC program
at the same time...)

The founding of the  USMC is about 1808, or so. Before the war, but not by
much. Foudned by an army captain who\'d been a "Marine" (Read Navalized
Infantryman). There was no provision for marines under the US constitution,
nor under the articles of confederation; in order to create it with minimal
legislation, it was attched to the Navy. The Air-Force split was even
wierder... the US Army had an Air Corps... the Air Force took most of the
AAC\'s people, but they merely got "all land-based fixed wing aircraft". The
Navy did the most with Blimps and Dirigibles, and also got to keep their
extensive air capabilities.

Ob Trav: IMTU, the Marines are part of the Navy in the same way the US
Marines are... at least for the Imperium. Sector, Subsector, and Planetary
navies may vary, but most follow the same practice. Solomani Marines,
however, are IMTU, a separate service, with "Attched Contingets".

We secretly control much of Steve Jackson Games, and through it, the
current published incarnation of Traveller.

Don\'t forget socialized medicine, less crime/gun control, and the other
flamebait issues. As for the War of 1812, it\'s pretty much our only major
military victory, other than (maybe) downing the Red Baron, Juno Beach and
liberating Holland.

That\'s what I was taught in the US Southeast, as well.  Some people scare
me to death the way they swing around sharp and pointy things, much less
things that go bang.  Gun control means something else entirely for some
of us. <g>

  Yes, but there are clearly numerous cases (at least in rural areas) 
where having a long-arm available is very reasonable. In cities you
have to decide whether society is safer with plentiful firearms as a
home-defence issue or with the option removed, or whether the debate is 
even to be framed in those terms - a political decision that I can accept.

OTOH, given that the United States have a population of over 250
million, of whom about 2000 play American football at the professional
level, it makes sense to armor said players, in order to keep from
breaking them.  After all, some of those players are paid several
million dollars (US) each year.  Armoring the players is a reasonable
way to protect that kind of investment.

Given that concept, it also makes sense to armor those high-school and
college students who have a chance to ascend to that 2000-player plateau
of professional football.

After all, the 3I armors most of its ground combat "players."

Or possibly, "A grove of trees you idiot."  Depending upon whom you talk to,
our popular Aussie kangaroo has a translated name of "I don\'t know?"  As in,
when the explorers first seen one, they pointed to it and asked, "What is
that called?" to which the recorded version of the reply was, "Kangaroo?"
Meaning, "I don\'t know?"

I sometime think to myself how funny it must be to hear the story, "This
mountain was named by the locals as, Tzbukkannann." only to find the locals
didn\'t have the heart to tell the white explorers when asked, "What is that
called?" and the answer really meaning, "It\'s a mountain you fool!"  ;^)

Another suggestion: "After Man: A Zoology of the Future" by Dougal
Dixon. (ISBN 0312194331, published by Griffin in 1998; there may be
earlier, hardcover editions, but Amazon.com has this one listed as
available.) It postulates what life on Earth might be like 50 million
years in the future, 50 million years after some kind of ecological
catastrophe that ultimately resulted in the extinction of the human
race. It also has maps, as the continents have shifted in the interim.
An interesting read.

On the other hand, there\'s the fact that the current Earth climate is
simply the warm interval between two successive glaciations. The last
few interglacial intervals lasted something in the neighbourhood of
8,000 to 12,000 years each... and it\'s been 10,000 since the current
one started. I\'d say there\'s better than even odds that a new Ice Age
will start within the next few thousand years.

Of course, in the Traveller universe, we may by then have the technology
to keep the glaciation at bay...

Still, there are those who believe that the evidence in favour of "global
warming" is sketchy at best, and that the current destabilization of 
global climate we\'re experiencing may be the prelude to the next Ice Age
already...

Cool.

Card".
Coincidence???

Exactly right!  It, according to my copper mates, has made certain issues

Three comments on this (and both should have obvious traveller implications):
1) In the US, that would require a federal ban (which isn\'t likely). Due to
the Second ammendment, the gun lobby, etc, sometimes the system CAN\'T
function.

2) Jury Nullification: The jury can still return a not guilty verdict, if
they felt the illegal act was justified. Happened locally on a convicted
felon with a gun. The search was all legal, etc... but the jury returned a
not guilty, even tho he feessed up that it was in fact his gun, and his
parole prohibited him having it. He needed it to hunt for food. The jury
decided his need for food nullified the criminality of his having a gun.
(He did get put away for a parole violation, however... just not more time
due to having the illegal gun.)

3) Unlawful Search and Seizure: The US Constitution (and many states\'
constitutions and regulations) have specific protections in place
regaurding search protocols, and when searches can be done without a
warrant, and the admissability of items found in various types of searches,
etc. Many weapons cases are thrown out due to unlawful searches resulting
in no admissable evidence.

Ob Trav: Obviously, not all worlds will have search and seizure
restrictions; not all will have Jury Trials; not all systems with either
will actually involve evidenciary methods of guilt determination. Also,
armed shipping would require an imperial ban... not bloody likely, since
that would mean increased losses due to piracy around the fringes, and the
armed pirates would be much more of a threat to civilian shipping.

Nick, we didn\'t wear those forty pounds of body armor when American
Football was young.  No helmets, no padding.  After 18 young men died on
college football fields during one season early this century people
started agitating for the colleges to either ban the game or make it more
safe.  First helmets, then pads, then face guards, more pads, until you
get up to the 40 pounds of armor.

This makes American football more safe than rugby?  This fall dozens of
young men suffered broken arms, legs, wreaked knees and suffered
concussions playing football here in my local area.  One 16 year old died
during football practice, another is parapelgic. Multiply that by several
thousand other communities across America. Every year college athletes
suffer crippling injuries, some cause lifetime disabilities.  For
professionals, concussions, temporary paralysis (there are "stingers" in
almost every game now),
compressed and fractured vertebra, fractures in hands, feet, arms and
legs, broken ribs, ligament and cartilage damage and the threat of
quadrapelgia are a constant threat throughout their careers.  If they play
a whole career crippling disability almost a certainty before they reach
middle age.

So, is football with its 40 pounds of armor safer than rugby?  Maybe it
is, I don\'t know the injury statistics for rugby, but in this case safe is
certainly relative.

Ob Traveller...IMTU gravball is more akin to handball than anything else,
ie non-contact.  I think most folks run it a little
differently. What other games are popular in YTU\'s?

In some cases the padding is more of a weapon than a protection, but
without it I know we\'d be looking at multiple deaths every week. I\'m not
exaggerating either.  When a 100 kg man runs full speed into several 150
kg men people are going to get hurt...badly.

That\'s right. R is played by none other than JOHN CLEESE and he was Q\'s

The only thing missing from the opening ceremonial coin toss are the Roman
salute and the uttering, "We who are about to die salute you!" Given the
success of the NFL\'s American Bowl series, its sponsorship of the CFL, and
the NFL Europe League, I predict that within 20 years, you\'ll see NFL teams
franchised outside the United States.

While Lorne Greene is mighty,  and such a practice would be a fitting
tribute, your theory is unfortunately false. The truth is that the American
government spent a long time trying to come up with the proper color for
such a card. Red was considered, but quickly discarded as it was a commie
color. White was also considered, but white is the color of the lily, and
nobody wanted to associate America with lily-livered cowardice or the white
flag of surrender. They thought about blue for a while. It was almost the
Blue Card. Sadly, nobody could think of anything that was actually blue
though. As it turns out, due to rampant pollution our sea and skies were
turned a nasty brownish color.

So, they finally settled on green, the color of American money. Let\'s face
it. American money is what *everybody* wants. It\'s why they leave the safety
of their pinko-communist countries and come here!

In my Traveller universe that would be a big *yes*. The Solomani might be
able to come up with mean genetic modifications, but they can\'t come up with
Tom Jetland: High Passage.

*Everybody* watches the Tom Jetland movies.

Except the artsy types who watch those pansy movies like "Lady Jaenshi\'s
Holiday" or "Dresden\'s Decision", but they don\'t count.

of in-jokes that nobody will ever get?

Only if I can work Yul Brynner into the discussion at one point or another.
I probably can. Yul was a very versatile actor. At one point he played the
King of Siam, and at another point he played an Indian chief. Yul was the
Man of a Thousand Races.

So, yeah, I\'m up for a race war!

    It\'s the Barbie Doll Theory, they make one in a colour to suit you. I\'m
sure Japanese RPGers see the majority of the races as asian and Nigerian
players see them as African. It doesn\'t matter what the illustrations are,

    Actually, we (Rugby) don\'t slam into each other any more, or they\'re not
supposed to. They\'ve altered the rules drastically in favour of safety and a
good thing I\'d have to say. In Gridiron the player\'s crunch into each other
frontally in a way that would get you suspended in Rugby, that and the fact
that Rugby tackles only occur if your holding the ball so your not liable to
be flattened from "Out-left-field" because your ready for it.
    One of the best days I\'ve ever had was watching the NSW Gridiron team
get slaughtered by Iowa (State College I think), there was more Americans on
the field than Australians in the stands but we still had a great time.

Yeah, *posing* as Americans! In America, we call them *wannabes*. We go to

an American."

Okay. Not all of us do that, just most of us... alright, *some* of us.

It\'s the American way to shoot movies where they\'re nice and cheap to shoot.
Sheesh. Most of Escape from New York was shot on the streets of St. Louis!
Yeah, that\'s right, over in France!

That\'s because those films all took place in England. Geez!

See the thread? SEE the thread? I lived it! That was *my* post!

Interestingly enough when Rambo: First Blood Part II was released in some
Asian markets the script was changed. As it turns out Rambo was saving POWs
from the Japanese in World War II. So... um... it can work in reverse! In
the African market they didn\'t even bother to translate it. It did amazingly
well among on that continent despite the language barrier.

There\'s an ObTrav (an Obvious Traveller reference) in there.

>James  Bond  film "Licence Revoked" was renamed "Licence To

Nah, that\'s because most people would think it was a *driving* movie!
Besides, we in America are *all about* killing. We all carry our licenses to
kill in our wallets, for crying out loud! 007 is much cooler when he\'s
killing people than when he\'s driving without a license.

Sheesh.

That\'s not actually *true*... is it?

(In all seriousness, I do remember reading about that. The studio claimed
they did no such survey, and they wouldn\'t have cared to do it. They cited
another reason for the name change, which I forget. They obviously changed
their story because they feared the collective rage of America when their
national pride was challenged.)

Yeah, and so could I... and that\'s scary. Let\'s just call it a draw, shall

Yeah, you say that now. My apologies, I just got back from Christmas

sore.

AMERICA

This comes from a Canadian newspaper about America.  A remarkable
editorial broadcast from Toronto by Gordon Sinclair, a Canadian
television commentator. What follows is the full text of his trenchant
remarks as printed in the Congressional Record:


"This Canadian thinks it is time to speak up for the Americans as the
most generous and possibly the least appreciated people on all the
earth.

Germany, Japan and, to a lesser extent, Britain and Italy were lifted
out of the debris of war by the Americans who poured in billions of
dollars and forgave other billions in debts.  None of these countries is
today paying even the interest on its remaining debts to the United
States.  When the franc was in danger of collapsing in 1956, it was the
Americans who propped it up, and their reward was to be insulted and
swindled on the streets of Paris.  I was there.  I saw it.

When earthquakes hit distant cities, it is the United States that
hurries in to help.  This spring, 59 American communities were flattened
by tornadoes.  Nobody helped.  The Marshall Plan and the Truman Policy
pumped billions of dollars into discouraged countries.  Now newspapers
in those countries are writing about the decadent, warmongering
Americans.  I\'d like to see just one of those countries that is gloating
over the erosion of the United States dollar build its own airplane.
Does any other country in the world have a plane to equal the Boeing
Jumbo Jet, the Lockheed Tri-Star, or the Douglas 10?  If so, why don\'t
they fly them?  Why do all the International Airlines except Russia fly
American planes?  Why does no other land on earth even consider putting
a man or woman on the moon?

You talk about Japanese technocracy, and you get radios.  You talk about
German technocracy, and you get automobiles.  You talk about American
technocracy, and you find men on the moon-not once, but several
times-and safely home again.  You talk about scandals, and the Americans
put theirs right in the store window for everybody to look at.  Even
their draft-dodgers are not pursued and hounded.  They are here on our
streets, and most of them, unless they are breaking Canadian laws, are
getting American dollars from ma and pa at home to spend here.

When the railways of France, Germany & India were breaking down through
age, it was the American who rebuilt them.  When the Pennsylvania
Railroad and the New York Central went broke, nobody loaned them an old
caboose.  Both are still broke.  I can name you 5000 times when the
Americans raced to the help of other people in trouble.  Can you name me
even one time when someone else raced to the Americans in trouble?  I
don\'t think there was outside help even during the San Francisco
earthquake.

Our neighbors have faced it alone, and I\'m one Canadian who is damned
tired of hearing them get kicked around.  They will come out of this
thing with their flag high.  And when they do, they are entitled to
thumb their nose at the lands that are gloating over their present
troubles.  I hope Canada is not one of those.  Stand proud, Americans!"

Good point about Pokemon, though.  Even the Ziru Siirka fell before Virus.

Why should I want to become an ossified tool of the academic establishment?
 ;)  I make no claim to being a China scholar; the closest I\'ve come is
reading GURPS China a few times for research.  Strictly a layman\'s ignorant
ramblings here.

Just off the top of the head, though:

The trading fleets that represented a brief change from historical
isolationism, during what the rest of the world came to call the Age of
Discovery.  The ships were soon called back and destroyed; no profit in
stirring up the foreign devils.

The man-carrying kite, whose creator was put to death by an Emperor who
feared its consequences.  (Or was that just a fable?)

Afraid I don\'t have a third, but a little research (perhaps in the modern
era) might turn up something.  Tien An Men Square, perhaps, if one counts
"democracy" as an innovation...

My layman\'s observation is that Chinese culture values communitarian
stability and continuity over individual dynamism and disruption.  Look at
what happened when Disney plucked one (possibly the only) individualist
story out of Chinese legend, then tried to show it in its country of
origin.  MULAN bombed in China because she was "too independent, too
selfish."  Too Western.

ObTrav:  the opening of China, including the Boxer Rebellion, and the N
Interstellar Wars.  Compare and contrast.  :)

Actually, Aussie rules is based on _Gaelic_  Football, not Association
Football  ( otherwise known as soccer, because that\'s what ya to do to the
wife after the game. )

It\'s the Brazilians that teach the Brits how to play soccer

I rather expect that a "tramp freighter" is worth considerably than
you\'d think (and I\'m talking about the current sea-going type). So
perhaps we need to reconsider our overly romantic view of tramp
freighters.

You\'ve missed a point. Check out how long it takes to get from core to
the spinward marches or to the Solomani Rim. Then check out how long it
took to sail from Britain to India. Also check out what *sort* of goods
were carried on such voyages.

I\'m pretty sure that you\'ll find that only *high* value cargos that
couldn\'t be gotten closer were carried on the 6-month or longer
voyages. 

I see no reason why the same wouldn\'t be true in the Imperium.

  Speaking of which, by 1100 there are probably a number of historians
at Terran universities who have cleverly written revisionist or merely
alternative interpretations of, say, the Imperial campaign for Terra.

  If you\'ve somehow managed to publish something that paints the attack
as a horrific attempt to destroy the Solomani cultural heritage (well,
at TL D-E there\'s going to be a _lot_ of breakage from misses...) you
might eventually become someone whom the Party would like to see given
a department.

  If, on the other hand, you\'ve seriously undermined the Solomani official
version - intentionally or not - then you\'d better hope that you never
enter Solomani jurisdiction/control; Solsec isn\'t going to leave marks on
you until after you\'ve recanted - publicly, extensively, and repeatedly -
even if it takes years to undo the damage you\'ve done to the cause.

  I understand that there are those who say that half of S&A already reads
as if the Party ideological boffins had signed off on the final version :>

  Sure, but once the option of military resistance in England proper was 
foregone the issue was settled; Ireland could at best hope to secure its
own liberty over a period of years, not to overthrow the new regime.

  And the King being "removed by Parliament" was screamingly illegal, as
the entirety of English political discourse in the century had concluded.

It\'s *not* the Barbie Doll theory in this case. It\'s quite the opposite. The
Barbie Doll theory requires a certain degree of self-consciousness to work.
The point is that they *do* make them in a wide spectrum of colors. Charles
pointed out a very different situation.

>It doesn\'t matter what the illustrations are, it\'s in your mind.

Except when there are illustrations on the page, then it\'s not really in
your mind anymore, is it? After all, the whole point of putting pictures
with text is to visually bring that text to life.

Sci-fi is a largely white genre. At least here in America, a walk into the
sci-fi aisle of any bookstore will bear that fact out. Just look at the
covers. That\'s not an indictment of the sci-fi industry, if I wanted to post
such an indictment I could find better places and better ways to do so.

Roleplaying is a largely white industry. It\'s not politically correct, nor
politically incorrect, to recognize this fact. I doubt that anybody would be
really surprised by such a statement. It\'s just the way things happen to be
right now.

It naturally follows those two facts that the artists for a sci-fi
roleplaying game are going to most likely be white. There\'s also a very good
chance that, given the overwhelming whiteness of sci-fi imagery, that
illustrations will fall in-line with the status quo.

I\'m not making a value judgement here, nor was I doing so in my original
post. I was merely giving my reason for saying that the illustrations in
Traveller materials don\'t reflect the biological "realities" of the Third
Imperium. They reflect certain facts that exist outside of the game.

However, I do think that it\'s a serious mistake to write off illustrations
as irrelevant. Illustrations have massive power in shaping how people think
about things. This is especially true in science-fiction, for the simple
fact that sci-fi has walked hand-in-hand with other forms of visual media
since its inception.

Illustrations in roleplaying games are especially important. As an example,
here\'s a little test. I\'ll list a bunch of words, and you tell me what pops
into your mind:

kobold, Trepida / Intrepid grav tank, S-Class Scout/Courier, Kinunir Class
Colonial Cruiser, (Arch)Duke Norris, Droyne, red dragon, modular cutter

A long time ago, in a thread about the future of Traveller, I commented on
the importance of setting up a "visual tapestry" for the game universe. My
original goal in life was to become a graphic designer and illustrator, and
as a result I\'ve learned *never* to underestimate the power of illustration.
I can draw all varieties of AD&D dragons in my sleep, simply because a
"visual tapestry" existed in the early days of that game. A red dragon
always had a specific facial structure. Kobolds, whether drawn by Dee or
Otus always looked like *kobolds*. Later on, TSR got sloppy. Dragons and
sub-humanoid races looked like whatever the artist wanted them when he or
she was painting or drawing them. This post isn\'t an indictment of TSR
either, so I\'ll leave it at that.

When Jesse says he\'s going for a better (illustrated) Traveller universe, I
suspect he\'s got a similar idea in mind. Countless Beowulfs, Donosevs,
Xboats and "Puking Dogs" later, everybody knows what these ships look like.
Who can think of the Aslan without thinking of the fantastic Kieth
illustrations? Or the Trepida / Intrepid grav tank without thinking of the
scads of illustrations which brought the vehicle to life?

Well, not exactly true... I have a few.

OTOH, a 30 kilo, sentient (Well, we\'re not sure of that, as it was a PC)

And the infamous (locally) "I Assault Him!"
It seems a player had fallen asleep during the game. His character, who was
a psionicist, was the ship\'s grunt, a Vargr, and had just encountered a
teleport marine in engineering... after having started into the crawlways
himself. Rules in force TNE except for psionics, which were MT rules, but
with TNE Skill checks.

GM (Me): Hey Sid! You\'re facing a Zho Marine, in Combat Armor.

Part of it has to do with the nature of printing. Aside from the covers, 
which are in color, most artwork in Traveller is lineart. Black on white. 
This means that the subtle differences in skintone of, say, the UV-starved 
Zhodani (their star is K0-V) or the even more UV-starved Vilani (though see 
below) require great subtlety of technique. For lineart, olive-skinned (the 
Zhodani) or pasty (the Vilani, IMHO) is all "white."

 Looking up the luminosities of these two stars shows why these particular 
races are "white". Pliebr has a luminosity of 0.42 (Sol = 1.0), while Vlands 
main star is actually a bit of a mystery. The sector listings for Vland list 
a K8-V (lumin. = 0.06!), while the text from V&V mentions a "hot, F-type 
star" of luminosity 1.21. Both citations are from V&V, by the way, so it 
seems that the DGP holdings just got a little less valuable...

Actually, Benedict Arnold was a *True Patriot*, he was a
leader who distinguished himself in many ways before
he had a change of heart.  Colonel Arnold and Ethan
Allen along with a contingent of the Green Mountain Boys
captured Fort Ticonderoga May 10, 1775.  The supplies
that he "liberated"  helped George Washington\'s
ill-equipped American forces, who were besieging
Boston. Later the same year Arnold led a brave but
unsuccessful assault on British Québec and was
promoted to brigadier general; enemy reinforcements
subsequently forced his retreat to Lake Champlain.

On the lake Arnold was defeated (1776) by a British
naval attack, but his delaying tactics thwarted an enemy
drive to New York City, which would have divided the
colonies. His leadership in the Battle of Ridgefield,
Connecticut (April 1777), won him a belated promotion
to the rank of major general. During the crucial Saratoga
campaigns in New York in the summer and fall of 1777,
his relief of Fort Stanwix and his courageous and
imaginative battlefield leadership contributed decisively
to an American victory.

___________________________________________
In 1778, after becoming commander of Philadelphia, he
met Margaret Shippen who he married in 1779.  He
squandered most of his money on an extravagant social
life.  His need of money, along with growing resentment
over real and immagined slights led to the above
mentioned change of heart.  In 1780 he agreed to
surrender the fort at West Point (the key to the Hudson
River valley), of which he was Comandant.

I have never heard of the stamp to which you refer;
however, I do know that there is a memorial statue to
Benedict Arnold.  He was promised a memorial before
he became a turn coat.  I understand that the statue is of
a (pair of) boot(s).  His name is not on the memorial
because they didn\'t promise him that and many didn\'t
want to memorialize him at all; however, the leaders were
as good as thier word and kept it but no more.

It\'s a TNE abberation - aside from the Jump Torpedoes in Leviathan 
(Adv 4),  also hinted at in some issues of Book 2 (see old TML 
digests for reference), no other edition of Traveller allows 
sub-100dt jump capable starships.

Not the Jumbo (at the moment) but the Airbus pretty much blows the 
other two away. Except when the USN is blowing it away :-/

>Why do all the International Airlines except Russia fly American planes?

Because the UK manufacturers collapsed out of the international 
market as it transitioned to jets when the DH Comet accidents 
happened, and it took 30 years for a credible alternative to be 
developed (in this case Airbus Industrie). As a result, there are 
really only two major civil passenger aircraft manufacturers now, 
Boeing and Airbus.

  re Washington:
  "In Maryland, Virginia and Pennsylvania there were then living not far 
from 1.5 millions of whites. Yet this great population remained in its 
towns and cities and suffered 5,000 Englishmen to spend five weeks in its
midst without once attempting to drive the invaders from its soil."

  In any case, it is obviously counter-productive to a strategy of amphibious
raiding to actually hold indefinitely all but the most vital of objectives,
unless ones troop strength for such duties is much greater than that available
to the British in 1812-13.

>Item: The proof that HMRN was, in fact, not the be-all and end-all of seapower

  More accurately, the proof that sea-power was not the be-all and end-all 
of strategy, which a number of agencies have since forgotten.

Personally, I can\'t see why a country with that policy

Sounds like ROLLERBALL could also be a popular sport on some Traveller
lower-tech (and maybe even some higher-tech) worlds, especially those set up
as corporate worlds. It\'s been awhile since that movie came out...:) :)

But the individual nations did continue under the Terran Confederation
albeit with very little power. See AM6, p. 5.

There is no evidence that they did, though. And evidence that at least one
old nation-state (Nepal) survived to 1109 -- as a district, not a nation.
See AM6, pp. 45-48.

When the United Nations became a world government, nations became renamed
disticts (AM6, p. 46). The District of Nepal remained a constitutional
monarchy until a referendum in -2030, so clearly the UN, the Terran
Confederation, and the Rule of Man allowed these former nations wide
lattitude in internal governing structure.

The 3rd Imperium didn\'t capture Earth. It, and the rest of the Old Earth
Union, was peacefully absorbed by the 3rd Imperium in 588. No reason to
suppose that would have been an occasion for internal upheavals.

>More than likely, the "States of Terra" are NorAm, SoAm, NorAf, SoAf, Euro,

Even if these regions were effectively \'super-governments\', they could still
have good reason to preserve their districts as individual entities. Remember
the Soviet Union? It had three votes in the UN through a legal fiction that
made Russia, White Russia and [damn, I forget the third one] independent
nations.

Of course, there\'s no evidence that these super-governments exist.

In 704, actually.

After 1109 Terra\'s newly-established government includes a delegation from
the District of Nepal. I don\'t claim that it is conclusive, but I think that
is pretty damn good evidence that the old nation-states of the 21st Century
still survive, in a somewhat different form, in 1120.

BTW. I don\'t have _Invasion:Earth_. Is there no evidence that bears on this
question to be gleaned there?

Not quite, the BAe 111 was a major commercial success in the 60s
and looked like continuing until the British government pulled the rug
out from under its feet (the actively suggested that potential customers
not buy it!). One can but wonder at the sanity of governments at times.

But we are told that present-day Darrians have genes deribved from the
Solomani immigrants, so it\'s a pretty safe bet that Solomani-Darrian hybrids
are able to pass on their genes.

Ahem. Jon, don\'t you have a copy of _Alien Module 6, Solomani_? Page 3:

"About 300,000 years ago [...] the Ancients landed on Terra and gathered
samples of _Homo sapiens_, carrying them off to their settlements among
the stars. When the Ancients\' civilization collapsed and destroyed itself
in a star-spanning war, some of the humans they had with them survived, 
with each adapting itself to the world it was stranded on, and becoming a
new and distinct SUBspecies [emphasis mine] of _homo sapiens_. There are
currently forty-six known and identified human SUBspecies within explored 
human space."

This follows an explanation of Terran taxonomy which sets out the difference
between species and subspecies, so I think that is pretty conclusive.

>FWIW, I\'ve got something in the draft Solomani Rim book that says that all

>(Of course, the canonical material on the Zhodani *does* use a different

If you\'re referring to GT:AR1, it also claims that the original humans on
Zhdant evolved into two groups: _Homo zhdatl_ (Learning Man) and _Homo 
vlastebr_ (Superior Man). In other words, going by the taxonomic names,
they evolved into two distinct species. Then it states that those two
gruops mingled and created the hybrid _Homo zhodotlas_ (Supreme Man).

Obviously, for Learning Man and Superior Man to be able to mingle and
create Supreme Man, they have to belong to the same species. Maybe not
_Homo sapiens_, but certainly _Homo <something>_. And if they have to
be _Home <something> zhdatl_ and _Homo <something> vlastebr_ why NOT
_Homo sapiens zhdatl_ and _Homo sapiens vlastebr_?

Especially since _Contact: Zhodani_ in JTAS9 states that (p. 8):

"The Zhodani are a discrete, though interfertile sub-species of Homo
sapiens..."

It\'s quite possible that the Zhodani CLAIM that they are a different
(and, of course, superior) species, but if they do, they are talking
through their collective hats (or turbans as the case may be).

Another possibility is that ALL surviving human races are interfertile
(and thus subspecies of _Homo sapiens_) and that consequently the \'sapiens\'
part is usually left out as being redundant. I don\'t like that much,
because I think that goes to far in the opposite direction. A few races
that has evolved (or been genetically altered by an Ancient) to the point
where it is now a distinct species seems very likely. But apparently that
is not the case...

Indo-Australian Plate (which may be splitting at a point under the Indian

we\'re looking at two lots of continental crust (as opposed to oceanic
crust) going head-to-head, and they\'re roughly the same denisty, it\'s sort

Professional sports teams get government MONEY ?????  With *their* salary

The thing about Vilani is that they are _specifically_ mentioned in text
in Vilani & Vargr as being dark skinned. The V&V text on the planet
Vland mentions the type F star as well. Therefore the logical conclusion
[IMNSHO] is that the sector data is in error.

"OK, class, lets get out our copies of V&V & fix
the errors in the sector data now. Yes it\'s OK to
write in the books Bobby but next time please raise
your hand before asking a question. Cross out K8 and
write in F8."

[In GURPS Traveller Loren (or someone) says that Vilani 
come in various colors, IMTU they range from light brown
to dark brown.]

Since most Solomani are not white and Vilani are
a color that would be described by most late 20th
century Americans as "black" and (most) Imperial\'s
are a blending of the two then _obviously_ most
Imperials are not white. Even most characters defined 
as being 100% Solomani will be dark skinned. Being
light skinned tends to be a recessive trait.

[I was playing Traveller once with a Solomani character,
Sigrid Ottawa and I had a picture of her on the back
of the character sheet [snipped from a clothing 
catalog]. When a new player, Chris, joined the group
his character & my character ended up being trapped
together away from the rest of the party [the GM put
us out in the hall] our characters ended up talking.
Chris described his character to me & I showed him
the picture of Sigrid. Chris, who is African American,
was a little surprised that my charecter was "black".
When I explained why she was dark skinned he agreed
that this was made sense. IIRC his character, Anders,
was "white".

IMTU parts of the Imperium noted for having largely
Solomani populations may run as much as 5% "white"
(with most of them looking southern European); but
most of the Imperium is less than 1% white. These 
figures do not, of course, count minor human
races, who come in all sorts of colors, but discuss
only "regular", Solomani-Vilani blend Imperials. 

[Warning Keyboard Alert]
It just occurred to me that Solomani- Vilani blend sounds 
like a brand of coffee beans.

"Here Bob, try some of my new Folgers Imperial Coffee."

"Wow Martha this coffee is so rich and tasty, how does
Folgers do it?"

"Well Bob the secret is in the beans. Folgers uses only
the finest blend of Solomani and Vilani beans. Then they
are fresh roasted to seal in the flavor. You can always
be sure that your Folgers coffee is fresh because each can 
is shipped in it\'s own special low berth to lock in the 
flavor."

[Voice over, preferably by Joe DiMagio] 
"Imperial coffee, where the great taste, starts with the
beans."

RE: Adaptation to dim stars by lightening of skin tones:
Yes this makes perfect sense for minor human races, but
unless their planet has been at low tech levels (no 
vitamin pills) then being white is not really an advantage.
Light skin is a trait that is useful when it is too cold
to expose much skin to the light, the sun is not too
bright anyway, and you need to make sure you get enough vitamin 
D. [Assuming Grandfather did not fix your race so they
know longer needed vitamin D.]

[Scenario - A Vilani scout ship crash lands in Alabama,
[or Roswell, NM perhaps] circa 1950\'s AD, its crew has 
to try & blend in long enough to try & get spare parts....
Ob: X-Files - Obviously the General in Roswell was
from the South and held the racial attitudes that
were prevalent at the time. This is part of the reason
why the Roswell incident was suppress.]

Obviously all Traveller product illustrations were
posed for by professional models. Since "exotic looking" 
models tend to do a little better in attracting attention many
models in the Third Imperium are "white" despite this
being  very atypical of the population as a whole.
If blondes and redheads are very scarce, they may come
to be considered "exotic" and attractive.
Ob20th century - Japan.

Note for evil referee\'s:
[Evil referee\'s isn\'t that like jumbo shrimp, or military 
intelligence.]

Don\'t tell the player\'s that most Imperials are "black".
Make the players describe their charecters looks on
the back of their charecter sheets. Include a line for 
skin tone. Almost all Caucasian players will play "white"
characters. Then simply wait for players to be players and

yes. For preference. Where available.

Until recently (and still, in some places), Rugby in the Arabian Gulf was 
played on sand. which had been soaked with oil and then rolled to keep it 
relatively intact (Grass and the water to keep it irrigated can be 
expensive). THAT\'ll tear you up a bit if you fall over. Fortunately, most of 
the teams that Abu Dhabi (my old club) play have managed to aquire grass 
pitches now (although Dubai only just managed to get their third pitch 
grassed in time for the annual VII\'s tournament)

My copy of Rebellion Sourcebook (MT) has a brown-skinned  man  on
the cover.  Also, p2 of Vilani & Vargr reads ...

    Appearence:  Because our race originally developed  under
    a hot star that stimulates melanin  production  with  its
    ultraviolet radiation output, Vilani skin averages  light
    brown, with skin tones sometimes reaching dark  brown  or
    black.  Hair color ranges from dark brown to black.  Pure
    Vilani have eye colors ranging from gray to gold.

    Vilani tend to have fine facial features, which  includes
    thin lips  and  narrow,  graceful  noses.  The  occipital
    ridges above the eyes tend  to  be  elongated,  sometimes
    imparting  a  sunken-eyed   appearence.   Many   consider
    purebred Vilani women to be quite beautiful, even exotic.

Solomani & Aslan describes Solomani as being in a wide  range  of
colours from black to brown to white, and even red and yellow.

The CT Alien module for Zhodani only describes them as "swarthy".

So the cultural bias (if any) in the bulk of  Trav  illustrations
does not come from the writers but the illustrators.

I use Gravball as the standard sport throughout the Imperium. For details of 
the game try the Missouri Archive at:

http://www.mu.org/~joe/traveller/archive/General/GravBall/

It has rules and examples of play. IMTU each (participating) planet has it\'s 
own league and the winners meet in a subsector final once a year. This 
avoids the travelling problems of playing away games in other systems.

One of my players once played a retired grav ball player. Basically an 
entertainer with Zero-G and athletic skills added.

True -- I\'d forgotten that detail.  And Nepal is one of the out-ot-the-way
places with strong ethnic identity that *might* survive a long time.  I 
suspect
the bigger nation-states are the ones most likely to change radically over
time.

Unfortunately, no.  No political boundaries of any kind drawn on the map,
and only the three starports are labeled.

Not to second guess you or anything, but let me get this straight. Two
characters in *BD* encountered each other in an *engineering access
crawlspace*? And one of them fired an FGMP *several* times?

<sigh>

The ship\'s safety systems should have sealed the crawl and either
filled it full of fire-fighting foam or vented it to space as soon as
the first shot was fired. Either way, the results of the first shot
sould have been much like standing next to a satchel charge. Eggects of
the *second* shot should have been comparable to being inside a *small*
bunker and setting off *several* satchel charges. 

In short, BD or no BD, the other characters should have had to clean
those two out of there with a sponge and a scraper.

Here are a couple of suggestions:

1. Rollerball. Yes, like in the movie...

2. Nullboxing. This is from Steve Barnes\' "Streetlethal" and succeding
   books. It\'s a martial art developed for use in zero g. Being a
   martial arts instructor *and* an SF writer, Barnes did a good job in
   determining what would be needed. 

Basicly, the two fighter enter opposite sides of a plastic sphere and
fight there. Because of the way blows tend to bounce the person making
them almost as bad as the one receiving them, nullboxers throw blows
with high "surge" (ie they aren\'t merely accelerating, the acceleration
is increasing rapidly as the blow travels towards the target. This
makes inertia *help* the blow damage the opponent as the hand, foot,
elbow or whatever applies force faster than the target\'s flesh can
rebound from it.

An example may help. While Aubrey Knight was in prison and pretty far
from his peak condition, a fellow inmate recognized him, and asked for
a souvenir. Aubrey tore a page from a magazine tossed it into the air
and nade a two finger strike on it. He put two holes in the page, in
mid-air withut significantly affecting the paper\'s course thru the air.

That requires both huge amounts of acceleration as his fingers approach
the paper, it requires pulling back at much the same acceleration
(which is why the paper doesn\'t displace much. The air resistance is
too great and the force of too short a duration.)

Basicly, if you are up against an "average" null boxer, you\'d better
be a *master* at a more normal martial art, or you\'d better be well
armed and armored.

If you ever run into Steven Barnes at an SF con, ask him about the
cover for the first edition of "Streetlethal". The protagonist is
*very* Black[1]. This is made *quite* clear in the book.

On the cover he\'s white. The publishers explained that they had
figuresthat "proved" it wouldn\'t sell as well with a black on the
cover. 

The book did well, and in succeeding books in the series, Barnes got to
have Aubrey knisht shown on the cover, as a *black* man (well, more
dark brown, but...)

BTW, *Barnes* is black...

*spoiler warning*.....






















[1] In the most recent book "Firedance" (a few years old now), we find
out that "Aubrey Knight" is actually a "pureblood" *native* African.
Which makes it quite likely that he\'s even *darker* than the way he\'s
drawn on the cover.

Actually I think the Indians the Chinese, If they can get their economies in
better shape will rule space, just becouse of shear numbers.

We may actually build a state of the art cool nifty base on the moon with
artifical gravity etc. but they will just throw up 10 lower tech ones with 20x
as many people. So what if their bases are buried instead of having nifty domes
and they have to bounce around instead have having nifty artifical gravity they
still out number the "U.S./European" bases 20 to 1

On another thought, I remember reading an old Traveller Magazine with, of course
a "space adventure" inside, but the characters portraits were Black, Asian and
Alien (Vargr). But I agree, the view is to highly artist centric.

Actually it *was* a driving movie.  He\'s lost his driving licence
cos he  drove  a  sports car / russian tank / fire engine / front
half of a car / whatever ... recklessly while under the influence
of an undisclosed number of vodka martinis.  And he wasn\'t really
a spy but an unemployed auto-worker from Dagenham  ...  all  that
spy stuff was just  an  alcohol-induced  hulucination  (obveously
getting to shag all  those  women  was  just  a  wish-fulfillment

Okay, just to be fair ... one of my Trav players won 1st place in
the UK M:TG championship and a free ride to the  US  championship
in Seattle (a few years ago).  Mere days before he left he looked
in his atlas and was stunned when he saw where Seattle was ... he
thought it was near New York.

Ah, the spirit of Christmas ... where all good folk  go  out  and
support their local retailer.  To complete  the  ritual:  on  the
25th you over-eat rich food, over-drink, projectile vomit on  the
cat (if you don\'t own a cat borrow a neighbour\'s), and  pass  out
in front of the TV (which will be showing the ever  festive  "The
Great Escape").

Well, it was a _bit_ convoluted. The Air Force was formed primarily as a
strategic bombing force; fighters were there to protect the bombers, and
the MAC air transport wing got sort of thrown in for free. The Navy didn\'t
have anything that could carry a nuke in \'47, so they got to keep their
carrier-based toys.

Just to confuse matters, when helicopters became operational tactical
units they stayed in the Army, as the Cavalry...

The interservice fights are still going on. The Air Force wanted to drop
the A-10 a while back (\'Ground support? what do _we_ need ground support
for?\') and the Army went ballistic and was angling to take over those
aircraft and their mission.

The Air Force backpedaled and retained the A-10 for the time being, just
to retain that \'land-based fixed wing aircraft\' designation, even though,
truthfully, the A-10 is a far better fit with the Army Air Cav, as close
ground support.

The Marines, of course, go their own way and have their own aircraft and
helo\'s.

This is simpler in the OTU, of course, since the Navy Rules All. BUt does
each branch have it\'s own aerospace components?

This also works with hair color and "type". It may just turn out that
since it doesn\'t really provide any disadvantage red or even *blonde*
hair could be predominant in some "races". And yes, even paired with
dark skin. 

So just picture your characters, relaxing because after finally
escaping the fiasco you describe above, they are on a planet where
everybody is "white" like them. But they haven\'t noticed that everyone
is a red-head. 

Or to be more subtle, have it be green eyes. One *glance* at a PC\'s
face and they\'ll know he isn\'t a local. 

And using hi-tech gear like chem sniffers, or low tech ones like
tracking dogs, offworlders are at a *distinct* disadvantage, because
until tjet\'ve been eating local foods as the majority of their food
intake for a week or two, they\'ll *smell* very different from the
natives.

Really? What if he was from Morocco? Or Egypt? I saw a lot of
"pure-blood" Egyptians when I was there (years ago) but I didn\'t
see too many black people... anyway, people equating being African 
with being black really bugs me.

I mean, heck, there are plenty of 5-th generation Africans that
are whiter than I am. Of course, they all speak pseudo-Dutch,
but I\'m sure they\'d consider themselves Africans above everything 
else.

Looking at maps of West & Central Africa, you can find a lot of rivers
with names like Silo, Sidilo, Dilo, etc., all noted down by European
explorers & travellers.  They got the name right from the locals in every
case -- they\'d point at it and ask, what\'s that?  Or, what\'s that called?
And the locals would say, c\'est de l\'eau, or de l\'eau, or c\'est l\'eau.
Since a French-based pidgin was a lingua franca (ha!) for big parts of the
area.

Most governments do, eventually, make such a habit.  Doesn\'t make it right.
It also doesn\'t help to be described as having a \'Rebellious Attitude\' when
one only wants the gov\'t to follow its own laws.

If this be treason, you make the most of it.

ObTrav:  Dulinor saw great weaknesses in the 3I.  He took action that he
thought would be the start of those weaknesses being fixed.  In doing so, he
brought to the surface the true depth of those weaknesses, starting the
destruction that he was seeking to prevent.

Similar geographical dislocations happen between the eastern part of the

or less, here it may be 50 or 70.

At this moment? REM\'s \'Automatic for the People\' while I write. ;-)

As to games - nothing at the moment (we broke for Xmas). Last game 
was \'Feng Sui\' (hangs head in shame), before that Obsidian, before 
that RQ3, and before that Traveller. The last few months have been 
hectic and dropped the time I have for gaming. But that should 
improve...

I\'ve plans for Faded Suns, 7th Sea and Traveller in the new year.

That first edition of Streetlethal must have been painful then.

Of course, as an ersatz defense of the sci-fi industry, I could point out
that there\'s a long history, dating back to the pulp era, of "cover
misrepresentation", which I\'ve always found amusing to some degree. It *has*
been getting better over the last few years, however.

lol

Although I still like "They all died." better.

Did anyone ever read a short story titled _Sign at the Edge of the
Universe_? (If so, do you remember the author\'s name?)

It was 3 words long, printed upside down. It read (you guessed it):

"This end up."

ObTrav: Has anyone else played the computer game "Homeworld?" If you
haven\'t, it\'s a real-time strategy game set in a 3d space environment, the
goal of which (ostensibly) is to reach your long-lost homeworld (but in
reality is to blow up or capture anything that moves).  It\'s not very
Travelleresque -- owing much more to tv sci fi, with fleets of ships within
spitting distance of each other -- but it *is* incredibly fun, gorgeous to
look at, and has a great soundtrack. I tell you, watching a fleet of
cruisers and destroyers open up on each other with their spinal mounts
while a choral version of _Adagio for Strings_ played in the background
nearly brought a tear to my eyes <sniff>. ;-)

Anyway, here\'s the ObTrav part: If you *have* seen the game, what is your
take on the sensor interface for 3d space? Do you see a navigator on a
Traveller starship using something similar, although possibly holographic?
Or would it be much more overwhelming. Personally, I think that the
interfaces would strive to keep information overload to a minimum, but be
customizable so that the navigator could delve for more and more
information by simply pulling down a menu or hitting a hot-key.

Also, how do you envision gunnery stations? A simple mouse-click interface
or the equivalent (click click click! Those Vargr raiders are coming in too
fast!) or a more hands-on joystick model (ooh, gotta adjust for windage!!!).

The last successful invasion was in 1066, without a doubt.

Er, the challenge was so taken up, in Ireland. That\'s a part of what
all this
stuff in Ulster is about (or at least part of the tradition of
troubles). As to
"then-current-regime" - the King was removed by Parliament and
replaced with
someone with better protestant credentials. In the modern sense, the
best
description would be a coup.

btw, Parliament enshrined the principles underlying its actions in a
document
called the Bill of Rights.

I think I\'ve heard this story.  Point-blank high
energy weapon fire just doesn\'t make sense.  The firer
is in his own danger space.  It\'s like using a grenade
launcher at point-blank range (in fact, the grenade of
the M-79 is not armed until enough time after firing
so that it should be several meters away). 

Whatever the rules might say, I as a referee would not
allow point-blank HEW use -- or at least not a second
shot, after the first shot has fried the weapon.

I believe the point was that the target survived point-blank high energy weapons fire, not that the firer survived it.

Well actually I more often eat miso soup (at home) or cranberry bread (at
work).

I am too lactose intolerant to eat cereal with milk and I\'m allergic to
corn which is in most of them.  So when I do find one I can eat, I eat it
out of the box like chips as a snack.

When I taught Freshman History at the University of Kentucky as a TA
seemingly eons ago, I gave a quiz.  I took a blank map of Europe with
country boundaries drawn in but no place names and asked students to find:

London
Paris
Rome
Athens
Istanbul not Constantinople  ^_-

The quiz was worth 10 points.  1 point for getting the city in the right
place and 1 point for getting it in the right COUNTRY.  You\'d be amazed
how many 2\'s and 3\'s I gave.

Then there are all my Japanese ex-BF\'s who came to San Francisco with
nothing but T-shirts, shorts and a single pair of jeans if they were
smart, because "California is hot".  I can\'t complain too much, it was fun
keeping them warm.

As I was reading all three Vargr Alien modules the night before last I

Said "trading fleets" were all organized and controlled by the court.  I
find it hard to see this as an innovation being suppressed as much as a
shift in internal government policy.

Given that the ideology had been circulating for years in student/youth
circles with surprisingly little interference by the authorities, the
Tiananmen crackdown looks like a crackdown on a demonstration and
organizations, not on an idea as such.  The fact that all sorts of
ideologies are floating around in the PRC, some beautifully whacko,
without suppression until they demonstrate organization among their
followers, I think supports that.

"Mulan" is far from the only "individualist" story in Chinese literature;
in most ways, it\'s one of the _least_.  The whole point of the Mulan
ballad and its various adaptations, pre-Disney, was that Mulan
subordinates her personal interests to protect her father, and in the end
turns down opportunity for individual profit & fame.

What is your source for that explanantion of why Disney\'s "Mulan" bombed
in China?  I\'d be genuinely interested to read more about this.

Which leads to the situation where if you  ask  a  politician  if
Britain has a constitution they reply "yes", but ask anyone  else
and they say "no".  Of course its easier for the  politicians  to
change the constitution if its not written down.

I once heard someone argue that Britain was  freer  than  the  US
\'cos in the US you only have the freedoms listed in laws, whereas
in Britain you are free to do anything you want unless there  was
a law proscibing it.  Personally, I don\'t buy it.

The amount of misinformation in the media is astonishing. The days of *real*

stories) are long over.

Nah, my own Christmas Eve ritual involves inviting my dysfunctional friends
over for lots of shrimp, beer and massive injections of violent video games.
This year, our featured video game is Wu Tang, which was formerly called
Thrill Kill and was thought to be entirely too violent to release.

The true spirit of Christmas, in my humble opinion, is best summed up in the
words from Mortal Kombat (which was the first game of this tradition):

"Finish him!"

I\'ll leave it at that.

Non scripta, non est.  You think politicians can twist the meanings of a
written law, wait til you see what they can do to stuff not written down.

You shouldn\'t - he\'s completely backwards.  The US Constitution is written
from the point of view that the People have all rights and powers, and only
certain powers are delegated to the Federal and State governments.


CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES 
Amendments to the Constitution
Article IX.
The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be
construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.

Article X.
The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor
prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or
to the people. 

As opposed to the 3I, where all power resides in the Iridium throne to be
allocated as it see fit - except for the power to dissolve the Imperium,
which is given to the Moot.

Its a nonsense argument.  Within _any_ legal system you are free to take any action that does not violate the law (i.e. you may take any \'legal\' action).  That\'s just a matter of definition.  Of course, the available legal actions can be very limited.  What determines which of two societies is \'freer\' is what actions are legal.

Oh god, Yorkshiremen in space!  "We\'ve bloody misjumped, you daft bugger!"

Or a special combat rule for Yorkshire Travellers, a la Saint Geoff 
Boycott...ignore normal rate of fire, shoot once per hour, roll 8+ to avoid 
hitting another member of your own squad, else hit target for 1 point of 
damage....

This is no surprise at all to Americans.  Why do you
think we kicked your king and soldiers out of here two
hundred some years ago?  Why did we establish a
republic and not a new monarchy?  Because we saw the
future of England, all right -- boiled food and rainy
weather, lining up for the dole and a methadone
injection, butts kicked in wars with people you used
to hire as mercenaries, beautiful cars but they\'re
always in for repairs, Official Secrets Act, Northern
Ireland troubles, and did I mention boiled everything?


We\'ll give you the Rolling Stones and the Beatles,
however.  Those are definitely in your favor.

In Finland many years ago, my aunt Klaara asked my
then-girlfriend how far from her parents she and I
lived.  It wasn\'t the language barrier that led to us
drawing a map to explain "18 hours by train, or a
two-hour flight and a five-hour drive."  Klaara just
needed a while to comprehend that you would still be
in the same country after travelling for so long, or
that anything could really be a five hour drive away
from an airport, or that it would make economic sense
to drive for five hours rather than taking a smaller
plane.  

(The places in question, by the way, were from Idaho
to northwestern Kansas, so it was either Amtrak
through Utah and Colorado into southwestern Nebraska
or fly to Denver and drive down (literally) into
Kansas.)  

This phenomenon isn\'t limited to Europeans.  When I
went back to the east coast for college, I was shocked
at how little many of my classmates (the best and the
brightest) knew about the geography of the United
States, even basic things like whether San Francisco
was west of Chicago or whether Chicago was north of
Texas.  

Ob Traveller:  People do tend to focus on what\'s
important.  While they might know in detail the
arrangement of stars in their subsector, they may not
know much about the next sector over.  There is also
alot more detail to know.  

That statement also applies to us as Traveller
referees and players.  I\'ve played and refereed almost
exclusively in the Spinward Marches, and really don\'t
know that much detail about the rest of known space.

    Australia still has short run ships called "Ninety Miler\'s" that ply the
coast moving incidental cargo. True, they are owned by large companies but a
few years ago one was paid off and then bought by a coalition of Captains
who were recently laid off by the Australian National Line (now defunct,
curse you politicians!)
    They are in fact, much sought after ships as they allow you to be in
port every night, great for family men. My brother is a Master and he and a
few mates had a look at buying the Cape Don, an ex-lighthouse tender, for
hauling cargo around the pacific islands but a case of marriage got in the
way. It would have been an amazing ship for it, she carries a WW2
Shwimmenwagen and a LARC for moving around inshore, very much like a
Traveller vessels "Ships Boats."
    If your interested and in Australia, the Don is tied up at Coffs
Harbour, rusting away.

Okay, I have to share my favorite Canadian jokes now.

#1 - 

Q: How do you get 10 rowdy drunk Canadians out of your swimming pool?

A: Say "Uh, guys, could you get out of the pool please?"

#2 - 

I don\'t know how true this story is, but I\'ve heard that there was some
sort of contest to create a saying for Canada, starting "As Canadian 
as...", that was analogous to "As American as apple pie". The winner? 

"As Canadian as possible under the circumstances."

Oh yes it does, the 1688 Bill of Rights. But it doesn\'t concern the rights of
the citizen versus those of the government. Rather it delineates the powers of
King and Parliament.

Actually, it doesn\'t have a single written constitution, but:

a) a number of laws govern the procedures which underlie Parliament, elections,
etc. Since much of English law is also circumscribed by interpretation and
precedent, even these parts are only half written down.

b) European laws and treaties are moving some way towards a definition
of citizenship. If at some point they start to constrain the procedure (as
opposed to the behaviour) of government, they\'ll be a constitution in all but
name.

The last successful invasion of Britain was the German invasion of the Channel
Islands in 1940, which they held for the rest of WWII. England as a whole has
not been conquered by a foreign power since 1066 (William of Orange
notwithstanding), nor have any of the subsequent British Unions involving
England.

    'body' => 'Since  my exams are over, and there is a race thread on the group, it is time 
for my promised recounting of my best traveller adventure.

Background: The PCs, after discharge in the Marches after the latest war, had 
been approached and recruited by Navy Intel. They were given a beat up far 
trader with drives and a sensor package that looked so-so, but always worked. 
The rest of the ship was in well used shape. The adventures continued, with 
some coming from missions, other they got into on their own. They never 
figured out how their control could get some places before them on muti-jump 
trips [the Imperiallines secret]. I played the universe as having so much 
information available that some important things got lost in the flow. My 
universe featured a wealthy mega corp family, with a Duke as the true head of 
it, considering taking the throne by force. The PCs were enroute to the 
subsector capital when they stopped at a system I had handwaved into 
existence to make a J2 shortcut. The briefing data culled by the computer 
stated that the world was being sponsored by a megacorp [guess which one] in 
their development, and they had gone from tech 9 to high A in only 20 years, 
and they really liked high tech.

The adventure:
I had the human players choose their skin color before they made the world, 
most were white, one asian. The world itself ended up having an asian like 
vast majority, with a small white sub group who had arrived just after the 
long night because of the natural beauty of the planet, this group also wore 
beards and natural products, where the majority preferred a more clean cut, 
imperial fashion look [the landers had originally lived on the south land 
mass, and only in the last 25 or so years had they started moving in response 
to mining needs in the south, the moves were rather forced, but they were 
promised resverations to keep natural in return]. 
The players encountered some problems whenever meeting someone or being on 
the street, unless using or holding tech level A or higher equipment. They 
then intervened the chase of a \'dirty lander\' [lander lover], but were unable 
to save her. the police responded, and at first did not care, then they cared 
when the PCs offered the use of their equipment for investigation. The next 
day the police once again did not care, no matter what. 
The PCs were contacted by some landers, who trusted them a little, as they 
shared skin color on a planet where color meant culture, and since they tried 
to help. The girl had seen something, as had someone else who went into 
hiding. They wanted to know what.
The PCs found her. Along the way there was much pressure from some parties, 
and from the megacorp who was trying to advance the planet, bringing up tech, 
and establishing new plants. It turned out the Landers had been starting to 
protest the tech and mining, and the upcoming elections in which a very-pro 
corp might win. They were also mad that they were losing their restorations 
in the south...
Anti-lander fervor got worse...the PCs discovered the hook was a plot to 
explode a nuclear weapon in the city while the starport\'s grid was down [I 
state that the 3I has heavy dampers at all A-C ports, and most member planets 
are issued the same for their major cities as part of the defense of the 3I] 
during an announced upgrade [which would allow heavy ships to land and new 
ship construction to take place when finished]. The Landers are to be blamed. 
The PCs stop the blast with minutes to spare after a grand chase and 
warehouse crawl. They are media heroes, but the proof that the corp is behind 
it is not there, and the Landers are really hated by all...the people riot, 
and the Landers are hunted.
The corp and new government offer to relo the Landers at another planet 
better suited to their culture, one off of any jump routes. Big ships come 
and go, but the PCs got suspicious...because this relo program took two weeks 
after the bomb adventure. The PCs got into a relo center that was strangely 
empty, with all the personal gone. They got the system to work, from the 
vehicle unloading center, to the vast briefing and waiting area to the 
medical clearance area. They figured out what was going to happen in the med 
area, and avoided the poison. they did activate the robots who stripped the 
bodies of all valuables, and destroyed the bodies and junk by fusion. They 
escaped just as the centers, in remote areas, all went up in small, 
controlled explosions after 90% of the landers, those who did not flee to the 
wilderness areas were relo-ed.

The PCs fled to report to their control at their assigned destination [late] 
and were told that she knew. The rebellion started some months later, and the 
PCs had a front row seat. The 3I won, the evil corp lost, and the group 
switched to AD&D with a new DM.

A lot of artists do not know how to draw black or brown people especially
in B/W or greyscale art.  I have this problem when asking artists to do
illustrations for my stuff because most of the people I like to write
about aren\'t white.  One of the major races of humaniti in my universe
is mostly very dark, skin tones being almost exclusively shades of what\'s
considered "black" in the Western world.  This is actually a lot of
diversity considering that they range from a kind of almost latte color to
very very black indeed, but most of them have rather straight hair and
features that are somewhere in the middle of the black/Asian continuum.
What it is clear that they are not is white.  There are a few people on
their homeworld that can "pass" for white but they live on an isolated
chain of islands and their culture is significantly different from that
which surrounds it so there is little intermarriage.  Even so, most of
those people are that latte color.

I have had very mixed results with people doing art on these characters.
Sometimes people don\'t even read the descriptions and just assume that of
course the dominant characters in any storyline will be white.  In
actuality, two of the main characters in this story ARE mostly white
people of Terran descent, but that is a plot point-- Liuterin, who was
raised amongst these people, is almost instantly identifiable as herself
because she is the ONLY member of her social class to have yellow hair,
naturally white skin, and green eyes, among other traits that make her
unusual.  There is a blond woman on the Islands but her darker skin tone
and the shape of her features is still recognizably Khalanghaari...

argh.

Well, Loren, I for one am glad that you were there in those days to put a
stop to that kind of stuff. I mean, could you imagine the discussion that
would have started now if you hadn\'t been there?

"I\'ve been paging through my Traveller materials and I can\'t find one
picture of a Vilani who isn\'t female and dressed in a thong bikini. In fact,
I can\'t find any picture of a Solomani who isn\'t female and in a thong

Imperium have excellent climate control, or that it\'s just a matter of
artists\' bias.

The war ended (on the British side) because after having dealt with

There was another effect of this - the US got to keep the Louisiana

Napoleon extorted it from the Spanish so he could sell it for cash to 
the US).

The Assyrian records don\'t start until 893BC.

The Minoans were hit by earthquakes and tsunamis about 1400BC, but 
survived. However the Mycenaens invaded (probably in the aftermath of 
the \'quakes) and took over until they dissappeared around 1200BC. 
However the Minoans date from at least 3100 BC, in their earliest form 
(so do the Mycenean greeks), and were probably at their height from 
about 1600BC to 1450BC. The interesting thing about the Minoans is that 
they had no inland fortifications (we don\'t know about their coastal 
areas, as the tsunamis didn\'t leave much) despite having the very 
warlike Myceneans as neighbours. It would appear that they were the 
first naval power in the world.
 
> The Phoenicians might be around. 

The Phoenicians date from the greek dark ages and onwards (as 
independants, otherwise they were active about 1500BC). Say 1200BC

For 1650 BC we have (a rough list):

Egyptians
Minoans
Myceneans
Troy (I don\'t know which number)
China
The Hebrews (they entered Egypt around this time)
The final work at Stonehenge was done around now
I think the Hittites were around as well.

Obviously there are more, but I don\'t know their names.

If that were the case you\'d have expected the US maritime sates to be 
enthusiastic contributors to the war, which they weren\'t. You\'d also 
expect the British to have put a lot of effort into a blockade of the 
North-East US, which they didn\'t. IMO British press-ganging of US 
sailors and high-handed treatment of US shipping, while provoking 
considerable protest and threats, had little to do with the start of 
the 1812 war, or its earlier period. IIRC later the British changed 
their blockade policies, and the US NW became somewhat more involved.

California has some fault sections with slippages measured in mm per year
into the double digits.

Alaska has areas with subduction/uplift  pressures in excess of 1mm per year.

Moraine degradation: Morainal features can be erroded rapidly. Current
rains are more acidic than historic rains, and thus breakdowns can be more
significant.

a 2m raise in sea level will significantly affect the coaslines of florida,
Alaska, the mediterainean, the nile, and certain other areas. In fact,
there is a 1 mile wide, 4 mile long valley near anchorage that has an
elevation of 1m above high tide level; roughly 4m above it\'s low tide
level. It would go from salt-loving grasses to tidal swamp.

Diversion of watercourses occurs suddenly (geologically speaking); one
eruption can create/destroy lakes, as well as landform changes.

on the scale of the _I:E_ maps, only the erosile and explosive events are
likely to show. A major depression faulting event in siberia COULD result
in forming Lake Siberia. Likewise, the circular depression faulting in the
midwest US could do likewise. Hawaii will have a new island in about 1000
years: loihi. in 3500 years, that island should be fairly big, and many of
the hawaiian islands will have differing shapes.

FS has a nice (if dark) background. Like 40K, religion has pervasively
invaded society. The rules look nice enough. The expansions are a fun read.
I\'ve not had the oportunity to run it. I\'d call it a cross between Dune and

whatever you use, once you start swinging, keep swinging until security or
the police remove the object being swung; better still, take a few swings
with enpty hands as though you still had your implement. Makes a temporary
insanity defense much easier if you show signs of being totally focussed
upon a single target to the exclusion of reality.

And, just to be ornery, you might want to sing "Singing in the rain" while
attacking. ;)

Based upon the rules of TNE, even using the "D10\'s for Damage" fix, going
through Combat Armor 14, the fragments don\'t penetrate, and the main hit
wasn\'t enough to knock out the buff Vargr PC, simply due to the way PC\'s
take damage.

He took 5 hits from an FGMP 14. Spread amongst legs, tail, and abdomen.

He kicked the Zho in the head, repeatedly. The Zho died from the following
factors: double damage on head shots
	Blunt trauma (One can only assume his head got rocked against
		his helmet one time too often)
	Single damage track for all locations for NPC\'s.

Also, I don\'t think 1-2 cc\'s of plasma are going to be equivalent to a
satchel charge. Simply due to transference of heat speeds.

In any case, it was that very incident that poisoned me on the "Realism" of
TNE (i.e.: TNE LACKS any realism). I liked 2tK 1st ed, but not 2nd ed...
similar reasons.

Can they Jump? Yes? then a kick along the axis of the body, rather than to
the front, will have good force. And hobnailed boots don\'t hurt. The only
reason a Vargr can\'t kick effectively is that the leg bends wrong for a
swinging kick; they would do just fine when effectively Stomping the target

The same thing happens in fantasy novels, too. In many cases, the cover art
doesn\'t even seem related to the story.

Having just boorowed (to re-read) The Dragonlance Chronicles, on Book 1\'s
cover, goldmoon (With the blue crystal staff) is a red-head, not a blonde
as the book clearly points out. Also, the BCS is not blue except when
working it\'s powers... even though she\'s leaning on it on the cover illo,
and it\'s blue all the way down.

Cover art is merely a tool to grab the interest of the prospective buyer;
once they buy the book, few people will return it simply because the cover
art doesn\'t match.

Besides, reading of Sci-Fi and Fantasy does tend (in the US) to be more of
a white and oriental thing; the average black male in america is far less
educated than the average white male, based upon highest level completed.
The average black male is far more likely to come from impoverished areas
than the average white male. Having worked for a Gentleman of color who is
very well educated (MA from a brittish university, former Royal Navy
signalman), elloquent, and well versed outside his field of expertise; he
is one of the very few black men I\'ve known to like SciFi. (He doesn\'t read
Fantasy, tho.) Reading choices are a factor of environment, education, and
socialization. Gaming choices likewise.

It used to be explained that the dearth of non-white RPG\'ers was due to the
rise of RPG\'s in colleges, and the relative dearth of non-whites in
colleges. I think it has more to do with socio-economic factors in
childhood environments than college attendance; especially since RPG\'s have
now become fairly common in high-schools, when not otherwise prohibited.

Not really. The _I:E_ rules are sadly lacking in color/fill text. Really

urbanization regions. The Hawaiian Islands show urbaizarion well out beyond

I doubt there is a continuity there. For example, Egypt, which was nation
3-5000 years ago, is a nation now; for well over 100 years it was NOT a
nation. Only China has survived 5000 years with a clear national identity.

The only reason a region such as nepal would remain a single entity would
be that such an area is culturally, geographically, and politcally isolated.

IIRC, the Channel Islands are not part of Britain any more than Gibraltar or
the Falklands are.  They\'re separate Crown Dependencies, and the last part
of the Duchy of Normandy still held by the crown.  Part of the *British
Empire* at the time, but not Britain (or even the UK). And any way, we got
them back. As the original thread was comparing Britain & Japan as distinct
island nations with a long tradition of continuous nationhood, you could
just as well point to the invasion of Okinawa in WWII by the Americans as
being analagous to the Channel Islands under Germany.

Hmmm, in my yet-to-be-written designers notes for Tavonni, you\'ll probably see:

- - Count Leto Khaanraarshuinki was Duke Leto Atreides in the original campaign;
- - similarly, Mikhail B. Powell, owner of Lone Scout Enterprises, was originally
just "Baden-Powell", a Scout;
- - Ben Cade was named off his UPP, 9BECDE;
- - Beowulf Heyerdahl, Menelvagor\'s founder, was named after (a) the front cover
of the original black boxed set, and (b) Thor Heyerdahl, the great modern-day
Norwegian adventurer/explorer (ie traveller! ;-) who explored Easter Island and
rafted across the Atlantic on weeds, thus making Beowulf the ultimate traveller;
- - Caradoc LIC, the main company on Tavonni, was taken from an SF book. In
real-life, the player is a contract programmer, whose company is registered as
"Caradoc LIC";
- - Menelvagor Ltd, a company founded by a Sword Worlder, is taken from the
*hobbit\'s* name for the constellation of Orion, the "Swordsman of the Sky";
- - Tavonni System Control (TSC) is called that because the author (me) went to
The Scots College (TSC), Sydney;
- - the initials of the Main World Survey & Development Board (MWS&DB) may be
recognisable to old Sydney-siders (Metropolitan Water, Sewerage & Drainage
Board);
- - the island with the starport, Bjornoya (with dots above the "o\'s") is Bear
Island (look for it Nth of Norway);
- - the _Bonaventure_, Menelvagor\'s flagship, is based on the first interstellar
warp-drive ship created by ST\'s Cochrane (no, _not_ the one in the film) - I
took the design from the old Star Fleet spacecraft chronology;
- - for Niven fans, the derivation of Tavonni Safari Park (TASP) should be obvious
- - it\'s where you go to have a good time;
- - when one of our players came up with names like "The Peanuts", "Chips",
"Martini", "Vermouth", "The Ice-Cubes", Scotch" and its moon, "The Rock", we
concluded that the Tavonni system was named by a Scout team after a really wild
party;
- - but the 1% inspiration hit me when I decided that a _Vargr_ owned the
long-haul grav-bus company, "G-Hound"!!!

...and "The Taking of Bloor-Danforth 123" - excuse me, the
_remake_ of "The Taking of Pelham 123" - was shot in Toronto\'s
subway system.  There were three reasons why it couldn\'t be shot

    The cost of the permits from the City of New York
    The cost of union labor
    The cost of the indemnity that the MTA wanted.

Trust me, the original (with Walter Matthau) was far better, and
far more authentic.

That sounds way too cool.  If we all chipped in, could
we put together enough to buy and maintain her?  Or,
put another way, how much would each of us have to put
up?  Then we could go visit during our vacations, like
a time share.

Well, let\'s not forget the Argentine invasion of the
Falkland Islands, which I understand are treated as an
integral part of Britain, just like the Orkneys and
Channel Islands.  

That the invasion was not successful can be credited
- -- as usual -- to the United States.  They\'d still be
speaking Spanish in the Falklands if the United States
hadn\'t violated its treaty obligations to Argentina
and its own Monroe Doctrine to supply the British with
intelligence in the form of intercepted communications
and space imaging.

Sorry, I was trying to avoid giving too much away. But he\'s
*definitely* from the black-skinned part of the continent. Way south of
the equator. And from a "native tribe" that\'s been there a lot loner
than thoose white skinned folks you refer to. 

I only referenced "pureblood" to emphasize the fact that he was going
to be the typical dark brown/black of most tribes in that area, not the
lighter browns you see in "mixed-race"(sic) ancestry.

Forwards? I tend to agree. But *backwards* is a whole different story.
Being digigrade[1], rather than plantigrade[2], Vargr are likely to be
able to kick well *behind* themselves, and also do *nasty* "belly
rakes" to someone they\'ve grappled with.

[1] walking with only the toes and "toe pad" on the ground, and what
    would be the rest of the foot on a human bein a long set of bones
    leading up to a hock(?) which is the joint that\'s the heel & ankle
    on humans.

[2] Walking with those bones on the ground, and the hock(?) being an
    ankle. 

Note. If you ever try to "walk digigrade" keep in mind that it is *not*
done like a human on tip-toe. Instead, both the ankle *and* the knee
are kept bent. This keeps the center of gravity over the ground contact
points, but results in a *very* different gait. Sort of a "glide". Even
without make-up, you look quite non-human.

It\'s a strain for humans to walk this way for long. I can\'t even do it
since I gained some weight. My ankles aren\'t up to it, and my knees
aren\'t real happy either. 

Anyway, if you try, you\'ll probably *know* when you get it right
because all of a sudden it\'s *easier* to move than in any other posture
except our "normal" one.

I consider Tom Lehrer songs to be traditional tunes.

Well, maybe it\'s a bit 40k in so much as 40k is a rip off of Dune 
with Chaos Spikey bits.

It\'s the nearest thing to a Dune like setting I\'ve seen. The scope 
for politicking looks great, but I\'ve got to work out how to start 
the scenario off. I like it - the system looks interesting; the 
downside is that it verges a little on fantasy with the apparent 
working of Psi or magic. *But* it\'s got a great setting - if you want 
a feel, pick up the short story book \'The Sinful Stars\' which gives a 
good flavour of how the game is meant to be. Leisure had it for £9.99 
a while ago... I like it enough to have bought most of the 
supplements (I did get a good deal at GenCon though £4 each!)

I used to be involved in activities on the Miami River, Miami, Florida USA.
You would not believe the condition of some of the "tramp freighters" there
a few years before the "port rules" were tightened.   These vessels ply
between the river and various minor    ports in Haiti, the Dominican
Republic and who knows where.  You can see them on the river today loaded
down with "used" bicycles, "used" cars,old mattresses and stacks of lawn
chairs piled into every nook and cranny.  All the old wooden hulls are
pretty much gone now,  but the steel hulls usually have a name set in the
steel plate of stern and bow painted out and a new "nom du merchant"
emblazoned in paint.   I picture free traders on their last legs plying out
of such backwater ports hauling cast off from one world to a second hand but
appreciative market on another.   By the way no one in Miami ever expects to
get a stolen bike back one look at the huge piles loaded on the such vessels
is enough to discourage anyone.

Many worlds IMTU have laws requiring duelists (including
gladiators) to sign a "Declaration of Intent to Self
Terminate" before committing suicide.  Entering a duel
or gladiatorial "game" is considered to be a form of
suicide.  On those worlds, failure to file such a
declaration means that the winner faces murder (or at
least sentientslaughter) charges, so both parties (or thier
"handlers") insist on seeing the declaration before the
games begin.

Races are also a popular form of entertainment.  IMTU,
people will race just about anything.  The poni are always
popular.  They also race beds, land scooners and on
foot on land.  In water, tubs (like you take a bath in),
power boats, sailing vessels and swimming (usually
dominated by the Delphi if no divisions are made) are
usually well attended.  In the air everything that floats or
flies is raced somewhere often with mandatory
maneuvers (you know, rolls, wing-overs, Immalmans,
etc.).  And of course in space, sailing (mag as well as
"solar") formula racing (e.g. using standard engines,
tweaked to within mm of distruction and in the lightest
possible hulls often barely or even not spaceworthy
otherwise).

There was also an American by the name of James (his
first name escapes me just now, it might have been
Henry) who built the only profitable trans-continental
railroad (Pacific Northern, IIRC) all by himself without
government subsidies.  After running rail from coast to
coast, Mr. James started building a fleet to trade with
China.  Just as he was getting his shipping line profitable,
the US gov. stepped in and declaired it to be a monopoly.
He sold off his ships and retired on the profit.  Who knows
what might have happened if the gov. goons had left him
alone?

Chinese."

Be durned if he wasn\'t right.  Notice how little has
changed under the "Communists" today.  It seems every
day China gets more and more like it has traditionally
been.  I guess that China is a good example of just what
"cultural inertia" really means.

I grew up in Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri and while I
cannot recall ever hearing of a male mule impregnating a
female mule (or any other critter for that matter), I have
seen foals born alive to female mules sired by both
jackasses and stallions.  Come to think of it, I don\'t
remember ever having been around a male mule, I\'m not
even sure there is such a critter.

___________________________________________
I got curious and decided to see what the MS Encarta
had to say on the topic.  There\'s not much, so I\'ll just
quote the whole article:
>>>>>>
Mule, hybrid offspring of the jackass (male ass) and the
mare, much used and valued in many parts of the world
as a beast of burden. The head, ears, croup, and tail
resemble those of the ass, but in bulk and stature the
mule resembles the horse, and seems to excel both its
parents in sagacity, muscular endurance, surefootedness,
and length of life. The hinny is the hybrid offspring of the
jenny (female ass) and the stallion (male horse). It has a
bushier tail and a heavier body than the mule and is by
nature a more tractable animal.

Male mules are generally sterile, but sterility is not a
necessary consequence of hybridization. Female mules
have been successfully crossed with horses or asses to
produce foals.

Hmm, I guess there _are_ male mules.  I remind me of a
rube who upon first visiting a zoo and seeing a giraffe is
heard to exclaim, "There ain\'t no sech animal!"

Canonically speaking, everything I have ever read says
that a Jump Capable Craft must be at least 1400 cubic
meters in size.  I wouldn\'t doubt that you could build one
that only masses 55 tonnes (or even 55 short tons), but
even back in the first edition of CT, canon has always
been a 1400 cubic meter minimum for Jump Capable
Craft.

IMTU, IT&T can build a jump capable lifeboat.  They
only require something like 147 cubic meters to store
them but they are trey expensivo.

If you want to know how that is possible, check out
my current THUDDD design:
http://thuddd10.homepage.com
Of course, this one is not jump capable, but the same
principles apply.

The problem is that if you eliminate the possibility of
private ownership of weapons, then the responsibility of
guarding the populace would fall on the sholders of the
LEOs and the US Supreme Court has ruled loud and
clear that cops do NOT have such a responsibility.

Now that you mention it, I did notice a similar attitude
while I was in the US Southeast last year (\'98).

So tell me Eris, did you mean that gun control is (or at
least should be) the responsibility of the gun owner (or
holder as the case may be)?  ;-)

Actually, the game with body armour uses a ball some-
what different from that used in rugby.  It\'s somewhat
more pointy and therefore rolls somewhat more
eratically.

I have been known to.  Very often if they do get them,
they serve as important clues.  I have had groups chase
after the elusive Crimson Clupeidae or the Scarlet
AleWife for months, even years (of game time).

That\'s good, because most of the "laws" (I put that in
quotes, because they are not really laws, only codes) in
America would be patently illegal (contrary to the the uS
Constitution) were it not for the Supreme Courts\'
decisions that in said codes (the "law") words like "shall"
and "must" can mean "may" in order to avoid
unconstitutionality of the code in question.  The Bill of
Rights of the uS Constitution specifically reserves all
rights not specified to the people or the several states.

To the person that knows this, most of the codes simply
do not apply.  You have to defend your rights; however,
when has that not been true?

If you study The War of Northern Agression (commonly
called the American Civil War), you will find that the root
cause was just this and not primarily "slavery" per se.
The slavery issue was just what the spin doctors wanted
everyone focused on.

Somehow, I doubt those vehicles are worth 20-30 million dollars each.

There\'s also a reasonable \'tramp\' trade in trucking; a lot of truckers own their own rigs.  That\'s probably the closest modern equivalent to a Traveller free trader, though again, a semi-truck is a whole lot less expensive than a traveller starship (its still a pretty major investment, however).

You understand wrong. The Falklands are a Dependent Territory with their own
government. The Channel Islands are actually part of the (defunct) Duchy of
Normandy, and the Queen\'s authority derives from that title. The Channel
Islands has its own government (actually two, since it\'s divided into Jersey
and Guernsey). Unlike the Falklands, it is considered part of the EU, at least
for trade. And unlike the Falklands, they\'re part of the British Isles.

Orkney is an integral part of Scotland and the UK - part of local government,
members in the UK and Scottish parliaments, etc.

I doubt it, though it might have been more difficult to retake the islands. If
the US had actively opposed the British action as they did in Suez that would
have been a different matter.

My take is that the Army has COAC units, plus the occasional
"interplanetary" transport. For example, they\'d *definitely have their
own transport for getting betweem Terra and Luna. Ditto for getting
between Regina and the other moons of that gas giant. 

They *might* have ships capable of moving between planets in systems
where there are significant populations (or resources!) on other
planets in the system. And they\'d *definitely* have them in systems
where the mainworld (or any significant world) is a "belt".

They likely get into arguments with the Navy about the stuff that\'s
capable of crossing significant fractions of an AU, staying in space
for weeks, and *especially* any such that have ship-to-ship weaponry. 

The Army will usually win by pointing out that since they can\'t count
on being able to have the Navy take them with them when the Navy
decides to bug out (pardon me, "execute a strategic withdrawal"), they
need the non-jump ships just to be able to mover their troops around
the system, especially to consolidate them if the system has that big
an enemy presence. 

The marines have ground support craft (COACC, except from orbit *down*,
instead of the ground *up* :-)

And the navy probably isn\'t interested in "lunar shuttle" type
spaceships, nor ground-to-orbit craft. So they\'ll have interplanetary
ships and starships. 

There\'s still stuff to argue about. But I think the above balances
needs against "turf" reasonably well. 

And it means that there are niches for weird things like the small
armed "tramp" freighter that belongs to the Imperial Army and is used
for commando insertions and various small supply runs that the Navy
can\'t be bothered with. 

Likewise, the navy has some COAC type vehicles that *they* use for
various things. 

In both cases the services "ignore" these "violations" as long as they
are kept low key and don\'t seem to be a trend.

Not all cago ships are owned by big multi-nationals. There are still
small independents out there. Mostly operating between smaller ports
with irregular (ie non-scheduled) cargoes.

Until someone *invents* artifical gravity, *everyone* will have to
settle for the normal gravity (1.62 m/s^2, about 16.5% of Earth\'s,
about 16.2% of the Traveller 10 m/s^2 "g").

And *nobody* is going to build "domes". Not with anything remotely
resembling current tech. Doing so is suicidal. First, and foremost,
because you *need* several *meters* of "dirt" above you to stop
radiation from things like solar flares. On earth, we\'ve got a thick
atmosphere, and in *low* earth orbit, we are below the "radiation
belts" where the charged particles from solar flares are trapped by
Earth\'s *very* strong magnetic field. Luna has neither atmosphere nor
magnetic field.

You also want that dirt as *thermal* insulation. Surface temps on the
moon "only" change over a range of about 300 C during the course of a
"month" (local day). 

And finally, it provides protection against the occasional meteor. The
odds of getting hit by anything big enough to cause even a slow leak
are small. Yet we\'ve had *two* much bigger rocks hit houses in the
*same town* in the last 10-15 years. So the precaution is a good idea.

The *serious* designs I\'ve seen for lunar bases all use a prefab "hut"
built much like a Qounset hut. Most figure that you\'ll scrape the
regolith (lunar "dirt") away until you hit more or less bare rock (1 to
6 inches of regolith, most likely. But don\'t quote me on that. :-).
Then you build the hut and dump all that regolith back on top, plus
more scraped from a wide area around it. 

The other design is based on the assumption that there *has* been
significant volcanic activity on the moon. They are hoping to locate
some lava tubes. If such are located, this would give you pre-made
"tunnels" several meters across (up to at least 10). go inside a ways,
brace any weak spots, and set up the huts there. You\'ll have *meters*
of rock overhead, and all without digging. 

It\'ll be a long time before we are up to doing much digging into lunar
rock, thus these are the choices.

BTW, the Young Astronauts program, working with the L-5 society started
work on a "test" base in some lava tubes in southern Oregon. As far as
I know, even though the "L5 Society" part of the partnership has
changed names over the years as various pro-space groups merged, it\'s
still there and they still try ideas out.

No, No, I\'m sure that everyone here is in this for the purest of

No I wouldn\'t. I love maps, and I\'m used to discovering that people
don\'t even know where things in the US are. 

There\'s a type of painting that several magazines (New Yorker, for one)
sell. It\'s a *highly* distorted map (the scale is logarithmic or
worse). 

For example, the one from the New Yorker shows Mahattan and the various
buroughs. By this point you are 1/4 to 1/3 of the way across the map.
Then it shows New Jersey and the rest of new york state. And crammed
into the last few inches are the Midwest and the West Coast....

It\'s accurate in that it *perfectly* displays the *perceptions* of many
people.

It\'s a good thing Russia isn\'t a popular destination for that sort of
tourist. Consider the hop from St. Petersburg to, say, the Caspian.
Then the hop to Vladivostok. From there, it\'d be shorter to go back to
England by flying the rest of the way around the world!.

The US *is* big. But Russia is *huge*. The main part of the US is 4
time zones across. Russia is *nine*. Maybe more, I\'d have to check.

Under CT, it is 16d, halved at VL, and quartered at Extreme.
The PGMP-14 does 12.
Under MT, damage of PGMP\'s and FGMP\'s seems to equal the TL. Pen Climbs

Under TNE, according to the Mk1 Md1 (Not the rulebook in force when I ran

The railroads paid a pittance for their rights of way. Sure, individuals
could homestead for nothing, but even the railroads recieved indirect
subsidy, inthe form of negligible land-costs, little to no taxation, etc.

As for his "Monopoly", it would probably have made a tidy profit.
Monopolies are not technically illegal in the US... they are only illegal
when they prevent the rise of competition by unfair buisiness practice. For
a *LONG*time, US Steel Corporation was a monopoly, due to the lack of any
desire for doing buisiness with smaller suppliers. Likewise, IBM had a
monopoly on Miniframes for a while. Not a problem, since IBM didn\'t try to
prevent other companies from creating/selling  miniframes.

Until after the American Revolution it was British practice to employ 
German mercenaries to do their fighting for them. A number of german 
princes supported their lifestyles by hiring out their subject to die 
for the brits.

The problem is that if you eliminate the possibility of
private ownership of weapons, then the responsibility of
guarding the populace would fall on the sholders of the
LEOs and the US Supreme Court has ruled loud and
clear that cops do NOT have such a responsibility.

By guarding the populace, do you mean "preventing them from escaping" or

The "Mageworlds" books have an interesting bit. One side uses 3d "tank"
type displays. Symbols, text boxes that can be pulled up, etc.

The other uses "surround" displays, with "glyphs" as the
representations. Color-coding for some info, gylph details for others
(think "chinese characters"). By "surround", I mean that you stand in
the middle, and are surrounded by a seamless array of displays.

It\'s noted that the "tank" displays tend to make commanders "detached"
from their units because they are "looking in from outside", while the
"surround" displays make the commanders a bit *too* involved because
they are "in the center, looking out".

While "tank" type displays are what most folks think of, "surround"
displays are buildable *now* (though they\'d be expensive). 

As for "interface", keep in mind that while it hasn\'t reached consumer
gear yet, "heads up" displays mounted to project into your eyes an uses
simple IR sensors to pinpoint what part of the image you are looking
at. That\'s the "cursor". With a few buttons you can do zoom, select for
exanded info display, etc.

Kenji, are you *volunteering* to be a test subject for some of these
"possibilities"? Say the one involving removal of certain organs
("Don\'t worry, we can replace them later. If you give us good enough
reasons."). Or how about about the one where we relocate certain organs
to an "inconvenient" location ("well this way it won\'t be distracting
you as much....")?

Playing "Mad Scientist" is *fun*... at least as long as you aren\'t too
attached to your victims^H^H^H^H^H^H^Hsubjects.

Sometimes this is because the cover artist never sees the book in question. 
Sometimes they get the manuscript to work from, and read it, and pay

Until after the American Revolution it was British practice to employ
German mercenaries to do their fighting for them. A number of german
princes supported their lifestyles by hiring out their subject to die
for the brits.

And how many wars with the Germans have we lost? (to me, "getting our butts
kicked" implies losing...)

I don\'t know if this is true or a fable, but it is interesting if it is true:

When the Communists finally took over, the renamed the Manchu (I\'m working 
from memory here, so don\'t jump all over me if it\'s wrong) gate the People\'s 
gate. The workmen who took down the old brass plate with the name on it 
decided that this people\'s stuff might not last, to they decided to take the 
plate up into the "attic" of the gate, just in case it was needed again soon. 
They found a similar plate carved with the name of the previous dynasty, 
indicating the workmen of a couple of centuries ago had similar thoughts.

Like I said, maybe a legend, but interesting if true.

The reason the US established a republic and
not a monarchy is that George Washington said
no, or more accurately "NO!!",  when they asked 
him to be the King of America. 

So then when they wrote the office of President
us _everyone_ at the Constitutional Convention
knew that Washington was going to be the first 
President (and would stay President as long as he
felt like running for re-election, no term limits back
then). It is fairly clear if you read the notes of the
delegates to the convention that when they wrote up the
Presidency they all knew who it was going to be.
The President is the Commander in Chief of the armed
forces in the US, not merely because someone has to be,
but because the office was written up for General
George Washington.

I suggest that you read the constitution of the lat USSR. You\'ll find
that it and the laws derived from it support freedom of speech, freedom
of the press, etc, and generally read like a *better* deal than y\\the
US consitution.

The trick is that the goverment freely punished actions that were quite
*legal*. 

Anybody making the mistake of thinking that "legal" means "you can do
it and not get in trouble with the government" is in for a *big* shock

That\'s not an invasion of Britain. That\'s an invasion of a very small part

        Well, in my TNEC milieu its all touch-screens, ICONS and
XWindows....  from a short story I *cannot* seem to finish:  "The computer
chirped at him, suddenly displaying a whirlpool icon on the long-range
screen. He looked at it, almost incredulously for a moment. He tapped the
icon, and then tapped the "CLASSIFY" option on the menu that appeared. A
window opened, and filled with information. He skimmed it, blinked, and
tapped through the sequence of pop-up menus on the own-ship status screen:
"ALERT STATUS- CHANGE- CONDITION AMBER- ALARM"...." 

        Gunnery in TNEC (in millieu-modern ships, anyway), is the same
thing....  the gunners are in an Ops room, they tap the contact, change
status to hostile from the drop down menu, pick the own ship menu, select
the weapon and fire-plan, and designate the target with a tap on the
screen...  the computer plots the solution and requests confirmation of fire
authorization, and then procedes to beat the tar out of the target until the
gunner tells it to stop or the target disappears from sensors.

2) Naval fleet politics: changes in status of naval officers

    'body' => 'With the various kinds of societies, it is difficult to know how
societies will interact with one another or respond to social
pressures. As a guide to predicting how societies or NPC groups
of any kind are likely to behave in social situations, I would
like to suggest a Universal Social Interaction Profile (USIP).


This has seven independent characteristics, with the distribution
of possibilities following the same 2d6 as the UPP in most
versions of Traveller.

1) Cohesiveness
2) Tolerance
3) Flexibility
4) Hedonism
5) Generosity
6) Honor
7) Violence

Cohesiveness.
This and individuality might be considered opposites. An extreme
low cohesion score indicates that all individuals are solitary. 
If groups do form, they are of short duration. A high cohesion
indicates the tendency to form groups to the extent that
individuals mean nothing to the group.

Alien tolerance
This has to do with how much physical or mental differences are
important to the society. A society with low alien tolerance is
xenophobic: Even trivial differences assume great significance. A
society with high alien tolerance will, for example, treat all
sentient beings as equals, without regard to appearance and
little regard to behavior. There are no "us-them" distinctions.  

Flexibility
This has to do with how well new ideas and behaviors are accepted
by the group. A very low flexibility is rigid and unchanging,
often with a strong caste or hierarchical structure. A highly
flexible society is so highly tolerant of change that social
structure is temporary and transient, and fads and fashions are
common.

Hedonism
This has to do with the pursuit of pleasure. A society with
extreme low hedonism tends to be ascetic and self-denying, and
endurance or acceptance of pain and suffering. A society with
extreme high hedonism tends to seek pleasure, both physical and
mental, as the highest good.

Generosity
This has to do with material acquisitiveness. A society with
extreme low generosity is miserly and greedy: If possible, the
society will take anything they can and give nothing. A society
with high generosity is so openhanded that they will give
anything to anyone on request. A society with average generosity
will have equal or fair exchange as a value.

Honor
This has to do with trustworthiness. A society with low honor
cannot be trusted, either to tell the truth or keep any promises
that are made. A society with high honor will never decieve or
mislead, and will regard promises as inviolable. A society with
average honor will be mostly relable, but with frequent lapses.
This includes also the degree of voluntary compliance with laws.

Violence
This has to do with willingness to use physical violence to
accomplish the society\'s ends. A society with low violence is
completely pacifistic: one with high violence sees nothing wrong
with killing at the slightest provocation. A society with average
violence tends toward tit-for-tat behavior most of the time.

Some examples:

5B64A54
This society tends to be fragmented, but so exceptionally tolerant
of differences that it is one of the prime virtues of the
society. Groups are more likely to split into factions that
respect each other\'s differences than to enforce conformity. This
is a somewhat difficult, painful process, since flexibility is on
the low side. The society leans heavily toward the ascetic and
self-denying. People are exceptionally generous and openhanded: You may
not like your neigbhor, but you won\'t let him starve. Theft is
quite low, but there is a strong reliance on polite lies and
fictions to smooth over social differences. Overall, there is a
tendency for polite, highly complex social games, with high
esteem expressed for "respected colleagues". These more often
result in division and rearrangment of social factions that in
violence, but it is not unknown.

8467758
This society is fairly cohesive, with unity stressed slightly
over individualism. There is a marked tendency to an us-versus-
them mentality, so social conflicts tend to become polarized.
Flexibility is on the low side: so adjustments are somewhat
difficult, but not unreasonably so. Hedonism is about average for
human society: some but not excessive pleasure seeking is
encouraged. Generosity is about human average, and the ideal is
an emphasis on fair trade; but practice is about balanced between
generous giving and theft or fraud. Honor is on the low side: In
this society, it manifests itself in a tendency to make treaties
and contracts and then disregard them. There is some tendency for
disputes to be resolved violently, but the cohesive, structured,
polarized tendencies of society mean that it is more organized,
large-scale warfare; more gang than individual, although smaller
scale violence is not unknown.

My Impressions of the "normal" or average for societies in the
major races would be:
Human     7777777
Vargr     5797777
Aslan     8656699

Agreed, startup costs are substantially higher than the Wright

the probable Return on Investment.

A vehicle the size of the shuttle was too much of a technological
leap. If NASA had been able to start a reusable vehicle program
with something the scale of the Mercury program 25 years ago,
something the size of the shuttle might be practical by now. As
it is, NASA is married to a troll. Besides, although SSTO is an
elegant idea, I\'d back a 2-stage or variant that is fully
reusable over an SSTO that isn\'t.

The handful of companies out of a couple of dozen wannabes
(besides the ones partnering with NASA on the X-33, X-34, etc.)
that have managed to scrape up partial financing and do some
testing are talking $100 million or less and two or three years
for a suborbital prototype.  But if they don\'t get enough money
to to build their vehicles and try them out, no one will ever
know whether they would have worked or not.  As it is, the
engineering is reportedly easy compared to the financing.

Desmond had planned to retire anyway after TWINE. The John Cleese character
was to replace him in his retirement.

I\'m the suspicious type. I\'d look either of those up as soon as I got
the chance. 

BTW, one of the *prime* rules for new GMs. 

If the players jump to a conclusion, or assume something as fact that
*wasn\'t* part of what you\'ve told them, *DON\'T* correct them!

Not only do they deserve the chance to learn not to make such mistakes,
but watching them in the process can be highly amusing. :-)

        Hi, Leonard!

        I always presumed that any Vargr martial-art or unarmed combat
techniques would be delivered as a cross between Capeoria (leap - hand-stand

POUND - POUND - POUND....) depending what range the target was at when the

        Actually, Hopkido is a ground-fighting style...  the leaps are
*lateral*, more a flying tackle than anything.  Which would work well in a
crawl-space for a Vargr because of the way the leg physiology is arranged...
Just because the *potential* for Capeoira-like attacks are there doesn\'t
mean they would be used all the time...  some things only work if your
opponent is obliging about it.  =)

    I\'ll ask him when he get\'s back from Singapore (after Christmas, :
 ,don\'t let your kids go to sea. He\'s missed his kids getting born, my
wedding and umpteen other things.) but I don\'t hold out a lot of hope, she\'s
been there since he got married and that\'s been six years, a ship not cared
for degrades alarmingly.
    You would be amazed what ships are lying out there, looking for an
owner. Ex-military ships go for a song but they are not built as sturdily as
a merchant unless they are something like a landing craft. I\'m writing a
scenario about this but it\'s not going to happen until I can find a decent
program to do deck plans on (I generally use AutoCAD but it looks crappy
when translated to .jpg on my website). Also, the trend for cargo boats is
not more ships but more capacity and the little guys get left tied up to the
wharf. I\'m sure there\'s a lot of free traders in parking orbits just rotting
or decompressed because the company has bought a larger vessel and can\'t
afford to run the old clunker.
    Why don\'t you do the Twilight 2000 method? Assign a wear value of
between 1 to 10 (I think TNE does this) 1 being pristine and 10 being
clapped out. Then to find the value of the ship is :
(price of ship new / wear value)
    and every time there is an event (a jump, a battle, a reentry etc) you
must roll under the wear value to avoid a component breakdown. If a
component breakdown occurs the engineer must roll for a repair, probably as
your burning up on reentry, if he\'s successful the component is good for
another event and if s/he fails it\'s busted and needs a renew or repair.
Repair cost\'s the book price +10% for installation for that part and a
repair costs 50% of the book price but adds 1 to the components wear value.
S/he can avoid all this by doing twice the maintenance which would probably
be the (Jump Number + Gee Number) x 5 in hours per Engineer required. In
that case the chance of a breakdown is it\'s wear value as a percentage.
    This way you could multiply the cost of starship by 10 or 20 and players
could still afford them by buying old bombs.
    Sorry if this is all covered by TNE but I haven\'t read it. I am going to
adopt it for MegaTraveller though!

Now that was a fun movie... at least, the interesting parts were fun.
There were huge stretches of the movie that were rather snore-inducing.
I\'d love to see a contemporary remake of the film, but with some tighter
scripting so that the long drawn-out dull bits from the original are
shortened or gone altogether.

But it would make a great 3I sport. IMTU, it\'s the ubiquitous "Grav Ball",
although I once made a passing reference to a sport I invented for TSR\'s
"Star Frontiers" called Zarfball...  (Maybe I should post the rules
sometime?)

    The book the script was lifted from was very good, it\'s called
"Killerbowl" and it\'s Gridiron in hi-tech plastic armour and bloody big
knives. The players live in a society where skill is emphasised and the fans
only want blood, so the networks arrange it so the fans get what they want.
I personally think it was the first ever cyberpunk book.

Penguin Books has a set of historical atlases which fit the bill.  The
one for "ancient history," for example, has about forty maps, each
showing exactly the same projection of a region including all of Europe
and parts of Africa and Asia.  Each map has boundaries marked on it
for all major cultural or national groups in existence at a given point in
history.  Each map also has a facing page of commentary.

Almost like a "flip-book" of history.  Very useful as a first source when
you\'re doing research for a historical or time-travel story.

Besides, you may like the players\' conclusions and/or assumptions better
than your own original ones, and rewrite things (behind the scenes) to
match what the players concluded.

My TNE shows something like 12-6-3 for FGMP\'s, is that Mk1 Md0?  If I\'ve
read the rules correctly you\'re right the FGMP wouldn\'t penetrate AV 4
Combat Armor...heck, if I read them right AV 1 would stop that FGMP at
short range, right?  So, I *know* those stats must be wrong. <g>

I suppose 1/2-2-4 makes more sense.  The vargr\'s Combat Armor would soak
up 2 die (so 2 points of blunt trauma) and he\'s suffer 10d6+2 (12-37-62),
or 6d6+6 (12-27-42) if he was in Battle Dress.  Either way, Mr V.
shouldn\'t have survived long enough to kick Mr Z.

TNE\'ers out there, am I wrong about this?

Perhaps so, but I wouldn\'t count CC2 as "shareware/freeware", which is
what the original poster was seeking.  USD 75.95 is a bit steep for some
folks, and _definitely_ out of the "shareware/freeware" category.

Admittedly, you can download the CC2 demo for free, but it doesn\'t allow
you to save your work (according to the ProFantasy Web site).

Important note, folks :-
The first thing high TL medicine permits is the presence of males in the
far future (which may or may not be important, depending on your POV).
Are you all aware that the Y chromosome is unstable, getting shorter
with every generation that passes?
	Y chromosome abnormalities are intimately linked with male factor
infertility, as key information to build the male reproductive system is
coded on it.

In general, enhanced understanding of neurophysiology, psychiatry and
psychology (surgery has already been mentioned) permits manipulation of
*all* complex behaviours (and organs) by TTL 14-15, psionics or no. 
	Artificial wombs, computer-brain interfaces and highly sophisticated
drugs render the \'mechanical aspects\' of sex highly obsolete, especially
when any set of sensations or experiences can be imprinted, or
manipulated at the whim of a programmer or pharmacologist. 

A : "Why are we doing *this* tonight?" (inhales deeply from
\'aphrodisiac\' puffer)
B : "Uhh... because it\'s... traditional??" (continues clumsy foreplay)

Within this very wide set of parameters, literally anything is possible
between consenting humans. Other sophonts make the mix even more
complicated.

May I recommend to everyone the books of Masters and Johnson,
Llewellyn-Jones and Krafft-Ebbing?

Kenji and Leonard have already found DSM-IV. Such a cute document - the
Dewey Decimal System of mental illness, and a great cultural artifact
(y\'all know that homosexuality was removed for DSM-III, dontcha folks?
BIG controversy at the time in psychiatric circles, back in the funky
\'70s...).

        No, it isn\'t freeware, but it is try-before-you-buy...  which
usually a distinguishing feature of shareware.  Incidentally, I *personally*
think they are under pricing it by about 100%, but the PF gang know that the
gamer market aren\'t rich folk.  It is well worth the investment as a tool.
Again, MHO, YMMV.

Yes.

1.  Try to find an old copy of Viso, you don\'t need the latest, so an old
version 3 that someone is unloading would do.  I bought mine new for
79.95.  I did my deckplans for the /Mae Lee/ and the /Random Walk/ with
Viso, but I included some parts I had made in...

2.  FloorPlan Plus (3d, if you want 3d effects).  It ranges in price from
under $10 for the DOS version to about $40 for the Win9x Plus version.  I
was going to do my deckplans in 3d, but it was taking too long and I
thought I needed the plans quick.

3.  I\'ll echo Campaign Cartographer as a good choice, but any inexpensive
CAD program also works, though they aren\'t going to have the templates and
such already built.

4.  Corel Draw can be had cheaply.

5.  Star Office can be had free (or for next to nothing) and it includes a
Drawing component.

Before that I always did deckplans by hand, and I still think that is a
viable way to go.  Draw your plans then scan them with an inexpensive
scanner, and you can use the scanner for other stuff too. Cheap scanners
are well under $100 now.

IMTU, Gunnery is a specialized form of sensor skill.  The Gunner is
engaged in analysing and refining signal returns from the targeting
sensors, and then laying down fire patterns.  There are programs that can
do both, but they are very expensive and tend to be predictible.
Realistic? Who cares!

...and if you\'re really cheap, you can go looking for...

1. an old DOS program called TheDraw.  It draws in ASCII.  I
wouldn\'t want to do deckplans that way, but I have done simple floorplans

2.  Jim V.\'s Mapper, or another of his programs.  It\'s not made with
deckplans in mind, but I think it would work.

3.  Do it manually in ASCII with "./\\|~_-" and so on.  I\'ve done
that...right players?  <g> I think my ASCII plans have come out pretty

Did "Running Man" came after "RollerBall" ?

And where does "DeathRace 2000" fit ?

    I actually use AutoCAD 2000 but the the files produced are .dwg files.
If I copy them into Paint I can get .jpg files but they look really crummy.
It\'s a crying shame when a simple door has ten different lines in it and
uses three operations but when you look at it in the .jpg it\'s just a

    Hmm, I read "Killerbowl" about in \'78 and it was in a bargain bin so I
think it predates "Running Man." I\'ve got no idea about "Deathrace" but the
crux of the plot in "Killerbowl" is the ageing sportsman trying to show the
world that there is no sport at all. It\'s just televised murder.

 One look at how the NFL (to bring this and the football
thread together) assigns its teams to divisions makes it
clear that "successful" is pretty good at utter ignorance
as well...
 Fortunately, sports in Traveller are much less likely to
have such problems, since travel times go WAY up if
your "local" divisions get out of whack.

It\'s a good thing that I have had the chance to learn from my fellow
TMLers.  As a result, I use the "sip, set glass down, swallow, _then_
open new TML post" routine.  Without that iron discipline, instilled by
many long months of TML subscription, I would now need a new keyboard
(and at 1:20 AM local, that\'s a bit of a bother).

I prefer that Gunnery skill, at least at the turret level, should more
closely resemble Han and Luke on the Millennium Falcon in SW:ANH.  Less
realistic, but more dramatic.  (With sentiments like that, now you see
why I haven\'t yet progressed beyond "Journeyman Gearhead.")

ISTR reading about a college in San Francisco testing its students on
geography.  About half of the students, at a _San Francisco_ college,
couldn\'t locate the Pacific Ocean on a map.  (Sorry, I don\'t have a
cite.)

What?  Just because the NFC West division includes San Francisco
(definitely West), St. Louis (well, Midwest anyway; besides they moved
from Los Angeles), New Orleans (Gulf South, and, along with St. Louis,
on the Mississippi River), Carolina (Charlotte, North Carolina), and
Atlanta?

Hey, the way teams move in the NFL, they would have to realign teams
almost every year to keep them geographically close.

Of course, the sports league in question could merely require any team
that relocates to bear all extra travel costs caused by the relocation,
with the proviso that all games are scheduled based on travel to the
_original_ home world.  In other words, a team that moves to a site that
is Jump-2 away from its previous home may have to foot the bill for
Jump-4 travel for teams that would otherwise have made a Jump-2 to the
original home of the team.

Sure, the team can relocate, but the extra travel costs, both for the
team itself and for its opponents, will likely prevent relocation,
except as part of a large-scale reorganization of the league (similar to
the National Hockey League realignment a couple of years ago
[personally, I miss the old division and conference names]).

"The Running Man" was written in 1982 by Richard Bachman (aka Stephen King),
although it was not his only work about a futuristic sport, in 1979 he wrote
"The Long Walk". The film version of "The Running Man" was released in 1987.
Roger Corman\'s "Death Race 2000" was released in \'75, I think, and it was
about a race in which drivers earned points for mowing down pedestrians. The
hero, the champion of the race, has a change of heart, but other racers and
an anti-Death Race group are trying to take him out. It stars David
Carradine and Sly Stallone before he Rocky-ted to the top.

"Death Race 2000" was obviously one of the major influences for the game Car
Wars, which we all know and love (or at least I know it and love it).

Yes it does, I looked it up.  It also appears that I need to find the
errata for TNE because the pen for the FGMP was listed as 12-6-3, and that
didn\'t make sense.  

I believe there was errata in a later issue of Challenge.  Is that the
definitive TNE errata?

 No. You are correct.
 The original printing of the TNE rulebook put the High Energy weapon 
penetration VALUES (ie. for vehicle combat) in the spot it should have listed 
Penetration RATINGS (used for personal combat). The first clue is that the 
numbers go the wrong way with range. In personal combat the PEN number rises 
with range (more points lost per point of armor), but the HE Weapons table 
has numbers that go down (less armor punched w/range, the vehicle way).
 One annoyance: the numbers in FF&Sr1 don\'t quite agree with the main book 
(r0 in this case). FF&S lists Fusion weapons as 0.5-1-4, not 0.5-2-4. I don\'t 
have a late edition TNE rulebook to compare to...

Okay, I\'m weird, but I liked "The Gumball Rally" better than "Death Race

  Yeah, I\'ve recently acquired a door-stop on the subject. It\'s interesting
to realize just how convoluted the intra-bloc politics were beforehand.
It also begs the question of what similar things might have gone on in the
Party prior to the Solomani Rim War, although dissenting about the clear
break and being proven right wouldn\'t necessarily have been safe - wartime
exigencies and all that...

Well, Glenn, you are in luck! I remembered hearing a few months back that a
Rollerball remake was in the works. I did a quick internet search and it
turns out that, at least according to MGM\'s http://www.rollerball.com that a
remake is in development. Don\'t bother going to the site, though, it simply
says:

Rollerball: The Movie, In Development

If I know the film business, and I like to pretend I do, it should be a big
budget, low-content movie. It\'s very likely that the "dull bits" as you call
them will get the axe. So, yes Glenn, there really is a Santa Claus, and he
granted you your own personal wish!

I wouldn\'t go that so far as to call it the first cyberpunk book, but that\'s
just \'cause cyberpunk is / was a movement, and a select few people were
involved with it. The punk in cyberpunk means more than a dark future and
funny hair... don\'t tell that to R. Talsorian games, though. At the core of
the genre are a few things: the "do it yourself" punk ethos (Cheap Truth,
the *seminal* Movement \'zine was run off on a photo-copier) and the advent
of the cheap and non-archaic personal computer.

Sci-fi has a long tradition of "dark future" books, The Time Machine, 1984,
Brave New World, A Clockwork Orange. There\'s more to it than that, however.

On the other hand, I find it difficult to classify Death Race 2000 as
anything but a comedy.

  Luckily it takes high technology and wealth to build a space program, 
which pretty much means that an industrialized country will win any
space race; perhaps more accurately, anyone that can pay should finish,
but that\'s really only easy for big G-7 countries or groups.

Nope. They are (IIRC) a Dependency which is significantly different 
to the Orkneys, for example. When the Falklands kicked off, the 
Tories were in the process of removing the islander\'s rights to 
reside in the UK mainland.

There speaks a man who never experienced Maggie Thatcher first hand. 
I don\'t think she would have stopped with or without the US backing. 
:-/

Although the US help was very useful - probably reducing the number 
of deaths involved - however, there was also significant intelligence 
provided by SBS and SAS teams in the area of operations and in South 
America itself.

Chile\'s support was key, which is one of the reasons being used to 
argue against the extradition of their former leader.

Not many. OTOH how many wars have the Germans killed sh*tloads more 
Brits than the Brits killed Germans? Two this century, for starters.

Even using the later errata (all Plasma and Fusion weapons have a Pen 
of 1-2-10 IIRC) there\'s no way in hell that that Vargr should\'ve won. 
The minimum damage (assuming AV4) from a DV12 FGMP should\'ve knocked 
him down, and probably given him a slight wound (thus dropping his 
initiative to 5 - no second action), and allowing the Zho another shot, 
with similar result. Not a very impressive way of killing someone with 
a Fusion Gun, but he still should\'ve been dead.

I can\'t recall. Later errata made the Pen the same for Plasma and 
Fusion guns.

Most good historical atlases have a timeline in them (he says, then 
checks his two and finds that only one has a timeline).

I\'ve found that a historical altas can be a good source of inspiration 
for all sorts things, especially world building, but also any time you 
need an idea about how geography might effect some sort of movement, 
language spread, etc.

IIRC Challenge 75 had all the changes from FFS MK1 Modo to Mk1 Mod1. A 
later Challenge and (I think) Striker 2 had an article "Putting the 
Heat Back into Plasma" that is the last word (pretty much literally) on 
Plasma/Fusion guns. Its main effect is to make them cheaper, lighter 
and more powerful at low energies, while cutting their power a bit at 
the high end.

For the newbies to the Mac Scene ClarisWorks is what AppleWorks used 
to be called. And it\'s a damn fine, stable package. This ships with 
the iMac and iBook (not sure about the G4\'s) and is about 70 GBP to 
buy otherwise for WINDOWS and MacOS.

Personally, I like Adobe Illustrator but that\'s out of the price 
range we\'re considering.

I will gladly forward a tape of 49ers\' Defensive Lineman Bryant Young
having his lower leg broken in two places when another player landed on it,
or Steve Young being knocked unconscious when his head hit a players knee.

From what I\'ve seen, AmFootball differs from rugby in the level of
violence.

Interesting pouint on that last sentence.

In the NFL, you cannot hit the quarterback once he\'s thrown the ball.
That\'s called "roughing the passer", and is a fifteen yard penalty.

If the defending team intercepts the pass, that quarterback suddenly is a
defender, and can be blocked legally.  I\'ve seen quarterbacks just get
levelled by defenders who see the chance to take a free shot.

I use "Artworks" on the RISC PC (formerly by Acorn).

This is available as "Corel Xara" on the PC
(I don\'t know the current cost/availability though)

Of course, if you had a RISC PC, you could use "Draw" which is free and even
supports hex grids. (The main advantage of Artworks was the print on multiple
pages facility which I used for the Pioneer Ecks, since it has 30 decks.)

Once Houston\'s expansion franchise begins operating in the 2002 season, the
NFL will realign each conference (National and American) into four divisions
of four teams each. One AFC team will go to the NFC, much like Pittsburgh,
Baltimore (Colts) and Cleveland went to the AFC when the NFL and American
Football League merged in 1970.

Another great example of a legal monopoly was AT&T. Local phone calls were
cheap, long distance was expensive, but the public didn\'t seem to mind.
Until 1984, when Reagan decided to sue, and the judge who oversaw that case

Yes.  Borrowed.  Now appearing in my campaign.  

I was thinking about ways to get my players away from their ship to bash a
bit of wilderness.  They\'ll catch a bus - it\'s nice and inconspicuous.  And
if the bus gets stopped by the local freedom fighters, or the army,
then....

Cool.

I\'m not so sure about that.  First, there was resistance in Scotland too
(the battle of Killiekrankie, amongst others), plus, the war in Ireland was
_big_.  The armies involved were much larger than those involved in the
Civil Wars in the 1640s.

The Jacobite forces were supported by France, and included some elements of
the regular British army, namely, those originally posted in Ireland.  

William III\'s army was an odd mixture.  It was a hybrid of the British
army, the Dutch army, and a great chunk of "allies", many financially
subsidised.  This included Danish troops, and sundry Germans, and Swedes,
and all kind of odd bods.  Oh, and of course there were local Protestant
Irish recruits, too.

Both armies included French troops - William\'s were Protestants who had
gone into exile after Louis XIV started persecuting them again.

The armies themselves were actually commanded by the rival Kings in person
at the Battle of the Boyne.  This was the last time in English history when
this occurred.  William won.  James subsequently ran off back to France. 
His armies fought on for another couple of years.  

Basically, if William had lost at the Boyne, he would have been in serious
trouble.  

OBTrav:  What if Strephon, rather than Lucan, had ended up leading the
opposition to Dulinor\'s coup?  If Strephon was discredited enough, Dulinor
might have got away with it.

Alternatively, Strephon attempts to reclaim the throne, backed by _the
Solomani_.  I\'d shoot him myself.

Yes, I read this and enjoyed it.  I wrote the following review back in
September when I finished the book but understand that an updated version
has been created, and should be released as an Ebook through Warehouse
Publishing:
http://members.xoom.com/warehousepub

I believe this version should have corrected the typos mentioned in the
review below.



Also, if anyone likes the author\'s work (he had a hand in Behind the Claw,
Missions of State, Star Mercs and a favourite of mine, The Khiidkar
Incident) you might like to know that I understand a real paper book:
_Behind the Throne_, is due out in May.


Finally, I\'ve appended some comments on reading an e-text which some may
find of interest.

Best wishes for the time of year to all fellow Travellers, may all your
bugs have legs on!

******************************************

For the Greater Good - a review.

"For  the  Greater  Good", an e-novel by Martin Dougherty is an interesting
read.   Dougherty,  known to Traveller RPG enthusiasts as co-author of such
excellent  GURPS:  Traveller  volumes as "Behind the Claw" and "StarMercs",
tells  a  curious  tale  that  mixes a Napoleonic setting with fantasy in a
convincing  manner.   The  setting isn\'t Earth - unless it\'s the Earth of a
far  distant,  post-holocaust  future  - but along with cannon and muskets,
sabres  and  duelling,  sailing  ships  Lord Nelson would have been at home
with,  there  is  also Thaumaturgy.  This is Dougherty\'s term for the magic
present  in  the  book,  but  it is well thought out, suitably fearsome and
handled differently to much \'mainstream\' fantasy magic which is refreshing.
It is also essential to the story and raises lots of interesting questions.

The  story  concerns  one  Jervon Dessartes, a cavalry dragoon who is quick
tempered  and  yet  loyal  to  what  he perceives as his duty.  Loyal to an
extreme  which  causes  no  end  of  problems.  Accompanied by his faithful
batman  Camille  -  a  crusty old sergeant hiding from his past life in the
military  -  Dessartes  goes  through  various  adventures  in an effort to
restore  the  honour of his family.  In trouble with his superiors from the
outset  over  duelling,  he\'s  sent  on  a secret and exceedingly dangerous
mission to try to find long lost artifacts that might be used as weapons in
an  upcoming  military conflict.   Through the people they meet and the
trials they
encounter,  both  the  main  characters  discover much about themselves and
undergo  profound  changes.   Indeed, characters in the book comment on how
unrecognizable  they  become.  However, as we see all that they go through,
we\'re drawn into their lives and come to understand why they were what they
were and why they both choose to leave that behind.

All  this  is  set against a background of political strife amongst several
nations  as various politicians, generals and thaumaturges (or wizards) vie
for power in a struggle that results in intrigue and war.  The politics are
reasonably  complex  but  well  thought  out and contribute to the reader\'s
involvement  in  the  book.   However,  they are not helped by occasionally
bland  and undifferentiated names that can make the plot hard to follow.  A
little  more time spent giving the reader more of a sense of place - before
introducing  other factions - would have worked wonders here.  (A map would
have been useful and certainly in the tradition of fantasy novels but given
the  nature  of  an  e-text  distributed  in ASCII format, somewhat hard to
implement.)   Having  said  that  -  and  it may be a function of a lack of
familiarity  with this type of reading material - it does all work together
and  once  the  various  pieces are in place the book moves along at a good
pace.   Whether giving glimpses into goings on in high places, dealing with
the  grand  scale  of  events,  or  following  the more personal actions of
individuals,  the author seems equally at home.  He is able to interest the
reader in what is going on with a fine attention to detail that doesn\'t get
too  bogged  down  and yet conveys a good sense of the \'period\'.  The fight
scenes  are well handled and exciting whether grand scale land warfare, sea
battles  or  the  personal  combat  of  duels.   There  are a lot of - very
relevant - \'jargon\' terms that are used and to this untutored eye at least,
seemed very accurate.  A short glossary would have helped however for those
who aren\'t so accustomed to armour, weapons, and troop dispositions of this
kind of era.

The  e-text is not perfect yet. There are typographic errors - particularly
in  the  last  third of the book which suggest a certain lack of attention,
but  these  are  easily fixed.  Slightly harder to deal with are occasional
lapses  in  the  dialogue  that  don\'t  seem  to  quite ring true.  The odd
\'modern\'  expression  at first seems out of place but is sparingly used and
once  the  reader is accustomed to it, acts as a useful and subtle reminder
that  this  is  *not*  the past.  Dessartes and Camille are the only really
memorable  characters.    Although  others  are present through much of the
story,  there  is  a lot of ground to cover and little time to develop them
all in detail.  On the other hand, minor characters may only appear briefly
but can be well delineated - one example will have to suffice - a librarian
character  with  a  minor  role  isn\'t caricatured stereotypically but made
believable  and yet interesting.  This seems to be a particular strength of
the author.

In  all,  "For the Greater Good" was an intriguing and enjoyable book which
kept  up  the  interest till the end.   Dougherty has left the way open for
either  sequels  or  stories  set in the same world and this reviewer would
certainly welcome them.

******************************************


*Notes on reading an e-novel:*
For  the  Greater  Good  was  the  first e-book I\'d ever read and proved an
interesting  experience.   At first I had assumed that it would be a simple
matter  to  read  the  ASCII text file on an ordinary desk PC either during
lunchbreaks  at work, at home of an evening or both.  For a short time this
worked  although  I\'ve  never found reading large amounts of text on screen
very  comfortable and much prefer reading print on paper for ease and speed
of  reading experience.  Obviously, however, in an increasingly digital age
this  is not always practical or convenient.  The cost and time of printing
out  an  entire  novel  was  one such occasion and at this point it becomes
self-evident why there is still a book trade.

Then,  only  four chapters into the book, I was advised by my doctor not to
spend  so  much  time at the computer and in effect had to give up with the
novel.   Not  for lack of interest but I found I was reading too little too
infrequently  to  stay  involved  with  the  plot.   I had also come to the
conclusion  that  e-texts were unlikely to really take off until reading an
electronic  version  of  something  was  as  comfortable  and convenient as
reading a regular book.

Just  a  few  weeks ago, however, I obtained a PDA that could easily handle
the  size  of  file an ASCII novel occupies (a 3com Palm IIIx for those who
are  interested but any of the similar brands would no doubt have worked as
well).   It  then became clear that I could restart the book using a device
that  was a lot easier to read than text on a PC screen and was also as
portable
as  a  book  -  meaning  that I could fill in those odd moments waiting for
transport,  travelling,  tucked  up  in  bed and so on to read whenever and
wherever  I  felt  like.  (I even had the advantage of being able to search
for  particular  words  or  phrases,  find  the  place I\'d left off reading
immediately and read in the dark with the aid of the backlight so as not to
disturb  the  spouse!)   OK,  so  it\'s still not *quite* as easy to read as
black  print on white paper - though the IIIx screen should be complimented
on its extreme readability in a variety of lighting conditions - but it was
certainly  well  within  the  margin  of  comfort  that  made  the exercise
worthwhile.   Indeed,  I  now have several other e-texts - both fiction and
non-fiction and fully plan on continuing reading in this fashion.  (The PDA
takes  up  less room in the pocket too!)  It will be interesting to see how
long  it  is before you can buy mainstream books on sale in bookshops in an
alternative  format  suitable  for PDAs - or will dedicated e-book machines
get  into  the  lead  first?   The  only real snag has been the decrease in
battery  life  for  the  PDA  doing  really  solid reading involves but the
convenience is worth it and battery life will no doubt improve with time.

I just signed up and already have a question.

Here goes: 
While surfing the net to get material for my new campaign (set in 1114,
Spinward Marches) I found a great variety of ship designs. This is good;
not so good is the fact that they are also made in several different
design systems. 
Since I want to make use of the MT rules, it seems to me that at least
3/4 of the designs are unusuable for me. Or are they?

What it comes down to is this: 
Where can I find a description of the differences between the design
systems along with some notes on how to convert them? 

Have fun,

75% of enemy fire is directed at you but has no effect.

The rest of the PCs shoot and die according to the normal rules,
almost as if they\'re playing an entirely different game.

Trivia:  There used to be a cop show called  (IIRC)  Night  Heat.
It was set in an unspecified  US  city  but  actually  filmed  in
Toronto.  To get the authentic US city look the film crew had  to
add extra litter to the outside scenes.  At one  time  they  were
doing a night shoot and stopped for lunch at 3am: while away  the
city cleaners wandered by, saw  all  the  litter,  and  dutifully
removed it  ...  the  continuity  problems  ment  they  lost  the
"mornings" work!

There is some continuity at least. The government of 1109 is bound to some
extent by a legal decision made by the "World Court" a few years after
- -2030. It appears that the 3 millenia between -2000 and 1100 are a little
different from the 3 millenia between -1000 BC and 2000 AD. Perhaps analogies
drawn between the two periods are not altogether sound.

Well, I said the evidence wasn\'t conclusive. If you are bound and determined
that there shall be a break in continuity for most former nations, then you
could certainly use this argument to explain away the survival of Nepal as an
abberation. But as far as the available evidence goes, a certain amount of 
continuity is indicated. At the very least the rules for all Earth governments
from the United Nations to the government of 1109 has allowed one nation (or
rather, district) to survive. I don\'t see why other districts cannot have
survived too.

LOL

IMTU I used to play gunnery as a turret based  skill.  Think  Han
and Luke in the Millenium Falcon from Star Wars 4 ...

    SFX: Daga-daga-daga-Kaboom!
    PC1: "I got one!"
    PC2: "Great shooting, kid.  Don\'t get cocky."

Not in the least bit  realistic,  but  great  fun.  This  stopped
after the gunners in the  party  noticed  they  only  had  a  50%
survival rate in starship combat.  They quickly installed  remote
gunnery stations in the heart of the ship.  (I award a -1 penalty
on \'to hit\' rolls when using a remote station.)

Do people still use Macs?  I thought it was just a trendy looking

Reagan didn\'t sue AT&T, MCI did.
Trust me, the public did mind the high rates.  You think kids got to talk 
to Grandma while Mom & Dad stood there with a  stopwatch because it was a 
parlor game?

The local rates were cheap because they were federally regulated.  AT&T had 
to provide inexpensive local phone service, at the same rate everywhere, 
not because they wanted to, because the Feds forced them to.

Easy enough in areas of high people/phone density, but a pain the ass were 
you have to string 60 miles of cable for a single customer.

AT&T overcharged long distance to pay for the loss in local service.

After the MCI case broke up AT&T, AT&T, which kept long distance service, 
and was now free of supporting local calls, planned on dropping rates 
drastically (thus putting MCI & Sprint out of business).  MCI ran crying to 
the feds and got rulings stopping AT&T and doing so.

        <chuckle> Yeah, I know, I know...  the function of the gunner is
largely abstracted to the issues of sensor operation, threat management and
selecting the right fire-plan for the job...  the computer brings up its
five recommendations and then the human operator says "use THAT one"...  
        If you *don\'t* opt for push button warfare, it becomes awfully "Star
Wars"-y in feel to me...  which is fine, but then you have to allow for
tigher engagment ranges, smaller combat turns, and that sort of thing.

Rollerball came out in 1975, the same year as DeathRace 2000 (wow,
directed by Paul Bartel, of Eating Raoul fame...) but long before Running
Man (Presuming you mean the Ahhnuld vehicle, it was released in 87)

Rollerball was serious, DR2K was, well, the inspiration for the game
Carmaggedon.

Wasn\'t there just recently, a remake of Rollerball? (ISTR either a very
fast pass through the theatres or it was a tv or made for cable movie...)

I read Killerbowl a looong time ago, but I didn\'t make the conection to
Rollerball. As for it being cyberpunk...that\'s a hard call. It is part of
the dystopic SF born out of the New Wave, which influenced cyberpunk, but
I\'d class it along with Brunner\'s works like Stand on Zanzibar.

Sounds a lot like Rollerball, alright, but Rollerball itself was based on
a short story called "Rollerball Murder", by William Harroson, first 
published in 1973;  Harrison also wrote the movie screenplay. As for
cyberpunk, many point to John Brunner\'s "The Shockwave Rider" as the first
cypberpunk book; like "Killerbowl", it was published in 1975, so which came
first is a toss-up. :)

There\'s a program called Mayura Draw, http://www.mayura.com Version 2.04
(was called PageDraw, a Win3.1/95 hence 16-bit) is free, the current
version (3.5) for win95/98/nt is shareware, but they don\'t mention how
much on the web site. ISTR it was like $39 or so, but don\'t quote me on
that.

Why, yes. It\'s called an iMac. Just shove that PC onto the floor and place
it reverently on your desk. Installed ;-)
/Sarcasm

Actually, the Mac emulators I\'ve tried aren\'t worth the bits they take up
on disk. Better to get a cheapo Mac, it\'s cheaper, too. You can get an old
SE (which should run Infini-V) for about $25, more capable ones for not
much more.

Timco computers (http://www.timco-computers.com) has a Centris 610 (a
68040 (iirc, maybe a 68030) system, quite capable (if it\'s got a 68040,
it\'ll run System 8.1), 16 megs/80 mb hdd. ethernet, video etc built in)
for $75 (no monitor) With a CD it\'s a bit more. 

The best emulator is almost always a real computer. I know, I have Virtual
PC ( and PC\'s are a heck of a lot easier to emulate than Macs are) on my
Mac. I have a 233 mhz 604, roughly equivalent to a 250-300 mHz Pentium,
and it emulates a PC at about the speed of a fast 486/slow pentium, whihc 
at least is usable, but nothing to call home about.

Obviously, Grandfather\'s genetic engineering of real humans (i.e., Sayat)

"Y"askodray chromosome can be removed very easily, just contact your local
Sayat consulate... no knives, no knives...

Well, I\'m rather fond of the description in Heinlein\'s "Citizen of the
Galaxy". Basicly, while the computer does most of the work, the gunner
is constanly using his "trained intuition" to suggest options "What if
he changes course or accel like *this*?" "What if we do *that*?"

Basicly, while the computer is working away on a move/response decision
tree (like the "look ahead" function in chess programs) the human is
suggesting which branches of the "tree" are most worth following (the
"value" function of the chess program).

Maps of the *whole* world would be rather nice. Besides the Americas
there are things like the ruins on Ponape(?) in the South Pacific,
where even if we don\'t know much about the culture, it\'d be nice to
know that *someone* was messing about with megalthic construction there
during whatever period it was built in.

Well, that\'s the nice thing. If you do some fairly elementary (and not
terribly expensive) stuff you can "mothball" them so they\'ll last
unattended for a *long* time. Mostly it\'d consist of spraying a plastic
coating between the contact surfaces of things like hatches and doors
and re-lubing hinges so that you don\'t get vacuum welds.

It all too often *used* to be that what the artist got handed was the
back cover "blurb", or the inside cover one. And since *those* are
written by someone other than the author (and he usually didn\'t even
get any sort of veto power) you can guess what sort of nonsense those
third-hand info covers were.

I have two novels and a collection of Asimov essays with the *same*
cover. It\'s a spaceship approaching an asteroid.

And even if you don\'t, you can always file the idea away to use in the

I have TheDraw. I also have AcidDraw which is actually still supported.
Both are intended for constructing "screens" for BBSes, though they\'d
likely work ok for the "text only" elements of web pages.

JPG is the *worst* possible format for *drawings*. It\'s designed to
*throw away* fine details. 

If the color set is small use GIF files. If it\'s more than 256, use PNG
files. 

And for vector files, CGM files are probably the most portable. I know
Corel can handle them.

Well, I\'ve been assembling a library of images from (of all things!)
Anime related games. The folkson alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.anime
frequently post *all* the images in a game, which means you get lots of
images of streets, building exteriors and interiors, etc. 

I mostly grab ones that look usable. I\'ve got a number of what are
obviously ship interiors. Including things like a cargo hold before and
after a battle. :-)

Things like that might be a bit below the level of detail they can provide in
this format.  Even if one of the atlases covers the South Pacific -- I don\'t
know if they\'ve published one for that area yet.

Granted, the first couple of atlases in the series are pretty old, and may 
date
back to the time when respectable academics could think that history was
something that only happened in Europe.  Still, Penguin has steadily been
releasing new volumes in the series to cover other parts of the world.  I saw
an atlas of North American history a few months ago.  It appeared to
cover the movements of the Native American peoples all the way back to
the cross-Bering migrations -- at least in as much detail as the archeological
record will support.

  At a wild guess, Bomber Command alone may have killed more in WW2
than the UK itself lost; the numbers for WW1 won\'t be so cut & dried,
but the same result should occur, even without blockade effects.

Actually, that is a really neat idea, although I\'ve been taking a different
tack myself. I\'m working on a VRML representation of one of the starting
points for my next campaign. I still haven\'t decided if it\'s going to be
Traveller, but it will be set in a high-tech future at any rate. The
original goal was to set up a bunch of stores so that the PCs can go
shopping without taking up a huge amount of time during the first few
sessions.

If anyone else is interested, and not many people are \'cause VRML is nearly
universally reviled, There\'s a really nice program called Spazz3D for
putting together things in VRML. It\'s relatively easy to use, and Blaxxun\'s
Avatar Studio is quite nice for putting people into your world. To tie that
back to the original subject of this thread, Avatar studio allows you to
select from several skin colors as well customize the body type and facial
features, so you can turn out Vilani who are dark-skinned, or light skinned,
or anywhere in between!

Unfortunately for you Mac folks, neither program is available for your
platform.

Sounds great! I myself also have great respect for full scale special
effects. When I was growing up my idol was Tom Savini, but that reference
may go over other people\'s heads. Suffice to say, when I was young I used to
dream of becoming a make-up artist... and I don\'t mean just applying rouge
and stage make-up either.

  That should be wildly inaccurate, unless the losses on the Eastern Front
are largely attributed to being an "indirect result of aerial bombardment";
IIRC, most losses were in the army, and most of those were in the East. The
strategic bombing offensive wasn\'t fun for anyone, but it very likely was
not decisive* either.

may go over other people\'s heads. Suffice to say, when I was young I used to
dream of becoming a make-up artist... and I don\'t mean just applying rouge
and stage make-up either.

Being slightly bored and with time on my hands, I drew up a simple sign

You get one of these for each post in which at least one keyboard is

Personally, I\'d rather design some kind of warship.  Although I\'ve
already posted one proposal, overall I\'m flexible about size, mission,
and TL.

What would be the parameters of the modular cutter design?  (After all,
we can\'t decide on a design competition without some details.)

What do the rest of you think?

I\'ll away from my system for about 5 days or so, so don\'t expect to hear
anything from me in that time.

I was just getting ready to head down to my Mom\'s house in San Diego (got a
late start \'cause I lost a fight with my alarm clock), when I realised that
roughly today, Dec 23rd, is the one year anniversary with my involvement in
producing Traveller artwork for Steve Jackson Games.  It was this time last
year that I answered Loren\'s TML broadcast for artwork for the then upcoming
"Far Trader".  I spent most of my time at Mom\'s last year modeling the
Marava :)  One year later my artwork appears in "Far Trader", "First In",
"G:T 2nd Edition", "Alien Races 2", "GURPS:Space 3rd edition",
"GURPS:Alternate Earths 2", the upcoming "Starports" (boy am I glad THAT\'S
over), and I\'m slated for work on "Ogre", "Navy", "Starships", "Cutter
Sourcebook", and "Ground Forces", at a minimum.  Looks like my Year Two
involvement will be, well, just as involved :)  I look forward to providing
our little community with more and better artwork as the [marketing hype]
New Millenium [/marketing hype] begins.

Best wishes for a safe holiday season.  Have a couple for me when you don\'t
have to drive!

I am a teacher, but the only reason I know any geography is due to a college

of blank maps of North, South America, Europe, etc...
You had to learn rivers, cities, mountain ranges and she was deadly serious.
I saw many 3rd and 4th year students who were trying to slide through a
first year history course freak when they saw the test. She warned them, but
no one really listened.  Needless to say, WE ALL LEARNED IT.  You had to in

"exchangeable" graphics formats!

Nevertheless, I\'ll throw my two cents in (actually, three or more):

- - JPG is the worst possible format for anything but full-range
photographs. Line drawings, especially, need to be saved in a
non-lossy format. (Technical details: JPG converts blocks of pixels
from the spatial (x,y, RGB) domain into the frequency domain (i.e. a
series of cosine functions that approximate the RGB value at each
original x,y), and then throws away higher frequency values. Hence,
fine details get lost or blurred across multiple pixels).

- - There *is* no standard vector format. Most modern programs can read
DXF, CGM, WMF and PS with varying levels of fidelity, depending on
platform.

- - My choice: I want three copies of *everything*: the artist\'s
original format whatever it is (preserve maximum fidelity, and hope I
can read it), WMF or DXF (for a close vector approximation that
allows me to effectively scale and edit it), and .PNG or .GIF as the
"most portable least editable."

I plan to go through _all_ TML posts since late October 1999, and tally

Yeah, but Texas has 3,234 little counties all over the place (anyone
ever _seen_ a county map of Texas? ;-) Jeez, the county sherf probably
leaves his jurisdiction backing out of his driveway! 

guess I was a nerd even in grade school (well, duh!) I liked geography:
we always got neat little blank maps to draw on, which started a long,
and ongoing fascination with things cartographic...

I\'m not quite sure how you\'d get the same result in WWI, after all it

Oooh stickers...I\'ll have to see.

If any one really wants it for stickers or something, I have the

Wait a second there. The idea of a nation only came up in the 17th/18th
in *western* Europe. Absolutism and all that. Until then the general
populace (mostly illiterate farmers) didn\'t care if their (land)lords
were French, German or Swedish. Indeed, in Germany, a country that was
one of the latter ones to achieve the status nation, it wasn\'t until the
protests of 1832 (Hambacher Schloß, nudge nudge) that the cry for a
unified nation was heard. The nobility until then derived their claims
from god - and possibly Napoleon, depending on where you were at the
time. ;)

Well if we have a few weeks notice, Jae Campbell can have the use of his
community Centre for free,  3 big halls and other smaller rooms, computers,
photocopiers etc..

we could even make it a weekend event say 15-16 Jan.....

If you want me to run something it will be Mega trav, or Gurps,
            I also drive,  so how many of you would be free for a weekend/
day of say 15-16   Jan,   Or if you have any other days in mind let me know

If you could send to me off the list I will talk to Jae and let you all know
what is going down.!

I don\'t have a cable modem, but the system my shell account is on has a

The ruins aren\'t exactly small. This was a *major* population center or
ceremonial center. It covers a *lot* of ground. It\'d be more noticable
if the mangrove(?) swamps hadn\'t grown up around it.

Knowing Ditzie, the "open fire" was made by lighting a few bags of
gunpowder or the like that were past usage date (they really do
dispose of old powder by burning it). 

Picture her tossing on a new bag/box every so often, as well as "scrap"
explosives (ie trimmings of TNT, C4, etc). And maybe the occasional
magnesium or titanium scrap (pieces from designs that didn\'t work out).

Of course, this fire will have flames shooting up a few hundred
feet.... you roast things by extending them past the blast shield a
could of hundred meters from the *edge* of the
inferno^H^H^H^H^H^H^Hfire. Said fire being "only" 50 or so meters
across. 

I base this vision of hell on the results of having the "Senior Patrol"
in one Scout troop I was in being delegated to "watch the camp" during
a camporee (inter troop competition). 

They decided to build a bigger fire. When we got back for lunch, they
had dragged half a dozen downed *trees* together into a rough "teepee"
shape and ignited them. One scout cooked a TV dinner one the ground 10
feet from the fire!

So I just asked myself what those guys would have done given the
resources available to Ditzie. :-)

    Not only do I not have a cable (wistful sigh) but I have the dubious
honour of running through the slowest telephone exchange in Tasmania. I
think I\'ll work up the plans on AutoCad 2000 and clean it up in Photoshop,
when I can get it to run the images. Strangely enough, I can copy into Paint
but not Photoshop and when I convert the image into .jpg in Paint, Photoshop
won\'t read it.

I picture star ships in the trade I describe as being at the bottom of the

chewing gum and bailing wire.   They survive on used parts and make do.
"Vargr rigged" or "woofer engineered" might be a particularly un politically

attention being paid to them.  They have very little impact on developed
worlds but play a significant role in the economies of low tech ones.
They are "the dustman/rag pickers of the spaceways".   They occasionally
engage in the marginally criminal traditional activities of smuggling of low
risk illegal merchandise in small packages and the transport of "warm"
merchandise for plausible which deniability can be claimed.

This is a rather eurocentric view, don\'t you think?

I am pretty sure that people in China have always had a very good sense that
they are Chinese and and that their rulers were Chinese (or invaders) and
that they are living in the Middle Kingdom.

My Chinese ex can trace his family back to the Han (don\'t get him started on
the Manchu).  I don\'t know about the academic definition of nationalism and
all-- it\'s been years since I did academic history-- which hasn\'t always got
much relationship to actual history-- but there is a very definite sense of
what is and is not China and what is and is not Chinese that has been a
factor in Chinese thinking for a lot longer than 300 or 400 years.

And I am pretty sure that the Tokugawa, to whom my Beloved One\'s family were
once retainers (don\'t get him started on the Meiji), had a pretty good sense
of Japan as a nation-- and what they did and did not want coming into and
out of that nation.

As far as geography goes one of the problems is that it is not 
taught at most US Univ anymore as an independent even Thomas 
here got his from his history professor though he seems to have 
learned alot. The best schools are Berkly and Chicago. Luckly I go 
to LSU which actually has a good/great geography/anthropology 
departenment.  Its amazing what you can learn.  In my Research 
Methodologies Class are reports covered a wide range of topics.  
Though I am a human ie history, political,economic, and area 
studies grad stundent, ie I study geopolitics, I look foward to 
learning GIS software and satellite tasking.  Also there is all that 
cool physical geography stuff as well.
So much to learn so little money  : )

Geography can be extermly fun

Well, if you can find someone selling a copy of ClarisDraw, I\'ve got a
library for doing deckplanes on my web site.  I don\'t know if it will work
under ClarisWorks/AppleWorks.  I\'ve never tried it with my old version of
ClarisWorks, and haven\'t had a reason yet to get the latest version of
AppleWorks.

The library is at http://zane.brouhaha.com/healyzh/files/DeckPlan.hqx it
includes all the common deckplan symbols and the common smallcraft.

If you can\'t find ClarisDraw I would recommend AppleWorks though since it
includes most of the functionality of ClarisDraw.  I think it\'s available
on the PC still, and I know it\'s available for the Mac.  I\'ve found
ClarisDraw to be the best program out there for doing deckplans and
starcharts, but it isn\'t suited for planetary maps.  Personally for
planetary maps I\'d use Painter, but Painter is a rather expensive program.

Naaaahhh. Ditzie does it _right_:


Take one 25 lb bag charcoal.

Soak with a couple liters LOX.

Drop match on it from a _distance_.

The charcoal will be gone in seconds...but what _glorious_ seconds they
are!

(NB: There was an engineering prof somewhere who\'s done this a number of
times. He\'s made Dave Barry\'s column, and was the killer of the INternet
once upon a time as everyone dl\'ed his mpeg of the events...I forget
where it is; it\'s probably still posted somewhere.)

Also good on the Mac Scene is DeskDraw/DeskPaint. Runs about US$40 for the
pair, if still available. Nice, simple, and it has run on my machines from
OS 6.0.8 through 8.1, and has always been smooth and fault free. I did my
CarWars Vehicle Sheets with it. And Roadway sections.

This is a rather eurocentric view, don\'t you think?

I am pretty sure that people in China have always had a very good sense that
they are Chinese and and that their rulers were Chinese (or invaders) and
that they are living in the Middle Kingdom.

My Chinese ex can trace his family back to the Han (don\'t get him started on
the Manchu).  I don\'t know about the academic definition of nationalism and
all-- it\'s been years since I did academic history-- which hasn\'t always got
much relationship to actual history-- but there is a very definite sense of
what is and is not China and what is and is not Chinese that has been a
factor in Chinese thinking for a lot longer than 300 or 400 years.

And I am pretty sure that the Tokugawa, to whom my Beloved One\'s family were
once retainers (don\'t get him started on the Meiji), had a pretty good sense
of Japan as a nation-- and what they did and did not want coming into and
out of that nation.

Yes, to my mind a \'nation\' is a contiguous geographical area occupied by a
single culture, ruled by a single government (be that a Monarch, Senate,
Parliament, Emperor etc),

ie China & Japan, have been nations for ages (single cultures, single
governments). Italy & Germany have only been nations for 100 - 150 years
(single cultures, formerly many governments). Nations, once formed, tend to
last a long time (unless conquered) due to a sense of commonality.  Some
areas that are, or have been, \'nations\' in the modern era are really Empires
by a different name eg Russia/Soviet Union, Yugoslavia.  They aren\'t
(weren\'t) true nations, as they were composed of many cultures ruled by a
single government, and thus readily fell apart into smaller nations at the
first real opportunity.

Check out www.emulation.net. However, the only Mac Emulators I\'ve seen for
the PC have emulated M68000 systems ONLY. They will only run through system
7.1.1 at best. Black and White only. Forget even trying to run PPC code...

There was a Linux project for mac emulation[1], but I haven\'t heard the
penguins peep about it since 1997.

Funny enough, there is a Mac Plus emulator for the PPC system8+ machines... [2]

[1]As in, emulating MacOS on the Linux OS, specifically to get Mac Software
running on x86 boxes.
[2] Many of the Anchient (sys 4, 5, 6) titles won\'t run under OS 7.5 or later.

        I agree completely - it\'s just amusing that TNE, arguably the most
hard-science Traveller incarnation yet, had skill levels play such
a large role in combat.

       If part of the gunner\'s job is adjusting the input from his/her
individual
targeting sensor, than the job does become more skill-driven.
(Also, if one is using only passive sensors, there\'s an issue of determining
the range, at least for the first turn of fire...)

I was going over some old TML posts (looking for keyboard kills), and I
noticed that I never told you what "Albadawi" means.  It\'s Arabic for
"The Bedouin."

So, find an early colony with a large Arab population....

Northpole Standoff

A fierce battle ended in a stand-off today as a multi-jurisdictional task
force of federal law enforcement agents tried to arrest the leader of a
militant doomsday cult, who call themselves "Elves," living in a heavily
fortified compound at the Northpole. According to witnesses, federal agents
hid in livestock trailers as they drove up to the compound.

The approach was difficult in the snow using wheeled vehicles. Several
agents were reportedly thrown from the trailer when it hit a snowbank. The
agents were unable to use dogteams and sleds because the ATF agents shot all
the dogs during training at a nearby recreational facility where agents had
practiced for weeks on a mock-up of the compound in preparation for the
raid.

As three National Guard helicopters approached, over 100 law officers
stormed the main compound, a heavily fortified gingerbread structure,
throwing concussion grenades and screaming "Come out!" Cult members and law
officers negotiated a cease-fire about 45 minutes after the incident began.

For the next several hours, ambulances and helicopters swarmed the premises.
The area was cordoned off and ATF agents with machine guns were posted in
the roadways to keep reporters at least two miles from the main battle area.

In a lengthy report on the group Saturday, The Northpole Tribune-Herald said
that the cult was known to have a large arsenal of high-powered weapons,
probably produced in a workshop disguised as a "toy factory." This toy
factory is also believed to be the sight of a methamphetamine laboratory,
according to sources inside the ATF.

The article quoted investigators as saying the crazed cult leader, who uses
several aliases, "Santa Claus," "Saint Nick," "Sinterclaas," and "Saint
Nicholas," age unknown, has abused children and claims to have at least 15
wives. Santa Claus denies these accusations of abuse and said he has had
only one wife, Mrs. Santa Claus.

Authorities had a warrant to search the Northpole compound for guns and
explosive devices and an arrest warrant for its leader, Santa Claus, said
Mess Stanford of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in Washington,
D.C. Mr. Stanford added it would be useless to attempt to get a copy of this
warrant, however, because it had been sealed, "for national security
reasons."

The assault came one day after the Northpole Tribune-Herald began publishing
a series on the cult, quoting former members as saying the deranged cult
leader, Santa Claus, abused children and had at least 15 wives.

ATF spokesman Jack Killchildren in Washington said the assault had been
planned for several weeks, although he added, "I think the  newspaper\'s
investigation set up heightened tension." The cult\'s fortress, called "The
Toy Factory," is dominated by a tower with lookout windows facing in all
directions. Guards reportedly patrol the 77-acre grounds at night.

Attorney General Janet Reno ordered the raid after cult members refused to
surrender documents relating to national security. A source inside the
Justice Department said that the documents were lists of cabinet members and
highly placed government officials who were naughty or nice. Despite
preliminary, secret negotiations to obtain the list, the Elves refused to
surrender the document to the Justice Department.

The raid was scheduled for December 23, because December 25 is believed to
be a traditional cult holiday and all the militant elves would be engaged in
cult rituals in preparation for the event.

At a press conference this afternoon, Attorney General Reno said, "These
militants abuse children in the most vile manner, by teaching them to expect
charity. They have even distributed free, working replicas of \'assault
weapons\' and \'handguns.\' It is a matter of dire importance to our future and
the future of all our children, that this peril be ended by every means at
our disposal."

She went on to say that "I do not want to surround the compound and shoot
everyone and then burn it to the ground in order to prevent this child abuse
from occurring again, but that appears to be our only alternative."

According to Reno, the "Toy Factory" itself is a sweatshop and conditions
inside were horrendous. The Department of Justice is also looking into
allegations of animal cruelty. Former members of the cult have claimed that
Santa Claus frequently uses leather restraints on at least eight reindeer,
housed in sordid conditions on the compound. Witnesses reported seeing a
reindeer with a protruding red nose, which Janet Reno said was further
indication of the abusive conditions inside the compound.

Several of the elves were reported by the BATF to have been carrying
automatic weapons. However, independant sources dispute this, claiming that
the "automatic weapons" were nothing more than large candy canes.

ATF leader Ted Oyster, shaken after the ordeal, spoke to reporters as
hundreds of agents, many of them in tears, were taken away from the
Northpole in military airlifts, ambulances, and private vehicles.

"We had our plan down, we had our diversion down, and they were waiting..."
Oyster said resignedly, shaking his head.

A hospital spokesman said that most of the wounded ATF agents appeared to be
suffering from shrapnel wounds from broken candy canes, as well as
frostbite, apparently suffered from wearing forest-green camoflage in the
wintery terrain.

Attorney General Reno offered no comment on these reports.

Mack "the knife" McWarty was seen strolling across the White House lawn,
chuckling to himself as he read what inside sources say was a copy of the
naughty/nice list.

One highly placed government official was found dead in Marcy Park. His name
and the cause of death are unknown at this time, however, the White House
immediately issued a statement claiming the official had committed suicide
after learning his name was not on the nice list.

Patsy Thomahawk refused to comment on the advice of her attorney on whether
she had any part in removing copies of the naughty/nice list from a safe in
the White House.

A spokesman from the MJTF said that it was indeed a tragedy that Santa Claus
had caused this confrontation, but this should be a lesson to anyone who
tries to give to everyone without permission from the welfare department,
and that gathering sensitive data without a permit from official sources
will be stopped by any means.

FBI spokesman Bob Pricks, the former National Abortion Rights Action League
Poster Child of 1944, relayed that "We are dealing with a madman. We have
cut off all electricity, water, and communications to the compound. Santa
Claus has demanded that we relay a message to the world. It reads, \'Merry
Christmas to all and to all a good night.\' FBI psychological experts are
presently analyzing the message, however,preliminary reports indicate this
is an encrypted threat to invade the neighboring towns near the Northpole.
It may also be a doomsday message that the cult intends to commit suicide,
like Jonestown."

Shortly after the raid, a smiling Reno was seen strolling through the pile
of rubbish looking for anatomically correct Barbie dolls. She claimed that
she was going to confiscate any that she found as "evidence" and that they
were for a personal investigation that she was conducting.

Attorney General Reno also disclosed some information about plans to raid
Mr. E. Ster Bunny sometime next spring. According to the FBI\'s report on Mr.
Bunny, he has been hoarding food all year. This is in direct violation of a
secret Presidential Directive. "This ingratitude for everything that we have
done will stop, even if it means raiding every house in the USA to enforce
these new laws that were made to insure your freedom...." Reno said.

This, boys and girls, should make us all sleep just a little bit better
tonight. The government will protect us from overindulging in freedom. If
they didn\'t step in and take control of that "naughty/nice" list, just think
what shape we might be in.....  :-)***********

    'body' => 'Hi, after looking over the latest recurrence of the "TNE combat sucks" 
cycle, I\'ve decided to write up a quick fix I came up with last time.

For those that are interested here it is:

Rupert\'s Non-Ablative Damage System for TNE v0.9

*Warning: This has not been play tested*

This is an attempt to fix something that has bothered many people 
(including me, from time to time) about TNE\'s combat system, namely 
that it\'s too hard to injure PCs without using ridiculously powerful 
weapons.

The system works as follows:

1.	Use D10s for damage

2.	All PC hit points are halved, except for the head. All NPCs have 
hit points equal to double their base stats (12 for Novice and 
Experienced NPCs, 14 for Veterans and 16 for Elites).

3.	The severity of a wound is determined by comparing the rolled 
damage to the damaged locations hit points, as normal. However damage 
is not cumulative - each wound stands on its own. The procedure for 
NPCs is the same, and damage to the head is not doubled.

4.	Wound states are somewhat cumulative.
	
	A second slight wound results in -2 initiative, three slight wounds 
equal one serious wound, but do not disable any part of the body, 
unless they\'re all on the same place. Slight wounds do have extra 
effect beyond the third one, and do not have any extra effect if the 
character is already seriously or critically wounded.

	A second serious wound results in a -4 to initiative, and a third 
one results in the equivalent to a critical wound (the character is 
unconscious and will die in 10 minutes, etc). Extra serious wounds 
beyond this have no extra effect.

5.	Note the "no extra effect" in 4 above does not mean that no knock-
down, panic, etc is caused, just that the character\'s overall wound 
severity does not get any worse.

That\'s about it. All normal consequences of wounds still apply (knock-
down, stun, etc). The big thing is that body locations aren\'t ablative, 
and that there is some consequence to having lots of light wounds 
scattered over one\'s body. NPC\'s wounds are now assessed the same way 
as PCs, too. This should balance things up somewhat.

That\'s about it folks.

From everything I\'ve read, since the death of Mao China has fell back into
the old ways.  The peasants farm, the warlords bluster, and everybody
avoids the Imperial Court err, the Central Committee.  If Marx and Engels
saw what China considers "communism", they\'d die (again) laughing.

You mean Boston Latin School?  I would\'ve probably
gone there if my family hadn\'t moved to Idaho when I
was 10.  One would expect students to learn basic
geography there -- hell, I learned basic geography in
Boston grade schools in the 1960s.

Well, the Chinese have been known to take the position
that all of Japanese culture can be traced to
borrowings from China.  As to some things, the
Japanese don\'t deny it.  For example, many Japanese
word characters are the same as Chinese characters.

That\'s the same argument the United States made when
it took over native lands.  "Nobody is claiming this;
nobody owns it.  We\'re just settling on empty, unused
land."  The rhetoric is a little different in the Far
Future, but the idea is the same.  To the extent that
the ihatei can justify taking someone else\'s land with
the argument that the native doesn\'t really own it,
they will.  To the extent they don\'t have to justify
it, they won\'t bother.

It is true that some land is actually empty, not
inhabited, used, or otherwise owned by any sophonts,
and that land is quite attractive to the ihatei.

That is old, because I first heard it when I lived in
Cambridge in 1979.  The Harvard students were also the
ones most likely to note (correctly) that the sign
should properly read "8 items or fewer" (and Whole
Foods here in the Bay Area uses the correct wording).

Hmmm...  Let\'s think of the differences between then and now and how =
they will affect the evolution and decay of nations.
1) Communications
        a. History is well documented and indestructible by anything but =
a major catastrophe (silicon eating bacteria, whatever, re: Ringworld) =
that destroys computerized information retrieval systems) or a holocaust =
such as a global nuclear war or a plague (12 Monkeys) that will destroy =
civilization down to the family unit.  Oral tradition of who we are and =
what our society is will probably be lost and new forms based on =
survival/practicality will grow.
THE POINT:  20th century entrenched nations (Russia, China, US, Europe, =
Argentina, Brazil, Egypt, Oz,for example) will most likely still be =
there in some form.  The way they are governed, what their societies are =
like, will have changed (probably cyclically over such a long period of =
time), but the continuity with the past won\'t be broken.  They will =
remember who they are and what their country is supposed to be.  What =
could cause the name itself disappear is changes in the people.
EXAMPLES:  Russia: once Russia became a nation, instead of the Land of =
the Slavs, it never went back.  Despite the depredations of the Mongols, =
the rule of the Tsars, the new government and ideology of Communism, and =
the democratic government it has now, Russia is still Russia, despite =
the changes in how its governed.
                    Italy:  Once Italy became Rome, and entrenched =
itself and its traditions for hundreds of years, it was identifiable =
even when it was split to pieces.  Today, approx. 2000 years later, =
modern Italy is the core of territory of Rome.
                    Egypt:  The people are very different, the religion =
is utterly different.  Still, it is Egypt, because people lived the same =
way for thousands of years, and asked, "who are we and where do we come =
from?  Who are we as a people? Who left these pyramids out?".
                    China:  a cultural and linguistic bloc which only a =
world destroying holocaust could shake.  IMHO, it would have to be a =
deliberate, systematic  attempt to destroy it (perhaps after occupying =
Terra, the Vilani decide to destroy Terra\'s largest homogenous =
population. They kill all the adults (nuclear, biological, chemical), =
punish the children if they speak Chinese and not Vilani, and ship them =
to barren colony worlds.  In time, they may forget where they came from. =
 I think this has happened to alot of the smaller Native American tribes =
since the colonial era.  This was successfully done by the ancient =
Israelites to the Nabateans.  They killed all the men and forced the =
women and children to convert to Judaism and speak Hebrew.  They forgot =
who they were, and were only rediscovered by modern archeaologists).
                    England:  Older than a thousand years and still =
going, London is still London, there is still a monarch, the country\'s =
heritage keeps it concious of itself.
                    Ethiopia:  Despite the depredations of slavery, =
colonialism, wars, starvation the country was ruled in the same way for =
hundreds of years, and is culturally much older (HISTORY EXPERTS: THIS =
IS OFF THE CUFF).

So.  That\'s my 2MCr

Empire and Commonwealth?  Weren\'t they starting to
teach Japanese in the public schools in India and
Australia by 1941 so that their children would have
some chance to get ahead in the new world order?  

The colonial forces did not even slow the Japanese
advance into the parts of Asia that they conquered
(nor did U.S. forces in the Philippines).  India was
saved by geography.  Japanese supply lines through
China and Burma were too long and too easily
interrupted to make an invasion of India realistic. 
Australia was likewise too far, with too much water
and too many American warships in between.  

Colonial forces protected Britain directly in the
African and European theaters, but certainly did not
pull the mother country\'s butt out of the fire.  

Politics and stupidity in the German high command
helped Britain much more than the colonial forces ever
did (and, arguably, at least as much as U.S.
involvement).  Of course, once the Hitler/Stalin
alliance broke down the British reverted to their
usual policy of fighting the Germans until the
shedding of the very last drop of Russian blood.  

(Politics and stupidity:  Not letting Guderian finish
off the British forces at Dunkirk, but holding him
back so the Luftwaffe could practice dive-bombing;
failing to try to destroy the Royal Navy during the
Battle of Britain; failing even to attempt to seize
the North Sea; not even attempting to invade Britain
(which would have necessitated neutralizing the Royal
Navy); and opening the front against the Soviet Union
before defeating Britain.)

There\'s an Ob Traveller in here somewhere -- something
about the Fifth Frontier War, colonial forces,
Corridor Fleet ... no, it\'s Frontier Wars leading to
palace changes ... mmm damn lost it better have some
coffee.

Tying this thread to "the US is really big" thread...it\'s tough for us to
all get together.  Those that are west have a problem getting east and
vise versa.  Heck those of us southeast have a problem getting to the
upper midwest. 

What we might want to do is pick out several regional cons for us
Traveller types to concentrate on?  As a suggestion BayCon on the west
coast, GenCon in the midwest, maybe DragonCon in the south and another ??
in the northeast.  That way we could be sure of having two or three good
Traveller games at a con we might be able to attend. 

What do you think?

Eris,
    who has never been to a con, but might give it a try if he
    *knew* he\'d get a good game of Traveller out of it.

Hey, I don\'t either!  You think it\'s an occupational hazard?  <g> 

I teach computer science now, and when I do the history module for the
literacy classes I always focus on the who and what, not dates. I tell the
students that "If I put a date on the test, the answer will be false. 
Guaranteed!"  You\'d be surprised how many of my students don\'t believe
me...the first time.  <g>

Really?  "Shockwave Rider" as cyberpunk?  Hum....  I wouldn\'t have made
that connection, but I can see it.  

You know, I don\'t think "Jagged Orbit", "Stand on Zanzibar" and "Shockwave
Rider" have ever gotten the credit they deserved.  I thought Brunner was a
genius.

You may be right.  At least the figures probably exist
for the Second World War.  Did the German army or the
civilian population lose more people?  More civilians
died as a result of bombing, but more German soldiers
died from the usual variety causes in the Eastern
Front than anywhere else.

The mental image that leaps to mind is Ditzie aiming one of FS\' obscenities

Ditzie, of course, would be wearing a Santa hat.

I know very few adults who can recite the alphabet without starting to sing
it.  Also, most of us who grew up watching Saturday morning cartoons in the
70\'s can sing most of the multiplication tables.

Music is a wonderful way to learn, and it sticks things in your head.  For

Well, in my group one that gets everybody rolling is "three black
minivans."  We once played in an atrocious champions campaign where one
adventure started with all the characters noticing three black mini vans
cruising down Haight St.  Moments later, there\'s a tremendous explosion,
and the vans race back by us.  so we take off after the vans.  That isn\'t

The three suits of BattleDress are named after my Drill Sergeants.  And I\'m

pictures somewhere, as that was my Infantry OSUT company and graduation date.

Every summer, I get people on the van who ask about a "day trip" to
Disneyland.  Dinsey is 400-odd miles from San Francisco.  They really can\'t
grasp the distances involved.

The also don\'t understand that "Baywatch" is filmed in sunny Southern
California.  Or that summer is our coldest, foggiest season.  It\'s not
uncommon to drive by the cable car turn-arounds and see dozens of people in
t-shirts and shorts trying to stay warm.

Why do you think we sell more sweatshirts than t-shirts to tourists?

During the fight over the Dore Club, spokesfolk for the Women\'s Building
actually said that an Irish Pub "supported a culture of abuse" that
threatened to impede their ability to work with battered women.  That\'s
like saying that a gas station supports the drag racing culture.

Why, thank you.  But how did you _know_ I was born on 01 November?

It\'s taking me about an hour to review each week of posts, so far.

(No, classes don\'t start again until 18 January 2000.  Why do you ask?)

You mean, people actually _sing_ "Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta..."?  No
doubt, they try to make it fit the tune of "C-130 rollin\' down the
strip...."

  Also, most of us who grew up watching Saturday morning cartoons in the

My personal favorite was the Multiplication Rock for the number eight. 
It ended with the line, "Place it on its side, and its a symbol meaning
\'infinity.\'"

Assur was the dominant city-state in the area around 1800BC. This "First
Assyrian Empire" was defeated by Hammurabi in about 1755, but Assur remained
independent, though weakened, and was still independent in 1650. The third and
best known Assyrian empire starts around 900.

Sumerian Empire was about 2100 to 2000, when Ur is sacked by the Elamites.
The dominant power in Mesopotamia from about 1595 (when Babylon
falls to the Hittites) to about 1157 are the Kassites.

In 1650 you are looking at a fast-declining Babylon as the dominant power,
engaged in a series of skirmishes with the Kassites. The Babylonian king is
Abbi-ditana.

Around 1650 is near the start (or in the middle, depending which dating system
you believe) of the Hyksos dynasty - conquering tribesmen from Palestine
overthrow the Middle Kingdom and take and rule Egypt till about 1580.

Late Middle Minoan period. Current theory places the Thera explosion in 1628.

Mycenae is probably a tributary of Crete in 1650. Somewhere
between then and 1550 Mycenae starts to become more dominant, but Mycenae\'s
height is around 1300.

Labarnas I conquers Anatolia and dies around 1650. The
Hittite capital at Hattusas is founded by his son Labarnas II (aka Hattusilis)
about 1620. Hittite civilisation starts somewhere between those dates.
Hattusilis\'s son, Mursilis, sacks Babylon in about 1595, but does not occupy
it, leaving room for the Kassites.

Others:
- - in Syria, the Hurrians/Mittanians (probably they\'re a little later, say 1550)
- - in Iran, the Kassites
- - in Palestine & the Levant, chaos
- - in Iraq, mainly Babylon, also Assur
- - in Southern Iraq - Isin (King in 1650 is Gulkishar) and Larsa (King in 1650
is Tashigurumash) 

YMMV on the dates - the ranges are about right but you may see other dates for
the start/end of eras, as much as 50 yrs apart.

Peter Ustinov described Toronto as "What New York would be, if it was run by the

Yes, isn\'t it refreshing? ;)

Anyway, I know too little about Chinese and Japanese culture to make a
good argument here. Nonetheless, my point was to show that the notion of
a nation is in (again) *western Europe* a relatively recent one. The
idea of using Egypt in a comparison running over several thousand years
of human history is a wee bit off, methinks. 

I do not want to diminish the accomplishments of Chinese bureaucrats
over their several thousand years worth of history. Nonetheless, forgive
to use Europe as an example, it is the turf I know. ;)
Which brings me to a question: Tracing your lineage is good and well - I
know German families that can trace their lineage to a few hundred years
before the founding of German state - but how old is the term \'nation\'
in Chinese?
Did it exist per se, or did it need some special incentive to give the
Chinese an identity as Chinese? (Special incentive= a government bent on
seperating its citizens from all others - or, in the case of Germany,
some students wanting a unified state or some other I don\'t think of...)

From what little I\'ve read of Japanese history the Japanese people had 
a sense of their being culturally and politically different (dare I say 
superior) from everyone else well before that.

In Europe while it\'s true that the average peasant (or knight for that 
matter) didn\'t really care whether their lord was French, English or 
German, they were perfectly aware of whether they themselves were 
French, etc. Most people\'s aleigance was to their family, village and 
(maybe) lord, not their country, but they had pride in their 
"nationality" (perhaps in their culture would be a better way to put 
it).

I once had a dream in which I was singing the alphabet
backwards -- and ever since then, I\'ve been able to
recite it both forwards and backwards. (It was
probably caused by my Russian teacher (ex-US Army
Intelligence) insisting that we learn the Russian
alphabet forwards and backwards.)

I met a pianist with an amazing musical memory some
time ago.  He could play, by ear, anything that he had
heard once or twice.  He confessed that wasn\'t always
a good thing.  He said that he remembers perfectly
every note and word of "Afternoon Delight."  

Does the Silly Era page have any advertising jingles?

This seems to depend on whether the person doing the writing thinks the 
Myceneans learnt from the Minoans by being subject, or just by 
importing Minoan artisans, etc, possibly by piracy and raiding. 
Personally I go for the Myceneans being a pack of pirates who copied 
things from their betters, and took over Crete after Thera wiped out 
most of the Minoan Navy and basing.

I work with a lot of very intelligent kids.
Their main problem is that they view education as an
interuption to their social lives.
If they wiuld take it a little more seriously things would
be better for everyone.
I had one student (a particularly insepid boy with the tendency toward
trouble) proclaim
that he would be president one day and things would change in the US.
He was a bit shocked when I informed him that it would never happen while  I

All of it...?  I\'d rather not.  I\'m planning to sell some books before long
and it might come back on you.

But feel free to use parts of it, they\'re not copyrighted.  Kiri is Japanese
and means either "fog" or "paulownia tree" depending on how you write it.  I
write it using "fog".  Aradia is Tuscan and is the name of the goddess who
was the daughter of Diana and a god whom the Tuscans called Lucifer but is
pretty clearly Apollo and not the Christian Devil.  Morgan is a fairly
common last name.

In some cases, this one included, I wholeheartedly agree.

The way GURPS hands damage and armor seems a lot cleaner, and clearer, to
me.  I also like the fact that you can use the same scale from personal
all the way up to ship to ship combat.

Interesting.  Actually, I don\'t think I included Albadawi after all (I had
a lot of "personality" sidebars and never got around to him).  But by
coincidence I do have an early colony with a lot of Arab settlement.
Maybe if I need another sidebar I can include that detail in the final

I agree, and that is the goal for Gunnery IMTU, *but* just how to you
roleplay that?  No, that\'s not the question..."How do you *roll* play
that?"...that\'s closer to what I mean.

In short, what kind of mechanics could I put into a game that would
capture that feel?

How do you chop down trees with someone else\'s starship?

Oh, I didn\'t make it clear that those are names of starships,
did I.  Sorry.  They both were.

Has anyone figured out what significance such a ship
would have?

I consider myself to be a "Master Gearhead" and yet I
still prefer things like this.  I am also a "Power Player"

I never undertood that one. To quote:

"...and the workstation turns and banks along with the weapon."

Now, maybe it\'s me, but I had this crazy idea the spinal mount was so called
because it was about two hundred metres long and embedded firmly into the
spine of the ship. And if the ship turns, the weapon stations turns with it.

Can anyone throw in a plausible explanation?

Clear something up for me, please.  The Aslan male has a territorial
imperitive...they need land.  Okay, but how *much* land to they really
need?  Would a 40 acre wood be enough, or do they need a tract the size of
Rhode Island?  Would ownership of an entire moon, a tract of land on a
vacuum world, or a 100 sq km space habitat be acceptable?

suited to many such applications.  Illos of people or
places usually don\'t look good in .gif, but even very
complex line drawings look excellent in that format and
will probably download faster.

When I do graphics, I usually use Paint Shop Pro and
often save my work in both formats (as well as .psp for
later modifications) just to be able to compare them side
by side, then use whichever looks best and/or is the
smallest and delete the other one.  The disadvantage to
.gif is that it is limited to 256 colors max, but for most
things 256 colors is plenty.  For simple deck plans, 2

web display.

NOOOOOOOO!!! This is a Very Bad Plan.

Take the charcoal, place a lighted cigarette/taper/whatever on top of it,
then pour on the LOX from a remotely-triggered container.

If you pre-soak the briquettes with LOX, they explode. One charcoal
briquette soaked in LOX has explosive power roughly equivalent to a stick of
dynamite.

The entire NPC crew of the RSS Alexander E. Campbell is made up of people I
know. (In fact, the only one with a name change was the captain, and he had
his surname (Taylor) moved to forename, and his mother\'s maiden name (Bowes)
as his surname. It just sounded cooler that way.)

Yeah, although it\'s not really "punk" and is a little too optimisitic,
\'Shockwave Rider\' certainly feels like cyberpunk because of the way the
computers are used.

The fun thing about \'Shockwave Rider\' is that Brunner predicted computer
viruses, before they actually existed (though it may have been close, when
was the Internet Worm released ?), he just got the _name_ wrong, calling
them "phages", which I believe may be a much more biologically accurate
description.

It would certainly be what I\'d call "proto-cyberpunk"

There\'s a book out there called "The Tommorrow File" whose author I can
never remember,  which also has that sort of feel to it.

Combined with other things comming out of Englansd at the time, such as the
TV series "The Guardians",  and that one that starred Edward Woodward(not
\'Callan\', though that was a good series in it\'\'s own right), and "The
Analyst" starring Hwyll WhatsHisFace, I\'d say that the English "cyberpunk"
movement kicked off before the US one, much like punk itself.

Damn, now you\'ve got me free associating old UK TV Shows now, anyone
remember "Heart of Darkness"  ? And the "sequel" about BSE, which came out
before the big BSE scare ?

And "Survivors"....

> You know, I don\'t think "Jagged Orbit", "Stand on Zanzibar" and "Shockwave
> Rider" have ever gotten the credit they deserved.

I\'d put "The Sheep Look Up" over "Jagged Orbit" myself, but they are all
amazing.

Possibly I like it because of the last few lines :

Opening the door to the visiting doctor, all set to apologize for the flour
on her hands - she had been baking - Mrs. Byrne sniffed. Smoke! And if she
could smell it with her heavy head cold, it must be a tremendous fire!

"We ought to call the brigade!" she exclaimed. "Is it a hayrick?"

"The brigade would have a long way to go" the doctor told her curtly. "It\'s
from America. The wind\'s blowing that way."

> I thought Brunner was a  genius.

I agree completely. Even his knock-off potboilers such as "The Stone That
Never Came Down" and things he wouldn\'t even put his name to, such as "Into
the Slave Nebula" have a certain touch of class that very few other authors
manage.

"Slave Nebula" would make a great Trav story too, though the plot may be too
obvious for roleplayers.

This is a real problem, in my experience.  It appears that CAD programs
tend toward DXF, drawing programs tend toward CGM, and Microsoft pushes
WMF.  I\'ve run into situations werer I had to save in DXF in one program
load into another save it there as an EPS, then load into a third program
where I worked on it saving it there as a CGM.

At least three!  <g> I know they eat up space, but a BMP copy is good to
have around too.  I have to send some of my drawings through a BMP step to
get them from CGM to GIF.

Jim, if you can get your drawings into Paint, save them as GIF\'s, they
will look better.  And, yes, I know the legal downside of the GIF format.
I\'d be using PNG if I could.

It\'s a question of status. An aslan male\'s status (and the status of his
family) is directly connected to the amount of land he controls. The ihatei
owning a 40 acre wood would spend his whole life planning to get more. The
owner of Rhode Island may or may not be happy. And most male aslan would

Continuous tone images (ie: photographs) should be jpegs. Line art

about always look better in GIF unless you use minimum compression

3d rendered images can go both ways depending on how complext they
are (as they get more photo-real, they need jpeging). There are a 
few sites online that will also optimize your gifs for you to minimize
file size--they are really cool:

Tom, doesn\'t have to teach them *all* the counties!  But his
students *should* be able to look at a map of their state and pick out two
or three of the largest cities, the state capital and where they live. 
They should also know the names of their local legislators (state and
federal), Governor, and President.  They should know what the six flags
over Texas are, and why they are important. And...<g>...I better stop now.

Yeah, I was the same way.  Thing is, though, *all* the students in grade
school back in the dark ages when I was that young had to do those maps,
and recite the states and capitals, and the Presidents, and...no we didn\'t
have to do it in latin. <g>

	Basically ... it\'s for full-range images where slight variations

	But once you\'ve got PNG or GIF, you can create any other
pixel-oriented format without loss of information. Assuming, of
course, you have a conversion program. And it\'d be a very poor
program that couldn\'t handle a conversion from PNG or GIF to BMP ...

Well, if the ship turns and the weapon turns with it,
then the weapon workstation turns with the weapon and

"Yakko\'s America?"  My kids know that song off by heart too!!!
"Cheyenne is in Wyomin\' and perhaps you make your home in,
Salt Lake City out in Utah, where the buffalo roam;
Atlanta\'s down in Georgia; and there\'s Bismark North Dakota;

It\'s directly related to size of the Aslan\'s male
equipment.  The smaller the equipment, the larger the
tracts of land.  Some Aslan males are interested in
really huge tracts of land, if you know that
reference.  

Human males have a similar behavior.  There is
generally an inverse relationship between the sizes of
grav speeder and male tackle.

Cool!  Ditzie will love it!  

But then, she has battle dress armor and I don\'t, so
I\'m staying away from her barbecue.

Lawrence Sanders.  This book is quite good.  His use
of language is almost on a par with umm ... er ... the
guy who wrote Clockwork Orange.  

In the Tomorrow File, bureaucrats talk about wasting
taxpayers\' love (i.e., money); people look forward to
using each other (having sex) because such an
opportunity is a profit (any good thing).  

Sanders also wrote The Anderson Tapes, a funny but
tense movie about a criminal who becomes the head of
security of a large apartment building and then, with
his mates, burglarizes it.  Sean Connery plays the
lead in the movie version.

number of modules for AD&D, Battle Tech, Mech Warrior, Twilight 2000, Merc
2000 and of course Traveller that have been played at the con. I also won
"Best Role Player" for two different modules. Lots of fun for all. They also
have huge stacks of Out Of Print (OOP) stuff for sale in the vendor\'s area.

(SFX: game show buzzer) Wrong.

The original short story, "Roller Ball Murder", by William Harrison, was
first published in the September, 1973, issue of Esquire magazine. In 1974,
the publisher William Morrow & Company published a collection of Harrison\'s
short stories under the title of Roller Ball Murder; it was reprinted in
paperback in 1975 by Warner with the cover title Rollerball, presumably to
tie in with the movie, which was in current release at the time. There are
a total of 13 stories in the book; I have a copy of the paperback edition.
The title is currently Out Of Print.

Actually, "cyberpunk" wasn\'t coined until about the time of William 
Gibson\'s novel Neuromancer, but there are elements in The Shockwave
Rider that would later become identified with cyberpunk SF.

  Two million civilians vs 4.5 million military; at a wild guess
~80% of the violent civilian deaths were bombing related, and
military deaths from strategic bombing would be a few % at best
(but significant in several respects).

Since there have been objections raised (both publicly
and privately), I\'m going to assign the job of deciding what
the parameters for a commerce raider should be to Black
ICE.  The rest of you feel free to chime in and help Black
ICE out.  Black ICE, when you get the text of the THUDDD
11 announcement completed, let me know and I\'ll
announce them and post them to the web.

Do you accept?

Not true. India was not invaded until 1944 because it had
no place in the Japanese strategic plan in 1942. Even if
they had, it is extremely unlikely it would have succeeded.
Australia was not saved by too much water and too many
US ships. The Japanese did not invade Australia because
they could not spare the 12 divisions they considered
neccessary to take it (weither those 12 divisions would
have in fact been sufficent is another matter entirely). In
1942, the USN would have been utterly incapable of
stopping a determined Japanese thrust on Australia,
and both the Japanese and US knew it.

Take a look at a map. Measure the distance from Norway
and France to the Orkneys. This is why the Germans did
not attempt to attack the Home Fleet. Any German invasion
of Britian would have failed because they could not
neutralise the Home Fleet beforehand. Likewise any attempt
to gain control of the North Sea was also doomed.

I surely do.

My plans are to accept suggestions for THUDDD 11 for the next two weeks
(24 Dec 99 - 07 Jan 00).  I will keep the two ISBA lists apprised of
what proposals are on the table.  Depending on the feedback I receive, I
will submit the final wording of the proposal to the THUDDD Coordinator
on 12 Jan 00 (the day the THUDDD 10 results are scheduled to be
announced).  The THUDDD Coordinator will then be free to publish the
THUDDD 11 specifications and timeline on the THUDDD Web site as fits his
schedule.

Are there any problems with this procedure?

BTW, for the long run, we need to decide which ISBA mailing list is
preferred (ISBA@goldinc.com or ISBA@oasis.leo.com).  Major announcements
should be made to both lists, and to the TML as well, but discussions of
future THUDDDs should probably be kept to one of the two ISBA lists. 
(Until we make a decision on which list to use, I\'ll post any THUDDD 11
material I receive to both ISBA lists.)

Since this _is_ a major posting, it\'s crossposted to both ISBA lists,
and to the TML.  Sorry about subscribers receiving multiple posts, but
that\'s the nature of the beast for major announcements.  (That\'s why I
think we should settle on one ISBA list or the other.)

I have mentioned that I use Paint Shop Pro.  One of the
things I got with the PSP CD was Animation Shop.  I
have used it for some beautiful animations, but more
importantly it can be used to optimize your gifs, even if
they are only one frame.

CompuServe used some compression codes that were owned by, HP I think. 
CompuServe has basically said anyone that wants can use the GIF format,
but HP is less generous, no that\'s not fair.  Let\'s just say they don\'t
want their intellectual property to be public domain.
 
As I understand it, folks that write programs that implement the GIF
format need to get a licence.  I don\'t know if it costs anything, but
there is some feeling against even a no-cost licence.  The other shoe, so
to speak, is the rumored (or real) assersion that any GIF\'ed file posted
on the internet must have been produced by a licenced program or it\'s
removal can be forced.

I don\'t think any of this is a concern for non-commerical use, but this
has been perking along in the background for several years. 

PNG is partly an effort to replace GIF with an open system without the
baggage of GIF.  I don\'t know a lot about PNG\'s licencing status, but I
suspect it\'s GPL.  Those that like it, seem to like it a lot..like Linux. 
<g> 

If all the browsers and paint/drawing programs would support it we could
move on to it, but...

  The main battles of the Civil War were smaller (~40-45K vs ~60 for the
Boyne) but the ECW had multiple campaigns operational simultaneously, and
more troops pinned down in positional operations.

  English rule in Ireland might have been ended, but not even the most
disastrous outcome (short of his personal neutralization) could have
lost him England; in addition to command of the sea (certainly the Irish
Sea under any foreseeable circumstances) he had a substantial supply of
revenues, arms, men, and plenty of political capital.

  What he wouldn\'t have had was a long window of opportunity before the
Continent required his full attention, thus preventing a prolonged war
for the (re-)conquest of Ireland.

  Whoa! This is about England, not a bunch of South Sea islands! If the
Brits had really thought of the Japs as a prime threat, they might not
have failed to renew their turn-of-the-century treaty with them. [ :) ]

  The Japs disagreed, volubly, at Java Sea :)  Seriously, the Army had
real serious concerns about plunking themselves down in Oz; endless
distance to soak up men and materiel that would have been in very short 
for the sorts of campaigns that an island-continent promised. Admittedly,
the Near East & Africa were perhaps a sign of how poorly British tech &
generalship were ready for modern warfare :|

  Scapa Flow is safe from air attack (and subs too! :> ), so #1 is flat
out impossible. Arguably, so is #2, thanks. #3 would of just been plain
suicide, although if you posit that _everything_ goes right and the Brits
lost their nerve once any German landings sort of vaguely consolidated at
the locations where they would be starved out, then you could have a case
about as plausible as some of Mr. Turtledove\'s more desperate mortgage
paymen^h^h novels.

  Well, the UK led the civilian aircraft industry in the inter-war years,
although the USG did undercut that by carefully stacking US civ-aviation
regs so that the inferior domestic products could dominate the market.
Also, the UK lost many of its foreign markets of all sorts due to the
necessities of directing all possible output to war use.

  It\'s commonly argued (and widely accepted) that - intentionally or not -
post-war repayments of the UK\'s debts and import/export requirements were
scheduled to the disadvantage of the UK\'s position in world markets; the
question remains as to whether this was a deliberate US policy.

  As the US did everything possible to force its erstwhile allies to dis-
gorge their colonial empires in the interests of free trade (while at the
least maintaining if not extending their own informal empire) it would
hardly seem unreasonable to assume that it was, in fact, deliberate.

  FWIW, it seems unlikely that the war in Vietnam could have been fought
against the sort of backlash that would have resulted if the sons of the
politically active classes had been the ones being conscripted. Hmm,
conscription if necessary, but not necessarily conscription - maybe some
of the Yanks learned something from King!?

Needless to say, Guam is not one of the united States, it
is a territory.  Are you saying that the Channel Islands are
a British territory or should I say a territory of the United
Kingdom?

Come now, Leonard, I said that the Terran goverment of 1109 was BOUND by a
decision made by the "World Court" (whatever that may have been) a few years
after -2030. How many decisions made by the Roman Senate is legally binding
on the US government today? I think a little more continuity than between
the codes of Hammurabi and the laws of the US is implied, don\'t you?

cons IN STATE. Fairbanks is a 7 hour drive at highway speed limits, or a
$250 flight, from Anchorage; To/From Juneau is around $450 for anchorage,
about $100 more for fairbanks. Going to seattle can get as low as $295 one
way, sometimmes specials put it at about $350 round trip... but, for
example, Baycon means one of the following options:
1) Fly to seattle ($400 RT), and greyhound to the Bay Area. 3 hour flight,
1.5 day greyhound trip ($70 each way, IIRC). Total travel expenses:$540,
plus 4 days, plus bus or cab to/from greyhound terminal and airport.
2) Fly to SF (IIRC, SD is close to SF), for about $900 RT.
3) Military & Dependants MIGHT be able to catch a hop, and reduce travel to
$30 per person. But, you might also get stuck somewhere in between.
4) Military Persons (and dependants) can go through SATO, and get tickets
for about 2/3rds cost.
5) Drive the AlCan Highway. 3-5 days travel to seattle. Food, Fuel,
Lodgings all the way down. Plus, often, a new tire.

It is really difficult to get affordable airfares out of anchorage. And
remember, those are just TRAVEL costs, not including accomodations,
admissions, food, etc.

Here\'s one I can attest to: At UAA, less than 10% of persons taking GEOG
205 (Elements of Physical Geography) can accurately place more than half of
the major landform items on the test at the start of the class. Less than
10% can place more than 9 of 10 at the end of the semester. Some of the
items include the following:

The Pyrinees Mountains
The Rockies
The Orinoko R
The Nile R
The Danube R
The Dnieper R
The Amazon Basin
The Straits of Magellen and Hormuz
The Iberian Peninsula
The continents, and the 7 Oceans.
The Himalayan Mountains
The Ohio River
The Ils of Manhattan, Hawaii, Madagascar, New Zealand.
Accuracy is 1/4 inch on a 8.5x11 landscape sized Mercator projection. All
the rivers are already drawn, just label them; the mountain ranges likewise.

Many of the students put NZ in Malaysia. The worst error I\'ve seen was the
gent who put NZ  on Japan\'s southern island, or his study partner who put
it on Madagascar. (I\'ll admit, on the pretest, I did get NZ wrong... but
put confused it with the Island of Tasmania.)n I got a 93% on the Pretest,
and a 97% on the post test... I\'d probably hit about 75% now.

I\'ve graded for this class, and did so for several years (4 years, in fact,
for 3 Proffessors).

Ob Trav: I doubt that, even with the 2D large scale space maps, most
imperials would be able to accurately name more than the worlds in the
local subsector. or the subsectors that are either adjacent to their home
SS or in their home sector. Heck, given a hex number, half my players can\'t
find Wypoc! Even being told it\'s J2 from Regina. And regina is prominent in
my campaigns.

They have better aircraft, and they do fly them.

Though I don\'t see why you\'re holding up the DC10 for comparison, it was a
crap plane, a complete maintenance nightmare, and not particualry nice for
passengers either.

Do you know how often the doors fell off those things ?

Thing is, US manufacturers have been so heavily subsidizd by the US military
paying $3000 each for a plastic washer,  they can afford to flood the
market, sell at a loss and force most of the other aircraft manufacturers
out of business.

And because the concept of free trade is alien to the so-called "land of the
free", they had no competition in the domestic market.

China doesn\'t fly America planes. Neither does India to any great extent.
Only the two most populous countries on earth.

Well, as far as "Roll Play", replace all the crew skills in to hit rolls
with computer based numbers. Then have the gunnery skill tasks be "Threat
Evaluation Tasks", like this one:

To evaluate threat presentations: Difficult, Gunnery, Int, Combat Task. On
Success, use standard hit tasks. On Fail, increase difficulty by one on
defense tasks and fire tasks. On Critfail, no fire at chosen target. On
Crit Success, you\'ve put the PIL on the AIL (PIL: Probable Intercept
Location, AIL: Actual Intercept Location).

I\'ve previously posted figures for figuring out shots to gaurantee
intercept of 1 shot of a voley of size X. Really, Traveller long ranges
should be based upon Gunnery and Intuition... Unfortunately, there is no
INTU stat in Traveller... and the calcs, at longer ranges, get horrendously
high shots required. CT was the worst. TNE wasn\'t bad there, but was rather
generous.

Wild Ride? If the gunnery station is at either end of the weapon, you\'ll be
near the furthest reaches of a ship which is pitching and yawing to bring
your spinal gun into arc. Also, most spinal weapons are going to have
either magnetic and/or gravitic accelerations, which undoubtedly WILL leak.
Do I buy this? Not really. Why? Spinal mounts are fired from the Bridge
(Supp 5, AHL).

Guam isn\'t a state. It\'s a territory. Just like Puerto Rico, except for the
continental pressure to become a state and quite sopping funds like a cat
with milk. The RPR and Guam both have a single, non-voting rep in congress;
he does count for the electoral college, IIRC. The American Virgin Islands,
and American Samoa also are Territories. Citizens of the Territories are US
citizens, pay US income Tax, carry US passports, etc... they just don\'t
really THINK of themselves as US citizens. Alaska has only been a State
since about 1958 (+ or - 2 years)... the Territorial attitude is slowly
going away as the sourdoughs die off, or retire to florida....

I did some research on the Chanell Is. when setting up an Ars Magica game
on them. From what I\'ve read, they were, at the time, crown dependancies of
the Duchy of Normandy (in abeyance itself due to the majority of the land
having returned to French control); they are not part of England, but are
considered to be part of Great Brittain (and the UK, as well, but that is
more expansive a term, IIRC). They are closer to the mainland of Europe,
however, than to the Isle of Brittain. Beautiful, Rugged, and not ttotally
spoiled by mankind.... yet. It said they have 2 seats in commons (One
gurnsey and one for the other local gov\'t), and share one lords seat. IIRC,
it also mentioned that some or all of the seats were non-voting, but had a
voice. The books was from the 60\'s, though.

Ob Trav? just look at all the subordinate worlds in any system... how will
they be percieved in the 3I? IMTU, if they are OWNED, then they are members
as part of their owning world\'s membership. If independant, then they are
ellgible (or interdictable) on their own.) Local attitudes may vary.

Here\'s a scenario idea:
The PC\'s are on a subordinate (and owned) world when it rebells against the
mainworld, and then asks the noble in the party to relay their request to
the Imp Rep for separate membership in the Imperium... (I have used this
once, a long time ago...)

Well:

1) In the legend of Theseus, Mycenaean Athens is specifically described as a
tributary of Crete.
2) The first sophisticated buildings in Mycenae appear at this time, which
gives about 300 years of city life before the Mycenae becomes significant on
the international stage
3) There was certainly trade at this time (or maybe raiding, but see the next
point) since it can be proven that finds from Mycenae originated in Crete (type
of clay)
4) Mycenae is inland, making it an unlikely base for piracy. Its strength,
which is pretty obvious if you go there, is that you can see a long way in any
direction across the surrounding hills. There were a number of other
significant city states in the area at the time (Tiryns, Pylos, Thebes) and its
geographical strengths allowed it to dominate them. But while that was going on
there was probably tribute to the local superpower (Crete). That doesn\'t mean
that Mycenae was actually part of the Minoan empire though.

        From the military prospective....  you own the land that the grunt
with your shoulder flashes is standing on.  Even if he is standing on the
bodies of another platoon of grunts to get him there.  Unpleasant, but true.

        So, yes, if you care about the outcome of the battle or war, than
that *is* the really important thing.

        I use the copy to clipboard function and then paste the image into
Photoshop for saving as a GIF or JPG.  I am running v6.033, JFYI.  Take a
look at my AD&D site (URL below) if you want to see some examples of whole
maps done JPG\'d that way...  I am going to start using PNG, though, as the
JPG process is not kind to detail work.

        You are aware of the CC2 mailing list, yes?  Lots of cool tips and
tricks and folks bantering "how-to\'s" back and forth.  If you have questions

Nope. CompuServe used LZW compression which is patented. I don\'t know who
filed the original patent, but it\'s currently owned by Unisys.

See http://www.unisys.com/unisys/lzw/

Yes.

It depends. License fees, are always negotiable. It just depends on
whether or not you can make Unisys notice that you exist.

Pure bullshit. The process is patented, not the results of the process.

If I write code that implements LZW compression (jn ANY form, not just GIF
image compression) than I need a UNISYS license. However, if I can create a 
valid GIF file without using LZW (it is possible, though not totally desirable)
then I\'m ok.

It\'s akin to a patent on a cheese production process. The patent is not on 
_cheese_, it\'s on the process. Though patenting cheese would be cool. :)

Yes, with lots of rabid, tunnel-visioned devotees. GIF is way too popular
to either throw out or replace. The patent will run out eventually, just be
patient. :)

Have you tried Metacreation\'s Poser?  Very nice human modeling program.
Has horse, dog & Raptor figures as well.  There is also a MAC version.
You can vary skin tones and morph figures.

The MIT students can read, it\'s just that they are usually too stressed to

I have faith the Harvard students too.  When the offer letters start coming

Well, the Internet Worm was in 1988, but computer viruses existed ong
before that. An article I read a long time ago in Scientific American
about computer viruses, described one written on an Apple II, designed to
spread under DOS 3.3 (Apple DOS 3.3 no relation to MS DOS anything) which
would date it to the late 70\'s early 80\'s.

PC Virii existed before then, as well.

The Internet worm:

http://www.software.com.pl/newarchive/misc/Worm/darbyt/pages/worm.html

Was remarkable in that it was the first virus to actively use security
holes in networkable OS\'es to use the internet to propagate itself.

Note, this was over ten years _before_ Melissa did, essentially, the same
thing. If ever there was proof that MS\'s programmers fundamentally Don\'t
Get It, this would be it.

Yes, the Kanji (Oh, damn it\'s been almost 20 years since my Japanese
class...be gentle with me Kiri:-) were borrowed wholesale from China quite
some time ago, when Japan went through a period of feeling inferior to
China. Katakana and Hirigana are home grown alphabets, and are a phonetic 
system (they\'re related to each other like printed and cursive are in

Once the shooting starts, that\'s the most important thing.  You get out of
the Army\'s way and let it do its job, which is breaking things and hurting
people.

The current demand from the American public that military be some sort of
adventure camp, with every death met by horrendous outcry, disturbs me.
What soldiers do is *dangerous.*  Some of them a re going to die, or come
home in wheelchairs, or just emotionally scared.  Rather than trying to
sugarcoat the service, people should focus on making sure that the veterans
get taken care of adequately.

There was an episode recently of "The west Wing" in which one of the White
House staffers was called out to the Korean War Memorial because his
business card had been found in the jacket of a dead homeless man.  Turns
out the man had been giving an old coat the staffer had donated years back.

The staffer, an ex-Marine, recognizes a tattoo on the dead man\'s arm, and
realizes that he is also a Marine.  After a little searching, he discovers
that the man\'s only living relative is a developmentally disabled brother,
who is also homeless.  The staffer uses the President\'s name to get an
honor guard and a slot in Arlington. 

The President calls him to task for this, saying that "all the homeless
vets will come out of the woodwork now."

The response?  "Mr. President, I pray they do."

Not really. Gateway primarily bought Amiga to develop set-top boxes whe it
appeared that they were the Next Great Thing 

(before ol\' Steve \'iCEO for Life\' Jobs really did finally nail the Next
Great Thing, the iMac...witness the number of different, cute,
fruit-colored, all-in-one systems being introduced by PC makers this
Christmas, after all of them publically laughed and said the iMac wouldn\'t
ever sell..\'it doesn\'t even have a floppy drive!\')

Since then rumor has swirled around unabated, and generally unsullied by
fact, Amiga is coming out with a great upgrade, no they\'re turning them
into Linux boxes, no they\'re something else entirely, no they\'re what
TransMeta _really_ is, etc. etc. etc.

One interesting rumor concerning Gateway is that back when Apple was
licencing clones, Gateway was this > < close to becoming a licensee. but
this was just as iCFL Jobs was coming on board, and the deal fell through.

Too bad. Gateway could have probably avoided the problems the other Mac
cloners had, which was that they didn\'t grow the Mac market share, only
ate into Apple\'s. 

Gateway had a lot more market mindshare than Umax, Daystar or Power
Computing _ever_ did, combined, and they had it _outside_ the Mac market.

A big-league second-tier PC maker like Gateway could have pushed Macs a
lot farther into the mainstream market than any of them, which is what
Apple wanted, and what the cloners failed to do.

Maps kept me off a work detail in basic training!

One fine Sunday at Ft. Lost-in-the-Woods, when we saw the rakes piled
outside the drill sergeants\' office, everyone in my platoon was Touched
by the Holy Spirit... except for me.  (I figured that going to church
_just_ to get out of a work detail would be unethical.)

Well, they wouldn\'t _force_ me to go, so the drill sergeant who had to
stay back at the barracks with me taught me to read military maps (grid
coordinates and all that), which was the sceduled training for that
Sunday afternoon.  Well, as a long-time gamer, I was already familiar
with the concepts involved, and it was just a matter of learning the
specifics of the grid coordinate system in use.

From then on, whenever our platoon was training on map reading, I was
used as an assistant instructor....

Even now, in gaming sessions, my signature line is "Let\'s take a look at
the map."  (I even recorded a .wav file of me saying that, so that I
could have my computer say it for me during gaming sessions.)

*Please* avoid GIF, at least as an *output* format for *new* programs.
You have to pay royalties to Unisys because of their (IMO) *Highly*
unethical (but legal) behavior in filing for a patent on LZW
compression and then *publishing* the algorithm with nary a mention of
the fact. This resulted in it being used in a lot of things, including

Some cheery Christmas statistics from John Keegan\'s Second World War:

Germany: 4 to 4.5 million battle deaths (variation due to missing and POWs
not returning from Russia).  Civilians:  593,000 dead in allied bombing.
1.5 million (approx) dead during early 1945 winter evacuation from eastern
territories and from Red Army advance.

Britain: 244,000 battle deaths. 60,000 civilians dead from aerial bombardment.

Commonwealth battle deaths:  23,000 Australian, 37,000 Canadian, 24,000
Indian,
10,000 New Zealand, 6,000 South African.  No major civilian losses.

American battle deaths:   292,000 battle deaths.  No major civilian losses.

Soviet Union:  ~7 million battle deaths.  ~7 million civilian deaths
(mostly Ukrainian and White Russian, dead from deprivation, reprisal and
forced labor).

France:  200,000 battle deaths, 400,000 civilian deaths (mix of allied and
German air attack and German concentration camps).

Greece:  250,000 dead (civil war accounts for many).

Yugoslavia:  1,000,000 dead (civil war and anti-guerilla reprisals)

Italy: 330,000 dead, half civilian.

Holland: 10,000 battle dead, 190,000 civilian dead (bombing and Nazi camps).

Poland:  6 million dead (no civ/mil. mix listed, but half were those Jews
killed in the death camps; Jewish deaths were also a high proportion of
other civilian deaths throughout occupied Europe).

Japan:  260-500,000(?) civilian deaths (mostly strategic bombing or
privation, but 70-160,000 dead at Okiniwa...), 1.2 million battle deaths.

Can\'t find figures for China and other Asian countries; they were very high
as (in China\'s case) the war started before 1939 and for many nations (as
in Greece and Yugoslavia) warfare continued well after 1945. As a direct
result of Japanese invasion + occupation rather than civil war, probably
1-3 million in China.  Total war dead from WWII:  about 50 million.

High UV=dark skin, low UV=light skin is not a human universal even on
earth.  Check out, for example, Tasmania.

This was nicely explained by Jared Diamond in, IIRC, "The Third
Chimpanzee". Part of his argument was that skin colour is part of a complex
of genes, which means that (a) other factors may \'override\' UV radiation,
and (b) if you lack the gene(s) that produce high (or low) melanin levels
then there is nothing for evolution to work with.

So having dark-skinned Vilani from a low-UV star is entirely possible, IMHO.

Odd, I always thought it was based on a short story called "Rollerball". I
think the author was Harrison (not Harry, but someone else) but I could be

	Sorry, but Linux just isn\'t ready as a prime-time user operating
system. Expert\'s \'toy,\' powerserver, dedicated box, yes. But Joe
Public won\'t give it the time of day. And yes, I am slowly learning
Linux, with the goal of using it as a server and firewall. But I
don\'t expect to drop Winblows for a while, because I still need to be
able to get work done, and there\'s just too steep a learning curve to
Linux.

Just say that the ability to make those "good guesses" *is* (human)
gunnery skill. Just as the (computer) gunnery "skill" in gunnery
programs lies in being able to do a better job of tracking down "all"
possibilities.

Pretty good analogy, but I\'d Guam:USA as Falklands:UK,

As to any of those islands, the mother country ought
not to be nonchalant about a foreign invasion, which

Or those of us that have spent a good bit of time walking through hills
and hollows.  In some parts of the US, knowing where, and how, to ford a
branch is still an important skill.  But, heck, I bet most of you have
never seen a small stream called a branch!  <g>

<rant>

First off, it ain\'t a toy.  There are serious commercial programs being ported to Linux now every day.  This wouldn\'t be happening if it wasn\'t ready for prime time.  I\'ve got a couple of those commercial applications installed and I use them.  They work just as good, if not a bit better, than their Windoze versions.

2nd, with the use of a graphical interface and a bit of teaching, Linux is *very* user-friendly.  Both KDE and the GNOME interface have done a lot to make things better.  But even command-line Linux is useable.  People used DOS before Windoze came out.  There is no more or less of a learning curve between command line Linux & DOS, it\'s just a *different* curve from what you\'re used to.  You\'ll have to unlearn some stuff to relearn how to do it in Linux.

3rd, it installs a lot easier now, particularly the SuSE, Red Hat, & Caldera distributions.  I haven\'t played with Slackware in ages, so I couldn\'t tell you how well that installs.

</rant>

However, there *is* a dearth of decent software for Traveller for Linux.

I\'m pretty sure I kept a copy, and if I did I\'ll

This is a very good analysis.  

Most of Fifth Frontier War consists of the Imperium
trying not to lose.  Eventually, if the Outworld
Coalition does not win and the Imperium starts pushing
them back, the Sword Worlds and Vargr players have to
figure out how not to lose.  The Zhodani is not in
danger of losing, but if he has not won by about turn
40, he\'s not going to.

Booth killed Lincoln in 1865, just after the war was
over.  Lincoln did not have time to set up the iron
thumb (although his field commanders, occupying the
south, did not have any trouble doing so on their
own).  

Reconstruction, the era of heavy-handed northern
control (and much carpet-bagging), continued until
1877.

Your comment "when Lincoln died" is rather bland. 
John Wilkes Booth, a confederate, assassinated him to
get revenge for the south.  He did not act alone, but
so far as I have read, the conspiracy of which he was
part did not extend up to even the lower branches of
any government (Union, Confederate, or foreign).

The total number of US Merchant Marine (my father\'s
WW2 service, by the way) was very small compared to
any one of the armed forces (but I don\'t remember the
number).  They lost a large percentage of that small
number, but the total number is dwarfed by number of,
e.g., naval personnel lost.

The use of merchant shipping to carry supplies is
probably very important in the Far Future, but
logistics is not a prominent feature of Fifth Frontier
War (and I haven\'t read the rules of Imperium, which I
own).

	You\'re right, and I apologize for making light of it. However, I
stand by the rest of my post. Aside from a relatively small group of
"enlightened" desktop users, scientific powerusers, and server
admins, Linux *still* is not ready for the vast masses to joyfully
strike off the chains of Microsloth and take up their birthright.
Yes, there are commercial programs being ported to Linux; even my
favorite game (Civilization). But when I said "prime-time user
operating system" I meant just that. The millions of users who can
barely put a Winblows CD in, run Setup, take all the defaults and
open up AOL.

>2nd, with the use of a graphical interface and a bit of teaching,
Linux is *very* user-friendly.  Both KDE and the GNOME interface have
done a lot to make things better.  But even command-line Linux is
useable.  People used DOS before Windoze came out.  There is no more
or less of a learning curve between command line Linux & DOS, it\'s
just a *different* curve from what you\'re used to.  You\'ll have to
unlearn some stuff to relearn how to do it in Linux.

	I never denied this. What I said is I don\'t have the *time* to
abandon all that I know and leap into something new ... and I *am*
making the effort, which I doubt most of the \'masses\' will. In fact,
I\'m deliberately starting with command line Linux precisely because
*I* want to know what\'s going on under the hood.

>3rd, it installs a lot easier now, particularly the SuSE, Red Hat, &
Caldera distributions.  I haven\'t played with Slackware in ages, so I
couldn\'t tell you how well that installs.

	RH6.0 installs fairly easily, both on a 486 and P100. And it runs a
*hell* of a lot faster on the P100 than Winblows 2000 (although to be
honest it was an early release candidate).

	I didn\'t mean to make light of or deny the superiority of Linux. I\'m
trying to learn it myself, I have a sub to Linux Journal, and I fully
intend to use it in a \'production\' environment. And I am rooting like
dickens it plays 1,000lb penguin to Bill\'s 800lb gorilla.

	But its very flexibility and power are still standing in the way.
Yes, the install is much better. But it *still* won\'t meet your
average, non-Unix, non-computer literate user\'s ability level. I\'ve
managed to get Samba and DHCP up and running, and hope to tackle PPP
and DNS soon, followed by IP masquerading and IP chains. Compare that
to checking a single checkbox in W2K.

	Or setting up printers ... that\'s a task I\'m putting off until much
later (partly because my printer just died, and partly because I
still get queasy just trying to read through the description in
"Running Linux") And I won\'t even get into the Redhat vs SuSe vs
Caldera/gcc vs egcs/libc5 vs glibc/Gnome vs KDE/etc./etc. issues. Do
you *really* think your average user is going to be able to sort that

It\'s not such a contradiction.  Canada is not
militarist.  For example, militarism includes a
tendency to engage in military adventures for the
adventurers\' own benefit (like taking over Greenland,
say) and some permeation of culture and government by
the military (like in Indonesia).  

In addition, military preparedness is one factor in
ensuring peace, hardly a militaristic goal.  Canada
also seems to have a commitment to participating in
the world of which it is part (unlike the USA, which
fluctuates between isolationism and bullying), and
military activities are part of that.  

>ObTrav: what small, quiet border states muster

In my Traveller Universe, the 4518th always has a
significant number of volunteers from Menorb, which
has had a "special relationship" with Regina since
Regina invaded it a long time ago.  (See the article
on the 4518th in JTAS.)  Menorbian veterans of the
4518th also figure prominently in many mercenary units
operating in the Marches.  

The Darrians also provide a lot of forces.  Fifth
Frontier War includes a TL-16 mercenary unit, which in
my Traveller universe is a Darrian unit lent to the
Imperium.

Didn\'t everybody (in the US, anyway) have to learn to
read USGS topographical maps in 9th grade Earth
Science?  Or was my Earth Science teacher (who was, by
the way, named Mr. Branch -- Col., USAF, ret.), who
went over that subject until all of us got it, really
as crazy as everyone said?  

Fording the San Joaquin in the high Sierras last
summer was an enjoyable challenge.  I think I\'m
getting a pair of neoprene kayaking shoes to wear as
camp shoes and for river/stream/creek crossings.  So
far as I know, we don\'t call them branches in the
west.

No doubt, the original world\'s atmospheric taint was a low concentration
of nitrous oxide.  You\'d want to have a "dedicated masker", someone who
keeps his/her/its filter mask on while the other celebrants are
cavorting, and puts filter masks on celebrants who keel over.

Now, transplant these folks to a world where the taint is _nitric_
oxide.  OUCH!

Being slightly fanciful, I liken it to pre-Virus and post-Virus systems.

Pre-Virus, ie Windows, was almost fully automated and just about *anyone*
could push a few buttons, tell the computer where they wanted to go and it
would take them there.  You concentrated on *where* you wanted to go and
*what* you\'d do when you got there. You didn\'t need to worry much about
*how* you got there.  Very convenient, but whoa is you if the system
crashes, because you really don\'t know how it works and your idea of
fixing it is to reinstall everything.

Post-Virus, ie DOS/Linux, was much less automated.  The user had to
interact much more with the systems, telling what, where and how to do
everything.  Sure everything is harder and often takes longer the first
time, but if you can learn it you end up with a lot more control and can
often find a way to make things work even when things go badly wrong.

Because, as BillyBoy said at the end of \'Pirates of Silicon Valley\':
"People don\'t _care_ about quality!"

Sadly, still true.

Yes, the Amiga was quite a powerful system. What killed it (as someone
pointed out in an earlier post) was that everyone expected a faster,
bigger Commodore 64 and what they got was something almost completely
different.

That and the people running Commodore at that point apparently couldn\'t
sell food to a starving rich man, let alone a revolutionary computer.

    Excuse me? Lincoln was for immediate re-integration of the Southern
states into the Union with voting Senators and Representatives as soon as
possible and near-immediate return of state government.  His party,
led by the clique known as the "Black Republicans", opposed him in this.
With Lincoln\'s assassination, Johnson attempted to follow Lincoln\'s intent,
but lost the struggle with Congress and barely retained his presidency.
The result was nearly a full generation of carpet-bagger and/or military
rule of the Southern states. The South "lost" rather than "not-winning" in
either case, but Lincoln\'s death/Johnson\'s failure upped the ante of that
loss significantly.

ObTrav: The Sword Worlds/Border Worlds situation post-5FW results in
some worlds losing, some just not winning, and some worlds, perhaps,
winning politically/economically when the Sword Worlds lost militarily
since some individual worlds improved in those categories as members
of the Border Worlds.

number of USSR deaths has climbed: Stalin said it was
7 million, Krushchev 17 million, Gorbachev 27 million.
Note that at the levels of millions of deaths you
don\'t get well-documented, named corpses. ALl you can
do is say, what was the population pre-war, and what
was the population afterwards, how many are missing?
The tendency has been for the soviets to attribute
many of the deaths of the purges and mass deportations
(eg of the Chechens) of the 30s to the war.

Civilian vs military deaths: over the years, the ratio
has been at least ten to one for any lengthy conflict
in which the lands of the nations involved were fought
on. This has been pretty much constant from at least
medieval times.

George Goble, here at Purdue Univ. in W. Lafayette, IN.  Website is:
http://ghg.ecn.purdue.edu
if anyone wants to see pictures.
Last time George did it was 1997.  The 1994 BBQ, where they pretty
much vaporised, not just melted, the grille, 5 gallons of LOX was used.
The normal, actually functional, amounts are about 60 pounds of charcoal
and 3 gallons of LOX.  Bit more than a cupful, I\'m afraid.
Damn fascist fire department....grin.

True, but since the con in question is BayCon (in San Jose), that was
probably a typo on his part.  And yes, San Jose is reasonably close to
San Francisco (about an hour or so south, IIRC).

  The vast majority of losses would have been on British-flagged ships,
and I found a figure of 30K for that, but with no breakdown by crew
nationalities. The figure for Canadian merchant marine deaths is ~1000+.

Sounds like the original post was more cynical than that.

What matters most in the war is that your people be the last people
standing. Even if that means suckering someone else into making
a pile of their own dead on your behalf (Russia for England\'s WW2
benefit, Taiwan\'s current apparent willingness to fight mainland China
to the last drop of American blood...). 

A noisome kind of praticality to that. As long as your "friends" are OK 
with the idea.

Score one for Doug! Spellings of non-english names will often differ from
atlas to atlas. Not to mention the fact that I am dyslexic enough to have
to sound things out, memorize by spoen name, and then try to recreate the
spelling from sound. And to think, this dyslexic, ADHD, who nearly flunked
out his 9th grade year, is now a substitute teacher, has a BA in History
(With honors in history - member Phi Alpha Theta, Alpha Beta Gamma
Chapter), and reads voraciously.

  As stated, we may never know for sure. Clearly, however, the 7 million
figure was laughably low, and we can only conclude that Stalin did not 
want to advertise widely just how badly weakened the Soviet Union was.

Wales

Nope. The Falklands are a protectorate or something similar.
And the Channel Islands and the Orkney\'s aren\'t part of Britain either.

The Orkney\'s are however part of the United Kingdom.<grin>

The US _also_ had a treaty obligation to provide military assistance to the
UK when Argentina invaded the Falklands,  and Thatcher kept reminding Reagan
of that.

As it was the US did the best they could to stay on-side with the other
American nations by not actually
comitting troops to attack Argentina, thereby breaking both treaties

They also provided intelligence to the UK as they were required to do under
a completely seperate treaty.

BTW, quite a lot of the military intelligence the UK used in that scrap came
from their own resources, including several SAS teams that spent most of the
war _inside_ Argentina, giving early warning of aircraft waves launched from
Argentine bases.

Not that the US cares about those upholding treaties when it really wants to
act, as can be seen from the Bay of Pigs, to the invasion of Grenada, and
it\'s actions in Columbia, Venezuala, Chile, and El Salvador.

Actually, this is incorrect.

George Washington, or Adam Weishaupt, as he was known in Bavaria,  cared not

Hey, the government of El Salvador _wanted_ our advisors!  (You may be
thinking of US support of the Contras in Nicaragua.  That was screwed
up, no matter _how_ you look at it.  On-again, off-again, with side
trips selling military hardware to Iran for the money to turn Contra
support on-again, when Congress had turned it off-again....)

We _even_ cut off air support to the Cuban exiles in the Bay of Pigs,
mere hours before they landed!

And Columbia is a city in Missouri!  AFAIK, the Federal government has
no _treaty_ obligations with Missouri.  (Yes, I _know_ you were
referring to Colombia in South America.)

Uhhhh...I think you got me on a couple of the others, though....  ;-)

Obviously, each world has its own Santa designate...

As for today, it\'s easy to explain how he covers the world. If you look at
the Christmas traditions of non-English-speaking cultures, you\'ll find that
his delivery day is *not* Christmas Eve! Eg, in Germany, he comes on December
6th. (My mother came from Germany to Canada when she was 19, several years
before I came along, but I was raised with German Christmas traditions.)
I read recently that in Guatemala, he comes on the 25th (and the kids don\'t
get to open their presents until New Years arrives.) Meanwhile, for the
entire Eastern Orthodox bloc (which is most of eastern Europe), they\'re still
on the Julian calendar for religious observances, so their Christmas isn\'t
until the second week of January on our calendar -- lots of time to do the
deliveries there. And I would imagine that cultures that don\'t celebrate
Christmas aren\'t even on his schedule -- India and China, for instance, 
which together make up 1/3 of the planet\'s population.

Seems to me, all he does on Christmas Eve is the English-speaking world...
(Though that in itself is a daunting task...) 

Happy Holidays, everybody!

No, they were teaching it for the same reason they were teaching German in
England in 1941, so you could understand your enemy, and insult him better

> The colonial forces did not even slow the Japanese
> advance into the parts of Asia that they conquered

That\'s not true. The Japanese never succesfully invaded a location that had
any colonial forces to speak of, except Burma  (which was contested all the
way and was never "held" by the Japanese in  the sense that  there was
always fighting going on in. it and te front line never remained static for
very long ) Singapore (which was a badly bungled defence, and didn\'t have
many troops anyway) and Hong Kong (6,000 British troops, badly bungled
defence again.) .

Most of the places the Japanese invaded had either already been stripped to
support the war in Europe, or never had any forces in the first place, the
only place with significant troop concentrations (other than China) was the
150, 000 US troops MacArthur had in the Phillipines

An example I have detailed knowledge of,  Java, which is now part of
Indonesia. That was a Dutch colony, and my wife\'s grandfather was the
governor of a large part of it. The largest military unit he had on hand
during the Japanese invasion was the ceremonial brass band, and while they
and the Ache peoples were fiercely proud and were willing to fight to the
death, he managed to convince them that they would better serve the crown by
dissappearig into the hills and staying alive until after the Japanese were
defeated. He surrendered,  and spent the war in a Japanese POW camp, which
meant the majority of the native civilian population survived the war
without many problems.

I suspect that you really haven\'t read much about the Second World War based
on your comments so far.

The Japanese never held enough of China to make an invasion of India through
it possible, and Burma was never completely taken, so there was never any
chance of the Japanese being able to launch an invasion of India. In fact,
the troops in India were more worried about the civil disobedience of
Ghandi\'s  Congress party than the Japanese.

> Australia was likewise too far, with too much water
> and too many American warships in between.

Hmm, American warships didn\'t help until the US had some in the area, and
the invasion of Australia was largely avoided by a stout defence of New
Guinea by Australian, New Zealand, and British troops.

There was reportedly at least one hostile landing on the Australian coast,
though they were so ill-prepared for conditions in Australia\'s outback they
withdrew in poor order suffering many casualties from heat exhaustion and
wildlife, without facing anything more than a single Aborgine family, who
they couldn\'t catch.

They certainly made a valuable contribution to the Battle of Britain, along
with the Free Polish and one or two Americans. Examine the numbers on the
Battle of Britain honour roll one day. Or watch the credits at the end of
the film.

Based on the documentary evidence, one could also say that politics and
stupidity in the US high command hindered Britain just as much, but that
wouldn\'t be nice. All sides had their share of stupidities, and I don\'t
believe the German stupidities significantly altered the course of the war,
except perhaps the decision to persecute Jews, which indirectly lead to the
Allies developing nuclear weapons before the Germans.

Which it was always going to, neither side intended to keep to it.

You are aware of the sacrifices made by the Archangel convoys that helped
keep the Russian war machine oiled ?

BTW, the usual policy for the British is to fight the French, not the
Germans.

> (Politics and stupidity:  Not letting Guderian finish

Agreed, but while Dunkirk was a great morale building excercise, and was
hyped extravagantly by the British,  more troops and equipment were
extracted from other locations, it wasn\'t a decisive decision, and
Guderian\'s panzers would then have been exposed to naval gunfire, which was
about the only thing available to the British at the time that could have
hurt them, thus ruining the myth of the "undefeatable" panzers much quicker.

Holding back Rommel\'s panzers from the beachead in 1945 was much more
decisive, though ultimately even that wouldn\'t have prevented an Allied
victory.

> failing to try to destroy the Royal Navy during the
> Battle of Britain;

They weren\'t capable of doing so. To attack the Royal Navy, the Luftwaffe
would have had to either attack ships at sea, and they were not equipped
with many planes that were capable of such attacks, or attempted to bomb
Scapa Flow, which would have required them to fly right across England, with
almost no fighter support,  bringing _all_ of Fighter Command into the
action into the bargain

The silly decision in the Battle of Britain was to stop attacking airfields
and to start attacking civilian targets, but then the Luftwaffe didn\'t know
how stretched Fighter Command was.

> failing even to attempt to seize the North Sea

Again, the German Navy was incapable of doing this. It was hard enough for
them to get their battlecruisers into the open sea, let alone take on the
Royal Navy in a stand-up fight.

>; not even attempting to invade Britain
> (which would have necessitated neutralizing the Royal
> Navy);

That was actually a _good_ decision.

The Wehrmacht and the Luftwaffe would have been totally decimated attempting
to do so.

And they would not have succeeded. Despite the general lack of materiel in
England, the lack of adequate transports and the bad weather that actualy
occurred during the periods in which the invasion was possible, would have
left the German invasion force almost completely cut off, and most of them
would have surrendered. his would have seriously weakened Germany\'s ability
to hold their existing territiry, and might even have precipitated a Russian
invasion of Austria.

See the book "Operation Sealowe" by Richard Prentice.

>and opening the front against the Soviet Union
> before defeating Britain.)

This was a mistake. However, as Hitler still believed England would see
sense and join Germany in ruling the world, and neither side intended to
keep the treaty, it\'s understandable.

Sorry, we didn\'t get taught that in school. I learned it in Boy Scouts.

On the other hand, in 7th grade, our chemistry & Physics teacher

Try Vernor Vinge (read "True Names" then check the copyright). Ryan(?)
with "The Adolesence of P1" (a network worm before PCs!). Delaney had
"jacking in" in "Nova". And so on.

If you can find copies of both, it\'s interesting to compare "When
H.AR.L.I.E. was One", with "When H.AR.L.I.E. was One, Release 2.0". In
between them, Gerrold learned to program (he used to be a regular on
the Turbo Pascal Forum on CompuServe!). And unlike some authors, he
wasn\'t afraid to admit he\'d blown it big time thru ignorance. Thus the
second version of the book. Which is *considerably* different.

"Shockwave Rider"  is copyright 1975, I knew it was before PC\'s, but I had a

Texas was never a member of the confederacy. I was taught in my degree
program (in 2 different classes, by different instructors) that texas was
allowed to seceed from the union by congress, about a year before the
confederacy did. They maintained separate nation status, and merely ALLIED
with the confederacy. Texas (formerly Tejas) rejoined the union by treaty,
rather than by being conquered... even so, the US IMPOSED the treaty of
reunion. It did grant them permission to separate into it\'s siz constituent
states by local referendum, if they ever choose to do so. I\'ve read a copy
of the treaty of reunion, but I don\'t have a copy myself... Twice Texas was
its own country... Post Mexican, and during the US Civil War.

As for the Six flags over texas, I don\'t honestly know the deal there...
but I know the RoT had six states...

Alaskan\'s love the Texas treaty of reunion... It also provides that they
may seceed from the union, by some sepcified public majority. The Alaska
State Constitution also provides for a right to seceed, at least as
submitted to the US Gov\'t. Congress line-itemed it out. So the State\'s copy
shows that clause; copies from the congressional records don\'t show it.

Hmm... Can\'t think of an ObTrav... at least not one that isn\'t either flame
bait, or having been hased out to a draw several times. Like, how hard is
it to seceed from the 3i?

Wrongo. Texas was a member of the confederacy. Every elected office had to
take an oath of Allegiance to the confederacy. Sam Houston refused and was
removed from Office. Lincoln offered federal troops to keep Houston in
office, but he said NO. He was elected by the people and and if the people
didn\'t want him in office, he would go.
He also warned that a Civil War would not be short and glorious, but LONG
and Brutal with the North winning.  Old Sam was pretty smart.

I was taught in my degree

Wrongo again. Texas was the 11 or 12th state to seceed.  Governor Houston
fought against it and was eventually politically out maneuevered on the
issue. The anti-secession delegates to the secession conference didn\'t show
as a sign of protest. Amazingly enough it was a unanimous decision.

Wrong. Texas was a republic from 1836 till 1845 and NEVER AGAIN. Now, when
we joined in 1845 we got a sweet deal.   As for Tejas, we weren\'t called
that since the Mexican days. Its a Caddo word meaning friend :0
Texas can still legally divide itself into five states if it chooses, but
the idea behind that was the size. In 1845  Texas was considered too big for
a state, so they were given the option to subdivide. Just think how 10 Texas
senators would screw up the Senate as opposed to 2 :)

The RoT had no states. It was one big place. Never subdivided, except into
counties.
The six flags though are Spain, France, Mexico, Texas, US, Confederacy.

Wrong again. The Civil War proved once and for all that NO state has the
legal right to leave the union.

 The basic (sans BG details) plotline is quite useable. It\'s been running 
around in my head as a Mekton campaign for many years (I even ran the first 
session; imagine the looks on my players faces as I describe the burning of 
the planetary surface they were just on...).
 Using the BG background while stripping the sillier science-suspension out 
is also quite easy, and could even be part of the TU. You (the Ref, that is) 
just treat the "lost colony called Earth" story as the version of 
history/legend that these people were taught (and will soon discover is 
false), while placing the Twelve far to rimward of Solomani space.

The Channel Islands  elect no members to the parliament of the United

UKoGBaNI.  They are a dependent territory of the British Crown.

Anybody who had too much money invested in software that ran on the old
OS and hardware.

That\'s why OS/2 was a *much* more credible threat to MS. It ran on the
same hardware and would run existing software as well OR BETTER.

I might have agreed with you before this year. Hell, maybe even 6
months ago. After all, Unix in one form or another has been the
"coming OS revolution" since at *least* 1980 (when Tandy was selling a
fairly decent Xenix system).

What changed my mind? Hearing that *CostCo* was selling Linux...

It may take a few more years, but Linux has made the critical
breakthrough. It\'s being sold via a mass market *consumer* outlet.

A good alias for an NPC is Takhallus. It\'s Arabic for "pseudonym" or
"penname". There was an author writting for Analog who used it as his

It\'s quite simple. Canada is not, and never has been, *pacifist*. That
is, Canadians don\'t believe that fighting and s\\use of force are
inherently wrong.

Instead, they believe in *maintaining the peace*, even if this means
using force to deal with those who would disturb it.

This would be somewhat akin to having a "Gulf War" TL unit available in
Vietnam, or a Vietnam era TL unit available in the Korean war. 

Not "Buck Rogers" tech, but something that\'d *really* make a difference
in the situations where you were able to *use* the unit. Just consider
a few Cobras, Puff the Magic Dragon (the DC-3 with a door mounted
Vulcan) or the occasional ARClight strike would have done in Korea. :-)

Personally, I find 2-3 TL differences "more fun". The tech isn\'t
"magic", but it\'s just plain out of reach of the low TL side. Things
like the Luftwaffe trying to handle SR-71 and B-52 attacks. :-)

Actually, any cultural event based on a non-local calendar will be a
problem. Keep in mind the fact that the years don\'t have to differ by
much for "date creep" to happen. And after a few thousand years, you
wind up celebrating in the wrong season.

Simple. If you can achieve near-c velocities "easily", you can use Jump
to travel in time. 

Alternatively, the Zhodani would *kill* to learn how Santa does
interstellar teleports. (Which explains the fighter escort).

I hope they\'ve checked with a patent lawyer. Patent law is *weird*. If
Unisys wrote their "claims" properly, it\'s actually possible that the

I\'ve got it! They are the survivors of a "minor human race" that had
been on the far side of K\'kree space. And they are trying to find
Earth, while fighting ther way through the K\'kree who, (quite
naturally) want to wipe them from the Universe.

Either that, or place them on the far side of "Cylon space" which is on
the far side of Vargr space. It just doesn\'t feel right to have them
beyond the Solomani or Zhodani. The Aslan don\'t feel right either. And
let\'s not even *think* about the Hivers. But the Vargr are sufficiently
disorganized that it\'d take a long time for anything to be noticed,
much less get back to the Imperium.

Keep the "rag-tag fleet". But either make them all (barely) jump
capable, or include a lot of patched together ???? (what do you call
the ships that carry battel riders thru jump? I forget). Possibly
kludged together out of salvaged jump units from the destroyed
Battlestars and other *big* ships. With the result that they have next
to *no* manueverability in normal space. 

And for what it\'s worth, this lets you keep that episode where they
picked up the signal from Earth. At that point they need to be about
1100 parsecs from Earth (assuming they are contemporary with the 3rd
Imperium). Call it 30 sectors. Lots of room for Cylons, and other
unknown civilizations, as well as lots of "empty" areas.

You *would* have to throw out "the great void", as it was *utter*
nonsense, unless it was a dark nebula of some sort.

For *real* fun combine the "back story" of the Ancient Astronauts who
had something to do with Egypt 5000 years back and came from Cobol,
with the Grandfather stuff. So we have TL 20 or so relics from them
popping up, too.

Probably one of the many stories that had such. Like the references in
"When H.A.R.L.I.E. Was One" to a "worm" incident about then. The
Internet was barely started in the mid 70s.

And under Traveller rules, they are somewhat better off. Hydrogen Fuel

of. 

And jump *does* make evading pursuers easier.

They weren\'t *nearly* as bad as the equivalent in *some* shows.
Besides, they provide a ready made way to get PCs into situations
they\'d otherwise not touch with a 10 foot pole.

I prefer coreward, as I\'d rather not have them get gobbled by the
Solomani. On the other hand, I *do* have to admit that the Cylons and
the Solomani *do* deserve each other. 

Also, the legend can be *true* without savaging Traveller history too
much. Cobol would be a planet well to coreward (more than 1000 parsecs)
that had humans placed there by Grandfather. Possibly as *his*
equivalent of the Zhodani Core expeditions. Something scared him, and
he went for the final war.

Meanwhile, Cobol got to a *much* higher TL than the Imperium (say TL 20
or more) and *did* send out long range exploration parties (possibly
after finding some of Grandfather\'s old records?. One contacted Earth.
Others found some nice worlds much farther coreward.  Colonies were
established there and a *small* colony was established on Earth to
study it.

Then they fall partway back to primitive levels. Possibly because
Cobol\'s star has become an irregular variable, and having to completely
evacuate it overstrains their society.

So the 12 colonies get most of the population and industrial base. The
base on Earth integrates itself into Egyptian society.

I can just imagine that. Troops in full combat load trying to catch a
bunch of Abos. The Abos must have laughed themselves silly at that
antics of the "crazy yellow men". 

ObTrav: Just about *any* non-mechanized infantry units trying to catch
bands of primitive natives in a *very* hostile environment (either hot
and dry or Arctic).

Also as I recall from the first episode the Cylon leader asks a centurian
what class of warship was leading the refugees and was told "battlestar"
what other warship classes did the humans posess, and where were they?

The great void would then be the gap between the Perseus and I think the
Sagitarium arms.

The Galactica itself apart from its huge size in Traveller terms was fairly
conventional, (simply a greatly enlarged Wind class carrier) it had a spinal
weapon used to wipe out one worlds nuclear exchange plus missile bays and
point defence lasers.

IIRC (and I may not), Merchant Marine deaths weren\'t really counted. I
remember an issue of Spectrum in the late 1980s that went into accidents in
American industry during wartime. Apparently, on average you were safer in
the Army than you were working in a war industry!  (Let\';s cut safety
margins to boost productivity.)

According to the author of the article, if you counted _extra_inustrial
casualties (ie. above and beyond the \'normal\' accident rate) then American
wartime casualties were more than double official figures.

Say rather it had the option to be subdivided
but that\'s just a coincidence. The reason Six
Flags got its name (at least according to the folks at
Six Flags when I was there) was the six flags:

Spanish
French
Mexican
Texan
USA
Confederate

As of the mid 80\'s they were flying these six flags 
over the Dallas park.

The finer points of Texas history may well be lost on 
them, they are just an amusement park (albeit a good 
one). Presumably when they came up with their name 
they got it from the six flags.

Their website at  www.sixflags.com

does not seem to give a history of their name,
at least not on my brief examination.

Ob Trav: Other than the obvious note that historical
fact is not always neat & clean, especially in the
sort of commemorative history you see in popular culture
I\'m not really sure.  Perhaps if we threw the topic
open to "Entertainment of the Third Imperium" we\'d
be a bit more on topic. One of the later Challenges

Republic of Texas has constituent states? Texas, New Mexico, Arizona,
Oklahoma... am I on the right track?

As for the six flags, let\'s see if I can do this from memory... 
USA, Confederate States of America, Republic of Texas, Mexico, Spain,
France. Not necessarily in that order. (And I\'m not sure about France,

 With Lincoln\'s assassination, Johnson attempted to follow Lincoln\'s intent,

 The result was nearly a full generation of carpet-bagger and/or military

So what you are saying is that whatever the government does
is legal? Thank you for clarifying your position Mr. Nixon,
er, excuse me, Mr. Vickers.

I was not aware that the Civil War was a Supreme Court case.
The Constitution is interpreted by the Courts, not settled
on the field of battle. It\'s called the rule of law. It has
some significant advantages over the other method, most
notably its lesser amount of fatalities.

Lee v. Grant (1865) [AKA Appomattox] may have decided secession 
_de_facto_ but most definitely did _not_ settle it de jure.

The United States Constitution does not specifically _forbid_
the secession of states . Therefore under the 10th Ammendment
it permits it (at least according to the founders). The fact 
that we 20th century types choose not to see it that way is 
not relevant to the original intent. I also note that after
the conclusion of the US Civil War/War Between the States the
US Constitution was never ammended to forbid states from
leaving the union.

If you are claiming some other _legal_ source to prove that
US states may not secede what is it, and why the [deleted]
do you believe it trumps the 10th Ammendment.

> Now if need be I can document my answers, cuz I TEACH TEXAS HISTORY :)

Without meaning any disrespect here I hope you do
not teach American Government, American History, [or Internet 
etiquette Re: use of ALL CAPS] as well, Mr. Vickers.

I find the whole notion of citing a _war_ as justification for
an action to be somewhat troubling. Do you teach your students
that law (as distinct from policy) is decided on the battlefield 
by the victors? This may reflect the reality that many people 
live in accurately but it seems somewhat anathema [IMNSHO] to 
certain notions of American Government, and "western" government
in general such as the rule of law, individual rights, the
government being bound by the law.

*grin*, I knew that, but was going for my Spewage Medal with Swords and

What interesting is the variant names that have been attached to the
various Six Flags parks.  SF just took over Marine World, so we have Six
Flags over Free Willie.  And of course everybody remembers Hertitage USA,

Heck, it\'s _easy_ to ford streams here...rivers even, unless it\'s raining
hard and there\'s actually _water_ involved...

But you do still have to watch for the Fords in them, though ;-)

Well, there _was_ the Battle of the Coral Sea (May 1942), in which a US
Navy carrier task force turned back a Japanese attempt to invade Port
Moresby by sea.  (Yes, I know that Task Group 17.3 [Support Group],
commanded by RN Rear Admiral Crace, had 2 Australian cruisers, but the
primary fighting was conducted by carrier air strikes.)

Considering that the legality of the formation of the US was established by
force of arms rather than in a court of law, it might not be the best
possible to follow that argument too far... :>

Americans have a tendency, it seems to me as one, to drop the pretense of
law if money can be more quickly stolen by main force. This applies to
individuals as well as legal entities. See the way the seizure laws have
raped the 4th amendment for one example and Monstanto\'s efforts to shove
Bovine Growth Hormone on unwilling farmers for the other.

  Depends how many refuelling assets they retain (hmm, attackers kept going for

  Hmm, there was an old Different Worlds mag (IIRC) that did the various
fighters; there was also a Miniature Wargames article a few years ago on
doing a BG campaign (representing the early War) using Full Thrust rules.
Apparently there\'s a UK company that does lead Battlestars for 7-8 pounds
sterling each - the photos looked beautiful, but it seems too difficult

Here you go...

Q1.4:  Did the Supreme Court ever rule on the legality of secession? 

   Yes, it did-- after the war.  Perhaps the clearest statement is in  the
case Texas v. White (74 U.S. 700).  Chief Justice Chase, writing  for the
court in its 1869 decision, said: 
 
   "The Constitution, in all its provisions, looks to an indestructible
Union, composed of indestructible States. ... Considered, therefore, as
transactions under the Constitution, the Ordinance of Secession, adopted
by the convention and ratified by a majority of the citizens of Texas, and
all the Acts of her Legislature intended to give effect to that ordinance,
were absolutely null. They were utterly without operation in law. ... Our
conclusion, therefore, is, that Texas continued to be a State, and a State
of the Union, notwithstanding the transactions to which we have referred."


The entire decision is available on the Web at
http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/cases/historic.htm

Peter, the victor on the battlefield can usually make it legal in the
courts, the loser seldom can.  In a sense, the war itself made it clear
that no state would be *allowed* to secede, and the court cases of which
Texas v White is only one, certified that no state had a legal *right* to
secede.  We make not like the rulings of that court, but as long as they
stand they are the law of the land.

I could ObTrav something about the Moot, but I won\'t.  Instead, if anyone
wants to continue this thread let\'s take this private, okay?

Of all the ideas I like this one.  It will not readly be identified as a 
BG campagin.  It lets you play with the K\'kree on a large scale. 
With the highly socialy k\'kree it explains why the cylons/K\'kree 
fighters have three crewmembers.  And base stars are round 
enough.

They should be jume one.  As for getting away from the K\'kree, 
remember they are on a set course, and the Baltziur(sP) character

Boy, I am offline for a couple days and there are 700+ messages on the TML!
Microsquash, that\'s a new one. Since I am so behind on the list I don\'t know
if anyone else has mentioned this, but others on the list may be interested
as well in your rules. Perhaps you could drop a chapter or so on the list,
or an overview. Excel type rubbish is fine for me, but can you save it in a
more Mac friendly format? I have a copy of Office 2k, but I would have to
run VPC. I can do this, but if you could save it in a Clarisworks compatible
format, it would help. That would be either Excel 3 or 4, DIF, DBF, or SYLK.
Or even ASCII unless there are complex formulaes. Excel 3 or 4 is probably
the best bet.

I\'ve been wondering that too, 40 lbs is a lot of mass. I would not want to

I should point out that I have no idea of the accuracy of the figure 40lb -
I was merely quoting Giles The Englishman from Buffy The Vampire Slayer.

Funny, IBM still sells it. Though you\'d have the devil\'s own time
finding out, since they were silly enough to agree to a contract for
Win 98 that required them to quite advertising OS/2 (not that their
advertising had been all that great).

The handwriting *is* on the wall, sinced they just terminated support
for OS/2 Warp 3. Warp 4 isstill supported, but we have to wonder for
how long.

I really do enjoy watching Windows apps crash and burn and being able
to handle the situation by merely closing the window they were running
in. 

Alas, the last couple of versions of Win32 have been made
*deliberately* incompatible with OS/2.

If I was Adama, the fleet would normal jump to the outer system,
preferably after scouts located a suitable "iceball". Skimming would be
*suicide* with that mess.

Also, outer system iceballs would tend to have a lot of badly needed
life support chemicals.

Oh yes.

Where are my notes.....

Basic structure that I had sketched some time back:

Time: just after the war between Grandfather & the Hivers (280,000 years ago).

Where: Sector far from Vland & Terra

"cylons" (described in BG as a lizard like race), were Droyne. Destruction
caused by the Hivers left only a few Droyne leader/thinkers. They supported
them selves by extending their lives through psionics & cybernetics.  Humans
continued in the role of worker race. Because there were so few of the
Cylons <droyne> left, the human colonies became more and more self governing
and expanding out side of the frozen image of what is correct. Ultimately
the now radically cybernetically altered leader/thinkers, alive well past
where droyne would normally be, begin to fear the human workers and begin a
series of attempts to reduce the human population to manageable levels.
Humans view these as wars, the Cylon/droyne seem them as "thinning the
herd". The fact that the thining operations have no effect beyond a few
decades eventually causes the leaders to declare the humans a mortal danger
and start an outright extermination campaign.

Changes from Canon.

No one retains "jump" ability; but worm holes do exist, and are used for
interstellar travel. This enables any ship to get from one star to another
without having to suck up large percentages of hull with fuel.

Also provides choke points; Cylon/Droyne don\'t have enough ships to cover
all know wormholes, and not all existant wormholes are known. 

There is more; but in normal fashion, so carefully filed that it won\'t
surface until Cleon is crowned.

Get a copy of OS/2 Warp 4 and a copy of Partition Magic. Keep Win 95
for the stuff that just plain *won\'t* run under Win-OS/2. Change the
drive to have 3 partitions: Win95 OS & config files, OS/2 config and OS
files, and one for shared data/programs.

The problem I\'ve run into so far is that I haven\'t been able to find any
definitive information on Galactica\'s size.  One source indicates a
length of _4025_ meters....

For at least some of the "ragtag fleet", you can use canonical ships.

Actually, it is becomming an "imbedded" system.

My mainframe (a "multiprise" box) has a Hardware Monitor Console: a PC
running WARP. It manages all the low level support functions for the big
box; even booting the mainframe is done from an Icon on the Warp desktop.

There is also a communictions controller, the IBM 3172, that is actually
managed by Warp. 

The Support Update Facilty (SUF) that comes with the mainframe is also run
on a PC running WARP.

It isn\'t so much dying, as it is moving away from home use into support roles.

Guys, don\'t give them jump drives.  They need to say in normal space
between the stars.  Give them a modified form of stutterwarp. Instead of
having a ly limit, have them "burn" a fuel as they stutter, thus having to
refuel ever so often, and the fuel can be something rare and more likely
to be found in the quantities you nee in inner systems.  Heck, if you
tinker it up you can even produce the banking Vipers! Isn\'t that what the
fighters were called? ;-)

I like pitting them against the K\'kree, but how about taking this in a
slightly different direction.  Put this at about 1600 (500 years after
Virus).  This "rag-tag band" are the remnants of a pocket empire that
developed far beyond the Black Curtain.  However, now their homeworld and
colonies are destroyed and they are being pursued by a race of Virus
animated robots who call themselves Cylons.  IIRC, the leader of the
Cylons was Lucifer...not far from Lucan.  <g> IAC, these refugees have
legends about Earth, Solomani enclave maybe, but to get there they have to
circle the Cylon Empire sending them through K\'kree territory....

        Hi, Leonard....

        The short version is "nope".  Single 100dton vessels are incapable
of trashing million-dton super-dreadnaughts...  in BG, this was always a
threat.  I *suppose* the dodge there is to allow nuclear weapons and
disallow nuclear dampers;  worse, allow multi-megaton
"single-shot-ship-wrecker" designs from SS:3 and disallow nuclear damper...

        2nd, 100dton dreadnaughts *can* trash a million dton
super-dreadnaught...  which means that the Cylons should, in thier imicably
straightforward fashion, simply send a herd of 100dkton maulers to all fire
*only* on the BG, and then they can mop up the rest of the fleet at thier
liesure.

        The only possible way to make this work is if you give the humans
some tech advantage (BG carries the only working meson weapon....  the
humans never had a chance to build another ship with this brutally effective
technology...  the Cylons, therefore, never "evolved" a defensive screen ..
yet).  Which sounds like handwaving.

        There is no good reason that twelve human worlds fighting for 1000
years and haven\'t beaten the Cylons would suddenly be able to hold them at
bay indefinately with a "rag-tag fleet" of a fist full of warships and the
balance in frieghters and transports....

        Now, that having been said, the BGU seems to use a "stutterwarp"
like drive systems allowing them to be engaged while cruising through space
in FTL mode...  Put the original 12 worlds in the *middle* of the Cylon
Empire (they got surrounded in the past 1000 years as the Cylons but the
chromed boots to every other race in the area) and have to flee at JP2 to
the border and beyond....  That might be interesting...  the time lag
associated with Cylon picket ships needing a week to inform other units that
they saw the Human Fleet at such and such a star would be *just* enough to
keep the Daggits nipping at the runners on the sliegh, but not nessecarily
able to "corner" them...  so long as the Humans keep moving.

        Treat Galactica as a jump-capable combat-monster space-dock, able to
service and repair other starships as well as able to function as a ship of
the line...  that way, the Fleet can evade the maintainence problems;  so
long as they raid or harvest worlds for raw materials.

        The "Viper" would need to be a zero-range fighter;  sub-100dtons and
therefore non-jump (based on the scenes in the movie and series, its too
small...).  The Humans, therefore, would have some long-range two-man
scout-fighter that the PC would be flying, Jp2.  The Cylon Raider looked
*big*...  three crew...  handwave it to 100dtons and make it jump-capable.

        Ok, I take it back.  It *could* be done.  How much damage you\'d do
to its "canon" to wedge it into a Traveller rules-set, I dunno...

        Well, according to the official Marvel comic adaptation of the
movie, in the section which has notes and detailing about the movie and BGU,
they say that there are 221 ships which begin the journey.

        Options for travel are v-near-c drives or "hyperdrive" which allows
a ship to "warp out of ine area, and reappear a short time later in normal
space an incredible distance away...."   (sounds like jump-srive to me!)

        "Tylium" is the unstable fuel (it reduces to "solium", which is
explosive), and they remark that most ships cannot be fitted with
light-speed drives, but most can be equipped with hyperdrive.

        Another remark they make is that while the Twelve Colonies have been
at war with the Cylons for almost 1000 years, they depended almost entirely
on the firepower of the dozen battlestars and the horde of "short ranged"
fighters they each carried.

        Another remark is that the entire crew compliment of the Galactica
is "close to 500, and about half of these are pilots and infantrymen".  In
another area, it says "every battlestar carries a full compliment of 75
short-range fighters".

        I would say that a 4km-long vessel would not work under HG rules to
get this kind of result.  402.5m, perhaps.

        However, in several scenes, the relative scaling of other craft
makes the 4025m figure more believable.  Perhaps for our adaptation it
should be 5000 crew and 750 fighters?

Well, according to the .jpg I downloaded from a S:AAB site, SARATOGA
from S:AAB displaces about 720,000 dtons, and is 525.6 meters long. 
(Note that both SARATOGA and GALACTICA would probably be considered USL
Slab configuration ships.)  Thus, any ship much larger would exceed the
1000 kdton limit in HG.  OTOH, SARATOGA carries 168 SA-43 "Hammerheads",
along with a number of larger utility craft (ISSCV/ISSAPC).

Scaling down to practical ships in Traveller, GALACTICA would be about
equivalent to a TIGRESS (500 kdton, 300 fighters), give or take a bit.

I can see a relatively small multi-world polity (the Twelve Colonies)
building several TIGRESS-sized ships as a primary naval striking force. 
Loss of most of these ships could, indeed, leave the home worlds largely
undefended.

Reminds me of the old joke about why the Egyptians made peace with Israel.

It seems that Sadat was listening to a speech by one of the more
intransigent Arab leaders whose zeal for war was inverse proportion to his
country\'s distance from Israel, Kadaffi if memory serves me right.  When
Kadaffi swore that the next war would be fought to the last Egyptian Sadat

I did say they didn\'t help until they got there, I fully admit it was the US
that was mainly responsible for victory in the Pacific.

But without the colonial defenders that were there 1941, there would likely
have already been Japanese troops in Port Moresby by May 1942.

True, but I\'m afraid I don\'t know enough about the progress of the Fifth

Or as more Political/Military/Defences Policy instructor put it.  Let 
them  fight for you and make them say thank you for it.  Thats how 
we took the Atlantic from the GB during WWII.  Let me point out 
that every power that rose to take control of the world system 
inclunding England (ask a Russian or German and France, or 
anyone of her old colonies)  thats just how things work.  

The real quesetion for me thoough how does this applie in a M:0 
setting.  Who or Whom were the Imperiums allies at this time.  
Espically right around Sylen.

I think we are pretty much mature adults. The only time I ever lost it over
the War of 1812 was when I was on a tour of the Capital Building
this October and actually had to explain to my history teachers ( I am dept.
ehad at
my school ) that Washington was assaulted in the war.
Nothing like making History teachers look stupid :)

Then again, they all teach Texas History anyway :)

The series also has, without a doubt, the snazziest graphic design of any

only the pen and paper roleplaying industry would take a cue from the
Wipeout series, at least with respect to graphic design.

==========
Historian\'s Gambit - A Patron Encounter

[preface]
The hardest thing to do, it seems, is to admit error... especially in areas
within or near one\'s field of endeavor. Even more so when the sources are
fuzzy.... This encounter assumes one or more party members with a bent
towards Imperial History, and is ideally suited for the timeframe of the
late 3I. Note that the players as well as the characters should share the
interest. Closer to Capitol is better, but not an absolute necessity.
[Begin Text]
The party is contacted by a noted researcher, one Aanerii Shushugliarii, a
local research historian specializing in the Imperial Civil War and
Barracks Emperors. He is trying to find research assistants, and a mutual
acquaintace reccomended [insert party member(s)] as being somewhat versed
in the period, and able researchers. Aanerii has recently found a set of
genetic scans of Zhakirov, done in 664, in a data warehouse of Sharushiid.
These scans clearly lable him as Crown Prince Shakirov Alkhalikoi, include
holographic data, and multiple pieces of corroboration as to their
authenticity. Most troubling, though is that they do not match the scans
done by the imperial physicians at his birth, investure, or induction into
Imperial Service. A nearby world has confirmed that they have numerous
records relating to the era as well, including genetic scans, but the
finding aid does not list individuals in the genetic database of the
timeframe. Aanerii is hoping to employ the characters to ferret out of the
thousands of records in the duplicate warehouse corroboration of the scans,
make duplicates, and bring them back to him for comparison. Aanerii is
hoping it was an error in identification of Zhakirov. Aanerii promises Cr
20,000 for the research, plus travel expenses, as his teaching load
prevents him from doing the research himself. He also will make the
arraingements for any needed data acesses. (He has priveledges with
Sharushiid for their whole data wharehouse network, and can authorize up to
4 associates to research there. He will gladly expand the research purview
on their papers for their own pet project, as well, if the party so
requests.)
Aanerii will check the PC\'s credentials, looking for semi-professional
levels of skill in some appropriate fields (MT: History 2+, computer 1+;
T4: Research 2+ History 2+ Computer 1+; TNE: Research asset 12+, History
Asset 10+)

[results]
Roll 1d6:
1	Everything is exactly what it seems. A mysterious duplicate with
incredibly well forged papers was in the area, living it up. Enough reseach
will also reveal that the Fake Zhakirov originated at a point several jumps
away from where the scan was taken, which just happened to be where the
real Zhakirov was at. Further research, if the PC\'s are willing, will
eventually reveal that Sharushiid discovered the fraud, but not in time to
capture the individual. Aanerii will gladly pay another Cr20,000 for a
fully documented essay for his next textbook, which will entail furhter
research by the players, but will gain them some reputation in local
academia.
2	As 1, except that Aanerii was hoping to discredit the Alkhalikoi
line by proving that there was a coverup, and will quietly pay the
characters, and swallow it painfully.
3	The scans are correct, but the identity is wrong. Zhakirov\'s scan
is mixed up with Erik Chaimberlain\'s, but the rest of the files are
correct. Sufficient research in either the records of security, medical, or
the originating world will reveal the authenticity of Erik\'s scan, and a
check with the Imperial Archives will verify that Erik\'s records contain
the real Zhakirov\'s data. The two do, however, look remarkably similar.
Enerii is mildy annoyed, but pays up. If the PC\'s have something juicy for
him, though, even if not related to their research, he\'ll gladly provide
further patronage in exchange for publication rights on their findings.
4	Aanerii is a fraud. A bad researcher, a bad historian, he\'s simply
looking for any way to discredit Sharushiid. There is no scan, and the
whole is a wild goose chase. It will, however, lead the players into
Sharushiid\'s sting to try and find who\'s been "adding" to their archives.
The local warehouse does not recognize Aanerii\'s supposed credentials, but
will assist the PC\'s anyway. If confronted, Aanerii will fail to pay, and
disappear for a while. Additionally, he\'s published something as an article
under the appropriate PC\'s name, snd it is purely nonsense. The legal fun
in getting it squelched, and in clearing their names becomes QUITE the
adventure.
5	The records, when found, cross reference in the archive, into
several secure files. If the PC\'s hack, cajole, or otherwise find there way
into the secure files, they uncover a Sharushiid kidnap, replacement, and
substitution. They worked a major conspiracy to put a sharushiid-friendly
"false Emperor" on the throne. Their false emeperor was one Erik
Chaimberlain, a Sharuishiid mamagement employee, who originally bore a
remarkable resemblance to Zhakirov. See [n1].
6	as per 5, but including replacement of his reporductive organs and
bone marrow with Zhakirov\'s, and retrogenic therapy to prevent rejection.
So Zhakirov\'s heirs are really the real Zhakirov\'s heirs. Additionally,
they used a zhodani agent to read the Real Zhakirov\'s mind, and implant his
basic knowledge and mannerisms (but not politics); The real goal was to
prevent another frontier war, and put a puppet of the Consulate on the
throne. See [n1].

n1: In either case, Aanerii\'s recation should be rolled for, on 1d6:
1: 	Aanerii wants to go public with it, but will only do so if the PC\'s
agree. He pays up as promised in either case.
2:	Aanerii wants to ignore the data. He won\'t publish, but won\'t stop
the PC\'s from publishing. He will only pay in full if they agree not to
publish, but will pay half in any case.
3:	Aanerii wants to bury the data, and contacts friends in low places
to eradicate the PC\'s, as they know too much. He\'ll pay, but double cross.
He\'s really working for the consulate.
4:	Aanerii wants to bury the data, and wants the PC\'s to help him
destroy the evidence files. He\'ll fund (and go with) an expidition to set a
delayed data-bomb virus in a large number of data warehouses that have
duplicates of the data. If the PC\'s ever check his source of funds, they
will find he\'s imperially funded.
5:	As 4, except he\'s funded by the [(1-3) consulate (4-5) Sharuushiid
(6)some other group], and needs to cover their role in the whole affair. He
wants to [(1-3) edit the data (4-6) destroy the data as in 4].
6:	Aanerii attempts to discredit the whole alkhalikoi line. IRIS or
INI or some other set of spooks will try to enlist the characters in
hushing him.

Well, all we can do is try scaling it from various shots. The entrance
to the landing bays, for example. given the shots of vipers landing,
and and a few other such shots, the bay entry *cant* be more than 10
meters tall. Is the Galactica 400 times longer than that bay is tall?

I\'d have to say that *does* seem to be in range. If you\'ve ever seen a
model of the Galactica, it\'s *huge*, (around a meter long), and the
landing bays are only a few mm tall. (if that)

Ask around. New copies are kinda expensive. But there are lots of
*used* copies floating around Prices of $10-$40 are common. Mostly
towards the low end.

Keep an eye on E-bay. 

What you *want* is Warp 4. Though you could probably get by with Warp
3. Warp 3 comes in several versions:

Warp 3 Red (the box has a red spine) does not include the OS2 Windows
support. Instead you need to have a copy of Win 3.1x and it will patch
it to work with OS/2. This is the least desireable for most folks,
though it\'s *preferred* for folks wanting to step from DOS with
DesqView to something better.

Warp 3 Blue (the box has a blue spine) *does* include "Win-OS/2" which
runs Win 3.1 and early Win32 apps *better* than real Windows. 

Both versions also come in a "Connect" version which includes
Networking capability. Both LAN and Internet. 

So that gives 4 versions:

Warp 3 Red
Warp 3 Red connect
Warp 3 Blue
Warp 3 Blue connect

Warp 4 has both Win-OS/2 and networking.

Warp 3 wil run on a 386. For Warp 4, you want at least a 486. Though
I\'m told that if you know the proper incantations, it\'ll run on a 386.

No, they don\'t, but the diagram I have lists SARATOGA\'s dimensions in

BTW, I\'d list the S:AAB setting at TL-9, maybe TL-10.

Is a company called "StarTech" still around?  They used to sell these, or
at least what sounds like the same thing.  They specialized in anything and
everything from Sci-Fi TV shows and Movies.  Including some of the more
obscure shows.

Of course since I\'ve not seen a catalogue from them in almost 10 years,
they are very likely out of business.

How much did you allow for the fact that the ship isn\'t a "featureless

Alas, those damned fighter do things that are hard even at TL-15. Like

Don\'t sweat it, we  all get crazies in the classroom at somepoint, I know I
am one.
The toughtest sale I have are my 7th graders. They all wander in with
notions like "Sam Houston wore women\'s clothing and the reason he didn\'t
kill Santa Anna was that they both knew the secret crack whore handshake."
And they believe that stuff because their daddies told it to them :)
So, primary documentation becomes a necessary evil with the little buggers.

Some of the more colorful ideas presented to me this year were
1) Columbus\' ships were the Santa Anna, The Banana,  and the Mayflower
2) The Government is hiding UFO\'s in the desert.


Now, the UFO debate starting with my annual discussion of "The consitution
as a framework for American/Texan government" Needless to say, the UFOs came
up soon after.

As for Traveller, how about a prolonged "field" trip aboard the character\'s
ship for a group of young students.  Of course these are wealthy students
from a backwater planet who have VERY strong opinions about Imperial
History.
The entire voyage and the resulting planetary trip could be a test of wills
as the Players try and "teach" the truth to these rug rats. Make some of the
kid\'s statements inflammatory and in public so that the local Imperial
authorities take offense, possibly even arresting the characters :)

Just a thought

things normally associated with UFO\'s :

1.  Glow.  Plasma glows.
2.  Electrical interference.  Leakage from the drive would account for this.
3.  Super-sonic flights without sonic boom.  Ionizing radiation from the
ion-plasma field would disrupt air molecules around the ship, eliminating
the
     forced air-mass at the front of the ship that causes it to leave a
vacuum in it\'s wake.  No vacuum, no sonic boom.

Why would the government hide these things and deny their existence?  Well
I\'m sure you all can come up with a host of plausible reasons.  Off the top
of my head I can think of one :

Perhaps these air-ships do not work so good and Millions have been spent on
them (thrown away).  Military is no likely to own up to that.

Here are a couple I\'m fond of:

The "Monarch" class Imperial battlecruiser _Norton I_ (the Bay Area

Actually, going back into the historian patron thread, a patron asking
for assistance in researching the great Terran Emperor Joshua Norton I
would be an amusing diversion....

If you can find it get Warp 4, othersise get 3 Connect.  I might be wrong,
but don\'t think there was a Red version of the Connect, just the straight
Warp 3.  You will want the version that includes the IBM tweeked Win3.1
support, IAC.  Looking at Yahoo\'s auctions you should be able to get a
copy for under $50.

Then you will want to upgrade the version you get to the latest version
with the bug fixes, complete Y2k support, addition of TT fonts, NS
Communicator, etc, etc.  These are free from one of IBM\'s sites, but we\'re
talking hundreds of MB and a *lonnng* download. The easy way is to go to
Indelibile Blue (1) and search for their WarpUp Client CD.  For about $20,
you get all the latest upgrades and utilities with an easy to use install
program for all the features.

(1) Indelible Blue at http://www.indelible-blue.com/ is a good place to
find OS/2, Linux, or even Windows software online.  They also sell
hardware, including systems pre-loaded with Linux, OS/2 and/or Windows.

Especially, if they found records providing clear evidence of his

altered reality, which isn\'t a problem for the PC\'s, but the *players*

Now _that\'s_ an Illuminated approach!

Best of all, if they do their research in the San Francisco area, they
actually can find credible evidence (newspapers printing Imperial
decrees, money issued by the Emperor, etc.).  In fact, ISTR that the Bay
Bridge has a plaque honoring Emperor Norton I, who, on March 23, 1872,
decreed "that a suspension bridge be built as soon as convenient between
Oakland Point and Goat Island, and then on to San Francisco."

See

http://www.sfmuseum.org/hist1/norton.html

for a synopsis of His Imperial Majesty\'s rule.

Note, BTW, that Emperor Norton I was originally buried _in the MASONIC
Cemetery_....

And who _was_ "the Widow\'s Son", anyway?

There\'s someone at my door, so I\'ll just post this now....

I wonder whether spin-gravity would provide the best teaching
environment.  For instance, those undergrad physics labs would prove
harder to complete with predictable results, since gravity would not be
as constant as it is either on a planetary surface or in an artificial
gravity environment.  Not to mention the difficulties drunken college
students would have moving from one level to another, with gravity
changing on them....

That\'s a fair piece larger than any ship one could design using HG.  I
designed a 1,000,000 dton battleship using FF&S2, with the Medium
Cylinder configuration.  I came up with a length of 415.7 meters, and a
diameter of 206.3 meters.

The Internet worm was late 1980\'s.  The place I was munging assembly code 
at the time was not effected because of the flavor of Digitial UNIX we used 
on our servers did not have the security hole it exploited.

This means that your PC will have to do some research.  The virus they use 
to paralyze a quick local police response might not have any effect on the 
Fire Department response (with high pressure hoses) or the local military 
units.

The very fact they existed at all would be sufficient reason. No government
wants its enemies/rivals to know which avenues it\'s researching.

There were some rumours that the Russian Federation was looking at
plasma-related stuff for stealthing aircraft. I doubt they got anywhere, but
the fact they were doing research could easily have caused enough scare in
US mil-research circles to have a look at the technology themselves.

Believe what you like.

The 2 man heavy fighter is the Asp. There was a recon probe craft that was
done by (IIRC) Kenner in the 70\'s. Both make for good gaming ideas.

Well, according to Richard Hatch, the Battlestars carried 75, but were
capable of carrying 150 vipers, 20 shuttles, and 20 asps.

Also, don\'t forget the long-term quartering... while the pilots may live in
bunks, they\'ve got enough rec facilities to make for 2 LSR per crewman.
They also carry large ammounts of supplies. This kind of stuff is covered
in FF&S2 as I recall, and should be accounted for.

Oh, and don\'t forget the maintenance shops. The extensive labs. The council
chambers.

And, as we see in the 2nd episode above terra (not Earth, mind you, but
another world so similar)... Galactica has some form of shielding vs Nukes.

To a certain extent, yes, war does settle issues. Look at the vast tracts
of land conquered during the Indian Wars, for example. Look at the USA
itself: founded by an act of war, in defiance of the laws of the King.

Well, let\'s look at the description of "cluster skills."

We note (page 37, T4) that "Expertise in a skill within a cluster does
not geve a character ANY [emphasis added] ability in any other skills
under that same heading."

Further, cluster skills are "skills within a related subject for ease
creating characters [sic], and reference during play." (ibid, page 37)

Since characters (other than Scouts) receive one skill per year, plus
skills gained for commissions and/or promotions, a character does not
receive all skills within a cluster, but must choose one skill within a
cluster.  Otherwise, a character could receive up to _eleven_ skills in
one year (both the Sciences and Technical clusters contain eleven
skills).

Well, T4 mentions two academies for the armed forces: the Military
Academy (for the Army, page 27) and the Naval Academy (for the Navy,
page 28).  Since neither academy addresses Marines, we may choose
between four options:

1.  Neither academy leads to a Marine commission (I really don\'t like
this option, and I suspect that you won\'t either);

2.  Graduates from the Military Academy may choose between commissioning
in the Army or Marines (since they are both ground forces);

3.  Graduates from the Naval Academy may choose between commissioning in
the Navy or Marines (this resembles the current US Navy/USMC situation);

4.  Graduates from either the Military or Naval Academy may choose
between commissioning in the parent service or Marines (this is the most
flexible option).

I recommend either Option #3 or Option #4 above.  YMMV.  Void where
prohibited.

Note that commissioning of college OTC/NOTC participants should coincide
with your decision concerning the academies.

I\'d be very interested in learning, not debating, but
learning more of Chinese culture and history. Looking
at current events, at their space program, their hard
working nature (or made to work by the commies? hard
to generalise about how hard working races are), and
long term view (eg, "China cannot have a blue water
navy capable of challenging the USA until 2045, but we
will have one then), because of these kinds of things,
I view it as very likely that Chinese culture will be
very significant in any interstellar future. I can
certainly imagine China sending out STL colony ships
in the next century.

So, right now I\'m doing a re-vamp of my sci-fi (not
traveller) universe, and I\'m wanting to put in a big
Chinese part. So I think I\'m not alone among the TML
in wanting to learn more (without having to study it
at uni!). If you wish, we could discuss it off-list.

Hmm, let\'s see.  Now if I recall correctly, if I use a program
that uses GIF as an output format, the programmer or
publisher are responsible for securing those rights yes?
If they don\'t, I cannot be held responsible for thier failure
can I?

With our population (around 17 million), big subsidies, I don\'t think so

Regarding Imperial policies on trade, it seems as long as trade is not
severely disrupted then virtually any tactics can be used. Remeber though
any tactics your corporation uses can also be used by other corporations
against you.

The closest most have come is probably to know that
"burbon and branch" means whiskey with water added.

Norton I, Emperor of the United States and Protector of Mexico.  <grin>

A \'nutball\' who wandered around San Francisco in the 1800s, and everybody 
around him pretended to take him seriously.  He\'d eat at a restaurant and pay 
with a check written on his own (nonexistant) Imperial bank, and they\'d *take 
the check*.

Legend has it he walked into the middle of a riot once and called on the 
rioters to stop at once.  And they did.

Strange misunderstood fellow, our Norton...

He dropped the "Protector of Mexico" bit after a little while, though. He
stated that no one could protect such an unsettled territory.

Something along those lines. There is reason to believe that Norton, at
least during his life, was not treated with the same respect which people
have given him in death. Mark Twain, who saw Joshua Norton every day (he
worked next door to the boarding house in which the Emperor lived), was not
at all happy with the treatment that the Emperor received. After Twain left
San Francisco, he inserted a Nortonesque character into Huckleberry Finn and
wrote a "The Prince and the Pauper", which many people claim was inspired by
Emperor Norton.

He was allowed to eat at the free lunch counter of some saloons, however,
and he made something of a living by trading currency to tourists. Some
banks allowed him to draw as much as 25 cents from non-existant bank
accounts from time to time. He was widely ridiculed in the newspapers of the
time, but he became something of a hero for the working class (one of the
San Francisco papers noted that the vast majority of the 10,000 to 20,000
mourners who showed up were blue collar types).

> Legend has it he walked into the middle of a riot once and called on
>the rioters to stop at once.  And they did.

The story, which may or may not be true, is far more beautiful. He came
across a surly group who were becoming far more surly while listening to an
anti-Chinese rabble rouser. He was disgusted by what he saw. He demanded
that he be given a chance to speak, and the crowd laughed at him, and the
speaker stepped away and let him speak, probably thinking that the ersatz
Emperor would provide some momentary amusement. Norton recited the Lord\'s
Prayer, and then asked the crowd to join in... some did. He then made a
short speech concerning brotherly love. The mood of the crowd changed and
the rabble rousing speaker slipped away.

One of the problems that arises in the study of Emperor Norton I is that
most of the exploits and proclamations which were attributed to him appeared
in the newspapers of the day which were highly sensationalistic and which
alternately ridiculed him and deified him. Many of his proclamations are
thought to be the work of reported expressing their own political opinions
and views through the pen of the Emperor.

Joshua Norton, in the years when he was a rich landowner and businessman,
was on the first San Francisco Vigilance Committee, and it is interesting to
note that he felt those who would be hung should be allowed a chance to
defend themselves.

I\'m sorry, I have no ObTrav and I\'m starting to feel guilty about my
off-topic posts.

Taxonomy is explained quite well in _Solomani_, so the original writers were
well enough informed about that. As for human evolution, the prevailing
theories (and let\'s not forget that they are, after all, only theories)
have propably changed in the last 20 years.

I don\'t really think current theories are wrong, but IMO it is utterly
irrelevant in this case, because correcting the mistake (if it is a mistake)
will tear long holes in the Traveller background and reduce its usefulness.
I LIKE having most of the various human races interfertile. If you accept
that _Homo sapiens_ hadn\'t evolved yet 300,000 years ago, then NONE of the
descendants of _Homo antiquitus_ would be interfertile with the Solomani.
(Well, I suppose you could invoke the Ancients, but IMO they are getting
rather overworked already. Besides, we know from canon that different
Ancients \'ran\' different human populations. Why in the world would some of
them build in a genetic code that would allow Solomani, Darrians, Vilani,
and other groups to evolve to a form that would be interfertile with the
rest?).

All the available in-game evidence show that _Homo antiquitus_ was already
_Homo sapiens_. If the Real World don\'t like that, I think the Real World
should take a hike.

No evidence that His Majesty was actually a Mason, but he did print his own
money (you can see some of it at City Hall), and the local Masons paid for
his burial.  Close to 10,000 attended his funeral, and Mark Twain wrote a
euolgy for him.

He stopped an anti-Chinese riot by kneeling in front of the mob on
California St. at Stockton and began praying.  This being Sunday, many of
the mob were shamed into joining him, and the mob dispersed.

Compuserve defined the GIF format to use a _particular_form_  of the LZW
compression process which Unisys happens to own a patent on.

> See http://www.unisys.com/unisys/lzw/

That\'s not an entirely accurate description of the situation, it\'s actually
Unisys propaganda

For instance they say :

" More and more people are becoming aware that the reading and/or writing of
GIF images requires a license to use Unisys patented Lempel Ziv Welch (LZW)
data compression and decompression technology"

This is patently <grin> untrue, as the patent applies only to the _creation_
of the GIF format.
Reading GIF inmages does not require a patent as it does not require the use
of the patented algorithm.
(only the _compression_ algorithm_is actua;ly patented. )

They also say :

"Other forms of LZW are, for example, TIFF-LZW, PDF and Postscript-2."

This again is untrue, as Postscript-2 also does not require the use of the
patented LZW algorithm as it is not a compressed format by default, though
Postscript does require a license for Adobe.

> > As I understand it, folks that write programs that implement the GIF

Not entirely true, If you write a program that _creates_ GIFs using the
patented Unisys algorithm  then you theoretically need a license. Of course,
that assumes that you do it in a country that recognizes the US Patent
Office, or where Unisys has succesfully patented the algorithm.

While on their web-site they _claim_ to have patented it in the UK, I find
that very hard to believe, as the UK patent office originally issued a
statement saying it was not going to recognize algorithmic patents.

> If I write code that implements LZW compression (jn ANY form, not just GIF
> image compression) than I need a UNISYS license.

Not true.  LZW compression itself is public domain, as it was published by
the authors ( Liz, Zempel, and WhatsHisName) many years before Unisys took
out a patent on one particular form of it.

Unfortunately, the form that was used in GIF is the form that is patented by
Unisys
(What used to be Sperry-Rand)

For example, one of the PK-Zip formats uses LZW compression without
requiring a Unisys license.

There\'s no logical reason for GIF to be popular,  it\'s a crappy  format.
(Just as there\'s no logical reason for IBM PC\'s and Microsoft operating
systems to be popular.)

I never use it, as jpg is so much better for most pictures.

Those that recommend GIF for line drawings miss the point, any line drawing
is better rendered using a vector format anyway.

The major reason for avoiding GIF is that Unisys are trying to be such
pricks about it, and are also trying tio claim rights they do not have. It
must be the only thing Unisys make any money on these days, Linc and their
A-series machines are fast becoming museum pieces.

Exactly, which is why you\'re finding it harder than Windows.
But you can\'t do that _at_all_on Windows because the information isn\'t

Pardon ?  You\'re trrying to imply that the average user will be trying to
set up Samba and DHCP ?

And it\'s _not_ just checking a single check-box in W2K

For a start you need to specify the range of IP addresses your DHCP server
is gong to use
And to set up a PPP server or a DNS there are whole pile of things you need
to do in W2K, not the least of which is disable all your other DNS\'s because
the W2K one is incompatible with every other DNS out there.

The equivalent is trying to set up an NFS mount  and a secure internet
server on W2K, something that isn\'t possible without third-party software
and a hell of a lot of "undocumented by Microsoft" tweaking.

Why bother ?

I just ran the install proces and selected my printer form the list, just
like you do in Windows.

No reason to do so anyway, that\'s like arguing  Netscape/IE    or Word/Word

They *really* don\'t need to.  Your average user can\'t install or set-up
anything on Windows anyway, they just need to use the system. Windows is not
easier to _use_, they have the same learning curve.

The average user can\'t even manage this under Windows anyway.

Why would anyone do that in Linux ?

All currently possible in Linux.

I disagree.

There is no difference in _user_ freindliness.

There is a huge difference in system supervisor friendliness, Linux is _far_
more user-friendly than Windows.
because they actually provide documentation, so that you can fix a broken
system

You can\'t do that with Windows. if something goes wrong you have to throw
away everything and install again from scratch because Microsoft refuse to
provide the necessary documentatuion to fix their stuff-ups

What you mean is it\'s not easy for someone without command line experience
to configure a Linux system well. No _user_ should need to know this, and no
user on a Windows system is able to do this either.

IBM dropped sales support for Merlin ( V4.0) well before Win 98 was released
mainly because the lab that developed it was no longer interested in it.
There was some rumours that IBM Australia\'s Global Services division was
gong to pick it up because of a few OS/2 enthusiasts there, but after Lotus
dropped support for it, even IBM weren\'t going to be able to use it
internally anymore,

Not actually true, Leonard.

The reason they don\'t work with OS/2 is the crappy implementation of OS/2s
support for Windows
Read Andrew Shulman\'s articles on the subject in Dr. Dobbs  for details, but
basically, the OS/2 executive patched the live copy of win.exe on the fly
(in memory) to get it to work under OS/2

Obviously, this means that even a recompile of  win.exe, let alone an actual
rewrite could break OS./2 \'s support for it

Virus, Windows and Linux.

DOS - an IBM operating system that was the *second* system of choice
(the owners of first choice CP/M failed to turn up on time for the
sales meeting) was and is a system achieving automation by batch files
that can chain together simple commands. Why *is*? Because it is
*still* the basis of Windows and you will find it buried even in
Windows 98 (although better burried in Windows NT). Automation was
then \'improved\' by building API (programming interfaces) to mimic
these simple commands. That allowed you to add bi-blitting to control
drawing windows on screen as well. Result - "the most complex and
least clearly understood single system in the history of mankind"
(Linus Torvalds).

Linux - a simplified version of the Unix operating system was built as
a college project to make building similar batch files to those in DOS
both easier and more powerful. Essentially, it still works the same
today, replacing the idea of an API by the ability to link together
different sorts of batch controls by sending the output of one as the
input to another. Hence the proliferation of batch languages such as
Perl / CGI and, indeed, the birth of the Internet itself. Windows
could *never* have created or supported the birth of the Internet.

Now imagine the systems in a starship. Like Linux, they may all be
doing different things, but they can talk to each other using, let\'s
say, a super form of HTML. Each chip does its thing and passes the
results on to other chips in this super language. Cymbeline chips
include a mass of different types that can do different jobs. For
instance, one might take navigation tables and whatever the navigation
system is trying to do always passes on the co-ordinates of Cymbeline
as its own result, so an infected ship will head for Virus-infected
space. Another might work in the sensor section and always returns one
of two results - friend or foe - while a third sends a signal from
active sensors that can be recognised as a \'friend\' signal by Virus
chips. So how do Vampire ships behave? Well, it depends on what type
of chip infects each ship and how they interact with each other. You
could even have ships that send the \'friend\' signal but don\'t have
anything to read it, so the sensor chips return \'foe\' for every ship
they evern meet - everyone playing TNE must have run a game with a
rogue Vampire like this, but there are hundreds of other
possibilities.

What we are looking at is *high* automation with *low* individual
functionality - an unusual idea at the moment, but one I feel is most
likely to yield good results. For references, look into modern UK
robotics (not US or Japanese) and the Forest of Sensors (FOS) work
done in the States. And remember - *no amount* of system programming
could "cure" a Virus infected ship if they work like this.

Being slightly fanciful, I liken it to pre-Virus and post-Virus
systems.

Pre-Virus, ie Windows, was almost fully automated and just about
*anyone*
could push a few buttons, tell the computer where they wanted to go
and it
would take them there.  You concentrated on *where* you wanted to go
and
*what* you\'d do when you got there. You didn\'t need to worry much
about
*how* you got there.  Very convenient, but whoa is you if the system
crashes, because you really don\'t know how it works and your idea of
fixing it is to reinstall everything.

Post-Virus, ie DOS/Linux, was much less automated.  The user had to
interact much more with the systems, telling what, where and how to do
everything.  Sure everything is harder and often takes longer the
first
time, but if you can learn it you end up with a lot more control and
can
often find a way to make things work even when things go badly wrong.

Subsidised production ?  Yeah, we subsidise imports in an attempt to kill
the domestic industry.  "It\'s good for the economy !"

The current governments\' policy is to eliminate all tariffs on all imports
in the very near future.

I\'ve always interpreted it that they may chose one skill out of
the cluster group. This gives the player a little bit more
flexibility in character generation than rolling them. Most
certainly they should not get all the skills in the cluster at
once, unless you\'re creating a superhero.

Even in the Imperium you can do a lot 
better than that. The question becomes
what kind of returns can you get if
you are 85, or 90, or 95% full {and

You don\'t necessarily need to have a jingle to sell products. Purina\'s
current Puppy Chow ad in the USA, which shows the puppy carrying around
large tree branches and (eventually) the boy makes me think of a product
which probably exists in the OTU...

VARGR CHOW! Made by whatever company is the 57th century descendant of
Purina. Uses the same foodstuffs as Puppy Chow.
Imagine a Vargr character getting ahold of this stuff.

VARGR: "Say what\'s this?" [PICKS UP BOWL OF PUPPY CHOW FROM DECK]
HUMAN: "Oh, we hope you\'re not offended, but we used to have a dog aboard
our ship before the Zhos killed him. We haven\'t bothered to get rid of his
stuff or food."
VARGR: [SNIFFS, then TASTES] "DON\'T! This stuff is GREAT! Where can we get
more?"

I don\'t think it\'d work for the Aslan though...:) :)

For Chinese space program, I recommend the "Go Taikonauts!" web page put up
by software engineer Chen Lan:

http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Launchpad/1921/index.htm

This will give you historical data, news, and lots of names for Chinese
space scientists, lauch vehicles, programs, satellites, and corporations,
which can be appropriated for naming future space stations, spacecraft
classes, corporations, etc.

This idea would work best on a world somewhere between Sylea and Terra in
Milieu:0.

After arriving at this world, the characters are greeted by an elderly man
decked out in the most outrageous uniform they\'ve ever seen.  Covered with
medal and ribbons, the ensemble is topped of by a huge hat, with even more
ribbons.  The man wearing the outfit politely greets the party, inquires as
to how their voyages have been, and wanders off.

If the players inquire about the man, the locals will laugh and tell them
that it\'s only "Max, Emperor of Mankind and Lord of the Vilani Peoples".
About fifteen years ago, just after the system had regained starflight,
they found a lifeboat in orbit around a nearby star.  Max was the sole
occupant, and had been there for some time.  When revived, the long cold
sleep had affected his mental abilities.

Max decided he was Emperor, and put together his uniform.  He\'s harmless,
the locals will tell the party, and gets all his food and shelter for free.
 He\'s also a spry old man, and has several children from various working
girls (contraception is taboo here).  Max spends his days wandering about,
inspecting his "holdings", holding court on street corners, and greeting
strangers.

The Truth:

Max is Maximillian Aello Hiroshi IV, Emperor of all Mankind and Protector
of the Vilani People.

During the Twilight Period, Max was one of many people to seize the crown
(or a part of it anyway) and declare himself Emperor.  Max did better than
most.  He was travelling to a summit with other "Emperors" to attempt to
stabilize the region when his ship was attacked.  The Emperor was placed in
a lifepod that was set in orbit for later retrieval.  No one survived to
set up the rescue party.  So Max slept on.

What makes this story more than a nice bit of history is where Max\'s ROM
was:  Max made his capital on Sylea, which means that he is the man that
Strephon invoked to gain legitimacy for the Third Imperium.  Max and his
kids, should the truth be uncovered, would be a thorny problem for the
Imperium.

Me, too, for role-playing, but in the 5FW wargame, I
always use that TL 16 unit against the poor TL10-11
Sword Worlds forces, by deploying it on a world in a
system without a gas giant that the Sword Worlds have
to take to make their jump-2 route to anywhere.  (I
think it\'s Saurus.) It just bogs the SWs down for a
really long time and/or forces the Zhodani to send a
fleet to help the Sword Worlds, drawing strength from
their coreward front.

And if you are a *truly* twisted person, you can have them find source
materials. 

If don\'t recall if Eperor Norton ever had any children. If he did, or
you can argue convincingly that he did, but it was "kept quiet", then
have one of the ruling families being able to trace their ancestry back
to him. 

I also expect that the "official" family tree of *some* important
nobles with Solomani ancestry will include King Arthur, or Charlemagne,
if they can\'t find a way to get a Caesar or a Chinese Emperor in there.

I wasn\'t aware that he was involved in *that*. His "real" history (if
omne can use the term "real" :-) is interesting enough.

How about the first "astronauts" being a Mr. Gordon, nicknamed "Flash".
In a ship built by Dr. Zarkov, and accompanied by both Zarkov and Dale
Arden. :-)

Anthony "Buck" Rogers has a timeline that\'s just *too* different.

But have Ming the Merciless be a misunderstood Vilani bureaucrat (or a
rogue Zhodani who misjumped into the area and started setting up an
empire) and things get interesting.:-)

Or pick a "lesser known" future history. For example, the one from Hugh
Walters\' old books. The first "man" in space is a 16 year old *boy*,
launched in a joint English/Australian vehicle (from Woomera). 

Or go with Lester Del Rey\'s books: "Step to the Stars", "Moon of
Mutiny" and a couple others. We first build an earth orbit space
station (classical "wheel" type) *in secret*, using a launch site in
the Pacific. We assemble and launch the first moon expedition there.
And so forth.

An eccentric gent in the late 1800s? named Joshua Norton proclaimed
himself "Emperor Norton the First". And folks in San Francisco (which
was where he was living) went along with the gag!

People would actually accept the money he\'d printed, the newspapers
printed his "Imperial decrees", he got invited to the best parties,
etc. 

Quite an amazing social phenomenon.

Good publicity. I\'m sure that if he was eating there, they\'d get exytra

I get the distinct impression that if the "right" sort of circumstances
had come along, they might have actually "made" him Emperor. 

Say, the North loses the Civil War and suddenly being a US territory
doesn\'t look so good. I could see some political types making Norton I
a figurehead under which they can unite the West Coast, and maybe even
other territory.

So imagine their shock when they find him listed as a *real* head of

Using the aft bay opening as being 10 meters, gives 890 m as the length.
Using the *forward opening (and I thiunk the scene I keep picturing had
the Cylon raider crashing into the *fore* bay) we get about 1500 m. 

So I wouldn\'t rule out the 4 km figure.

Not exactly. But since this is a *patent* we are talking about, the
patent holder has every right to take the program away from you because
it\'s "stolen property".

Of course, if you offer to pay a license fee, they may relent and let
you keep it.

Under US law, as long as you *file* for the patent within a year of the
date of publication, your patent is *not* voided by the public
disclosure.

And if they had published more than a year before filing, anyone who
pointed that out could get the patent invalidated. Which hasn\'t happened.

So odds are that they do indeed have a patrent on LZW *in general*.

Not really. For one thing, because there is no "common vector format".
There *certainly* isn\'t one for web graphics. The only *attempt* at one
is the folks who have ported RIP (formerly a format for BBS screens) to
a web browser add-on.

Given that they\'d have done the same experiments in high school (at
least for the 1st year classes), having the results be so different
would be a teaching *aid*, as it\'d drive home several important points
regarding things like relativity. 

And for the precision measurements, you have some "zero g" labs in the
spin axis. For example, you can use lasers to aid in placing a pair of
masses at a given seperation along the *exact* spin axis. Then you use
the lasers to measure the rate of closure.

They\'ll be puking their guts out *anyway*. This might encourage them to
either not drink as much, or to be more careful.

Well, yes, a vector format is better for line art, but there simply are
not any widely used web-usable vector formats, and the _only_ reason the
.gif is still around as a format is the web.

Yeah, you *can* get the information.  It takes signing a nondisclosure 
agreement of course, and payment of a licensing fee to Microsoft.  Last I 
heard (circa Win95), it was on the order of 25 or 50K.

Wouldn\'t know about that.  I don\'t have W2K *or* a P3-450.

I\'ve got both SuSE & RedHat installed here.  RedHat was the simpler install, 
needing zero CD swaps.  SuSE takes 5 swaps, but it installs a *LOT* of stuff. 
 Took me an hour to go through the list to tell it exactly what I wanted & 
what I *didn\'t* want.  I just did the standard install with RH.
 
ObTrav:  The character\'s ship has landed at the starport and needs a software upgrade to handle some stuff they are installing.  And of course, the new software needs a totally different operating system than is currently onboard.

Well, to be utterly pedantic, no. NT has not a scrap, tittle or jot of DOS
in it\'s underpinnings. There _is_ a DOS mode, whihc is a DOS emulator,
more or less, running under NT, and a command line mode, with many
commands _like_ DOS, but NT is most emphatically _not_ based on DOS.

It is. in fact, heavily influenced by VMS, as the primary architect of NT
was the guy who originally designed VMS for DEC.

Again, not quite. Linux was never a \'simplified\' Unix. It is, properly
speaking, a Unix clone written originally by Linus because he was too poor
to afford what he wanted, which was a copy of Xenix.

It started out having fewer bells and whistles than most Unices, but that
was simply a matter of time.

> Anthony "Buck" Rogers has a timeline that\'s just *too* different.

Not at all, at least not for the purpose of creating an alternate history,
you just have to become a Buck Rogers fundamentalist. You might have to
screw with the official Traveller Universe timeline to do it, but not that
much. In "Armageddon: 2419 A.D." by Phillip Nowlan the world is brought
under the heel of the "Mongols" who use anagathics and really fantastic
high-tech weapons. The "Mongols" turn out, at the end of the book, to be
interbred with extraterrestrials of one sort or another.

The canny Traveller GM probably already has an idea concerning who those
extraterrestrials might be. Maybe "Buck", an early 20th century savage
thrust into the world of the 25th century might have confused the ways and
language of the Vilani with those of the Mongols, which he probably knew
little about anyway. After all, Buck was a World War I aviator who became a
mine surveyor in the mountains of Pennsylvania. We all know that caucasians
have great difficulty telling various races apart!

You can move up the Buck Rogers timeline a bit: the Interstellar Wars start
on earth as Terra attempts to break the chains of their Vilani masters, this
could happen in the same timeframe given in canon, as opposed to the 25th
century of the book and comic strip. I wouldn\'t advise using the comic
strip, however, as it turns out that the Vilani... er... Mongol masters turn
out to be, for the most part, benevolent and the American orgs make peace
with them.

The next major crisis that Buck faced in the comic strip was the belligerent
nature of the Tiger Men from Mars. They wanted, nay, they *needed* to
acquire land on earth. In a very divergent Traveller universe the Tiger Men
are *obviously* land-hungry Aslan working from a base on Mars. The slave
race of humans on Mars could be the conquered remnants of a Vilani colony.
When America became involved in World War II, the Tiger Men became an
allegory, albeit a highly stereotypical one, for the Japanese. As we all
know, the Aslan act like Samurai.

You\'re on your own with the Atomite menace, though, as I won\'t go into my
theories on the possibility of pulling a few surviving miscreant ancients
from a pocket dimension through a dimensional portal. After all, this might
appear to a square-jawed chuckleheaded savage like Buck like creating
bizarre looking people from experiments with atomic power.

"Too different," Leonard said.

ObTrav: Can you imagine a childhood pasttime for Merchant children of 
making lists of worlds to visit within certain date ranges to 
maximize the amount of free gifts one could receive within an 
Imperial year?

1.  Two TMLers, Kenji Schwarz and Doug Berry, have achieved Ace status
(five kills each, within the surveyed time frame).

2.  Three others, Swordy, Chris Seamans, and myself, have two kills
each.

3.  The month of December 1999 has seen _21_ keyboard kills, and we
still have nearly a week to go.

4.  The most lethal day was 18 Dec 99, with _four_ keyboards splorted. 
Two of those keyboards died from the same post (by Doug Berry).

Let\'s try to be more careful, all right?

* Doug Berry awarded me an "honorary" kill, for my "Folies Vargiere"

I note that you arbitrarily started your Keyboard Kills list on October
20th, which was a full two days after my "Important: The Kinunir Warrant"
Post. This identifies you as a Templar agent, intent on underplaying my
status as a hardcore keyboard killer!

The 18th and 19th of October were, by far, my best days. Consider the
following, all concerning that one post:

The 18th of October:

From Erwin Fritz:

"SPLORT! Now, cut that out! I think we need to start posting warnings in the
subject lines of these messages so us innocents with clean keyboards have
some time to prepare!"

From Micheal D. Peters:

"Well,

"Now I finally realize how the Imperium fell on HARD TIMES!

"P.S. Thats\'s at least the fourth key board that a Ditzie related post
has killed! I am going to start recording how and why they died, so that I
can bury these poor brave soilders with the proper honers!"

From Jeff Zeitlin:

"You owe me a keyboard.

"Bastard."

On the 19th, I got one near kill from Jesse DeGraff:

"I sluff of for a day on answering e-mail, and Chris pulls this!  I \'bout
choked on my beer!  Maybe I\'ll take an hour off of Starports tomorrow for a
Ditzie cartoon ;)"

Still, I had three kills on the 18th. Not only would I attain the coveted
status of ace, but I would also hold the record for the most keyboards
killed by a single post.

Coincidence? I think not!

<mumble, mumble>

Actually, congratulations on the compiled list. I didn\'t think that you were
serious!

The Universal Interesting Passenger and Passenger-Related Events Table


This table generates "quirks" for passengers.  For each 10 passengers
seeking
travel, roll a d10.  On a 2 or 3, there will be a "quirk"- roll once on
the table below.  On a 1, there will be 2 quirks.

All rolls are to be made in secret by the GM, who may substitute his own
choice for any die roll, and his own creation for any "quirk" listed.

Not all of these "quirks" offer any real problem to the running of the
ship, but a passenger ship\'s reputation affects how much it can charge,
and that reputation is built on how well the ship\'s staff responds to...
quirks.

01  One passenger is carrying valuables, or secrets... another will try
to steal them.

02-03  Passengers include one mischevious and very clever child.
Trouble ensues.

04-05  Trouble in bunches- one passenger is a single or unaccompanied
parent or gaurdian, and has a veritable swarm (4+) of children in tow!

06  Clearly a suspicious character, the shifty eyes, the way he or she
watches everything around, and turns up in odd places at odd hours- but
it\'s a red herring, this passenger is perfectly innocent.

07  Whoever\'s handling the cooking outdoes himself, or herself, or has
otherwise done somethign dreadful.  The chef, or head steward, or
whoever bought those pre-packaged rations  must make a task roll- upon
success, he or she is congratulated by the passengers, improving the
ship\'s reputation.  Failure, of course, harms the reputation.

08  Passengers include an eccentric artist, who makes bizarre requests
of the crew, accuses other passengers of disturbing his/her stream of
concsiousness, and insists on using an important space as a studio
during the voyage, to produce a work that "simply cannot wait"

09-11  One passenger is very elderly or otherwise infirm, and needs
special assistance.

12 A passenger is a celebrity, (70%) or VIP (30%) travelling incognito.

13-14 A passenger is a celebrity, (70%) or VIP (30%) travelling openly,
fully expecting to be catered to and being the center of attention.

15  One or more passengers has a rare disease which won\'t become evident
for several days.  If the passenger is thoroughly examined beforehand,
this will probably be detected

16-17  A clumsy passenger trips, falls and is injured

18-19 One or more passengers is loud, fussy, demanding, and very
wealthy.

20-21  A group of passengers celebrates their first trip with a party.
Vasts amounts of legal (80%) and possibly illegal (20%) of mind altering
chemicals are consumed.

22-23 A passenger vomits in an inconvenient place.

24 A passenger has lost something small and very valuable, and insists
the whole ship be searched thoroughly.

25  A would be passenger has money for neither passage nor the cargo
space he or she requests, but offers to split the profit to made on this
valuable cargo with the crew, certain that it will bring in a bundle
when sold at the end of the journey.

26  A journalist or writer either (50%) insists on documenting, filming,
etc, all the goings on aboard, or otherwise does so secretly.  For good
or ill, the events of this voyage will greatly affect the ship\'s
reputation.

27  Newlyweds are travelling on their honeymoon.  They are like two
perfect lovebirds- until they have a terrible, emotional argument over
something and insist the captain settle it for them.

28  A passenger commits or attempts suicide (40%)or A passenger commits
or attempts murder, setting it up to look like a suicide (30%)or a
passenger dies of natural causes during the trip

29  Something exotic but innocuous thing brought aboard by a passenger
provokes an allergic reaction in a character.

30  A passenger is a criminal travelling under an alias, (50%) or a
inspector from a government agency or insurance company

31-32  The passenger is rich and eccentric, and makes bizarre requests.

33  A passenger\'s error results in a plumbing problem

34-35  A passenger or group of passengers requests a special diet to
meet their religous or nutritional needs

36  Passengers belong to a religious sect that insists on some sort of
ritual before each departure

37  One passenger neglects personal hygiene consistently, and others
complain

38-39  A wealthy and condescending passenger makes frequent requests for
favors, then tips crew members when the favors are done.

40  What do they say about birds of a feather?  Roll again to determine
a quirk, but now there are 2-10 people with the same quirk.

41  Beware the ides of March!  Passenger begins making "psychic
predictions", typically of impending doom.  50% likely to begin before
the voyage, 50% likely to begin during the voyage.

42  The passenger is a legal activist, who will file a lawsuit after the
voyage if he or she feels the crew has "violated the rights" of any
passengers- or even low level crew members!

43 Thrilled to bits to be on a ship and fascinated with ships in
general, this passenger follows crew members everywhere, asking lots of
questions and being annoying.

44-45  Passenger steals a "souvenier" from the ship.

46  An alarm goes off- its a minor thing, or a glitch, but it causes
absolute panic.

47  This self obsessed and endlessly talkative passenger will bore
anyone unfortunate enough to be cornered into listening to his/her
stories.  But, survive the monotony long enough, and there\'s a few gems
of knowledge there.

48-49  Passenger is a "regular" traveller who makes this trip
frequently- repeat business is assured if he/she is well treated.

50 The passenger is a child, at first seemingly too young to be
travelling alone, but proves intelligent and competent enough.

51  This passenger is extremely skittish, jittery, some would say
paranoid, always assumes
the worst, and will panic at any hint of trouble.  He/She might even
launch a lifeboat.

52  A first time passenger freaks out, even if there is no sign of any
trouble, being affected by the confining conditions aboard ship.  Once
past that, this person is Okay.

53  Disappointed with the bland look of his/her quarters, this passenger
decides to decorate.

54-55  Some people just have no knack for gadgetry- this passenger just
can\'t seem to get anything aboard to work right- doors, fixtures, etc,
and needs frequent help.

55-56  A medical problem- appendicitis, heart attack, impacted wisdom
tooth or something else, occurs to a passenger during the trip.

57  The baggage of two passengers becomes intermingled and confused.

58  A mouse or other small pest is seen aboard ship!

59  A passenger is an old friend/associate/relative of a crew member,
and they haven\'t seen each other in years.

60  A verbose, self-impressed passenger, "was something of a starship
engineer myself, once" has plenty of suggestions for how to improve
things.  Most are ridiculous, some are obvious but not within budget or
have other clear impracticalities, and one or a few are actually
valuable ideas.

61-62  This would be passenger has no money to pay the fare, but wants
to "work passage" offering some service in trade.

63-64  This passenger is in similar straits to #45 above, but even more
desperate, and doesn\'t think to offer any services; but does have a
tear-jerking story.  If work is demanded in trade, it is 50% likely that
this poor individual has no useful abilities at all.

65  The identity claimed and the documents carried by this passenger are
fake, but no ill intent or evil schemes are planned.  This person just
has private reasons for pretending to be someone else.

66   One of the passengers is an undercover law enforcement officer or
spy- and it\'s 35% likely that they have a "professional interest" in one
of the other passengers.

67  This passenger is a professional entertainer, not a superstar but
reasonably competent and known.  Even if not asked, he or she will
become a center of attention and entertain the crew and passengers.  25%
chance of this person being just Awful, and annoying more than
entertaining.

68  Where did that come from?  When all the passengers\' baggage has been
offloaded, there is one case left over- that didn\'t belong to anyone!

69  Each day, for 3-5 days straight, there is a puddle of water in the
same place- floating drops of water in a ship with no gravity- and nary
a clue as to how it got there.

70  This passenger is travelling with a pet- nothing rare or weird, but
a beloved animal he or she treats as almost human and is never seperated
from.

71  One of the passengers is a teenage runaway getting as far from home
as possible.  He or she will pretend to be older than actual age.

72-73  A passenger is facing a special occassion- birthday, anniversary,
retirement, expiration of statute of limitations, whatever.  Another
passenger asks the crew to do something "special".

74  One passenger aims to pass the entire trip in perpetual inebriation,
being, more than anything else, a source of embarrassment and an
irritant.

75  A passenger is a scientist, and realising he or she is on the verge
of something really important, (probably only to the scientist and
peers) begs for use of the ship\'s computer.  If granted, the scientist
will end up using so much of the computer\'s capability that it begins to
interfere with other operations.

76  Lost and confused, this passenger wanders somewhere passengers
shouldn\'t go, and touches something passengers shouldn\'t touch.

77  For no apparent reason, the smell of either the air or water is
"off" and it annoys the passengers.

78  This passenger has an important issue to be resolved right away- but
speaks no language anyone in the crew can translate.

79  This passenger belongs to an organization, foundation, company, etc,
that sends a lot of people on such voyages, and he or she lets the crew
know, of course.

80  Among the passengers is a retired, vacationing, on sabatical, or
otherwise currently unemployed ship\'s engineer, or other such
professional.

81  A passenger is travelling with a rare and exotic pet

82  This voyage makes an impression on this one- assuming the voyage
went well, the head steward (or other individual having the most
interaction with the passsengers) must make a task roll, and success
means the passenger is overjoyed with the experience, and plans future
voyages on the spot, and is even willing to pay premium prices.  If the
voyage was bad, there is the same task roll, but this time, success
means that this otherwise irate passenger was mollified, and won\'t sue.
If the roll is failed, any offer to refund at least 1/2 the ticket price
has a 50% chance or preventing a lawsuit.

83  This passenger makes frequent trips to the ship\'s doctor, demanding
treatment for minor, even non-existent conditions.

84 A highly narcissistic passenger is terrified that shipboard
conditions detract from his or her appearance.

85  Inexplicably, this passenger has gotten onto the wrong ship- or, the
ship isn\'t going where he or she thought it was.

86  Departure time is near, and one passenger, whose baggage is loaded
and ticket paid for, is missing.  This person has run into an
unavoidable delay, and will show up

87  Someone wants to move an item of cargo so valuable that it is
brought aboard almost as if it was a passenger itself, and 1-3 persons
will escort it, seeing to its safety.

88  A dedicated, commission earning professional salesman has come
aboard and sees passengers and crew as a captive audience.

89-90  This passenger\'s garb is one or more of the following:
Outlandish, shocking, provocative, absurd, nonexistent, in relation to
the cultural standards of the crew and/or other passengers.

91  Opportunity knocks. This particular passenger will be non-descript
during a voyage, but if suitably impressed with the crew\'s competence,
will make a very lucrative offer upon the journey\'s end.

92  An otherwise innocent passenger has been used as a "mule" by
criminals- or perhaps secret agents- unknowingly smuggling something.

93  A diplomat is among the passengers.  He or she proceeds to get
thoroughly and blissfully intoxicated on board, then says something that
really, really, shouldn\'t have been said.

94  A nefarious individual wants passage- and cargo space for something
illegal.  He/She is willing to pay extra to move the contraband.

95-96  A passenger has a VERY major beef with another passenger- there
is a 25% chance of this getting violent if left to escalate.

97  While preparation is being made for departure, an extreme VIP wants
to charter the ship for a different destination- and will use either
carrots or sticks to get his or her way.

98  A potential passenger wants to charter ALL of a ship\'s passenger
capability- but wants a discounted rate.

99  The obviously pregnant female passenger was CERTAIN the delivery
date would be safely past the end of the voyage...but there\'s a 50%
chance she was mistaken.

100  They let this one out of the asylum- roll THREE other "quirks"- and
they all apply to this ONE passenger

Actually, it doesn\'t matter. You see, after 300,000 years of
*differing* selection pressures, the odds are that no matter *what*
species you started with, more than a few of the enclaves would no
longer be interfertile with the others. 

It doesn\'t *matter* which species you started with. And remember, we
don\'t know if *time* seperated "species" such as Homo sapiens and Homo
erectus would be interfertile.

Also, keep in mind that after 2-3 *million* years of (genetic)
seperation, it\'s thought that humans and chimps may be interfertile.
Nobody\'s had the guts to try it, given the ethical and moral dilemmas
posed.

OS/2 Warp 3 *red* may have done that. Warp 3 *blue* used code based on

Given that Warp 4 has it\'s *own* Win.exe, your assertions are ludicrous.

    'body' => 'I was first introduced to computers back in 1982, when I was in a Chemistry
Lab at a local High School watching the teacher play some game on an
Apple ][ that had you try to land on the moon according to vectors, courses
and fuel Vs thrust.  I watched for a while then tried it myself.  Mind you,
I had never seen a computer before so at best it was just an oddity.  I
ended up getting the thrust vector wrong and was informed by the program
that I had added myself as a new and rather large crater in the moon\'s
surface.  Frak!  Later that month I saw the teacher listing the commands for
that game (program listing in Applesoft BASIC) and I remember looking at all
that strange code and thinking, "I\'ll never understand whatever that is in a
million years".  I left and the experience was soon way in the back of my
mind, mainly forgotten.

My next experience with a computer was 2 years later when a math teacher
gave the class an assignment to write a simple program on a TRS-80 computer
that would place a character somewhere on the screen.  I still didn\'t really
think about these \'things\' yet so I treated the assignment like any other
home work - I decided it sucked before I started.  :)  However, as I began
doing the assignment, and actually having to learn this weird code,
something else inside me was lighting a little spark.  Pretty soon the
assignment was fun.  I started doing other things like trying to make it
move on the screen.  But when the assignment was over, I was still thinking
about it.  Next week the teacher received an Apple ][+ which sat in a small
room at the back of the classroom.  I started staying later after class to
tinker with it.  Soon I was writing programs and reverse-engineering other
people\'s programs to learn how to make this machine do things.  Man that was
an exciting time for me - learning how to make this odd machine do whatever
I wanted it to do.  I soon spent hours after school programming on that old
Apple ][+.  the teacher trusted me so I was allowed to stay until late at
night.  The only other computer experience I had at this time was the
Teletype terminal in the School\'s Work Resource Area.  It connected to a
WAIS known as the Washington Occupational Information Service.  I used this
to determine a schedule of study for the future.  One time my girlfriend got
a hold of the tele-terminal while I was making some copies.  She didn\'t know
what a computer was, just that it responded when you typed to it.  So, being
a typical girl, she started telling the terminal to ask me out.  She was
non-plussed when it gave it\'s default response :  Huh?  I\'m not sure I
understand you fully.  Please respond with a Yes, No or Maybe.

Anyway, by now the computer bug had bit me really good and I became obsessed
with them.  I would skip classes and stay until 11pm at night, just
programming.  Nothing elaborate, just tiny little things that did stuff like
draw on the screen or make text files on disk.  After I graduated, I bought
a Commodore Vic-20 from a friend.  I remember not really taking it seriously
because I was used to ASCII terminals like the Apple ][ and the Vic\'s
characters looked like something from pre-school.  But it was a computer so
I learned on it.  After 2-3 years, I got a hold of a Hewlett-Packard 125
running C/PM which had  BASIC interpreter software similar to GWBASIC, but
with a totally different ANSI code system.  I programmed on this until 1988,
when I got a Hewlett-Packard 150 using HP\'s version of DOS pre 3.0.  It ran
the same BASIC as the HP-125.  I later switched to the Commodore-64 when I
got one and primarily used it to run my BBS.

My first Operating System was the Amiga\'s Kickstart back in 1990.  At the
time I didn\'t understand DOS commands (or their Amiga counterparts).
Previously I had used BASIC on a TRS-80 level 1, an Apple ][, Vic-20 and
Commodore Pet as well as the C-64.  I had briefly in 1986 booted an IBM PCjr
into "cassette BASIC" (it\'s default when no disk was present).  So I only
used my Amiga for a games machine.  I wanted to run my BBS off it but didn\'t
really understand all the odd references a friend of mine made about needing
to make "sub-directories" for the BBS software.  Up until this point my only
experience had been with either programming simple things in BASIC or
running the Ivory BBS software on my Commodore-64.  I had purchased the
Amiga thinking it was going to be just like the C-64 only faster and more
powerful.  When I discovered it wasn\'t, I was pretty disappointed.  Here was
this weird GUI with icons and stuff.  :)  I went back to the C-64 for most
of my serious computing and left the Amiga500 for games and Demos.  In 1992
my brother gave me a Hewlett-Packard Vectra 286 running at MHz with a
special HP DOS 3.0 and some weird Hewlett-Packard software running on top
like Desqview.  With the help of a buddy with another 286 (who was a lot
more DOS savvy than I was), I learned DOS in about 2-3 hours.  After all,
it\'s a lot simpler than BASIC.  Suddenly making DIRs, copying and moving
files, etc, seemed second nature, almost as easy as breathing.

The 286 only had an old Seagate 40meg hard drive running off an MFM
controller card.  The drive was the first to go.  Since the BIOS on the
motherboard was so proprietary and outdated, a replacement drive had to come
with a controller card with onboard BIOS for the new hard drive (131megs).
So I learned how to do things like setting BIOS and configuring devices in
DOS/CMOS.  All we used back then was DOS and my buddy and I scoffed at
windows, vowing never to use it.  How we used to snicker when we heard
people talking about Windows 3.0..:)   If we used a GUI at all, we used this
program called QuickMenu.  Then of course, I got windows 3.1 with my next
computer which was a 386sx33.  Suddenly I was in the Windows world.  I still
wasn\'t sold on windows yet and did most of my work in DOS.  Then I upgraded
to a 486 and by that time lots of cool stuff was coming out for Windows so I
found myself using DOS less.  Then in 1995, I built my first Pentium system.
I formatted the hard drive and bought Windows 95 (upgrade version) and
installed it.  I\'ve been using \'95 since.  However I quickly learned that
the OEM version  (2.5) was a lot more stable than that crap they pass along
to the general public.

Anyway Frank, sorry for being so long-winded, but I wanted you to have some
idea where I was coming from when it came to OS\'s.  I realize that many on
this list have been more fortunate than I in their computer experiences
(some having Unix backgrounds, etc) but I don\'t think I am doing too poorly
given my history with computers.  I learned what I could fairly quickly and
often fixed problems that support techs couldn\'t help me with.  So cut me
some slack about being an OS-newbie, ok?  :)

Thanks for that excellent compilation.  We should
remember that it\'s a game of skill as well as luck. 
Many of us would have been splorted if we\'d drunk
first and then read, instead of vice-versa.  (I\'ve
read many of those near-hit posts, but collecting them
would be even more above and beyond the call of duty
than you\'ve gone.)

I\'m surprised that December, the last month in the
study, has the most kills.  You\'d think we\'d have
learned not to drink before reading.  

Now where do I go to download my splort sticker?

Purina Mills makes hundreds of types of Purina * Chow, mainly for zoos, etc.

For example:

Purina Rodent Lab Chow
Purina Horse Chow
Purina Deer Chow
Purina Goat Chow
Purina Monkey Chow 
Purina Monkey Chow Jumbo
Purina Ferret Chow
Purina Trout Chow
Purina Cow Chow  (small change in the formula produces Purina K\'kree Chow)
Purina Nurse Chow (No!  It\'s for nursing baby cows)
Purina High Octane Hog Chow (for your Harley)

Much of the really exotic chows are being sold under the Mazuri name
(www.mazuri.com).

GIF and PNG both are there to fill a gap that is not filled: downloadable
display graphics.

For web pages, GIFs are often far more flexible than JPG\'s. GIF\'s can be
made in 1, 2, 4, or 8 bit, in a variety of sizes. They are generally fairly
low in overhead. They include a pallate of colors, and so are flexible. The
are bitmapped, and so can be displayed with minimal processor cycles.

It takes about 2 times longer to display a .jpg as a .GIF on most machines
I\'ve worked with; I\'ve not seen ANY vector formats supported by stock
browsers.[1] Heck, the only vector formats I\'ve seen discussed that I can
open are .ps and .pdf; both are slow.

[1] by stock, I mean AS IT INSTALLS. No plug ins from ohter packages. Yeah,
NS and IE, with the acrbat plug, will display acrobat pdfs....

<<Snipped excellent table of passenger quirks>>

Wow!  Thanks, Thomas, for that great table of ideas and possible
adventure scenarios involving strange and bizzare passengers. Be sure 
to thank Ben for us. I\'m sure a number of these can be expanded into 
some very interesting scenarios. Now, if I can just get a game 
going...  :(

BTW, are you going to post this on your website or something?

	Very big reason to, as it has a strong effect on later choices.
Choosing a distribution affects the very layout of files on your
filesystem, as they *are* different. It also affects what other
software is installed besides the kernel itself, and how it\'s
configured. Not only does this affect something as simple as figuring
out where your log files are, it also impacts installing new
software--files may not be where the author expected them, and
third-party software the author relied on may not be present. GCC vs
egcs and libc vs glibc both critically affect your ability to install
precompiled binaries, as they are *not* completely compatible. Or do
users now need to be able to compile all their own apps? Yes, various
distribution formats are making this easier ... but still not as easy
(for Joe Public) as inserting an AutoRun (*gag*) CD into WinXX.

	And every time somebody tries to propose setting "standards" for
Linux, all hades breaks loose. Some have gotten through, but I
remember some fairly upset letters to Linux Journal this past year
after they ran an article about standards efforts

	Most users can, in fact, manage to install new software. Otherwise
CompUSA would go out of business, as the only software anybody would
use it what comes preinstalled. And this is exactly where the lack of
a *single* standard comes into ugly play.

	Mind you, I think we\'re sounding like the choir squabbling in the
back of church, as I\'m a very fervent fan of Linux and the whole open
source idea. I just don\'t think it\'s quite there yet.

	OBTRAV: Yes, I promised one, and this one should be obvious ...
installing new software into your Type/S had better be *much* easier
in the future. You\'re certainly not going to take it all the way back
to the original world of manufacture, nor will your average crew be
able to write an entire flight control package from scratch. And a
monolithic design like WinBlows (or Wince ...) certainly won\'t cut
the mustard.

	Think of all the fun you could have ... let your players hear about
some new software gewgaw they might like. Maybe Planet X\'s forte is
offensive software (not that kind, that\'s simply a matter of taste),
and the crew thinks they can just plug in a new version of Predict to
get an extra 20% of performance, while cutting usage by 10%. Only it
just doesn\'t go that easy ... *Really* devious refs will let them
THINK it went that easy ...

Would you happen to know the location of a rip plug for the mac? And, if
so, then I\'d be looking for a RIP generator.

I know that RipTerm did more than just graphics... it was a wonderful tool
for BBS\'s, but it didn\'t really catch on (at least locally) since it
required rip enabled server and client software... And RIPTerm really blew
for non-rip sites.

For the non-initiated, various RipTerm boards allowed several methods of
operation, including: DL Graphics on demand; "Front-End Files" which simply
downloaded specific content into a locally cahced front-end; and Front End
with auto-update on connect. One BBS I dealt with only supported the second
mode; you had to download the RT front-end files in order to get any RIP
materials. A few others only did Graphics on Demand, and so RIP connection
was slow! The graphics files themselves were compact vector images.
RipScript was a combined RIP Graphics and Ansi Text media for delivery of
content. The result was comparable  to HTML, but somewhat smoother.
However, it didn\'t support the range of file-types that HTML did.

Unfortunately, all it shows is that H. Sapiens N. is probably more accurate.

In any case, they were separated from the H. Sapiens Sapiens (*US*, in case
you\'re unaware, good reader) by a mere 30 thousand years. It is, according
to what I\'ve read, basically accepted that there have been several
sub-species of H. Sapiens, including Cro-Magnon, Sapiens, Arcanis (SP?),
and by some accounts Neanderthalensis. The divergence point from which
arose the Neanderthals is probably some 60KYA and the replacement dates to
about 40KYA, so that\'s about 20,000 years. BTW, I\'ve read (and heard on
Wild Discovery, as well) that modern polar and Grizzly (N Am Brown) bears
diverged from a common ancestor about 15KYA.

>Just a notion

And, as Leonard has pointed out, there is some suspicion of interbreeding
capability with Chimps. There are rumors of it from africa, but they are
not scientifically substantiated.

Likewise, we KNOW that many diseases have crossed species barriers as
STD\'s; we\'re just not able to conclusively proove that the crossover
occured by interspecies intercourse! (Syphillis is supposedly related to a
rather harmless vaginal infection in sheep; HIV is known to have been a
less lethal virus in monkeys. It is interesting to note, though, that the
multiple origins of medeavil syphylis outbreaks radiate from areas of
intensive sheep farming...)

We tried that.  Much of Northern California and souther Oregon was caught
up in a movement to declare independance from either the union, or just
from Southern California in the early forties.  They had a constitution,
laws and even a one-aircraft air force that later lended its name to a

When one makes a suitably silly post, it commonly causes the reader to
forcibly eject whatever he happens to be drinking at the time onto the
keyboard after a scenic tour of the sinus passages.

Since most keyboards are not designed to accept coffee or soda at near-c
velocities, it causes them to fail.

Some of us live to produce this effect in others.

IMHO, there are two types of sports:  Spectator sports and participation
sports.  Spectator sports might well be gravball and similar team
activities - much on the order of a Roman circus (with or without the
bloodshed :^< .)

Look at football.  US or European, it doesn\'t matter, the point is lots
of action, identification with a particual social group, etc., etc. 
Also basketball, which caters to shorter and shorter attention spans,
with lots of points scored, rapid changes of the lead, and plenty of
opportunities for commercial breaks.

Participation sports, OTOH, will be low tech as possible:  archery,
black-powder firearms, fly-fishing.  In one chapter of _A Sand County
Almanac_, Aldo Leopold talked about the obligatory lack of practicality
in a good hobby.

Just Say (tm from another list) I wonder what a K\'kree steeplechase
event would look like??

They also have the ability to "rasterize" an image for "quicker"
display. Basicly, it\'s an interlace option. Every 8th(?) line is
displayed. Then the "4th" lines "halfway" between them. Then the
"second" lines, and finally the last pass fills in the remaining lines.

This is great because it means you get an idea what the whole picture
looks like *long* before it finishes downloading. So you get to decide
if you want it or not much earlier. 

Compare that with JPEG\'s "top down" (just like "regular" GIFs) and BMPs
"bottom UP".

Hit the Telegrafix web site and get their RIP add-on for your browser.
It even supports Bezier curves.

Oh, ok, in that case RIP doesn\'t count either. But it\'s a damn good
start. I rather hope they manage to survive and get some market share.
Currently, I think the problem is the abysmal quality of most RIP
drawing programs. Especially the edit functions.

Maybe some ambitious programmer will grab the source for one of the
"open source" low-end CAD programs, and a copy of the ripscript
protocol (which, BTW, sticks to *printable* characters, thus making it
immune to several type of network glitches).

I think you\'ve misnamed it. Sounds more like a Cliff-izer to me. After

Apparently you can also import PCX files into a RIP screen somehow.

It also had sound, though it was limited by using the PC speaker.

I think that with some work, incorporating it (or something similar)

Well, it *used* to be "homo neanderthalis" (or something like that).

More recent studies of the existing bones have led some to conclude
that they are actuall the same species as us!

Well, as noted above, there are some who argue that they were never a
seperate species anyway.

Fairly strong. There\'s a lot of debate as to whether humans and
*chimps* are cross-fertile and that\'s after 3 *million* years of
seperation.

<description of early computer experiences>

Hey, I started out in my Junior year of High School. I was recommended
by my electronics teacher to a no-credit course in programming at a
local university (Gonzaga U in Spokane). That was 71-72. I learned to
use a keypunch and learned FORTRAN. And got to hand in the card decks I
punched to be run on the IBM 360 they had. 

I got extra credit in my Logic class for writting a program to test
logical expressions to see if they were tautologies. 

I took a year of computer programming at a community college, but I
flunked out. But in the process, I learned Assemly language on an *old*
Honeywell mainframe (which had less than 32k of memory, with each
location storing a 6-bit "word"). I learned BASIC using a terminal in
the Library to access a time-sharing system. Which is where I ran into
directories for the first time. That was 74.

In 1980, a housemate got a TRS-80 model I, and I was the one always
straightening out his programming mistakes. In Dec 80, I got my own
system a TRS-80 Model III (which I still have, though muchly upgraded). 

I won\'t go thru all the other systems I\'ve had since then. :-)

Currently (well... 5 years ago when I studied archaeology at Uni) it it Homo
Sapiens Neanderthalensis, one of several \'archaic\' varieties of homo
sapiens. \'Modern\' Humans are Homo Sapiens Sapiens, and are first seen in the
archaological sources from c120-100,000 bp. Archaic Hom. Sap varieties date
from c 4-300,000bp to c35,000bp

I\'m a member of the Society for Creative Anachronism.  Within
that organization, I am a herald.  A number of years ago, I was a
member of a group that examined requested coats of arms, and
advised whether they were compatible with the rules and styles
set forth by the SCA.  One of the submissions, associated with
the name "Justinian the Sluggard", was blazoned (described) as
follows:

Chequey of three, gules and argent, a slug passant sable.

For those not savvy in the language of heraldic blazon, this
submission consisted of a field of nine squares, alternately red
and white (five red, four white, the center and four corners were
red), and in the center was the black profile of a large slug.

The immediate reaction of every herald at that commenting meeting
was "Purina Slug Chow".

That\'s tres bizarre!

And I thought _I_ was sick for translating "Yellow Submarine" into
Arabic, and part of "My Way" into Russian....

BTW, as far as you know, do the Elvius songs "scan" in Latin?  (In other
words, can you sing them in the target language, to the original music?)

Unlike other lists, we don\'t have a history of objecting to long

My experience is that .jpg sucks for most pictures.
Blonds usually look sun-burned, images blur together at
the edges, etc.

Perhaps you could recommend a vector format that will

I missed the earlier portion of this; however, I would like
to receive a copy.  If you can zip everything up and send it to
me, I can probably reformat most of it.  For portions that
do not require internal calculations, I can put them in HTML
and post them to the web on your site or on mine.

Actually, there are two sets of laws in the uSA.  The
oldest is called Common Law and is decended from
English Common Law.  The second is Equity Law and is
also derived from English Equity Law, which was
decended from Roman Law.  A citizen is actually not
bound by Equity Law unless s/he decides to be so
bound.

ObTrav: Perhaps there is a similar dicotamy in Imperial
Law.

Sadly, Telegrafix doesn\'t have a mac plug-in. They announced (in their
press releases section) that one should have been available by mid year
1999...

as I said, I have used RIPterm on a 386/sx over a 14.4... it resolved as
fast as .GIF and .html over a cable modem on my 6100/60... If they did RIP
stuff for the mac, I\'d buy a copy, and use it for WORK!

Or even better, the first people on the moon are a
crazy old professor and a couple teenage boys, who are
very distressed to find the nazis got there first
(they\'re going to launch nukes from the moon to
conquer the earth, but the lads and the prof take care
of them, bringing one back to earth for trial) Now
THAT was space opera!

OK I admit it. NOW I\'m lost! How did Sumerian become the basis for the
Vilani language when the culture didn\'t exist 300,000 years ago?

Frankly, I learned almost everything I know about computers and programming
myelf as well
Though I did a computer science degree, that taught me notyhing about actual
programming, and we were not taught any languages, just told to submit
assignments in them, we had to learn them ourselves.

Books are useful.

Visual Basic doesn\'t make any sense to the people that wrote it.

It\'s like one of those pioneer houses that have been lived in ever since
with bits added on every fifty years or so in the style that was current at
the time, a real hodge podge of hacks and almost-working things.

Caldera give away DR-DOS 6.0, and alomg with it you can get a DOS-based,
fully-graphical browser that supports HTML 4.0.

It\'s designed for kiosks, but is great wherever yo need fuill browser
capability on machines that can\'t run windows and have very small hard

There are two parts to this answer

1 - When Marc Millar et al were developing the game "Imperium" they used
Summerian sound frequencies (ie the frequency with which vowel and
consonent sounds appear in a language) to generate Vilani names.

2 - Many people then extrapolate out from this that in the Traveller Universe,
the Summerian civilisation was founded by a group of errant Vilani.

The best argument against PDF is that as of versuion 3 (or was it
version 2) there is *no* DOS viewer. Unlike most of these other
format\'s you need a simply *huge* program to view PDF.

And as I recall, EPS isn\'t much better.

It\'s more likely that things like Visual Basic are *event*-driven,
while your older BASIC programs were procedural. That\'s a *big* shift
(and one I\'m not that comfortable with yet).

In procedural programs, you write a bunch of procedures and run them in
the needed order. This is determined by the programmer. 

In event-driven code, the code basicly sits in a loop waiting for
"events" (mouse clicks, keystrokes, etc). It then jumps to procedures
for handling the event.

The programmer has very little control over the "flow" of the program.

ps. as far as the job market is concerned, I have neither training nor
much experience.

Jason, this is the second time you\'ve said omething like this. I
suggest that before you get yourself into a *world* of trouble, you ask
the people who\'ve told you that you aren\'t bound by what you call
"Equity Law" unless you choosde to be to provide citations for cases in
modern US law where this "defense" has been used *successfuully*. 

To be blunt, it\'s *not* your choice. Everyone that has tried this as a
defense has been convicted. You live in the US, you are bound by the
laws of the US.

Any further discussion of this is off-topic, and should be taken off
list. As should any further assertions about not being bound by US
civil and criminal laws. 

Discussion of hypothetical future societys that *do* operate in the
manner alleged may be on topic.

Nope. Doesn\'t count. Mac & cheese requires *cooking*. "People chow" has
to be edible direct from the shipping container.

It also has to be suitable as a long term diet (ie you have to be able
to live on "people chow" and watere *indefinitely* without coming down
with deficiency diseases or other nutriotion related disorders).

I\'m certain that some world *have* something like this, and use it for
feeding prisoners and/or welfare clients.

I\'m curious as to what it was that caused the spew in the first place.
Such a list would likely be an amusing read. (And I can\'t remember what

The random-syllable tables that were developed for Vilani have the result of
making Vilani sound (superficially) like Sumerian.  And that a few Vilani
words and names have been deliberately constructed to match Sumerian
words.  Why this was done, you\'ll have to ask someone who was around
at the Creation.  I suspect it was simply to make Vilani sound authentic
but exotic. . .but some folks have inferred an in-game connection between
the Vilani and Sumeria.

Such are the odds, yes. Of course, _Solomani_ claims that the human races
beat the odds and that all surviving human races are interfertile. As I
said in an earlier post, I think that\'s going too far in the other
direction. I think that_some_ human races ought to have diverged more 
than that, but that\'s just my opinion. Canon says otherwise.

But it does matter, because you can\'t apply the logic the other way round.
If _Homo sapiens sapiens_ has diverged so much from _Homo <something>
antiquitus_ that we are no longer interfertile with it, _Homo sap_ would
not be interfertile with ANY of _Homo antiquitus\'_ other descendents.
 
>It doesn\'t *matter* which species you started with. And remember, we

No, but if we could somehow prove that _Homo sapiens sapiens_ and _Homo
erectus_ WERE interfertile, then _Homo erectus_ would actually be _Homo
sapiens erectus_, not _Homo erectus_. That\'s the whole point of the
taxonomic difference between species and sub-species.

Enough to produce fertile offspring? You\'d have to show me a second-generation
_Homo chimp_ to convince me of that.

And Thomas Vickers writes:

If modern man and neanderthals could interbreed, neanderthal would be a
sub-species of _Homo sapiens_. And whether they could or not has no bearing
whatsoever on whether all the humans of the 3rd Imperium can interbreed or
not. According to _Solomani_, they can, so the chance that they can is 100%.

How plausible this is is a quite different question. Personally I\'d say \'not
very\', and I wouldn\'t mind it if the Powers That Be changed the canon a bit
here. But that actually has nothing to do with my original points, which were
that 1) any human race capable of interbreeding with _Homo sapiens sapiens_
is a subspecies of _Homo sapiens_ not a separate species, and 2) that if even
a single extraterrestial human race is capable of interbreeding with _Homo
sapiens sapiens_, then their closest common ancestor (ie. the hominids the
Ancients collected 300,000 years ago) was also a subspecies of _Homo sapiens_.

There is an \'advertisement\' in a supplement for the old FASA Star Trek RPG
where it lists:

Andorian Chow
Vulcan Chow
Terran Chow
and
Terran Chow with Cheese

The last two (along with Vargr Chow) have actually appeared in my Traveller
campaign.  You always wanted to know what those really cheap food packs
tasted like...

Purina Monkey Chow is readily edible by humans.

Uhh, check Unisys\' web site. This is a net UL; they have _no_ interest,

So what you\'re saying is that 300k years is long enough for some groups to
drift far enough that they couldn\'t interbreed, yet 2000k years isn\'t long
enough that all groups would have?  Those are some error bars! :-)

As to trying to breed chimps and humans, I\'m kinda surprised that no one\'s
tried an in vitro fertilization, just to see what happens, if we really are
that close. Can you give me a reference for that?  (All my sources, which
admittedly aren\'t extensive, assume separate species with no interbreeding.)

I think the debate is still going on.

According to an article in the January 2000 Scientific American ("Once We
Were Not Alone", Ian Tattersal), H. sapiens and H. neanderthalensis
co-existed in the Levant for as long as they behaved similarly.  In Europe,
where H. sap. arrived with different technology, "the repeated pattern at
archaeological sites is one of short-term replacement, and there is no
convincing biological evidence of any intermixing in Europe. In the Levant,
the co-existence ceased-after about 60,000 years or so-at right about the
time that Upper Paleolithic-like tools begin to appear. About 40,000 years
ago the Neanderthals of the Levant yielded to a presumably culturally rich
H. sapiens, just as their European counterparts had."

There\'s a lot more, which I don\'t have the time to type in. Might be
available online at www.sciam.com, or you can get the magazine at any
decent library.

Then your experience is with jpeg\'s that are over compressed, or you are
using 256 color mode to view them. Jpeg\'s are a 24-bit format, and look
really bad in 256 colors.

Properly compressed jpegs are quite good and hard to tell from
uncompressed photographs. Most software that creates jpegs has a
compression value that you set when saving them originally. (In photoshop
it\'s a slider from 1 to 10, with a few intermdeiate stops between whole
numbers.) Even the \'highest quality\' settings reduce file sizes quite a
bit, without significantly altering the percieved quality.  Still, given
that the original files are usually _huge_, most people crank the
compression way up to get the size down, and quality suffers quite a bit.

In my experience I rarely set the compression lower than 8 or 9 (highest);
this gets an average 800x600 2-3 meg picture down to 100-250k with no real
visible loss of quality. That\'s more than most people want to use for web
purposes, so they will crank it up to 5 or 6 (Good quality) and the image
starts to suffer.

There are other, less used compression methods that can crank giles down
to incredibly small sizes with less loss of apparent resolution, using
fractal comression techniques. Unfortunately, they\'re expensive, both
monetarily and computationally.

ObTrav...the next time your PC\'s plant that pinhead-sized AV bug on
someone, remember that a) there\'s a hard limit to the number of pixels you
can have at your disposal, (how many pixels _can_ dance on the head of a
pin?) and b) a harder limit to the amount of data that little thing can
transmit.

Show them a horribly pixellated mpeg with a ton of artifacts and tell \'em
this is the results of their surveillance.

BASIC a dead language??? HAHA, not bloody _likely_, cobber! VBasic is
still going strong, and there is a really nice implementation on the Mac
called RealBasic.

C++ is not really a \'higher level language\' (an old joke definition of C
is: \'a language with all the speed and power of assembler, with all the
ease of use and readability of assembler.\' ;-), it\'s just that there are
better _compilers_ for C and C++.

Look at Visual Basic thusly: like _any_ GUI oriented program, what it does
is sit around and wait for the user to do something, then fires off a
sub-routine to handle that.

VisBasic started to enforce object orientation (even though they didn\'t
call it that) which is what C++ trieds to put onto C and other languages
have more or less successfully employed as well (I even saw an OO version
of _COBAL_ a while back!).

I\'d suggest one of the SAMS "Teach yourself XXX in 21 days" they have ones
for C, Perl, C++, Java, and maybe other languages; they\'re not half bad
for walking you through what you get in a \'formal\' education. (In my case
one FORTRAN course, back in 1977, executed on punch cards) Most of what I
learned about programming I taught myself on my old Apple ][+ ;-) Now I
are a Powerbuilder, Perl, HTML and RDBMS hack! (definitely a hack...I can
get it done, but it ain\'t pretty, usually) All learned by diving in and
trying to make sonething work.

And Visual Basic will make as _seamless_ a Win program as Vis C++ will.
You\'ll just have to upgrade it.

It would certainly be less remarkable than the fact that cats and skunks
or horses and donkeys can sometimes produce offspring.  I think that not
trying it is a matter not of guts but of taste.  Who would want to have
sex with a chimp?  I realize that someone weird might do it once if there
were no other options for getting off (they think AIDS came from green
monkeys in Africa, don\'t they?  I don\'t know, I don\'t work with any
virologists...) but to do it repeatedly enough to get a chance of starting
a pregnancy... who would do that?

By the era of the Far Future I bet someone\'s tried it.  And that the
results may be a minor race on some planet somewhere.

I think this hasn\'t been tried because of the fear of public opinion.
Remember how all those conservative Christians got bent out of shape about
IVF in the very beginning, back when the LBB\'s were new?  And all the
restrictions on the use of human fetal tissue and unused embryos.  I think
that any research facility that tried this would be endangering itself and
its personnel.  I also think that it will never happen in any country
where research is supported by grants because there is no philanthropic
organization that will fund this and any corporation that did so would be
subject to serious questioning.  People would think they were trying to
breed slaves/supersoldiers even if they weren\'t.

I had a friend in elementary school who loved to eat dogfood. The
supermarket in our neighborhood kept the big bags of dry dog food at
the front of the store by the exit. Sometimes these bags would be torn
and a little bit of the chow would spill out. My friend would grab a
handful on the way out and eat it like a snack on the way home. Good
lord, did his breath stink! Thank got he grew out of that phase.

Finland has been popularizing the use of Latin for
several years to emphasize the commonality of European
cultures, and to show that Finland itself is really
part of Europe and European culture (doubts about that
are expressed, usually in jest).

Ob Traveller:  Your mileage may vary regarding swings
in the popularity of Old High Vilani.

This is pretty bizarre.  Do we have a good idea of
what Sumerian sounded like?  Was Sumerian tonal, like
Vilani?  

>Are there any Finnish folks on the list?

Kylla on, but I\'m only half, and born and raised in
the USA, so I\'ll eagerly await the comments of the
Finns from Finland.

I think a lot of kids do that.  I never liked dog food when I was little
but I did like cat food.  I thought it was like a meat-flavored cereal
(which it is).  I am allergic to corn, so it would make me sick if I ate
very much of it.

However, I have never known an adult to willingly do this.

Part of the thrill when you are little is that you know that the adults do
not want you to do this.  You are getting away with something.  It\'s not
actually that the stuff tastes wonderful or anything.  Probably you would
eat it only once out of curiosity, but when you saw how people reacted,
you just had to do it again.   At least that is how I felt when I was in
second grade...

Of course, when I was a little kid I also liked to eat my uncle\'s MRE\'s,
TV dinners, and McDonalds\' hamburgers.  I liked many things when I was a
small child that I now think are totally disgusting.  Cat food is not even
close to being the worst of them.  MRE\'s were fun to eat because we could
pretend we were soldiers or astronauts.  They didn\'t taste good but they
did taste good because the imagination provided its own seasoning.  McD\'s
was similar because it was just a fun place for kids to be.

There is also the fact that my mother can\'t cook.  I mean, she really
can\'t cook.  Leathery steaks, dry hard pork chops, vegies straight from a
can without seasoning... and minute rice!  (I can cook Japanese style rice
on top of the stove without a rice cooker.  But I didn\'t learn from her!)
There are so many foods that I thought I hated until I ate them cooked by
someone other than my mother that it is just not funny.  My mother\'s pork
chops would frighten a shugilii.

My father is actually a good cook, but my mother insisted that cooking was
HER job.  This may have been a contributing factor to their divorce...

When I was a child, I actually liked school food better than home food.
So maybe it is not too surprising that I enjoyed cat food and MRE\'s as a
small child.  I never had a weight problem until I left home, LOL.

There was enough set up that I expected the punch

Well, the Beatles themselves released a record in
German (although their German fans proved to prefer to
listen to them in English).  I\'ve tried to make Yellow
Submarine work in German, but I\'m not much of a poet:

wir wohnen alle
in einem gelben Unterseeboot

einem gelben Unterseeboot

ob Traveller:  We don\'t have much of a musical
tradition in canon, which makes sense for a book-based
game.  Still, as publishing goes more to CD, it will
make sense to add an audio component.  We all know
what the Empire\'s theme song is from Star Wars; the
Imperium and the other powers and players ought some
day to have their own, too.

Well, from what I understand, and I may well be wrong, aren\'t MRE\'s in
theory nutritionally balanced and edible direct from the container without
cooking.  So the US Army already has Human Chow... (probably sub-contacts to
Purina... <g>)

That\'s really a matter of translating skill, jockeying phrasing around so
that the lyrics still scan. My old latin teacher had a gift for that. I
remember the class singing "Wenceslas prospicit Rex..." en masse one
Christmas.

Ah, happy days... (I\'m *allowed* to think that now - it was five years ago!)

That\'s not quite right.  In general, anyone (citizen
or not) within the territorial jurisdiction of the
United States or of any State is bound by law, whether
characterized as legal or equitable.  There are of
course some exceptions (that\'s what lawyers are for),
such as, for examples, parties to a contract agreeing
to be bound by the law of some other place (which may
or may not be enforceable for various reasons that
took most of a semester in law school and so I won\'t
go into here), or immunity for diplomats.  

A perhaps more useful analysis is to look at law in
the United States as divided into common law and
statutory law.  Common law is law made by judges based
on what other judges have done in the past in similar
factual situations.  The common law tradition was
carried over directly from England. 

Statutory law consists of legislative enactments.  It
comes from the legislative branch of government with
the approval of the executive branch.  Executive
regulations, which are promulgated pursuant to
legislative direction, are part of this branch of the
law.

The creation of a legislative branch is new relative
to the judicial and executive branches, but was well
established in England by the time of its colonisation
of the New World and other places.  

The judicial branch may interpret statutes and thus
create a quasi common law, which has become very
important.

>ObTrav: Perhaps there is a similar dicotamy in
>Imperial Law.

I don\'t think so.  The background for Imperial law
will be Terran military and Vilani legal traditions. 
Neither will give rise to a legal/equitable
distinction.

It isn\'t too bad.  It tastes a bit like very, very dry granola.  Mind you,
one wouldn\'t *want* to attempt to survive on it, but with a supply of clean
water, I believe one could.

The US govt has used MREs as humanitarian supplies to various parts of the
world - with various amounts of success.

In order for it to be Purina * Chow, it has to be mostly homogenous,
preferably come in large bags in bulk, able to be stored for a long time,
and have the taste and consistency of gravel.

MREs, despite rumors to the contrary, actually do have differentiated
ingredients.  Kinda.

    'topic' => 'The Pakari...',
    'body' => 'Greetings, All,

I\'ve been thinking (a dangerous pastime, I know,) about developing a 
sector for a new campaign I someday hope to run. One of my initial 
considerations has been toward the races that populate the sector in 
question, and designing a new and interesting race with which to 
challenge the players. Enter the Pakari, a minor race that has 
relatively recently obtained jump technology from a neighboring major 
race, and has since started on a wave of conquest and absorption.

My first concept of the Pakari was that the Pakari are master
bio-engineers and possess biological versions of common technologies,
similar to the Pentapods of 2300AD or the sauroids of Harry H
Harrison\'s West of Eden series. In essence, all of the items we would
construct through fabrication and manufacturing, they grow and
develop through manipulating biological lifeforms to accomplish the 
same function. Certain elements, like perhaps fusion reactors, 
anti-grav modules, and jump drives, may have to come from alternate 
sources, but biological entities represent the remainder of their 
technologies. Computers are actually creatures with large, efficient 
brains, whose sole purpose is to store and process raw data. 
Firearms are replaced by small creatures with gas chambers that 
project bone shards at extreme velocities, or with nervous tissue 
along a bony barrel which produces intense magnetic fields, 
projecting a metallic bone fragment at high velocity, using gauss 
rifle concepts. Space exploration began through the 
controlled explosive release of digestive by-products, and the 
Pakari have since developed lifeforms to protect them from the 
reaches of deep space, i.e. living spaceships, etc. And so on.

Having conquered their world and their system, the Pakari possess
some form of manifest destiny, and believe that they are destined to
integrate all life under their benevolent control. Upon their first
encounters with other life, the Pakari began a racial movement
toward the integration of these other life forms. Now, they slowly
spread throughout their subsector, absorbing other worlds in a
manner not unlike the Borg of the Star Trek universe. They have
symbiotic creatures designed to override, control and augment
captured target species, creating a biological monstrosity under the
command of the Pakari race. Of course, the Pakari think that they
are the good guys, the shepherds and shapers of the universe, the
rightful heirs to the biological birthright granted by the stars. 

I personally think that the concept of these biologically oriented
Borg-types should be sufficient to create an uneasy feel in the
players when they are first encountered. They would be appropriately
alien, both in appearance and psychology, and should make for a very 
interesting enemy encountered occasionally by the PCs in their 
travels about the sector.

For concepts regarding their ships, consider the ST:TNG episode "Tin 
Man," or the Pentapod vessels of 2300AD. For a grasp of some of their 
other technology, Harry H Harrison\'s "West of Eden" series contains 
a lot of examples, with living sailing vessels, guns that must be fed 
to stay alive and keep firing, and so on. For the conquest of other 
races, consider mixing aspects of the Bugs from "Starship Troopers" 
with Heinlein\'s "The Puppetmasters" and of course the Borg from the 
ST universe.

What I\'m looking for now are some of your thoughts on this concept,
before I jump in and do a complete Contact-style write-up on the
Pakari. Here are some basic questions I wanted to ask.

First, and perhaps most important, do you think players would be 
intrigued by the race?

What are the major problems with the use of bio-engineered tech, and
how would you recommend overcoming them?

To what level of energy production (fission, fusion, etc.) do you 
think a biological equivalent could be created? What TL would that 
approximate for vehicle design purposes?

Could the effects of anti-grav be duplicated biologically, in your 
opinion? (Determines whether the Pakari will need a servitor race to 
build a/g modules to integrate into their living vessels.)

Could the effects of thruster or HEPLAR technology be duplicated 
biologically? (See above comment.)

Could the effects of jump drives be duplicated biologically? (See 
above comment.)

Any other thoughts, considerations or recommendations?

Thank you in advance for your time and input. I know that, for better 
or worse, this list will give me their honest opinion on the concept 
of the Pakari, and I look forward to any helpful suggestions anyone 
may have to offer. Thank you.

All this for only 0.02Cr,

No one knows.  No one knows how many vowels it had, or how many
consonants, or what some of them were, either.  Our knowledge of Sumerian
phonology is entirely dependent on Akkadian transcriptions of Sumerian
words, through the Akkadian phonology (which is still iffy in a few places
itself, for modern scholarship).  All that can be said for sure is that
Sumerian probably didn\'t sound much like Akkadian or other Semitic
languages at all, and certainly nothing like we pronounce it today. 

If we wanted to be pedantic, we should have said that _Akkadian_ (or some
sort of proto-Semitic language) was a descendant of Vilani (stranded
management consultants, etc.), not Sumerian.  If there was anything like a
tidy development into Sumerian, then "Vilani" would probably have included
the vowel /o/, velar nasal /N/ (very possibly labialized, /Nw/),
labiovelar stops /kw, gw/, grooved affricate or retroflex /dr/, and a
fortis:lenis distinction in the stops, not a voiced:voiceless one.

The fact that this is _not_ the case I take as confirmation that the
Templars have been tampering with our data for far longer than originally
suspected.

I get the distinct impression that if the "right" sort of circumstances
had come along, they might have actually "made" him Emperor. 

Say, the North loses the Civil War and suddenly being a US territory
doesn\'t look so good. I could see some political types making Norton I
a figurehead under which they can unite the West Coast, and maybe even
other territory.
>>>>>>>>>
The _Castle Falkenstein_ game setting from R. Talsorian games has
this exact thing happening. Mark Twain is a representative of the
Great Bear Empire on the west coast of North America, and Norton 
is Emperor.

As for Traveller players hearing of an Emperor Norton the First, and
"finding" source materials: it\'s entirely possible that the source materials
they find are actually portions of RPG sourcebooks or other fictional
materials that have, due to the age of the materials, been misinterpreted
as fact. Thus the players will *think* they aren\'t in Kansas anymore, 
while they\'re actually sitting right on Auntie Em\'s doorstep.

I knew what a ford was, but if you asked me what the Ford in stream was
I might answer differently. And listen, I\'ve hiked lots, read lots of
fantasy (looked at maps a dallas) and I still don\'t know what a knoll is.

I used to think I was fording streams when I was hiking but it turns out
that I am just too close to the ocean to do that. There are some brooks
in the area, but I was greatly surprised to discover that the stream I 
regularly crossed was the Hackensack River.

There are random acts of sitcom in my household every night. "Those socks
have holes in them!" "No one will see the holes because they will be under
my shoes!"
A few episodes later I receive 3 dozen socks from my wife. "Oh, thank you
so much honey, just what I needed!" We then go over my parents house. They
have given my 4 dozen socks. (This was the Christmas episode. The one guy
who can\'t stand to eat sweets any more (takes me two weeks to get through
a chocolate bar) gets all this candy that I can leave around the house for
everyone else (I think especially my wife)).

Growing up in West Virginia it was not at all unusual to see a Ford in a
stream.  We used to say it was an acronym:  Fix Or Repair Daily.

I wasn\'t thinking of situations like that.  Sorry if I offended you.  I
know it is more common than people think, and I wish it were less so.

I was referring, as was the original poster, to recreational pet food
eating, one of the many nasty habits otherwise well-behaved children
indulge in without parental permission.  I\'ve known quite a few former
children who did this in homes where there was plenty of people food
available.  In other words, children who chose Purina over Pringles when
their parents weren\'t looking.

LOL!  The best cat food is actually a kitten food that you can only buy at
pet stores and it comes in a purple bag.  I deliberately forgot its name
so that I\'d never be tempted again.

> -Chow-chow-chow

You get a gold star for that one.  If I had had a Jolt handy, you\'d owe UC
a keyboard.

ObTrav:  wondering if humans are ever tempted to eat Vargr or Aslan food,
and if so, is it any good?  I had a character once who was in love with an
Aslan but she never got him.  I guess she didn\'t have enough property,
even though she did have a title.  Wonder what they would have eaten on a
date...  Actually I imagine that Aslan food would be good, if heavy on the
meat side.

I don\'t even want to think about eating with K\'Kree.  

And Vargr probably love smelly things.  I wonder what Vargr think of
limburger cheese.

Another disgusting thought... you know, if you have ever had both cats
and dogs at the same time, that some dogs will eat cat sh*t...  I wonder
if Vargr will eat that.  Do they consider it a delicacy?  Can you imagine 
being a Free Trader and taking a "load" of this substance to a Vargr
world?   Can you imagine being at a diplomatic event and finding out WHAT
that stuff on the party tray actually is?

Dogs will eat much grosser things than cats.  (That is something that I
hope no one on this list has ever been tempted to do, yuck!  And this is
why you should never eat after a dog.  You don\'t know what the dog ate
last and you can be sure it did not brush its teeth.)

Sable is indeed a color, but as presented (I think the blazon
should have been "... _overall_ a slug..."), the slug was not
entirely on the central red square, and so squeaked by that way.
Also, it should be noted that the reason for the color-on-color
prohibition was to ensure good contrast; red and black are
generally held to have acceptable contrast on simple
presentations.

There have been studies done on kids though and a lot of kids eat strange
things.  Kids eat dirt, kids eat paint (this is why you\'re not supposed to
put lead paint on walls), kids eat clay, kids eat paste (I know a LOT of
people who loved that white paste we used in Kindergarten), kids eat Play
Doh, and kids eat cat and dog food.  That is why you have to child proof
your house and why you don\'t stop doing that just because the kids are
such and such an age.  I thought the white paste was much more disgusting
than cat food, but my second husband says it tastes just like Miracle Whip
(which I also hate).

I worked in a nursery school for a while and I heard kids talk about and
saw them attempt to eat all sorts of things that we did not permit them to
eat.  At least cat and dog food are intended to be eaten by creatures that
are not too biologically different from people. Play-Doh is not.

Pregnant women also eat weird things.  Strangely enough the only time I
was ever tempted to eat cat food as a grownup was while pregnant.  It must
be some kind of hormonal thing.  I know a lot of pregnant women sometimes
eat clay.  All my pregnancies were bad and unsuccessful so I sometimes
wonder if I should have eaten it.

Kids are weird.  It\'s just a fact.

Ew, I will never be able to look at that stuff the same way again!  

Actually a friend of mine sent me a recipe for a litter box cake. It\'s
supposed to look like a cat\'s litter box and you are supposed to decorate
the top with Tootsie Rolls.  EW!!!

Think that they would go for that?

I still remember a dessert I was once served long long ago.  It was some
kind of chocolate cake mixed with pudding and it looked like dirt but it
tasted wonderful.  My friend put gummy worms in it.

Either _AM4 Solomani_ or _Solomani & Aslan_ have references to this, maybe
both. Uplifted chimps, orangs, and gorillas.

And, IMTU, there are uplifted bobcats, uplifted dogs, and Dolphins who\'ve
been modified. Note that the uplifts are not as far nor as pronounced as D
Brin\'s uplifts... nor even the Vargr...

The field is evenly divided metal and color, and so may be treated as

Such heraldric punning is common.

Let\'s see if y\'all can guess WHY I stuck A Pendragon PC with the following
Canton

...Upon a Canton Sable in sinister, a one-eyed serpent arising from its
coils statant regaurdant Argent.

(punch line to follow in a later post).

Ob Trav: How many of you assume some form of heraldry in the 3I? Is it
standardized? How high a rank before one is awarded a device?

Does that really surprise you?  If the mere idea of cloning raises
world-wide reaction, imagine the storm over attempts to create
"monkey man!"  Okay, *I* know that\'s a misnomer, but I can see the
screaming headlines now.

"Uncle Don" was far from "crazy". 

And that future ties in fairly well with a few other Heinlein stories.
"Space Cadet" for example. Even if you delete the Martians and
Venusians, there\'s still a lot of good background material.

And there\'s PowerBasic for the PC (a descendant of TurboBasic). Their
web site (www.powerbasic.com) also has a shareware FirstBasic that you
can download. It costs something like $20-25 to register, and all that
registration gets you is a disk, and a command-line version of the
compiler (FBC) to go with the interactive Version (FB). Oh yeah, the
money you pay for FB counts towards the purchase of PowerBasic.

So far, I\'m doing just fine with FB, as I don\'t have a lot of need for
the extras in PB. Main reason I registered was to get FBC, so my make
files would run more smoothly. :-)

If you think C is bad, grab one of the freeware/shareware APL

I\'m still trying to figure out how to *apply* my theoretical knowledge
of OO to actual programs. With no success. I can\'t figure out where to
*start*. 

Anybody know of a good book on OO prgramming in Turbo Pascal?

Not true. The stuff has to taste halfway decent or the critters won\'t
eat it. But that doesn\'t mean it can\'t be *bland*.

You ever try the stuff they *used* to issue? The Air Force version was
"In flight meal packs". Essentially, the same cans as in C-rats, but
with a slightly different accessory pack. No cigarrettes, no TP. 

I used to buy them back when I was in Boy Scouts. I\'d take *one* along
to eat the first night of a camping trip, since after dragging
everything out of the truck and setting up camp, I didn\'t feel much
like doing a lot of cooking. Tossing the "main course" can into a
canteen cup full of water and putting it on the fire to boil for a
while was just about right. 

Heck, after a while, the whole patrol was doing the same. We did "real"
cooking for the rest of the trip, but for that first night, the meal
packs were just fine. 

Heck, the various "cakes" in the dessert can were mostly pretty good.
The main course usually *tasted* ok, even if the texture was often a
bit weird.

I\'ve had MREs a few times. They are ok. Nothing to rave over, but ok.

I used to be on a *tight* budget. I was living on rice, cheap frozen
veggies, and TVP (textured vegetable protein). The "chunk" TVP came in
three flavors, and the chunks were 1-2 cm on a side. The were supposed
to be soaked in water or else cooked slowly with some extra water. But
they could be eaten dry. 

The consistency varied. The "chicken" flavor was about the color of
white chicken meat, and fairly hard. The Ham flavor was a darkish red,
and crunched nicely. The beef flavor was dark brown and way too hard to
chew on without having been soaked a bit.

I did play "people chow" games with them a few times. Alas, the store
that had them in the "bulk foods" section went out of business years
ago, and I haven\'t tracked down a new source.

What\'s it *taste* like?

Given the way JPEG compression works, it\'d either be really easy or

I assume these are "student dissection labs"?

Whether or not I\'d help would depend on how the above is parsed. If
it\'s student\'s *doing* the dissection, thanks, but no thanks. If it\'s
students *being* dissected, then that might be interesting. (I\'m sure
that *anyone* who has ever taught *anything* can think of a student or
two they\'d like to see on the dissection table... :-)

For *years* I wanted to be able to *show* people why I screamed in
outrage every time a TV show zoomed in on small details in an image
*recorded* from a typical, *cheap* surveilance camera. 

It\'s only recently that I\'ve had the "technology". And it was *so* nice
to be able to explain to someone by taking a 640x240 GIF image and
"zooming" it to to show the problem.

Enhancement can eliminate artifacts, but it *can\'t* generate info that
isn\'t there in the first place.

The experimenters would be doing it in vitro, not in vivo. Given the
strength of a chimp, you\'d be taking your life in your hands to try
having sex with one.

It\'s in numerous books and articles. And it\'s the moral/ethical
dilemmas that are why no one has tried it in vitro. You\'d have to deal
with questions such as "is this to be treated like a fertilized human
egg? Or as just another animal experiment?" And if you implanted the
egg and let the pregancy go to term, are you going to use a human or
chimp host? Either way, the ethics get sticky. And if you get a viable
*birth*, things *really* get sticky.

Also, another reason for not doing this may be that conciously or
unconsciously, the researchers are *afraid* of the answers they might
get. 

For example, if they get a successful chimp/human hybrid *at all*, that
calls treatment of chimps (and gorillas since they are only
fractionally less related to us than chimps are) into question.

If the hybrid is capable of producing viable offspring (with humans,
chimps, or other hybrids) then the fat is *really* in the fire. Because
that would essentially mean that Genus Pan And Genus Homo *aren\'t*
seperate species. And I\'d bet you a cookie it\'d take no more than a
month after word got out for PETA or some other rights group to file
suit on the grounds that chimps are *human* and every facilty holding
them is guilty of crimes from kidnapping on up. 

If the hybrid proves to be able to *speak*, then it gets even worse.
Especially if he or she is of anything *approaching* "normal
intelligence".

Agreed, that\'s *really* unlikely. But even getting sterile "mules"
would be enough to argue for merging the Homo and Pan genuses.

There\'s also the infamous line about olive oil, cod liver oil, corn oil,
peanut oil and baby oil.

I had never heard of that.  I hope I haven\'t been drinking it.  (Kiri chan

I would also imagine that such a thing would be sterilized (I hope).

I was actually wondering if Vargr would breed and/or raise cats to produce
the best tasting "stuff".  Ew!  I must stop this now!

There\'s a prof here that only I get along with and I know what they say
about HIM.

(I never wanted to dissect any of my students.  I did, however, have nasty
thoughts about the head of the department.  The only student I\'ve ever
wanted to cut on was the one who suggested that I should give him an A in
return for his "services".  I don\'t know what was more insulting, the
supposition that I could be bought, the supposition that I wanted his
services, or the supposition that I would be desperate enough to exchange
grades for sex.  But there was only one part of his anatomy that I felt
like dissecting.)

Hum, I would think you might want to hydrate it in a bit of that water.

IMTU, the standard ration is called an Instaheat.  It is basically
an MRE with built in heating and cooling, pull the tab and it heats
your entre and cools your desert, or vice versa.  Some are good,
some are passable, some you fost off on the unsuspecting, but that\'s

A male human might be in danger from a female chimp.  I wonder if a male
chimp would respond to a female human.  Not that any female human I can
think of would want to, but then again there is some really weird porn out
there.  I would think if the scent were right and she presented herself a
male chimp might go after a female human.

As I said above, the hybrid might not be able to speak out loud, but would
almost certainly be able to do sign language.  And yes, that\'s a huge can

Can we compromise with ethnically diverse babes in thong bikinis? Or, for a

Oh well.

>ObTrav:  wondering if humans are ever tempted to eat
>Vargr or Aslan food,and if so, is it any good?  

The DGP alien modules discuss this subject a little,
but I don\'t know how much of the following comes from
them and how much from my own thinking about it.  

Vargr cuisine is as varied as Vargr culture, which is
if anything more varied than human culture.  So the
following are extremely gross generalizations.

Vargr cuisine from all cultures is heavy on the meat
dishes, but Vargr do typically eat all sorts of other
things, depending on where they live and what\'s
available.  For example, Vargr eat grains for
carbohydrates.  Many Vargr like insects, arthropods,
and slugs.  Fruit, especially odiferous fruit, is very
popular.  Some like crunchy things, some like slimy
things, some like spicy things, some like bland
things. Some like alcohol, some abstain.  

Many human dishes are acceptable without modification
in Vargr cuisine (lamb shanks and Astroburgers come
immediately to mind), and many Vargr dishes can be
served unaltered at a human table (e.g. roasted groat
leg and stuffed sea bear).  Some Vargr love human
dishes that some humans won\'t touch (sashimi, e.g.),
and vice versa (crunchy sweet insectoids with spicy
sauce).

Caveats for human and Vargr diners:  Because Vargr
have more robust digestive systems than humans, their
food preparation may not as clean as human standards,
which can lead to humans experiencing problems ranging
from mild stomach discomfort to severe or even fatal
food poisoning to parasites.  On the other hand,
chocolate and certain food preservatives commonly used
by humans are quite toxic to Vargr.  

>And Vargr probably love smelly things.  I wonder what

>Vargr think of limburger cheese.

I\'m sure it\'s a delicacy, just like pickled herring
for breakfast.  

>Another disgusting thought... you know, if you have 
>ever had both cats and dogs at the same time, that 
>some dogs will eat cat sh*t...  

That\'s another can of worms, so to speak.  Some Vargr
chew on a prey\'s or an enemy\'s scat to understand more
deeply what it\'s been eating, and, therefore, how it
has been living.  As my good friend and frequent NPC
Ve Naghfuaz once said, "it\'s a spiritual thing for us.
 We don\'t expect you to understand it, and we
appreciate that you respect it."  

>Dogs will eat much grosser things than cats.  (That

This reminds me of another little-known aspect of
Vargr life, which is the feeding of pups.  Like their
Terran ancestors, Vargr breast feed for the first part
of their pups\' lives, but the rapid growth of the pups
outstrips the ability of mother\'s milk to nourish. 
For the next stage of the pups\' lives, Vargr parents
eat large amounts of food and then vomit it up for the
pups.  The pups lick their parents\' faces to trigger
this reaction (and Vargr vomit very easily).  The
pre-digested food is easy for them to eat, and
pre-digestion kills many parasites and other problems.

Vargr baby food should accordingly never be given to
human babies.

Can we have some ethnically diverse GUYS in sexy outfits please?  (I\'d
settle for seeing just ONE illo in an SF game book that looks like someone
I\'d really go out with.  I\'ll go for the sexy skintight leotard, or the
"corsair" look, or even a futuristic suit, but I just got GURPS Traveller
yesterday and the sexiest guys in the book are the Aslan, lol!  I haven\'t 
read the whole thing yet but at first scan, most of the males depicted
are pretty ordinary-looking guys and almost all white.)

No. Heraldic contrast can be reduced to a black and white

with most anything (in this case, anything but red and white).

for the modified free trader using my MT rules.

Then I tried modifying the standard blueprint to show the modifications.
Well, I discovered that the standard blueprint is about twice the size
it should be. I\'m assuming that two deckplan squares is one displacement

Does anyone know where I can find a blueprint for the free trader that

Check out bombardier beetles. and consider the fact that there\'s
nothing to prevent use of small stones as reloads. It\'s *much* faster

I doubt that biological tissue can generate (or survive) that sort of
fields required.

And BTW, you\'ll never get "high speed" computing biologically. The
impulses between nerves travel too slowly.

Do keep in ind that even if their *primary* tech is bio, there\'s no
reason they can\'t have "crude" electrical and mechanical technologies.

Keep in mind Niven\'s "Stage Trees". Also, Elf Sternberg has a sequence

topc. Unless the erotic content bothers you, the sequence *is* worth

Component size (cells), and the limited envirnomental range they can
handle. 

The only *real* way to overcome them is to branch out into "conventional"
technology.

Fusion is almost certainly ruled out. Fission is going to be really
hard to deal with.

I suspect that this (like computing) is a case where they\'ll have to go
with a non-bio solution.

Don\'t concentrate so much on trying to duplicate "our" technology
biologically. Concentrate on the stuff that they can do "easily" that
we have to work at. Like life support systems, and terraforming.

I don\'t remember the name either (we fed it to my sister\'s cat
when said cat was at the kitten stage), but I\'m pretty sure that
it\'s the kitten chow from the same people that make IAMS and
EUKANUBA.

I count those as legitimate kills, mostly because I have enough
control that when something hits me like that, I _can_ swallow
first.  Necessary self-defense measure; when I was a lot younger
than I am now, my father took great pleasure in making me emit
milk from my nostrils.

Well, other than the question of table manners, I don\'t
necessarily see a problem; the menu would of course be vegetarian
- - vegan, perhaps - but that doesn\'t rule out the possibility of
pleasant and interesting combinations of flavors.

Chances are, no unless they have a bad diet. After keeping dogs and cats,
and watching the dogs acting like the litter box was a buffet, I asked the
vet.

The answer I got was simple, dogs who eat  poop, weather it is dog or cat do
so because they have dietary deficiencies and the poop has too much
undigested/left over protein in it. So, if the food is right and the animals
are fed correctly poop ain\'t so tasty :0

A helpful hint, put  Meat Tenderizer on the food, apparently this makes it
VERY uninviting after a trip through and animal and dogs won\'t eat  the left
overs.

What are you, crazy? The lab that tried that would get
burned to the ground by christian evangelists. Humans
and chimps? Does the name "Dr Moreau" ring any bells?

Mind you, I\'m sure if you searched hard enough on the
net you could find some interesting photography of
more, um, "direct" experiments along such lines.
Certainly every other bizarreness imaginable is on there.

Could it be possible that the deckplans you are looking at are 4
squares per dton rather than 2 squares?  That\'s they way I draw
them, each square is 1x1x3.5 m for the 14 m3 dton, or 1x1x3.375 for
MT/CT dtons.

    Eukanuba is an example of why a "Science Diet" for pets is a good idea,
wild dogs eat the entirety of their kill. That\'s the offal, bones, contents
of the intestinal tract etc. Dog food that is bought in supermarkets is
essentially horse meat, nothing else. It doesn\'t contain many of the
important additives that dogs require so they go looking for it in their
environment, eating grass, scats and so on. On top of that, tin foods are
90% water, that\'s the most expensive glass of water you\'ll buy today.
    I wonder if Vargr were confronted with many dog diseases that were
unknown to them when the Solomani made contact for the first time,
Parvovirus is a particularly virulent disease that attacks pups among many
others. Maybe the Vargr have a bad impression of Humaniti from this, it
would go a long way in explaining the behavior of Vargr corsairs if they
thought Humans were "dirty."

It also doesn\'t rule out the possibility of a plate of

I\'m sure heraldry would be present in some form - all the other trappings of
empire are there, and what kind of a court isn\'t in love with such relics of
the past?

I\'d imagine Knights may be awarded devices for their lifetimes at any point
after being Knighted, and all higher ranks have heriditary heraldic
trappings.

It\'s not something I thought about a lot before, though.

\'Oversized deckplans\' seems to be a recurring problem - the best known case
being the Empress Marava Far Trader.

However, (assuming a 1m deck grid) I think it\'s closer to four squares to
the disp tonne. The guidelines in FFS1 suggest a deck depth of 3.5 metres
including all the ventilation, ducting and other gunk between floors. Since
a dT is 14m3, this means that each dT has a footprint of 4m2, or four one
metre squares.

Personally, I think 3.5 metres verges on the ridiculous, and tend to go
closer to 2.5 in my calculations. However, this doesn\'t give you such nice
numbers (5.6 metre squares per dT).

If you\'re using 1m squares, you should expect somewhere between 800 and 1200
squares for a 200dT ship. If you\'re using a different size, then please
ignore me.

    Wasn\'t the official deckplan 1.5m x 1.5m? I think they listed a Dton as

Actually, now I think about it I\'m sure it varied between rulesets. The TNE
disp-ton was 14m3, the volume of 1 metric tonne of liquid hydrogen, but I
think the value used in CT and TNE was different. (Although I don\'t think it
was as small as 6.75m3 - I could be wrong.)

    I knew the grid is 1.5m x 1.5m in MegaTraveller and Classic Traveller
but I was wrong about the volume, it\'s 9m³ or 4 x 1.5m² according to Traders

    Actually, Jason, you\'re off the mark on the Common Law statement as
well.  The Federal government and the majority of the individual states
(there are some exceptions, New York I believe is one) are governed
solely by statutory law.  Common Law has NO standing in US, or most state,
courts.  Locally, we just went \'round and \'round on this one a bit back with
the local fundies who tried to overturn a local ordinance prohibiting
discrimination based on sexual preference because sodomy was against
the Common Law, despite the fact that Indiana is a statutory law state and
our last anti-sodomy law was struck down by the State Supreme Court as
un-constitutional and never replaced 20+ years ago.
    ObTrav: The difference between statutory law and common law is that
common law is unwritten and usually based on precedent and public opinion
while statutory law is solely made by some sort of legislative body
or other govermental entity in a written/published form.  Imagine a players
frustation on a planet where all law is an extreme form of common law.
I.e. a "jury" is convened for each charge and can determine without
limit the criminality and apropriate punishment for each and any act.

Yes, some sort of civet or mongoose or something in Indonesia eats the
coffee berries and excretes the bean; apparently its digestive tract does
something to the bean that makes great, or at least special, coffee once
it\'s roasted.  I\'m still trying to get a hold of this, but even when I

No, not exactly.  If I\'m not mistaken...

MT/CT had 13.5 m3 = 1 dton.  So, 2 of the 1.5 x 1.5 x 3 m squares
was 1 dton. Each square = 1/2 dton.

TNE used 14 m3 = 1 dton.  It used 1 x 1 x 3.5 m squares and it took
4 to make a dton. Each square = 1/4 dton.

I would have to say that a statement such as Kiri\'s does _not_ count as
a keyboard kill (mainly because I\'d have to go back and recount!). 
Think of that as a "You shoulda seen the one that got away!" situation. 
However, if the would-be victim _awards_ the poster an "honorary kill",
that _does_ count (so far, I\'ve seen two since I began the TML KCL
project).

Your skill, Jeff, merely makes you a harder, and thus more-prized,
target.

Nope, you have to look at *volume* not square meterage.  MT/CT used
13.5 cubic meters per dton.  

If you use a 1.5 x 1.5 x 3 you get 6.75 m3.  Two of those equals
1.35 m3, and you have your dton. So, each 1.5 m2 square is 1/2 dton.

Probably not. I was just thinking that I find it annoying that male

I would like to see some good looking men and I would like it if more than
one was black and I would especially pretty pretty pretty pretty please like
it if any of them were Asian.  And I would like it if there were more
attractive body types other than hugely muscular.  Slender is nice on men
too.

There are cattle stations in the outback that are larger than England.
Admitidly, these are pasteral leases and thus can be challanged for native

Sorry, your last sentence is just plain wrong.  The
common law is alive and well in the various states,
although some have more a more complete statutory
scheme than others (like California, where I
practice).  Louisiana alone among the states does not
have a common law tradition.  There is even a body of
federal common law, although it is quite small in
scope compared to that of the states.

In every state, statutes govern the criminal law, for
obvious due process reasons.  The laws governing
torts, contracts, and conflict of laws are typically
left to common law processes.

Here\'s a variation:

Litterbox Cookies


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
- ----  ----  ----
                        Chocolate ingredients:
     1/2  cup           honey
     2/3  cup           (1 and 1/3 stick) butter or
                         margarine
   1                    egg
   1      tsp           vanilla -- or peppermint
                         extract
   2      cups          whole wheat flour
     1/3  cup           cocoa powder
                        grape-nuts(tm) cereal
                        Gingerbread ingredients:
     1/4  cup           honey
     1/4  cup           molasses
     2/3  cup           (1 and 1/3 stick) butter or margerine
   1                    egg
   7      cups          whole wheat flour
                        spices-ginger, cinnamon, cloves to
                         taste(maybe 1/2 tsp each)

                        Mix-ins:
                        coconut
                        chocolate chips
                        butterscotch chips
                        peanut butter chips

To make:
Microwave the honey till it bubbles(about 1 minute). add the butter, and
the molasses, if any.  Add the egg, mix well, then mix in all the other
stuff. Add mix-ins of your choice to some or all of the batter.

Chill 1 hour in the freezer or several hours in the fridge.  Roll dough
logs of random length and the diameter of cat poops.  Roll logs in grape-
nuts and bake at 350 degrees till done (10 to 15 minutes).

Serve in a disposable cat litter box on a bed of Grapenuts, with a cat
litter scoop.  I hear you get lovely effects by decorating the box and
scoop with melted chocolate or pudding.

This recipe worked especially well at the Halloween party where the table
was already decorated with plastic flies


                   - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

NOTES : There are two flavors-chocolate, and gingerbread.
       The cookies are dense and not very sweet, this is necesssary
       so that they will keep their shape during baking.  If you use white
       flour or sugar they may be tastier but they won\'t look like shit.

  Oh, that\'s nasty.  That\'s worse than serving little Girl Scouts "Dirt".

Crumble up 1 package Oreo (or cheap imitation) cookies.
Make up 1 large package instant chocolate pudding.
Mix 2/3 cookie crumbs into pudding.
Place in a childs beach pail.
Sprinkle remaining crumbs on top.
Stick plastic flowers in the top.

If I\'m serving to children I get the "Gummy worms" and mix them in before I
put it in the pail.  But I\'ve found most adults don\'t like them.
If you want it to look like grass on top the dirt just color shreded coconut
with green food coloring and sprinkle on top instead of cookie crumbs.

By, say, TL 10 or 11 it ought to be possible to build a "food
synthesizer".

Essentially, you feed it random organic "stuff" and it produces "people
chow". It\'ll have trace element and viatmin reserviors, but will only
use them if needed. And it\'ll have a display that indicates if whatever
you\'ve fed it has such things, and at what levels. It can "recharge"
from such, though there\'s some wastage. 

Definitely "survival gear". And probably large enough that it\'d only
be in a ship\'s boat that was equipped to double as a lifeboat.

It\'s a small hill. Basically a rise in the terrain.

A Gnoll is the evil critter. I like the "Grassy Gnoll"... I think I\'ll
steal that one for my DL5A game.... Supposedly a dog-headed hominid. I

    I\'ve always liked the Hyenas, mean critters. They out mass every other
predator in Africa apart from a male lion and are quite capable of taking
out lions if required. An interesting Traveller species:
(Hyenati Corsair Pilot) "Captain, a big fat trader is on the screen."
(Hyenati Corsair Captain) "*Yawn* Wait until the Vargr attack it and then
we\'ll pick up the scrap. I\'m off for a nap. If the Vargr attack Us, wake me
and we\'ll hit \'em with the spinal mount."

All MT plans I\'ve seen assume 1.5x3x3m per Td; that\'s 2 squares, each with
a 3m ceiling.

All CT references I\'ve found say 14m3, but deckplans use about 2 squares of
1.5x1.5 with 3m ceilings, and a little extra for the decks.

TNE was 4 1x1x3.5m blocks per Td on official deckplans... really annoying
when trying to use Snapshot or AHL rules with them!

For reference: Snapshot and AHL are CT products; they both use 1.5m squares
for movement rules. AHL is effectively Striker on a grid. Snapshot is Bk2
with action points and a grid.

I\'ve been speculating about an Imperial College of Arms.  Functions include
registering devices, but also taking care of the business of tracking who
has a claim to what title.  They do genealogical work, vet prospective
heirs to make sure they don\'t fail to be worthy of noble rank in some
respect, administer the oath of fealty to the Emperor in cases where the
noble can\'t make it to Capital for investment. . .

Gotta figure the Emperor can\'t actually do all that himself.

Highly amusing.

Personally, though, I\'d choose available cargoes from my 1993 edition of
the Emergency Response Guidebook.  Pick four or five materials,
including some with really unpleasant-sounding names such as Methyl
Isocyanate [ID#2480] and Trifluorochloromethane [ID# 1022], then throw
in a seemingly-innocuous material such as Aluminum Powder (uncoated)
[ID#1396].  Naturally, since all of these items are considered
"hazardous cargo", there is a Cr 500/dton shipping bonus for carrying
these materials.

Note that the Emergency Response Guide [Guide #40 in the 1993 ERG] for
aluminum powder (uncoated) lists the following potential hazards:

May ignite itself if exposed to air;
May re-ignite after fire is extinguished;
Violent reaction with water produces flammable gas;
May be poisonous if inhaled

Quick story: When I left school I worked at a printers, we had little
buckets of Aluminium Pigment and one of the guys flicked a smoldering
cigarette butt into an open one. Very Impressive!
    He sees this flare-like fire and thinks "I\'d better put that out" so he
stamped on it with his work boot.
    It blew the the bucket to shreds and put him in hospital for about a
month, strangely enough, it didn\'t blow his foot off. Lady Luck smiles on
the truely stupid.

Two points. First, definitely not (unless your into Orca fat). Second,
(here\'s where the flames hit) why do we have to have cheese cake to
begin with? Most people do not make it on the cover of Cosmo or GQ and I
would wager that the same would be true in the Far Future. Your average
adventurer is gonna be just that. Average. If your going to push for a
TU that is more diverse, you shouldn\'t be stopping with the beautiful
people.
Throw out Barbie and Ken! I liked GI Joe anyway.

I thought that was canned Chef Boyardee ravioli...:-). You can also use it as 
mass driver projectiles!!! (and I now duck from starting the silly MDC thread 
all over again...:-).

BTW: I was looking at an old Bugs Bunny cartoon as I was channel surfing. It 
was the one with Yosemite Sam and they each drew larger and larger revolvers 
(9 shooter, 10 shooter, etc.) at each other. Until recently 5 or 6 shots was 
all ya\' got (except for certain .22\'s...). Now there are 7 and 8 shot 
revolvers on the market. I thought that this was a great sneaky trick for a 
GM to pull on his/her players. Tell them that they are facing a person with a 
revolver. As the firefight gets underway, SOMEBODY is bound to count shots. 
Imagine their surprise when they rush an empty weapon, and find out the hard 
way it\'s not...:-). It\'s VERY satisfying to burn munchkins this way...:-)

Kiri,

Don\'t worry.  The coffee is from South America and costs on the order of 
$100 per pound--not something you find in your local grocery.  
Apparently, the coffee has a "richer" taste.   Here\'s what Dave Barry 
had to say about it:

Both "raterized" and "interlaced"  actually mean something completely
different from what  you are both describing, which is "progressive
decoding/encoding"

The original JPEG format did this by default, it was designed for the
purpose.
I think GIF can now do this as well.

Rasterized means any image that is displayed line by line (so BMP is a
raster format)

Interlaced is as described above, but can\'t be done while downloading unless
you also use a progressively encoded format. Interlaced mode is used to make
it _look_  better in certain display formats, not display while downloading

JPG was designed for that gap, GIF and PNG were not.

JPG\'s are actually far more flexible than GIF, irrelevant of where they are
used. Size can be any size, bit depth can be anything from 2 to 32, and
compression can be trinmed to what ever level desired, including none.

The benefits that GIF"s have over JPGs for web use are support for
"see-thru" colours and animation, and they use "lossless" compression. But
of course they are only "lossless" if the original picture is one of the
limited number of supported formats. If it isn\'t, and most non-digital
photographs aren\'t, then saving a picture as a GIF will cause you to lose
definition.

> They are generally fairly low in overhead.

JPEG really has no more overhead than GIF, except that a heavily compressed
one might take a little longer to save and display. OTOH, a non-compresed
one should display faster, as it is basically a straight bitmap.

> They include a pallate of colors, and so are flexible.

Don\'t see why that makes it flexible, JPG\'s display whatever colour is in
the picture, assuming your display is of high enough bit depth.

> They are bitmapped, and so can be displayed with minimal processor cycles.

No more than JPEG. Remember, GIF is a compressed format too, and JPG is also
a bitmap format.

> I\'ve worked with

Then you have either a poor JPEG engine or poor machines.

The difference in display should not be noticeable on any reasonable
machine.

The most likely problem is that you are using a lower bit-depth display
driver than the JPEG, forcing the JPEG driver to dither the colours.

Also you are likley comparing different quality pictures, the default
setting for JPEG is much higher resolution and bit-depth than the default
for GIF, you\'d have to explicitly degrade the JPEG to get a fair comparison.

Well I\'m not talking about browsers, if all you\'re worried about is
browsers, it really doesn\'t matter which format you use, pictures used in
web pages are usually such low resolution who cares what format they\'re in.

Try another Grell series,  "Starslayer" for SF with guys in skin-tight

Another is "Warp", Chaos liked leotards, and he was mostly Black.

Yet another are the Don McGregor series, "Black Panther" "Killraven" and

Nope. But if you look for a book on OO programming in Delphi it should be
applicable.
My first commercial specially-commisoned OO program was written in Turbo
Pascal.way back in the late eighties.

It\'s biggest drawback is that OO is only an "add-on" to Turbo Pascal, and
several OO concepts are not enforced by the compiler, but it\'s a great
compiler when it comes to efficiency

Frankly, I don\'t use a browser to display high quality pictures, so no I
can\'t recomend one.

However, commonly available vector formats are the Corel Draw Format (.cdf),
the Windows Metafile Format (.wmf) and the AutoCad format. (.dxf ?)

There is also, for GIS work, things like GRASS

To be blunt, the only reason we have that problem is that people areen\'t
distributing things properly.
If they used the standard *nix ELF format, and the install standards from
Posix, this wouldn\'t be a problem. Unfortunately it\'s hard to reprimand
programmers who are working for nothing <grin>

Seeing as most Linux apps do use the PKG format for installation, it is
pretty standard.

No need for Linux specific standards, they should just follow existing  *nix
standards like Posix.

Actually, I thought that everybody got their local guru to instal stuff for

of people who buy the stuf and then it just sit\'s on their shelves gathering
dust because they can\'t install it.

Thing is, the sort of "standard" requireed for this sort of stuff already
exists, and is becoming more and more common in "industrial strength"
software. The standard is called CORBA, go have a read at www.omg.org
to see what a real solution to the problem is.

Even Microsoft, who still want to push their DCOM standard have been forced
to make their DCOM servers CORBA compliant after pressure from companies
much more powerful than they are (such as banks)

Combine this with platform independant languages such as Java, or similar,
and it\'s quite feasible that plug-in components are quite possible.

It might be a nice idea to use CORBA IDL to describe various Traveller
software packages such as Predict. That\'s a project I might look at when I\'m
bored in a hotel room some time.

Definitely not real, though just as definitely rumoured.

Basically, even if it was legal to attempt such a thing,  it would be
impossible to prove, seeing as programs exist that let you edit the strings
in a GIF such as the one that states which editor created it.
I often change this to read something like Unisys Sucks! just for the hell

It was created by a CompuServe working group including people like Michael
Abrash, and it\'s a "royalty free" format. It can;t be GPL, because it\'s not
source code, though there are several GPL implementations of PNG-capable
graphic programs.

All the programs that count support it. <grin>

And the W3C  ( the organizatio that controls HTML standards and such,  has

that want to claim HTML4.0 compatibility to support PNG.

Assuming you are using the CT Sup 7 Traders & Gunboats as
"the standard", then yes there are 2 squares to a DT.

"Since the square grid used for deck plans is 1.5m
[5 ft for the metric impaired or for GT], a ceiling height
of 3m [10 ft] means that two floor squares, extended floor to
ceiling equals four 1.5 m cubes or about 14 cubic meters
(1.5 x1.5 x4 = 13.5 cubic meters), or one ton. If a 100 ton 
ship was mapped as a one level square, it would have two
hundred grid squares within." - Traders & Gunboats p. 5.

Are you talking about the free trader, or the Far Trader?

The blueprints for the type A free trader in DGP\'s Starship
Operators Handbook have about 750 deck squares, so it is indeed
almost twice as large as it should be. I am not aware of 
another good source for Type A deck plans. 

The OP Judges Guild CT supplement Starships & Spacecraft had 
25 mm scale plans for a type A (they are a little _small_, 
having about 370 depicted squares) but it is long OP and 
Judges Guild   www.judgesguild.com    does not have it.
Perhaps someone, (after obtaining permission & with a 
scanner), could get you a copy of this one. Basically it is a 
cigar shaped 2 deck plan with the bridge & the crew
staterooms on the front of deck two and the passenger area 
of the front of deck one. The back of both decks is a 2
level (6m) high cargo area, fuel, & engine room.

The blueprints for the Empress Marava Class Far Trader in Sup 
7 are twice as big as they should be. To find better plans
of an A2 you want the TNE adventure The Gilded Lily which
has proper scale deckplans of an A2.

He may not, but I do, as I do freelance computer troubleshooting in the
largely computer illiterate neighorhood I live in. It has been my experience
that once people get the ability to move their mouse down pat, and some
inkling of what their system will run, they have no problem installing the
average piece of software for Windows.

Not the case \'round here, at all. While I\'ve seen people do some amazingly
bizarre things and heard them say some pretty whacky stuff, I\'ve never heard
anybody complain that the half-dozen clicks that it takes to install a
Win95/Win98 program is too difficult.

 One of DGPs more annoying screwups is that deckplan from Starship
Operators Manual, which perpetuates the monster Trader. The original
Empress Marava has the same problem.

 The Marava was correct in only ONE place that I\'m aware of: the TNE
adventure "Guilded Lily." The Far Trader has two incarnations that are
pretty correct. Unfortunately, both are MUCH harder to come by than
Guilded Lily, being CT products. The first (and oldest aside from Snapshot)
is the Judges Guild product "Starships and Spacecraft" which is a mostly
pedestrian set of deckplans for nearly all of the CT character-ownable
starships. The Type-A and Type-R are the standout winners in this set.
 The second version of the Type-A that is correct is the Alexandria
class from FASAs Adventure Class Ships Vol 2, designed by none other
than Traveller art saint Rob Caswell.

earlier mistake, I really don\'t like misinforming people.

LZW (Liv-Zempel-Welch) _is_ patented,  what I was confusing myself with is
generic LZ compression, which is not patented. In fact the _specific_ part
of the LZW algorithm that is patented is the use of  a "limited search
hashing procedure" for accessing the basic tag symbols built up during
compression

Therefore _any_ LZ-based compression algorithm that creates GIF compliant
files that does not use this "limited search hashing procedure" is _not_
covered by the patent. It\'s therefore quite easy to write a GIF producing
programme that does not infringe the patent, the problem is many writers
cheat and try to use the provided LZW libraries for their compression.

Here\'s a reference to someone who has written such a routine using a direct
tree with no searching, thus avoiding the patent (written in FORTRAN no less
! ) :

http://cfaku5.harvard.edu/lzw.html

Also, any decompression technique that does not use this "limited search
hashing procedure" is also not covered, and seeing as there are much faster
decompression methods, such as using static buckets, it\'s quite likely that
most viewer implementations do not infringe the patent.

When I said that PK-Zip used an LZW technique, I was wrong also,  it uses
LZH which from memory is a modified Liz-Zempel algortithm with Huffman
encoding, an amalgam of LZ and LH113

LHA (which someone mentioned ) was devised by Haruyasu Yoshizaki and is an
improved version of LH113c, both of which use Huffman coding, LHA uses
static Huffman coding for decompression thus acheiving faster decompressuion
times.

 As mentioned by several folks already, the easy fix is to
treat the grid on that plan as if it were a 1.0m grid instead
of a 1.5m grid, and apply the TNE deckplan standard of one 2.0m
square (or four 1.0m squares) per ton. The deckplan magically
becomes the right size.

There are likely many copies still in the supply chain, but _IBM_ will not
sell it to the public anymore.

At least that was their official position in June this year when I left. Of
course, you may find some OS/2 afficianado still working for IBM who\'ll find
a copy for you.

It\'s irrelevant whether they used Windows source, they still _implemented_
it by patching win.exe at run time.

It\'s the only possible way of using  the Windows executable under another
operating system, (except for running  a hardware level emulator)  because
certain vectors are set based on it\'s memory location on start-up,vectors to
do with handing  the context switch to supervisor mode, which must be
patched to allow OS/2\'s kernel  to retain comtrol of supervisor mode and
force the Windows kernel to run in real mode.

The only other alternative would have been to write (or buy ).a complete
Windows emulator from scratch, which they did not have the budget for.
If they\'d done it that way when they\'d started they\'d have been fine.

Warp 4 still could not run any version of Microsoft Word greater than Word
6.0.c, when I was using it at the beginning of the year, which means it was
stilll tied to the old Win 3.1.1 executable. It\'s never been able to run
pure win32 apps because of it\'s reliance on that executasble and it\'s means
of using it.

No, they are fact.. I worked for IBM until very recently and knew some of
the guys who worked on OS/2, including the guys from Global Services
Australia that were considering taking over development.

That Warp 4 has "it\'s own" win.exe is irrelevant, that is a licensed copy of
win.exe which means you do not have to install windows seperately, like you
used to have to with earlier versions of OS/2.

The main reason for this becoming standard was that you can no longer buy
Win 3.1.1 from Micrsoft.

I\'ve sorta assumed the Sector Dukes have pursuaivants  who handle the
registration, and some distinction in the rest of the achievement by
sector.... and it takes a minimum of 19 months to get a device
registered... approved by Sector, then off to domain, and finally Laurel.
allow 6 months from Sector to Domain, and 6 more from domain to Laurel...
then 6 to get the news of conflict back. I use the standard colors,
tincutres, metals, Furs/Vairs, plus a few extras, including Palladium (Pd)
(which tricks as pink), Grey (as a color). Very few of my players have
asked for any more detail about their Noble\'s devices other than "Is it
registered? Can I use it on buttons, etc?"

If they\'re anything like the SCA heralds I\'ve known (Myself included),
They\'ll try like the dickens to get things moved on promptly, but somehow,
they never get it ALL done in a timely manner....

A one eyed snake reared and looking straight out at the viewer in white

Considering how much "Feel" good heraldry adds to a fantasy game, it is
amazing how little thought is given it BY THE VERY SAME PLAYERS in
Traveller.

However, frankie, GIF\'s which are interlaced to load every XN th line, the
evern 1+XN th line, then every 2+XN th line... the standard for interlaced
gifs includes progressive encoding. Non-interlaced gifs don\'t behave this
way IME. (And i\'ve made a bunch).

Hunh? Bull Sh**! .GIF was developed by Compuserve for the express purpose
of downloadable graphics. CI$ then made their format available for BBSing.
.JPG was, at least in early implementations, primarily for scanned files.
Almost every scanning program I\'ve encountered either uses TIFF (.TIF) or
uncompressed .JPG.

Early browsers I\'ve used (To wit, NCSA Mosaic for the Mac, in early
versions) didn\'t support .JPG, but did support .GIF.

JPEG uses a full width system. I can, if my display supports it, use any
256 colors of the 32 bit pallate in a .GIF; for non-scanned/photographed
images, especially those created by direct pixelpopping, 256 colors will be
more than sufficient. 256 is one byte; the 32 bit wide is 3 bytes.

Additionally, most people I\'ve met don\'t go the whole 32bit route on their
screens; they use 24 bit graphics at best, simply due to the limits of
their Video ram.

the whole thread was based around sharing images ON THE WEB. If I\'m going
to put images on the Web, it becomes VITAL to know the stregths and
weaknesses of the various formats. And, for doing things like deckplans,
.gifs are generally going to maintain the crisp lines better.

When .RIP becomes available for the Mac I *WILL* migrate, even though it
won\'t be native to my browsers.... it is a superior method of handling
vector graphics on the web.

Err - there is one that people keep on mentioning but I can\'t 
remember the name, but it may be cheaper and easier to get hold of an 
old MacII or LC (which go for <£100 GBP these days). There\'s a place 
in Bury St Edmonds which sells them called Mad Macs.

I know that you can run it like that, but I was wondering if it was 
worth doing with a 200MHz 603e processor (about 5 times slower than 
the 2-300 MHz G3)? I\'d like to upgrade to G3 or G4 but at the moment 
it doesn\'t look likely to happen soon. I suspect the RAM upgrade to 
136Mb from 56Mb will come first...

Thanks for the tip.

EPS and DXF aren\'t bad either, although some PC interpretations of 
EPS are a little screwy. ISTR that Corel used to have this problem. 
DXF tends to fall apart with fonts, colours and 3D.

I use Executor from Ardi <http://www.ardi.com/> and it runs all Rob Prior\'s
software fine. The interface is a little clunky, but its no real problem to
work.

That\'s an interesting idea, so I just checked. The staterooms for the
passengers are, including the fresher, about 10 squares. A standard 54
kilolitre stateroom translates to 8 squares, but half of that is for
corridors and common areas, so that leaves 4 squares. 

Then I looked at the size of the air/raft depicted, and it looks correct
(about 6 squares).

So the stateroom size seems to prove you right, but the air/raft size
says otherwise.

From the MT rules:

Craft plans may have a scale of 1.5 meters per square. Optimum space
between decks is 3 meters. One floor square (1.5 meters by 1.5 meters by
3.0 meters) equals 6.75 kilolitres. Two floor squares, therefore, equal
13.5 kilolitres or one displacement ton.

So the 200 displacement ton free trader should have about 400 squares.

    'month' => '12',
    'body' => 'Those of you who have been on the TML for a while will remember that 
we\'ve discussed Peter F Hamilton\'s "Night\'s Dawn" Trilogy of SF 
novels on several occasions. The main link to Traveller is the 
technology utilised by the human confederation in the books. Ships 
use ZTT drives, effectively an instantaneous version of the jump 
drive which cannot jump in gravity wells (but unlike Traveller 
J-Drive it can jump in LaGrange points). The technology diverges from 
Traveller in the presence of biotechnology (organic grown starships 
called voidhawks), effective PSI via implant (affinity bonds) and 
nanionic implant technology which can boost performance and give 
links to computer nets. Antimatter is available but illegal, and 
there are hints at super weapons (such as the Alchemist) which are 
described as the plot proceeds. Technology and society are broken 
into two distinct groups - the Edenists (biotechnologists who use and 
develop the voidhawks and viable AI habitats) and Adamists (who 
either reject or minimise the use of biotech).

The whole plot line is very epic, and is very hard to describe 
without ruining the main twist described in the first novel \'The 
Reality Dysfunction\', and continued in the sequel \'The Neutronium 
Alchemist\'. You\'ll either love it or hate it. The novels are around 
1100 pages each, and I found the first two unputdownable.

Anyway, the final part of the sequence \'The Naked God\' was released 
just before Christmas in the UK, and thanks to a friend I have 
borrowed his hardback copy and spent three days over the break 
devouring it. I\'ll try and give a non-spoiler based review here:

\'The Naked God\' (TNG) starts immediately after the end of \'the 
Neutronium Alchemist\', and will be hard to follow if you haven\'t read 
the earlier volumes, especially as no primer or summary is given at 
the start. It continues to follow the main characters from the 
earlier novels - Joshua Calvert (owner/operator of the Adamist 
starship \'Lady MacBeth\'), Ione Saldana (Lord of Ruin, ruler of the 
habitat tranquilty, also duplicated into some biotech constructs), 
Louise Kavanagh (escapee from a planet threatened in the second 
book), and a number the enemy; Quinn Dexter, Al (from Chicago), Kiera 
etc.
 
There are a number of distinct threads to the plot, namely:

1) Calvert\'s search for a solution to the main plot issues, 
accompanied by the Voidhawk Oenone. They end up far beyond normal 
space.
2) Louise\'s attempt to warn Earth of the threat posed by Dexter, who 
has got there first.
3) The politics faced by Ione and others in the Confederation in 
dealing with the problem.
4) The operations to contain Al and liberate New California.
5) The land war to rescue Mortonridge from occupation, which includes 
use of \'harpoons\' (Kinetic Kill weapons).

The entire plot moves quite quickly, but I was starting to feel a bit 
jaded by the end - there are no real surprises left in the story, as 
it moves towards a conclusion. However, it\'s still quite gripping. 
The feeling at the end approaches that of the end of a fantasy quest; 
however, that\'s probably more related to the old Clarke quote on 
technology of a sufficiently high level being indistinguishable from 
magic. For a Traveller comparison, imagine if the players encounter a 
TL 30+ Grandfather to give an idea of the disparity in technology.

Easy plunder for the Traveller ref are the descriptions of the 
Tyrathca, Mosdva and Kiint races which could be slotted in on the 
borders of the Imperium. Additionally, the attitude of the high 
technology sentients could be used if playing a sufficiently high 
powered game, but is better done in Iain Banks\' \'Excession\'.

The ending is much as expected, and ties up the loose plot ends well; 
there are hooks which could build a sequel but I don\'t know if it 
needs one, nor if one could be achieved satisfactorily. Would I 
recommend it? Yes, especially if you enjoyed the first two novels. I 
will be buying it in paperback.

I don\'t have SOH, so I don\'t know if this is the one I\'m looking at. I
downloaded mine from one of the Traveller web sites. I annotated it
myself, though.

I can send it to anyone who\'s interested.

That\'s definitely not the one I have, so I\'d be interested in seeing it,
if anyone has it. The one I\'m using has three decks, with the passenger
area and air/raft on the top deck, the cargo bay on the middle and lower
decks, and a two-story engineering area.

Actually, yes I am surprised. I can see not publishing the results, though,

Can you give me some references?  My \'wonderful\' local library system is
extremely limited, and the local university keeps non-students out of their
library. I can get an inter-library loan, but only if I know the title and
author of the book...

How do they handle the ethics when they\'re experimenting with fertility
treatments?

I suspect that implantation and pregnancy would be bigger hurdles than
fertilization. There\'s a lot of chemical interaction between fetus and
mother, which means a lot of places for things to go wrong.

Good choice -- the Sams Teach Yourself ... in 21 Days series is generally

I don\'t think I would be terribly off the mark if I claimed that a

other than strictly cheesy mainstream fluff.  However, since we also
couldn\'t agree on what they are to save Strephon from assassination, I

Who admittedly do a much better job than MOST game editors.  I spent more
time with the book last night and I think it\'s OK -- there\'s more
diversity among the females than normal, there were a few nonwhite males,
and someone is drawing some really hot Aslan.  (Whom I never thought of as
looking THAT human facially!)

I like this attitude much better than someone giving me a lot of PC flack
about not being equally attracted to everyone (I quit the polyamory lists
because of that.)  You show me someone who is absolutely equally attracted
to everyone regardless of body type and / or coloration and I\'ll show you
someone who either:

1) Is completely attracted to people based on their MENTAL qualities,
something they may be LESS likely to be able to change than their physical
appearance (most of the people who derided me for not being terribly
attracted to the large hairy white males who dominate the polyamory
movement would never have deigned to date anyone with a normal "IQ");

or

2) Has no idea what they really want sexually and may never have really
woken up that way.

I am not opposed to art depicting ordinary people but even so I would
prefer it to be more diverse.  

However, art designed to arouse is a long standing tradition in space
opera and TRAVELLER is space opera-- it has interstellar Empires,
political intrigue on a galactic scale, and all the other trappings of
same.  Therefore, I would like the art designed to arouse to be there too,
and I would like it to depict a wider range of tastes.  Which would
certainly leave room for those who admire BBMs, bears and other types that
don\'t particularly do much for me-- including the "Nordic Gods" I wouldn\'t
look twice at, just not so many of them.  I\'ve often said that if all
people freely acknowledged what turns them on instead of pretending not to
have preferences there would be a greater acceptance of all people and all
preferences.  And we could get over pretending that we are all Vulcans who
choose our mates by logic.  Sheesh, I had someone try to tell me once that
if you\'re not bisexual you are engaging in gender discrimination!

"If time passes, everything turns into beauty
If the rains stop, tears clean the scars of memory away
Everything starts wearing fresh colors
Every sound begins playing a heartfelt melody
Jealousy embellishes a page of the epic
Desire is embraced in a dream..."              -- X-JAPAN
