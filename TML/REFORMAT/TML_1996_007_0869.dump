   I estimated the Falcon to be about 100 tons.  It is a cargo ship, but
there are a few things to remember.  First, interstellar/interplanetary
travel takes a hell of a lot less fuel in the Star Wars universe, so when you
take into account the percentage of a 200 ton far trader that is used for
fuel storage, there isn\'t as much of a difference.  Second, interstellar
travel takes less time in the Star Wars universe, so small cargo ships can be
smaller (they can make more runs in the same amount of time) than in the
Traveller universe.  Third, the Falcon was designed for the "small package
trade" (aka smuggling)--how many ships do you know that have secret cargo
bays that shield life signs, and have the ability to dump cargo in space at a
moment\'s notice?  Finally, the Falcon has been extensive modified--it looks
like a freighter, but can out perform most fighter craft.   

   It is possible the Falcon originally had the ability to attach large cargo
modules to its exterior to increase its cargo capacity (which would explain
the oversized engines), a capability that has since been sacrificed in favor
of higher performance for those *quick* getaways.

I ran a Traveller: the New Era in the Solomani Rim (I collapsed the sector personally) 
and the world of Altair is a large star asteroid belt (type A star)
I noticed an unusual number of asteroid belts with type A stars are Red Zones
So, I placed the Mi-Go there. The Mi-Go are actually a remnant of the Ancients War, 
they are a bio-weapon. They do not invade a la Aliens, but rather watch and learn, then 
devise the best method for overcoming a foe. They have access to some TL 18(!) stuff 
but their average tech is around 11. They are cunning but not very innovative. The 
danger to the PCs fledgling mini-empire (basically Sol subsector) was them ,  Virus 
(homeworld at Cymbeline) and a resurgent Vegan Region who have no desire to fight the 
Solomani again
All the Cthulhu stuff, like artifacts, books and such, are TL 18-20
The books are actually nanotech infested, you learn by touching the book and getting 
infected by the resulting nanneez (thanks to DGP and AI for the inspiration) Usually the 
book modifies the target and gives them a sort of pseudo-psionics
Humans usually are not the ones the nanneez were designed for, and generally results in 
skewed chemical imbalances in the mind (drives you insane)

Two suggestions;=20

Depeche Mode, Violator or Music for the Masses
=09Heavy on the electronics and with a deep percussive beat, these
are a bit on the spooky side and pretty "futuristic" in style.  Some call
it "industrial pop".

Cibo Matto, (self named album)=20
=09This stuff is kinda bizarre techno-pop japanese music (they sing
in English).  Wierd percussion, bizarre lyrics ("I...weigh...three hundred

A "Starship Operator\'s Manual" reprint should probably wait until we

I simply don\'t see the advantage to this. F\'r\'example, I\'m not on XBoat,
and I\'d probably resist joining another mailing list "just because". I\'m on
enough of them already. I\'m also interested in both history/stories/ideas
and rules as well as news from IG and things like that.

\'Sides which, any attempt to split two halves of a discussion that *go
together anyways* is probably doomed to fail. It\'s why Usenet is such a
morass of crossposts in places; poorly thought-out splits of newsgroup
topics or compromise solutions that simply encourage crossposting.

And you would *still* get all the messages anyways... wouldn\'t you?

Subject: Re: Traveller-digest V1996 #526

There is no way that we can detail 20,000 star systems. And I think that 
just leaving the UWPs to the computer provides information without 
substance. The concept I have is that we WILL detail several areas (the 
places mentioned in the Outline). By leaving large expanses blank 
(specifically within the territory of the upcoming Imperium) we make it 
possible for your adventurers to particpate in defining the teritory. >>

What if they don\'t *want* to \'participate in defining the territory\'? If 
I go to France, I don\'t want to have to create my own maps as I go 
along, I just want to go into a bookshop and pick one off the shelf.

We\'re not asking for full details on every world (anyway, I thought the 
3I was only 11,000 systems?) - in most cases, just a UWP will do. And I 
*like* random, computer-generated stats - often, they\'ll produce results 
that you\'d throw out if you were doing it by hand. These weird results 
make you go, \'hey, how the hell did *that* happen?\', and you have to 
figure out an interesting reason.

<< And as we define some specific worlds (like Spires), you get to 
decide where they are placed within a sector or group of sectors. >>

Huh? You mean you\'re going to write up worlds, but let the ref decide 
where to put them? BAD IDEA.

My .02cr:

Specific comments to Steinar...  For moody (Gothic) and disturbing music
from my more general list of Background Music (which follows) I\'d recommend
Bach - Toccata and Fugue in D minor, Carmina Burana - Carl Orff (see below
for more details), The "Black Rain Suite" from the soundtrack for Black
Rain, and Emerson, Lake & Powell - Emerson, Lake & Powell...

All of the previous suggestions are excellent.  I\'d have to add that
virtually _any_ Andreas Vollenweider\'s works would be suitable for use as
background music.

- ----<Here is my general background music list:>----

Classical:

Bach - Toccata and Fugue in D minor
Carmina Burana - Carl Orff (Excellent for Gothic atmospheres, battle
scenes, etc.) Featured towards the end of the movie "Excalibur".
(LaserLight Digital # 14020 is an excellent version of this and well priced)

New Age-ish:

Mars Lasar - Eleventh Hour (Excellent battle/chase music)
Robert Miles - Dreamland (Excelent chase music)
Tour de France - John Tesh (There are others by Tesh but most are over played)

Heavy Synthesized Pop originals:

The Crazy World of Arthur Brown - The Crazy World of Arthur Brown
ELO - Time
Emerson, Lake & Powell - Emerson, Lake & Powell (A couple of good
instrumentals here including a synthed version of "Mars, the Bringer of
War", and the pop hit "Touch and Go")
War of the Worlds - Jeff Wayne\'s Musical Version of...  (Heavy on Vocals
but what a great album! - Ulla!)

Electric Guitar "Shredder\'s"

Joe Satriani - Surfing with the Alien, The Extremist
Gary Hoey - Animal Instinct, Music from the movie "Endless Summer II"
Marc Bonilla - American Matador, EE Ticket
Dick Dale (with and without his Del-Tones) - Best of, Tribal Thunder,
Unknown Territory

Synth-Updated Classical & Pop:

Apollo 100 - Apollo 100 (LaserLight Digital 15174)
Switched on Bach, Switched on Bach 2000, Switched on Brandenburgs Volumes 1
and 2 - W. Carlos

Soundtracks:

The Music of Cosmos - Various Artists
Blade Runner - Various Artists from the movie "Blade Runner"
Black Rain - Various Artists from the movie "Black Rain", Especally the
"Black Rain Suite"
Heavy Metal - Various Artists from the movie "Heavy Metal"
Speed - From the movie "Speed" (Also excellent for chases)
T1 & T2 - From the movies "Terminator and Terminator 2"
Mission Impossible - Various Artists From the movie "Mission Impossible"
The Best of James Bond 30th anniversary (Many of the title tracks are
obvious but On Her Majesty\'s Secret Service is excellent).

A couple of singles that are worth consideration but I\'m not sure they are
worth a whole album (all have vocals...):

Voices - Russ Ballard
Children of the Sun - Billy Thorpe
After the Goldrush - Prelude <- Note: not Neil Young\'s version!
Ride Like The Wind - Saxon
Why Me? - Planet P Project

I would also highly recommend Russ Freeman & the Rippington\'s "Brave New
World" album.  This group is sort of a jazz/new age group that puts out
some very entertaining and unusual/exotic music that is quite suitable for
Trav.  Some vocals but mostly instrumentals.  Their other works are also
quite good.  There is a fair chance that you may have heard _some_ of this
groups work, in that many local Cable TV channels will play Rippington\'s as
background music on "The Weather Channel" during the local forecast
sections.

I\'d also recommend considering various forms of "World Music"...  I was in
a Discovery Channel Store recently and they were playing some exotic music
that featured a Didgeridoo (Australian aborigine Instrument) with more
modern instruments.  I picked up the CD (Dr. Didg - Out of the woods) and
while after a while one tires of the Didgeridoo it\'s quite enjoyable.
Track 5 is excellent!

One can use foreign/exotic music to imply different "atmosphere" of
inhabitants actions, cultures, etc.  Perhaps Scandinavian music for one
world, Caribbean for the next, Chinese or Japanese for the next, Arabic for
the next, and so on...  Who knows, maybe the Sword World\'s are goofy about
Bagpipes (they probably are!).

As always my suggestions should be taken with a grain (block) of salt.  My
tastes are eclectic and eccentric.  If you can find a store that allows you
to preview a CD before buying it, patronize it!

- ----<End of general background music list:>----

Enjoy,

Chuck

   Wrong.  Actually the correct interpretation goes something like this:  all
original work belongs to its creator, unless the creator gives up the rights
to it, in which case the rights (and thus the work) belong to the owner of
the rights.

   That is why if Imperium Games publishes your adventure in JTAS, they must
purchase it from you first, even though it is based upon Marc Miller\'s
copyrighted work.  If IG decided to go the route that Traveller Chronicle
went, the rights to the material are temporarily surrendered for the purposes
for publication.  After that, the copyright reverts back to the author. 

   If IG told you differently, they need to consult a copyright attorney.

>To get around this, you have to get a Letter of Permission from FFE, or 
>pay for a License.  

   This is true in cases where you are going to be using someone else\'s
copyrighted material on an ongoing basis, such as for a Web site, for a
magazine.

>Why?  Without enforcing those rules, FFE could LOSE it\'s Trademark and 
>Copyrights!  That\'s the way the law works.

   The law states that any *original* material you produce belongs to *you*
and that it is up to *you* to enforce the copyright.  THere have been cases
where the national government of a given country has helped copyright holders
in enforcing copyrights (such as the U.S. government\'s intervention on behalf
of software makers with the PRC regarding software piracy, but the government
(in the U.S. at least) is under no obligation to do so.

   Xerox won this case by the way, even though the word "xerox" has actually
come into common usage.

   Actually it depends.  If the people using the Traveller name did so only
with permission, and then you did your bit without permission, he could still
sue you.

   Neither IG or FFE/Marc Miller has the right to claim any original work by
someone else, even if it is based on their copyrighted material, as their
own.  They *could* sue someone for using copyrighted material without
permission, but that is the extent to wish they can pursue it.

>Hope this clears it up.

   I\'m afraid you may have instead created a firestorm.  Welcome to the wide,
wide world of Public Relations.  You may want to invest in a fireproof suit
in the near future....

   Not exactly.  Once again, Marc Miller retains the rights to the Traveller
name and any associated copyrighted material, *but* as stated previously, any
*original* work still belongs to the author, not to Marc Miller/FFE.  

   Of course to *publish* any work based on MM\'s copyrighted material
requires at least a letter of permission, something that this mail list has.

        Seriously, while IG I\'m sure has no desire to make any of the fans
angry, they have to protect their copyrights. That is an unfortunate fact of
legal life. The disclaimer is a way to do that. While it TECHNICALLY means
that FFE owns anything we write that uses Traveller as it\'s basis (which is
fine with me, by the way), I\'m sure they would not publish something without
at least giving credit. I don\'t write the stuff I\'ve posted for money. If IG
likes my work and wants to ask me for something that they will pay me for,
that would be great, but that\'s not what I write the things I write for.
        If you really are concerned about making money from your Traveller
related materials, don\'t post them! IG isn\'t responsible for unsolicited
material. I thought (and I HOPE) that this forum and associated Web pages
are for the FREE discussion of Traveller and related subjects.

How about \'duty\' uniforms of cloth armor grade coveralls, with lots of

you get from the Core sector, the less formal you get.

There would be some \'offical\' dress uniform for use for \'offical\' functions.
Nothing the class of the formal Navy uniforms though.

[ Discussion concerning jobs, cost of living/real estate, immigration
  laws, and activities/culture ... ]

I\'ve often assumed that the general population on densely populated but
less-hospitable worlds are poor. They likely cannot afford to move away
(at least not without leaving many family members behind), and if they
did go to a neighboring "richer" system would be starting out destitute
and perhaps fighting prejudices and worse. These people would probably
have shorter lifespans, which interestingly results in faster population
growth (as discussed during the Vilani/Solomani population thread).

Of course, each world is unique--if the planet has an abundance of some
valuable commodity (e.g., lanthanum), then perhaps everyone is very rich
but building their fortunes so they can retire early. :-)

Hi, Mark, I printed out your post a while back and just now got around to 
looking at it.  I like it very much!  Very little of the bandwidth on TML 
actually has any useful stuff.  Thanks for the good stuff.  

Glad to contribute when I can. I\'ve been busy for a few days so I have
a lot of mail to read.

Your example #3 is ripe for a bolshevik revolution!  Bill Labor cannot afford 
to live unless the he can get somebody to supplement his income

This is purposefully done. There is such a range of economic
distribution that I wanted to have the model reflect some small
bit of that range. It would be up to the referee to say what percentage of the population is at what social level and I, personally, would
never try to universalize T4 specific stuff like subsistence food
and lodging. Each of my planetary systems is hand-crafted.

Also, since you seem to enjoy being creative with obscure charts hidden away here and
there, take a peek in _Striker Rule Book 2, Advanced Rules_ on page 38 under the heading
_Military Spending_.  I dunno if this was ever reprinted in any other materials.

I do love all those "hidden" resources. I am in the process of
transcribing all of the ones I use into "Mark Ayers\' Traveller":)

I would include some information about the Vilani Empire, the Rule of Man, and 
the position/history of Sylea in both of these organizations.  We know Sylea at 
some point was the capital of the Rule of Man; was it an important region in 
the Vilani Empire?  Was it even settled.  When the Rule of Man finally 
collapsed, was it because of some sort of disaster in Sylea?  A 
barbarian/warlord invasion?  Economic collapse?  What is different about Sylea 
now that allows it to form an empire, when it failed to maintain even a viale 
chunk of the Rule of Man?

>    2. Sylea2s Rise
>        a. Economic Pressures
>        b. 

I think b. would be societal pressures.  A number of writers have pointed out 
that people do not build empires with the goal of a higher standard of living 
(though that may be the motivating factor of the ruling group).  Some sort of 
societal pressure would be required to get the level of fanaticism necessary to 
build an empire.  In the past, this has been manifested as religion (The 
Crusades), shortage of natural resources (The Viking Expansion) or a mixture of 
these elements overlaid with patriotism (Manifest Destiny, The British Empire).

Why is the expansion seemingly focussed away from Terra.  The Spinward Marches 
starts getting attention in the early 60s Imperial (per canon that may no 
longer be valid), but that region is much further away from Sylea than Terra, 
and according to that same canon Terra is not contacted and absorbed until 
several hundred years later.  Also, it seems likely that there will be  some 
sizable mini-empires out there; some may even be larger than Sylea/Third 
Imperium (but lower tech).  These would seem to be the most likely sources of 
"real" wars, as opposed to gunboat diplomacy raids, police actions and 
brushfire wars.

I realize this can be a touchy subject in RPGs, but how about some religious 
organizations?  They could be descended from familiar 1990s ones, or totally 
new and made up.

Also, with the "neo-feudalism" bent of the Third Imperium, how about some 
knightly orders (I would see these more like "Gentleman\'s Clubs" of 1880s 
England rather than some mindless Warhammer Fighting Order rubbish).

A lot of people have been suggesting that Frank here should be somebody famous 
of the son of a famous man; I would be much more interested in seeing him as a 
typical adventurer of Solomani origin.  His umpty-great grandfather was a 
Commander in the Terran Confederation Navy who wound up becoming Assistant 
Cheif Administrator to a Sector.  Over the years, this became a minor noble 
position (a Barony, perhaps) which did not wear well through the Long Night.  
Frank is the third child of a fairly minor noble house, whith a great deal of 
pride in his family and their accomplishments, but little material wealth to 
show for this great history.   His inheritance was enough to get him half 
ownership of a Far Trader, but beyond that and a fairly small yearly stipend (
20,000 Cr) he is on his own.  What I would like to see is how he and his family 
deal with the universe around them, how the universe has shaped him and his 
family into what they are today, and what Frank\'s goals and outlook are.
  
All in all, this sounds really cool.  I\'m am quite hyped about this, and am 
very anxious to see you final result.

*Critical* reality check: see how big the "bubble dome" of the cockpit

27 meters seems kinda small.

Sounds like reality to me. *Standard* instructions to people in areas
where they might encounter bears or cougars is to make *lots* of noise,
so that you don\'t startle them. 

Remember, when startled *prey* flees. *Predators* attack. This is the
way it works in real life!

With J1 drives, getting there would be a *major* undertaking. How many
ships are equipped to make *4* jumps? I say four, because until you\'ve
been there, you don\'t know if you can refuel there.

So instead you need to establish (and be able to find again!) a fuel
dump halfway. That only takes a ship that can make *two* jumps and
carry some cargo (fuel bladders or the like).

Now it\'s true that there may be old records. But they are only adequate
for size, type and number of planets. Atmosphere and hydro are things
that *can* be affected by the "fall of civilization" and similar
events, even at thse tech levels.

Population, law level, gov type, tech level are all things that *will*
have changed over the centuries.

Where are you (as a private citizen) going to get time on a radio
telescope? They\'ll be rather busy with other tasks. And radio signals
detectable at several parsecs tend to be a limited lifetime phenomena.
Give us another 50 years and we are likely to be very quiet, simply
because fiber optics and the link work so much better for most uses,
and the remaining "broadcast" type applications are lower power.

Also, survivors of a "collapse" may leave behind records that make
people wary about announcing their presence to the universe.

Don\'t count on it. Not if J2 is uncommon. Try finding someone who\'s
been to Palmyra atoll. That\'s difficult. Try finding someone whose been
to other parts of the Line Islands. That\'s *really* hard. There\'s
nothing there worth the trouble, and they are about as far off the
"trade lanes" as you can get. I had to dig *hard* to find data about
them. Yet they used to be a stop on the Pan Am "China Clipper" route.
That\'s why I could get info on Palmyra. That\'s where the airstrip was.
The rest of the chain is just a couple of maps.

No, it\'s possible that they are low tech, and not worth trading with.
Or they are paranoid/antisocial and high enough tech to nail anybody
who disturbs them.

Congratulations. You\'ve re-invented the "bombardment ships" used in the
Pacific during WWII. They were older carriers that couldn\'t handle the
modern aircarft. So they *covered* the flight deck with row after row
of "2lb" rockets. They could fire individual rows, or ripple-fire them.
They took out *everything* on the beach.

Heck, consider what happens if put *lots* of projectile weapons of some
sort on the hull. Sure, they take forever to get anywhere. On the other
hand, who needs sand if you have a couple hundred .50 cal machineguns
firing at an approaching missile? :-)

And to be silly, just how many shots *does* an 18" naval rifle get in a
30 minute turn?

Please note that there are *lots* of things discovered that get into
widespread use *before* the theory is developed. Superconductor theory
is *still* full of large holes. And it was just about non-existent
until 15-20 years ago, even though superconductors had been in use for
at least 20 years before that.

But the most likely problem is in the jump calcs. Given that you *can*
make micro-jumps *and* jumps of a parsec, there has to be something
that varies in a rather non-linear way.

One parsec is more than 200,000 AU. So the range varies over a
200,000:1 (or more). That\'s kinda extreme. I rather suspect that the
formulas that make it practical to calculate a microjump aren\'t at
*all* practical for a one parsec jump. And vice versa.

This is frequently the case in math (and phsyical effects described by
said math). The relationships may be straightforward, just next to
impossible to calculate properly. But there care often "shortcuts" that
give good results over a limited range of values. These are more easily
found by a sort of "trial and error" than by outright calculation.

Example, there *is* a general solution to the three-body problem (ie
how will three bodies of arbtrary mass, velocity and position move
under their mutual gravitational influence). Only trouble is, it
involves a converging series that converges *slowly*. So you have to
run thru the calcs a few million times for just the *first* digit of
the answer...

But there are several "special case" solutions. Like the Lagrange
points, in a system of a large body, a second body much smaller, and a
third body of so little mass it can be ignored. That gives you the L4 &
L5 "trojan points", the L1, L2, & L3 "sort of" stable points, etc.

So with the jump drive, theory may let you calcculate things exactlym
if you have a few hundred years of computer time. But tests made after
crude calculations let you get data that makes for easier calculations,
you just don\'t know *where* your approximation will break down.

Not unless you put "FarFuture Enterprises" after the "Copyright 1996".

The usual intent of a notice like this is twofold. By acknowledging the
trademark, you help them protect it. The copyright notice (with *your*
name) just establishes that it\'s a copyrighted work, and that folks
need permission to re-publish it, *especially* if they are going to
*alter* it. That helps protect Far Future\'s rights also, because it
keeps people from thinking that they can lift details out for their own
use (if it wasn\'t copyrighted, they could!)

BTW, you either use "copyright <year>", "<copyright symbol> <year>" or
"copyright <copyright symbol> <year>" with the copyright owner\'s name
following. The third form is considered rather silly. The copyright
symbol *must* be a complete circle around the c to be legally valid. So
"(c)" is a waste of time.

So would you please check and see whether Far Future is requiring that
there simply be a copyright notice, or that the copyright actually be
assigned to them.

I\'m willing to bet it\'s the former, not the latter.

	If I look at the trade charts a pleasant planet is called
	rich :

	if ((atmos ~ "[68]") && (poplvl ~ "[678]") && (govlvl ~ "[4-9]")) {
		trade = trade "Ri "
		income *= 1.6

	while a unpleasnt planet called industial :

		trade = trade "In "
		income *= 1.4
		}

	of cause there is no pleasant industrial planet, they all have

I have always felt the reason was something along the lines of "well, we have inundated 
all available markets, anyone know of any new ones?"
Sylea had expanded as much as it could using loose trading alliances. PLus, their people 
were losing on copyrights. 
"I have an idea, let\'s go out and offer trade and a better standard of life, and a healthy 
profit for all, but in oreder to do that we need rules. And seeing as we are the best at this, 
we get to make the rules."
Intially, as the empire expands there would be immense profits from new markets for 
both sides. Then things start to settle, and the big players (the already multi-world Sylean 
corporations) begin to get into the market. Things stabilize and centralize. By this point 
everyone is interdependent, and the possibility of war drops (see Europe, post WWII)

Thanks for the good words, Trent.  I am very interested in coming up with a good task 
fix for the T4 system, and I am sure, that between all of us here on the TML, we\'ll be 
able to fix this thing.

Oh, sorry about that.  I was referring to my printed sheet entitled "Trent\'s Task 
System" that had the 1-2-3-4...progression dice system, so, naturally, I thought it was 
your idea.  It gets so confusing on the TML when deciding who to give credit to since we 
all take each other\'s ideas and build upon them.

Maybe we should use the vilani system where the original inventor of a piece of 
technology retains all rights to the item in question even if someone else builds upon 
it...no, just kidding--that\'s un-American.

I\'ve got to differ with you here Trent.  The 3D for the difficult difficulty category is 
what I was referring to.  If you use the T4 target number calculation by adding skill 
plus attribrute, you do get some low probabilities that are unrealistic and too harsh to 
play with.

For example, Dex 5 and Handguns-1:  Target number is 6.   Skill level-1 is, of course, 
the minimum training and experience that a person can get, but a Dex of 5 isn\'t that 
bad.  Difficulty of Difficult under your system only gives a 9% chance of success.  
Compare this to 17.6% under the 2.5 dice T4 system and MT\'s 27.7%.  Your system is 3 
times harder than MT and twice as hard as that proposed in T4.

Since the majority of a character\'s skills are either 1 or 2, and the average stat is 7, 
I have found the T4 difficulty system--with it\'s half die--a necessary evil.  After 
looking at the probabilities and the target numbers, I can see why IG decided to go with 
them in the first place.  They give us a flatter curve--giving the majority of a 
character\'s abilities a chance to succeed.  Under your system, there will be to many 
failures--making the game unfun for everyone involved.

I have to disagree with you again.  I cannot see any evidence that skill levels are 
weighted any less than in CT.  Skill levels still max out at around 5-7, or so.  If you 
look at the medical skill in the T4 main book, you will see that it describes the 
various levels of medical skill just as it was done in CT and MT.  And, skills still 
improve the die throw by the same amount (granted the system has been changed each time, 
so this may not be a viable comparison).

True, a character has more skills in T4, but I think that was a sorely needed change--I 
think CT characters were too weak when generated under the 4 year method included in 
Book 1.  Characters generated with the Book 4-7 yearly method produced better, more 
rounded characters with a good amount of skills to start the game with.  I think the 
upgrading of skill awards (from 1 skill for every 4 years to 1 skill per year) through 
character generation in T4 is an attempt to make the 4 year method produce characters 
comparable to characters generated with the 1 year method.  I\'ve compared characters 
generated under both systems, and they are very close.  I wouldn\'t be surprised (in 
fact, I\'m hoping) that future T4 supplements will use the 1 year method again.  I really 
liked the detail in put into character generation.

Anyway, Trent.  Take a look at what I\'ve posted on the new task fix and let me know what 
you think.  I believe that I\'ve tweaked the T4 system--without over tweaking it--enough 
to provide a good fix that we can all use easily.

I\'ll see you on that thread,

Kenneth.

And then again these records are probably centuries out of date
Let us use a hypothetical Terran example, you are attempting to recontact the Aztecs after 
500 years. According to records they have a total population of around 20 million, a 
clean capital city of half a million people, a theocratic government and are at stone age 
tech level. (UPP 6DB-0) You show up today and there are almost one hundred million 
people,  the capital alone has around 18 million people, the government is a sort of 
democracy and a modern (or thereabouts) society (UPP 797-7)
Or worse, you go to visit the capital of the Roman Empire!

(apologies if I send the attachment back %$&*#@ mailer)

This has *always* been the case with the smaller Traveller starships.  I
can remember my incredulity when I discovered, after picking up the CT
book *Merchant Prince* that a standard ship mortgage could *only* be paid
off through speculative buying.

To top this idea off, I think the published materials underestimate the
day to day costs of running a starship.  The following expenses are not
usually included as I recall (disclaimer: all published materials are at
home);

Food and drink for passengers and crew
Convoy Escort Fees
Tariffs, Duties, Taxes, and other government fees (avoided when smuggling)
Brokerage fees
Delivery charges
Loading/unloading charges (or, perhaps, heavy equipment rental)
Furniture, curtains, linens, little bars of soap, complimentary towels,
etc etc for passenger and crew staterooms
Plates, silverware, condiments, finger bowls, napkins, dishwashing liquid,
plumbing fixtures (where do they keep the drinking water?), all the stuff
found in kitchens and dining rooms
Oxygen, Nitrogen, Other chemicals for air or waste processing, Other
consumables besides the fuel itself, hookups while docked, septic tank
pumping, waste removal.
Insurance, Delivery bonds, Lawyers\' fees, registration fees, inspection
fees, bank fees, ATM fees, etc. 

There\'s quite a bit to this starship economics thing that doesn\'t seem to
show up.

On the other hand, I thinkthat a huge profit should be possible taking
high demand materials to the right worlds.  More than is represented in
most rules systems I have seen.  

On the other other hand (I\'m a hiver, did\'nt I tell you?) this kind of
stuff can get in the way of Role Playing.

On the other other other hand (I\'ve still got two to go after this) I have
used these types of methods to create the incentive for money making in
the past (especially when the ship in question gets impounded for
non-payment of Fee X).

I may have a need for this detail in the near future, if I do something
I\'ll try to post it.

Uh...I guess it\'s been too long since I revisited my assumptions.  I
switched to something very much like this *way* back in CT days.  It hasn\'t
occurred to me to even *look* at the way the books say to handle this.

Phil, one thing you haven\'t noted is that in many games there will be
several players with 1 or more Ship benefits.  This came up in the very
first game of Traveller I ran in \'77.  I had two players with a +1Merchant
and a third with a +2Scout, and I *obviously* didn\'t want to have 3 ships
running around.  <g> So I made a command decision on the spot, and I\'ve
stuck with it for the last..gee it\'s almost 20 years!

Special Mustering Out Benefit rules:

Merchant Benefit - 6MCR banked toward the purchace/outfitting of a
                   ship.
                   
Scout Benefit    - 3MCR banked toward the purchace/outfitting of a
                   ship, OR the use of a 100 ton Scout/Courier.

TAS Benefit      - TAS membership OR 1MCR banked toward the
                   purchace/outfitting of a ship.
                   
(The banked credit can *only* be spent on the purchase/outfitting of a
ship.  Optionally, vary the amount a couple of million either way depending
on the kind of ship you want the players to end up with.)

After all the players in the group have mustered out they can pool their
banked credit and buy into any kind of ship they want..or can find.  The
players have to roleplay finding a ship, getting a loan for the remainder
of the ship\'s worth, and outfitting/upgrading the ship.

The players can look for an NPC ship owner (TAS, bars, classified ads, or
contacts) that might offer to take on the PC\'s as partners in exchange for
their banked millions.  They can deal with a
shipyard for the purchase or a new or refitted ship.  They can also deal
with "Shady Sid\'s Ships"..ie a Ship broker <g>..to find a "deal" on an
older ship.  There have been a couple of times when the PCs were *really*
lucky and ended up owning a ship free and clear.

As for how they got all that money...I let *them* figure it out and tell
me, if they have to know, but usually they just go with the flow.  

About used ships...  Most of the time the players will buy an *old* ship..a
"fix\'er upper"..from a ship broker or an independent
shipyard.  I\'ve also had the players "salvage/recover" a lost ship, to
which they are granted title for all or most of the purchase price.  The
players never get *new* ships..too expensive, or just not available, and
they know the used ships they end up with will have problems that end up
costing them their credits, they know me! <g>

Oh yes, Ship prices!  I use a 100 year lifetime model for the ships and 50
years for most of their equipment, and depreciate everything straight line
(1%/year for the ship and 2%/year for equipment).  I *know* that\'s not
especially realistic, but it\'s easy.  If you want more realism, use the
"rule of 78\'s" as your depreciation model to drop the worth of ships on a
more realistic curve.

I\'ve found that this technique will get a group into a situation where they
can at least break even.  It\'s important not to make it *too* easy on them,
but their should be valid ecomonic reasons for them to want to be ship
owners, to haul freight,  and transport passengers.  <g> 

Oh, and in my games the *fixed* cargo/passage rates apply only to the
Established Trade Routes where the governments (Imperium, Federation,
local) provide some level of protection and service for commercial
shipping.  Everywhere else, the prices will be higher to reflect the
increased danger and costs of operation.

Discussion?

Oops again, this wasn\'t (AFAIR) stated explicitly in any of the previous
iterations of Traveller! It *does* make things potentially a lot worse,
but all the figures I used were worked out on the basis of single
occupancy anyway. It just reduces the utility of double occupancy!

Erm, isn\'t that 2000 Cr *per fortnight* ... or 1000 credits per week per
crewmember?

I really think that we *have* to assume that the comment about Life
Support costs being *double* for two occupying the one statement is
*wrong* if there is to be any hope at all of making the starship economics
system work. At worst I would suggest that it should be no more than +50%
(or +1000 Cr per fortnight, 500 Cr per week).

Then we have to assume (I feel) that whatever Life Support actually
represents *cannot* be included in operating costs for crew quarters,
assume that it is, in fact, part of their salary package (like "room &
board"). Otherwise it opens a whole can of worms!

Actually, the reason I was doing the "research" was because I was writing
down some thoughts on exactly what sort of layout and facilities you could
expect in a standard Cabin when in use for High or Middle Passage ... and
I have some ideas of layout as a result. Suffice it to say that, if you
assume foldaway beds (like those in Pullman cabins on RRs), then there\'s
plenty of room for two!

(no weapons, no refining), all cargo and no passenger capacity - leaves
757 tons of space for cargo, and the damn thing *still* can\'t run at less
than 72% and even "break even" at 1000 Cr per ton. To run and break even
at 60% capacity, it has to charge 1210 Cr per ton of cargo.

There *is* however, an elegant solution to the problem that doesn\'t
require major tinkering ... it involves a modification to the Starship
acquisition procedure that most PCs will follow ... that is, getting it as
a roll on the Benefit table.

Now, since the minimum time it takes to get such a result (a roll of 7,
which requires the +1 only available with an O5 rank or greater) is ten
years, it appears *on the face of it* reasonable to make the assumption
that Traveller has always made that the ship the character has is 10 years
old and was bought new as, as it states, financing is difficult to get for
older ships.

It is *possible* (tho unlikely) to roll the same benefit *three times* and
get what we have always been told is a 30 year old ship ... all at a
minimum age of 38!!!

OK. Do *you* know any bank in creation that will lend an 8 year old 32 MCr
(around 64 million US$ if previous hints are correct) on no collateral
other than the ship he buys with it? *I*, for one, don\'t ... but if *you*
do, lemme know where! I have this great little bizness proposition for
them!

If you delink the roll on the table and the age of the ship you get a
better possible outcome. 

Consider this. The biggest component in running a Starship is the Loan
Repayment. This is 1/240th of the value each month for 480 months (40
years). This means that a 38 year old Captain can have a 30 year old ship
and *still* be paying 1/240th of the value of it - even tho we\'re told
financing a second hand vessel is difficult - as if *he* bought it 30
years before, at age 8. Obviously not on. Sorry, won\'t wash.

So, what I suggest is this. Each time a ship is rolled, it indicates that
*somehow* the new owner has managed to acquire 1/4 (around 8 MCr) worth of
*equity* in a *new* version of said ship ... and that Repayments are based
on the *remainder*.

So, a Free Trader @ 30.75 MCr gained once would actually represent a
*loan* of only 23.0625 MCr ... and monthly repayments of only 96094 Cr
rather than 128125 Cr if the whole price was financed. This reduces the
monthly operational costs to 154094 Cr, rounding to around 170,000 Cr
(allowing a buffer for yearly maintenance and unforseen problems), or
30000 Cr less than it would otherwise cost in my previous calculations.

So, with 120 usable tons on the stock FT model the cost per commercially
usable ton is now 1417 Cr.

On a line item basis, this translates to -

1 High Passage Cabin + 1 ton Cargo space = 20000 Cr income; 7085 Cr cost.
Profit = 12915 Cr.
1 Middle Passage in HP Cabin = 16000 Cr income; 5668 Cr cost. Profit =
10332 Cr.
1 Low Passage = 2000 Cr income; 1417 Cr cost. Profit = 583 Cr.
1 ton Cargo = 2000 Cr income; 1417 Cr cost. Profit = 583 Cr.

Can she operate profitably on a 50-60% loadout in each category?

High Passage x 6: Cost = 42510 per month. Running with three staterooms
occupied at all times produces 60k Cr, a profit of 17490 Cr.
Middle Passage x 6: Cost = 34008 Cr per month. Running with 3 staterooms
occupied at all times produces 48k Cr, a profit of 13992 Cr.
Low Passage x 20: Cost = 28340 Cr per month. Running with 12 Berths
occupied at all times produces 24k Cr, a loss of 4340 Cr per month. Actual
cost of Low Passage would have to be 1181 Cr.
Cargo x 76 tons: Cost = 107692 Cr per month. Running 60% full (46 tons)
produces 92k Cr, or a shortfall of 15692 Cr. Actual cost of Cargo should
be 1171 Cr per ton.

So, no she can\'t. However, if we assume that (somehow) the Captain gained
8 MCr equity in a 10 year old ship (worth 75% of its new cost), he
effectively has payments on only 15.375 MCr ... or monthly repayments of
only 64063 Cr, dropping operational expenses to around 135000 Cr, or a
cost per usable ton for a stock FT model of 1125 Cr per commercially
usable ton.

On a line item basis, this translates to -

1 High Passage Cabin + 1 ton Cargo space = 20000 Cr income; 5625 Cr cost.
Profit = 14375 Cr.
1 Middle Passage in HP Cabin = 16000 Cr income; 4500 Cr cost. Profit =
11500 Cr.
1 Low Passage = 2000 Cr income; 1125 Cr cost. Profit = 875 Cr.
1 ton Cargo = 2000 Cr income; 1125 Cr cost. Profit = 875 Cr.

Can she operate profitably on a 50-60% loadout in each category?

High Passage x 6: Cost = 33750 Cr per month. Running with three staterooms
occupied at all times produces 60k Cr, a profit of 26250 Cr.
Middle Passage x 6: Cost = 27k Cr per month. Running with 3 staterooms
occupied at all times produces 48k Cr, a profit of 21k Cr.
Low Passage x 20: Cost = 22500 Cr per month. Running with 12 Berths
occupied at all times produces 24k Cr, a *PROFIT* of 2500 Cr per month!
Cargo x 76 tons: Cost = 85500 Cr per month. Running 60% full (46 tons)
produces 92k Cr, or *PROFIT* of 6500 Cr.

Ergo, it *is* possible to run the ship at break even for around 60%
capacity *and* keep the "standard" 1000 Cr per ton cargo shipping cost!

So, the solution, each roll of "Starship" on a the Merchant Benefit Table
represents 8 MCr equity in a *new* starship, which may be increased to 16
MCr equity in an older starship (at 10 years of age added each time this
alternative is used). This would mean that a Captain who was quite lucky
could own a 20 year old stock FT *outright* after two rolls of "Starship"
on the table.

Assume that the incredible luck of rolling a "Starship" result three times
means that you can take a 10 year old ship that is owned *outright* ... or
a twenty year old one that has up to 8 MCr worth of improvements to it.

In this situation, there is *absolutely* no reason why you should have to
take a stock FT. There\'s no reason why the 8 MCr equity couldn\'t be used
to purchase a different vessel ... but adding an extra 8 MCr for age would
not necessarily make the vessel 10 years old, it would depend on the
actual cost of the vessel.

For example, 8 MCr equity could be used to buy a 1000 ton Free Trader (J1,
M1, no weapons or refining, worth 94 MCr. It would mean that the new
"owner" would only own around 3.4 years worth of it, or 6.8 years worth if
he takes the 16 MCr "age for equity" option. Payments would be based on
either a loan of 86 MCr or of 78 MCr depending.

Makes the whole system much more flexible without putting the players into
a deep financial hole!

Oh, and before you complain that its "unrealistic" for a character to have
amassed that sort of money in a potentially quite short time, well, even
the old rule was quite unrealistic if you take that as a criteria. All it
means is that the character probably speculated on his own behalf in the
starship he was employed on - and made a killing (probably a couple!)
along the way. Unlikely, perhaps, but not impossible!

And the huge advantage is that it makes the system work for PCs.

Hmmm. IIRC, the rule in CT is something like, "Each stateroom on a
starship, occupied or not, involves a constant overhead of Cr2000 per
trip made." [CT/B2:P6&14]

In MT this changed to "if occupied" along with an explicit statement
that double occupancy requires twice the normal cost. [MT/IE:P89/RM:P82]

I\'ve always taken both to mean "per two weeks" since the expectation
is one jump and one week in port per fortnight.

A two person limit per stateroom makes sense when there _is_ a
provision that staterooms include all important life support
facilities.

The standard Traveller starship designs have always forced their
merchant owners to find clever ways to stay ahead of the bank.


The more interesting question to me is "What custom merchant ship
design can be created that would maximize profit given the economic 
model of trade in the Imperium, since the standard designs don\'t?"

OK, how about this. With the current "technology" available in Traveller,
a 100 ton Missile Bay contains 100 missiles ... if you assume CT 0.1 ton
missiles, thats 90% "waste" space (yes, I know it\'s reloading mechanism,
but we\'re also talking 30 minute turns here for a 100 kilo missile!); if
you assume 0.5 ton missiles, its better ... only 50% waste space.

Now, why not have VLS Box launchers ... *no* reloading mechanism.
Currently the naval versions can get close to 50% (the extra space is
because rocket exhaust has to be vented), however, in space versions, this
is not required ... a squib charge can be used to launch them from the box
and then the main motor (thruster plate or heplar, whatever) can kick in
at a suitable distance so the hull paint doesn\'t get too badly scorched.
Assume that it is more like a airborne rocket pod, and gets (say) 75%
usable space, or 750 0.1 CTrav missiles or 150 0.5 ton missiles.

Assume the 0.1 ton  missiles for a moment ... take a modest sized vessel,
a Destroyer (3000 tons in Supplement #9) or a Fleet Escort (5000 tons).
Assume half of the possible number of VLS launchers are installed ... 15
for the Destroyer or 25 for the Escort. That means a standard Desron (8
"DDGs") will have a one shot salvo of *90000* missiles (18000 if you
assume 0.5 ton types). An Esron (8 Escorts) would have a one shot salvo of
150000 missiles (30000 0.5 ton types). I do not care what sort of fire
control you have on your PD systems, this sort of initial salvo is
effectively unstoppable if it is targetted effectively (i.e. against a
relatively small number of ships, based on their fire control capacities)
... it simply overwhelms the PD Fire control no matter how good it is.

It gives light craft something that will make them useful in "line of
battle" against the larger vessels that would simply brush them aside
under normal circumstances. However, I would *not* see this as
*necessarily* the way to go for larger vessels ... you need *some*
capacity for closer ("gun") combat and for survivability that lighter
craft simply cannot achieve. I do not see missiles as a guaranteed winner,
but as a method of evening the odds ... one of tradeoffs. Sure, you
*could* have a BB (500 kilotons) with a one shot salvo of almost 2
*million* missiles, but only by foregoing conventional weapons ... and
once the VLS systems are expended, they can only be reloaded by a fleet
tender, so its a poor choice if sustained combat is expected. This is why
I see it as something that light ships would use.

Hmm, no, but 90000 might well do so ... and a Desron that can take out a
BB is a pretty good investment (a DN in Supplement 9 is worth around 180
DDs).

When the first atomic weapon was detonated, there was a serious question as
to wether the explosion would incinerate all the oxygen on Earth.  Really.
The knew the *theory* behind the bomb, but the practical application was an
unknown.. In a a similar vein, when Chuck Yaeger broke the sound barrier,
observers heard the sonic boom and assumed that the plane had exploded!  The
effect was perfectly logical, but no-one had tought to anticipate it.

The point I made earlier about the treatment of my cancer stands, we use
science we don\'t understand everday.

Since these were honor guards, I imagine that the helmets were not the
standard dress uniform.  I used the beret since it has an association in
Solomani history with elite units.

I agree with this.  I like many aspects of the TML, and I don\'t want to have to 
subscribe to several lists to get in on all the discussions.  We get a lot of traffic on 
TML because Traveller is a happening game, and there are a lot of people out there who 
want to talk about it.

Nobody has time to wade through all of these messages, so do what I do (and I\'m sure 
others do as well).  Check out the title of each post and delete it is not something 
that your are interested in.  I choose only a few threads to participate in.  

Make this list work for you--not be a burden.  You don\'t have to read and respond to 
every message.

I agree with this as well.  Take the "Hop, Skip, and Jump" thread that I started.  I got 
the answer that I was looking for and stopped participating in the thread, but there are 
still several others who are discussing the finer points of jumpspace.  The discussion 
has mutated onto different subjuects.  It would be a real hassel if the participants 
were forced to jump to another mail list just because the discussion turned in another 
direction.

Kenneth.

Agreed! ;-)

Well, sort of. :-)

If one trip takes 6-8 days for one jump plus the time to travel from
the departure world to a jump point and from the jumpspace exit point
to the destination world, then the total time of one trip could be as
long as 9 days or as little as 6 days using the MT/IE travel time
tables.

Maybe the figure should be Cr145.86 per day per human-sized sophont 
on board. :-)

To take this to an extreme, maybe it should be Cr1.43 per kg of live 
creature per day -or- Cr0.06 per kg per hour!?

This would have the side effect of making passage for smaller races
more profitable... [he,he,he...] ... but it would fit with the fact
that smaller creatures would likely use less life support resources.

It would also make some ship captains happier to have the passengers
off board as soon as possible -- since time would be (literally) money!

Cheers,

I agree arguing won\'t do any good.  However, this is an important point
that should be cleared up.  A great deal of bad blood was brewed over the
actual and precieved polcies of TSR in this area.  I fully understand FFE
and IG\'s need to protect their rights, but there is a fine line to walk
here between protecting their rights and freezing out fan participation.
                                                       
YOU shouldn\'t try to state IG or FFE\'s policy in this area, because you
aren\'t offical.  Ken and Marc *need* to do it!

I *hope* their position will be somewhat more liberal and fan
friendly than certain other companies.  Either way, this is an issue that
won\'t go away, and will get ugly if it isn\'t dealt with.

When you consider how long some in-system transfers can take, then you 
positively NEED "microjumps."  Even with reactionless normal-space 
drives, it\'s a long, long way from here to Jupiter (and beyond).  If 
you\'ve got the jump fuel to spend, a "microjump" is a better way to go.  In 
TNE, where you have limited reaction mass, many times it\'s the only way 
to go.

Sure, you\'re still dealing with the one-week travel time, but I\'ve not 
seen anywhere (not even in the "Starship Operator\'s Manual") where the 
MINIMUM length of a jump is defined.  This brings up a nasty idea that 
one of the players in my campaign brought up:  Where does it say that you 
can\'t jump NOWHERE?  He wanted to give pursuers the idea that he\'d given 
them the slip by jumping out-system, only to reappear a week later and 
continue whatever silliness had gotten him into trouble in the first place.

Dunno if it will be helpful, or if I perhaps misunderstand your question 
(gee, that\'d be unusual for me[G]), but have you checked out the 
Role-Playing Ship Combat System at http://www.qrc.com/~wildstar or is 
that just not the type of stuff you are looking for?

[snipped major stuff, all very good]

I love this stuff.  It\'s fun to develop true-to-life reasoning behind 
what IG has given us.  

I was thinking that perhaps some brave souls have ventured out to those 
"unknown" sections of space, perhaps hoping to open a new trade route ---- 
or to convert some folks to their religion! ---- but they never returned 
(simply ran out of fuel, ran into a xenophobic culture, whatever).  This 
might discourage further exploration...or it might be a great adventure 
hook for some hardy PCs....

Thanks for the great post, Leonard!

According to a certian sourcebook from the official RPG about said subject
(hope that\'s ambiguos enough to avoid prosecution :).  These are the stats
that are relevant to Traveller.


The M. Falcon is 26.7 meters long.  Having enough cargo capacity for 100
metric tons.  In addition it had supplies for 2 months of operation.  2
crewmen and 6 passengers each having a bunk.  Performance wise the M. Falcon
couldn\'t out perform anything but big clunkers like T Bombers.  In this RPG,
a lot about maneuverability relies on the pilots skill.  It was once again
much slower than fighters but faster than most transport.
Weaponry consisted of 2 quad lasers, 2 missle launchers, and 1 light laser.
If your interested in specific stats I send them to you but I\'m not sure
about Copyright in this info (believe me the said company is very strict or
so I\'ve heard).

Sorry, they can lose their trademarks. They *cannot* lose their

Aspirin was a trademark and is the classic example of losing one thru
failure to protect. And I thought that Kleenex had lost trademark
status long ago?

As long as the people *referring to* the Traveller trademark include
mention that it *is* a trademark, the trademark status is not in
danger. It\'s allowing people to use your trademark as if it was a
generic term that can lose you the trademark.

And as far as copyright goes, you are free to let some people use your
copyrighted material for free and insist that others pay for it. That\'s
your option and has no effect on your copyright.

What you do have to worry about is people releasing *Public domain*
material that incoroprates your copyrighted work. That\'s why (for
example) Borland requires you to either put *your* copyright on
software produced with their compilers or include a notice indicating
that your program contains code copyrighted by them.

> In short, it doesn\'t mean IG and FFE/Marc Miller are jerks - they HAVE to

I suspect that the statement Joe made needs a bit of fine tuning. There
are things that FFE needs to do. But they cannot require us to assign
them rights in *our* creations. They can no more market something I
write that is based on the Traveller rules *without* my permission than
I can market it without *their* permission.

Sorry, there *is* a middle ground. They cannot stop me from writing
anything I please. They can stop me from publishing it, but even then,
if I have the money, I can take them to court claiming that my work is
not sufficiently derivative for them to claim that I\'m infringing on
their copyright. The court decides.

And if they try to publish it without my permission, they *will* lose.
Because *I*, and *I* alone have copyright on the portions of the work
that are *not* taken from the rules & background. So unless they
acquire those rights from me, they are in trouble.

So the possibilities are:

1. exclusively their work
2. part theirs, part mine
3. exclusively mine

In case 2, I can license them to use my material, they can license me
to use theirs, or we can do some sort of joint venture. But for
*anyone* to publish the material *all* of the people with rights to it
have to be dealt with.

And if FFE or anybody else says I *must* assign my rights to them to
write anything usable with their game, *I* sure as hell won\'t write for
them. And it\'ll be because they\'d be going *far* beyond what is
necessary to protect their rights.

It was my duty, considering I started that whole copyright\\trademark debate

What say we put the speculation on the back burner until Marc responds to 
my question?  

To re-iterate:  I reported exactly what Ken Whitman told me, including a

speculation, by me as well as others, is just that: speculation.  Until 
we hear from Marc Miller, we don\'t really know what the policy is.

Joe, does this mean that IG will be making CSC or similar guides for each
Mileu?  Or that, each Mileu sourcebook will have an addition to the CSC,
giving equipment and technologies suitable for thier settings?

Marc, this will work as long as you clearly demark which areas are, well,
\'de-Marced\' as strictly for referees.  That way people can safely develop
areas knowing that future IG products will fit right in with their campaigns.
 And those of us that don\'t have time to lovingly detail sectors can rely on
the official background, which will of course include fairly large contiguous

There\'s also problems with the DGP data - the systems aren\'t random (their
random number generator wasn\'t).

To be honest, I rather like the idea of being able to generate
worlds/subsectors that fit into the Imperium.  As long as I know that we

It\'s been so long, that I\'ve forgotten how I scaled my model of the Falcon
to come up with a 300-ton figure.  I _believe_ that the box mentioned a
nominal scale on it (1:144?) and I used that to figure the ship\'s
dimensions.

It\'s worth noting that this came out to about 300 dtons, and made the main
deck (between the hemispheres) almost exactly the right size for a single
Traveller deck, with a lower drive deck below where the "lump" is on the
bottom of the ship.

  Thanks for pointing this out.  I had obviously overlooked this end of the
spectrum, and I\'m glad to see that someone else caught it.  I guess that\'s
what I get for posting statistical-type theories without doing my homework.
I still don\'t particularly relish the idea of rolling half-dice, but I\'ll
take your word on it, at least for now, that they are, in fact, a necessary
evil.
 
[Regarding my claim that skill-levels in T4 seem to be worth less on a
point-for-point basis than they were in CT/MT]:

   We may just have to agree to disagree here.  I won\'t argue that the 
descriptions provided in the rulebook have skill levels being consistent
between the various editions, but the fact remains that the "average" 
character generated under the new system will not only have more skills, but
most likely will have them at generally higher levels.  When I looked back
over the PCs I\'ve generated, I see that, if anything, my earlier claim 
underestimated the amount of skills they have-- 2 or 3 skills at l-3 or l-4,
6 or so skills at l-2, and around 10 l-1 skills, each.  In the new system
we not only have the possibility of up to 6 skills per Term, we also have
all those background skills and special bonuses from Higher Education and
such.  If we follow the old CT/MT conventional wisdom that level 1 is
"trained," levels 2-3 are "experienced", levels 4-5 are "expert" and level-6+
is "superbad", then it seems that we\'ve gone from one extreme (the
marginally-trained CT Scouts and Others) to the other (where every character
has an incredibly diverse knowledge and skill base, and is a certified expert
in several fields).  While perhaps I over-compensated by suggesting that we
effectively divide the T4 skill by 2 to get an equivalent CT/MT skill, I 
still think that the difference in the power-levels as presented is 
significant, and I also think it\'s a telling sign that T4 seems to have 
done away with level-0 ("marginally trained") and now assigns level-1 in all
of those old cases.
   In fact, IIRC, it was the fact that it\'s so easy under the new system 
to get these high-stat high-skill characters who break the task system that
the need for a fix was first realized.  In CT, for instance, it really
doesn\'t matter whether a character with stat-13, skill-5 can walk all over
the rules because you almost never see such a person.  Now, by golly, they\'re
everywhere! (especially if the player chooses his advances).
   I\'m no longer sure what my actual point in writing all of the above was,
but I guess what I\'m trying to say is to be careful when designing the 
task-fix to base it on characters under the new rules (regarding which, I 
thought the "average" PC you posted seemed pretty puny compared to what I\'ve
generated: do you recall how many Terms he went through?) and not some
idealized conception of "typical" that may be based on outdated notions (such
as the character with nothing but level-1 and 2 skills). 
    Before I ramble any further, I think I really need to take a look at
what you\'ve come up with and see how it suits my fancy.

  Maybe I\'ve accidentally erased something, but I haven\'t seen this fix that
you\'re referring to posted.  If somehow I did miss it, could someone either
email it to me or tell me which digest it appeared in?

OK, Eris, Joe, Trent, Paul, David, Declan, and everyone else on TML, here is my task 
system submitted for your approval.

Try to go easy on me.



I.  TASK DIFFICULTIES.
Remember in part one, I went over my 10 goals for this project and discussed how I 
achieved them.  See that post for further details on why I have made the task 
difficulties as they are presented here (also see that post for why I am still using 
some half die when many people, including myself, do not like using them).

In a nut shell, we wanted a task system that would make the harder difficulty categories 
(staggering and impossible) harder to make without makeing the easier difficulties 
(average and difficult) harder to hit as well.  And, we wanted this system to be an easy 
fix to the problems in T4.  We didn\'t want to re-invent the wheel--we only wanted to 
tweak the T4 system.

I have done that here.  I can\'t think of an easier fix than just doing everything as 
detailed in T4 except changing the dice thrown on only two difficulty categories.  The 
only thing that I have done differently from what is already published is that I have 
made the staggering and impossible categories harder by requiring more dice be thrown 
with them.  It is an easy, easy fix, and you might be surprised at how much it improves 
the probabilities to where we wanted them to be.

I present my chart to you.  All probabilities are rounded to the nearest percent.  I got 
my probability information from the posts of Joe Walsh and Robert Flammang, so please 
don\'t crucify me if the numbers are a little off (I\'m not saying they are.  In fact, I 
think that they are pretty close--I\'m just not saying I checked their work).

Easy tasks are, of course, automatic for skilled characters.

So here\'s the probability chart.

		Easy	Avg.	Diff.	Form.	Stag.	Imp.
Target Number	1.5	2	2.5	3	4	5
	
	2	6	3	1	1	0	0

II.  THE TEST.
Well, I think the probabilities stack up pretty good against any previous Traveller 
system--MT included.  If you remember in my 10 goals, I picked a character out of my 
campaign to test any new task system, so, in this section, I want to test what I have 
printed above.

Here\'s the character again:

	Ulric Birtran Harrisani
        
                        SKILL           LEVEL   GOV CHAR
        ----
        STR 7           HISTORY         1       EDU
        DEX 7           LONG BLADE      1       DEX OR STR
        END 3           COMPUTER        4       EDU OR INT
        INT 9           GRAV CRAFT      1       DEX
        EDU 6           TRADER          4       INT OR SOC
        SOC 6           CAROUSING       1       SOC
                        LIASON          1       INT OR EDU OR SOC
                        BROKER          1       INT OR EDU
                        VAC SUIT        1       DEX
                        ADMIN           1       SOC OR EDU



Doing some quick figuring using T4 target number calculation, we can see that Ulric only 
has 4 target numbers that can be derived from any of his skills--7, 8, 10, 13.

Remember that the 13 target number was the one that made me start this thread in the 
first place--I could not buy that Ulric had a 44% chance on an impossible task.  This is 
what told me that the task system needed fixing in the first place.

So, let\'s look at his probablities on each target number.

		Easy	Avg.	Diff.	Form.	Stag.	Imp.
Target Number	1.5	2	2.5	3	4	5
	
	7	Auto	58	29	16	3	0
	8	Auto	72	29	16	3	0
	10	Auto	92	71	50	16	3
	13	Auto	97	95	82	44	15



I think ole\' Ulric stacks up pretty well considering his skills and abilities.  Notice 
that the previous 44% on the impossible category (for his specialty in computers) drops 
to a very agreeable 15% with my system.  Still, Ulric doesn\'t do too bad with his low 
level skills either.  I like this.  I like this a lot.  The impossible is kept 
impossible.  The speciality skills have a real good chance in just about every category, 
and the low level skills are very playable.  I don\'t think we could have asked for a 
better fix.

Let\'s do a few more tests.  I want to take a very marginal character, an average 
character, and the super geek.  Here\'s their stats:

	Marge the Marginal	Stat-2;		Skill-1		Tgt. Num. 3
	Avery the Average	Stat-7;		Skill-2		Tgt. Num. 9
	Glen the Geek		Stat-15;	Skill-7		Tgt. Num. 22

OK, let\'s look at their probs now.

		Easy	Avg.	Diff.	Form.	Stag.	Imp.
Target Number	1.5	2	2.5	3	4	5
	
	3	Auto	8	1	1	0	0
	9	Auto	83	57	38	10	2
	22	Auto	97	97	93	87	78


Poor old Marge doesn\'t do that well, but that is to be expected from someone who is just 
about crippled.  I agree with her probs.

Avery is our average character.  Compare his probs with the percentages that everyone 
posted for their ideal average character.  My numbers were:
		Easy	95%
		Avg.	80%
		Diff.	40%
		Form.	20%
		Stag.	10%
		Imp.	5%

Avery the average is damn close to these numbers.  Easy is automatic--is close to my 
pick of 95%.  The average category is only off 3%.  The difficulty category is off 17% 
in the character\'s favor.  The form category is off 18% to the character\'s favor.  
Staggering is right on the money.  And, impossible is only off 2%!

I like these numbers.

Now let\'s consider Glen the geek.  He\'s got the best attribute and an outstanding skill 
level.  He\'s just about in the 90 percentile bracket for every category except 
impossible, and he\'s got an 80% chance for that.  But I have no problem with this.  A 
character with his stats should have this benefit.


III.  SUMMARY.
So, I submit it to all of you.  This task fix is a good one.  It does what we set out to 
do, and it is easy to implement with T4.  I think it is better thant the MT system.  

OK, I\'m done.  I\'m ready to tackle whatever comments, questions, or critisims that you 
might have.

Please note that some of the goals that I set forth for this project are not met by just 
this fix.  I haven\'t addressed the problem of skills being weighted too strongly, etc.

Well, I have a fix for that as well.  I know that some of you don\'t have a problem with 
the way target numbers are computed in T4, and this is why I handled the new difficulty 
system first.  You people can use this system, if you want, and forget about the rest of 
this thread.

For the rest of us, there are other problems with the T4 task system.  I am going to 
propose a fix for those in part three.

Until then,

Kenneth.

    'body' => '     THE IMPERIAL HOPE: A GRADUATE SCHOOL OF THE UNIVERSITY OF SYLEA
     
     The University of Sylea\'s Faculty of Arts offers two-year scholarships 
     for outstanding social sciences students aboard the "Imperial Hope", a 
     converted 2,000t merchant which serves as a travelling graduate 
     school. 
     
     The "Imperial Hope" is a surplus 2,000t streamlined merchant, converted 
     to a social science research school. The "Hope" will usually be 
     encountered in orbit around one of the Sylean or nearby worlds, and its 
     students and staff will be engaged in various research and coursework 
     activities, both on board and on the mainworld. 
     
     The "Hope" only has jump-1 capability and so rarely leaves the Sylean 
     Main. The ship generally tours Core sector for eleven months each year, 
     returning to Sylea for one month of overhaul, refit and staff rotation. 
     The ship\'s itinerary is determined (within reason!) by the specific 
     research being undertaken by the students and staff. Insystem time 
     ranges from a few hours (refuelling only if there is nothing of 
     academic interest in the system) to a maximum of about four weeks. 
     
     Each graduate student receives a two-year berth aboard the "Hope", 
     which entitles them to a double-occupancy middle passage, full life 
     support, and access to onboard teaching, library and research 
     resources. In addition to their studies, students learn the basics of 
     operating a starship by assisting in various duties (roll 5+ on 1D for 
     each of Ship\'s Boat-1, Engineering-1, Steward-1). 
     
     At the end of their time aboard, the students receive a Masters degree 
     from the University of Sylea. Those completing the course with honours 
     are eligible to continue aboard for a further two years as junior 
     academic staff and researching to receive their doctorate. 
     
     Academic staff are organised into three schools: Politics, Economics and 
     Sociology. Some of the most outstanding social scientists of the Imperium 
     have spent time as academic staff aboard the "Imperial Hope". Staff members 
     sign aboard for up to four years, after which time they exchange with other 
     staff from universities all over the Imperium. Staff positions aboard the 
     "Hope" are highly prestigious, and confer a temporary +1 SOC (to a maximum 
     of A, and only while a member of staff). 
     
     The shipboard crew of the "Hope" are a collection of retired Scout, Navy 
     and Merchant personnel. However, it is surprisingly easy to find a position 
     aboard, as some crewmembers quickly tire of the academic staff and their 
     "caramel sauce" students ("Why caramel sauce? Think of something rich and 
     very thick..."). Students and junior crewmembers take considerable pleasure 
     in baiting each other, generally in good humour. 
     
     The "Hope" is outfitted with excellent resources, including an extensive 
     holocrystal library. While insystem, the library is updated hourly via data 
     link to local library resources. 
     
     Adventure hooks: 
     1. PCs may be graduate students aboard the ship. 
     2. PCs may be academic staff aboard the "Imperial Hope" (required: 
     Int, Edu or Soc A+ plus a doctorate in one of the social sciences)
     3. PCs may be members of the permanent shipboard crew of the "Imperial 
     Hope"; the "Hope" also signs crewmembers aboard for temporary working 
     passage.

    I\'m putting together a Imperial Navy, c. 0, costume to wear at
the T4 stand at OrkCon in Germany on the 1,2,3 of November.
I\'ve taken as my basic model the military type in Elmore\'s
interior artwork in T4. However he is obviously depicting a much
later era as the sunburst is quite clearly dark on light. The 
Mileau-0 sunburst should be yellow on black, straight off of
Cleon\'s Arms.
    I started with basic black combat trousers and shirt (German
issue, actually :-), and a pair of biker boots. The trousers were
fine but I added shoulder and epaulette patches to the shirt.
Also I modified the collar from a standard to a mandarin. I got
a gold lanyard for the left shoulder and bought a black baseball
cap (couldn\'t find berets in Dublin) which I sewed another sunburst
onto. I still need to get a pistol belt and create some SF looking
things to hang off it.
    The only place I am stuck is how to do the combat ribbons.
Is there any military person out there who can tell me how the
real ones are done? Any suggestions on how to do a mock up?
They just look like a bar with different coloured bits of cloth. But
what do you use as the backing and how do you get it to stick
to the uniform right?

    For people\'s interests, after much struggle I worked out a pretty
good way to make patches without going insane. Take a circle
of yellow felt the size you want your patch to be. Then get some
black acrylic paint (I used minature paint) and a pencil. Draw lightly
a ring just inside the circle at about the right hight for reasonable
triangles. Then mark at regular intervals points along the edge
and circle alternatively. These will be the end points of the triangle.
Now, in pencil connect the points. Don\'t just draw straight lines.
Curve them or do spline like waves. Lastly draw another circle
inside of the first one. This will be the guide for the inner ring separating
the "ring of fire" from the central disk.
    With the black paint, ink in the outer triangles. Don\'t cut them out!
This make the felt fray and impossible to sew. Just black them out.
(Note: you have to be planning to sew it onto a black surface). When
you are done also paint the along the inner circle you have drawn.
    Let it all dry completely. When you are done stitch it onto your
surface with black thread by sewing through the inked in bits. It forms
a firm attachment and the thread isn\'t visible.
    I can\'t say how well it washes!

     Cheers,
        Jo

Ok, I read \'little lizards\' as Dryone & not the Hiver bully boys.

helpful suggestions. The main revision is that I have bumped all the Base
Target Numbers up by 10 (the original version was deemed too difficult).

The benefits of this system:
  * only two dice are rolled for all tasks,
  * no half-dice,
  * skill levels count for more than stat points,
  * target numbers can be calculated before play begins,
  * characters with high stats and/or skills are not super-powerful,
  * similar to a percentile system, hence more intuitive,
  * no pesky bell curve,
  * each increase in difficulty represents an equal decrease in probability,
  * each increase in skill or stat represents an equal increase in probability,
  * intuitive,
  * requires little conversion from T4,
  * easily modified to suit situation, taste, style of game.

[You might note that the base target numbers now end in sixes, not zeros as
before. Zeros don\'t exist in the 11-66 matrix, so that didn\'t work for
applying negative modifiers (for characters with very a low stat, for
instance).]

If you try the system out, please do let me know how well it works for you.
Also please report to me any bugs, typos, or mathematical errors. Much
appreciated.

             The 2D Task System
                    v1.1
          A simple task roll system
   compatible with Marc Miller\'s Traveller (T4)

This system uses a simple roll of two dice to determine task success or
failure. No more rolling a half-dozen dice, no more half-dice, and no more
skewed probabilities in the higher stat+skill levels. Best of all, no pesky
bell curve! And skill levels count for more than stat points. It combines
many of the advantages of a percentile system with the traditional D6-only
system of CT/MT/T4; thus little or no conversion is necessary.

The task roll is two dice in succession, providing a two-digit number
between 11 and 66 (just like the old CT Trade table). As in T4, the task is
successful if the player rolls below the target number.

The base target number is determined by the Difficulty Level:

Difficulty Level   Base Target #
   Impossible           06-
   Staggering           16-
   Formidable           26-
   Difficult            36-
   Average              46-
   Easy                 56-
   
The base target number is modified by the PC\'s skill and then by the
corresponding characteristic.

Each skill level adds 2 to the target number. Thus the skill modifier is
(skill*2). For 0-level skill tests, don\'t halve the characteristic (as in
T4). Instead, increase the Difficulty by one level (by simply adding 1 to
the first digit of the base target number).

There are two suggested methods for determining the inflence of
characteristics (other methods are possible):

1) Only above-average characteristics have an influence: for each point
above 7, add 1 to the base target number. Thus the stat modifier is:
(stat-7) for stats above 7; otherwise no modifier. (This may be preferable
at low skill levels.)

2) Above- *and* below-average characteristics effect the target number: for
each point below 7, subtract 1 from the target number; for each point
above, add 1. Thus the stat modifier is -(7-stat) for stats below 7, and
+(stat-7) for those above 7.

NOTE, however, that these modifiers are not added in base-10. The modifiers
are counted as steps up or down the 11-66 matrix:

     <----down        up---->
01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 
21, 22, 23, 24 etc...

Example: a character with Skill 3 and Stat 9 is attempting a Difficult
task. The base target is 26-. He adds 6 for the skill (3*2=6) + 2 for the
above-average stat (9-7=2), for a modifier of +8. The result is not 38, as
it would be in base-10, because 38 doesn\'t exist on the matrix. Instead, he
counts 8 steps up the matrix; so the actual target number is 42-.

If this seems complicated, it won\'t be after you\'ve tried it a few times.
It soon becomes intuitive and quick. To save time, target number mods for
all skills can be pre-calculated by the players, before the game begins.
Adjusting for Difficulty Level is a simple matter of altering the first
digit of the target number.

For 0-level skill tests, don\'t halve the characteristic (as in T4).
Instead, increase the Difficulty by one level (by simply adding 1 to the
first digit of the base target number).

As always, a roll of two sixes is a spectacular failure, and two ones is a
spectacular success - even if the target number is below 11. 

Here\'s a chart to showing the resulting targets for an average stat
(ignoring for the moment the Spectacular Result rules)...

Stat = 7                      Skill
              0     1     2     3     4     5     6     7 
Easy         52    62    64    66   Auto  Auto  Auto  Auto
Average      42    52    54    56    62    64   Auto  Auto  
Difficult    32    42    44    46    52    54    56    62

Bump these figures up by 2.7 if Spectacular Success rule is applied.

NOTE: In general, most DMs given in the rule books will have a lessened
effect on the results, though they will still be important. The referee may
wish to amplify certain DMs, depending on the situation.

The T4 Multiple Actions rule will not work in this system. A new rule is
needed: when attempting multiple actions, do not reduce the stat mods.
Instead, increase the difficulty two levels for each extra action (-2 to
the target number). Thus, for a character with stat of 7 and skill of 6,
the target number for a single Difficult action is 56-; for two such
actions, 36-; for three, 16-. (Obviously, this rule does not allow
characters to perform as many extra actions as the original rule.) [I would
be interested to hear suggestions for a better formulation of this rule.]

     Actually, it takes exactly the same amount of fuel to do 4 X J1 as it 
     doe to do 1 X J4.  Also, the jump drive is smaller, so you can carry 
     more fuel :-).  I like to design TL12 scout ships with enough fuel in 
     the main tanks to make one jump at the maximum rating of the jump 
     drive (i.e. J2), and have a decent sized cargo hold with collapsible 
     fuel tanks fitted.  This gives it the flexability to carry a good 
     amount of cargo on short trips, or to fill up the tanks and do 
     multiple jumps (enough fuel for another J2 is usually possible).

As far as I can tell, this is the contingency that Ken\'s statement was
seeking to provide for.  By placing the Copyright after the Trademark info,
and no name mentioned after the Copyright, IIRC that means the creator of
the material is holding the copyright, not IG.  If you put FFE or IG AFTER

I\'ve pretty much come to the conclusion that the actual dimensions of the 
falcon are somewhere between what you came up with for exterior 
dimensions and what I came up with using interior dimensions.  I don\'t 
have anything to go with for true scale but through guesstamating the 
size of rooms seen in the movies, movie camera\'s can fool you on size 
really easily, I\'m coming up with about 40m which makes the cockpit 3.5 
or so meters across making it about 12 feet across.

After reorganizing my living room, I had to get a new couch in here 
anyway, this is probably pretty close to the cockpit\'s true dimensions.

congratulations to the inventor!

A couple of points arise:

Is Homo Sapiens really Homo Psionisis? Was the whole purpose of the Ancients
to create a psionic primate, perhaps in order to integrate it into Droyne
Society more fully?  Perhaps the Geonee/Chirper interaction is an echo of this?

Did the genetic engineering occur long after the Ancients\' Final War, as our
knowledge of H. Sapiens\' first appearance would suggest? Were the engineers
the last tragic relic of the doomed Ancient civilisation trying to light

Greetings Sapient!
This printed guide is an abstract of Imperial Publication 03-8462872, "Guide
to Supplies, Consumables and Trade Opportunities in the Imperium". It
contains information compiled from over 70 trade and survey expeditions to
worlds that have been out of contact with the Imperium for over 1000 years.
While each world is unique, certain technological developments have been
fairly predictable. This publication lists that subset of items which
explorers have found most useful to have on hand for convenience or trade
purposes, and those which have been most commonly encountered on other
worlds, and which are of note either for economic potential, hazard or
curiousity\'s sake.

This guide is broken down into the following cross-linked sections:
 Imperial Surplus
 Personal protective gear
 Exploration tools
 Personal mobility
 Communications
 Commercial goods (uncategorized)
 Vehicles (plus design tools)

Full specifications, suppliers and case histories of use for any item can be
downloaded via references in this guide for a nominal fee. Mention of an item
in this abstract does not imply endorsement by an Imperial agency or any
guarantee of performance, either express or implied. All comments by end
users are guaranteed to be representative of the majority opinion for the
relevant item, but are not guaranteed to be reliable. Individual reference
locators are current at the time of download in case personal contact is
desired.

In game terms, this abstract is a single sheet of paper that can be

LAV-10
The LAV-10 is a tracked utility vehicle superceded by fusion-powered antigrav
units and removed from secondary service in year -21. Normal role was as
prime mover, non-combat troop transport or light weapons platform. 

The Central Storage Depot at Port Sidon has a large number of LAV-10 utility
vehicles for sale for export or metals reclamation. No warranty is expressed
or implied as to usability except for a guaranteed recyclable mass of 3,600kg
per unit. LAV-10 units are available for 2500Cr each in minimum quantities of
10 and have a shipping mass of approximately 6,000kg each.

The surplus LAV-10\'s may be missing tracks, engines or instrumentation. While
they are sealed for use with life support, it is not currently installed, and
while wiring and data paths for military electronics are intact, all sensors
and communications gear has been removed. On average, five units can be
disassembled to get one LAV-10 in good used condition and a lot of spare
parts. This process will take about 200 man-hours in a vehicle repair shop,
and this time can include retrofitting with a Fusion+ unit for an additional
1500Cr in parts and labor.

EVA-11
Current manufacture hostile environment suit, applicable for industrial work
in zero-g, vacuum, or non-breathable environments. It contains state of the
art systems to increase the safety and efficiency of the unit and costs
approximately 100KCr new. Used or reconditioned units may be available from
mining or construction companies for a discount of up to 60%, but may be
close to or past their warranted operational lifetime of 2000 hours use. The
normal suit masses 100kg, which includes a current manufacture Fusion+ unit
and antigrav harness so that when activated it has zero weight. However, its
mass is still significant and should be taken into account.

The EVA-11 has full atmosphere support for the minimum 72 hour duration of
the power plant fuel, sufficient fluid reserves for 48 hours of normal
consumption and sanitary hookups for similar duration, provided they are
attached. Normal entry is accomplished from the back, takes only a few
minutes and can be done wearing normal clothes. However, a special EVA
undersuit ("suit skivvies") is recommended for long-duration use to avoid
chafing and blisters (-1DM to Intelligence from distraction after 6 hours
without them). 

Performance figures vary by manufacturer of EVA suits, but the EVA-11 is
capable of 2g acceleration, has continental range communications (nominal
range 3,000km), transponder, inertial navigation and autopilot, a full suite
of on-board environmental sensors including multispectrum visual and
discriminatory audio, built-in biomonitoring, self-sealing of punctures, and
a flexible outer shell for micrometeroid protection, with a rigid optically
compensated helmet (armor rating of 3). Note that non-penetrating impacts may
cause damage to the fabric, thermal distribution and insulation underlayers
of the suit. Acquire documentation of authorized repair of any apparent
damage to a used suit you wish to purchase. This will be listed in the
service record of the suit\'s log computer.

The wearer of an EVA-11 or equivalent suit takes a -2DM on all Dexterity
tasks due to the mass and thickness of the suit, and -3DM to Endurance tasks
if forced to use the suit in a gravity well (contragrav may negate the suit
weight so that you do not have to walk, but you still have to move the heavy
arms and legs of the suit under your own power). If they do not have Vac
suit-0 or better, any action taken in combat requires an Average task on
their default to avoid a fumble or mishap.

"If you want to make yourself look impressive and be easier to spot on ship\'s
sensors, I recommend the reflec option. It doesn\'t affect performance much,
and most outfits doing mining or construction with heavy lasers get their
EVA\'s that way from the factory. It adds some cost, but it\'s cheaper than
paying off death or dismemberment benefits."

Neural Activity Sensor-13
Developed from tech level 12 psionic helmet theory, the neural activity
sensor (NAS) was first used medically. It remotely detects the electrical
activity of a life form\'s central nervous system and classifies it according
to amount and complexity. The data system compares the activity pattern to
known types of life, especially intelligent life. The unit requires some
skill to properly calibrate and operate, but once normal lifeform readings
for an area are gathered, an on-board expert system aids classification and
interpretation of data.

Detecting complex neurological activity in a target area is handled as a fire
combat task with a short range weapon (which may be aimed). This works vs. a
specific area the size of an outdoor square. Scanning a 30x arc is a -3DM and
aiming does not apply. In areas with a high density of life, the NAS may be
set to a certain threshold, which corresponds more or less to the size of the
creature (within 50%).

The portable unit consists of a backpack and a handset with a retractable
parabolic dish focuser. The handset in fact is not attached to the backpack,
and it can be operated up to 100 meters distant, which further extends the
range. The NAS runs off a pair of .5kg battery packs, which last for up to 20
hours of use. An optional scanning head (2500Cr) will allow unattended use of
the NAS (with an effective skill of 6) and scans a 30x arc per turn (the -3DM
is taken into account). These units are not available on Sylea, but limited
manufacture on other worlds has been reported.

****

Grav belt-12
Contragrav technology has finally reached a point where personal "jump belts"
are possible. These consist of a body harness and several contragrav moduules
arrayed around the body, with a small left or right hand mounted control
stick near the waist, and a power pack usually mounted near the lower back.
To get the low thrust and fine precision required, a dedicated computer
interface is used in conjunction with sensitive inertial sensors. Otherwise
the belt would only be capable of full thrust (3g) or none at all. The grav
belt is controlled partially by use of the stick, and partially by the wearer
shifting their weight. While a grav belt can be used in zero-g conditions
(within 1 planetary diameter), the lower of zero-g or grav belt skill is used
to reflect the increased difficulty. Top speed of a normal grav belt is
around 280m/turn or 168kph, with a normal endurance of 1000 hours between
refuelings and maintenance.

Increases in technology will increase the performance and decrease the mass
of the belt, but operation remains largely the same. Typical options
available at all TL\'s include:

Voice interface - Allows hands-free control of the grav belt, but lacks the
fine precision of manual control. Adds 500Cr to cost.

Roadgrid interface - Required for use in Sylean metropolitan areas. Includes
voice interface and remote control to automatically take you to your
destination. Adds 1000Cr to cost.

Emergency parachute - In the event of catastrophic failure, the single-use
parachute will deploy fully at any altitude of 100 meters or more, and the
user will usually only suffer minor injury (1D damage, armor does not
protect). Adds 500Cr to cost and 3kg to mass.

Backup power supply - A high-discharge battery capable of powering the grav
belt for 30 seconds (6 turns) in the event the main power plant fails.
Standard feature, no extra cost or mass.

****

Companions-12
These are a fairly recent development of the robot-makers art, and fall more
under the heading of androids. They are fully anthropomorphic robots designed
around an artificial duplicate of the human (or other) skeleton and
musculature, giving them a very realistic appearance and movement pattern.
Linked by several Comm channels to a central computer, they are capable of
mimicing human behavior in a variety of fields with the exception of eating
and drinking. Note that this is not in any sense an artificial intelligence,
but a very adaptable expert program system. The high cost of development and
programming has limited the market for Companions, and it is expected they
will remain a luxury item for the forseeable future. Purchase price includes
a 1 year warranty on all parts and software, and yearly maintenance contracts
are 25KCr per year.

In game terms, a Companion is detectable as artificial on an Average
intelligence or Engineering task, modified by any visual obscurement like
heavy clothing, helmet, etc. At higher TL\'s, the difficulty of this task will
increase. Stationary, they appear very lifelike, but when moving, the very
subtle differences become apparent to humans who have seen "the real thing"
all their lives. A Companion\'s stats are 7695-0. Intelligence represents the
flexibility of the programming. Education is irrelevant, as a Companion has
access to any information available on its central computer (or on the global
net if on Sylea). This computer has a rating of 4 for purposes of mimicing
human behavior, and a rating of 2 for general purpose tasks. The processor
inside the Companion is a specialized rating of 2, just for communications
with the central computer. Companions may be controlled by a virtual reality
harness, though this is not a standard option. Social Standing is always 0,
as they are not considered anything more than a fancy tool. For accomplishing
complex tasks or using skills, Companions can have any Dexterity skill at +1,
and any Intelligence skill at +2, so long as the task does not require
genuine creativity (note that "Acting" could be the Intelligence skill,
making the  "hey, it\'s a robot!" check have a -2DM. Normally a Companion
comes with up to 4 skills, and more can be acquired at the cost of 10-20KCr
each, as they are exceedingly complex programming tasks to develop, and any
skill which does not have a mass-market application will cost at least
100KCr, as it will be developed just for that single customer. If access to
its central computer is lost, the Companion is not capable of independent
action, and will usually remain stationary and power down except for
communications links.

Legally, Companions have no status, and like any other tool, the owner is
responsible for any misuse. So, while a Companion is sophisticated enough to
go out and buy your groceries, if it hits someone with your car, you will be
the one charged with manslaughter or negligent homicide. Current laws
regarding robotics are applied to Companions. No cases that touch on their
unique complexity have come to trial, but in this eventuality, changes or
modifications to existing law are expected.

For combat purposes, a Companion is treated as a character with the
appropriate skills. They have an inherent armor of 1 for purposes of being
impaired, although any damage may mar their synthetic flesh. They do not take
blunt trauma damage, and are only rendered "unconscious" when Endurance (i.e.
power source) is reduced to zero. They are immune to vacuum, water depths up
to 2 atmospheres, and can tolerate corrosive and insidious atmospheres for
several hours, though all of the above will affect their synthetic skin.

there is no longer any way to determine decorations for services in the
latest incarnation for Traveller.

I\'ve been thinking a little bit about it, and came up with something that
might be useful if someone is interested again in adding decorations. 
So, here we go:

Roll for decorations: 6 - on 2D6, no modifiers.  NOTE: Only Army, Navy or
Marines eligible.

To expand on this, this is what you would have to roll to generate the
various medals of the past:

Medal                                                 Roll        
Benefit (for current term ONLY)

Meritorius Conduct Under Fire (MCUF)   6 -           +1 for Promotion 
Medal for Conspicuous Gallantry(MCG)    4 -           +2 for Promotion
Starburst for Extreme Heroism(SEH)        2 -           +3 for Promotion

In other words, when a player rolls for decoration, he makes one roll. 
If he rolls 6 - , he gets the MCUF, 4 - he gets the MCG, and 2 - the SEH.
 The benefit is received ONLY on the roll for the current term, and
cannot be used elsewhere.  The benefits are straight from Mercenary/High
Guard, with the exception in the SEH of not offering a +1 Soc for it 

A stickler I always hated in the past was that a person, if he rolled
quite well for a particular mission then for a decoration roll, could get
4 MCUFs a term.  Where was this guy in the universe, in the Traveller
version of DOOM or something?  The new option above allows the generated
character to get a decoration once a term now.

Of course, the above system are for just the military careers.  I\'m still
thinking a little bit on how to fit this in with the others.  I\'m also at
work and am working from memory here as I write this.

Comments?  Are the chances to get a decoration TOO high?  Maybe we should
change it to 4 -/ 3 -/ 2 - instead?  Should the +1 Soc be added back in
for the SEH?

We need a way to allow maintenance of FFE\'s Trademark and Copyright rights
without people having to turn over their ownership and rights for any
material they create over to FFE...  We need a way to express this
(textually) in such a way that both sides can live by.

I honestly do not believe IG or FFE are out to "get" anyone or are "orges"
in any way.  I understand they must protect their rights.  But, people
should _NOT_ have to forgo their legitimate rights in order to protect IG
and FFE\'s legitimate rights.  I realize the problem is that
people/companies are increasingly "Suit Happy".  Like the Dire Straits song
"Telegraph Road":

"First came the Churches, Then came the Schools,
 Then came the Lawyers, Then came the rules..."

A question for IG/FFE:

Is is possible for KW or MM to develop a statement that can be appended to
a web page that allows for the creator to retain his/her ownership of
original material posted/published, and re-state the Copyright/Trademark
ownership/rights of IG/FFE?

If not, I imagine that many people, myself included, would be disuaded from
posting/publishing much material...

    'body' => 'David Joseph Smart has asked for a run-down of the FuRPiG mechanics,
to be posted to the list, so here it is.

Earl Wajenberg

- ----

The FuRPiG system runs on percentile dice and is centered on skills.
It is a non-commercial system invented for private use by Jim Burrows
(our GM) and contributed to by Dave Scheiffler, Andy Robinson,Jon Callas, 
Barry Tannenbaum, myself, and others over the last twelve years.  
(Yeah, I know, you haven\'t heard of any of us, but I still feel I gotta 
say it.)


DESIGN GOALS & APPROACH

The FuRPiG system does not require much mental arithmetic while in 
play.  The cost of this is a little mental arithmetic between sessions
to update character sheets.

FuRPiG uses an open-ended skill set.  It does not use character classes.
It has an objective mechanism for character improvement; the GM does 
not hand out experience points or the equivalents.

FuRPiG is based on Bushido, Runequest, Basic Role Playing/Worlds of Wonder 
and The Fantasy Trip (the GURPS precursor). It owes more to the Chaosium 
games (Basic Role Playing/WoW and RuneQuest) and Bushido than anything else.
I mis-wrote when I said Hero was involved. Steve Jackson and Jim Burrows had
the same goals. He grew TFT up and Jim grew BRP (or westernized Bushido) up.
The results are similar and the differences trace back to which system they
took as the archtype.


ATTRIBUTES

Your attributes determine how quickly you can improve your skills.

FuRPiG uses the following attributes:

Size (SIZ) - mass, at 10 kg per point
Strength (STR) - lifting power at 10 kg per point, in 1g
Endurance (END) - for saving throws and hit points
Speed (SPD) - for reaction time and action rank in combat
Agility (AGL) - for saving throws such as dodges in combat
Intelligence (INT) - for "idea rolls" (GM tips) and "left-brain" smarts
Psyche (PSY) - for "idea rolls", "right-brain" smarts, and psi points
Nerve (NRV) - mental endurance, for saving throws and nerve points
Luck (LUC) - the attribute of last resort
Appearance (APP) - physical attractiveness

That\'s a lot of attributes, but some a mere descriptors (the GM has never 
asked anyone, even our shapeshifting alien, to make a SIZ roll), and many 
are seldom called on.  END, AGL, INT, and PSY are the commonest saving 
throws.  They are also the commonest attributes used in skills.

Average starting attributes are about 10 (for an average human) or 12 
(for a heroic PC human).  There are modifiers for non-human races. 
(SIZ is an exception.  The human average is 8.)


LEARN RATES

Every skill has some attributes (usually two) assigned to it.  These 
determine your "learn rate" in that skill.  The learn rate is the 
average of the attributes, divided by 5.  So typical learn rates are 
2% or 3% on beginning characters.  

Example:

The attributes for Recoilless Pistol are SPD and AGL.  My character 
has SPD 16 and AGL 14.  This averages to 15.  15/5 = 3, so his 
learn rate in Recoilless Pistol is 3%.


USING SKILLS

To use a skill, you roll percentile dice.  If you roll equal to or 
less than the current level, you succeed.

Example:

My character has 85% in Recoilless Pistol.  I roll 53, so I manage
to hit what I\'ve aimed at.


MODIFIERS

The GM can impose modifiers for favorable or unfavorable conditions.

Example:

I\'m trying to shoot at someone while they are in partial cover.
The cover is worth -20%, so my 85% in Pistol is now effectively 65%.
I roll 74%.  I miss, though I would have hit without the modifier.


CRITICAL HITS AND MISSES

If your skill is XY and you roll 0X or lower, this is a "critical hit" 
and something nifty happens.

Examples:

I have 85% in the Brawling skill and roll 06.  I not only hit my opponent, 
he must roll vs. END to avoid being knocked out of action.

I have 85% in Tailoring and roll 06.  I produce a garment worth double
the usual value; or I produce it in half the time.

If your skill is XY and you roll 9X or higher, this is a "critical miss,"
and something awful happens.

Examples:

I have 85% in Brawl and roll 98.  I not only miss my swing, I crack my 
knuckles on the wall behind my opponent and take damage myself.

I have 85% in tailoring and roll 98.  The seams tear open the first time
the customer puts it on; it\'s only good for rags.


LEARN ROLLS

At the end of a session, you make learning rolls against every skill 
you used successfully.  You do this by rolling HIGHER than the current
level and, if you succeed, adding the learn rate.

Example:

I have 85% in Recoilless Pistol and used it successfully in the past 
session.  I make the learn roll and get 91.  My learn rate is 3%.
I now raise my Recoilless Pistol skill to 85 + 3 = 88%.

Note that there is no GM decision needed about "experience."

Note that it is easier to go up when you are a beginner with a low 
skill level, harder when you are an expert.  The actual result is the 
classic "learning curve," topping out at 99%.


TRAINING

To start a new skill, you must train in it.  You can make a learn roll 
for every week you spend at regular lessons.  If you have a teacher who 
is better than you, you use normal learn rates.  If you must train 
yourself or with a partner who is no better, you use your learn rate -1.
If you train with a teacher who is 90+%, you use your learn rate +1.

Example:

My learn rate in Physics is 4%.  I work through the books regularly 
by myself for a week.  If I make my learn roll, I go up 3%.

Next week, I study physics by going to a tutor.  He\'s better than me.
If I make my learn roll, I go up by 4%.

Next week, I switch tutors.  She\'s got physics at 93%.  If I make my 
learn roll, I go up by 5%.


USING ATTRIBUTES

In play, you usually use attributes for saving throws, e.g. dodging 
with AGL in a fight.  The GM determines whether the throw is easy, 
average, or hard.  For an easy save, roll percentile dice against 
5*attribute.  For average, 3*attribute.  For hard, 1*attribute.

Examples:

My AGL is 14.  To duck a punch in the "normal" way, I must roll 3 * AGL, 
or lower.  14 * 3 = 42, so a roll of 24 saves me.

To duck a punch from the rear, I must roll 1 * AGL or lower.  A roll of 
24 gets me a punch in the head.

I keep a small table on my character sheet of each attribute times 1, 3, 
and 5.  In a variant on this rule, I\'ve GMed all attributes at the 3-times
level and added and subtracted modifiers as one does for skills.


IMPROVING ATTRIBUTES

If you use an attribute successfully in a session, you can improve it 
as you would a skill.  All attributes have a learn rate of 1 point.
You make the learn roll by rolling higher than 3*attribute.

Example:

My AGL is 14.  After some fancy dodging in a fight, I can try to raise
it at the end of the session.  3 * 14 is 42.  I roll 67, so I can raise
my AGL to 15.

No attribute can rise higher than double its starting value.  So if 
14 is my starting AGL, it can never go higher than 28.

Not necessarily.  *FFE* could come along and use it.  You see, you are

Are you absolutely sure about this? This sounds very wrong. First of 
all, you can\'t lose copyright. You *can* lose trademarks if you\'re not 
careful, which is why IG/FFE insist on being mentioned, but they don\'t 
automatically get to own something just \'cos it says Traveller on it.

        I suppose it could be a great idea (I applauded the same story when
it was told about Foreven in Imperiallines 1), but, personally, if I
purchase something which charts a Sector, I would prefer to found stats for
the whole Sector. I have refereed CT/MT for years, and found no need for any
blank space in my charts... when I want to develop a new area, I just use my
data on a suitable region. This means my players are in a Parallel Traveller
Universe... so what? Before the arrival of the net it was very difficult to
found CT/MT stuff here (Spain), so I made half a dozen alternate sectors...
a friend of mine is still refereeing an alternate Deneb sector with a few
canon worlds in it, even though now we have an *official* map.
        About the adventurers participating in defining the territory...
well, in the aggregate it could seem that players define it, but if you
leave a specific area blank, there will be a thousand Parallel maps in a
year. If after that IG/FFE (some way) choose one to be the canon, then 999
universes will be non-canon. So, for 999 groups of players, the effect would
be exactly the same as if IG/FFE produced canon stats for the area. I would
prefer to know, from the beginning, there is a canon I can look for if I
want (or ignore).
        As somebody said, no matter how you do it, I will buy it, but
please... whole sector maps look very nice ;-)

Altered the amount of skills, and also flexed the skills somewhat to account
for the new skill list.

As a house rule, I allow all \'non-ranked\' careers (such as entertainer) to
have the same extra skills that Scouts get.  I figure that not giving them
this was an oversight of IG\'s part.  (Add that to your list, Joe.)  Ideally,
I like all careers to get about the same number of skills, just different
skills.  This eliminates the tendency of munchkin players (such as my high
school students) to choose careers based on total number of skills.

        Imagine jumps are affected by some indeterminacy of non-linear
nature, which forces the drives to be more and more complicated for each
level of jump (1 to 6) and that explodes over that... jump-7 and superior
are possible, they are just unpredictable (I think the original rules for
misjumps allowed up to Jump-36, or am I confused?)
        Then, what happens with misjumped ships that do not re-appear. Maybe
they went too far... far and far away from charted space. But hey, the Six
Races have been jumping for Millenia, with all kind of ships... SURE there
are pocket (or not-so-pocket) empires far away in the galaxy... and, with a
little astrography, some of them will know where charted space are... and a
few of them will be launching expeditions to re-contact.
        Just take the Coreward border of charted space (e.g.). imagine you
travel six or seven sectors to Core... (an exploration mission for the
Regency / a Zhodani Core expedition / a misjump): you find Vargr, Hhkar
(ain\'t they funny?), bizarre races... and, suddenly, The Alliance. Starting
from a colony ship which misjumped and contacted by a few other misjumped
crews over the millenia, they built a pocket empire whith all the familiar
races present, but a totally different political framework.. and some
strange technology developments. And they wanna know of their ancient homes!
Looks like an interesting campaign.

True enough, but there was a lot of politics involved, power struggles
between bishops, nobles, etc.  Whether you believe that the will of God came
through is a personal choice, of course.

There\'s a fun little card game called Credo (published by Chaosium) in which
the players take the role of factions within the early church, trying to get
their version of the creed accepted in council.  The three priests I\'ve
shown/played the game with have liked it, but some devout laypeople have
claimed it is sacreligious.  Bob (Rev. Peele if you\'re being formal) figures
that if you are secure in your faith you can enjoy it as just a game; of
course, he also says that all the trickery and politicking are old news to
anyone who has studied at a decent seminary.

I\'ve been tinkering with this \'future religion\' project some more.  I think I
will use the 9 questions out of Runequest as a basis for describing
religions/sects.  That is, I will try to give a description of the religion
from the viewpoint of a believer.  I will also try to include some current
religions, if I can find people willing to write capsule summaries of their
faith for others to read.  More later...

AHA!

The secret is out.  Grandfather is a Hiver.  Who else would be so good at
manipulating?  And what a neat misdirection with the Droyne, too.  

No, that\'s still too obvious.  After all, when manipulation is involved
everyone suspects the Hivers.  But no one would think of suspecting their
non-sentient burrowers (sno? snohl?  something like that).  I figure they are
the real Ancients! :-)

Get a couple of those cheap plastic "My name is..." badges to scavenge the
mounting pins from.  You can also cut the plastic into rectangular strips
and then wrap them in cloth.  Use superglue to mount the cloth to the
plastic, making sure to glue on the underside only so you don\'t discolor
the cloth.  If you go to a sewing specialty store, you can probably find
small pieces of appropriately patterned cloth, ask them for quilting
supplies.  After fastening the cloth, superglue the mounting pin to the
back.

One final note - when someone has multiple ribbons, they are mounted in
rows on a strip - like so

- ----
+ medal1 + medal2 + medal3 +
- ----

as one unit with one mounting pin.

             The 2D Task System
                    v1.1
          A simple task roll system
   compatible with Marc Miller\'s Traveller (T4)

1. Determine base target number (BTN):

    Difficulty Level        BTN
        Impossible           06-
        Staggering           16-
        Formidable           26-
        Difficult            36-
        Average              46-
        Easy                 56-
   
2. Modify the BTN:

   2a.  Each skill level adds 2. 
   2b.  For each characterisic point above/below 7, add/subtract 1. 

3. Roll two dice in succession (a tens dice followed by a ones dice),
providing a two-digit number between 11 and 66.  The task is
successful if the player rolls below the target number.  A roll of
two sixes is a spectacular failure, and two ones is a spectacular
success - even if the target number is below 11. 

Notes:

1) For 0-level skill tests, increase the Difficulty by one level.
2) For Multiple Actions, increase the difficulty two levels for each
extra action.

Does anyone else have problems with the stated rule that on
every jump you roll 2- for a mis-jump?

This means that once every 36 jumps you\'re going to lose 
yourself.  Add to that the fact that the density of stars
in the "canon" universe is about .5/ parsec means that
your ship will jump to an empty parsec about once every
72 jumps.  

Now, your average Free Trader jumps twice a month with 
a month or two off per year for about 20 jumps a year.
This means that on average once every 4 years your 
Free Trader is going to jump into an empty parsec and 
and have no way home.  I don\'t know about the people
on the ships but there\'s no dang way a bank is going 
to give a 40 year loan on something that has a tendency
to vanish after 4 years.

Any one have comments on how they handle this issue?

What do you do if your characters jump into an empty parsec?

Question 2:
When a trader ship mis-jumps (not if, see above), how do
you handle things like freight (due some port off there),
High and Low passengers?

Pretty much anything I\'ve come up with that\'s reasonable as
far as the passengers/shippers is going to break the 
account of a Free Trader.

I\'m asking because Classic and Mega both use a certain amout of fuel per

In the US Navy they are about a quarter of an inch high, and about an inch
wide.  They are three to a row, with any odd number of one or two centered
on the top.  I would recommend fabricating them either with multi-coloured
cloth with thin strips ranging from 1/8th to 1 inch, this would be
difficult I imagine.  The easiest way is to either get your hands on some
real ones, or do them up on the computer, print them out on a colour
printer, and paste them onto a thick piece of cardboard.

  You might consider a permanant black felt-tip marker.  I\'n my time in
uniform, I found one to be an invaluable asset.  If you do it right, it
starts out dark, but will lighten after several washings.

This has always been a "feature" of Traveller, and you\'ll notice that the
standard Classic Traveller starships suffer from the same problem.  Since
your analysis neglected the cost of annual maintainance (a lost month of
revenues, during which salaries and mortgage payments must still be met),
the situation is even worse than you describe.

In at least one published article, Marc Miller mentioned that the
unprofitability of the basic small commercial starships was an intentional
feature, to encourage role-playing and interesting situations.

The Cr 1000 per ton "standard" rate for freight is the rate that large
companies charge their customers.  It\'s set low enough that the independents
can\'t make money hauling freight at this rate, but high enough that a big
company can make money carrying freight in large, efficient ships.

For a PC-owned Free Trader, it\'s just a starting point.  No matter what the
standard rate is, if your ship is the only one it port (and the last ship
was three weeks before that), you can charge whatever the market will bear.

Likewise, armed ships, or ones equipped with fuel purification plants, are
useful when doing trade exploration, or when frequenting locations that
don\'t get ships very often.  Free traders live on this sort of marginal
trade - again, charging all the traffic will bear.

Finally, the referee and the PCs are supposed to be using the trade and
commerce system as a source of adventure ideas and other "hooks" that lead
to interesting encounters.  It\'s not only possible, it\'s pretty easy for a
group of PCs with the right skills to consistently turn a profit using the
trade and commerce system.


The "standard" rates _do_ make sense, if you think about it.  Here\'s why:

I doubt that it\'s an Imperial Rate Commission that sets them; more likely the
"standard" rates are set by the large transport corporations:
megacorporations like Tukera or Imperiallines, sector-based operations like
Al Morai, and even down to multi-subsector-based outfits like Oberlindes Lines.

These companies (and their banks) buy _large_ starships (starting in the
5,000 to 10,000 ton range, and running up into the hundreds of thousands of
tons) for hauling freight.  At these sizes, about 75%
of the ship can be devoted to freight, and the break-even point is with the
hold about 75% full.  To put it another way, if a ship costs 10 to
12 million credits a month to operate (including loan payments), and with a
full cargo hold could produce revenues of around 15 million credits a month.
That\'s a decent return, and (provided that I could convince a bank that I
can keep the hold full) many banks would be happy to write a loan for it.

Will these ships be full?

You bet - they\'ll be well over 90% full.  The majority of the space in the
cargo hold of one of these monsters will be reserved for important customers
who sign long-term contracts to ship large quantities of goods.  These
customers want stable prices, reliable delivery time; Tukera can provide
this (just sign a 10-year contract for a minimum of 1000 displacement tons a
month) at low rates - the "standard rate" of Cr 1000 per displacement ton.

Sixty to nintey percent of the ship\'s cargo hold will be filled with this
contract freight, and it\'s these contracts (as well as the proven ability to
get extensions or additional contracts) that will convince the bank to put
up the money for the starship.

What isn\'t filled by the contracted freight, Tukera\'s (or Al Morai, or
Oberlides) trade department will fill.  The large transport companies employ
agents in every major port - and the job for these people is to fill the
rest of the old with trade goods that their counterparts at the ship\'s
destination can sell for a nice profit.  And you can be assued that the
transport companies can afford to employ good agents.

What does this mean for a free trader?

First of all, all of the companies that regularly need to ship something
have probably got their transportation needs under contract to places like
Tukera.  The only cargoes and freight available to the independents
is "overflow" (for example, excess production that Oberlindes doesn\'t have
space to take this week), small lots, and and shady deals that the major
corporations don\'t want to touch.

Some of this stuff is "rush" business that\'ll pay a premium to get it
shipped _today_ instead of next week or next month when Tukera _can_ take
it.  Some of it isn\'t, and will only want to pay standard rates.

Off of the beaten path, it\'s only the free traders competing amoung
themselves and the subsector-sized lines (outfits that operate a couple to a
couple of dozen ships, almost all under 1000 tons).  The prices here would
be higher, and more volatile, following the laws of supply and demand.

Depends ... if you\'re doing trade exploring (where you can\'t count on
finding someone to trade with, let alone a common medium of exchange and
refined fuel), then the purification plant is invaluable.

Similarly, the weaponry may well be needed to save your life.

> What cost increase should apply?

THis is an opportunity for role-playing.  Have your player characters ask a
price, and justify it with their ship\'s capabilities.  They can (and should)
charge all the market will bear.


Consider the "standard" designs in T4 to be standard exploration and player
character ships, intended to go "into harm\'s way" and/or "where no-one has
gone before (recently, anyway).".  If you want to run a campaign based on
the idea of the PCs being the crew of a profit-making commercial
ship operating in civilized space you can, but (as you correctly point
out), you\'ll need some new ship designs.

While you can\'t build truly large ships with QSDS, the 1000 to 5000 ton
hulls, combined with the 20% discount, make it possible to build a ship that
could be operated at a profit.  If corporate politics and intrigue are your
cup of tea, go for it!  The design goal would be to deliver the largest
amount of cargo hold space for the lowest cost (both in terms of the cost of
the ship, and the crew to run it).

Huh?  Why do you need to break even with such a low utilization; I\'m not
even sure it can be done.  I also don\'t think that (for example) current-day
airlines, steamship lines, or railroads consider that they have to break
even with half-empty trains, planes, or ships.

Sure, why not?  But it\'s a little futile to try to give rules for every
possible combination of options and circumstances.  Some shippers may be
concerned with piracy; others not.  Some may care that a J2 ship can deliver
the goods in half the time as a J1 ship over the same route; some may not.

This is included in the life support charge for the cabins they occupy.  The
"life support" cost is mainly for consumables (ie: food, drink, and air).
Replacement of worn components and other long-term maintainence is handled
during the ship\'s annual maintainance.

> Convoy Escort Fees

These aren\'t "normal" charges, and in a convoy situation where fees are
assesed, this would be handled in the course of role-playing the situation.
The PCs can role-play their meeting with the convoy\'s Commodore, and based
on that, the fee the ship is charged; they can then attempt to pass this
charge on to their own customers.

> Tariffs, Duties, Taxes, and other government fees (avoided when smuggling)

Included in the trade and commerce system if the players are hauling cargo
on their own behalf.  If they are hauling freight (for someone else), these
fees would be paid by the owner of the freight, and not the PCs.

It\'s not a bad role-playing "hook" to have the PCs wind up being responsible
for the fees on a high-ticket piece of freight - perhaps because the owner
is fictitious, or otherwise can\'t be located.

> Delivery charges
> Loading/unloading charges (or, perhaps, heavy equipment rental)

These are included in the trade and commerce system if the players are
hauling cargo on their own behalf.  If they are hauling freight for someone
else, then the owner (the shipper or the consignee) would be responsible for
these.  Sometimes, the ship will have to (or will be talked into) performing
the loading, delivery, and unloading themselves; again, this would have to
be worked out in role-play; presumably the PCs would remember to ask to be
compensated for these services.

All of the consumable items (soap, dishwashing liquid, drinking water,
oxygen, nitrodgen, and other stuff) is included in the life support fee.
The rest (furnture, curtains, plumbing fixtures, etc) is part of the cost of
buying the ship in the first place.  Replacement and wear-and-tear is
covered in the ship\'s annual maintainance cost.

Most of this would be subsumed into the mortgage payment or the subsidy
payment, paid during annual maintainance, or built into the trade and
commerce rules.  This is one area where worlds can differ, and the referee
can really sock unsuspecting PCs with large unexpected charges.  Call it
an adventure hook, and resolve it through role-playing.

I\'ve always imagined that Traveller staterooms were rather like the sleeping
rooms on the railroad, as well.  Traveller staterooms are a bit bigger than
railroad sleeping compartments, but you\'re in them for a week at a time,
instead of a couple or three days.

Sounds about right to me, for the smallest possible ship to play in the "big
leagues"; Tukera and their competitors probably run these on the smaller
feeder branches.  If the megacorps can\'t fill one of these to at least 75%
on a regular basis, then there\'s probably not enough business for them to
take an interest in the market.

Nowhere does it state that the particular PC who recieves the ship benefit
was the original owner; it just states that the PC _now_ owns a ship that\'s
30 years old and has had 3/4ths of the mortgage paid off.

The ship may have changed hands several times - with the bank\'s permission,
the new owner could "assume" (take over making payments on) the original
mortgage (presumably, the purchaser also pays the previous owner some amount
of money for the existing equity in the ship).

You can go ahead and do this, but I\'ve found that having an older ship has
benefits for role-playing, and the way it is written makes considerably more
sense.

Huh?  Why\'d he have to buy it at age 8?  He probably bought it just a few
years ago, from it\'s previous owner.  If our Captain can convince the bank
that he\'s responsible, he\'ll be able to assume the existing mortgage on the
ship, and this will cost only a few tens of thousands of credits (for insurance,
paperwork, "points", and the like), plus whatever the previous owner wants
for her existing equity in the ship (certainly less than the cost of a new
ship *)

* Let\'s take a hypothetical 35Mcr ship - new.  At 30 years old, it\'s useful
lifespan is 3/5ths over (at least according to the Starship blue book); the
ship\'s value is considerably lower than 35MCr - maybe around 14Mcr.  The
original owner - after 30 years of mortgage payments - probably owns
slightly more than half the ship (the rest has gone to the bank in interest,
fees, and other stuff).  So, our captain can (if he\'s acceptable to the
bank\'s loan officer) pick up a used ship for under 8Mcr (the previous
owners more-than-half share of the ship\'s current value, plus assorted
fees).  It\'s 30 years old, but it\'ll also be all paid off in 10 years.
If he tried to do this with a _new_ ship, it\'d cost around twice that, though
his monthly payment would be lower, because the remaining cost would be
spread out over 40 years.

Since a ship\'s nominal useful lifespan is about 50 years (though with care,
ships can be made to last two or three times this long), ships over about 10
years old can\'t be financed.

If you want to, I\'d suggest allowing the PCs to exchange _two_ ship
results for a 1/4 equity share in a new ship, or a single ship result for 10
years worth of payments and 10 years of age on the ship.  Thus, with 4 rolls
your players could own a 40-year-old ship free and clear, or with 8 rolls
(not likely) they could own a new ship free and clear.

You can do that, if you want to drastically improve the profitability of a
standard free trader.  But that wasn\'t the intent of the rules, and I think
it makes slightly less sense - remember, the stock free trader isn\'t
profitable under "standard" rates, so that the PCs will have to do something
interesting and role-playing oriented to turn a profit.

> Makes the whole system much more flexible without putting the players into

As a referee, you probably _want_ them in a deep finanacial hole.  It makes
them so much easier to manipulate.  If you _do_ want them to own the ship
free and clear, design an adventure around it (for example, the Classic
Traveller _Rescue on Ruie_ adventure is designed around just that purpose).

It\'s a lost more interesting to do these things via role-playing than by
rule-playing and giving things to the PCs by the throw of the dice.

Great!  It should require some good role-playing and shrewd decisions to
wind up with a ship free and clear.  The referee needs to work with the PCs
to determine what kind of campaign they\'d like to play, and ensure that
things come out that way, even if it means altering some of the mustering
out benefits, or instituting a system like yours.

Yes - tailoring initial adventures around the acquisiton of a ship is a good
idea, and a great way to get the campaign rolling.

I use a 50 year model for both ships and equipment, and do the same thing.

This was often the case in the 19th century, and still is when you are

Once again, the massive deception campaign institued by Terran cats bears

snatched it right up... then (coincidentally) received email from two 
people in the Dallas area looking for Traveller players.  We\'re meeting 
Monday for the first time and if all goes well, I\'ll be a regular 
Traveller player again.  In the meantime I feel like I\'ve been cramming 
for a test, reading T4 and trying to remember and un-remember how to play 
Traveller.

Anyway... I\'m wanting some help designing new forms and redesigning old 
forms for the game.  I\'ll post WWW address when I get the things finished 
so anyone who wants to can take a look and offer criticism.

Specifically, I\'m breaking the character sheet into *three* seperate 
forms:  1)  A character generation worksheet (used to make the char and 
then discarded - with a step-by-step guide and spaces to make notes along 
the way), 2)  a character sheet (basically the same thing as in T4, but 
redesigned to my own personal preference) and a combat card (3"x5" sheet 
with combat-related stuff, so that I don\'t have to mark on my character 
sheet to keep up with wounds, etc.).  I also like to use check-boxes to 
keep track of hits, ammo and pools.

So... if anyone has any helpful advice now, before I\'ve done much of 
this, I would greatly appreciate it.  It would be easier to implement now 
than later.  Probably I will put everything on the character sheet that 
is on the combat cards, so the sheets should be useful whether you want 
to use the cards or not.

No massive changes, obviously, but minor things.  For example:  providing 
a space for the Base Stat, effective stat (for those modified by wearing 
armor, etc) and using check-boxes to track "current stat" (preferably on 
the combat card rather than the charsheet itself) - as opposed to the 
current "Base Stat, Current Stat" and nothing else.

On the other hand, what are the odds you folks are using as many 
different character sheets as there are subscribers?  No matter, I kinda 
like this forms designing thing.

Go to Joe Heck\'s page, he\'s got a PDF file of the gamma stuff that Greg

 This is indeed what the policy as explained by Joe implies.

 the introduction of Freelance Traveller.

 It sounds a bit too radical a change - I\'m more inclined to
 _cautiously_ assume a misinterpretation, and to pursue
 clarification - as apparently many others do.

 T$R is by far, probably due to name recognition, the largest
 company in the industry.  It would not surprise me if Steve
 Jackson Games were #2 or #3 (I could see WotC, GW, and/or WW
 being larger, but I\'m not sure) - and their policy is almost
 diametrically opposite to T$R\'s.

 Which is my interpretation of the statement that Ken asked be
 placed on this kind of material, and also jives with the "tone"
 of the discussions I (and others, apparently) have had with
 them concerning this kind of material.

 I certainly hope so.  If it turns out _not_ to be an error,
 then Freelance Traveller is going off the air.  Since I cannot
 pay for or receive payment for Freelance Traveller (the latter
 because of the Dragonfire terms of service, the former because
 of the latter - not to mention the very issues at issue with
 respect to IG/FFE), my policy with regards to the rights is
 that _all_ rights to material written by FT submitters remains
 with those submitters - even to the point of pulling material
 (reluctantly) upon request.  I can\'t ethically, even with the
 submitter\'s agreement, deprive them of any rights in their
 intellectual property without some form of reasonable
 compensation.

T::>Just to stick my neck onto the chopping block, here\'s the sort of

 With the exception of the last sentence, this is close to what
 I\'ve used (inconsistently) on FT - typically, I use something
 like "Traveller is a registered....  Use of the trademark or
 associated information is not intended to imply any official
 connection to FFE or IG, or any licensee."  Now that you point
 it out, I should probably add the author\'s copyright, and just
 as a matter of common sense, I should probably standardize the
 disclaimer.

I\'m glad to learn that we share the same philosophy on this issue. As
you may know, it was only two years ago that TSR began telling ftp-sites
around the world to delete their archives of fan-authored, AD&D-
compatible material. Quite a few of my own donations got demolished in
those purges (about 500-600 pages of an online magazine I used to edit),
so if I seem rather persistent about this issue, it\'s only because
getting burned once has left an indelible impression, not to mention a
bitter taste for RPG companies in general and TSR in particular. Since
Imperium games seems to have more than its fair share of ex-TSR employees,
I was naturally interested to learn your copyright policy.

Speaking of ex-TSR employees, I\'m have to admit that I\'m rather confused
by some of Ken Whitman\'s statements on this issue which appear, at first
glance, to conflict with your own statements above. Perhaps you can shed
some light on this matter. This is an excerpt of a recent conversation
between Joe Walsh and Ken Whitman.

Joe: "What is IG\'s copyright policy vis a vis TML/Web/UseNET-published 
materials for traveller, regarding: 1) original works, and 2) copyrighted 
works."

Ken:  "What do you mean by original works?"

Joe:  "Stuff that people make up on their own, like new equipment, new 
rules, etc."

Ken:  "Well, as long as they put \'Traveller is a registered trademark of 
FarFuture Enterprises.  Copyright (c) 1996\' in there, there\'s no problem."

Joe:  "So that means that, technically, all such works are the property 
of FFE...?"

Ken:  "Yeah.  We\'ve been lax in our enforcement of this requirement, but 
we really have to be more careful.  FFE could lose its Trademark.  But, 
we don\'t want to anger the fans."

My 1st question:

Did Ken Whitman really mean to indicate here that any time a Traveller-
fan writes some form of original but Traveller-compatible work (adventure,
rules supplement, world description, character write-up, etc), that the
individual in question must include a statement that transfers ownership
of their original work to FFE? And if this is what he really meant to
say, is this something that you agree with?

I can understand acknowledging the Traveller trademark and FFE\'s
copyrights, but this statement by Ken Whitman seems, in my mind, to go
too far. After I first heard about it, I suggested on the TML what I
thought was a reasonable alternative statement... one which would
protect FFE quite well but which would also allow the individual authors
to maintain ownership over their own work. Here is my suggested
statement once again:

  "Traveller is a registered trademark of FarFuture Enterprises (FFE).
  Use of this trademark or of any material copyrighted by FFE is not
  to be interpreted as a claim on such material. This work is to be
  considered "unofficial" and FFE cannot be held liable for damages,
  material or otherwise, resulting from its use. This work is
  copyright 1996 (author\'s name). All rights reserved, except that
  FFE may draw on this work in any fashion they deem appropriate."

This reason I include the last sentence is just for IG\'s own protection,
as it is possible that by pure coincidence, IG might publish something
fairly similar to something a fan writes, and this line would protect
them from the fan suing (not that I could envision this ever happening,
but it pays to cover your aft-quarters every now and then). Of course,
the fan would have to rely on IG\'s sense of "rightness" to not publish
their work wholesale without compensation, but I don\'t see this as a
problem. Some people (like myself) might not even want compensation,
and might amend the last sentence to read: "All rights reserved, except
that FFE is invited to draw on this work or even republish it without
requesting permission."

My 2nd question:

Do you have a problem with this disclaimer? If so, what\'s the matter
with it? I don\'t want to be pushy here. If all you require is that
people acknowledge your trademarks and copyrights, that\'s fine. I\'m
just trying to suggest a little something extra so that you\'ll be
better protected, but I\'m not a lawyer, so what do I know?

Oh, and a 3rd question, since I\'m on a roll:

Can we include official sector data in starmapping freeware? I\'m
assuming the answer is yes, but I want to make absolutely sure
that it\'s okay with you.

Nothing.  The last stuff isn\'t even necessary.  As I explained in the

Dear Traveller Afficionados and TML\'ers,
 
It  has  never  been  the  intention  of  MM  or  DGP to create a
situation in which background for the game was barred from future
reference in the game.
 
That is, DGP was given an  open hand to draw upon GDW\'s Traveller
materials, and in return gave MM and his associates equal freedom
to design new Traveller game  materials based upon the background
presented in  DGP\'s works. DGP  entered into this  agreement with
the  full  awareness  that  Marc\'s  rights  of  derivation  would
continue even  after DGP\'s right  to publish game  material under
the  Traveller trademark  expired.
 
Of  course,  the  scope  of  the  agreement  was  limited  to the
publication  of  materials  for  the  Traveller role-playing game
market. Any use of DGP\'s materials outside that market by Marc or
his associates would require a new agreement with DGP.
 
 
Under this  arrangement, once something  integral to the  setting
was created  -- such as  a key person  (the Emperor, a  planetary
leader, the head of a  major regional corporation, etc.), a piece
of equipment, a class of ships, a planet (or culture, government,
or organization),  etc. -- these  things could be  represented in
new game works because they comprised the background of the game,
that  is, they  DEFINED THE  MILIEU. The  text and  illustrations
themselves could  not be reprinted,  but any idea  that fell into
the category of "background" could  be drawn upon in the creation
of new Traveller game products.
 
The notable  exception to the reprint  restriction concerns data.
Most  of  the  data  presented  in  the  game  consists  of  pure
background,  and can\'t  be presented   in any  other way  than by
reprinting it  verbatim. Planet names, UWP\'s,  sector data lists,
ship  class  names,  ship  statistics,  and  other  data  can  be
reprinted directly in new Traveller  game products (by Marc or by
whomever he designates).
 
The  copyright  limitations  mostly  concern  foreground.  Player
characters, adventures, NPCs  insignificant to the superstructure
of  the milieu,  their personal  activities, specific encounters,
etc. Even though  these persons and events could  be mentioned in
passing,  neither MM  nor DGP  would ever  consider reworking  an
adventure  done  by  the  other,  or  making  use  of  their star
characters, without getting permission first.
 
As you can see, the distinction between foreground and background
material  is highly  subjective, and  relies upon  the trust  and
goodwill between  the parties involved.  For instance, throw-away
references  were  often  picked  up  and  fleshed  out in greater
detail, even some that could be identified as "foreground".
 
One  thing you  need to  understand about  Marc is  that he takes
pride in being the creator and leader of Traveller, and we at DGP
have always found him to be a fair and honorable ruler. You don\'t
have  anything  to  worry  about.  Marc\'s  main  concern  is  the
happiness of his customers and followers.
 
We at  DGP are very  happy that Marc  is in control  of Traveller
once again, and we feel that it is a position he truly deserves.
 
Sincerely,
 
Roger Sanger

My personal take on this (gotta come up with a way to indicate whether I 
am speaking as IG\'s rep or not) is:

On the one hand, my view on many different types of products (RPGs, 
computers, computer programs, etc.) is that the option which provides the 
most flexibility should be provided.  So, usually, I would agree that 
there should be an "official" set of sector data for ALL areas of the 
Traveller setting.  Those who want to use them can do so.  Those who 
don\'t can make up their own stuff.  Maximum flexibility.

However, in this case, I\'m beginning to get the impression that a lot of 
folks (not necessarily TMLers) will allow Official Data to restrict their 
creativity.  It becomes "canon," even if they don\'t know the term. [G]

So, if I assume that this will be handled intelligently (that sectors to 
be developed officially will be clearly marked, etc.), I think the "blank 
sector data" method will be best.

Besides, I bet there will be folks who will put a lot of effort into 
developing certain regions of space, then release those online (esp. now 
that they know IG won\'t come along and publish the result of their hard 
work w/o their permission[G]) for all of us to use.  No, this doesn\'t 
resolve the "canon"/shared universe problem that some have brought up, 
but it\'s something to think about. :)

Once upon a time, my group would have thought it was funny - we would 
have enjoyed it.  Later on, we would have figured the game designer(s) 
ran out of ideas, and denigrated them and their paltry efforts.  
Perhaps interestingly, these days we would once again find it funny. :)  
Getting older and milder, I guess. [G]

:)  I\'ve not run into this (sounds like the stuff you are referencing is 
either from MT or TNE - I\'m not familiar with most of that stuff) with 
Traveler, but I certainly used my share of familiar places in other 
games, most especially Champions.  I lived in Antioch, CA, and that city 
became the setting for a Champions game, AND a Shadowrun game, both at 
the same time (I alternated GMing those games, one one week, one the 
next, for a while), but in different eras, if you see what I mean.

Now that you mention it, though, it might be fun to draw up a map of 
stars for Traveller which corresponds to the layout of cities around 
here, and name the main worlds accordingly.  Might not be fun for the 
long run (but you never know), but it would be a nice novelty.

Thanks for the nice thought.

Dunno how helpful this will be, but I just never roll for that unless the 
characters haven\'t been keeping up on maintenance, jump from less than 
100 diameters out, or otherwise screw up. :)  

And, to tell the truth, a mis-jump has only occurred once.  I used it to 
put them into a situation where there was no gas giant in the system, no 
starport, and the world was filled with hostile natives.  No fuel, and 
they had to go through hell to get it.  

Never dumped them into an empty parsec, though.

Never had the passenger issue come up, but they did have some freight to 
deliver.  They had to explain it REAL good to the person expecting the 
freight, as in the end they traded the stuff in the shipment to a group 
of natives, to win their cooperation in allowing the ship to re-fuel.

[Putting my offical IG Answer Man hat on...[G]]

I asked Ken about this last Friday, and he said that IG is happy with the 
task system they\'ve published, but they certainly don\'t mind it when 
individuals come up with their own task systems.  IG has produced 
something that gives the "feel" they want T4 to have, in terms of what 
they produce (but not necessarily the "feel" of the individual games 
played all fans).  

IG\'s take on such issues is that they produce "guidelines," not Gaming 
Law. [G]   It\'s not just, "If you don\'t like it, change it," it\'s more 
like, "We encourage you to change everything you don\'t like.  We aren\'t 
gods, and we will never be able to produce a product that is perfect for 
everyone.  Please, please don\'t treat our products as if they were 
written with God\'s Own Hand." :)

In short, they\'re proud of the systems they\'ve come up with, but not so 
proud as to even _consider_ discouraging others from changing them for 
their own campaigns.

try to be as concise and unambiguous as possible.  Nevertheless, I\'m not

IG Copyright Policy

If you produce an original work for use with Traveller, you are the 
copyright holder (see copyright law for details).  You own that original 
work.

However, IG and FFE ask that you put the trademark notice on that 
original work.  This is done in order to protect their trademark.  

If you want to distribute that work for free, that\'s where it ends.  No 
more rules or provisions.  Create your original work, put the trademark 
notice on it, and you own it.  It\'s all legal-like[G].

If, however, you want to make money from that work, you will have to get 
in contact with IG, get a Letter of Permission or a License, and do all 
that is involved in such contracts (for details, contact Imperium 
Games).  Alternatively, you can get in touch with Gold Rush Games, Sword 
of the Knight Publications, or any other Officially Licensed publisher of 
Traveller material (I don\'t know of any others at this point, but that 
doesn\'t mean there aren\'t any others).  These folks can legally publish 
your work since they are Licensees.  See these companies for details on 
getting your work published with them.

Finally, if IG wishes to take your work and publish it, they must 
first come to an agrement with you, since it is your work.


I hope that clears everything up.  I\'m sorry for the confusion caused by 
my earlier posting.  Please forgive me.  I am new to this job (been at it 
7 days now, in fact), so I\'m bound to make mistakes. :(

I\'ll do better next time.

	I have designed a Tl:A yacht capable of two consecutive
	jumps. I think its common practice for TL:9-A ships.

	This the main think I dislike in T4 ship design. With FFS its
	probately better to install a big jump drive for fuel efficenty.

	Two 1 parsec jumps with a jump 1 drive need 20% fuel,
	while a jump 2 drive would need only 15% fuel using FFS.
	FFS forces to use better technology if available the 
	drive + fuel percentage decrease per jump level :

		jump 1 drive : 12% per parsec
		     2          9%
		     3          8%
		     4          7.5%
		     5          7.2%

		     j1     j2     j3     j4     j5
		jd1 12.000 
		jd2 11.500 19.000 
		jd3 12.667 16.000 26.000
		jd4 14.250 16.333 20.500 33.000 
		jd5 16.000 17.500 20.000 25.000 40.000 
		jd6 17.833 19.000 20.750 23.667 29.500 47.000 

	So if the ship is build for jump 1 is at best has an j2 drive,
	if it should make a j3 most times it should have a jd5 drive.

	Look at my 600dt tl:D liner, it has a jump 4 drive and
	25% fuel, so it wouldnt have any drop fuel for manouever
	left if it makes a 4 parsec jump. But is has 6 40dt 
	cargo hatches equipped with colapsible tanks, so it could
	make two j4 have 16 hours of thrust and has still one cargo
	hatch for "air mail".

	The Gushemege scout has 100dt tl:F, jump 5, 12 ghours
	and an other jump 5 in a colapsible tank.

GOOD stuff! For barroom scenes, I like the music from the _Bubblegum Crisis_ (good if 
the bar has a house band; assume the singers on the BGC track are singing in a local 
dialect or Vilani).

For military encounters in a mercenary Trav game, I like the soundtrack to the computer 
game _Command and Conquer_. I\'d buy an album of music like this, if I can find it!

I also like the "Top Gun" soundtrack for military fun \'n\' games. The _Conan_ soundtrack 
is good for those lo-tech fun times, too.

Well, like to engage in activities likely to result in the accumulation of small slips 
of green paper that can be traded for food, clothing, shelter and Traveller books (not

 . . . and the Hivers are laughing like hyenas (okay, twitching like a overcaffienated 
five-year old, same thing) at the gullibility of humaniti to manipulation. Zhos are 
about as manipulative as sheep. Hivers use manipulation the same way we humans use

	An Aslan with an Honor Grudge

VERY BAD idea . . . unless you KNOW what the ribbons are awarded for! If *I* saw someone 
wearing US military ribbons, _especially those awarded for valor_, even on a sf con 
costume, I just might ask the individual if s/he was entitled to wear those ribbons. 
<This is one of my pet peeves: military poseurs wearing insignia they didn\'t earn 
when men and women fought and bled for the decoration> I\'d be less concerned about 
wearing some commendation ribbon or another, but I\'m going to be **pissed** if I ever 
see someone wearing a CMoH or Purple Heart ribbon and I find out the individual didn\'t 
earn \'em.

Might work. Or use the approach the costumer did in SW: make the ribbons recognizable as 
military awards, but totally unrelated to any "real" award.

Scouts are, above else, _practical_. Rebels, nonconformists, disbelievers in authority 
granted by rank, but ruthlessly practical.

You just wanted to have a ship named after you -- _Starburst_ class CLs were named for 
SEH recipients;)

I certainly miss decorations! I wrote an article and sent it to TTC awhile back with 
awards for the RC and Regency (for TNE) -- I\'ve heard _nothing_ from Sword of the Knight 
about it -- and I\'d like to do another one on Milleu Zero Sylean/Imperial decorations 
for JTAS.

I\'m starting to even doubt in the existence of IG now :-#)  The books
must be stuck in the continuous snow storm that separates our country
from theirs.  Everyday my wife gets out of the igloo, uses the snowshoes
to walk to the sleigh then rides to the log town of Ottawa to check at
the local mountie outpost.  No book from the USA yet.  I keep hoping...

email addresses.  This is generally only done if it is deemed that an 
answer to the question will benefit the whole group.  In short, though, 
no such communications should be considered private.
    Finally, if you have questions that are business-related (i.e., you 
want to get a License to publish Traveller items, or a Letter of 
Permission, or you want to check on your specific order, or you want to 
place an order), contact Imperium Games.  They can be contacted at:
       Imperium Games, Inc.
       P.O. Box 481
       Lake Geneva, WI 53147
       Phone: 1-414-249-9430
       Fax: 1-414-249-9456
       Web Site:  http://www.imperiumgames.com


Q.  From where do you get your answers?

A.  Some answers come from our own information and knowledge of the 
Traveller game, while others come from the folks at Imperium Games.  


Q.  What is the scope of CSC?

A.  CSC will have a huge amount of equipment, as well as a very robust 
small craft design system.  CSC\'s focus is on equipment available in 
Milieu 0.


Q.  What about equipment for subsequent Milieux?

A.  New equipment will be published for subsequent Milieux when each 
Milieu book is published.  At this point, it is unknown whether that will 
take the form of a section of each Milieu book, a separate CSC-type 
book, or be some combination depending on the Milieu in question.


Q.  Will the next printing of T4 have new artwork?

A.  The next printing of T4 will simply have errata noes in the back of the 
book.  The printing after that will be version 1.1, and will simply have the 
errors corrected (but will have the same artwork).  At least, that is the 
plan at this point.


Q.  What is IG\'s copyright policy in regards to original works posted to 
the Traveller Mailing List, WWW sites, and/or Usenet?

A.  Just include "Traveller is a Registered Trademark of FarFuture 
Enterprises.  [copyright symbol] 1996" in the document, and IG will be fine 
with it, so long as you don\'t sell you work (or make money off of it in 
any way) - see below.


Q.  If I make an original work for Traveller, who owns it?

A.  You do.  But, you cannot make money off of it without doing one of 
the following:

    1)  Get a Letter of Permission (call or write to IG for details)
    2)  Become a Licensee (call or write to IG for details)
    3)  Have a Licensee publish your work (call or write IG for details)


Q.  Is there any way around this?

A.  Yes.  Don\'t mention Traveller in your article, and don\'t pull 
material from any Traveller product.  Say it is an article for use with 
science fiction RPG\'s, and keep it generic.


Q.  Can IG or FFE publish my original Traveller work without my permission?

A.  No.  They cannot take your original work and publish it without first 
getting your permission.


Q.  What is the policy regarding copying previously published works by 
GDW to the internet (or elsewhere)?

A.  You have to get written permission from Marc Miller 
(FarFuture@aol.com) in order to legally do so.  He holds all the 
copyrights on all such material.


Q.  When will [insert product here] be shipped?

A.  The correct schedule for products to be shipped (that is, when they
will begin to be shipped to dealers and those who ordered directly through
IG) is:

        Starships                       November 15
        JTAS                            November 15
        Citizens of the Imperium        November 15
        Aliens Archive                  November 15
        Central Supply Catalog          December 1
        Milieu 0                        December 15
        First Survey                    December 15


Q.  How often is IG\'s web site going to be updated?

A.  IG plans to update the web site on a bi-weekly basis until further 
notice.  Their website\'s URL is: http://www.imperiumgames.com


Q.  When is my T4 hardback going to arrive? 

A.  It depends.
All Orders:  The hardbacks were shipped in the same sequence in which 
orders were received.  As of October 18, all the hardbacks should be 
either in the mail or at their destinations.  IG wants to express their 
sincere thanks for the great patience everyone has shown in waiting for 
their orders to be filled.

U.S. Orders:  Some were shipped via Priority Mail, while others were 
shipped via 4th Class Mail, depending on the date on which the order was 
placed.  For details of when your specific order was shipped, please call 
or write to Imperium Games.

Foreign Orders:  Foreign orders will take longer to arrive than orders 
shipped to the continental U.S. 


Q.  I really don\'t like [insert a rule from T4 here] . . .

A.  If you don\'t like something about any IG product, feel free to change
it!  The folks at IG realize they aren\'t gods, and are therefore unable
to create the perfect system for everyone.  Their philosophy is that they
are producing _guidelines_, not laws carved in stone.


Q.  My local game store doesn\'t carry Traveller products.  (Or, "There
aren\'t any Traveller players in my area.")

A.  Ask the owner of your friendly local game store if you can run a 
demo of the Traveller game.  If s/he will let you do so, some ideas 
for what to do include:
        1)  Run through some _extremely simple_ scenarios with 
            prospective customers.  These might be simply hitting
            a target - give them a character, a situation, a little
            build up, and a number to roll.  Act out the consequences.
        2)  Get a few members of your gaming group together, and play
            at the store, if they\'ll allow it and have an area where
            customers can stop by and watch you play.
        3)  Your own ideas

        The point is, demand drives supply.  If you would like to see a 
supply of Traveller products at your local game store, help to create the 
demand and let the game store owner know that demand exists.  If you can 
stir up enough demand among the gaming community in your area, the game 
store owner will almost certainly begin carrying lots of Traveller products.
        Plus, you you may end up making some new gaming friends! :)


Q.  Where do I send questions regarding IG and/or Traveller?

A.  It depends.  If it is a business-related question (such as license 
fees or distributor information), it should be addressed directly to 
Imperium Games (1-414-249-9430).  
    Other questions, such as those regarding what is meant by a given 
rule in an Imperium Games product, when a given supplement is due out, 
theory behind the technology used in the Traveller game (jump drives, 
sensors, starships, etc.), or other such questions, they should be 
addressed to either the TML (preferred) or to me personally 
(ransom@iconnect.net).
    But please be aware that any emailed question may be re-posted 
publicly, if I feel my reply should be made public to avoid duplication.  
I reserve the right to re-post any email sent to me regarding IG and/or 
Traveller.
    Please also be aware that messages posted to TML may not be answered 
unless it is made evident that an "official" answer is requested.
    Finally, at times it will be necessary for me to share questions with 
those who know more than I do about specific topics (i.e., a question about 
product release dates will be posed to someone at IG).  
    In other words, such communications are NOT considered private.

Attentive readers will have noted a change in the release/shipment dates 
for JTAS #25 and Starships, either in the FAQ or on IG\'s web site.  You 
may wonder why this is the case.  The short answer:  Stuff happens. :(

Essentially, the dates IG provides for release of products are based on the 
situation as it stands at the time those release dates are provided.  

Thereafter, unforseen situations can arise which cause the dates to be 
moved back.  IG sincerely regrets pushing such dates back, but at times 
it is unavoidable.  

Please be patient, and know that we are providing the most current 
information to you at all times.


Thanks!

I\'m using a Confederate Army general\'s jacket pattern as a base.  This
already has shoulder boards and a high collar.  I\'m going to order some East
German officer\'s boots and probably use German dress trousers.

US ribbons are actually pins, using standard pin backs.  There are bars for
rows of ribbons, you slide the ribbon off it\'s backing and onto the larger
one.  Just as an aside, It looks best in groups of 3 or 4 across, on the
left chest above the breast pocket.  As for getting them, try a surplus
store in your area.. you might want to specify that you want non-US and
non-combat awards only, some veterans get pretty upset when they see someone
wearing a Silver Star as part of a costume.

For an alternate idea, get a book of German uniforms during WWII.. they may
have been evil, but boy could they dress!  The SS in particular had smart
looking uniforms, and you might get alternate ideas about decorations.

Peter,

Just in case you missed it in the FAQ, there will be updates and/or 
similar guides for future Milieux.  In other words, they aren\'t sure. :)

Hi Daniel,

I\'ll try to help.  IG still had about 500 hardbacks to ship as of 
Monday.  They plan to have them all shipped by Friday.  Yours may be 
among them (depending on when you placed your order).

If you want to check on your specific order, either give IG a call or 
write to them.  Their address and phone number are in the FAQ I posted 
recently.


Best wishes,

I most certainyl would.  I found it one of the most interesting things I\'ve
read for Traveller, and would love to see more.  Also, in case you didn\'t
know Mike, it\'s on my web page too :)

(cause it\'s on yours or whatever) just tell me.

This isn\'t actually as unusual as it sounds.  In the USA, where different
places were settled by people from all over the world, we have a wide
variety of \'re-used\' place names: there is, for example, Moscow, Berlin,
Essex, Cambridge, Oxford, and Salisbury - all in the state of Maryland (and
towns with the same name in many other states, as well).  These are mingled
with native place-names, like Chesapeake, Potomac, and Susquehana.

Given that Solomani administrators were dispatched througout the Vilani
empire during the Rule of Man (Second Imperium, or Ramshackle Empire,
depending on how your loyalties lie), it\'s suprising that there aren\'t more
worlds with Solomani names.

>         Btw, have other countries\' maps been also used?

Certainly.  I have personally used railroad maps of Colorado (USA) and
Canada as a source of world names when generating Traveller subsectors;
therefore causing names like "Kamloops", "Skeena", and "Telluride" to be
given to planets.

: 
: A.  It depends.
: All Orders:  The hardbacks were shipped in the same sequence in which

: either in the mail or at their destinations.  IG wants to express their

Okay, just a little venting here.  The above is a crock of shit!  I
don\'t think that they were shipped in any order.

How do I know.  Well, if they were shipped in the order that they were
placed, then mine would\'ve been the *first* yes, I said *first* one
shipped.  I literally placed my order two minutes after the homepage was
changed and the offer was added!!!.  Hell, I called and Shirley told me
I was the first customer of their entire operation.

So, if mine was sent out *first*, then why was it postmarked Oct 7th
which as we all know is two weeks after a whole slew of other people
received them?

I\'ll be honest, take the above with a grain of salt.  I\'m a patient man,

        I think there\'s actually a law against wearing the Congressional
Medal of Honor if you haven\'t earned it.

Footnote for non-US readers: the Congressional Medal of Honor is the highest
military decoration in the US, so named because it requires an act of
congress to award it. You won\'t see many people wearing it because the
actions that earn it usually kill the person.

Gee.  I wish someone would mark the land-mines for me; I keep stepping in

Uhmmm...would it help if it said, "In *roughly* the same sequence in 
which the orders were received?" :)

I imagine it would have been done thusly (though I don\'t know):  First, 
get all the signed hardbacks out(?), Second, get the rest of the 
pre-gen-con orders out, third, get the Gen-Con and post-gen-con orders 
out.  In each of these break-points, the individual books didn\'t go out 
in chronological order, but the break-points/groups were done in 
chronological order.

While I am almost certainly wrong about the break-points, I can imagine 
there being such break-points.  In general, earlier orders went out 
sooner than later orders.  In specific, though, that is less true.

Make sense?  (Dunno if I\'m stating this clearly - I\'m sleepy) It\'s total 
speculation on my part, but I really doubt Ken was lying about getting 
them out in an order based on when the orders were placed.

Well, seeing as Harlem is a city in the Netherlands, and New York was named
after York (in England), what\'s so strange about that?

Settlers have a tendency to name places after where they came from.  I\'d
expect Murcia was settled (or conquered) by people from Murcia.  You could
even name many of teh important cities after cities and towns in the real
province.

I\'ve had a couple.  There\'s also been a _lot_ of bandwidth lately, which may
have crashed my mail server last week.  (That is, the server crashed because
of full mailboxes, and mine had 2+ megabytes of TML digests which had arrived
in a couple of days.)

So, a request to everyone: PLEASE don\'t quote huge amounts of someone\'s
message, just to say "I agree" or "I disagree".  In a couple of recent
digests over 1/3 of the bandwidth has been quotes of previous messages.  If
we have another of these crashes I could lose my Internet email access (which
I use for more than just TML).

I beleive I saw a 20/20 or Sixty Minutes that said it was a federal 
offence to wear or claim you had earned a CMH when you had not...

I think this same article said there were only a handful of people still 
alive who had earned the CMH.

"The T4 Multiple Actions rule will not work in this system. A new rule is
needed: when attempting multiple actions, do not reduce the stat mods.
Instead, increase the difficulty two levels for each extra action (-2 to
the first digit of the target number). Thus, for a character with stat of 7
and skill of 6, the target number for a single Difficult action is 56-; for
two such actions, 36-; for three, 16-. (Obviously, this rule does not allow
characters to perform as many extra actions as the original rule.) [I would
be interested to hear suggestions for a better formulation of this rule.]"

Hmm, IMHO its quite improbable, that they all misjump to the same place, 
BUT --
You can try to put it that way. There is a somewhat strange astrophysical 
phenomenon (kinda space-time-distortion or so, produced by a big 
gravitation-source), which is never located at the same place, but 
appeares here and there, now and then. It could influence every jump, 
which is processed in its region, in the same way, redirecting them to 
the same time and space (I know, a little bit like a wormhole, but not 
that local, and with a bigger region of influence)

Does this sound more convenient?

I can\'t figure out the ....bund part.  It might indicate government or
home, but one thing is sure, it\'s a German phrase.

There are a couple of non-official things you can do; after all, flexability
is one of the hallmarks of Traveller - if you don\'t like things, change
them.  I have successfully used both of the following in my campaigns:

1) Allow Engineering skill as a favorable DM to avoid misjump.  This way,
   a ship that has a qualified Engineer (skill level 1 or better) will
   never misjump unless it\'s mistreated (by using unrefined fuel, or by
   trying to jump too close to a planet).  The main drawback of this is that
   truly skilled chief engineers can keep the ship going with virtually no
   chance of misjump, even when doing things that _ought_ to cause them.

2) Allow the Engineer a "saving throw" to avoid the misjump - by aborting
   the jump sequence, or some other last-minute act of desperation.  In
   general, I allow a successful throw to avoid the misjump, but the jump
   drive is then damaged and inoperable until it\'s repaired (more work for 
   the engineer).

Imposing randomly-generated disasters on the PCs with no saving throw and no
direct influence from the players doesn\'t really contribute to the
role-playing.  Use the die rolls to prime your imagination, and set up a
scenario where the characters can (try) to avoid their fate or deal with it.
If I\'m going to arbitrarily have their ship misjump for No Good Reason, I
prefer to do it in a time and place that advances my plotline.

> What do you do if your characters jump into an empty parsec?

In general, I dislike shipping players off to their doom simply by random
die rolling.  If you\'re ready to add this to your campaign\'s storyline, and
if the PCs have the things they need to deal (see below) with the problem,
then go for it.  If you don\'t want to do this, or if they\'re not equipped to
survive it (and you don\'t want to kill them all off), then just fudge the
die roll and send them to a nonfatal but inconvenient world ... on the
other side of the sector.

To survive a misjump into empty space, you\'ve almost _got_ to have enough
low berths for everyone, as well as a working sublight drive on the starship,
a working power plant, and enough fuel remaining in the tanks to run the power
plant at full power for a three to six months, plus minimum power (enough to
run the low berths, computer, and nothing else) for a few decades.

The general plan would be to locate the ship and program a course to a
nearby system where fuel and/or repairs are available.  Even so, the trip
will take quite a while (beyond the ship\'s emergency life-support reseves),
so everyone will have to go into the low berths and trust the computer to
handle the navigation (one option would be to have the computer wake someone
periodically to check over the ship and course).  As the ship is
decelerating, it could then wake the crew and passengers.  Assuming that
everyone survived the low berth experience, there would still be the matter
of getting the ship repaired and refuelled, and than there\'s the large
amount of time that\'s passed while the PCs were in cold storage.

Other solutions are, of course, possible; and (presuming you want the
campaign to continue), I\'d probably allow just about anything that sounded
plausible, and see what the players came up with.  Transmitting a radio
message and then going into low berths might work, and rigging some kind of
ramscoop system to collect hydrogen to fuel the drive would be a
possibility.

If you don\'t want to break the characters, it _might_ be reasonable to
assume that the cost of the damages is covered by the ship\'s insurance
policy - if the PCs can prove that the misjump wasn\'t caused by their own
negligence.

It\'s on it\'s way.  There\'s a more advanced system by Dave Golden, the
"Standard Starship Design System" that\'ll be in the Starships book.  Dave
and the rest of us are currently working on the "ultimate" system,
(currently called the Naval Architect\'s Handbook) that\'ll allow you just
about any option imaginable.

Right. 

If you weren\'t using the full power output of the plant, you could throttle
it back and use less fuel.  Since the fuel consumption listed in QSDS is to
run the plant at full output for six months, the savings usually isn\'t worth
keeping track of.

If you\'ve misjumped into the middle of nowhere, and have to figure out how
to make six months worth of fuel last a few decades, then it might be
important.

In Classic Traveller, it was stated that the amount of fuel required was
"negligable", and I don\'t recall that anyone ever bothered to keep track of
it.  The power required was an important component of a High Guard ship
design, though.  In MegaTraveller, the maneuver drives didn\'t use fuel,
just electricity (just like T4); however MegaTraveller power plants required
truly enormous amounts of fuel for the power generated, so keeping track of
the power usage and fuel consumption was important.

Some T4 drives do use fuel - the HEPlaR drive (familiar to everyone who
played Traveller: The New Era) is still in T4, and HEPlaR ships can be built
with QSDS.  If you don\'t want thruster plates in your campaign, you can
just build HEPlaR ships.  In Milleu 0, most planets with a TL high enough to
build Thrusters don\'t bother with HEPlaR anymore.

Have you compared characters generated under T4 to those generated under the CT/MT 1 yr. 
method for scouts, mercenaries, merchants, and naval personnel?  I have, and they come 
out very close to characters generated under T4.

Those systems had the education options, and MT/TNE provided background skills.  As a 
matter of fact, I converted characters in my campagin so they would be compatible with 
T4 generated characters.  All of the characters generated under the CT/MT 1 year method 
needed little conversion.  All of the characters generated under the CT/MT 4 year method 
needed a lot of conversion--they were very shy on skills.

I have always not liked the difference in characters produced by the two methods in CT 
and MT.  If you generated a scout, merchant, mercenary, or naval character, you could 
end up with a good, multi-skilled character.  If you wanted to be a noble, belter, law 
enforcer, etc., and you used the 4 year method, your character would not be near as 
good.

I still contend that the increase in skills under the 4 year method in T4 was designed 
to make these character classes more compatible with those generated under the 1 year 
method.  As I said in my last post, I\'d like to see a supplement that has a number of 
character classes generated using the 1 year method.

Point well taken.  I keep saying that I want to spend a lot of time with this task fix 
to ensure that we come up with a good system.  

The average PC, Ulric Harrisani, was generated using the MT merchant 1 year merchant 
rules.  He is a graduate of the Mora Merchant Academy, and has 12 years experience under 
his belt.  The interesting thing is, when I did the conversion to T4, he was not that 
deficient in skills.  I counted his skill levels and compared that to what he would have 
had if he would have been generated under the T4 system.  I was careful to include 
background skills and merchant academy benefits.  You know what?  Ulric was only 3 skill 
levels shy that if he was created in T4.  I\'d consider that pretty close, and this is 
another reason why I believe that the skills are still weighted the same as in CT/MT.

There has been no word from IG because nobody has contacted them yet.  Joe Walsh 
mentioned in one of his posts that he spoke with Ken Whitmant about it, but Ken gave 
a brush off answer saying that IG publishes rule guidelines.  As referees, we can all 
change the system to fit our needs.  This is all how it should be, but I think that 
there should be an official fix to the problems in the T4 task system.  

My goal is to come up with a good system that, at the minimum, we can use in our 
campaigns.  After it gets hacked out here on the TML, and we get all the bugs worked 
out, I plan on sending a copy to IG in the hopes that it will be published as an 
optional rule in some supplement down the road.

Look at CT, for instance.  They had the range based combat system in Book.  Then, 
Snapshot was published to improve on those rules and add more detail.  A year later, 
Azhanti High Lightning was published wich improved the Snapshot rules.  I\'m hoping that 
a rules fix to the T4 task system can be implemented somewhere with some of its future 
products.

Thanks for the post.

Kenneth.

Well if you misjump in a sphere of 36 parsecs around a busy system then
within 1000 years it is NOT improbable that several ships misjump to the
same system but there\'s a high propability that the one that got there
prior to you is already dead when you arrive. Cool idea by the way, I\'ll
use it methinks.
Wasn\'t the abyss in Spinward marches supposed to work a bit like that
according to library data?

Yep, it is. But it schould be "DER Weltbund", not "DIE Weltbund".
Weltbund is a combination of two words.
"Welt" means world
"Bund" means if used like this federation or confederacy.
As "Bund" is a male word, it has to be "der" (masculinum).
"Die" is female (femininum).
In english, there is nothing like "der" or "die" (or "das", which is 
neutrum). It\'s just THE. This is, why it\'s so difficult for 
englishspeakers to learn roman languages. And "der, die, das" is not 
always used in a very logical manner.

Sorry for the use of bandwidth, but as we Traveller are intercultural, I 
think I could work a little bit as a link. ;-)

I don\'t think it\'s all that unrealistic to have these names - after all,
how many New World cities are named after Old World cities? Harlem is in
the Netherlands, so surely the same spirit that caused settlers to name
their New World town after their home town would apply in setlling planets.
It would make the place just that little less alien.

Different maps for different eras already exist - there\'s certainly one
of the Solomani Rim during the Interstellar Wars which has all of the
original Vilani names on it. It\'s quite interesting to compare it with the
later map to see which ones have changed.

    'body' => 'LAST PART:  KEN\'S TASK FIX PROTOTYPE!

What has gone on before?
	Ken\'s Task Fix Prototype! discussed goals for this project and how/if I obtained 
	them.

	Part Two:  Ken\'s Task Fix Prototype!  This is where I presented an easy fix to 	
the difficulty system in T4.  People who are interested in a quick and dirty fix 	
to the probability problem in T4 should look at this system.  It\'s easy.  It\'s 	quick.  
And it is very, very compatible with the T4 system (only dice for two 	categories are 
changed).




What is in this post?
	Last Part:  Ken\'s Task Fix Prototype!  contains a proposal for target number 	
	calculation different from that in T4.  If you don\'t like a character\'s ability 
	rating to be weighted more than twice as much as his skill level, then this is 	
	the post for you.

	



So, we\'ve had some problems with the T4 task system.  I believe that the probability 
issue was fixed in my last post, but I still have a problem with the T4 system.  That 
is--I don\'t like a character\'s governing attribrute to have more impact on the task 
throw than his skill does.  

Someone on this list, I have forgotten who, posted an example that illustrates my 
point exactly.  Let\'s take a person with a minimal piloting skill, but with a good dex, 
and compare him to a person with low dex but a great skill.

	Jack					Jill
	Dex 10;  Pilot-1			Dex 4;  Pilot-6

Jack has always been quick and good with his hands, and he knows the basics when it 
comes to piloting a starship.

Jill, OTOH, is worse than average when it comes to manual dexterity, but she is a 
supreme pilot.

Under the T4 system, Jack\'s target number is 11 while Jill\'s is a 10, and I have a 
problem with that.  Although I really like a character\'s attributes playing a big part 
in the task throw (improving on the MT task system), I don\'t think they should outweigh 
the level of skill a character has.

So, in order to fix this, I am proposing a new way to calculate target numbers.  The 
calculation is:
			

		Skill + (Avg. of Attribrute and Aptitude)

			drop all fractions

Whoa!  You might say.  What is this aptitude thing in the calculation?  Well, this is 
something that I picked up on in one of Eris\' posts.  

When I first saw the post, I thought the idea was not workable considering the scope of 
my task fix.  I want to keep everything simple and compatible with T4--drawing on the 
major strength of that system.  Eris\' post discussed creating aptitude areas (like 
hand/eye coordination vs sure footedness for dexterity--both dexterity governed 
but relating to different aspects of the ability), and I thought that this would be a 
huge endeavor.  It would be a major new set of rules, and I want to stay away from 
implementing major new game mechanics to T4.

But, I really like the idea.  Take dexterity, for example.  It governs picking locks 
(intrusion), tossing a grenade (throwing), piloting a starship (pilot), shooting a 
handgun (pistol), and even dancing (dance).  These are all very different 
activities--all governed by dexterity (and rightly so).  Incorporating aptitude will put 
some differentation into these varied tasks.  A person may be a hell of a pilot, but he 
can\'t dance that well eventhough he\'s taken many, many lessons (dance-2).

What I propose is this.  We incorporate aptitude for each skill a character has by using 
the target number calculation above.  This will give more weight to the skill level than 
the published T4 system, bring down the influence of the character\'s ability (and still 
ensure that it has a major effect on the task throw), and differentiate the many 
activities covered by the six abilities.

Hey, folks, this is one stop shopping.

So, how do we come up with this aptitude number?  Easy.  Roll 1 D6 for each skill a 
character has.  Modify the skill with the below chart (taken from MT procedures).
		
	Stat	Aptitude DM
	1-4	0
	5-9	+1
	10-14	+2
	15	+3

The modifier will skew the roll for characters with high natural ability and still 
ensure a great deal of randomness (like when a character\'s stats are first rolled).

I suggest recording the character\'s aptitude next to the appropriate skill on the 
character\'s sheet.  Many tasks use two or three of the character\'s abilities, and for 
this, I have a some suggestions.

One choice would be to base the aptitude number on the ability that governs most of the 
actions covered by the skill.  Another (the one I use) is to average the various 
abilities, and use that number as if it were the character\'s ability score for DM 
purposes.  If you don\'t mind the additional work (which I think is too much of a 
hassel), you can come up with different aptitudes for each governing ability the skill 
has.

However you do it, the aptitude rating will give players a good indication of their 
character\'s natural ability at the skills they use.



Let\'s test our Jack and Jill characters mentioned at the top of this post.  We\'ll give 
Jack the average aptitude of 5, and Jill gets the average (for her dex) of 3.

Using my target number formula, Jack has a t-number of 8, and Jill\'s is 9.  The higher 
skill level prevails!  

Now let\'s look at the variance for both characters based on aptitude.  Jack\'s aptitude 
would range from a low of 3 to a maximum of 8.  Jill\'s aptitude would range from 1 to 6.

This means that Jack\'s t-number could range from 7 to 10--a good amount of variance 
without it going overboard.  Jill\'s t-number would range from 8 to 9, which is 
understandable considering her low dex.  

I like the variability here.  Jack\'s high dex could also mean a high aptitude for 
piloting--giving him a better target number than someone with much more experience than 
he, but this is unlikely (and in this example, it can only happen if he has an 8 
aptitude).  Jill can compete with someone who has a dex over twice as good as hers 
because of her vast experience (read skill level).

This new target number calculation will also bring down the numbers a bit on the high 
end, making the probabilities (on the prob chart listed in part two) much more 
realistic.

If you choose to use this system, I suggest pre-rolling aptitudes for each skill and 
pre-calculating target numbers.  Record both on the character\'s sheet, and the speed of 
the game will not be effected at all by the small amount of extra math.


So everyone, there\'s my system.  Go ahead and hit me with your thoughts on it.


Sincerely,

Kenneth.

Another thought on the "unexplored" core worlds (unless this has been 
already answered...there have been, what, 50 or so digests in the past 
week...nice to see this list jumping!): Marc Miller and IG have expressed 
the intention of generating some "core" (ahem, sorry for the pun) systems 
and sectors for specific adventures and the like...and leaving the rest 
up to individual referees (us folks) to devise as we like. Perhaps this 
is what they did (without explaining it to us, thus causing many bytes of 
chest pounding, insert big smile icon here) with the Core Subsector 
map--it is up to us to fill in the unexplored worlds.

So here\'s a suggestion. Let\'s work up some guidelines and make a proposal 
to IG. Marc has stated that generating 20k (or whatever the number is) 
systems would be undoable by IG. How about we help out? During the heyday 
(not so long ago) of the thickest TNE discussions we were getting many 
excellent system postings on this list. Why can\'t we do the same for the 
T4 universe?

Of course it would help it we could keep the Atlas of the Imperium system 
guidance...plus Spinward Marches, Solomani Rim, etc. I too would like to 
know if there is a legal problem with using the old maps (It doesn\'t make 
much sense...the Atlas came out before the DGP stuff...so you would think 
that GDW and now MM own the "rights" to those star patterns...thus 
allowing IG to re-use the old sector maps). But, if there is some reason 
why we **can\'t** use old maps, I think that with the energetic die 
rollers and active imaginations we have on this list we could fill up 
several dozen sectors in no time!

The questions are:

Anybody out there have a complete set of the following RPGs?

Star Ace (Pacesetter)
Universe (SPI)
Space Opera (FGU)
GURPS Space/SF-oriented modules
Star Wars (WEG)

I\'m trying to build a collection of space oriented SF RPGs. I\'ve got a 
fair start of Space Opera, I\'ve got all--I think--of Universe, I\'ve got 
several GURPS modules--but I want to be sure I\'m not missing any...if 
anybody could point me towards FAQ\'s on these games, mailing lists, or 
just e-mail me a list, I\'d be very grateful.

A more detailed question on Star Wars: Some friends mentioned the new 
edition. They are wishy-washy on playing in Traveller, and would like to 
play SW. Now, I could run SW using Traveller, but I\'d rather run 
Traveller using Traveller and SW using SW, it\'s easier (if you understand 
my desire not to do lots of conversions!). Even though, a long time ago, 
on a college campus far far away, I did run SW using Traveller (sort of), 
some memories are better left being memories...

The question: Does the SW RPG have detailed rules (such as in the various 
incarnations of Traveller) for generating planets and ships?

A second question: Is there out there in net-land a mailing list on the 
SW RPG that I could direct this to? All I\'ve found thus far are lists 
devoted to SW CCG\'s and other collectibles...sigh...

Their very own Roswell Incident!  I bet this isn\'t common knowledge in the

been at a high enough tech-level to understand and replicate the drive, so
they probably would have developed it themselves anyway.

Observing from space makes things a lot easier. As I suggested long
ago, star data (spectral class & size) *and* presence of gas giants
should be known for everything within a sector or so. And IG really
should detail the maps to *that* level.

Ah! You aren\'t thinking it through. Those "to attack" numbers are *not*
for *prey*, they are for *humans*. That is, the table has nothing to do
with predator-prey interaction. It has to do with interaction between
*explorers* moving thru a habitat. That\'s a very different situation.

I haven\'t seen the new rules, but this sounds just like the CT rule.
And the trick there was that there are DMs involved such that you
didn\'t misjump except under unusual circumstances. As I recall, there
was a DM for Engineering skill, and maybe one for astrogation. And I
*know* there were DMs for maintenance. Keep up the maintenance, and
keep it on schedule and you were ok, skip or post pone it, and the
chance of a a misjump is sudden;y real.

Believe it or not, *some* branch of the US military has a unit patch
that is a black "sunburst" on an olive drab background. But it\'s only a
half circle.

The ribbons are actualy covering a "clip" in the shape of a shallow U.
This slides onto a metal bar. The bars are available in several
lengths. They have the usual "pin" and clip assembly on the back used
for badges (and for tie-tacks!). That is, there are one or more pins
that poke thru the cloth, and a gizmo that slides over the pin from the
back and latches. You press on the sides to release it.

This is based on examination of some insignia I inherited. 

BTW, you should be able to find a store (or section in a store) that
*sells* such things as common insignia and uniform parts. I\'d advise
checking with someone who knows the color codes for the ribbons of
various services so as to avoid using the code for well known awards.
For example, being that the con is in Germany, you do *not* want
anything that matches a Nazi ribbon!

If IG details the insignia a bit more, they could try licensing some of
the outfits that produce patches and insignia for sale at SF cons and
the like.

Then we just refer to the *other* places where microjumps are
mentioned. :-)

More seriously, consider that in reality, stars are *not* evenly
spaced. So a "1 parsec" jump could be as little as 1/4th that, or up to
almost 1.5. 

ps. I\'m pretty sure that even back in CT there were references to using
in-system jumps to cover large distances. For example, between
different parts of a multiple star system.

I\'ve dealt with Roger Sanger during the last year. To the best of my

material. People should keep this in mind before getting too enthusiastic.
Roger has as much to do with DGP\'s material as Michael Jackson does
with The Beatles music. (I.e. he just owns it.)

Unlike Michael Jackson and The Beatles, to the best of my knowledge,
Roger has achieved absolutely nothing towards publishing or making any
of the DGP material available or getting it back in print in the several years
that he has owned it. A pity really.

If I am wrong I would like to see a statement from Roger of exactly who else
is employed by DGP, or if the registered company has had any transaction
at all in the last three years.

Also, It is common courtesy for those wearing the CMH to be saluted by
those not, regardless of rank.  So SGT Joe Shmoe would be saluted by
general Powell first, who would in turn salute Gen. Powell.

	On most systems (those with Class A-B starports) it\'s not
	allowed to tank at a gas giant, you have to refuel at the
	station. Refueling at a gas giant is common practice for
	pirates, and though forbidden in secure areas. Its also
	common that refueling service is a major part of starport
	income on low populated worlds, so its forbidden to STEAL
	LHy from the GG by local law.

	But a fpp would allow to deal in the wilds, and the wilds
	are the market for far traders.

	it provides color for the game. Hey my Empire of the "Last Sane",

Actually, I am thinking it through

I\'d like to see it.  Personally, I find civilian and patrol ships much more
interesting and useful than major military ships.

As an aside, when I was running the MegaTraveller Referees\' Exchange, I
noticed that although most designers prefered military ships, most of the
ship requests were for civilian ships.  I would say you have a nice niche if
you like designing civilian ships.

Well I grew up in the state of Connecticut in the Northeastern US. Its
part of the region called New England.  There are town named
Manchester, New Britian, New London, etc.  I am sure there are more
towns where the residents just named their towns after towns back in
England, but my knowladge of towns in England is rather sparse.  

The Solomani ruled the Second Imperium, so it makes perfect sense that
they named or renamed many of the planets after things back home.

3.  The jump is on target (mostly), but the Jump Drive will need at

4.  While in JumpSpace the jump field begins unraveling.  Everyone

:)  Well, IIRC the web-page said something about getting future products 
shipped out in a more timely manner.  We\'ll see how the JTAS and 
Starships shipments do.  If they\'re slow, you might want to go ahead with 
that seal blubber idea. :)

Joe,

Quick observation...  FAQ\'s should not have non-standard abbreviations
unless there is a glossary at the beginning of the text.  You, I and the
TML know what _CSC_ means but the average person doesn\'t.  T4, IG and FFE
might be exceptions, but perhaps the first time that they are referenced
the abbreviation should also included:  For example: Imperium Games (IG)
FAQ, and Marc Miller\'s Traveller (T4) is a registered trademark by
FarFuture Enterprises (FFE).  Sorry if I\'m being nitpicky...  Just try\'en
to improve the product, boss!

A couple of questions:

Would it be possible to include information as to how to subscribe to TML
and xboat in the FAQ?

Am I correct in assuming that it is ok to publish the FAQ?  I realize that
this may be a stupid question but it is better to ask and know for sure.
Should we include the disclaimers if we do?

In the next edition of the FAQ would you include an updated version of the
IG Copyright policy you posted in Traveller-digest V1996 #567?  A snippet
of it follows below (because I have a question about it!):

jw> From: Joe Walsh <ransom@connect.iconnect.net>

<Snip!>

jw> IG Copyright Policy

jw> If you produce an original work for use with Traveller, you are the
jw> copyright holder (see copyright law for details). You own that

jw>
jw> However, IG and FFE ask that you put the trademark notice on that

Is it ok to clarify the "standard" FFE Trademark text as follows to clearly
delineate whom owns which copyright?

Traveller is a Registered Trademark of FarFuture Enterprises, and it is
Copyright (c) 1996.                                           ^^^^^^^^^
                                                              |||||||||

Sorry, if I\'m being over precise, but I don\'t want to step on anyone\'s
toes.   I want IG/FFE to succeed beyond the wildest hopes of anyone.  I
want them to be as big or bigger of a player in the hobby as T$R, WoTC,
SJG, etc...  A solid relationship between the IG/FFE and T4 players is one
of the best ways to facilitate this.  The better we have this defined now
the fewer problems will arise in the (far)future...

Joe,  I also want to take this opportunity to personally thank you for the
time and effort you are pouring into your role as liaison between TML and
IG/FEE.  It\'s plain to see that it\'s a lot of work, and I for one
appreciate it!  Keep up the good (nie!) GREAT work!

Chuck

   As someone else already mentioned, the MoH is almost always awarded
posthumously (that is, the recipient DIED while committing the act that
got him the award)

   So, obviously there WOULD only be a handful still alive! ;)

Yup.  You\'re right.  I\'m in the process of editing the FAQ right now. :)  
I want it to flow better, be more readable, etc.  Look for the new FAQ to 
be available shortly.


> A couple of questions:

Hum.  Well, I\'d rather not broaden the FAQ beyond simply Traveller and 
IG.  But, a pointer to the TML web site would be appropriate.  I\'ll put 
that in there, as that site explains in detail how to subscribe, what TML 
is about, etc.  It\'s more information than I can provide in the FAQ.
Would that be suitable?


> Am I correct in assuming that it is ok to publish the FAQ?  I realize that

Sure, but keep in mind that Jeff Zeitlin, Joe Heck, and...someone else (I 
forget who!) are also publishing it on their web sites.  We may end up 
wit more copies of the FAQ than we need! :)

Also keep in mind that Stu Dollar is forwarding it (suitably edited to 
point to him rather than me in the "who do i ask" answer) to useNET, 
since that is his area of responsibility as a Travellerite.

The Oct 16 edition has this, and it will continue to be part of the FAQ.

I\'ll clarify that.  Good thought!

The 40th Infantry Division (Mechanized), California National Guard, has a
patch that is a gold sunburst on a blue diamond.  The half-sun patch Leonard
mentions is a WWII unit and might be difficult to find.

Check in your yellow pages under embroidery and you\'ll find many shops that
will custom-make patches for you, some will even work off artwork on disk.
This isn\'t cheap, but if you are a costumer and looking for a costume that
will stand up to close scrutiny, this is the route to take.

HISTORY

   Business started 1994 by the officers.  50% of capital stock 
is owned by Courtney S Solomon.  50% of capital stock is 
owned by John Benitz.

   Courtney S. Solomon born 1970.  1991-present active here.

   John Benitz born 1960.  1991-present active here.  1985-91
employed by Prudential Bache Securities Asia Pacific, Hong Kong.

OTHER SIGNIFICANT INFORMATION

   There is a TSR connection.  Sweetpea Entertainment owns the 
rights to the screenplay of "Dungeons & Dragons: The Movie".
Since Ken Whitman (and others at IG) are former TSR employees,
this might explain how they came together originally.

   Here is what I found about the movie, from a FAQ file on the Internet:

     "The movie & merchandizing rights to a Dungeons & Dragons movie have
    been bought by Sweetpea Entertainment.  They are aiming at a 
    production cost of $50 million and a release date somewhere around
    Christmas of 1996 or summer of 1997.  The movie will be a combination 
    of live action and computer animation.  Stan Winston, the man
    behind the digital effects in _Terminator II_ and _Jurassic Park_,
    has been brought in to aid Sweetpea with the movie.  The script, 
    which was written by Topper Lilien and Carrol Cartwright and is 
    apparently not based on a specific TSR product, involves an 
    inexperienced sorceress and a quick-witted rogue who are on a quest 
    to find an artifact which could control gold dragons and to keep 
    said artifact out of the hands of the villain, who happens to be a 
    wizard.  Stay tuned to rgfd for any further announcements about this 
    movie."

   This implies that while the information from D&B I found on Sweetpea 
shows only has four employees, that number may not reflect private
contractors or temporary employees brought in to work on the production
of the film.

FINAL ANALYSIS

   Sweetpea Entertainment is a small, private corporation that was 
founded less than three years ago and is involved primarily in the film 
industry.  As such, it is difficult (but apparently not totally impossible)
to find out information about them.

   How they came about funding the resurrection of Traveller 
would I\'m sure make an interesting story, should Mr. Solomon and/or 
Mr. Benitz like to tell us about it some day.  At this point we can only
speculate as to why.

   I welcome any comments from the gallery....

Regards,

Harold

Marc, this will work as long as you clearly demark which areas are, 
well, \'de-Marced\' as strictly for referees.  That way people can safely 
develop areas knowing that future IG products will fit right in with 
their campaigns.  And those of us that don\'t have time to lovingly 
detail sectors can rely on the official background, which will of course 
include fairly large contiguous areas for adventuring. >>

And of course the PCs would never dream of wandering over into areas 
they know the ref knows nothing about, just to be awkward...

Hmm... Rebels? Criminals? Doesn\'t sound like the kind of people I\'d
want delivering my mail. Or making my maps. Or handling delicate liasons
with newly (re)contacted civilizations.

I\'d want really reliable, methodical people for all these jobs.

I\'d want people who were so conformist that they didn\'t even need
(or care about) a pecking order to get things done. I\'d want
people so dedicated that they\'d risk extraordinary danger.
Heck, I\'d want monks and nuns, or the bureaucratic equivalent.
And that would be... scouts.

Uniforms? Nothing showy. Simple, ascetic, utilitarian, like a jet black
jumpsuit.

Marc, this will work as long as you clearly demark which areas are, 
well, \'de-Marced\' as strictly for referees.  That way people can safely 
develop areas knowing that future IG products will fit right in with 
their campaigns.  And those of us that don\'t have time to lovingly 
detail sectors can rely on the official background, which will of course 
include fairly large contiguous areas for adventuring. >>

And of course the PCs would never dream of wandering over into areas 
they know the ref knows nothing about, just to be awkward...

Right. A moderate sized standard starship sensor set, in fact, can
probably detect gas giants out to a distance of a sector, and 
earthlike planets at ranges of a few parsecs. (See the various NASA
ExNPS web pages and/or the recent scientific american article for more
info; there are serious proposals for a space mission that will detect
earthlike planets around nearby stars sometime early next century; 
and I\'ve participated in a design study on using Keck to detect gas giants
(through direct imaging, not radial velocities) and it\'s not hard - and would
be very easy with a Keck-in-space. A P3 sensor is roughly as capable as Keck;
a P6 is capable of detecting earthlike planets out to 12 parsecs or so.

There are (more questionable) NASA proposals to use seperated-spacecraft
interferometers to *image* features on the surface of earthlike planets
around nearby stars; I personally think it\'s ludicrous for the next 20-30
years, but at TL12 it\'s probably not hard - most universities on Sylea
probably have access to a multispacecraft interferometric telescope setup
that could resolve features at the 10-km level at ranges of a few parsecs.

(Someday, I\'m going to write a JTAS article on this.)

I\'m pretty sure (don\'t have my book with me) that the one-in-thirtysix
rule only applies to users of unrefined fuel. If you use refined fuel
and keep your drives maintained, and only jump at safe distances, then
your chance of misjump is zero.

This was the case in CT. You may want to re-read the rules.

The new core subsector in T4 is the old Chant subsector from Traveller
Digest #10.  (Might have been nine, but I think it was 10.)  The stars
are in the same positions, and Chant was just south of core in DGP\'s
Imperium.  So Sylea (Capitol) has moved about half a subsector south.

I think this means that Imperium games is using the same map as before,
but new system profiles.  This would make sense if they intend to keep
the Spinward Marches, and I suspect they do. (Hey Joe, any info on that?)
I am also hopeful that my Solomani Rim supplement will still be good as
it is a Classic Traveller book.  

As for Marc Miller\'s post, I do hope he will leave the system profiles of
the worlds he defines in the Marches and the Rim the same as before.  I
actually think the entire Marches should be kept the same, it\'s been with
us so long it needs to be grandfathered (pun intended) in.

Well, it does not need to be the same place. Just the same SECTOR, and over
a loooong period of time. Imagine you misjump far, far away and, in the
first planet you visit, someone tells you something in Galanglic... you will
ask eho has taught him the language, and you will keep searching until you
find the people.

A-ha! I didn\'t think of time-travelling through misjumps! Good point. But
maybe a little less is enough: there is some black hole/withe hole seven
sectors away from the edge of charted space which loosely attracts a small,
fixed percentage of all misjumped ships from an area inside charted space.
In the course of the last five millenia, thousand of starships of the Six
Races have arrived into the SAME sector. Eventually, The Alliance appeared.
Every now and then, they receive new misjumped travellers, so they know
about the general history of us. Yes, this is more convenient.

        Precisely. But suppose a Colony Ship some millenia ago (Vilani,
e.g.) was ***prepared*** to survive anywhere. When the following misjumped
ships arrived, they already had a pocket empire... and the steady arrival of
misjumped ships kept that empire somewhat parallel to charted space.
        And, well, what about the astronomical phenomenon attracting ships
from several areas (due to the strange, 11-dimension, geometry of
jumpspace). One of those is the Abyss Rift. And, in fact, the probability of
misjump in those areas is a bit greater, because of the phenomenon.
        Ooops... what will happen to The Alliance when the first
Virus-infected ship misjumps into its territory????

Something to keep in mind is that the scout service is definitely more

employ rebels and criminals, but there definitely is room for the

cargo
without speculation, I had to wonder about the smuggling end of things.

1.  Payment arrangements:  Assuming someone agrees to run an illicit cargo,
and did not just outright buy the illegal cargo and sell at a profit as a
normal speculative cargo haul, how would they arrange payment?  A free
trader captain could easily take the cargo and run, keeping his fee and
whatever cargo he  stole, and keep on heading west so to speak.  The person
wanting the run can\'t very well tell the authorities that his illegal goods
were stolen.

Any nifty ideas?  One I was thinking was that a typical arrangement would be
1/4 to 1/2 up front, with balance upon delivery from the folks it\'s being
delivered to.  

2.  Cargos:  Another thing, what would be some typical high pay, high risk
smuggling cargos in the T4 universe?  Would it be the usual - drugs, or more
exotic.  I\'m looking for what other people use in their campaigns, just for
amusement and variety - I have plenty of ideas on this on my own, such as:

illicit organ trade (in the real world this is expected to exceed the
illicit drug trade in ten years or so) or are their medical technology
reasons in the T4 universe that make this obsolete.

military hardware (I figure this one would be a very lucrative, stable cargo
- - there are never enough weapons)

high technology components (stuff that takes a high TL world to create)

****

Another thought.

If a ship carried a library of technological specs and plans, and samples
from a TL12 system, and went to TL7,8,9,10, etc. worlds, couldn\'t they sell
this technology for mega bucks?

I mean, if in our world, a TL12 free trader showed up, what country wouldn\'t
pay anything they wanted in trade?  I\'m sure there is something on our world
that would be valuable to a TL12 trade system, such as radioactives or raw
materials.

Subsistence at the highest level is usually quoted at about Cr600 per
month (retail?), which suggests that the food & drink component of the
life support cost is minimal (less than Cr20 per day?) when compared
to running the waste recyclers, et al. (air, water, & other ;-)


Personally, I have tended to simply use the Cr2000 figure per trip
rather than attempt to play "Lasers & Ledgers".


Phillip McGregor, Leonard Erikson, and Guy Garnett have got me
wondering what those credits really buy!

It seems like the galley would get its power from the ship\'s power
plant, and the wear and tear on the life support system would be
covered by the ship\'s annual maintenance. For a one week of transit
the food & water seems like it should cost less than Cr140. Also,
wouldn\'t the life suport system be using the ship\'s power plant for
its power requirements as well? Using a figure of Cr1000 per week for
the life support cost, on what is the remaining Cr860+ spent?

Now I\'m really baffled...

Imperium Games FAQ                                        October 17, 1996


PART I:  GENERAL INFORMATION

Q.  What is a FAQ?

A.  FAQ is short for "Frequently Asked Questions."  Thus, a FAQ is a list 
of frequently asked questions on a particular subject, along with answers to 
those questions.


Q.  What is the purpose of this FAQ?

A.  The Imperium Games FAQ has been created in order to provide a single 
source of answers for questions regarding Imperium Games, Inc.\'s product 
schedules, Traveller rules clarifications, and general information 
relating to Imperium Games\' product line.


Q.  How accurate is this FAQ?

A.  As accurate as it can be, given that humans are involved at every 
step of the process.  Sometimes there is a miscommunication or 
misunderstanding that results in inaccurate information.  Other times, 
items in this FAQ (such as release dates) get changed after the FAQ is 
presented online.
    While every effort is made to ensure that the information contained 
herein is accurate at the time of presentation, mistakes will happen from 
time to time.  Please keep that in mind, and be forgiving of the 
Travellerite who posts the information. :)


Q.  Where can I find the latest copy of this FAQ?

A.  Peter Miller (no relation to Marc) maintains an excellent 
Traveller-related web-site at (http://www.dragonfire.net/~pm/traveller/) 
and the latest version of this FAQ can always be found there.


Q.  Who or what is Imperium Games?

A.  Imperium Games, Inc. (IG) is the company which publishes the Traveller 
role-playing game.  The staff of IG includes:  Ken Whitman, Lester 
Smith, Greg Porter, Don Perrin, Ashe Marler, Matt Machtan, and Timothy 
Brown.


Q.  Who is Marc Miller?

A.  Marc Miller is the man who invented the Traveller role-playing game, 
and who holds the trademark for the Traveller name, as well as the 
copyrights to products published by Game Designers\' Workshop (the company 
which published Traveller from 1978 through January, 1996).  His company 
is FarFuture Enterprises (FFE).  Marc continues to be involved with the 
Traveller game, by advising IG and posting frequently to the Traveller 
Mailing List (TML), among other ways.  


Q.  Are there any web sites with information about Traveller?

A.  Information about Traveller can be obtained from the Imperium Games 
Web Site (http://www.imperiumgames.com), which also contains many links to 
other sites of interest to Traveller enthusiasts. 


Q.  How do I get more information about the TML?

A.  James Dempsey runs a superlative TML web-site 
(http://www.spirit.com.au/~jamesd).  Go there for information on the TML, 
including how to join the mailing list.


Q.  Who do I contact if I need an official answer to a Traveller-related 
question?

A.  If you have questions about general Traveller information, including 
release dates, rules interpretations, questions about this FAQ, errata 
notes, and so on, you may post them to either the Traveller Mailing List or 
the rec.games.frp.misc newsgroup.  This is the preferred method, as it 
allows others to see the question and subsequent answer, thus avoiding 
duplication.
    However, you may have reason to e-mail one of the IG representatives 
directly.  The official IG representatives are:  Joseph E. Walsh 
(ransom@iconnect.net), Stuart L. Dollar (sdollar@goodnet.com), and Guy 
"Wildstar" Garnett (wildstar@qrc.com).  Their responsibilities, in 
general, are as follows:
    Joe Walsh handles overall coordination, and has specific 
responsibility for questions posted on the TML and/or authored by TML 
participants.
    Stu Dollar handles all questions posted to the useNET newsgroup 
rec.games.frp.misc and/or authored by participants of that newsgroup.  
    Guy Garnett handles issues related to the various ship/craft design 
systems used in the Traveller game, star travel as presented in the 
Traveller game, and other such technical questions.
    If you are unsure who to contact, just send the question to the TML 
or rec.games.frp.misc, and you can be sure you will get an answer from 
the appropriate person.
    Please keep in mind that we reserve the right to re-post any 
questions, whether sent to the TML, useNET, or to one of the private 
email addresses.  This is generally only done if it is deemed that an 
answer to the question will benefit the whole group.  In short, though, 
no such communications should be considered private.

    Finally, if you have questions that are business-related (i.e., you 
want to get a License to publish Traveller items or a Letter of 
Permission, you want to check on your specific order, or you want to 
place an order), contact Imperium Games.  They can be contacted at:
       Imperium Games, Inc.
       P.O. Box 481
       Lake Geneva, WI 53147

Q.  Where do you get your Official Answers?

A.  Some answers come from our own knowledge of the Traveller game, 
while others come from the folks at Imperium Games.


PART II:  PRODUCT RELEASE INFORMATION

Q.  When will [insert product here] be shipped?

A.  The correct schedule for products to be shipped (that is, when they
will begin to be shipped to dealers and those who ordered directly through
IG) as of the date of this FAQ is:

        Starships                       November 15
        JTAS                            November 15
        Citizens of the Imperium        November 15
        Aliens Archive                  November 15
        Central Supply Catalog          December 1
        Milieu 0                        December 15
        First Survey                    December 15


Q.  When is my T4 hardback going to arrive? 

A.  It depends.
All Orders:  The hardbacks were shipped in approximately the same 
sequence in which orders were received.  As of October 18, all the 
hardbacks should be either in the mail or at their destinations.  IG 
wants to express their sincere thanks for the great patience everyone 
has shown in waiting for their orders to be filled.

U.S. Orders:  Some were shipped via Priority Mail, while others were 
shipped via 4th Class Mail, depending on the date on which the order was 
placed.  For details of when your specific order was shipped, please call 
or write to Imperium Games.

Foreign Orders:  Foreign orders will take longer to arrive than orders 
shipped to the continental U.S. 


Q.  Why is it taking so long to get my T4 hardback?

A.  IG was overwhelmed with orders for the hardback, and were caught 
somewhat unprepared.  They have only one person available to do the 
shipping (including printing labels, packaging the goods, etc.).  
    IG plans to improve their shipping process for future product 
shipments. 


PART III: SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT IG PRODUCTS

Q.  What is the scope of the upcoming Central Supply Catalog (CSC) 
supplement?

A.  The CSC will have a huge amount of equipment, as well as a very robust 
small craft design system.  CSC\'s focus is on equipment available in 
Milieu 0.


Q.  What about equipment for subsequent Milieux?

A.  New equipment will be published for subsequent Milieux when each 
Milieu book is published.  At this point, it is unknown whether that will 
take the form of a section of each Milieu book, a separate CSC-type 
book, or be some combination depending on the Milieu in question.


Q.  What changes will be made in subsequent printings of Marc Miller\'s 
Traveller (T4, the main Traveller rule book)? 

A.  The next printing of T4 will simply have errata notes in the back of the 
book.  The printing after that will be version 1.1, and will have all 
the noted errors corrected (but will have the same artwork).


Q.  I really don\'t like [insert a rule from T4 here] . . .

A.  If you don\'t like something about any IG product, feel free to change
it!  The folks at IG realize they aren\'t gods, and are therefore unable
to create the perfect system for everyone.  Their philosophy is that they
are producing _guidelines_, not laws carved in stone.  And, if you do 
create new rules, please share them online (see below for copyright 
information related to this subject)!


Q.  My local game store doesn\'t carry Traveller products.  (Or, "There
aren\'t any Traveller players in my area.")

A.  Ask the owner of your friendly local game store if you can run a 
demo of the Traveller game.  If s/he will let you do so, some ideas 
for what to do include:
        1)  Run through some _extremely simple_ scenarios with 
            prospective customers.  These might be simply hitting
            a target - give them a character, a situation, a little
            build up, and a number to roll.  Act out the consequences.
        2)  Get a few members of your gaming group together, and play
            at the store, if they\'ll allow it and have an area where
            customers can stop by and watch you play.
        3)  Your own ideas

        The point is, demand drives supply.  If you would like to see a 
supply of Traveller products at your local game store, help to create the 
demand and let the game store owner know that demand exists.  If you can 
stir up enough demand among the gaming community in your area, the game 
store owner will almost certainly begin carrying lots of Traveller products.
        Plus, you you may end up making some new gaming friends! :)


PART IV:  COPYRIGHT POLICY INFORMATION

Q.  What is IG\'s copyright policy in regards to original works posted to 
the Traveller Mailing List, WWW sites, and/or Usenet?

A.  Just include "Traveller is a Registered Trademark of FarFuture 
Enterprises" in the document, and IG will be fine with it, so long as 
you don\'t sell you work (or make money off of it in any way) - see 
below.
    Imperium Games and FarFuture Enterprises _encourage_ fans to create 
their own rules variants, equipment, settings, etc.  They further encourage 
those who create such new aspects of the Traveller universe to freely share 
their work.  The game can only be improved by such fan interaction.


Q.  If I make an original work for Traveller, who owns it?

A.  You do (you may want to include a copyright notice in your document, 
thus explicitly stating you ownership of your own work).  But, you 
cannot make money from your work without doing one of the following:

    1)  Getting a Letter of Permission (call or write to IG for details)
    2)  Becoming a Licensee (call or write to IG for details)
    3)  Having a Licensee publish your work (call or write IG for details)


Q.  Is there any way around this?

A.  Yes.  Don\'t mention Traveller in your article, and don\'t pull 
material from any Traveller product.  Say it is an article for use with 
science fiction RPG\'s, and keep it generic.


Q.  Can IG or FFE publish my original Traveller work without my permission?

A.  No.  They cannot take your original work and publish it without first 
getting your permission.


Q.  What is the policy regarding copying previously published works by 
Game Designers\' Workshop to the internet (or elsewhere)?

A.  You have to get written permission from Marc Miller 
(FarFuture@aol.com) in order to legally do so.  He holds all the 
copyrights on all such material.

I have now put a picture of Newts (Bwaps) into my Library Data entry for

I have put the article up for comments. You see, a number of people had
ideas for a CD-ROM when Marc first solicited suggestions. I think many would
love to see all the old JTAS/Challenge mags scanned onto the CD, along with
Library Data available to be viewed via a browser. I even think you should
be able to include a link page, pointing to a user\'s page on their hard
disk. They can add their own campaign data here!

As well as this, many people asked for various things to be on the CD:
software, pictures, etc.

Please post me your comments on what you would like on a Traveller CD-ROM

Hmm... The IISS accepts many people with a variety of backgrounds.  Their
background is not as important as their performance.  If they can\'t make it
and wash out, it is because they don\'t have the qualities needed to be a
successful Scout.  Though a kid was a rogue/criminal, he will have to live
up to the high standards of the Scout Service or be discharged.  You will
notice I said "the truly dedicated" in my post above; I was hoping it would
be clear that these are men of action, integrity and intent.

Marc Miller\'s Traveller book described these Scouts as having an
"Us-Against-the World" attitude.  They\'d have to be highly motivated
individualistic people in order to brave deep space, often alone with the
barest of tools, and with no or little direct support -- not brown-nosing,
paper shuffling, bureaucratic conformist.  These are the brave men that make
history, and don\'t wait around for history to happen to them. IMHO, of
course.  <grin>

 Well, I got mine (in NY) via USPS Priority.  If they\'re using

 entirely possible, based on comments from Canadians I know from
 other lists, that Postes Canada is sitting on them.  Or losing

 My thoughts:

 First, be aware that I usually don\'t bother with background
 music - about the only time I do is when I\'m running a "High
 Camp" game.

 I always enjoy Bach\'s "Toccata and Fugue in D Minor"; it\'s a
 virtually automatic choice for when they have to deal with the
 Mad Scientist Who\'s Out To Destroy Known Space - and it works
 pretty well for other Major Villains, too.  Especially the ones
 that I want to suggest have perceptions of reality that are
 less than totally accurate.

 For scenes where the Cavalry Rides to the Rescue, I\'d go with
 Wagner - "The Ride of the Valkyries", from the Ring cycle.

 For a haunted-house-apropos scene, an instrumental of The
 Beatles\' "Being for the Benefit of Mr Kite" seems to fit.
 Provided that the melody line is carried by a pipe organ, or a
 calliope.

 For troops on maneuvers: The Beatles, again - "March of the
 Meanies" from the "Yellow Submarine" album/CD.

 The Starship Trying to Avoid Being Late for the Next Random
 Encounter gets the theme from "Star Trek: The Next Generation".

This matches with one of Murphy\'s Laws for Combat:
All else being equal, the side with the simpler uniform will win

Before you start adding all sorts of flashes and epaulettes, compare the dress uniform of 
a Tin Pot Generallissimo and of a typical commando
The Generallissimo has a much more impressive uniform, the commando has to make do 
with skill and efficiency. Hardly a goal for a modern army, now is it?

As some of you already might now... right now (from thursday to sunday)
the Essener Spieletage (the largest gaming convention of the world) take

crew is said to be visiting Germany) hoped to meet them somewhere at the
convention.

Sadly either I was blind or they were not (yet?) there.  I\'ll be visiting
again on saturday and still hope to meet them in person by then.  As far
as the new Traveller edition is concerned things do not bode well for it
over here in Germany.  The largest two german distributors do not seem to
be interested in picking it up and it generally was not (well) represented
on thursday.  I managed to find a total of three places where I could buy
the new softcover rulebooks -- and all three places were impossible to
find by casual looking (you really had to dig in some boxes).  Bad start
for T4.  Imperium Games really should show some presence -- otherwise I
fear they\'ll loose one market.

        For simplicity, the rules assume you run the power plant at full
capacity whether you\'re using all the power or not. If you want to calculate
and track actual usage,you\'re welcome to.

        No, they don\'t. They use a certain amount of power for their drives,
and the power plant uses a certain amount of fuel per time period. Exactly
the same as thruster plates.

If the above happened to a ship with thruster plates (the technology of
which is gravity-based), how could it manuever worth a darn outside a
star\'s gravitational influence? I was under the impression that T4
thruster plates were similar to the old MT grav plates rather than the
MT thruster plates which didn\'t require a star\'s/planet\'s grav field to
perform efficiently.

        Actually, they\'re somewhere between ... Antigravity as used in
vehicles goes down more or less with local gravity. TPlates have a step
function -- down to a certain point they work unaffected, and past that
point they work at a fraction of their original ability.

        But the answer is yes -- a TPlate equipped ship would take forever
getting back home.

That sounds like the subdued (black and olive drab version) unit patch 
for the California National Guard.  I might have the state wrong, but 
it\'s definitely a NG patch.

You also want to avoid significant ribbons from any other military.  As 
other TML\'ers have mentioned, getting caught with a Silver Star might buy 
you some trouble.  If you\'ve got access to a precedence chart, you\'ll 
want to refer to it in order to select the least significant ribbons.

I have always used the following: up to TL C grav plates operated at 0.5 power beyond 
10 diameters, and 0.1 beyond 100. At TL D, the efficiency goes up to full out to 100 and 
0.5 beyond. The next major leap is TL G, where it becomes 1.0 thrust always

You might try the mass-combat rules in the "World Tamer\'s Handbook" 
published for TNE.  Of course, they\'re designed for operating on a scale 
larger than Striker II does, and this might be too large a scale for what 
you\'re looking for.

Actually all your responses are right along the lines I was thinking.  I
could respond to each but for bandwidth\'s sake I\'ll refrain (hoo-rah!).  I
imagine that the copyright section will be updated frequently at first but
settle down once all of the contingincies have been accounted for.

My web related questions were related to the fact that I\'ll probably be
putting together my web pages (finally devoting the time) in the next
couple of weeks and wanted to make sure of my footing.  Anything that I
publish to begin with will probably be pointers to other sites.

I would point out that anyone who publishes material for free on the web
who think that they might wish to pursue sale of the material at a later
date put in a disclaimer stating that the material may be removed without
notice at any time (blah blah blah...).

already online at my Traveller Pages.

Check it out, http://www.dragonfire.net/~pm/traveller/

One little note.  You\'ll experience lag time...I mean severe lag time.  My

be offline Friday and\\or Saturday.  However, with luck, it\'ll have a
relatively speedy connection after these dates...please bear with me.

	You can now browse though the GAL21 data ony any university

	I also think about installing yet an other mailserver on

	mail comments about world profiles to deceased and they\'ll
	become included online.

	If you wanna test it, start with Spinward, wait a while till

I totally agree!  This would make it usable by all Traveller fans with a
computer and CD-ROM.  Not to mention potentially better (i.e. faster) than
some routes that could be taken!

Good suggestion.  Let\'s make you the team leader on this.

I own information published by DGP and GDW for these sectors:  Spinward Marches, Trojan 
Reach, Riftspan Reaches, Deneb, Reft Sector, Ealiyasiyw, Dark Nebula, Corridor, Vland, 
Solomani Rim, Diaspora, and Massilia.

Now these are just maps and UWPs, mind you, but that is what I want from IG in the form 
of \'official\' sector information anyway.  If IG wants to detail some worlds in these 
sectors, then that is fantastic.  My complaint has always been that IG will leave some 
of these systems blank.  I don\'t want to see that.  I want all of these maps that I own 
to convert easily to future supplements published by IG.  What I don\'t want is systems 
left blank.  

 
> Of course it would help it we could keep the Atlas of the Imperium system
> guidance...plus Spinward Marches, Solomani Rim, etc. 

I own all of these too.  

I\'m all for this project, Fred.  Take the bull by the horns and start running with it.

Hail, Team Leader,

Kenneth.

If Germany is like Austria, IG-wise, then stay where you are. This is the

Traveller-stuff here.
I for my part will now start to order them directly.

Anything illegal on the destination world.  For example I heard a

Imagine the players surprise when their valuable illegal cargo turns

Possible.  I just wish I knew why mail from overseas (Norway, England,
Australia, South Africa, France, Japan, Hong Kong) arrives more promptly and
in better condition than mail from the US.  I\'ve been assuming that the
problem was with the US postal system because Canada Post manages OK with
mail from other countries.

        Yes. I use a slight modification:
        On every jump, roll 3- on 3D6 for a misjump (1 over 216). Use
standard DMs for unrefined fuel, distance to a planet, etc.
        On a misjump, roll 3D6 on the mishap table. Superficial Dmg: Failed
jump. Waste of some fuel, minor repairs needed, so on. No jump made. Minor:
"Close" misjump (up to J-6). Major: "Far" misjump (up to J-36 or more...).
Destroyed: BOUM.
        On a close or far Misjump, assume that the geometry of jumpspace is
naturally altered by gravitational forces... roll for the place you are
going, and, if it is empty, roll 1D6. On 1-2, OK and good luck. On 4-6, pick
the nearest star system (roll if necessary).

        Well, insurance, of course! You could even assume that the loan
payments include a small part for an obligatory "Misjump insurance". In case
of BOUM, the insurance will be paid to the bank...

> when engaged in prayer?

One adapts, of course.  Jews do not _have_ to face Jerusalem - in fact, at
most of the synagogues here they face east, while Jerusalem is
east-south-east.  Some simple solutions:

1) Ignore the tradition, and face the main religious site on the planet.

2) Face the starport, as being the fastest way to get to Jerusalm/Mecca.

3) Use technology to figure out which way to face at any given time (check
out "The Gripping Hand" by Niven/Pournelle for an example).

4) Assume that the direction is along some galactic line (just as directions
on Earth are along the surface, ignoring shortcuts through the interior) and
face that way.


Keep in mind that (a) traditions change, and (b) loopholes and differing
interpretations can be found for any tradition.  Two examples:

1) Sabbath ovens don\'t have a light, because openning the oven door would
cause the temperature to drop, which turns on the element, and if the light
came on you would have \'lit a fire\' which breaks the Sabbath.  Note that the
little peanut bulb is considered a fire, while the considerably more powerful
heating element isn\'t.  I find this really strange, but one of my Jewish
friends (who follows these traditions) says you have to expect this kind of
inconsistency when non-technological rabbis decide about technology. He then
points to assorted strange secular laws and funding decisions as proof that
the secular world is just as non-rational.

2) Muslim scholars have used the Koran to argue for and against votes/rights
for women.  Depends on which section you use, and how you interpret a
passage.  Assuming that the Koran is like the Christian bible, you can
\'prove\' _anything_ if you read passages out of context.

All of which is a bit off-topic, but you hit one of my interests.


To bring things back to Traveller, I think I\'m going to add a "Holy
Gyrocompass" to my equipment list.  This will be a simple device that
indicates the exact direction of a particular star at any time, so that
religious worshippers who need to know can do so quickly and easily.

*bzzz* All true enough, but unfortunately the Vilani jump-copying
angle, regardless of whether it\'s true or not, doesn\'t disqualify
them. The Vilani had a SUBLIGHT empire of several systems before
the discovered jump drive.

Although it does make a good case for the Solomani having copied
it if we only made it to the belt when we found it... or maybe
we\'re just smarter!

It is very simple.  For Moslems, they simply orient a stone or indicator at
their landing site towards terra, and then declare that direction "Toward
Mecca". If you got to a new planet, you CERTAINLY have enough technology to
determine the direction of Terra when you land.  It would also give the
Mullah or Sultan who controlled the spaceport a definate social power.

The same sort of thing can be done for Jerusalem, New York, or Graceland
(for the First Church of Elvis the Divine, Third Reformation)

The Koran is NOT like the bible, in that ALL Korans, written in Arabic, are
identical.  Many interpretations can be drawn, but the original text is
always the same.  Technically, translating the Koran into other languages is
forbidden.

Even more disruptive is the practice of praying 5 times a day as a
requirement on all Muslims.  During drive recalibration?  Combat (and in
Arabia, battles HAVE stopped for prayer)?

In one 2300 module, they mentioned that one planet with a large muslim population got 
permission to remove a tiny chip of the Black Rock and place it in one shrine. And this 
would be treated as Mecca for that world

Hmmm, If you make that assumtion, then why not say a mis-jump 
always lands you in a gravity well... of course it could be 
something evil like around a black hole....  :)

Well, DOUBLE #*!THWOCK!*#.  Of course... Boy am I going to have fun
with my players trying to collect on their insurance...  evil :>

Actually, this brings up question #3)
When I figured out the starship payments and time frame I ended up 
with an interest rate of about 4% and that\'s assuming that the
payments are just PI (Principal & Interest) not PITI (Principle,
Interest, Taxes, & Insurance).  Does anyone else think this is 
low for the risk level on a Free Trader?  And if those payments
are PITI, then the interest rate is probably down at 3%....
That doesn\'t sound like a cold hearted banker to me.

Any comments?

Thanks bunches,

Exactly. We want a finished product, not something with \'this area

That\'s never been a problem in the past, why should it be now? And as

But you can get the same effect by just saying \'referees are free to

personal view of the universe\'. That way, *everyone* is happy. Full data

even not buy the book(s), on the grounds that if they\'re being forced to

refs may also be put off, and buy something they can use straight out of 
the box instead.

So you want to replace an official canon, available to everyone, with an

Andrew,

You\'ve raised a point which I\'ve found, recently, to be of interest.  It\'s 
just a game, yet we get very angry about it at times.  It\'s wonderful 
that we all get so wrapped up in this game, but there is (as always) the 
negative side of that.

Heck, I remember how upset I was at the idea of basing T4\'s ship design 
system on FF&S.  I was actually *depressed* for a while when it became 
clear that, indeed, IG was doing what the gearheads wanted them to do.

That\'s weird, isn\'t it?

Of course, after all was said and done, and I had a copy of QSDS, I was 
happy as a lark.  :)   It was a totally new way of designing ships (from 
my perspective as a CT ref), yet it was familiar as well.  It turned out 
to be exactly what I wanted - even though I didn\'t know what I wanted 
until I saw it. :)


> even not buy the book(s), on the grounds that if they\'re being forced to

Hmmm. But is that right?  Will we be forced to write some of it?  I was 
under the impression that IG was going to provide several pre-defined 
areas.  A couple subsectors here, a few there, etc., as time goes on. 

True, that isn\'t the whole-sector scenario we had with previous 
products.  But, it could be enough for a campaign.  Heck, most of my 
campaigns took place within six or seven worlds.  But then, I\'m probably 
atypical in that regard.

Me?  What do I want?  Hmmm.

Well, no, I don\'t think it should be limited to the online world.  But, 
yes, I think it would be nice to get rid of the "official canon" 
mentality.  Yes...yes, I do.

If BITS, CORE, Sword of the Knight, and/or Gold Rush Games comes out 
with, say, "The Spinward Marches Supplement" - fully defined and whatnot - 
would that be a bad thing?  If IG does it, it will be viewed as "official 
canon."  If a third party does it...well, at least there\'s a chance 
people will see it as being optional. :)

My comment about the probability of having vast regions of defined space 
available online was merely an example of what I expect to happen as a 
result of IG\'s policy of leaving system definition open.

I\'m willing to give the new policy a try.  I may or may not like it, 
after I\'ve used it for a while.  But, at this point, giving it try sounds 
worthwile.

Not for most of the groups I\'ve played in. Very often we were
focused on just one or two worlds, not even six or seven, and we dealt
with all the various planets & such within a system instead of taking
extended tours to our systems.

Here\'s the official line:  "Everything that was official Traveller 
history will remain official Traveller history.  What will change is 
that, history is always written by the victors.  So, what you know to be 
true may not, in fact, be true."

I interpret that to mean that, for instance, the boundaries between the 
Imperium, Zhodani, and Sword Worlds will remain as they have always been 
(once we get to 1100 anyway).  But, we may find out that, just as an 
example, the Imperium did some dirty tricks on the Zho\'s to get the 
territory they have.

the majority view - if most people agree with me, I believe IG should 
change their plans. OTOH, if I\'m in the minority, I\'ll shut up.

As I understand it, the positions are as follows:

FOR:
- - encourages creativity
- - allows refs to feel more in control

AGAINST:
- - more work for refs
- - encourages inconsistency in background

The possible options are:

1. Complete details on every world in the Imperium.

2. Complete details on some worlds, others limited to UWPs (but may be 
detailed later).

3. Complete details on some worlds, others limited to UWPs (and will not 
be detailed later).

4. Complete details on some worlds, others left blank (and will not be 
detailed later).

5. UWPs for some worlds, others left blank (and will not be detailed 
later).

6. No official data published.

To vote, send me a message (NOT to the TML) with the word \'vote\' in the 
subject. In the body, list the option number you prefer. I\'ll post the 
results at the end of the month.

   Just for clarification, the weapon of choice among most Post Office
employees is not the M-16 (the full automatic, military version of the AR-15,
a 5.56 mm assault rifle).  Typically they use hand guns--I\'m not sure if
semi-autos or revolvers predominate, though my guess would be semi-autos.

   Also, if you had to deal with as much stress as the typical U.S. Postal
employee, from irate customers to unreasonable supervisors, you might be
tempted into looking for firearms too....

 If you haven\'t already, I might recommend that you take a look
 at GURPS Religions.  I thought it was quite well written, and
 gave reasonably good ideas for the creation of religions.  Most
 of the examples that they gave, however, felt very
 conventional.  Which might only mean that they did a _good_
 job.

I\'ve been following the discussion on what should be provided with great
interest. I am, personally, not the most creative person, however, I am
good at using published stuff for springboards. As a "compromise" between 
the two what I would like to see is a series of books devoted to the
different sectors. In an ideal (for me) situation they would be formatted
as follows

	A brief overview of the history, economics, and politics of the 
	sector as a whole.

	Each succeding chapter would then begin with the map of the 
	subsector is it about, the basic UPP information (maybe even
	the extented UPP rules I\'ve seen on the net) and then any 
	detail needed for particularlly significant world in the 
	sector (i.e. Sylea).

	A collection of NPCs

	A collection of notable institutions (i.e. notable corps et.al.)

	A collection of adventure hooks and suggestions.

This would, I think provide what we (as a very generalized group) need to
put the players in their places. Also, by limiting the books, The price per
book will be lower per book, but we would buy more books. Also, each book, 
if inexpensive enough, could cover a specific melieu or all, depnding on 
how IG wanted to set that up.

Shipping Dates
- ----

The hardcovers that were not signed by Marc Miller (that is, those 
that were ordered after July 1) will be shipped by Oct 25.  We have 
been in the process of shipping the books for several weeks now, but the 
process has been delayed by our inability to meet the tremendous demand 
we experienced.  Quite simply, we were caught unprepared.  We are making 
the changes necessary to ensure that we won\'t be caught unprepared again.

We are very sorry about the misunderstanding that was created by our  
statement (on the web site) regarding the books that were sent via Priority 
Mail several weeks ago.  We were unclear in stating that the books which we 
were referring to were those that were ordered prior to July 1 (the 
hardbacks signed by Marc Miller).

Thank you for sticking with us as we experience these growing pains.  


Starships and JTAS #25
- ----

In other news, Starships and JTAS 25 are off to the printer.  If you order 
Starships before November 15, you will receive a $5.00 coupon redeemable 
through our internet order store (http://www.imperiumgames.com) for 
future products. The coupon will be included in all Starships orders 
placed before November 15 (not just the ones placed after this date). The 
coupon will be good for one year.

I am surprised you got no responses at all. I may have gone into lurker mode at that time
Rest assured that most people on this list would (hopefully) not refuse to respond by 
blackballing.

I worked out most of the letters using DGP\'s Starship Operator\'s Handbook.
The illustrations in the middle had enough clues to start puzzling out
words.  (BTW: The panel under the gunner\'s chair has a vacc suit in it.)
There were a few characters missing, and I searched DGP stuff for any
additional hints.

No, but I hope it\'s true!  Love to put that on my Trav page...

There are. JTAS #22 has an article entitled "From Port to Jump-point"
which states "The jump 1 software may also provide for an in-system jump
to be made (sometimes referred to as jump-0). The rules are simple,
requiring that the in-system jump take fuel equal to jump-1...The time
it takes to complete that jump is 1 week."

With the re-publishing of the starship software rules in T4, the above
becomes valid again. (sounds of a 21 "canon" salute)

        Some people have been having a bit of trouble with their mail, too.
I\'ve been getting messages WAY out of order (try figuring out a reply to a
message you haven\'t seen), and I\'ve been getting some messages a dozen
times. It took four days for a message from work to reach my provider. And
it\'s not just my provider; I\'ve talked to others out here with different
providers and we\'re all having trouble.

        I never saw the chemical lasers post, for example. As for the
others, time doesn\'t permit me to even thoroughly read everything, much less
think about and comment. I skim most stuff. If it looks useful or
interesting I save it for later review. If it\'s very pertinent to what I\'m
doing now, or interested in, I read it carefully. But I delete 45 out of 50
messages after skimming them.

Hmmm, I talked to the lady at IG this morning, she that the one I ordered
before July 1, would shipped the Oct 25. Sounds like I am going to have to
give them a call, and put on my ASSHOLE hat!!!!!!!!!! Or that the info that
they gave you Joe is at best inaccurate to say the least. I also think that
you will find other members ordered the signed ones before July 1 and still
have not recieved their SIGNED copy!!!!!!!!!! This has truly been
interesting experience that does not bode well for IG.!!!!!!! Joe you might
want to turn on your Flaming Dampers to overdrive. I even recieved E-mail
from IG confirming my order and as to what I had ordered.!!!!

Well as to ordering Starships, after the timely delivery of SIGNED Hardback,
lets say I will pay the full price if it ever shows up.

Thanks for all the posts on the translation. For those of you interested
in such things...:-) ...there is a web pages which deals with the design
of a starship using current/near-current technologies...and one design
has already been completed (drawing board, that is). The page is

http://sunsite.unc.edu/lunar/starship.html

and is associated with a university in the United States. It\'s well
worth looking at!

Sam,

I was under the impression that all orders for signed hardbacks that 
were placed before July 1 had gone out long ago.  I was totally unaware 
that they had not all gone out - I thought it was only the unsigned 
hardbacks which were awaiting shipment.

Looks like I messed up again, because I am the one who inserted that 
bit.  I was attempting to make sure everything was clearly stated, yet I 
put something erroneous in there.

[sigh]

I\'m sorry to have angered you.  That wasn\'t my intent.

According to TNE\'s FF&S, "...The volume of each reload cradle is equal
to the volume of the missile carried multiplies by 1.5 and its price in
millions of credits is equal to its volume in cubic meters multiplied by
.0001."

And you\'re right about a turret being dead weight once it shoots its two
onboard missiles. That\'s why most large military vessels (in TNE at
least) would be designed with mechanical autoloaders and reload cradles.
It also an excellent case for merchants to carry additional "gunner\'s
mates".

>Also why only TL8 missiles and turrets?
> What happened to TL9,10,11 & 12?

I\'ve always thought that TL8 launching mechanisms were the epitome of
launching mechanisms simply because there wasn\'t any need to improve
beyond them. All that\'s necessary (IMO) is a link to arm/program the
sucker and something to kick it out the launch tube (assuming the
missile doesn\'t launch itself). Look at the Terrier missile launcher
hardware on the U.S. Ticonderoga-class missile cruiser. Of course, not
being anywhere close to an expert on missile launchers and not having
spent even a second in the Navy, I could be all wrong.

My lack of response was due to not having anything intelligent to add

objectionable in any way, all they have to do is delete them from their

I am no angry at you Joe. Just frustrated about not having my signed
hardbackafter after all this time. I also have been unable to get my local

Sorry to nikpick, the Ticonderoga has a VLS missile lauching systems.
Terrier missiles have not been much in use since the introduction of the
Standard 1 and 2 missiles. Unless you meant the Mk 26 system that the
Khomeni Class use. Yes you can improve the launching systems at higher tech
levels. A good example would be the Talos launcher verrsus the Mk 26. Vast
improvements were incorperated ignoring size differences in missiles.

Don\'t feel bad, Brad.  I spent days on getting the perfect task fix, and nobody had

Hi well I ordered my copy in the middle of June and did not get 
confirmation from IG till July. I have not recieved it yet. Now does 
this mean I am going to get a unsigned copy?

Please note that I said \'gaming convention\' and not just \'roleplaying game
convention\' -- the Essener Spieletage present all kinds of games -- from
kids games to roleplaying games to computer games to ancient chinese
strategy games and whatever else you can think.  I don\'t have the exact

While I can\'t contact IG over the weekend, I believe Sam Thomas said that 
IG confirmed that he will be receiving his signed copy, and he\'s in the 
same boat as you are.  This seems to mean that, for some reason, IG 
wasn\'t able to fill all of the orders for signed copies at once, but is 
supposed to do so by Oct 25 - at least, that\'s the latest date by which to 
get all the hardbacks out the door.

Heh.  Actually, I just copied the home page, and re-stated everything for 
what I thought was "clarity" but which in fact introduced 
that error about signed hardbacks. :(

But, yes, the homepage does mention the coupon and tries to clarify the 
Priority Mail question that some people have had based on the long-ago 
note on the web site regarding "the hardbacks are shipping via priority 
mail." 

Thanks,

<< From: Joe Walsh <ransom@connect.iconnect.net>

You\'ve raised a point which I\'ve found, recently, to be of interest.  
It\'s just a game, yet we get very angry about it at times.  It\'s 
wonderful that we all get so wrapped up in this game, but there is (as 
always) the negative side of that.

Heck, I remember how upset I was at the idea of basing T4\'s ship design 
system on FF&S.  I was actually *depressed* for a while when it became 
clear that, indeed, IG was doing what the gearheads wanted them to do.

That\'s weird, isn\'t it? >>

But understandable. I\'ve been playing (usually refereeing) Traveller for 
about 15 years now - that\'s *over half my life!* I\'ve met a lot of 
friends through it, and spend a horrifying amount of time and money on 
it. You can\'t go through all that without getting a pretty strong 
emotional attachment to something, and it\'s only natural to get upset 
when somebody tries to change it in ways you don\'t like.

<< Hmmm. But is that right?  Will we be forced to write some of it?  I 
was under the impression that IG was going to provide several 
pre-defined areas.  A couple subsectors here, a few there, etc., as time 
goes on. >>

But all, AIUI, with \'blank areas\'.

<< True, that isn\'t the whole-sector scenario we had with previous 
products.  But, it could be enough for a campaign.  Heck, most of my 
campaigns took place within six or seven worlds.  But then, I\'m probably 
atypical in that regard. >>

Possibly. The main part of my campaign was set in the Solomani Rim, and 
the PCs must\'ve visited every subsector at least once. Hey, the game is 
called \'Traveller\' after all!

<< Me?  What do I want?  Hmmm.

Well, no, I don\'t think it should be limited to the online world.  But, 
yes, I think it would be nice to get rid of the "official canon" 
mentality.  Yes...yes, I do. >>

But the background *is* the game! Let\'s face it, none of us are playing 
it because we think the rules are the best ever designed (they\'re okay, 
but they\'re not the reason for buying the game). We\'re playing because 
the wonderfully detailed history and background material provides a 
great environment in which to adventure. I could join in any Traveller 
game anywhere in the world - at a con, for example - and I could slot 
right in, because I already know the background. Ask any question you 
like - what colour are IISS uniforms? Why did the 3I expand Spinward? - 
and someone here will point you to an official answer, or make an 
educated guess. The more you start saying, \'well, this isn\'t really 
official\' or \'the ref can design this bit\', the more you lose that feel, 
and the more the game becomes just another generic space opera.

<< If BITS, CORE, Sword of the Knight, and/or Gold Rush Games comes out 
with, say, "The Spinward Marches Supplement" - fully defined and whatnot 
- - would that be a bad thing?  If IG does it, it will be viewed as 
"official canon."  If a third party does it...well, at least there\'s a 
chance people will see it as being optional. :) >>

I count any licensed product - the DGP stuff, for example - as canon.

<< I\'m willing to give the new policy a try.  I may or may not like it, 
after I\'ve used it for a while.  But, at this point, giving it try

<< From: Joe Walsh <ransom@connect.iconnect.net>

You\'ve raised a point which I\'ve found, recently, to be of interest.  
It\'s just a game, yet we get very angry about it at times.  It\'s 
wonderful that we all get so wrapped up in this game, but there is (as 
always) the negative side of that.

Heck, I remember how upset I was at the idea of basing T4\'s ship design 
system on FF&S.  I was actually *depressed* for a while when it became 
clear that, indeed, IG was doing what the gearheads wanted them to do.

That\'s weird, isn\'t it? >>

But understandable. I\'ve been playing (usually refereeing) Traveller for 
about 15 years now - that\'s *over half my life!* I\'ve met a lot of 
friends through it, and spend a horrifying amount of time and money on 
it. You can\'t go through all that without getting a pretty strong 
emotional attachment to something, and it\'s only natural to get upset 
when somebody tries to change it in ways you don\'t like.

<< Hmmm. But is that right?  Will we be forced to write some of it?  I 
was under the impression that IG was going to provide several 
pre-defined areas.  A couple subsectors here, a few there, etc., as time 
goes on. >>

But all, AIUI, with \'blank areas\'.

<< True, that isn\'t the whole-sector scenario we had with previous 
products.  But, it could be enough for a campaign.  Heck, most of my 
campaigns took place within six or seven worlds.  But then, I\'m probably 
atypical in that regard. >>

Possibly. The main part of my campaign was set in the Solomani Rim, and 
the PCs must\'ve visited every subsector at least once. Hey, the game is 
called \'Traveller\' after all!

<< Me?  What do I want?  Hmmm.

Well, no, I don\'t think it should be limited to the online world.  But, 
yes, I think it would be nice to get rid of the "official canon" 
mentality.  Yes...yes, I do. >>

But the background *is* the game! Let\'s face it, none of us are playing 
it because we think the rules are the best ever designed (they\'re okay, 
but they\'re not the reason for buying the game). We\'re playing because 
the wonderfully detailed history and background material provides a 
great environment in which to adventure. I could join in any Traveller 
game anywhere in the world - at a con, for example - and I could slot 
right in, because I already know the background. Ask any question you 
like - what colour are IISS uniforms? Why did the 3I expand Spinward? - 
and someone here will point you to an official answer, or make an 
educated guess. The more you start saying, \'well, this isn\'t really 
official\' or \'the ref can design this bit\', the more you lose that feel, 
and the more the game becomes just another generic space opera.

<< If BITS, CORE, Sword of the Knight, and/or Gold Rush Games comes out 
with, say, "The Spinward Marches Supplement" - fully defined and whatnot 
- - would that be a bad thing?  If IG does it, it will be viewed as 
"official canon."  If a third party does it...well, at least there\'s a 
chance people will see it as being optional. :) >>

I count any licensed product - the DGP stuff, for example - as canon.

<< I\'m willing to give the new policy a try.  I may or may not like it, 
after I\'ve used it for a while.  But, at this point, giving it try 
sounds worthwile. >>

Pierre,

In fact, you are correct.  There is no such game.  It is all a conspiricy 
by the Third Imperium, crafted to influence loyal Solomanis such as 
yourself to abandon your benevolent government in favor of their decadent 
one.
  
I\'ve been noting the names of those who have claimed to have this book - 
whether in "hardcover" or "softcover" chip format - and you can be 
assured that this information is being reported to SolSec.  You are 
advised to consider all those who claim to have that book to be Imperial 
spies. 

Keep the faith, and keep the race pure!

I ran into a similar situation with a very short campaign in college (or
at University for those down under. :-) ). I ended up designating the
rules lawyer as my associate Referee; he kept track of the tiny details
during a run while I kept track of the overall adventure. Since he was
part of the "PC group", he kinda got caught between a rock and a hard
place when his detailing started working for the NPCs, too. And nobody
could complain since "it\'s in the rules". To paraphrase Sun Tzu, "use
your opponent\'s strength against him."

Ok, but what I was trying to ask referred to the missiles themselves 
shouldn\'t they improve as the tech level increases? By this I mean the 
targating componenents, ECM, destructive power, size needed, cost etc. 
as the tech improves so should the missiles <shrug>

Any ship with 30% of its tonnage dedicated to fuel tankage could do it. The
first jump is made with drop tanks. In fact, using collapsible tanks any
ship with 10% fuel tankage and at least 20% cargo space could do it. So
the answer to your question is: every cargo ship in the Imperium plus any
specially designed scout ships. Besides, the early Imperium is TL 12. That
means that the Sylean Federation was at least TL 11, which means that 
jump-2 ships would be common. Using drop tanks _any_ jump-2 ship can cross
a 1-parsec gap and be back in two weeks.

BTW. I was under the impression that the new technology that makes the
Imperium Top Dog is not jump-3 (that has been known since before the Rule
of Man) but Fusion+. Am I wrong there? Joe, did the Syleans lose jump-3 
technology during the Long Night?

OK, you got me. How could the fall of civilization affect hydrographic
percentages and Gas Giants? Please explain.

Agreed. Which is why I would advocate publishing such long unvisited
worlds as, f.ex., ?678???-?.

You could try Dirtside II for mass combat and Stargrunt (II?) for man-to-man

Right! What do you tell a player who says that his character has counted
out the Cr. 20,000 for this fortnight\'s overhead and asks: "Now, who do
I pay the money to, and what does he give me in return?"

IMO. any world that is not actually interdicted already has access to that

Citizens:

The traitor known as "Amused to Death" has turned out to be a highly 
skilled and effective spy.  He was able to elude our SolSec agents, and 
is now on the run.  

Please remain calm.  You are in no danger.  However, due to the nature of 
this incident, we have been forced to announce that it is necessary to 
institute a new policy regarding freedom of movement.  Honest citizens 
will be affected in only the slightest of ways.  

When one of the friendly SolSec agents being dispatched thoughout the

way, please show full cooperation.  

With your loyal assistance, we will aprehend this renegade traitor.

We will continue to update you as information becomes available.

5.6% compounded quarterly, without taxes or insurance. You\'re right, the
interest rates are very low...compared to our modern Keynesian
economies. But they may make sense if you assume that there is no
inflation in the Imperium. Or that growth is very slow. Both of these
assumptions are easy to make given our knowlege of imperial history.

And I never figured feudal Imperialists to be the Keynesian types
anyway. It\'s more likely they\'re sticklers for the "Lanthanum Standard"
or somesuch.

But if you\'re attached to Keynesian monetary systems, then you can
postulate special subsidies by governments or corporations. Heck, Mazda
is financing my new car at 5.5% interest over six years. They\'re doing
that because they expect me to trade it in (for another Mazda only,
since they hold the title) in three years. And they want to insure my
repeat business.

Not quite true. I don\'t have a problem with SOME unpleasant worlds having a 
larger population than SOME pleasant worlds. What I object to is all worlds, 
regardless of habitability, having the exact same population distribution. 
3% of them have 0-9 people, 7% of them have 10-99 people, etc.
 
I also have a problem with pleasant worlds having NO population whatsoever.

But it is reflected in real life here on Earth. There are more people
living in areas with decent farmland than there are people living in 
mountains and in the arctic. If your assertation were correct then why
isn\'t one 7th of the world\'s population living on the Antarctic
continent?

But that\'s exactly my point. If you have the choice of setting up a new
colony on a world where you can breathe the air and grow your own food
and one where you need expensive protection from the environment, which
one would you choose?

And of course quality of life counts for _something_. You may prefer to
live in a hell-hole if you can earn two or three times what you could
earn in a pleasant place, but if the difference is only 10 or 20 % then
you might well choose the less economic, but more pleasant, alternative.
I certainly would.

But only if someone else wants to live in Aspen. If the worlds are empty 
in the first place, why not choose the pleasant one?

Again, you need someone living there in the first place for this to be a
factor. A pleasant world with populations in the millions is cool
(provided there is an associated planet with an economy strong enough to 
build the navy you\'d need to protect it) but pleasant worlds with
populations in the tens are not. Such a world would be so valuable that
you\'d need to own several others personally in order to afford NOT to
develop it. So a few Imperial reservations are OK, but definitely not
too many.

>So if you find that Traveller\'s population distributions don\'t make much
>sense to you, I\'d say that you might be working from faulty assumptions.

My assumptions may or may not be faulty, but Traveller\'s assumptions 
definitely are. Any assumptions that makes the population distributions on 
Terran-norm worlds EXACTLY the same as on worlds with insidious atmospheres 
are faulty.

I can understand how you might be a wee bit frustrated at this point.  
[grin]  It\'s gonna be great once all the T4 hardbacks are in the proper 
hands.  Then, we can all start working on the type of projects that have

systems.  It\'ll be great when everyone can participate in the efforts to

Ah. You\'re absolutely correct. Not only should them but in TNEs Fire,
Fusion, & Steel design book, they did. The nuclear warheads became more
powerful, sensors decreased in size, etc. Hopefully, these and other TL
based improvements will be resurrected in the more detailed ship design
system promised by IG. I would admit to
being a gearhead but I\'m not; I\'m a Traveller who believes in stacking
the deck in my favor, if possible.

My thinking is it wasn\'t the fall itself but possibly the cause of the
fall. Say, carpet bombing with megatons of nukes from orbit, major
vulcanism, or massive forest fires.  Other than that, I\'m at a loss
myself. After all, how much did the collapse of the Roman Empire affect
the level of the oceans?

This is probably not accurate... Earth-like worlds probably ought to have
some kind of bonus to population rolls.  However, there are a lot of
reasons why a nasty world might have a higher population than a \'perfect\'
world.

>I also have a problem with pleasant worlds having NO population whatsoever.

Climate, hydrographics, etc... are only one part of a world.  Perhaps
the world has really, really dangerous predators.  Perhaps all the of
the animal and plant life on the planet is dangerous.  Perhaps the plant
life on the planet is totally inedible and edible crops are hard to
grow for some reason.  The few people there could be slowly expanding
the food supply.  Maybe the sunlight is a weird color which people
find unpleasant.  Myabe there\'s a lot of asteroid activity and folks
don\'t like getting rocks dropped on their heads.

Well, Antarctica is smaller than some of the other continents.  :)
Actually, there are a lot of other exampls of people living in less
pleasant places.  New York City has a population of around 18 million
and it\'s not a nice place... cold and snowy and crowded.  The whole
state of Colorado has a low population and it\'s a nice place.  People
go where jobs are a lot of the time...

Also, trade routes are important.  Availability of off-world supplies
could be important.  Protection by the Navy could also be an important
factor.  Also, you have to find a source of colonists... it could be
that people in the neighboring star systems are happy where they are
or can\'t move.

As soon as the nice world is discovered, the wealthy will probably
move there first and buy up as much land as possible.  Some will live
there while others may be developers, building whole towns to get folks
to move.  Depending on who buys it, there may never be that many
people there.  The wealthy may all buy estates the size of a small
state.

The easy solution is to not just roll on the tables but to make the
worlds up with some eye to what you want them to be like.  The tables
shouldn\'t be used to create worlds you plan on using as major worlds.
I think Traveller probably goes to far in making *everything* some
multiple of 6 so you can roll it... sometimes seems kind of artificial
sometimes.  (Hmm... ships are *all* limited to 6 g\'s?  But I want to
stick that heavy-cruiser\'s maneuver drive on my scout ship...)

Depends on how much of it collapsed into the oceans themselves, as opposed to simply

Here\'s an improved version of a Hit Location Table I posted to TML a few
weeks ago. James Garriss pointed out some problems with my original,
corrected in this version (thanks for the help, Jim!). In the original, the
probability distribution was fairly even - that is, every region of the
body had an equal chance of being hit - which is not true to actual
battlefield injuries. Hits should tend to cluster in the torso, at least
for most attacks.

But a purely random distribution is still useful, especially for wounds
from explosives, zero-gravity accidents, or other random injury. Therefore,
this table allows for both distributions: Roll on the first column for most
attacks, the second for a more random hit. (Of course, other distributions
are possible; for instance, hits from long hand-weapons such as clubs,
cutlasses, and foils, will tend to cluster towards the upper and lower
extremes of the body, especially if the defender is also armed.)

I\'ve also added an "incidental" hit: two sixes represent a hit to some item
worn or carried by the character - a belt buckle, a weapon, a pocket
computer, etc. Roll again for the location and select an item likely to be
carried in that area; thus an "upper torso" hit from behind might strike an
item in a backpack. The referee should then decide on the item\'s armor
value, if any, and from that determine if it deflects the hit, lowers the
damage dice, or has no effect. (It helps if the referee has required the
players to pre-assign locations for all items carried or worn.)

Also, the hit locations are now arranged roughly from the feet (65) up to
the head (11). This allows the referee to apply a DM to the location roll -
usually adding or subtracting from the first digit, or from the second
digit for a more subtle influence. This is useful if the defender\'s legs
are behind cover, or if he is being attacked from directly above, or any
situation which will tend to weight locations higher or lower on the body. 

Building on this, I\'ve added a nifty new house rule for splitting skill
levels between "to hit" rolls and location rolls. (See bottom of post).

Do let me know if you plan to use the table in your game, or if you find
any errors in the system.

Hope you like,

Glenn
- ----

Hit Location Table

For every successful hit, roll two dice, pre-selecting one die as "tens"
and the second as "ones". Roll on the first column for most ranged attacks
(weighted towards the chest), on the second for more random injury (such as
from explosives). A Spectacular Success on a roll to hit allows the
attacking player to select the hit location from the table.

Then roll damage, reducing dice if location is armored.

If no stats are reduced to zero by the hit, see "Superficial" for any
secondary effects of the wound.

If 1 stat is reduced to 0, see "Minor" wound effect. Minor Wound effects
such as fractures (Frac) and impaired organs (Impd) are temporary and will
heal completely with proper medical attention.

If 2 stats are reduced to 0, see "Major" wound effect. Even with proper
medical attention, Major Wound effects can result in the character being
permanently impaired, depending on the Tech Level of the medical facility.

When rolling damage, any roll of two sixes is a Critical Hit, which is
counted as a Major Wound, even if no stats are reduced to 0.

Generally, effects are cumulative: if a Major Wound is received,
Superficial and Minor effects are also applied.

Generally, hits are received on the side nearest the attacker. When needed,
roll 1D for Right (1-3) or Left (3-6).

Impd = Impaired function (see above).
Conc = Brain concussion. Either mild, causing headaches, or
        serious, causing migraines, dizzyness, seizures, etc.
        Severity increases if character loses consciousness.
Lung = Lung puncture, causes additional damage. Usually
        accompanied by fractured ribs.
Throat = Throat wound impairs breathing, causes additional damage.
Intl  = Internal organ hit, causes additional damage.
Brain = At referee\'s discretion, effects may include partial
        or total paralysis, coma, speech impairment, blindness,
        personality change, seizures, etc, depending on amount of
        damage taken and swiftness of medical attention. 
Spine = Almost always causes paralysis. Extent and severity to
        be determined by referee.
Heart = Heart injury causes additional damage. Usually
        accompanied by fractured ribs.
Artery = Major artery hit, causes additional damage.
Amp   = Potential amputation; if large amount of damage received in
        a single hit, amputation might occur, at referee\'s 
        discretion. If so, character receives further 1 to 3 pts 
        damage per subsequent round until medical attention 
        received. Energy weapon hits do not incur extra damage,
        as the wound is automatically cauterized.

Referee should use judgement at all times to determine specific
location/effects. For instance, a Superficial Wound to "cranium/ear" is
clearly a glancing hit close to the ear, whereas a Minor or Major Wound
could mean skull fracture, impaired hearing, or concussion, perhaps all
three, depending on the amount of damage received.

If the "Stopping Power" house rule is being used, head and leg hits incur a
negative DM when charcter rolls to remain standing. Any roll of two ones is
a Spectacular "Success" - in which case the character not only remains
standing, but is not immediately aware that he or she has been hit,
regardless of the amount of injury sustained!

For hits from automatic fire, shotguns, or explosives, it is generally
assumed that the rolled hit location is for the most serious of a group of
wounds (which are not rolled).
 
Separate Hit Location tables should be prepared for each non-humanoid
sophont species.

============================

House rule: Skill Assignment

A character may choose to divide combat skill levels between the roll to
hit and the location roll, instead of applying all levels to the roll to
hit. Thus, a PC with Pistol 4 may choose to have a +2 DM to hit, and a +2
or -2 DM to the first digit of the location roll, raising it to aim high
(for more critical locations) or lowering it to aim low (to knock down, or
to mimimize damage). This rule does not necessarily replace the T4 "Aimed
Shots" rule.

        I appreciate your responses to my cry for help.  At least I now I\'m
not going CRAZY!!.   

A few ideas and questions>>>

I\'m currently developing a campaign however a large part of it is going to
involve a new minor alien species.  If anyone out there likes to think up
new species I would appreciate help fleshing it out (off the list).  You
see, I have the basic idea for the aliens but being the GM I want to make
sure I create a balanced alien (not to powerful or it would conflit with the
T4 storyline).  
- ----
I\'m working on incorporating Combat Enviroment Suits and Chemical Cartridge
Lasers into my T4 campaign (in the works).  However I\'ve run into a few
problems.  First if anyone has access to FFS perhaps you can tell me the
answer to the following.  Did Chemical lasers work of of individual
cartridges (where each cartridge held enough charge for one blast) thus
rounds.  Or was it one cartridge.  In other words was the PP a Chemical
Battery or Chemical Bullets.  
- ----
Another question

As an alternative technology has anyone thought of power crystals?

I believe modern day watch quartz crystals generate something like 5 mV of
power.  Well If Earth is currently tech 8 by tech 12 a lot of advances could
have taken place in the studies of the piazo effect (pressure on crystols
creating voltage).  The danger threshold in killing someone is around 30 V
and .005 mA.  The ability that is used in traveller to compress oxygen could
be used on some future \'quartz\' crystals to generate adequate voltage for
personal energy weapons or say guass weapons.  The big bonus here is that
the power supply would last longer than your average chemical cartridge (I
think).  Any thoughts.

PS.
        I was working with someone one the list on a "hush-hush" project.
Unfortunaly I\'ve lost this individual\'s website and e-mail address.  If this

them.  Thanks.

Per FF&S, "Powering a laser by chemical laser cartridge (CLC) allows the
laser to function in the fashion of a conventional firearm or artillery
piece, in that each shot consumes an ammunition cartridge, whose empty 
casing is then ejected allowing the laser to be reloaded and fired
again."

Sounds like a Chemical Bullet to me. Keep in mind that FF&S allowed
lasers to have their firing pulses varied, effectively exchanging a
higher number of pulses (and a greater chance to hit) for a reduction in
damage per pulse.

I believe that\'s "piezo" as in piezoelectricity. (nit,nit) Regardless,
this is one I don\'t think anyone, including GDW and DGP, thought of. The
closest anyone\'s come was the description in FF&S of cold fusion as
"piezo-nuclear fusion".  Could gravitic fields and ultra-high pressure
tanks be used to enhance this effect? If so, to what level and what are
the effects of a sudden release of pressure?

A chem laser cartridge has X amount of energy; it is the weapon that determines just how 
the energy is split into pulses. Call it a chemical battery.

In my military electronics class, they told us that it was _current_ that killed. 30KV 
at 5 mA _usually_ won\'t kill, but 30V at 100 mA will. The lethal threshold depends upon 
a lot of factors; the resistance of the human body is wildly variable.

Suppose that a synthetic crystal could generate useful pizeo voltages (say 30 V (rms) at 
1500 mA) from ordinary human movement. You wear the crystal array on your belt and the 
array generates the electrical power to drive a homopole generator to drive that DEI 
laser or gauss gun ;)

I emailed it to Peter Miller.  I think he\'s going to contact the 
individuals who wrote them, and get their permission to put it on his

I have to second this - I often say nothing simply because I have
nothing intelligent to say and posting "Yeah!" seems a bit trite.
It\'s ironic that only the ill-conceived or really controversial
posts ever get discussed. All the well thought out ones that contain
noting to argue about are met with silence for applause (??).

Anyways, it happens to everyone. Happens to me a lot.

On the other hand, the relative velocities are a lot higher here. We
are *not* going to get shots "glancing off". Any impact will result in
an explosion as the bullet and a good chunk of armor vaporize each other.

So a "low tech" orbital fort could use them as part of the weaponry. :-)

Well, to start with, oxygen requirements depend on what partial
pressure of oxygen the being is used to. Humans need 3 psi of oxygen,
and use a certain amount of O2 per minute depending on metabolic rate
and body mass. 

But other creatures on earth require different amounts of O2 per kilo
of body mass. And creatures from other worlds may have other rates of
usage. 

Rate at which O2 can be taken from the air depends on the surface area
of the lungs. Which is why our lungs are so convoluted.

I think that the critical factors *may* be body mass *and* metabolic
rate. It\'s that last one that\'s going to drive us nuts.

You forget that air circulation as well as heating and cooling use
non-trivial amounts of power. Also, you are paying for water
*purification* and waste disposal/treatment. And then we get to air....

Depending on how you go about it air supply or recycling could have
costs that vary all over the place.

Hmm. So Jump Missile Message drones (in a licensed product) *are* canon?
And using Black Globes/Capacitors to power Jumps (from "High Guard") *are*
canon? And chemical lasers (from TNE/FF&S) *are* canon? And *both* HePlaR
*and* Thruster Plates, despite being mutually exclusive in TNE, are
"canon" ... as are the one year power supply for thruster plates *and* the
30/90 power supply (CTrav and MTrav).

Seems to me the "canon" is a load of old cobblers. It\'s always been
whatever has been convenient for the designers, rather than what makes
sense based on what has been previously published. It seems that even if
it directly and completely contradicts everything on the matter that has
gone before said designers give not one whit of a good goddamn *if* it
suits their purposes. Effectively, there *is* no canon - except what Marc
Miller and the designers at Imperium Games decide there is - and their
decisions *automatically* supercede anything that went before.

  You shouldn\'t. While a company may license another company to produce
products "for use with" their game, it is not necessarily "official," or as
some of you put it, "canon." For instance, we have a license from Hero Games
to produce material for use with the Hero System (Champions, Fantasy Hero,
etc.), but our material is not considered "official" by Hero Games. It\'s more
like "optional." ;)

  By the same token, Marc Miller has told me that our Traveller material will
not be official. Well, not automatically. The good news is that Marc told me
that since he has to review any and all material we intend to publish, he
could very well give it that FarFuture seal of approval and designate it
"official Traveller material." Now that would certainly be a compliment, IMO.

  In any case, I digress. Not all licensed material should be considered
canon.

Well, what *I* tell them is, "Make the check out to \'Starport Authority,
Maintenance Division\' ", and once they do, a cargo lifter pulls up to their
docking berth and several replenishment techs come aboard, bringing aboard
all your new food supplies, changing out your air filters (if you only
change them at annual maintenance, I hope you like that "locker-room
fragrance"), replenishing your supplies of essentials for the lifesystem,
getting rid of the assorted crud you\'ve filtered out of the biological
recyclers and don\'t particularly want to have around, performing routine
maintenance chores and adjustments, stocking you up on neat stuff like soap
and laundry detergents and cleansers (you *better* clean the \'fresher in
those High Passage cabins, or you\'ll never get another repeat passenger!),
performing cleaning chores that you wouldn\'t be able to do with only onboard
equipment, or with passengers onboard...

You\'re going to have food that goes bad, and needs to be replaced, other
fungibles that need restock, and minor maintenance that just can\'t wait, and
that a regular commercial ship wouldn\'t be able to do from its own
resources. Plus, you want to have lots of *variety* in a lot of these
things, to account for different tastes.

Of course, if you really *want* to skimp on this amount...     :)


"Bologna sandwiches AGAIN???? Mr. Purser, I\'d like a word with you..."

<grin> Well, to nitpick your nitpick, I think the Ticonderoga, as well as a
few of the other very first Aegis cruisers didn\'t have the VLS installed...
but the vast majority of the class *do*, as do all the Arleigh Burkes.

Still.... is this a reflection of an advance in technology, and one great
enough to warrant a tech level increase, or is it just more efficient design
of the same tech level? And would such improvements be significant enough to
warrant the rules fiddling necessary to reflect them? If the major
limitation in firing a missile is acquiring an adequate targeting lockon,
will shaving 10 seconds or so off the reload time make any difference? Most
of my perspective on this comes from a CT perspective, so I don\'t know what
changes FF&S made, but will any average user pack enough missiles that a
fractional rate-of-fire increase affects the end result?

I think there is another way to look at canon in traveller.  You are
right about it changing with the weather in terms of rules.  I think
it is better to look at what *hasn\'t* changed.  Anything that stayed
the same is "real" canon.  Some things stayed the same in spite of
rules to the contrary.  FFS wiped out all space combat canon.  All
of it.  But all the TNE published ships looked like CT ships, even
though they were stupid designs in FFS (without fixes).  So the
designers made the ships have the right feel in spite of their own
new rules for how to make them!  That\'s why so many flaws never got
found in FFS/BL, et al.  The test ships were in the spirit of the
canon, but the rules for making them weren\'t.

I agree though that there is a lot of room for slop in our work
since the canon is all over the place.  The trick is to stay in the
spirit of things, which most of us seem to implicitly agree on.

I know this is a little late for this thread but my expience with living in
a "small" room is as follows.  Check out the living conditions on the
various retired warships displayed around the US.  Drive a tractor-trailer
(or check out one of the nicer big bunk trucks and you\'ll be surprised at
what you can fit into such a small space. And finally look at a cabin
cruiser at your local boat dealer, Any of those will give you a good idea at
what to expect for accomodations in my opinion.  I always thought a starship
stateroom was small until I lived in a truck for a few years!

Being of a rather sedentary lifestyle, I want details on a uniform for
an X-Boat pilot. Like me, they\'d tend to be under-excercised. :-)

A friend collects German WWII stuff. We once got quite a shock when he
got an SS Major\'s uniform and it turned out to fit a mutual friend as
if it had been tailored for him!

After putting up *lots* of "collateral" he got to wear it to a
Halloween party. This majorly freaked people. You see, he\'s a cop.... :-)

Yeah, the equivalent of the "good conduct medal" is probably pretty
safe. 

One other "safe" source of medals are the "political" ones from the
USSR and "Eastern block". There are a *lot* of medals there that tended
to get handed out for being a good Party member, or just "in favor".
Even so, stay away from that simple gold star on a red ribbon. The
folks who *earned* that one rank right up there with the CMoH.

One *major* detail that\'s overlooked in the above. What *scale* is this
happening on? Are we talking individual worlds, sub-sectors, or
sectors? At the sector or subsector level, it\'s great, because it gives
a ref an area he can use for his own stuff without getting it stomped
by official stuff. And as long as the areas are placed carefully, folks
that don\'t want to detail things on their own can just avoid it.
Players *can* be told "there\'s no official info for those areas, some
we aren\'t going to play there". And most will understand and stick to
the areas you have info on.

Individual worlds on the other hand would be a major pain for everybody.

Not really. Interstellar space isn\'t *that* empty. With a bit of work
and a good set of sensors, you should be able to find *something*
within range. And even a *small* "comet" is more unrefined fuel than
your ship could use in years. 

Of course, if your manuever drive is shot, you\'ve had it. But if
it\'s working, you can likely rendezvous with some sort of iceball.

They actually gave a figure somewhere. They said something along the
lines of "assume a ship has enough fuel for a month without refueling"
or something like that.

Consider the number of stars in "known space" (ie the old map of
"everything"). Now consider the number of planets, moons, asteroids,
etc in all those star systems. 

Folks will run out of "fancy" names fast. Heck, check the IAU
(International Astronomical Union) rules for naming. It\'s at the point
where if you discover an asteriod, you can name it after your cat as
long as the name doesn\'t conflict...

But this is not me. I\'ll point out things "Did you forget about this?",

with it.

Please do!

Also, what sort of thing would you guess a typical *amateur* astronomer
is capable of at various tech levels? I\'m thinking of not just the guys
on Earth-like planets, but also those on space colonies or living on
vacuum worlds or asteroid belts. 

Besides things like a Dobsonian scope on a vacuum world, I\'m wondering
about stuff like spin stabilized liquid metal mirrors, thin film
mirrors, and *large* collectors. A 16 year old belter kid at TL-12
ought to have gear that current astronomers would *kill* for. Like
multi-spectral interferometers with light-second or better baselines.

Or picture the kid that has refurbished the one-km aluminized film
mirror from a defunct asteroid smelting operation and is using it as a
telescope! Sure, it\'s not smooth enough to be any good at optical
wavelengths, but at longwave IR down into the microwave region, it\'d
work great. 

And I can see networks of amateurs doing parallax measurements with
baselines of whatever the orbital diameter of the belt is, or in
systems with well established colonies in the outer orbits, even
*longer* baselines. Think of what amatuers could do if some of them
*lived* in the leading and trailing Trojans here in the Solar system!
What\'s that? A 10 AU baseline?

Of course, their efforst would be dwarfed by things like the Imperial
Survey baselines I described a few months back. Parsec long baselines
for parallax and maybe even some sort of interferometry if the tech is
up to it.

There are several ways of dealing with this. One would be to say that
your realspace vector has some bearing on your jumpspace vector. But
that gets *real* ugly.

So let\'s work up some pseudo-science.

First off, I\'d say that unless you do something special, you have the
same velocity vector upon emerging from jump as when entering. This
does the least violence to normal phsyics. On the downside, it means
that you have to deal with the velocity difference between the system
you left and the system you are entering. 

Now, the question is *if* you can somehow use the jump to change this
vector. If yes, we need to restrict it, otherwise it could be used to
jump into a system at a *very* high velocity for the purpose of dumping
deadfall ordanance on a planet. Not good.

Second, is the question of whether or not sensor readings of a jumping
ship (or an arriving one) will give you some idea of the direction or
distance of the jump.

I think that we could do just leave it at "you keep the vector, and
can\'t change it". This would mean that most ships would take a course
that gave them a favorable vector for their destination by the time
they reached the required distance for jumping. Thus ships destined for
a specfic system would tend to have a predictable heading. 

Of course it\'s a *bit* more complex than this. You can do some matching
at the other end, but that uses more fuel. And the velocities depend on
not only the relative velocities of the stars, but of the planets you
are moving between.

It *does* allow for lots of fun with "zero" jumps, and short jumps.
Including the old trick from H. Beam Piper\'s "Space Viking" where you
are supposedly trading with a star system several parsecs off, but
actually are just jumping to the outer system where you have a hidden
base. :-)

Ok mini ice age starts, terraforming efforts collapse or succeed, the 
afformention mass orbital bombardment (with relativistic rocks:-).For 
atmopshere taints or others, perhaps the industrial pollution has 
stoppede due to collapse of industrial inforstucture. Or the natives have 
cleaned up their act+invented new anti pollution tecnologies. Volcanos 
could have stopped outgassing. In fact this is what happened in the TNE
World Tamers Handbook, a world which was previously only of marginal

This is a truly cool piece of software and all you PC types should run out

charts & schematics, and survey reports, sociological reports, planet maps,
atmosphere details, distance to horizon, tech levels, law levels, customs,
major cities, trade details, animal encounters, the whole kit and kaboodle.
Command-G gets you the works

        Rob, I am truly impressed.  Two comments: a) system charts and
schematics are a little big; all that scrolling is a minor pain, and b) if
you could set it up so that the user could hammer in his own additions to
the customs list etc.

But irregardless of the amount, the power comes from the ship\'s power plant
and that\'s accounted for elsewhere.

If my ship lands on the surface of a world then I\'m paying for tap water.
It takes an awfully thirsty passenger to drink up ("process" ;-) 1800
credits worth of water...

Indeed. That\'s why it would be nice to know just what you get for your
Cr 2000. Most PC-owned ships run on a shoestring budget. Being able to
cut corners may be important to them. But you can\'t do that if you don\'t
know what the corners _are_. If money is tight then being required to
burn ca. Cr 18,000 is rather irritating for a player.

Of course, it may be a sacrifice to the Gods of Jumpspace to ensure a
safe trip. Yeah, that makes sense...

Several, eh? How many? 5? For how long? 8 hours? That would cost about Cr 100
in wages. Not 100 per stateroom but 100 in all.

Cr 100 per crew, Cr 70 per passenger...

One air filter per passenger and crew carried? Not all the air filters
at once? And what does an air filter cost? And why can\'t the Engineer
change them?

What are they and what do they cost?

Why can\'t the crew get rid of that? Is it toxic? Radioactive?

I thought the crew did that.

How much would that be? Cr 10? 20?

Hardly a concern for most Free Traders.

Like what?

>You\'re going to have food that goes bad, and needs to be replaced, 

You can REPLACE the food a passenger eats in 14 days for Cr100. Having
10% of it spoil wouldn\'t put a dent in the budget, and with modern food
preservation methods, let alone futuristic, that is highly unlikely.

>other fungibles that need restock, and minor maintenance that just can\'t

But the rule dosen\'t say "Cr 2000 per occupant if you want to run a
regular passenger ship" it says "Cr 2000 per occupant, period". Besides,
even a regular passenger ship dosen\'t pay for nothing.

>Plus, you want to have lots of *variety* in a lot of these
>things, to account for different tastes.

Superficially plausible, but look at the figures again. Cr 200 will buy
you a month\'s groceries. Good food, mark you. Not luxuries, but not
subsistence crud either. I don\'t know just what that is in 1996 US$, but
translated into Danish kroner it comes to something like the equivalent
of $250. That means this maintenance costs you $2500 per passenger (not
per stateroom, mind you, which would be the case in your scenario).
Deduct $250 for 9 days of food, detergent and toilet paper, and you\'re
paying $2250 per stateroom for a quick clean-up. You may believe that;
my players wouldn\'t.

You\'re making a very good point here, even if you don\'t know it. The PCs
should be allowed to make that choice. You should impose appropiate
penalties for such skimping... but in role-playing terms, not a blanket,
non-negotiable fee. I mean,  I don\'t mind the locals on a space station
or a desert planet stiffing a captive customer over some very expensive
water or the SMWU (Spaceship Maintenance Workers Union) in a Class A
Starport gouging them over a spring cleaning, but such things should be
something the players could anticipate and deal with. Stocking up on
canned goods when they get a good deal, skipping a cleaning until they
get to a Class C starport (or doing it themselves) etc. It might even
make a good lure or reward. 10 cases of air filters at half price, say,
instead of a cash reward.

One final question: Is it 2000 _local_ credits per occupancy or 2000
Crimp (Credits Imperial) per occupancy?

Oh sure. I don\'t want a correlation of 1 between habitability and population.
That would be almost as unrealistic as the present correlation of 0. But I do
think there ought to be _some_ correlation.

All of this is possible, and I\'ve used many of them myself. What I object
to is the frequency they appear at. Besides, I have difficulty imagining
many menaces that are more expensive to deal with than corrosive and
insidious atmospheres. Some, sure, but it gets tedious in the long run.

Yeah, but you\'re overlooking the first step in that chain: Jobs appear
where people go. And other things being equal they will go to pleasant
places rather than unpleasant ones. New York City was a pleasant spot
once.

Yes, but the present system dosen\'t address that at all. Believe me, I
know! I\'m working on the early history of the Spinward Marches right now,
and on the trade route from Mora to the Sword Worlds there are THREE
Terran-norm or Terran-prime planets with implausibly low populations.

You know, that is actually _my_ argument you\'re using there. What you
describe is why I maintain that most nice planets will have decent
populations. 

>Depending on who buys it, there may never be that many people there.  

Yes, but let\'s keep a sense of proportion here. To leave a planet fallow
(ie. not generating income for the owner) for receational purposes, the
owner must be rich enough to own a few planets that do generate income.
To leave a continent unused you have to own a few productive continents,
etc. 

>The wealthy may all buy estates the size of a small state.

Which would put the population of an Earth-like planet into the hundreds 
to start with. Add  the service staff such a wealthy man would want and
you\'re into the tens of thousands at least... propably the 100,000s (if
you owned a small state, wouldn\'t you want at least 1000 employees? Hey,
the "personal services" staff alone would account for the first order of
magnitude ;-)

My solution is to spend 10 minutes trying to come up with an explanation
for any bizarre UPP and then changing it if I can\'t.  (It\'s surprising
how often I do come up with something. But on occasion it does become a
stress...)

I\'m not saying I can\'t deal with the problem. I just disagree with those
who says that there is no problem to deal with in the first place.

There\'s no need to come up with new/non-canon technology, actually.
I and others have been using a scaled-down version of the Zuchai
crystals as storage batteries.  I don\'t remember who the original
poster was but he called them zuchacells, arguing that you didn\'t
need all the bulky gear to keep the energy flow constant and stuff.
If you can\'t find it in the archives I can try finding it in my own.
:)

	The neat thing about zuchai crystals is that they \'record\'
the power input/fluctuations, so instead of needing big regulators on
the battery side, you can just charge the cell at the required
output.  Also neat is that you can (with some spit and chewing gum)
turn the zuchai crystal into an actual recording device/low-grade
data crystal.

	I have not seen any canon regarding the scaling down of
zuchai crystals anywhere.  I really hope that the new equipment
catalog contains neat new hi-tech equipment. :)

  IIRC, in CT it was stated that the Prime Rate in Imperial Space was 2%,
because of a very stable economy (possibly such transactions are
subsidized by the Imperium to encourage interstellar trade)

  If this is so, 4% (including taxes and insurance) would seem to be in
line.

        Yeah... something that\'s worth checking out for inspiration is the
annual Sail magazine Buyers\' Guide issue.  Comes with interior layouts
(i.e. deckplans) for literally hundres of small, medium, and bloody huge
sailboats.  It\'s really amazing how much in the way of amenities you can
shoehorn into a small space.

You know, your right.  My electronics book here says 30 V and .005A is
dangerous not lethal.  Current is what kills you.  The 30 volts is because:
at that voltage the resultant current is usually dangerous to lethal. 

FYI:

For those that don\'t know Electricity for the most part is governend by Ohms
law.  E=IR
E= Voltage in Volts
I=Current in Amps
R=Resistance in Ohms

Typical dry skin has a resistance of between 100,000 ohms and 300,000 ohms.
Wet skin reduces this resistance to approxiamatly 1000 ohms.  According to
the Textbook

Heres the effects on the body at varing currents. 

Amps     Effect
.002     Mild Shock
.01      Cannot let go of what your holding
.02      Breathing difficult, Muscular spasms
.05      Breathing severely inhibited, Suffocation
.12      Heart Stops 
.3       Severe Burns, Lungs stop completely

Now for some examples.  Your electric toothbrush operates at around .09 amp
your lightbulb is normally at 1 amp.  

The above goes to show it wouldn\'t take a whole lot to both kill you and to
devise a proper personal energy weapon.

West End Games does produce the official Star Wars RPG.  Although alot of
what they do goes through LucasArts for legal reasons.  There are two
editions of the game I prefer the second edition myself but which are you
concerned with.  

Also, If your wanting to build a collection of Star Wars be ready to spend a
lot of cash.  I started role playing be getting the 2nd Edition a few years
ago and its hard to keep up.  I think the only other game that might rival
the amount of supplements and add ons is AD&D and thats only a slim
possibility.  Now, I\'m not saying don\'t get it.  In fact just the opposite.
I really would urge anyone to get this RPG.  If you do go in for it let me
know I\'d be glad to tell you all its secrets :).    

The best thing about the SW game is that its just as complicated or simple
as you want it.  The game focuses primarily on the fun not so much the
mechanics of the game.  The english language lacks to proper words to fully
describe the greatness of the Game.  

The hardest part though is finding players.  Well, thats true for any game.
My whole life I\'ve never played with more than 2 other individuals.
(Believe me its really difficult).  

And in all truth, Despite my true love for Star Wars.  I do prefer to play
traveller.  By only Problem is that playing with 2 other individuals and
having to mail order any products I don\'t really have a feel for the
Traveller Universe.  I never now what to purchase or exactly what Traveller
is really like.  Perhaps, We could help eachother out.  You tell me about
Traveller and I\'ll tell you about Star Wars.

Let me rephrase: things are canon until invalidated or superceded by a later

OTOH, you\'re also overlooking Ringworld, Star Trek, Space Master, and 
probably several others.

For me, the "official" background is the least part of the reason I
play Traveller. I play Traveller because I have found that while the
rules are simple, the rules manage to cover a wide variety of
situations with very little headache for the referee. To me, that\'s
a good and useful thing in a game system.

I pretty much run my own material in a very non-Imperial setting. So,
for me, the published background is useful for inspiring ideas for my
campaigns, but not much else. If I like something someone has
published for Traveller, I customize it to fit my campaign and plug
it in somewhere that makes sense for me.

I had an interesting conversation with one of my players last night. 
For several years he worked for one of the world\'s largest airline 
reservation systems in their computing division.

He tells me that any modern airline that operates their airplanes
with only 60% of the seats filled would likely go out of business
rather quickly, and that they really need to run at more like 70%+
full before making a profit.

==============================================
A Variant Task System for T4 by David Blustein
==============================================

Calculate the Target Number (TN) using Personal Characteristics (PC) 
and Skill Level (SL) per T4.

Assign a Difficulty Level (DL) to the Difficulty Rating (DR).

For example, instead of simply defining a task as Easy or Difficult,
define it as Easy-0 or Difficult-2.

Roll a number of dice (D) based on the Dice Code (DC) as follows:



     D = DC + (DL - SL)*0.5D



For example, using Difficult-5 and Skill-4 ( -0.5D ) throw 2D, since

     D = 2.5D + (4 - 5)*0.5D = 2.5D + (-1)*0.5D = 2D


For Difficult-5 and Skill-1 ( +2D ) throw 4.5D since

     D = 2.5D + (5 - 1)*0.5D = 2.5D + (4)*0.5D = 4.5D


If the target number is the same, the higher skilled character has a 
better chance at succeeding (more about that later).


The task system in T4 can be described as the case where DL = SL for 
all task rolls.


Some "default" task definitions might be Easy-0, Avg-1, Dif-2, For-3, 
Sta-4, and Imp-5.


Referees are free to assign any Difficulty Level to any task.

Using this variant task system, higher levels of skill grant a
character a greater chance of success and spectacular success, as
well as a lower chance of spectacular failure when compared to lower
levels of skill with an equal target number.

Lower levels of skill grant a character a lower chance of success
and spectacular success, as well as a greater chance of spectacular
failure when compared to greater levels of skill with an equal target
number.


Here are the chances for success for the "default" tasks in this
system.

Each table is labeled with its corresponding "default" task
definition, Target Numbers (TN) down the side, and Skill Levels (SL)
across the top. Percent (%) chance for success is listed in the
tables only when the combination of dice rolled, target numbers, and
skill levels are possible.

=====
Alternatively, the effects of skill can be reduced by varying the 
number of dice thrown by 0.25D instead of 0.5D.

If so, roll a number of dice (D) based on the Dice Code (DC) as follows:


     D = DC + (DL - SL)*0.25D


Round down to the nearest 0.5D (i.e., 2.25D becomes 2D, and 4.75D 
becomes 4.5D).


Enjoy!

In CT, missles (non-nuclear?) are 50kg/Cr5000 each and "sand" is
50kg/Cr400 per cannister.

Special Supplement 3, Missles, by MWM (published in JTAS#21) details
rules for custom missles. This supplement is compatible with CT. I\'m 
not sure how well it would fit in with MT or T4.

This looks great!  I\'ll be adding it to my combat rules as soon as I get

some comment about displacement mass and coolant in FF&S while T4
just calls it fuel.  The fuel required to jump 1 ton of shipt 1
parsec looks like about enough to produce 230 or so MW for a year
in a power plant.  That\'s 200,000,000,000,000 kW-h to jump a 100-ton
Scout/Courier 1 parsec assuming it\'s all used for fuel...

Seems like energy could be supplied by batteries or capacitors and
displacement mass(?) could be supplied by something denser, like
lead, or even unrefined hydrogen.

    'body' => '        I haven\'t really been able to give much time to following the task
system quotes, but I decided to do a "Me To" and share a task system I
developed for myself. The basic driver was that I wanted
        (A) Impossible tasks should truly be near-impossible, requiring high
skill and characteristic to even try. If I\'m going to assign an Impossible
difficulty ...
        (B) Weighted Skill more than Characteristic
        (C) Simple -- I really liked the MT system where each level was 4
away from the previous. OTOH, I grew to really like TNE\'s use of d20 (heresy
though it be ... you should have heard me when I first opened my box and out
popped the non-sixsided thingy)

        Here\'s the basic system -- roll under the target number on d20. Your
target number is the base difficulty plus skill plus 1/3 characteristic. A
difficult task has a base number of 5 (25% chance of success), and the
increment is 5. Hence,

        Easy            15
        Routine         10
        Difficult       5
        Formidable      0
        Impossible      -5

        I had a few minutes free at work, so I whipped up a spreadsheet to
compare mine, TNE\'s and MT\'s systems. Unfortunately, I\'m not
probability-smart enough to calculate MMT chances of success. I wanted to
see the range of low, average and high characteristic (3,7,11) and skill
(1,3,5) to see how it varied. The table lists the probability of success at
each task, skill increasing to the right and characteristic increasing down.

Every once in a while, an idea comes up on this list that is so simple
  and brilliant that I, a lurker, simply must speak up.

Most SF and SFRPGs have some technology whose applications are barely
  explored.  Zuchai crystals are onesuch; this post shows that they
  have uses besides being part of the "black box" down in Engineering
  that makes the ship go.  Can anyone think of other places where

Also, if we\'re taking zuchai crystals out of Engineering, we have to
  consider what happens when one gets damaged or shot...

I don\'t know.. being a Hero of the Soviet Unoin has a certain appeal to
it...  If you get the U.S. Cavalry catalog (or know someone who does) the
winter issue features a complete set of East German Police service medals,
with the ribbons, for about $100.  These are generic looking enough for a
casual pass in a con hallway.  The also have a ton of other EG goodies like
shoulderboards, uniforms, etc...

Yeah, that\'s right, I frequently have to go to Colorado, yuck.  The
only thing it has going for it is that it\'s better than New Mexico,
I can\'t believe anybody would bother to come here either.  And

I like the idea.  Only problem is it would probably invovle A LOT of
movement to generate the required voltage.  Try this out.

Lets take the case of a TL 12 Chemical Cartridge Laser Pistol

Okay, now lets replace the Chemical Cartridge with some sort of \'flash
charge\' battery. I\'m not sure of the proper name.  I\'m referring to a
battery or other medium that would take a large amount of voltage in a small
amount of time and keep it.  Perhaps by using a loop curcuit of sometype.

Now taking the belt idea...

Lets take the synthetic crystal array and connect it to a homopole generator
(it\'s been a while could you explain what a homopole generator is exaclty?).
The homopole generator has leads connecting it to dual storage battteries
which in turn have leads to the weapons holster.  Thus when the weapon is
place in the holster the weapon could be fast charged once their is
sufficient charge in the belt.  But, when used in combat the pistol would
have those annoying wires dangling from it.  

So when you charge from one battery on the belt your movements begin
recharging it.  And when you need a reload you could charge from another
battery on the belt while the other recharges.  This design would delay the
\'dancing\' when you run out of ammo in the gun.

Any ideas or thoughts.
I realize my idea sounds weak, but I like the pizeo crystol idea, so I\'d
appreciate 
anyone\'s thoughts.

Very interesting! Your Ranged distribution looks somewhat like my "Random"
distribution. Maybe my first instincts were closer to accurate. But, as I
said, other distributions are possible - such as your Melee table; I might
want to add a column for this. It makes good sense to me.

Your tables are nice and elegant: just one die, and easily memorized
results; after a while you wouldn\'t need to consult the table.

Thanks for the feedback!

I have no idea where the hydrogen goes.  Maybe Marc will tell us.  :-)
In MegaTraveller, DGP\'s much-lauded Starship Operator\'s Manual claims (p. 12):

"Entering jump-space requires large amounts of energy.  A special high-
yield fusion power plant incorporated within the jump drive itself provides
this energy.  The jump drive power plant consumes copious quantities of
fuel very quickly in o rder to charge the energy sinks (typically zuchai
crystals) with high-grade energy in preparation for the jump transition.

"Energy Sink Array: The energy produced by the jump drive\'s power plant is
stored in an array of high-energy sinks (also sometimes called \'jump
capacitors\').  Most ships found within the Imperium use a network of
zuchai crystals as the energy sink array.

"No other known sink construct can retain such high levels of energy
without decomposing as can zuchai crystals.  However, the crystals will
begin to decompose and break down after two or three hours if not
discharged.  In extreme cases, the crystals can explosively decompose and
do significant damage to the ship."

Yep, it\'s handwaving.  Nope, I can\'t think of a better explanation offhand.

My problem with *this* is in the basic definition of a vector... it is in
relation to something else, like "the world you\'re leaving". OK, I\'m willing
to accept it if no other compromise can be worked out, but it still strikes
me as inelegant.

Nope, not good, but unavoidable, IMO. While *not* wanting to bring up the
issue of orbital bombardment here, you could also use it to bring you in at
a high enough velocity that all you\'d have to do would be constantly
decelerate to orbital velocity, in order to minimize your transit times
coming in from 100 diameters, as no acceleration would be required (well,
you see what I mean... I know acceleration is just deceleration in the
opposite direction!).

I\'m afraid I just can\'t buy the idea of being able to adjust for the
relative motion between star systems and yet not be able to handle the
velocity acquired through using the maneuver drive. I compromise somewhat by
allowing my players to just accelerate like mad for the 100-diameter limit
with no required turnover, and rule that they get dropped out of jumpspace
right on the 100-diameter limit of their target world, at rest with relation
to the object creating the gravity well.It\'s a little arbitrary, true, but
it\'s a sacrifice made for playability. you could also get into some double
talk about "radiation flux" if players decide to come out of jumpspace with
a large velocity vector, say "0.4c toward the mainworld" or something like
that...   :)

<shrug> Who knows? Depends on your ship, how much servicing you need, how
much in the way of supplies, and just what the Dockworker\'s Union lets you
get away with paying. For trained environmental techs, I\'d say 20 Cr per
hour might even be a *low* guess, but I *like* keeping my players searching
for cash! And what kind of enviromental tech will be willing to work for the
absurdly low wage you mention (100 Cr/40 man-hours = 2.5Cr/hour!! Waaaaaaay
below any kind of minimum wage, *especially* for trained techs).

>>bringing aboard all your new food supplies, 
>

And this number strikes me as low, especially for anyone charging the rates
that standard passage costs. More on this later... And why on earth would
you have better food for the crew than the passengers?

Well, I would imagine that there\'s at least one filtration unit for each
stateroom, as they can have different sorts of environments. You\'ll also
have air quality issues for the ship as a whole, too, which would be of an
even greater magnitude. I have no idea what they\'d cost, but I\'d assume
they\'d be standardized in size, at least. You\'d want to do it at landfall
when there\'s no passenger in there because you\'d have to shut down the
environmental unit to do maintenance on it, and the passengers would find
that very uncomfortable.

>>replenishing your supplies of essentials for the lifesystem,

>What are they and what do they cost?

Who knows? Do any of your crew have special requirements? What does it cost
to provide that certain "atmospheric tang" that Crewman A wants in his
cabin? How do you purify your drinking water, and what does that cost? What
if you need more air, and this is a highport? What additives do you need for
your recycling system?

Could be, depending on your crew mix... it also might not be convenient for
the crew to access while underway, kinda like flushing out the toilet tanks
on a cabin cruiser. You *can* just flush it into the harbor, but the people
in the next slip will get angry at having to smell it. You also won\'t be
able to use that system while it\'s being cleaned, and that could be *highly*
inconvenient if you\'re underway... "Passengers will please refrain from
using the freshers for personal relief for the next hour while the engineer
does maintenance", maybe, but what if he runs into a problem? "Um... the
freshers will be working again sometime soon... please be patient!!"

>>performing routine maintenance chores and adjustments,

Yes, but this is when you *pay* for it, rather than assessing you a 2 Cr
charge every time a light bulb burns out or something. That\'s why it\'s
called "overhead charge".

In industrial strength, and large quantity, could be lots more than that,
could be less. Depends on how much you need, and how easily available it is,
and how much you use.

>Hardly a concern for most Free Traders.

Well, if you don\'t have any passengers, you won\'t need to pay the overhead
charge, now, will you?   :)

Seriously, *my* players like having that extra income, and the staterooms
*are* just sitting there otherwise. If their ship gets a rep as being a
worse place to spend a week than a train station inhabited by bums, they
won\'t be able to get those passengers.

<shrug> Steam-cleaning carpets. Flushing airducts. Purging waste systems.
Scrubbing all your food storage and preparation areas. That\'s just what
springs to mind immediately...

As I said above, I think that number is way too low. My ballpark guess,
based on the (soc*250Cr)/month number for food, clothing, lodging, & etc.,
is that that number is low by a factor of 4, at least, maybe more. Also,
regarding spoilage, have you ever worked in any sort of food service
operation? I\'m a perishables supervisor for a local grocery store, and we
have lots of fresh foods that just don\'t last very long, even with
refrigeration. Ever eaten hamburger that was six days old? It\'s pretty
gross, and certainly nothing you want to serve to someone who is paying you
good money for service. If I pay High Passage prices, or even Middle Passage
prices, and I have to eat frozen meals, or the Traveller equivalent of
MRE\'s, I\'m gonna be pissed off. I think you\'re overestimating the longevity
of the galley stores.

True. It\'s a rough number, given as an approximation. You also have to keep
in mind that you have to give your crews *some* degree of comfort, in order
to keep them happy and functioning well. Skimping on the supplies is a bad
sign, and will lead to a deterioration in crew morale. Since these folks
*have* to be in each other\'s faces for a week or more at a time, it\'s vital
to keep them at least superficially happy. Still, coming up 100 Cr short
shouldn\'t be a world-ending crisis, either... cut your players some slack.

<shrug> As I said above, I think your "200 Cr" number is way off. My
"monthly food/clothing/lodging,etc." bill comes to around US$1000, and I\'m
not living in a very outrageous fashion. I don\'t have Soc 4, either <grin>.
Call my monthly bill $300 for groceries/food ($10/day, for 3 meals and
snacks). My diet gets me by, but it\'s not good enough for a starship crewman
or passenger, because I don\'t have the assorted overheads they\'d have,
either, and I\'m not eating enough "good stuff" to keep a passenger or
crewman happy. Check with some folks who\'ve been in the Navy... nothing
shoots morale on a ship at sea as bad as having bad chow.

My own personal games usually have a *very rough* approximation of 2 Cr =
US$ 1, but this is obviously open to fudging either up or down. I personally
figure that about 2/3 of that overhead amount gets spent on food, etc., and
the rest gets spent on other various life-support related things, and minor
fungibles.

And here I agree with you. I don\'t hold them strictly to the numbers all the
time, and I\'m not going to give them grief about making enough money to just
*pay* it. OK, paying off the *note* on the ship, now that\'s another story!
They\'re going to have to *work* to get that.

Also, are they going to charge standard rates for passengers? If so, then
they better have standard facilities and services, or word will spread. I
guess it just comes down to how tight-fisted you want them to be, and how
short a fiscal leash you keep them on. I prefer a loose leash, and so I just
charge them the flat rate and have done with it. If my players *really*
wanted to quibble over it, well, I\'d deal with it, but the folks I\'ve played
with were willing to just let it slide.

On a related note, I agree wholeheartedly with the idea someone mentioned a
while back, though.... your Free Traders can\'t make money at standard rates,
so let them charge whatever they can get away with. It keeps them hopping,
and gives the referee a much bigger fiscal carrot to dangle (and stick to
wave). They\'ll get the small stuff that falls through the cracks...
production overruns, people going to out-of-the-way places, smuggling runs,
*urgent* cargoes, that sort of thing. Much more interesting than simply
"hauling goods from Point A to Point B... repeat as necessary".

Dunno. I never fooled much with exchange rates, as my players didn\'t want to
do that much paperwork. Anyone else got any comments?

First off, I\'m using the difficulty system that I developed for "Ken\'s Task Fix 
Prototype"--which I posted last week.  I\'ve play tested this system, and I\'m very happy 
with the results.  I think it is a keeper--it makes impossible tasks impossible while 
providing good chances, but not unrealistic ones, for the low target numbers.  See that 
post, or e-mail me, if you are interested in a discussion of how the probabilities turn 
out using this system.

A quick review:
This system is a very easy fix for those interested in staying close to published T4 
rules but who also want to make impossible tasks more impossible to achieve.  To use it, 
just change the amount of dice thrown for Staggering and Impossible difficulty throws.
		Easy		1.5/Auto
		Average		2
		Difficult	2.5
		Formidable	3
		Staggering	4
		Impossible	5



But, I digress.  This has nothing to do with calculation of target numbers.

The new target number:
Some of you may recall that I posted a target number system that included aptitude.  It 
was only a prototype, and when I play tested it, I noticed that the aptitude variable 
really downgraded the importance of the skill level.  

One of my goals was to increase the importance of skill level, so I trashed the aptitude 
idea.  It was too much to keep up with anyway--I want an easy system that fits T4 like a 
glove.

So, I\'ve gone back to the simple way T4 does target numbers, by simply adding skill 
level and attribute, with a little twist.

The twist is this--double the skill level and half the attribute.

		Target number = (2 x skill level) + (attribute / 2)      round up

This system puts an emphasis on the skill--not the attribute.  I believe that a 
character should be able to learn a skill and not be overpowered by a low characteristic 
score.  The skill level should be most important.  At the same time, the attribute score 
should have a significant impact on success of a throw.  

Take, for example, the Pilot-1, Dex-10 vs. Pilot-4, Dex-6 problem.  I\'ve had this 
problem with T4 for a while now.  In T4, the Pilot-1 person has a better chance of 
succeeding than the Pilot-4 person.  Target number of 11 for Pilot-1 guy vs. 10 for 
Pilot-4 guy?  I mean, I know that Dex-10 is great, but Dex-6 isn\'t that bad.  And look 
at the skill differences!  Anybody with Pilot-4 should be able to fly the socks off a 
person with Pilot-1, regardless of their Dex.

This new calculation fixes that problem nicely.  The Pilot-1 person has a target number 
of 7 while the Pilot-4 person has a target number of 11.  Hmm.  I like that spread--it 
gives meaning to having a high level skill. 

I play tested this system earlier tonight in my campaign, and I like it.  I really like 
it.  It\'s simple.  It\'s easy to do, and it is close to the T4 system but still fixes 
what I want it to fix.

The numbers are close to the T4 numbers, too.  Look at a couple of tests...

The average character (skill-2, attribute-7) has a target number of 8--which produces 
average percentage numbers on the difficulty table (with either my or T4\'s system).

A bad assed character, skill-7 and attribute-15, has the same target number either 
way--which I like.  Target number of 22--percentages remain the same.

A pitiful character, skill-1 and attribute-4, still has a chance, but is penalized for 
being deficient in both skill and attribute.  Target number 4.

Most of all, it really fixes our problem from the pilot example above, and it encourages 
players to improve their skills, not their attributes.  

T4, as it stands in the main book, places the emphasis of improvement on attributes.  
Improve one attribute, and you\'ve improved several of your skills.  This new system 
shifts the emphasis to what it should be on--the skills.

Well, I think I\'ve got my new system.  The quick difficulty fix combined with this 
target number calculation takes care of any problems I had with the T4 task system, and 
it does it without any tables, compatibliity problems, or design incongruities.  The 
glove fits.  

I do all of the math before hand, then record the target numbers on the character\'s 
sheet.  In the "Base Characteristic" column, I have the target numbers in parentheses 
next to the specific attribute.  All my players have to do is look at their skill on 
their sheets, and the target number is before them.  

Now, this is better than the MT system.  I\'m a happy camper.  I got my cake, and I\'m 
about to dig in.

So, what do you think?

Kenneth.

Well, the Traveller pop distributions are flawed and everybody agrees on
that(+) but do we wan\'t to change them? Rewrite all published data or use
the new rules on newly generated systems? IG had a great opportunity to
rewrite world gen when they decided to trash the published data but they
failed to do so because (IMO) of their and former GDWs constant use of
"Reprint the old stuff, gamers are idiots so they\'ll gladly pay for the
same stuff again".

The reason to stick with the old system is the enormous amount of generated
material out there and if you don\'t like the rules; change them.

I\'m toying with the idea of jumps only possible near large masses (both

Which means that there *is* no "canon". It\'s simply at the designer\'s whim
(which is what I said). So, for example, if Marc says that "Virus never
happened, it was all a nightmare (shades of *Dallas* ;-) being had by
Strephon", then Virus ceases to be canon. Or if a "licensed *official*
Traveller product" states that Grandfather was all a myth emplaced by the
Hivers as part of a psychohistory manipulation for unknowable (to us poor
sucker humans) purposes, well, then *that* is "canon". Or if Marc decides
that the ultimate weapon in Traveller is the ubiquitious large asteroid at
.01c ;-), then *that* is canon?

Oops.  This part is a hold-over from Classic Traveller Book 5, High Guard.
It\'s completely misleading, and should have been changed.

The rules that should be there are about the types of streamlining (or lack
thereof) for Traveller hulls.  There are four now, in T4: Airframe,
Streamlined, Unstreamlined, and Planetoid.

- - Airframe hulls have aerodynamic control and lifting surfaces (or a lifting
body or flying wing design of some type) that enable it to perform
atmospheric flight.  Airframe hulls may scoop gas giants for fuel, and may
land and take off from any world with an atmosphere of thin or better.  They
may land on airless (or trace) worlds if the ship is equipped with contra-grav,
or has more acelleration than the surface gravity of the world.

- - Streamlined hulls are faired over for high-speed passage through an
atmosphere, but don\'t have control and lifting surfaces.  Streamlined hulls
may scoop gas giants for fuel, and may land and take off from any world
(regardless of atmosphere) if the ship is equipped with contra-grav, or has
more acelleration than the surface gravity of the world.

- - Unstreamlined hulls are not faired, and no provision has been made for
atmospheric flight.  Unstreamlined hulls may NOT scoop for fuel, and may
only land on airless (or trace) worlds, if the ship is equipped with
contra-grav or has more acelleration than the surface gravity of the world.
Attempting to operate an unstreamlined hull within an atmosphere is
inherently risky; the referee should generate piloting tasks based on the
maneuvers attempted and the individual situation.

- - Planetoid hulls are made from hollowed-out planetoids (asteriods).  Such
ships may NOT land on ANY world, and may NOT scoop for fuel.  Attempting to
land on a world will probably destroy the ship.

The QSDS system in T4 has hulls of the first three configurations.
Planetoid hulls will be available from the Naval Architect\'s Handbook.

>  Where is a table describing hull configurations 1 to 6, dispersed
>  structures, and planetoids?

The reference is obsolete; there isn\'t a table of hull configurations
anymore; instead they\'re described by shape and streamlining (the
descriptive "Streamlined Sphere" - or even "Sphere S" is easier to
understand than a letter/number code).

For any old-timers out there, the closest thing to a "dispersed structure"
would be "Unstreamlined Open Frame".  Planetoids aren\'t included in T4 basic
book, but rules for building planetoid hulled ships are being created now.

They don\'t.  The term "laser sensors" in this case means sensors that detect
lasers (and not lasers that are used as sensors - the term for that is
ladar).  These sensors detect when an enemy is about to fire (from a
previous near miss, or from non-weapon laser pulses sent by the enemy\'s
fire-control system to measure range or adjust the weapon\'s optics).

After the sand is launched, lasers from the enemy ship will be quite
noticeable as they hit the sand, which will scatter the laser beam in all
directions (a lot like the way a dense fog will scatter light from a
flashlight).

Most advanced starships use wide-band EMS (Electro-Magnetic Spectrum) sensor
systems as their primary means of sensing the enemy.  While some bands of the
electromagnetic spectrum will be blocked (by sand, or natural noise
sources like a nearby star), other bands won\'t be - operated by a good
sensor tech, the EMS system will still be able to track the enemy.

> Page 94, Sensors
>  The description states, "The Improved package increases the range of
>  the basic sensors."  What is the range for basic sensors?

The ranges are given by the USD ratings for the sensors.  There are three
letter/number codes in the rating: A# P# J#.  These stand for the Active,
and Passive range of the sensor, and the Jamming power.  The ranges are
expressed in tenths of a light-second (0.1 L-S is about 30,000km).  The
jammer number is the jamming DM used in step 5 of the space combat system.

Therefore, a TL-11 Basic sensor suite (USD A0 P2 J0) has an active range of
0 light-seconds (0 means "less than one"), a passive range of 2
light-seconds (about 60,000km), and no jammer (a jammer has to have a power
of at least 1 to be useful - see step 5 of the space combat system).
The TL-11 Improved sensor suite has an active range of 1 (30,000km), but is
otherwise the same.

The actual ranges of the various suites change with TL, as well - a TL-12
Basic sensor suite is better than a TL-10 Improved suite.  Particularly at
the lower TLs, there\'s little improvement between "basic" and "improved"
sensors (the ranges improve, but they\'re still less than 0.1 L-S).

All of these ranges are the "short range" of the sensor - the range at which
the sensor is most accurate, and detection is most reliable.  All of the
sensor systems can detect the presence of a ship (even if the sensor data
isn\'t good enough for a firing solution) to at least 16 times the listed
range, and possibly more.  For most sensors, this is beyond Long range; even
for the shortest-ranged sensors, it\'s at least Medium range.

> Page 94, Communications
>  The description details three ranges used by the QSDS communications
>  packages: 3000km, 30,000km, and 1000AU.
>  Are there space combat range equivalents for these distances?

The ranges listed are the "sort range" of the communicators - the range at
which reception is assured (assuming the reciever has the same range
rating).  You _can_ communicate at longer distances, depending on the skill
of the operator (the referee should assign a communicator task; as a rule of
thumb, increase the difficulty one step each time the attempted range
doubles).

An AU is an Astronomical Unit, the mean distance between the Earth and the
Sun (or about 150 million km).  A communicator with a 1000AU range can
reliably communicate with any appropriate reciever anywhere within the same
star system.  This exceeds the longest space combat range by a large amount.

The space combat system in T4 is abstract, and the ranges are
"indeterminate", which means we can\'t assign useful numbers to the
ranges.  As a rough approximation, though, 3000km is shorter than
"Very Short" range, while 30,000km is somewhere around "Short".

Laser and Maser communicators are "tight beam" - in other words, you must
know the location of the reciever, and the beam is established directly
between transmitter and reciever (and not broadcast to all of space).  Radio
communicators are broadcast, so that everyone who is in range and listening
on the frequency can hear the message.

> Page 100, Slow Boat, Ship\'s Boat, Pinnace, Launch
> Page 101, Modular Cutter, Light Fighter

All of the small craft are probably incorrect to some degree or another;
they were converted from previous editions of Traveller, and not designed
using the starship design system (we were working on the QSDS and SSDS
systems at the time, and the small craft "fell through the cracks" - sorry).

The USD fuel numbers are likely wrong; if you need to know how much fuel
each one carries, go with the number in the text (that is, the smaller
number) until better information is available.

> Page 100, Subsidized Merchant
>  Should the Subsidized Merchant have one ship\'s vehicle: a 20-ton

Yes.  It\'s carried in a streamlined external grapple.  The price of the ship

The 20-ton Launch.  It\'s carried internally, in a minimal Hangar.  The price

The 200-ton figure is wrong; it\'s a 400 ton hull.

It\'s not - the ship requires 14 crew, plus marines.

Right.  A squad of marines adds another "command" crew, as well; this would
be the Marine Lieutenant; the marines would consist of 2 NCOs and 6 privates.

Yes.

Command, 1 Medic, 1 Steward, 8 troops, 2 Supernumary.

Notes:  Based on a 400-ton Airframe Needle hull, he Patrol Cruiser has TL12
Advanced Commo, and a TL12 10-ton capcaity fuel purifier.  The ship carries a
30-ton Ship\'s Boat in an AirFrame Grapple, as well as an ATV.  There are 2
TL12 MFDs each capable of controlling 4 missiles. The Marines are quartered
in bunks, the Command staff in Large staterooms and the rest in small
staterooms.

A comment on the notation: the line "2 Battery Mil Lsr" means that there are
two independent batteries of Military Lasers; similarly "2 Battery Missile
Barb 5 (4)" means 2 independent batteries of missile barbettes; each
barbette has 5 ready missiles, and can control 4 of them in flight at once.

This ship does require a custom hull (available from the "Big Table of
Hulls), though a similar ship limited to 3G could be built from the QSDS
rules in T4.

OPINION: This ship would make an intersting vehicle for the PCs in an
"Imperial Navy" campaign.  On a frontier world (or a small cluster of them),
such a ship would be the only Imperial presence in maybe a month\'s travel. 
The supernumary crewmembers would be science or diplomatic specialists.  The
PCs could each play two or three characters.  With a little care, scenarios
could be designed so that each player only has to play one character at a
time.  For example, the PCs could each have a Marine character; plus a ship
character: Engineers, sensor techs, astrogator, pilot, gunner, and medic,
science, or diplomat would all be good choices.  Use the NPC Marines as
"spear carriers" and potential casualties.  I try to avoid putting a PC in
overall command of the ship.  Instead, I use an NPC captain to present the
current scenario to the PCs, and let them deal with it from there.

Yes.  I recommend using the format used above for the Patrol Cruiser for
describing QSDS ships; in particular, the Crew Detail is helpful when
trying to fit a ship to a group of PCs.  The Notes should always include
the TL and type of the commo system, the capacity of the fuel purifier,
and any carried craft.  If the ship includes any added MFDs (for controlling
missiles), a comment to this effect often helps clarify the battery
descriptions.  The description of the quarters is also very helpful in
figuring out how many of what kind of rooms are available.

>  Also, where in a USP is the electromagnetic masking rating recorded?

In the sensors section, after the sensor USD.  For example, it might read
something like  "A16 P8 J4 Sensors / Masking (TL-12 Lg Mil)".

There are no ships in the basic rules that have Stealth or Masking (a ship
may have one or the other, not both, since Masking is advanced stealth).  If
a ship were stealthed, it would show "Stealth" in the same location as the
masking would appear.

There is (currently) no way to build a Stealth or Masking hull in QSDS.

> Page 110, Standard Military Laser Batteries

No.  The "Standard" QSDS lasers are grav-focussed tunable lasers.  Below
TL-11, there\'s no way to cram one of reasonable power and range into a
turret or barbette - it\'s so large it has to go into a bay.

I have the designs for non-tunable non-grav, X-ray lasers at TL-9 and TL-10,
and these will go into the next edition of QSDS, so that small, low-tech ships
have some laser options (these lasers will be an improvement over all the
existing lasers, up to TL-14 at least - the drawback is that they don\'t work
in an atmosphere).

The tables presented in the T4 rulebook give turrets (the first group at
each TL) and barbettes (the second group) for each TL.  Notice that the
barbettes are larger, and have better range and damage.

No.  It shoud be "9-8-5-3".

No.  It\'s a typo.

Not unless you expect the whole crew to be sick at the same time.  ;-) 
What that\'s trying to say is that an 8 ton sickbay has two beds.

It was supposed to be; there appear to be a few designs (the liner, and the
patrol cruiser) that don\'t match any of the available hulls.

Surface area, power, and crewing.  And, of course, cost.

Right.  Consider the "1 hardpoint per 100 tons" a rule of thumb, and not a
rule of the design system.  Note that a dozen turrets would use 40% of the
volume of a 100-ton hull, and the power plant to support them would be
another 15%.  While you could possibly make a special-purpose design (say, a
laser-armed System Defense Boat) this heavily armed, a general-purpose ship
like a Scout/Courier couldn\'t support this much weaponry.

Masking (and Stealth) are features of the hull design, and not the sensor
system.  There aren\'t any masked or stealthed hulls in QSDS.  This is an
option in SSDS (in the forthcoming Starships suppliment).  I am hopeful that
a future version of QSDS will include some masked or stealthed hulls.

>  Does this imply that a 0 Sensor Rating gives no chance for

In general, sensors with a rating of 0 aren\'t useful in combat, although
they serve well in rezendevous and docking, and to detect ships even if they
don\'t give a firing solution.

However, since the sensors DO exist, even if they\'re not very powerful,
there\'s a small chance.  If it\'s ever important, treat sensors with a rating
of 0 just like those with a 1, except they may only be used against targets
at Very Short range.

Note, however, that jammers with a rating of 0 don\'t exist.  A 0 jamming
rating means "no jammer"; a 0 sensor rating means "not enough range to be
useful".

        Woo hoo!  Happy happy carnage carnage!  If I can make a suggestion,
a physics model where the MA-75 has a theta error of 3 and the WSTE-M\'s
have a theta error of 15, and fire 32 pellets (that each do approx 5
damage) instead of ten is quite interesting.  I also like de-accurizing the
pistols a little.  As well, increasing bullet damages proportionately so
that a shot from a .44 is always fatal really livens things up a bit.  Adds
a whole new dynamic to the game, especially when you\'ve got the Security

        I like it!  Mean, lean, and simple!

        Comments: as I pointed out a while back, in some instances skill
will  outweigh characteristic in determining the outcome: in the case of
two people with int 11, one with mathematics (or edu) 3, the one with the
higher math skill will probably do better, because mathematics is a very
complex skill.  To reiterate the example I used, although my personal
bodily characteristics were more suited to fencing than my old fencing
coach\'s, the fact that his skills were so well-developed compared to mine
meant that it was no contest all the way.

        OTOH, in other situations, characteristic is all that counts: e.g.
lifting large heavy objects, running long distances, being a minor noble,
etc.

        In yet others, characteristic is more important, but skill still
counts.  To borrow Ross Coburn\'s example, take a 5\'3" <evil grin>
basketball player with middling skill playing basketball with somebody
that\'s 6\'6" with no skill.  The short player has an edge until the tall
player gets a clue, at which point the short player is in trouble because
height and dexterity really, really count in basketball, and the skills
involved are fairly simple (dribbling and throwing balls, basically).

        I\'d argue that situations where a skill alone, regardless of
characteristics, would determine outcome, are impossible.  You\'re always
mediating, or using, your skill with a characteristic.

        All this system of yours needs (IMHO) is to take this into account
(skill-primary, characteristic-only, and characteristic-primary types of
situation) and I think that it\'d rule.  It\'s simple because of the single
die used, and it has nice high resolution because the single die is a d20
(I don\'t like d6\'s; I find that anything under a d10 is lousy for
resolution; otoh Ross thinks that resolution isn\'t neccessary).  I\'d
suggest simply reversing the weight you give to skills & characteristics in
characteristic-primary rolls, and maybe just tripling the characteristic
and then dividing by two to get the modifier for characteristic-only rolls?

While I agree with you on the principle, this particular implementation
reminds me of the GM who informed his players that they had been tramping
over rough terrain since daybreak and that their feet were now completely
in tatters. Seems thay had forgotten to tell him that they put on their
boots when they got up!

Yes, for trained techs it is, but not for simple clean-up crewbeings. It\'s
roughly 2.5 times survival wages.

I couldn\'t agree withyou more, but I\'d be inclined to lower the ticket costs
myself.

>And why on earth would you have better food for the crew than the passengers?

I don\'t. 100 Cr per fortnight is the cost of good food. But passengers only 
spend 9 days on the ship in an average jump. So they only burden the
environment 2/3rds as much as a crewbeing. And while Cr30is too paltry to
bother with, 1/3rd of Cr2000 is not hay.

Start by assuming standard human passengers and crew since that is the most
common species in Imperial space. And my point is that these costs should
be proportionate to similar costs outside spaceships. One of the problems
here is that Cr 2000 is a lot more than you think.

Sure, but the overhead is far more than I can account for. Again, the
problem is that you don\'t realize how expensive it is.

You said _repeat_ passenger. Most Free Traders don\'t have regular passengers.

Fine, but the problem remains the same. It\'s not that I object to assessing
the players an overhead for such things, it\'s that it\'s so unbelivable
expensive.

Ah, there\'s the rub. That "Soc*250Cr" figure is a) A Megatraveller phenomenon
that did not apply to Classic Traveller nor does it apply to T4 (that I have
noticed), and b) completely bogus.

Think about it: the difference between the living expenses of the lowest 
level of a society (Soc 1) and the next higher level is supposed to be 100%!
Do you really think that is realistic? Contrarywise, the difference between
the living expenses of the gentry (Soc 10) and the lower nobility (Soc 11)
is supposed to be a measly 10%! Does that ring true to you?

Howsomever, according to page 64 of T4, good food is Cr 200 per month, good
lodgings is likewise Cr 200 per month. Play with that figure a little and
you\'ll get a minimum (subsistence level) wage of 1 Cr per hour. Oh, and I
guess you\'re right about the trained technician bit. A good starship 
engineer gets Cr 4800 per month, which works out at Cr 160 per day or Cr 20
per hour. However, compared to a retirement pay (after 5 terms) of Cr 11 per 
day, this is a fantastically high wage. My guess is that starship crew
recieve considerably higher pay than ground-based crew. (Actually, my guess
is that this is another place where noone has bothered to think the system
through, but saying that isn\'t "playing the game".)

I\'ve eaten plenty of defrosted dinners that tasted OK. Still, as I said,
even with a wastage of 10 or 20% (which I don\'t think is all that likely,
but I\'ll grant it FPOA), the cost is only 10-20 Cr per passenger.

OK, I admit I was thinking about canned and frozen goods, not fresh food. So
you have a point here. OTOH, do you really think food preservation techniques
are going to stay at present-day level from now on? No improvement at all at
higher TLs?

Yep. But I believe that the approximation is unreasonable.

><shrug> As I said above, I think your "200 Cr" number is way off. 

A quick check of the rules will show you that it is spot on.

The Cr 200 is for "good food". Luxury food will run you to Cr. 600 per
month.

Actually, that\'s the same sort of figure for the "other stuff" that I\'d
consider reasonable. I have been working with Cr 100 for food and Cr 100
for the rest. If I accept that the food ought to be luxury rather than just 
good then the cost for a passenger would be 200 for food and 100 for the
rest. A crewmember would cost 300 for food and 100 for the rest. An 
overhead of 300 per passenger and 400 per crew. That sounds quite
reasonable; and on a Free Trader the PCs have the option of cutting this by 
accepting something a little less satisfying than smoked salmon and caviar...

Of course, with the overhead lowered I\'d also lower the standard fares.
OTOH I\'d let jump-2 ships charge at least twice up for a jump-2.

I realize no one is perfect and the odds of actually getting some rulebook 
publish with *no* errata are pretty long, but can\'t we at least aim for that?

Since there are a number of people on this list that are going to buy these 
products regardless - and since those same people are VERY good at finding 
mistakes - couldn\'t there be some way to get these people an "advance copy" to 
proof for you?

I mean, take some of the long-timers on this list, the ones that are brilliant at 
this sort of thing, and offer them a cheaply-printed, no-art kinda copy that they 
can review for "...you\'ll find various forms..." and missing jump-drive tables 
and what-not.  Seems like it wouldn\'t be *real* expensive to run off 20 or 30 
copies (just the rules, no cover or binding or anything) and send them to the 
people that 1)  already ordered the book anyway; and 2)  Have demonstrated some 
kinda skill at finding Traveller errata.  I haven\'t been on the list long enough 
to know who these people might be, but I bet you can already think of a few.

I don\'t mean to suggest that you folk aren\'t doing a real good job.  There\'s just 
no way you can possibly do as good a job at proofing the rules as 20 or 30 
TMLers... and since they\'re going to buy the books anyway, the only cost is in 
photocopying and shipping (and I think these folk will volunteer for proofing 
because they\'d like to get the errors found and corrected *before* the book is 
printed).

Do please consider.  Seems like a very open, interactive kinda company and this 
would be a good use of the close contact you\'re maintaining with Traveller fans 
on the internet.

Oh, sort of a minor errata:  The chapter on Ground Combat says that combat is 
resolved just like using a skill, "see chapter 3".  There\'s nothing in chapter 3 
that describes how to use a skill (unless you count "see chapter 4).

Thanks for your time.

Why can\'t thse maneuver in atmosphere with contragravity.  Seems like they
could fly as slow as they wanted since they don\'t have to worry about lift.
They should get penalties for high speed maneuvers (I suppose) but shouldn\'t
for low speed.

Seems like a big rock wouldn\'t have any problem resting on the ground...
Assuming it can take 1 G of acceleration, it shouldn\'t have any problem with
a 1 G field generated by a planet...  You\'ll want to make sure that it rests
upright, of course... though with artificial gravity, that\'s just a
convenience...  Again, you\'re probably not going to want to move fast
in an atmosphere, but if it\'s got contragravity or thrust equal to weight,
it should be able to land...

Tunable over what frequencies?  Can they be tuned to the IR, X-Ray or

They don\'t work at all in an atmosphere?  Why is this?  do X-ray lasers
never work in atmosphere?

Typical relative velocities between star systems will be under 100km/s.

100km/s is 6 hexes per turn in BL/BR.  So that means in game play
terms, when you jump in system you could roll 1d6, and it will take
that many half hours to match velocities with the new system.
Done.

I personally think the solution to the bombardment issue is
political/moral, not something to try and explain away by ignoring
physics.  World-killing is considered a horrible crime and is dealt
with serverely.  That leaves the nuts as a problem, but they\'ll have
easy access to nukes at that point in time as well.

That or let \'em keep the vector.  You could keep track of this with
a galactic eye view (a nightmare), or just treat it randomly at the
new system and require them to slow down.  Then they might have to
run like hell for the jump limit on the way out (pirates!) but they
pay for it with an equal number of hours slowing down a week later.

When developing Traveller \'history\', a lot of people try to tie their stories
into published information. In fact, many of Traveller\'s biggest
inconsistencies have come from someone treating a throwaway reference as
\'canon\' and extrapolating from it.  If I decide to change the world of
Sulieman (for example), then I have to change all references to Sulieman in
all published material.  In other words, with every new product I will have
to scan its library data to see if I have to alter anyting for my universe.

Now, some of us do that anyway.  (I know I do.)  But I\'d like to keep the
rewriting to a minimum, and thus I think that placing some backwater areas
into official limbo is a reasonable solution.

Notice that I wrote "backwater".  Those of us that want to change the grand
sweep of Imperial history will do so anyway, rewriting entire sectors as we
choose; those of us that want to run low-key campaigns against the official
backdrop should have a quiet corner of the sandbox where we can play our
games in peace, but attached to the official universe so we can come out and
play with everyone else when we want to.

Hi Jeff,

Thanks for showing so much concern over the products produced by Imperium 
Games.  Your suggestions all make sense, but your letter makes 
assumptions which are untrue.  Perhaps you only recently joined this 
list?  Many of these issues have come up on here in the past.

For instance, T4 was, indeed, proofread by several people outside of IG.  
However, the time constraints kept everyone from doing as thorough a job 
as would otherwise have been possible, and probably also kept IG from 
implementing every change that was suggested.

T4 was, I think, a special case.  First, the time frame was relatively 
short.  Second, we here on the TML and GDW-Beta convinced IG to change 
the starships section at the last second (which introduced many errors 
all by itself).

After the fact, IG has had T4 proofread by me (and others).  They\'re also 
aware of all the errata posted on this list.

So, we can expect version 1.1 of T4 to be far less error-filled (I 
hesitate to say it will be perfect - I\'ve never seen a perfect RPG<G>).  

I believe that future projects will get continually better, in terms 
of editing, as IG improves its processes.  They will undoubtedly continue 
to have others edit their work.  They will also have more time available 
on future projects, so those editing jobs will be more thorough, and 
IG\'s implementation of the resulting editing changes will be more 
thorough as well.

I hope this helps to give you a better pricture of what IG is doing to 
improve product quality.

:)

The Zuchacell(TM) heavy battery line from GSbAG

The availability of adequate power is one of the limiting factors of
starship design. As soon as the Zuchai crystals were discovered
reseachers
realized that they were the most promising energy storing device.
However, the crystal structure cannot withstand the stresses
experienced
while energy is accumulated for more than a few hours. AFter these
the
crystal rearranges itself and all the energy accumulated is released
explosively.

Another disadvantage of the Zuchai crystals is that they keep memory
of
the way they have been charged. This is fact one of the main reasons
for
misjump, since the energy delivered to the lanthanum network in jump
drives is first temporarily stored in arrays of Zuchai crystals.

Various companies tried nevertheless to develop battery designs based
on the
properties of Zuchai crystals. The Zuchacell(TM) design is the most
successful and common one.

Zuchacells(TM) can only be built in size larger than 20 kl due to the
extensive controls and complex design. A jump drive engineering is
qualified
for the maintenance of a Zuchacell(TM) array.

A Zuchacell (TM) contains a redundant set of Zuchai crystals, a
governor,
and a small capacity standard battery to correct for the Zuchai
memory
effect. Energy is cycled through the reduntant crystal bank so that
each
single crystal does not remain charged for more than 1 hour. On
charge
and off charge periods are alternated by the governor to guarantee
safety.
Thanks to the Zuchai high efficiency energy losses are very modest
(less than one per cent of the charge per day).

The following is the table for Zuchacells(TM). No Zuchacell(TM)
smaller than
20kl can be manufactured.

Each kl of battery has the following capacity and price:

TL      Capacity Mwh    Cost(Mcr)
9       24              0.45
10      28              0.48
11      30              0.55
12      33              0.62
13      46              0.74
14      51              0.94
15      59              1.12
16      67              1.2

Each kl weighs 2 tons.

- ----

If you are interested in how they were "designed":
The cost and capacity have been computed from the zuchai crystal
capacity given in MT combat rules (under black globe) which turns out
to
be about 80 Mwh/kl (with a duty cycle 0.5 due to cycling). Controls
are
assumed to be as bulky as the crystals at TL 9 and decrease linearly
with
TL until at TL 16 are just 10 per cent of the crystals volume.
Standard
storage batteries as in the MT design rules are also included for a
capacity of one per cent of the total. The weight and price of the 
crystals plus  controls are 2 ton per kl and 0.2 Mcr per Kl to these
one has to add the storage batteries.

To quote Greg Porter\'s comments prefacing a test version on the Beta list:

    "The [vehicle design system] is a modified version of the vehicle design
     system in Fire, Fusion and Steel, adjusted for T4, and limited to a
     subset of vehicle types likely to be encountered or designed by
     characters. It can be used to create non-spacecraft vehicles of most
     sizes, and while it incorporates much of the Standard Starship Design
     rules, it has some exceptions needed for extremely small vehicles."

The vehicle construction rules are a modified subset of FF&S, specifically
for vehicle (and aerospacecraft) construction.  The major changes are in the
armor calculation, so that vehicles designed for this system have armor
ratings that mesh with the T4 ground combat system; and there have been
changes to the power plants to deal with the "Fusion Plus" of milleu 0.
A variety of pre-designed "off the shelf" weapons are also available.

The rules are capable of constructing vehicles down to very low TLs (below
TL4) and up to TL-15 or so.  The bulk of the designs in the Central Supply
Catalog will be oriented towards a Milieu 0 campaign, but the vehicle design
system can be used to design equipment for other eras.

Future Milieu books will either include appropriate vehicles and equipment
as part of the Milieu book, or a separate vehicle and equipment
suppliment will be produced for that Milieu.

I\'m sorry, but there wasn\'t time to reconcile the two systems.  Here\'s a
conversion chart between all four armor systems that you might need to use:

Marc Miller\'s Traveller		Fire, Fusion and Steel
Personal	Starship	Standard	Battle Rider
13		0		 10		0
16		10		 20		1
20		20		 40		2
26		30		 80		3
29		40		120		4

An "0 Armor Rating" starship has 13 points of armor for purposes of firing
at it with a plasma gun (or a grav tank).  If for some reason starship
weapons wind up firing at people or vehicles, convert the weapon\'s USD
value from the "Battle Rider" scale to the MMT Personal scale.  Therefore,
a USD 3 laser battery has a personal-scale penetration of 26 (note, however,
that the starship laser has a beam of this intensity that\'s a nearly couple of
meters in diameter - and therefore probably does a lot more damage to the
target than an equivalent ground-combat laser, whose beam is measured in cm).

If armor values fall between the lines on the table, use the next lower
line; therefore a tank with armor value 22 (MMT personal scale) would be
equivalent to starship armor value 20.

An amateur astronomer today with a 16"

the Mt. Wilson 100" was when it was first constructed. Scary thought...
And in one night with the 24" on the UCLA rooftop I could reproduce my

Actually, I want to have a scattering of worlds in each subsector (say
two or three out of the thirty or forty) that are left blank. Then I can
come up with my own imaginative worlds (or cop other people\'s) and put
them down in the area where my players are adventuring. I don\'t want to need
to have them travel clear across a sector to adventure on some world I
just made up or transplanted from a JTAS "Amber Zone."

Refs who don\'t like this can just say that these worlds don\'t exist.

The problem is, I don\'t like the way it\'s always been done. This may
sound like heresy, but I didn\'t like my characters to have to travel
to an official sector to go on one of GDW\'s excellent adventures, and
then travel to an "unofficial" sector in order to go on some nifty
adventure that I thought up, but couldn\'t fit into one of GDW\'s
canonical sectors. They spent too much time jumping around and not
enough time adventuring. This was especially true since thay had to make
money to make their ship payments, so each jump had to be detailed to
figure out how much money they made.

Actually, it\'s always been a problem in the past. Players get upset if
they make plans based on the canon, and then find out (sometimes too
late) that the ref has changed that part of the canon. Having
established non-canonical areas (that are near to the main campaign, not
in another sector!) will make things clear to both players and refs what
may or may not be reasonably expected.

There are two problems with this approach. 

The first I already noted above: I don\'t want to discourage the players
from making up elaborate schemes by changing the universe they know and
love (unless it would be really fun to do so! 8^). 

The second is that IG may come up with a really fun adventure that I
want to take the players on, but unfortunately, I\'ve already trashed the
worlds it takes place on. If these wolds are part of a small league, or
have strategic value based on their position, then fitting the new
adventure into my modified campaing could be a real problem. (IMHO, the
only reason to go with canon is so you can use published adventures
without much effort. If I have to work to fit an adventure into my
campaign, I may as well not use any published data!) So if IG goes the 
route you suggest, then I would hope that they delineate which worlds
the ref can change or trash without fear of violating future canon.

It works for me. If all you want is to have a huge number of detailed
worlds so that your players can do anything and go anywhere, then
getting such worlds from the web should be just as good as getting them
from IG.

If, OTOH, you want sections of your campaign that you can develop
without fear of being "canoned," but you ALSO want to have sections where
you get full support from Traveller\'s very excellent canon, then the blank
worlds policy seems like a pretty good way to go.

Uh, right.

I ordered, and paid for, three hardcovers back in May.  I paid by money
order, because you weren\'t then set up for credit card orders.

To date I have received nothing.  

I am, bluntly, pissed off about this.  You have had my money for over four

I read in Scientific American that if someone took a supertanker, filled
with iron dust (shaved scrap iron) and dumped it across the face of the
arctic sea, the resulting mega increase in growth of some form of plankton
that thrives on the iron would create so much carbon dioxide (or oxygen? I
forget which) that it would trigger an ice age.  Or was it the green house
affect melting the icecaps?  I can\'t remember.  :)

The point is, something so bizarre could be done to a world to unbalance
it\'s ecological or climate systems that the very seas could change, or an
ice age could trigger, or a green house effect or nuclear winter, or any of
a number of devastating things could happen.  Asteroid bombardment for
example, could change not only the climate, but the very continental land
mass.  (Dough!  I said the asteroid word).

All I know is that I have workable rules, a workable character form,
players, a nice adventure...

but no campaign setting I can use.

This capability is inferred in TNE, but not dealt with in detail.  If I 
recall correctly, an Exceptional Success on the astrogator\'s jump entry 
task will result in a favorable change in real-space vector upon exit 
(such as being on-course for a refuelling run around a gas giant).  
Considering the potential for the origin and destination star systems 
having a high relative velocity (to each other), one would have to assume 
that some tinkering with real-space vectors on exit is possible just to 
avoid having to \'catch up\' with one\'s destination system.  Of course, 
this does some violence to physics, which I prefer to simply ignore.

Naturally, some limits have to be imposed by the GM in order to prevent 
silly-assed rock-dropping scenarios.

Although it may have been addressed in earlier versions, in TNE 
(specifically, "Brilliant Lances", I think) it is possible, if you have a 
good sensor lock on a jumping ship, to determine their destination.  It 
is stated that fleeing ships will often detonate nukes in order to break 
enemy target locks (using the nuke\'s \'white out\' effects) prior to jump 
so that they cannot be tracked.

It is further stated that a ship very near an arriving ship\'s entry point 
will be able to detect the event occurring several minutes before the 
other ship actually breaks back into normal space.  Arrival is preceded 
by gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations centered on the point 
at which the arriving ship will break out.

I gained the impression, however, that this phenomenon is extremely 
difficult (practically impossible) to detect at any great distance, which 
rules out \'pre-detection\' of incoming starships by all but the densest 
sensor networks.

Well, it seems like I still get the same target number for some
combinations of skill and attribute.

For example, for the skill, attribute pairs of (0,13), (1,9), (2,5), 
and (3,1) I get a target number of 7 for all of them.

For the skill, attribute pairs of (2,13), (3,9), (4,5), and (5,1) I 
get a target number of 11 for all of them.

I\'m not sure how much better your linear transformation is when 
compared to the T4 linear transformation. It seems to me that _any_ 
linear transformation you pick, you\'re going to end up with some 
combination of skill, attribute pairs that end up with the same 
target number and may seem odd upon analysis.


BTW, I should have probably stated my task variant system a little
simpler than I did, so while I\'ve got you reading this, here\'s
another go in (hopefully) plain english. ;-)


For every task roll, pick a required skill level.

For every skill level above that required, roll 1 half die less.

For every skill level below that required, roll 1 half die more.


That\'s it.


The manner in which the % success changes is pretty much going to be 
different for every combination of skill and attribute tossed into 
the grinder. The horrible list of numbers I posted yesterday 
hopefully bears out this assertion.

I think it would be oxygen (the exhalation of plankton, which are plants)

 Herewith the latest version of the one I proposed...
- -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

 Preamble - Proclamation of the Imperium

 Of the necessity for a strong interstellar government, there is
 no doubt.  That such governments much change over time, to best
 meet the needs of those they serve is equally unquestioned.  As
 has happened in the past, so shall it happen now.  We, Cleon
 Zhunastu, and the Senate in Assembly of the Federation of
 Sylean Worlds, do therefore proclaim the restoration of the
 Grand Empire of the Stars, and of the Rule of Man, that a
 proper interstellar government may once again act for the
 benefit of all.

 Article I - Imperial Governance, Membership, Citizenship

 The Imperium shall exercise no direct governance over any
 member world.  Instead, the purpose of the Imperium shall be to
 provide for the defense of all of the member worlds as a group,
 and to bring the rule of law to the spaces between worlds.
 No interference with local law or custom is contemplated, except
 where such local law or custom is in conflict with Imperial law.

 Any world may, through a recognized representative, proclaim
 allegiance to the Imperium, and in so doing, such world shall
 become a member of the Imperium, equal in status to all other
 members of the Imperium.  Member worlds shall govern themselves
 as they see proper, provided that such government does not
 violate Imperial laws.

 The Imperium reserves to itself the power to create as it sees
 fit governmental entities superior to the member worlds but
 subordinate to the Imperium.  This shall include the power to
 abolish said entities as it sees fit.

 The Imperium reserves to itself the power to create as it sees
 fit bureaus and agencies to carry out and enforce the Imperial
 will.  This shall include the power to abolish said bureaus
 and agencies at it sees fit.

 The Imperium considers as citizens any living recognized
 sophont native to or naturalized by a member world of the
 Imperium, or any living recognized sophont swearing fealty to
 the Imperium directly.  No immunity, protection, right, or
 privilege granted by the Imperium to a citizen of the Imperium
 may be abridged or denied by a member world.

 Article II - The Emperor, Hereditary Succession

 The Powers of the Imperium shall be vested in an Emperor, who
 shall maintain that title and those powers until his death or
 voluntary abdication.  Upon such death or abdication, the title
 and powers shall pass to the oldest child of the Emperor, whether
 by birth or by adoption, provided that the child shall have been
 publicly acknowledged as the rightful heir of the Emperor by the
 Emperor, and providing that there are no conditions which would
 disqualify the child as fit to maintain the Powers of the Imperium.

 Article III - The Moot, Nobility

 The recognized nobles of the Imperium shall provide their
 advice and counsel to the Emperor prior to any legislation or
 action by the Emperor.  The recognized nobles, acting in this
 capacity, shall be designated the Imperial Moot.  The Imperial
 Moot shall have two powers over the Emperor:  They shall have
 the power to declare the dissolution of the Imperium, and they
 shall have the power to disqualify an Imperial Heir Apparent
 from ascending to the Imperial Power.  However, the latter
 power shall only be exercised for just and proper cause.  If
 the Emperor dies or abdicates having provided no heirs either
 by blood or by adoption, or if no heir of the Emperor is found
 fit to maintain the Powers of the Imperium, the Moot shall have
 the power to designate the recipient of the Imperial Powers.
 Should the Moot find it necessary to exercise this power, the
 designee shall be a citizen of the Imperium.

 A recognized noble of the Imperium shall be a citizen granted a
 noble title by the Emperor or by one empowered by the Emperor to
 grant noble titles.  Noble titles granted by member worlds may
 be recognized by the Imperium on a case-by-case basis.

 Article IV - Free Trade

 The Imperium shall support free trade between its members.  No
 member shall engage in piracy or smuggling against another
 member, its agents, or independent shipping emanating
 therefrom, nor allow its territory to be used for piracy or
 smuggling against another member, its agents, or independent
 shipping emanating therefrom, nor shall issue letters of marque
 or reprisal or other permission for ships operating in its
 territory to engage in piracy or smuggling against another
 member, its agents, or independent shipping emanating therefrom.

 Article V - Standards

 The Imperium shall conduct all of its activities according to
 the Imperial Calendar, which shall consist of a Year made up of
 365 (three hundred sixty five) consecutive Days of 24 (twenty
 four) consecutive hours each.  The Days shall be numbered 1
 (one) to 365 (three hundred sixty five) in order.  The day that

 of Year 0 on the Imperial Calendar.  Day 1 of any Year on the
 Imperial Calendar (henceforth Imperial Year) shall be
 designated as an Imperial Holiday, named Holiday.

 The unit of exchange in interstellar commerce, and between the
 Imperium and the member worlds, shall be the Imperial Credit.
 The Imperial Credit shall be valued independently of the value
 of any coin, currency, or value of any member world.  The
 Imperium shall have the responsibility and power to control the
 value of the Imperial Credit.

 The Imperium shall use as its standard of measurement the
 presently accepted standard measures and nomenclature used by
 the Sylean Federation.  These standards shall be designated the
 Standard Imperial Measurement System (SI).

This is an excellent start... I\'ve actually taken to telling my players 
"It\'s an uncertain 3D task, I\'ll be rolling one."  So I don\'t use their
labels.  Yes it\'s a little more "roll-playing" than "role-playing"
but the mechanics are so much quicker that it\'s a win by me.

Works well for me too.  However there are two issues that do need 
consideration:  "Default" skills and Jack-of-all-Trades (JoT).

With the base T4 system, the players get a big jump when they go
from 0 to 1 in a skill.  Are you proposing cutting the "Default"
level to attribute/4?  I think that this might be a bit stiff. That
12 in an attribute only gives a 3 target number and a fifteen
a 4 which leaves the unskilled trying to drive a car fairly hard up.
I think I\'d lean to a "Default" base skill at (attribute/3).  

The second issue is JoT.  I could see several ways to work JoT.  
	1) Target # = (2 * JoT skill level(sl)) + Default Target # (DT#)
	2) Target # = sl + DT#
	3) Target # = sl + (attribute/2)

The first option is closest to the T4 rule set.

The second option slows the power of JoT significantly.

The third option really pushes the first level of JoT value but
keep some balance by slowing further growth.  Overall. probably too
powerful.

I think I\'ll end up using option 1 or possibly 2....  Comments from 
the peanut gallery?

That\'s a cute prime rate.  I wish that\'s what it was here/now.  However,
a mere 2% on Taxes and Insurance seems unlikely.  IIRC, when I bought my
house this year PI for my payments was ~$670 US a month and the TI was another 
~$300 a month, with almost 1/4 of this being "mortgage insurance" since
I had only 5% to put down on the house.  Now on a 30MCr investment with
a 40 year term, one doesn\'t get to the 20% equity level to drop that 
piece of insurance very quickly, especially with a loan based on something
that DE-preciates rather than AP-preciates as a home does.  So it seems 
to me that the payments are too low for the risk that the banks are taking.
If the Imperium is subsidizing trade in the way you suggest, then taxes will
be higher... still pushing up the costs of ownership.

Maybe I should do a little number crunching at home.... :)

    'body' => 'I\'ve been a little busy with Work -- and my T4 game these last few days. Here\'s a 
writeup of what\'s been happening here:

My game happens on Sundays at the Friendly Local Game Store, aka The Comic Grapevine in 
Lodi. We play out in front of the store, and I tell everyone who asks that we\'re playing 
"The latest edition of a classic roleplaying game, Mark Miller\'s Traveller." We used to 
play TNE in the back game room but we moved things out front, displacing the usual 
platoon of munchkin "Money: The Squandering" players. After all, it is up to us hardcore 
players have to enlighten the heathen . . . and what better day for roleplaying 
evangelism than Sunday? 

The game started out with one guy who really wanted to play. I ran it as a one-on-one 
with no demo element until I had other players clamoring to join. Once I had a relaible 
core group of players, I turned the game into a demo and laid down some ground rules, 
after consulting with Doug, the god-king of the FLGS: players will conduct themselves as 
though they were **in public**, not as though they were the subjects of a 
testosterone-overdose experiment; players will attend to personal hygiene before coming 
to the game (I have one guy with this problem; it turns out that he is manic-depressive 
and he lets go of hygenic discipline whenever he forgets his meds. He\'s otherwise a real 
nice guy and a decent gamer).

My players are four adults -- age 25+ adults -- and four kids. The youngest player is 
14, the oldest is 43. The group is, as usual, all male.


The Trav Details: The game is T4, the setting is a modified Core Subsector in Year Zero. 
Since *none* of my players are at all knowledgable as I am about the canonical Imperial 
history, I can play around with it and tailor it to my preferences, and they won\'t give 
me any static about my adherance to canon. I\'ve even gone so far as to mess with UWPs, 
government types and law levels on selected worlds; the result is an early Imperium with 
a dangerous enemy -- the Ardin Star Empire. The Imperium contains 20 worlds -- all of 
the spinward side of the Sylean Main and trailing along the Main to Hazan and Nasea, 
with the excepion of Korolon. The Despot of Ardis, a former Sylean naval officer turned 
charismatic dictator, controls Korolon, Ardis (the capital of the Ardin Star Empire), 
Eneri (site of an active Sylean-sponsored insurgency against the paranoid, obnoxious 
Ardin Duke who rules the world) and all other "explored" worlds along the main (some are 
resisting Ardin occupation, some are not). Ardis has the Class A starport and Eneri has 
a Class B \'port -- the book shows the reverse.

Sylea has just reached TL12, right on the verge of developing Jump-3 (J-3 will be common 
in a couple of years). Ardis is a couple of years behind Sylea (no "FusionPlus" -- I 
interpet this as TL-12 lightweight PPs). 

The Characters: The travellers are members of a noble retinue. The noble is Baroness 
Lita (the character back when the game was a one-on-one), Mistress and Pilot of the 
Sylean Yacht _Baroness_ (real creative name there. . . ). Her majordomo is Sir Basil 
Manzikert, a friend from Her Excellency\'s days in the Navy (a NPC), who serves as 
astrogator/EO/gunner on the ship and as a \'Trav Universe reality check\' for Lita. 
Basil is basically a sage, a guide to the strange universe. Of course, Basil is 
sometimes wrong;). On the engines is Gamester (PC), the quiet high-stakes gambler. The 
steward is Gwen (NPC) a Scout with a checkered past and a slowly growing, ill-conceled 
affection for Basil. The (PC) Doctor is Tyler, a former Navy flight surgeon who was the 
naval attache\' to the former Imperial Counsulate on Korolon. Also flying with _Baroness_ 
is the detatched Scout _Commando_ (formerly SISS _Kushkyn_), captained by Damien, a PC. 
Damien\'s partner is Teian (PC) a former Marine. Finally, aboard _Baroness_ are a pair of 
ex-military PCs (Pete and a name lost in my notes) who are currently bodyguards to  a 
pair of embarked NPC diplomats, both evacuees from Korolon (demo participants playing 
pregen characters).

What\'s Happened: Lita, Basil, Gwen and Robare, a third NPC, now departed, were the 
original crew of _Baroness_. Lita was offered a job of hauling a small package from 
Sylea to Hazan, a considerable journey down the entire coreward length of the Sylean 
Main. Lita was warned that considerable opposition may be arrayed to stop the package. 
The pay was high -- a cool million credits, payable upon success only, no questions 
asked. Lita took the job, hired Basil, Gwen and Robare, and sold passage on the yacht. 
During the second jump, there was a hijacking attempt by an experienced gang of starship 
thieves. Robare was killed -- he took three \'jackers with him. Basil, Gwen and 
Lita were wounded. After healing up and collecting the bounty on the dead 
\'jackers, they hired Gamester to replace the dead Robare. Looking for a high-paying 
short-term job, the party met the scout Damien and the merc Teiman, who connected them 
up with a ticket to assassinate the planet\'s corporate ruler. After tasting the wrath of 
the local cops a time or three, they gleefully pulled off an assassination that has half 
the corps pissed and half running scared. Dodging pira, er, _privateers_ operating under 
Ardin letters of marque and corporate hitmen, the team arrived on Korolon, aka Port 
Royale/Core. In port was the feared Captain Connor Greywolf, master of _Lyr\'s Lady_, as 
well as his sometime lover, Captain Diana Cynders and her ship _Fire of Wine_. Also in 
system was another notorious pirate, Corwin deCosta, self-styled "admiral" of the Ardin 
Navy. Whilst making repairs to _Baroness_ -- repairs demanded by the Korolon Navy, 
reinforced by the pirate vessels, after a tavestry of a \'safety inspection\' that makes 
the worst California OSHA inspection horror story sound like a replay of a game of 
"CandyLand" -- an engineering accident causes a large bolt of electricity to jolt the 
repair robots working in Engineering. The robots working on the ship go berserk and 
attack the crew. Gamester nearly goes to the casino in the sky and Lita is gravely 
wounded. Examination of the wrecked robots reveals that the bots were rigged to berserk 
on command. Lita demands that humans work on _Baroness_, and in a series of incredible 
Robotics, Electronics and Computer taskrolls, Damien and Gamester make every altered 
robot in the highport inventory go berserk! _Fire of Wine_, in for repairs herself, is 
nearly destroyed before the crew gets control. Diana is not happy. Meanwhile, the  
cities of  Korolon begin to treat Syleans and their friends badly -- riots, etc, driven 
by rage against "Sylean Imperialism" and driven by an Ardin covert ops/active measures  
master plan, swamp the world. A representitive of the Sylean Counselate asks Lita to fly 
down and evacuate the counselate. She does -- as does _Commando_ -- and the nobles on 
the staff of the counselate are evac\'d aboard _Baroness_. This re-enactment of Siagon 
\'75 was brought to you by IG, the Comic Grapevine, Rich Ostorero and the Grapevine 
Irregulars. It was _no accident_!

This week: _Baroness_ arrived at Hazan to deliver the mysterious package. Ardin agents 
are having a tough time getting the stolid Hazans to rise against the Imperium, but they 
make one last attempt to stop Lita from delivering the package. The ambush is busted 
with the help of the new PCs that joined the party during the evacuation, the package 
delivered and the payoff -- an Imperial Solar for MCr5 -- is made. The package -- a 
signed, formal _hardcopy_ of the formal treaty between Hazan and the Imperium allowing 
construction of a forward naval base at Hazan for use afainst the Ardins. The party is 
now enroute back to Sylea.

In other words: I\'m having fun running T4. It has it\'s shortcomings, _but so does every 
other game ever printed_. My players are entertained, interest in Trav is increasing 
here and I\'ve convinced my FLGS to stock Trav right alongside the WW, SJG, T$R and 
Palladium products. My FLGS\' distributor tells us that he\'s restocked on T4, the game is 
so popular.

TMLers, it _can_ be done. Believe. Always believe. But _do it_ anyway!

The 45-watt rms value assumes a very efficient crystal -- FAR more efficient than 
quartz.

You want to store _electrical charge_, not voltage. Voltage is analogous to pressure in 
a fluid system -- how hard the \'trons/charges are being pushed through resistance. 
Batteries store charge -- current -- at a certain voltage

The homopole generator turns electrical energy (AC, probably) into mechanical energy via 
a flywheel . . . and releases it by rapidly, and with little loss, converting the 
rotational energy of the \'wheel back into a powerful pulse of electrical current at very 
high voltage.

Nice for pistols . . . if the homopole discharges slowly, it could charge batteries or 
capacitors connected through contact pads in the holster. For rifles, you\'d still need 
the leads.

Problems? System is not truly efficient. Even with superconductors, the rig is as lossy 
as hell. If the supercons can limit the I^2R losses, it might work.

They can...but only *very* slowly. Anything above 5mph would probably be
unstable - the axis of thrust goes through the centre of mass of the
craft, but the axis of force from aerodrag doesn\'t, for example. Craft would
be pretty much at the mercy of the wind. A good pilot might be able to 
compenstate enough to move faster, but it would be hard. 

Basically, "unstreamlined" means "didn\'t care enough to pay for wind tunnel
modelling, vectorable thrust, landing gear, drag reduction, and proper 
design".

The atmosphere is opaque to x-rays - like thick fog to visible light.
You\'d lose about 50% of the beam strength every few metres.

>Tunable over what frequencies?
Generally tunable from the mid-IR up to moderate UV. UV for maximum range,
mid-IR for best performance firing through an atmosphere (though absolute
max range drops somewhat.)

Rich,

This is great to hear!  I\'m glad you\'re helping to make Traveller a 
success in Lodi (I used to live in Antioch, CA - wish I\'d known you back 
then).  I enjoyed reading your account of the adventures thus far.  It 
sounds like you took a pretty random group of players, and turned it into 
an impessive success!

Right.  You know what?  When T4 was just a twinkling in IG\'s eyes, I was 
spouting off about how they should follow the example of CT, and produce 
perfectly edited products.  I was just going over some of that stuff last 
weekend - and it\'s filled with editing errors!  (I\'m talking about first 
printing stuff here - by the time they got to The Travellr Book, they had 
things worked out pretty well.  But take a look at a first printing of, 
say, one of the Library Data books, and you\'ll find run-on sentences, 
improper use of semicolons and commas, etc.)  It was a real eye-opener 
for me.  

What that experience told me was: 1) I was a lot less critical the first 
time around - and perhaps this will hold true for other first-time 
Traveller players, and 2) if what became my favorite game of all time can 
have errors in its first printing, then so can T4.

Kenneth,
I think you have hit on an elegantly simple fix to the target number problem.  I\'ll 
probably give it a try when my group meets on Wednesday.  It\'s simple enough that 
my players won\'t get bogged down in number crunching and close enough to original T4 
that they won\'t get confused by a sudden change of rules.
Thanks,

So, what you are saying is that you would like the blank sectors because you will have 
less re-writing from "official" sources, while the rest of us, who put minimal effort 
into re-writing published material, will have to put in work that we would normally not 
do.  

That doesn\'t seem fair.  You\'re choosing to put in that extra work.  The rest of us, 
OTOH, will be forced to create systems because because they are not there, when before, 
we could just flip open our trusty copy sector information.

	GM:  "OK, guys, where do you want to go now?"

	Players:  "Gee, let\'s jump to this hex."  (pointing to a blank system)

	GM:  (cursing because he didn\'t put in 4 hrs. last night detailing that system) 
 	"Uh, are you sure you guys want to go there?  I forgot to tell you that you\'ve 
	heard some rumors that there is a bad, uh, plague, yeah, that\'s it, a plage is 	
	running rampant through that system."

	Players:  "A plague?  Cool.  Sounds like there might be work for group such as 
	ourselves.  We prey on others misfortune, and they pay us a fortune for it.  	
	Yeah, we\'re all in agreement.  Let\'s head for that system."

	GM:  (wishing he had a supplement with at least a UWP to guide him as he plays 
	off the cuff)  "Rag \'em, frag \'em, %#$*!@!!.  OK, let\'s head that way if you 
	want to."  (looking at his watch) "Say, it\'s getting late.  You guys want to put 
	up and pick it up here next week? (trying to buy time to restructure his plans 	
	and detail the blank system)

	Players:  "Nah, tomorrow\'s Saturday, and we all don\'t have to work.  Let\'s go 	
	ahead and get some more game time in."

	
Anybody who has refereed will agree that the above situation can be all too real.  While 
I agree that some of the best games can come from a night of ad-lib, I always ad-lib 
better if I have some information at my fingertips on which to base my decisions.

My point is this.  You\'re going to change it anyway, so why not go ahead and publish it 
all.  The way I see it, you\'re happy either way, because you are changing it.  A lot of 
us don\'t do a lot of changing, and we don\'t want to be forced to do it.  If we have 
complete published material, then we can both be happy.

One other point I\'d like to mention.  I don\'t just want complete published material 
(read:  no blank sectors, subsectors, or systems), but I want that material to be 
compatible with sector information already published.  If IG decides to go ahead and 
publish complete sector information, but this information is totally new (and does not 
jive with some of the other sector supplements that I own), I\'ll be just as upset.  
Traveller should build upon itself and get better.  I don\'t want to see IG just keep 
reinventing the wheel over and over.

Regards,

Kenneth.

For the Plankton, the iron is a limiting trace element, ie the plankton can
only grow as fast as the amount of iron there is avaiable to it. The
article you refer to is titled _Ironing Out the Greenhouse Effect_, and it
was in Scientific America, but the aurthors and date I\'m not to sure on. I
could look it up if anyone wants.

Just think, the initial steps of a cunning plan to take over a planet is to
seed their oceans with iron and cause the global climate to decline. All
the residents either die, or become severly weakened by the cold. Only
hitch is, you would need to be thinking and planning a few thousand years
in advance.

I want to say first that I really enjoyed your post.  This is why I throw my ideas out 
on the TML--because I like to read discerning opinions, even if I don\'t agree with them. 
 Otherwise, I would just make up a rule and put them in my campaign.  You people keep me 
on my toes, and this ensures a good rule is made.  I want something that I can use now 
and not be sorry for later.

So, thanks for the input.  Now on to your post.

This is true, but I feel I\'m missing your point.  Is this a bad thing?  I wanted a 
system that was ruled by the skill level, but I also wanted attributes to have a 
significant impact on the throw.  I think this system does this.

In the 0-13 combination that you listed, only the attribute matters--just like in T4, 
you use half the ability score.  I just wanted to fix T4 problems--not invent a new 
system--so I am happy with this.

In the 1-9 combination, the attribute picks up any deficiency the character had in skill 
level.  This is my goal of the attribute having a significant impact on the throw.

In the 2-5 combination, the opposite is true.  Skill level of 2, IMHO (hey, I sure an 
glad you people taught me those neat acronyms!), is a pretty good skill. If this was a 
medical skill, the person would be a trained EMT, or last year medical student, or 
senior nurse.  I like how the skill adds more to the target number (+4) than the 
attribute does (+3, for a total target number of 7).

I could go on with the other combinations you listed, but I think you see where I\'m 
going.  

My question to you is what is wrong with the numbers matching up so.  Do you just feel 
wrong about it or feel that it is weighted wrong?  If I\'m missing something, then please 
let me know.

What I was trying to accomplish was a system that was skill based rather than attribute 
based.  You don\'t have a problem with a person (with Pilot-1, Dex-10) having a better 
chance to hit than another with a great skill (Pilot-4, Dex-6)?

I did look at your system, as I am looking at all of the posts on the task system--for 
good ideas.  The problem, for me, was that it strayed too much from the T4 system.  As I 
said in my post, I\'m looking for an easy, minimal fix to the T4 system.  I didn\'t want 
to invent a new, or far altered, system.

On the surface, your system looks great, but it is just not the system for me.  And, I\'m 
sure that my system is probably not right for you.

Very simple and clean.  But what I like about my system is that there are no steps.  The 
target number is already recorded on the character\'s sheet.  All a player has to do 
is look down.  The only question is how many dice to roll, and this has already been 
memorized by my group.  It is easy to remember Auto/1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5.  Like T4, a 
character has only one target number as long as his attribute and skill level remain the 
same.  Some of my players already know their numbers for certain skills, like gun 
combat, by heart.  There is no cross referencing.

I knew that the system in MT would be a hard system to beat, but I think T4 did it.  It 
just needed a few tweaks, which is what I\'ve done to it with my system. 

Thanks for the words,

Kenneth.

A game store in Ottawa has sold out several times on T4, having to re-order.
Yet, here in Toronto (Traveller Free since 1994!) very few people have even heard of it

Actually, I really liked that idea when you first posted it.  I don\'t think I\'ll use it 
 yet because my players are still learning the T4 system, but when we are all 
comfortable with things...

I agree, and I\'m not proposing that.  I wanted to keep changes to the T4 system 
minimal.  I say that default skills still operate at half attribute.  I checked all 
combinations, and this still keeps the default target number well below those that 
are skilled.

Interesting ideas, but as I\'ve said, I want minimal changes to T4.  I\'d keep JOT just as 
it is printed in the T4 rules.  The benefit is that you can use JOT for non-default 
skills at half attribute whereas people without JOT or skill cannot even attempt 
non-default task throws.

Hi Kenneth,

As I mentioned before, I normally agree with the idea that the solution 
that offers the widest range of possibilities is the "correct" solution 
and should therefore be used.  However, I\'m willing to give this new way 
a shot.

That said, let me ask for a clarification from you:  What do you want IG 
to publish - UWPs for every world, with a few detailed worlds (culture, 
maps, etc.), or are you asking for every world to be detailed?

The latter doesn\'t seem reasonable, and I know you\'re a reasonable 
person, so I\'m going to assume it\'s the former.  If I\'m wrong about what 
you want, and I\'ve therefore completely misunderstood what you are saying, 
please let me know. :)

Okay, so I\'m assuming it is a choice between publishing UWPs for every 
world or not doing so - ignoring for the moment the percentage of worlds 
that get UWPs versus those which don\'t.

Given those (very shaky, admittedly) assumptions, it seems to me that 
there isn\'t a lot of work to be done to get where you want to go.  
Rolling up a UWP - even by hand, without the aid of a computer - is a 
task that can be achieved in a matter of minutes.  

If I were refreeing a session such as you set up in your message (where 
the players want to go to one of the "blank" worlds, and I haven\'t got 
any info on it prepared), the most I would have to do in order to get the 
info you want IG to provide is say, "Okay, everyone, let\'s take a 
break.  Refresh your drinks, go to the restroom, stretch.  Be back in 
ten minutes [more to give /them/ enough time than to give me enough time]."

I\'d then roll up the UWP (that\'s what it\'s in the book for, after all! 
=) ) in a couple of minutes, and spend the rest of the time coming up with 
some reasons for why the UWP is the way it is (i.e., low tech, 0 
atmosphere, etc.), and be as prepared as I would have been had IG done it 
for me.

I understand that, had IG provided that for you, there wouldn\'t be a 
necessity for a break.  But, I don\'t see it as being a four-hour ordeal 
to achieve what you want from IG.  

Certainly, if I was uncomfortable with leaving blanks around the area the 
action is occurring in, I could easily have generated UWPs for the ten or 
twenty nearby "blank" worlds before-hand.

\'Course, if we assume I have a computer program that is capable of 
generating UWPs and printing them out, nicely formatted, I could 
generate every UWP for the whole sector in a few minutes. :)


Nice talking to you again,

In fact, nowhere I\'e been to in the entire Greater Toronto Area has got T4,
or even heard of it (with the exception of ScifiWorld, which is apparently
special ordering it).  

Joe, is their some problem here, can IG do anything about it?  They\'re
missing a  huge chunk of potential gamers...including me! :)

I would hope that there was a little analysis in addition to the data
collection, but I agree with your idea. I\'m using small commerical telescopes
and CCD cameras to track, identify, and monitor geosynchronous satellites. Less
than twenty years ago it took millions of dollars and years of development to
acheive similar results.

As to passive detection and identification of distant ships, there are systems
using small telescopes to monitor areas of the sky and automatically detect
objects in the Oort cloud and beyond by watching them pass in front of stars
(i.e., MACHO and related project). Some of the most detailed information on
asteroids has come from occultation observations. When an asteroid passes in
front of a star, it casts a shadow on the Earth in the starlight. If several
observatories observe the occultation, an outline of the asteroid can be
reconstructed from the timings of the disappearance and reappearance of the star
as the shadow sweeps over the Earth. An array of sensors on the hull of a
Traveller starship (especially a large one) or a group of ships monitoring stars
in all directions could not only detect another ship at very great distances,
but also get some idea of its identity from the shape and size of its "shadow".
A lot of stars would have to be watched, but all it takes is improved sensors
and computing power.

Yeah, well up to a point.  

Do you know who Muggsy Boggs is?  The 5\'3" pro basketball player? There
*is* more to it than height.  There\'s also more to it than just dexterity. 
There are is also some psychological factors that aren\'t covered by any of
Traveller\'s Attributes.

Speaking as someone who has played basketball, poorly, for many years...the
skills are NOT fairly simple!  ;->

        OK, how about this:

        Tasks are listed in one of the following ways

        Title: Difficulty, Skill, Characteristic
        This is a "skill-primary" task. Asset = Skill + Characteristic/3
(drop fractions)

        Title: Difficulty, Characteristic, Skill
        This is a "characteristic-primary" task. Asset= Skill + Characteristic/2

        Title: Difficult, Characteristic
        This is a "characteristic-only" task. Asset= Characteristic/2

I\'m using the divider of 2 for the last two, because otherwise the
characteristic is too overwhelming. Impossible tasks are reserved for
way-above-average characters (at least in the particular area). Someone with
only average characteristic and/or skill shouldn\'t have a chance.

        How does this strike you? And how would you handle the case of
having two skills, both of which could contribute to a task? Sum the assets?

Hi Peter,

As I understand it, IG doesn\'t have much control over where T4 books end 
up.  They contact distributors, and try to get them to order.  Then, 
presumably, those distributors who decide to carry T4 tell their customers 
(store owners) about the books.  Some store owners choose to order them, 
some do not.

So, if a given store doesn\'t have T4, it may be because the owner deals 
through a distributor who doesn\'t carry T4 (and you can believe that\'s 
not because IG doesn\'t want them to![G]), or it is because the store 
owner doesn\'t want to carry Traveller (for whatever reason).

Again, that\'s the situation as I understand it.

It would seem to me that the solution is to convince the shop owners that 
it is in their best interest to carry the product.  They can then tell 
their distributors they want to carry it.  If the distributor doesn\'t 
offer it, they may decide to get into contact with IG and pick up some 
copies - if they perceive sufficient demand for doing so.

My personal theory is that there will be good distribution of Traveller 
once there is a traveller "line" of products - when Starships, CSC, 
Aliens, M0, and First Survey are published.  Then, there will be plenty 
of product to fill shelves, there will be plenty to advertise about, etc.

I don\'t know if it\'s a good thing or a bad thing.

It just seems a little odd to me at first glance that zero skill
with a high stat has exactly the same chance of succeeding at a
task as high skill with the lowest possible stat.

When the target number is calculated based on a formula like
"a*skill + b*stat" and the number of dice thrown is based on
difficulty alone, in certain cases a high stat with a low
skill is as good as the opposite.

With a MT-like task system the former would get DM+3 and the latter
would get DM+5. This makes sense to me and for me it makes sense for 
it to work that way.

The the T4 task system skews this a bit. ;-)

Using task system KB v1.1 we get target numbers of 7 & 11. That makes 
sense. All I noticed is that for certain combinations of high & low 
stats & skills the target numbers end up being the same and that 
seems odd to me.

IIRC, the original discussion began when someone noticed that it 
seemed like succeeding at "impossible" tasks appeared to be easier 
than one might otherwise expect. The other point that seemed to come 
up a lot, was the fact that high stat/low skill could easily equal 
low stat/high skill and that seemed odd, too.

In MT, Skill-4 with an average stat is always better than Skill-1 
with a high stat. This seems like a good thing. I suppose I\'m looking 
for the equivalent or better in a T4 task system.

I\'m pretty sure that varying the number of dice thrown based on skill
level should make high level skill give a better chance of success in
comparison to low skill levels for the same task in just about every 
case.

Anytime! ;-)

This is a definite idea here. Maybe we could come up with something like
"steerage class" passage, rather than a low passage, to allow the passengers
to stay awake during the trip, and not require low berths to be
installed...lower overhead, and at least it is *some* profit generated by
that stateroom....

<shrug> Well, "expensive" is a relative term, I\'m afraid. I personally
prefer to keep my players running with a significant cash flow, although I\'m
careful about watching their accumulations. To me, a 2000 Cr overhead charge
per occupant seems a reasonable ballpark figure, given that no other
"overhead charges" get paid for the ship until annual overhaul.

<grin> My father bought a cabin cruiser last year, and I\'ve learned from
watching him just how true it is that "a boat is a hole in the water into
which you throw money". To me, starships are just the same, only more so.

Well, (and I *know* I\'m committing heresy here... gimme a break, money\'s
tight right now!)... I don\'t own T4, and may not get it for some time.
Frankly, I want it, but right now, I\'m still playing with the MT and CT
rules, and I like \'em. It doesn\'t strike me as terribly *bogus*, although it
*is* pretty artificial. After all, isn\'t one of the defining characteristics
of the "gentry" that they *do* want to be just like the folk who are their
nominal betters, and would thus try to buy many of the same things, for the
prestige value, if nothing else? And don\'t look at the changes on a
percentage basis, look at them as absolute changes... there\'s only a 250
Cr/month jump between each social level.

<grin> Your numbercrunching for the engineer assumes one watch in three
*every day*, too... and that\'s a pretty strong workload. He\'s also going to
get the additional benefits of free room and board, too, thus increasing his
effective wage. That retirement pay is also only based on 20 years service,
and if you play with pension numbers in real life a little, you\'ll see how
tiny they are at that age. They really only get *huge* after they get a few
more years to grow -- the miracle of compound interest.

But, about the "200 Cr/month for good food"... it still seems awfully low to
me, at something less than 7 Cr/day for a food budget. I would be tempted to
use a much larger number instead, but that\'s just me, I guess. More on this
later.

<chuckle> I see I\'m still not getting my point across here. That\'s OK, it
took me almost two years to get it through my ex-wife\'s head, and you would
not have *believed* our grocery bills in that time...

Fresh foods will go bad quickly, even under the best of controlled
conditions. Produce is good for about a week or two, at most, even in
optimally controlled temperature and humidity environments, and many items
don\'t get anything like that long. Meat can be frozen, but that often
affects the taste. If not frozen, it rarely is good for more than four or
five days. OK, the stuff might be *edible*... as in, "it\'ll keep you from
starving"... but it won\'t taste nearly as good. Yes, you can eat canned and
otherwise preserved foods... but they so rarely have the same taste and
nutritional value as fresh foods. The US Navy does a lot with frozen foods,
and with an *amazing* variety of canned stuff, but just ask any submarine
sailor about how the food was on the last leg of a mission. He\'ll tell you
it gets pretty bad (compared to the first of the trip... I\'m told it\'s still
decent), just because they don\'t have much left to work with.

Without some *radical* advance in food prep and storage, I\'d require *total*
food replenishment every two weeks at the longest for a passenger-carrying
ship, and every four weeks for any other vessel that might reasonably expect
the crew to endure some less-than-appetizing chow. For *long-distance*
trips, where that just might not be possible, like scout and exploration
missions, I\'d require some sort of sustainability measures to be plotted out
in advance... a cargo container full of MREs, or something like that, with
vitamin supplements. Bringing along a cargo vessel full of stores would be a
good plan, too.

<shrug> I dunno. I think you might be able to get some sort of diet
concentrate that would keep you alive, but it\'d be survival rations at best.
Most of the problem has to do with killing bacteria in the food, and not
damaging the food with extremes of temperature, and keeping the taste
intact. If you want to postulate that, well, go ahead... but it strikes me
as a copout similar to the Star Trek food replicators.

<grin> Then *change it*!! You don\'t like the "2000 Cr for overhead" number,
while I don\'t like the "200 Cr for food" number... but it\'s hardly essential
to the game either way. I think arguments can be made both ways for each
number, and you should pick whichever one suits you and your game best. For
*me* and my motley crew, we like the pricier game. It\'s a personal thing. I
*do* think it fits better with the older price structure from MT and CT that
I use... and maybe it *ought* to be changed to fit in with T4. I will say
that if you take that 200 Cr number for "good food", I think Hans is right
about the overhead charge being too high.

<nodding> Yup, sounds roughly OK to me...like I said above, it just depends
on what number you want to start with. You take the T4 number, and I feel
more comfortable with something derived from the MT numbers.

I also like the idea of *allowing* the ship to charge that much, for
providing "express service", but I especially like the idea of non-fixed
rates for independents anyway. Also, I did like your point about getting a
price break for doing some of the upkeep/routine maintenance works yourself.
My groups tend to be heavy on grunts and traders, rather than techies, so my
folks never really got into that, but it\'s still a good point. You still
ought to have to pay for parts and fungibles and suchlike, but you can save
labor costs that way.

Like I said before.  However IG does it, I\'ll buy it, but I prefer complete information. 
 I\'d be much more excited about it if IG published complete stuff.

You haven\'t misunderstood.  Let me be very clear.  I want complete UWPs on every world 
in the sector.  I want the new published data to be compatible with the old data that 
has been published.  This means that the Solomani Rim will still look like the Solomani 
Rim that I know.  The Spinward Marches will still be the Spinward Marches that I know.  
The sectors published by DGP in their magazines and supplements will still be the same 
(I know that there was a problem with the Judges Guild Ley and Gateway Sectors, but I\'d 
like the info as complete and compatible as possible.)

Compatible means that the UWPs can be altered somewhat to reflect a specific milieu, 
i.e. the pops, TL, Law, Govt, Starport, etc can be altered for different times in the 
planet\'s history, like what was done in TNE, but the planet size, atmos, hydro, etc 
should stay the same.  The planet should be recognizeable to its stats in the 1100\'s.

I\'d also like to see IG detail SOME of the worlds in each sector.  I mean completely 
detail them--outer planets and all things in the system.

If IG likes, I have no problem with them designating certain worlds as untouchable and 
reserved for referee use.  These planets would still have an official name and UWP, but 
IG would designate not to develop them in any supplements.  

I think this would solve the problem.

As you said in your post, in some instances, quickly rolling a UWP is not a difficult 
matter.  I don\'t want to get off on the tangent of time--I was using that to illustrate 
my point.  And that point is, I want complete, official info.

If others want to change it in their campaigns, then they can do it.  Why force this 
blank system thing on the many of us who don\'t want to see it?  I think doing the names 
and UWPs on the systems that they were going to leave blank is a great idea.  Secure 
these areas for GMs.  Those GMs that detail the system can either choose to use the 
official name and UWP, or they can change it to suit their needs.

The problem is, the people who are changing are still changing.  We who are not changing 
are forced to change when we don\'t want to.  Hey everyone, the system is not broke as it 
was before.



While we are talking about this, do you want to know what I\'d really like to see?

I\'d like to see IG come out with some supplements detailing sectors.  This could be a 
series with one sector per book, or some bigger unit, like doing all the domains 
together.  These would have names and UWPs for every world.  Some proportion would be 
detailed heavily with info on the entire systems, main planet, and space stations and 
objects.  There would be a section on sector politics, economics, governments, local 
races, local NPCs, adventure hooks, maybe a small, complete adventure, etc.

These could be milieu specific, or they could cover all time periods by having 
information pertinent to different times in the Imperium\'s history.  IG could designate 
some of the planets as non-developed sites for those referees who support the blank area 
idea.

Yeah, that\'s what I\'d like to see.

Now, let\'s talk about IG implementing some sort of statistic to the UWP that relates how 
far a system is off the galaxy mean plane so that we could have a 3D Traveller Universe.

I mean, heck, it is almost the year 2000!  A space game should have some game mechanic 
to implement three dimensions.

But, I guess that\'s a discussion for another time...

Did I answer your question, Joe?

Thanks for the kind words, John.  Gee, it feels good to do something right.

Please let me know how your game goes.  I\'d like to hear if you found any holes, or how 
your players responded to the system.

Are you using the T4 difficulty dice (Auto/1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4), or are you using my 
system (Auto/1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5)?

I always read this the other way.  The real-space vector is
unalterable, and it takes an exceptional success to position your exit
point accurately enough that the vector will just drop you into orbit.
If you mess this roll up, then although you come out at the right
planet, you come out with your vector pointing in the wrong direction
(the far side, above or below it, etc).

This is the result of a failed roll to position the exit point.  You
then have to burn in to catch up with the planet.

I play it as positioning the exit point, since you can jump to either
side of the planet, and don\'t necessarily have to jump directly
towards it, then the vector can be set up on leaving to become the
orbital insertion vector at the far end.

This is not true.  Under my fix, a target number for a default skill is half the 
attribute--just like in T4.  If you have a skill, then this is doubled and added to half 
your attribute.  There is no way a zero skill character with a high stat will have the 
same target number as a character with the lowest possible stat, but high skill.

Let\'s look at this.  Charlie has no gun combat skill, but his dex is awesome--Dex 15.  
His target number would be 8, and rightly so for a person with such a natural ability.  
After all, he\'s got the highest dex of any man ever known to live.

Ok, compare Charlie to Doug.  Doug has a wonderful gun combat skill, level 7, but he\'s 
also almost crippled in the dex department--Dex 2.  Under my fix, Doug would have a 
target number of 15.  This is much higher than Charlie\'s 8.  

This is a skill based system.  Natural ability can only take you so far.  And, with 15 
being the highest stat, no zero level character will ever have better than an 8 target 
number--unless DMs push it up.  And 8 is the average point on both my and the T4 
difficulty system.  So, this is saying that the best ability can only make you average 
if you are not trained.  

Now if Charlie get\'s training, combined with his phenomonal natural ability, he\'ll be 
someone to reckon with.

Sure, this makes sense.  I really liked the MT system.  As a matter of fact, I had 
converted TNE to the MT task system and was using that before T4 came out.  But I\'ve got 
to say, T4 has a better system.  Attributes mean more than they did in MT.  

You could only get a 0, +1, +2, or +3 modifier for attribute in MT, and the +3 only 
came when you had the highest stat possible.  T4 came along with a cleaner, simpler 
system that really takes advantage of natural ability (stat).  My system fixes the bias 
towards attribute without minimizing it like in MT.  My system says skill means the 
most, but natural ability helps too.


> Using task system KB v1.1 

Hmm.  Task System KB v1.1.  I really like that.  Thanks, I\'ll use it!

Yeah, I, uh, actually started that thread after my player had a 44% chance at an 
impossible task with a skill-4 and stat-9.  This is why I\'ve changed staggering and 
impossible tasks to 4 and 5 dice.

I don\'t think this is odd.  Natual ability should count for something.  What I\'m saying 
is that it should not count as everything.

Low stat/high skill means the person benefits from skill more--which is what we want.

High stat/low skill means that only sometimes, at very high attribute levels, does a 
person benefit from natural ability more.  Since we are doubling skill, it catches up 
with the half attribute real quick.

My system does this, but natural ability counts for more than it did in T4.  I think 
that this is a good thing.  Here\'s your example with my system.

Peter:  Skill-4, Stat-7			Mary:  Skill-1, Stat-15
Target number is 12			Target number is 10

The high skill still wins out over high ability eventhough Mary has the highest ability 
possible.  Natural ability counts for something, but training means more.

Maybe you misunderstood my system, because as I have shown you above, my system does 
this as well--and it does it with minimal changes to the system published in T4, which 
was my goal in the first place.

So, bring it on back, David.  Did I clear up this thing any?

Sincerely,

Kenneth.

I\'ve got a friend who\'s been collecting comics, and for years, he\'s been buying many 
from this guy who operates out of his house.  So, I\'m with my friend the other day, and 
he decides to stop by the comic guy\'s place to get his monthly fix.  I\'m there for the 
first time, and what do I find?  

Traveller Stuff!  Yes, beautiful, mint condition, never been purchased before, original 
CT Traveller Stuff.  I was in heaven.  

I purchased all he had.

I got the first edition of Snapshot, unopened, still in the wrapper!  I just love it.  
Ain\'t life grand?  

The guy said life is funny that way.  He\'s had it since it was published in 1979.  It\'s 
been through two stores that he\'s owned, and nobody has ever bought it.  He saw how 
flabbergasted I was, and he mentioned that it was just ironic that he\'s had it all these 
years only to have it fall into the hands of a true Traveller fan--someone who can 
really appreciate it.

Well, I\'ve filled in some missing holes in my collection, and I let my gaming group pick 
their spoils.  To my dismay, I still have some items left.

And, like my Snapshot boxed set, I thought that I would give these wonderful pieces of 
literature a chance to find a home with someone who would really appreciate them.

What better place to do this than on the Traveller Mailing List?

So, sharpen your pencils for your Christmas lists, I\'m going to do my first Traveller 
Auction.

postage will be over and above the bid price.

E-mail all bids to me directly at dreamer@brokersys.com.  If two equal bids are sent, 
then I will look at the time sent as the deciding factor.  The auction is open to 
everyone, and you don\'t have to be on this list to bid.

If they do that sort of thing deliberately, then they are more
interested in being a pain than in playing the game. And as such, I\'d
nail them big time.

Players that try to make things awkward for the GM *need* to be taught
that it\'s no more acceptable than cheating on rolls or trying to
"ignore" inconvenient rules. The game is there for everybody to enjoy.
Being a pain is not a good idea.

Or use the idea for a Retief story. You are cheerfully importing
hi-tech household appliances (and possibly getting a government subsidy
for doing so). It\'s just amazing that you can sell so many to this poor
planet. 

At the same time, the local guerillas are getting high tech weapons
from *somewhere*. But the local authorities are going nuts trying to
figure out *where*.

The two items are related. You see, you sold the local guerillas the
fact that certain components from the appliances can be used in
combination as the basis for weapons. You need to make stocks and some
connecting pieces, but even so.... :-)

By the time the local government figures it out, it\'ll be too late.
Even if they attempt to confiscate the appliancs, the parts will be
stripped faster than they can confiscate things.

Slight problem. The direction "towards Mecca" depends on the time of
day, and time of year, because the planet *rotates*, and it also moves
in it\'s orbit. As a good example, consider the direction "towards
Orion\'s Belt" from Earth. That too depends on time of day, and time of
year. 

Look up "local Sidereal time" in a good reference on astronomy. A given
star (other than the pole star or stars) will always be in the same
direction at the same local sidereal time. But the sidereal day on
Earth is something like 14 minutes shorter than the solar day (it
invoves the ratio between the solar day and the year)

It\'ll be the same direction to *far* more accuracy than any human is

He didn\'t say that. He\'s assuming that the text *is* subject to

that.

Better yet, how will they handle the requirement that months start when
the new moon is first *observed*? Even on Mars that\'ll be a problem. If
they go with "observed at Mecca", it\'ll take *weeks* or *months* for
the news to get to various stars.

I\'m about 10 digests behind due to being off - but catching
up fast - so forgive me if you\'ve already heard all this.

While I was away, \'Dark Star\' turned up in the post.  No, not
the fanzine edited by Graver which had (5?) issues back in
the 80s, this a new (irregular) fanzine from TMLer Phil
McGregor.

For those who want to buy a copy it\'s definitely worth it
(and no, Phil, didn\'t pay me to say this!).  The first issue
entitled "An Occasional Traveller Resource" has some 30 pages
and articles on Vilani Noble ranks and Equipment
Compatibility.  It also has an alternate character
genearation system (expanded in certain areas from MMT) and a
revised Skill list (additional skills, modified skill
applications and modified skills).  There was also a half
page \'Trader\'s Corner\' with three items I want to buy *now*!

I haven\'t had a chance to wade through the char gen and
skills sections yet but they look thorough and workmanlike and for
those who think the chapter on character generation in MMT is
less than ideal might well be worth checking out.

The articles on the Vilani and Equipment, I found
interesting, well conceived (though a few minor quibbles
crept in!) and thought provoking.  Certainly they would
provide some good ideas for just about any campaign/adventure.

The only noticeable lack was that of graphics, anyone with
any skill in this area could contribute *something*, but you
might argue about how useful a graphic is anyway.

Have to go, but personally, I\'ll look forwared to issue 2 and
not hesitate in recommending this to any T devotee.

You seem to be operating under a *very* mistaken impression here. What
*I* have heard people asking for is that there be areas that IG doesn\'t
detail. So for those, all that would officially exist would be the
partial data available without visting the systems. And they\'d likely
be listed in either supplements that cover *large* areas, or in
something that is rather explicitly marked as only having partial data.

Anything you buy that has full data for a region won\'t cover these
regions.  So it\'d be no different from having full data for Spinward
Marches and Solomani Rim, but nothing for many other sectors (except
the partial data from Atlas of the Imperium).

Sorry, but Traveller has *never* been done that way! 

CT had a couple of Subsectors, and slowly added things to give some
sectors in different areas, few of them connecting. And refs were
*expected* to come up with their own areas. MT continued the
trend, but Atlas of the Imperium had *partial* data for most of
imperial space.

Frankly, I was starting to get *very* annoyed because there weren\'t any
"unexplored" areas near any of the official ones. So I couldn\'t set up
a campaign that had folks actually exploring "new" areas, unless I
moved them clear off the map. And I\'m not the only one. 

Do things your way and a ref who wants to run an "exploration and
contact" type game has to scrap *all* the official material, simply
because either his players *will* read it, or some "official" item will
screw him over by having a major detail that conflicts with his stuff.

It\'s a problem because (for example) about the time you have folks
exploring your "unexplored" area, GDW would decide to stage a major war
there, or do something else that essentially rendered the "official"
background *useless* from then on. 

Having areas set aside for "referee use only" means that can\'t happen.
It\'s a lot less likely that you\'ll get your background jerked out from
under you.

The Fifth Frontier war was an annoyance. The Rebellion, and everything
that followed warped all available materials more and more in
directions that I had no interest in following. 

Official material might as well not be there if it disrupts a GMs
campaign. And having stuff like "new" sector data that *depends* on an
"official plotline" gets pretty frustrating. 

It\'s one thing to detail an area, knowing that it\'s "free". It\'s quite
another to do so and constantly have to deal with things like official
library data that conflicts, new players who "know" things that aren\'t
true, etc.

Full data pisses people off because it means that they have data that
is useless to them, and worse, that GETS IN THE WAY when trying to do
their own version.

You are *assuming* that "books" would have some sections detailed and
some not. That\'s a *damned* stupid way to do it. Books should covered
the detailed areas. Other books can give the (much lesser) details for
the "free" areas. 

That way refs like *you* can skip the "overview" type books, and just
buy the ready to use ones. I can buy the ready to use ones that border
a likely free area and grab an overview book for the stellar positions,
and go from there. 

I want official areas that border "ref only" areas so that I can base
the players somewhere consistent, but still have them exploring unkown
territory.

No. The idea is that by keeping a certain minimal consistency in the
"free" areas, it makes it easier for folks to post neat ideas for
specific systems, which other refs can grab if they want to. 

The online stuff wouldn\'t be canon, it\'d be "this is the neat idea I
came up with for this hex". And both fanzines and JTAS could carry such
items too as being examples of how some folks have detailed things.

A tired looking man is stopped and asked to show his ID by a pair of
SolSec agents. He carefully withdraws an ID folder from an inner pocket
with two fingers (which immediately lets anyone watching *know* that
this man is both *very* familiar with weapons and also familar with the
proper way to avoid giving the impression he is reaching for one).

He opens the folder, flips to a card and displays it to one of the
agents who reads it and turns white. The other raises a scanner to scan
the card before he reads it... The scanner readout flashes "valid ID"
and also a *very* high security code. The second agent then looks at
the card...

	The bearer of this card is not to be delayed, detained or
	imprisoned under ANY circumstances. He is to be given the
	fullest co-operation...

(Basicly, the SolSec version of the old CIA "Get out of Jail free" card
they issued in Nam... :-)

	Last night I met upon the stair,
	A little man who wasn\'t there.
	He wasn\'t there again today,
	I think he\'s with the CIA...

I guess you didn\'t read the "Ship\'s Locker" item in JTAS about the new
SolSec issue dummy grenades with explosive pins? The ones that exude an
instant set glue when pulled?

But then, you didn\'t *need* those fingers anyway. :-)

I never said Gas Giants were affected. But Hydro can be. Low hydro can
be reduced even further by planetary bombardment (throwing rocks). All
you have to do is heat a thin atmosphere a bit and the rate of hydrogen
(and thus water) loss goes *way* up. Ditto for atmosphere. If somebody
dumps enough small rocks or a few *big* rocks, the planet\'s atmosphere
can change rather drastically.

It\'s also possible to *increase* the hydro or atmosphere by throwing
comets. 

For example, we actually could give the moon an atmossphere that would
last for 10-100 thousand years! just arrange to "soft land" a few
hundred comets.

The atmosphere could *easily* slide to (or from!) tainted at the same
pressure. And the hydro might change by a category as well. I\'m not
certain, but I think that Earth\'s Hydro percentage varies with the ice
age cycles.

Check out the real world. Smuggling seems to work one of two ways.

1. You buy the cargo outright at the local price, and if you succeed in
   getting it thru, sell it at whatever you can get at the other end.
   Profits tend to depend on risk factors. Smuggled drugs are *very*
   risky and you make a big profit. Smuggled watches aren\'t too risky,
   and the profit is lower (basicly you are just avoiding customs
   duties).

2. You are a paid "courier". You get a hazard bonus, but it isn\'t
   anything near what the profit is. You are usually carrying the stuff
   from one *organization* to another. They *will* have a handle on
   you, be it family, addiction, or just being spread out over all the
   places you are likely to run to.

Number 2 is a *lot* rarer, and is *only* workable if the contracting
groups have a reasonable assurance that the courier *won\'t* skip.

Case number one is overwhelming the case for things like drugs, booze,
and tobacco. Since you are either picking up the cargo where it is
*legal* and cheap, or at least where it can be obtained without too
much trouble, the cost is quite low compared with the selling price.

Look up details on how things like heroin or cocaine move. The folks
who grow the plants get paid $50-100 which is several times what they\'d
get for a normal, legal crop. The folks that bought that process it at
a cost of a hundred or less in chemicals and a day or so\'s work to
produce the drug. They now have somethiong they can sell for $5-10k.
This gets bought by the smuggler who can turn his $5-10k investment
into at least $100k in payoff. And the distributors he sells to cut it
and the resulting stuff will sell on the street for $10 million or so
(after going thru at least a couple more levels of handling).

So if a smuggler gets caught with "$100 million street value" in drugs,
it\'s no big deal on the sending end. They are out *maybe* $10k. And if
it was a cash up front deal, like most, they aren\'t out anything. They
just make up another batch and find another optimist to try to deliver
it. 

Quite literally, all the anti-smuggling efforts amount to is a *price
support* system for the folks receiving the smuggled goods (assuming
it\'s something with a relatively "fixed" demand, like drugs)

Drugs have a lot of variations. Including nasties like Jack Chalker\'s
"sponge" from the Well World series. "Sponge" isn\'t a drug per se. It\'s
the only known *antidote* to a rather nasty parasite. The trouble is,
the antidote only *stops* the infestation, it doesn\'t cure it. If you
don\'t get your dose in time you can feel the parasite working on you
rather painfully. Go without long enough and you are a pain wracked
vegetable...

The big problem with the organ trade is typing & cross matching. And
the storage problems. In combination, they\'d tend to make it a
self-limiting trade. You have to find a matching donor, and *kidnap*
them unless they are in the same system as the person who needs the
organ. Especially since, given the com lag, you can\'t know if they\'ve
*already* found a donor. Which is safer? Kidnapping the "donor",
shipping him (in low berth) to the destination and then shipping him
back if they already have one, or stealing the organ, and then
discovering that you\'ve wasted your time?

Given that some "donations" are going to be fatal, I\'d rather slip the
guy into a low berth. Among other things, while there\'s added risk in
the shipping, you *know* where to get the organ the *next* time the
customer needs one.

Not really. The weapons market is rather limited. First of all, the
weapons people want, aren\'t cheap (except in rare cases where what they
want is the equivalent of a standard issue combat rifle!). So that cuts
into your profits, as there *is* a limit to what folks will pay. 

Second, it\'s an inherently *dangerous* business. You are *guaranteed*
to be dealing with heavily armed people, usually on *their* turf. They
may occasionally decide that they would rather get this current
shipment for free than keep getting "ripped off" by your "exorbitant"
prices.

Slight problem. If you were given passage on a flying saucer to a world
at 1920 tech level, what could you sell them in the way of technical
plans? Answer: Damn little. They can\'t *make* most of the stuff that\'s
interesting. They don\'t have the technology to build the *components*.
Nor the infrastructure to make good use of most of it.

While in reality, it\'d be a lot more complicated, I\'d say that given
full specs *and theory*, a civilization could duplicate items one tech
level higher, but only as expensive and rare items. Items two tech
levels out can\'t be duplicated AT ALL.

This makes some sense. If they could easily produce an item at a given
tech level, they\'d *be* at the that tech level. 

But going back to my example of 1996 vs 1920, consider this. They can\'t
duplicate a jet fighter because they can\'t produce most of the
*materials* used. Titanium takes *very* specialized handling or else it
is brittle. It also has to be machined and formed under very
non-standard (for 1920) conditions. To start with, you need to process
it in a vacuum furnace to remove hydrogen. They don\'t have the tech to
build the furnace!

Carbon fiber, anything with semiconductors, all require purity levels
that aren\'t achievable with chemical processing tech of the period. So
you have to tell them how to build the tools to build the parts. And
take that back thru several regressions.

There *will* be the occasional idea that is doable at a lower tech
level, but wasn\'t discovered there. But those are essentially random
occurences. It\'d take unusual insight by both buyer *and* seller. And
unless we want to detail tech stuff to ridiculous levels, it\'d all have
to be doubletalk anyway.

A couple of examples I happen to know of:
1. "composition" (aka "carbon") resistors could have been made any time
   after electricity was discovered. It just never occured to anyone
   until WWII or so.
2. Electroplating. There\'s some speculation that it was discovered by
   accident in ancient mesopotamia. Even if it wasn\'t, a simple "cell"
   suitable for plating gold onto most metals is possible at *very* low
   tech levels.

Could you *please* use standard quoting. It makes it *very* hard to
read your stuff, especially when you are quoting stuff with several
levels of older quotes in it.

The same goes for the fellow who is not using any quote markers at all.
If my read wasn\'t "threaded" I\'d be *completely* unable to figure out
his posts.

There *is* a standard for quoting on the Internet. And not only does
most software use it, there is software that *requires* it to work
properly. 

The standard is essentially this:

Add the string "> " to the lefthand end of any lines being quoted for
the first time. Add the string ">" to the lefthand end of any string
that has already been quoted. 

Also, while line lengths are unlimited, it is considered polite to keep
original text postings to a line length of no more than 72, so as to
allow for quoting without requiring re-wrapping of lines (due to 80
column limits on many displays)

I don\'t quite understand your argument here. My whole point was that when
you think about the implication of the rules (the percentages), it turns
out to be highly artificial. That\'s just why I consider it bogus (But
perhaps I\'m using that word incorrectly?)

I\'d expect workloads to be less strenuous while in jump. While this need not
be true for engineers it certainly is true for astrogators and pilots... and
they get higher wages than engineers. Every other week off... not bad working
conditions, IMO. (Though I\'d invest a goodish bit of that salary in books and
tapes and computer games ;-)

That just makes the standard crew salaries even more disproportionate.

That\'s just because you\'ve assumed that the credit is worth less than the
rules actually imply. The problem isn\'t any one figure; it\'s two figures
that on examination seens disproportionate.

As you yourself mention, we\'ve already got something that is a lot better
than that (army rations). Besides, frozen food isn\'t quite as bad as you

It strikes you as a cop-out to assume that people in the future can do things

Thanks for the advice, but that solution has already occurred to me. ;-) I\'m 
not arguing because I desperately need Marc Miller to changes the rules so 
that I can do so too. I\'m perfectly capable of doing so on my own, thank you
very much. I\'m arguing because I percieve this as an inconsistency in the 
rules (and also because I like a good argument ;-). I\'m arguing for the same 
reason I\'d argue against anyone who claimed that a passenger ship design with 
jump-6 engines and 2 passenger cabins makes sense on the regular jump-1 run 
between Sylea and Ordun. 

>I think arguments can be made both ways for each
>number, and you should pick whichever one suits you and your game best. 

I disagree, and actually, so do you. As you yourself say, Cr2000 makes good
sense, if the credit is worth what you percieve it to be, but in that case
food prices should be much higher. It would also makes sense if there were
something rare and valuable consumed on every trip, but I can\'t think of
anything plausible. Perhaps there are other explanations that could reconcile 
the two figures, but I can\'t figure one out. Until someone does, I\'ll 
maintain that a Cr2000 overhead is unreasonably big.

>>>My own personal games usually have a *very rough* approximation of 2 Cr =

Whereas the prices quoted for food and lodging suggest that 1 Cr = US$ 1.5 to
US$ 2 is closer to the mark.

Well, the official answer (since all the way back in Classic Traveller) is
that each occupied stateroom costs Cr1000 per week for "life support".
Referee are, of course, encouraged to change this figure if they want to
alter the economics of their campaigns.  However, the standard Cr 1000 seems
to work well with the "standard" costs for High and Middle passage.

Obviously, this would include food, drinks (of the non-water variety) and
water (for drinking and other purposes).   I tend to see Traveller starship
food, particularly for High Passengers, as Good Food - rather like the
offerings of railroad dining cars in the heydey of the passenger train - and
not pre-processed tasteless mush that typifies Airline Food in today\'s
deregulated environment.  As you point out, this is probably still only a
small part of the cost.

The fee should also include all of the ongoing non-maintainance costs of
operating the life support system.  This would include replenishing the
atmospheric gasses (no life-support system will be perfectly loss-free, and
there\'s probably a regulation to the effect that the reserve tanks must be
topped off before the ship can load passengers).  There are probably also
components that have to be replaced regularly - water and air filters,
chemical "scrubbers" containing catalysts or reactants that maintain the
atmosphere\'s proper composition, and other components designed for
replacement after every trip.

There\'s probably also a (large) fee for properly disposing of the
life-support system\'s waste products: used filters, catalysts, and
reactants, concentrated bodily wastes from the crew and passengers (this may
be considered a biohazard on many worlds), and just plain garbage.

There\'s probably even a charge for those little paper bands they put around
the \'freshers that say "sanitized for your protection".  ;-)

It\'s possible that some of the Cr 1000 covers the cost of mandatory
inspections of the life-support system.


OPINION: In my own campaigns, non-commercial starships (that is, ones that
don\'t carry paying passengers) can get by with paying considerably less for
life-support.  This is because they\'re exempt from all but the most basic
inspections (and the cost of complying with the regulations) that are
required for passenger-carrying ships.  They can also skimp on the food,
since there aren\'t any High Passengers to complain about the lack of fresh,
tasty food.  On one particular detached-duty scout, the only food aboard for
was the captain\'s huge pot of authentic Solomani-style chili that was kept
simmering in the galley for the entire week.

The first bit, Imperial buildings barring weapons, is one of the joys of
being a government.  You get to set the rules.  Even in US states were
there are CCW laws, you still can not carry in government buildings.
I know of people who have, when reporting for jury duty for example, 
stop at the bailiff\'s desk, and check in their pistol.  They just pick
it up on the way out.

For the second part, that probably means there are still a surplus of  
lawyers in Imperial Year 0. :-)  If a private business is going to bar
legal carry, they are then responsible for your safety (Warning!  I am
not a lawyer, but I do follow these kinds of threads on USENET.  Your
kilometerage may vary).

Now keep in mind that Sylea is wired to the gills and the police can tap
every camera in the area (and everyone has one!) almost instantly.
Technology today can pinpoint shots fired to a few meters through the use
of remote microphones.  Add a few tech levels to this. 

Also remember that in order to legally carry a cP-03 into a private
building, you need an Imperial Weapons Permit.  As my local CLEO says,
"People who apply for permits, I don\'t worry about."  Also keep in mind a
\'Real Life\' model.
In the US, states that issue CCW permits only see about 2-4% of the
population actually apply for them.  So the odds are that, in any given
store with less than a hundred people in it, odds are that no one is
legally armed.  Well...ok,
there are probably dozens of Blur spray cans. :-)

You also left out the third part, no legal carry in private homes without
the owners permission.

        OK then, let\'s replace basketball with caber tossing then.  Skills
are basically what a) staying sober long enough b) to pick up a telephone
pole and c) lob it gracefully :)?  So basically, someone with STR 9 CABER 4
would have an advantage over someone with STR 15, but once Mr. Mor Muscle
(that is a joke, and not a typo, incidentally) acquired CABER 1 or 2, the
playing field would be at least level...

        This "feels" OK, but I\'d wanna wait to see the numbers before
deciding on anything.  Doing it this way would mean that the
characteristic-primary tasks would be easier to succeed at, and
characteristic-only somewhat less so, at a given difficulty level, which
isn\'t immediately intuitive.  Maybe you could run them through your
spreadsheet at some point if you get the chance?

        As for equally useful skills, I\'d say use the most obviously useful
one or average the two, rounding up to provide for synergy, or lower the
difficulty level by one for every three dots in an also-applicable skill.

        Well, actually, I don\'t see why something like that wouldn\'t be
extremely useful, even if it wouldn\'t generate enough wattage to run a
FGMP: it could be used to run all sorts of personal electronic gear, and
perhaps building them into vacc suits could prolong their max wearability,
that sort of thing?

        "Nemo me impune lacessit"?  A lot of the Highland units use it.  I
forget what it means exactly, but I thinkit means something along the lines
of "I leave no-one who messes with me un-raunched upon".  Or words to that
effect.

Hi Rob, Glenn (Amused to Death), and Daniel,

Just a thought: Have you tried calling IG?  When I am dissatisfied with 
the products or services I pay for, that is normally what /I/ do, and I 
usually get good results.  Perhaps it will work for you...?

Or, have you already gone that route?

    'body' => 'The recent discussion of economic problems in Traveller made me decide to
post what I\'ve got so far in my attempt to work out a consistent set of
economic rules for Traveller. I spent last night collating all my notes.
Although the result is quite long (I hope not too long for you), they are
very far from complete, but I figure that if I wait until I\'m completely
satisfied with them, I\'ll never get them posted!

Note that this is the way I think things ought to be in Traveller (and the
things are in _my_ Traveller universe), not what I think the rules say now.
If you don\'t agree with me, fine; you\'re free to say so. But I\'d much rather
hear about any _internal_ inconsistencies you spot. 

Anyway, here we go:



                        Basic economics for Traveller
                        =============================

Prices are expressed in local "credits". 1 credit (Cr) is one hour\'s pay for 
an unskilled worker regardless of what the local coinage is called. Imperial 
currency is called "Credits, Imperial" (Crimp) and can be (often is) worth
more than local credits since these depends on the economic strength of the
individual world. See _Trillion Credit Squadron_ page 32 about exchange rates. 
Crimps are worth the same as the credits of a world with a Class A starport 
and the maximum TL of the Imperium  --  12 in the Year 0, 15 in 1105, etc.

Note: The credits are what is left over after taxes and after accounting for
dependents. If taxes are 50% then an unskilled worker would actually be paid
2 credits per hour. If the average earner supports 3 dependents he would get
4 credits (after taxes) and so on.


INCOME

Income usually depends on how respected an occupation is in the local 
society. Decide what social standing most practitioners of an occupation 
would have. The average salary for a competent, fully qualified member of 
that occupation can then be determined from the tabel below. Remember to 
adjust for taxes and usual number of dependents.

   SS     Hour     Day       Month     Year
    1     0,9        9        225      2700
    2     1,2       12        300      3600
    3     1,6       16        400      4800
    4     2,0       20        500      6000
    5     2,4       24        600      7200
    6     2,9       29        725      8700
    7     3,4       34        850     10200
    8     4,0       40       1000     12000
    9     4,6       46       1150     13800

Incomes for social standings 10+ are highly individualistic and more or less
impossible to give general rules for.
 
Also note that though the correlation between social standing and income is
high, it is not 1. Some societies may pay well for having jobs considered
socially demeaning performed. Some religious figures may be poorly paid yet
highly respected, etc. Other considerations may also play a part. In pre-
industrial societies mercenaries are for example usually a lot more expensive 
than regular soldiers before and during campaign season, but can often be 
hired for little more than room and board during winter.


LIVING EXPENSES

Inn or hotel accomodations        day/week
  Common room                      2 / 10
  Bad room                         4 / 20
  Medium room                      8 / 40
  Good room                        2 /100

Restaurant food               poor/medium/good
  Breakfast                     1 /   2  / 3
  Lunch                         2 /   3  / 4
  Dinner                        3 /   6  /15
  Banquet                       - /  20  /60
  Full board/per day            5 /  10  /20
Local booze      
  Low alcohol, mug             0.5/   1  /1.5
  Medium alcohol, glass        0.5/   1  / 2
  High alcohol, shot           0.5/   1  / 2
Imported booze
  Medium alcohol, glass         - /   3  /7.5
  High alcohol, shot            - /   3  / 7 


LONG-TERM SUBSISTENCE (per month)

  Starvation level: Minimum food, Cr60. Dismal lodging, Cr60. Minimum 
necessities, Cr30.
  Subsistence level: Reasonable food, Cr150. Acceptable lodging, Cr150. 
Bare necessities, Cr150.
  Ordinary level: Good food, Cr200. Good lodging, Cr200. Basic necessities,
Cr200.
  Good living: Fine food, Cr400. Fine lodging, Cr400. Necesseties and 
comforts, Cr400.
  High living: Luxury food, Cr600. Luxury lodging, Cr600+. Necessities and
luxuries, Cr600+.

As a rule of thumb it can be assumed that a person can just keep up a life-
style that fits his social status for SS+2 * 50 credits per month (Ie. a 
person with SS 1 needs Cr150, one with S 2 needs Cr200, etc. Of these money
2/3rds goes to food and lodging and the rest to other stuff (clothes and 
other necessities and comforts). It is customary to use more if one can
afford it. The average upkeep for a given SS is roughly SS*10% more than 
the minimum.

Note that SS 0 is not included in this system since SS 0 are slaves and don\'t
pay for their own upkeep (also remember that slavery is forbidden in the
Imperium).


SS       Upkeep
     Minimum  Average
 1     150      175 
 2     200      250
 3     250      325 
 4     300      425 
 5     350      525 
 6     400      650
 7     450      775 
 8     500      900
 9     550     1050 
10     600     1200  

Above SS 10 upkeep is highly individualistic and difficult to generalize
about.

While travelling upkeep is +25% in rural areas, +50% in urban areas and
+100% in artificial environments (space stations, etc.)

Clothes

Clothes are usually accounted for in the basic living expenses, but if a 
character needs to acquire clothes in unusual circumstances (like as part 
of a disguise or to replace a ruined set) here are some prices:

Rags                   20
Rough/well used        40
Common/a little used   60
Good                  200
Fine                  600
Elegant               800
Extravagant          1000

Note: Prices for clothes (especially finery) can easily vary by from -20 to 
+50% depending on how many or how few frills are traditional in the local 
culture.

                       SALARIES  --  Imperial culture
                       ==============================      
                             Monthly pay scales

There are no taxes on Imperial salaries. The average person supports one
dependent (Less for lower ranks, more for higher ranks).

Food and lodging is provided for enlisted personel. Crimp200/month is 
deducted from their pay for this (So an E1 would be paid Crimp100 each 
month). When serving planetside, officers are expected to pay for their food 
and lodging. When serving aboard a ship or in the field, officers get free 
food and lodging and can save a substantial amount of their pay. Officers 
serving on backwater planets can also save quite a lot, since they are paid 
in Crimp but pay their expenses in local currency. Most officers, however, 
blow the money thus saved on gourmet items and useless souvenirs from the 
worlds they visit.

Officers are expected to maintain a living standard no less than that 
appropiate for SS 8. O1s can just manage that with a few credits left over. 
O2s still have to shrimp a bit, but have no real problems. O3s can manage it
comfortably, unless they are married to a spouse who does not have a job of 
his or her own, in which case they can just manage it, but only just. O4s 
and O5s are better able to manage supporting a spouse and for O6s and above 
there are no hardships involved. Accordingly O1s and O2s are almost never 
married, O3s seldom married, O4s and O5s increasingly often married and O6s 
and above are almost expected to be married.

Pensions are 20% of final pay for each term more than four served up to a 
maximum of 100%. Imperial pensions are not subject to local income taxes.

is in charge of all agents in a sector; and the Director-General is in charge 
of all agents Imperium-wide.

** A Special Agent reports directly to the Minister of Justice. A Special 
Investigator holds an Imperial Warrant and reports directly to the Emperor.

In Year 0 there would be no High or Grand Ambassadors and MoJ special agents

                             Starship economics
                             ==================

Life support: Each passenger and crew aboard a starship involves an overhead
cost of Cr300 per person per 10-day period. 2/3rd of this pays for very good 
food; Free Traders may skimp on this, but it will affect crew morale and ship 
reputation. The remaining Cr100 goes to pay for other supplies. Passengers 
usually spend one period (9-10 days) aboard a ship making a jump and thus
only account for 2 periods per month. Passengers who stay on board for the
next jump and any crew naturally account for three full periods per months. 

Regular passenger ships charge double passage for jumps of two parsecs,
triple passage for jumps of three parsecs, etc. Free Traders charge
whatever they can get away with: Less than full charge if there are rival
starships in port, more if they are the only ones present. Putting two
passengers in one stateroom is a popular way of increasing revenue.

By Imperial law any ship carrying passengers is required to accept a Middle 
or High Passage ticket as full payment for a one-parsec jump. Captains of
registered ships can cash such tickets at full value. Since people seldomly
get luxury liner treatment on tramp steamers, most people travelling by
Free Trader negotiate a cash price and save their tickets for the regular 
ships.

Crew salaries: Salaries are paid according to the rank a crew member holds.
Skill levels do not affect salaries except insofar they allow a character
to get a better job. Crew on Free Traders who do not own a share in the
profit usually expect a salary of Crimp 800-1000 with a Captain getting 
ca. 25% more.

                             Planetary economies
                             ===================

The average citizen earns Cr10,000 per year and pays 25% taxes.

How much of this that goes to the (peacetime) naval budget depends on how
vulnerable they feel. Planets with high populations use proportionally less
(though still more in absolute terms) than planets with lower populations.
Planets with strong allies may use less than they would otherwise have done.
Planets near borders may use more.

At population level 8 the naval budget equals Cr500 per citizen. At level
9 this is halved and halved again at level 10. At population level 7 and
below the budget is doubled (but such planets are usually part of a larger 
political unit). Referees who don\'t mind the math should use a logaritmic
scale to determine the budget of planets with population multipliers larger
than one.

A portion of the naval budget of any planet that is part of an interstellar 
state goes to the navy of that state. The portion is equivalent to 30% of
the budget of the planet with the largest population. The remaining part 
can be used on system defenses. Worlds that feel really secure may use less
on system defenses, but not less, proportionally, than their big associate.

Example 1: Big World with 1 billion citizens is associated with Medium World 
with 100 million citizens. The naval budget of Big World is Cr250 per 
citizen, or MCr250,000. 30% of this (Cr75 per citizen) goes to the state
navy and the rest to Big World\'s system defenses. The naval budget of
Medium World is Cr500 per citizen, or MCr 50,000. Of this Cr75 per citizen
goes to the state navy and the rest to Medium World\'s system defenses.
            
Total contribution      State navy  System defenses
Big World                MCr75,000    MCr175,000      
Medium World              MCr7,500     MCr42,500

If Medium World felt really secure it could use as little as MCr17,500 on 
system defenses (The money saved would go to other branches of the
government).


Example 2: A federation of 10 worlds with 100 million citizens each. Each
world has a naval budget of Cr500 per citizen. The budget for the Federation
navy is MCr150,000 and each planet has system defenses for MCr35,000. 

Note that these figures apply to peacetime navies. If Big World lies
adjacent to The Federation and if relationships are strained, then Big
World may well have a larger naval budget.

All the above figures are subject to the government modifiers and the
exchange rates in _Trillion Credit Squadron_.

If navies are still too big to allow those unpatrolled systems dear to
Referees and pirates alike, a MISS factor may be applied. MISS stands
for Military Inefficiency Spending Syndrome and refers to the (possibly
mythical) tendency of military organisations to pay more than private
individuals for anything they buy. Simply multiply the cost of all navy
ships by some factor from 1.1 to whatever you feel is reasonable. Note
that the MISS factor does not have to be the same for different navies.
I haven\'t actually made up any tables for this, but I would say that the
larger the navy, the larger the MISS factor can reasonably be.


                                Merchant navy
                                =============

The merchant navy of a large interstellar economy is equal to Cr10,000 per
citizen, modified up and down in the same way that the naval budget is.
(Ie. Cr5000 per citizen for a pop 9 planet, Cr2500 per citizen for a pop
10 planet, etc.). (Not for the same reason; large economies just doesn\'t
generate proportionally as much trade; that the figure scales the same way
is pure coincidence (And, no, I have no reason to belive that is is actually
the case; the whole bit was originally based on a rule from a Fantasy 
Campaign rulebook!)).

99% of the merchant navy are bulk carriers. Huge cargo ships plying back and
forth between adjacent worlds carrying bulk cargoes that has been contracted
for years in advance. The remaining 1% makes up the so-called speculative
trade: ships that don\'t make the same jump back and forth from the day they
are launched to the day they are scrapped.

Note that every ship we\'ve ever seen described in any Traveller publication 
from 100 T detatched Scouts to 3000 T Tukera freighters is part of this 1%.



Well, that\'s it so far. I hope some of you will find it useful.

Missiles are 7 cubic meters (that\'s a half a displacement ton) each, and
could be carried as cargo (in the cargo hold) or in a special magazine
designated for that purpose.

Currently, the only way to reload turret missiles is by hand; it takes about
an hour for one person to bring one up from storage and wrestle it into
place (missiles mass several metric tons apiece).  The referee may allow
slightly shorter reload time if more than one character is assisting.

OPINION: I also feel that there should be a way to automatically reload
missile turrets, but there are (currently) no official rules for it.  Within
your campaign, you may want to declare that automatic reloaders are available.
As a suggestion, each reloader might cost MCr 0.1 and occupy two displacement
tons, (plus twice the volume of the reload missiles carried).  Only one reloader
is allowed per turret or two per barbette, and each reloader can reload a single
missile per turn.  The turret or barbette may not fire while it is being reloaded.

> Also why only TL8 missiles and turrets? What happened to TL9,10,11 & 12?

The launchers themselves don\'t change much after TL-8 or so; not
enough to have a different turret design (in other words, a TL-12 missile
launcher costs and weighs about the same as a TL-8 one).

The missiles DO very by TL, but the basic space combat system isn\'t detailed
enough to make the differences very aparrent.  If things go as planned, by
the time there is a more-detailed official combat system, there will be more
detailed missiles to go with it.

OPINION: If you have a lot of high-tech worlds in your campaign, you may
want to give missiles at TL-13 or higher one of the following advantages: either
they move two range bands per turn instead of one, OR they do 1 extra point of
damage when they hit.  Missiles at TL-16 or higher would have both
advantages.

Naw, sounds to me like they want to leave some of the background 
detailing to individual referees.  I like the idea.  And how does 
writing a milieu 0 book qualify as not doing any background work.

For that matter, how does having a PC or Mac running in endless 
cycles of random number generating QUALIFY as doing background work.

If this is all the depth that the Don\'t Leave it Blank crowd uses in 
designing worlds/sectors/subsectors, I don\'t want to play in their 
games...

There\'s nothing to it.  There are about a dozen sector generators out 
there for just about every platform around.  Or you can write your 
own, as I did when I owned a Trash 80, C-64, and an Amiga.  Heck, I 
can generate a sector in about 2 minutes.

> I use the UPP to generate adventures, not the other way round

Obviously its a basis for the subsequent design of the world, but I 
don\'t want a book that just spews out tremendous volumes of random 
number generator nonsense.

1 other thought about the camp wanting a book including UWP\'s for 50 sectors.  
All told, there have not been 50 sectors generated for the game at 
this point which have been published.  DGP did 35, but they 
overlapped with what GDW put out.  Imagine the volume in terms of 
number of pages needed to list the UWP\'s and bits of Library data on 
each sector.  Even looking at the way that DGP did it with the 
sectors they included in various issues of TD & MTJ, with a typesize 
that was nearly unreadable, You\'d be looking at a MINIMUM of 5-6 
pages.  Multiply that by 50, and you\'ve got a book of about 300 
pages, which\'d retail for about $40, and sit on store shelves for 
eternity.  Oh, and if you thought the T4 book was late, just wait 
until such a beast didn\'t get out until about Summer of \'97.

You\'re right, it can\'t.  Beyond a certain distance from the star, thrust-plate
efficency drops off drastically.  In such a case, the ship would have to send
a radio (maser) or laser message to a nearby inhabited star system, and have
everyone go into low berths, hoping that the distress message will be
recieved and acted on before the power fails.

I did say, in my comment about surviving a misjump, that the ship needed
functional maneuver drives.  I should have added that thrust-plate
drives aren\'t considered functional that far into deep space.  Oops.

The Thrust-plate maneuver drive has a "step" function - at a certain point,
the effective thrust drops off suddenly.  The point is related to the star\'s
gravity field; in the Earth\'s solar system, this point is somewhere near the
orbit of Pluto.   The exact point is defined by a gravity gradient; as a
rule of thumb (and to avoid complicated calculations), the drop-off point is
halfway between the outermost possible orbit for a given star and the next
closer orbit - if a star has the maximum possible number of planets, the
outermost one is outside the limit, and the rest are inside.

Like all other ranges provided, this is the Short Range.  So...

Short	Medium	Long	Extreme
1000AU	2000AU	4000AU	8000AU
 
The tasks just get harder (signal strength goes down, it\'s harder to
beam the signal at the target since you might not know exactly where
they are at that range, etc.)

I think it might have been a mistake, but besides that, the second
amendment is the last check in a series of checks and balances on
government.  The idea is that if the electorate puts a despot in
power, they control the army (in colonial times, the army was all
able bodied men carrying their own rifles) since the people *are*
the army.

Sorry to go off on a thread that will no doubt go on and on at this

Thanks for your very informative post on converting armor and
penetration from QSDS to T4 personal combat.

But I would like to ask on behalf of the Striker and High Guard
holdouts on the list how to convert these armor values too.

Actually, if you could just tell us how to convert from T4
armor/penetration to the equivalent centimeters of steel plate, we could
do the rest ourselves. I\'d be happy to publish the results here (or
anywhere else).

Thanks in advance.

Here I don\'t agree with you.  The basis for my disagreement is the experience point 
cost.  Look at this:

For an Attribute value of 8:
						You	T4	Me
	Default Skill Level Tareget Number:	4	4	3
		+ 2 Experience points
	Skill Level 1 Target Number:		6	9	6
		+ 1.16 Experience points	
	Skill Level 2 Target Number:		8	10	8
		+ 1.33 Experience Points	
	Skill Level 3 Target Number:		10	11	10
etc...

So for those two experience points to get skill level 1, the player gets very
little value.

Thoughts???

Now that you mention it I did sort of skip this item.  I guess that if

fully loaded automatic rifle (perhaps not without justification, assas-

the First Interstellar Bank.  What\'s the security guard going to do?

And how does this jibe with Law Level?  What if all weapons are banned?
But by Imperial Law one must allow them into one\'s business?????  I
don\'t get it.

Actually, I wasn\'t addressing you in particular Hans. But you raised
some very good points in your reply. I can\'t address them all today, so
I\'ll just cut to the crux (as I see it):

I guess that I\'ve always viewed the Trav universe as a place where
technology is pervasive enough that environmental impact on the
economy will be (or at least can be) minimal. YMMV.

Obviously, here on earth, this is not yet the case; Antarctica has a
very small population, as you point out. And for reasons of future
history it may never be the case. But given the inherent difficulties
of settling any planet, future colonists may not be so picky if they
have enough technology to insure a comfortable life anywhere.

[...]

>are faulty.

Point well taken. But this is a problem without an easy solution
(short of computer generated Monte Carlo calculations of human
migrations through jump space) If you want to minimize faulty
assumptions, you could have quite a bit of work cut out for you.

If you want a simple system involving the rolling of two dice a few
times, I\'d say the one we\'ve got is pretty good. Obviously, it could
be improved a little bit by sacrificing a little simplicity. 

Putting in simple "-1", "+1" type modifiers to the population would not
be acceptable in my view, since they would /completely/ eliminate
certain combinations of population and physical characteristics of the
UWP.

But you could do things this way:

1) Roll up the physical part of the UWP first.

2) Fit your new world into one of three categories: Pleasant, Average,
or Unpleasant.

3) Roll for the population. If the world is pleasant, roll three
dice and throw out the lowest one. Use the remaining two dice (-2)
to work out the population as normal. If the world is unpleasant,
roll three dice and throw out the /highest/ one, then continue as
normal. If two or more dice compete for the highest/lowest value,
then it doesn\'t matter which of them you throw out.

This allows a full diversity of UWP\'s, but weights some more than
others.

You could make this system more complicated by making more categories
("Paradise" or "Hell-hole") and rolling four dice, and so on.

Or you could forget dice and use a complicated Monte Carlo algorithm
to make something really detailed. You\'d have to be a pretty dedicated
hobbyist to go this route.

These are just a few of my random thoughts. You\'ve obviously given this
matter more attention than I have. Any comments?

My store owners definitely don\'t...even after me telling them I\'ve talked

Unless you use a system with real number probabilities or weigh

happen.

As the originator of the Dex 10 + Pilot 1 versus Dex 4 + Pilot 6 
example, I believe you\'re referring to me.  What I objected to, was
NOT the chances being equal.  In fact the Target Numbers (T#) are
different (11 versus 10) in my example.  I just didn\'t believe that
a fast novice (10+1) could outfly a slower experienced pilot (4+6).
I had no problem with some people having the same target number, 
it\'s just WHO would have the same target number that I wanted to 
adjust.

It\'s always good to discuss these things, so let\'s keep talking.

with the rest of the hardbacks) by October 25.

So, if you have not received your signed hardback copy of T4, you can 
probably stop worrying about it being lost in the mail. :)

As always, if you have concerns about your specific order, then please

I will be running my first T4 game next week. I have run both 
Traveller and classic Traveller in the past. We have generated characters
for the party, an so I have some comments on the character generation
system. 

The good parts

I like the way they have made a hybrid of the advanced character 
generation system and the classic traveller system. 

Starting from college and going through to retirement seems very
easy, with less complicated tables. 

The bad parts.

1. I think that the way to generate  a 
homeworld allows players to generate home woworlds that 
may not exist. This is a real hassle when trying to figure out where
a player is from. I am going to build a work-around for this, placing
actual worlds to be born on in its place. 

2. When a player is injured out of or leaves a service he can attempt
to re-enter another one. There is no apparent rules that say if 
a person is injured out of the Army that he can\'t join the Marines. 
I think that there would be a problem since the Marines probably has 
more physical requirements than the Army. Our temporary way 
out of this is to say that injury could also mean getting arrested, 
fired, or in some cases an injury that is relatively minor but 
violates something in the Imperial Bureacracy. 

Anyway, I am thinking of building some kind of injury table, that 
contains bonuses/penalties for different types of injuries when tryihg
to join another service. 

3. The 3D damage rule. I don\'t know why that rule is there. I think
I am going to ignore it just so combat remains a deadly thing to be
avoided. 

4. My players were more concerned than I that the PGMP, FGMP and other
neat weapons are missing from the game. Will they come back?

Oop. I forgot to mention the other possibility - some of the distributors 
had some faith in traveller, so they ordered it; they just didn\'t have 
enough faith, and under-ordered.  IIRC, The Armory is guilty of this.
So, the other possibility would be that the distributor is carrying it, 
the FLGS wants it, but the distributor is simply out of stock.

Which means that there *is* no "canon". It\'s simply at the designer\'s 
whim (which is what I said). So, for example, if Marc says that "Virus 
never happened, it was all a nightmare (shades of *Dallas* ;-) being had 
by Strephon", then Virus ceases to be canon. Or if a "licensed 
*official* Traveller product" states that Grandfather was all a myth 
emplaced by the Hivers as part of a psychohistory manipulation for 
unknowable (to us poor sucker humans) purposes, well, then *that* is 
"canon". Or if Marc decides that the ultimate weapon in Traveller is the 
ubiquitious large asteroid at .01c ;-), then *that* is canon? >>

In theory, yes. In practice, anyone who tried to change canon in a major 
way would get stomped on from a great height by us!

Bruce,

This issue with sensors has been IHMO wrong. To arrive at FCS(Fire Control
Solution) you only need three things -Bearing, Angle Theta, And Range
Rate(Rate in which target is/is not closing to the firer). You do not need
to resolve?(not a FC term) to hit a target. 

With Passive EMS it seems to me that everyone is fixated on the IR spectrum.
A Passive EMS sensor will weight in heavily other emissions that a target
might have such a 1 Gigahertz emission when the HELPAR/Thruster Plate drive
is used, the change in frequency when the drive changes speed. A Passive EMS
sensor could also pick the toilet being flushed so too speak, or even your
communications gear in standby mode. We might look at vehicles as to what
emmissions it might have.

A vehicle (Space or not) emitates vast amounts of Emmissions across many
spectrums. If you say that such emmissions are to faint, by todays tech your
WRONG. Today police can tell if you have a radar detector in vehicle just
simple piece of electronics. Do you now how much emmissions your radar
detector puts out lets say it in the milliwatt range, the police can detect
them at over a mile. Today from some satellites, very faint emmissions
(picowatt range), can be detected from orbit to within half a meter. EMM
will reduce but not eliminate a vehicles emmissions. The only way to stop
the emmissions is to turn off the source.

AS for missile a Semi Active homer homes in on the reflected emmissions off
the target. The source of the reflected emmissions could the firing ship or
another. As for how the missile deciding when to detonate, today a lot of
missiles use "Doppler Rolloff" to detect when to go boom. What is "Doppler
Rolloff", well we are all familiar with it, say a ambulance is approaching
you, you hear the siren, after it goes past you, the siren seems to have
changed sound that it makes. 

Also passive sensors always will have greater range than active. But passive
require a greater tracking time to arrive at FCS.

IMHO the only way to use missiles in combat is to use all the different
types ie KKM, Nuke Det Laser, Nuke Contact, and Explosive Contact. If you do
not I design a point defense system that will stop it cold. 

As to the debate on limiting Thruster plate drive it to certain size, it
will not work, people on this list have already given very good examples. If
you feel that thruster plate missiles will be over powering, there is an
elegant solution, use a Grav Sensor. A high acceleration thruster plate will
distort the local gravity scene in proportion to the amount of G\'s that the
missile is accelerating. The greater the distortion the greater range it can
be detected.

Certain EW gear that we have today can track, classify, and evaluate a
target in less time than you would believe. All from extremely small
emmissions that a target gives off.

How about a non-linear transform:

  For any skill level there is a maximum target number;

  Skill Level     Max TN = 2*Skill+7  <- open to debate
          1          9
          2         10
          3         13
          4         15
          5         17

  Side-effect:
    + No multiplication, division, rounding.
    + Only effects characters with high attributes (9+).
    + High attributes have a limited effect on low Skills,
      but when their skill improves, it improves twice as
      fast as a below average attributes until your skill
      catches up with your natural ability. Sort a like
      real life.
    + Minor addition to existing rules.
    + Works with the proposed 1.5/2/2.5/4/5 dice change.
    + Easy to ignore for heroic (hero worshiping) campaigns.
    - It adds a table/equation that needs to be consulted,
      some of the time, i.e. may forget to do.

  Of course, Target modifiers ignore these limits.

This brings up an Official Question (tm) for Joe:
        Is there an upper limit on how many times a character can be drafted?
Consider the folowing example:
        Johnny Blow (I would have said Joe, but I didn\'t want to tick off
the Answer Man) joins the Scouts. He gets bounced after one term. Before he
joined the Scouts, he tried to get into the Navy and they said a
not-so-polite "No thank you". Johnny now decides to submit to the draft. He
gets drafted by the Navy. They boot him out after one term. He submits to
the draft AGAIN as a way of avoiding the now -3 modifier of getting into
another service. He winds up in the Scouts again. He steps on a piece of
sharp shale and gets discharged from the Scouts after two years. he submits
to the draft YET AGAIN and gets drafted by the Scouts...
        Don\'t laugh. There\'s a character very much like this in my T4 game.
As far as I can tell from the rulebook, the above scenario is TOTALLY LEGAL!
Is this correct?
>3. The 3D damage rule. I don\'t know why that rule is there. I think
>I am going to ignore it just so combat remains a deadly thing to be
>avoided. 

Combat should be deadly, but not automatically lethal! The reason for the 3D
limit is that some of the energy from large caliber attacks will go through
a target. There is simply a limit to a shot that doesn\'t hit a vital organ
will do. There are options in the rules for double damage shots and triple
damage shots. The more practical reason is the way T4 handles "hit points".
The damage comes off of your first three stats. An average stat is 7. On the
first hit, the damage rolled is totalled and applied to one characteristic,
with the remainder being distributed to the other two. The average damage on
3D is 10, so on average, the character will lose all of one stat (rendering
him unconcscious) and 3 points from another. 
Now, if you do what you are proposing, a target wearing Diplo Armor who gets
shot by a laser rifle will take (7-3) 4 dice of damage or an average of 14
points, which will scrag two stats, rendering the character seriously
wounded. And if said target isn\'t wearing ANY armor, that\'s 7 dice, or 24-25
points on the average, sufficient to KILL a character with all three
physical stats at 8 ON THE FIRST SHOT. I would reccomend against this; if
your characters want to do more damage, have them make
double or triple damage rolls.

>4. My players were more concerned than I that the PGMP, FGMP and other
>neat weapons are missing from the game. Will they come back? 
       Yes, Plasma Rifles will be back, probably in the Central Supply
Catalog. Fusion guns may wait a little longer. By the way, based on
conversations with Greg Porter and my own fevered imagination, here\'s my
idea of a Plasma Rifle that could be used in the meantime:

Weapon         TL      Damage  Range   Shots   Mass    Reloads   Cost
Plasma Rifle   12        23    Long     100     19 kg   11 kg    20,000
        This weapon has a max damage of 6D. It does half damage (12) to any
target within 1.5m of the primary target due to splatter. There IS an
autofire version of this weapon available...
        Nasty enough for ya?

>How compatible is the new game to MegaTraveller? 

You should be able to use any MT adventure with a minimum of conversion.
Characters require a bit more thought. On the average, T4 characters will
have more skills than their MT counterparts. Assuming a character who serves
four terms in both games, gets commissioned in the first term, promoted in
all terms, and gets Special Duty in MT half of his terms, it looks like this:

FIRST TERM SKILL LEVELS         T4              MT
                                6               5
SUBSEQUENT TERMS                15              9
TOTALS                          21              14
        This assumes that all of the above are skill levels and not stat
increases.
Here\'w what I did to convert a friend\'s MT character to T4. I will then give
you both characters so you can see the differences.

1.) All stats remain the same. It is assumed that these already represent
all stat increases due to profession and all decreases due to aging.

2.) Figure out the career path of the MT character including all promotions.
commissions, etc. Ignore special duty rolls (T4 doesn\'t have them.)

3.)Give the character the same career path in T4. As the character gets
skill levels, give it the skills and levels it already has until it runs out
of levels, then roll additional skills to finish it out. Don\'t forget the
homeworld skills and background skills.
        EXAMPLE: In the first two terms, I gave Maria the skills she had on
her MT sheet. She had 5 levels coming to her in her third term; I had only
two levels left to duplicate her original skill list. I gave her the two
levels, then began rolling to use up the three that were left. Her fourth
and fifth terms she got all new skills, rolled randomly.

4.) be advised that some MT skills do not exist yet in T4, and others get
combined. There is no Combat Rifleman score; what I did was add that to her
Rifle skill level.
For skills that don\'t exist yet, either redistribute those levels, or give
the character the skill anyway, assuming that it will exist someday.

The same basic procedure could be used to convert CT characters.

Oh, one more thing; Maria\'s enlisted ranks are much higher in T4 than in MT
because I used the T4 rule on automatic promotion for time in service for
enlisted characters (page 21). This will probably hold true for most
characters developed under the Advanced systems in CT or T4.

Everyone listen to this wise man.  I would fully support such a system that included 
UPPs on all worlds but left a small percentage of worlds in each sector as "Ref Only" 
worlds.

That would make me completely happy.  I\'d have my complete, official data, and others 
could safely change certain systems to his liking without worrying about supplements 
blowing his creations later.

As a matter of fact, I think that I have already put forth this idea in my post to Joe 
Walsh...

Anyway,

Support the ban on blank areas!

This is an even worse idea.  I\'d much rather have a few blank systems (shudder at the 
thought, though) in an otherwise complete sector than have entire subsectors or even 
sectors without any official information.

C\'mon, IG.  If you want to write us a game, then WRITE the game.  Why do you think that 
most Traveller fans really loved the DGP stuff?  It\'s because it was so rich with 
detail.  That\'s what we want!  Rich detail, get it?

First let me say that I\'m not comfortable with the way experience is being handled in 
T4.  Traveller has always had a weak experience system, but I guess MT did the best job 
at it.  At least you could reward your players at the end of every game sesssion, even 
if it was only one AT.  

My players and I look forward to the end of the night when we can review the game and 
pat each other on the back.  Maybe this is a hold over from our D&D days when you could 
give this huge bunch of xps to a character for good ideas, great role-play, and deeds 
accomplished in the nights gaming.  It was a time of relection and session appreciation, 
and all of those xps did not make your character go up a level every night.

On my list of next Traveller projects, after I\'m comfortable with a task system, that 
is, I\'m going to investigate alternate methods of rewarding the players without them 
being able to gain a skill every night.

Like I said, MT was the best at this, but recieveing only one AT was a bit 
anti-climactic.  I think there should be some sort of a reward system for each night of 
play--to be able to reward for good ideas, wonder role-play, and that time when all odds 
were against a character but he made the roll anyway.  This shouldn\'t be unbalanced--I 
think a character should average 1 to 2 skill levels per game year, depending on 
adventuring intensity, just like it is in character generation (I view character 
generation as an abbriviated form of adventuring--and Traveller has the funnest 
character generation system I have ever seen).

But now that you know my views on xps, let\'s look at your post.

Ya know, Doug, our systems look to produce the same results except from between default 
and skill level 1.  In fact, my system is equal-distant each step.  The numbers you 
posted for my system all increase by two.  I think this is logical.  For each skill 
increase, your target number increases by two.

On the other hand, your system has a three point jump between default skill and skill 
level 1, then we see two point jumps thereafter.  If I had to pick based on this 
information, I\'d say my system makes more sense.

But, I gotta tell ya, if my system produced the numbers yours did, I wouln\'t be that 
broken up about it.  Your system says that it is harder to become better at a skill 
level if you know nothing about it (default to level 1) than it is to become better if 
you have knowledge about it (skill level n to skill level n).  I don\'t have a problem 
with that thought either.

I think the ease of the total systems, for me, outweighs any of this topic, though.  I\'d 
be happy with either system, but I like mine better because it is a natural fix to T4.  
My system is easy, uncomplicated, and has minimal steps from published T4 stuff.  That\'s 
what I was shooting for, and that\'s what I got.  

So, therefore, I still like my system better.

How do you feel about that?

Kenneth.

I disagree with Amused.  I really, really like T4.  It is just like CT, but uses a task 
system.  Character generation produces characters that hold their own with the long 
method presented in Books 4-7 (and the 1 year method in MT for Scouts, Merchants, etc.).

I think the idea behind the T4 task system is a great improvement over MT, and MT was my 
system of choice up until now, but T4 had some problems.  I think I\'ve come up with an 
easy fix that makes the T4 system superior to MT.

Most other items, except starship combat, are exactly or real close to CT.

In my opinion, T4 makes Traveller feel like Traveller again.  I for one, an excited 
about its entry into the market place, and I encourage you to rush out an buy it.

I don\'t like limiting the high numbers in this method because you are providing no 
benefit for having a really high attribute or a really high skill level.  What good is 
having a 14 Dex if you get the same benefit as a person with a 10 Dex.  This was the 
problem with the MT system.  I think T4 takes care of this problem nicely, and there is 
a benefit associated with all levels of skill and attribute.  It makes the different 
stats more important in the game.  

I, for one, like the full-use, full-benefit idea put forth in T4.

>   Side-effect:
>     + No multiplication, division, rounding.

With my system, if you can precalculate the target number and record it on the character 
sheet.  It\'s not like we are talking astro-physics (pardon the pun) anyway.  If you can 
mulitply by two, divide by two, and write a result on a character page, the is all the 
work you will have to do. 

Besides, with the system you put forth above, the same amount of math is still involved.

>     + Only effects characters with high attributes (9+).

My system gives benefit to all levels of skill and attributes.  If you use the 
difficulty fix I posited, then you won\'t have a success chance problem with high 
numbers.

My system does this as well.  An attribute can only help you to as far as half the stat. 
 At that point, it\'s up to your expertise in the skill to improve your chances of 
success.

You can\'t get much more minor than the system that I am backing.

True, but by just changing staggering and impossible to 4 and 5 dice, this is not a 
problem.  And with my system you won\'t be limiting the benefit of Dex 14 over Dex 10 as 
I stated above.

>     + Easy to ignore for heroic (hero worshiping) campaigns.

Heck, if you want this, then just use the T4 system as is without any change.  Why 
bother making a change in the first place?

There is no table with my system.  All players need to do is look at their character 
sheets.  Let\'s say a character has a target number of 9 with his pistol.  After just a 
couple of task throws, the player knows that he needs a 9 or less to hit with his 
pistol.  That\'s it--no matter the difficulty.  9 or less.  You can\'t get easier than 
that.

Kenneth,

Yikes!  According to the map of Known Space, there are 128 sectors in the 
spiral arm under consideration in the Traveller game.  So, you want IG to 
create UWP data and maps for all 128 sectors??  Yikes!
Did any previous version of Traveller have all that info? (Just curious.)

Now, this isn\'t saying it would be difficult.  They could do it with a 
program, and have all that data generated in a matter of minutes.  I\'m 
just kinda awed that customers desire that much data.  Wow.

No, you\'re missing my point.

I want to integrate my custom worlds/clusters into the official universe,
without having to rewrite \'official\' history.  If I am changing official
material, I must forever after scan everything published and pencil in
changes.  (This is one reason I converted the Imperial Encyclopedia to
electronic format: made it easier to keep it updated.)

I want some sectors of space fully developed (like the Spinward Marches). 
They have a long history, after all.

However, I also want areas where I can site a small cluster of worlds without
disturbing the official history.  Obviously, these worlds _cannot_ be
important!  Their existence (or lack of existence) can\'t change official
history.  (I\'ll admit this limits what I can do with them. But having spent
much of my life in quiet, out-of-the-way places, I feel comfortable setting
adventures in places that never make the news.) They should be situated so
that in your example, you could tell your player: "there is no world there". 

I\'ll admit that a UWP/name with a statement/promise that these worlds will
not be developed further by IG or any Traveller licensee would also work,
because in this case all I\'d have to change would be name/UWP.

Crystal power is the result of voltage being produced from a crystal in
response to pressure being exerted on it.  Normal pressure is 12psi I
believe (anyone have actual figures).  Inside oxygen tanks the breathable
atmosphere has been compressed to extreme pressures.  So in the tank all the
gas is pressing outwards.  What if you lined an gastank (probably best with
an inert gas like argon or something) with the synthetic crystals.  Now to
prevent the use of this tech idea from unbalancing game play we could say
that the crystals produce only limited amounts of power.  Say, something
like less than .5 MWh.  

The chem las Pistols ran at .01 MJ per pulse 
The Laser rifles ran at somethinging like .05 MJ per pulse 

****Note using this ideas would go hand in hand with Plasma or Fusion guns.

Then have leads running from the tank to a homopole generator or charge
slots.  For the laser pistol we could have detachable power clips that plug
into the belt worn.  Thus they could charge when not in use.  For rifles
their could be cables attached direclety to the generator.  I should think
that static electricity could begin to be a major problem around this
contraption.  So to avoid a hair raising experience perhaps a bodysuit
should be worn.  Something like those bodygloves for surfers.  That way
there is good insulation and a ground.

Well, I\'m not talking about 128 sectors.  I\'m talking about the 26 or so sectors that 
comprise Imperial space and the sectors that comprise surrounding space of the Hive 
Federation, Aslan Hierate, etc.  

As I said, this does not have to be done all at once.  I think the domain idea is a good 
one.  Once or twice a year, IG publishes a supplement for each domain containing four 
sectors--with UWPs, background data, some detailed worlds, etc.  GMs could only buy the 
supplement for the area they were interested in.  People like me, of course, would buy 
all of them.

What I\'m picturing is a book like TNE\'s Regency Sourcebook.  Maybe some of the info 
would be handled differently, but that\'s the general idea.  

Have you ever seen the great TSR supplements for the Forgotten Realms?  No matter where 
you go, they\'ve got a great supplement that details specific areas.  They didn\'t produce 
this over night, but over the last 10 years, or so, the information has become pretty 
complete.  And, I never feel stifled with these products.  Instead, I feel supported.

So what\'s wrong with having official UWPs for all worlds but lableing certain worlds as 
Ref-Only anyway?  It really seems to me that this will solve all the problems and both 
sides of the argument.

As far as I\'m concered, the more data the better.  I\'m one of those who wants to own 
everything connected with a game I\'m passionate about.  I own 99% of all Traveller 
things published by GDW.  Maybe some would say, "Wow", but the more stuff out there, the 
more I like the game--and the more it grows.

Put in my vote for completeness.

> Remind me not to get into a political contest with you, eh? :)

People have told me that I am very opinionated.  Some have said that it is a deficite.  
I consider it a benefit.  But, I always strive to keep an open mind.  I will get dead 
set on something, but that doesn\'t mean I won\'t listen to people with opposing views.

Let me cite Glenn Hoppe\'s marvelous explanation of why jump takes about a week no matter 
what for an example.  I have never bought that idea in the 14 years that I have been 
playing Traveller.  It was never supported very well in anything that I have read 
concerning the game.  I wanted to support it because it was official, but it just didn\'t 
seem right.  That\'s why I through that idea out on the TML--to see how others handled 
it.  Glenn\'s suggestion was right on.  It fell into canon as well.  I liked it, and last 
Sunday, after a year of playing my campaign my way, I changed to Glenn\'s suggestion.  
Now, we have one week in jump no matter what.

So, please don\'t get the idea that I am single minded.  I\'m strong minded, and there is 
a difference.  I think about my side of things, and I support those thoughts with what I 
write here.  If someone has a better idea than mine, well, I\'m man enough to admit that. 
 And I do come across strong on the TML because I usually concentrate on those subjects 
that I have a strong opinion about or am interested in.  I don\'t waste a lot of my time 
on subjects that I for which I have no opinion, am not interested in, or feel that I 
cannot add constructively to the conversation.

So why am I saying all of this?  It\'s because I always read a post with your name beside 
it, and I respect your opinions.  We don\'t always agree (but we are in agreement more 
than not), but you handle your posts with thought and dignity.  Basically, I don\'t want 
you to think that I am a hard head, so I hope you don\'t.

What, you don\'t have one yet?  

Kenneth.

PS, I think I\'ve got this task fix thing worked out.  How about we send in the idea to 
IG.  I\'d like to see it as an optional rule in a future supplement.  Do you think 
there\'s a chance?

Doh!

I took a second look at the target numbers generated by your system.
Skill-4+ target numbers always beat zero skill with high stats.
(Thump. Hey, what\'s that? Oh, it\'s a forest! ;-)

Glad to be of service!


> David, did I clear up this thing any?

Yes. Quite a bit. Your system works better than the one presented in 
T4 with respect to the value of a skill and the chance of success for 
"impossible" and near impossible tasks.

I have some other comments & observations, but they\'re going to have
to wait for another post.

Possibly. Take a second look at my earlier post detailing a
different variant than Kenneth\'s and let me know if you\'re sure
about that. ;-)

Hi,

I agree that the home world generation system has problems - I\'d rather 
they had referred readers to the world generation section at that point.
But, that doesn\'t solve the problem you bring up. :)

My solution to is to keep in mind that all such randomization systems 
are simply an aid to imagination.  If you want to use make up a specific 
planet, assign a PC a specific planet as homeworld, or whatever, that is 
an equally valid approach (and, as you point out, is preferable in many 
circumstances). 

You\'re the referee; do what makes sense for you, above all else! :)

Sounds like a good, playable alternative.  Would you mind posting it all

Again, a good option if that\'s the feel you\'re looking for.  Personally, 
I\'m doing the same thing.

You betcha. :)  Or we\'d be picketing IG\'s headquarters. :)

In the mean-time, there\'s no reason you can\'t just convert P/FGMP weapon 
stats from previous editions...

So, are we in agreement with this, then?  Would you support this if this was IG\'s new 
policy?

If the answers to these two questions are yes, then we are in total agreement.  I would 
be completely happy with that set up.

How do you feel about this compromise?

Gee, Kenneth, I\'m really not supposed to be involved in the business end 
of things.  If you want to get your stuff published, the best way to

        It\'s not the pressure, it\'s the *flexing* -- changing mechanical
stress. So your crystal-lined tank would produce power while you\'re filling
it (the pressure differential on the crystals, and hence the compression
stress) is increasing. But once it\'s full and the pressure isn\'t changing,
no juice.

        And I guarantee fundamental thermodynamics will prevent you from
getting out more power through the piezo than you provide in compressing the
gas in the first place.

Back to basketball... Shaquille O\'Neal, the former center for the Orlando
Magic (now a Laker) is 7\'2", weighs over 300lbs, and is *fast*  Call him STR
13 and DEX 13.  He is also one of the worst shots in professional b-ball,
and his foul percentage (a free shot at the basket with no interference) is
pathetic.  He has a very low score for a pro, maybe Basketball: 2.  Michael
Jordan is strong (STR 9), fast (DEX 10) and an amazingly good player (BB:
6).  Now you can see the differences.. Let Jordan use his skill with INT (to
read the defence, or to fake out an opponent) and you\'ll see why one guy is
staring in a movie with Bugs Bunny wearing FOUR World Championship rings,
while the other is making bad rap records.

BTW:  Shouldn\'t there be a cascade skill under Unarmed Combat for Ice
Hockey?  (Go Sharks!!!)

Exactly, and Sylea is not a wild world, so it\'s not gonna let you carry a
gun into a government office, with that you could cause a lot of trouble.

Also, I\'d like to reiterate someone else\'s point that there are a lot of
nations in the world that you do not have the write to bear arms, Canada and
Great Britain come to mind.

Actually in Canada, you have only the rights that the government is willing to parcel out 
that week. Such as it being illegal tp protest within 100 m of parliament itself during 
sitting hours because it disturbs the MPs. Law Level in Traveller has never been used by 
me as a way to keep weapons out of the hands of players, it is a justification why they 
are going to be annoyed when they try anything. This keeps them on the frontiers where 
I do not have to make up grand Royal Court scenarios (just kidding)
Actually law level is a measure of the intrusiveness of a government into people\'s lives, 
not just a can/cannot shopping list for weapons

Ken, you\'re being unreasonable.  IG is NOT going to detail every system
that exists in the entire galaxy.  And no, they aren\'t and shouldn\'t,
*canonize* the details as put forth by GDW in their various supplement.

Here\'s my version of your little scenerio...

>	GM:  "OK, guys, where do you want to go now?"

>	Players:  "Gee, let\'s jump to this hex."  (pointing to a blank system)

GM:  "Ok, just a sec while I pull out some notes..."  (I grab one of my
pregenerated systems..could be from an old GDW or 3rd party pub, could be
one I created myself for this or some other game.  Could be somthing I make
up on the start.)

GM:  "Main Sequence G5 star with 8 planets.  The main planet is number 2,
it\'s got a C87562-7 UWP.  Uh, and there\'s an Amber code, a plague.

>	Players:  "A plague?  Cool.  Sounds like there might be work for group
>   such as ourselves.  We prey on others misfortune, and they pay us
>   a fortune for it.

>	Yeah, we\'re all in agreement.  Let\'s head for that system."

GM:  "Ok, you\'ve got clearance from the terminal.  You can lift when you\'re
ready."  (I smile my special evil smile, because I intend to \'frag em\' this
time.  There\'s the time to the jump point, the jump and the week in jump
space for us to play.  I can keep them busy the rest of the night if I want
to. Hee! Hee!)

You could, probably *would*, do the same thing if you had the
UWP...right?  So why don\'t you have the UWP?  I\'ve got a thousand systems
already detailed in old GDW stuff.  I\'ve got dozens more that I\'ve done
myself over the years.  I\'ve got computer programs that I can use to make
as many as I want.  And I made this one up on the spot to fit the
situation.

They *aren\'t* going to publish it all, that\'s the point.  They don\'t want
to, and I don\'t want them to! <g>

No!  No!  No!  It\'s the reinventing of the wheel that\'s the fun of it!  <g>
If they are just going to rehash all the old stuff in new books, why buy
the new books? 

IG should detail whatever they want to detail...no more, no less. I\'ll
provide details for whatever else I need, and change their details
too...probably. <g>


There are no rules, only suggestions, and grist for the mill!

Tell you what Ken, I\'m sure somebody out here will be happy to create UWP\'s
for a couple dozen sectors and sell them to you.  They can sell it as an
"official universe" for those who wish to play there.

Go, Boy!

I don\'t object to a "core" of detailed systems with officially detailed
systems and historical events.  What I object to is that core being too
big.  I want an open universe where my players and I can spread out.

So what would CABER+4 imply?  It would mean that Count Caber was a
professional Caber tosser?  A tosser of several years experience? Someone
that could make a perfect toss in cross-winds, in the middle of a rain
storm, while dead druck!  <g> 

On an *Easy* or *Average* toss Mr Mor Muscle should match up with Count
Caber...and he does!  But the Count should still have the advantage on the
more difficult tosses.

Nah!  The inalienable rights include..but aren\'t limited to..Life, Liberty
and the *pursuit* of happiness.  Bearing arms is meant to help us maintain
our liberty from a potentially oppressive
government.  Although, bearing arms has shortened many, too many, lives,
arms have also protected many others.  Finally, It was an Englishman, I
believe, that assured us that "Happiness is a warm gun."  <g>

I rather think that anybody with Skill+4 *should* have higher target

OK then, what about REAL skill-level limits.
I.e. a character with Dex 10 can reach a higher absolute skill level as 
Pilot, than a character with Dex 4.
I haven\'t seen the new rules yet, so maybe I just suggested, what is 
already realized.

    'body' => '     Since my absence actually raised a comment (I was actually considering
typing a "goodbye" message to the list but figured "as big and busy as this
thing is, who\'s gonna notice me vanishing for a few days?"  It\'s nice to
be noticed) I\'ll let you all know that I\'ve spent the past few days on
vacation from school in my home-town of Evansville, Indiana.  While there,
I took the opportunity to introduce my gaming pals to T4 (probably more on
that later) and to gather up some of the old reference materials that I\'d
been wishing I had with me earlier (Supp 8 & 11, Starship Operator\'s, V&V and
S&A).  While I was gone I switched over to digest format (which is terribly
inconvenient for reading only select messages) and have spent the past couple
of hours skimming through what I missed (although near the end it became 
much looser skimming, so don\'t hold it against me if my comments below seem
a day or two out-of-date).  Something that I noticed when changing my subs 
around is that the "welcome" message is out of date (claiming that TNE is
the ruleset currently being discussed and that T4 is due out "late in 1996") 
and whoever is in charge of such things should probably update it.

     The most interesting development to my mind while I was gone (except for
being mentioned in the "where are they now" list) was Kenneth Bearden\'s
proposed target-number determination fix, because I thought up the exact same
fix independently a couple of weeks ago.  I may have even mentioned it
obliquely in a post here or there.  Needless to say, since it\'s the same one
I came up with, I\'m all in favor of it.
     About the shifting dificulties, what can I say-- after all the build up 
we were given the actual "fix" seemed pretty simple, almost Obvious.  Once
again, there should be no real objections here, and in future games, this is
the progression I\'ll almost certainly use.  
     
     And now for a little interlude about my T4 game this week-end (or at 
least that\'s what it claimed to be).  Perhaps it\'s because they\'ve been
polluted by all the Cyberpunk games we played in high-school, but all 4
of the players I had created completely Unsuitable PCs.  The first guy made 
a drunken Charles Bukowski type (after failing to get into college and the
military academy, being rejected as a Rogue (roll=12), and serving a very
undistinguished term in the Scouts, he became an "Entertainer" (which is to
say a vagabond poet) and received as a Mustering benefit a Weapon (which we
interpreted as somebody giving him a gun with one bullet and saying "You know
what the right thing is, now do it").  The second player (the token female in
our group) created a character (technically a Rogue) who was a prostitute
living with the poet and hustling for drug money on the side.  The third
player created a Dirty Cop (Agent, later Rogue) who had recently given up
his life of crime after becoming obsessed on the poetry of P1, and had 
decided to dedicate his life to finding him.  P4 created a character who was
a very straight-laced Cop, responsible for P3 being kicked off the force,
whose position had recently been "downsized" which he refused to accept,
pretending he\'s still a cop and hanging around the station all the time.  I
suppose they deserve points for being creative, and technically everything
they did was within the scope of the T4 char-gen sequence (which proves the
scope, versatility, and all-around awesome beauty of that system), but it 
didn\'t really leave me with a whole lot of room for running any "traditional"
Traveller adventures (such as, as I had previously considered, "The Chamax
Plague" (from CT Double Adventure 5)).
     What we ended up with was a chase around the "city map" that came with
TSR\'s old "Star Frontiers" game (a truly wretched game which, unfortunately,
probably sold pretty well in the early 80s-- hell, I bought it).  I didn\'t
want to bother with T4\'s combat system, so I used "Azhanti High Lightning"
(I\'ve always loved that game\'s rule for killing off bystanders and exploding
machinery, as well as the fact that it only requires 1 page of tables and
no bookkeeping), but I did use T4\'s task system (kinda-- rather than stating
difficulty levels, I\'d just say "gimme a nD roll there" as seemed appropriate, 
though the difficulty spreads probably came pretty close to Kenneth\'s fix).
After the three crooks were able to escape from the law (and PC4) in a stolen
grav-car, I had them be met at the space port by a representative agent of
the newly-formed Third Imperium who told them "I think our government has a 
perfect job for a group of people like you" (with the implied "and I can
think of just the person to be your supervisor"), but I shudder to think of
what would happen if this group of misfits came anywhere near a "real"
adventure.
     Anyway, everyone had a good time, they were familiarized with the basic
ins-and-outs of the new system, and when we get together in the future to 
play, T4 might end up being a regular alternative to our long-running
RuneQuest campaign (if I can talk them into generating some decent characters,
that is!)

     Now that I\'ve got the fun stuf out of the way, I want to throw in my 
opinion on the matter of "to define worlds or not to define them."  First, I
will limit the scope of my opinion in such a way as to make my answer 
possibly pointless: I\'m only referring to Milieu 0, as it will be presented
in the First Survey book, I\'m not thinking about any future Milieux that IG
may produce.  From that basis, I think it would be a waste of time and, in
fact, pretty stupid for IG to give us a bunch of UWPs for worlds which may
be dozens of parsecs away from "civilization".  The vast majority of these
worlds haven\'t been Formally contacted in hundreds of years or more, and any
"public" UWP listing is obviously going to be far out of date.  The theme of
Milieu 0 is re-exploration, re-contact, and re-expansion, and having accurate 
UWP listings would cripple the spirit (why do a survey when we can just look
it up while the GM\'s out of the room).  Marc Miller\'s already stated that the
important areas (Vland area, Sol area, etc) will be detailed, so as to lend
some consistency to the Traveller universe, and that the maps will not just
be asterisks (like the Foreven sector in "Imperiallines") but will have the
"easily verifiable facts" (whether it\'s a world or an asteroid belt, whether
or not there\'s water, gas giants) on them.  All that you\'ll really be missing
then is just the size and atmosphere type of random worlds in Dagudashaag 
sector (since all pop-related stuff will have changed)-- is having those
two numbers for every one of 1100+ worlds really THAT important?  If you\'re
THAT crunched for time (or un-creative) then DON\'T HAVE YOUR PCs GO TO THE
UNEXPLORED AREAS-- run a political or trade-based campaign rather than
an exploration/scouts based one and you\'ll never have to worry about those
unexplored worlds a sector or two away (or, in some cases, a few parsecs 
away, but even then you\'re not going to go to those worlds unless you\'ve
got a reason to, and that will give the GM the time to fill in the blanks.
Are there really that many Traveller GMs out there whose campaigns are
so free-wheeling and unstructured that the GM can\'t predict within a few 
parsecs where the PCs are likely to go next?  Admittedly I haven\'t run all
that many Traveller games, but in those I have run, within a single session
it seems that the action is almost always limited to just one or two worlds,
and that these are usually pretty close together from session to session 
(travel isn\'t that fast!)
     Now for the matter (which is what I presume all the flame has been about)
of what to do with worlds in a supposedly settled and explored Milieu, I
lean the other way, for the same reasons.  In the 1100s, all of the Imperium
has been pretty much settled for close to 1000 years, some parts much
longer, and in general there shouldn\'t be too many surprises out there (at
least within the Imperial border).  The data of the Imperial Second Survey
is presumably included in the Library package of every ship\'s computer and,
therefore, should also be available to every player.  Of course, actually
providing unique UWPs for 1100+ worlds is still a mighty chore, but that\'s
why you start with "Atlas of the Imperium" (which I don\'t own, sadly enough,
so I\'m going by reputation alone) which provides "detailed maps" for each
sector without full UWP listings, detail a few sectors fully (Spinward
Marches, Solomani Rim) and worry about the others as they become important
(again, if you\'re running a campaign in the Marches, how likely is it that
your players are going to run off to Illelish UNEXPECTEDLY?)
     In general, Late Imperial space should be a pretty much known quantity
with some room for referee customization (even after more than 15 years in
print, how many worlds in the Marches do we still know nothing about save
a name and UWP code?) but with a solid basis in common knowledge and fact (that
is, officially published maps and UWPs).  However, outside of the Imperial
border things aren\'t certain, you can\'t be how accurate you computer
databse is, and we go back to the same situation as in Milieu 0 (that is,
exploring the (relatively) unknown).  Sure, if the GM wants to play it
safe he can have his PCs "explore" a published sector (like Far Frontiers or
The Beyond), but such things are rightly "non-canonical" since they belong
to the realm of the Unknown, beyond the safe Imperial sphere.
      Summing all of that up as succinctly as possible, I\'m of the opinion
that in cases where the data would be reasonably assumed to be common 
knowledge to characters within the milieu, then it should be officially
published (and, therefore, consistent across campaigns), but in cases (like
most of Known Space in Milieu 0, or beyond the Imperial borders in "Milieu
1105") where the data would not be known, at least with any reliability or
certainty, by characters within the milieu, then it should either not be
published at all, or at least done so in a modular or "unofficial" manner 
(so that the GM can take or leave whatever he wants).
     Now, in those last few digests that I very lightly skimmed, did someone
else come along and say the exact same thing?  If so, I apologize for wasting
everybody\'s time and bandwidth.

Glad to be back a-Travellin\'

Well, heck, it took me long enough to iron this thing out.  I\'ve been working on it for

I\'m looking forward to them.  I\'m pretty convinced that this is the system that I\'m 
going to use and send into IG as a possible optional rule.  In fact, I\'ve already 
started using it in my game.  If you see other problems with it, I\'d sure like to know

Hey, don\'t worry about that.  I can\'t remember who said what either.  People take

any discussions about that being true or not can be directed at me

I see NO reason whatsoever why the Imperium should meddle in laws regarding

also clashes with the law level rules and I think that this is just another

Why do I sound so pissed off? Well nothing in T4 has yet been of any

buy anything more from IG unless Greg\'s involved in its production. For
those who haven\'t got any Traveller material T4 might be nice and well
worth buying but those of us who own almost everything produced for
Traveller I see no reason except to maintain a comlete collection.

        Climatic disasters. Ecologic catastrophes. Suppose the overall world

associated to massive industrial production, or some light orbital
bombardment, or just an indirect attack (eco-war?). Part of your ice caps
melt, and hydrographics raise. The way back could be harder, but in general
there is a balance between the water freezing and the ice melting around ice
caps, and in some worlds this balance could be VERY delicate. Ice will not
cover the same surface of the world as the water (it tends to *pile* high,
like in the Antarctic). So, a slight interference and... almost any change
of -2 to 2 points in hydorgraphics could be justified without speaking of
massive bombardments or major interference.

Hey, I\'m not talking about getting my stuff published.  You were the one who first 
suggested that we should send IG any task fix that we come up with and feel good about 
backing.

I mean, some credit would be nice, but I really don\'t care if that happens.  What I\'m 
interested in is a clean fix to the task system in the game I love most.  I want others 
to love it as much as I do, and I want any problems fixed.

If my task fix shows up in a supplement one day as if IG wrote it, then that would still 
make me very happy.  It\'s not about getting my name in print.  It\'s about improving the 
game.  That\'s one of the main reasons I find the time it takes to be active on the TML.

I guess I\'ll go ahead and send it in to IG.  I just don\'t want them to think that I\'m 
asking for money, or even credit for that matter.  I know I sound bull-shit humble, but 
all that really matters to me--I\'m not kidding--is improving the game.

I\'m not being at all unreasonable, and I\'m not expecting IG to detail every system.  At 
the minimum, I want sectors detailed to the level that they were handled in the 
Traveller\'s Digest and MegaTraveller Journal.  I\'m not asking for the moon here.

> Here\'s my version of your little scenerio...

I probably shouldn\'t have used my "little scenerio", because I was using the situation 
to illustrate my point.  Of course, you are right in saying that a good GM could handle 
that situation in a number of ways successfully.  Since this is the second post that 
I\'ve seen attacking the scenerio--not the point I was making, I guess that my point was 
not made clear.

I like using official stuff when I can.  Planetary information is one of my pet peeves. 
 I\'ll search all my stuff and buy a new supplement if I can get all of my facts to match 
official documentation.  Heck, right now, I need to find the official Gvurrdon 
sector--something better than the incomplete crap GDW printed in the back of the Vargr 
Alien Module.  I know it is out there somewhere, and I know from all of the recent posts 
that I am not the only Traveller player out there that likes the official stuff.

The point is:  they could publish it all if they wanted to.  And, many of us do want 
them to.

Well, I\'m not advocating just publishing the old stuff.  I want them to improve the old 
stuff with more detail and facinating ideas, but I want that improvement to be a logical 
step from where Traveller has been.  I don\'t want to have, say, the Trojan Reach sector 
to look one way in T4 and be totally different (i.e. planets in different places, new 
names for planets, UWPs changed, etc) from the Trojan Reach sector that I already know.

Isn\'t there anything to be said for consistency?

The method that you are advocating is like watching Star Trek, except the Romulans no 
longer border both the Klingons and the Federation this season.  The producers didn\'t 
like that idea, so they changed it.

That, to me, is a load of crap.

> IG should detail whatever they want to detail...no more, no less. 

You\'ve got to be kidding me.  IG should listen to their fans and give them what they 
want.  We are what makes IG exist, and I think they know this.

How about this.  IG publishes the minimum detail on all worlds--meaning UWPs and names 
only.  These sectors match up with old information, and IG maintains a consistent 
Traveller universe.  But, on several worlds in each sector--one or two in each 
subsector--IG designates as untouchable by official hands.  These would be Ref-Only 
worlds.

Can we agree on this?  I actually like this idea.  I might even design my own world 
myself...

    'from' => 'aspqrz@curie.dialix.com.au',
    'body' => 'Vehicle Design System is Broken! BADLY!

First, some background - some two years ago I was working on a Worldbook
submission for Steve Jackson Game\'s "GURPS" and, as part of the design,
needed some vehicles. OK, so I sat down with GURPS vehicles and worked out
the stats for them as per the design rules therein. Once they were
finished, they looked *badly* wrong - so I checked them against the system
*again*, and got the same figures. OK, since they were basically existing
military vehicles, I checked against data available in Janes and, guess
what, the figures were *badly* wrong ... the system just did not work. The
power required to push a vehicle at a given speed was *far* higher than in
reality, as was the fuel consumption (unrealistically low, as it happens).
So, as part of the design, I simply gave stats from the "real world" and
commented that the Vehicle Design system was unusable for real world
results.

(And, yes, I know Vehicles #2 is out - but I\'m still waiting for them to
arrive in Australia - and, in any case, I doubt that they have fixed the
problem)

OK, I thought, what about FF&S? Does *it* work - well, to cut a long story
short, the system (and *yes*, I *am* wearing my asbestos underwear!) was
so unusable that I simply didn\'t bother to try a design, I simply compared
the fuel consumption ratings given for wheeled vehicles with reality and
saw that it was likely the FF&S system was stuffed as well.

Now that the Vehicle Design System is available in Beta (and I finally
managed to find out where to download a copy!) I have checked into *it*
.. and, guess what -

Am I the *only* one to notice the following and/or am *I* completely
wrong?

Look at these real world vehicles (data from Jane\'s Main Battle Tanks and
Janes Armoured Personnel Carriers) -

M-113A2

Combat Weight: 11.341 tons
Unloaded Weight: 9.926 tons
Max Speed: 67.59 kmh
Fuel Capacity: 360 liters
Max Range: 483 km
Engine: 215 bhp Diesel (0.16125 kw)

M-60 MBT

Combat Weight: 52.617 tons
Unloaded Weight: 48.684 tons
Max Road Speed: 48.28 kph
Fuel: 1457 liters
Max Road Range: 500 km
Engine: 750 bhp (0.5625 Mw)

This is assuming that 1 bhp = 0.00075 Mw (according to my sources, its
actually 746 watts but, hey, 750 W is close enough!)

OK, lets consider the M-113 first -

Allowing for the 0.7 reduction to speed for tracked suspension, actual
speed is 97 kph, which converts to 161 meters per game turn.

So, 161 = (Engine Mw/Vehicle Wt in Tons) x 3000. Thus, 161/3000 =
(Mw/tons), or 0.054 = (Mw/tons).

Unfortunately, (0.16125/11.341) x 3000 = 42.65 meters per turn, or 25 kph!

The actual VDS engine output (assuming a Diesel is equal to Improved
Internal Combustion) needed to drive the vehicle at 161 x 0.7 = 0.43 Mw!

Fuel consumption is no better. The real world engine uses around 50 liters
per hour. The 0.43 Mw engine uses around 76.5 liters per hour. A VDS
engine of 0.16125 Mw uses only around 20 liters per hour - a shortfall of
150%!

Lets look at the M-60 -

Allowing for the 0.7 reduction to speed for tracked suspension, actual
speed is 68 kph, which converts to 113 meters per game turn.

So, 113 = (Engine Mw/Vehicle Wt in Tons) x 3000. Thus, 113/3000 =
(Mw/tons), or 0.038 = (Mw/tons).

Unfortunately, (0.5625/52.617) x 3000 = 32 meters per turn, or 19 kph!

The actual VDS engine output (assuming a Diesel is equal to Improved
Internal Combustion) needed to drive the vehicle at 113 x 0.7 = 1.984 Mw!

Fuel consumption is no better. The real world engine uses around 145
liters per hour. The 1.984 Mw engine uses around 250 liters per hour. A
VDS engine of 0.5625 Mw uses only around 70 liters per hour - a shortfall
of 50%!

Now, assuming I\'m right - and as far as I can see, I am (please point out
any substantive errors I have made here) - it means that the Vehicle
Design system in both FF&S *and* in the CSC is *badly* broken. If the same
factor of error applies to all engine designs, you need to actually use
the following formula to find speed for a given engine size -

(Mw / Tons) x 10000 = meters per turn.

And you need to *double* (at least) fuel consumption for any given weight
of engine.

I am sure that part of this is because there is no simple linear
progression in horsepower to weight, fuel consumption, and whatever (well,
I\'m *not* sure, but it seems most likely to a non-gearhead, non-mechanic
like me!). However, touting a system as superwonderful, as all the
gearheads have with FF&S (on which the VDS is based :-{ , when it cannot
even design a real world performance - well, it seems like they\'ve missed
the point.

Now, as the designer of "Rigger Black Book" for "Shadowrun" (remember, I\'m
wearing my asbestos underwear, so feel free to flame!), the approach *I*
took was that there was no way that a realistic system could be done using
real world units ... so I simply used game related units. That way no
smartass  (like me ;-) could look at the final figures and say - "That
doesn\'t work".

This is *the* major problem with FF&S (I understand from everything I\'ve
read on 3G3 that Greg *has* managed to get a system that works with
weapons - modern ones, at least), if it cannot be used to design real
world modern vehicles, and insists on using real world values for future
developments, it is more than reasonable to assume that the "future"
values are as broken as the "modern" ones. And, of course, the advance of
technology since the first release of Traveller, lo these many years past,
has made some of the "advanced" technology of the three little black books
ridiculously outdated in todays terms.

Look, when designing "Space Opera", Ed Simbalist, Mark Ratner and I all
took the assumption that the future would be *vastly* more advanced that
the present ... and the predictions we made in some areas are looking
pretty modest (if not downright sick) in todays terms. Yet compare many
areas of SO technology with CTrav technology and it makes CTrav\'s efforts
come off far the worse - and, in designing an SF rpg today (and I am doing
so at present), I would *never* use real world values that can (and
*will*) be open to dispute.

I guess what I am saying is, it\'s all like the "canon" argument - there
*is* no canon beyond what Marc Miller and licensed products say there is
... and this varies so much that it isn\'t funny - there are *no* usable
vehicle design rules (Starships are, to a degree, different, because we
have no really 100% valid "real world" designs to measure them against ...
except aircraft or ships, and then only for accommodation rather than
systems) in existence. I am of the opinion that there are really only one
of two solutions -

1) Redo the VDS a la Rigger Black Book with a variety of chassis designs
which can be modified within limits, but provide no overall design system.
Sure, the gearheads will hate it - but it won\'t come up with ridiculous
power plant and fuel consumption values simply because there will be no
such values to check it against!

2) Redo the VDS, preferably by someone with Mechanical/Automotive
Engineering experience (just as Greg had the experience with Guns to make
3G3 work) to get some real world values that work! Assuming that this is
possible to do with some sort of simple system. Otherwise, go back to 1).

Actually, it just struck me that it may be a good article for a future
issue of "Dark Star" for a complete *simple* Vehicle design system based
on the ideas from RBB. At least the non gearheads will like it!

Any comments are welcome! Flames to the usual place.

Yep, just like MTrav and then TNE was "stomped on" ... sorry, as much as I
*loathed* MTrav and *loathed AND despised* TNE, it was the only game in
town if you wanted to get the latest and best for Traveller. I ignored all
the stuff that I had old CTrav stuff for and which was *broke* in
MTrav/TNE, but for a lot, well, you had to at least acknowledge the
existence of the newer versions.

I don\'t see anything *really* objectionable in T4, but if it did turn out
that Marc Miller et al *do* do something that you and I find beyond the
pale, so what? What do *they* care ... unless its really, truly, horribly,
terribly, awful, we\'ll probably buy it anyway!

Why have a skill level limit.  Stephen Hawking is in a wheelchair, and he must be at 
Astro-physics-6 by now.  Oh, I see.  Astro-physics is governed by Edu--not a physical 
attribute.

I just have a problem with having a level limit in Trav.  It is not needed.  The way the 
experience systems are designed, in all versions of Traveller, it is hard to continue 
going up at the higher levels.  The possibility is still there for those who do, but the 
probability is pretty small.

I don\'t think Trav has a problem in this area.  I think the idea is good, but this is 
not an area of T4 that needs fixing.

I feel the same way.  I worked for days, used several probability print outs from 
yourself and others, and even play tested the thing.  I\'s kind of anit-climatic when you

Heck.  I think it\'s great.  Much better story fodder than the usual "I\'ve been in the 
Army for 12 years and I just want to own my own ship now" Traveller characters.

Never said it is.
I just think, that could be something, where one as a GM can maneuver in 
the gray zone between canon and anti-canon. Can make fun if you do it 
right, but beware of misjumps ;-) !!

Oh? And where, pray tell, did you get info about sectors that hadn\'t

Most refs I know would just say: "Get real, you *know* that they

Sorry, but you are being terribly unrealistic. What would you do if
your players were operating at the "edge" of the areas that have been
detailed in the various supplements. There\'d *still* be no data, and
you can\'t blame anybody for it. The "detailed" areas are *always* going
to be limited, regardless of whether or not there are any "set asides".
If your players decide to go over the edge, it is up to you to just
plain *tell* them that they can\'t.

Nope. If it\'s officially detailed, I can virtually guarantee that
someone will have *something* in the area that\'ll screw us up if we
change things. That sort of thing tends to propogate as time goes on
until you wind up having to re-write large chunks of the official
material. No thanks.

Published material can *never* be complete. There will *always* be an
"edge" to the published areas. And if your players decide to cross it,
you are right back in the same fix you just complained about. Only you
can\'t blame us.

Face it. Regardless of wether or not there are "set aside" areas, there
will *always* be places that aren\'t covered by published materials. So
you have two choices. Tell the players that the area is off limits
because there\'s no info, or live with ad-libbing it.

The *only* difference that "set asides" make is the the "blank" spots
will be easier to reach (ie, the edge of the mapped out areas will be
more ragged). That\'s it.

> One other point I\'d like to mention.  I don\'t just want complete
> published material (read:  no blank sectors, subsectors, or systems),

That\'s flat out impossible. The maps will *always* have an edge! So
unless you expect IG to publish the entire *galaxy* (100,000 parsecs
across!) you will have to accept the *fact* that there will *never* be
"complete" info. 

All we want is to have some easier to get to "frontiers".

start a blood war or anything.

Why are the weapons in the TNE equipment guide so heavy?  

I was reading Phil\'s post on the broken vehicle design system in FF&S when it made me 
think of a problem I had last game session.

It\'s nothing major--just a compatibility issue between Traveller systems, but, man, 
those weapons in TNE are really heavy.

In my game, we\'re using the T4 rules but the TNE combat system, converted to the T4 task 
system, of course.  I like rolling for every bullet and seeing those bullets tear apart 
a target with the hit location chart.

But, I\'m using the easy CT/MT/T4 system of weight/load/carry calculation.  You know--you 
can carry your Str in kilos.

As my players jumped from the SBD to the outsystem Auto Drone, I made them all check 
their encumbrance to make sure that they wouldn\'t get bogged down with items if they ran 
into some gravity.

The TNE weight allowance really makes even a weak character able to carry vast amounts 
of weight.  We\'ve got a character in our group with a Str of 2 and an End of 5.  Under 
TNE rules, that character can carry 21 kilos without being burdened.  Man, that\'s over 
46 pounds--pretty good for a person who is almost crippled.

This is why I switched to the T4 weight system, but have you seen those weapon weights?

A magazine for a gauss rifle in TNE weighs 1.713 kg vs. the .4 kg weight given in Book 4 
and the MT Imperial Encyc.  That\'s over 4 times the weight!  

The lightest power pack for a TL 9 laser rifle weighs 44.3 kg in TNE vs 4 kg in CT/MT.  
I noticed T4 really increased the weight with its TL 12 laser rifle--a 15 kg power pack.

These numbers are all over the board.  Up until now, I\'ve been just saying what we are 
seeing is the variabilty among different manufactures on different worlds, but a power 
pack that almost weighs a hundred pounds is hard to believe.  Who would make such an 
impracticle weapon?

I would think that this was just a printing error, but TNE is rife with such outlandish 
weights.  I could go on--PGMPs, FGMPs, several small arms, and so on.

Have any of you thought about this, and do you have an easy fix that I can use?  Right 
now, I\'m just estimating weights based on T4/MT/CT, but if anybody has a more 
appropriate way to make these things lighter, then please post it.

Thanks,

Kenneth.

I\'ve got a friend who\'s been collecting comics, and for years, he\'s been buying many
from this guy who operates out of his house.  So, I\'m with my friend the other day, and
he decides to stop by the comic guy\'s place to get his monthly fix.  I\'m there for the
first time, and what do I find?

Traveller Stuff!  Yes, beautiful, mint condition, never been purchased before, original
CT Traveller Stuff.  I was in heaven.

I purchased all he had.

I got the first edition of Snapshot, unopened, still in the wrapper!  I just love it.
Ain\'t life grand?

The guy said life is funny that way.  He\'s had it since it was published in 1979.  It\'s
been through two stores that he\'s owned, and nobody has ever bought it.  He saw how
flabbergasted I was, and he mentioned that it was just ironic that he\'s had it all these
years only to have it fall into the hands of a true Traveller fan--someone who can
really appreciate it.

Well, I\'ve filled in some missing holes in my collection, and I let my gaming group pick
their spoils.  To my dismay, I still have some items left.

And, like my Snapshot boxed set, I thought that I would give these wonderful pieces of
literature a chance to find a home with someone who would really appreciate them.

What better place to do this than on the Traveller Mailing List?

So, sharpen your pencils for your Christmas lists, I\'m going to do my first Traveller
Auction.

All items (but one) are in mint condition.  The auction will last until November 21st,

postage will be over and above the bid price.

E-mail all bids to me directly at dreamer@brokersys.com.  If two equal bids are sent,
then I will look at the time sent as the deciding factor.  The auction is open to
everyone, and you don\'t have to be on this list to bid.

Depends on how you define "huge". My feeling is that the "blank" areas
will (and should be) small IN COMPARISON TO the detailed areas, at
least until there are a *lot* of sectors detailed.

> Sounds like they wanna sell us a game and not do any background work.

Face it, there\'s no way they can detail the entire universe. We\'d just
like to get that reconized so they don\'t block off "open" areas by
sticcking something on the far side.

> I use the UPP to generate adventures, not the other way round

It\'s not practical to do *true* "frontier" exploration *anywhere*
within about 5 *years* travel of core, simply because of the way GDW
scattered things around. You\'ll either be exploring areas that were
explored and then "lost" in the Long Night, or you\'ll run into one of
the other races.

That *really* limits you if you want to have stuff other than "one
world" adventures.

I\'d like to avoid the problem of the backwaters getting "surrounded"
which happened with depressing regularity in CT, and then in MT. TNE
effectively didn\'t *have* backwaters.

That\'s why I\'d like to see the "backwaters" start as the tip of
"wedges" pointing more or less towards the "center" of the Imperium. So
the Empire can keep expanding, but so can we. We\'d always have "more
space" on the "outside" edge of our territory.

At the same time, by keeping the angle of the wedges reasonable (the
pie slice analogy I used in another message), the detailed space gets
to expand outwards as well. 

And not all "wedges" have to start close in. That way there can be new
sstreches of "fresh" territory added as the detailed areas (both
officially and unofficial) expand ever outwards. 

If "known space" ever gets big enough, spiral arm boundaries and the
like can set limits to *both* types of area, and let new mixes of
official and unofficial start up on the far side.

Fine. I just want some of the sectors to be "blank" so that I don\'t
have to worry about conflicting with official data.

Not gonna happen. It\'s already been "officially" stated that the
program used by DGP to generate sectors was "broken", and new data
*will* be different. Right down to star locations.

As for Judges Guild, I have the *four* sectors they published. Atlas of
the Imperium doesn\'t even have the same star locations! As I recall,
Beyond, Trojan Reaches, and other third party stuff was invalidated
just as badly during the megatraveller years.

Nope, what I want (and I seem to be typical of the "blank areas" folk)
is blanks at the subsector and sector levels. And I\'d rather not have
them be surrounded by detailed areas.

So instead of published stuff eventually forming a growing circle, I\'d
like to see some "pie slices" taken out at various places around the
rim so that we can have "virgin territory" without having to site it
well past the "rim" (and thus way out of the flow of normal stuff).

Heck, just give a few "minor" rifts and areas with sparse stellar
distribution and you\'d get expansion to work that way anyhow.

> I think this would solve the problem.

I disagree. A planet here and a planet there doesm\'t really help. It
means that we can\'t have multi world civilizations that we get to run
first contact with, or things like a "puzzle" consisting of ruins of an
extinct (non-Ancient!) civilization spread over a number of worlds.

> If others want to change it in their campaigns, then they can do it.

Because the *clear* evidence from the past shows that if we don\'t get
GDW to leave us some areas as a "frontier" and "unexplored space",
they\'ll wind up "stealing" our areas out from under us. 

Consider someone who started with the Spinward Marches sector. There is
not *one* adjacent sector that wasn\'t effectively "pre-empted" by GDW,
DGP and company sticking various empires off in that direction. Thus
killing any "exploration" campaign that wasn\'t willing to throw out
*everything*. In which case, they aren\'t going to sell *any*
supplements to us.

The most I\'d agree to is the *physical* UWP stuff. I *don\'t* want
starport, population, government, law and tech defined. And the only
reason I agree to the *physical* stuff is that it makes it possible for
me to "trade" world (and world group!) writeups with other folks who
are detailing the areas. 

> The problem is, the people who are changing are still changing.  We
> who are not changing are forced to change when we don\'t want to.  Hey

First of all, our whole point is that we *don\'t* want to be changing.
We want to be able to supply our *own* details, without having
something official come alkong and jerk the rug out from under us.

Second, you are *not* being forced to change. You just have to treat
our areas they way you\'d treat any other area that hasn\'t been detailed
(and that\'s a *lot* of the area on the big map of the Imperium and
surrounding powers!) You just fail to realize that there *are* such
areas, even if you get your way.

> I\'d like to see IG come out with some supplements detailing sectors.

Believe it or not, so would I. I just want some sectors left alone for
folks like me to deal with as *we* wish.

> This could be a series with one sector per book, or some bigger unit,
> like doing all the domains together.

Trust me, you don\'t want units bigger than sectors detailed this way.
Either the detailing suffers, or it becomes a royal pain to find the
info you want.

Without computer support, 3d is just plain not practical. Remember, the
"galactic disk" in the vicinity of Sol is several hundred to several
*thousand* parsecs thick. 

Have you ever played any of the games that attempt to handle true 3d
space? As far as I know, I own copies of all *three* of them. SPI\'s
"Starforce Alpha Centauri", Traveller 2300, and a third one I can\'t
recall the name of right now. 

Ever single one of them is difficult to play because you can\'t "see"
the relationships between the stars, except from the one direction the
map lets you. And they are all limited to 30-50 light years from earth,
as it gets just *too* complex after that.

I had a computer program (lost in a disk crash) that left me view the
same stars in 3d on the screen. I could zoom in and out, and rotate the
view. It made it a *lot* easier to figure things out, but it still left
much to be desired. If we ever get decent 3d displays, or at least
cheap VR gogles *then* we can start working with 3d.

Here\'s how I look at it:  IG is doomed to suffer the slings and arrows of 
outraged fans no matter what they do.  Look at this scenario, with three 
trav fans at their local game store, looking over First Survey:

John:  "Hey, look!  First Survey is out.  Let\'s check it out!"

Cindy:  "Look at that!  They\'re re-selling the same stuff GDW sold twenty 
years ago!  What a rip off!"

Dan: "No, it\'s different.  They changed the hydrographics percentages on 
every world.  The nerve of them!"

John:  "You two both missed the fact that there are blanks in the UWP 
listings.  What a bunch of lazy schmucks!"

And so it goes.  They just aren\'t going to make everyone happy. :(

   The book clearly states that blur is legal, and widely accepted on Sylea.
The police may require that your can of blur contact them each time it\'s 
used, with a photo of who you just blurred.

   "merely being mugged", by someone who obviously doesn\'t care a

   Not for blur.  Not on Sylea.  Perhaps on some hellhole of the Imperium that
you really don\'t want to be on anyway.  You really think having the cops
mug you, lock you up, and deport you for blur counts as \'the joy of having
government?"

>Much better to just let somebody take your money and beat you up! 
   Perhaps the players in your game enjoy getting their butts kicked

Hi Allen,

Please keep in mind that any ref can do whatever s/he wants to 
with his/her own game.  So, there aren\'t *really* any Official Answers to 
such questions, other than those provided by individual referees.

But, let\'s consider the issue you\'ve raised...

(First, this only applies to characters generated with a "target age" in 
mind.  Characters generated with the other method will muster out and 
begin adventuring the first time a continuance or injury roll is failed 
in the one - and only one - career the character is allowed prior to 
adventuring.)

Let\'s see what the book says about it...

p. 21: "The Draft: A character becomes subject to the draft if 1) he 
fails to pass every enlistment roll, 2) his enlistment roll is ever
exactly a 12, or 3) he volunteers for the draft."

p. 22: "Changing Careers: Sometimes, at one point in life or another, a 
person may change his chosen occupation.  For most people this is not an 
easy thing to accomplish.  Often, it is not so much a result of choice as 
of necessity: a mandatory retirement due to injury, or a failure to 
continue.  Still, some people simply choose to quit their current career 
in order to attempt a new one.
       "During character generation, when a Traveller character leaves a 
career for any reason, he may choose to pursue a different one, going 
through the enlistment process all over again.  There is a penalty for 
doing this, however.  The enlistment roll for a second career is subject 
to a DM of -2, for a third career it is a DM of -3, and so on.  All other 
DMs, qualifications, and preferences still apply."

So, the official answer is that the draft can occur any number of times 
during a character\'s career, but:

A character can volunteer for the draft only once, and that would occur 
prior to beginning any career (but possibly after going to any number of 
schools).  Thereafter, if s/he wants to pursue a second (or third, or 
fourth...) career, s/he must follow the rules under "changing careers."  
If the character rolls a 12 exactly or fails every enlistment roll, then 
s/he will be involuntarily submitted to the draft.

That last bit about the draft is so that if a character leaves one career 
but is still younger than the target age decided by the player, and then 
by some mischance fails every enlistment roll, they can still have a 
career to get them to the target age.

Hope this helps,


- -Joe

Not to open a can of worms, but--

Actually, the Declaration of Independence (which is where "life, liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness" comes from) only says those are *among* 
the inalienable rights, and the Constitution explicitly says that the 
people have any rights not explicitly limited in the Constitution itself
(a principle not very well-observed in American history).  

But the right to bear arms was, equally explicitly, put in the Bill of 
Rights in order to facilitate the raising of militias.  It isn\'t there 
to insure the ability of the citizens to mount armed rebellion.

I really start to wonder about the time constraints... did they have but
three hours for editing or what?  Sorry, but I\'m really sick of seeing
excuses being made for the sloppy work of Imperium Games.  By now I have
spend about $100 on their product and got nothing but an error-riddled
rulebook which is useless to me.

If I am able to read through the book in one day and can find dozens of
mistakes (and I\'m a native German), why where they not able to do that?  I

That doesn\'t help us customers if we have to buy that once more.  If the
Traveller rulebook would have been car I\'d sue them for "attempted murder"
or something like that :-(

The rulebook is so riddled with errors that you simply need someone who is
able to think and read to find 95% of them.  I\'m living in Germany,
English is my second language, I\'m almost new to Traveller and nonetheless
was able to find dozens of mistakes in the rules and even more cases of
dumb editing, which did not help to enhance the quality of the rules.
This really tells me what Inhavw to think about the editor\'s skills.

> I don\'t mean to suggest that you folk aren\'t doing a real good job. 

Then I\'ll suggest it.  The blatant misstatements on the net, the sloppy
(nay, horrible to non-existant) editing and their dumb schedule (making
holidays when a lot of work needs to be done?!? Great idea) combined with
the failure of the hardcovers to show up by now really annoy me (could
anyone at Imperium Games tell me when the _last_ signed hardcover was sent
out?!?  I\'m still waiting for mine).

I really wanted to give them a second chance but with each day passing I
really find myself wishing more and more that they\'ll soon suffer from
their mistakes >:-(

Sorry, but I\'M really angry by now.  IG has made as many mistakes as
possible and currently they don\'t show any signs of improving.

The Monte Carlo method may be a bit extreme for a hobby, but with computer
technology it isn\'t much worse than designing a navy (or writing software).

If I am going to plunk down hard-earned cash for an official sector, I\'d much
rather have it done with some kind of simulation than just randomly
generated.  Whether the simulation was something like the game GDW used to
generate the background for Traveller: 2300 (aka 2300 AD) or a computer
simulation is besides the point.

Right now I have a student working on simulations to produce gaming
backgrounds. This is the approach he came up with (independently of prompting
from me).  Hopefully he can get it working, so we will have another tool for
developing our universes.  (He\'s also started rolling up a Traveller
character, and keeps bugging me to start a game after school.)

Sounds like a good idea:  Send it to IG, with a cover letter stating

        Well, actually, that\'s not entirely true.  If you define the RTBA
as the right to walk down the street with a pistol on each hip and carrying
an assault rifle, then no.  However, in Canada, the citizenry in general
has the right to purchase and keep firearms, both pistols and long guns.
The acquisition process is carefully monitored, takes some time, and
keeping guns lawfully requires that the owner register his weapons much as
he would register his cars.  There are also rules on safe storage and
transport, and on magazine size, barrel length, and rate of fire.  The
object is to preserve the right of individuals to own firearms, while at
the same time restricting ownership to non-felons and non-loonies, and
providing sanctions for irresponsible gun ownership.

        There\'s a fascinating debate about constitutional approaches to
civil rights out here, but I\'ll stop now.

        The UK, OTOH, has just banned all handguns save .22 target pistols.

        In a desperate attempt to make this somehow germane to Traveller, I
would argue that this shows up the flaw in linking law level to weaponry.
I\'d argue that the US has a higher law level than Canada (in the sense that
it has a great deal more of the stuff; 53 (?) as opposed to 11 legislatures
churning out the stuff, and a much higher level of regulation), but is
laxer in the area of firearms.

        So we\'re back to Booty-shaking, then: why not simply have
multilayered clothing: PiezoCloth(tm) sandwiched between regular cloth:
motion provides the neccessary flex, and the power gets run to your
belt-pack recharger to keep your large collection of personal technotoys
running?

        If this would turn out to be too stiff and encumbering, try putting
PiezoCloth in your bootsoles, on the seat of your pants, and if you\'re
backpacking, in backpack shoulderstraps?  Or line the corridors and chairs
on a starship with the stuff?

        More importantly, dammit Jim I\'m a law student not an electrical
engineer!  Anyone out there care to try and come up with some numbers for
this?

        OTOH, you could always argue that Shaq\'s speed is a function of his
strength, not his dex, and that he does have a relatively higher BB score;
just that his characteristics don\'t let him take advantage of it to the
point that Jordan does.

        However, I get the point: I may have considerably underestimated
the importance of skill vs. size in basketball.  My apologies to all

        Depends largely on the caber.  I\'ve seen events where the caber was
litterally an oversized, rotten fence post (apparently the one at this
year\'s Maxville Games was one such; one tosser managed to break it).  In
such a situation, I\'d argue that Count Caber\'s higher skill might enable
him to evaluate the ballistic and aerodynamic consequences of it\'s being
lighter than usual and thereby get a good toss. OTOH, if it were a true
caber, a manly caber, a thoroughly large solid and heavy caber, Mor
Muscle\'s higher characteristic would enable him to put it over the top with
more ease than Count Caber\'s.

        And if they were going for distance (like they should) than Mor
Muscle\'s greater strength would put him over the edge.

        As I\'ve threatened, what about dwarf-tossing?  <sounds of FGMP\'s

This is a splendid idea. I\'ve long ago worked out some supplemental tables
that allowed me to get a correllation between habitability and population
while still allowing for every possible combination. They weren\'t all that
bulky  --  they took up one page, explanations included  --  but they were a
lot more clumsy than this. They did account for starport types too, which
your idea dosen\'t, but still...)

Back when I worked out settlement patterns for the Trojan Reaches, I used
six categories:

5: Earthlike: Terran-norm or Terran-prime
4: Friendly: Breathable atmosphere (4-9), Hydrographics 1-9
3: Neutral: Breathable atmosphere, Hydrographics 0 or 10.
2: Difficult: No breathable atmosphere (0-3 and A)
1: Hostile: Corrosive or (after 326) Insidious Atmosphere
0: Impossible: Insidious atmospheres (before 326)

(This was the chance per generation that a planet close to a settled planet
would get an outpost. It was also the chance that an existing outpost would
survive. If it did survive it got a roll to see if it turned into a colony
and all colonies got rolls to see if they turned into independent worlds).

Using your idea one would use 4 dice for Earthlike and Hostile planets
and 3 dice for Friendly and Difficult planets.

Yes, but remember that the amandments that form the bill of rights
are written in negative language  "shall not be infringed." refers
to the federal government.  It also explicitly refers to "the
people", not to the States, although reading it in such a way that
it is to make sure the feds don\'t interfere with any State\'s right
to raise a militia would be far closer to the intent than the right
of the federal gov. to raise armies.

I think it\'s important to note that militias of the time were all
able-bodied men, and that damn near everyone had a rifle (in those
times, and assault rifle such as it was :-)

Ob Traveller:  What is the Imperial policy regarding the local
support of squadrons?  Is there a tax-like requirement of a certain
tonnage per GPP (Gross Planetary Product) that mudt be supported in
colonial squadrons?

The added compression has to use at least as much power as what you get
from your crystals. No matter the TL you\'ll never get energy for free
unless you wan\'t to play "Advanced Dungeons & Starships". This is I think
not a nitpick but feel free to do a as you please in your campaign. The
conservation laws of the universe are already in a pretty bad shape from
gravthrusters and jumpdrives.

questions added to the IG FAQ, which is available from Peter Miller\'s web 
site at (http://www.dragonfire.net/~pm/traveller/).

Q.  Are there any IRC channels that are Traveller-related?

A.  Yes.  Use any undernet.org server (i.e., atlanta.ga.us.undernet.org,
saltlake.ut.us.undernet.org, chicago.il.us.undernet.org, or
london.uk.eu.undernet.org), and join #traveller.  It\'s not an official
channel yet (not enough users), but you will find at least a few fellow 
Traveller enthusiasts there most evenings (US time).
    Get in touch with your Internet Service Provider if you need 
information on using IRC.


Q.  When will an error-corrected version of Traveller be available?

A.  That\'s hard to say.  The real answer is, as soon as the current  
print run of traveller sells out.  IG produced one print run, and
immediately sold out.  They were still in the process of determining
all the error corrections that would be necessary in order to make
the "version 1.1" edition, so they had another print run done with the
same plates (and, therefore, the same errors).  Once that second print 
run sells out, IG will be able to have new plates made (without the
errors), get a print run done, and get the books on the shelves.
    So, reasonably, one could conjecture that IG might have the error-
corrected version of T4 out sometime during the first or second quarter
of 1997, depending on how well T4 sells during Christmas.

Nope. It\'s power that\'s *only* used if there are people in that stateroom.

Except you have to balance the volume and mass of all that tap water
against the expense of recycling it. Consider: One person is going to
use 4 liters a day just for "drinking". Assume the guy is up on his
hygiene, and showers once a day. That\'s around *80* liters *minimum*.
Now add the water for washing his hands, flushing the john, washing his
clothes and the dishes. That\'s *easily* 100-200 liters a day. So we are
talking around a ton *mass* of water for a week. That requires lot of
fuel to haul around. Plus, you need *seperate* tankage for the clean
and "used" water. Multiply by the total number of passengers and crew
(and allowing for the potential of "double occupancy" of all
staterooms) and you\'ll suddenly discover that you *have* to recycle the
water. And that is *expensive*.

You *don\'t* cut corners on life support. But you *can* save money by
"turning off" empty staterooms. No life-support costs for those rooms.

And powering the air & water recycling gear, the cooking facilities,
etc, etc. The load on all of these is pretty much proportional to the
number of people aboard. And "closed cycle" air and water gear is a
*lot* more expensive to operate than air conditioning, heating and
sewage in an "open cycle" environment like a typical planet.

Info on nuclear subs will help some, but they do cheat on the
water/sewage. And they have this huge heatsink they are travelling
thru.

Well, either you are one hell of (ptoie!) "political" officer, or you

The problems are twofold. First, consider that you\'d have to keep the
speed relative to the atmosphere *very* low (probably under 25 km/hr).
This is necessary both to avoid undue stresses on portions of the ship,
but also because of the *very* turbulent airflow due to the irregular
shape. At that sort of velocity, it\'s going to take *hours* to land. 

Now consider the fact that the *winds* in the atmosphere cvan have
velocities much higher than is safe for the ship, and that velocities
of adjacent air masses can differ by *hundreds* of km/hr in distances
of 100 meters or so (jetstreams, microbursts, etc). This makes
attempting to land an unstreamlined ship far too dangerous to attempt
except in direst emergency, and if the ship is damaged that badly, it
likely won\'t hold together or be controllable enough *anyway*.

If you don\'t live in an area that gets windstorms much, try to find
some video tape of such. Sustained winds of more than 50 km/h (30 mph)
do a fair amount of damage. The occasional *gusts* up to double or
triple that will demolish structures that were expected to stand up to
*occasional* 50 km/h gusts. Since the ship is *not* designed to handle
anything except thrust, and normal manuevering, the wind loading *will*
be in directions it isn\'t designed to handle. Result? Chunks ripping
off the ship, loss of control, or both.

The "sail area" of such a ship is so enormous as to dwarf any
reasonable manuevering thrusters. It won\'t be controllable. And since
it\'s only braced for 1g in a specific direction, you have to figure out
how to make sure the 1g is only applied in that direction. And you
*can\'t* land it, because it\'s not braced to have something *outside*
pushing on the hull that way.

There\'s a big difference between being braced to withstand thrust, and
being braced to support its own weight under gravity. And in large
sections of the ship, the required bracing for one will be almost the
*opposite* of that required for the other.

Easy. Air is *very* opaque at X-ray frequencies. The entire beam energy
would be absorbed within less than 10 meters. 

Matter of fact, that\'s how nuclear bombs create thermal and blast
effects. More than 90% of the energy release is soft x-rays. They only
get a few meters before being absorbed by the air. This heats the air
rather drastically, creating both the blast wave and the "thermal
pulse". In a vacuum, the blast effects are pretty minor. But the x-rays
will fry you in your boots at many, *many* kilometers. (I think we once
determined that a mere 1 meg nuke would give a fatal dose to all
unshielded personnel within something like 100,000 km in space!)

Anyway, not only does your xray laser get all the energy absorbed by
the air, the resulting blast/flare of heatr and light right in front of
your laser emitter isn\'t very good for the ship (or other vehicle) the
laser is mounted on.

This one gets *real* messy. I know folks who allowed free use of this
and it got kinda ugly. They had ships with huge arrays of capacitors
instead of fuel tankage (they had that too, but just enough to "basic
use" while charging the first bank of capacitors.

They had enough energy in a *small* fleet of these things to be a major
danger to any planet they were orbiting!

That\'s not the USAF, just SAC (Strategic Air Command). I spent enough

Even at a "mere" 1000 AU, don\'t hold your breath waiting for a reply.
It takes light roughly 500 seconds to cross *one* AU. so at 1000 AU,
it\'s roughly 6 days each way (5.78). So you send a question on Monday,
they receive it on Sunday, and you get the reply on the *second*
Saturday after you asked.

Pretty poor drawing, but I hope you get the idea. The "point" sector
"throws a shadow" so all the sectors in the shadow are also "unknown,
but you still get equal *proportations* of know/unkown as you expand
outwards. 

And frankly, as we expand outwards, the number of sectors to be
detailed goes up rather quickly. 

radius	number of "new" sectors added
- ----	----
1	1
2	8
3	16
4	24
5	32

At some point official material will either get really scarce, or it
will be really poor.

Why not discard the entire Traveller Universe?
Make your own background, your own history. Then you are free to modify everthing 
without fear of contradiction
I could do it, fairly easily, and it would be interesting and consistent.
BUT... I like Traveller\'s background, the little fiddly details help me make adventures
The UPPs are fun to read (yes, they are) because I see stories in them (why a TL F 
world next to this TL 4, well?)
If you don\'t want a background, don\'t buy it!
But please, don\'t discourage IG from even thinking about it.

Re: Imperial Weapons Permits.

It seems to me some folks are getting way too excited about this. The
Impy laws governing where you can or cannot take a gun are only going to
apply to those territories governed by the empire, like starports,
consulates, reserves, bases, et cetera. Same as it ever was.

It will most certainly NOT apply to the mainworlds of systems, since
those worlds govern themselves. You need no permit from the empire to
carry a weapon there. And no Impy permit will entitle you to carry a
weapon there. To see whether you can walk around with your favorite gun,
consult the local law level. Same as it ever was.

As in the real world, weapon laws will vary from government to
government. There will be a full diversity of adventure settings in
Trav, as far as these (and other) things are concerned. Same as there
ever was.

I, for one, am glad to finally hear what the Impy rules are. It makes sense
that they would be uniform and not dependent on local law level.

In the very interesting ongoing discussion on HEPlaR tactics, David Nelson
suggested doing planetary slingshot passes, a la NASA\'s probes, to pick up
speed and reach your destination faster.  Alas, it won\'t work -- the
increased (star-centric) speed you can get from such maneuvers is pretty
tiny.  It makes a big difference if you\'re trying to get an
almost-no-thrust probe to the outer system over the course of many years;
if you have a drive that can put out many G-hours of thrust, potential
contributions from slingshots get lost in the noise.

Note that this argument only applies to the *speed* component of velocity,
where your goal is "Get from A to C faster by flying past B" -- if your
goal is to change *direction* cheaply, flyby passes can be a big help.
The general rule is that a close flyby sends you away with almost the same
*speed* as you arrived with, but in a very different *direction*.  Read
Larry Niven\'s novel "Protector" for a lovely description of a "sharp right
turn in deep space" based on this principle.

You\'d still have the possibity of very nasty KE weapons, but damage
would limit the speeds you top out at based on armor, etc..  In other
words while you might have 16,667km/s of delta v (1000gturns), you might
only be able to safely go 1000km/s at a time.  It just means you could
go up to that speed, stop, then do it again a few times.  Useful on
patrol, if you think patrols away from worlds would have any utility.
Certainly useful for a Belter though :-)

You\'re right, though, the energies are huge.  The kind of particles that
routinely pit the shuttle would wreak a scout at the turn-around point
for some of the trips listed in Book 2 of CT.

For the 900Mkm trip, a 0.1gram particle would deliver 187MJ of damage to
the scout.  In BL this\'d be a PV of 748...  that\'s 8 criticals, plus 31
major hits (well, some of the plain hits would go to punching through
armor).

Beacause, as Hans Rancke wrote, no admiral want to separate their navy to
defend whole system, space around GGs and other fuel sources are full of
sensors and automated defense bases. Sensors send their information to MW
which can activate defense bases when enemy fleet is going to refuel. Those
bases could be very small (only a commo receiver and missile battery,
powered by solar panels or something else) and so they could be very hard to
find and destroy. Of course that isn\'t enough to stop the enemy, but it can
do serious damage.
Those bases are much cheaper than SDBs and many GGs has ring system or moons
which are good hiding places.

Since early T-Plates require that one be within 100 diameters of the planet

field effect to do so; the CoM exists. They do not produce more thrust
energy than they take (although they are close), thus there is some entropy
in the system, and CoE holds.

Higher tech T-Plates simply have the ability to grab much weaker fields,
and thus use the whole system as reaction mass (in my games, I limited
T-Plates to (TL-10)*1000AU). Again, CoE is touchy, but CoM stays. What\'s
the effect of a million Td Battleship (15 Million Tons mass) upon a
combined mass of a solar system? Assuming 6G BB, probaly measured in
microns per month.

The newtonian factor exists under the T-Plates; it\'s just a matter of not
being readily apparent to one under thrust!

    'body' => 'I agree that Traveller needs an Imperial Police force of some kind. But it\'s a
tricky beast to nail down. I\'ve been working on this for my own campaign for a
couple of weeks now, and was just about to ask the same question in this forum.

To date, I\'m aware of Military "Intelligence" organisations like Navel
Intelligence and the Covert Survey Bureau (CSB) of the Scout Service ( similar
to the CIA ), but I haven\'t found any serious material on the less military
aspect of Imperial enforcement.

Here are the results of my research and deliberations to date :

The imperium is not interested in Local crimes of any kind. They only become
interested ( let alone involved ) once a crime ( or criminal ) goes
extra-territorial ( ie: leaves the system where the crime was committed ). In
this way, the police organisation we\'re talking about resembles the american
FBI.

According to the JTAS #14 article "High Justice" by Terry McInnes, the Imperium
is primarily concerned with crimes ( actual or potential ) against the Imperium
itself.

It splits crimes into three categories :
1. Low justice - planetary or local authority
2. Middle Justice - subsector level - "intended to protect helpless societies on
low tech worlds and to protect all societies from excessive damage from military
actions" (Hmm. Perhaps not the best definition methinks. SJM ). Enforced by
police and the military forces of the subsector duke ( backed up by Imperial
forces if required ).
3. "The High Justice of the Imperium, intended to prevent revolt against
Imperial authority, to keep the peace amoung member worlds, subsectors, and
sectors. High Justice is enforced by the Imperial Navy, Army, and Marines, often
assisted by the Security Branch of the Operations Office of the IISS."

And so the discussion begins.

I personally don\'t think the Navy, et al are going to be concerned with tracking
down sabotours, subversives, and rebels. Sure they\'re going to be the instrument
of choice when it comes to bringing rebel planets into line, but not when you\'re
talking about individuals ( or even organisations ) rather than entire
geographic areas. Besides, Naval Intelligence will have its hands full tracking
ship movements, supplies, and enemy agents scouting out resupply bases for the
next frontier war.

And the Scout Service is more likely to be spending its budget spying on the
Zhodani, Vargr, and other EXternal threats than wasting its time looking for
"reds under the bed" so to speak. In other words, I believe that the Scouts are
a externally directed organisation, and their intelligence arm would be more
interested in predicting invasions than internal rebellions ( although there\'s
bound to be co-operation [well ok, maybe !] if they come across a rebellion in
embryo at a fuel stop somewhere.

So, mirroring the relationship between the CIA and the FBI, there would need to
be an Internal Intelligence organisation to keep an eye inwards towards the
existing Imperium.

The artical continues :
"Crimes normally subject to subsector justice include the unlawful introduction
of high technology to low tech worlds, the violoation of a planetary
interdiction, posession and/or use of nuclear, checmical, or biological weapons,
and war crimes as defined in the Imperial rules of War".

( Speaking of which - does anyone have a copy of the IROW ? )

In other words, anything that can be detected or prosecuted by normal system
defence vessels or subsector forces in pursuit of the regular duties. This seems
fair to me. The Imperium seems happy to leave as much in the hands of local
authorities as it can ( which leaves the real juicy stuff for the Imperial
Police ).

The artical continues :
"The prosecutors and high courts of the Imperium concern themselves with crimes
that would affect worlds in more than one subsector of the realm..." where there
would be juridictional problems if it were not handled by a higher power. "These
include the capture, transportation, and posession of slaves, piracy, the murder
of Imperial officers, officials, or members of the Imperial nobility, theft of
Imperial property, treason, and conspiracy to commit treason against the
Imperium (Note that treason against a planetary government is a local crime)."

I suspect that there are a lot more activities that would interest an Imperial
body, and which would not be defined as "crimes" as such. These would include
political machinations, and tracking shifting aliances ( ie: spotting potential
trouble before it becomes a fully fledged rebel movement ). It would also
include covert tracking of suspicious shipping and/or persons.


My suggestion is that we adopt somthing like the following structure :


  Imperial Bureau of Internal Security  ( IBIS )
    => The parent organisation.
       Departments :
         - Imperial Security Service ( ISS )
             => like the SIS - charged with protecting the imperial family.
         - Criminal Intelligence Office ( CIO )
             => like the FBI - investigates crimes and threats
         - Special Patrol Group ( SPG )
             => Cross between the Texas Rangers and 007. See below.

( I\'m using the term SIS here to mean the Security organisation that protects
the American president and members of the government - as seen in "In the Line
of Fire". If I\'ve used the wrong name, I apologise )

The parent organisation (IBIS) would be responsible for co-ordinating the
internal departments, and sifting the external intelligence and signals traffic
collected by the Navy (NI) and Scouts (CSB).

The Imperial Security Service ( ISS ) would provide security details for the
Imperial nobility and close protection for the Imperial Family ( in addition to
the elite Imperial Troopers who are better suited for handling worst case
situations ). They would receive intelligence from CIO and SPG routed through
IBIS.

The Criminal Intelligence Office ( CIO ) would be responsible for all open
investigations, and its paramilitary arm ( like the FBIs Quantico Hostage Rescue
Team ) would be available to resolve the outcomes of investigations or
situations, or to apprehend dangerous criminals. The CIO would effectively be
the investigative arm ( and possibly the strong arm ) of the Imperial High
Court.

The Special Patrol Group ( SPG ) would be the most interesting department for
players characters to be involved in. In the first place their role would be
largely covert. Agents would work totally undercover most of the time as
traders, or other spacefaring personnel. Their job would be to ply the
spacelanes keeping their eyes and ears open for rumours of trouble, and to go
where no badge-wielding official could expect to go ( and live ). They would
usually pass information on to the CIO for action once enough evidence was
accumulated. In this way they would be like the Texas Rangers : Agents at Large,
dealing with crimes and situations as they came across them. However, this would
require another departure from the norm because of the huge communication delays
imposed by the Traveller universe. The "Specials" would have to be licensed to
kill ( like 007 ). Assuming that they were liable for account to their superiors
for their actions, and that they were trained to a very high standard, it would
be logical ( perhaps - I expect a few arguments on this one ) to allow them the
lattitude to deal immediately with threats to the Imperium ( where appropriate,
and where "taking them in" wasn\'t an option ). This means that Special Agents at
Large ( SALs/ SAALs ) would be very interesting player characters, and fairly
powerful ones in any universe. To protect their anonimity they\'d avoid
confrontation where-ever possible ( well, as NPCs anyway - can you imagine a
party of players avoiding confronation <g> ) and let the appropriate authorities
handle whatever situations they\'d discovered, but when the the s..t hit the fan,
they\'d be empowered to do whatever it took to bring the situation back under
control ( Imperial control, that is ).

    'body' => 'Something else I\'ve been considering (in relation to the ridiculously over-
priced vehicles in all versions of Traveller, amongst other things) - what
are wages and working hours like on a High Tech world (TL14/15, but even at
TLs from 10-12+)?

Look at what has happened in the last hundred years (what, two or three TLs?) -
we have gone from (industry/mining) a 70+ hour week to a 50 hour week, a 48
hour week and, at present (in Oz) a 35-40 hour week. Consider why this has
happened/been possible - mechanisation has made individual workers vastly more
productive and it has been possible to increase standards of living through
application of this in private lives as well as reduce working hours. There
is every reason to believe that this sort of trend will continue - certainly,
Traveller assumes that computers become more "effective" (at least at
controlling Starships) and that they are an integral part of life in the 57th
century ... otherwise how could even *they* believe that Virus would work
(ignoring the other problems with Virus).

So, how long is a work week/day in the 57th century? Considering the current
rate of decrease, where it has halved over around 3-4 TLs, we can reasonably
assume that it would halve, and halve again, from TL8 to TL15 ... if not more!
So, we have a 9 hour work week ... perhaps three 3 hour days and a 4 day
weekend? Probably much less than this given the improvement in communications
that cut out travelling time for workers who can telecommute from home.

This raises interesting problems for Traveller Starships as they have been
described to date ... or for their crews, at least. They are vastly overworked
and vastly underpaid! Most of the smaller vessels - Scout/Couriers, Far/Fat
Traders and the like - have crews that could not man them at TL15 work hours!
Of course, they are produced at lower than TL15, so, perhaps, that explains
it ... but, of course, TNE has changed all that by increasing their base TL
(the Scout/Courier now has TL/15 rather than TL/6 computers, for example).

Even if they are not overworked, their pay must be below the poverty line.
Consider: the best savings result possible with TNE for a character from a
High Stellar TL world is 5000 Cr per 4 year term ... 1250 Cr per term. Now,
assuming that they are able to save 20% of their salary (a pretty reasonable
figure), this seems to indicate that they have a salary of 6250 Cr per year.
Now, given that 1 Cr seems to be worth around 1-2 US$, and given the costs of
equipment listed in Traveller\'s various versions, this means they *are* living
beneath the poverty line! It has some interesting implications for either the
cost of gear *or* the amount of savings a character should be allowed to
accumulate in character creation ... or both!

Also, if you think about what I am suggesting, it makes the almost requirement
that Hi-Tech Hi-Pop worlds are the guts of the Imperium (as per the Rebellion
in MTrav) somewhat dubious. There is considerable evidence to suggest that
increased standards of living (regardless of religious factors here) lead to
smaller family sizes ... and this seems no less likely to apply to the future.
Then, on top of this, allowing for the complete roboticisation and
mechanisation of factories in the future, how do you envisage them ... with
hundreds of workers bent over manually operated machine tools? Or one or two
supervising engineers who make sure that the automated, self-repairing and
maintaining production lines don\'t manage to stuff up in a way that no-one
had anticipated ... and even *they* are probably just supervising computers
who do most of the actual error checking! So what are the rest of the people
doing? They must be in service industries ... and even there automation and
computerisation would reduce the numbers required, so working hours would
be reduced *and* the number of workers would be small.

So, there seems to be no direct connection between the size of the population
and the high-tech rating of a world. Given that it seems likely that such
worlds would have industries that would be quickly reconfigurable (its all
computer controlled and probably with multi-purpose factories rather than
specialised ones anyway) for any demands that might be put on them ... and
they probably have a *very* considerable export trade to worlds of lower tech
levels (all effectively automated). This should mean that prices of goods on
such worlds should be low and/or wages should be high - which isn\'t the case!

What would all these people do outside of their 9 working hours per week? Well,
a whole rethink of leisure would obviously have been important in such
societies, and leisure activities would be very important ... sports, hobbies,
artistic and craft pursuits etc. would be (presumably) *very* big! Also, we
can assume that, for some people, education and study would be important ...
and would boost their technology further as there seems to be evidence that
suggests that the number of people involved in such pursuits as a percentage
of the overall population is an important influence on the speed of such
change.

All in all, 57th Century cities provide much food for thought!

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Unfortunately, one of the first things, I can remember reading about this
was the TNS extracts in the FFW game. The first thing the Regina SDB\'s did
,when news of the Zhodani at Ruie arrived, was to boost at max G for the
system GG. Unless they were insane, it seems that it was standard procedure
to not only jump in w/o enough fuel to leave but also to proceed forthwith
to the local GG. So standard in fact that *all* the SDB\'s (six, I believe)
went to the GG! Now there *were* TankRons avail. in the FFW game & they came
in handy for fast moves, but were limited in numbers. I\'ve never quite been
able to reconcile these "standard tactics" so I\'ve just had to assume that
there must be some other factor/s, that\'ve never come to light, that would
explain this.

If I recall, it\'s something like .5G to 1.5/2G.  It\'s enough to keep
most races happy by giving the feel of their homeworld\'s gravity.

I think that this is on a room by room basis.  I always assumed that
it was localized based on area.  You know, the entire bridge, a
section of hallway, a room.  Anything that could be partitioned off
from another area.

Well, first of all, I don\'t think it could proved 6Gs.  However, you
could always grav bounce someone.  You know, turn the grav on and off
and bounce them off the walls of a corridor.  That\'s how Virus offed
lots of crews.  But once a highjacker has a gravbelt on, well that
doesn\'t work too well.  Also, most highjackers (at least the pros)
would  probably disable the system ahead of time.

    forgive me that I have just noticed the ludicracy of the rules.)

2)  I\'m having trouble with the reaction mass computations.  When creating a
starships I thought reaction mass was:

                Thrust MW x 0.25  = cubic meter per G-hour.

The vessels in the book seem to have a value computed by:

                (Thrust MW/Maneuver G\'s) x 0.25 = cubic meters per G-hour.

Was there an update that I missed, or am I looking at the numbers wrong?

P.S. - On a related note, what is the maneuver G number for anyway.  I know
it relates to internal structure and to Thrust MW, but how do these
interact.  If I have a ship with Maneuver Performance of 9G\'s (can I do
this??) can I spend more than 9 G-turns (or 9 G-hours).  Please HELP!!!!

This brings me to another point...the universe has changed
significantly in the 100 or so years since the last Imperial Survey;
one of the RC handbooks mentions that interstellar navigation is a
bit more tricky because everything has shifted somewhat.  This should
definitely increase the chances of a misjump to within 100 diameters,

Yes.  There are two major ones we know about, the Imperial Ministry of
Justice (MoJ) and the IISS Security Branch (part of the Operations
Office).

The MoJ is a primarily investigative body with fairly restricted powers
that looks into possible violations of the Imperial High Laws.  Normally,
their Special Investigators work with planetary law enforcement to assist
the locals investigate crimes.  For example, murder is a violation of an
Imperial High Law, but under most circumstances the MoJ would not directly
involve themselves but let local jurisdictions handle the matter.  I tend
to think of their investigators as similar to the US FBI, with additional
jobs which in the US are handled by the Department of Justice -- such as
matters in which the Imperial government needs legal representation and
advice, and the administration of the Imperial prison system.  Of course,
each would be handled by different offices inside the Ministry.  These
are the folks that deal with matters like trade in illegal commodities,
possession of nuclear and biological weapons, terrorism, and so on.

We know it\'s run by a Minister of Justice, because one of them, Porfiria,
was chosen by lot by the government to assassinate Cleon the Mad and take
his place as emperor.  The job probably includes a ducal rank noble title
with it due to its\' importance in the bureaucracy.

The IISS-SB has "the widest powers of any Imperial law enforcement agency",
according the the old JTAS article on the Scout Service.  This seems a bit
odd at first glance, since the responsibilities mentioned involve protection
of IISS facilities.  However, this means that they have responsibility for
protecting the xboat network and Imperial Courier Service, which both carry
important government data and key personnel, among other things.  They also
are probably the source of personnel for the Imperial Protection Detail that
the IISS supports.  The IPD are plain-clothes agents that are entrusted with
the last line of defense for the Emperor\'s person and are virtually always
with him.  I think of the IISS-SB as similar to the US Secret Service, but
with IISS-related duties replacing Department of the Treasury duties.  This
still lets them get into a lot of odd corners.  The gauss carbine that I
posted a while back was meant for the IPD in particular.

Whenever the sneaking SDBs use their HEPLARs they would be visible on PEMS
a LOOONG way. When not thrusting they simply follow Newton/Einstein paths
and are easily tracked. If contragrav only negates gravity and does it at
all ranges (which FF&S say they don\'t) they could fiddle with those on or
off and confuse the tracker greatly.

Finally about slingshots; it works for NASA because they have such
inefficient engines. Chemical rockets at TL 7-8 is definately below
baseline. NASA interplanetary flights are Hohmann orbits modified by
gravassist while CT and TNE ships travel along more or less straight lines
at vastly higher speeds.

I believe that\'s "OrbAt," "orbital artillery," also called "ortillery" in

I noticed this in the two Traveller novels GDW produced (I bought mine
right after news of their demise).  I\'d always been under the impression,
from Classic and MT sources, that the crew was essentially idle once the
ship had entered jump space.  Paul Brunette (sp?), though, has depicted
jump as the engineer\'s nightmare duty station, carefully monitoring power
flow to the drive and ensuring adequate LHyd coolant.

While it\'s nice to have something to DO in jump-space, which is perhaps
Brunette\'s intent, I\'m not sure I like the idea.  LHyd is cold stuff,
and the idea that it all gets tossed overboard (into what?  the jump field?)
after use rather strains my suspension of disbelief.  Though I rather like
his idea of jump discharges... nice atmosphere!

Players will *always* bicker. <g>  I still don\'t buy generic DEX,
and maybe not generic CON.

If you want to make it really simple, why don\'t we just have 2
Abilities?  Body and Mind.  Body is Strength, Dexterity,
Agility, Constitution, and Fitness.  Mind is Intelligence,
Perception, Education, and Will.  Two numbers to deal

I\'d have preferred something besides Charisma if an Ability was

No we don\'t, but adding 1 or 2 isn\'t 3 dozen.


TS> The UPP stats should just serve as a very loose guideline to
    the character\'s Endurance, or Dexterity, or whatever as

Yes, but in TNE each of a character\'s stats is tied to specific
skills.  If you stretch the Attribute across too many Skills
you\'ll create unrealistic situations...and if you have too many
Attributes, then you create a system too complex to play.

I understand the problems everybody points out.  I still would
like to see a change to specific DEX and AGL attributes.

In response to both the CG bit and the Hohlmann interplanetary orbits:
In effect the Hohlmann orbit is designed to "steal" angular velocity from
planets because of conservation of momentum, energy, ad nauseum.  So why
not use the CG lifters in reverse----to _increase_ the mass of the ship
and thus increase the amount of attraction between the bodies?  Anyone
have any ideas about how efficient this would be?

In a campaign that I was running a bunch of years ago I had an entity that
performed law enforcement duties on the behest of the Imperium that was
loosly based upon the IBIS that TSR published in their "Dragon" magazine.

The bunch I created were real bad news to have after you.  I called them
SCIS (Special Criminal and (counter)Intelligence Services).


Some bullet items about these guys.


* All military bases had special sealed orders on compters that were to be
accessed  by the CO of that base when presented with proper credentials by
agents of the SCIS.  These sealed orders were encrypted and could only be
decoded by the use of three keys.  The first key was supplied by the CO, the
second key was supplied by a randomizer device, and the third was supplied
by the agents identity device.  Since the crypto keys were of such value as
to have a 1024 bit size the chance of forging all three was pretty remote.
The randomizer was time based and its value changed every 30 seconds based
on time elapsed since an arbitrary point in time. I digress.

These orders could be anything from an order to supply the agent with
transportation to an destination of their choice to a mobilization of troops
under the orders of the agent.


*  Agents recieved their orders via XBOAT.  Special encrypted transmissions
were used to first send out a query to see if an agent of SCIS was in
system.  Agents usually had laptop computers, or used the computer on a ship
that they "owned."   These were used to answer the query and subsequenty
download the orders as well as intelligence updates that were also
diseminated to field operatives.  (Actually, in my schema all intelligence
officers of all branches got the same intelligence data from the same Xboat
delivery as well as their parent organiztation.)   Orders could be of a
nature as to be directed to a operative of choice or could be send to agents
in general to be picked up and acknowleged by the first qualified operative.

*  Agents were usually in deep cover and had the appearance of something
other than the what they were. Often they were under the cover of being
merchant captains, but other professions were used.  The key being they were
usually encountered where a type A or type B starport was located.

*  Reguardless of physical appearance these agents were experts in all sorts
of hand-to-hand combat, armed combat, demolitions and other skills.  Usually
they had at least one skill of a level that would make them a "guru" of a
profession using that skill.  (for instance computers, or electronics, or...)

Players in my campaign were not even aware of the existance of this
organization and nobody guessed at it even when one of their patrons was an
agent of SCIS.  This was the majority way players encountered these folks.

In one case I used a SCIS agent as an "equalizer" for a player character
that had gotten too big for his britches.   I lovely blonde lady turned out
to be a SCIS agent.  She booked passage on the PC\'s scout ship and when they
arrived in system where  she had  booked passage she arrested him and he was
incarcerated dirtside.

Drop a rock on the Moon,  watch it fall.
Drop a rock on Earth, watch it fall.

The lower gravity on the Moon causes objects to accellerate more
slowly, thus falling slower.  An unstreamlined ship can move through
an atmosphere slowly - and if using CG would reach it\'s terminal
velocity at a much slower speed.

Terminal velocity occurs because the air pressure acting against a
falling body produces a force of accelleration of 9.8 m/s^2 = the
force of gravity.  If the force of gravity were .098 m/s^2 a much
slower decent velocity would be needed to achieve terminal velocity.

I think the more important question re Streamlined/Unstreamlined is:
Does the thing have landing gear?  Can the ship\'s hull withstand
storms and wind?  Are there any components (like
antenna/dishes/missle launchers) which are so poorly designed for
atmosphere that it could damage the ship?

Phil, you made some interesting observations about work habits in the far
future, but some of your assumptions are debateable.  For instance, you
state that work hours have been going down as TL increases.  This
relationship is far from certain.  As we have seen from other discussions
on the list, TL-0 hunter/gatherers only work about 20 hours a week, and
this value (in earth history) has fluctuated wildly independent of TL
ever since.  The 80-hour work week of the 19th century is widely thought
to be a consequence of social factors (religion, class structure, etc.)
rather than technology.

In our own times, work hours have been steadily climbing over the past
decade or so despite (or perhaps because of) computerization.  And the
average 20th century home-maker still spends as much time on his/her task as
19th century homemakers despite all
the technological help he/she recieves.  One reason for this is that as
TL gets higher, standards get higher.  Consider the example of writing a
research paper. Pre-computer and post-computer it takes about the same
amount of time.  The reason is that now papers have to involve more
references (after all, you can them _all_ from a database), and have to
be better laid out.  Also, style is expected to be better since editing
is so easy. Similar sorts of things apply to cleaning houses and other
tasks.

Basically, I don\'t think you can be so sure of a 9-hour work week.
Social factors will interfere, and there are many sectors where computers
do not reduce work time significantly (e.g., service sectors, creative work,
academic areas).  These areas are likely to grow (as they have been in
recent times) and provide people with more work.  Remember, people
fundamentally want to work (most of them, anyway).  Ask the vast majority
of the unemployed and they will tell you: they\'re bored!  If computers
start to take work away in certain areas (manufacturing, etc.), people
will go into other areas.

Regarding starship crews, they won\'t necessarily be paid by the hour, but
by the trip.  Also, they\'re getting free room and board along with their
pay.  Finally, I recall a Cr being worth closer to 4 dollars.

Happy Travelling,
Charles.

Well, off hand, not at all (er, not measurably).

       G M\' R
F = - ----
       r^3

and M\'=M+m   R is a unit vector

Right?  The reason for the M\' is that r is the distance to the center of
mass between the two.

Well M is the planet (or solar) mass, and m is our ship.  M is gonna be
around 1E24-25 kg for a planet, or like 1E30 kg for our sun.  The m term
will be really, really small,  not worth the effort to keep track of.  If
we let the CG change the mass of the ship as high as an asteroid
(say 1E15 kg) then the addition of the ship is 1E-13 %  for the solar
example, and 1E-7 or 1E-8 % for planets.

So if the planet is a unit mass, then the M\' term will be:

M\' = 1+0.000000001 (assuming the ship masses as an asteroid with the CG
on the right way)

So the difference between adding mass or not to the ship won\'t have much
effect.

The bottom line is that the force on the ship isn\'t really gonna change
a gnat farts worth unless the CG can make the mass comparable to M.

Disclaimer:  please bash my math if I screwed up, I haven\'t done a
problem like this in, yeesh, several years, and this is off the top of
my head :-)

Um, this isn\'t true (if it were we never would\'ve gotten to orbit :-).

A (rather idealized) shuttle has an Isp (specific impulse) of around 450
seconds.  The exhaust velocity is around 4.5 km/s.  Low Earth Orbit
(LEO) is about 10km/s.

The Rocket equation relates propellant mass to total spacecraft mass,
and so we can look at this to show my point:

(Mp/Mtot) = 1 - e^-(delta_v)/c   c is the exhaust velocity, delta v is
   final speed.

When the ratio of propellant to total mass is 1, your rocket is _all_
propellant.  If delta_v is 4 times c, then the ship is 98% fuel.

You\'re right that there\'s an upper limit on delta_v, but it isn\'t equal
to the exhaust velocity of the rocket.

I got a c of something like 40,000 for HEPlaR, but I don\'t remember if
it was m/s or km/s, I\'ll look it up.  It also didn\'t have enough energy
inputted (in MW) to cover the KE of the exhaust, so I decided that the
HEPlaR drive had to fuse some of the propellant (making it dirty).

Hmmm, working the above equation backwards, I get about 20,000km/s for
HEPlaR exhaust, so maybe my KE calculation came out to 40,000km/s.

At the very least, BTW, the HEPlaR exhaust is 40km/s----the plasma is 5
times the stated velocity of a plasma gun, even "clean."  Do you want to
be behind the grav bike when it\'s on?

        I\'d always thought the only cooling necessary was _before_ jump,
when the jump drives are producing incredible amounts of power and feeding
it into the zuchai crystals. Once you\'ve finished that, and actually entered
jumpspace, I always thought engineering was a boring place to be.

        Yep. Somebody made a what might be considered big mistake when they
first started putting these things up. They decided they\'d leave the full
accuracy unencrypted until the full constellation was up ... and everybody
in the world realized how useful GPS could be. \'Course, they ignored the DOD
saying it wouldn\'t be that accurate later, and came to depend on it. Now the
DOD is stuck with a fait accompli.

Too bad that the rules make it nearly impossible for any skilled spacer to
do worse than a relativity error under TNE task system/flowcharts; assumes
they run refined (or FPP Processed) fuel, and jump from 100 diams.

TNE actually made jump travel much safer, even though it didn\'t change the
task difficulties.

Would a single level of difficulty really be a suitable difference?
Remember, though that this HALVES the chances of a safe jump, and also
allows for genuine misjumps.

Sounds like he lifted it from battletech; it bears no resemblence to cannon
sources. SSOMv1 (StarShip Operators Manual vol 1) clearly states that Jump
Fuel feeds a high speed fusion reactor. Yes, it would be l-hyd cooled, but
it only operates BEFORE the actual transition.

I have noticed a commmon theme of using jump timme for routine maintenance.
THis is what every group of players I have had since maint rules came out
have done.

But what size ship is being talked about here?  How would this work for
the really HUGE ships in service?  If they could use this system to skimp
on a little gas, they probably would, seeing as how much fuel it takes to
move them anyway.

I\'m trying to figure out how to create a rescue ball, and it\'s requisite
life support abilities via FFS, and I can\'t quite get past the concept.

The problem is, for it to truly be useful in as many situations a
possible, it needs to be able to get away from the ship quickly, support
life long enough to be found (a week/two?), and it needs to be able to be
found (transponder----something like modern-day EPIRB devices on ocean
going vessels).  Now, the major problem is making this device small
enough to be stowable in enough numbers to provide for the crew----an
actual subordinate spacecraft would be too large for the smaller ships.
Also, the most of the actual materials would be outside of those covered
in FFS.

So far, I envision a 3-layer "balloon" built around a rigid axis with a
small solid fuel booster on the forward axis of motion.  The outer shell
would most likely be a gold-coated, self-sealing mylar shell, to
decrease radiation.  The second shell would be a flexible material
(remember the whole point is that it can be packed down for storage) of
some sort of ballistic weave (hopefully self-sealing) to guard against
micrometeors.  The inner most shell would be the main heat retention
shell.  Between these would be inert gases of decreasing pressure to
retain heat and further eliminate em radiation penetration.

The main problem is figuring out how to get it away from a ship in
degrading orbit (at least put the rescue ball in a stable orbit), and to
get the ball rapidly away from a ship that\'s gonna blow.  An booster engine
set up to pull the ball would give more directional stability than one
set up to boost, but I cant see any other way than have a solid booster
mounted on a boom accomplishing.

Any ideas on modifications to this design?  Are there any other published
rescue apparatus out there?

For info on how to use the list server etc, have at look at the TML FAQ which
is at http://www.spirit.com.au/~jamesd/tml-faq.html. The short answer to your
question though, is send the command \'get traveller tml96-599\' to get the

Yes. True (as far as the primitive Hunter/Gatherers are concerned), but one
coulds argue, in a sense, that they *had* no technology. If we look at the
pattern since the beginning of the Renaissance, and certainly since the start
of the Industrial Revolution, the use of increasingly complex machines made
mankind increasingly productive on a per unit basis. Of course, the reason
for the truly horrendous 80 hour weeks of the early IndRev period was, it has
been argued by others better qualified than I, the result of several factors -
and probably one of the most important ones was that society had very little
in the way of capital goods to create the IndRev with, and they had to use
BFI methods to get started. Forex, pre-Renaissance societies required something
like 95% of the populace to labour at agricultural pursuits (growing food) in
order to support the 5% who did not labour in the fields. The gradual
accumulation of intellectual and physical capital meant that, by the time the
17th and 18th centuries rolled around, agricultural production was (relatively
speaking) way up and what is termed the "agricultural revolution" was already
underway. In fact, I understand that there is ongoing debate as to whether
the Agricultural Revolution made the Industrial Revolution possible or was
simply something that happened about the same time. It is only from the 18th
century onwards that truly phenomenal increases in agricultural and industrial
productivity occur ... and, arguably, the latter area really only hit its
stride with the development of the Production Line (by Ford) and Time and
Motion studies (around the same time, AFAIR). Since then, automation has
progressed in leaps and bounds.

I have never seen seriously accepted arguments that the 80 hour work weeks of
the 18th and 19th centuries were a result of religious and class factors (not
that they don\'t exist, I\'ve just never seen them! And, since I\'m reasonably
widely read on the area, I would have expected to have come across them) - and,
in fact, as far as I understand it, these are thought to have been merely
modifying factors to the underlaying cause anyway, not causes in and of them-
selves.

Well, yes, to *some* degree ... but that\'s as much because (IMNSHO) more
because of the truly horrible Reaganite/Thatcherite "economic rationalist"
theories that we have had inflicted on us by know-nothing politicians and
economists masquerading as "experts". You *could* argue that, in fact, we
need *shorter* working weeks *right now* to reduce unemployment, as the
overal productivity of most western nations could easily justify this with
little or no reduction in standards of living. Such a reduction may not be
of a large order of magnitude - but just consider the number of people who
work part time or job-share and have quite a reasonable SOL even now.

Actually, recent research on this shows no such state of affairs. More and more
women are able to enter the workforce and still maintain family lives, and yet
still reduce the number of hours they work on "home duties". Part of this is
because automation at home and at work has reduced the amount of time required
to do those things on *both* fronts and part is because they have come to
realise that, forex, it\'s not *necessary* to *iron the sheets* (as an example).
In Oz, forex, meal preparations has become vastly less time consuming because
of the introduction of the microwave and, more recently, the trend towards
butchers and food stores selling pre-prepared meal components; want Lemon
Chicken and Rice, but the pre-mixed, pre cut to size, but uncooked lemon
chicken and cook while cooking the rice. I do not think that your argument is
valid here. Certainly, there is much less work for women (or house husbands)
to do around the house than there was during, say, the 20\'s or 30\'s (while I
wasn\'t around then, my parents were, and they do *not* talk of the "good old
days" ... they like things as they are here and now, thank you very much!).
If I am overestimating the current state of affairs, I believe that you are
underestimating them by a far greater amount.

Perhaps. I remember writing undergrad essays and they were a pain in the rear
end to do ... but they could be handwritten (if neat) c. 1973-75, now they
must be done on computer. But, as I understand it, standard templates for
the documents are provided by the various faculties ... unless you are as slow
a typist as I am, then it should make no difference (it would actually make no
difference even to me simply because computers allow you to rewrite the doc
without having to start again from scratch. I know, I had to submit my MSs to
FGU as typewritten manuscripts, and when I finally converted to an Apple II
{48k of RAM! 170k 5.25 Drive!} in c. 1980, it made a *vast* difference in my
speed of output, and I\'ve never learned to touch type, either). Creating a
style for a doc and applying it thereafter is not any work worth the name with
a computer). I do not see that this is a valid or believable support for your
case at all. In fact, I would tend to have said that it supported *my* side
of the argument if it had been brought up in general conversation. I\'m sure
that there are better arguments, but this doesn\'t strike me as one. (But, then
perhaps I\'m just being obtuse ... always possible! :-})

Agreed! However, is it *work* in the sense that people will *have* to do it?
I rather like Mack Reynold\'s works, where the majority of the population live
on a *very* nice version of the Dole. Sure, a lot of them *do* other artsy-
craftsy things, even research and the like, but they aren\'t actually *employed*
doing them. They *could* be, as it is obvious from internal evidence that the
people who *are* employed work something like a "normal" late 20th century
work week ... but in that particular version of a future the workers have
chosen not to allow that to happen. A typically american-ocentric view of the
world and the way it will develop!

Yes, and much of what they do will not be "work" ... if you define work as
being something they *have* to do to earn a living. Much of it will be what
we would call "leisure" today.

Which makes the price of things in all versions of Traveller even *more*
ridiculously inflated than they were when it was generally understood that
1 Cr was approximately equal to 1.5 - 2 US$. Even so, in TNE terms, starship
crews are *criminally* underpaid based on their likely savings, considering
that this must also include consumer durables that they have purchased as well
as cash put away.

Any chance of re-publishing it here ? Challenge wasn\'t a big seller here in New
Zealand, and was consequently very hard to get hold of.

Your MoJ sounds very similar to what I was trying to achieve with my "Criminal
Intelligence Office ( CIO ) => like the FBI - investigates crimes and threats".

Since MoJ exists as a published organisation, do you mind if I adopt that as the
parent body of the CIO ( or does a similar investigative body under the MoJ
already exist under another name ) ?  It sounds like a much more "fleshed out"
entity anyway, and I like the concept of a Ministry ( this is an Imperium after
all ). The conection between the Imperial Court and its investigative arm makes
more sense when they come under the same minister. Which begs the question : why
not have a Ministry of Internal Security (MIS) to which IBIS belongs ?

Any thoughts ?

And to Peter L. Berghold :

You could always forget the engine.  The escape pod isn\'t going to be able
to carry enough fuel to counter any but the weakest of gravities anyway
(let alone make it back to orbit), so you may as well just use explosives
(mounted in the docking collar) to blast the escape pod away from the
crippled ship.  If it does carry that amount of fuel, then you may as well
call it a Launch/Ship\'s Boat and be done with it.

Add a contra-grav unit and Bob\'s your uncle - a safe landing.  Clever use
of a contra-grav unit can not only allow a pod to land, but can determine
*where* it lands (by manipulating contra-grav output during approach and
atmospheric descent) and whether or not it\'s going to land *at all* (unless
the escape pod was launched directly *at* a planet, countering 99% of the
gravity makes it pretty easy to avoid bodies that you don\'t really want to
land on, such as gas giants, barren moons, and stars).

If you are happy to toss the conventional approach out of the window and
just include a Power Plant, Life Support, Sensors and a Contra-Grav device,
I\'m pretty sure your escape pod will be able to recover from almost any
situation you care to mention (avoiding landing in the majority of cases,
but having controlled, safe landings when forced (or desirable) to do so).

Another thing - don\'t make it round.  Make it shaped like a cut diamond
(the same shape virtually all re-entry craft used to be, pre-shuttle).
More re-entry friendly than a balloon.

Someone already suggested the beefed up nuclear damper as a dis-
integrator. A second option is a super-particle accelerator firing
Bosons or Magnetic Monopoles, either of which (based on my very sketchy
knowledge of the subject) will induce proton decay when they strike a
target. I\'d imagine that information on the energy levels needed to
create these exotic particles ought to be available in particle physics
textbooks.

Isn\'t that TL17+ for MAMA power plants ? However, if one were to assume
that TL17+ J-Drives used anti-matter fuel, it would seem reasonable to
expect that a TL15/16 J-Drive using a fusion plant ought to be much more
efficient than a TL14- one, both in terms of drive volume and fuel use.
Now, David Golden suggested (in line with FFS) that the hydrogen could
be argued to be coolant, but the same argument applies, higher PP
efficiency means less coolant required, et cetera. Anyway coolant
wouldn\'t be consumed as J-Fuel is. What is displacement mass (FFS again)
anyway ?
And since 35% of the J-Drive by volume is HPGs, again more efficient at
higher TL, this would argue for improvements in drive volume by TL.
Aargh, another can of worms !
IIRC, MT suggested that fuel usage for J-Drives went down at TL17+ (4x
volume at TL17, 3x, 2x, 1x, 0.5x etc). But they still used hydrogen
fuel.
And isn\'t it amazing that <<super-accurate>> FFS has no scale
efficiencies whatsoever, whereas klunky old MT did have. Not to mention
the fact that I can buy TL13ish batteries by post. Gripe, gripe. I think
I might be turning into Phil McGregor *-).

I think you\'re looking at it much too simplisticly, looking only at
the technological end while many other factors were also at play.
For instance, the increase in the standard of living only goes to those
who recieve the benefits of the productivity gain. In most cases,
that will be the owners. However, that leaves a few owners a lot
richer and the general work force still with the same standard they
had before. Historically, it\'s been political and economic pressure
brought about by labor unions and other organizations (some churches,
etc.), plus the threat of a more radical spectre (usually communism),
to get them to "share the wealth".

So the actual formula is not just technology.
Tech defines what is THEORETICALLY POSSIBLE,
but that will then be apportioned by various social factors, who
will only follow your linear progression in some cases, not all, and
(IMO) not most.

This is close to the lowest pay-grade aboard starships. Officers will be
better off by several times, lower grades will be better by
a few times 10%.

True, Air/rafts are a little too common to be worth 15 years\' salary.

Again, great wealth does not directly translate into a better standard
of living for all.

Or they could be living in street gutters, shantytowns, and clapboard
hovels, begging, doing service work for cheaper than the machines
can (which, we agree, is pretty low), and engaged in less savory
"service industries".

No economic direct connection. The World Generation gives a tech boost
to 5- and 9+ population levels, but that tends to assume a few things
that are not neccessarily true.

Yes, but you _can\'t_ assume that just because this makes sense
it will be made policy or somehow naturally flow from the technology.

I\'m not kidding, this is a long article. If it offends anyone\'s dearly
held beliefs, good. A bit controversy never hurt. Well, not unless
you\'re on one of those kooky law level zero worlds when it might result
in a few thousand fatalities, decades of mayhem and the destruction of
planetary civilization or whatever passed for it.

I can recollect reading several articles in JTAS/TD/Challenge over the
years about law and policing in the Imperium and now I\'ve seen some bits
and bobs on the TML. Regrettably none of the foregoing have struck me as
remotely plausible. The Third Imperium was the ultimate in laissez-faire
governments where planets could wage bloody civil wars; oppress all,
some or none of the people on political, racist or religious grounds;
whatever, the Imperium never cared, just so long as the credits kept
rolling in and the railways (sorry, X-Boat routes) ran on time.

Now, we are asked to believe that an Imperial Government content to
allow and ofttimes support extremely nasty dictatorships, anti-alien
pogroms and assorted other unpleasantness would be concerned about
little events (on a relative scale) like murder and rape. Not a hope
unless the victim is an Imperial somebody, which is to say Noble, or a
member of the Imperial military or bureaucracy or someone with a great
deal of political influence or cold hard cash.  If the Imperial Govern-
ment acquiesced in the Government of Endup it certainly didn\'t give a
damn about the little people anywhere else in the Empire.

And just think for a moment on the difficulties of even defining murder,
a regularly suggested example of the sort of crime which IMoJ might be
concerned with, in such a variegated culture as the Imperium. The laws
of planet A say that abortion is murder; planet B has a tradition of
compulsory euthanasia; planet C holds that dueling is an entirely
acceptable way to solve arguments; a government on planet D considers
Droyne/Vargr/whoever to be unpersons and allows citizen to shoot them on
sight; planet E looks kindly on the crime passionelle &c. What is murder
on one world may not even be a crime of any sort on another. [E.G. a
Texan kook shot one of my fellow countrymen a couple of years ago in
circumstances which would probably have gotten said gun-fetishist a life
sentence here, yet he got off without even a slapped wrist]. What is
lawful on one world might be entirely unacceptable on others. [E.G. The
British Government introduced retroactive legislation some years back
allowing the trial of WWII war criminals, something that the US supreme
court would kick out in ten seconds. E.G. Trial by jury is completely
unknown in most countries, and so on ad infinitum on one poxy little
balkanised TL8 world]. Were the Imperium to attempt to define the
meaning of murder as a criminal act it would be all but impossible, and
this applies equally to the Late-C20th-Middle-Class-US-centric lists of
other crimes that are usually presented for our edification in this
regard.

As well as these practical difficulties in defining crimes such as
murder, and the actively disinterested nature of Imperial Government,
consider the cultural nature of the Empire. While the majority of
contributors to this list are relatively wealthy Euros (by descent),
such people are a certainly minuscule fraction of an Empire dominated by
Solomani of overwhelmingly non-1st World origin, reactionary Vilani and
assorted minor and alien races. The personal views held by the average
poster to this list are probably a very poor guide indeed to the views
of the average Imperial, just as they would be a poor guide to the views
of the average inhabitant of the Earth. After all, the Empire is no more
Yanks in Space than 2300 was  - albeit that every 2300 article and
scenario ever written seemed to deal with the irritating Colonials and
much Traveller material is written as if the Empire were run by 57th
Century versions of 20th Century inhabitants of Eerie, Indiana or
Normal, Illinois, usually the former. I guess that average Tsolyani (*)
would be as incomprehensible to us as the Imperials would be. Arguments
for the Yanks in Space zeitgeist on the basis of the Americanization of
Earth via Hollywood culture are easily demolished by the case of
supposedly Americanized Japan, which is as just as alien as anywhere
else.

So, in view of all this, if the <<brownshirt zampolit thugs>> of IMoJ
were unconcerned with murders - unless of Nobles or Imperial officials -
and like crimes, what did they actually do ? For the Imperial Govern-
ment, the continuance of the Imperial Government and it\'s trappings
appears to have been the major - if not indeed only concern of the
apparatus of state, a classical self-perpetuating military regime with
the Zhunastu\'s and their successors as a long series of hereditary
Maximum Leaders. So IMoJ were most likely not an interstellar FBI/
Interpol dedicated to fighting crime, they would be closer to an inter-
stellar Gestapo dedicated to stamping out treason, sedition, forged
credits and sundry other crimes against the state (as defined by the
just and merciful Imperial Government of course), together with the very
occasional bit of real police work

Now, you could argue that Lucan\'s IMoJ and Dulinor\'s equivalent were not
representative of the organisation in the Good Old Days. And you might
be right, although J. Edgar Hoover\'s FBI was busy ruining the lives of
so-called subversives at around the same time that it was being publicly
lauded as a great crime fighting organisation, and this in a supposed
democracy. So, how much worse could one expect even from a generally
well-intentioned bunch of secret policeman, in an unrepresentative,
unaccountable autocracy like the Imperium ?

If you want to know what IMoJ was really like, don\'t look at Imperial
propaganda (which is to say almost everything ever published for
Traveller). After all, the Nazis would present the downright evil
Gestapo as a tough but fair and necessary force to track down enemies of
the people, so with the Imperium and the reptilian IMoJ. Since IMoJ
fulfilled the same role in the Imperium that SolSec did in the Solomani
Confederation, read what the Empire\'s propaganda machine had to say
about SolSec - secret agents, omnipresent sneaking informers, murder
squads, overthrowing uncooperative governments, and other assorted
nastiness. Now you know how the Imperial Ministry of Justice worked in
practice.

So, if criminal characters don\'t have to fear IMoJ (unless they are
would-be rebels or have done something to upset the Imperial apple cart
or someone with real political clout), who is going to bring them to
justice for robbing the unimportant and influence-free First Planetary
Bank of Hornswoggle ? [If it was owned by Hortalez IMoJ would be on the
trail right away]. Well, if the Government doesn\'t supply justice, it\'s
going to be a job for private enterprise. After all, you can\'t always
rely on extradition treaties between governments on one world, let alone
on different ones.

Instead of having to high tail it out of the system one step ahead of
the police, it\'ll be bounty hunters on their trail instead. (Hell, it
gets more like the Wild West every day - more bloody Yanks in Space !).
And while the police might exercise some restraint in catching
criminals, Bounty Hunters Unlimited will be more concerned about it\'s
bottom line than any putative rights the perps might think they should
have. Now isn\'t that a lot less fun for the characters than being chased
by the local version of the Keystone Cops ? And those who have offended
the powerful and face the power of IMoJ and the armed forces sont vrai-
ment dans la merde jusqu\'aux les oreilles, les pauvres gars.

The IISS-SB appear to be of limited interest (and utility) and smacks
more of letting Scout characters play spooks than anything else. IRIS we
should ignore as a very unfortunate mistake. Their appearance puzzled me
as much as it puzzled Strephon (and I\'ve got the relevant issues of
Challenge with the word variant at the top of those pages !). Other
branches of the Imperial Government might have some form of
investigative branch, especially the revenue-raising arm of the state
since the Imperial machine won\'t run without hard cash - pas d\'argent,
pas de Suisses. It doesn\'t seem really likely that the Imperial Revenue
Service will wheel out it\'s Arakoine class strike cruisers to collect
taxes from non-paying planets, but no doubt they will have some spook or
police-like arm. So, the characters may have to flee someday from a
relentless pursuit by armed agents of the IRS over unpayed taxes on that
big lottery win.

Before the Plummerite pro-Imperial faction wades in to tell me what a
lot of rubbish the above is, and how the Third Imperium was a warm,
fuzzy, loving totalitarian dictatorship, please explain why all those
despicable governments - Junidy, Vanejen, Endup, Lintl, Pavabid and
many, many others - were allowed to remain in power when the Imperial
forces could readily have removed them with minimal fuss. Remind me how
often the people were consulted on Imperial policy, how they weren\'t
treated like lab rats in grandiose psychohistorical experiments,
needlessly geneered into weird and useless forms, et cetera.

Even Norris\'s Regency is a state driven by political expediency and the
love of the status quo, since the Regency Marines could have extermin-
ated any and all forces at the disposal of the Ward of Vision in fifteen
minutes flat, thus liberating Endup/Lucifer without untold deaths and
years of unneeded suffering. Partisans of the Regency as a democratic
government have a good deal of furious rationalization to do. Dupes of
Imperial and Regency propaganda, now\'s your chance to recognise the
truth !

I think you have hit the nail on the head.  Even the Empire our own parts of
the world were so recently part of never had much in the way of uniform,
wide reaching, fairly administered justice  -- and sometimes they even tried to.

My bet on the "operative" part of the imperial ministry of justice is that
its priories are:

1. Piracy.  This is very bad for business, intereferes with tax collection,
and messes up the xboat schedules. Got to keep a tight reign on that.

2. Sedition.  Probably somewhat KBGish, but without the manpower to do
really effective job of it.

3. Really serious crimes -- Translation: doing something to an imperial
noble that the right honorable worthy does not like very much at all.

The indirect administration the empire conducts reminds me rather more of
India before the Raj (of course, look what happened there) or US/USSR
neo-colonialism in the 1960\'s.

There would probably be a sort of starport police, with a mandate much like
Canadian Railway or National Harbours Board Police (which is actually quite
extensive, especially CPR police in Western Canada: do other counties have
the same sort of thing?) -- basic law enforcement inside the spaceport fence
(and power of arrest as far outside as they can negotiate with the local
authorities.)

I expect that high law level worlds with similar government\'s would have
recipricol agreements on arrest and extradition, and might even form
subsector-sized "interpol"-like organizations.

Now is the operative law on a starship:

1. The law of the planet of registry
2. The law of the planet of departure
3. The law of the first planetfall
4. Some other imperial law
5. Whatever the captain thinks he can get away with?

I would guess 4 (drifting toward 5), simply because starships tend never to
leave imperial jurisdiction, but its an interesting question.

I would imagine that starship laws would be somewhat like maritime
laws--that is a cross between planet/country of registry and the cosmic
equivalent of the airspace within which the starship currently resides.
This would make the most sense----a ship in orbit would be subject to laws
of the planet it orbits (in addition to any restrictions of its
commission).  And if you happen to fly from the Imperium/Regency/RC/etc.
into neighboring <fill in the alien race> space then that starship would
be subject to those laws----the only (diplomatic) recourse of the nation
trying to recover an offending ship in foreign "waters" would be via
extradition.

The fact that one can force an iris with bare hands suggests that valves\'
plates overlap slightly.  I propose a tool to facilitate forcing iris
valves.  I would for historical reasons call it "the jaws of life."

The jaws of life works as follows:  One jaw is placed against an
overlapping plate.  The other is placed against the inside of the
concentric ring.  By means of a lever, the first jaw is pushed against the
overlapping plate until it is forced back.

The lever can also be motorized.

The jaws of life is commonly carried by rescue teams and boarding parties.
Starships normally carry several with their fire-fighting gear.  The jaws
of life is manufactured by many companies at various tech levels.  Ling
Standard Products\' non-motorized TL 9 version retails for about Cr100;
motorized for Cr750.

In MT game terms, use of the jaws of life makes the task roll one level

Hello!

I have these questions about Traveller universe : what does jumpspace
look like? I mean, if a viewport is "open", so that you can look through
it, what do you see? Black? "Normal" space? Swirling colours?

Another: Can hatches be opened in jumpspace? In other words, is EVA possible?

anwfh@acad2.alaska.edu (William F. Hostman) proposed a means by which early
T-Plates could work while conserving momentum. I would say that even without
such an explanation, many of the phenomenon of Traveller could be explained
by areas of science as yet unknown or barely understood, e.g. the concept
that there\'s a lot of energy out there just waiting to be tapped as Zero
Point Energy. Anyone know anything about this stuff? It\'s sort of been
linked to cold fusion and high-frequency electromagnetic effects...

POLICE

Simon provided a nice analysis of the requirements for an Imperial Police force.

I would suggest however, that perhaps rather than:
>And the Scout Service is more likely to be spending its budget spying on the
>Zhodani, Vargr, and other EXternal threats than wasting its time looking for
>"reds under the bed" so to speak. In other words, I believe that the Scouts

>a externally directed organisation...
perhaps one should consider that the Scouts are the ones who have the
greatest feel for the development of a world and are usually concerned with
watching over new worlds for decades if not centuries. They would therefore
be ideally placed (if not required) to have a significant force dedicated to
the manipulation and control of planetary evolution, which will typically be
achieved through the planetary governments, by ensuring that the right
people get into power and that their "good" works (whatever that means in an
Imperial sense) are not ruined by terrorists, coups, etc. Certainly, in my
games, the Scout Corp has a very extensive but secretive role in the
development of almost all worlds. And once they\'ve got their foot in the
door, why shouldn\'t the Emperor (or whoever\'s running the Regency, etc.)
continue to use them to watch and/or manipulate the later governments?

Clearly though, they would only be interested in fairly major crimes which
could upset their "plan" for a world. There is still a requirement for a
more general inter-system law enforcement bureau.

WORKING 9 TO 5 (Sing-along-with-Andy)

Phillip McGregor suggests that by TL14/15 people will be working 9 hour
weeks (or somesuch). Hmmm... most of the productivity increases have
occurred in the last 20-30 years but has anyone noticed the way current
management policy has adapted, i.e. make the workforce work the same hours
to produce MORE goods so the managers can get paid more for giving greater
share dividends to their share-holders...

Re the poverty line, I think one needs to remember that the TNE book is
based upon a collapsed society, i.e. it is almost totally RC-oriented.
Figures probably ought to be adjusted upward for a society such as the
Regency where money still has a much greater usage (in the RC I envisage
high tech goods being a more solid bartering medium than cash).

Chris Lloyd <cdl@delcam.com> asks
>I\'m trying to find out how accuratly the artificial gravity on a ship
>can be controlled.

In my games, the G field is anywhere from zero to about 1.5g, this being the
range likely to be found on planets the ships will visit (i.e. suitable for
almost any life form they will meet). There is no reason for higher g forces
unless specifically designed in as a defence measure, etc. The g field is in
addition to any other accelerations acting on crew, so although there is
usually assumed to be some form of 1g-ish acceleration compensation field
(to prevent everyone \'falling\' to the back of the ship), higher
accelerations may outweigh both the compensation field and the floor
gravity. (The floor g is generally fixed, whereas the compensation varies
automatically with manoeuvre drive acceleration). Given the way g fields
vary with range, you cannot easily have small localised effects (e.g.
lifting a single person off their feet). Similarly, unless the walls are
particularly thick, the gravity field in one room may stretch a little into
the surrounding rooms, so you don\'t want huge disparities in g between
rooms. You don\'t need 6g plates in walls to throw intruders down long
corridors, just turning the gravity on and off every few seconds will be
quite sufficient to prevent effective action by an intruder, while the crew
stand some way off in a stable gravity area and pepper the intruders with
whatever artillery they have to hand...

>This does leave some questions as to why hyjacking is a problem if you
>can just throw them down a side corridor at 6g...

Hijacking is almost impossible anyway if the ship is sensibly equipped with
cameras, good locks, solid bulkheads and doors, etc. Just open the nearest
air lock... ok they might be in vacc suits, but if they haven\'t secured
themselves then they\'ll get blown out anyway. Hijacking is _very_ difficult.

Please note that this is 227 light-days. Or a bit over 6/10ths of a
light year! That\'s a pretty extreme distance regardless of which set of
rules you use.

In CT, at a *steady* 6g, (accelerate to midpoint, flip over and
decelerate until arrival) it\'d take 115 days. But that\'s ignoring
Einstein. Note that 6g for 59 days would have you at light-speed if it
wasn\'t for Einstein. So a trip that far at 6g will be *strongly*
influenced by relativity!

50 G-hours will get you up to 1.8e6 km/sec. The amount of distance you
cover while accelerating depends on what acceleration you are using.

At that speed, you\'ll cover the distance in 3.3e9 seconds, 5.6e9 min,
9.3e5 hours, 3.9e4 days, or 106 years.

Not really. You picked *the* most extreme case possible.

Let\'s try something a bit more reasonable.

1 AU = 1.5e11 m (approx)

(figures below are from a modified Bode\'s law calc, so they aren\'t
accurate to more than a couple of places...)

Mercury  0.4 AU
Venus    0.7 AU
Earth 1.0 AU
Mars 1.6 AU
* 2.8 AU
Jupiter  5.2 AU
Saturn  10.0 AU
Uranus  19.6 AU
Neptune 29.2 AU
Pluto   38.8 AU

So, from Earth to Jupiter is anytyhing from 4.2 AU to 6.2 AU, ignoring
the fact that course lines *aren\'t* straight.

So, A typical trip would be from Jupiter to Earth (nearest GG to mainworld).
Assume worst case distances. (all numbers shown to only 2 significant
figures)
6.2 * 1.5e11 = 9.3e11
We want half that distance for the constant boost case.
4.7e11
d=a*t^2/2, so at 6 g....
4.7e11=(6*9.8)*t^2/2
9.3e11=5.9e1*t^2
1.6e10=t^2
1.3e5=t

So at constant 6 g boost, it\'ll take 1.3e5 seconds to get to the
turnover point, or 2.5e5 for the whole trip. That\'s 2.9 days. And the
max speed (at turnover) is 7.4e6 m/sec or 7,400 km/sec. So that\'s what
Classic Traveller says.

Now, with the 50 g-hour fuel limit we\'ll use *half* of it to accel and
half for decel. And we\'ll figure on 6 g.
25 G hours gives a speed of: 8.8e5 m/sec or 880 km/sec
That\'s less than 1/8th the speed for the CT ship.
At 6g you burn 25 G-hours in 4.2 hours, or 1.5e4 seconds. So from start
to end of the burn, we cover 6.6e9 meters. Ditto for the decel burn at
the other end. That leaves 9.2e11 meters to cover while coasting at
8.8e5 m/sec. So we coast for about 1 million seconds. Giving a total
trip time of a bit over 14 days.
And it gets worse the farther out you go.

BTW, assuming a fusion drive with an ISP of 6e5 for the CT ship, I get
fuel usage of about 500 tons for a 200 ton ship. :-)

Gee... That kinda screws that up doesn\'t it?

Reaction mass usage in the *real* world is directly dependent of
exhaust velocity, and thrust. Period.

Ev = thrust/fuel consumption.

therefore:

Fuel consumption = thrust/exhaust velocity.

If thrust is in metric tons, and exhaust velocity is in meters per
second, then fuel consumption will be in tons per second. Or you could
even use displacement tons for both.

Well, at the first moment, it sounds strange, but it might be enough...

In fact, if you add a social ability, let\'s say Soul, you have the three
basic characteristics of Forgotten Futures. FF works very well with these
three abilities and if that system does, why not Traveller? FF is a very
simple and easy system but that\'s no disadvantage in my opinion.

However, for my own SF rules, I split each characteristic in two
sub-characteristics, feeling a little unconfortable with only 3 abilities.

Body and Speed (or Quickness) are the physical abilities. Body covers
strength and endurance. Quickness covers agility and physical dexterity.
Manual dexterity isn\'t covered by a basic abilitiy but will be a consequnce
of skills. Body defines wound capacity and melee combat. Quickness is also a
combat (especially missle and gun combat) related ability and needed for
quick reaction tests.

Intelligence and Awareness (or Perception) are the mental skills. Especially
awareness is useful for all kind of oberservation and perception tests.
Intelligence is a base value for most skills.

Charisma and Willpower are my social skills. Charisma is the persons effect
to other persons. Willpower defines mental endurance and the ability to have
one\'s way. Strong personalities aren\'t as effected by psi as weak ones.

I think, I could live with only 3 stats. You can\'t describe a person by
using some numbers. It the aditional description that gives a person some
characteristics.  The numbers are only needed for the rules - that is
combat, health and task resolution. A physical stat will handle combat and
health. Physical, Mental and Social stats will define base values for all
kind of skills.

If I remember correctly (my copy of FF&S isn\'t here at the moment) it
is stated that the ships artificial gravity is used to counter its
acceleration, up to 6Gs on TL15 ships.  I would have thought this
could simply be reoriented to which ever direction was desired.

It has also been mentioned to me that a ship design turned up in an
adventure somewhere, for a bounty hunter type ship.  In the area
around the ship\'s brig the gravity could be turned up to 6G to prevent
breakouts.  This is only second hand information so I could also be
wrong on this point as well...

To apply a constant direction across a spinning ship, could result in
some drastic changes in vector, within a room, particularly a large
room.  Consider a bridge in a coaxial position, if the ship rotates
about this axis, the applied extra gravity has to be \'down\' on one
side, and \'up\' on the other (modified towards the midpoint for
centripetal force)...

Yes, but there are consequences if the wealth is *not* shared. Consequences
that cannot be ignored ... remember the "let them eat cake" incident? I\'m
sure Marie Antoinette\'s spriritual heirs do! Without trying deliberately to
tread on any toes here, I recently heard a very interesting argument from
an American historian (or was it an economist ... or an economic historian?
I don\'t have the source handy) who argued that the US was working itself into
big trouble because its ruling class (and he included the wealthy as well as
the powerful in this category) had convinced themselves that they were "just
folks", and that they had no special responsibilities towards those they rule.
That is, "I\'ve got a million $ through \'hard work\' (inherited most of it or
otherwise was \'assisted\' by elective office or the \'old boys network\') so why
should *I* pay taxes to support welfare recipients ... they\'re obviously lazy
bums who could make a million *if* they\'d only try" (vastly simplifying things
of course!) ... and forgetting something that he suggested European ruling
classes seem not to have (and he included ruling classes of primarily european
ex-colonies like Canada, Oz and Kiwiland), the idea of "noblesse oblige". In
other word, you get all the bennies of being top dog, but there\'s a price to
pay ... call it charity, call it unemployment benefits, call it socialism; it
doesn\'t matter, as long as you take care of the mythical "ordinary man".

His argument seemed to be that a Cyberpunk style dark future is only possible
in the US or in those countries that seem hell bent on adopting US attitudes
in this area ... such as Thatcherite (and Majorite) Britain. Now, I know that
even Democratic politics is, *in Oz terms*, further to the right than Attila
the Hun, but why assume that the whole of the future is going to be an exact
clone of late 20th century America? Sure, undoubtedly some planets will pursue
such a course ... but others will pursue different ones, ones more (to use a
word the US Media tells us *all* good citizens equate with baby killing and
not liking mom\'s apple pie) "liberal" (or, *shock* *horror* ... *socialist* ...
in the european rather than Russian/Chinese sense). And I would suggest that
the Reaganite/Thatcherite vision of the future is likely to be less stable
than any other (which is *not* suggesting that the alternatives will be
stable ... merely relatively more so)! This is, of course, personal opinion
only, though there are facts that support it ... no doubt there are facts that
argue against it!

Of course you are correct. I am assuming that the ruling classes, whether
democratic, oligarchic, autocratic or dictatorial or whatever, will have some
desire to survive ... and creating a semi-permanent underclass is *not* the
way to do it in the long term. Especially not in an interstellar society.
*UNLESS* you are prepared to propose some pretty dramatic *and* drastic
differences between your proposed tiny ruling class/huge underclass society
and the rest of the Imperium. This, of course, could well be done (though I
don\'t think it would be stable ... PCs just *love* overthrowing such
abominations!), but would be the exception rather than the rule. You would
also have to explain *why* the tiny ruling class *needs* the huge underclass.
It would be much simpler to put birth control chemicals in their slop and
water and keep on a minimal number on hand to be servants.

Yes, but nowhere in TNE is this stated. Yes, we can guess this from stuff in
MTRav and CTrav, but not from anything in TNE. *Another* annoying oversight!

Yes, but if it doesn\'t, you have to explain *why* it doesn\'t. While the
Imperium is *not* a democracy, I do not believe that there is any evidence
that the sort of repressive government you are proposing exists any more
frequently there than it does on Terra here and now.

Yes, they *could* be, but you have to explain *why* ... and how they are being
kept in line. You could suggest something such as Mack Reynolds used in his
future history of Westworld vs. Sovworld; or you could use the CoDominium of
Jerry Pournelle. Of course, in both instances there are forces within that
are working to destroy and overthrow the system ... inevitable. There simply
is no real reason for a large underclass ... simply breed them out of existence
(read some of F.M. Busby\'s "Rissa and Tregare" books for a truly horrifying
society that attempts to do just that ... and fails because of rebels that
are nourished within its own ranks!).

All too true, but we *can* assume that if it *isn\'t* the case the society in
question will *not* be a very nice one at all ... great for local colour, but
*not* one the PCs will want to have much to do with ... except for supporting
the inevitable local "underground" in fighting the oppression of the tiny
ruling classes.

More likely the former or a something more on that side of it than the "some-

short lived and self-limiting!

Spoken with the lust of a true Solomani.  Like all others of your breed
<sneer> you verbally attack our benevolent Empire.  You attempt to lower us
to your inferior Solomani filth with your evil propaganda.  Your words will
not go without being heard, this is a free-speech forum.  You will likely
find any true Imperial subjects to buy your Solomani Bag of Lies.

Admit the truth, you Solomani are jealous of the glorious Imperium.  You
pathetic "Rule of Man" did nothing to help advancements in our universe, in
fact you virtually caused the Long Night.  You can\'t deal with the fact that
Imperial ways are better than your Solomani ways.  And we proved it when we
conquered Terra and defeated your foolish government.

The rock may accelletate at a slower rate however on the moon it will
never reach terminal velocity, as there is no reactive force against
the object (i.e. atmosphere)

Unless the object has thruster to slow it down it will continue to accelerate
until the force of the atmosphere against the object matches that of the
gravity provided by the planet the object is landing on. Once it reaches
terminal velocity it will continue to heat up as it passes through atmosphere
thus if it has any open area, (exposed antenna, etc) these could get damaged
during decent

As you also mention does it have the Landing gear and equipment to have a safe
landing, all of these make it simple to believe that some that has the
flight characteristics of an Oil tanker might find it hard to land on a
planet

If we\'re going to move on to intelligence services, which really should have
nothing to do with law enforcement, we know of some more organizations.

On the military side, we have Imperial Naval Intelligence (INI) to gather naval
intel, and Imperial Naval Counter-Intelligence (INCI) to stop the enemy from
returning the favor.  There\'s also Imperial Army Intelligence (IAI).  Their
purposes should be fairly clear.  During the 5FW in the Marches there was also
an "Office of Naval Information" founded by SADM Santanocheev, abolished by
Duke Norris, which was less than competent and did the same thing as INI.

On the civilian side, there\'s the Imperial Intelligence Agency (IIA) usually
known as Imperial Intelligence, and possibly the same as Combined Imperial
Intelligence (from _Flaming Eye_, _Argon Gambit_, and _Survival Margin_
respectively).  The IISS Intelligence Branch operates out of the Detached
Duty Office.  They have covert operatives, but get most of their intelligence
from the collection of logbooks from detached duty Scout/Couriers when they
visit scout bases for service.  (I consider IISS personnel to be civil
servants, not soldiers, although they can get pressed into service in time
of war, like the people who operate subsidized merchants.)  There\'s also some
rumors about top secret covert groups operating under Imperial Warrant
authority in the IISS, but as far as I\'m concerned they\'re only that.
Finally, there\'s a TNS reference to the Ministry of Information, which we
know nothing about.

Actually, I don\'t see it this way.  We know that MoJ has special investigators,
from TNS.  We know they oversee the prisons, from _Kinunir_.  But at least in
my view they shouldn\'t be running the courts.  The courts should be appointed
by the Emperor based on the recommendations of the regional nobility standing
in representation of their worlds.  The Emperor can ignore them of course, but
only at political peril -- there are ways that the nobility can resist the whim
of an emperor.  I\'d rather not see the Imperial courts of law run by the MoJ.

Despite the flaws I see in the bizarre mating of the Vilani caste system and
the structure of the Terran Confederation that we call the Imperium, I\'d like
to have it set up to function as honestly as we can.  I don\'t buy that a strong
feudal confederation is the only way to go -- the Solomani and Zhodani forms of
government show that a truly democratic interstellar confederation of large size
is certainly possible, even if neither fully fits that description itself.  But
the Imperium does need to work well enough that people are willing to believe
in it and fight for it for a millenium.

The Imperium has to enforce at least a few basic laws, or nobody will feel safe
stepping on a starship.  The wide-open merit-based nature of the Imperial civil
service will probably also have an effect on the system.  The bureaucracy will
include sophonts of all races, sexes, and cultures in the Imperium, and this
may help make things more honest.

I think Angus has hit on something important here, though.  The key reason that
Archduke Dulinor rebelled in 1116 was that he felt the Imperium wasn\'t doing
enough to live up to its\' high ideals.  In a sense, it was the failure of the
Imperium to deal effectively with worlds like Endup and the failure of the Moot
to consider the possibility of a Vargr archduke becoming a Vargr emperor that
show that Dulinor had a point, and that brought on the Rebellion.

A couple of people have recently put forth the opinion that
hijacking a ship would be difficult because the crew could throw hijackers
around with grav fields, blast them out airlocks, etc.  I don\'t think
hijacking would be that difficult, you just have to do what hijackers have
always done: take hostages.  If the hijackers are in a room with guns
pointed at the heads of passengers, you can\'t throw the bad guys around
without hurting innocents.  Also, hijackers would rely on rapid attacks.
Two hijackers could simultaneously enter the bridge and engineering
compartments with a some explosives and before anyone could say "hey what are
you doing in here?!" the crew would be too mangled to do much.  Of
course, depending on level of security, it might be difficult to get into
these compartments (not to mention getting explosives aboard), but I think
a simple ruse could get you in on most sub merchants and such.

"The world of the future will be an ever more demanding struggle against the
limitations of our intelligence, not a comfortable hammock in which we can
lie down to be waited upon by our robot slaves." - Norbert Wiener

It seemed somehow appropriate. Anecdotally, I haven\'t seen a decrease in the
average work week here in the USA. We in the software biz are continually
being squeezed by spiraling demands; something that a customer would have
been ecstatic to have in a month 10 years ago can now be done in two weeks.
The client, however, demands it in a week. Thus, the demands of consumers
always outstrips the ability of suppliers. Thus, everybody works a lot of
hours to make deadlines.

I personally think that this would be less of a problem if barriers were in
place that limited the speed of distribution for goods and services (e.g.
Traveller, all eras). In the Traveller universe, you can\'t demand *anything*
from another planet in less than a week, and usually that is very
optimistic. This means that suppliers have a larger "window" to get their
goods to market, and that demand has an inelastic "floor" for some goods.
This, to me, implies that Phil may be onto something, Mr. Wiener
notwithstanding. I don\'t think that 9 hours a week is reachable except for
some areas of industry (those that export to off-plant consumers more than
jump-1 or so away), but it makes sense to me that the less "planetary" and
the more "inter-planetary" your products are, the shorter the work week for
your employees. This is all off the top of my head, but maybe it makes a
little sense.

Actually, I created these guys to *be* my checks and balances in my campaign
as well as provide a vehicle for adventures as patrons and occasionaly
opponents.  They were *never* PCs always NPCs.

As far as them being Gestapo or KGB.  No, more like a souped up FBI with
military intel (I know an oximoron) thrown in for good measure as well as
Green Berets. They are recruited from elite military units and the washout
rate is real high. They must be capable of operating totaly independant and
must be able to maintain a cover for long periods of time.  In fact,
historicly about 30% of them never get activated and retire.

Some PCs in my campaign  that got too good at being pirates found themselves
on the wrong end of a commando raid that was lead by one of these guys.

I have to admit (although being pro-Imperial myself), there are aspects of the
Third Imperium that are - shall we say - not very nice. The very fact that
assassination was seen as a legitimate path to the throne demonstrates this
fact. Indeed, ANY large organisation has its good and bad points (as Angus
showed thru eg\'s of our history).

The IMoJ is a good place to put those "bad elements" into a good story. Every
story needs a villian (my campaign uses Tukera ;-), and certain extra-legal
organisations can do the trick in the Imperium. As Angus noted, the Imperium
made many decisions of expediency; the main glue holding the place together
was that the Imperium is a _trade protectorate_. The primary High Justice
crimes are crimes against the *state* - all the stuff about "murder in Imperial
space is a crime" is really tacked on at the end. You can view this as a way of
preventing interstellar incidents (murder another planet\'s citizens while in
space and there will be hell to pay). It certainly was never intended to prevent
things which occur on a planet\'s surface - these are under the jurisdiction of
the planetary government.

(I was going to add some more scintillating dialogue but I\'ve got to go!).

Use the MoJ as the "bad guys" of the 3rd Imp govt.

The following are exerpts from my article "Imperial Law" from Challenge 50.
It has been trimmed for two reasons; one, it was fairly long to start
with, and two, GDW has the copyright on this one, so I\'m making what I
believe to be fair use of excerpts of it.  It is still fairly long.
I appologize for that...

Remember, previous GDW statements indicate that Challenge material
is not necessarily 100% canon.  However, the majority of such material
has been treated as such, so it is probably safe to say that this is
the legal environment in the Third Imperium (right up to the middle
of the Civil War, basically... then things fell apart).

The various rights are mostly important in that they frame the structure
of the enforcement activities by the Imperium.  Local worlds have been known
to infringe on these.

The "usually" above refers to during normal investegations and the like.
This isn\'t a law or even formal MOJ procedure except as the MOJ wants its
agents not to stand out like a sore thumb.  Every MOJ office usually has
an armory with (fill in the hi-tech-high-lethality-weapons-and-armor)
available in enough quantity for the local MOJ force to deal with an
equal number of rabid player characters.  Yes, that includes antiarmor
and antiaircraft missiles, heavy crew served weapons, etc. in offices
large enough to have enough people to be able to use them.  The MOJ sometimes
deals with *mean* people, and they don\'t have High Justice Arrest Teams
lying around on every world.  If possible, they\'ll use the Marines or
local military to back them up, but if necessary...

Don\'t fail to cooperate with the nice MOJ agent.  Really.

Note these important differences from modern earth procedures.
The first is admissability.  If the evidence is there, it\'s admissable.
This makes justice in the Imperium a lot more effective and efficient.
Also prone to bending its own rules, but the MoJ tries hard not to
do so in minor cases.

and "Impersonating a MOJ Officer"

Remember, that crimes *not* on the Recognized Crimes list are not going
to be enforcable over interstellar distances (at least not within the
legal system...).  There are a lot of things you can do on planets and
get away with if you leave.  But not everything...

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Santanocheev wasn\'t present at Regina so I doubt that it was his orders.
It seems more likely that it was according to Norris\'s plans as Regina
was his home system. Also, in FFW & also at the time the TNE dispatch
came out, there was no provision for detailed systems so Regina orbitting
a GG was a later development. Also, in FFW, SDB\'s were impossible to avoid
& also only had 2 options when confronted by attackers, fight or flight.

into a single system-wide battle. For most of CT, which is when this stuff

"mainworld" might\'ve been an asteroid belt too. There have been many threads
over the years concerning how ill-advised these tactics would be. This leaves
us with a typical Traveller dilemma. My preference is to accept the canon &

Obviously, phil, you haven\'t taken college courses lately. The requirements
for research materials for undergraduate work, according to my proffessors,
have become both more rigorous research, which takes roughly the same
amount of time as earlier works, and require access to higher tech aids, as
the requirements for 200 level papers at UAA for History explicitly require
use of computerized search tools in most cases.

As for work hours and religious/social factors, the allowance of women to
the industrial work force has had a major impact in western societies. As a
higher percentage of the population is now available for work outside the
home, demand for workers has dropped. Even the way unemployment figures are
calculated has changed since the 30\'s, by adding the women to the figures.

Since more people are working, fewer workers are required for the same
ammout of labor in the economy. And each is more productive, due to
technological changes. The advent of the Union also has had a limiting
effect upon work hours.

Also, the standard of living has continually risen. Not in the major jumps
of the past, but in minor (and in some cases, trivial) ways since the 70\'s;
it is now the common expectation to find all of the following in the
average household: a color TV, a videotape deck, a computer, an answering
machine, a microwave, and a coffee machine. In the early 70\'s, Color TV was
a luxury, videotapes were rare, and answering machines were possible, but
not common. Computers were just beginning to find their way into the home
market, aided by the game machines (Atari, Intellivision, Colecovision)
showing that computers made life better. And Digital watches have come a
LONG way. A time/date digital watch was expensive in the early 70\'s, they
now go for less than $5.00, are more rugged, and costlier to repair than
replace.

Another key factor is boredom. Most of my friends make certain to have
about 40-60 hours a week in regular activities, not due to need (the
difference between work and regular activities being taken by charitable or
volunteer work), but to keep busy and un-bored.

Of the 168 hours of the week, assume 8 per day in sleep (56/week), 2 on
personal care (14/week), and you have 98 hours available for other
activities. Most spend some 20 a week on TV (If I remember correctly), and
will probably try to keep busy for most of the rest.  So I figure that 40 a
week on work, provided that pays the bills, will probably be about right
for much of the future as full time work, as that allows some 30+ to be
spent on other activities, for fun or philanthropic nature. Work provides a
means of boredom avoidance.

Just as a side note, I found that when my shcool and work hours totalled
less than 40 hours per week, I found myself making work: doing intense
research for games, being active in philanthropic activities, etc. Same
with my friends. People need something to do. WOrk provides benefits of
material and lifestyle upgrades.

One other item of note: The US Navy keeps higher working hour schedules to
avoid boredom in the rather boring environment of ships, and organizes rec
activities to allow for the rest of the time available. (Naval Science 4,
USNA Press, ca 1980)

Human greed may keep the 30-50 hour work week as a good baseline;
travveller seems to make that assumption.

little question. Especially the thoughts of Angus sound very reasonable.

Thinking about the issue I came up with the following idea:

A member an Inperial department of justice (IDoJ) is more a prosecutor or
inquisitor than a cop, spy or special agent. They will deal with planetary
governements not individual persons. It\'s their duty to keep the peace
between the member worlds of the empire and keep taxes and economy going.
However, they will also overview investigations where Imperial officials or
nobles are involved. Finnally they will combat interstellar piracy and other
interstellar crimes. (Perhaps they will have to deal with mega corporations.)

An Imperial high commissioner (as I would call them) will work alone (or
with only a small staff) and in public. He won\'t carry weapons or act on
himself. He\'s equipped with all authorities to get help from local
authorities. It\'s a crime not to support an Imperial high commissioner. If
needed, he can call the Imperial fleet that will execute his orders.  The
IDoJ is a non-millitary organisation directly responsible to the Imperator
and higher in hierachy as the Imperial navy or other millitary organisations.

Commissioners most often work from their desk. They\'ll probably be members
of the nobility. They overview all the administrative work that is needed to
keep the Imperium together. They will fight all internal threats to the
empire. Every government probably fears the visit of a high commissioner who
will check the governments loyality.

The IDoJ is distant comparable with the German Verfassungsschutz that will
protect our state and constitution, watching and investigating suspect
persons or organisations and collecting all kind of datas. As I know it has
no executive powers but uses the normal police departments for the "dirty work."

What do you think about this idea?

Thruster plates may not violate conservation of energy at low velocities;
they always will at sufficiently high velocities. The amount of energy a
mass gains for a given (small) delta-V is a function of velocity; the faster
it\'s going, the more energy it gains per delta-V. (Consider 2 kg accelrating
from 0 to 1 m/s; it gains 1 joule of energy. Going from 1 to 2 m/s it
gains 4-1=3 joules of energy. Going from 2 to 3 it gains 9-4=5 joules of
energy, etc. Unless power required for thruster plates/contragrav drives goes
up as their velocity increases (which opens up the question "velocity relative
to what?") they\'ll violate conservation of energy sooner or later, in some
(indeed, in any) reference frame.

Conventional reaction drives don\'t have this problem because (in the frame
in which the solar system is at rest and the spacecraft is moving rapidly)
their exhaust ends up moving *slower* than the spacecraft; it *loses* energy.
(for a rapidly travelling spacecraft, I mean.) Energy is conserved in all
frames of reference. With CG/thruster plates the "reaction mass"(planet) ends
up actualling *gaining* kinetic energy (albeit a completely negligible
amount.)

Reactionless drives break either conservation of energy or conservation of
momentum or both, which is why you can use thruster-plate lifeboats to
devastate planets.

Forgive me for pointing out that the majority of the world\'s population
have none of these things.

In the same way in which the US (or the UK or Europe) are not representative
of living standards or work patterns in the late 20th century, so factors
such as
working hours, disposable income etc. will vary widely in the Traveller
universe.
Discussion has tended to presume an all embracing norm which doesn\'t
exist.  I would expect life for the majority of people on a TL15 rich planet
to be
very different to the life of the majority of people on a TL4 dirtball with
very few
natural resources.  Of course within each of those societies, there will be
huge variations in lifestyle.  I just wanted to point out the dangers of
assuming
that the dominant economy represents all.  I think that widely varying
set-ups should exist within Traveller - after all, that is part of what
gives the
game and its setting its charm and interest.

My 2 labour-hours worth (adjusted for local rates of exchange) ;-)

Nope. Haven\'t been (seriously) inside a Uni since 1976 ... and vowed once I\'d
left I\'d never return if I had any choice at all. So far I *have* had a choice.
However, as I sort of pointed out before, yep, agreed all the above re the
increased rigour of academic (even undergraduate) research ... but the advent
of Personal Computers has cut down one aspect of the workload *vastly*. When
I was writing stuff for Chivalry and Sorcery and Space Opera in the late 70\'s
and early 80\'s I did it either longhand, or typewritten ... and it took me
around half an hour to type a page (not counting all the screw it up and in the
bin "revisions"). If I made an error, the whole page had to be retyped from
scratch if it was at all serious. With computers, even my first one, an Apple
II (48k, 5.25" disk) allowed me to roughly halve that time, and did away
*completely* with the time wasted in rewrites and revisions ... probably half
of the time again. Thus, computers allowed a reduction to, say, 1/3rd of
what it took me originally to write anything ... and the way I used to do
essays, that would have been several days worth of work for each essay (this
was only a BA, nothing involving really serious effort like Engineering or
Science, say). Allowing for the fact that the level of reasearch required has
been shoved up somewhat, the use of computers has reduced the time required
in some respects considerably. Forex, recently I had cause to check out some
stuff at Fisher Library (Uni of Sydney, my alma mater) and used the Computer
Index system for the first time ... search by subject, author, keyword! When
I think of all the manual checking of the card catalog and then hitting the
shelves and stacks to see if the titles you found were relevant ... well, lets
say that a whole hell of a lot of time is saved there, too! Does it balance
out? Or is it easier/harder? I don\'t know ... but I suspect that its probably
more or less the same amount of work involved ... certainly ex-students of
mine who have stayed in touch (I teach High School) over the years haven\'t
complained of any excessive workload (and some of them were *very* average
academically speaking) ... though, of course, they don\'t have anything to
directly compare with any more than I do.

And the practise, at least locally, of "encouraging" kids to stay on longer
at High School ... mainly (to a cynical teacher such as myself) to keep them
off the dole! But even that can be manipulated ... we currently have, IIRC,
a 28% youth unemployment rate ... but that\'s only for the 18% of youth (IIRC)
who are actually not in education! Really its around 5% ... or around half of
what the whole population rate is, but it makes good election tactics to
talk about "28% unemployment".

Actually, Unions have been around a lot longer than the "recent" changes
brought about by the Industrial Revolution ... think Medieval Guilds and
even Roman equivalents thereof. They protected working conditions and
employment.

Exactly! Consider, then, how possession poor PCs in Traveller are! *Everything*
is far and away more expensive than there is any reason to believe that it
would be in an "advanced" future, and is far and away less advanced in and of
itself.

I did note, didn\'t I, that even with a 9 hour "working" week ... defined as
doing whatever was required to earn a living ... would mean that the workers
would have to redefine what *leisure* was. Our whole society is predicated on
people (or the vast majority of them) having a job ... how do we introduce
ourselves (often) ... "Hi, I\'m Phil, and I\'m a teacher". But need we assume
that the future will be the same? Need we assume that people will regard what
they do for a living as the important part of their lives? What will they
do otherwise? Your suggestions below are to the point ... but I\'m sure that
there will be other thinks, and should these not be classed as "work" of a
sort as well? I suppose it all depends on how you classify *work*.

Why do "Travellers" travel in the game? Because it\'s a way to be alive and
involved? Quite possibly!

I do more or less exactly the same sort of thing myself. But if I didn\'t have
to "work" more than 9 hours a week I would *still* have enough "work" to keep
me busy ... I just wouldn\'t be getting paid for it! And that\'s what I was
trying to get at with my previous comments.

An Imperial Dupe reveals the Nature of the Beast. "Who could possibly
criticize the One True Imperial Way save those racist Solomani ?", he
cries. The constant core of human belief - God hates splitters - reveals
itself starkly in this assumption.

History teaches us that the tyrannical USSR was the bitter foe of
Hitlerite Germany in ancient Solomani history; so the Last Imperium and
the Solomani Confederation - two sides of the same twisted coin - were
irreconcilable enemies. This enmity blinds only those who will not see.
The Imperium and the Solomani were alike in proving the banality of evil
- evil\'s myriad faces are all alike. President-for-Life Trinoch and
Maximum Leader Strephon headed equally contemptible regimes, both
dedicated to the enslavement of trillions of people. Why any sane person
would defend either is a deep mystery to this writer.

Like all tyrannies, the Imperium collapsed when the insulated ruling
elite, long since divorced from all reality, began to lose confidence in
the Mandate of Heaven which had hitherto under-pinned their rule. Just
as the frightful USSR collapsed on Old Earth when it\'s corrupt ruling
elite sought to liberalize it, so Strephon destroyed the Last Imperium
by seeking to allow the people to take control of a part of their
destiny. Dulinor of Ilelish may have fired the shots ended the Last
Imperium, but the attempted reforms of Tyrant Strephon, far too little
and much too late had heralded the end years before.

Weep for the suffering of trillions but shed not a single tear for the
passing of the Imperium.

Good thought. This raises the MoJs level of interest to governments rahter than
individuals ( unless they\'re very important ).

Incidently, I think this thread has established the prior claim of the "Ministry
of Justice" rather than the "Department". Published Canon aside, Monarchies like
the Imperium have Ministries ( run by Ministers - England is a good example ),
while democracies, etc, have Departments ( run by Secretaries, Directors, etc -
the USA is a good example ).

>Finally they will combat interstellar piracy and other
>interstellar crimes. (Perhaps they will have to deal with mega corporations.)

I have my doubts about the validity of Piracy in this context. After all,
pirates are likely to be a local phenomenon, and I suspect that there will be
very few large scale, multi subsector piracy rings operating simply because of
the cost of transporting the booty around. I imagine that subsector Dukes would
be the appropriate authorities to deal with pirates because a) the pirates live
and work on their back doorsteps, b) pirates impact the stability of trade and
politics in their sphere of influence ( and this affects the tax take too ), and
c) they have the clout to call in whatever military forces are necessary to
clean them out. I don\'t think the Imperium would care if a few ships get
hijacked.

As for interstellar crimes, I tend to agree with the writer who pointed out the
fact that the Imperium will tollerate anything as long as it gets its share of
taxes, and retains overall control. The only thing the Imperial Authorities
would really care about would be issues of Sovereignty (ie: Imperial Control of
vassal sectors, subsectors, and worlds; and External relations with other races
and empires, etc, including securing the borders and waging war when required),
and the affairs and rights of the Imperial Nobility.

Dealing with Megacorporations is an issue worthy of some investigation since
they wield so much power in the Imperium. On the other hand, the Imperial
Family, and the Nobility hold substantial ( if not controlling ) interests in
most of the Mega Corporations. This doesn\'t mean that they know whats going on
however, anymore than any stockholder has full knowledge or control of the
activities of a company in which he owns shares. Maybe the Imperial Nobility
needs a powerful investigative organisation to keep an eye on their investments
?? Of course, Megacorporations would have their own ( very competant ) security
forces ( another reason for the Imperium to ignore piracy as a crime ). And if a
Megacorporation IS doing something which goes against Imperial policy ( like
perhaps trading illegally across the Imperial Border ) then it would take a very
powerful, well funded, and highly connected organisation to take them on. Border
patrol and interdiction could be strictly a Navy or Scout responsibility of
course.


I also agree with the concept of Bounty Hunters providing the main means of
returning criminals who have skipped off-planet/out-system. And only the worst
criminals would be pursued. This means mainly Thieves and Fraudsters rather than
murderers because it would cost a hell of a lot of money to send a Bounty Hunter
even one jump after a felon. You have the cost of a return middle passage for
starters, and then there are lots of expenses involved working on a world where
you\'re not a native trying to find someone who doesn\'t want to be found ( or who
may even have moved on - if they\'re worth bringing back [which costs at least
the price of a low berth] they\'ll probably have a lot of someone elses money to
spend getting away ).

This provides a lot of great gaming oportunities for referees however :
- The bounty hunter on the players trail, who\'s always just one step behind
- The hassle of proving to a bounty hunter that you\'re not the guy he wants
- Being caught in the crossfire as a hunter tries to bring in a felon
- Being hired by a hunter to help track a felon
- Being hired by a hunter to transport a felon back while he follows his partner
- Being hired by a felon to decoy a hunter
- etc.

And if this is a normal way of tracking felons, there\'s likely to be a Hunters
Aid organisation of some kind operating on any world with a class A,B,or C
starport in order to help facilitate this type of service ( for a fee, or as a
reciprocal service by the local government ? ).

Fair enough. This desribes a fairly high-level bureaucrat with lots of power in
the right places, but at the end of the day, he\'s only one guy. He\'d be ok as a
senior administrator overseeing field agents perhaps. He\'d make a great NPC, but
there needs to be a lot more than this if the Imperium\'s going to last.

I think a corps of roving undercover agents unknown to the Nobility would
provide better security to the Imperium. The "gestapo" analogy used in an
earlier message is perhaps a bit strong for gameplay ( unless you like it really
dark ) although it\'s probably quite accurate from a realism perspective.
However, a slightly less psychotic and sadistic organisation would be a
realistic choice for gameplay. Agents of the Special Patrol Group (not the best
name in the world) I mooted a few days ago would probably range in temperament
from patriotic good guys to jaded, corrupt, chip-on-the-shoulder, ego-centric
types (ok, the gestapo). Well no-ones perfect,  and power corrupts ( and you
need a lot of power to go up against Megacorporations or Imperial Nobles and
expect to live ).

I think we should still hang onto the idea of the Empress wave. I mean,
we still dont know the *full* story. The only person who knows is Dave
Nilsen. The idea of the Primordials is a good one, but we havent really
given Dave\'s idea a *real* chance. Personally I\'d wait and see what Marc
Miller does first; in the end he makes the call.

Cheers,

Mark.

Dear Marc Miller:

As you may be aware, the technological background of Traveller is in
jeporady of being seriously invaliaded by the current pase of
technology.  Standard Traveller campaigns take little notice of
cyberware, genetic engineering, and nanotechnology, all of which is
becoming quite important.  More importantly, there is very little
recoginition of the implications of these technologies in the Traveller
universe.

I am aware of the fact that Traveller was originally based on 1970\'s
sci-fi. Also, I am aware that to make a full update of the Traveller
universe would mean a serious reworking of almost all aspects of
Traveller history and technology.  I am aware that the current
understanding of Traveller technology is quite enjoyable, and open to
adventuring: the same might not be said for a "fully updated" form of
Traveller.

(As an example, right now Europe can implant tiny electronic devices in
cattle that allows them to be tracked from orbit.  Also, certain forms of
totalitarianism becomes nearly impossible to corrupt and overthrow: read
the recent book _Drakon_ by S.M Stirling for an example of a seriously
high-tech form of racial supramacy.

Of course, technology need not always support the state: if everyone is
born with a built-in IQ of 250 and routine access to hand-held, nanite-based
replicators, the State is going to have a very rough time controlling
them...)

Finally, I know that simply because you have updated Travelelr once
doesn\'t meant that you won\'t have to update it again, causing the same
probelms that Traveller\'s mutiple rulesets create. (Never mind Virus, and
the OFFICAL death of the Imperium.)

I hope that you will consider the possibility of "fully updating"
Traveller, to take into account all these new possibilities available.
If you choose not to, fine, but at least create a viable, interesting
explaniation why we don\'t have immortal nobles, or why every Imperial
system doesn\'t have multiple terraformed worlds, or why
nanotechnology is so rare 3700 years after it\'s discovery.

Please note that I\'m crossposting this to the Traveller Mailing List, for
comment\'s.

Steven Bonneville\'s <bonnevil@itlabs.umn.edu> comments on Dulinor the
Idealist led me to think about how and why the Imperium might have lost
sight of those ideals. I\'ll apologise in advance for over-reliance on
analogy hereafter.

Like Rome the Imperium is militarily successful and expanding under the
Principiate (the Lentuli dynasty), and under pressure under the Dominate
(note the absence of any major military victories (*1) under the
Alkhalikoi). Early Emperors enjoy long and stable reigns (genetically
Vilani Lentuli Emperors live roughly twice as long as the Terran-
descended Alkhalikoi (*2)). The Principiate favours a proactive policy
of economic development (*3), the Dominate favouring the military over
the civilian economy does not.

Since Arbellatra ascended the Iridium Throne solely as a result of
military power, it seems likely that she would be mainly responsible for
the post-Civil War nature of the Imperial military. A noticeable feature
of the Dominate military is the general ennoblement of the senior ranks
(*4), which inevitably ensures the future militarisation of the Imperial
aristocracy (*5). Further note that the Alkhalikoi established the X-
Boat news management system (*6), no doubt as a another measure to
ensure that no-one else could follow Arbellatra\'s example.

While the Lentuli exercised direct rule over the Empire, the Alkhalikoi
Empress Margaret I established the Solomani Sphere as an abdication of
Imperial control. In granting the Sphere self-rule, Margaret laid the
roots of the ruinous Rim War, a humiliating check for the supposedly
invincible Imperial forces. After Margaret the Imperium carried out it\'s
disastrous experiment with psycho-history, the details of which suggest
an elite increasingly distanced from the masses. With the Imperial
Guard\'s overthrow of Styryx, supposedly a result of that Emperor\'s
incompetence (*7) a crisis is obviously in the making.

When the last Alkhalikoi Emperor, Strephon the Dreamer seeks to reform
the Imperium and appoints the idealistic Dulinor of Ilelish (*8), the
die is cast. Either Dulinor and Strephon will begin to succeed, in which
case it seems quite possible that Strephon will go the way of Nicholle
or Styryx, or they will fail (as happened) and Dulinor will take matters
into his own hands.

And if Strephon had been removed by one means or other, I suppose that
one of Varian or Margaret (and not Ciencia Iphigenia or Lucan) would
have succeeded him "by popular acclamation". (*9)

Anyone like to expand on this, demolish it or whatever ?

************************************************************************
Notes

(*1) However the Lentuli basically ceased expanding after the unsuccess-
ful and bloody Julian Wars. They did succeed in quelling the Ilelish
Revolt of the 5th century with ease. The Alkhalikoi Emperors presided
over a catalogue of defeats in which number I would include the Solomani
Rim War. Even the trumpeted victories of the Fifth Frontier War are
relatively minor affairs and do not restore the pre-Frontier Wars status
quo ante. As I recall, DGP\'s Vilani & Vargr suggests increasing trouble
even in the years before the Rebellion defending the coreward frontier
(Vland sector Library Data ?). See MT Imperial Encyclopedia (cited as
MTIE), Chronology of the Imperium, pp6-7 for an outline.

the RIDP existed at the time of the revolt. Note also that the Lentuli
policies achieved nearly TL14, whereas the Alkhalikoi presided over
hardly any advances. See MT Rebellion Sourcebook (cited as MTRSB),
Dulinor, pp46-47 and source cited (*6) below.

(*4) See CT/High Guard/MT, Character Generation, passim for the case of
Naval officers.

(*5) Since the the nobility did not intervene in the Civil War and
maintained the civil government leaving the military to fight it out
amongst themselves, it seems improbable that the ante-bellum nobility
could have been as militarised as afterwards. Note especially the large
numbers of senior nobles who are known to have served in the military in
the period immediately before the Rebellion. All of this suggests an
increasing militarisation of the nobility and civil government, removing
any clear division between these arms of the state as existed at the
time of the Civil War. See MTIE, Library Data: Civil War (pp20-21) and
sources cited there.

(*6) See MT Referee\'s Companion, Techonology, p34 for table showing
Imperial TL at various dates.

(*7) While sources (e.g. TD9, MTIE Emperor\'s List) suggest that Styryx
was incompetent it isn\'t necessarily true. Note that under Gavin\'s rule
the Imperium fails to defeat the Solomani. Perhaps there is further
information on this in Invasion: Earth, regrettably I don\'t have it.

(*8) A reading of Survival Margin suggests that Dulinor was exception-
ally naive, witness the Professor K. and President S. affairs, Survival
Margin, passim.

(*9) Well, that\'s what I think. Iphigenia was too much a chip off the
old block and Lucan (*) too likely to be another energetic reformer.
Varian was a \'waster\' (a characterisation based on the fact that he was
dossing round the Palace with his floozy when shot by Ilelish agents)
and thus easily manipulated and Margaret would just tinker at the edges
with reform.

(*) Lucan, a reformer ? Yes. He certainly wasn\'t the paranoid maniac
that he was made out to be. At least not paranoid. Most of the plots
against him were all too real. And there is no evidence except for
Windhook\'s very dubious testimony to support the charge of fratricide. I
suspect Wondhook was a SolSec agent and assassin just as Lucan claimed -
why else run away to Corridor, the very farthest part of the Empire from
the Confederation unless to cover SolSec\'s tracks ? For Windhook\'s story
see MTRSB, Two Stories, pp8-9.

Hmmm.  The ideas sound good, but unfortunately my knowledge of even basic
physics is pitiful, (putting it kindly).  That\'s why I\'d rather the more
compotent member\'s of this list to take a crack of it.

And yes, disintergrater technology does start at TL17+.  I stand corrected.

I suspect that PC\'s just LOVE these worlds!  The more mayhem, the better!
Then again,law level zero cultures probably have a savagely hard view of
honour/religious codes, to compensate for the very small amount of
government control.

Oh, come on McLellan!  You weigh a vast mass of published information on
the Imperium at one hand, and the idea of the Laissez-faire Imperium at
the other, and you decide to dismiss the published information!

Does the Imperium tolerate extremely nasty dictatorships?
    YES, SIR!
Does the Imperium tolerate anti-alien pogroms?
    NO, SIR!
   (Well, maybe - if you can show/tell me where such anti-alien pogroms
    are published in the Traveller canon.  This would go under "Murder is
    forbidden" part of Imperial law, established under Cleon)
Does the Imperium tolerate other assorted unpleasentness?
    YES, SIR!

Does the Imperium care about the little people?
   NO, SIR!
Why not?
   THE IMPERIUM IS A TRADE/MILITARY FEDERATION, SIR!

That is, it\'s a federation of self-governing worlds, with interstellar
affairs governed by a noble elite.  The "Little People" is under the
preview of the local government, not the Imperium.

Only outside the domain of the local government does Imperial Law
\'kick-in\', so to speak.

Mr. McLellan is quite correct to point out the faults of a very libertarian,
laissez-faire autocratic interstellar government.  However, he
underestimates the effects of non-military forces, like trade and
political influence.

For example, let\'s take the Third Reich, in control of the New Germany
system.  They decide to gas the local Jewish population, but the Imperium
forbids it as sentients cannot be killed.  So the Nazi\'s oppress them
instead.

The subsector press takes note of their plight, and creates a hubbub: local
nobles place pressure on the Baron in charge of New Germany
to shape up the local government.  Also, a few trade sanctions are put in
place, which are quite hateful to a pro-expansionary government like the
Reich.   Eventually, a deal is reached: the Jews are given some unwanted
badlands to inhabit on New Germany, and in return trade is restored.

[No, this is not the best possible option, but it\'s the most likely.
It\'s certainly more likely than the Imperium just standing by and letting
the Jews die, if for no other reason than bad press for the local subsector
nobility, who - in accordance with the Imperial Honour Code, still in
force in Strephon\'s era - have to at least appear to protect the lives of
their subjects.]

Of course, this senario can be challanged in a number of ways.  If New
Germany was a high-pop TL F system, rather than a low-pop TL 5, I\'m sorry,
but those Jews are dead.  The Imperium will weigh the consequences of
pissing off a powerful world rather than letting 6 million people die,
and will let the Jews die.  (In real life, no one declares war on another
nation because of a mere local atrocity.)

Is the Imperium as varigated as claimed?  Sorry, Mr. McLellan, put that\'s
simply untrue - if you prefer the New Era viewpoint, anyways.  Imperial
culture is stated to be influenced by standard JudeaoChristian norms in
HIver & Itklur, and the cultures of the Regency and the Coalition - areas
as far apart as you please - both operate as democracies, using Western
norms.  Claims to the contrary, there is a single Imperial culture,
essentually that of 20th century Solomani.

(I seem to remember an article that noted that Imperial Anglic has hardly
changed from 20th Century English, and that\'s why most of Imperial
culture resembled that of Western Europe/US just before contact with the
Vilani.

Moreover, there are two "Supercultures" in the Imperium, the Solomani and
the Vilani.  They would also tend to bond together the Imperium as one
single unit, and make possible a single judicial system.  Finally, note the
"Domaincultures", forming just before the Rebellion: the Denebi culture,
revivals of the Vilani and Sylean cultures, the Daibei, Antares, etc.
Laws on a world in one culture would "make some sense" to another world in
the same general area.  [Like 20th century Alaska and 20th century England,
rather than 20th century America and 4th century America.]

<Murder part snipped>

The Imperium would define murder as unlawful killing of an organic
sentient. Does the Imperium define the unborn as sentient?  Who knows?
But this isn\'t going to affect everyday forms of killing.

Does the Imperium allow the killing of Vargr simply because they are
Vargr?  Nope: even if it\'s lawful according to the local government, it
isn\'t lawful according to Imperial Law, and the Imperial lawcodes is the
*Minimum* law levels within the Imperium.

Even The Regency Sourcebook noted that the Imperium was rather
remarkably tolerant of nonhumans: I wouldn\'t be surprised if it wasn\'t
past of the never-published Honour Codes of the nobility.  Also, remember
that Archduke Brzk was *surprised* at the racism against his bid for the
Irridium Throne: this suggest that you had to dig very hard to find
racism in Imperial culture.

Nope, again wrong.  Remember that the Imperium DOES share a single
culture, as noted previously.  And yes, that culture is remarkably close
to that of the 20th century West.

What, you don\'t like that?  Well, you can built YOUR Imperium to any
culture that you like - that has nothing to do with the published, canon
Imperium.  Hey, it\'s your campaign - not GDW\'s, not TML\'s, and certainly
not Alvin Plummers\' !!

Of course not - if we were really trying to build a 1000-year-old
spacefaring culture, set in the 57th century!

However, not even Dave Neilson was trying to do that (see the back of
Hiver and Ihthur, were he sneers at "earnestly building the real future").
Moreover, the Imperium was meant as a "anyone can play here" environment,
and was never properly thought out.  As people wrote material for the
Imperium, their writings naturally (if lazily) assumed that the Imperium
was a lot like the 20th century.

Building a Real Imperial Culture is WORK - and neither Marc Miller nor
Dave Neilson nor Lorean Wiseman ever put in the sweat equity to build it.

Sorry, an interstellar Gestapo is simply impossible, due merely to travel
times and the incredible numbers of people this Gestapo is supposedly
trying to control.  Not even SolSec ever really got their business
together: the closest thing to a proper Gestapo has got to be the
Zhodani Thought Police.

Moreover, this Gestapo is simply unnecessary.  First, the Imperium is
hardly a goverment occuping hostile territory, but the legitimate successor
state of over 6,000 years of interstellar rule.  Secondly, the Imperium
has no need for ideological uniformity - remember, even the Regency
Sourcebook notes the Imperium\'s commitment to cultural *diversity*.

Finally, you\'re contradicting yourself: how can the Imperium be both
absolutely lawless and completely repressive at the same time?
Lawlessness can\'t be repressive, unless you have a powerful, starspanning
repressive religion to make the laws.  And any facistic nation you care
to name - Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia, Pol Pot\'s Cambodia - most
certainly had laws, just evil and loathesome ones (looked at from a
Western JudeoChristian perspective, anyways).

Ah, now we have a better attack on the Imperium on the last sentence.
The question is, is the Imperium an unaccountable autocracy?

It is most definitely an autocracy.

But it is most an *accountable* autocracy.

But whose holding it accoutnable?
   THE PEOPLE, of course!
But.. but... there isn\'t any voting!

Voting isn\'t the only way to hold a government accountable for it\'s
actions, Mr. McLullan!  The typical labourer in Elizabethian England was
much more free from government rules and regulations that someone in
modern England.  Please, at least read the history books before insisting
that all autocracy\'s are, by definition, evil!

Again, all previously published material except material that you like is

Does the Imperium use informers?
   They\'d better!  However, not many - most of the information
   the Imperium would want is available via any decent interstellar
   press, so informers in the Imperium would be just about as useful as
   informers in the United States - in almost all cases, a waste of tax
   money.

Does the Imperium use murder squads?  Hmmm... I\'d say yes.  The Imperium
   is an autocracy: if the nobles rule that said criminal is to be killed on
   sight, then said criminal will be killed on sight.  Period.

   You seem to imply that this would be a secret, dasterly action.
   Highly unlikely: remember, interstellar court\'s are all run by nobles,
   so it\'s almost certainly a matter of public record.  Indeed, it would
   HELP the Imperium top put it on the public record, so local bounty
   hunters and law level zero nations can pitch in and end this threat to
   the Imperium!

The above paragraph is certainly correct.  Actually, they *could* wait
for the Imperium to act, but the Imperial bureaucrasy is slow and
massive.  Much more efficent to just hire a few folk to Take Care of the
Problem...

(Similar reasons exist for the Starmercs.  Again, you could wait for the
local Imperial Navy to detail a detatchment, but you can get faster
results by getting starmercs - almost all of whom have connections with
local naval squadrons...)

Hey, thay\'s what I keep telling you!  The Imperium IS the 20th century
West with jump drive!  Now, why do you finally see the light now, but
refuse to admit that 20th century Yanks in space would outlaw murder
*everywhere* in the Imperium?

Sorry, my French is nonexistant.  And Slow Imperial Bureaucracy is a

*Sigh*

If the Imperium brought down governments as easily as you wish, the
Imperium *would* be the Evil Empire you so desperately want.  But the
Imperium *does* believe in worlds determining their own fate, rather
than having their destiny imposed from above.  Therefore, it usually
wouldn\'t just destroy nations simply because it doesn\'t like their policies!

Moreover, remember that the Second Imperium (aka the Rule of Man) was as
interfering and as \'democratic\' as you want, destroying Vilani society to
create it\'s own vision of a Democratic Universe.  *It* barely lasted 400
years.  The Third Imperium merely learned from their failure, and lasted
almost 3 times as long before being destroyed by nobles like Dulinor yelling
"Democracy Now!".

Oh, if Dulinor only decided to slowly "seed" democratic institutions like
the British, rather than go revolutionary like Napoleonic French....

> Remind me how often the people were consulted on Imperial policy,

Never - offically.

Unoffically?  Well, you you really thing that the Imperium could have
lasted 1100 years without the support of it\'s citizens?  Of COURSE it
took into consideration the needs of the citizenry!  The imperium didn\'t
died because of a massive revolt against Unjust Laws of the Evil Imperium,
but because the noble Archduke Dulinor believed that nonnoble Imperials
should have a larger say in government, and chose to kill the Emperor to
make his point!

Tell me, has ANY government EVER had the perfect, spotless morality you

fairly decent interstellar government, not Heaven on Earth!

Truth?  Perhaps a self-deluded version of it.  Maybe it IS true, in the
Imperium you are gaming in - in that case, more power to you.  However,
your entertaining post has not the slightest connection to anything in
the Offical Imperium.

First, in my reply to Mr. McLullan (sorry if I mispelled your name), I
said that the Imperium would permit a high-pop, TL F, high-pop New German
Reich to kill of the Jews.

Sorry, I take that back.  If evidence is produced that the Imperium world
allow this - say, a Traveller News Service article saying that the
Imperium let this happen, or a published adventure about such a
circumstance in the United Imperium - then I will agree that such a thing
is possible.

Otherwise, I am simply wrong, as such a slaughter would be against the
essentually 20th century mores of the Imperium.  (As I described in my
previous post).  Sorry, Mr. McLullan - but I just NEED to be consistant!

----

In my design for the Empty Quarter, I\'ve been planing to create a
six-subsector police force.  Since I have previously established that the
Imperium DOES have a single, Judeo-Christian morality (See Hiver &
Ikthur, Regency Sourcebook), and since the Offical Imperium isn\'t
an Evil Empire (See almost everything published by GDW or anyone else,
and exclude posting by Mr McLullan), such an police force is necesary,
and probably "standard equipment" for most Sector Dukes.

I open the floor to suggestions regarding this police force.

I think the Looking Glass Technologies 3D engine used in "System Shock"
is much better,
but I\'ve never heard of any map editors for it. It would be kind of
interesting to use a networked DOOM style game to resolve combat, the Ref
could drive a NPC. You would need a system to let you model Traveller weapons
and armour systems, and some way to handicap characters that have no
skills with particular weapons (Make aim shakier if you don\'t have
the requisite skill?). It would be awkward lugging PCs (or Macs) around to
setup a game though.
But how to model skills like tactics?
The player could have more tactical skill than their character
is entitled to :).

Hey, the more historical analogies, the better!

Personally, I like this: my own version has the Zhoasto/Lentuli dynasty
as "Medici nobility" oriented to economic growth, with the Alkhalikoi
dynasty as "Military nobility" oriented to military might.  Still, your
view here has merit.

On the "Loss of the Mandate from Heaven": this feels right-on, using
MegaTraveller and New Era material.  Democracy suddenly became all the
rage, *among the nobility*. (See Dulinor and Norris, and their desire to
impose democracy from the top-down).  This simply did not exist in the
Classic universe, and the Imperial nobility there was depicted as
confident and stable.  As they say, choose which roleplaying field you
like best.

Ahh!  Well, not necessarily Doomsday, but Bad Things Becomes Possible...
However, nowhere here was a hint of the territorial fractionalism that
marked the Rebellion.  If it was just a bunch of nobles bashing each
others head\'s in for the Irridium Throne, no problem.  But the Rebellion
developed into a paraNationialistic revolution, with every Domain looking
out for number one.  In a Virusless universe, you\'d get a bunch of major
nations - each about 1-2 sectors in size - and a whole score of minor
nations by 1200.

Looks like the truth to me.  The Alkhalikoi Dynasty was largely that of
stability, with signs of a slow decline.

Worthwile notes.  You slander the Alkhalikoi dyansty a bit with the tech
level business, though.  The Imperium from  0 to 600 rose from TL 12 to
TL 14: The Imperium from 600 to 1100 rose from TL 14 to TL 15, and was
just approaching TL 16 when the Rebellion broke.  Not THAT much of a
difference...

Bloddy right.  Also, consider the information in the Rebellion
Sourcebook, where it speaks of the frayed chains of command in the
subsector/sector level.

Of course, this is not *necessarily* a signal of decline: the Romans
operated quite nicely with a mess of a government, as they has a very
strong culture among the Ruling Elite.

Is Stryryx incompetent?  Hey, is possible, and without contraditing
evidense I can only agree.

Did Gavin fail to defeat the Solomani?  Hmmm, I\'d say yes.  Imperial
war aims were the reconquest of the *entire* Solomani Sphere: it didn\'t
happen.  They *did* reconquer Terra, and had to be satisfied with this
lesser substitute.

Hey, maybe.  He certainly didn\'t thing his plans through!
A more harsher judgement should be given to Strephon: he had decades of
expeience governing as Emperor at the time when he appointed Dulinor as
Archduke.  That he should make such a poor choice is astounding!

[ProImperials like me - who left the Offical Imperium at about 1100 - are
free to ignore Dulinor, of course.]

The probem then is, what were the policies he would have established to

Perhaps.  Anyone cares to carefully review Lucan\'s testimony in _Rebellion_?

Had Wondhook made a beeline for the Solomani Rim, you\'d be crowing
about how Wondhook - after completing his mission - was simply heading
back to his handlers as ordered.

Still, continue your posts - they ARE getting better, and more closely
adhering to Traveller Canon.  Also, I like the wild spins on Traveller
history, as they promote creativity.

    'body' => 'Sorry to weigh in so late with my thoughts on law in the Imperium, but my
legal practice has been cutting into my Traveller time.

To my friends at HIWG:  this thread has been developing on the Traveller
mailing list, and I believe that it is of some interest to us as well, so
I am cross-posting here.

I disagree with Mr. Herbert\'s position, see George William Herbert, Law in
the Imperium, 50 Challenge 22 (May/June 1991), for two reasons:  It has
the Imperium caring far too much about individuals and it has the Imperium
inserting itself too deeply into local affairs.  For example, the article
states: "The MOJ usually places a minimum of one field agent per planet,
with one additional agent per 100,000 population."  Id. at 23, col. 3:
That\'s just unworkable.

The political economy of the Imperium determines its legal systems or
systems.  That economy has the Imperium guaranteeing local autonomy,
security from extra-Imperial threats, and some security from
intra-Imperial but extra-star system threats (see Imperial Rules of War).
("Local" or "world" here refers to a member state of the Imperium, whether
a nation on a balkanized world, a single planet, a star system, or the
Vegan Autonomous District.) In addition, the Imperium guarantees that
business, especially megacorporations, will be able to conduct
interstellar trade free from piracy both free-lance and governmental.
Hence the Imperial Navy and the Ministry of Standards, which sets (in
association with trade organizations), inter alia, starship container
sizes, starport berthing and other facilities, starship safety and
engineering standards, communications protocols, etc., all of which are
supposed to facilitate commerce.

The Imperium thus not only has no reason not to care about individuals and
individual rights, but actually has strong motivation not to -- if it
interferes in local affairs (like the U.S. federal government does when it
brings or authorizes civil rights prosecutions or lawsuits, which
Herbert\'s article suggests that the Imperium does), it violates its
guarantee of local autonomy.

In some situations, the Imperium will interfere with local autonomy, but
only when a threat to Imperial or regional security is manifest.  For this
reason, the Imperium basically ignores whatever transpires in member
states:  rape, murder, denial of vote, mandatory voting, denial of habeas
corpus, failure to wear clothes in public, wearing clothes in public,
destruction of property, theft, abuse of authority, breach of fiduciary
duty, adultery, whatever -- the Imperium leaves it to local star systems
to deal with.  If the sophonts living there don\'t like it, they have
essentially political, options:  using the local political process for
change; overthrowing the local order by force and violence; emigrating;
and hiring outsiders to help with one of the above.  The last category
might interest the Imperium from time to time, because it affects the
Imperium\'s guarantee of some security from extra-local threats.  The
Imperium tends to discourage the development of strong regional (i.e.,
multi-system) movements that might threaten it, but that isn\'t a matter of
law as much as politics.

Now Imperial law itself -- the law in effect at Imperial installations and
in space between star systems -- is a different matter.  It is designed to
facilitate interstellar commerce.  It is largely regulatory, as indicated
in the brief discussion of the Ministry of Standards.

Imperial law does include a number of criminal laws, which are not too
different from the prohibitions on acts mala in se that the Terran
conquerors brought with them into the Ziru Sirka thousands of years ago.
So for example violence except in defense of self or others or when
authorized by the government is a crime, and "violence" is construed
broadly enough to include, e.g., detention of a sophont.  Theft,
embezzlement, fraud, and the like are bad for business and are also
Imperial crimes.  The Imperial Criminal Code also prohibits crimes against
the Imperium -- such as treason, insurrection, and espionage.  The
Imperium may prosecute for crimes against the Imperium without regard to
where the crimes took place.  Thus members of a conspiracy to overthrow
the archduke that involved recruiting mercenaries in the Aslan Hierate and
making cash payments in a bar on an Imperial member state could all be
prosecuted for treason as long as they could be brought into an Imperial
Judicial Court.

Imperial law also includes numerous civil law provisions, which are more
important to the day to day life of NPCs (if not PCs) than any criminal
laws.  For example, the Imperial Commercial Code sets out the rules for
the purchase, sale, hypothecation, and insurance of goods in interstellar
trade.  The Imperial Admiralty Code contains the rules for registration,
ownership, and operation of starships.  The Imperial Rules of Judicial
Procedure set out the rules lawyers must follow when pursuing cases in
Imperial Judicial Courts.  The Imperial Naval and Military Code governs
the conduct of Imperial naval and army personnel and marines.  An
interesting effect of the presence of the various Imperial codes and rules
is their adoption by many member states as local law.  In this way, the
Imperium is subtly -- and probably unintentionally -- undermining the
diversity and local autonomy of its members.

The Imperium does not maintain a police force per se.  Enforcement of
Imperial law is left to the executives in charge of those places where
Imperial law applies:  Captains of starships, directors of research
stations, and Sky Port Authority Executive Directors call on their
security departments for law enforcement.  Crimes not implicating a noble
or Imperial security are dealt with on site, with the executive sitting as
chief judge of a panel and counsel representing both sides presenting the
case.  Appeal is to the local Imperial Judicial Court.

The Ministry of Justice Special Branch is the Imperial secret police, and
is charged with enforcing the laws against crimes against the Imperium.
This is largely a matter of counter intelligence work.  The MoJ also
provides prosecutors for crimes against the Imperium, and advises the
Emperor and Moot on issues relating to crime and social order, based on
its ongoing research and monitoring.

The Imperial Judicial Courts (not to be confused with the Imperial Court
at Capital) are a system of courts that hear civil cases arising under
Imperial law, cases involving crimes against the Imperium, and appeals of
criminal cases arising under Imperial law at Imperial installations.

Each subsector has an Imperial Judicial Court, which may have several
judges.  The judges are recommended by the dukes and archdukes to the
Emperor (actually to a selection committee that recommends them to the
Emperor, but the committee is the Emperor\'s agent), who appoints them with
the advice, but without regard to the consent, of the Moot.  Judges are
Imperial nobles, either granted rank for their tenure or already holding
rank.  They serve at the pleasure of the Emperor.  The Ministry of
Justice\'s Courts Branch officially handles judicial administration, but
actually the Imperial Judicial Courts depend on their host dukes for
almost everything.  For this reason, they do not hear cases involving the
duke of the subsector in which they sit, nor of his or her relatives.
Appeal is to a panel of senior Imperial Judges from within the subsector,
then to the Archduke, then to the Imperial Court.  (The Emperor may
theoretically hear cases as the highest judge in the realm, but has never
done so.  Rather, the Emperor assigns a panel of senior judges to sit at
judicial appeals at the Imperial Court.)

Bear in mind that this structure is grafted onto a Vilani sensibility that
values cooperation and mediation.  Most commercial disputes -- even
between megacorporations with their mega law firms -- are mediated.  Most
crimes are mediated, leading to a contract between victim and perpetrator
for restitution and apology.  I\'ve devoted a lot of space to the
structured parts of the system, but they lend themselves to it.

One final point is the "system" of manorial courts.  Each enfoeffed noble
has virtually complete power within his or her fief, including maintaining
whatever legal and judicial structure is desired.

Thank you for your attention. Your comments are as always appreciated.

I have been thinking about how best to develop the site from here.
Rather than just creating HTML versions of the HDs I think moving to
an encycolpedic/gazateer would be best, with clickable subsector maps,
but I\'d be interested in anybody elses opinions. I would also like to
extend the "surrounding sectors" map at the site to include all of

Has anybody else got this in hand?

Finally I\'m busy learning Javascript at the moment so you may see some

of my old DOS programs.

 I _have_ to respond to this - it looks at one admittedly valid
 point against us, without looking at the whole picture.  The
 comparatively recent "hard right" that American social and
 political attitudes have taken is not due to an unwillingness to
 help those less fortunate than us - it is due to an unwillingness
 to keep giving and giving and giving and then be told that we\'re
 scum for wanting to keep some for ourselves, and being told that
 these people, _some_ (not all) of whom are perfectly capable of
 working _if_ they wanted to, have a _right_ to sponge off the
 rest of us.  We also object to the bloated bureaucracies that
 constantly mismanage these "entitlements".

 Most people have no objection to unemployment benefits; we tend to
 view them as _insurance_ - and I don\'t think that there\'s a state
 in the country that doesn\'t have restrictions similar in principle
 to New York State - you must have worked for some specified
 portion of the prior year; the benefits stop after some smaller
 portion of the year; the benefit amount is keyed to the salary of
 the most recent job.  In NY, you work for a year, and get six
 months of benefits at half your last salary, to a limit of $350
 per week (or at least those were the numbers when I last applied,
 three years ago).

 Most people don\'t have an objection \\per se\\ to programs like Food
 Stamps or AFDC (Aid to Families with Dependent Children) - we
 object to having no controls on those programs, so that recipients
 can casually buy lobster and filet and soda and potato chips and
 pretzels and Swiss and French chocolate, while the taxpayers
 shopping in the same supermarket have to choose whether to buy a
 roast for one day or chicken cutlets for two days, and maybe we\'ll
 get the Hershey bars next week.  Worse, these people get the
 change from their food stamps in _cash_ - so that after buying the
 pretzels, they can go into the liquor store around the corner and
 buy scotch.

 Based on your post, I\'d suggest that the recipient classes in your
 part of the world (Australia?  Could also be Europe.) remember
 that _any_ person needs to maintain a sense of responsibility for
 one\'s own life, for one\'s own actions.  The recipient classes
 here, at least in the inner cities, seem to have forgotten that -
 or deliberately ignore it - and then proceed to rub the
 responsible taxpayers\' noses in that fact.

 The problem that we have with Eurosocialism is not the high taxes
 \\per se\\, although that does tend to turn us off - it\'s the idea
 of the high taxes with our current set of recipients, and with our
 current wasteful government.  If the US government would use our
 tax money to build as efficient a train system as Germany, Japan,
 or Switzerland has; or to provide quality cradle-to-grave health
 care at reasonable cost, as Sweden does (used to do?); or any of a
 number of individual programs that Europe has gotten right, but
 which can\'t work in the US as long as we maintain our current
 culture of victimhood; _then_ we might see a return to the concept
 that you\'ve characterized as "noblesse oblige".  We had it up
 until the Crash in \'29.

 This has nothing to do with Traveller.  Followups to private mail,
 please.

Well, MM could guarantee he would have one less buyer for his product by
following this advice. DGP\'s Sparklers were a sub-Star Trek plot device.
If I wanted to adventure with the Borg I\'d play Star Trek. I don\'t (or
even watch it very often) because it\'s mind numbingly stupid. So are the
Borg (oops, Sparklers).

It\'s quite fortunate in a way that DGP stopped being involved with
Traveller when they did, at least I could remember the happy days of
WBH, 101 Vehicles, TD and MTJ whereas if you look at the list of future
ideas in MTJ4 (?) you\'ll find that they vary between dumb and dumber. I
thank Ghu for Hard Times and Virus, which spared me the bloody Sparklers
if nothing else (and I never ever thought I\'d say anything that nice
about the decision for TTNE to replace MT).

If you want to keep the Empress Wave and make sense, just don\'t connect
the Wave to the Consulate\'s troubles; that easy. Forget the Primordials,
we\'ve got the Ancients, thanks very much. If you want to introduce weird
aliens, what about the folks that built "Shadows" or the Annic Nova\'s
builders. Since the Annic Nova was built for humanoids, how about them
as EW-transmitters. The EW message ? "Give us our ship back !".

Wrong. What you have up there looks like a formula for tidal
acceleration.

The formula is:

     G*M*m
F = ----
      R^2

F = force due to gravity.
G = Gravitation constant
M = gravitational mass of planet
m = gravitational mass of ship
R = distance between planet and ship.

So increasing the gravitational mass of the ship increases the force in
direct proportion to the mass increase. Since CG can nuetralize 90% of
the mass, then it can probably *increase* it by that much as well.

The *effect* of the force is governed by *this* formula:

F = m*A  (or A=F/m)

F = force acting upon object
m = inertial mass of object
A = acceleration imparted to object

Note that if gravitational mass and inertial mass are equal, then all
objects will be accelerated identically by a planet. But since CG
neutralizes *gravitational* mass, but leaves *inertial* mass alone
(otherwise your jets would move you more easily *horizontally* while
the CG was on!).

So the acceleration will increase/decrease in direct proportion to the
change in gravitational mass. So With CG in full "reverse" you\'d get a
"free" 90% of the planet\'s attraction as a boost. The exact amount
depends on distance.

You\'d have to be careful not to let it pull you into the planet though.
I\'d just handle it by calculating the gravity vector as normal, then
adding/subtracting one up to 9/10ths as long in the same or the
opposite direction (ie directly towards or away from the planet).

BTW, the Hohmann (not Hohlman!) orbit has nothing to do with
gaining/losing velocity by any sort of trick. It\'s just generally the
cheapest possible way from one orbit around a bosy to another orbit
around the same body. It\'s an elliptical orbit that is tangent to both
the starting and ending orbits at the point where you leave the first
and enter the second. That\'s why the timing is so critical. You have to
leave one orbit at a time when the time you\'ll spend in the Hohmann
orbit is equal to the time it\'ll take the planet in the other orbit to
get to the point where the hohmann orbit crosses its orbit. (A diagram
would make this a *lot* simpler <sigh>).

The slingshot effect is something quite different. And the gain or loss
depends not on your propulsion system, but on transfering momentum to
or from the planet to your ship.

The idea is that you pass *behind* the planet in it\'s orbit and let its
gravity speed you up (getting a boost for "free" by fractionally
slowing the planet! Or you can pass in front of it to slow down.

So the limit is set by two things. First, how close you can safely get
to the planet. Second buy both the mass and orbital velocity of the
planet.

There\'s also a manuever that involves making a close pass to increase
the effectiveness of a burn by doing it at closest approach to the
planet. What this does is take the potential energy of the fuel burned
and add that to what you\'d normally get from the burn.

Picture it like this. If you *didn\'t* burn the fuel, its potential
energy would turn into kinetic energy as you approached the planet, and
as you moved away, the kinetic energy would turn back into potential
energy. Once you got back to the same distance, you\'d be back where you
started, except for the change in direction.

Now, consider what happens if you use that mass at the closest
approach. You get to keep the kinetic energy, plus the extra it gives
by going thru the engines. But the more efficient your engines, the
less benefit you\'ll get.

Well, to start with you are going to have to give up the "one size fits
all approach". You *can\'t* create a device that\'ll cover all the
situations and do so *usefully*.

Decreasing radiation isn\'t going to be possibly in one of these. Metal
makes things *worse*, not better, as most particle radiation is going
too *fast* to interact with people. If it hits a light element, it
tends to stop. If it hits a heavy element (metal) it tends to knock out
a *shower* of *slower* particles. Slow enough that they *will* interact
with the body. Not good.

Paraffin and most plastics that have *lots* of hydrogen per carbon atom
are better shielding against particle radiation than is an equal
thickness of metal!

You may still want to have a foil coating for purposes of reflecting
sunlight. More on this below.

Kevlar works just fine. Check out the coveralls that the Apollo
astronauts wore over their suits.

You don\'t need a heat retention layer. You are surrounded by a vacuum.
The *only* way to lose heat is to *radiate* it. In effect, you are in
side a big thermos bottle. Your main problem is going to be getting rid
of the 100 watss of *heat* that each human body generates. (the two
major problems in spacesuit design are keeping the internal pressure
from making it impossible to flex the limbs, and keeping the wearer
from frying in his own waste heat)

Apollo 13 had problems with cold because they had everything shut down
and were trying not to move much, so as to save air. They were also
running a 3 psi oxygen atmosphere, which increases heat loss. If they
could have afforded the air, they could have warmed up by blackening
part of the hull.

Radiation protect won\'t be appreciably increased by another layer.

>The main problem is figuring out how to get it away from a ship in
>degrading orbit (at least put the rescue ball in a stable orbit),

Forget it. One, the *only* way to have a "degrading orbit" is to be low
enough that you are getting appreciable atmospheric drag. Otherwise,
orbits only decay over periods of *weeks* to *years*.

If you are low enough to run into dangerous levels of atmspheric drag,
*nothing* small enough to pack away is going to be able to help you.
Not unless you can mount a Heplar on the lifepod...

So instead, what you want is a *re-entry* pack. NASA and the military
did do some research on thes, though they never got to the point of
testing them in orbit. If the Space Station project happens, they may
test some there.

Basic idea is using something along the lines of the "instant foam" you
can buy in the hardware store. You mix a couple of liquids and they
generate a foam that quickly hardens into a solid but light material.

For a re-entry pod, the foam inflates and solidifies a "bag" of tough
film, The film guarantees the foam assumes the right shape. There\'s an
attached solid rocket motor that you use to de-orbit. A gyro keeps you
oriented so that the foam shield is what takes the re-entry heat. It
burns away at a controlled rate, thus removing the heat from your
vicinity. Once you get slowed down enough, you dump the shield and use
a parachute, CG belt, or other device to reach the ground safely. One
"other device" is a cross between a baloon and a parachute.

Sorry, but that\'s a popular misconception. An engine "pulling" is no
more stable than one "pushing". Either way, the thrust is *always* in
the direction the motor is pointing, and there\'s nothing to keep it
pointing in any particular direction. Trust me on this one. (I could go
into detail, but it\'d take a lot of space).

Assume that a one-man "pod" weighs only 50 kilos. Add in a 200 kilo
passenger (worst case?). That\'s 250 kilos. Now, to get a velocity of
about 30 m/sec (about 67 mph), you are going to need to apply a thrust
of 500 kilos (2 gs!) for 1.5 seconds. So for safety, lets figure on two
seconds of thrust. 500 "kilos" of thrust is 4.9e3 newtons.

Solid fuel gives around 180 seconds specific impulse. So we need 11
kilos of fuel. If the engine has been mishandled, those 11 kilos will
*destroy* the pod... Also, that means that the pod and engine must
weigh only 39 kilos. Workable, but...

>Any ideas on modifications to this design?  Are there any other published
>rescue apparatus out there?

Something else to consider is the "rescue balls" carried on the
Shuttle. They are just an inflatable, airtight fabric and something
ball. They are intended for stuffing unsuited people into so that folks
in suits can transfer them through an area in vacuum (only scenario
where they\'d be of much use is if the Shuttle couldn\'t re-enter for
some reason and we sent up a rescue flight. Only 3 of the crew have
suits. Everybody else would get bundled into a rescue ball for
transfer.

In Traveller, such would be for cases where part of the ship got
decompressed.

Check used bookstores for Lifepod (Lifeboat?) by Harry Harrison and
Gordon Dickson.  It\'s an attempt to prtray folks in a hightech lifeboat.
Also look for Lifeboat by James White. Do note that White makes some
*serious* errors. For example, the way he has people getting rid of the
spin on their pods *won\'t* won\'t. It violates conservation of momentum.

These are the *only* fictional treatments of space "lifeboats" in any
detail. They do get mentioned in passing in other stories, but there\'s
not much detail in most.

BTW, odds are that if you aren\'t in orbit around something, or in
company of another ship, then a lifeboat won\'t be much help in MT or
TNE. Due to the fuel requirements, the odds of getting rescued before
you run out of air or food (water isn\'t much of a problem) are kinda
slim.

So I\'d go for re-entry pods, and rescue balls. For anything else, make
sure that there are *several* ship\'s boats, and that they can hold the
entire crew and passengers between them. Then you have a chance.

If the ship is gonna go "boom", you probably can\'t get far enough away,
or won\'t last long enough to be rescued. Having emergency life support
setups in each section of the ship is a good idea.

 You do realize that this is a standard CT item, don\'t you?  I\'ve got
 the Starter Traveller Rules Booklet here, and on p.42 we find, under the
 heading of Abandon Ship: "A typical vacc suit is capable of one turn\'s
 acceleration at 1-G before it runs out of fuel.  A foamed atmospheric
 re-entry ablation shield (part of the vacc suit kit) can protect the
 individual while entering the atmosphere of a world if his velocity is no
 more than one range band per turn.  Accident or mishap can occur during
 the process.  Throw 7+ to survive provided all else is performed properly..."

I am interested.  I don\'t know how involved you plan to make the program,
but I have a few suggestions.
Include all the hard-science and detail you can handle, with the option of
disabling it for those who don\'t think it\'s necessary.
For example:
1.  Stelllar/system data for a system is used in a newtonian-type simulation
of orbits.  It shows the system graphically and can be used to provide
travel times between planets and to the safe zone for jump (users would
input the maneuver drive and fuel of their ship).  The simulation need not
be graphics-intensive.  A simple mathematical model with colored dots and so
on would do.  The starting positions of the planets could be random or
stored by the program for the next time the system is visited.  See the
shareware program "Newton" for Windows for an example (programmer:  Paul
Keet, 12726 Southridge Dr., Surrey, B.C., Canada, V3X 3C6).  Planets other
than the main world are not in the system profile, but nothing stops you
from randomly generating it, and allowing users to input what they know from
canon (i.e. Regina, Terra) and what they use in their campaign.  In my
opinion, this is a great way to make use of the possibilites in Traveller
system generation.  It saves lots of time in many ways.
2.  Show the most advantageous trade routes (and also just what is the best
system to sell cargo x for highest profit when speculating) by using the
trade codes in the sector data.  This has been done on paper in a JTAS
article before (but takes forever to calculate on paper).  Perfect for
adding extra gaming practicality for players to your program.
3.  Printout or the option to output data to a BMP/GIF or whatever would be
nice.  I\'d be happiest even if only the latter was possible; I can still
print BMPs with other apps.
4.  As noted above, random world/system/sector generation.  Add the ability
to preset some of the parameters so you don\'t have to press the randomize
button a billion times to get what you want.
5.  Can\'t think of more right now, I hope my wish list isn\'t too demanding.
 Oh, and please make it runable with Win 95.  (Was that a stupid thing to
say?)

Um, shouldn\'t the R be distance to the center of mass of the system?

These objects _are_ in orbit around the center of mass, it\'s just that
one of them (presumably) is unbound.

R would still (to first few orders) be the center of the planet though
since the ship doesn\'t do squat to the CM of the system.

I see your point regarding grav. vs. inertial mass for CG calculations
though... odd way to think :-)

Anyway, interesting stuff :-)

Boy, have you swallowed the Imperial propaganda machine. Sure you aren\'t on the
payroll? I bet you believe everything you read in the paper as well. :)

I can\'t believe a media service so pervasive in Imperial society is not censored
in some way by the Imperium. In fact if the Imperium is the sinister society
that Angus claims then it will totally control it. Either way if the imperium
lets some form of genocide go ahead then they\'re hardly going to want the fact
advertised are they?

As to having a published adventure about this sort of thing, it wouldn\'t be
mainstream enough. How many GM\'s are going to want to run an adventure which
will probably end up with their player\'s either knowing too much and on the run
or dead. (On the other hand that particular idea does have its merits :). Also
why would GDW want to publish something which destroys the image of the Imperium
as the good guys and all of the other empires as the bad guys. If  the adventure
was based on a connivance between a corrupt Imperial official and the world then
that\'s a whole different kettle of fish.

The cynics point of view here is that slaughter only goes against 20th century
mores when there is enough public outcry. Therefore, nothing would get done
about the slaughter \'cos there would be no public outcry.

Not only did I participate in a couple of TCS campaigns, I engaged in
extended tests of Eurisko\'s designs, and was a charter member of the "Big
Rock vs. Shiny Wedge Debating Society." :) I know TCS, believe me.

Yes, no admiral would *want* to arrive anywhere with less than full tanks.
Heck, given a choice in the matter, any admiral would also prefer that the
opposing fleet self-destruct when painted with targeting lasers, or better
still, just before his fleet arrives in-system.  Alas, in the real world,
or even the real simulated world, admirals end up forced by circumstances
to fight in suboptimal battles.  A vastly conservative admiral, who never
travels without topping off the tanks, never takes an "all eggs in one
basket" gamble, is a real asset (usually) on the defending side.  On the
offense, this type of admiral quite frankly does miserably.

Traveller technology rewards initiative and rapid movement; the slow speed
of intelligence (equal to the potential rate of advance) means that it\'s
easy to launch devastating surprise attacks.  And given that the defender
has a built-in advantage in an even battle (prepared positions, full
tanks, SDBs, etc.), the only way for the attacker to win strategically is
to concentrate his forces into a few massive assaults, and hope to (a) win
big and (b) redeploy the fleets to cover the resulting gaping holes in his
own lines before the defender can react.  Often, this means hitting deep
-- doing long jumps past the "front line" worlds, which will be most
heavily defended, and hitting a rear area.  And in these circumstances,
the attacking fleet will often arrive with distressingly dry tanks.

There\'s a lot to be said for never letting the attacker relax.  I agree,
the bulk of forces will be deployed to defend the mainworld; but a few
SDBs and the odd escort tucked away in a GG can have a seriously
unnerving effect.  For one thing, it forces the attacker to squander time
and resources "cleaning" the GGs if he wants them as refueling points.
And as Von Clauswitz (sp?) points out, the defender controls space, the
attacker time.  If the defender forces the attacker to slow down, waste
time, then the defender is nullifying the attacker\'s control of the
situation as a whole.  And this has important implications for
"blitzkrieg" style of (strategic) attack I described above.

Comments, anyone?

I see your point, but to an inhabitant of Oz(traylia), the "recent" trend to
the "hard right" in US politics is missing the point. In *Oz* and *European*
terms, US Politics has *always* been further right than we have been prepared
to tolerate ... certainly since WW2, arguable (in some respects only) since
the last century. This is not to say that the system(s) that exist in Oz or
europe are perfect (they\'re not) or that they\'re even "better" than that of
the US (this is, *obviously*, quite contentious), but that they seem to take
better care of the "common man" than the US system does. *Our* "far right"
would support all sorts of social programs that your *liberals* would regard
as out and out communism ... and we seem to get on pretty well.

In Oz (and, so I gather, in many European countries) Unemployment Benefits are
regarded as a *right* ... if the government cannot manage the economy well
enough to provide for close to full employment for all, then I think most
Australians agree that they have a responsibility to provide for a basic
standard of living for those who cannot find work. There *are* those who do
seem to subscribe to the views that you describe below, but, by and large, they
have never had a serious hold on most people\'s attitudes to such things. There
are constant whinges about "dole bludgers" ... but they almost always seem to
be "other people" ... just like many Germans and the Jews, the ones they knew
*personally* were OK, it was the ones that Hitler kept telling them about, you
know, the Zionist Bankers and the like, not Mr. Goldblum in the flat next door.

The attitude you describe here - the "recipient classes" - *seems* to me to
be indicative of everything that the source I mentioned suggested. Perhaps
it is because the US is less democratic than Oz ... in *one* sense. We have
compulsory voting in *all* elections here, from Council to Federal Parliament,
so *everyones* attitudes must be considered by the pollies (or would be
pollies) in Canberra. As I understand it, less than 50% (IIRC) of the voting
age population in the US turns out for a given election, and the majority of
the "recipient classes" are non-voters. *If* they were voters, then perhaps
a different attitude on both their opponent\'s parts and that of the government
would be in evidence. Since, however, they are not a political force, they
can be safely ignored and vilified.

Of course, in Europe they do not have compulsory voting, either, but they *do*
have a strong social welfare system, courtesy of the eurocommunists, and even
the "ruling classes" still have the tradition of "nobless oblige" that those of
the US may have lost, if the theory that I was describing holds any water at
all.

That\'s very debatable. As I said, to *non-US* eyes, US politics has *always*
looked far right wing in respect of our own (Oz or European). I accept that
this means that we, in return, are seen as that terrifying and evil force
(in US terms), the *liberal*. The point I\'m trying to make (*was* trying to
make) is that the US approach is *not*, and never has been, the only one. It
is not even, necessarily, the most *likely* one to be adopted by a furture
Interstellar state.

You see, practical evidence is against your own system being all that great.
*We* don\'t have decaying inner cities spotted with what are basically free
fire zones for drug gangs (OK, I\'m sure both your *and* our media exaggerate
here!); there is no huge underclass (though we\'re not perfect, there *is* an
underclass, but they *seem* to have a better chance and a better "fair go"
than the US *seems* to offer hers); education is free and pretty much equal
for all ... no metal detectors needed to prevent weapons being brought into
*our* schools, not much violence therein, either ... certainly nothing like
the scale that allegedly exists in the US, and no sort of major drug problem
(Im speaking from experience in the latter part, I\'ve been a High School
teacher for twenty years, and, in that time, having taught in country schools,
working class areas *and* upper-middle class areas, I have seen, literally,
less than a *handful* of drug cases at school); we don\'t have walled off
"private" suburbs with razor wire and armed guards keeping out said "recipient
classes", either. No, we\'re far from perfect, but we *seem* to have a better
handle on social policy things than the US *seems* to have.

>  This has nothing to do with Traveller.  Followups to private mail,

Well, actually, it does. I\'m trying to make the point that it is at least as
likely that some form of "eurosocialist" government is going to run many high
tech, high population, worlds as it is that some extreme Thatcherite/Reaganite
style laissez faire capitalist system will. Given that, then it seems likely
that the people on many (if not most) such worlds will, as I suggested, quite
probably have a work week *much* shorter than that which exists here and now,
in *both* our countries. While such social issues are mostly ignored in
Traveller, the potential for impacts on all aspects of the "world of the
future" are much greater than Miller et al have been heretofore prepared to
allow for.

Two points :- there are regional entities - certainly Ilelish and the
"Vilani Cultural Region" are long distinct entities and Antares probably
still retains vague ties to it\'s trans-frontier Julian bretheren. That\'s
three of the major factions already.
Secondly, without Virus the itsy-bitsy states you propose would be
dominated by external powers or absorbed by them in the 70-year
interregnum. Ley and Fornast would be vegetarian heaven, Margaret\'s
former domain would be a de facto client of the Hive Federation, Daibei
would have fallen either to the Solomani or the Aslan, the petty states
of Diaspora and Old Expanses would be at the mercy of the Solomani, Hive
Confederation, Ilelish and rump Lucanic Imperium, Vargr encroachment
will continue into Lishun, Antares and Vland. Rats, Cats, Centaurs,
Sneaks and Doggies dominate the former Imperium from within and without,
using the remaining petty states as pawns and puppets in their struggles
to dominate the entire region.

Surely the point is that the subsector/sector governments and the
resident naval forces are too united by having cousin Fred as sector
admiral, great-aunt Jemima as subsector Duke, uncle Gervaise as a fleet
commander and so on.
The early Roman empire while employing aristos as governors and as
commanders clearly separated the two jobs and ensured that the
aristocratic military commanders were in large measure impotent, with
real power resting with long-service commoners.

Analog for Lucan, hmmm. We want a mercurial, suspicious, temperamental
whirlwind given to reforming an out-of-date Empire. What about Peter the
Great (daft as a brush, given to fits of murderous rage but still an
effective if brutal reformer) ? Lucan might have moved the capital away
from the entrenched interests of Capital and Core to some more backward
sector to provide a tabula rasa for his work. With the threat being on
the Vargr/K\'kree frontier there aren\'t many obvious sites. Somewhere in
the top left of Fornast ? (This assumes that Lucan\'s sudden love for
Sylean culture and language during the Rebellion are a political ploy).

Or Justinian. Leave the capital where it is but begin military reforms
to restore the halcyon days of Imperial military power and complete the
conquest of the Solomani Sphere and other "lost" lands. Although the
Imperium isn\'t quite in the same degree of trouble that the Roman Empire
was when Justinian took over, it still needs fixing.

And that\'s just the straightforward options. In the weird category are
the possibility of Lucan developing some religious conviction and
seeking to convert the Empire to the One True Faith. Or the chances of
him beginning a cultural revolution - breaking all ties with the past,
burn the history books, &c - like the Ancient Chinese Emperors Shih
Huang-Ti or Mao Zedong.

Of course, you are absolutely right....

Since the evidence is as thin as water we need to flesh it out to make
anything of it. But given the number of spooks and assassins crawling
around the Imperial palace that day it is quite possible that Windhook
really was someone\'s agent. It\'s just whose and doing what. Perhaps
Windhook killed Varian because of some grudge and both he and Lucan are
lying. Perhaps he didn\'t kill Varian at all and neither did Lucan. It\'s
impossible to know for sure (just as we weren\'t supposed to know whether
"The Real Strephon" was Strephon or not and the DGP plotlines in MTJ4
suggest that they thought he wasn\'t) what happened in the room.

I think I\'ve written enough for today.

Well, I\'ll repeat myself. There are a whole gamut of cultures on late
C20th Earth from "I\'m all right Jack" consumerist through theocratic
oligarchies to tribal paleolithic hunter-gatherers. Where is the norm ?

If you would like to try and define Judaeo-Christian norms (and this
correspondent considers himself to be neither Jewish nor Christian and
is thus presumably abnormal like the 70+% of his fellow country persons
who could in all likelihood hardly find the nearest place of Jewish or
Christian worship and whose religious encounters are limited to births,
deaths and marriages), we could discuss whether they are meaningful
norms or vague platitudes. Does Pat Buchanan fall within these norms,
does Clinton, what about the KKK, Gerry Adams, hard-line Israeli
settlers ? If they are limited to the things I expect like "be nice to
your neighbour so long as he\'s one of us" and "don\'t kill our sort of
people" then they are not really useful in describing anything since
almost every culture has valued this degree of co-operation amongst it\'s
members, where Judaeo-Christian or Islamic or something else.

>(I seem to remember an article that noted that Imperial Anglic has

So in the hundred plus years before contact and the millennium of the
Long Night there have been no changes in language ? Seems highly
improbable. My personal feeling is that by the C30th Murkin and Stralian
will be different languages and not just dialects. Now some RP version
of the language - Court Galanglic - might exist, but that\'ll be
restricted to the aristos, wannabes and poseurs. The military will need
to employ a standard Galanglic, but the obvious analog - Austro-
Hungary\'s pre-WWI Army German - suggests a language of limited
vocabulary and brutalised construction. Translating the Collected Works
of Shakespeare into Imperial Military Galanglic or A-H Army German seems
like a lost cause. And given moderately efficient translation software
there seems not to be a pressing problem with this language divergence
where cultural interchanged is concerned.

For canonical support, I refer you in particular to p17 of Solomani &
Aslan wherein the languages of the Solomani Confederation are discussed.
Quote [Rim Anglic, the Solomani equivalent of Imeprial Galanglic] is
spoken as a native language only on Terra and the worlds within her
sphere of influence. Many other worlds were settled by Anglic speakers
as long ago as the Interstellar Wars, and in the following periods of
isolation, their dialects evolved to such an extent that they now
comprise separate languages. End quote. That\'s quite clear. There is
also a Terry McInnes (IIRC) article in one of the Best of the Journals.

Add Vargr languages, Vilani, Suerrat, Geonee, Tapazmal and who knows
what other languages and cultures and you have a very polyglot, multi-
cultural Empire.

And why not ? There is no reason to believe that it is necessary for the
Imperium to have a common language except among the aristos and the
military. The Raj managed to have dozens of languages, even among the
Imperial army, although a few (Urdu & Gurkhali top of the list)
dominated. Spotty-faced Subalterns, fresh from Blighty were compelled to
learn the language of their troops and had little prospect of promotion
unless they learned it well. If their soldiers don\'t speak Urdu then
they would have to learn another tongue as well. For those posted to the
NW Frontier to serve with the Scouts there learning yet another language
(Pushtun or something of that ilk) would be necessary. Officers drafted
into the civil administration would probably have to learn yet another
and probably completely unrelated language since in most parts of India
there was more chance of finding an English speaker than anyone who
spoke Urdu or Gurkhali.

The English legal system doesn\'t make any sense to me (nor did it make
sense to Charles Dickens or to many of those unfortunates condemned to
live under it, especially with it\'s arcane rules on house sales) and I\'m
right next door. Phil McGregor has already expressed the common baffle-
ment of us "damn foreigners" with US political culture. Almost all US TV
humour leaves me yawning, and no doubt a great deal of the dross that
amuses me (my current favourite being the Fast Show; brilliant !)
wouldn\'t play well in Peoria. And we all share a common language and
much common history. Imagine what 1000 years of almost total separation
would do !

As for Domain supercultures, the mechanism whereby these could arise
baffles me. What will bring the disparate cultures of Massilia towards a
Massilian superculture ? But I will accept that the regions colonised
under the Third Imperium (and especially Behind the Claw) would be more
culturally homogenous, having a thousand years less to diverge.

The Vilani, I grant, are supposedly innately conservative, thus
predicating a much greater degree of cultural consistency on worlds
heavily settled by the Ziru Sirka. But many Vilani worlds were
supposedly devastated by the plagues and lost almost all contact with
their past, being culturally overwhelmed by Solomani rulers and
settlers. On the whole I will agree that much of the Vilani Cultural
Region will probably be quite alike. But there the common language is
Vilani, not Galanglic.

Anyway, at the risk of being a complete schmuck : why aren\'t we trying
to build a culture in the Imperium ? What are the RICE papers for
(yourself a major contributor) if the Imperium is just Yanks in Space ?
Neither Vilani &Vargr nor Solomani & Aslan nor Darrians nor Droyne nor
the JTAS nor an awful lot of stuff assumes what you are asserting Nilsen
meant in his rambling conclusions to Sneaks & Geeks (and having just re-
read it it just seemed like word soup to me).

No ? Arent\'t the wilds in SAG and PoT "somewhere else", aren\'t the

There is a great deal of evidence to support the idea of cultural
diversity in the Imperium and surrounds and very little at all - a few
sentences at most - to support the idea of Yanks in Space.

Finally, a word from our late sponsors ...

I find this a bit of a problem. Some 38 centuries later, with a varied and
scattered humaniti, with the discovery that there are alien races, with
the discovery that humaniti\'s destiny has been influenced by the
Ancients (a la Erich von Daniken!), with the fact that Terran Judeo-
Christianity (itself only one aspect of 20th century Terran culture...)
would have been intermingled with whatever religious and cultural
outlook the Vilanis had, with all the cultural intermingling and
mutation that will have taken place in such a varied context -
after all this, the morality of 20th century US/Europe is the
dominant moral force in the Imperium?

I find it quite ironic that there are endless (although, I hasten to
add, interesting and informative, esp. to a non-scientist like
myself) debates on TML/XBoat about the scientific veracity of
various parts of the Traveller canon - jump flashes, anti-matter,
bombardment with rocks, jump torps, inertialess drives
etc etc., and woe betide anyone who makes a mistake in
their calculations, or who gets their neutrinos mixed up with their
bosons, because somebody will correct them, sharp-ish.
There is an obvious concern to get the technology right, even
when we are reduced to speculating what the technology of
the far future may be.  I think that there is a common vision of
what the technology <should> be like, and debate centres
around how best to achieve consistency within that overall
framework.

However, this concern for <realism> does not always seem
to extend to the less technological aspects of the Traveller
universe.  I personally (and I stress this is my personal
opinion, if yours differs, please let us know what it is)
find some of the assumptions of the social and cultural
aspects of the Imperium to be rather dodgy.

OK, lets get this out of the way now - in no way do I intend
the following to be construed as being anti-American.  If
anyone takes offence, please e-mail me and I will try and
explain better what I mean, because this is NOT intended
to cause offence.  I find the assumption which is implicit
within TNE (I feel it exists much less in CT) that the
future some 3000 years hence is a macrocosm of
20th century US society to be staggeringly unrealistic,
and to show no grasp of the processes of history.

All the RC materials which I have read seem to me to
be particularly guilty of this.  Much of it reads like an
episode of the A-Team with spaceships.

The  culture of the US, and a Judeo-Christian morality,
are without doubt the dominant cultural paradigm at
the end of the 20th century.  The US <is> truly the world\'s
only superpower, militarily, economically, and, for
good or for bad, culturally. However, some 120-200
years ago, the undoubted superpower was Great
Britain.  At its height the British Empire probably had
more influence on the world than the US does now.
British culture was the dominant force within the world.
Now, less than 2 centuries later, the UK is a small
island uncertain whether or not to integrate further
with the rest of Europe, uncertain of its role in the
world, with an influence still out of proportion to its
size, but not a superpower by any definition.  The
history of humanity is the history of the rise and fall
of empires and the cultures and societies
associated with them.  True, these societies feed
into the ones that are built on their ashes - our society
and culture is influenced by that of the Ancient Greeks
without a doubt - yet no-one would argue that we have
a Hellenistic culture.

The culture of TNE, whether RC or Regency doesn\'t,
IMHO, <feel> different, it doesn\'t <feel> alien to us in
some ways, which I think it should. I\'m sure our culture
would feel alien to a Neolithic tribesman.  There is less
of a gap, both chronologically and in terms of technology,
than there is between us now and the 3rd Imperium and
beyond.  I appreciate that there has to be some kind
of moral and cultural hook which we can hang on to, but
I feel that in most accounts of the Imperium or the RC,
this hook is <too> dominant. Some of the best things
I\'ve seen posted to this list are the RICE papers which
detail worlds which are different, with different social
customs and mores to our own.  Apart from being
interesting reading and excellent works of creativity,
these make me feel that I am reading about a
Universe which is different from our own, a quality
which is in my opinion shared by the best science fiction.
I feel that it lets these down to then assume that the
interstellar framework within which these individual
worlds exist is something ho hum and familiar.

It seems a shame if such creative energy is poured
into this universe, and such great attempts are made to
give it internal consistency, yet the very bedrock on
which the Traveller universe is built, the myriad of
interstellar societies, cultures and customs, is left
as a rather cursory analogue of our own, with a few
bits of Roman history thrown in.

Perhaps the <newness> of the Imperium is to be
found in this protective <warm, fuzzy> nature of the
Imperium that has been discussed on the list
a lot recently.  I have studied international relations
through degree and masters level, and it\'s
certainly not like any large hegemonic empire
I\'ve ever come across ;-)

You can all wake up now.

Hmmm.  Much more free from government rules and regulations?
Perhaps.  Much more free? I doubt it.  Don\'t forget that the employer
of the typical Elizabethan labourer was also free of those pesky
annoying rules and regulations such as health and safety rules.
If workers protested against the conditions in which they worked
then they could probably expect to be treated pretty brutally.
Freedom from regulation does not <necessarily> equate to
freedom.  I\'d rather be a labourer in Liz 2\'s England than in
Liz 1\'s.  Evil is a rather contentious word, but I would argue that
all autocracies are by definition immoral, and that in order to
sustain themselves they usually have to commit evil acts.
Look at, umm, the whole of history.  I guess if we go on with this

Having lived in Europe and the USA, I can make an anecdotal observation
here: Phil is essentially correct. In Europe, the idea that it is OK to
scare citizens with the spectre of "welfare cheats" is ridiculous (sic).
People I knew saw the dole as another tool for income, basically as their
right. This points up the difference in the two positions; in the USA, the
dole is something you receive until you get a "real job" (whatever that
means); in Europe, the dole is seen as an end in itself.

Let me say that I doubt *anyone* on the dole in America can buy lobster,
etc. on the basic amounts received from welfare. In any case, what concern
is it of ours? If welfare truly is insurance, do we carp when someone spends
their husband\'s life insurance on something besides the funeral? Also,
trading food stamps for cash is *illegal*. Not to say that it doesn\'t
happen, but it certainly isn\'t part of the government\'s policy on welfare.

Phil, I would be interested to hear you views (re: Traveller, of course) as
to "noblesse oblige" and Australia. I don\'t know Australian history, but
have you such a tradition? Is it inherited from the UK? Home-grown? Would a
planet with a Rep. Democracy have such traditions simply from being a member
of the Imperium (Tech. Feudalism)? A planet with no nobility (as defined by
the Imperium) or noble tradition would not have such a feeling of "noblesse
oblige". Or would it from Imperial contact?

I disagree. That *is* the problem. US tax rates are some of the lowest in
the world (even including the Third World). I\'m not sure where my stats are
on this, but I can find them if necessary. To boot, we Americans are
clamoring for *lower* taxes. The burden of lower taxes will fall on the
poorest, since their tax relief will be less than the more wealthy classes.
For example, if taxes in the USA fall to 0%, the poorest don\'t benefit (they
already aren\'t paying anything) and the richest get a huge benefit. However,
the poor take a big hit on welfare, since it goes away (no money!).

I also must point out here that many of our (the USA\'s) problems have
nothing to do with economic systems whatsoever. Societal factors rule to a
much greater extent than anyone (especially us) want to admit. I think that
this is true in Traveller as well. If you have lower classes due to societal
factors (e.g. race, religion, etc.) on a world, that world will suffer more
such problems as you put forth, regardless of "noblesse oblige" or
economics. Also, let\'s not forget that "noblesse oblige" (at least, the
English model) came from the English class system. That system was, IMHO,
one of the more arbitrary systems for favoring one class at the expense of
others.  I won\'t even get into French nobility. Let\'s just say that there
was a reason for 1789. Is it possible that the dole was put into place, not
from any beneficent "noblesse oblige", but instead to tell the lower classes
to "know their place", provide them with an reason to do so, and keep them
there? Just speculating, here. After all, one with "noblesse oblige" never
*needs* to take the dole.

This is certainly possible. But the rules, as written, seem to favor a more
capitalistic model (in an American game? No! :)). After all, if I have a
Belter, and he/she strikes it rich, they get a windfall. Also, a world as
based on trade as the Traveller universe must have some pretty sophisticated
markets in place. It has been shown (of course, by American economists),
that capitalism produces the most efficient markets of the currently known
government types.

Anyhow, just my 2Cr worth.

I\'m not so sure that the languages with be as variegated as all that.  Look at
English, for example:  not really a very old language, but it has expanded
rapidly.  If you look at Chaucer\'s Cantebury Tales in the original script, it
is nearly unintelligible to your typical modern English reader.  Skip ahead a
few hundred years and get a copy of Shakespeare.  Some things in there look odd
to your typical modern English reader, but most of the text is understandable,
and the reader actually gets some of the jokes.  A good amount of development
in that time period, but in that time period literacy was limited, and regions
were very isolated from one another.  Now zip ahead to the 1800s; literacy
begins booming in the US and UK.  Lots of books begin to appear, there are
daily newspapaers to educate the masses, and government records are largely
available to one and all.  As literacy has expanded, the changes in the
*structure* of English have slowed or stopped.  There are still changes,
though; regional dialects bring in new ways of pronouncing things, and foreign
languages occasionally contribute a new term.

OK, now bounce ahead to 1920.  Suddenly, radio, records and movies are a very
big thing.  Suddenly, all of these formerly isolated regional groups are being
presented with a common way of pronouncing things.  The regional dialects
remain, but now more than ever they are reduced to regional accents.  As these
three media expand, and gow to include TV, the effect becomes even more
pronounced.  In the UK, suddenly everyone is learning to speak BBC English.  In
the US, kids are drawing a significant level of language skills from TV shows
like Sesame Street or even the evening news.

As things contine through the Traveller history, this trend also continues.
The sheer volume of printed or recorded speech continues to grow, and continues
to be the basis of the language education for future youth.  As other nations
begin to grow economically, tehre will likely be more foreign language terms
being adopted, but the structure of the language will remain largely
unchanged.  The basic vocabulary will be added to, but the bulk of the words
will remain the same.  There will me many different worlds settled by
English-speaking cultures, but they will have already inherited the "language
legacy" in the form of the recordings needed to operate and educate their
society.  They will continue to get more and more such material via
interstellar trade; an isolated planet in the 57th Century is goinmg to get
more information (thanks to computers) from one starship visit than an isolated
11th Centruy rural village might get from 10 years of contact with itinerant
traders and tinkers.   Mr. 57th Century will have no idea what a Washboard is,
but he will know what a board is, and what Wash means.  The things that change
will be the "slang," but that is generally an addition to the basic langauge,
not a replacement.

Please expand this. I need to know what _use_ this information will be put to
before I consider the enormous amount of extra work this would entail. I\'m a CT
ref myself, and haven\'t even seen the rules that generate all this hard science
stuff, so I don\'t have a full understanding of how it would fit into running a
game. And that\'s my main focus. If it makes the game more interesting for
players to adventure in then I\'ll look at it for release 2.0. If it\'s only of
interest to a few hard science boffins then they can stick to "Newton" ( if you
can see my point ).

This is very likely. I\'m talking to another programmer about providing this
feature as either an add-on or as an integral part of the program. Software
mechanics will determine this ( DLLs might work to make it modular ).

Yep. Some kind of output will be supported. Possibly BMP _and_ Printout.

No. I won\'t be doing any sort of generation if I can avoid it. There are dozens
of generation programs out there, and more being mooted every day. My intention
is to allow users to import and display the output of those programs.

Well, it was fairly comprehensive. I think the beta test programme will sort out

For maximum portability purposes this program will be written for Windows 3.1 so

Invasion: Earth blames Styryx for the escalation that led to the SRW, and
for mismanaging the preparations for war.  Among other things, he created
the Vegan Autonomous District in the core of the Solomani Sphere *before*
the war started.  The government intended to use it as a counterweight to
Solomani power, but somehow was stupid enough not to realize that it would
just infuriate the Solomani.  DGP noted that Styryx was forced to abdicate
at the point of a gun after the Imperium so badly lost the 3FW, and the
two events triggered the SRW.  Gavin had to try to work with preparations
that Styryx had made, or failed to make.

Worse yet, after suffering the horrible peace treaty with the Zhodani, the
Imperium had to face an even bigger, more brutal war in the Rim -- in fact,
this may have something to do with why the 3FW went so poorly.  Estimates
of Solomani population in the 1100s suggest that in population, the Sphere
may have been half to two-thirds the size of the entire Imperium without it,
due to the fact that sector population density goes up in Solomani space.
I suspect that the rimward parts of the Confederation are less dense than
the coreward, and the Imperium seems to have had a slight technological
advantage -- the worlds in Massilia that were tech-16 in 1115 were almost
certainly tech-15 during the Solomani Rim War.

SOLOMANI RIM Analysis, circa 1115.

Third Imperium (not including the VAD)
  279 worlds
  Average TL enjoyed by populace: 13.9
  Approximate Population: 1.25 trillion
  Fraction of Sector Population: 3/4
  Population density: 4.48

  There are eight tech-15 worlds with a class-A starport and a population in
  the tens of billions -- four, Terra, Dingir, Lagash, and Sebasta are in or
  very near the old Solomani core.

Solomani Confederation
  91 worlds
  Average TL enjoyed by populace: 13.3
  Approximate Population: 270 billion
  Fraction of Sector Population: 1/6
  Population density: 2.96

  They have no major tech-15 worlds, and only three tech-14, class-A starport,
  very high population worlds, all in the Bootean Federation.  While this
  region looks sparse here, in the Domain of Deneb it would be considered to
  be quite advanced technologically and densely settled.

Vegan Autonomous District (Third Imperium)
  30 worlds
  Average TL enjoyed by populace: 14.9
  Approximate Population: 174 billion
  Fraction of Sector Population: 1/10
  Population density: 5.80

  An astonishingly sophisticated region nominally under Imperial control, and
  vital strategically to the Imperial presence in the sector.  Three-quarters
  of the population of the VAD is crowded onto four tech-15, class-A starport
  worlds, three of which are Vegan and one of which is human.

TOTAL sector statistics (all allegiances, all worlds):
  400 worlds
  Average TL enjoyed by populace: 13.9
  Approximate Population: 1.69 trillion
  Population density: 4.23

As usual, population density is a measure of what the population of each world
would be, were the entire population of the region analysed spread evenly among
all worlds in the region, in billions.  Given 9000 systems in the Imperium, and
a total population of fifteen and three-quarter trillion, we get an average
Imperial population density of 1.75, so this sector is much denser than is
usual.

Nope. What you see up there is the law of gravity as originally

But that has no bearing on the *force* between them. The could be
passing by each other at 1% of c, and the force would be the same.

Not really. In fact, physicists have gone to considerable trouble to
try and determine whether inertial mass and gavitational mass are the
same thing. So far, they\'ve proved that they are identical to at least
1 part in 10 to the 23rd or so...

A>1.  Stelllar/system data for a system is used in a newtonian-type

As you know, planets aren\'t always in conjunction, so a model of their
orbits and where they are at present is necessary (I think) to compute
travel times.  The graphics are just to help the user visualize the system.
 With HePLaR (sic) and the slowing of intra-system travel in TNE, computing
travel time becomes increasingly important.  The characters may have to make
an in-system jump to get from the gas giant to the mainworld, for example,
if the travel time by maneuver drive is greater than a week or so.  This
whole thing about travel time could be important to gamers because it would
tell them quickly how much game time they have to use in a system doing
certain things, and how much fuel they need to procure or buy.  It would
save on the bookkeeping and math that slows the game when the facts become
necessary.  I assume that would be often, if the characters travel a lot.  I
think others can think of more reasons.

Also as you know, the system data, other than homeworld/star data, is not in
the sector data you\'re talking about using in your program.  Incorporating a
random/selective generator for this info will quickly make it available to
players.  If the program saved the data, then it could be reused, and the
players would be able to flesh out their gaming area of whatever sector in
an easy and consistent way.  Most of this info has not been published
officially, so you wouldn\'t have any canon-violations.  Those very few
systems that have been published could be inputted directly by the user if
needed.  The extra info your program would generate would enrich a campaign.
 I would be happy because it would allow me to easily take advantage of the
extra background info I could give the players, and I could use the info to
flesh out my adventures.  Now, I don\'t generate systems much because it\'s so
time consuming.

The reason I think you should incorporate this into your program is because
it would take the data from prepublished sectors one level higher, so to
speak.  Your program would read the available sector data and then, when
called for, flesh out the system quickly and easily for players to use in
their campaign.  It would make the sector data even more useful.

Another idea:  The trade codes for mainworlds can also be applied to the
rest of the planets in the system.  In that way, you can compute the best
trade routes not only among mainworlds, but also including the available
planets in those systems.  You could even compute the best trade route
within a system.  This would expand the options of players running
merchantile operations.

The rules used to generate all the information I speak of were first made
available in the Scouts book for CT.  Currently, you can find the info for
TNE in the main book and in World Tamer\'s Handbook.  Absolutely all the
information you need is there in the form of charts and random die roll
tables.  This information and the sector data might change in format, for
all I know, with the release of the new Traveller edition, whenever that
happens.

S>There are dozens of generation programs out there, and more being mooted
every day. My S>intention is to allow users to import and display the output
of those programs.

For example, which programs and where can I get them?  I haven\'t seen any.
 I\'d like it if they ran in Windows.

Does anybody know if the Traveller sector data/rule hypertext program that
GDW was advertising for TNE recently ever became a reality?  Is it any good?
 Is it still being sold?  Where can I get it?

Likewise for Ogzuekhfos sector (immediately trailing of Trenchan).

People have been saying how a TL 11-12 MD can outclass higher tech high energy
weapons.

I dont think that its right to use discarding sabot modifiers for mass driver Pen
calculations as there is no sabot to discard.

DS rounds use the light sabot so that the guns energy for a CPR gun is transferred
to a smaller more aerodynamic dart.  The muzzle energy is dependent on the propellant
only.   However since v=SQRT(2*(Kinetic Energy)/m) and m is smaller v is larger.
Thus greater penetration compared to say a ball round.

However mass drivers are defined by velocity not energy (at least in FFS)
The way FF&S does is to treat all guns equally regardless of type.

What I do for balance is to not use DS multipliers but still use multipliers
for increased
hardness of high tech materiels.
Just look at the table, I use the HVAP multiplier as the basis for MD rounds
and figure out
what the multiplier would be for increased hardness of the penetrator.

You may not agree but it makes sense to me and I use it.

I think its quite legitimate.

The two examples are not comparables. An admiral dosen\'t have the choice of

he jumps around.

I suppose we really need the imput of someone who has run a lot of TCS
campaigns. I admit that I\'ve only seen things from the side of a guy planning
a couple of fleets. The possibly disastrous consequences of jumping dry into
an enemy system (total loss of your whole fleet) seems to me to outweigh most
potential gains from gaining an extra parsec once in a while (obviously
arguments must be in quite general terms when we don\'t know the specific
stellar neighbourhood).

But you only have to mess up one time to loose when you play it that way. A
cautious admiral can run away and fight another day.

But how can he win big when, as you say, the defenders fleet is tanked up
and able to flee if the attacker is too strong?

As long as you arrive with fuel enough for a jump-1 you can get away
(assuming you\'re not playing with the ability to track jumping ships).
I always like to spend my peacetime days laying out massive deepspace fuel
depots. One of those babys close to an enemy planet can do wonders for
your offensive.

Either you use only a few, which means the opponent can toast them with only
a few of his own ships, or you leave a sizable number, in which case the
opponent will destroy a sizable amount of your assets. It may be cost-
effective in so far as you\'ll destroy more ships than you lose, but the
ships left in the Gas Giant must be manned by suicide crews.

Also, the attacker can concentrate on cleaning out one bit of the Gas Giant
(those are big suckers, after all) which means that only a tiny fraction
of the ships hiding in the Gas Giant will ever get a chance at an enemy
ship (hmmm... OK, perhaps the crews dosen\'t have to be suicidal. A 1 in
(how many? 10? 20?) chance of being in the area the attacker actually uses
aren\'t bad odds for survival.)

Well, call me picky, but I can\'t see whereabout in the RSB or Hivers &
Ithklur Dave Nilsen says "The Imperium is Yanks in Space" or something
remotely like that. If Alvin could provide page numbers, I could check
it up and, if need be, concede graciously. I have reread the material
briefly and can\'t find this magical sentence, but perhaps I\'ve just
missed it. It wasn\'t wasted effort as Sneaks & Geeks did contain the
priceless words of unwisdom at the end of this post.

This brings a general point up :- Alvin\'s argument as a whole is based
on the assertion that the Imperium "isn\'t like that". I\'ve suggested a
variety of sources that support my thesis, but there have been none
provided to support the Plummerite view. Without some evidence to the
contrary I see no reason to change my views in the least.

Look forward to a reply.

And Hermann Goering ? Fat Reichsmarschall "Call me Meyer" supposedly
said, "Whenever I hear the word culture, I reach for my revolver". Might
be a widely shared opinion on the list before too long.

No, I haven\'t got anything better to do with my time today. It can\'t
make up it\'s mind outside if it\'s sleet, snow, rain or hail or any
combination of these. There\'s a real danger of getting my eye put out by
hailstones bouncing off the road if I go outside.

It\'s a pity that GDW hadn\'t picked an identical English and Spanish
subtitle for Traveller, "un futuro distante" which could be read as "a
far future" not the Englsh version\'s "the far future". That way all the
arguments about "realistic" technology could be demolished in the one
sentence :- "It\'s the future of a past that never was". Since
cosmologists are quite certain that hyperspace can\'t exist in the
Traveller form (and having just read Kip S. Thorne\'s Black Holes and
Times Warps I am on fairly firm ground. Basically, Thorne says that an
wormhole drive (Asimovian hyperdrive, Pournellian Alderson drive) might
just be possible with sufficiently advanced technology but a Traveller
style jump drive ain\'t), Traveller is set in not only in the/a future
but in a universe where different physical laws apply. So if one set of
laws is different, why not others ? Reactionless drives are possible
(insert pseudoscientific explanation of your choice), black globes are
real forcefields (ditto), neutrino detectors work und so weiter.

It seems a pitiful waste of effort, inevitably doomed to be proven wrong
within a few years of completion, to try and create "realistic" C57th
technology on the basis of our very limited understanding of the
universe. Even if the experts in every field were consulted (rather than
relying on pop science books and those a decade out of date - see the
biblio for FFS) we\'d have no idea what the future could be like.

Stuff reality; let\'s have an internally consistent system that feels
right. There is no problem fussing over the mechanics of space flight -
that\'s all well understood. But wasting time worrying about meson guns
and jump projectors is pointless.

Finally, look at science fiction writing. Most would-be hard SF is
indigestible pap which concentrates on technology at the expense of plot
and character. Good soft SF concentrates on people. I would remind you
that roleplaying has (or should have) more in common with soft SF than
hard SF. The middle ground in SF is generally occupied by Space Opera,
of which David Weber\'s Honor Harrongton stuff strikes me as an above
average example in terms of internal consistency between plot and
technology. SO (not Phil\'s game, the genre as a whole) should be full of
fast action and larger than life characters. Same with an RPG. I don\'t
suppose that very many SF authors ever lost sleep over Heisenberg\'s
Uncertainty Principle or the Second Law of Thermodynamics.

** RANT MODE ON **
What we don\'t need is something filled with doom, gloom and porno-

Stirling. The latter\'s Draka books, of which Alvin Plummer mentioned
Drakon - hopefully the last ever - as an example of technology in SF in
his missive to Mark in TML606, being just about the most unspeakably
tasteless and badly written rubbish that I\'ve ever seen. I managed about
40 pages total - mostly culled at random to see if it really was as
terrible as it seemed - out of the first three volumes (say 800 pages)
at which point I stopped for fear of dying of apoplexy induced by the
sheer uselessness and banality of the tripe I was reading. I\'d rather
read a year\'s worth of the Volkische Beobachter, the collected speaches
of Adolf Hitler or every stupid or tasteless posting ever made to
alt.revisionism than another page of that. I can\'t even begin to imagine
a suitable fate for the author of this stuff, and I\'ve got a pretty
vivid imagination. Stuff like that might attract the sad gits that play
Vampire, but we\'re probably better off without them until they get over
their angst-ridden slacker adolescence.

I see no reason why a shrewd commander could use a could of squadrons of
SDBs (maybe 12), and maybe one or two large missle frigates to do a fair
amount of damage to an intruder.  Gas Giants are huge places from a human
point of view.  Jupiter has, what, ten moons?  And a small ring?  There\'s
a lot of room there for a small resupply/refueling depot to get hidden in
there.  Put EM Masking on the ships (as well as super-EM Masking on the
base) to further hide them.  Stick them in the bottom of a crevase on one
of the GG\'s satellites.  Better yet, you could use two bases to reduce
the risk of compromising the whole force in the event that a base is
uncovered.  Intelligent placement of the bases on a satellite with a
favorable orbital pattern would allow a large passive EM array to keep
tabs on the intruder\'s refueling efforts and fleet disposition.  Or if
one really wants to spend the money, one could just plop a couple Big
Guns in the GG\'s ring.

I\'m not saying that this wouldn\'t be a dangerous job, but if you stick
the best in the business in you small GG defense fleet and train to hell
and back in guerrila tactics, the intruders losses are gonna be
appreciable.  And if you wanted to cut the losses of the GG force, just
switch them to recon duty.  When the intruder force shows up at the main
planet, the native force will have a lot of accumulated data on the
opposing forces strengths/etc.

Just my $.02

I guess the trick is that this requires SDBs that can actually hurt
CruRons and BatRons.  Traveller, regardless of the flavor makes this
kind of hard.  Since a lot has been made of GG refueling in traveller
(in the canon) I\'d like to see some rationale for the vulnerability of
ships while refueling in the combat rules (for TCS this would seem
useful)).

We used to assume that _any_ maneuver hit on a ship that was skimming
was a kill.  Same for PP, Mdrive and Spine criticals.  Something like
this would help make sense of this (IMO).

I wouldn\'t say that the SDBs would have to "hurt" the ships in the
massive destruction sense.  Rather, one would assume that the GG
intruder-harrying force is primarily a recon/guerilla force.  So the SDBs
don\'t destroy any ships.  They can still destroy sensor arrays, put holes
in <fill-in-your-favorite-thruster> chambers, they could jam
communications, you name it, to disrupt the C3D concept that the RSB
seems to love.  At any rate, a tight be laser/maser/meson radio
transmittion of reconissance data from the GG will reach the mainworld
faster than the intruder fleet any way you cut it, giving the native
fleet more time to prepare, which would ultimately give the native fleet
an appreciable advantage.

True enough in many cases - although the fact that the TV news here is
in fairly RP accents hasn\'t made this correspondant change his accent a
whit nor will it; he still uses glottal stops (*) in the middle of words
and all manner of other non-RP things. But, in an interstellar milieu
these are the very forces which will force local dialects further apart
to become distinct languages. Give any world a few centuries of
isolation during the Long Night and, ultra-conservative society or not,
language drift will produce a new language.

(*) The glottal stop is an essential feature of Scots English and you
can try it at home in safety. Just pronounce butter, letter or any other
word with a t-sound in the middle without the t-sound keeping the second
vowel sound as a distinct schwa :- bu\'er, wa\'er, be\'er, le\'er, me\'al,
se\'er and so on.

English, due to it\'s volatility in the period of Chaucer and thereabouts
is perhaps a bad case to take. Let\'s try French. I have dug out a copy
of a mediaeval French poem, Le Couronnement de Louis, which the cover
tells me is a "chanson de geste du XIIe siecle". The text dating to
circa 1130 is moderately comprehensible even to someone with my rather
dismal level of French. However, there is limited likelihood that a
modern French speaker would understand the original spoken form of the
poem. Written and spoken forms of a language change at different rates.
Five hundred years of change might leave the written forms of two
languages quite close, but ought to be enough for the spoken forms to be
but vaguely comprehensible.

Even the Shakespeare example isn\'t that good. As I understand it, the
rhyming and metre employed in of Shakespeare\'s verse suggests different
pronunciations for many words. In fact, I seem to recall that the same
applies to Pope as well (e.g. tea as tay and not tee).

The bottom line on language change is something like this :- if there is
a huge level of cultural interchange between worlds of the Imperium and
if the millennium of the Long Night resulted in no large-scale changes
in spoken forms of languages, then and only then is there no language
variation in the Imperium. If only one or neither of these is true there
will be large degree of language variation.

Digressing ...

If English were to be the language of the future, it wouldn\'t be the US
variant. English would only succeed as a true lingua franca if it
retained and increased it\'s popularity in the Third World. That means
continuing as an non-racial common language in India, gaining popularity
in China and continuing to dominate non-Francophone Africa. But any idea
that everyone, everywhere is going to speak English is simply
wrongheaded. The Spanish-speaking and Francophone worlds have no
apparent desire to change, and why should they ? (And even the US
appears to be as likely to be a Spanish-speaking nation as an Anglophone
one, given time).

Of course, not every language changes over time or distance. Latin today
is identical to the Latin written by Cato and Virgil and identical to
the Latin written in C16th Poland - where it was the written and spoken
language of government and of culture. The Latin lyric of the Gorecki
Miserere playing in the background as I write this would be perfectly
understandable to Cato or Copernicus. Because Latin is a "dead" language
not learned in infancy it is stable. Were Imperial Galanglic uniformly a
second language learned after infancy, it too could be stable and
uniform over time and distance.

The argument isn\'t really about language alone as Ian Rowan notes in
Digest 609. It\'s about language and culture and the improbability of
homogenity across one world, let alone across hundreds or thousands.
Anyone who imagines that this world is in any way culturally homogenous
can never have travelled very far from home nor read much nor watched
anything other than soaps and Hollywood movies on TV.

On the contrary; it is eminently workable.  Compared to the IN, ISS,
or any of the other agencies, this is probably a completely trivial
segment of the imperial workforce, and is about the minimum needed
to deal with the normal workload of imperial interest crime and
with local emergencies  (i.e., shiploads of crazy PCs).  Given the
importance of prompt enforcement of the Imperial and High Justice
laws should they be violated, the MoJ cannot afford to leave
any system unmonitored.

This is not an unreasonable statement, and I can go along with it to
a large degree.  But I think you misinterpreted my article.

There was a subtle undercurrent in the article which appears to
have been too subtle.  The civil rights situation in the Imperium
is not nearly as strong as the US today (that much is evident from
reading the first section of the article).  It is in fact weaker than
that section of the article would be read on first inspection.
Note that local governments can supress some rights, and often do.
Also, note the lack of criminal laws covering civil rights violations.
While frowned upon, such violations by authorities are not really
handled within the legal system.  As severe violations break down the
trust bewteen the population and the Imperial nobility and government
and agencies, most agencies have internal rules against abuse without
very good reason, and the Nobility will act (even against its own members)
if they percieve that rights violations are destabilizing the local
situation.  But there is nothing similar to the civil rights laws
we have in the US today.

This is basically correct.  Please re-read the article; these are, with
a couple of exceptions, either local or recognized law areas.  The Imperial
MoJ does not get involved in local law (except as its field agents find it
convenient), nor in recognized law to any large degree.  Their only activities
in recognized law cases are, in coordination with local authorities in the
current planet of residence, aprehending those who have arrest warrants
pending for recognized crimes.  They do not prosecute them and are not
generally involved in investegating them, they merely assist in the
aprehention and extradition process, if that.

The exceptions are the Imperial Crimes of murder and kidnapping;
these are specifically stated to be enforced only on starships and
extraterritorial installations.  Activities like that on starships
and starports and the like *are* threats to the interstellar trading
system...

Theft, embezzlement, and fraud are bad for business but easily handled
by local laws and/or the smuggling and great theft recognized laws.
Smaller incidents are not of imperial purview.  If everything that
was bad for business was illegal at the Imperial level there would
be no end to the legal system being pulled into the trade wars which
break out from time to time.  A more lassiez-faire attitude exists,
so that only significant breaches of the trade peace are acted on
by Imperial authorities (instead of locals).

Most of these are not issues of interest to Traveller campaigns,

I *strongly* disagree with this sort of take on who is the responsible
police force.  There are a number of Imperial Crimes which are very
important to the ongoing function of the Imperium; leaving this up
to the varied competence and strength of local installations is most
unlike the Imperial way of doing things.  Whenever there is something
of significant interest to the Imperium, and the stability of trade
and avoidance of things like great assault definitely count,
the Imperium makes a central ministry or service to handle it
in a standard and accountable (to the Emperor) manner.  Hence the
formation of the Ministry of Justice.  It is far too much to ask
that every starport administrator, every ship commander be good
enough to deal with the vagarities of serious crimes, investegating
them, aprehending serious criminals, etc.  That calls for a professional
law enforcement organization, not difuse authority.

Eh.  The MoJ has authority over all of these, but things like counterintel
work and the like are handled in cooperation with Naval Intelligence and
the other varied intel agencies.  The Imperium does not have a single
unified "secret police" organization; the MoJ handles what it can on
the mostly-criminal-and-threat-to-trade side, the Navy handles military
threats to the peace (NI) and probably is tasked with diplomatic work,
the Scout Service intel branch keeps an eye on things which might get
missed by the more formal investegations, etc.

As for food stamps: in Anchorage AK, USA, 1 adult male (myself) got $185.00
per month for food; I couldn\'t eat $185 in food per month without buying
steaks or "specialty food items"; I did not recieve cash back in excess of
$1.00 per transaction; I did not have the ability to buy from the Deli at
the supermarket. I am no longer on the dole, and now can barely afford to
feed myself AND my wife, as we only have $70-90 after bills.

Such a stiuation may arise on various imperial worlds; I have always left
that up to the individual worlds, with an imperial level insurance program
available; for a nominal fee, usually with matching funds from the local
world (or the service branch); the monies placed in collect 1% interest,
and pay a stipend of cr500 per month until the funds run out. It\'s
optional. It\'s easy. The character has the option. It\'s THEIR MONEY, so
there is no restriction on drawing it other than they have their reciepts,
and can prove that they are not working for the month previous. No
Handouts, just investments in the future. Some use it as a retirement plan,
so be it. So long as they aren\'t working, fine!

Case in point: Look at some of the words we use now in our "global
village".  "Karaoke" for instance popped straight into the English
language with very little change (I\'m not a linguist--but that\'s what
I\'ve read and noticed).

Well, with all languages there a various dialects.  Classical Latin
pronounces the "v" as a "w" and doesn\'t have a "j", whereas Medievel
Latin (dominated by the Christian Churches) pronounced the "v" in the
modern sense.  From what I\'ve read, Classical Latin is more complicated
than Medievel and Enlightenment Latin, most likely because, even though
they are both "formal" Latin, the Classical writers spoke and had an
understanding of "colloquial/dialectic" Latin, of which we know little.

I agree, however, with the increased global flow of information one can
see a definite path towards homogenity, as a side effect of the global
economy.  Multinational corporations seek to break down the cultural
barriers, or at least manipulate them for an increased market share.  And
that\'s just one influence on cultural exchange.  Step back and look at
the major cultures of the world--one can see a definite cultural
whiplash, as dominant cultures trying to assimilate subordinate cultures
are affected by the cultures they try to squish.  I can dig up more
evidence of this process if anyone is interested in an intellectual
discussion on this subject.

But in regards to the Traveller setting, this might tend to break down as
information is slowed by the limitations of FTL travel and a lack of FTL
communications in "canon" Traveller.  My knowledge is only of TNE,
however, I would expect this cultural whiplash phenomenon to be present
to a diminished extent in any government of the scale/intensity of the
Imperium/Regency.

Well, I\'m a hard science boffin when it comes to planetary systems, but I
see your point. However, I\'m also a gamemaster, so I\'ll explain how I
actually use it. First, though, I\'ll point out all this "hard science
stuff"
is mostly from (black) Book 6: Scouts (copyright 1983), with elaborations
by DGP in Grand Survey, both CT products.

The use is for fleshing out both the mainworld and the rest of the system.
The extended system data is one of the tools I use to give my players
a sense of travelling to a _place_ rather than to the "faceless NPC planet"

that can result from going by the UWP alone.

I also think that software that makes it _easier_ to incorporate (and,
above
all, USE) more system data is what will take it out of the hands of the
boffins, who at present are the ones willing to slog through everything
with paper, pencil, and calculator. I\'d _love_ to have it more user-
friendly.

And some things I wasn\'t boffin enough to do, like keep track of
the relative positions and distances to other planets (important for
GG refueling and visiting off-the-mainworld colonies), or keep track
of planetary seasons (so I know when it\'s the middle of winter at the
starport the PCs are going to). These things let me add detail and
color without always having to do so arbitrarily.

Actually, a "detailed planet and star system" is probably another
program in its own right. However, I would like a sector-level
program like the one you are working on to be able to have
a detailed system program as an add-on, and to work with the
data therein (like calling up all the UWPs for all the inhabited
worlds in a system, not just the mainworld).


> >2.  Show the most advantageous trade routes [and elaborations]
>
> This is very likely.

Good. This is one of the things that mapping software is _for_.


Now for my own request, which has to do with how the data is
displayed. I\'m tired of maps that go where the grid is instead of
where the planets are. I\'m tired of "the universe stopping at the
edge of the map." I want software that will USE the capabilities
of a computer to overcome this better than I can with a pencil
and custom-made hexmap. Therefore, I want:

1) a floating map. I want to click on Extolay/Lanth, hit \'Center\'
          or something, and SEE that it connects branches of the
          Spinward Main into Vilis and Regina subsectors, and that
          two parsecs away in Jewell subsector is a planet people
          and goods might want to go to. I _don\'t_ want a map of
          just Lanth subsector.

2) the capability to vary the size of the map. Sometimes a slightly
          larger map suits my needs, and I\'d like to make it 10x12, or
          16x20 instead of 8x10 parsecs. Same on the small side.

3) to answer the question: "What if I do (1) and/or (2) and the map
          extends into another sector?" Or up to three other sectors
          if you\'re at one of the corners. I want to be able to map
          data from more than one sector at once, since planets at the
          edge of the map shouldn\'t arbitrarily be cut off from worlds
          only one parsec away just because they\'re on the wrong side
          of the sector border.

Would it be that hard to assign sectors some sort of "supercoordinate"
to tell the program where the sectors relate to each other, so then it
can do the mapping job? And a grey blotch labelled "Data Not
Available" showing up on the map if, perchance, the data is NOT
available.

Iain et al have raised some fascinating points recently regarding the
Imperium as warm and fuzzy, totalitarian and cruel, or (perhaps most
interesting) simply a projection of current Western/American sociology
and morality -- "America writ (very) large."

I will be the first to admit that the degree to which the Imperium and
its satellite cultures resemble 20th century industrialized western Terra
is ludicrous, just as the degree of technological change is ridiculously
small for the period involved.  Were I writing a science fiction novel
set in a future history paralleling the Traveller mythos, the technology
would be (a la Clarke) indistinguishable from magic, and the sociology
and morality exotic to the point of incomprehensibility.  And therein
lies the problem.

Look at the published body of far-future SF.  It falls pretty neatly into
two categories.  In the first, the sociology is modeled very closely on
present or past Terran examples, and the technology is kept relatively in
the background -- Asimov\'s Foundation Trilogy is the classic example, or
see also Herbert\'s Dune.  Even Niven\'s "Known Space" sequence has this
character -- the tech is mostly "gosh, wow, lookit this cool gizmo!",
rather than integrated into the lives and viewpoints of the characters,
and the cultures are solidly 20th-century Terran.

In the second category, society is utterly changed, and frequently
technology is at the Clarke "magic" point.  And in virtually every such
case, the author finds some excuse to insert a 20th-century western
observer into the narrative, so there\'s somebody ignorant around, giving
an excuse to explain everything as it happens.  Greg Bear\'s "Eon"
sequence and Huxley\'s "Brave New World" are two examples that spring to
mind.

My point is that an RPG virtually has to fall into the first category.
You can\'t roll up some characters and then start the first scenario by
saying "The strisna from metalevel gamma suddenly impinges on your outer
telepresent arcana.  What do you do?"  In order to have some reasonable
sense of what\'s possible, what things mean, and how to behave, characters
must be immersed in a culture and technology reasonably similar to what
their players inhabit.  And as a result, a playable SF RPG background is
going to look like Rome, or America, or some other well-known model, and
the tech is going to look suspiciously like 20th-century tech with a few
well-defined extensions.  Nobody will argue that this is at all likely to
be what the future looks like.  But what the future *will* actually look
like is almost certainly too incomprehensible to make useful game
background.

What he\'s asking for is a "realtime" *map* of the system. And you\'d
better believe it\'s necessary. How else are the players going to be
able to figure out *how* to get from one planet to another inside the
same system. Even in CT, most of this info exists (Book 6 Scouts).

Look at the situation with Earth and Mars. At closest approach, they
are only .6 AU apart. At farthest, they are not only 2,6 AU apart, but
the sun is *directly* between them.

Planetary orbits do get ugly to calculate, but if you restrict things
to circular orbits, then the calcs you\'d need for the map (and
associated "course plotting" aids) are pretty simple.

And in some systems, this sort of thing will even affect merely going
out to the 100 diameter limit to jump, simply because the planet is so
close to the star that you have to go to the *star\'s* 100 dia. limit.

>If it\'s only of interest to a few hard science boffins then they can

Except that I\'d bet that entering the Traveller data into "Newton"
would be a *royal* pain, and you might not even be able to save the
"results" in a way that is useful for *gaming*.

And Newton isn\'t likely set up for astrogation, and almost *certainly*
has no idea about things like the 100 diameter limit.

The problem here is that there\'s no standard format for *storing* some
of the data from a system generator in machine readable format. So
unless you want the users to type in all of it by hand, you\'ll either
have to make a deal with someone writing a system generator or at least
restrict your program to working with the output of just a few of them.

Unfortunately, I can\'t *run* Windows 3.1. I can just barely run 3.0,
and it generally isn\'t worth it on this system.

You might consider making the Mark 1, Mod 1 version a "text" only
version under DOS.

If I could find an HTML editor that ran under DOS, I\'d be writing up a
hypertext document for most Traveller stuff. One starting point would
be a graphic of the entire galaxy. Click on that, and the picture fills
the screen, with markings indicating "known" space. Click on that and
you get the map of known space (plus some extras). Then you can click
on whatever it is thaty they call those 4-sector groups. Then on
sectors, subsectors, hexes, etc. All the time with a sidebar giving
info on whatever is showing... Ideally, it\'d go all the way down to
street maps for the places you have them.

Another entry point is the library computer. Just take all the library
entries, TNS items, etc, etc and link them up.

You seem to have overlooked what I say in the second paragraph above. Gas
Giants _are_ big places. Which is why the odds are that one or two such
squadrons wouldn\'t even get a chance to harrass the refueling attacker.
The attacker dosen\'t have to spread his fleet out over the whole Gas Giant,
after all. He can concentrate on one bit of it.

I feel that that is debatable in real life terms and I don\'t see how it
follows from the Traveller Ship Combat rules.

No, I agree that GG\'s are very big places, I\'m just saying that even with
modern electronics we can track the moon landers, etc, so what do they
have in the 57th, chopped liver?  I\'m just suggesting the idea that they
will be able to track large fleet more easily in the 57th, especially if
they are doing the watching from one (preferably two) opposing satellite
orbits (for maximum coverage).  And once they know where a fleet is, the
rest is purely logistics and tactics.

My whole point is that it should be, but it isn\'t.  What tactics will
work for this (choose from HG, MT, or BR/BL) defense?  I\'d add that
we\'re talking about SDBs vs. a BatRon refueling.

GG refueling is said to be a vulnerable time, but according to our
various rules sets, we can\'t duplicate this danger without adding house
rules.

When mechanics like this slow a game down, it\'s time to ask why they\'re there at
all. I\'ll explain why I don\'t bother with this level of in-syetem detail below.
Consequently I have no immediate plans to include this level of detail in my
program _UNLESS_ I get a lot of mail from those who use it in their games.

This is a good idea, as long as it can be set up as an elective option,
preferable as an add-on product.

I see where you\'re coming from, and maybe this could be included as an add-on
modle later, but for now it\'s not where I going. See my explanation below.

Personally, ( while I again see where you\'re going with this ) I don\'t see any
difference between running in-system or inter-system commerce. Travaller started
with the premise of adventurers travelling between star-systems within a
subsector and doing things like trading, etc. This fosters James Kirks "Let\'s
see what\'s out there" attitude. In-system commerce, while more economically
logical, and technologically possible, fosters a stay-at-home mentality. I know
there\'s a problem with the way the canon Traveller maps lay out jump-routes so
that it\'s virtually impossible to even leave home in a jump-1 ship ( and hard to
leave the subsector in a Jump-2 ship ) but this merely stretches the imagination
of the referee. Create space-stations to act as halfway points / fuel dumps if
you have to. Give the players a bigger ship. Whatever seems sensible to make
things work out.

My first few years refereeing Traveller were spent studying rule books, and
pronouncing things impossible if the rules didn\'t cover them ( or the maps
didn\'t show them). Now, I consider such behaviour plain dumb. If something
doesn\'t make sense in the published material ( especially in view of your
campaign ) then find an imaginative solution. Canon doesn\'t have to restrict you
from doing what you need to do. It\'s your game. Make it work.

I have the Scouts book, but I\'ll reiterate my position ( at present ). I\'m not
planning to do any generating of data at all. Obviously different users will
want different features ( as is always the case ) and if I try to build
something that\'s all things to all people then it will never see the light of
day. So what I\'ll do is build a program that displays CT sector data in a way
which is useful to most referees ( especially new ones ) and then look at
in-system data and orbital displays. For my money, this level of detail has no
bearing whatsoever on the game in that it is effectively just adding more
destinationswithin a given area. It doesn\'t even eliminate jumps from the
equation, but instead makes life harder for everyone by allowing micro-jumps
which require even more computations.

This is, of course, my personal opinion, but considering the hassle involved in
implementing this level of detail for every system visited in a gaming
situation, and the enormous overhead imposed on both players and referees in
keeping track of it ( without a computer anyway ), and the lack of published
support for the concept ( apart from the rules which I\'m sure fall into the
category of "seemed like a good idea at the time" ), I won\'t generally bother
with it in my campaigns. If a player wants to know if there\'s a mining operation
in a given system, then as long as it\'s presence wouldn\'t upset my existing
plans, I roll a dice for the answer. No messing around required. Sure it\'s not
as colorful, but there are far more important things in a game than the number
of uninhabitable planets in a system. No offense meant to anyone who enjoys
fleshing out systems. Traveller is all about building your own Sci-Fi
environment and playing there. This is just how I see it. The mere fact that we
have multiple time-lines and several different sets of rules out there now,
shows how flexible you can be with established canon and get away with it. It\'s
your game after all.

Wouldn\'t we all. Most are written for DOS, and several can be found on the
Traveller Archive sites here on the web. Search on "Traveller" if you haven\'t
already found any Traveller web sites. Otherwise, follow your nose. You\'re
looking for Traveller Archive FTP sites.

I\'ve been thinking about this all day. The first stumbling block I came up
against was the ultimate limits of such a scheme ( ie: where do you draw the
line ? ). You want to see worlds in subsectors in adjacent sectors, but what
happens when the next sector isn\'t in the Imperium anymore (ie: It\'s off the map
entirely ) ?

So I decided to moot the following ultimate World ID code ( which qualifies as
"Idea A") : AA-BB-CCCC
where AA represents the Quadrant in which the world exists ( the official map or
the imperium shows one quadrant ), BB is the Sector ID within the Quadrant, and
CCCC is the current World ID code based on a the sector wide number system as
used in the Library Data (N-Z) maps.

There are ( arbitrarily ) 99 Quadrants in Traveller space labelled 1-9 across
and 1-9 down. They are identified by concatenating their co-ordinates together,
so that the Imperium ( which fits right in the middle in order to allow
exploration for four quadrants in any direction ) is identified as quadrant 5,5
( or 55 for short ).

Then each quadrant ( according to the Traveller Map of the Imperium ) is 16
sectors across and 8 deep, so if we label them A..P across the top we get
sectors A,1 to P,8 ( A1..P8 for short ).

And each Sector has 16 subsectors, but we ignore these when identifying worlds
as the worlds use the sector wide numbering system from 0101..3240.

However, the subsectors are identified in Col,Row format when listing the
subsector names in a data file : 1,1 to 4,4 ( or 11..44 for short ).

This means that Regina Subsector would be 55-E3-31
and Regina ( the world ) would be 55-E3-1910  ( or 55E31910 as stored on file ).

Of course there may be other ways of doing this, and I am tossing a couple of
other ideas:
B) Create a code based on the worlds position within the 81 quadrants ( though
this would have limited use, and be impossible for mere mortals to decode ), or
C) Create a code which includes the subsector ID in it in order to seperate out
the data for a given subsector easier. This is tempting, but again, I\'m not
sure.

The problem is that all three code systems have their use within any mapping
software. For practical purposes however, I feel obliged to go with the most
human readable format, and use the power of the computer to translate it when I
need another format.

And the worst case test senario is where four quadrants meet in a corner, and I
need to show worlds from all four on my four-subsector map.

What do you think ?

I\'ve thought of this. I\'ll allow users to create a schema file to identify the
bits of data within an incoming text file. And realistically, I expect most of
the data to come from one or two existing sources where committed sector
designers have been working on the results for years already.

I\'m designing this program primarily as an aid to those who want to _play_
Traveller rather than those who want to just generate sectors ( although it
should appeal to them too ).

<cringe> I\'m really sorry. Really sorry. Seriously. But even microsoft has

that this sort of program could run under DOS anymore.

This is kind of what I have in mind ( see my posting about Universal world IDs
in this edition ), but I\'m not sure how practical getting down below planetary
level would be as the graphic storage starts to become a real problem ( you go
from boxes and hexes to street maps or land boundaries ).

We need to look at the numbers.  What is the total population of the
Imperium (let\'s say ca. 1100)?  It\'s a huge number that has been
calculated, but I don\'t have it at my fingertips.  What is that divided by
100,000?  It\'s still a huge number.  Yes, compared to the uniformed
services it is small, but the uniformed services are disproportionately
large.  It\'s better to compare the MoJ with the Ministries of
Colonization, Standards, Revenues, Science & Technology, Transportation,
Finance, Interior, and Economics.  They\'re all big bureaucracies, they\'re
all orders of magnitude small than the uniformed services, and they\'re all
competing for shares of the budget.

I agree, and wasn\'t suggesting that the article put the Imperium in a role

I agree; the solutions to civil rights problems are political, not legal.

Who\'s doing the abusing?  If Imperial nobles are merely letting it happen
on their watch, I don\'t think that anyone will do anything except those
being abused.

Imperial agencies are not supposed to abuse local populations, because it
interferes with local autonomy (i.e., I agree, they have rules).

If Imperial nobles are directly involved outside their own fiefs, other
nobles will act, but only if the abuse is threatening Imperial security.
A threat to Imperial security could of course arise by publicity about the
abuse, which "break[s] down the trust."

Imperial nobles can do what they want on their own fiefs; what\'s the point
of having an aristocracy if it can\'t exercise absolute power somewhere?
N.B., of course, that reigns like Caligula\'s don\'t last long (-4470 to
-4466).

We disagree here.  The MoJ never finds it convenient to get involved with
local law.  Local governments might invite them, or another Ministry, to
help with problems that they can\'t handle.

I agree that local authorities may from time to time solicit MoJ
assistance in these matters (with the proviso that the MoJ doesn\'t
maintain as many offices as you would have them do).

Agreed.

>Theft, embezzlement, and fraud are bad for business but easily handled

Theft, etc. occurring where there is no local law -- "at Imperial
installations and in space between star systems" is not governed by local
law (I don\'t remember what recognized law is; I\'ll have to look it up),
but only by Imperial law, which prohibits what\'s bad for business (or is
malum in se).

>Smaller incidents are not of imperial purview.

Again, where there is no local law, there is applicable Imperial law.  It
may not recognize the particular act as a crime.  The size of the crime
is immaterial.

>If everything that was bad for business was illegal at the Imperial level

Go back and read what I said:  I was only talking about acts that were bad
for business where there is no local law, where only Imperial law is in
effect.  Tradewar is illegal.  See The Traveller Adventure at 108 ("In the
Imperium, the rule of law is sometimes tenuous.  In the vast distancs
between the stars, the long arm of the law is sometimes not quite long
enough, and companies can go beyond competition in the normal sense --
into tradewar....Violence being generally illegal, tradewar is practical
only in situations where its perpetrators can assume there will be no
reprisals from the law.  Sometimes, a company with great resources can
bribe or coerce government into looking the other way.").

I agree.

Agreed.  Have you ever had anyone who wanted to play an accountant or a
commercial lawyer?  Nevertheless, we should note that their existance and
importance to the background.

I was talking about Imperial law applying where there is no local law
(starships in jump, research stations, starports, etc.).  I think you\'ll
agree that if crew members Smith and Chiang get into a fight aboard their
merchant ship in jump, the captain will deal with it in accordance with
Imperial law.  If Smith and Chiang mutiny and try to hijack the ship, the
captain will again be the appropriate enforcer of Imperial law (although
as a practical matter the captain will also be a witness, and therefore
not qualified to serve as judge), at least initially.

I agree that as to crimes that are "important to the ongoing function of
the Imperium," the Imperium has professionals and specialists who deal
with them, like the Ministry of Finance to deal with financial or
securities fraud on an interstellar scale, or naval and military
intelligence to deal with terrrorism.

No, the few crimes that come to a starport administrator, ship commander,
etc., are generally well within their capabilities.  Notice that I said
"few crimes."  These people only perform law enforcement activities when
there is no local law, and no local law enforcement.  Law enforcement is
not a big part of their jobs.  If something is too big for such an
official, it probably has a significant local component, and local law and
law enforcement should deal with it.

If a criminal is too violent, dangerous, or well-armed, call the Marines.
See, e.g., Loren K. Wiseman, Champa Interstellar Starport, 7 JTAS 7, 12
("Although, strictly speaking, the law level of the starport permits any
weapon to be carried openly, the laws against property damage, murder, and
extortion are rigidly enforced, by the battalion of Imperial Marines (TL
15) barracked at the scout base, if necessary.").

>Eh.  The MoJ has authority over all of these, but things like

I basically agree; NI and other intel agencies actually do the
counter-intelligence, "in cooperation with" the MoJ, as the enabling edict
no doubt states.

>The Imperium does not have a single unified "secret police"
>organization;

The MoJ tries to be, but the Imperium is too big and its resources too
small, so it focusses its efforts where they will be rewarded:  in the
Solomani Rim, in other border regions, and at Capital. In those regions,
it can be a full-fledged secret police entity.

>the MoJ handles what it can on the mostly-criminal-and-threat-to-trade
side,

OK.  Some of the threat to trade stuff will be investigated and analyzed
by the Ministry of Finance, but prosecuted by MoJ.

>the Navy handles military threats to the peace (NI)

Yes

>and probably is tasked with diplomatic work,

No, that\'s Foreign Ministry.

Yes.  IISS\'s Detached Duty Branch is a unique source of intelligence.

I would have thought that any defender fleet worth it\'s salt would have
placed defense systems within gas-giants.
A self refueling (fuel scoop/refining) double meson firing defense system
would cause havoc to any ship trying to refuel at the giant.
Of course this would only apply to *paranoid* planetary systems.
Which would apply IMHO to 70%+ of the Imperial planetary systems.

Now in the TNE setting.
Some of these are bound to be still active.
Possibly *virus* active.
And a possible scenario for "why are there 200 derelicts orbiting that GG".

Who knows.
These GG\'s may even be mined.

to be different tax rates at different TLs, otherwise low tech world will
bleed to death and high tech ones will pay to little. If taxrate is TL
based however may lead to bribes towards the IISS to set the TL of a system
lower than it actually is (is this the real reason there are so many low TL
systems?).
The tax could be on trade instead giving the Imperium a very practical
reason why stopping the flow of trade is the worst crime of all.

"De gustibus nondisputandum est"

If you read Stirling\'s *other* books, you\'ll see that he doesn\'t
approve of the Draka. He\'s accomplished the difficult task of
portraying *vile* people in a *vile* society in an objective manner. At
the same time the Draka are both admirable and detestable. They follow
their convictions and cultural mores right to the bitter end. You have
to admire that even as despise them for *holding* said convictions and
mores.

It *really* helps if you realize that Draka are less human *culturally*
than *any* alien race in Traveller. As such the things you find
"objectionable" are actually *necessary*. Stirling has done an
*excellent* job of following Campbell\'s dictum: Show me a creature that
thinks as *well* as a human but not *like* a human.

The Draka are not there as an example ofd how to act. They are there as
a warning that humanity can quite easily accept a culture that is
inhuman. If you think the Draka are bad, I can only assume that you
have never looked very closely at what went on in Cambodia, or in other
parts of history (both recent and ancient) that we\'d rather not examine
too closely.

And while the technology is interesting, it doesn\'t overpower the
stories. In any case, the technology and the *culture* have little to
do with each other.

been thinking under MT and TNE.

As an example, what we usually think of with regards to Jupiter is that
the gravity is about 2.5 g at the top of the atmosphere. The problem is
that this is a *huge* radius. What we *should* be worrying about is the
*escape* velocity. Because that\'s what you need to get away after
skimming. And while the acceleration due to gravity drops as the square
of the distance, the escape velocity drops *linearly* with distance.

I may mis-remember the figures, but as I recall, the escape velocity
for jupiter at any given distance is something like 10 times that for
earth at the same distance. That\'s gonna use a *lot* of G-turns. How
many ships can make it to 100 km/sec?

The "critical" items you have to worry about are the *mass* of the
planet, and the radius (ie how close you get). At any given distance,
the escape velocity is directly proportional to the mass.

I wish I could give some calculations, but I don\'t have anything
listing either the mass *or* the radius of Jupiter (or even a "typical"
Traveller GG) handy.

Would someone who does, please figure out how many G-turns it takes to
do a skimming run? Don\'t forget, you are going to *have* to slow down
to make the run unless you want to fry....

 I\'m not aware of any "RC RICE Papers" having been written.  The
 documentation of the RICE Paper format for planets can be found on
 my Traveller page - http://www.execnet.com/~jeffz/travellr.html
 and then select the links for "About RICE" and "Interpreting the
 extended UWP".  (I forgot the exact names of the files, believe it
 or not!)

 Although you could certainly use the format as documented, I\'d
 prefer that they _not_ be called RICE Papers, unless they deal
 with Regency or Spinward States topics - RICE, after all, stands
 for "REGENCY Institute for Cultural Education".  Just off the top
 of my head, I suppose you could call them "Coalition And Beyond
 Library Extracts" - CABLEs.

 Reformation Coalition new dating - 365 days in a year; I don\'t
 remember the other details off-hand.  Check the main TNE rulebook.
 I\'d use our standard calendar for this one, and again ignore the
 intercalations.

 Solomani Confederation dating used our calendar, complete with
 intercalations.

 The Vilani used a 500-day year, with each day being 32 hours long.
 Days and nights were arbitrarily fixed at 16 hours each, and were
 numbered separately and consecutively from 000 to 999.  Dates
 were written yyyy.ddd.  This was in Cogs and Dogs, if I remember
 correctly.

 The Zhodani and Aslan calendars were in their respective CT Alien
 Modules (and the Aslan was in Rats and Cats, as well).  Both used
 unequal seasons integrally in their dating systems; the Zhodani
 also used the three-(Zhodani)-year "olympiad" as a component.

 There\'s no reason not to use a local calendar where appropriate;
 just make it have some relationship to the rotational and
 revolutional cycles of the planet, and justify it however you want.

Turn on your CG units (which draw 2.5 times the normal amount of power I
think) and thrust for one turn if you\'re short on fuel and twiddle your
thumbs while the ship glides from the GG.

If we assume that the ship has a mass small compared to planet mass, M, then:

Vesc = SQRT(2GM/r)

Jupiter has a mass of 1.9E27 kg or so.

Earth is like 6E24 kg.  That\'s a 17.8 times difference for a given r.

What velocity?  Hmmmm.  5km/s, maybe (~1/3 hex per BL turn)?
Vesc(jup.)=~60km/s

Drag goes as v^2 on earth, right?  Hmmm.  At the least you\'d need
~55km/s to escape, though you could get a low GG orbit with less.  You\'d
need 3.3 gturns.  CG would change this, as would taking drag into account.
And that assumes we only skim ~1000km deep.

I\'d think SL ships would enter slower than AF, and USLs would get ripped
to pieces in the wind (and if they drifted with it, they\'d need powerful
compressor pumps to suck air in) if you were wanting to let thema.  I
have to say that I prefer no CG as it makes skimming more dangerous in
combat (and in general).

I\'d think that since the CG lifters take up a large surface area on the
belly of the ship that they should take hits as a surface feature like
antennas (or the EMMRs).  Kill some of the CG and you kill the ship.

Oh, *man*, this gets convoluted.  Let\'s start out with HEPlaR, but no
CG.  Basic structure of a skimming run, version 1:

Start out in distant orbit around GG.  Cancel most orbital velocity with a
relatively small burn.  Drop like the proverbial rock on a skinny
elliptical orbit, the periastron of which just brushes the GG\'s outer
atmosphere.  Open scoops, get fuel.  Lose some velocity to drag, do a
short burn to make up for it.  Coast back up and away.  Do a third short
burn to regain distant orbit.

Doing it this way is most energy-efficient, but runs into two major
problems:

1) The in- and outbound legs take a long time -- many days to weeks.

2) The in-atmosphere speed is very high, perhaps too high to be
structurally workable.

This leads us naturally to skimming run, version 2:

Start out far from GG.  Burn down to close-orbit radius, then do a *big*
burn to circularize your orbit there -- or rather, not quite circularize.
Instead, you want a slight ellipse, the periastron side of which is just
inside the atmosphere.  Open scoops during much longer, slower trip
through atmosphere.  Burn as needed to combat drag.  On return to
(relative) vacuum, do another burn as big as your circularizing burn to
pick up escape velocity from your close circular orbit.

This has the major disadvantage that you squander a bunch of the fuel you
just skimmed getting away from the GG.  Also, it doesn\'t work if you have
nearly dry tanks -- notice that a big burn is required *before* you
refuel.

So, obviously, Traveller canon fails miserably without CG.  Either GG
refueling takes far too long and requires ridiculous in-atmosphere
speeds, or it has too little net benefit to be worthwhile.  Fortunately,
CG (much as I dislike it in general) comes to the rescue here.

With CG, you can all but ignore gravitational effects -- and hence
sidestep the whole escape velocity question.  Here\'s CG-enabled skimming,
version 3:

Using a combination of modulated gravity from the GG and small burns, aim
yourself tangent to the GG at your desired skim speed.  Activate "full"
CG, cancelling most of gravity.  Coast toward the GG at constant velocity
(both direction and speed).  On entering the atmosphere, modulate CG such
that there\'s enough force to bend your path around the planet, staying at
the edge of the atmosphere.  As drag slows you down, either burn a
little, or turn up the CG to compensate.  When the tanks are topped off,
max out the GG, and presto, you\'re sailing away from the GG in quite
nearly a straight line, along the direction (tangent to the edge of the
atmosphere) of your velocity when you turned it on full.  Coast out to
where the escape velocity is minimal, turn off the CG, and jump or
m-drive or whatever it is you need to do next.

This also suggests a fairly striking discovery -- that a ship without CG
can\'t effectively skim a gas giant!  Comments, anyone?

I\'m starting to feel outvoted on this issue <g>. It certainly seems popular
enough to include. Consider it added to the version 2.0 feature list.

horrendous. But this is only if you start off at rest.

The mechanics of normal Traveller interplanetary stuff don\'t handle it well, as 
the g-turns are normally those required to permanently change to a new
  (circular) orbit.
 In this refueling maneuver, you change orbit to an ellipse, to skim the 
surface and then come back out again to almost the same radius. As you never 
start
  from the surface ( except for such weird things as the Jagd) you never have 
to really pay this cost.

The trick is skimming high enough that you don\'t burn up, and low enough to 
skim enough. Yes, a totally "safe" way given CG is to bring yourself totally to
  rest with respect to the atmosphere.

 Allow that the atmosphere doesn\'t just end - it decays sort of exponentially. 
And a ship travelling fast enough will scoop AV, for drag AVV. So multiply the
  mass you scoop by the skimming velocity ( 100km/s ?) as the impulse. divide 
by the loaded mass of craft, and again divide by 18000, and you get the thrust
  in g-turns to get you back out.

 Time doesn\'t really feature in this part - you can skim arbitrarily high, to 
avoid burning, and still scoop something. In fact, the lighter gases you are
  affter are more likely to be at the top.
 Whether this allows time for the fuel scoop rating is something else. I don\'t 
have the figures for that. I\'ll just consider all the drag and thrust required.

take a 100 dt craft,1000 t mass, 50t fuel. - effectively a scout (don\'t have 
exact mass to hand), with 50% of volume as fuel tanks.

50 tons at 1000 km per second is 5000000 t m/s impulse.
For the scout, this is 5000 m/s delta v,  or about 1/3 g-turn.

of course, not all the stuff that causes the drag will be scooped, only a 
fraction, but as order of magnitude, it works. Even a factor of 10 increases 
this
  to 3g-turn. The ship\'s launch, the 10dt thing, could manage this.

Remember, 18km/s is 1 g-turn. Under traveller, GG escape is only 5 g-turn.

The critical thing is not loosing manueverability during the skimming. dropping 
the nose of a craft could be enough for aerodynamics to take over, and plunge
  the craft into the deep atmosphere. I remeber seeing an article a few digests 
ago that agreed with this. Any kind of spine or maneuver hit is dangerous, and
  any kinetic effect even more so.

Hope I haven\'t made too many mistakes

Simon,

I think that the point is that while it may not be critical, this is
just the thing that a lot of us have always wanted----an easy (for the
ref) way to provide in-system detail.  Unfortunately what is easy for
the ref is more work for you :-)

I would suggest (I think I saw it posted as an idea before, actually)
having any systems with canon in-system info pre-entered, and a button
to generate an extended system after the fact, then save it.

Regards,
Merrick

combat rules.  In the past, one of the things I\'ve come up against is the
problem of large numbers of weapons on ships.  A 100 000 ton battleship
can potentially have 3000 weapons on it.  In HG, this problem is partially
solved by forcing the designer to put weapons into batteries (though you
can still end up with scores of batteries, which is a drag).  This is an
adequate solution, but a bit cludgy in my opinion.  If I want to have 3000
factor-1 beam weapons, I should be allowed to, dammit!  :-)

So, to solve this problem, I\'ve come up with the following tables.  They
are based on something I saw in Dragon magazine many years ago.  They
allow the resolution of many rolls with a single roll.  The title of each
table indicates the number of rolls you are resolving.  To resolve the
rolls, just figure out your target (with total DMs subtracted) and
cross ref with a 1d20 roll down the side.  The body of the table shows the
number of successes/hits/whatever. I\'ve included tables for resolving
groups of 10 and 50 rolls.  I will be creating tables for 5 and 20 rolls
as well, but I didn\'t include them because I didn\'t want this post to be
_too_ long.  Tables for numbers of rolls above 50 are kind of pointless.
The distributions become pretty stable and normalized after 30.  If you
want to resolve 100 rolls, just roll on the 50 roll table and double it.
A set of 500 rolls can be resolved by multiplying by 10, etc.

Okay, here are the infamous tables, already:

These can be useful for a number of things.  For example, consider a group
of 60 Zhodani Elite Troops firing FGMP\'s at your ship (eek!).  To figure
out how many hit, take their target (e.g. 4+) and cross-ref with a roll of
1d20 down the side of the 50 ROLLS table.  Then do the same for the 10
ROLLS table.  Add the two obtained values together, and voila, you\'ve got the
number of hits.  With tables for 5, 10, 20, and 50 rolls, just about any
number of 2D6 rolls can be resolved with 5 or fewer 1d20 rolls.  Example:
273 rolls requires one roll on table of 50 (multiply by 5), one roll on
table of 20, and (if you want to be anal) 3 normal 2d6 rolls.  3130 rolls
requires one roll on table of 50 (multiply by 62), one roll on table of
20, and one roll on table of 10.  On the other hand, for really big
numbers like this, you can just take the average number of hits.

If anyone wants an explanation as to how I came up with these tables, I
can send them one, I just figured most people on the list wouldn\'t want to
listen to my statistical babbling.  For those of you who are stats-savvy,
I should briefly mention that the distributions of results in the tables
are based on binomial distributions, but are somewhat leptokurtic (ooh, a
10$ word!) due to rounding.  This means that the results using them will
tend slightly more towards the average than they would if you actually
rolled all the rolls separately.

Yikes, this has gotten longer than I intended!

I welcome any comments or criticisms (i.e., let me know if I screwed up the
math! :-), and hope people find this useful.

Not so minor "nit". A 9x9 grid like that only has 81 quadrants in it. :-)

I used a simpler system when I made up my list of sectors (buried
somewhere in the archives).

Core sector is 00 (or 0000 if you think *really* big). This fits with
the known fact that the imperial "reference point" is there.

You just increase/decrease the base 36 sector numbers from there. A
diagram may help....

Extending this to 4 digits is left as an excercise for the reader. :-)
But I think it has the virtue of simplicity. You can get an area 35
sectors *square* (1225 sectors) with no amibguities with just 2 digits.
That\'s 1120 parsecs by 1400 parsecs. It\'d take close to 4 years for a
jump 6 xboat route to get data from one side to the other.

With 4 digit numbers you get a 1260x1260 grid. That\'s 1587600 sectors.
Or 40,320 parsecs by 50,400 parsecs. That\'s a rather *large* chunk of
the galaxy.... I\'m fairly sure that 5 digits would get you the whole
galaxy. :-)

Actually, I daresay that it could so fairly *easily*. It\'s just that
you wouldn\'t get your windowing and the like handed to you. And you\'d
have to actually worry about RAM usage. :-)

I started writing something like this on an *8-bit* system, and was
making progress. But switching to a PC (which *does* have better
compilers) rather sidetracked me for a few years. Then I started
*working* with them, and I haven\'t had the time to start over.  (My
data files are all that\'d really be convertable <sigh>)

(BTW, I started programming in FORTRAN on an IBM 360 back in 72. I got
my first personal system back in 80. In 81 I was paying $300 for a
5.25" SSSD drive and considering it a good deal. And paying $30-50 for
a box of 10 SSSD 5.25 disks... Folks who didn\'t come up thru the old
systems don\'t realize how much *waste* there is in most programs these
days :-)

It\'s only unworkable if you insist on having that level of detail
*everywhere*. But there\'s very little reason to map the Gobi desert
with any higher resolution than 100s of meters.

But having the system set up so that you can access such levels of
detail *if available* is another matter. If I have the data, I should
be able to go all the way from the galaxy map to the interior layout of
the cantina in Mos Eisley<g> with only a few jumps. (galaxy, 35x35
sector map, sector, hex, planet, planetary "hex", feature (ie city),
city "hex", building, interior) Hmm. 10 jumps....

It ain\'t copyright infringement if I own copies of the material I
enter, and the result is for personal use. And I daresay that if I got
it together, Marc would either license it, or we could work out some
sort of deal.

Sure. This works, but lets face it : it\'s not the easiest thing for the average
guy to follow. People will use a product or system that they can understand.
Unfortunately we tend to over-complicate things that we\'re familiar with until
we know everything, but no-one wants to play with us anymore because they can\'t
understand the rules. I want a number system that a fourteen year old can follow
easily in his head.

Plus, I\'m thinking of the fact that in the decade or more since Traveller was
created we still have only a small handful of sectors actually mapped properly (
with full world details, history, library data, etc), and the variety of
adventures possible in these are nearly infinite. And there are still at least a
hundred sectors in the Imperium itself to map yet. Frankly I believe a good
referee could have a party play for the rest of their ( actual / real time )
lives in the Spinward Marches without getting bored.

So I\'m allowing for a playing area 80 times the size of what we haven\'t used
yet. I figure it should be enough for the next decade <g>.

Exactly. And who wants those hassles when you can have so many other, more

I don\'t think you get it. In a space map, you\'re dealing with standard objects (
for example, a hex which may or may not contain a circle [ another standard
graphic object ] representing a world ). These are predefined in the program
code, and the only factors that are data driven are their presence ( or absence
) and possible their colors. In contrast, a bar-room must be drawn by someone
using CAD-like tools ( which I\'m definitely not interested in writing ). If
you\'re talking about simply importing bitmap images created elsewhere into a
database ( and then re-displaying them on cue ) then that may be possible, but
anything else is a result of either wishful thinking, or a complete lack of
understanding of the complexities involved.

Fine, but this won\'t be for _personal_ use. It will be used by many others (
hopefully ) including a number who will hopefully pay for the privilige of using
the extended version with all the bells and whistles. The free version will be a
data reader only. A useful taste, but not the whole thing. And if I get to make
any money from this you can bet that MM, etc will want a slice of it ( and
rightly so ).

Perhaps. He has to start answering my email first <g>.

Good idea but what kind of hand waving are we going to use to force one to
put them on the outside? Are there exhausts or cooling vents et c?

<Snip stuff about wanting to cross Sector boundaries arbitrarily (which =
I agree with!)>
I\'ve been thinking about this all day. The first stumbling block I came =
up=20
against was the ultimate limits of such a scheme ( ie: where do you draw =
the line ? ). You want to see worlds in subsectors in adjacent sectors, =
but what happens when the next sector isn\'t in the Imperium anymore (ie: =
It\'s off the map entirely ) ?=20
<<<<

My approach to this fell straight out of the programming solution to =
drawing the Hex map on the screen. I decided that the unique identifier =
of a system would be it\'s absolute (X,Y) coordinates on a theoretical =
blank sheet of paper used to draw that map. All coordinates would be =
relative to Reference (0140/Core), so systems in the Spinward Marches, =
for example, have negative coordinates for both X & Y, whilst in the =
Solomani Rim they are all positive.

All sectors would be identified by the (X,Y) coordinates of their =
\'TopLeft\' hex. They would also hold the valueof their \'BottomRight\' Hex, =
in order for the application to decide that a system is actually at =
(say) 0101/Reft Sector, rather than 3341/Spinward Marches. This also =
allows Sub-Sectors to be handled in an identical fashion, only with =
their \'BottomRight\'s being offset by a smaller amount from their =
\'TopLeft\'s than with Sectors.

The actual coordinates are generated by the following Access Basic =
procedures. I thought the best way to enable arbitrary sector border =
crossing would be to have my application act as an interface to an =
Access database.

Function Hex_Centre_X(
ByVal X As Integer,
ByVal Y As Integer,
ByVal Base_X As Single,
ByVal Base_Y As Single) As Single
    Hex_Centre_X =3D Base_X + (2 * (X - 1))
End Function

Function Hex_Centre_Y(
ByVal X As Integer,
ByVal Y As Integer,
ByVal Base_X As Single,
ByVal Base_Y As Single) As Single
    Hex_Centre_Y =3D Base_Y + (2 * (Y - 1)) + (1 - (X Mod 2))
End Function

The following two procedures reverse the procedure, turning the ID =
coordinates back into a hex id, given the identifying (X,Y) coordinates =
of the sector.

Function Hex_Number_X(
ByVal X As Single,
ByVal Y As Single,
ByVal Base_X As Single,
ByVal Base_Y As Single) As Integer
    Hex_Number_X =3D Int((X - Base_X) / 2) + 1
End Function

Function Hex_Number_Y(
ByVal X As Single,
ByVal Y As Single,
ByVal Base_X As Single,
ByVal Base_Y As Single) As Integer
    Hex_Number_Y =3D
Int(Y - Base_Y - (1 - (Hex_Number_X(X, Y, Base_X, Base_Y) Mod 2))) / 2 =
+ 1
End Function

>From the above algorithm, the Y coordinates of systems increases down =
the hex columns by 2 for every hex. The Y coordinates of the =
horizontally adjacent hexes are +/- 1 from that one. The X coordinates =
simply increase by 2 for every column. Thus 0101/Core has coordinates of =
(0,-78), and 0201/Core is (2,-77).

\'TopLeft\' values for any given sector can be generated by taking a =
similar (X,Y) scheme, multiplying X by 80, Y by 64, and adding to the =
value just derived for 0101/Core. This gives a value of (-256,-158) for =
Zeycude (0101/Spinward Marches).

Allowing use of negative coordinates simplifies the question of an =
\'expanding\' universe, as all numbers can grow out to infity in each =
direction (or at least, to the accuracy of the numbers we\'re playing =
with). Since all this is just internal bookkeeping for the program, =
there\'s no need for the players to have to worry about it. The user adds =
a new sector to core/spinward of Spinward Marches (I know there\'s =
already one there, this is just a f\'rinstance), and the program says =
\'OK, this new sector is (-336, -222).\'

If you\'re wondering why this wonderful program hasn\'t hit the streets =
yet, it\'s because I was working in VB 3.0, and when I tried to paint a =
full Sector, the program just blew up because it couldn\'t handle so many =
windows at once. VB treats every user object as a \'Window\', so my =
brainwave fizzled out there. Now I\'ve got W95 and VC++, I may attack the =
problem again.

Anyway, just in case it helps.....

 Here is where the Feudal system comes in handy.  If we look at
 Terran Medieval Period methods of handling taxation in societies
 with a feudal system of government, we see that the Royal Treasury
 (rather, The King) assessed a tax only on those individuals in
 direct fealty to him.  These individuals were almost invariably
 enfeoffed nobility, holding their fiefs on condition that they
 meet certain obligations - primarily those of taxation (in cash or
 kind) and muster (when the king goes to war, you provide thus-and-
 so-many men, horses, suits of armor, swords, etc.).  How those
 nobles raised the required remittance was their business.
 Usually, they subenfeoffed lesser nobles and knights, who were
 held in fealty to them (and only indirectly to the King), under
 the same conditions; at the bottom of the heap were peasants who
 were \\de facto\\, and sometimes \\de jure\\ the property of the noble
 or knight whose land they worked.  Freemen (the middle class;
 merchants and tradesmen, for the most part) generally remitted a
 profits tax or paid guild and license fees to be permitted to
 operate.  An appropriate percentage of those remittances also
 found their way into the royal treasury.

 In the Traveller context, where nobility is still emplaced, a
 similar system can be postulated, but with more up-to-date forms
 of record-keeping, auditing, and so on - think of Your Favorite
 Tax Collection Agency writ large for the bureaucracy and
 collection methods.  Couple that with Imperial assessments
 directly on the Archdukes and Sector Dukes, and possibly the
 subsector dukes as well, and let them deal with revenue generation
 as they see fit, subject to any relevant Imperial law.

 Thus, under my scenario, it is likely that the citizens of Glisten
 do not pay taxes directly to the Imperium; rather, their taxes are
 remitted perhaps directly to the Subsector Duke of Glisten, who
 remitted the taxes from his 50 or so planets to the Delphine of
 Mora (who was also the Duchess of the Spinward Marches), or, at
 the time of the Rebellion, to Norris, the Archduke of Deneb.  The
 Delphine or Norris would then remit to the Imperium.

 Of course, much of this would be simply recorded in electronic
 form as balances of interstellar credit, with bullion or other
 valuta changing hands only to redress a severe and chronic
 imbalance.
