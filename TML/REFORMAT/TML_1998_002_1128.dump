Acceleration with thruster plates peaks at 6G - I believe you can combine
the T-Plates with Heplar etc to get higher acceleration, but it all links
back to power plant size, which is bigger on capital ships... With the
acceleration capped by the technology used (and the crew\'s ability to
handle high G), the top speed will end up being limited by hull materials
and dust density in space. As far as I know Traveller doesn\'t simulate
these limitations.

It came out of FFS1 and the move to more \'realistic\' technologies. FFS1
changed the technology in Traveller a fair bit (threw out T-Plates, changed
the depiction of lasers, changed the missile types). Some of the
differences are reconciled in T4\'s FFS2

They have - it has been in Traveller since CT, and is called a sandcaster
which is basically device which ejects a cloud of ablative material and
manipulates it using electromagnetic fields. The lasers have to burn
through this.

>4. How about organic ships? You talked about that on the TML?

Not to my knowledge. You mean like Shadow and Vorlon technology in B5? IMO
it could be done in Traveller, just it would be TL18+. I seem to remember
that the higher technology hull materials can be manipulated in a limited
way.

Canon was explained a few digests back, but basically relates to the
previously printed background of the Imperium. Things that are \'canon
breaking\' would either contradict or change the Traveller background as
previously published. For example TL14/15 artifacts used by the Second
Imperium/Rule of Man/Ramshackle Empire when MT sources place the highest TL
achieved lower than that. Canon is used in the sense of \'fundamental
law/rule/fact\'.

In some ways debates like the current Jump technology one go off at a
tangent from what canon is, even though they exchange salvos quoting it.
For ex: What we really know about jump is that:

- - it takes around 1 week
- - it involves a translation to another dimension during which ship is held
in a bubble of normal space
- - it requires a jump drive which uses hydrogen fuel.

If you implement this, do it sparingly if you want to maintain the
Traveller universe as it is. One of the fundamentals of the universe is
communication limited to the speed of jump. Instant FTL increases this
speed. However, The Long Way Home and Secret of the Ancients both involved
ways of instantaneous travel.

The "long lance" torpedoes Type 93 and 95 were exceptional in all regards.
Their speed of 45knots with a ranges of 27,000 plus yards made them formidable
weapons, but the torpedoes used in the attack on Pearl Harbor were not "long
lances"; they were earlier models powered by simple gasoline/air engines,
IIRC.  

The long lance Type 93 was used by the Destroyers and Cruisers of the IJN
while the type 95s were used by their submarines.  I believe the Type 97 was a
possible air-launched model, but never caught on.

Oxygen propelled torpedoes are expensive and heavy.  Ship-ship combat requires
a fairly long-range engagement and, thus, a superior weapon.  Aircraft on the
other hand drop their torpedoes within hundreds of yards obviating the need
for a sophisticated weapon.

One thing no one accounts for in any ship design system I\'ve ever seen
is that bigger ships will have a theoretical maximum acceleration that
is lower than smaller ships.  This is because the strength of a support
structure is dependent on the cross sectional area while the mass (and
therefore the force it generates when under acceleration) is dependent
on the volume.  As an example, if you take a column that is 10 meters
tall and 1 meter by 1 meter in cross section and masses, say, 50 tons,
then the stress is going to be 50 tons/square meter.  If you double
the size of the column to 20 meters tall by 2 meters by 2 meters, then
the mass will be 400 tons and the cross sectional area will be 4 square
meters.  The stress is going to be 100 tons/square meter.  This is
why a larger ship with the same acceleration would require a much
heavier structure to support itself while under acceleration.  This
doesn\'t necessarily mean that fighters will be effective in combat
since capital ships can still mount hundreds or thousands of small
turrets each one the size of a fighter with the mobility to track and
destroy them but it does mean that small craft will have an edge in
maneuverability and will be able to make trips faster since they can
afford to accelerate at a higher acceleration.

When you head out to jump, make sure that none of the drop-tank
retrievers are in your path...  if drop-tanks are used enough, then
there\'s probably a thriving business retrieving them...

I\'m afraid I disagree.

Major developments in electric motor tech include (not necessarily in
this order):

	Muti-phase constriuction
	Field and Armature Winding Techniques
	Materials improvements
	Higher ops frequencies (eg 400Hz vs 60Hz AC)
	Stator/Rotor configuration & design 
	Motor controller design		

And this was all extant by the late 60\'s.

	Now lets include the ability to use superconductors for nearly 
	"loss free systems" and you\'ll recoup all of those OHM heating losses.  

The piint is that "improvement" isn\'t just in thermodynamic or
conversion
efficiency, it is equally important (for ship designers) to reduce the 
volume and weight of a component for a given power handling capacity.

Similarly, Traveller simultaneously underestimates the improvement in
heat
engine (steam based) power plant tech while graetly overvaluing its
power to volume factor.  The actual figure for a TL6 Nuclear Steam plant
(ship based) is more like 0.001 MWe per m^3 instead of the 0.30 MWe per
m^3
from FFS1 and MT.  What Traveller fails to cosider is the BOP (Balance
of 
Plant), the thermodynamic power conversion system that turns heat into 
electricity.

At 6 MWe per m^3, Traveller fusion plants rock!

In any case, I believe that we are still making improvements to the IC
engine (Internal combustion) two or three TL\'s later and we will
continue 
to refine the technology.  How else can you so greatly increase gas
mileage
as the various automobile companies are suggesting they might be able to
do?

Gotta know where the enemey fleet is at first, more than a week in
advance (two for the round trip for the data).  The the mines  have to
be close enogh that they don\'t get detonated before they blow. 
Ingenious yet hideously expensive and thus, perhaps uneconomical for a
war effort.

Hi Vic, 

The History of the Imperia was available at the AAB in Nov 1996 at:

<http://members.gnn.com/bborich/page1.htm>

I don\'t know if it still is.  It is about 30 pages long.

The History of the 3rd Imperium ain\'t Concise!

Why must the jump grid occupy a significant volume at all.  Perhaps its
afilm deposited through molecular beam epitaxy or the equivalent TL15 
technology. Truth is, the whole system is probably constructed through
the
use of nanites, or at least could be.  All you need is a superconducting 
monoatomic layer film to carry the grid currents.

Let me weigh in here.  There ARE nice particle energy screens except
that nobody realizes it yet on the TML.  

The ship\'s hull is itself a highly efficient particle screen, a much
more
complex system than given due in the Trav rules & discussions.

The others are called Meson Screens.  Traveller Canon states that these
work
by inducing strong force decay in the incoming meson packets, but guess
what?

Meson decay is NOT controlled by the Strong Force.  It is controlled
by the Electroweak force

		(Technobabble Engage...)

Meson Technology (Mesonics) - Related to Neutrinics, specializing in
meson 
production and decay manipulation.

Pi neutral mesons mediate the strong nuclear force within the atom, 
moderating the exchange of the strong nuclear force between hadrons. 
This 
macronuclear force is a residual effect of the quark-quark interaction 
mediated by gluons and is an analog to the Van der Waals forces as
associated 
with the electromagnetic force.

Meson production methods are highly inefficient up until TL 13, when
particle 
accelerators double as meson weapons.  The probably reaction used
involves 
using high potential electrodynamics or electrostatic fields to "strip"
muons 
from energetic electon/positron or proton/neutron beams, creating, in
essence, 
a meson beam "rider" on the master particle beam.  10-16 sec meson half
lives 
imply that this process would necessarily be short ranged and probably
of low 
efficiency, given that TL11 is the onset of meson weapon technology. 
True 
meson weapons do not develop until significant advances in unified
fields 
theory are made at TL12, and at TL13, meson weapons and technologies
begin 
to appear as practical engineering concepts.

Note, when a pi neutral meson decays, it decays into two g rays.  Thus a 
relativistic meson beam, quantum mechanically manipulated to delay onset
of 
decay and then impinging upon a meson screen will undergo decay, leaving
two 
high energy photons which carry the original muon’s energy and
momentum.  
Thus you end up getting what is effectively a high energy laser beam at
the 
terminal end of a shot.  Meson weapons at TL13 and higher are therefore
possibly 
very large, highly modified laser systems which utilize increases in the 
understanding of meson decay mechanisms along with hadrogravitics
technologies 
to convert high energy coherent photon beams into a beam of mesons.  The
mesons 
themselves must be manipulated to retard decay onset, and this probably
involves 

(More Technobabble...)

Meson Accelerators 	[TL 11+ Pi Neutral Meson Accelerators]
			[TL 13+ Pi Neutral Meson Drivers]

In meson accelerators, the primary beam is created by the juncture of
coherently 
phased particles, either proton-neutron beams through the <p,n|p,n,p0> 
reaction 
or electron-positron beams through the reaction <e-,e+|g,g,p0>.  

The reaction is one of inherently low efficiency and initially offers no
means of
controlling meson decay initiation, which is governed by the electroweak
force 
and is similar to b decay.  Exponential decay of the meson population
demonstrates 
its highest rate at particle birth, so initially, the actual point of
beam juncture 
and meson creation must be in direct proximity to the target in question
so that 
the beam pattern overlays the required impact point.   

To achieve this, early meson accelerators employ time staggered coaxial 
particle (p,n) beams, each with differing group velocities, to control
beam 
interaction and initiate meson generation immediately prior to target
impingement.  
Coulomb force dispersion within vacuum proton beams problems pose
significant 
engineering problems with this configuration, resulting in limited
effective ranges.  
As accelerator technologies improve, coherent phasing and advanced 
internal beam 
geometries associated with the <e-,e+> configuration enable extended
ranges along 
with enhanced control of meson generation processes.

Meson accelerators essentially comprise dual close coaxial particle
accelerator 
mounts with multiple beam steering options.  Increasing <p,n|p,n,p0> and 
<e-,e+|g,g,p0> reaction efficiencies result in significant increases in
meson 
beam densities., although after TL 13 these devices are increasingly
supplanted 
 by meson "drivers" (also known as pion, "p0", or "p drivers").  These
devices 
utilize hadrogravitics technology to transform high energy photons
directly into
pi neutral mesons, simultaneously placing the generated particles in a
metastable 
exitation state whose decay is controlled by the decay of nuclear self
inductive 
fields.  These devices form the first true meson drivers, whose beam is
composed 
purely of mesons and transits the entire distance from firing ship to
target. 

Additionally, complex interactive beam geometries enable precise control
of 
the meson production and decay initiation points by making use of
nuclear field 
self-inductive properties and using a travelling electromagnetic
waveform coincident 
with the meson beam to maintain stability until terminal beam
propagation phase is 
achieved.

Thanks.  I take this as definitive enouygh to stand corrected.  I must
then assume
that either my memories are so ancient as to have decayed or the
original text was
incorrect.  Unless I find the reference again, I\'ll assume that I have
misremebered
the material.

I believe this is related to the principle/mechanical behavior called
"buckling."

The assertion is true, as it is with ships today, although the primary
factor there is transverse strength (cross sectional) vice longitudinal
(lengthwise).

No, it is a network of fine thread-like wires built into the mass of the
hull.  It takes up surface area, but it so light weight that the total mass
is tiny, and included as part of the general hull weight.

I\'ve seen a variant of BL that includes an increasing chance of j-drive
malfunction linked to the number of areas on a ship that have suffered
surface hits.

As an interesting aside, did\'ya know that the Arizona is still a

while I was stationed at Schofield Barracks.  Very sobering.  I recommend
it to anyone visiting Hawai\'i.

One of the biggest problems we have is that Army gunners are taught that
*anything* with eight wheels and a boat like hull is a Soviet.  Then the

ROTFLMAO!!!!

Reminds me of a great day I had a s a sniper.. we were training, had a
brand new LT, who informed me that to distinguish his group from an OPFOR,
he\'s wave his arm in certain way.  This guy redefined putz, and nobody
liked him.. areal anal-retentive perfectionist.

Anyway, I was holed up with my spotter, and we saw the patrol moving, and
sure enough, the LT waved his arm.  So I fired at him, setting off his
MILES gear.  Later, when the LT had been returned form the dead, he hauled
to our company commander.

"Why did you fire on me Private?!  Did I not give you the recognition sign?"

"Yes Sir."

"Did you not see me give the sign?"

"Yes Sir, I did see the sign."

"Then why did you fire on me!"

"Sir, you used the wrong arm."

At this, the Captain busted up laughing.

Thank Ghu I got transfer orders a week later...

Since the jump field envelops only the object within its jump grid,
probably a real nice light show for your enemies as the cruise by.

James, I can see where you are getting that impression, but this *is* a
return to the Classic Setting, so the connection is obvious.  SJG is one of
the better companies in this industry.  Their commitment to gamers is
beyond reproach.  Steve, for all his ego, is one of the best designers
around, right behind Croc.

As an Ars Magica player, I am very familiar with the "who is publishing the
game this week?" syndrome.  I will agree that unless something happens at
IG fast to unblock delinquent payments and place some very high quality
materials on the market, GURPS *will* become the future of Traveller.
Since I know GURPS, I can say while that is not my first choice, I would
survive such a storm.

Since we\'ve heard *nothing* from IG one way or another, except that they
haven\'t seemed to pay anyone, I\'d advise holding off on the obituary.
Restraint is called for at a moment like this.  It\'s entirely possible that
GURPS: Traveller won\'t be popular, and the series will be dropped.. on the
other hand, it could be wildly success, and Evil Stevie will be the
publishing rights and Marc will get a corner office, and a budget, and
he\'ll hire all of us as minions!

It\'s called burst support.  You release a large number of follow-up
products quickly while interest is still high, and when the wave crests,
you can look at the level of dedicated support and plan releases more
carefully.  Earthdawn had a large number of excellent products released
right after publication, and now they\'ve throttled back to almost nothing.

GURPS supplements come in three flavors: genre books like Space, Magic, and
Horror; Worldbooks like Planet Krishna or Callahan\'s Crosstime Saloon; and
generic support, like High Tech.  I imagine the first G:T book will be a
cross between the first two types, much of the setting and rules for
playing a Traveller style game under GURPS.

The setting is the Strephon lives! universe, but since the settings of MT
and TNE were fiascoes (IMHO! IMHO!) I\'m looking forward to it.

I\'m sure there will be arguments, perhaps even threats of a list split, and
much righteous fury spewed about.  But it\'s still your game.  I can still
sit down with the basic LBBs and run a game of Traveller.  I can also do
the same with all the Classic Books, MT, T4, or CORPS.  (I sold all my TNE
rules, sorry.)

Why indeed?  James, you and I both seem to prefer the Classic Era, a
setting that hasn\'t been supported for over a decade!  I\'m looking forward
to G:T as a sourcebook at the very least, and a window to get new players
into my game without them having to overcome the "new rules syndrome."

If I want to play a one-shot with people who know GURPS, sure, I\'ll do it. 

G:T is more aimed at the GURPS crowd than at hard-core Traveller fiends
like us.  Just like the SJG/WW crossovers, it was intended to add to the
scope of GURPS, and increase exposure for the parent line.

We\'ll see, in the fullness of time.  One thing I\'m sure about is that this

In Fighting Ships of the Shattered Imperium (FSSI) there are: Battleships
(BB), Dreadnaughts (BI), Battleship Lights (BL), Battleship Missile (BM),
Battleship Heavy (BH). There was also a Battleship Strike (BS) which had
J-6 for rift operations.

>Battle Cruiser
>Heavy Cruiser
These two classes, plus Armoured Cruisers, Fleet Cruisers and Protected
Cruisers are basically the same thing (except in WWII where treaty limits
kept cruisers small) - an attempt to make a cruiser with capital ship guns
(or armour), or a capital ship with cruiser speed. This being the case IMO
the 3I would tend to use only one designation, perhaps two with one being
for older (lower TL) ships, like the an Armoured/Protected Cruiser was the
Pre-Dreadnaught Battle Cruiser.

>Cruiser
I\'m not sure you\'d ever get just a \'cruiser\'.

>Light Cruiser
>Frontier Cruiser
FSSI has Cruiser Armoured (CA), Cruiser Heavy (CH), and an assortment of
odd missile and strike cruisers.

>Destroyer
>Frigate
>Escort
FSSI - Escort Destroyer

>Corvette
>Scout/Courier
>
>Heavy Carrier
>Assault Carrier
>Carrier
>Light Carrier
>Escort Carrier
FSSI - Carrier Fleet (VF), Carrier Strike (VS), Carrier Light (VL). BTW the
listed fighter size for these carriers goes from 50t at TL-12 to 20t at TL-15.

Much as I hate stepping up to the mike and saying, "Is this thing on?", I need

So you\'re set to UU?  Why?  Do you have to communicate with Groupwise =
users?
MIME should be your choice, I would think, unless you have other
circumstances.

You might consider also a .pab "internet address" entry for TML and unselect
"Always send rich text format" when you post directly.  If you\'re sending it
as part of replies, something else is wrong.  (I\'m using Outlook, and I
don\'t think anyone is getting them from me.)  Which version of Outlook are
you using?  Get 8.03 if you don\'t have it.  Mail me directly
(dreed@shellus.com) if you\'re lost already.  ;-)

Anyway, when you reply to a message Outlook should return it in the same
format that it was sent, unless you manually change the format/font/etc.

Nice list!

>Super Monitor  
>Monitor

I list Monitors among Boats (not jump capable).  In size/firepower a
Monitor is the equal of a Dreadnaught and a Battleboat is the equal of the
Battleship.  My definition of a cruiser is that it can operate
independently for long periods ranging over a number of systems, thus there
are no Cruiserboats.

>Dreadnought
>Battleship
>Battle Cruiser
>Heavy Cruiser
>Cruiser
>Light Cruiser
>Frontier Cruiser

This probably matches canon sources pretty well, but I\'d move Frontier
Cruiser above Light Cruiser.  In fact, I\'s probably rate a Frontier Cruiser
as equal to a Cruiser, but with additional range.  Of course, I argue for
smaller ships in general. ;->

>Destroyer
>Frigate
>Escort

I rate Frigates above Destroyers and Escorts are subclasses of the
Destroyer and Frigate types, ie Escort Destroyer, Escort Frigate.  An
Escort is just a small warship with specialty features to assist it in it\'s
mission of escorting and protecting transport ships.

Medium sized System Defense Boats are in the Destroyer/Frigate range.
Larger ones are the Battleboats and Monitors.

>Corvette
>Scout/Courier

These are about the same, in my view.  Small, fast, jump-capable, armed and
armored ships. Corvettes, perhaps, a little larger.

At about this size are the...

 Missle Torpedo Boats 
 Gun Boats
 
...that I was discussing with Merrick the other day.  What others call
fighters, I call MTB\'s and GB\'s, giving them a size of fifty to a couple
hundred dt.  Stick a jdrive on one and it\'s a Corvette or Scout.

>Heavy Carrier
>Assault Carrier
>Carrier
>Light Carrier
>Escort Carrier

Looks Ok to me, except I\'d say an Escort Carrier is more of a function than
a class, it would generally be a Light Carrier on Escort duty.  Of course,
I don\'t favor the term fighters, and carrier goes with fighter. ;-> These
ships might be *called* carriers, but I\'d be more apt to call them Boat
Tenders.  Which blurs the line between them and Battle Riders...

IAC, good list.

Cruisers are always larger and more heavily armed than destroyers and 
destroyers always larger and more heavily armed than frigates.  Except
when politics and treaty limitations interfere.

This is one reason why the Arleigh Burkes DDG\'s are designated as
Destroyers
vice Cruisers (which they nearly equal in displacement if not quite in
armament).  Political limitations in numbers or tonnages 

The ex-Soviet Kirov (I can never remember its new name) class were
designated
as Cruisers vice Battlecruisers so they could pass through the Turkish
controlled Bosporous region (some treaty or agreement they had with the
Turks?).

The US nuclear cruisers (CGN\'s) were originally designated as DLGN\'s 
(Destroyer LEader, Guided, Nuclear) and that was changed for political
reasons.

There was even a large battle between the aviation community and the
nuclear
power community in the USN (read: Rickover) that debated placing the "N"
in
the ship designator string.  i.e. the aviation community wanted to call
the
nuclear carriers CVA\'s and the like, Rickover settled for CVA/N knowing

Yes. Secure IFF is based on a challenge/response pair. You send out an
active sensor ping with an encoded challenge, say a random number. The
unidentified ship encodes it with its private cryptographic key and sends
the result. You check the response against the public key of whoever the
ship says it is, and if it matches the ship is who it claims to be. If it
is not, or if the ship doesn\'t reply, it is probably not who it claims to
be. By making longer cryptographic keys this can be made as secure as you
wish. There are modern public cryptographic keys which theoretically could
not be broken during the expected lifetime of the universe by as many crays
as there are electrons in the universe. I think it likely that Third
Imperium technology would have even more secure cryptographic techniques.

Since the IFF signal is based on an encrypted challenge, simply recording
the IFF signal and playing it back later would not work because every
challenge/reply pair is unique. Since the challenge signal has a random
component in it, and there are an infinite number of random numbers, you
cannot use a network of supercomputers to pregenerate every possible
challenge key.

The challenge and response can have sensor characteristics of the
transmitting ship encoded in it, so stealing a transponder and putting it
into another ship will not work. The cryptographic sequence can be altered
after each mission, so a hijacked or renegade ship would be spotted because
the key would have expired.

If by "analyze the encryption" you mean discover the algorithm and public
key encoded in the transmission, this will do you no good. The ship\'s
identity is created when the private key is created, not during the
challenge or response. I could broadcast the encryption algorithm and hand
out free transponders and you would still not be able to fake an IFF signal.

If by "analyze the encryption" you mean be able to derive the private
cryptographic key by monitoring the transmitted public keys, this is very
very very very very very very very unlikely. While it has not been
mathematically proven impossible, Whitfield Diffie, the NSA, and most every
mathemetician who has ever lived has found no way of doing it. Let me give
you an analogy; I just did a few simple mathematical operations to get the
number 5.46889e+11. Please tell me exactly what operations I did with which
numbers and in which order. Answering this correctly is so insignificant
compared to deriving a private key that it\'s not really a fair analogy, but
it should give you a idea of the likelihood of what you are suggesting.

In my campaign, Imperial public/private key pairs are created from quantum
transitions that are truly mathematically random and, because of
Heisenburg\'s principle, unrecordable. This means that every transponder in
the Imperium is unique and cannot be duplicated, even by the manufacturer.

The only way of circumventing this IFF technique is by compromising the
agency that hands out transponders. That is, if I tell you that transponder
A is registered to an imperial spy and you detect transponder A, you can be
sure that it is the same transponder I made and handed out, but you still
have to take my word that I really did give it to a spy. Of course, you
could make your own transponders, but then people will have to take you at
your word as to who you gave them to.

The world economic situation would be completely tossed on its ear.  Nothing
would be the same as it is today.  Money would cease to exist, and the concept
of "work" would quickly become archaic.  Modern methods of warfare would also
quickly become outmoded in light of such an amazing and awe-inspiring
technology.

Terrorism would be held in check in one obvious way.  With the onset of
"replicators" food and other basic necessities would no longer be nearly as
important, as they could be made from simple materials.  As a result, the
unhappiness that drives many terrorists and other miscreants would be more or
less eliminated.  You\'d still have terrorism, but, hey, you still have
terrorism today.

National boundaries and the control of people by governments would be changed
forever, probably allowing much more freedom.

In addition to all of this being hypothetical, there\'s hypothesis layered on
top of hypothesis.  There are several spots along the trail that things could
change, or not go a certain way.

Its tough to predict the kind of things that would happen with a technological
discipline that is making headway, but is still dimly understood by a large
number of people.

I dunno...  Its been out there for a while.

I think the Free Trader Beowulf is really a (not possible if you\'re really
sticking to Canon) pirate.  In fact, I think that it is a large, nasty type of
ship with lots of pointy guns and knobbly protrusions, having only stolen
Beowulf\'s transponder (still up in the air whether stuff like this is
possible).  However, I am sure that the real Beowulf has solar powered jump
capacitors (I saw them myself, although they are non-canon), and was carrying
a hold full of Vargr chew toys.  It also had (non-Canon) HEPlaR drives...

Perfect.  Absolutely perfect.  I hope to hell this was Loren\'s

    ::CLICK::  Hey, where ARE the military Chaplins in Traveller?  I mean come
on I seriously doubt every last living sentient in the Traveller Universe is an
Athiest. ;) And Militaries are notorious for supporting/providing Religious
support and justification for the actions they take.

    Now I\'m not suggesting that we create pan-Imperium religions but I don\'t
think the various Militaries of the Imperium would ignore them either.  They\'re
just too useful as regards the "intangables" that motivate and drive soldiers.
So that would mean Military Chaplans of some sort.  So how do we handle them?

Niko, at this point, my best suggestion would be to look at the

(http://www.dragonfire.net/~FreelanceTraveller) and then have Dan
get in contact with Mike.

I\'m STILL waiting for someone with just a TAD of gumption to translate the
original Free Trader Beowulf transmission into Vilani.  Complete with snide
references to unreliable and unsafe Solomani technology.

Grammatical materials and whatnot are on the TravLang list webpage:
    <http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Chamber/2662/TLDL.html>

Go to it.

Myself, I\'m too busy trying to put _Das Kapital_ into Sayat.  Maybe I\'ll
start with something easier, like something from _Macho Sluts_.  Same
difference, in the end.

Hm, well, a lot of existing jokes can easily be reconfigured for Sayat
purposes: e.g., what do you call a bunch of Sayat crowded into the ship\'s
locker?  A liquor cabinet!  Etc.

Preliminary estimate for the number of Concourse personnel required for
optimum replacement of a lightbulb:  14.  One to screw in the lightbulb,
one to requisition the new bulb from the manufacturing nest and handle the
"accounting", one to recycle the old lightbulb in an ecologically-friendly
fashion, six to secure the theatre of operations from hostile alien
invasion, two to handle the kids who are brought by to participate in the
process as part of their educational development, one to serve the drinks,
one to help everyone process the experience and their feelings about it,
and one more to bring the total up to the proven lucky number for lighting
fixtures.

I didn\'t quite read it that way.  And since I have been trying to make it 
a policy not to slam IG in public whether they deserve it or not,I will 
not speculate on what should or should not be done about their policies 
and unknown situation.

I honestly don\'t think Traveller needs rescuing.  It\'s the fans that will 
keep it alive no matter what company is putting out the current line for 
better or worse.

How far in the past are we talking here?  I came in "late" on the 
Traveller phenomenon -- I bought the BBHB and a couple of alien modules 
when they first came out but did not start playing until a few years ago. 
 I never experienced the first releases and have been gathering the past 
publications wherever I can.

>With Steve Jackson, they could drop Traveller support the moment something
>else comes along.

This is true.  But Steve Jackson is a business man, for the most part, 
and Traveller seems to be a hot property at the moment.  The fans who 
continue to support it in whatever format it comes out will be the ones 
who dictate the length and extent of his interest, I would guess.

It is indeed the alternate timeline.  There is talk about supplements 
with new spaceships, technology, aliens, etc. for after the tentative 
June (I re-read the passage) release.  And there will be rules for 
converting Traveller to GURPS and vice versa.  This makes it look as if 
we are not indeed to be forced into the GURPS system to play with 
"Steve\'s toys".  :-)

There\'s no need to switch over!  Don\'t we all glean what we like/can/want 
to use from all the other various and sordid Traveller products to use in 
our own games?  This will be much the same.  GURPS Traveller can be, at 
the least, merely another source for ideas.

I have nothing personal against the GURPS system myself.  I would not use 
it for Traveller, though.  Our group clings to our LBBs and the Classic, 
and there is no reason to switch over to glean what might be interesting 
from any other sources.

Those of us who know and use GURPS products know what to expect, and I 
myself am expecting at least a few things of worth and note to pop out of 
this publication.  I am hoping SJG will not disappoint us and betting he 
won\'t.

Thanks for the space,

Yep.  But they may be back when big EM guns and DE weapons
- -w- guided munitions become technically feasible.  These
would have to be a new generation though, the IOWAs are just 
too old and manpower intensive (i.e. uneconomical) to use.

The Atlantis class destroyer is the newest addition to the Tanis Navy.
The ship is the most advanced of the fleet, and incorporates a great
deal of stealth technology and powerful weapon systems to make it a
formidible platform.

The ship\'s primary weapon system is the 18 LRT-78 missiles contained in
launch tubes on the dorsal surface of the ship. Each of these
shipkillers displaces 22 cubic meters, signifcantly larger than the
Imperial norm. The LRT-78 puts this space to good use, carrying four
independently targetable 500 kiloton nuclear-detonation lasers. Upon
terminal approach, the missile deploys the four warheads and a ECM chaff
package to confuse CIWS systems. Upon reaching firing range, each
warhead detonates, peppering the target craft with a barrage of
concentrated laser blasts.

Backing up the LRT-78 missiles are 72 SRT-12 missiles contained in
launch tubes mounted on the sides of the ship. The SRT-12 missile is
slightly larger than the Imperial standard missile, but is capable of
7Gs of acceleration.

Along with the combat missile, the Atlantis carries 2 ARQ-78 ECM
missiles and 8 H12a Sensor drones. 

All of the Atlantis\' missiles and drones, like most Tanian missiles, are
fully independent weapons that are capable of intelligent target
selection (note: Tanian robotic brain technology is TL 13, two levels
higher than their base TL 11). Thus, the Atlantis can launch any number
of missiles in a salvo (all missiles have their own launch port),
allowing for devestating missile attacks. 

To supplement the primary missile weaponry, the Atlantis also carries
formidible beam weaponry.

The spine of the ship is dominated by the 2000mj particle cannon. This
weapon is new for the Tanian Navy, designed with the assistance of
Krahz/Chk engineers. It combines long range with fearsome close-range
damage.

Twin 550mj lasers are also mounted forward to provide additional
firepower.
 
For CIWS and defense, the ship is equipped with 3 259mj laser turrets
and 3 sandcaster batteries.

The ship is heavily armored. The primary hull has 14cm of crystalliron,
while the crew quarters and bridge have an additional 20cm. This follows
the standard Tanian design philosophy of crew protection - emergency low
berths are provided for the entire crew.

The primary defensive system of the ship is its impressive (and
expensive) ECM suite. The ship is fully equipped with stealth hull
design, passive jammers, and active deceptive jammers. The large power
plant has advanced masking systems, shrouding both heat and neutrino
emissions. In addition, the ship has enough battery power to operate in
a zero-emission mode (life support, passive sensors, controls, and
communications (in receive mode only)) for 24 hours.

The crew is comfortable within the heavily armored hull. The command
staff is provided large staterooms - the captain also has a ready room.
The rest of the crew has individual small staterooms. A sickbay, repair
shops, armory, and gym round out the rooms. In addition, the ship has a
tactical action center, designed to help formulate
combat strategies and coordinate wartime activities. 

A single squad of TC (Tactical Combat, called "ticks") troops is housed
on board the ship, for anti-boarding defences and special missions.
Since the stealth abilities of the Atlantis make it an attractive covert
insertion vehicle, the ship carries a pair of drop capsule launchers.

The ship is unstreamlined and has no frontier refueling abilities. This
is in line with current Tanian combat doctrine, which places the
refueling responsability on the logistical carriers (who also resupply
the missile salvos). For all interface activities, the ship carries two
35std boats.

The class is named for mythical or legendary cities out of Earth
history. Many of the crews have also "unofficially" named the computers
on their vessels - it is known that the computers of the Camelot,
Oylmpus, Asgard, and Rivendell are "Merlin", "Zeus",
"Thor", and "Gandalf", respectively.

   The classic setting? U mean Merchants and Mercenaries?  Fight the evil

   SJG?  I hardly see their stuff anywhere. And this is LA. Gotta be one of

stuff for that matter) is a serious FLGS that carries pretty much EVERYTHING.
9 out of 10 places i can get TSR and WEG and FASA stuff (and GDW, once upon a
time), i don\'t see SJG or IG.  SJG is a niche if there ever was one.  IG is a
pale shadow of GDW.  IMNSHO, of course. : )

   Fiascoes?  : ) "Strephon Lives" is stepping out of the shower (or the
"Real" Strephon in MT   ; )  )  The whole "setting" is a dangerous precedent.
I call that a fiasco.  If SJG is the future of Traveller, then that future is
gonna be a slow fadeaway into the existing RPGer niche.  Very little new blood
ever comes and stays via SJG.  They should call G:T, GigaTraveller.  : )
   IMNSHO, TNE was the ONLY version of Traveller to have any kind of Vision
behind it.  Any kind of story to tell.  A general revamping to a more popular
(at the time) rules set and a consistent ground-up system didn\'t hurt either.

I\'ll believe it\'ll add to GURPS.  Doubt it will increase exposure any
appreciable level for IG.

   One wouldn\'t take \'blunt trauma\' damage.  Blunt trauma damage is defined as
damage that is caused even though it doesn\'t penetrate (or penetrates through)
armor.  Without armor, blunt trauma is neglegible (or assumed to be included,
take your pick).

Instruction skill level, each student gainst 3 experience points.   If the
number of students is half or more of the instructor\'s skill level, each
student gains 1 expericence point. "
    The only way to gain points by "practicing" is by earning them in
adventure.

Nope.  There are the mods for the recoil.  And only the first shot counts as
aimed (the others are quick shots...  (+1Diff Mod to aimed fire... not
possible at Extreme Range).

The answer would have to be negative.  I\'ve added a house rule adding one diff

sight).

Given that maintaining communications is not so easy, with all the detritus
of battle and nuclear detonations (intended and unintended) floating
around... and then there\'s that jump-thingy that always seems to get in the
way.  How do you calculate this when your ships are weeks/months/years out
of communication?  Long campaigns are even longer in the Third Imperium.
Hell, wasn\'t the Fifth over by the time authorization to fire made it\'s way
from Core to the Marches?  ;-)

I think that an algorithm for determining it based on time is probably our
best wave in that direction, but then we must assume perfect time
measurement.  System name, ship tonnage, distance from Sylea all summed and
multiplied by the Emperor\'s birthday, perhaps?

What do you do when you ARE the good guys, and you fail authentication?
Shoot back?  Or do you just... [drum roll, please]:

"I dunno, just fly casual..."

While it may not need rescuing, it *could* do with some marketing and
popularizing, but it is my personal experience and training (okay, so a
semester of marketing as an MBA student doesn\'t count) that word o\' mouth
has the greatest weight amongst role-players (just as it does with most
consumer groups).  Who better to lead the "revolution" than die-hard fans?
As a group, we Travellers tend to be isolationist and clique-oriented,
permitting only the enlightened and ordained (if they get the Vargr and the
kitchen match joke, they\'re OK) into our secret societies.  Hell, there
isn\'t even a "Travellers\' Aid Society" for new Travellers!  And on a good
day this list is a "Travellers\' Flame-For-All."

To put credits where my mandibles are, I personally began evangelizing today
(oh, yesterday!).  We began our little grass-roots Traveller propagandizing
in one FLGS earlier this week - putting up attractive, if monochrome, flyers
proclaiming the agenda for our coming media blitz - and we will broaden it
further in the coming months to other FLGS.  This particular FLGS, like most
in Houston, have free gaming space available for use by anyone who cares to
reserve the space (nobody but RPGA does, BTW -- and magickers and 40k-ers
don\'t count).  Now every other weekend, we take up all of their business
hours (roughly 12:00 to 18:00) at one table to demonstrate the benefits of
Travelling.  All comers are welcomed to pull up a chair and at least
observe, or join the game if they so choose.  We (our group of five
dedicated players) are continuing an ongoing campaign [Memory Delta] based
loosely on Senor Miller\'s "Memory Alpha" and today, before a small audience
the dread Althaxi of Senor Baker\'s "Vestiges" was slain (or so they think.
Ha!  Thanks for a great adventure, Dave).  How this short adventure got
interspersed is another story.  Some observers wandered in and out, but it
was after all a Sunday; my time during the week is severely limited
(professors and supervisors think I should show up once in a while for some
unfathomable reason).  We had fun, and successfully exposed many unwary
victims to Chris Foss t-shirt art, 0.5d6, and the invitation to peruse the
"spare" rule books.  We\'ll be back every other Sunday, and then begin the
rotation through the other FLGS, conventions, et cetera here in Houston as
time permits.  [Any chance we can get Senor Foss to do some new t-shirts?
Mine are starting to wear thin...  Something with battle dress and big
explosions catches the eye!]

I also flamed RPGA again yesterday about not explaining to me the arcane
process of establishing sanctioned T4 events in mono-syllabic terms that my
social sciences-oriented intellect can absorb.

Anyway, would someone else get out of the house and go play in front of an
audience, run an event at a \'con, or just ambush some unwary peasant in the
grocery store and demand that he pay proper fealty to Emperor Cleon?  [FWIW,
they sold more T4 stuff, I\'m told, after we left than they have all month.]

Hmmm... if this is the case, and venom, er - emotion, yeah, that\'s it, on
this list is any indication, should we not still have LBBs in print?

Have to agree here...  Hell, I *loathe* the "eructation game" but I\'ll buy
the Traveller edition -- "\'Cuz It sez Trahvellar, doll, that\'s why Ah gotsta
buyz it..."  [Many spouses shake their heads in futile understanding of the

I agree.  Competition is a good thing, even if marketed as
"non-competition."  GTrav will be compared with T4, like it or not, and I
hope that IG will be up to competing with another publisher for quality and
timeliness.  Why is it that we always like competition when it\'s someone
else\'s market share that\'s at stake?  That\'s all anyone ever asked of
so-called "anti-trust" laws anyway was protection of their own personal
interests...

Enough rambling on my part...  flame away.

Yes, I can see how there could be a particular material that is found to
be the ideal material for the nanofabs to make "anything".  This material
would then become the standard for value.  If you wanted to "purchase" a
vehicle, you would need enough material for the nanofabs to make one.

I think medical nanobots would become just one of many bizarre
technologies (cloning, etc) that in the wrong hands could be disastrous:

- -used a biological weapon
- -inventor terminated and technology hidden for the use of a few
- -espionage from world to world

What\'s the date of composition? If it is for early Milieu 0, then the
Solomani Hypothesis haven\'t even been proposed yet. It dosen\'t get
finally verified (although it does gain widespread acceptance) before
the 6th Century.

     Although not exactly Traveller related, I had this idea I thought
people on the List might be interested in.
     I was playing around raytracing a ringworld the other day. The
classical Niven-esque ringworld has a large ring, with an inner ring of
"shadow squares" designed to give the semblence of night and day to the
surface of the world. In such a world, though, the diurnal period will be
the same everywhere and thus the climate will depend only on the elevation
of the surface.
     So I thought, what if the "shadow squares" were not square? Instead
imagine a inner band with oval portions cut out of it. This would mean that
"day" lasted longer in the center of the ring than on the edge. Thus you
would have a broad band of climates across the surface of the ring more
like a terrestrial world.
     Does this make sense or am I missing something obvious.

     My final raytrace is up on my Imperial gallery at
http://www.maths.tcd.ie/~jaymin/imperial.htm. (POVRay sources available
upon request.) I took a little artistic lisence and crinkled the edge of
the circular cut-outs to resemble the Imperial Starburst. Now THAT\'s
propaganda...

Where did you get that?  I know in CT the max accelleration was 6 G, but
that was explained as the max. acceleration tolerable by humans for extended

My favorite character has a fleet of small tankers that he uses as
drop-tanks.  When they separate from the starship, the onboard crew just
pilots them back so they can onload more fuel and be ready for the next
launch.

You know, when you write about people, the story is never outdated.
Technologies change, places change, modes of living change, but people, in
all of recorded history, people do not change.  Try reading some of the
stuff from the earlier part of the century or even a good modern translation
of the classics.  You will be amazed at the similarities between the
characters in Shakespeare or Chaucer and the folks you know personally.

I take it that\'s one of those 3D maps with the Z coordinate given as +/-N
printed next to the star symbol.

Those are only fun to use if you like trig.  They add realism at the expense
of playability.  Especially if you use a game system like the Traveller jump
drives.

I don\'t think they understand J-Man.  You want the mines to wait until the
enemy vessels are within X diameters before they activate.  Right?  So that
instead of jumping away from or into the fleet, they will just explode doing
horrible damage to the enemy.  Right?

The statement about cover is correct, and the rules don\'t say you can aim
for locations, however we use a rule from Twlight:2000 that an aimed shot
can be aimed at a particular location, at a +1 Diff Mod. Note that this
means that obly the first shot (or first 3 with a Laser Sight) can be aimed
this way.

Way behind on TMLs as usual, but just wanted to thank Peter Newman for his
review of our BITS product 101 Lifeforms. Like all BITS products, this was
written by members of CORE.

>This book is significant :)	

Hopefully so!

>Details on getting CORE products can be found at their website at:

I\'m afraid that lack of time on my part means that this site hasn\'t been
kept up to date. The BITS and CORE web sites will shortly be revised to
appear under the domains:

bits.org.uk
core.org.uk

However, Traveller fans in the UK can obtain the 101 books (101 Cargos, 101
Plots, 101 Rendezvous, 101 Travellers, 101 Lifeforms) from any good RPG
shop (we distribute the 101 series through both Esdevium Games and Hobby
Games so even if you can\'t see it on the shelf, your FLGS can order it for
you).

For fans in the US, the low cost of each book (about $7-8) means that it\'s
not very efficient to mail order it from us (air mail costs a lot!). We are
investigating the possibility of \'proper\' distribution in the US, but this
process has been held up because of a lack of contact currently with IG
(California). Of course, it may be possible for some US FLGS\'s to order
direct from Esdevium or Hobby Games in the UK. If anyone has any contacts
in the business, please get in touch.

Otherwise, as soon as I can confirm the availability of BITS products in
the USA et al, I\'ll let the TML know.

Incidentally, having been out for a while, has everyone heard that SJG
WON\'T be going to the US GenCon this year, due to the increased booth
prices charged by WotC? I wonder what IG\'s thoughts are (i.e. can they
afford a booth at all?). What will happen to the UK GenCon? Anyone got any
information on this? [Apologies if it has already been discussed.]

I would take a clue from Starship Troopers (the novel) and make them just
like any other military character.  A marine chaplain would be trained as a
marine, a navy chaplain as a sailor, etc.  "In the infantry everybody

Since neither Dave nor Guy have said anything, I will.  In FF&S2 this is
addressed.  Not with words, but in the design sequence.  When designing a
hull, you have to find it\'s structural factor (SF).  This takes into account
just the phenomina under discussion.  This is why for a 1KTd ship the
structure takes up 0.0026% of the total while on a 1MTd ship it takes up
0.0832% of the total volume if both ships are built using superdense
structural material and designed to pull 1 G.

What do you mean new?  Resources are the oldest coin around.  Look around,
you see people trading on the future of resources.  The common medium of
exchange is money, but they are speculating on the resources.  I bet you\'ve
heard of sugar futures, gold futures, pork bellies, soy beans, etc., they
are all resources from which things are made.

Ah, now you\'ve hit on why the Imps would discourage the use of
nanotechnology.  Antiagathics, such a mainstay of SF in general seems to be
nix and verboten in the Imperial realm.  Out-side the empire who knows what
you would find.

You might try reading *A is for Anything*.  The author (who\'s name escapes
me just now) deals with exactly this question.  His technology is not nano
but it will duplicate anything, even people.  It doesn\'t even need
resources, just an original.  In it some things are labeled one of a kind
and duplicating them is a capital crime.  But then again, so is dis\'in\' your
master.

This makes sense.  But in the case of HEPlaR, I was thinking of improvements
based on the greater understanding of gravity and the resultant improvements
in materials that brings about.  After all if it\'s possible to make a
diamond the size and shape of a picture window, I should think that this
would have some bearing on the matter.  If the plasma were held a little
longer and made a little hotter, I would think that would improve the
performance.  If smaller components could do the same job that would also
improve your output per cubic meter of engine.  If these things were
improved you could probably also increase the fuel flow while still
increasing the heat per unit, etc.  Result, an improved HEPlaR drive with a
smaller minimum size.

When the subject of jump gates was first introduced on the TML, I =

create a tunnel of real space through the jump space.  This is what is =
referred to as the jump bubble.  Because of the speeds that must be =

Perhaps an illustration would help me to explain.

except that the jump gate staff would have fuel ready at all times.

I see the jump gate being located above the plane of the stellar system =

conventional methods and rules.

There you have it.  Jumpgates, take one.

I don\'t know about that, I\'ve had a ringworld in the last couple of

So, you\'re going to have a solid band with windows rather that the more
Niven-esque blocks and strings arangement.  So far so good.

That depends on a number of things which I can\'t answer from your narrative
or picture.  Here are some temperature projections based on circular windows
that allow a circle of light 50% wider than the belt.  The bands are at
%ages from the center.  These are averages based on an overall average
similar to earth\'s.

BAND  deg. C    deg. F
  -50    -11.042   12.125

AVG:   15.000    59.000

You will note that the central bands are hottest and the closer to the
center the less the temperature variation.  This will be true no matter what
the eccentricity of the oval is.  If you used oval (rather than square)
blocks you would have the same effect but the temperatures would be highest
on the outside and lowest in the center.  Perhaps you should consider using
trapezoidal blocks or windows which would give you a more uniform variation.

It\'s just a thought.

If I remember correctly the IFF transponders were turned off during

If it results in death, its never a minor mistake.

Must be "our" Norris\'s dad.  At that point, the Norris of the 5FW should
be about twenty years old, and a very junior officer in the Imperial Navy.
(This to fit with some other statements about his having to give up his
career as a commander in naval intelligence with the death of his older
brother in the years after the war.)

I disagree with this statement. Escort carriers serve a very important roll
in my eyes. They have the capabilities of an escort to protect their
carrier, and yet can also service a supporting fighter group. If the main
carrier suffers damage to her fighter bays, the escorts can help pick up
the slack.

Oh come on!  The Pirates should have won the NL Central last year!

From what I\'ve read, SJG, Palladium, Dream Pod 9, and several other middle
sized and larger companies have decided GenCon is no longer worth the
expense.  SJ says the rate for booths is ridiculous, and the owner of DP9
made the excellent point that the same people come to GenCon every year,
making it difficult to expand their fan base.

SJG is going to WorldCon in Baltimore, and many people are pointing to
DragonCon in Atlanta as the next big game con.

 Running will do no good.  It was proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that even if
the SDB in orbit around the planet is not prepared to give chase, there are
enough of them for one to be waiting for you at whatever jomp point you will
have chosen.

Actually, close.  But instead of explode, I wanted them to all

Yes, between a TL 9 J-1 and a TL 15 J-1 there is not a lot of 
improvement, apparently.  However, the step from J-4 to J-5 for instance 
is a huge leap (for mankind or any race for that matter).  How is that 
just an engineering advance?  Explain that to me please, cause I don\'t

Dead Eye,

Do you still train pilots on recognizing silhouettes? (sp)  How \'bout 
the air defense artillery guys?

I remember my dad telling stories of his youth when they used to make 
models of the WWII aircraft painted black for use by the flight students 
in training so that they could recognize what type of aircraft they were 
looking at.  They made all kinds from enemy airforces as well as the 
U.S. and allied forces.  

IFF in those days was what it looked like.  You pretty much knew that a 
P51D (Mustang) was not an enemy!  And I\'m sure that the other side did 
the same thing.  We have systems in place now because of the ranges and 
capabilities of our weapons systems.  As you stretch the ranges out even 
further, it becomes more critical to have a positive ID.

I\'ve read "Boat of a million years" in fact, just within the past few
months.  I\'ll have to re-read again.  As to what you say about nano-tech
not being viable, apparently a great many scientists believe otherwise. 
I\'ve been researching this on the web and turned up quite a few research
sites on this subject.  The current conscensus is that this technology
IS going to change things, and drastically.

I\'d also have to disagree with your "atoms are more like a snowflake in
a snowstorm" allusion.  Atoms ARE building blocks, otherwise how else do
you explain \'matter\'?

Anyway, thanks for the reply.  I\'m getting info from the various web
sites on this, but none of them can give me the \'imaginative\' forecasts
that I need, which is why I posed the question here.  In fact, I would
accept such speculation that \'holding to Traveller canon\' would not
allow.

Another good point made earlier in this discussion, leads me to believe
that not more then 1000 years of future history can be surmised without
a \'long night\' breaking the time up or the society and technology will
be so advanced as to be incomprehensible to us and in terms of role
playing.

I would be a bit surprised if you could, assuming Dave is using a decent
key.  PGP is fairly secure, as it is related to the NP-complete problem of
factoring arbitrary large numbers.  If you have a means of cracking PGP
signatures in real time, then a lot of governments want to talk to you.
Now if you want to run an rc5 contest in your spare time, you probably
could crack one message fairly easily, but it would take you a while.

Consider - Word Y0018 comes on ten terabytes of disk.  Go ahead and use a
ten gig key, which would not be cracked anytime soon, and which a TL9
computer would not be able to decrypt fast in months, but a TL12 one can
undo in seconds.

In my games, most combat is actually between software, such that if you
have a substantial tech advantage, you can do good things like spoof IFF,
futs with EW, and have all sorts of fun.  As soon as there is tech parity,
you have to fight the old fashioned way, which is why the Imperium is so
concerned about TL11 and 12 planets.

Better check when the Solomani Hypothesis was accepted. In fact, if 
it\'s still a controversial issue, might be a good idea to avoid the

How about for ships out on patrol? They\'re going to need to know *in 
advance* what the codes are going to be, otherwise the system defence forces 
are going to blow the **** out of them when they jump back in-system. Same 
situation if two patrolling ships meet. It\'s going to have to be something 
the computer can generate. Capture an enemy ship intact, without anybody 
knowing (tricky, admittedly), and you\'ve got the codes.

Depends.  IMTU, the closest thing to an Imperial religion is a faith that
worships stars as sentient, powerful beings.  So chaplains would probably
be drawn from a moderate branch of that religion.  Then of course, you have
minority religions, which can cause headaches.

I question your comment about the military justifying their actions on a
religious basis.  At least in the US Army, we did what we did because we
had volunteered, and were subject to orders.  American troops have
fine-tuned BS detectors, and appeals to a higher moral level will send the
needle of the scale.

Funny, I was never motivated by religious feelings...  Take for example a
Virasian Chaplain addressing Marines  "Well men, good luck, and remember if
you die here, so far from Dlan, your souls will roast in hell.  Amen."

I think you overstate the importance of religion to a soldier.  When I did
Basic, we had to attend chapel our first week.  There we received a lecture
about religious and spiritual services avalible to the trainees.  (There
was also the tackiest painting I ever saw:  Jesus striding forward holding
a banner that read "Follow Me", the motto of the Infantry!)  After that,
Sunday services were optional.  By week four, there were only three guys
from my platoon of 40 who were still going, the rest of us prefering to
read the one newspaer a week we were allowed, or catch up on uniform
maitenece.

>So that would mean Military Chaplans of some sort.  So how do we handle them?

The same way that soldiers do.  Ignore them.

In my eyes, the old DGP-Traveller pics in the Alien books, the Digest

Well, most of what IG has produced is non-canon anyways (just look at FS
and other Abominations!). As a ules system, GT won´ t be used by the
,majority on this list, but that isn´ t the point: GT will be
sourcebooks to us! For thiose Gurps-Players interested in Traveller, the
rules will be a boon, but we don´ t have to change... we´ ll just use
the source materials, the world discriptions, the adventures!

How\'s he going to *get* it? *Because* they can be mis-used that way,
they\'ll be gaurded better than most weapons!

Also, having the transpnder is of little use. After all, you have to
fifure that one of more of your ships will get captured *eventually*.
And replacing all the transponders if that happened would be *way* too
much trouble and expense.

You not only have to have the right transponder, you have to have the
list of codes to program into it for the current time period. They\'ll
change *daily*.

It\'s the "generally accepted works". So for Traveller, it\'s the

the charges with VISA, and reserved copies at a games shop in Ottawa. 
Even when the charges are reversed, IG will still owe me a book for my

Yamamoto wasn\'t real thrilled when he was informed that the Washington
Embassy hadn\'t delivered the declaration of war until *after* the
attack, either.

If they hadn\'t messed up in being overly restrictive in their
instructions on how the embassy was to handle the message, they\'d have
delivered delivered the declaration of war at least 30 minutes before
the attack. And in that case, while the US would have still been plenty
angry, most of the sense of sheer *outrage* would have been gone.

As it was the declaration was a couple of hours *late* because the best
typists allowed to work on it could only do about 10 words a minute in
English. 

Referrees should keep this lesson in mind if their players ever try to
set something up where timing is critical, but so is secrecy. :-)

So look at me. I bought a german version of the Traveller Book in 1991,
when I began my studies in Chemistry. I had seen the Book years before
at a games warehouse, but never new what it was until I learned about a
Roleplaying Games Shop near the University. And even then it took me
another five years to start my first campaigns in Roleplaying ever.
So who is _late_?

And I believe we shout await the GURPS:Traveller line as it is a problem
of IG (IMHO) that they stand alone with their Traveller products.
It was GDW that started with Traveller, but it\'s not been them alone to
make it that popular, as there has been much support of DGP, Seeker and
many other Publishers, as bad as they may have been.
Remember what happened, when TNE Traveller came out: DGP didn\'t want to
switch that soon to a new line and cancelled their MT line. No other TNE
material than from GDW has been published. They had their backs to the
wall - a situation thats remarkable similar to IG.
But now, with GURPS backing Traveller by bringing it to their fandom
should help both, IG and Traveller fans to get this RPG back on popularity
outside the Traveller fandom.

I hope that the GURPS line will change this in Germany, as I see here not
much of the new material - I have to personally order it in the shops,
else it won\'t come. There\'s one store which sells stacks of supplements
with a price of $ = DM. But they are catching dust there under the
shelves. Another shop has put the T4 Books under their GURPS line on the
floor - I think they know what they are waiting for.

What about Arabic? This would fit more to the look of these people,

Sword Worlders language is described as sort of icelandic in canon.
You\'d better make this Danish or Swedish if you don\'t speak Icelandic ...
Or try a German Accent? As Afrikaans comes from a hollandish dialect,
(don\'t know if this is called flemic in english) the language would be
similar.
Sometimes people from Germany and the Netherlands can converse without
translator. But the accent shows the differences.

Playing Traveller in German Language clearly changes this little. You\'ve
got also a broad variety of dialects in this land, one being specific to
the city of Cologne I come from. But I hate it. There are not much
dialects I like. So I tend more to accents of other languages.

The use of a language or dialect for alien characters is not new to me.
Short ago the DM of the AD&D campaign I\'m playing in came to me and
suggested the use of some \'elven\' words or curses, As I didn\'t get the
Silmarillion yet, I thought about taking them from an existing language.
My favourite would have been french, but the DM doesn\'t like it and it
does not fit that well as everyone would know which language it is. So now
my Elf is speaking a kind of Connacht-Gaelic when he\'s very upset ...

In Traveller there are no nanofabs as far as I can tell from the sources.
If there were Drexler style nanos in Traveller the societys would be VASTLY
different from that depicted in Traveller. Read Poul Andersons "The boat of
a million years" to see what can happen to societies when they get nano
tech. Personally I don\'t think nano tech will ever be available for
scietific reasons. Drexler et al are computer scientists with no real
knowledge of molecules etc. If atoms where lego parts then it would be
possible but they\'re more like snowflakes in a snowstorm.

"The Death of Wisdom" and "To Dream of Chaos", both by Paul Brunette.
the third book was "going" to be titled, "The Backwards Mask". IIRC, Paul
Brunette was going to do that one, as well.

I thought that the novels needed some stronger characterization to them. 
However, it was (IMHO) apparent that Paul\'s writing ability was deffinitely
improving,
with the story line and the characterization. I felt that after a few more
novels,
Paul\'s novels would have been top notch-which would have been a nice
addition and 
marketing tool for Traveller, in general.

With some of the books\' short falls, I still enjoyed the stories. It was

some of the Traveller "toys", concepts, aliens, etc in the context of a

    'body' => 'Hello Folks,
  Just figured I would mention this to you all...

  Some time back, my wife and I were driving in the car to Rochester New
York (home of Crazy Egor).  We got onto the topic of Traveller.  What
prompted the discussion was that Steve Jackson games would be doing a GURPS
TRAVELLER.  My wife knows that I used to LOVE playing CT, and she knows of
my collection of CT, MT, TNE, and T4.  She later wondered why I would be so
happy about GURPS TRAVELLER, aside from the fact that I am a GURPS GM, and
would play the TRAVELLER UNIVERSE for the fun of it?
  This was before the problems that IG had, but I pointed out to her, that
it would benefit IG to link up with GURPS in supporting Traveller because
it would likely create a market for each company\'s products in the
Traveller universe.  By that point in time though, I had come to dislike
T4\'s dice system, and felt that it would not be worth my while to attempt
to switch to the game system (after we as a group tried it for some
time...).  However, I have since picked up Mileu Zero Hardcover, FF&S (for
one lousy equation no less - Bussard Ramscoop creation rules!), and
finally, Pocket Empires.  I fully intend to use these in a GURPS TRAVELLER
setting...

  Already, the cross fertilization concept has borne fruit for IG.  I feel
badly for a few of you who were disappointed with currently events - for I
would love to see Traveller continue.  I fervently hope that T4.1 makes it
off the starting blocks, and that things improve for the Traveller community.

The ones that targetted out of the galactic plane where never heard from
because soon after establishing a colony they discovered jumpdrives and
after that they could\'n afford to go sublight. Nah, I\'m kidding, we would
be able to talk with lasers between systems above or below the plane so
there should be ample reason for visiting them esp. early on. It is better
to argue that jump distances are 2D due to j-space topology etc but I
personally don\'t like that either.

Unlike most professions, aviation (and arms in general) brook no

Curiously Ridley (Blade Runner & Alien I) Scott was working on a Dune
version prior to Alien but it was stopped because Herbert felt they strayed
too much from the original story (hints at an incestous relation between
Paul and his mother which doesnt seem too far out to me). When Dune was
actually made (by David Lynch, notive how they tend to forget that one when
listing all his movies in intervies) I bet (my guess only) Herbert was
already terminal in cancer and wanted a movie to be made no matter what and
thus the sad result. Lynch was quoted during shooting of actually never
having read the books but having them "...explained to him..." by someone.
Ooops entirely off subject, here\'s a slight remedy.
Those genetically engineered humans for adaption to desert environment
mentioned in DGP stuff, has anybody used them in campaigns?

Nono, the Ancients didn\'t build the jumspace, the progenitors did
(according to my brand of heresy). When Yaskoydroy finally realised that he
was disturbing some galactic sized engineering project (the ancients used
j-space A LOT) he killed off his children, hid inside a pocket universe and
now and then came out to sprinkle tech and j-drive knowledge to all "major"
races, all to put the blame for disturbing jumpdrive on them.
Was Y the ULTIMATE chicken or was there really a reason for hime being so
afraid that he practically quit from the universe in fear of the
progenitors revenge...?

Great idea about Telepathic problems with jumpspace. Maybe the jumpspace
corridor from the galactic core through known spave and out towards the rim
is just a BIG serious bandwidth telepathic backbone for the progenitors and
that tose pesky sophonts jumping about in their laughable ships give the
progenitors a migraine or something and now they\'re back to kick
interstellar ass with jumpo-inhibitors, antimatter bombs and von Neuman
robotic ships. Neat. I\'ll use it (probably).

Exactly!  Introducing "easy" characters leads to _hardness_.

Whereas with the Vilani, formality and stiffness leads to ease of
translation.  You can just plunge in and have your way with it.
Linguistically speaking.

The Manifesto is, yes, on my short list.  "The spectre of Sayatism haunts
Known Space..."  "...all that is superdense boils into plasma..."  Because
it\'s so much more politically oriented, though, it\'s hard to translate in
any "realistic" way into 50th ct. C.E. Sayat.

Of course, judicious and creative translation of, say, Mayakovsky would
permit me to COMBINE the broad thematic contents of _Macho Sluts_ and _The
Communist Manifesto_...

And I\'d never have thought of this without the mediation of Traveller.
Probably.

Proust is _still_ waiting to be retranslated into his original Vilani.
We\'ll show those warty-faced Klingon wankers a thing or two.  O yes.

"Essentialist" explanation of Zhodani aside, I actually picture Zdetl as
having a Slavic-like phonology (with a dash of Lushootseed or Kwakwala)
with an Eskimo and/or Salishan-like morphology and syntax.  So it would
_sound_ vaguely Russian.  With lateralization taking the characteristic
place of palatalization in Russian, maybe.

I agree; some sort of Scandinavian accent works better for me, for the

Yeah, very good point and one that is almost always overlooked.  I got

 The standard, canon Jump field takes a week to form and collapse, regardless of

Double Adventure 5: The Chamax Plague concerns the planet of
a possibly extinct race of intelligent spacefaring crustaceans.
Their planet, Chamax, just spinward of Uniqua and Garoo of the
Darrian subsector, has been overrun by a pestilence, but some
of their sublight ships may contain the vestiges of civilization
in cold sleep.

Adventure 10: Safari Ship, concerns the search for a beautiful
animal, and may lead to the discovery of another intelligent
race, which never reached above TL3 or so.  This race is well
described, with tables for character generation et al.

My design is to make these two species the same.

My handwave: Chamax is the homeworld.  The sapients there have
long been civilized and peaceful, with a low birth rate.  They
are crustacean, with cilia or tiny, soft spines that is somewhat
like fur.

How did they get to the Safari world, 10 parsecs away?  This is
4000 years by their conventional drive, and requires them to
have TL 9 (sans jump) at least 50,000 years ago.

1. A group of them were transported ten parsecs by the Ancients,
   to the second world visited in Safari Ship.

   Con: this is a cop-out.

2. One of them once had psionic ability such that it could teleport
   a breeding population there.

   Con: this sounds unreasonable.

3. They colonised several worlds in aeons past, before calamity
   disrupted their technological base.

   Con: they are hardy stock.  Why aren\'t there more colonies?

4. The Ancients connected jumpgates to both worlds (long since
   destroyed).

   Con: I hate relying on jumpgates for explanations.

5. ?

3 and 4 requires that they had technology.  Perhaps the Ancients
left technology there that was helpful enough to boost their TL
up at an early age.

If these critters can be player characters, then they cannot be
frail at all.  Indeed, the stats for them are:

Str: 3D	 Dex: 2D  End: 3D  Int: 2D  Edu: 1D

...they are strong and hardy, so a colony would not fail easily.

Does anyone have any ideas?

very much for your excellent work Andrew).


FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Sylea/Core:

Svenson Small Craft LIC, the manufacturers of the FL12S/L, currently
the standard Light Fighter of the Third Imperium, proudly announces
the release of the Wasp class of fighters. They are called Wasps
because of the sting from powerful laser weapons they carry. The
unique dome design allows the Wasp to take a minimum of surface
area on the mother ship\'s hull when carried externally.

Each Wasp features a powerful laser weapon and operates at a fast 5G
performance. The hull is streamlined to allow operations within
planetary atmospheres.

Originally designed for a private shipping company as protection
from pirates and intended to be carried on their frontier freighters.
The original specifications called for a 10 dton fighter, with a 250Mj
laser, 5G performance and carry a crew of two for a week.

When it was determined that the original specification could not be
met the following three models were produced, each meeting part
of the original requirements.

The first model, the FM12DL, is the smallest fighter that would
satisfy all of the other requirements (5G, 250 Mj laser and two man
crew operating for a week comfortably). Originally built with a
bunk, the bunk has been removed and replaced with missile tubes.
Forcing the crew to sleep in their G tanks.

The second model, the FM12DL2, is the smallest fighter that would
carry the 250 Mj laser and operate at 5G.

The third model, the FL12DS, is a 10 dton fighter with the largest
laser that could be mounted in it (200 Mj) and still operate at 5G.

The Imperial Navy has ordered a small number of each model for
evaluation. Large orders of all three models are anticipated which
will substantially reduce the prices in the future.

This is as close as I could come to the base requirements, except
for size. It includes a fresher and microwave for long duration
missions. The 3 missile tubes are built for 0.3std ton missiles.
Installing 2 missile tubes with standard 0.5std ton missiles in
place of the 3 small tubes and the storage does not substantially
impact the price or performance.

Research division #83 announces the introduction of a new 
technology!  The current working name for the technology is 
"Modular Memory."

Modular Memory is a method of engram storage that seems to 
work quite well for any creature with a brain.  Early tests on a 
variety of life forms seems to confirm that the only prerequisite 
for implementation is a brain or similar major nerve bundle.

The implementation starts with a deep neural scan to establish 
topography and neural pathways.  Our present modeling 
computers are then able to design a surgical schedule and 
procedure for implementation of stage 2.

Implementation stage 2 involves the surgical emplacement of 
neurochemical/neuroelectrical links to the memory transfer 
facility.

External memory storage can record the memories as they 
happen.

Plugs of diverse memory can be added after initial surgery.

Initially recollection of added memory takes concentration on 
surgical procedure, then following the memory down the new 
path.

Eventual integration of new memories takes place in the 
normal manner.

Side effects:  bizarre dreams during integration process.  
Divergence from normal seems to follow a bell curve the height 
and width of which varies by the individual and the length of the 
memory plug.

Eventual goals:  Integration into various mechanical systems.  
Perfect memory for clones of self.  Travel experience w/o 
travelling.  Etc.

My problem with the MT backround is that playing during wartime sucks.
Either you are an insignificant nobody as mighty fleets roll past, or you
are part of the military, with limited options.  From where I sit, most MT
campaigns stayed in the SM, and ignored the whole thing.

On the other hand, the aftermath of wars makes a great enviroment.  I\'m
sketching out ideas for the Arbellatra Regency.  Since I love Conspiracy
theories, I\'m playing with the idea that a true heir is found (the
great-great-granddaughter of Martin V), and factions either try to put the
girl on the throne, where she can be easily manipulated, hustle her off the
scenen so that Arbellatra can eventual take the crown, or kill her outright.

Add in trials of war criminals, and everone scrambling for power in the
post-bellum vaccuum....

Andrew, ever read about SIOP for handleing nuclear launch codes?  IFF codes
will be handled much the same way.  Stored in a safe with a quick self
destruct code, two officers required to retrieve the days code,  code
entered manualy with the computer making sure that the person entering the
codes is cooresponds with how is supposed to be there.

If all else fails, Arrival Vengence mentioned the existence of Q codes
(IIRC); a set of one-time code pads that identify a ship as Imperial to any
friendly ship or installation.  At the very least, you\'d get looked over
before they opened fire.

Ouch.  Alas, according to canon, since the jumpfield doesn\'t get more than
a meter or two away from the object, it wouldn\'t really work.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Traveller New Era explained working IFF boxes by saying that each one was a dedicated Artificial Intelligence. When two ships got in range of each other, the boxes would "talk" to each other - not by some pre-arranged sequence of codes, but as two acquiantances would. for example:

AX7119: Hi, I\'m the Imperial Battlecruiser _Jade Solstice_
KH4546: Hi AX7119, what you been up to?
AX7119: A little patrol, a little showing the flag, you know...

And so on for eternal milliseconds of small talk. Eventually, your transponder would in some fuzzy-logic way decide if the other transponder was telling the truth - after a conversation so fast and esoteric that only another transponder AI could follow it. It appeared from the write-up that your transponder would give you probabilities - "Approaching ship is 97% probable Fleet Tender _Tir Aggasham_" - and the Captain would have to decide whether to believe the transponder or not.

These intelligent transponders were made and sold by the 3rd Imperium to whomever wanted to buy them - and if you wanted to trade in Imperial space, you had to buy one. They would set it for the ship you bought it for, and it wouldn\'t work on another ship - if you tried to move it, the other boxes would know.

How did these IFF boxes know each other? Well it seems they were all "descendents" of the same AI computer, so had a lot of personality quirks and instincts that were similar - enough so that a forged or altered IFF box would communicate differently during the "small talk" mentioned above and be identified as wrong.

Where did the Imperium get this technology? Well it seems they found it - on a vacuum plain on Cymbeline. A species of naturally occurring intelligent "computer" chips, a natural silicon-based intelligence that could be bred in captivity - bred and introduced into transponder boxes.

The chips that would, during the Rebellion, be the ancestors of Virus.

Well, first a minor correction of terms.  A sector is a area about 32
parsecs by 40 parsecs.  A jump-1 covers 1 parsec in one week.  Higher jump
numbers do not cut down on transit time.  All jumps, regardless of distance
or engine rating take between 144-185 hours (centering on 168 hours.)

Hi Hans!

I guess it was after I-200 then...and the Solomani were still
propagandizing at the birth of Cleon\'s Imperium.  But I guess it 
does show strong Solomani influences. Thanks for the very salient

	S small ship comes in mind with 6 missile bays able to host a fighter
	when empty. So the missile bay could also used as a hangar. The ship
	would have about a dozen fire controls, 4 pd lasers, 4 sandcasters,
	moderate armor and good evasion. A Missile corvette able to pick up

	the missiles have been delivered. Corvettes are to light to stand
	in the line of battle for long.

   I now a good time to bring up my idea about how the Marines should be an
Army organization, in the same way that the 82nd Airborne and 101st Air
Assault divisions are?  :-)

   All you have to do is take one look in a Marine tactics manual and see
that to be a good Marine you must be an extremist and *very* dangerous.

   If I have one knock on the US Marines, it is their rather...interesting
behavior with regard to marching.  I recall riding my bicycle across a
portion of Ft. Bliss, TX one day while I was attending Officer Basic Course
and seeing two Marines, one calling cadence the other marching smartly down
the side of the road responding to the other Marine\'s command.  That\'s
right, drill and ceremony for a column of one!  I didn\'t know quite what to
make of that one....but I can tell you that an Army 2LT on a bicycle doesn\'t
rate a salute (as long as they were pretending to be a column, they could
have at least pretended I was an officer! <grumble>).

Harold

   Seeing what I have of the US Army, it makes sense to me.  
   After about 2 weeks in the USMC you BELIEVE in God.  You WILL believe in
something. Attendance is VERY high.  It\'s quite optional, of course.  There
was maybe one obstinate (out of a platoon of 83) who wanted to stay w/ the
DIs, alone, and he "saw the light" after about the 3rd week IIRC... : )  We
got ONE hour a week away from the Drill Instructors (the most sadistic men
it\'s been my fortune to meet).  Total.   For thirteen weeks.  That\'s it and
everyone was quite eager for that hour of peace and to pray for deliverance.
lol.  Yes indeed... you do find religion in the USMC.
    Our \'uniform maintnance\' (ironing, sewing, etc) came during rack time
before or after firewatch.  Letter writing... sit down head calls... that all
came out of rack time.
    There were additional mandatory classes from the Chaplain on suicide,
"STDs and male Marine," and a couple others i can\'t recall at the moment.

 Now, having said that the canon field takes a week to form and collapse, I
would like to add:

I am currently running a campaign where one of the players is in a
grossly-modified scout ship.  These PCs ran with a scientist NPC (Dr. Jones) who
was a Jump Space theorist.  It became necessary to get somewhere very quickly
(beat out a bunch of mutineers that stole a yatch) - so Dr. Jones went and
fiddled with the jump engines.  Result - a +1 to the misjump when running in the
new configuration, but you come out of jumpspace a day earlier.  (Dr. Jones said
he could shave off two days, but he wouldn\'t ride in the ship then...they
decided to pass).  The other, more serious side effect is that the computer can
no longer adequately run the jump cycle.  It requires constant (7x24)
supervision by the engineer (which my PC found out the hard way - fortunately,
he had a large supply of \'speeders\' to keep him awake the first time he tried to
run in the new configuration _after_  Jones left the ship).

He is currently sweating his upcoming annual maintenance - both on how to keep
the new configuration and how to explain all the broken seals on the \'do not
open - Depot level maintenance only\' inspection hatches on his J-Drive and
P-Plant.

"Does anyone have any ideas?"

Oooh, good one!  Actually an answer is in front of you already.  We know
from Chamax Plague that the hapless Chamaxi had spacefaring capability (but
not Jump Drive), and were forced to build a fleet of sublight ships to flee
the bugs.  Who is to say that they did not attempt an earlier sublight
colony effort?  Or that one of the escaping colony vessels was of a
somewhat better design and was able to achive a greater % of C, and so got
them to the Safari world a few hundred years before the rest of the fleet
reached its targets.

In fact, the one good escape vessel might have been a colony vessel under
construction before the bug plague was discovered.  The Chamaxi had to cut
a lot of corners and go for wimpier drives for the rest of the escape
fleet, but they had one vessel that was larger and faster, and which
perhaps left a few years earlier.

And of course, somewhere on the Safari world there will be a big colony
ship (or its remains), or perhaps damaged bits and pieces of same in orbit.
Another clue.  Somebody really obnoxiuous might even put some bugs into the
mix...

Something to think about, anyway.  I loved the Chamax Plague:Horde double
adventure, and the PCs in my campaign actually became a sort of
Exterminator For Hire company, providing advice and technical (military)
assistance to several nearby worlds also infested with the Chamax.

  Each computer would require a password or code to be entered into the

the codes, the IFF squawkbox will not last longer than 24 hours before

We had about three hours on Sunday.  You could do whatever you wanted that
didn\'t involve sleeping or leaving the barracks.  Writing home, reading the
Atlanta Constitution-Journal for the capsule review of last week\'s Niner
game, doing uniform maitenence were all very popular.  As was Drill
sergeant Giles\' *volunteer* PT.  Drill sergeant Giles was a %&*%&$ MARATHON
RUNNER, who had competed in the LA Olympics!!!  He never got tired!  He was
a frigging Terminator!  Of course, the PT was completely voluntary..

I couldn\'t agree more.  I mean, of course our predecessors around the year
998 C.E. failed to forsee the shape of even 500 years of their future, but
then they weren\'t as smart and practical as we are.  Our masturbatory
fantasies about _our_ next thousand years are, on the contrary, all going
to come true.

A terrorist or corporate sabotage weapon: place a J-1 drive and some gas in a
100-ton shipping container. Set it to (mis)jump a few days after the incredibly
expensive multi-kiloton bulk cargo carrier enters jump space.

Easy to detect if the shipping line is looking for it, pretty expensive for a
bomb - but it won\'t look like a bomb unless their security people are expecting
it. It could even ship quite innocuosly as a Scout/Courier being delivered as
cargo.

What happens if a jump drive tries to open a jump bubble inside a stable jump
bubble? Does it fail, or does it destabilize the big jump bubble? I have a
feeling no one has ever come back to tell us what this does when you try it.

If you don\'t care whether or not your drive survives jump initiation, do you
need it to be in a 100 dton package? Could your shipping crate just have a jump
drive, short-term power plant and a small measure of fuel (allowing it to be
much smaller)?

The is a Ringworld in the Vargr Extents, left unfinished.  Evidently, which

there is also a multi-world rosette out there in doggie space.

Excellent idea.  In CT / MT I built several versions of the Victory class,
a sub-1000dt ship with 10-15 small fighters.  Its official designation is
"patrol carrier", and it is often assigned specialized scouting units in
place of some of its dedicated attack craft.  The ship itself is a fully
armed and armored combatant, as well -- at least one version sports a
nuclear damper and particle accelerators.  At least half of the fighters
are primarily used to pick up contacts, which the mothership (bearing the
other half of the fighters) then moves to prosecute.  If the contact is
too large to handle, the mothership evades instead, picking up the other
fighters and sacrificing only the one, jumping or doing whatever else is
necessary to alert friendly forces to the larger threat. 

Such ships are mass-produced in significant numbers and used to insure
border integrity against small threats (corsairs, raiders).  In wartime
they are collected and used to supplement the capital escort and fighter
wings.  It\'s generally a quick and easy way to deploy fully supported
fighter squadrons to forward areas.  Standard tactics entail the fighters
attacking at point-blank range while the mothership supports them with
standoff weaponry (missiles or particle weapons).

A related concept is the SDB tender:  a 5000 dt or so vessel that is used
to redeploy SDB squadrons along the frontier to wherever they are most
needed.  In wartime, it doubles as a BRL tender.  I actually built one of
these with FF&S1 for use with Battle Rider.  It was not designed as a real
combatant, though.

Full size battle tenders can (in theory) be used the same way, but in
practice they would probably only be used to effect delivery of riders
intended for monitor duties into areas that lack the industry to produce
them, but which do have the money to *purchase* them.

From my Lunion Campaign:

Sword Worlders:  Mostly German/Danish.  I tend to make the Combined
Force/Intellegence ops sound like SS form bad WWII movies.  

"Gut Day, I am here to purchase zom boot polish, You have this?"

Zhodani:  Chinese phrasing, with exagerated clicks and pops.  Looking at
Zhdatl, it appears to have a lot in common with the tongue of the bushmen,
or other African languagues. 

"I greet you, proprietor, I ask your assitance in acquiring these goods, if
you would be so kind."

Lunion:  New Yawkers.  Lunion is a meritocracy, you spend you life being
constantly examined for placement, jobs.  It has lead to a rather neurotic
planetary culture.  Fast talking, intense, short attention span.  (Joke
told about Lunionese:  A young man from Lunion had just wed, and was in the
honeymoon suite of the best hotel in orbit.  His new wife comes out of the
dressing room in the sexiest lingerie to be found, smiles at him, and says
"come here, and make me feel like a real woman!"  At that, the man starts
crying, sobbing "I\'m a failure as a husband" over and over.  Concerned, his
wife asks him what does he mean?  The man raises his tear streaked face,
and cries out:  "I didn\'t study for this part!")

"Hey! I need a copy of the Lunion Business Journal!  come on!  I don\'t have
all year!"

Strouden:  For some reason, they sound like B5\'s Centauri.  Considering the
planet was settled by Arameth Gridlore in 98, I shouldn\'t be surprised. :)

"Ah, Good Morning, my dear, dear friend, perhaps you might be able to sell
me a small amount of Trojan Fire Brandy, eh?"

Adabicci:  Colonial French accents, something like Vietnamese-accented
English.  This one needs to be heard, since the phrasing is no different.

To do Vargr, I keep my tongue pressed against my lower front teeth.  This
slurs some vowels nicely, and gives a nice feel to the speech.  Also, I
make sure that right after heavy exertion, my Vargr on speak in short, one
of two word burst to cover the reflexive panting.

"Human!  How much"<pause>"For the red white and orange \'Dreadnaughts\'
jacket?"<pause>"Ring it up!" *manical laughter*

Aslan tend not to speak much, and then are extraordinarily polite.  I am
very creful with gender forms.  I also roll everything when doing Aslan. 

"Good morrrrinnng, Kepperrrr of this storrre, I wish to purrchase a
quuanity of Dustspice."

The last real development I\'ve done is the Zaibonese, who are abrut, rude,
and to the point.  They also drop any form of speech that is ineffcient.
Any overly verbose individual will get a "Wasting Oxy" and be ignored.

"You. Needs buy, Howmuch?"

launch it\'s fighters and remain near the cargo ships.  the \'vettes anti-ship
weapons whould operate to nock out any pirate fighters that get to close...
once the destoyers and fighters do their thing hte \'vette would pick up its
fighters and continue on its way.

this would allow you to give a fighter escort to your corperate supporters
when in times of conflict. all this really is, is a cheap placebo (sp)...  it
makes the corp feel safe and keeps the weaker pirates off the convoys back.

the corvette/escort carrier would have a secondary mission as well... use in
commerce raider missions.

This is very true!  The only relationship the Imperium has to our real earth
is one of creation.  The earth of the Solomani is at best an alternate
reality version of ours.  Don\'t try to make things fit that never were
intended to.  If you insist on 3D space in your game, then it can\'t be
Traveller.  The 2D maps are part and parcel of the Traveller package.  If
you\'d ever tried to use a 3D map in Traveller, you\'d know why.

Let me show you what I mean.  Below is a 3D map that covers an 8 parsec
cube.  It contains 14 systems of interest (just like in Traveller).  There
may be other systems that are not shown because they are not habitable and
don\'t have gas giants, etc.  In order to simplify things, I have placed each
of the stars at an integer on each of the 3 coordinates (X,Y,Z).  On a map
of this scale, the ranges for each variable are -3 to 4.  I didn\'t put in a
scale because it causes the map to look wrong.  If you would like to see
what this map should look like and you can handle HTML email or have a .TXT
file reader/editor and can handle attachments, write me <cybernot@gte.net>.

|               *+4 *-3
|
|                             *-2          *+0
|
|               *-3                       *-2
|                             *+0 *+0

|                      *+1        *+0  *+4

Let\'s start in the upper left hand corner.  Do you see the star that has the
notation +4 beside it?  That star\'s coordinates would be (-3,4,4).  The X
and Y can be found by inspection, the Z coordinate is displayed as +4,
because it is 4 parsecs "above" the central plane.  The star which appears
closest to it (-2,4,-3) is in fact over 7 parsecs away.

To find the distance between them, you will have to use a ruler and some
trig.  First measure the distance between the two stars.  It is 1 parsec.
Then find the difference in the two Z coordinates (4-(-3)=7).  Then find the
square root of the product to the squares (sqr(1^2 + 7^2) = 7.071).
notations beside the stars.  In fact we find that the one that looks
farthest away the one in the lower right corner with a +4 notation (3,-3,4)
is in fact closer than some of the ones that look closer.  The distance
across the plane between these two stars is  9.220 parsecs and they are on
the same level so the total distance is only 9.22 parsecs.  It is only a
little over 2 parsecs further away than the one that looks like its right
next to it.

For some games the added complication would be worth while (if you don\'t
mind the math), but for Traveller, with it\'s jump engines,  the
complication, IMO, is unwarranted.

One week regardless of distance jumped.  It doesn\'t matter how far you jump,
it takes 1 week +/-.  The jump between Earth and Mars would take a week.
The jump between Sol and Alpha Centari would take a week.  If you misjumped
going from Sol to Alpha Centari and got lucky and emerged in the system of
Canopus (some 30 parsecs distance), it would still take you 1 week +/-.

Traveller\'s just funny that way.  :-)

	Well, yes and no. As far as jump drive is magical, yes. But the
volume is already calculated in the volume of the drive. As for a
coating, IIRC in SOpM the grid was spaced about 1m apart.

	FF&S2 accounts for this. For the same acceleration rating,
larger ships require a greater percentage of structural material
than smaller ships. Or, rephrased, a large ship with the same
relative amount of structure will have a lower acceleration than
a smaller ship.

	Not necessarily something that can be generated on board. By
analogy with today, you\'ll be issued a pack of sealed data
crystals, each containing one edition of the key. Furthermore,
you\'ll only be given a limited number. A COACC fighter would be
given a day\'s worth; an IN task force gets a few months\' worth,
assuming they\'ll be stopping at naval bases along the way every
few weeks, but might get lost or sumpin\'.

	The original application was validating astrographic updates.
The sig checking would be done automatically by program. Agreed,
relying on someone reading an email message to check a sig for
routine email isn\'t likely to happen. But for something that
critical (or for IFF signatures ...) it\'ll be built into the
software using the data. If you override the warning "WARNING!
Astrographic update not certified by IISS or corporate
astrography! Do you want to continue (Y/N)?," well, I think of
that as evolution in action.

	BTW, I\'ve already got signed keys on the servers. So you can try
to upload another key in my name; I don\'t recall if the servers
check for that. But it\'d be kind of curious to find one key
that\'s not signed by the previous keys. And the keyservers
automatically exchange info, so I\'m on all of them.

	Certainly, assuming you can get hold of one without damaging it,
remove it from its current mounting without triggering the
anti-tampering device, and get the current cryptokey (without
alerting anybody else). 

	First step is doable by any skilled player party.

	Second step would be an extremely hard (note
non-task-system-specific difficulty), but any Scotty-level
engineer can.

	Third step may not be necessary, depending on the cryptoperiod
(how frequently the keys change), and how long you want to use
it. If you\'re just trying to escape in the next ten minutes
without getting shot down, you should still be within the window.
If you\'re stealing it in system A, for a covert entry into system
B one jump and seven days later, you gotta get the future keys
WITHOUT leaving any sign --otherwise the enemy will send out an
emergency compromise message on the fastest couriers they\'ve got.

	For insystem or COACC IFF keys, where you can have fairly well
synced clocks and changeover, I\'d expect keys to change no less
often than daily, and probably more frequently. For IN subsector
forces, probably around monthly.

	Further, there\'d be different TYPES of IFF keys. The
least-changing keys would be keys that can be used to identify
you to ANY friendly. All that means is that they won\'t blow you
away immediately--you won\'t immediately be accepted into the
bosom of the fleet with gunports open, because the key is so
stale (and hence more likely to have been compromised, cracked,
or otherwise revealed).

	System forces will have another key they use to coordinate among
themselves. Likewise, ships in a single task force will have
another key Both of these would change more frequently, and have
a correspondingly higher level of trust.

Probably just an oversight.  Every marine I\'ve ever met was locked-on
so much that it was scary.  I\'m sure they\'d be bummed if they knew
they\'d missed that salute (but not too much).

According to the old book 2 CT rules, doesn\'t a misjump take anywhere from 1
to 6 weeks to complete, or has this been changed in later additions of
Traveller? I\'ve only recently gotten back into the game, and haven\'t had a
chance to check out most of the MT, TNE and T4 rules yet.

1140-1206: Rurevayn
	My va^h^hempire has a easy solution. Any ship has to carry a human
	transponder, the so called communication officier. If a ship doesn\'t
	answer hailing, or the human transponder thinks that an AI tries
	to cheat him : boom - old 3I transponders have long been disabled
	because of security reason. Sending a transponder, but not hailing
	is calling for OAD or COACC.

1088-1130: Third Empire
	I think the last 3I protocol was be to send the transponder-sqirk
	generated from a AI, imposible to fake (have you tried to fake
	a dog, that other dogs think its a dog) constantly connected
	to the ship computer network. The sqirk not only told the ship
	ID, but all jumps the ship has done since build, who are the
	commanding officers, the rest of the crew. When got weapons
	fired, did the ship got damage, what was on sensors, did the
	captain sleep with the lower ranks of the crew, ..., and last
	but most important, did the transponder turned offline. Normaly
	this sqirk was exchanged between transponders, and only a
	filtered set was printed or spoken by transponder translators on
	the comunication console of ships and starports. The abiltiy to
	detect hijacking and piracy attemts, by a simple transponder
	sqirk made this device so attractive over the old crypto based
	transponder that all ships within the 3I had to install it
	within 12 years.

	Even then hailing a ship before shooting at it was common practice
	to prevent accidents like that own troops who captured an enemy
	vessel during combat but lost one of their own, got killed by
	friendly fire when they exist jumpspace and call for port.
	During the rebellion, hailing and body swap become the most
	important IFF, as ships changed sides often.

400-1080: Third Empire
	The new transponder based on TL:13 holographic crytography was
	installed, as a second version protocol it suffererd all problems
	of any 2nd version implementations. It was buggy, feature ridden,
	and difficult to use. It was an attempt to make piracy imposible,
	and had several features of the late AI transponder. Over they
	centuries any TL in computers showed up an other leak of breaking
	into transponder messages, and the protocol was patched so often
	that in 900, several computer scientist claimed that obscurity of
	the code is the only security the transponder could claim.

	Because of well known problems, hailing got even more important.

- -200-400: Third Empire
	The first sylean transponder based on TL:12 crytography is installed
	on any sylean vessel. It does only sends own signature stamp,
	tonnage, armament, date of construction and ship ID. Legal codes
	(like owner and last bank payments) are not stored in the
	transponder, but distributed by the x-boat network predecessor.

	Hailing was for great importance to ensure that the vessel is not
	stolen.

	This reminds me of an advice Immelman gave to pilots: "When you
	received minor hits, and your plane will be trottleing at 500ft,
	and you are over friendly lines, take a parachute to avoid friendly
	fire."

	Muddily infantry is unable to deceide who\'s friend or foo, and
	shoots at everything, even the big signs on the wings did\'nt
	helped much. A non spoken consense between german and french
	pilots on dive hunts, was to break dive at 750ft to avoid being
	caught by friendly fire, and to climb to take a second attempt.

	This all was WWI of course.

Yeah, but we actually use photos of the aircraft.  US and newer Russian
birds look a lot alike.  So do Blackhawks and Hind D\'s.  But not that
much alike.  Personal opinion:those guys(the fighter jocks) should have
been shot.  If I had done that I couldn\'t live with myself, and would
welcome death.  But I\'m just a bomber puke(read target.)

One of my older friends was a Mustang driver in the Pacific during the
Deuce.  The US invented IFF during WWII, something I didn\'t know about.
Realistically we had better find a near fullproof way to ID in combat
because it is just getting worse.

Yeah....nothing like killin your buds. 

Sometimes I wonder if people really understand the ramifications of
these things, even though I was there and know how fast it all was
moving.

Unfortunatly sorrow isn\'t enough to bring them back.  They can join the

were in having an alternate Traveller setting in which jumps were instant,
but were only capable to between *very* deep space points. These were
quickly pointed out to me in a very thoughtful and conscise manner, as were
suggestions of a workaround.  (Unfortuantely, a "Mote in God\'s Eye" type
jump point has it\'s own problems for me -- specifically I don\'t like
"special places" in spacetime).

However, this thread has me thinking again. Say I want to do a setting in
which a jump drive was simply a hyperdrive (kinda like the subspace drive in
FF&S), where the jump number actually denotes speed? What you would have is
a jump-1 ship traveling 1 parsec in 1 week, and a jump-6 ship traveling one
parsec in 1/6th a week. Everything else is the same -- fuel usage (no matter
the reason), the size threshold for jump-capable vessels, the fact that once
a ship jumps it cannot change course, nor can it communicate with normal
space, and so on. How would *this* affect the setting? Off the top of my
head, I don\'t see this as changing something like long-distance
communications (where long-distance means sectors across). Certainly it will
change details, but would it make it so that the Imperium as a whole
wouldn\'t develop (as the instant jump idea seemed to do)? How would it
affect regional wars? How would it affect commerce? What about the price of
Pan-Galactic Gargleblasters on Regina?

Speculations and pontifications are asked, my good fellows.

	Without weaponry and fighters for only : 110MCr/Tl:12

	Transponder designation should of course change to VE-12-540.

My only longic was this - each weapon has its own LIDAR system. Eleven
weapons, 11 LIDARs.

If this is inappropriate, I can certainly lower the number.

Also, a mistake - the two sip boats are carried in docking rings, not
grapples - I ran out of area for grapples (Advanced Masking and level 2
stealth will do that to you).

And a question - how are the active decoys used? Are they shot off once
and then gone...or do they stick around until recovered or destroyed?
They seem awfuly huge and expensive for one-shot deals (I oringally had
one on the ship, but it took up too much space).

And any suggestions on my capital-ship killer missile - it has four
warheads and a chaff dispenser/ECM suite...what kind of penalties would
that give to a CIWS?

  Maybe someone could spot the "logic" error in my thinking (assuming
there is one)...

Place the master IFF "key" in the main vault of the warship on a computer.
This computer requires that the security officer enter in a password some
time within a set time interval (let us say every 48 hours because Jumps
take 168 hours to effect).  This Key, contains all the information for
IFF\'s for a time period of say, maybe 4 months.  Each "key" can be
sycronized manually by security officers for those ships that have to
operate away from information services such as SDB\'s cut off during an
invasion by an enemy, yet still able to work with each other as a
squadron.
  In the mean time, each "new" key issued (three times a year) is
delivered via Xboat or fleet dispatch boats so that they can keep a
reasonable IFF system functioning.  Since it is highly unlikely that ships
from one theater of operations will be sent to distant operation theaters
(say Solimani sphere patrol sent to Spinward Marches), not all ships will
need to be maintained in the IFF database, only those within the theater
plus those expected to move from location to location.  In essence, only
the IFF codes of ships that have Jump ability.

  What have I missed?  The enemy can\'t access the IFF once they get a
functioning box because it requires a security password to be entered
every 48 hours.  The ships get updates as reasonably quickly as possible.
Only those ships as likely to meet with other ships will be in the
database, or have access to the keys.

  About the only "weak" point I can see, is that the Xboats themselves
could be captured, and someone attempt to jimmy the computers there, or
perhaps a spy getting his/her/it\'s appendages upon the codes while at the
naval base.  Oh, almost forgot, the security officer must wear at all
times, a Psionic Shield.

  Comments?  Improvements to the scheme?

Is there ANY way to enhance this?  Maybe induce a small black hole by
detonating a large nuclear warhead inside a partially formed jump field?

 I posted some thoughts on this 10 days ago but no-one responded!  I\'ll 
repeat my views here:  
 
I know what FFS2 and MT\'s Starship operation manual say, but it does 
not seem to be entirely consistent to me.
 
Do people have any strong views about how we might visualise the grids:
 
1) the jump grid is lots of narrow (1 mm dia) wires over the surface of 
the ship.  For this case, do these wires go "over" or "under" such 
fixtures as turrets, bays, sensor antennae, spinal mount openings, 
HEPLAR exhaust ports.  is there a maximum separation for the wires? 
Does this separation reduce with jump number?  If the wires go over 
other features, why bother to assign a surface area to them in FFS2?
 
2) the jump grid is mostly contained in a few area (say, near the fore 
and aft of the vessel, plus near the tips of wings, tailplanes) with 
half-a-dozen grid lines joining the key nodes.
 
Following the SOM, I used to handwave things as (1), saying that 
turrets had to be in the correct position for jump (so their grids 
matched the rest of the ship), antennae had to be retracted and thin 
doors closed over spinal mounts, M-drive ports and so on.  I always 
liked the idea of last-minute EVA to unjam the turret, or to re-lay a 
section of damaged grid with a lanthanum welding rod as the ship flees 
combat.
 
Now that FFS2 assigns a specifc surface area to the grids, and this 
reduces the area available for turrets, airlocks and so on, I decided I 
needed a new handwave.  One option is to keep my original hand wave and 
add in the "node areas" of (2) and claim that these are what FFS2 is 
refering to.
 
What does the team think?

I also think the FFS2 XL spreadsheet is a wonderful tool.  At the end 
of this message are a handy pair of macros that will save
and load designs as simple text files (size approx 2.7k per file).  The
macros work by writing to (or reading from)  file the value in each
unlocked cell on the sheets Design, Las1,..., Mes2.  just copy the 
macros from this message and paste them into the Module of FFSXL (you 
may need to uprotect the sheet first).

I have used the standard "GetSaveAsFilename" and "GetOpenFilename"
calls for dialog boxes as these should allow long file names on Win95
and WinNT.  On my system it is very quick (1 or 2 seconds) to save or
load a design.  The savings of disk space should be worthwile for just
about everyone ... and think of the benefit of being able to post a
series of designs (2.7k each) on a web page so that others can use them
without laboriously entering the data from the USP.

If there is interest (from TMLers), I can easily produce a
listbox-style interface (in a separate XL file if required) that will
let someone browse their list of saved designs, load only certain
sheets (e.g. Laser or Missile sheets) and similar features.  I can add
"designers comments" at the bottom of the saved file (these could be
loaded into FFS2XL, or could be loaded into the summary workbook with
the list of designs - whatever you prefer).

Damn! Engage the Jumpdrive now. I don\'t care if we\'re only just over 10
diameters - Let\'s go for a controlled misjump back home to the base 36
parsecs away out of the 2D jump plane using a bucket of hydrogen, a dynamo,
and a swiss army knife.

But the Internationale is not ?  Some of the other, less right thinking
(but more right wing thinking) sophonts on this list are already working
on The Imperial Anthem.  If these reactionary counterrevolutionary
Imperialist running dogs & their lackies are going to have a cool theme
song don\'t the brave (and heavily armed) sophonts of the Sayat Concourse
need a theme song as well ?

So would this we a sort of "whip me, beat me, read me Communist

So you are saying is that Traveller helps you be a more creative perv
but you were already enough of one to that you might have been able to
think this up on your own ?  Good for you. 

> Proust is _still_ waiting to be retranslated into his original Vilani.

I am almost afraid to ask this question but would I be correct in
assuming that in the original Vilani text M Swann did not consume
cookies called Madelines but rather consumed someone called Madeline ?

If so I hope it was not that nice young lady from the childrens books
who "in a old house in Paris that was covered in vines lived twelve
young girls in two straight lines.  The youngest one was Madeline."

Of course twelve young ladies who did everthing in common could very
easily be a Sayat junior infiltration team.  No doubt their leader the
erstwhile Miss Clavel was only pretending to be a nun.  Naturally any
details of this groups particulars & intentions you can provide would be
appreciated.

So was M Swann a Vilani living in Vilani society or was he a Vilani
observer living in France ?  The textural evidence in Rememberance does
suggest French society, as does that of the Madeline books whose
protagonist he apparently slaughtered and consumed In Cold Blood (but
presumably with a nice sauce), perhaps M Swann was from a shugili family
?

I have this sudden picture of France in the late Ninteenth and early
Twentieth conturies as being the hotbed of a covert war between the
Vilani and the Sayat.

No doubt the Concourse will one day/is/has already invented time travel
and travelled back in time to alter history for their benefit.  For some
odd reason both they and the Vilani have an unusual influence in France
[Note that the Coneheads also claimed to be from France, maybe France is
a hotbed of Alien activity.]  I would assume the Sayat were behind the
French Revolution, the Paris Commune, etc. and that The Phantom of the
Opera was a Slimy agent ?

Swann had some tendancies that would make him more likely to be Darmine
than Vilani however.  Somehow I don\'t think that the conformist Vilani
are too big on, the love that dares not speak its name, shall we say.

Of course the Vilani might not mind as long as you don\'t do it in public
and frighten the horses....

Maybe this is why Norris is [IMNSHO} a closet case.  Possibly the Vilani
influenced Imperial culture is one like that of Victorian England, where
nice people did not talk about this sort of thing, they merely indulged
in it ?

You are confusing me here is it the Klingons faces, their wankers, or
both, that are warty ?

The problem with playing military with "few options" is a direct result
of poor knowledge of what it is like to be in a military.  Players need
to want to be a captain of a starship or a Marine Force Commander. To do
it right they need to study and learn, as command skills do not come
easily.

There actually is a lot to do in miliitry adventuring, and some major
issues can be explored through Traveller military actions that are not
able to be done by the small fry.

These include addressing the basic ideological structures in Trav, such
as nobless oblige and the concepts of duty and honor to the structure of
the Imperium itself.

From my point of view, mil roleplaying involves immense detailing of the
traditions and customs of Imperial Forces, detatiled characterizations
of hundreds of NPC\'s, and an overall idea of how militray chain of
coammand should work.

For instance, although the PC\'s, playing crew on a ship, may be given
orders detailing a mission from the Admiralty, this doesn\'t prevent
players from playing most types of characters.  Even trashballs can
reside in the Imperial Forces, and generally make the universe a more
interesting place to live in.  (Even if they do not get promoted.)

[snipage]

If you want to use our Earth as a basis for the use of Religon in the
military I think overall there is much to look at.  The divisions among
the people in Bosnia started based on religous differences.  The
conflicts in Ireland.  Muslim terroists in the Middle East.  In the U.S.
we don\'t go to war with guns over religon but there certainly are come
heated debates over differences that spill over into the political arena;
abortion, homosexual issues, death penalty, education, etc.

In the military like any large group you will have the few devout, the
few atheists, and then the majority of uninformed/unsure/confused.

In the Traveller universe I compare the Imperium somewhat to the Roman
Empire.  Therefore depending on the beliefs of the leadership, there
could be religous groups that are persecuted, there could be wars over
religous reasons, there could be an established Imperial religon and the
outlawing of anyone who didn\'t subscribe to it.  Many interesting
scenarios for players who enjoy that type atmosphere.

Outside of the Imperium some alien races could be very devout/fanatical
about there religous beliefs and use it as a reason to do any number of
things like take over other planets etc.  More interesting scenarios. 
Remember Middle East terrorists who for their beliefs would drive a bus
filled with explosives into a building?

My conclusion is that the inclusion of religon in the military would add
flavor and many interesting scenarios to the game.

Why?  They were following orders.  They used the best intelligence they had
at their disposal.  If you are ever faced with that situation, I hope you
will remember that you are not their because YOU want to be.  You are only
an instrument of your government.  Don\'t they still call you guys GI\'s?  I
don\'t need to remind you that means Government Issue.  In war or in
excercise, you are not your own.  You belong to the government.

I would hope that they [the aviators] would be like the only survivor of the
Hiroshama and Nagasaki runs, who sometime back said, "I feel bad about all
the people who died, but we were at war."  And continued with someting like,
"I take some consolation from the millions who didn\'t have to die in the
prolonged battle that would have been required to subdue the Japanese
otherwise."

In times of war there will be colateral damage.  It happens, you try to
avoid it as much as possible, but it happens.  If you can\'t live with the
consequenses of your actions, then like the rest of the two crews, you
either go crazy or kill yourself.  If you remember that the government
orders your actions, then living with the consequenses of those orders will
be easier.

And, lay off the aviators, they were just doing their jobs.

Actually, if you compare fratricides per aircraft involved, you will find
its getting better not worse.  There are just more birds in the air and
better coverage of what goes on over there.  The raw numbers keep going up,
just as the number of planes keep going up, but the scaled numbers show that
it\'s safer (at least from friendly fire) today than it ever has been.

Freedom isn\'t free!  It\'s paid for with the blood of patriots!*  Men (and
women) have been paying that price since time immemorial.  Yes, some of them
were accidentally killed by their own, but you make their sacrifice less by
the way you talk about it.

We have records of friendly kills dating back BC (BCE).  But they gave their
lives for the good of all who sent them.  I couldn\'t stand the way the
returnees after \'Nam were treated, and I can\'t stand the way this subject is
being treated.  For everyone who\'s not happy with my responses to what is

anything.

Not really nanotech those IBM letters right? It\'s akin to saying "We can
build Babbages Difference engine because we can make iron".

Drexlers major critisizers are commonly chemists, physical chemsists and
his proponents are generally engineers, computer scientists and dopeheads.
The problem lies within Drexlers picture of atoms as things that you can
pick up and place somewhere. I have a small discussion about these things
with comments from both sides in my Pilot and if anybody want it I can
probably convert it back to ascii and send it by private e-mail.

I\'ve bought Drexlers second book on the subject (not Engines of creation)
which is supposed to deal with thermal stability, quantum uncertainty,
cooling, diffusion etc but as far as I can tell he picks and chooses from
the natural laws as he pleases. Each problem is dealt with in isolation
from the other ones but a generally interesting read despite this as some
of the things in it actually seem to work.

From the perspective of a Marine...

Deadeye I believe is correct.  There is a lot that can be done if you 
are playing within the military, and not just in a time of war.  Besides 
all the interesting things that could be done with some interservice 
rivalry (we have it here and some of us are no longer even IN the 
military!) while on liberty, shore leave, etc. the real benefits come 
from detatched duty type operations.

Deadeye flies B-52s RT.  It\'s hard to go adventuring with a B-52.  I was 
part of a Battalion Landing Team (a MEU) that was in the Med during the 
time that the TWA aircraft was highjacked.  We followed the aircraft 
around the Med as it moved from country to country, finally heading to 
Beiruit.  We dusted off the plans for a landing and taking up of 
positions at the Airport again, just like the same MEU had done 2 years 
before.  That kind of mission would be great if you were the commmand 
staff of the MEU or the Naval force to which attached.

Or better, Granada.  The MEU was on a mission to Beiruit, but ended up 
doing a couple of landings "on the way".  No extra stuff, just because 
they were there (or could be there easily).

Or even better, the Barbary Pirates and Lt Presley O\'Bannon.  A ship on 
independent duty landed its contingent of Marines to bring the priracy 
(shudder--don\'t even think of starting that thread again) problem under 
control.  In the absence of orders from the rear, he took the matter 
into his own hands and prosecuted a campaign to successful conclusion.

An Imperial Naval task force has all kinds of missions, and the 
commander has all kinds of power, much like the USN today.  A party of 
Special Forces could be given under cover missions, along the lines of 
"A Clear and Present Danger".  And you would have some really heavy duty 
fire power you could call in if you needed it!  I recall "The Boys in 
Company C" when they wanted to let of some steam called in an air strike 
of napalm onto a hill, just for the hell of it.

I think the military allows for all kinds of missions and adventures, to 
include being busted, promoted, cashiered out, retired.....  And then 
you can start your Traveller career!

That\'s correct.

Our email system has been thoroughly fornicated, and the silly buggers
were running without a backup so I\'ve lost everything I had stored online
(not just email, but files, software, etc.).  I\'m still not receiving
TravLang - and haven\'t been able to get HIWG and TravTech since we
switched from Mac to Windows in November!

I\'m in the process of getting my own email account through Bell Canada
(who has an impressive service record).  I\'m just trying to negotiate some
form of cost recovery, as I\'ll be using it mostly for work stuff anyway. 
(You chaps have, by the way, been showing up in many lessons on the

They probably didn\'t know about maximum misjump ranges when they built the
first exploratory ships so I\'d say 36 pc is a tad overkill.

Then of course this could come from the "fact" that it was a UN science
project where armament and military force are prohibited. The US delegates
threatened to withdraw their funding unless the ship was armed and the
Japanese would withdraw theirs if it was. An agreement was finally reached
when the Pakistani chairman of the UN science program defined the pulse
laser as a "communications device" whereupon the US agreed and after some
diplomatic screaming and yelling the japs did too.

The Shriekers aren\'t crustaceans, though.  Well described, nicely done,
but not crustaceans.

You\'d change the Chamax critters, with the nasty \'plague\' animals being
another species.  

It\'s a doable idea.  I\'m not certain why you\'d want to make the change,
but suspect it is part of a long-term plot-line you\'re developing.  Care

What the hell has this to do with traveller?
Please take this patriotism thing to private e-mail (and exclude me), or
better yet, discuss why people in general in 3I join the military/navy or
refrain from doing so. Citizenships, babes, adventure, see tha galaxy for
free etc? It would also be interesting to discuss all those resistance
groups that will pop up to fight the 3I. They\'d probably be all idealistic,
freedom loving adrenalin junkies who when treated with the might of the 3Is
warmachine would soon start on the terrrorist trail.

What is the history of the Ine Givar (they have backing from Zhodani but
resistance gruoups tend to spring up from some just causes. What terribel
unjustice from the 3I started the Ine Givar? Where they present during the
M0?

I have to confess, I did not yet use very much of it by now, as I am not

Thousands, easily.  Up to millions if you count civilian deaths, although
how much of that was \'accidental\' and how much was deliberate is a matter
for debate, and the numbers change if you include/exclude "bystanders".

Now, here\'s a question. The above chart looks, IIRC, just like the one in the MT rules.In those rules, it\'s not clear exactly how
much cargo you find.

If freight is defined as goods you haul for a price (Cr1000/ton per jump), and cargo is defined as something you buy and hope to sell
later at a profit, where in the above table is the roll for cargo? I realized that the table uses the \'CARGO\' header, but it\'s really
talking about freight, no?

I\'ve adopted a house rule that says that the Major column is used for both cargo and major freight. What are your thoughts?

This fits to a problem of mine. Perhaps someone could advise me.
I am planning an adventure setting in which my characters (a very mixed 
group) get involved into a maneuver game (kind of high-tech Gotcha!) While
the military players go into the field, the others could stay in the
central and observe the game - and some other things.

Goal for the players is not to win the game, but to stay in it and protect
one of the combatants from being assassinated! (This is a kind of
\'Dreampark\' setting, I see at this moment ...)

Now my problem is: I have never been to any military service, so I don\'t
have any experience with this (unlike some of my players). That\'s why my
campaign gets more civilian in apperance. But I want the players to get
their fights here and then, and this could be a way to test the whole
combat system without a big risk.

Can someone give me a hint or two what I have to look at when conducting a
maneuver and what is not so important?

Yes you\'re right there. When I read MT i think about DGP stuff which IMHO
was the golden years of Traveller but the actual setting could only be of
interest to High Guard TCS people. I use the MT setting (currently at 1120)
as a backdrop for my mostly civilian Spinward marches campaign.

TNE could have been a good start where it not for the VIRUS and the general
focus on small ninja teams with wetsuitlike clothings whose mission was to
kill some TED (kind of like the CIA secret war in central america) and the
portrayal of traders as a generic group of villains (most civilian
Traveller campaigns previously dealt with Traders in CT & MT). I couldn\'t
figure out was players was supposed to do beside playing "SEALS in space".

The rules were the best ever though.

Except that the Shriekers had, on _their_ home planet, a big old global
empire dating back something like a hundred thousand years, with
archeological remains waiting to be found by the intrepid adventurers, etc.
They\'ve been there a _long_ time.

Unless you rewrite the Shrieker background as it was published, the
timeline for this really doesn\'t work.  Of course, you could turn it
around: the Shriekers long, long, _long_ ago actually had spaceflight and
settled the Chamax system.  Maybe the Y-man noticed and smote \'em back into
the stone age?

In light of this discussion, I just received this (from my work) and 
thought it appropriate to include....  I think Senator John Glenn\'s 
words sum up how we all feel on this list, regardless of which country 
we may call home....


Subject:	FW: The Soldier


HOOAH!

FYI to all. 

Powerful interchange between now Sen Glenn and the guy
he beat back in 74.  Would like to have been a fly on the wall
during this exchange.  Pretty impressive impromptu speech!  He\'s OK to 
fly into space one last time as far as I\'m concerned. 

- ---- 

May 3,1974 Ohio Senate Democratic primary. Howard Metzenbaum to
John Glenn:  "How can you run for Senate when you\'ve never held a 
\'job\'?"

Glenn:  "I served 23 years in the United States Marine Corps. I was 
through two wars. I flew 149 missions. My plane was hit by
anti-aircraft fire on 12 different occasions. 

"I was in the space program. It wasn\'t my checkbook, it was my life
that was on the line. This was not a 9 to 5 job where I took time
off to take the daily cash receipts to the bank. I ask you to go with
me... as I went the other day to a Veterans Hospital and look those men 
with their mangled bodies in the eye and tell them they didn\'t hold a 
job. You go with me to any Gold Star mother, and you look her in the eye 
and tell her that her son did not hold a job.

"You go with me to the space program, and you go as I have gone
to the widows and the orphans of Ed White and Gus Grissom and Roger 
Chaffee, and you look those kids in the eye and tell them that their
dad didn\'t hold a job.

"You go with me on Memorial Day coming up, and you stand on
Arlington National Cemetery- where I have more friends than I like
to remember- and you watch those waving flags, and you stand there,
and you think about this nation, and you tell me that those people 
didn\'t have a job 

"I tell you, Howard Metzenbaum, you should be on your knees every
day of your life thanking God that there were some men- SOME MEN-who
held a job. And they required a dedication to purpose and a love of 
country and a dedication to duty that was more important than life
itself.  And their self-sacrifice is what has made this
country possible... I HAVE HELD A JOB, HOWARD!"

Semper Fidelis to all.

I do agree, the way the guys who came back from Vietnam were treated was
atrocious.  My father is a Vietnam vet and he had more problems with the way
his own government treated him, and the thousands of others, who live with the
complications caused by Agent Orange.

Just wanted to put this into perspective.

Dom, you shouldn\'t take every piece of bait, and you don\'t.  ;-)  You waited
for something this juicy and ripe for the Incinerator(tm) man-portable
flamer unit.  Funny, we were just discussing this very topic in during the
hour-long carpool/commute this morning...

Isn\'t it amazing what other people will "believe?"  What were Clinton\'s
approval ratings this morning?  Sheesh kabobs.  *snicker*

CT was great, when I was 12.  MegaTraveller/Rebellion Era was outstanding
(still the best art around even if the rules blew orphaned llama).  TNE was
*sigh*.  TNE did have some of the most moving quotes, though ("To absent
friends" will always cause my eyes to leak - apologies to Mork).  T4 is
pretty good, considering, and we play it -- just because.  But overall
HARDTIMES was the most fun, most morally challenging, and the best
Travelling we ever did (with CT rules).

I don\'t recognize your terms (Traveller wise).  If they were used in any
thing but CT & T4 then I missed them.  In those 2 cargo is what you call
freight.  You ship it for someone else at a profit.  Speculative Cargo is
what you call cargo.  It\'s something you buy and ship with the hopes of
making a profit.

>I\'ve adopted a house rule that says that the Major column is used for both
cargo and major freight. What are your thoughts?

We always just allowed the captain to buy all he wants.  I\'ve been to
manufacturers and they usually don\'t have any kind of limit to how much you
can buy.  No a limit that would mean anything to a free trader captain
anyway.

Well, there are certain orders that you shouldn\'t follow, both morally and
legally (at least since Nurenburg).  

Plenty of real-world examples to choose from, so I\'m not going to list
them. besides, this could get really contentious. Anyone desperately
wanting to discuss this is invited to email me privately.

Also read some of Bujold\'s Vorkosigan novels for interesting moral
dilemnas (and a good read too).  

OvTrav: Look at the all those Black War operations in MegaTraveller. Put
your players in one of those, and leave them the moral choice.  Or what
about some of the Imperium\'s practices (from Milieu 0)?

Are there rules for turning on a jump field inside a running jump field that state how much damage is caused? I\'m basing my idea on jump space research from CT or MT (can\'t remember which) that mentioned an experiment where they launched a jump-capable ship from a carrier that was in jump space (never saw it again) and another experiment where they built a ship with two jump drives - the second one activated while in jump space (very dangerous misjump).

The idea behind this "Jump Bomb" isn\'t to cause explosion damage, but to cause a catastrophic misjump - that\'s why you time to it go off after the huge bulk cargo carrier has entered jump space. Can your jump drive compensate in time if a small and highly unstable jump field forms inside your big and stable jump field...

Probably in that they are feelings brought about by a response that someone
had posted having to do with IFF systems in Traveller.  I\'m not going to speak
for Cybernot here, but, that seems to be the way that the thread had run.  I\'m
sure someone will correct me if I\'m wrong.

I personally think that people have their fingers on the "off topic" button
way too quickly on this list.  I can understand it to an extent, but I\'ve only
seen one time when the complaints were somewhat warranted (during the dark and
dismal period when Starship Troopers was released and everybody needed to have
their say).  It manifests itself in other ways too (when some people got tired
of the economics/piracy thread, which had very much to do with Traveller, a
number of people attacked it and tried to snub it, because although it was
Traveller, nobody cared).

Its not like this list is constantly off topic and needs to be herded back all
of the time.  The people here are here because they like Traveller, and they
like to discuss Traveller.  Since Traveller (like any RPG) can deal with
topics that are like those in the real world, then discussion about things in
the real world will sometimes seep in.  That\'s the way that discussions go
sometimes.

I didn\'t see you immediately leap to ask about how a question about NASA\'s
launch schedule was off topic, nor how the discussion on nanotech and sci-fi
books related to it were off topic.  Although both (and the message that
sparked your response) were off topic, they\'re not entirely off-topic because
it just so happens that many people who like Traveller like alot of the same
things, or have had similar experiences.  

Sorry if this message seems to be an over reaction, but its just one of those
things that really makes my blood boil.

Now, back on the topic of the game Traveller:

>Citizenships, babes, adventure, see tha galaxy for
>free etc? It would also be interesting to discuss all those resistance
>groups that will pop up to fight the 3I. They\'d probably be all idealistic,
>freedom loving adrenalin junkies who when treated with the might of the 3Is
>warmachine would soon start on the terrrorist trail.

I recently seriously considered joining the United States Army.  My own
reasons were at first not babes or adventure but, money, money for college,
and experience in the electronics field.  When I began to seriously think
about it, patriotism and the willingness to die for my country entered the
picture and it became the overwhelming reason to join or not join.  I didn\'t
end up joining for several reasons that I\'m not going to discuss because they
are so vastly off topic that I wouldn\'t be able to rectify them in any way
with Traveller.

The way I play my Third Imperium, I think that adventure would be a strong
reason for joining the military.  In the subsector I run my game in there are
billions of people who will never, ever set foot off of their own planets.  I
think that there\'d be a good number of "Luke Skywalkers" out there who are
just dying to be more than they could be on the surfaces of their homeworlds.
My Imperium is also played a little more cynically then the classic Traveller
canon universe, so I think that money is another reason, as are the
opportunities for schooling and hands-on experience are also strong
motivators.  Personally, I would consider joining the Impies if it meant I
could have my hands on the absolute highest technology on a daily basis.

I think that resistance groups would be more then freedom loving adrenaline
freaks in many cases.  Again, I play my Imperium a little more cynically, so
resistance groups would in many cases be either idealists, but there\'d be a
fair number who are realists.  Some of it has to do with the ways that people
play the government type "Feudal Technocracy".  Personally, I play it that
this government type is ruled directly by the Imperium\'s Feudal system.  Not
sure if this is "canon" or not, but it works for me.  Some of these planets
could have been thousands of years old, and had other governments that the
people liked better.  As an example, imagine if the Imperium stopped by earth
today and said, "we have bigger guns, more powerful electronics, and really
big PAWs on our ships, and we\'re going to drop off a noble and some \'security
forces\' because we feel your world would be better ruled by us.  Thanks for
your compliance."

There\'d be plenty of reasons to resist the Imperium, and to resist their
bedpartners, the MegaCorporations, in addition to the tons and tons of
"efficient" dictatorships and religiously backed governments that restrict the
freedoms of their populaces on individual worlds...

Actually, I think you have, both he and I active duty military (we are bothers).
He\'s a USAF pilot, I\'m a USN Line Officer and we are both very patriotic by
most standards.  We are just very exposed to why things happen in today\'s world
and reserve the right to be cynical about the things we are willing to die for.
But we are still willing to die for them.  Free trade is part of freedom, even
if I don\'t like the idea that Bill gates or somebody else who couldn\'t give
a rat\'s butt about me benefits from my death in combat or peacetime.

Well, Anders, you have a very good question there.  If you model your
Traveller campaign on real life, then perhaps you now have an excellent idea
for an NPC.  He doesn\'t brook any nonsense from those who would belittle the
fighting men and women of the Imperium (even accidentally).  He would rather
apologize for misconstruing the meaning of a fellow patriot, who will
understand his zeal than let a slight go unchallenged.  Even though he is
not (or is, your choice) fit for duty, he would rather risk his life and
honor than see his beloved Imperium besmirched by the small minded people he
is surrounded by.

Of course if you don\'t base your campaign on reality, then I guess it
doesn\'t have anything to do with Traveller.

Ok, this one has WWWAAAAYYY to much flame potential in it.  I am quite sure
that the pilots involved have had thier lives thoroughly trashed because of
it, and have to live w/ the responsibility of thier actions forever.  And I
don\'t EVEN want to get into how they wouldn\'t have been there at all if we had

  It was an unfortunate accident (which happens in all walks of life) and

Common Era, it\'s used by those who don\'t want to acknowledge Christ with the

are afraid to offend those who don\'t want to.  B.C.E. is Before the Common

FYI, medieval is a term used for the dark ages by those who don\'t want
people to think they were so bad.  We have all kinds of terms like this.

I thought it was original.  In fact it was original.  I\'ve never read

There were scenarios between the lines for those GMs willing to put a little
work into the game.  When the characters were rolled up for my TNE campaign a
few years back, I tried to build the adventure around them.  One of the PCs
had chosen the "Rebel" archetype, and was unable to attend to first actual
gameplaying session.

The adventure I had built had him at the center, and was written without him
being able to play (I am very proud of it now).  One of the secondary worlds
in a nearby system had been an hunting-preserve run by a corporation, it had
many of the most dangerous creatures and animals from throughout the Imperium.
The Imperium had gotten a small parcel of land an set up a prison on this
planet before the collapse.  The dangerous beasties had served to discourage
any escape attempts.  After the collapse, the prison used prisoners as slave
labor to mine high-priced radioactives from the mountains of the world, while
bartering with traders.  The traders would bring \'slaves\' to the planet, and
use them to barter for the radioactives.

The rebel character had been...  ahem...  funded by the Aubani and was part of
a "secret war" against Oriflamme.  He was captured after a bomb he planted had
killed a number of Oriflammen marines.  Since the political situation was so
tight, he was to be shipped back to Oriflamme as "cargo" on an apparently
normal trader, while the ship that supposedly held him went on ahead a few
days before.

Pirates hit the ship, and took the crew and him as prisoners, and eventually
bartered him for radioactives.  The team had to hit the prison and free him,
as Oriflamme wanted him to be put on trial and killed, and the Aubani wanted
him back since he was useful to their cause, they were loyal to him, and were
afraid he\'d spill the beans if they took no action to free him...

But there was alot of political maneuvering to deal with (for a good GM) with
a group of worlds pulling in different directions for different reasons.
Although this was a "seal team" mission, there was enough underneath it all
that could be fun to deal with.  Their second mission considered finding the
location of the targetting bases for the deep meson gun on another planet and
was entirely undercover.  More of a James Bond type of thing rather than a
"seal team" type thing.  They eventually failed and were tortured for
information in a very nasty prison.  They were saved later, and eventually, by
the time the campaign ended, had discovered a jump-gate left by an ancient and
enigmatic race and gone through it.

There was more to the system then just seal team missions, but the game
mechanics were so geared towards a military setting that it was tough to
figure out what else the players could do.  I never got the impression you
did, however, that all of the traders were stereotyped as bad guys.  There
were guilded traders, and free traders, and then the traders in between.  In
fact, one of the players in the group had wanted to settle down into the life
of a trader after his service with the scouts was finished.

The above interpretation is how I\'ve always played it in the past, but I
think that this raises an issue concerning battle damage and it\'s effect on
the grid. If the grid covers the surface of the hull and all of its
fixtures, wouldn\'t ANY damage to the hull or ANY exterior fitting cause it
to fail? Or would the jump grid have enough "excess capacity" to be able to
sustain some damage and still function normally?

I\'m more inclined to embrace this interpretation, except this also raises a
possible issue: What about unstreamlined hulls or hulls with alot a exterior
fixtures? Would the jump field then have to extend farther out from the skin
of the hull so that all of the protrusions could be included, to a point
where it could be possible for something to be caught in a jumping ship\'s
"wake" and be dragged out of normal space? Or would the surface of a ship\'s
hull be "conductive" to the jump field generated at the nodes, so that the
outline of the field would conform to the shape of the hull just like an
electromagnetic field would?

I\'m curious to know what everyone thinks.

Another canon-buster there?  Who was it the worshipped the Darrian-spawned

Aren\'t all religions, within a 10,000-world Imperium, by definition,
minority religions?  How do you establish a majority religion covering that

Heh.  Having lots of friends in the "big four" US military services and
other quasi-military services (I consider local/state police, Border, DEA,
FBI, et al part of a similar mindset), I would disagree.  It\'s not a BS
detector: it\'s healthy skepticism of the motives of those giving them the
orders.  If Captain Woody sez, "Kill a commie for Jesus," the embittered
Army "dude" is unlikely to be moved.  If the local pastor at home says that
God loves those that volunteer, and you do...

My favorite jarhead just died of so-called "leukemia" after he came back
from Saudi last year, and I won\'t comment on how peoples beliefs change
under such circumstances, but you can imagine.  Agnostics are, until the
bullets start flying over your "fighting position."

We all respond to the symbols that we are conditioned to revere, and that we
condition ourselves to revere.  The most heroic acts in history were just
such symbolically motivated behavior.  Your symbols may not be the cross or
the crescent and scimitar, but instead the nebulous "freedom and justice for
all."  Honestly, I don\'t think that the pay or training is good enough for
someone to volunteer without having a strong religious belief in something,
be it red, white, and blue, or black and white, or green and gold.

During garrison duty.  Any statistics on post-combat behavior?  Veterans v.
FNGs?

It doesn\'t prove anything...  Some "religions" require nothing of their
unconscious adherents than simply living however they choose.  You\'re not a
scientologist are you?  ;-)

What made the Afghani Mujahideen more terrifying to the Soviets: their
training and equipment or the fact that had attended their own funerals and
believed that if they died fighting the would enter into Paradise?  BTW, in
case you\'re unfamiliar with the Afghani war, the natives didn\'t have
training or equipment.  What made the Crusades so much fun, for both sides?
What made the Fremen so terrifying to the Harkonnen?  What motivated the
privateers of Drake\'s "Reaches" saga?  For Piet Ricimer it was a belief in a
"divine mission" to reclaim the stars.  You would likely find more empathy
with Stephen Gregg in that trilogy, though.

The history of religion and warfare are inseparable, more so in the East and
Mid-East than in our "dispassionate" West (but that\'s only in the last
couple of decades).  The Revolution was fought for God and country, as were
the "Big Two," Korea, and for some, Vietnam, just to mention those important
to the US.

Oops, I\'ve rambled on so long that I forgot to mention jihad again...  Oh,
well, I\'ll leave that to another post on the merits of militant religions,
or religious militaries.  We might be getting a lesson or two on that if the

Hiya. CE means "Common Era". It\'s sort of a "politically correct" way to say
AD. Sometimes you\'ll also see BCE, which means "Before Common Era" and is

One of the easiest things for anyone who isn\'t facing a firing squad to
say. Legally, during wartime, in many armies, and certainly in the SS
during WWII, refusal to follow orders can result in the ranking officer
next to you calmly pulling out their sidearm and executing you on the
spot.

While \'I was just following orders\' may not be ordained  as a legal
defense against atrocities, the only alternative is effectively suicide.

Morally right and dead is still just plain dead.

Now, while sticking player characters into such situations might be, well,
interesting, from the GM\'s point of view, _always_ leave them some way
out.

   I have become convinced the word \'flank\' doesn\'t appear in the Marine
vocabulary.  This is not a problem when wading in from the ocean, since
there is no such thing as flank when taking a beachhead, however once inland
the same tactics seem to apply--overwhelm through superior firepower and
mass of bodies.   Rule of thumb: take the hill--send in the Marines; go
around the hill and leave the enemy to surrender later--send in the Army.

   ObTrav: Ditto.

My apologies for being off-topic here, but I want to clear this up in "public
air" for reasons that will be obvious to some.

I added my note after wards for a reason.  I\'m sorry if I\'m cynical enough to
believe that just doing one\'s job is not always a sufficient explanation to
those who have died, or who\'s families have been destroyed, or have suffered
any of the other horrors or indignities of war.  The North Vietnamese who set
traps that would maim rather than kill were just doing their jobs, those folks
at the chemical companies that made napalm and Agent Orange were just doing
their jobs, the soldiers that performed the atrocities at the concentration
camps were just doing their jobs, just as the soldier in the field is just
doing his or her job.  I am by no means naive enough to believe that every
soldier, every helicopter pilot, every fighter pilot, every logistics officer
and every other person involved in the machinery of warfare is an evil, vile,
snarling beast.  But, I am also by no means naive enough to believe that just
because someone was "doing one\'s job", that death, maiming, and emotional
scarring are all just made right and proper and everyone should be happy
again.  Perhaps having a father who has an increased risk of skin cancer, who
can\'t go out on a sunny day without a baseball cap and a ton of lotion without
getting nasty little tumors and splotches on his face has made me a little
cynical about these things.  Maybe it was the money he had to pay to diagnose
the problem, and the refusals by the government to even acknowledge that they
screwed up.  Maybe it is the thousands of others who were exposed to Angent
Orange and have the exact same problems now as a result.  Or maybe it was the
fact that the US government refused to pay reparations until a couple of years
ago, for those who suffered from chronic problems due to their exposure to
mustard gas that the US wanted to test on its own soldiers during WWI (only
one survivor from the test was still alive at the time).  Perhaps its also
those who suffer from chronic problems due to "gulf war illness" and the
governments lack of support for them...  Maybe these sort of things have made
me just a wee bit cynical about "doing one\'s job".

If I have misremembered or disrespected those who died in the Blackhawk
tragedy or their families in any way, I cannot apologize enough.  If it
appears that way to anybody, then I take this time to apologize and state that
it was not my intent to offend.  I know a number of the people on this list
are veterans of military service, some are veterans of peacetime service, and
some are veterans of wartime service.  If my comment insulted or disrespected
any of you, then I apologize for that now.  If my comment disrespected those
men who piloted the planes and acted correctly based on the information they
had, then I apologize.  If, in any way I insulted or disrespected those on the
design team for the IFF transponder that was in use, one of whom I know to be
a wartime veteran and who takes great pains in making sure that our soldiers
in the field are kept as safe as possible from both enemy attacks and
"friendly fire" and who goes to great lengths to make sure that every
technician in the field who contacts his office gets the help he needs as his
first priority, who was hurt very deeply when the device was used improperly
in the field and resulted in the deaths of the people involved, then I
apologize very deeply.

Finally, I apologize to those on the list for taking up this space with non-
Traveller related material, but I felt I had to clear the air before any hard
feelings came about from my comment.

Mayakovsky wasn\'t into S/M per se (or so we\'re TOLD), but did have
overactive gonads and run around falling violently in love with unavailable
women and then writing anguished Futurist poetry about it.  And bragging
about how butch and Red he was.  Diligent twisting of his words could
easily turn him into an emotionally disturbed 6\' tall Sayat.

You may be on to something here.  Looking at French and Sayat cuisine
certainly suggests the likelihood of cross-fertilization.  The "Phantom of
the Opera" was indeed a Slimy, investigating the proto-human phenomena of
"singing".  Quasimodo was a failed experiment in genetic "uplift".  So was
Marie Antoinette.  Laplace and his set were being telepathically
manipulated by Sayat math cultists, trying to lure them away from the
Templar fold.  It\'s ALL SO OBVIOUS!

Actually, I\'ve been thinking about Vilani-Sayat relations.  I have this
image of Vilani traders meeting intrepid Solomani adventurer-explorers in a
Starport Bar(tm) and warning them off the Sayat.  The Vilani would see them
as totalitarian drones, reflexively crushing any traces of individuality,
privacy, or personal freedom, imposing a homogenized culture and
narrowly-defined mindset upon everyone they meet... and they have
absolutely barbarous and animalistic cooking and dining habits.  Given the
conception of Vilani culture I gather most people on the list have,
comments like this coming _from_ Vilani ought to give the PCs pause for
thought...

Besides this, the Vilani wouldn\'t recognize Sayat modes of _planning_ and
_foresight_ and probably distrust the safety features/margins in Sayat
engineering.

Sounds about right to me.  It would also seem to suggest that the Imperium
proper doesn\'t recognize same-sex marriage; it certainly helps limit the
number of possible dynastic alliances within the Peerage.  Otherwise Norris
and Ishuggi would\'ve been married off years ago and the Vargr never would
have overrun Corridor.

Nah.  Leaving the players a way out makes it far less interesting.  Moral
dilemnas always have a way out built in, either you can do it, and suffer the
consequences of comprimising your own conscious, or you can not do it, and
suffer the possible consequence of death.

Granted, these things are always \'easier\' when you\'re dealing with role-
playing lives rather then real-lives...  My party (who work for Interstellarms
at the moment) were supposed to take out a scientist who was working on stuff
for Delgado.  She refused to join them, and they wanted her whacked (also,
there were other reasons they wanted her whacked, but my party doesn\'t know
this at the moment).  When they got there to kill her, they realized what they
were doing was wrong, and they refused to kill her, in fact, they told her
that Interstellarms wanted her dead and that she should seek as much
protection as possible almost immediately...

They are now in the dilemna of what to do.  If they go back, they could be
killed by Interstellarms, but they might be able to talk their way out of it.
If they don\'t go back, an Imperium wide megacorporation with mercenaries in
every corner of known space will want them dead...

Building a way out is, well, cheating, isn\'t it?  :^)

That focus just wasn\'t there.  I\'ve heard this alot, but there were many types
of RCES missions and there was plenty established to make a non RCES group.
Maybe others were limited by it, but not me.  That mold is as easily as broken
as the Merchants and Mercanaries mold of CT.  And CT does give me the

CT seems straight M&M in its approach.

	What the heck is going to happen to all of the other standards under this
new regime of \'politically correctness\'?  I mean, look at where it is
leading us:  We can\'t use BC/AD anymore, or certain ethnic notations,
pretty soon we will have to be calling our enemies \'divided friends\' or
something silly like that.  What will be next on the docket for the change
to \'correctness\'?  I nominate A.M. and P.M.!  I think that A.M. hurts my
feelings as a person who has to get up early and go to work while others
get to sleep in to the PM!
	I want AM and PM to be identified as something else!  (Anyone have any
ideas of what to change it to?  Or does someone else want to speak out
about the silliness of this whole thing? :P)  That\'s what this all boils
down too you know.  People getting their feelings hurt, or they think they
are getting a bad stereotype from the names or connotations.  So since my
feelings are hurt with the changes in BC/AD I want to return the favor by
ruining the lives of those people who have this stick up their rectum for
insisting on the change!

	So I decided to use a little bandwidth here to put my little pin prick in
the dam and see what develops...  Sorry if this message offends some of
you, but I am a little fed up with the \'Reaganomics\' of political
correctness.

2) Carrying refugees fleeing worlds about to be invaded

3) Jumping into systems after a major battle 

4) Exploring new speculative trade routes out on the far spinward fringes of 
the Domain since rest of the imperium was cut off.

5) Fleeing the reach of a hostile government or megacorp by heading for a

For us the Rebellion formed a wonderful background, but never came too

100,000 ton warship sounds pretty dull since your fate depends almost
wholely on the actions of NPCs.

Chamax Psychology

Chamax minds are shaped in these ways: 

1. Low population pressures (high mortality rates at the life crisis
   boundary) plus the ability to live with crowding means \'living space\' 
   is minimal, and \'expansion\' is a rare thing.

2. When moves or expansion occurs, it occurs on a grand scale: in ancient
   times, Chamaxi moved only when resources vanished, and expansion
   didn\'t happen -- the group would just split into two groups and
   part ways to support the nomadic existence.  After the development
   of agriculture and husbandry, group sizes grew larger and stayed
   together more often; however, when a group split they usually lost
   contact altogether.  Chamax was plenty big for them, and crowding
   wasn\'t likely for a loooong loooong time.

On Chamax

The various tribes spread out over the planet, keeping (at best)
only tenuous contacts with one or two other tribes.  Because of
their low birth rate, their planet was covered with tiny groups
of Chamaxi, isolated by almost impassible wilderness.  In some
groups (labeled Alpha Groups), couples would make a trek across the 
wilderness to another group to settle down in, as a rite of 
fertility (which helped keep the gene pool healthy too).  The treks
were often hundreds or thousands of kilometers distant.  Groups
which had these exchanges tended to be more inquisitive, and their 
cultures tended to flourish.  On the other hand, "Beta" groups had
few exchanges, and tended to be smaller, less vigorous cultures.
"Gamma" groups, with minimal cultural growth, were usually nomadic
and perhaps didn\'t completely vanish until the Chamaxi finally
spread technology across the globe.

Civilization developed after -200,000, as the pockets of Chamaxi 
advanced in parallel courses with minimal interaction.  By -170,000,
many groups had a complex, "literate" culture, with plenty of time 
for research and development.  Groups were distinctly "Alpha" or
"Beta" groups; the distinctions would blur some over the next 100,000
years.  By -160,000, most groups were at TL 2-3; however, at least one 
Alpha group leapfrogged ahead to TL 9.  Taking the extremely long-term 
view of expansion, they built a colony ship.  With that ship the entire 
group launched itself to a world 10 parsecs away.

Chamax continued at TL 2 & 3 for a long time, but by -50,000 most 
settlements were emphasizing The Pilgrimage, and cultures began
to awaken to each other.  As minds met, civilization advanced, and
technology followed along at a leisurely pace, reaching TL 5 when
the Darrians were first on the rise.  Brief trade with the Darrians
brought their technology up to TL 8, and TL 9 was achieved when 
Cleon formed his Imperium.  The planet Chamax died in the year 700.

Off Chamax

Meanwhile, a planet 10 parsecs away was colonised by Chamaxi around
- -150,000.  The ship and technology was in great disrepair (and was
tailor built for one-way travel anyhow), so its one landing was its
last.  Chamax ores disintegrated over time on this new world, so
the settlers returned to agriculture and animal husbandry, and lost
their technology.

Around -108,000, a sun-worshipping empire arose in the East which 
centralized agriculture and advanced medicine, construction, and 
irrigation.  Severe drought, famine, and plague ended it.

About -15,000 nomad bands began to settle the broad flood plains to 
the West of the Great Sea.  By -10,000 there was a cluster of
agricultural centers established, with widespread trading and a
central religious authority.  A civil government took shape 
sometime around -9000, and the religous leadership abdicated its
power to become a passive group in a mountain retreat.  By -6000
the civilisation encircled the planet.

In -6000 the trench in the center of the Great Sea opened, dropping
the coastal plate and destroying the second Shrieker empire, leaving
the mountain retreat as the only bastion of Shrieker culture.  It
has been growing slowly, only just beginning to reach out of its
mountain retreat.

So do you have to work at being this obnoxious or does it come naturally
to you?  I can ignore the jingoistic militarism you recently spouted, but
the above post *really* annoys me.  You are awfully damn dismissive of
anyone who does not agree with you.  Most of the planet "does not not want
to acknowledge Christ" ie they are not Christians, live with it. 

As for the "dark ages" comment, it is used because the idea of the dark
ages was invented by folks from later eras who wanted to make themselves
look good.  Actually, the "dark ages" was one of the eras of greatest
technical progress in the west.  They just didn\'t happen to put up lots of
neoclassic buildings.  No modern scholars use the term "dark ages" any
more, nor have they for most of this century.

That is the best description of TNE I\'ve seen, and the reason I loathed
it.  The whole make the backward worlds "safe for democracy & capitalism" 
while also looting their tech was amazingly morally repellent.  I had
about as much impetus to play in that setting as I would a game of the
heroic German SS in WWII, *yuck!*

I was sad to see Traveller become a game of US imperialism in space.

   About the same analysis that GDW came to as I recall, but ultimately they
reached a different conclusion.

   They instead concluded that the game needed to be brought down to a level
so that what the PCs did had *impact*, whether they are members of the
military, or freelancers working for the highest bidder.

   TNE was no more "just the RCES" than classic Traveller was "just the
Spinward Marches campaign" (all my scenarios have taken place in the
Solomani Rim).  Even if you restricted yourself to the Reformation Coalition
area, there were many things to do if your ref was of only modest creativity.

>I couldn\'t figure out was players was supposed to do beside playing "SEALS in 
>space".

   1) You are the owner of a 200 ton far trader, a ship that was your
father\'s and your grandfather\'s before him.  You make your living trading
with the RC and worlds who welcome off-worlders, dodging the Guild and the
occasional Vampire ship.

   2) You are a member of the RCES\'s Deep Space Exploration branch.  You
don\'t hit TEDs (fact is you might even be friendly with some of them as you
pass through their system deeper into space).  Your job is to make contact
with the Covenant of Sufren, or the rumored "HubWorlds".  Maybe you even get
sent off in an effort to find out whatever happen to the human homeworld
(Earth).  You have to be resourceful and make up the rules as you go along...

   3) You are a merchant prince, owner of a small merchant line that does
business within the RC and its area of operation.  Your "fleet" of three
merchant ships (two antiques, one of recent Aubani construction) isn\'t an
armada by any means, but you turn a nice profit.  Being an good entrepreneur
means that you get deal personally with everyone from high government
officials who want to "borrow" your ships "for a few weeks" to Guild
cutthroats who threaten to disrupt that new trade deal you just spent four
months negotiating.

   4) You are a freelance adventurer.  You go where you want, when you want,
taking contracts along the way to make money.  You take the tough, messy
assignments because that\'s where the money is, and you get offered the
tough, messy assignments because the RCES doesn\'t want any "entanglements"
and you are good at what you do...

   Note: this need not mean your character is Sly Stallone reprising his
role in the movie "Cobra"--this can also lead to adventures that are pure
mystery and intrigue, were only the bad guys carry firearms.

   5) You are a colonist on a "virgin" world.  Along the way you must settle
disputes among the other colonists, negotiate with (or fight) hostile
natives that the RC didn\'t know where still around, deal with other
off-worlders who may or may not come in peace, keep from strangling RC reps
who would rather get a good "photo op" with the colonists than actually
listen to their needs, and in general survive and claim the land for your own. 

   There you are, five campaigns that have nothing what-so-ever to do with
running around in a hi-tech wet suit, and that was just off the top of my head.

>The rules were the best ever though.

   Ditto.

How about someone with a jump drive misjumped to their world and had to
make contact.  Maybe even a ship that was damaged in combat and the pilot
escaped combat with jump but didn\'t survive the landing on their world.

They tried to repair the ship to glean the technology they couldn\'t
understand.  Their test pilots tried to use the jumpdrive and misjumped
bigtime!

Could Happen?

In defense of his statement, the amount of years, and the number of people who
use it have no bearing on whether it is "politically correct".  I don\'t like
the term "politically correct" out of respect for those who are trying to
reform the language (for example, negro was a completely acceptable way to
refer to blacks once upon a time, and cripple was an acceptable way to refer
to people with a number of disabilities).  I do think that people take this to
an extreme (people fighting against the terms \'obese\' and \'overweight\' because
they imply that they are, well, heavier then is average or healthy).

I have never personally come across the terms C.E. or B.C.E, so from my
perspective, it would seem that their use is not common yet.

Then why not reform the whole dating system in the first place?  It is a
system that was devised by Christians, with Christ as the central point.  The
niceties of changing the names to CE/BCE doesn\'t seem to change the fact that
the whole system was and still is based around the birth of Christ.  I mean,
you\'re still acknowledging something that you claim to not be acknowledging,
just changing the name to pretend that you\'re not, kind of like if you were to
stop using \'nigger\' to refer to black people, and using \'negro\' instead (where
the real point of contention is not only the word, but the need to point out
that the person that you are referring to has a different skin color then your
own in newspaper articles, movie reviews, etc.)

Responses to this should be sent to me via e-mail.

I beg to differ.  Its "Christian Era."  Or so they taught me in every
educational institution I\'ve been to.  It was viewed as more poilitcally correct
than "Anno Domini" - which means "in the year of our lord" - understandably a
problem when not everyone adopts the christian interpretation of Jahweh as
\'their\' lord.  The Imperial Calender Enforcement guys, proper name escapes me,
might have their own version, as might the real world, but its "Christian era."
After all, anyone is free to deny that jesus christ is his lord, but its hard to
deny the impact of christianity on the western world.

Although 313 A.D. would be a better starting point since this was the time of
the Edict of Milan issued, making Christianity the only religion to be practiced
in the Roman Empire.  BTW, I was suprised to learn that even this \'late\', in
Rome at the time of the edict, there were temples to such varied deities as Isis
and even some Norse gods (the work of the Varangian Guard, no doubt).

 I\'m afraid I must disagree.  It stands for Close Escort, and is best typified in
the CT era by the Gazelle class.   A truely outstanding ship to give to PCs,
especially when you replace the drop tanks with external cargo containers.

Also a good ship in demonstrating the philosophy of the Imperium, as the crew
berthing is on the lower deck, and can only access the command deck (and officer
quarters) via a long, easily defended passageway.  (With fuel tanks surrounding
that passage...)

Hmmm, missed that. In that case, the rules are different. In MT, the amount
rolled was the number of lots. The lot size, in tons, was determined later using
a different roll.

The cargo and freight definitions I use came from the MT rules. They\'re not that
important. The question still stands: where is the roll to determine how much
speculative cargo is available?

That makes sense. However, that\'s not the roll I\'m wondering about. I want to
know about the roll for what _types_ of speculative cargo is available, not how
much one can buy of each.

Until the Christians started making a huge fuss in the later Empire the
Romans were fairly tolerant, provided you didn\'t go round denying the
divintity of the Emperor. The Christians were perscuted because they
started saying that their god was the only one, etc, etc. This caused civil
unrest _because_ of the religious diversity of the Empire, not because of
repression of non official religions. The Roman Empire covered such a large
area and so many different cultures that it counldn\'t afford to enforce
only one religion, until Christianity was very common. BTW the Christians
threw Pagans to the Lions once they were in charge.

I don\'t think that\'s so much in the military, as in the society.

FWIW my varsity lecturers used it as a twrm for the period between the Dark

AD, extremely approximately.

I wouldn\'t gat too carried away with pre-moderns fighting for the good of
all, or even their country. In the Roman Republic the main reason for the
wars in Greece and Asia Minor were profit, and the profit went to the
Generals, and their cronies. The massive influx of wealth into the Roman
economy caused inflation and economic collapse, which did far more harm to
those at the bottom than those at the top. The wars also dragged men off
the farms, so they couldn\'t be worked properly, so they had to be sold at
rock bottom prices (or through mortgagee sales) to the great families who
turned them into slave farms, while the original owners whent to Rome and
starved (unless their menfolk came back with LOTS of booty). The British
conquered India for the money, and the businessmen and the British East
India Company investors sure as hell wern\'t the ones doing the dying. White
Man\'s Burden came along quite late in the piece.

Secrifice of one\'s self for the good of your country, or for freedom is a
modern idea, and once you start examining who actually profits from the war
it is unusual to find that the people as a whole are the priary
beneficiaries of the war. Look at the war of 1812 for example, or our own
(New Zealand) Moari Land Wars.

ObTrav: By 990 the Imoperial militaries have centuries of tradition and
honor to help with motivation and recruitment, and the clearly \'good\' role
of preserving the Imperium. However in M:0 these don\'t yet exist. Is
recreating the glories of the past an adequate motivator, or recruitment
draw? If not what do they use?

There are heaps of different traders in TNE, and the Guild is only one of
them. IIRC the TNE rules mention the possibility of a Free Trader campaign,
and it\'s certainly interesting option. 

Did/do you have _Path of Tears_? It has many adventure thread in it, 4 or 5
for each decently populated world in about 4 subsectors, and a good chunk
of them are trade or diplomacy missions.

But given thats it\'s a date based on the Christian calendar, and thus has
no significance to anyone else, how in the hell can it be \'common\'. IMO to
call it common is dishonest, and at least AD & BC tell us whose calendar it

Funnily enough I like TNE because it\'s not about how the free market rules.
I always felt the 3I was distressingly like the US in space - free trade is
what matters, etc. The fact that it somehow (despite its Vilani roots) had
a higher TL than all its neighbours didn\'t help.

And after Rome became Christian there was quite a lot of persecution of non
Christians, something many who go on about Romans throwing Christians to
the Lions don\'t seem to realise.

Turning Rover into a sapient is definitely a MEGA-project.  Why is it that
the only geneered races (that I\'ve come across) are major ones?  Or is that
there are just enough racial variations without mucking about in DNA-land
(or are they so far from what we could identify as \'originals\' that we -
Imperials - wouldn\'t know the difference)?

No it\'s not. Your player characters are dead if they can\'t talk their way
out of it. THAT\'S the way out I was talking about. They have a chance.
Players tend to get pissed at being put into inescapable traps, unless
they\'re tired of playing those characters.

Building a way out of the trap in the campaign planning stage is merely
prudent GM\'ing. The object of the game is _not_ to pit GM vs.
Players...that gets real old real fast. 

Of course, having said that building an escape is prudent, I have yet to
see the group of PC\'s who didn\'t see another way out...;-)

a) What is your favorite Traveller rules system?
b) What is your favorite official Traveller milleau (setting)?

We\'re curious...do people tend to use just one ruleset and its companion
setting - or are people doing something like what we\'re doing (classic
Traveller rules, Rebellion Setting).

I\'m not trying to start an argument over which is best (\'cause its a moot
point, we all have our favorites). Just wondering...

For the record, here\'s mine:
a) Favorite rules - Classic Traveller with DGPs Task System
b) Favorite setting - Rebellion

To which I respond (agreeing, mind you) that the only solution
is to attempt do do what you know is morally and tactically (even
strategically) sound and make damn sure that you don\'t lose the war.

The war crimes trials don\'t go so well for your side if you lose.

     What a load of horse crap!  Stick to the facts and not your narrow

     The goal wasn\'t to loot, it was to take it before the techno/xeno-phobic

and a fragment of interstellar society) lacking the moral repugnance and
arrogance of the late and lamented Last Imperium.

   Nice speech, too bad Sen. Glenn\'s Congressional record was that of a

honorable gentleman was re-elected each time he ran because he was a
distinguished veteran Marine Corps pilot and a former astronaut (not because
he was a good senator).

   That said, I think I can speak for everyone in wishing him a safe journey

he\'ll find that the ride has improved since the last time he was in orbit.

This is the general feeling I guess.  The key is to make sure your PCs
are pivotal characters with decision making powers.  In this case, it
is really quite similar to normal Traveller:

	type "S" or type "A"	-		warship
	co			-		group leader
	dept heads		-		PCs
	divos			-		PCs
	CPOs			-		PCs
	Ratings			-		PCs
	adventure/conflict	-		combat & shore leave
	NPCs (friendly)		-		Other ship\'s crews
						& ownship\'s crew
	NPCs (hostile)		-		Enemy, thugs (ashore)

The GM just has a little more control over the lives of the PCs.
Its exactly the same as the real world comparison.  But life in the 
military is very, very exciting (from time to time) and very boring
and needlessly (?) stresful at others.

All depends on what you want out of the game.  Like Bab5?  the the
Rebellion\'s for you.

So...who the first to join the IN?  (Uncle Lucan wants you!)

Noone denies there was technical progress after the fall of Rome.  But it was
a much more illiterate and savage time than the Pax Romana enjoyed for so
long.  Much of Roman culture and civilization was lost and Rome *was* the
"world."

   The Smithsonian Institute has become the home of every Politically
Correct crackpot this side of Greenwich Mean Time.  Look at what they
tried to do with the Enola Gay exhibit if you don\'t believe me--and
there are many other less publicized examples.  Even if the US Congress
cleaned out all of the top administrators tomorrow it will take years to
undo all the damage the Smithsonian\'s "historians" (and I use that term
very loosely) are doing to American history.

   \'Common era\'.  Common to who?  Which culture?  The Chinese? the
Arabs?  the Jews?  who?  What PC stupidity.  Recall what Voltaire said
about the Holy Roman Empire (assuming dead white guys rate that much
time in History classes these days).

Well, back before there was a web . . . yada yada gripe gripe . . .
Pure conspiracy, I tell you!

If "common" era it the way its spelled now, so be it.  I have never used the
term, nor will I.  Why don\'t we take 001-2001 A.D. as an opportunity to
fix our calendars and all the tinkering the Julian, Gregorian, etc. have
caused, add a year 0 as there ought to be, etc., and be done with the
damn thing.

Not sure if TNE used the same system for the Regency, but the T4 systems is

Adventure, encountered a pet store. The Ael Yael engineer they have (an
NPC) became outraged at the condition of the captive animals there and
convinced the group to stage a rescue effort. That effort will take
place next session while the other half of the group is burglarizing the
museum.

Anyway, one of the PCs declared he\'d like to buy a pet (the Luugir he
had several months previous died), and asked about the contents of the
cages. I hadn\'t expected that, so I made up some details about the
"Roran". The PC now wants to keep this animal once it\'s rescued.

So, I sat down tonight and tried to apply some Traveller rules and
general logic to the ramblings I uttered when that PC asked about the
creature. What follows is my first crack at the creature.

I\'d appreciate any comments from you, because (as you\'ll soon tell) I
know very little about biology or zoology. I fully expect to rewrite
this description, so whip out the proverbial red pen and make marks!

Here goes.
===========================
Roran
The Roran is a carnivorous chaser used mostly for sentry duty.
Originally from somewhere in the Old Expanses sector, they have been
transported to all parts of the Imperium over the course of centuries.

In the wild, Rorans are cave dwellers who travel in packs ranging in
number from at least three to as many as eighteen. Studies of their bone
structure and muscle distribution led researchers to conclude that they
originated on a small, low-gravity world with a high C02 content.

Soon after birth, the young Roran sprouts quills on top of its shell.
These serve to protect the creature from predators until puberty. During
this stage of development, the Roran also develops small suction cups
under its feet. It uses them to suspend itself on cave walls and
ceilings, again as a protective measure.

At puberty, the Roran leaves its cave in search of its own territory to
stake. Usually this new home turns out to be another cave. Since the
supply of caves is limited, a particular cave will be chosen by several
Rorans simultaneously. Physical combat (rarely lethal) usually
determines the master of the cave, with the losers of the fight becoming
less dominant members of the pack.

Several physical changes also occur at this time. The most important one
is the (seemingly random) choosing of a gender. The Rorans suction cups
and feet gradually disappear and are replaced by small wings. The armor
shell on its back softens and becomes considerably more pliable, to
enable the motions required for flight.

Adult Roran have the ability to fly for short periods in gravities of
less than 0.5G, where the atmosphere is standard density or higher.

Roran in the Imperium
Rorans are very territorial and therefore make excellent sentry animals.
There are two main difficulties the Roran owner needs to overcome.

First, Rorans use their solid excrement as territorial markers. As the
old feces dry up, new ones are used to replace them. The sense of smell
of most humans is sorely tried by this trait.

Second, in order to be accepted as part of the Roran "clan", the master
must engage in physical combat with the Roran, and win. The Roran must
perceive the owner as master of the clan, or it will attempt to be that
master.

Note to Players
Picture the young Roran as a turtle with porcupine quills on its back.
Picture the adult Roran has a sea tortoise.

The Traveller characteristics for the adult Roran follow.

True.  One thing to remember is taht they were putting their lives on
the line at the time of the accident.  They were doing their best and
made a mistake, and as deadeye and others have inferred, it will haunt
their souls in a form of punishment that none could ever inflict upon
them.  They\'re to be respected, despite their mistake.  

And this topic makes a wonderful topics for a Traveller adventure,
or at least a scenario.  This is fundamentally a great concept for
a "haunted" sort of character.  Very introspective.

I was brought up to view the above types (especially anthropologists) as
bleeding heart liberals, etc, etc, so all this does is strengthen is
\'CE/BCE is PC\' position.

And to think that some people can\'t see what a big deal the 3I calendar

Concur, but that was simply to try to save GDW by attracting youger
gamers.  The best stuff for Trav comes when it is not any nationality
projected into the future but something very different.

Given time and creative minds TNE will become way cool, just like
Harolds CoE stuff in the Trav Chronicle.

There is a difference between fratting your ally/buddy and collateral

That\'s a very \'western\' POV, you know. In fact most of the Roman culture

(Byzantine) Empire, until the Arabs, Crusaders and Italian city sataes did

The whole thing is silly hypersensitivity.  July is names after
a pagan emperor and Thursday after the pagan god Thor.  However,
even cristian Europe at it\'s most intolerant didn\'t have a
problem with that.

It\'s just silly to try and pretend that the number system
isn\'t based on what it is in fact based on because you
can\'t stand that a religion has the sort of historical
impact that other religions had before them.

	well if you think about that suerrat und lacian who had to suffer

	alias 3I) lost against a rowing fleet.

	birds of a feather are flocking together. when they start "to

	that people group of similar tongue, skin or thinking (the foot

	is a tool for powermongers, and it is for this reason supported by
	them. also xenophobi is likely to spring from patriotism, and
	in the hand of a technological elevated dictator patriotism can
	form an insane war maschine we have seen 50 years ago. How many
	worlds are balkanised in the 3I and why - divide and conquer.

	Wearing a pessure suite is a must whenever a trader leaves a
	starport.  The wilds are not secure and comon practice in
	trade ships is to reduce atmosphere to 0.1at, as this reduces
	chance of fire and pressure drop hurricanes inside the ship. At

	his kickback to enjoy one week suitless. Before exiting jumpspace
	atmos is reduced a second time, and anybody has to wear the
	suit and a compressor until arival. Thats 70 years of tradition
	of free traders who survived the hard times. When it was more
	chic to wear a light battle dress, those who could afford such
	a fancy dress (with a kill me-i\'m fighting for lucan-transponder)
	started to wear jumpsuites. After 70 years this became the second
	skin of anybody who is twice a month in space, for a good reason.

We played the other side, heroically defending our world\'s freedom against
the Evil Wanna-Be-Empire. :-)

The RC is as morally ambiguous as the Imperium (read Milieu 0 for dirt on
Cleon and the TI), but the writers that were published seemed to stick to
just one viewpoint.  Hivers & Ithklur hinted that there were more
perspectives coming, but GDW didn\'t last long enough for those to get
published.

I agree that the published adventures were militaristic.  I just didn\'t
use them for anything but setting.  And RC Marines make great bad-guy
NPCs, cause you\'ve got to use brains not firepower to defeat them (without
taking huge friendly casualties).

Hmm.  

Marc Miller = Merchants and Mercenaries
Dave Nilsen = Darwinists and Neocolonialists?

Unproven point.  We still have good reason to believe it WAS necessary
in the US military.  History be damned, I would not have wanted to be
the first on to the beaches of the Japanense mainland.  I would have
let the bombs fall.  It is fortunate that there was a rapprochment after
the war that allowed us to de-demonize the Japanese.

I know.  I am making a point that you can\'t easily have the interesting
stuff that is really out there in Trav in 2D.

Sometimes things need to be fixed, Trav or not.  We spend hours talking
about other things yet the foundation is wrong.  Frankly I don\'t care if
anyone uses 3D or not, but the brighter players will ask questions and
the answer is that 2D is used for simplicity.

In the meantime I will come up with a mapable solution to this problem.
It may involve increases in the basic range of jdrive. 

Why is this such a problem? Because military campaigns will not be
fought the way they have been in Traveller with a 3rd D to use.  For
realistic military space campaigns the vagargies and expanded frontiers
of 3D must be used.

Favourite rules - TNE et al, with some mods (home grown & from TW2K)

second (though I don\'t have the Hard Times book, blast it).

Apparently the mortality rate from radiation in the 200 rem range is much
higher than previously thought, especially in the likely post-nuking
environment, if only from stress related suppression of the body\'s immune
system.

From what I\'ve read in later publications (most of which seem to have
become unavailible here now) some of the assumptions made for those
calculation are somewhat suspect.

Pocket Empires is a product designed to detail the economic and military
development of a group of co-ruled planets and allow comparing them to
other such groups.  It is quite complex and involved (although there are
several "simpler" options) and it could be quite useful if you are willing
(and enjoy) doing the "work" of development.  Generally, your perspective
is as the lleader (or succession of leaders, usually) who direct the
development to whatever extent possible.

If terms like Gross Domestic Product and Technological Uplift make your
heart pump, its for you.  In fact, your isolated group might be well suited
to be considered a "Pocket Empire" since one of the shortcomings in my
opinion is the lack of consideration of membership in a larger community.

Here, here.  I\'m all in favor of ending the debate and signing Steve\'s

Regardless of politics I think the one thing that can be said is
whatever it is about Trav we are all birds of a feather.  We find
something in it.  

Just think how much it would suck knowing there was no one out there you
could tell any of these thoughts to, because no one cared.

We all have more in common than is immediatly apparent, and one man\'s
patriotism (always a dangerous word after Vedun and the Somme) really
relfects an idealism that is dying in the electronic age.

Hmmm.... Interesting idea, and one that I like - One of the last
Rule of Man colonies before the Long Night; it actually didn\'t
suffer much from the LN because it was intended to be an agrarian
society.  If it\'s recontacted and absorbed by the Third Imperium,
it\'s OK until the time of the Psionic Suppressions; if you can
keep it outside the borders (put it trailing of the 3I, spinward
of the 2KW?), it\'s playable in any era.  And remember that
Pernese dragon is not the same as Nuteman dragon - Pernese dragon

	Imho a 1G carrier with a PA and a long range laser and small
	bay of missiles, staying with the traders as fire support and a
	pack of fighters to engage the corsair and screen from enemy
	missiles, is a good escord but it will make a bad system defense.

	System defense does\'nt need a carrier for small fighters.
	Fighters are either under close orbit comand, or on station at
	the highport or even in a naval base at gas giants. if a system
	depoys a lot of fighter logistic and maintenance could call for
	a dedicated in system carrier. But as long as fighters are under
	orbital comand or at the highport, and there is no defense for
	the gas giants, you seldom need a dedicated carrier. Pack it in
	large cargo shuttle, if you need.

Hmmm? How fast would the surrender have come? Do you think LeMay
would have stopped firebombing while they twiddled their thumbs? The
raids already happening to Japan were pretty bloody awful, and
repeated on a daily basis. I suppose if total casualties are what
is of interest, it might be useful to figure out how many (average)
would happen per day of conventional war, then figure out in how
many days they\'d have to surrender to at least break even. I bet
you\'d have to get them to surrender pretty quickly...

I read in Tennozan that the British were planning on invading
Malaya around the beginning of September. The Japanese commanders
there had standing orders to kill all POWs, and send their troops to
where ever the front would be. There were something like 300,000
POWs in Malaya at the time--and they were on _our_ side.

Also, if Okinawa was any model at all (reasonable asumption) then
even a month or two of land war would\'ve killed more on both sides.
It\'s fair to say the the bomb wasn\'t required to end the war, just
that it hastened the end, for whatever reason you choose to belive.

Regardless, I suppose you have to say to yourself, how many of the
enemy are you willing to trade for even one of your own side--a brother,
son, father? I\'d say none. Hell, I have friends who might not
exist if things went differently at all (their dad was in the
process of being transfered to the pacific as infantry bound for
Japan).

I have a draft design for a patrol carrier but need to arm it yet (to at
least Patrol cruiser standard). It has a launch tube and 6 fighter bases
supporting most combinations between 6 x 30dt fighter and 18 x 10dt
fighter. Any suggesteions on weapons (TL12) would be appreciated - I have a
spec for volume left plus power available.

For system defense, or routine patrols (anti-piracy, etc.)? For the
former I don\'t think small craft are even useful, much less economic
:-) For the latter they are OK. That said I always really liked the
CT SDB design.

If gas giant refueling made sense, then rules that allowed little
tiny ships to kill huge ones during refueling might help make sense
of them. But as has been discussed over and over, GG refueling makes
no military sense.

	The theory that marines just charge the hill and allow their bodies
to pile up is totally false.  If you look at historical references to most
major battles you will find that the ratio of marines lost is less than that
of the army, or the enemy.  They have been known on several historical
occasions to hold against far superior forces, with just a handful of
marines.  If I were going into battle, I would much rather go in with the
longer, superior training of a marine, than that of their other military
colleagues.  Marines are generally well trained and disciplined troops,
though they have their moments of recklessness, it is generally controlled
recklessness.

This is only one possible motivation for "joinin\' up."  But a good one from
a sci-fi and space opera perspective.  Don\'t try to press all of your
military types into this mold though, but I have to take exception to the

I guess you assumed that everyone would be using/playing in their

after a long hiatus, as it is the currently in-print line...

I have never, thank God, come anywhere near a firing squad.  I suspect
that I might well commit war crimes under direct orders and threat of
immediate execution. History records that many people do, and I\'m more
cowardly than most.

But my great aunt chose to resist the Nazis, knowing the consequences were
almost certainly torture and death.  If a 16 year old girl can chose
almost certain death to rescue total strangers, maybe I could find some of
the same courage.

My great aunt survived the medical experiments at Ravensbruck for long
enough to be liberated. An amazing woman, and one of my heroes.

Aw, do I hafta? :-)

I usually do, but sometimes there is no other way out after a run of bad
decisions. That\'s life.  

When we were much younger, my brother suicided his favorite character
defending some women and children from pirates.  Opened fire from inside a
rescue ball - and kept firing instead of heading for the airlock because
he thought there were more pirates on the next deck. There weren\'t, but he
wasn\'t sore about losing the character, just said it was the right thing
to do and he\'d do it again, then rolled up another character.

I miss playing with him. He has a sense of morality missing from most
D&D-trained gamers.

Maybe his flag waving a bit off, but it does have a bit to do with Trav. 

I am developing a campaign where ideals like these mean a lot.  Not that
they are sacred or anything, but my campaign addresses the issues and
things that bind societies together.

We are the WEST. (Even New Zealand.)  Descended from Europe with all her
well known faults.  

Although I wear a US flag on my shoulder, don\'t doubt for a minute I
would personally blow the shit out of anyone who fucked with my blood, 
that "blood" being all of YOU.  I would fight and maybe die for you and
so would ALL my service bros-this I know for a fact.  (Even the guys
going to the airlines.  They are just tired of getting shit on by a
country that has no use for soldiers in peacetime. See R. Kiplings
"Tommy.")  That is why I get disturbed by hotdogs and careless F-15
guys- you get the wrong message about what is going on when WE are not
responsible custodians of our collective "treasures."

Generally there is a very strong vein of honor and duty still in the US
military that our current society cannot comprehend.

If we(US forces) feel this way then Imperial troops, inculcated for 1100
years(-100 of those barrcks wars) are going to feel similar if not
stronger.  They have a lot in common in the Imperial ideal, even if they
are from disparate worlds.  In a sense the Imperial identity is loyal to
no one world wheras the colonial/sector forces are.  

What about in C 0?  There is no unified Imperial Force, although Cleon
is doing his best to make it happen.  Of course, it does in time.

	Playing MT in the spinwards is like WWII in the US. The group

	When TNE came out our campain was at 1128 in Rurevayn, and followers
	of the Real Strephon. The "alles is kapput" in TNE is a strong plot
	line, where player groups can become heros over night. Also traders
	are not so "generic" as first thought about. Limited starport
	and overhaul capacities, make it likely that they align to one of
	the side. They could become Guild members (mafia) try to arrange
	with a TED or even a Vampire. Act as a raiding corsair (RC) or
	ignore everything and stay in the Regency. But we are not playing
	what "players was supposed to do". Avoid playing book variations.

> The rules were the best ever though.

	The space combat (BR/BL) is grandious, but the interpersonal
	combat is overcomplicated. Our group has a rule mix of TNE
	task system, simplified MT personal combat, and TNE space
	combat. But as usual - rules make bad games - stories make
	them enjoyable.

True.  One of the guys lives here, on this base.  He is getting on with
his life and is still flying(although they don\'t let him shoot things
any more.)

You fellas don\'t know the combat aviation community very well.  There is
a lot of ego on all sides, and he is reffered to as "that guy lives on
this base."  They screwed up.  The problem is there is a hint of "I want
to get my kill too before I go home from the sandbox."  And that is a
direct product of the pilot ego and is intolerable.   

I really shouldn\'t say more about this subject because my offhand
comments have developed into a touchy subject and it is off topic. 

Now let me rephrase myself to get at the real meaning behind all of
these comments I\'ve been making.

I have been very bothered by the deaths of 20 odd tourists in Italy
several days ago at the hand of a US pilot, apparently hotdogging in the
Dolomite mountains.  He flew under a gondola cable, sending the tourists
to their deaths so he could be "cool."  Some of our folks pull this s**t
wherever we go, and it is not right.  If we are going to send our forces
around the world and impose on other nations then we better damn be
willing to die for THEM and at least control our urges.

BTW, I have probably 1000 hours of time at less than 500\' and over
450mph, and these routes are meticulously plotted.  He knew the cables
were there and was being reckless.  

So on behalf of all the folks out there I just wanted to say that I am
sorry.  And it sucks.

Was it?  What earth-shaking political change occurred then?  How \'bout we

further and date from the aborted sacrifice-attempt of Isaac (did I get the
Christianized name right?), since that\'s a date most of us can agree on, if
we can determine it?  Most scholars agree that you don\'t even have Christ\'s
birthday right...

Better yet, you keep your calendar, I\'ll keep mine.  ObTrav: "Let\'s see,

of three lower case Is onto the end, to differentiate them from other weird

Is that what T4 was dedicated to?  I thought it was us: you, me, and TML,

keeping family together, avoiding divorce, and, nevermind, what the heck to
"family values" have to do with FANTASY?

What is the cost of Mail fittings; This needs to be defined in this section
or in Starship Construction.  There also needs to be a Quantity or max for
Mail (or is it one unit at Kcr 25?) or everyone would just carry Mail.

Above should say "Freight". Per Below;

[snip]

Ian Whitchurch posted a long Economic message a while back that proposed
using four categories of goods for speculative cargo.  Basically, all that
changes is the base price and, instead of adding/subtracting cr1000 it
adds/subtracts a percentage of base.

I still have his email (and some of our subsequent discussion) and I think
its a good idea.  Let me know if you want the original or a digest of the
four categories.

He also proposed increasing freight fees based on the number of parsecs
travelled in one week;

Jump 2  Cr. 1250/ton
Jump 3  Cr. 1500/ton

This makes a lot of sense since speed (even relative between one week or
two) should come at a premium.  Jump 4 "couriers" may be a typical PC ship
under this scheme if the freight price continues to rise.  This change also
doesn\'t disrupt Imperial history either.

I\'m running an economically driven campaign and this aspect definitely
needs to be "medium background" for a campaign.  Ian has some great ideas,
but they are too complicated for easy use.  A middle ground needs to be
found between the good Merchant Prince method and his more detailed methods
which involve a trade matrix for every two worlds involved.

Steve\'s Idea, actually. All I did was supply the name of the typeface (sort
of...they don\'t make it anymore, so we had to use a modern substitute).

And, later on:

It may be helpful at this point to remind people just who the Art Director is
at Steve Jackson Games these days (some guy named Wiseman, I heard) and who
will be teaching Dan Smith what Traveller is supposed to look like. 

I often think my most important contribution to Traveller was hiring Bill
Keith, lo these many years ago. 

And, responding to whoever said:

Gentlebeings: Steve is a Traveller fan. Long term. Dyed in the wool. He makes
some of you look like pikers by comparison.

An Example: He saw some of the teaser TNS releases I am having put onto the
GURPS: Traveller Web page (you\'ll see them soon enough), and he came into my
office to tell me that they made his hair stand on end in excitement. And he
was not kidding -- he had goosebumps. His eyes glowed. He wanted to talk
possibilities - and he left five minutes later still excited. Unless I screw
up big time, Traveller is going to be a GURPS product line for a long time.
Make of it what you will.

As I mentioned in another post in this thread, they certainly were.  Temples to
even Isis, Greek and Norse gods in Rome even in 300 A.D.

Yup.  Romans allowed for \'conquered\' territories to manage much of their own
affairs (one reason they could control so much territory), in much the same way
that the Imperium allows for much autonomy within a system - although this of
course changed over time.

Interesting stuff about Nero on History Channel last week.  When the big fire
happened, apparently Nero blamed Christians as they were the most unpopular
people in town at the moment (although many suspect Nero\'s agents of causing
the fire so he could build his new palace in the place).  The report said that
Christians hadn\'t been singled out for the lions before the fire.

I want them back in space.  I want people, perhaps the player characters,
to spend time as their wards, developing their technology and world
slowly, forming a tiny Chamaxi Scout Corps from the few that are
ready for it and laying groundwork for the others.

An emerging starfaring culture, to teach, study, and help.  There may
be enormous political implications.

I want them back on Chamax.  As a jump start for their race, they
have a precedent for colonisation, a homeworld to analyze, and
possibly distant relations in cold sleep approaching Chamax\'
neighbors.  This is an urgent motivation to get some into space
quickly, to involve the players in saving Chamax culture, maybe
to be instruments in aiding the recovery of a civilisation.

Definitely a means to gain an entire cultures\' alliance.  Perhaps
exclusive trade rights.  How about the artifacts on Chamax?

I want this to blossom beyond a single world, to add a new variable
in an already complex equation, to tip the scales in a new direction.
Something like:

year
- -2	Discover Chamax plague
+0	Discover Shriekers
+1	TL3; School established
+2	Shrieker visitation to Chamax 
+5	TL4; Chamaxi Scout Corps established
	Expeditions to Chamax continues

Is that so wrong?  For Muslims, it has nothing to do with not wanting to
"acknowledge" Christ (p.b.u.h. - who was a full-fledged, virgin-born,
prophet is his own right, given the power authority to lead the Ummah
against the unbelievers in the Last War), but rather that we don\'t think
that any HUMAN was ever important enough to base a calendaring system
around.  If this offends, please grant us your official, er, was it
"indulgence"?  FWIW, aren\'t all years "years of the Lord?"  ;-)  Has it
bothered anyone else that there\'s still a "C" somewhere in it?  Heh.  I
cannot speak for the heathens, athiests, or agnostics in the crowd.

ObTrav: I think it very politically savvy for the Imperium to use it\'s own
founding as Year Zero (besides being binarily correct) -- it avoids all the
petty wrangling inherent in any other choice.  My Roman history is terribly
dusty and rusted, but didn\'t they use basically the same rationale for their
calendar?  What possessed the Mayans (no apolitical correctness intended ;-)
to choose the date they did?  Did they sacrifice anyone who disagreed with
the choice?  Or was that the Aztecs?  After all we now have the "Ministry of
Calendar Compliance" and who knows, besides espionage, maybe the MCC engages
in human sacrifice...  Those darn Imperials.

Flames, anyone?

What was so bad about the Middle Ages?  I\'m rather enjoying my survey of
Medieval literature this semester (my wife\'s convinced that I am only a
student because I can\'t deal with the withdrawal of not being in class
anymore; it\'s really because I want an MBA.  Right?).  The literature of the
"day" (okay, millenia) is rather enlightened, eclectic, and accepting.  Oh,
you must be thinking of the Spanish Inquisition...  The Moors (good Muslim
boys, mostly) tried to put an end to all that, but Columbus came along and
kicked them out...  Or was that Ferdinand/Isabella?  Just kidding!

ObTrav: speaking of the holy Roman King and Queen, does anyone know who the
Empress of the Third Imperium is?  I can\'t think of any canonical references
to her...

ObTrav: what are the marriage practices of the Imperial nobility?
Victorian?  Eclectic?  Confused?  (Don\'t ask what prompted that question...)

Marc, a question and a comment.

Q:  Does this mean that cargo for hire is now to be referred to as Freight
and speculative cargo is now to be referred to as Cargo?

C:  You might want to note under specialized trade (like in CSC on p 50-52)
that the GM needs to use some discretion with hand-made and small and/or
high tech items.  For example: Business Rings, even in a fancy jeweler\'s
box, would take up less than 25 cc\'s.  A Subsidized Merchant Captain with an
empty cargo hold could pile in beau coup Business Rings (over 100,000,000 of
them).  I know that\'s an extreme example, that\'s why I chose it.  As to
hand-made items they would be available in smaller lots, just because they
are hand made.  A framed canvas painting might only average about 100,000
cc\'s.  Can you see going to a painter and buying 28,000 paintings?  I know,
I know, it\'s ridiculous, but if you don\'t put it in, there will be some
barracks room lawyers beating GM\'s over the head with it.

Also don\'t forget that old joke about the businessman/tourist who went over
seas and found a little old craftsman (I guess you\'d say artisan) carving
statues on the beach.

You haven\'t heard it?

He goes up to the little old craftsman is working and admires the work.  The
old man hands him the statuette and says "Go ahead and look at it, it\'s
native wood, you won\'t break it."

The businessman is amazed at the detail, and asks the craftsman, "How much
do you want for it?"

The craftsman smiles and says, "For you just $10."

The businessman whips out his wallet and gives the craftsman $10.  Smiling
with glee, he asks, "How many of these do you think you could make in a
month?"

The craftsman says, "That one took me about an hour, if I worked 8 hours a
day 6 days a week, I could probably turn out about 200 of them in a month."

The businessman\'s heart soars, because he knows that with his contacts back
home, he could easily sell 200 of them every month for $23 apiece without
any problem.  He calculates that the shipping would only be about $3 apiece
so he could turn a profit of $2,000 per month.  A net increase in his income
of $24,000 per year just for noticing this little old man while on his
vacation.

So, he turns to the craftsman and asks, "And if I were to buy 200 of them
per month how much would you let me have them for?"

The craftsman looks somewhat puzzled and thinks for a moment then replies,
"$25 apiece."

The businessman is amazed, and asks, "Haven\'t you ever heard of a volume
discount?  Why would it cost me two and a half much to buy them in bulk than
it did to buy just this one?"

The wizened little old craftsman smiled and replied, "The figurine you hold
only cost you $10 because I could see how much you liked it.  And I had fun
making it.  The 200 figurines per month would cost you $25 apiece because
then it wouldn\'t be fun, it would be work."

Ok, so the comment included a joke.

One last thing, thanks for the sneak peak.

Part of the story is what your players want/expect.  Unless I\'ve discussed
it with my players in advance, the acid test for me is whether it would fly
at a convention as a tournament adventure.  The "everybody dies" plot may
work for lame games like Paranoia... but even Cthulhu and Dark Conspiracy
players expected a certain amount of heroism, including survivability from
their games (not necessarily for every character, I guess).

A telling quote (against my argument!) is from a Millennium\'s End game
[where the characters are generally supposed to be hard-bitten, cynical, and
self-centered]: "Of course, I\'ll go save the girl...  I\'m a hero!"  This, of
course, as all GMs know was *not* what was supposed to happen, and should
have been expected as it was unexpected, but... they all pulled through,
mostly unscathed.

I guess it\'s "Have fun!" even if that means your favorite character bites
the big one.  Of course, you can play in a campaign like the "X-Files" where
"nobody ever really dies."

Amen!  I hate nothing worse than playing in someone else\'s game who\'s out to
prove they\'re "smarter" then me (first of all, this is not hard to do), and
secondly, especially if you run the universe...

Yeah.  Complete agree.  Here\'s an example that makes neither point
whatsoever, but I felt like sharing:

GM: What?
PC: How hard would it be to jump into the APC?
GM: You want to storm a moving APC?
PC: Well, if it\'s do-able...
GM: <pulls totally impossible task from thin air>
[clatter of dice]
PC: <pulls equally impossible success roll from thin air>
GM: Umm.  You manage to clamber over the side, but drop your MP-5 in the
process.  It\'s mangled in the tracks.
PC: *shrug* Okay. I draw my Glock and shoot the .50 gunner, then the driver.
GM: The loader will try to clobber you over the head with a half-full belt
of .50 shells.
[clatter of dice, marginal success, 2d+3 damage rolled]
PC: Ouch.  I guess you decided I didn\'t see him, huh?  I shoot the loader,
the gunner, then the driver...

Will wonders never cease?  Sometimes PCs are like cockroaches...

If I were you, and you paid for your education, I would demand a full
refund.  If you attended strictly public institutions: well, you sure got
what you paid for.  Any history professor with a clue and a bona fide degree
from any accredited university besides Mary Kay\'s Mail Order School O\' What
We Thunk Happened would have corrected your obviously interpolated
misconception.

ObTrav: how does accreditation work for 3i-era institutions?  Is it more
"medieval" in that reputation is the only guiding light?

How does "Christian Era" change that connotation?  I find it even more
annoying, oppressive, and contemptible.  It implies that the last millennia
was driven by Christ (p.b.u.h.) himself.  How could he do this from heaven?
(Sorry, Muslim belief that will likely be lost on most readers.)  Most of
the technical progress was made by self-proclaimed atheistic scientists.
The rest, well, is Western society really "progress"?

ObTrav: are most societies bi-calendarial?  Or only those elements that have
to deal with outsiders regularly?  How much does different day/night cycles
impact your games, depending on the world visited, of course?

Once again your lack of education fails you.  The Edict of Milan did NOT
make Christianity the only religion practiced by the Roman Empire, nor even
the "state" religion.  All that the Edict of Milan did was to make it LEGAL
to practice Christianity as a religion and to make it illegal to
discriminate against Christians (assuming they don\'t make asses of the
themselves on mailing lists).  Those temples still exist, BTW.

ObTrav: what kind of discrimination laws exist in the Imperium?  If the 3i
is non-interventionist as we are led to believe, then local governments
could have all kinds of inhumane policies in place...  Funny: to be more
concerned with calendar compliance than human rights.  I\'m sorry I thought
of that, but it does remind me if current US foreign policy.

Really?  What were the statistics about the number of practicing,

butt-humping, and Sabbath-breaking instead?  (Or sleeping off the

Hmm, difficult to find, but ObTrav: how many of you folks have used cultural
conflicts to cause tension for your PCs?  Either in a contact with
primitives context or in a "civilized" setting where the PCs just don\'t
conform with the norms and are ostracized, beaten, jailed, or just denounced
as complete boobs?  Can you share any good ideas for making my PCs lives
miserable?  They just slew my pet Althaxi, after all (or so they think)...

Really?  Where\'d y\'all steal algebra, architecture, and intact copies of
original Greek and Roman works from?  Not Rome...  There are those "Roman"
numerals nobody uses anymore in favor of the Arabic numerals (how\'d they get
called that? the Arabs don\'t use \'em...)  Rome might be the world you
remember, but if you think it *was* the world, then there\'s this really big
Wall in China I\'d like to sell you an authentic piece of.  Gotta love all
the burning, pillaging, rapine, and rape that Pax Romana brought to my
peaceful, singing Celtic ancestors.  They even had the gaul (sorry, had to
use that pun!) to leave the Brits on *OUR* islands!!!  (Apologies to
peaceful, nonflammable citizens of the UK who may unnecessarily be offended
by my distantly Irish humor.)

I\'m sure that Chaucer, Sturluson, Dante, and de Troyes would agree with you
about the Middle Ages being a much darker and more illiterate time.  Oh, and
some guy named Pythagorus might have some interest, too.  I guess if you\'re
only counting West-of-What? tradition it might not be as bright as, say,
MTV, Ellen, and Titanic.  Nah, I\'ll go back to Bede.  (Sorry for that pun,
too.)  Oh, some guy named Shakespeare wants to talk to you...

ObTrav: how many other institutions, world governments, and corporations in
your Traveller (besides 3i, several Vilani bureaux, etc.) lay claim to
pre-Long Night sources for their justification and authority?  Just
curious...  Reading some of Sturluson (a Christian recording traditional
oral tales of the Norse for those who\'ve not read him) who laid claim for
some of the Norse mythos all the way back to pre-Grecian times for his moral
authority (Odin = Hector? How odd.) gave me the inspiration for this
question...


Oh, hey, AolerTNE, how\'s it feel to be paying another $2 bucks a month to be

Do you think that it silly to more accurately represent history?  I don\'t.
Christ has NOT dominated world history the way that so-nominating the dating
system would indicate.  In most of the world, people think that
Western/Christian beliefs are quaint, ludicrous, and/or uninteresting and
inapplicable to daily life.  FWIW, nobody is stopping YOU from using BC/AD.
We refer to your own calendar for YOUR convenience: we have our own
calendar, more accurate and more tied to the seasons, tides, and other
relevant details - and it doesn\'t deify anybody.  It is, however, probably
too complex for tiny brained folk.  In the same way, we use YOUR language to
address you for YOUR convenience, because we wouldn\'t want to hurt your
little feelings by speaking to you in a tongue that you obviously couldn\'t
learn if you tried and thereby hurt your self-esteem.  Feel free to call it
A.D. ("And i Don\'t have a clue") if you want to: it won\'t hurt my feelings
one bit, antiquarian.

Calling enemies \'divided friends\' is definitely silly, but YOU thought of
it, not us...

Next on the docket I recommend that we rename the silly nomenclature adopted
for naming the hemispheres: what do y\'all think that you\'re "west" of
anyway?  *snicker*

More obvious deviationist sexual maladjustment from the western so-called
capitalist.  [Aside: funny, but the best salesman I know are descended from
long lines of Middle Eastern camel-traders.  ObTrav: who represents the best

No, sorry, Scott, I misspoke -- they can\'t sell oxygen to an oxygen thief.

I played in a military setting and liked it. It has advantages for
the ref since he can control the direction easily (partially your
point, I realize :-)

That said there were lots of interesting subplots to the FFW. Fleet
crushed, stragglers forced to ditch on a soon to be occupied world.
They helped resist the Zhos til the Navy liberated them. Various
adventures getting back to our new assignment. The battles
themselves, even if we were off in a corner (so we wouldn\'t get
instantly killed, no doubt :-)

I\'ve been skirting around this issue so here it goes.

I have been running and working on a military based campaign for
MegaTraveller detailing Lucan\'s Vengeance Fleet and its excursion in
1118 into Dulinor\'s territory for the last two years.

I hated MT at first.  They trashed my beloved Imperium and my SM
campaing would never be the same.  But after some time I got attracted
to DGP\'s beautiful stuff.  Sure the rules weren\'t tight, but the
grandeur of it got my attention.  And Reynolds/Vilardi/Caswell/Peter\'s
art.  They put together good books and I loved them. I loved getting to
know Norris, Dulinor and Strephon.  But it was hard to run anything in
that environment.

Then one day when I was sitting alone and bored in Guam, sweltering from
unbeareable heat and a broke airconditioner, I came up with an idea. Why
not run a short campaign as a bunch of grunts in that wartime setting?  
Well, seeing as Guam is in the Marianas chain, (only 100 miles south of
Tinian) I got a good taste of something Traveller lacked.

Military campaigns happen for a reason:geography.  A 2D Imperium didn\'t
have what I wanted, which was a chokepoint where a decisive battle could
be fought, or subtly maneuvered around. I needed 3D topology to see how
and why things would happen; 2D did not work because it didn\'t allow for
all the stellar junk, dustclouds debris and astronomy I wanted to put in
so the PC\'s could maneuver in and around.  I also decided that contrary
to popular Traveller I wanted an area not in clear space, but a region
of stellar wreckage and birth to cast a blood red glow on all the war
within.  I designed it in 3D and placed it right between Dulinor and
Lucan, in a region of a real dustcloud(rift.)

I called it Naryanganjo Corridor, named after the red supergiant
Naryanganj at its GalSouth mouth.  In this sector the 3 forces of Lucan,
Dulinor and Strephon would meet.

It has since grown to be the most intricatley detailed, coherent sector
ever done for (heretical) Traveller with artwork that is better than
anything ever done for Traveller.  When I said I am detailing the
Vengeance Fleet I meant it.

Being military I have a unique view on these things.  Imagine a short
guidebook on how to command a military ship.  Now play the senior
characters on it, ala Star Trek. Or deckapes.  

Did I hear, "Either way the ship fundamentally depends on the NPC\'s,
it\'s too big!"  

True, but if roleplayed well that IS exciting. These NPCs are not spear
carriers.  Done right they are the game.  Who cares if your PC has
MCR2000?  It gets them nothing except more paper and graphite notes. 
Personal interaction is what make roleplaying truly fun and getting the
NPC\'s to do right is a daunting and rewarding task.  Of course this
takes a very good GM to run them all.  One session of mine typically has
20-40 well detailed and acted NPC\'s.  And I love those NPCs!

I intend to continue working on this setting in my spare time and
publish it.  When it is(if ever) done, it will be the definitive on how
to run a military campaign in Traveller.  

Limited options in the mil?  Not quite.  But someone needs to tell you
guys what can be done in the TravMil.  A lot of that is stories from us
that has actually seen "the shit."  All those millions of little
anecdotes that would make a game by themselves.  I want to compile them.
Just having these materials detailed would be valuable for all Traveller
players.

My biggest beef is on the fate of the Imperium itself.  Remember those
Argon Blue codes?  Strephon has them and the secret of Longbow.  Know
what?  The Admiralty knows about Longbow too.  And contrary to popular
belief these guys are not bootlickers and yes men.  Political?  Yes, but
they are no cowtowers to a maniac.  They are the hard men of the
Imperial Navy, sworn for 500 years to defend the Emperor and empire and
will not roll over.  They are the nobles and men who chose(were
volunteerd) to serve with all thier heart(sort of.)

And Strephon is no idiot.  When he broadcasts/delivers his message in
1119( after taking a shelacking) the Admiralty gets a different version
complete with codes, schematics and proof. Beyond a shadow of a doubt
they know the truth, and act on it.

They know and it don\'t go like it did in MT or TNE.


Okay, rant off.  If you like this keep yapping and I\'ll say more.

Always check your sources.  Many don\'t believe that to be as authoritative a
source as once it was.  Too bad really.  They pulled a Christine Whitman
about Pearl Harbor, too (alienated their supporters).

Common meaning "common to the world."  All of the ethnicities you cite
existed then as now.  It isn\'t useful, Harold, to compare the Western
tradition to itself anymore, according to most intelligentsia (and useful,
interesting, and knowledgable professors as well) as it\'s been done to
death.  As we become a more global society in general, it is much more
useful to compare the "common era" in which lots of pretty neat things
happened on all continents.  [FWIW, I\'ve always preferred Hobbes,
Machiavelli, and Sun Tzu to Voltaire, myself.]  Nobody with a brain is
suggesting that AD be dropped entirely in usage; I\'m sure that John-Paul
will at least see to it that it continues in usage.  However, due to what I
call "Microsoft dating" (not virtual sex, folks) the backward compatibility
issue with our current, lame calendar system must be maintained, even if the
naming conventions are changed.

Hell, we can\'t get folks in the US to learn metrics, how\'re we going to get
them to accept a more modern calendar?  [ObTrav: this is why most worlds in
*my* Traveller have adopted bi-calendarial systems.]  Should we choose the
even more contentious date for starting our new calendar, like 04 July 1776
CE?  That won\'t fly, even here in the states...  Someone suggested earlier
that we scrap the current calendar and start over with a new one, but I
don\'t think that\'ll happen.  Common Era is just a compromise of form and
functionality.  Nothing personal.

Keep a stiff upper lip, we haven\'t taken away X-mas, yet.  Just bagged
Valentine\'s Day in some school districts, though.  Heh.  A joke, a joke.
Relax people.  Cultures change, and the America most of us were raised in no
longer exists except in our memories...  I think Darwin said it best: adapt
or die.  [I\'m sure our European comrades-in-arms are having even more
difficulties with the emergance of the EU, they just more tact than to
inflict them on us. ;-]  I speak from an economic standpoint about change:
the company I work for has changed it\'s entire management/marketing
philosophy for just this reason - to appeal to an increasingly, like it or
not, diverse customer base (people who buy gasoline - petrol for those
across the pond).  If we don\'t appeal to them, we lose business, wither, and
die.  Just because we don\'t like a trend or a poll doesn\'t mean that we can
ignore it...

I for one am glad to see a kinder, gentler (*roflmao* doublespeak still
kills me) Traveller.  T4 is no longer published just in the states: never
was just in the states really.  If publishers want to grow their businesses,
they have to realize this and appeal to a broader range of consumers.
Another example: rice.  Yup, y\'all buckeyes (denizens of the state of Ohio
for those across the pond) wouldn\'t like it much if we Texans (I used to be
a buckeye) flavored all the prepackaged rice, grown here, that you buy in
the store; we think it\'s too bland - no enough cayenne, habanero, and
jalapeno for us.

ObTrav: another perennial thread, sort of, but how many people (besides me)
inflict snack duty on players?  Do you demand that they bring something
Travelleresque to the table?  (No, even though this GM can be bribed with
white fudge covered Oreos, they are NOT Travelleresque.)

No flame intended, Harold.  You\'re a great guy.  I guess we\'ll just have to
agree to disagree.  [BTW, I\'m sorry about Glenn.  IIRC, even the NRA was
silent on how to vote on that one; at least word of it never filtered down
here.  I\'m going to be up to visit the parents in Toledo during 16-21 March
or so; which part of the Peoples\' Republic of Ohio are you in?]

Not just for the Regency. It\'s the "basic" trade system for TNE.

Yeah it is.  I\'m referring to the European remnants of the Roman Empire (about
Italy and westward).  I know well about the Byzantines.  My favorite areas of
history are the Roman Republic, Medieval Europe (from 1066 to say 1291) and
the history of the Church in general.  The Byzantines are big in that period
and they\'re very important to Church history as well.    : )

I\'ve heard that too many times: \'TNE was just about SAG raids; military
stuff.\'

SORRY???? I fail to understand.

Yeah, there was a fair amount of that, but there was so much more you could
do. I played TNE with homegrown rules of my own devising, so no, I\'m not a
fan for the sytem\'s sake. I now play T4, anyway.

TNE was about rebuilding after the Collapse. Not just an excuse for SAG
raids and decapitation strikes, it was about a society dragging itself out
of the ruins. Sure, some of the things they did were unpleasant, but TO THE
PEOPLE OF THE RC they were Ok because they were necessary. 

Which is better? Be aggressive and take stuff & hurt people, or quietly
stagnate/die?

They did what they thought was necessary. No more.

Ever play The Morrow Project? It\'s about reconstructing the USA after WWIII
and a century of barbarism. My TNE game had elements like that in it.

Yeah, we did SAG raids. One, actually. Then there were the diplomatic
missions, the desperate searches for vital artifacts or knowledge to avert
disaster.. the PCs who sacrificed themselves to save a column of refugees
on some nameless world... the bitter desolation of a fallen empire.
Tramp-trading out in the wilds, internal security ops, riot control,
salvage ops, political maneuvering, exploration, colonial establishment and
support, corporate espionage, military operations and an Ancients site....

I seem to remember that TNE presented a situation - here\'s the ruins; go
dig yourselves out and build something new. The setting was wide open in a
way that the mature Imperium wasn\'t. Three guys in a tired old
scout/courier could make a difference, and my players spent their time
REALLY trying to make that difference, to build a future. The New Era was
wide open... you could do with it whatever you liked.

Yet some people seem to be saying \'all you could do was SAG raids\'. 

I think someone is missing the point.

I\'ll quote one of my players... \' If we take over a regressed world, we end
up as kings of nothing. If we help that world rebuild, we earn ourselves a
future. Somebody\'s got to do this and there\'s only us. But where do we
start?\'

My lot really thought about helping rebuild... what to do, how to do it,
what they needed. That led to dozens of adventures - very varied ones at
that - wherein they tried to get the resouces they needed together/convince
the locals to follow them/remove obstacles/ overcome the latest setback.

Oh yeah.... and once I ran a SAG mission out of the book. It was fun, a
nice change of pace after all the politicking and the
talking/trading/spying.

But it certainly wasn\'t the be-all and end-all of TNE.

Stridently....

     Well...  it was considered scandalous.  Isis was a \'mystery cult\'
introduced during the Republic.  "Decent" society was appalled.  Greek gods
were long considered Roman equivalents and Norse?  The Vikings didn\'t become
known in Europe until Charlemagne, IIRC, though I may be wrong on that?  I
certainly have never heard of Norse gods being worshipped in Rome.

    The Romans actually misinterpreted Christianity twice. First, they took
communion to be cannibalism and then they interpreted it as a form of near-
atheism.  Both didn\'t last long, but made good scapegoats later on.  The Jews
were tolerated in Rome.  They were granted many favors because they supported
Augustus in the Civil War.  It was only the many Jewish revolts and Judea
being such a pain in the butt that kept it from being very respected.

     The Romans didn\'t really care on internal arrangement as long as taxes
were paid and there was no human sacrifice going on.  There\'d be the tax-
farmers and the Roman provincial governor, of course. : )  Later on, it turned
into raising native legionaries too.

Not sure what you\'re referring to here.  Do you mean the calender devised by
Christians based on the birth of their spiritual leader Christ, renamed in
order to make it more palatable to the rest of the world?

Like I said, if they wanted a real change, then change the calender, not just

Nah, don\'t try to push all of my military types into this mold.  Just trying
to look at it realistically, if I had the chance to go to space, possibly
never to return, I\'d have to think pretty seriously about taking it.  I
probably wouldn\'t do it myself, but just the option is almost mind boggling.

On the other hand, the only military NPC that I run is a hardened veteran type
of guy, with little input into the games (other then that he speaks in a
British accent and tells the PCs where their next mission is).

J-Man, in your game you can do that, and it would work, but it won\'t work
in orthodox Traveller. That\'s why I made the joke, "and they call *me* a
heretic."

If you *do* try this, you\'ll have to make the mines almost impossible to
detect until the ships are among them, and that\'s going to be *very* hard.
Hard for the same reason missles will have a tough time getting through
point defenses. 

Shoot, if you can make mines that hard to detect, just put det-lasers in
them.

Roleplaying military adventures *does* offer a number of options and plenty
of excitement. However, there are problems, one of which is that most
players don\'t like a situation where one of them is the boss and everyone
else is a subordinate, particularly in a military sense. That doesn\'t mean
you (and they) can\'t/won\'t do it...think a Startrek game...but it takes a
different style of playing/gming from the standard Traveller style where
everyone is more or less equal.

Anders, I tell my Computer Concepts classes that we simply don\'t know if
nano-technology will ever come about, especially, the replicator/nanobot
sort of technology, but it might and it\'s worth pursuing about even if it
leads someplace else.

We are well on the way to building working micro-machines. Working gears,
levers, switches, springs, and rods have all been built. Simple machines
built from these parts powered by static electricity. They are a long way
from *any* kind of engine, ;-> but they are a step along that road.

If you want my opinion, I\'m *sure* we\'ll get commercially useful and
profitable simple machines down to a micron or two, I\'m pretty sure we\'ll
get them down to the nano size range, I think we might be able to build
complex computational engines down to a few microns, I think it\'s unlikely
we\'ll go all the way down to replicators or nanocomputers. But that\'s my
conservative opinion.  

<sigh>

Tell you the truth, *I* still see the singularity out there...ten, twenty
years ahead, and I have no idea what\'s on the other side. People twenty
years younger than me probably don\'t see it quite the same way, and just
might be able to see beyond my horizon. In twenty years when I\'m an old
fart that can\'t handle the "brave new nano-world" and the young turks are
seeing *their* singularity (whatever *that* is), maybe their children will
see beyond their horizon...maybe.

IAC, I do *not* want to roleplay out on my horizon.  I *like* the 50\'s feel
of Traveller with it\'s big clunky computers and silver suits, it\'s
comfortable and comfortablly futuristic for me. ;-> Just call me...

Hum, I thought it was Current Era, but I\'m probably wrong.

Yes, that\'s what I was taught as well.  The "Dark Ages" were from about 500
to 900 AD, and is also called the early Middle Ages.  The Medieval period
was from around 700 to 1300 AD, makes up the bulk of the Middle Ages, and
corresponding to the development and flourishing of the feudal system.  The
Renaissance started in the 14th century in various city states and spread
across Europe during the next few hundred years.

The Long Night....and if I can\'t say that, then CT *before* the Imperium

Not just one ruleset, not just one setting. Heck, you know me...I play a
mixture of everything I like, everywhen I like.

I started out this morning (or afternoon) on a soapbox concerning off topic
posts.

I believe I said that, as a list, we do not stray too far off topic, and do
not need to be herded back constantly.

I logged on later to find out, I was wrong in a huge way.  I am deeply
saddened that a question I asked blew up in such a nasty manner.  It compounds
some very bad, unrelated news I\'d gotten tonight about a close friend...

I will ask something that before today I wouldn\'t have ever asked, and
probably never will ask.  Can we please kill the CE and BCE/AD and BC
discussion?  This is not based on the fact that its an eyesore, nor that it
quickly disinterested me.  Its just that it seems to be bringing out the worst
in alot of people, a side of many of you I\'d not like to see at the moment.
Its messy, and in a number of occasions it seems to have degenerated into
personal insults, some masked, some in the open.  If you aren\'t going to stop
the discussion, please put your brain in gear before putting your typing
fingers into motion, or take the personal insults to private e-mail so I don\'t
have to see the childishness and immaturity that something as seemingly
innocent as a renamed dating system could bring about.  This is really
disheartening to see the TML reduced to this state so quickly.

Now this goes against the grain of what I tried to defend in my post against
screaming \'off-topic\' too early.  This place is beginning to look like it
should be called \'alt.sfrpg.traveller\' or something like that...

Sorry for inadvertently starting the whole thread, and thank you for paying
attention if you got this far.

T4 is my favorite, it is elegant and simple and it is perfectly suited to my
style of roleplaying.  Very user friendly to new players, with enough depth
for even jaded "old-heads", I like it a bit.

TNE was a good system, but it was clunky to play and combats took a good long
time to finish...  especially one time when my PCs had a firefight on a train,
and one half were in the front of the train, and the other half were in the
rear, and no lie, there was a _really_ low ceiling on the way back and forth
where there were two stairs, run one way, hit the front of my skull, run the
other way and I would hit the top of my skull against the ceiling.  I must
have hit my head something like 5 times each way.  My head hurts thinking of
it.  When all was said and done though, the firefight was exciting.  If I had
a more experienced RPGing group that picked up rules more easily, and the
chargen system didn\'t take 20 - 45 min, I would have liked the system alot
more.

I\'ve never actually played with CT or MT.

I\'m perfectly honest about it.  I\'m not a Christian, and I won\'t use it,
and given that we live in a world with many religions and a nation with
full religious freedom I see no reason to use it.

Only if you see Christianity as being somehow central to western
civilization. Sure, it once was, but in practice, most folks are agnostics
who (at best) go to church for social reasons.  Except for fundies and
Catholics (both fairly small minorities) the US isn\'t terribly religious
and most of Western Europe is even less.  I don\'t have any problem with
"Christian values" going belly up, and don\'t see that it\'s been hurting
our civilization any that they mostly have been.  I think intolerance, the
oppression of women, prejudice against non-Christian religions, and
similar "convictions" are things we can safely do without.  I don\'t want 
anyone to have the "intestinal fortitude" to proclaim *those* convictions.

That might have been the *stated* purpose, but that\'s not the way it *felt*
to me...or the way most players I encountered *played*
Starvikings.  The RCES weren\'t shining knights bringing civilization to the
poor and downtrodden, except in their propaganda and maybe their own minds. 
They *were* Reavers, looters, who benefited from what they "removed" from
the wilds.

>>I was sad to see Traveller become a game of US imperialism in space.

Now, *that\'s* sad!  The US might or might not engage in economic
imperialism (and that might or might not be good), but I know the US and
we\'re no RCES.

You know, I liked TNE\'s rules (as much as I like *any* rules ;-), but not
the RC setting.  That setting just didn\'t hit me as uplifting, pulling
worlds out of the darkness.  It *felt* cold and vicious to me. It didn\'t
*have* to be that way, but that\'s the way it felt.

I should have Inserted a "modern western" before world.  I apologize to any
who will listen. I sentence myself to 1001 lashings (or emails from David
Reed, take your pick).
  I\'m really not as arrogant (religiously or politically) as some of my flames
may indicate.  I believe in tolerance and not the torture and persecution that
those less tolerant in the history of the Church have brought.  My convictions
are strong and I believe that if you worship God, it doesn\'t necessarily
matter how.  I choose to follow the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church and
the Bible but respect the rights of those to believe otherwise.  Allah and
YHWH and Jesus are the same God IMHO and I revere Him.  I can say "Allah
Ackbar."  It is not in my custom to bow towards Mecca.  Most of the myriad
forms of religion (especially the "Great Three."  Christianity, Islam and
Judaism) i believe are all valid.  Of course, i believe mine is "more" right,
but... ; )
   Anyone who wants to further differentiate is welcome to engage me in a
religious debate.  
   Please excuse this completely non-Trav statement. I felt I needed to
explain myself. 

Happy Travelling

Read any book about 18th Century naval warfare and you\'ll have your answer.
The system will be a tad more high-tech than a book wrapped in lead so 
that it is guaranteed to sink when thrown overboard, but the principle
will be the same. In the event of imminent capture the senior surviving
officer will make sure that the codes are destroyed.

Here\'s a library data entry I made up some years ago about that subject:

LAST WILL:  Colloquial  naval  name for a special closed data-pack
used to keep secret orders,  passwords,  call-codes, astrogational 
data  about  the  location  of  fuel  dumps and other hidden naval 
sites,  and  any  other classified information.  Such data are not 
supposed  to  be  copied  in  the  ship\'s  regular data banks, nor
memorized.  The LW is carried by the captain of a ship so that the 
successor  can get them if the captain is killed or incapacitated.  
In the event of imminent capture or destruction of the ship, it is 
the specific duty of the senior surviving officer, and the general 
duty of any surviving officer or crew member, to ensure that these 
data  are erased.  Apart from other controls a LW is equipped with 
two  prominent  buttons:  an \'erase\' button and a \'retain\' button. 
Pressing the erase button will erase all data bit by bit. Pressing 
the  retain  button will reset a 12-hour timer.  Should the retain 
button  not  be pressed again before the timer runs out,  the data 
will be erased. 


I posted it some months ago and it was suggested that such a dingus would
also include a small explosive charge to physically destroy the storage
medium. I myself am satisfied by haviing the device erase the data bit by
bit (That means accessing every single byte and randomizing it, not just
fiddling around with access tables.), but YMMV.

I have always used the same table for both cargo _and_ freight and only
rolled once.  I am using the simplifying assumption that the goods being
offered for sale as cargo and for shipment as freight are the
_exact_same_items.  The NPC owners of these items are perfectly happy to
either pay you Cr 1,000 a ton to ship them or to sell them to you, for
the market price determined by the table, & let you do whatever you with
with them.  As I see it the table is a table of "what can I find here
this week ?" and not a table of freight or cargo.

If you do it this way you save having to roll things up twice, place
market constraints of both freight & cargo, and have an excuse to reuse
the same NPC\'s wheteher they are dealing in freight or cargo.  I think
these are all good things & thats why I do it this way.

Ah, religious bigotry, how unsurprising.  Folks like you give Christianity

For you perhaps.  How about for everyone else (ie the majority of the
world which doesn\'t follow your faith).  As the CE/BCE is it merely a
dating system with an arbitrary (and irrelevant to most of the world) zero
point.  As AD/BC it is a Christian dating system.  I can\'t say I\'m in
favor of this idea.

For a simple answer figure out how much the ship is worth now. A useful
rule of thumb is new price divided by number of decades the ship is old
(or divided by wear value if you use that). Something like 25% of new
price for a 40 year old ship. Of course, you can decide that the ship
is worth more or less because it is unusually well/unusualy badly
maintained.

Once you decided on the value of the ship you can decide on a reasonable
rate of return. Banks get 6.25% pa. in 12 monthly installments, so that
might be thought reasonable. I forget just how much a Free Trader costs
in T4. Something like 60-65 MCr? That would give your wealthy player
something like 80,000 Credits per month, which is a tidy sum. Always
provided the captain who leases the ship don\'t default on his payments
or decides to skip ;-).

I believe it is defined. The ship needs to be armed (to defend the mail
from would-be pirates) and you have to set aside 5 T of space as a
special area for storing the mail. IIRC you\'re not allowed use the space
for other purpose, but OTOH you get paid the Cr25,000 regardless of the
actual amount of mail (up to 5 T).

You don\'t even have to invoke the saving in time (though that is an added
incentiv). I\'ve worked out some (IMO) realistic rates for tickets and
freight rates for various jumps, and it turns out that jump-3 and jump-4
is the cheapest way to ship freight long distance (always provided the
ship isn\'t forced by astrography to jump short too often). Here\'s what I
worked out:



REGULAR PASSENGER LINER OR FREIGHTER TRAVELLING FROM SURFACE TO SURFACE (35
jumps per year):
             
           Steerage    Low    Economy    Mid     High    1 dT of  1 dT per
           Passage   Passage  Passage  Passage  Passage  freight   parsec*
Jump-1:     1,200     1,400    2,800    4,800    6,200      840      840
Jump-2:     1,500     1,800    3,800    6,600    8,400    1,170      585
Jump-3:     2,100     2,200    5,100    9,000   11,400    1,660      555
Jump-4:                                13,400             2,400      600
Jump-5:                                19,800             3,660      735
Jump-6:                                35,000             6,370    1,065

(The blank spots in the table I haven\'t take the time to calculate yet).

*Assuming the route is an exact multiple of the jump rating.

Note 1: The prices above was arrived at by designing a number of 600 T ships
each dedicated to one kind of passengers, ie. a ship with 1 T of cargo space
per passenger and 1 steward per 8 passengers for High Passengers, another
ship with negligible cargo space and 1 steward per 50 passengers for Mid
Passengers, a ship with small staterooms for Economy Passengers, a ship with
Low Berths and 1 medic per 20 berths for Low Passengers, and a ship with bunks
only for Steerage Passengers, plus a ship with cargo hold only for freight. 
In all cases, except the ships for Steerage passengers, the design included
emergency medical low berths enough to accomodate a full complement of crew
and passengers.

Also note that I based my calculations on life support costs a lot lower than
the official ones (roughly 1/4th). I then introduced a "misjump insurance" to
partly compensate for the reduction in expenses caused by my lowering of the
life support costs. It didn\'t quite compensate, so ticket prices are a tad
lower than they would be with the official rules. But with only the crew\'s
life support to account for in a freighter, the misjump insurance makes
freight rates higher than they would be with the official rules. However, I
think the costs would be proportionate to the figures I got.

Larger ships will reduce the costs further, but only if the worlds it serve
can supply enough passengers/freight to keep the ship filled an average of
90% on each trip.

About here you need more description of its morphology; how big is it?
what\'s its symmetry? (bilateral, I assume); how many limbs? what kind?
(long, short, number of joints, claws, etc.); stance & movement (crawling,
hopping; walking, etc); thermal regulation? (probably endothermic, i.e.
warm-blooded); what kind of structural support? (sounds like an
exoskeleton, or an endoskeleton with a chitinous carapace); does it have a
head, neck, etc?; major sensory organs (how many eyes, etc); placement of
mouth(s), teeth, etc...

I think the cave walls would have to be rather wet and smooth for suction
cups to work. But maybe the Roran\'s home planet is indeed riddled with very
smooth-walled, damp caves...

Sounds a bit like a cockroach or beetle: the shell probably opens to
release the wings, and closes to shields the wings when the Roran is
underground, or fighting.

The quills drop off at puberty? Too bad; I rather like the image of a
large, flying, carnivorous pack-hunting beetle covered in nasty porcupine
quills! Ungainly, perhaps...

Lovely. Flying carnivorous dung beetles.

>Picture the adult Roran has a sea tortoise.

Aha. That\'s much clearer. Doesn\'t sound much like something built to fly,
though. But if it\'s small, and evolved on a low-gravity world, who can say?

I rather wonder if the spines _and_ shell aren\'t redundant? Spines _or_
shell, I think: if you have one, you don\'t need the other.

>The Traveller characteristics for the adult Roran follow.
>
>Qty Animal Weight Hits Armor Wounds and Weapons

That\'s a good-sized flying tortoise. (Not as big as Gamera, though :) I
wonder how big its wings are? I take it the wings would be sort of
bat-like? In any case, they\'re extra limbs that don\'t emerge from under the
shell until after puberty.

My image of the adult Roran is roughly similar to a clawed tortoise with a
soft shell bisected down the middle. When it flies, its shell opens like
the gullwing doors on a DeLorean, releasing the batlike wings, about 2m in
span(?). The neck can extend quite a bit, to facilitate biting attacks, or
retract under the shell for protection.

I think the Roran would have to eat a _lot_, if it\'s going to have the
energy to fly. Your PC may need to blow his whole paycheque on huge sacks
of RoranChow...

All in all, a pretty cool ship\'s mascot.

If you can housetrain the thing, that is.

Is there any chance that you could be persuaded to change the rules for
freight and passenger rates? The one flat rate for each type of transport
could be explained by government fiat, but not if the flat rates don\'t
allow a ship to earn enough to pay its expenses. That is, if there is a
rate for jump-1 and jump-6 High Passage, then the rate must allow a ship
to break even on the jump-6 passage (and make a KILLING on jump-1
passages). Otherwise there will be no jump-6 passenger liners (I know
there may not be any jump-6 passenger ships in the Imperium, but if so
the rules should make that clear, and at the very least there have been
several mentions of jump-4 passenger liners. And believe me, regardless
of what life support costs you use, there\'s no way a jump-4 passenger
liner is going to break even with Cr10,000 per cabin...

Furthermore the only way you can justify flat rates is by some sort of fiat
be it government of a cosy agreement between corporations (or so it seems to
me), and shouldn\'t the rules allow the referee to use a different setting?
Would such a fiat be identical or even exist in every interstellar state?
Would it exist outside interstellar states at all? Surely not.

Also, is there some reason why life support costs are so high? They seem
incompatible with the rules for basic living expenses and also at odds with
various rules for outfitting private ships mentioned here and there.

I know this was talked about (and fought over) months ago, I just saw
Starship Troopers (it only got here last Thursday).

I can see why some people thought it was great, and why a lot of people
didn\'t like it.

Cons: 
It was NOTHING like the book (though they hardly mentioned the book here).
The Navy were very slow learners, even for Navy.
The MI were too close together, fools.
They said all sorts of bad things about Military Intelligence.

Pros:
Lots of cool violence.
The Bugs were very, very cool (how do ya think they\'ll go in AD&D - that\'ll
teach \'em not to let me run Traveller - Heh Heh).
The news flashes and recruitment speils were such good takeoffs of
WWII/Korean War stuff.
Their Nazi uniforms (Afrika Korps?) were just wonderful.
The starships did look Travelleresque - like Valors or Coalition Clippers.

I took the advice of a friend and left my brain at the door, and
consequently had a great time.

If I had to choose an army to be in based on casualty rates I think I\'d go
with the WWII German Army, as they lost rather less men than those they
faced, under some pretty bad odds.

Yeah well, IMHO the 3I shows little real military competence from about the
Julian Wars onwards, but a great ability to get its own citizens killed.
Not to mention a lack of long term planning - they let the Julian
Protecorate stay independant and thus closed off a frontier, and then
ignored the Solomani so long that they had to let in on near even terms,
then alienated them - shutting off another frontier. Given lack of drive
and distance to the only frontier (the Spinward-Rinward corner of the SM)
the collapse of the 3I was then just a matter of time. If it hadn\'t ripped
itself up it would have stagnated and been eaten up by the Solomani, or the
K\'Kree, or BEMs from The Core, or ...

Come to NZ, where our military budget is under 2% of the GDP, and dropping
(in real terms). Our army got its first SAMs a few months back, probably to
divert people from the army\'s statements that it had to ask the Brits and
Canadians for protection whilst on peacekeeping in Bosnia. The only reason
people don\'t contsantly look down on the armed forces is because they
forget we even have one.

Even the Territorial Forces here have our sense of tradition and history,
and all our armed forces have a proud history of honour, etc.

All of us have differing beliefs (I doubt you\'d get the same answers from
two people who nominally profess the same religion or politics), but the
TML is not the place to discuss these as (1) they\'re off topic, (2) once
the lines are drawn the positions rarely change and (3) it just isn\'t
constructive.

I agree. Hard Times is (IMO) the best MT supplement. One of the reasons
TNE\'s Virus hurt so much was seeing all those pocket empires starting to
rebuild in Hard Times and then realising that Virus just snuffed them out.

I\'d rate Arrival Vengeance as one of the best scenarios for the way it
showcased the devastation in the Imperium (not sure how playable it is
though). The meeting with Strephon is done superbly. Survival Margin is the
other great supplement (especially as a MT background book).

The confusion between freight and cargo is one of the big flaws in T4\'s
rulebook. I ended up going back to the MT tables to handle this.

cargo - speculative
freight - boxes for 1000 Cr/dt

One thing I\'d like to see is a slightly higher life support charge for High
Passage (not a lot, say 250Cr) to represent the costs of
food/service/consumables...

I think that was part of the purpose. You weren\'t suppose to like the RC
politics, or ways of behaving. It was a way of showing that it is a harse
world out there and to survive you had to play rough. Either the players
learnt that and played along with the RC or they stayed to their ideals
and fought the RC any way they could.

I actually think that RC is more like british colonialisme than US
imperialisme.

Just wondering. Why does a setting have to be uplifting, pulling worlds
out of the darkness? I think that the RC setting was great because it gave
the players a different enemy, their own government (if you as a GM played
on it) when they saw the way the RC tended to act. Great setting for
political drama IMHO.

well defined; sort of a utiltarian generic terrorist group. Well what does
canon have to say about the Ine Givar? (especially since they are likely to
become important again in GURPS:T).

Well we know that they are a large well organised militant anti-Imperial
group operating in the Spinward Marches around 1100 Imperial, financed by
the Zhodani and the Sword Worlds. Adventure 7 Broadsword tells us that they
existed in 1083 when they tried to recruit the Tanoose Freedom League into
their organisation. This implies that there are actually a number of distinct
subgroups within the Ine Givar. There is a TNS entry from the Rebellion era
in Challenge 58 (101-1123) which mentions an attempt by Norris to reach a
settlement with the Ine Givar, and the Ine Givar\'s rejection of the overtures.
Another entry in Challenge 60 (154-1124) mentions a pro-Ine Givar student
demonstration. This gives their motto as "Agitate, Educate, Organise" (this
is in it self very reveiling). This entry also has them handing out leaflets
reading "The moment for democracy is now" (also quite reveiling) and says they
have green armbands. So I\'ll try to build a movement from this very slender
information.

Overview: The Ine Givar are an early expresion of the tensions that were
building in the latter years of the 3rd Imperium (which would ultimately
lead to Dulinor\'s assassination of Strephon, the Rebellion, and then to
Norris\'s democratic reforms in the regency). However they were before their
time and got frustrated at attempts at peaceful reform and turned to
violence.

History: Ine Givar was born on Rhylanor in 948. His parents were minor noble
"placekeepers" of the type which became increasingly common in the latter
Imperium. As he grew up, he travelled with his parents on many of the "fact
finding" make work missions that were the lot of a minor noble. During these
missions he became aware of the many oppressive and corrupt regimes that the
Imperium turned a blind eye to. These early travels were to have a profound
influence on him, leaving him deeply dissolusioned with the Imperium.

He enrolled in the University of Rhylanor in 966, studing political science.
A very talented student, at first he excelled at his studies, gaining his
bachelors degree with first class honors in 970. However he had increasingly
become involved in politics during this time, gradually building up a group
of dedicated followers. He gained his Masters with honors in 968 and his
doctorate in 974. However rather than move into a comfortable job in the
bureacracy, he choose to devote his life to agitating for peaceful democratic
changes to the "corrupt Imperial system". This rapidly gained him much
official disfavour, but did not prevent him from building up a subsector wide
following. With the comming of the Third Frontier War he was detained as a
"threat to security" in 980 and died in custody in 984. Normally, other than
a few minor protests, this would have been the end of the matter. However,
the authorities had not taken his lover, Kisla Famia, into account. Born into
the lower classes of Rhylanor, her great-grandparents and grandparents had
been executed during the psionic suppressions and she bore an almost
fanatical hatred of the Imperium. She also had an enormous talent for media
manipulation. With the end of the war and her own release in 987 she launched
a massive media campaign to "uncover the truth about Ine Givar\'s death".
Eventually this bore fruit and in 990 an offical inquiry was conveined. Over
the course of the inquiry, the evidence mounted that Givar had been subjected
to systematic brutalisation and torture. Naturally his supported expected
that those responsible would be brought to justice. However when the inquiry
finally delivered its finding in 992, it reported that Givar\'s death was a
"regretable accident caused by his failure to cooperate fully with his
jailors".

In late 992, his supporters organised a mass rally outside the Rhylanor Naval
base (where Givar had been imprisoned) to demand those responsible be called
to task. It is uncertain just what happened, but during the demonstration a
detachment of Imperial Marines opened fire on the crowd. In the resulting
chaos and panic at least 700 demonstrators were killed.

From Kisla Famia\'s declaration after the Rhylanor massacre:
"The Empire speaks of honor; where was their honor when they murdered
Ine, where was their honor when they let his killers go free to ply their
vile trade, where was their honor when they slaughered these innocents?
Where is their honor when they allow despots and tyrants kill and torture
and maim their citizens? They have no honor!"
"Ine believed in democracy, Ine also believed that democracy could be
achieved by peace and negotiation. They do not want peace, they do not want
democracy, they want only power and blood. If they want blood, I say let them
have blood! They tell us that the path to democracy is through patience and
negotiation; they tell us now is not the right moment. I say the time for
negotiation is over, the moment for democracy is now!"

From this point on, the Ine Givar movement abandoned peaceful change and
moved to terrorism to achieve their aims. Their first action was the dramatic
bombing of the Imperial Naval Intelligence headquarters on Rhylanor. Typical
of the bold audacious actions that became their trademark under Famia\'s
leadership. Within five years there were Ine Givar cells on most worlds
within the Domain of Deneb, within sixteen they had become the dominant
anti-Imperial movement in the Domain, and had cells extending as far as
Capital itself. The movements early highwater mark came in 1020 when Famia
masterminded an assassination attempt on the entire Imperial family. The
attempt failed, but it did leave Emperor Paulo\'s younger brother Elmor dead.

Around 1035, a shift occured in the movement\'s leadership. Famia was by now
96 years old and her health was failing. She stepped down and Ine Givar\'s
son Natise took over the movements leadership. Natise Givar had both his
father\'s charisma and his mother\'s tactical and adminstrative abilities. He
also nursed a lasting hatred over his father\'s death. Under his leadership,
the movement grew in both strength and efficency. Natise planned for the
long term, contacts were made with the Zhodani and Sword Worlds; and their
support was gained. Other terrorist groups were absorbed or eliminated and
the organisations targets came to include the megacorporations which
supported the Imperium.

In 1067 a leadership coup replaced Natise with Votan Gamiilash, one of the
movements "young turks". Under Gamiilash the movement abandoned most of its
activities beyond Corridor sector, concentrating almost exclusivly on the
domain of Deneb. Gamiilash also changed the movements focus; under her
leadership it became far more tied and dependent on Zhodani and Sword Worlds
support. It was under Gamiilash that the movement struck its first purely
civilian target. In 1075, Ine Givar operatives smuggled a fusion warhead
into the city of Kashar on Zivije. The resulting blast caused over 5,000,000
casulties (including 2,800,000 dead). It was as a result of this atrocity
that the Zhodani instigated an bloody coup in the movement and replaced
Gamiilash with a committee headed by Wardn Sortin in 1077.

This committee structure was to dominate the movement\'s leadership for the
next 40 years. Under the committee, the Ine Givar became little more than
an extension of the Zhodani and Sword Worlds intelligence services. The
Ine Givar were a major factor in the Fourth Frontier War. Ine Givar guerillas
tied up many Imperial troops which could have been better employed at the
front and provided invaluable intelligence to the Outworld Coalition. It was
Ine Givar agents who discovered that Imperial Naval Intelligence had
compromised the Zhodani\'s deep space base between Yres and Menorb and lead
to the Battle of Two Suns (however it did not prevent the Coalition from
lossing the battle).

After the Fourth Frontier War, the Ine Givar curtailed their activities
and rebuilt their strength for the next war. They continued to stike at
Imperial targets and fostered unrest on a number of worlds. As the Fifth
Frontier War drew nearer, their activities increased. Guerilla cadres were
established and on Efate and Ruie they moved to almost open warfare. With
the outbreak of the Fifth Frontier War in 1107, the Ine Givar sprung into
action. The carefully groomed Guerilla cadres tied down many Imperial troops
in the openning stages and provided bridgeheads on a number of worlds.
However the war was to prove to be a major setback for the movement. As the
Coalition campaign faultered, the Ine Givar cadres were left stranded and
destroyed. Much of the movement\'s strength was lost in the latter stages
of the war. The movement felt deeply betrayed by the Zhodani; and in 1114
Rojel Nuguma seized control of the movement. He greatly reduced the movement\'s
ties to the Zhodani and Sword Worlds and set about rebuilding and replacing
the lost cells. However, the movement had nearly been destroyed in the
Fifth Frontier War and it took a long time to recover. It was not until the
mid 1120\'s that the movement began to resume activities.

It\'s late now. I\'ll try to finish this tommorrow.

I\'ve recently updated the FF&S2 errata list.  This update include changing
the Damage value equations for Lasers, PAWs and Meson guns.  Lasers are

DV=3.6(I^.5), PAWs are being changed from DV=5*DM*(I^.5) to DV=7.1*DM*(I^.5)
and Meson guns from DV=5*(I^.5) to DV=7.1*(I^.5).  Damage for these weapons

overlooked (this was mentioned on TravTech list and confirmed by Guy.

My point is that *no* 2-d representation works all that well. The
closest is the paired XY/XZ maps like Battlefleet Mars used for combat.
But even they have their problems. 

So until we have a cheap, 3d display, we\'ll have to live with 2-D maps.

Ahem.

Acoording to the misjump rules in the Traveller book. A misjump can
take up to 6 weeks. Again, regardless of distance travelled. :-)

It\'s like this, under the "jump takes 1 week"  rule, if I do something
and then jump out of system, then *even if you know where I\'m jumping
to*, you *can\'t* get there first. 

With your version, you can, if you have a ship with a higher jump
number. This gets important for such things as warning of attacks, and
intercepting couriers bearing news that you don\'t wish spread about.

In short, your rule makes it possible to "overtake" a ship. Which has
serious consequences.

I suggest that you consider the arrangement many people who
own barges, rail-road cars, trailers or other similar trading and cargo
carriers utilize. They arrange with a reputable service or agency
to lease out the units (trailers, barges etc) to various operators in
exchange for insurance premiums paid, operating and maintenance
expenses and a share of the profits. This generates a fair monthly
income based upon the route or area the unit is assigned to as well
as giving the owner the freedom to do as they please.

A similar situation applies with ocean going vessels only it tends more
to be a syndicate style arrangement versus simples lease/operator
 realtionship. Also, the share of the profits is a bit more equal.

If you check the phone book in most coastal cities you\'ll find a variety of
these kinds of businesses.

It would all depend on the reputation and reliability of the operator. It
would
probably make a good campaign twist for the PC to regularly get his or
her check but also various complaints and problems for them to deal with
at a remove.

Hope this helps.

During WWII the merchant marine played a significant and interesting role
in keeping the flow of supplies moving.  Also "Air-America" in Cambodia
during the Vietnam War.  These could be an interesting source of
non-military activity for players.

Other wartime scenarios for civilians could include:
Gathering intelligence for one or both sides,
Running contraband in or out of areas,
Political involvement,
Bodyguards or Secret Service for diplomats,
Rescuing prisoners of war which the government deny even exist,
etc.

2D Hexmaps (as used in Traveller) aren\'t very realistic; I am not
particulary well inclined to them, so I decided to make use of 3D
sectors.

This is a general outline of the 3D sector I had in mind.
It is an isometric cube that uses a cartesian coordinate
system, where every coordinate is one parsec. The stepping
should be about 0.1 parsec.

Despite being not much larger (x and y) than a Traveller
Subsector, a 3D sector houses more systems.

In our region of the galaxy, there is about one star system
every 12.5 to 23.8 cubic parsec with an average of about one
system every 17.29 cubic parsec. For sector cube with 10 parsec
on each side that means the number of systems ranges from about
42 to 80, with an average of 58 (I think Traveller has something
between 20 to 40 systems per Subsector).

Now my question:

Has anyone any experience with this kind of sector mapping? The
calculations aren\'t too difficult, but I am interested in whether
it is possible to bring a 3D isometric shape to paper in printable
(and more important, readable) form.

That question especially goes to deadeye (if I got it right, you are
working on something similar, too)

Yes, Ok, I _was_ lurking. Go and sue me ;-))

   Political Correctness is not something that just popped up one day
several years ago and said \'boo\'!  It started in the 1960s and gradually
spread through American academia (sort of like cancer) until finally coming
to public attention in the late 1980s.

>Lighten the $%# up dudes!

   It\'s one thing to point out how absurd PC (and I don\'t mean \'player
character\') is, and to object to the use of BCE/CE as "intellectual
wallpaper", but when virtual holy wars start to flare up, it is most
certainly time to lighten the $%# up dudes.  Discussions of "real world"
religion beliefs only have a place here if they can be done so in a
dispassionate fashion--if you can\'t, don\'t.

   Gary: Life in Rome outside of the neighborhoods occupied by the wealthy

   What survived in Byzantium was more Greek than Latin.  In fact it would
be fair to say that Byzantium was *Greek* civilization (certainly modern
Greeks seem to think so), with Roman titles and some Latin thrown in for flavor.

   The massive debt we owe Byzantium in the West (and to a certain extent
the Arabs and Turks) stems from the fact that it did preserve many bits and
pieces of our Latin roots that would have otherwise been lost.  These bits
and pieces *heavily* influenced the Renaissance and later Scientific Revolution.

   ObTrav: I see the states of the Solomani Rim (Dingir League, Old Earth
Union, Vegan Polity, Easter Concord) more or less serving the same purpose
for the Third Imperium that Byantium did for the West.  Those states would
have preserved at least some portion of the culture of the Second Imperium,
and contact with those states would have greatly influenced the 3I in its
development.

I\'d modify that only by taking off the \'retain\' button, and by making the

This is a distinction I have been trying to make, and helps the players\'

Well, just let me put it like I see it:  There\'s always two (or sometimes
more) sides to a moral dilemna, both are nasty, but one is nasty to someone
else, the other is nasty to you.  That\'s what makes moral dilemnas all the
more interesting to run.  Inescapable traps are one thing, they\'re not usually
moral dilemnas though.

What I mean by building a way out is cheating is that, if you put such a
dilemna into the plot, and you make a third option that is less nasty then the
original two, then its not a moral dilemna anymore, and it fails to bring an
emotional response.  The way out has to be built in intrinsically.  The party
does the nasty thing, and survives to live another day, their morality
comprised.  The party doesn\'t do the nasty thing, and somehow they are either
able to fight their way out and become fugitives, or are somehow, instead
imprisoned in an escapable way.  If this is what was meant by the original
post, I apologize.

An example would be:  The PCs are hired as mercenary advisors to help clear a
world of hostiles.  The hostiles turn out to be a lower tech minor race that
happens to stand in the way of a colonization project, and further happen to
build sprawling monasteries in the areas of rich lanthanum deposits.  Once
they get to the world, and find out the truth, the PCs could either do their
job, and help quell the \'hostiles\' with all kinds of high tech goodies, and
then pull out when the transports come...  and live with it on their
conscience, or side with the hostiles and advise them in their raids, staying
with them until they die, lose, or can somehow eventually arrange off world
transport.  There could be a third option, hopping off world before they have
to do either.

I think Imperial doctrine is to put production into jump capable warships
in the theory that 5 mobile (jump capable) BBs are better than 10 immobile
ones.  I can see an occasional exception to this (Is the "base" at a Depot
a Monitor?).

[snip the list]

Nice list, missing;

Q-Ship (Disguised merchant)
Tanker
Resupply Ship

Azhanti High Lightning class Frontier Cruiser was originally (or at some
point, the memory fails) designated as a "Fleet Intruder" which meaning is
not particularly clear, but seems to be a heavily armed fast vessel.

I always thouth the AHL design would make a great commerce raider; able to
jump behind enemy lines, raise hell, and get out before major forces could
be brought to bear.  Kind of the Kneisnau and Sharnhorst of its time.

If you are modelling on WWII tactics (which many seem to be doing);

Minesweeper
Minelayer

This is very debatable; Mines are layed (lain?) only in places which need
to be denied to the enemy.  Space is so big, its quite debatable whether
minefields can be placed effectively at all.

You have "Scout/Courier" but Fighting Ships (CT) had a "Fleet Courier" that
should be included.

Personally, I might add a "Scout Cruiser" used for reconnoitering in
\'force\'.  It would have the surface area for a truly good-sized passive
array and perhaps a few fighter sized recon boats.  It would also have
serious ECM and ECCM suites.

I would also deemphasize the role of fighters (unlike many other posters to
this thread).  Fighters under the T4 combat rules (and under TNE, and MT)
are so fragile that they are attrited very quickly in combat.  I expect
that the larger vessels are more valuable in a credit/firepower analysis
and in terms of whats left after the battle is over.

Fighters (gunboats) would be useful against raiders and pirates (where the
volume of fire is not so intense), so the escort role is significant, and
fighters would be good in the ground support/COACC role, which means big
carriers exist, but are not used vs. other ships, but against ground and
air targets.  Fighters are also valuable as sensor platforms.  Does anyone
besides me believe in "towed" passive arrays?

Remember that most of the vessels belonging to the Navy you will encounter
will be non-combatants; resupply, tanker, yard auxiliaries on debris
patrol, etc.  These ships are armed (all ships in Traveller seem to be
armed) but probably not armored or prepared for real combat.

Well, probably the easiest way to do this (but not very easy to read
afterwards) is to simply flatten the map, and put a digit indicating height
from the base plane next to each system. This causes a number of problems
however, since stars can be placed on top of each other.

I think a better way to do it would be to print the base plane from a
perspective, and indicate height of the systems with lines. This would look
like a piece of the roof, with systems hanging in pieces of string from the
roof. You would probably want to print the exact coordinates next to each
system.

Sounds like you may be generating some severe headaches for the PC, not a
bad thing, and for yourself, not a good thing.  Most investors in such a
proprosal do not expect monthly returns anyway...  If monthly income is the
desired return format for this portfolio, consider leasing the ship to a
major freight line as part of their fleet, or an individual/small company
willing to lease it for strictly milk runs along a designated route (limits
your profitability unless you develop consistent, volume customers).

Unless the PC wants to hire a person/firm to manage the ship individually or
lease it out, the best thing to do in the long run would be to sell it.  If
it\'s not a desired possession, I wonder how it came to be owned by that PC
(besides the roll on the table said so)...

Another option is to revamp it into a luxury ship (we\'re supposed to be
wealthy after all).

Let me know how you work it into the story...

creating something that wasn\'t "Americans in space" or anyone else in
particular.  

>I just hated the death of the universe I loved.

   So did I, but as they say, when your lemon gets crushed, don\'t pout, make
lemonade.

>To quote Charlton Heston:

   Or as I have said in the past: ...and God smote the evil doers and their
brethern and great numbers of their neighbors in righteous indignity because
they had took what he had given them for granted.  And there was great
lamenting and moaning and gnashing of teeth, and God said "those of you who
survive shall build a great civilization, one greater than that which came
before."  Thus the survivors began the task that God set out before them,
praising Him who gave them life.  And they were fruitful and multiplied and
smote God\'s enemies as they created their new land.  And God smiled upon
them and their descendents and they indeed built a great civilization...

   It\'s biblical (Old Testament) stuff man, and after all Chuck has played
Moses *and* God.

The way I understand you, you seem ironic in this statement. Please tell me
I have misunderstood you. I have never (and I am pretty sure I never will)
sympathise with what happened during the crusade and colonization eras.

I also wish to say that I am not against religion in any way. I am not
myself religious, but I have friends who are (both Christian and
otherwise). One of the worst things you can do to a person (besides
violence of all kinds) is to force a system of belief on someone who does
not want it. I choose not to be religious of my own, free will. Many people
choose to believe of _their_ own free will. I have nothing to do with what
they choose.

That surely depends on what you mean with "western world". A clear minority
(well under 20%, I am pretty sure it\'s lower than 10% as well) are
Christians where I live (in Sweden). The country is nominally Christian,
but that does not change the beliefs of the people here. True, marriages
and such are mostly conducted in Christian churches.

Yes, at least for the people over in western Europe. Byzantium was pretty
much isolated, and was more a part of the Arabic part of the world than
anything else.

Rome truly brought knowledge and civilization to many people, but they did
it by force. Many things got better, but many things also got worse (from
the conquered people\'s point of view).

(the following is a special delivery to Phil MacGregor and should be
considered parody, sacasm, and in good fun).

"Federal Government Tells us \'Don\'t Pay Your Taxes\'!

The Federal government today announced that all taxes are not to be paid
due to a few trillion found between the couch cusions.

One citizen, Phillip MacGregor, was skeptical, "Maybe they got so many
threats of bombing federal buildings they *had* to refuse our money." he is
quoted as saying.

"This isn\'t policies improving, maybe this is their way of saying that they
won\'t be putting out our fires or policing our streets anymore.  I just
don\'t trust them."  He said.

When it was pointed out that Federal Taxes is exactly what Philip had been
complaining about all these years he was unmoved. "Just because I said that
was what I want doesn\'t mean I\'m not going to complain when I get it."

(end special delivery)

Perhaps, Philip, instead of putting forth unfounded rumors you would
respond to some of Marc Miller\'s solicitations for suggestions as he feeds
us T4.1 piece by piece for our commentary and revision.  Not that you\'ll be
happy if he writes it exactly to your instructions either.

	I can agree with that, just ask the British in Northern Africa what
the Germans did.  The Germans were way outgunned, and outmanned, not to
mention being forsaken by their Leader, and still managed to hold on in one
the the greatest, yet often overlooked battles in WWII.  By the time the
Germans finally fell, the British losses were astronomical, not necessarily
a victory if you ask me.

I have an idea.

Why not use a piece of your roof? Attach pieces of string to it. At the
other end of the string, attach a small ball of some kind of material
(perhaps with a number on it, for data lookup). These balls could be
coloured according to alliance etc.

This idea would probably not work for campaign played in large regions of
space, but it would work for smaller campaigns.

What do you think ?

Very wise of you to note.  Yes, it is.  It\'s called hajj.  No, I haven\'t.
Your point?  The other four are: sawm, zakat, shahada, and the Day of
Judgement (not necessarily in that order).  See ya\' then.


ObTrav: what holy places have y\'all established in your campaigns for
various religions (besides jumpspace for the Brethren)?  There are many more
details that are involved in pilgramaging from one world to another than
surface travel...  I noticed that M:0 had some adventure seeds that included
carrying pilgrims as passengers.  Have any of y\'all used these?  Have any
characters felt the need to make some kind of pilgrimage (the eternal quest
for battle dress doesn\'t count).

Did anyone ever ask these people if they wanted to be saved?  Seems to me
that stripping a world of it\'s leadership, useful artifacts, and hauling
away what little they have for auction isn\'t very nice.

I followed orders because I had sworn to obey the orders of officers, and
the Non-Commissioned Offciers placed over me.  Nobody bothered to explain
*why* we had an alert, just get out of the rack and MOVE!

Now that\'s just interesting.  I am best described as an agnostic.  I have
been shot at, and have lived with Hodgkin\'s Disease for two and a half
years.  I feel no need to cozy up to an established religion for comfort.
When I die, if I am judged, the Universe will have to accept me for what I
was and did.

My father was a British subject, my mother very anti-military, and we
reinvented non-religious.  Yet I enlisted the moment I could get them to
sign the paperwork.  Why?  Can you name another job that lets you fire
machine-guns, travel around the world, and get laid a lot?

I\'m very familar with the "Russian Vietnam."   Are YOU aware that the
mujahideen were being slaughterd without respite until the CIA supplied
FIM-92 Stingers to the Afghanis at taught them how to use them?  Without
air support, the Soviets only dared the mountains in Battalion-sized
armored formations, which the fighters saw coming for miles.

Considering that was a *relgious* war, it\'s a slightly different situation.
 But for every knoght of Christendom, there were a dozen mercenaries and
levies, fightening for gold or their liege.

It\'s accepted etiquette in my circles to feed the GM.  More often than not,
this consists of a hefty contribution to the pizzia fund, and bringing a

Note:  I said "during wartime."

Endless sessions of "Captain, join up with Task Force 473475, and engage
the enemy at Gram.  Or "Major, your company will lead the drop."

People in command don\'t get out much.  Playing a combat peon, on the other
hand, means taking orders from everybody!

I\'ve considered doing a "troupe" style game using the Coronation, with
everyone having several characters in different departments and ranks.

I am trying to determine population figures for Safari World.

A Shrieker couple will usually have 2-4 offspring who survive 
(of 10-20 eggs) to adulthood, and are hatched over a period of 
10 to 20 years.  Adults live about 44 years, after which 92% die.

The remaining ones, called elders, live on for about 200 more
years, after which they die abruptly.

Now what kind of population distribution do we have here?
If we had a city of these beasties, how many of each would
live there?

I ran a sample script and came up with these percentages:

Youths		Adults		Elders
982		2400		93
1071		3000		111
1879		4004		154
2175		4200		157
4239		7506		265
4129		10300		387
4650		10871		370

28%		69%		3%
26%		71%		3%
31%		67%		2%

35%		62%		2%
27%		69%		2.5%
29%		68%		2%
- ----
29%		67%		2%

So the distribution will be approximately

Youth: 30%
Adult: 67%
Elder:  3%

Which sounds pretty reasonable.

With a city of around 16,000:
	4800 will be youths,   age 1-8 standard years
	10,720 will be adults, age 9-44 standard years
	480 will be elders,    age 45-245 standard years

According to Websters, Common Era came into usage circa 1889.

I am shocked to see flames rise so high over such an inane topic.

It is my humble opinion that the term began being used by academics, not
to lessen the impact of Jesus, nor to be "politically correct" (another
loaded phrase I personally dislike) but to:

(1) Use objective, dispassionate terms in writing histories; to distance
the writer\'s work from his or her personal beliefs.

(2) Be more precise about the meaning of the dating system, since the
actual date of birth of Jesus is in doubt. Most estimates place it at 4
BCE, some as early as 20 BCE, iirc.

Not having a decent etymological reference at hand (or on the net), the
above is pure speculation.


In closing, I ask that those with sensitivities or insecurities about
their choice of religious, political or military devotion (or lack
thereof) would take their petty flame-wars to a more appropriate forum.

Which were those social controls?  I seem to recall something about the Bill
of Rights.  Were those controls?  Glad we have that second one, my personal
favorite.  Otherwise only marines would have the guns.

FWIW, all of my marine buddies that *came back* from the Gulf were appalled
at the way the so-called Iraqi government treated its troops.  They also
said that they wouldn\'t\'ve held out as long under the same conditions,
either.

ObTrav: I vaguely remember the psionic beasties that almost escaped and took

it at home).  Are there other canon instances of things that escaped from

Actually, the shell serves as a sort of rib cage, protecting internal organs.
The quills are purely to intimidate predators. They are redundant; I guess I
just like the mental picture.

Excellent idea! For the Roran to be a popular sentry animal throughout the
Imperium,it can\'t be hard to feed. That is, it must be able to digest commonly
found food. I\'m thinking of having the Roran refuse to eat dead food, though.
It likes its meat live and squealing!

The problem is, most (current, Terran) religions aren\'t terribly keen on 
killing people. I would treat chaplains like medics - basic military 
training, but not intended as a combatant.

A long standing dream of mine has been to ride the shuttle, or more 
accurately, to eventually get into space...  Anyone share that dream?

Also, what would you pay (how much), in a world-wide lottery, for a

Yeah, I\'m doing 3D pencil cubes right now, but the problem is that with
no rotation some systems mask others.  There is also no easy way to
check distances.

A nice nav computer program will solve all of this, but my intent had
simply been to build the cube in lightwave and turn it into a gif
animation rotating. 

The map would include stars, major trade routes, bases and xyz coords.

As for where I am now, I just draw an isometric cube, put little circles
in and ring them with star systems.  Still primitive and it is unweildy
to try to visualize surrounding sectors.  

I also state this doesn\'t invalidate the Trav Imperium at all.  It just
takes place above the mapped Imperium in the mysterious and unproven
third dimension.

More later.

They do say there are no atheists in foxholes, so yeah, I think they probably 
will still exist in some form.

However, I don\'t believe there could be any official Imperial religion, and the 
3I is so big, and includes so many cultures - even averaging only 1 major 
religion per world, that\'s 11,000 different religions, and each of those could 
worship several gods! - that I don\'t think it\'ll be more than a Generic Religios 
Coordinator.

I accept your apology and offer my own.  I think we probably inflicted more

Perhaps in the height of our personal flamewar we lost sight of our own
experiences and better intentions.  These topics (usually ignored by
publishers and game designers for EXACTLY this reason) are difficult to
explore without engendering massive debate, and sometimes warfare.

I would hope that all the cultures of the world could avoid that last in the

Moi aussi.  Interested in some comparative religious discussion?  I think we
may have a lot more in common than you think (I was raised in a rather
strict Christian faith), despite what our respective religious so-called
leaders might try to tell us.  I\'m always intrigued by what other
(intelligent) folk believe.  Anyone of any stripe that cannot discuss these
things without rancor I have no time for, whether they agree with me or not.

I tend to agree with you.  Real World, Marines don\'t have chaplains or 
medical staff in the Corps.  They are Navy personnel assigned with the 
Marines.  The chaplain assigned to your battalion may or may not be part 
of your faith group.  They are cross-trained (though some of the faith 
groups cannot work with other faith groups except to provide 
counsel/support, etc.) to understand as many of the faith groups as 
possible.

In the 3I, I could see a religious coordinator in the Imperial Naval 
forces, as these come from many different worlds.  However, for 
planetary forces, particularly army (and even the Imperial Army) (as 
most of a particular unit is from the same world) I think they would 
have chaplains for the major religious groups.

They are definately noncombatants.

Mr. Berry:  I know quite a few chaplains, both in the Army and the other 
services.  They have quite a ministry among the soldiers and other 
servicemen under their care.  I think it depends a lot on the chaplains 
that you have too, as I have know quite a few were only there for the 
"job" or the pay and could not have cared less about the spiritual 
wellbeing of their charges.

    'body' => 'One of the reasons I like the IMPERIUM game, is that it shows the
difference between normal strategy and political strategy (in my mind
anyhow).  Where there is an obvious strategy or tactical course to follow
for a side in the war, it should be taken, but what happens when someone
with more authority, but less on the spot accumen, decides to take away
forces you need?  What happens when a minor setback in a war happens, and
the powers that be decide to sack the leader - replacing him with a lessor
ability officer?

  To answer the gent who stated that the 3I was really DUMB, the only thing
that I can state is that to an extent, you are correct in your assessment,
but also incorrect.  Historians have a bad habit of yelling "WHAT A DUMB
IDIOT" at a guy who makes his best assessment at the time with the
information and limitations that he has.  From what I can see of the
Imperial history regards to the Solomani question, it looks like there were
two major politcal factions working against each other - and the solomani
lost.  As a consequence, they went to war, and kind of both lost and won.
Meanwhile, at the opposite end of the imperium, the Zhodani started their
fifth frontier war, causing problems.
  In a way, from what I recall of my Roman history, the third Imperium is a
somewhat close analogy to Rome.  Expand out as far as you can go, leave no
enemies nearby, and then incorporate the conquored into your culture.
Problem is, the Imperium had not one "Persia" to contend with, but two.
Perhaps the biggest "error" in the Imperium, is that they allowed the
Villani to sway them to the point where the Solomani went to war.  Had they
been able to create a united front against the Zhodani, the third Imperium
might have been able to bring the full effect of it\'s economic and military
might against the Zhodani.
  Another strategy, that might well have been followed, was to make
diplomatic overtures to the barbarians, er excuse me, the Aslan to help
attack the Solomani with the understanding that when the Aslan and Third
Imperium joined together, that the Aslan would find themselves with full
priveledges within the Imperium as nobles and member worlds, permitting
them to retain all conquests against the Solomani.

  In short, there seems to have been a few "political" errors, that ended
up being strategic errors as well, but then again - wars don\'t happen just
because.  Wars are not usually fought just so that there might be fighting,
they are fought as a result of "policy" of nations.
  One reason I am drawn back to the Imperium background as a roleplaying
environment, is that it is so well detailed in a lot of areas.

I was wondering if anyone had built a campaign, similar to what is

  A question was raised regarding the use of minefields...

  If perhaps the original purpose of mines have diminished perhaps the
psychological purpose could still remain...


Captain\'s log addendum:  "post jumpspace exit has worked well, and we are
now onroute to the gas giant to refuel.  High guard reports all clear..."

  Suddenly, battle alarms shriek as the sound of escaping atmosphere sounds
throughout the ship.  Drop doors slide in place as the atmoshpere
containment measures activate.  The Captain grimaced as he realizes that
some of his crew will have been caught in areas without vac suits, while
more are likely dead from the original attack.  A brief few seconds go by
as the ship attempts to attain battlestation mentality.  With out
prompting, the engineer at the engineering station on the bridge rang out.

"sir, we took a hit in the high starboard aft engineroom.  Sensor recording
indicate a close range hit by a laser mine."

Biting back a bitter curse, the captain realized that the enemy were
starting to use mines again.  "Alright, lets spread the word, let fleet com
know what happened and give the warning that there might be more out there.
 In the mean time, I want sensor ops on full battle alert.  Keep the ship
at alert status 3 with automatic alert status 1 should sensor\'s indicate
enemy ships.  In the meantime, I want an assessment of battle damage repair
times and causalties.  Lets get to work gentlemen shall we?"

  In short, placing orbit keeping mines around gas giants, in small enough
numbers that the mines are unusual encounters, may keep the enemy at
heightened states of alert.  It might also cause them to spend extra time
making sure that it is ok to enter into a refuelling orbit around gas
giants.  Also, I could easily see it where such mines are laid such that
they ignore ships of the line, and target smaller ships and/or freighters...

     Just a few thoughts...

	imho the best way to print 3D maps, is to print a map for any
	system. the map should look like the "Elite" navigation map,

This may start a war (and I\'ve never been in a *real* one), but I have
heard that the *Vandoo* (Canadian, Quebec) were every bit as tough and
possibly better trained than the Marines. Maybe that was just the
appreciative comment of my brother.

I too have worked on a system of 3d mapping for my own amusement. My
question to you is \' why try to stuff round data into a square hole? \'
A  sector does not have to be 32x40 parsecs in a *new* system. I feel it
should be more like 31x31 in diameter ( a centre plus 15 hexes in any
direction). That makes for an very large sector. I used an 11x11 hex
with  a jump of 6 taking you into a new sector (or subsector, whatever). 
This eventually led to a revised numbering and display system which
allows the astrogator to see what and where is available within his
jump  area. I had posted (I thought) my ideas for you people to shatter,
but it was during the ice storm down east and may not have been
received. I still have a copy I think or can rewrite from memory if your
interested. 
I believe a new 3d system has merit but will not necessarily be for
everyone.

     Greetings fellow TMLer\'s,

     I am wondering if anyone could provide info on just what exactly the
various government types in Trav are?  I mean, just what is a fuedal

various types listed in the game, and some descriptions.  After all, the way I
see the US govt (for example), it could be a Representitive Democracy, a Civil
Service Bureaucracy, an Impersonal Bureaucracy, or a Self-Perpetuating
Oligarchy!  Please help me out...I don\'t really need very detailed
descriptions, just something so I can make them work for my players.

Thanks in advance,

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Your comment about what the US Gov\'t could be in Traveller brings out a significant point about government types - what the government calls itself isn\'t necessarily what it is. Imagine how far a trade negotiation team would get if they referred to His Excellency the Prime Minister as a Non-Charismatic Dictator? 

The UPP code for government is what the Scout Service, Imperial Bureaucracy, or other survey authority classified the government as being closest to - they could easily make mistakes, especially in a poorly studied or seldom visited culture. A JTAS article I\'ve read even pointed out that it might not be the only government on the planet or in the system - their example was a low-tech Representative Democracy that was actually just the nomad tribe living closest to the star port - the rest of the planet had little knowledge the star port was even there, but the corporation that built the star port made it look like the natives were a united culture as part of a trade monopoly scheme.

Feudal Technocracy is one of those hard-to-picture governments, I don\'t think any exist on this planet right now (unless you count some corporations or universities as "societies"). Lately I\'ve seen it identified as a kind of catch-all for any society where what you do for a living or what technology you control defines how much power you have - "He who controls computers controls the world!!!" .  Technologically Elevated Dictatorships (TED\'s), Technocracies, Scientocracies, Government by Guild or Trade Union (don\'t piss off the Brotherhood of Sanitation Engineers, they have clout) - all these would fall into the broad definition of "Feudal Technocracy".

   There is no reason to drop AD/BC for CE/BCE, since doing so is nothing
more than "intellectual wallpaper"--an attempt to pretend that we have
purged God from our calendars.  It allows pseudointellectual humanists to
feel hip, and strut around as though they are actually one with the rest of
the world (forgetting that they are by nature elitists), and *that* reason
alone is good enough for me to object vigorously to the change.

>Hell, we can\'t get folks in the US to learn metrics, how\'re we going to get
>them to accept a more modern calendar?

   OK, let\'s approach this from a purely economic point of view for a
moment.  Let\'s assume that everyone can agree on a date to restart the
calendar.  Do you want to be the one who has to pay for the "upgrade"?
*Nobody* will (part of why the metric system has failed to take hold in the
US).  

   We live in a civilization that was founded by a bunch of Christian
religious fanatics and BC/AD reflects that.  Had they not been so fanatical,
we wouldn\'t be having this conversation right now--in fact there would not
be a Western Civilization.  People need to understand where we as a
civilization come from, and be comfortable with it, even if we\'d don\'t
worship in the same way (or at all).

   If God means so little to your typical pseudointellectual humanist, why
all the vigorous attempts to erase it from our culture?  Because they don\'t
like the guilt they feel when they are confronted with a symbol of it?
Maybe they aren\'t as comfortable in their so-called atheism as they pretend
to be...

   Actually several school districts have bagged Halloween activities on
"religious grounds".  You can expect that somebody, somewhere will bring up
the fact that St. Valentine\'s Day is a religious holiday and therefore
should be banned.

>Relax people.  Cultures change, and the America most of us were raised in no

   But are the changes taking place for the better?  Desegregation?  yes.
Quota systems?  no.  Teaching about other cultures and systems of belief?
yes.  Removing all religious symbols and activities from school property?
no.  Birth control?  yes.  Abortion on demand as a means of birth control?
no.  A more open dialog about sex?  yes.  Sex without responsibility?  no.

   Culture change can and must be made to work toward making society better.
If it doesn\'t, it might be *change* but it isn\'t *progress*.  Those things
that were best about our culture 20, 30, 40 years ago can always be
recaptured if we are willing to work for them.

   Agreed, in that a broad appeal is necessary to reach a wide range of
consumers.  However, it should also be remembered that things American
*sell*, otherwise there would not be a McDonalds in Japan, no one outside of
the US would have heard of Elvis Presley, and you wouldn\'t be able to see an
American TV show in Germany (I of course skillfully leave out all references
to EuroDisney, for which I once again apologize to the people of France).

   I know what you are saying, but a certain amount of cultural prejudice is

democracy, yet if you read the material, you can see ideas and concepts
there that are most definitely influenced by my American upbringing.

   My players generally bring in Taco Bell and the usual junk food.  Since
burritos could be confused with Hiver "corndogs", I guess you could say the
fare is "Travelleresque"  :-)

   BTW, if for some reason my players were to bring in fudge covered Oreos

   And I intend no flame in your direction.

   It\'s just that I see no purpose in rooting out all vestiges of our
civilization\'s Christian roots.  There is strong evidence that doing so
leaves behind an emptiness that has resulted in many of the social ills you
see today (while you and I may be intellectual moralists, the masses need
belief in *something*--Christ, Allah, Zen, whatever--in order to behave).

   On the other hand I recognize that not everyone is Christian and that
they have a right to worship (or not) as they wish.  The Constitution of the
US guarantees the freedom to worship as we choose, as does the constitution
and legal precedents of other Western countries.  That is as it should be.

   I called Kettering, Ohio (a suburb of Dayton) home until October of last
year, when I moved to Lexington, Kentucky (about a two drive or so south).
Most of my family is still up there and I visit frequently.

   BTW, Ohio now has a Republican governor and a Republican legislature.  My
goal is to covert the Commonwealth of Kentucky next.  :-)

   Given that I get queasy while being on a commerical airliner in descent

spacecraft) and be forced to live on I-Vs.

I\'m aware of that, but much of the \'Roman\' culture and knowledge people
talk about was of Greek origin anyway. The Romans greatly admired Greek
civilization and set out to aquire/copy/steal as much of it as they could.
Greek slave tutors were fashionable in Rome for a very long time, as they
were held to be more civilized than other people.

Not to mention much of the Classical and Helenistic Greek writings that we
have now. It\'s a pity that so much was lost when some of the extremist
Christian Emporers, mobs and churchmen burnt various books and libraries
they didn\'t approve of.

I think the Terrans would have more impact if the 3I had put little more
effort into rimward expansion earlier. By the time Terra was incorporated
it was (IMO) too late as it never became truely integrated into the 3I,
with disasterous results.

I can\'t tell you off-hand, but I suspect not. Bear in mind, though that an
enormous amount of the revision done to the way militaries operate after
WWII was copied from the German military. The Germans were the first to
develop and use combined arms & air power usefully, and thrashed the
British and French in France, even though the allies were more numerous and
better equiped.

I remember reading that even late in the war the Soviets were very
impressed by the German infantry, because despite the lack of well trained
replacements the Germans were still very effective because their fire
discipline was very good.

    'body' => 'Hello Hans,
 I use a modified version of what you spoke about with regards to the
income problem...

1) the rate is per parsec, not per jump.

2) for every two parsecs over the first, I give an increase in income based
on the current trend to give bonuses to higher speed travel as compared
with lower speed travel.

  This helps the faster ships to compete and be profitable.  My only real
problem with the high "transport" shipping costs is that prices of goods
have to be much higher in order to turn a profit.  For example: if you have
a good that normally would cost 1,000 credits per unit, and you can ship 4
units per Dton, then the cost per parsec would be an additional 250 credits
per persec distance travelled.  So, if you have a target planet 4 parsecs
away, the shipping add on costs now equal an additional 1000 credits to the
value of the item shipped.  So now, the merchant, must sell his "item" at a
minimum of 2000 credits to break even.  Yet Traveller generally doesn\'t
seem to reflect this "reality" in it\'s economic rules.

  What I would kind of like to see happen?  

1) raw materials not be affected by tech level as much as they are.  A TL 3
ton of ore should not be worth 70% less than a tech 10 ton of ore.  Trade
imbalances are going to be severe if for every 1 credit a world earns in
trade, it pays out 7 (or more)

2) wholesale is a hell of a lot different than retail.  When buying food
from a source, and then selling it at market, there should be a higher
difference between the cost of a speculative good, and it\'s resale.  If I
might suggest, perhahps the cost of goods should be dropped an extra 1,000
credits.  Also, the cost of goods should not be increased due to poorer
starports as drastically as they are.  What is to keep the freighter from
landing directly at the warehouse locations on a TL2 or 3 world and loading
on his cargo?  The rationale of transportation costs doesn\'t wash in my
view...

3) loading times: they are non-existant.  A given trailer for an 18 wheeler
has how much volume?  How long does it take to load it?  Now compare it
with a 82 ton cargo hold of a free trader (CT version).  Assuming a 10 foot
wide by 10 foot tall by 40 foot trailer, we are looking at 4000 cubic feet
of volume.  This is equal to roughly 8 tons in Traveller by volume.
Loading times would be analogous to 10 such trailors...

This is not strictly true.  With Canon jump drives, there is some uncertainty
in the exact duration of the jump (the exact amount has varied from one
edition of the game to another).  I suggest using 148 hours (6 days, 4 
hours) to 188 hours (7 days, 20 hours), with the average being 168 hours (7 
days exactly).  Compute this using 140+8d6, and the results will generally
match what was done in T:TNE.

If two ships were to jump to the same destination simultaneously, it\'d be an 
even toss-up as to which ship arrived first. although the likelyhood is
that they\'d arrive within a few hours of one another.  If it ever became 
important, as a referee I think I\'d allow the engineer to attempt a task to 
skew the results (perhaps a difficult task would allow the engineer to
declare the value for 3 dice, and roll the other 5; a formidable task
would allow him to declare 5 dice, and roll the other 3), thus allowing
ships to "race" through jumpspace.  

>In short, your rule makes it possible to "overtake" a ship. Which has
>serious consequences.

It\'s always been possible, but subject to random factors and the referee\'s
whim, and never by more than somewhere beteween a few hours and a couple 
of days.

Having a jump take significantly less than a week would seriously harm the
Traveller background (eg, allowing a J-2 ship to cross a parsec in 3.5 days
as was recently proposed).  Non-canonical universes like this can be fun
(I once played in a non-canon universe where jumps took 3 days regardless
of distance travelled).

Well, in Sweden, the word for Christmas is Jul ... which is a originally
the name of the old midwinter-sacrifice Yule (from the vikings). The words
are pronounced in almost exactly the same way in Swedish.

Also, I believe that many English-speaking people are using the word
Yuletime (or something like that) to refer to the week or so before and
after Christmas. Is this correct, or am I mistaken?

A small note for the interested: Yuletime for a Viking would mean something
like "It\'s time to decide what cow to sacrifice"

Especially since Halloween is originally the Celtic holy night called
Samhain, the night when the ghosts of the deceased return to the Earth, and
need to be pleased or forced away. Isn\'t it strange what Christianity has
picked up during it\'s existence?

This is most certainly true. A great statement.

Now, I will pull out of this discussion, unless someone makes a comment on
my posts specifically (or I really cannot help myself).

That would be me, I guess. What I was talking about was the 3I\'s lack of
Rimward effort early on - the 3I is moving in on the Zhodani about 5
sectors away before they incorporate the Solomani, only 3 sectors away.
Then they spend insufficient effort infully integrating it into the
Imperium, even though large autonomous regions are dangerous. What is more
once the Solomani power bloc was broken they ignored the dissafection of
the Solomani and made no effort to mend the fences - and this was with a
region that included the homeworld of many citizens, and included about a
third of the volume of the 3I at that time. Then when they couldn\'t ignore
the Solomani anymore they didn\'t even finish the job properly, thus leaving
the Solomani as a constant threat, and handing the Solomani the rimward
frontier.

Likewise they let the Julian Protectorate go, and never even tried to get
it back, even though it was part of both the 1st and the 2nd Imperiums.
This permanantly blocked coreward expansion.

The Frontier Wars show that the 3I was seldom prepared for war, and this in
a sector that abuts a large and unfriendly neighbour. IMO the 3I was damn
lucky that the Zho\'s wern\'t expansionistic, because if they were the 3I
would stop at Corridor.

The Zhodani are quite like the Persians - they aren\'t expansionistic
towards Rome/3I, but the Solomani are kind of like if the Romans,once
thay\'d defeated Carthage adsorbed them into the Republic, and then when
they rebelled let them and their Spanish colonies go.

You are so right!  In OCS (Officer Candidate School) we went through a 
training phase which was borrowed from the German Army following WWII.  
It was to make us think of solutions...think outside the box.  Very 
important in the USMC today, and, I suspect, the rest of the US 
services.  

"Mission-type orders" are given that contain the "Commander\'s Intent" so 
that if an oportunity arises that allows you to get the results your 
commander wants but not what he specifically ordered you to do, you can 
jump on it.  Allows you to rest more heavily on your lower ranking 
individuals without having to check back for authority.

Combined Arms comment.... After an exercise in Norway, during the after 
action briefings, the Norwegian Commander asked how come he couldn\'t get 
any air support.  He had heard aircraft over the Marine Corps\' area the 
whole time, but couldn\'t get any support himself.  He wanted to know 
why!  Turns out that the airpower that was over the Marines was Marine 
Air, owned by the Marine Commander on the ground.  Nothing like owning 
your own aircover.

Marine Air....Don\'t leave home without it.

The Wehrmacht gave us lots of advances in warfighting!

It doesn\'t. Since there are more than enough systems in 3D space, I wanted
to make the sector 10x10x10 parsec in size.

For distance, you (or, to be specific, the poor player who plays the astrogator) need 
simple trigonometry.

I thought about that masking thing, too. Wouldn\'t it be a solution to print the map four
times - once from every side? Like in the old 3D isometric computer games where
you could switch the view when something was masked by its surroundings.

Sounds o.k., but isn\'t that a bit difficult to print? ;-)

I think this problem is inherent in this particular design, especially if the player
group suddenly decides to jump out of the sector...

So to put it in terms of what would be charged, adding a 5% profit,
you would have (for one jump shipments, presumably multiple jumps
would just add in the compenent jumps).....

Distance    Cost
Jump-1       880
Jump-2      1500
Jump-3      2080
Jump-4      2710
Jump-5      3480
Jump-6      4600

Right?

Or to simplify...
Charge = 24 + 720*Jump#/ton
which gives an OK fit (it squeezes Jump 1 and Jump 6 carriers).  Or you
can go with
Charge = 205 + 640*Jump#/ton 
with a 500cr premium for Jump 6 carriers
(maybe they are in demand because so many merchants are shipping
multiple
distances in a rush and don\'t want to wait for two jump 3\'s).

Yeah, I have always assumed there are cargo ships the size of Imperial
Dreadnaughts (though not as well armed :-) that run only to place
like Regina and only on a contract basis (and only MegaCorps can
afford so their cost doesn\'t really matter to PC\'s)

Additionally, in such a rate structure, the MegaCorps would be
dominating the most profitable trade, jump 1.  This would mean
the typical megacorp ship would be a jump 1 and the only high
jump ships would be fringe operators working near rifts and
such or "Fed Ex" type carriers.

Ain\'t that the truth... I\'m involved in a rotating quartet of games (I ref
the Traveller, and play in a White Wolf, Cyberpunk, and Rifts, in order of
dice-use).  The Rifts game is rife with pointless dice rolls ("\'cuz that\'s
how you get experience," I\'m told -- we spent an entire five hour session
rolling dice to walk through a one-kilometer-wide minefield).  Cyberpunk
has plenty of "Accidental Seduction" rolls (I won\'t try to explain).  White
Wolf has lots of "Player A wants to Intimidate Player B, so roll
Intimidation" (Player A is someone who thinks *she* should *always* be the
center of attention).

The players were neurotic during the first TNE gaming session -- they
almost never used their dice after generating characters, although they had
crashed on an uncharted planet inhabited by TL2/TL3 natives, and they were
having to learn an alien tongue to communicate.  I had a synthetic language
ready that I had adapted/borrowed, and used it (forcing them to interpret
it and speak it themselves).  By the end of the session, the players were
all very impressed with Traveller in general & my campaign in specific; one
of the players even e-mailed to all of us his language guide a couple weeks
later.

Which leads back to one of my first posts since coming back onto the list,
Religious Careers!  I\'m working on it, I\'m working on it.  I\'ve decided to break
it up into two things.  First, the bares bones generic chargen tables for
different types of religious orders - for use with whatever religion.  Second, a
Third Imperium Church on the scale proportional to the Roman Catholic Church.
This second is whats taking up so much time.  But I have a question you all might
be able to help me with.  I\'m going to strongly base this church on the Roman
Catholic Church.  I am leaning very strongly to making it based on
Judeo-Christianity.  Question concerns Traveller canon, not the other kind:

Is there any canon about the christianity from Terra?
(I have only T4 stuff)

I\'ve got no problem having christianity survive to 2099 or whenever contact was
(-2422 Imperium Calender), but would it survive the collapse of the First
Imperium?
Would it spread into the Rule of Man?  (I\'m not concerned about the Long Night).

I notice that Vilani contact on Sylea extends back to 8000, so I should probably
incorporate some Vilani beliefs into whatever religion survived on Sylea.

As I stated a little while ago, I play fuedal technocracies as an arm of the
Imperial government.  That\'s just the way I originally understood it, and
seems to make sense (since there are no other ways to end up with a noble
system on a planet, and yet many nobles run planets).

I would say that the U.S. is a representative democracy, without a doubt.  I
would imagine the bureaucracy types a world where everything is run by
committee and there are no approachable public figures other then petty
bureaucrats.  To many, the government of the U.S. is probably not to far off
of this, but its a fine line.  An impersonal bureaucracy I would treat like
the stereotypical U.S. view of the former soviet union during the tail end.
Waiting in line for everything, no immediately apparent politicians between
the common man and the ruler.  A civil service bureaucracy borders on utopian
socialism/communism in some ways...

Its a fine line, but of course, not all governments of the same type will act
in exactly the same way.

   It would seem to me that the best way for the zhos to insure the Imperium
won\'t expand their way (or to keep them contained) would be to go all the way
to the Claw.   That would have relatively ensured protection as the Claw
protected the Domain of Deneb/Regency against Virus. Of course then the Zhos
would have a longer and exposed flank to the Aslan and Vargr.  I don\'t know.
If I was a bigwig in the Consulate, I\'d want a drive to the Claw.
   Instead they only made (relatively) small stabs confined to pretty much the
SM. Fighting Ships says that the Imperium didn\'t even have a BatRon of
Plankwells (it was in Corridor) and they\'d gone to the "elastic defense"
posture instead of the "crust."  Lacking most CT items, can anyone tell me
what exactly the Zhos goals were and how the 5FW progressed?

Hey Rob,

Come across with some details, i.e. the character\'s name, the ship this
happened on, millieu (assume CT?). A character like this disserves to be

Here they changed to that in about 1992-3 by changing the orders from "You

making sure that an old rule that briefings should give an overview of
whats happening two steps up the chain is actually followed, so that

Previously anything past one step up used to get pretty hazy.

Of course the Soviet Frontal Aviation was totally owned by their Army, and
was supposed to be given to commanders. Funny how cool western literature
was towards that idea in the 70\'s. It did mean they never had the fly boys
trying to get new fighters instead of A-10s, though.

ObTrav: Do the Imp Marines own their Ortillery, or do they get it when the
Navy not busy chasing off the last fleeing scout ship?

Semo,

Unfortunately I just see this as the first "garbage" war of \'98. In about 2
years on this List I\'ve seen it degenerate to this type of thing abot twice
a year. The only difference this time is that LeRoy isn\'t involved, (unless
he\'s using an alias). I saw it coming when my mail jumped from 80 to 150 and
today reached about 250 messages, counting the "normal" non-Traveller
messages I recieve. At any rate, while I agree with your posts and you
sentiments, I don\'t really expect that it will help, it usually takes a
couple of weeks for the most rabid on both sides to burn themselves out and
the list to spin back to normal. Also, don\'t feel that it was your fault! If
it hadn\'t been your question it would have been something else, it just
happens!


That said, I have a question that is totally off of the subject of CE, PC,
etc., so it\'ll probably go completely unnoticed, but I\'ll ask anyway.

I\'m thinking along the lines of a cruise ship and one of the Features of the
cruise is the experience of refueling in a gas giant atmosphere. Ok, what my
question is, is what are the effects of a high gee world, say Saturn, or
Jupiter on the passengers of the ship? I\'ve always, before thought of it
like a roller coaster ride with the crew heavily strapped into their seats
and the ship buffeted about, but this won\'t do for this scenario. So I want
to put in some extra grav compensation, but TL constraints say that 3 gee is
the limit ( for a M:0 campaign setting). Any of the real Brains out there
have any thoughts on what the ride would be like?

    For a variety of reasons too complicated my players have temporarially
stranded themselves on a balkinized tech level 4 world and are having to fight
on the side of one of the local rulers in the local Wars.  Long story but they
managed to get seperated from their starship, which is locked up so the other
natives can\'t get inside it, though not for lack of trying. ;) Anyway my
players still have access to their ship\'s library through their personal
communicators and one of them noticed the locals have got some pretty good
distilling technology.  They should have, the Brandy and Whiskey these folks
make is a trade item across half the sector.
    Anyway this guy\'s gotten the bright idea of using the distilling equipment
to make extremely high proof alcohol for Molatov cocktails and perhaps even
Fuel Air Bombs amongst other "miracles" of chemisty.  I hadn\'t quite counted on
such inventiviness on his part so I\'m turning to the list for help!  I know
that each point of "Proof" equals about .5% of the volume being alcohol.  I.e.
20 proof means ten percent of the volume is pure alcohol.  So...

    At what proof is a distilate going to be liable to ignite?  Will it just
burn or is it gonna be an explosive (ie. very fast combustion) burn?

    More to the point how in the heck would you use a high proof distilate to
make something like a fuel air bomb?

    Any other ideas for the use of distilling and such for purposes of warfare?

    I have faith in the ability of all the science and engineering types to
come up with a plethora of nasty and inventive uses for this stuff.  I just
want to have some warning of what to expect before my players spring them on me

    Add in a fifth here as well, though I did tie mine into the "canon"
Universe to some extent.  I took that excellent idea of Jumpspace "planes" and
postulated that it takes a REALLY MASSIVE object at just the "right" place
between two planes to allow access to either.  Then had a pair of Black Holes
in mutual capture orbits providing the "Bridge" between the planes.  (Yeah I
know the Black Hole Pair will eventually collapse into each other but that\'s
gonna take a couple tens of thousands of years.  Less than an eyeblink on the
Cosmic scale but more then enough for my purposes.)
    Anyway the justification for it is that in the early days of Vilani first
contact and the First few Interstellar Wars the Terran Confederation was
desperately sending out deep space explorers and settling along the rim like
crazy where it could afford to spare the resources from the Wars.  In any case
a couple of really deep ranging Explorers and blind follow on colonizers found
the "Bridge" and transited to the other plane of Jumpspace and thus
functionally virgin territory.  Only they found other humans race, abet in low
tech settings, which is a mystery my players are just begining to notice. ;)
    Anyway the game setting evolved from a bunch of late Second Imperium
Solomani Families (ala Pocket Empires) who decided to flee the coming collapse
Rimwards.  I generated up nine sectors worth of physical stats, placed my minor
human races where I needed them, and placed one or two jump tech capable
civilizations from the original colonizers, then had the original Families
"settle" their chosen worlds.  From that point I ran Pocket Empires forward
about 1,100 years and ended up with about a dozen major Governments (covering
at least two subsectors or more) and about three dozen minor Governments and
Bunch of independent worlds.
    It makes for an interesting setting and allows me to use the new Milieu 0
stuff as I choose to without being tied to the canon setting.

Excellent! This is exactly what I wanted to hear. This, combined with
the proposed storyline (continuation of CT), and the usual quality of
SJG´s products has made me a definitive buyer! Ay, where can I sign up

Full and complete agreement, the Keiths did marvelous work in their

This somehow reminds me of when I bought MegaTraveller half a year after

 You do too? We had to go to Chapel as well (well we could opt out, but
 then the really dirty work waited during that hour for those who stayed
 behind: "Well, as you don=B4t seem to be doing anything right now....")
 I hated it until i realize that i could catch up on an hour of sleep
 while i was there. Made the Chaplain mad as hell, but who am i to care
 about that! ;-)

And taking a look at "Christian" History suggests to me it´s a time for
change, for free and enlightened human thinking unburdened by the excess
baggage of religion! People should take up the moral standards because
they are right, nor because the feel obliged.

Why do we have to agree on how something works? 
It can work this way for you, this way for me, the handwave rules of MT
CT and SOM were all I ever needed to explain the general concept to my

Everybody should be able to do what he likes. We don´t need to create

Archangel Entertainment To Publish Dark Conspiracy Next Edition

        Archangel Entertainment ( an adventure game publisher) announced
today that it has concluded an agreement to publish the next edition of
DARK CONSPIRACY, the award winning near-future horror/sci-fi game system
designed by Lester Smith.  Originally released in 1992 by the now defunct
Game Designers\' Workshop, DARK CONSPIRACY has continued to attract players
and devotees in print and on the web.
        Ken Whitman, president of Archangel Entertainment, noted "When I
first read through DARK CONSPIRACY, it gave me the creeps.  I started
pursuing the license the next day."
        Archangel Entertainment is joined in this project by Lester Smith,
the award winning original designer of Dark Conspiracy; he commented ""GDW
knew my passion for horror games, so it didn\'t take much to talk  me into
designing one. I threw myself into DARK CONSPIRACY, heart and soul, and
nurtured the line with fiendish love. I\'m excited to see it  coming back
into print!""
        DARK CONSPIRACY originally appeared in 12 products and modules.
Archangel plans to revise the game system into a DARK CONSPIRACY REFEREE\'S
GUIDE (256 pages, $20)  and a DARK CONSPIRACY PLAYER\'S HANDBOOK (256 pages,
$20)  in May of 1998 followed by three follow-on modules by the end of the
year.
        DARK CONSPIRACY is a trademark of Dark Conspiracy Enterprises.
        For More information, contact Ken Whitman, 414-248-7189,
414-249-9456 (fax), or archangel@archangelent.com

When I did my Basic Sunday morning was \'free\' if you didn\'t go to church, a
great time to catch up. Most of us didn\'t go to church, but we did thank
the Chaplains for that free time, because if they wern\'t there I\'m sure the
Army would\'ve found a use for that time.

That make you a Sun worshipper then? IIRC the Christians spent quite a lot

I have an uncle who had a 1st class ticket to be in the first wave ashore in
Japan. He had survived several amphib landings, he tells me, and didn\'t expect
to survive that one. I do not blame him for being glad the first bomb was
dropped. I am still undecided about the second, but hindsight is 20/20, as
they say. In Truman\'s shoes, I would probably have made the same decision.

True, but a good game will be set up so the characters complement each
other or intentionally drive each other bonkers.  This balance of

Actually the Ghurkas are pretty much the all time nail eaters.
Royal Marines are reputed to be just as good if not better than the
average US Marine.

The only way to really find out is to pit them against each other, but
then you have no nastiguys left:(

Did ya\'ll know the US Marine symbol shows the Western Hemisphere because
the Brits showed the East?  Monroe doctrine there.  Sort of outdated
today....but coooool.

IIRC the old test for proof was that when mixed with water 50/50 a proof
mixture would just burn. I think there needs to be about 27% alcohol for
the alcohol to burn. Now even at 100% alcohol you\'ll be very lucky to get
explosive alcohol/air mixes or FAE, because (ethyl) alcohol just doesn\'t
burn fast or hot enough.

You could try forcing it out under pressure to make an aerosol and then
igniting it, but I don\'t think there\'d be enough ooomph.

If you can distill alcohol you can distill hydrocarbons, so if they can
find any then they\'d have their FAEs, Molotovs and other fun toys. At TL4
there shuold be gunpodwer and any decent chemist should be able to make
nitroglyerene, guncotton and cordite. A good chemist should be able to make
picric acid or TNT both of which make fine HE shell fillers. BTW good old
ammonium-urea fertilizer explosive is well within TL4 and while it would be
better with the addition of some light oil or diesel fuel it\'ll go fine
without.

Alcohol makes a fine rocket fuel, with the addition of an oxidiser - say
hydrogen peroxide or nitirc acid, neither of which are too hard to make.

Just a quick story, maybe amusing, maybe not, but very thought provoking. A
co-worker and I were talking about this thread in work today. He is a
retired National Guard Enigineer. At any rate, he tells me, a number of
years ago he was in a debreifing following a simulation on an action taking
place in Germany, the situation, as he explained it, was that the Battalion
to which he belonged was involved in a holding action against a Soviet
advance. The CO was using a map of Germany to point out the various manuvers
and actions during the simulation, in part to explain it to several NATO
observers who were there. The CO went through various points, this unit
moved here and dug in, this unit moved there, the enemy moved here, etc.
When he\'d finished and just befor the breifing broke up, one of the NATO
observers, a German officer, stepped up and asked the CO to explain why he
left a mountain pass undefended, since it presented a prime oppertunity for
the Soviet forces to flank the "Freindlies". The CO very calmly explained
that the pass was a "non-concideration". It seems that at the start of the
exercised he\'d ordered his artillary to drop a couple of "freindly" nukes on
the mouth of the pass, eleminating it as a concideration. Turned out that
the observer was from a small hamlet that sat at the mouth of the pass! His
comment was , to paraphrase, "What\'s so "friendly" about tactical nukes?"

The point of this (I guess) is that what\'s "friendly" to some might not be
to some of our "friends".  Not sure how relevent this is but it was a neat
story.

	OK, here\'s something that that piques my curiosity. I\'ve been
led to believe that, "Crimson Tide" to the contrary, there *are
no* regulations authorizing a subordinate officer to relieve his
superior of command. Does the training cover the specific
situation described in the movie? Or similar situations?

<Interrupt>
For those who haven\'t seen the movie, a US strategic nuclear
submarine receives orders to launch its missiles at a certain
point in the future. Later on, the countermanding order is sent,
but due to some malfunction, isn\'t fully received. The commanding
officer determines to go ahead with the launch. The executive
officer is convinced the garbled transmission was the cancel
order, and wants to request clarification. When the CO refuses to
do so, the XO, quoting (apparently) non-existent regulations,
attempts to relieve him of command. What follows is, basically, a
mutiny, with some crewmembers siding with the CO, some with the
XO. For the rest, you\'ll have to watch the movie.
</Interrupt>

	So, looking at Star Trek, which apparently DOES have regulations
or General Orders stating when a subordinate not only may but
MUST relieve a superior, and modern US military regulations which
do not:

	- Would the IN have such regulations? How about IISS, or IA?
Likewise other races?
	- Under what conditions would it be legal?
	- How likely would it be to succeed?

with the hairy dirty Army guys on the ground, right up where the
bad guys are shooting... His stories about jumping out of a C130,
at midnight and 500 feet, with tracers flying around, were hair
raising. Did you know the Army apparently doesn\'t issue reserve
parachutes when you\'re jumping at 500 feet?

	While I\'ve not been privy to any of the formal investigations, I
understand he did in fact direct his wingman to visually identify
the bogeys. Only after his wingman positively confirmed that the
targets were Soviet-built Hinds did he give the fire order.

	Despite apparent attempts to blame it all on the AWACS
controllers, or on the pilots, there were many people whose
failure caused the tragedy. Any one of them could have prevented
it. The helicopters hadn\'t filed a flight plan with the folks
responsible for all the flying, so the flight wasn\'t on the daily
Air Tasking Order (which the AWACS could have referenced). The
helicopters didn\'t have their IFF on. The AWACS crew didn\'t
properly track the helicopters. The wingman made a false
identification. The flight lead didn\'t personally double-check
the identification...

	ObTrav: how DO you confirm targets in the Traveller environment?
Visual identification is not normally possible--to get close
enough to confirm it\'s a bad guy, you\'d be close enough for his
blind, crippled Shi-Tzu to blow you away. Maybe you can do
something with neutrino sensors, densitometers, and imaging
sensors to come up with some kind of general characterization,

Military.

The first is the idea of noble obligation - a lot of Imperial Military
officers are going to be doing a couple of terms becasue they *should*, and
then going back to run their estates, go on hunting trips, take up the
family seat in the Imperial Moot etc. This may also apply to the other
services - I can easily imagine Joe Noble signing up in the IISS, being
"one of the guys" and then getting a swag of paperwork informing him his
Father, Duke Whatsit, has died and he has to get back to Sylea *now* to
take up his duties. All his old IISS drinking buddies then get invites to
his parties, perhaps with a stack of High Passage tickets to get there.

The second is the system of Military Pensions, and what this implies given
the high level of income dispersion in the worlds of the Imperium. Assume
average income on Sylea is Cr 14 000, and the Sylean Credit trades at
parity with the Imperial. Is it worth doing 20 years to get a Cr 4000
pension ? Probably not, because semi-skilled workers will earn more than
that, with no risk of finding out what a Meson Gun does at point-blank. Now
assume you come from some dirtball TL7 planet that has an annual income of
Cr4000, and trades at 10 local credits to one Imperial credit. Given this,
your Imperial pension for the same 20 years service is worth 10 times the
local average earnings.

Combining these two, I see a class-ridden Imperial military - the officer
corps being filled with noble sons and daughters doing their bit for the
Empire, with perhaps a few timeservers who couldnt get a real job, were
blackballed by the family or whatever, and the Other Ranks being primarily
from the poorer worlds of the Imperium, and knowing that the majority of
them are never going to make it into Officers Country.

distances, *please* email me :)

Another problem is that a small world - say 5000 people, TL8 - may not have
enough cargo to fill even a Far Trader on any given week.

In short, I dont agree that all worlds should be able to sell any quantity
of goods to a passing trader at any given time. Some goods should also be
date dependant - for example, there may be megatons of froot beans just
after the harvest (days 112-134), but in the low season (days 200-50) froot
beans can only be found frozen.

Goods may also have political limits - I am thinking of COCOM type
restrictions for hi-tech goods and the need for valid political permissions
and/or End User Certificates when buying military goods.

The next point is that as the maximum technology of an area increases,
freight prices will fall, because freight is paid for by Imperial Credits,
and ships are built with local credits.

Imagine a TL11 Far Trader in a TL11 Imperium. It is a state of the art
machine, built only at the most advanced shipyards.

Now imagine the same TL11 Far Trader in a TL15 Imperium. It is being built
in provincial shipyards, who would sell them for less Imperial credits,
which they need to buy TL15 goods. The TL11 trade ships would thus be able
to undercut the TL15 trade ships, because they deliver the same service.
Thus, freight prices in Imperial Credits would be forced down.

Recently, I found a collection of Harry Truman\'s unsent letters, and I dont
believe that I have the right to say if he was right or wrong in deciding
to drop the atomic bombs.

OTOH one of my heroes, Tom Uren, does. Tom Uren was in Changi between 1942
and 1944, and was a prisoner of war doing forced labour in a Japanese
factory in 1945. His view was that to drop the bomb was wrong, as neither
Hiroshima or Nagasaki were military targets, and in any case a
demonstration would have had a similar cost/benefit analysis.

Tom Uren, a leader of the Left faction of the Australian Labor Party, was
also a leader in the campaign against Australian involvement in the Vietnam
war.

Bringing this back ObTrav, I think it is quite possible to have an ex-war
hero campaigning against either Imperial involvement in a certain war, or
Imperial tactics (especially in the early "ruthless" period).

Could be good if you have a party of pro-military players to have a major
NPC as a Uren- or Kovacs-type, who despite being an ex-war hero is opposing
war/this war/the conduct of this war.

I believe that the Imperium would have conventions on wars, even bad wars,
because of the risk of collateral damage. OTOH Hard Times indicates that
the dont.

The IISS doesnt tend to get in shooting wars, and the Imperial Army will
take it\'s cues from the Navy.

One of the ex-US military people may be able to give us a more thorough
answer, but my understanding is that the US Army regulation require the
laws of war to be followed. OTOH the US military tradition of total warfare
(Shenandoah, Mush Morton, free-fire zones etc) trends against this.

The same tension may exist in the Imperium - Andrew Valance\'s recent post
about the Ine Givar shows up this tension.


>	- How likely would it be to succeed?

Quite likely, if the Imperium has as strong concept of honour as I think it
does. I\'m thinking of the song "The Conchie" about a conciencious objector
in a medical corps, who refused orders to go into a minefield to rescue a
wounded soldier.

Well here goes       (very long, please cut and snip to bare bones for
replies to save space.)

I have been using a revised hex numbering system for my campaigns which
may be of interest.
It is based on the ‘unknown space navigation table’ as shown in several
of the Traveller Alien Module\'s and I know it was presented in at least
one other Traveller publications in the past. It groups a 7 across hex
into 6 equal triangular like areas to be used by the referee to plot
star positions as the pc’s journey through space.
Taking the concept a little further, I reasoned that if the center hex
was labeled      0,0,0        I should be able to go as far as I wanted
in any direction and know how far it was from the point of origin. I
labeled the first number set as the sector, the second number as the
band , and the third number as the deviation to starboard within the
sector.
To demonstrate:
Start point is 0,0,0 meaning the center.
Band one is composed of 1,1,0 meaning sector 1 (Coreward), band 1, 0
deviation ---- 2,1,0 meaning sector 2 (Coreward Trailing), band 1, 0
deviation ---- 3,1,0 meaning sector 3 (Rimward, Trailing), band 1, 0
deviation ---- 4,1,0 meaning sector 4 (Rimward), etc.,
etc.       	              5,1,0 meaning sector 5 (Rimward Spinward),
etc., etc. and               6,1,0 meaning sector 6 (Coreward Spinward),
etc., etc.
Band 2 is made up of  1,2,0 and 1,2,1 ---- 2,2,0 and 2,2,1 ---- 3,2,0 and
3,2,1 ---- 4,2,0 and 4,2,1 ---- 5,2,0 and 5,2,1 ---- 6,2,0 and 6,2,1
Band 3 is made up of  1,3,0 - 1,3,1 and 1,3,2 ---- 2,3,0 - 2,3,1 and
2,3,2 etc. etc.
Now lets say we use Capital  (2118) Core as the center of our universe.
It becomes 0,0,0. Using the Atlas of the Imperium, Nimluin (2209) Core
becomes 1,9,1, Ispumer (2615) Core becomes 2,5,0, Gurishi (3022) Core
becomes 3,9,0, Skeen (2226) Core becomes 3,9,8 etc.
If a navigator was at Nimluin, Gurishi or Skeen, he would know that he
had travelled a total distance of 9 parsecs away from Core (5 in the
case of Ispumer) and had made a 1, 0 or 8 respectively parsec starboard
deviation from the norm.
Continuing out a long way, Terra (1827) Sol becomes 4,131,3, Regina
(1910) Spinward Marches becomes 5,130,128. Terra is 131 parsecs from
Capital at a 3 parsec starboard deviation ( (3/130x60)+(3x60) or 181.385
degrees).  Regina is 130 parsecs from capital at a 128 parsec starboard
deviation (128/130x60)+(4x60) or 299.076 degrees).
Notice that the deviation number can only total to 1 less than the band
number, the (((sextant number -1) times 60) plus the ((deviation number
divided by band number ) times 60)) will give the degree angle direction
from center, and  the deviation parsec is always at an angle of  the
((band number times 60) + 120) degrees.
Using the s,bbb,ddd number combination we could expand our borders out
to 997,000+ parsecs in any of 6 directions. It should also be able to be
applied to those referees using 3D space adding a fourth number set
indicating plus/minus for up/down direction.
I realize the numbering system is a little more cumbersome than our
present system, growing from 4 to 9 or 13 but it appears to relay more
usable information without remembering the location of 560 sub-sectors
within 35 sectors, or more if you go outside *known* space.
A sector (usable for most campaigns) could be enclosed in an 11x11x11
hex like space and would contain 1365+/- possible star/world locations
(as compared to 1280 presently) and these could be joined much the same
as we do now. (calculated as 91 locations at 0 plane times 15 or 5x3 to
create the up/down space). 
Since Sol is part of the MW galaxy and it is supposed to be of the
spiral type, we may not have to go to great extremes in the up/down
definitions. Does anyone know what the depth in parsecs is of our
galaxy?
This is probably full of holes, but have at it guys.

Not real bright against the Soviets either, because they\'d call this \'use
of weapons of mass destruction\', and that\'d guarantee them using chemical
weapons and nukes right back.

Most academics are well known for being as inoffensive as 
possible (except occasionally within their own field).  In 
general they especially try not to offend anyone who might 
be able to further their research goals.  This includes (but is 
not limited to) native peoples in the lands pertaining to their
research, politicians (both academic and governmental) 
and money men.

Excuse me?  Did I say anything about "political correctness"?  
Besides, just because a term has been in use for decades 
doesn\'t make it not a "politically correct" term.

I guess it just comes naturally to me.  It must, because I

Jingoistic militarism?  Maybe I should be asking you, 
"Do you have to work at being this obnoxious or does 
it just come naturally to YOU?"  What are you so pissed 
about?  If you were so upset with my comments on 
patriotism (not an exclusive US commodity BTW), then 
you should have responded to them.

Before I responded to your inflammatory statement, I 
needed to be sure of what you meant.  Since you 
assigned the subject of "Annoying Language" we
shall take a look at yours.

Jingoism (n.):  Extreme nationalism marked especially
                         by a belligerent foreign policy.
Extreme (adj.):  Very great; intense/or/Drastic; severe.
Nationalism (n.):  Aspirations for national independence.
Belligerent (adj):  Eager to fight; aggressively hostile.
Militarism (n.):  Glorification of the ideals of a 
                          professional military class.
Ideals (n. pl.):  The standards of perfection or excellence.
- -ism (suff.):  Doctrine; theory; system of principles.
- -ist (suff.):  An adherent or advocate of an -ism.
- -ic (suff.):  Of, relating to, or characterized by.


That means that "jingoistic militarism" means "intense 
aspirations for national independence marked especially 
by an aggressively hostile foreign policy characterized by 
the glorification of the standards of perfection or 
excellence of a professional military class".  Hmm, just 
as I thought, a semantically null statement.  Therefore it\'s 
only intent could be to be inflammatory.

So, tell me, when did I ever advocate violence, hostility 
or aggression?  My words on patriotism were intense.  
They came from the heart. They dealt (indirectly) with 
a desire for national independence.  If you don\'t like 
that, you can take a flying leap.  And if I want to glorify 
the standards of perfection and excellence of a 
professional military class, that is, or at least can be, 
part and parcel of what role playing is all about.

>... You are awfully damn dismissive of
>anyone who does not agree with you. ...

When did I dismiss anyone?  Weather they agree with 
me or not?  Didn\'t you read my statement that IMO 
that it is out of the differences in opinion that great 
insights are born?  It sounds to me like perhaps you 
are projecting your failings on me.

>... Most of the planet "does not not want
>to acknowledge Christ" ie they are not Christians, live with it.

The acknowledgment of Christ does not make you a 
Christian.  Just as the acknowledgment of Satan 
doesn\'t make you a Satanist.  Weather I even believe 
in Christ has not been established.  Weather you 
believe in Christ doesn\'t matter one whit to the topic 
under discussion.

If you know enough about His teachings to be 
offended, then where you spend your eternity is also 
no concern of mine.  Each of us makes our own 
choices and lives (and dies) with the consequences.

Even if no one in the whole world believed in the 
Christ, that does not change the historical fact that a 
man named Iosua (Jesus) was born in the Roman 
province of Judea in or about the year 1 A.D.(C.E.).  
Or the fact that His teachings changed or at least 
impacted the history of large portions of the world.

Weather you or anyone else believes that He was 
The Son of The Singular All Powerful Deity or not 
does not change the fact that He (the man) died in 
Jerusalem in or about the year 32 A.D.(C.E).  And 
finally, weather you or anyone else in the world 
believes He rose from the dead or not does not 
alter his historical significance.

Because of the nature of this list, I have, in the 
past, always used the B.C.(B.C.E.) or A.D.(C.E.) 
notation in my few posts with a dated reference 
or no notation at all for dates A.D.(C.E).

Nothing. It\'s a compromise between security and utility. As it is, the
captain has to press the retain button every 8 hours, with a four hour
grace period in case of unforseen distractions. The primary defense
is the erase button. The career of any officer who allows the Last Will
to fall into the hands of the enemy is ruined forever and he is going
to be lucky to avoid spacing. Even so, the information in the Last Will
will also be time-sensitive, encrypted, and contain logic bombs. Just
as a signal book used to contain the codes for the next few months only.
But remember that a captain who loses the information in the Last Will
will be crippled in his operations. About the only thing he can do is
to return to base. So there should be some safeguards against accidental
erasure. The Last Will would be kept somewhere not-obvious and propably
under lock (Or would it? That would make it difficult for a junior
officer to get at it and erase it...). If you think up to 12 hours is too
long to give a boarding party, you could make it 6 hours, requiring the
button to be pressed by the officer on watch every four hours instead, but
that means that the LW has to circulate between all the senior officers of
the ship which has its own security problems.

QSDS - maximum acceleration is 6G - p108 T4

SSDS and FFS2 don\'t appear to have limits on the acceleration, but I\'ve
only just started to use them so I missed that one. Mea Culpa...

Have a look at the map of known space c1105 (Mike Peters did a great one as
a JPG IIRC) and the *shape* of the Consulate and the Vargr etc.

Bear in mind the Consulate has stable borders (and has done for a long time).

Expanding to the Claw means (1) leaving a large flank exposed to the Vargr
or (2) going through the Vargr, neither of which seems to make much sense.
The Frontier Wars were a limited action to stop/slow the imperium down.

Ultimately to dissuade the Imperium from being expansionist in their
direction. The Spinward Marches campaign details the FFW IIRC. But I
haven\'t got it to hand at the moment.

The figures already include a 6.25% profit on the owner\'s investment.
Where it deviates from canon is in the life support costs (lower) and in
including some non-standard insurance payments, which makes the ticket
prices a bit too low and the freight charges a bit too high. They also
use QSDS 1.5 designs and prices; I don\'t know how much difference FF&S2
makes to the cost and cargo space of ships.

Jump-5 would be a jump-3 (1,660) plus a jump-2 (1,170) = 2,830 (assuming
the freight is not time-critical). Jump-6 would be two jumps-3 = 3,320.

Me too. At the moment I assume that 99% of all shipping is by such
"super-freighters" and that every ship we\'ve ever seen described in
Traveller publications (up to and including the 5000 T Hercules
freighter) is part of the remaining 1% "luxury trade".

According to a character in a Dick Francis novel (_Proof_) alcohol ignites
at a percentage of 50+. This is supposedly the origin of the term "proof".
At 100 proof you can prove the fluid contains alcohol by setting it afire.

Sorry, the above exhausts my knowledge on the subject. ;-)

Personally I\'d allow them a good chance of making Molotails, but give them
an even better chance of messing up if they tried anything more fancy than
that. Even if such things as fluid air bombs and poor man\'s napalm is
_possible_ with kitchen chemistry, imagine the fun you can have with an
industrial accident involving such stuff! ]:->

Flamethrowers? Hook a steam engine driven pump to a supply of flammable
liquid and hose down your opponents. Great fun when the fuel tank is
accidentally set on fire.

Elite troops is an area where small countries have a chance to compete.
I\'m told that the Danish "Frogman Corps" is well thought of even by
the US and UK elite service. I\'ve no idea how much of that is patriotic
hyperbole.

I have a planet called Megaara in Menorial Subsector (just rimward of
Five Sisters) inspired by Pyrrus in the _Deathworld_ trilogy by Harry
Harrison. A sort of toned-down Dorsai, the inhabitants earn much of their
off-world currency by serving as mercenaries. They are bad dudes and not
suitable for PCs, but they make dandy antagonists. The character
generation tables allow them to get about 50% more skills than ordinary
characters (But their social lives suck :-).

I\'ve been working on the Spinward Marches in M:0 and I\'ve used the Luriani
as the first settlers on Algine.

Algine (2308 X766876-3 523 M9 VI)
Algine is the most unusual pre-Imperial settlement in that it has received
two distinct waves of settlers. The first was a group of Luriani fleeing the
Vilani Consolidation Wars; the second was a group of Solomani exiles from
the Iwahfauh sector who arrived in -1000. The resulting fusion has produced
a rich and unique culture.

The Luriani were the first Human settlers to reach the Spinward Marches.
They have their origins in the final stages of the Vilani drive on the
Luriani homeworld. When it became plain to the Luriani that defeat was
inevitable, their leaders resolved to attempt to ensure the race\'s survival
deep in uncharted space. Shortly before the final Vilani assault on the
Luriani homeworld, an evacuation fleet was organised and dispatched in -4514.
The fleet travelled from the Luriani homeworld in the Fornast sector, via a
circuitous route that took it through Antares, Lishun Meshan and Windhorn
sectors (there are records of a clash here with Vilani ships in -4509) and
then on into the Lurgaash in -4507. The fleet finally came to rest at Algine
in approximately -4500.

Fearing Vilani pursuit, the Luriani chose to establish a hidden settlement in
the equatorial rainforests. While this deception was successful, it was only
achieved at the cost of abandoning their advanced technology. Algine reverted
to tech level 1 and advanced little for another 3500 years. Over this period,
the settlers gradually forgot exactly how they had arrived, but they retained
a memory of their flight from an enemy and remained fearful of doom from the
skies. Eventually someone did come from the skies, but it was not to be the
Vilani seeking retribution.

During the Interstellar Wars, numerous Terran settlements were established
far beyond the Confederation\'s borders. Some of these were established in
what was to become the Iwahfauh sector. With the onset of the Long Night
these worlds were cut off from Terra and were gradually absorbed much Aslan
culture and eventually became part of the Hierate. In -1023 one such Human
world was conquered by the Khaukheairl clan and incorporated into the
Hierate. One Human regiment (the 7th Norgal Infantry) fought with such honour
and valour that the Khaukheairl resolved to allow them to retain their
independence. The regiment and their families were allowed to cross the Great
Rift and establish new land holdings. In -1004 the Aslan convoy transporting
them arrived in the sector and conducted a survey to find a suitable world.
Finally in -1000, the regiment elected to settle on Algine.

Since their initial settlement the Luriani had fragmented into numerous
tribes and by -1000 had achieved tech level 2. Their culture was still based
around the traditional Luriani precepts of honour and loyalty. The Luriani
warrior class had been kept alive by tribal raiding. To the Norgal Infantry,
lacking sufficient numbers to colonise an uninhabited world (they numbered
less than 500 families), Algine offered a culture much like their own and
their best chance for survival. With their superior technology the Norgal
were quickly able to establish dominance over the Luriani. The Norgal\'s
dominance was to be short lived, within four generations their technology
had failed and their dominion had come to an end. However in that brief time
they were to have a profound influence on Algine.

With the coming of the Norgal, Algine was united under a single world
government. Unlike the Itzin fleet on Darrian, the Norgal attempted to use
their technology to dominate the Luriani. However they lacked the depth of
technical knowledge to maintain their advantage for any length of time.
Within 120 years of the Norgal\'s arrival, the Luriani revolted against these
new overlords. This period is referred to locally as the Great Rebellion. It
lasted for 50 years and left no clear winner. The Norgal were unable to
retain control of the entire world, but the Luriani were unable to unite and
totally overthrow them. By -800 Algine had become a balkanised world. Most
nations were dominated by the Luriani culture, evolutions of the older
pre-Norgal tribes; but in some locations the former Norgal aristocracy
managed to survive; either by force of arms or by reaching an agreement with
the local Luriani. From this time the history of Algine has been dominated by
competition between these nations.

When the Imperial colonisation of the sector began in 60, Algine had evolved
two very distinct cultures. The older Luriani culture still remains,
dominating most of the world\'s nations. The old Norgal aristocratic culture
also survived, but in a much modified form, having absorbed much of the
Luriani culture.

The Luriani still retain much of their traditional culture (in many ways the
Luriani on Algine are closer to the traditional pre-Vilani Luriani culture
than the Luriani in Fornast), but are also influence by Solomani and Aslan
culture (via the Norgal). The basic Luriani code of honour and hospitality
is still adhered to, fallen enemies are respected. However they have now
embraced a much more Solomani attitude towards technology and the duelling
code is clearly Aslan inspired. To a Luriani, honour comes not from triumph
but from heroic efforts, their mythology is replete with heroic failure in
the face of overwhelming odds. The Luriani still retain the traditional
warrior class. When a Luriani reaches the age of 17 they are required to
serve three months as a warrior; most then move on to other careers. However
some find the "warrior\'s path" to their liking and chose to enter the warrior
class. These warriors form the basis of the Luriani military.

The Norgal on the other hand, have been far more influenced by the majority
Luriani culture. At the time of their arrival, the Norgal had absorbed much
Aslan culture (their sense of honour, gender differentiation, duelling code
etc.). However much of their old Terran culture still remained. Over time,
intermarriage has essentially erased the Norgal as a distinct biological
grouping, but they remain as a cultural division. The Norgal are
distinguished mainly by their Aslan derived gender differentiation, their
Solomani derived language and their strictly stratified social order. Upper
class Norgal males are exclusively warriors; and upper class Norgal females
are exclusively concerned with government and administration. Both hold to
the Norgal code of honour. Unlike the Luriani, the Norgal code of honour
holds triumph over effort, and thus is less flexible; an insulted Luriani
warrior can lose a duel with no loss of prestige provided they fought
bravely, a losing Norgal will always lose prestige. The Norgal culture is
very conservative, highly stratified, and generally quite oppressive. Lower
class Norgal are descended from the Luriani who remained under Norgal control
after the Great Rebellion. They have little or no say in their government,
though they do not have to adhere to the Norgal code of honour.

Linguistically Algine is truly fascinating. There are two major language
families present (the Luriani and Solomani). The Solomani family has
branched into at least twelve distinct languages whereas the Luriani family
has at least nine sub families which have given rise to several hundred
distinct languages. All Algine languages are a linguist\'s delight (or
nightmare) being a mix of Luriani, Solomani and Aslan influences.

ESTIMATING STARSHIP PASSENGER TRAFFIC

The following calculations are based on the assumption that it is possible to
get a mid passage on a regular passenger starship for Crimp5,000. This is a
price I\'ve arrived at after considerable calculations as a reasonable one for
a jump-1 fare (A jump-2 fare should cost 6,500, a jump-3 9,000, and a jump-4
13,500). They are also based on the assumption that the average yearly income
for a citizen is Cr10,000 (after taxes).

A round trip starship ticket costs Cr10,000, about a full year\'s income. At
that cost most people will at most make one off-world trip in a lifetime.
Propably a good part will not even do that. Just how many will depend, to a
large extent, on the cultural attitude to travel. I suggest that the number of
people per year that takes an off-world trip from a planet should be set to 1D
time 0.1% of the total population. In other words, if the die roll is 3, each
year 0.3% of the population takes an offworld trip. The die roll and the per-
centage was chosen with no real reason except that it sounds reasonable to me.

Example: A planet with a population of 30 million people. Die roll of 4. Each
year 4 * 0.001 * 30,000,000 = 120,000 people takes a trip. 

The less the local currency is worth, the less people can afford a starship
trip. So multiply the number above with the value of the local credit.

Example: Local credit is worth 0.6 Crimp. The number of passengers per year
in the example above would become 0.6 * 120,000 = 72,000.

Now it is time for a reality check. Ordinarily one would expect Class A star-
ports to have lots of traffic and Class E starports to have very little. To
some extent this has already been accounted for, since starport type usually
affects the value of the local currency, but there will still be cases where
the number of passengers and the starport class does not fit well together.
You will have to either a) adjust the starport class to the traffic, b) adjust
the traffic to the starport class, or c) find some creative explanation.

To figure out where the passengers go, find the starport type for the world and
for each of its neighbors. Consult the jump routes table. Four columns are
provided, corresponding to jump distances one through four. For each neighbor
determine the distance between the two worlds, and their starports. At the
intersection of the distance column and the world pair row, a number is stated.
If the one die roll is less than or equal to the number, a regular passenger
route between the two worlds exist. Note down the number you rolled; this
indicates the relative size of the route. (For those who recognize the table
from CT\'s Book 3, this is the reason for reversing the figures; the more
likely a connection, the bigger its relative size _may_ be).

Example: Checking for a route between two Class A starports two parsecs from
each other a 4 is rolled; there is a route between the two ports with a
relative size of 4. Checking for one between two Class C starports two
parsecs from each other another 4 is rolled; there is no regular route
between the two ports.

E-E	    1	    -	    -	    -

Before going on, reality check the figures again. If you get an unlikely
result, like a route sending hundreds of thousand of passengers to a neigh-
boring low-tech, low-population world, or a high-tech, high-population world
with a Class E starport generating hundreds of thousands of passengers with
no place to go, you should first try to think up an explanation for the
unlikely result (passengers to a low-tech planet may for instance be
tourists); but if you can\'t come up with a good explanation then you should
change something to eliminate the oddity.

Sum up the sizes of all the routes from the world and divide the total number
of passengers by it; the result is the basic number of passengers for a size 1
route. For each route multiply its size with the basic amount. This is the
final number of passengers if it is a jump-1 route. For a jump-2 route divide
the result by 1.3; for a jump-3 route divide by 1.8; and for a jump-4 route
divide by 2.7 (This reflects the greater cost of higher jump travel).

Example: Regina in 1117 has a population of 700 million people and its credit
is worth 0.85 Crimp (Imperial credit). If the die roll was 3, Regina would
turn out to have 3*700,000,000*0.85/1,000=1,785,000 locals as outgoing
passengers per year (and the same number of people returning). Regina is
within jump-1 of Ruie (starport type C), Jenghe (C), and Hefry (C), within
jump-2 of Forboldn (E), Yori (B), Extolay (B), Dinom (D) Dinomn (B),
Wypoc (C), and Djinni (X), within jump-3 of Knorbes (D), Roup (B),
Phlume (C), and Rech (D), and within jump-4 of Grant (X), Whanga (E),
Wochiers (E), Algine (X), Yurst (E), 871-438 (E), Tionale (C), and
KKirka (C). Rolling a die for each potential route we get the following
routes (and relative sizes): Ruie (4), Jenghe (2), Hefry (3), Yori (3),
Dinomn (2), and Roup (1). Reality-checking we lower the route to Ruie to 1
(it\'s outside Imperial borders and has an Amber Zone rating) and get a sum
total of 12. 1,785,000 divided by 12 gives a basic number of 148,750 (Which
must be adjusted for distance).


Neighbor     Die roll  Route   Size	*148,750	Adjusted

Ruie		4	Yes	1	 148,750	148,750

You now have the number of people going FROM the world to neighboring worlds
(and back) each year. But to determine the amount of passenger traffic a
system has one must remember to include all the people from neighboring
worlds that goes TO that system.

Example: The amount of passenger traffic between Regina and Roup is 82,640
Reginans PLUS an as yet undetermined number of Roupians.

Once you have the number of passengers you can decide the number of ships it
will take to carry them. There are two kinds of regular passenger liners. The
most usual one goes from the surface of one world to the surface of the other
world. Since they don\'t have to scrounge around for passengers the way tramp
ships do, they average one jump every 10 days or 35 jumps per year or 17.5
round trips per year. Each ship can therefore carry 17.5 times its passenger
capacity each year if it is always completely full. But since most ships
average 90% full each trip, you have to multiply by 0.9.

Example: A Type R Subsidized Liner carries 30 passengers. Such a ship will
carry 30*17.5*0.9=472.5 passengers per year. If the passenger traffic between
Regina and Roup were, say, 150,000, you could decide to have 150,000/472.5=
317 Type R liners handling it (More likely you\'d want some larger ships for a
route with that many passengers).

The second type of regular passenger liners are those that jump back and forth
between the jump limits of the two worlds (passengers travel to and from the
surface in passenger shuttles). Such a ship can manage a slightly faster turn-
around, doing a jump in 9 days on the average or 20 round trips per year.
However such ships can afford about 30% lower prices, so strictly speaking
you should multiply the passenger stream by 1.4 on such routes. Such ships are
found only on routes where both systems have space stations at the jump limit,
which usually means high-tech worlds with large populations and Class A or B
starports.

Example: A route between two high-tech worlds with Class A starports has been
calculated to have 1,000,000 passengers. Deciding that the traffic is from
jump limit to jump limit, the number is increased to 1,400,000.


LONG-DISTANCE TRAVEL AND OTHER COMPLICATIONS

This system assumes that almost all passenger traffic will consist of people
jumping to a neighboring system and returning some time later. It does not
account for people going farther afield. The number of Reginans, for example,
who can afford to go to Jewell or Aramis or Rhylanor is small, but there are
some who can. Nor does it account for one-way traffic (emigrants).

About 1% of all passengers embark on longer trips. The most usual ships to
cater to this traffic are ships like the Tukera Longliner with an average
passenger capacity around 40.

The best way to establish the number of long-distance passenger ships in a
sector is to calculate the number of passengers from high-population planets
in the sector (ignoring the effect of low- and medium-population planets).
Take 1% of this and divide by 40 to get the number.

Which is one of the reasons that a *lot* of folks think it\'d be a good
idea to detach the Warthogs from the Air Force and give them to the
Army. The AF just barely tolerates them (if it hadn\'t been for Desert
Storm, the AF would have replaced them with some hi-tech fighters that
had a "ground attack mode") and serving in them doesn\'t do your career
much good.

We are (mostly) "People of the Book"[1] here on the list, so I\'d *hope* we
could get along. :-)

However, I could have sworn that the Islamic calendar numbered years
since a major event in Mohammed\'s life? The Hegira, when he had to flee
Mecca.

The Romans used the years since the founding of Rome. The Byzantines
used the years since Creation (which they dated to about 5505 BC. The
current year in the Byzantine Era is 7506). The Jewish calendar uses
the "Jewish Mundane Era" which is also dated from Creation, but uses a
different starting date than the Byzantines.

I suspect that the Mayan Long Count was set up for astronomical
reasons. The Tzolkin (their 260 day "ceremonial year") may have been
based on conjunctions of Venus. And the Haab (civil calendar) was
mostly based on the actual year (it was a fixed 365 days, but they
*knew* it was out of synch with the actual length, their "correction"
involved the long count and was accurate to a really *ridiculous*
degree). 

For what it\'s worth, the Mayan Long Count "ends" Dec 21, 2012.
Actually, it just "rolls over" like an odometer. But it\'s still a
*very* significant event. The Long Count started Sep 7, 3114 BC. (It
was actually "started" about halfway thru the cycle, but that\'s the
"base date")

Makes sense. By the time you realize that the main chute didn\'t open,
you are too low for a reserve chute to open.

You\'ve missed the whole *point* of the *idea* of war crimes. It\'s to
get across the idea that the decision in such a case is *not* between
dying for principles and living without them. It\'s between dying for
your principles or dying for *not* following them.

What I would like to see is a much lower life support cost for all sorts
of pasages and for crew too. The Cr2000 per jump is far too high when
compared to standard living expenses. There are other problems too.
For instance, a passenger only spends about 9 or 10 days aboard a ship
while crew presumably live on board all the time. That ought to make
life support costs either 50% higher for crew or 33% lower for passengers.
The figures I use are:

Steerage passengers:            Cr 100
Economy passengers:             Cr 300
Crew and mid passengers:        Cr 400
High passengers:                Cr 500

Of this money Cr100 goes to pay for replenishing the life support system. The
rest goes to food (steerage passengers must bring their own food).

Note: Steerage passengers sleep in bunks; Economy passengers sleep in small
staterooms or two to a large stateroom. Mid and High Passengers as described
in the rules.

Depends on the storage technology used. With some, it may be possible
to recover data.

Also, you don\'t want *explosive* charges as they tend to scatter
pieces, and the pieces may be readable. Things like thermite work a lot
better. The charge can be in contact with the stroage medium, and thus
it only takes a little to render it unreadable (try reading *any* medium
after it has been dissolved in white-hot liquid iron!)

And this means that while the exterior may get hot enough to give you a
bad burn, it won\'t kill you to be nearby when the destruct charge goes
off. That makes folks a lot more *comfortable* about pressing that button.

I can just about *guarantee* that the results will either be unusable
or cluttered.

What you do *instead*, is print a pair of 2d maps. One maps the stars
onto an XY grid, the other onto an XZ or YZ grid. Join the maps on the
"shared" edge, so that the paper can be folded there to place the maps
in the correct relationship to each other. 

This is not perfect, but it is *workable*. 

It\'s also possible to do this with the XY grid being a hex grid. But
that means that the "common" side has to be the one with "columns" of
hexes.

The Norse were better known in the *eastern* Empire thasn the Western.
They spread up the rivers into Russia ("Rus" = "northman" = "viking"),
and then down other rivers into the Black Sea and on to Constantinople.
The Varangian Guard was composed of Norsemen.

While I doubt that thetre were any temples (the Norse never seemed to
go for that sort of thing), I have little doubt that there were plenty
of folks following the Norse gods.

Doesn\'t matter. If you get the *right* mix with air, it\'ll go "boom".
The thing is that the explosive limits (ie max %age mix with air that
goes "boom" and min %age mix with air that goes "boom") may be very
close together, making it rather hard to get the ratio right.

More to the point, things like *mustard gas* were initially discovered
at TL3 (really! Sir Humphrey Davies discovered them sometime in the
early 1800s. The British military filed them away as "too horrible to

get used in warfare until around TL5.

With late TL4 tech, it is quite possible (but *damn* difficult) to
build something along the lines of a V2 rocket! You just need to know
*how*, which is where the link to the ship comes in.

Liquid O2 is possible at TL4.

   There is a very good reason for that.  At 500 feet, there isn\'t time for
a reserve chute to open.

   Not to contradict you (since you are in contact with the primary source),
but I was under the impression that the incident in Iraq involved what were
thought to be Hip-Es (the gunship variant of the Soviet "Hip" transport
helicopter) not Hinds.  Blackhawks with the stub wing fuel pods *could*
theoretically be confused with the Hip-E from the wrong angle and at
sufficient range.

Well, it depends a lot on the temperature of the distillate. You ned
pretty high proof, like 151 rum, to ignite readily at room temp. On the
other hand all you need to do is warm it somewhat and you can get lower
proof liquors to ignite, witness crepes suzette. The rate of the burn is
going to be directly related to how mixed with air it is, which in turn is
determined by how volatile it is. Ethanol is volatile, but not as volatile
as, say, gasoline, it\'s a lot more likely to just burn than explode.

> make something like a fuel air bomb?

It would be _really_ hard. Ethanol is not really volatile enough to get
the kind of widely dispersed vapors you need for a FAE...you would have to
preheat it considerably. Also ethanol burns a LOT cooler than gasoline,
it\'s hard to sustain the burn rate you need for a FAE.

Now as molotov cocktails they\'re fine, just so long as you can keep your
troops from taste testing them regularly.

Now if they figure out how to make wood alcohol , ie: methanol, which is a
quite different process than normal distilling, those will make nasty
bombs. Methanol burns with a colorless flame, and burns hotter than
ethanol. Ask any race car driver...it\'s not fun to be in an invisible
fire.

>     Any other ideas for the use of distilling and such for purposes of warfare?

Sure, distill up a few barrels of it, and leave it on your enemies
doorstep the night before you attack! ;-) It\'s hard to fight through a
hangover!

My view of TNE got heavily tainted by reading the (pretty awful IMNSHO)

I\'ll take your advice and make up a NPC who is ex-military and who actually
honestly belive that all soldiers fight for peace and freedom. Whenever
somebody talks about anything vaguely related to war he\'ll burst: "Freedom
isn\'t free! It\'s paid for with the blood of patriots!" and when somebody
tells him that "Opression isn\'t free either! It\'s also paid for with the
blood of patriots!" they\'ll get into a barroom brawl that the NPC will win
most of the time (he fights dirty as he has survived a few wars).

He could get hired as a bodyguard, soldier etc but the real enigma for the
PCs to find out is wether he can take it or not when the shit hits the fan.

Too many psionic animals in Traveller. AAnolas, Beakers etc. Give the
players a seedspitter, they\'re clean, small, eat little, keep the flies
living in the ships locker at decent level and can take zero-G quite well.
Honest Jon at Bendor/Glisten orbital station sells small electroic targets
with artificial flies on them so that you can train your pet. He also sells
frozen flies that can be thawed out and will fly around a while before they
die of cell structure damage to amuse the pet. My PCs had 12 kg of these
flies in the fridge when somebody searched their ship for drugs and forgot
to close the fridge door.

The PCs arrived 8 hours later to find there starship shockful of flies and
a nearly spherical "Speedy" lying on the floor.

This is a really good question.  The short answer I believe is No.

The longer answer is....

RW, we no longer have battleships that can provide the type of pounding 
that was given during the amphibious landings of WWII or later in the 
shelling of the mountains in Lebanon.  The Imperial Navy I believe will 
have ships assigned the task of conducting the surface preparation.

Landings don\'t take place until you control of the battlespace.  During 
the landings at Normandy, we owned the sea and air.  Same with all 
Marine Corps landings.  I believe that the Imperial Marines will be in 
the same position, ie, that the landings won\'t be conducted until the 
covering forces of the enemy are driven off.  That is the responsibility 
of the Imperial Navy.

Ie, Marine Air which is assigned to a carrier (ship based) is owned by 
the Commander of the Task Force, until such time as it is transferred 
ashore.  That means, as you mentioned above, that its primary mission is 
defense of the Carrier Battle Group, and only unassigned missions will 
be given in support of ground combat operations.  Once ashore, it falls 
under control of the Landing Force Commander, with the obvious change of 
priorities.

I think that fighter bombers (Rampart IVs?) released from duties in 
space combat would be refitted for surface operations.  Drop forces 
would make a planethead and land heavy artillery.  This would relieve 
some of the pressure for continued Ortillery, and free up the Naval 
ships to move on to bigger and better things.  You would also need those 
logistics ships that I\'ve seen on the list to provide material for the 
conduct of surface operations.  And eventually, the Imperial Army would 
be brought in to conduct the extended planetary campaigns....

My, My, how passionate we are when confronted with the truth.  Only

that deep down inside we all know that there is a creator and that we
yearn to know the truth about Him.

It\'s quite easy to get Everclear (which I think is 150 proof) to ignite
by spraying it into the air in a mist.  I\'m not sure how explosive it
would be, but it makes for an impressive fireball.  (For a test, just
take a mouthful and spray it out while holding a cigarette lighter, lit,
in front of your mouth.  Aim a little high or you\'ll just put out the
lighter and soak your hand.  Don\'t hold the Everclear in your mouth too
long, though, or you\'ll absorbe the alcohol...)

I\'d be willing to pay the following amount:

        total amount spent = number of tickets issued x cost per ticket - 1

The \'-1\' is so my wife can buy a ticket.

Actually, from the context of the story (mass Soviet invasion through
Germany) this was in the bad \'ol Evil Empire days...the Soviets proabbly
already used them to soften up the front.

Most of the planning for US forces in those days utilized strategies like
this, since we were expecting to be vastly outnumbered by a strangely
massively superior Soviet Army. I say strangely, because we _did_ have
reliable intel to the effect that any Soviet advance could only get a few
miles before running out of fuel, since they didn\'t have widely dispersed
fuel depots. There was too much danger of the bulk of the fuel being
stolen and sold on the black market. And that was only _one_ of the
problems the Sovs would have had.

     Actually, having been exposed to the Nuremburg trials in 2 settings (as a
US Army MP and while getting my degree in Criminal Justice)  I have come to
the conclusion that the Trials were an absolute travesty of justice in many
ways.  They were simply the final defeat of the Axis powers....they had
nothing to do w/ justice.  A prime and oft-quoted example of this is the
conviction of Adm. Karl Doenitz, he was found guilty of Crimes against
Humanity for conducting an unrestricted submarine campaign.  However, Adm.
Charles Lockwood, USN, was nowhere to be seen!  His sub campaign did what
Doenitz\'s couldn\'t...it led directly to the defeat of a warring power.

This reminds me of the trip we took to Israel this summer.  Great fun. 
The barter economy, where there was no "set price" except in gov\'t 
approved stores, meant that everything could be had for a price, and 
depended on your ability to bargain.  My wife and I purchased a 
beautifully crafted backgammon set (original price about $200+) for 
$95...and probably could have gotten it $5 or $10 cheaper...  Many other 
things were bought, and prices compared to others in the group...  "You 
paid how much?!  I only paid XX!"  (or vice versa :-()

One of the bonuses of the tour was a day in Jerusalem where we could do 
whatever we wanted.  My brothers and I, and our wives (we each only have 
1) :-) went into the christian sector (meaning "not muslim") where the 
natives purchase things.  No tourist traps.  We had a ball, but wished 
we had some kind of jargon for ourselves as the merchants all spoke 
Arabic and English, and we had no other common language amongst us.  In 
fact, we talked about learning sign language before we go on another 
trip like this, or at least practising pig-latin....

OO-tay Uch-may!  Way oo-tay uch-may!  :-)

We needed something to put us on an even footing!

Cheers!
Greg

   I hear Kelly Flynn recently got a job at the White House.  The job

physically demanding, because she was issued knee and elbow pads as soon as

I thought about that, too. This solution has the additional advantage of only
requiring two maps for a sector (instead of four for an isometric shape).

Yes, that would be a big advantage, wouldn\'t it? ;-)

Not necessarily. It would look better, though. In the german RPG magazine 
\'Wunderwelten\'
there was an article about a space combat tabletop named \'Astrotech\'. They extended
it to 3D space, used a hex grid and didn\'t join the two maps on the column side. Looked
not very elegant, but that is a matter of taste (IMHO)

What would you use? Cartesian coordinates or hex? (Hex looks cool while Cartesian 
coordinates
are more accurate IMHO)

If I was single my answer would be the same as Harolds.  However, being 
one who is married, and having four children, I seem to fight a moral 
battle with myself every time I think of spending money that could be 
better spent on something for one of them.  I am afraid that after

$0.00.

I\'ve been trying to figure out an easy way of representing this in a
closest-packed arrangement, as opposed to the inelegant compromize of
hexes xy and columns ("squares") in the z-plane.

Basically, it\'s a hex grid on both the xy and the yz planes. Each parsec
would be connected with 12 others: Six surrounding on xy plane, 3 above,
and 3 below.

xy planes adjoining on the z-axis "slip" slightly, so the centres of the
hexes fall on the vertices of the adjoining plane. Anybody who\'s stacked
golf balls, marbles, oranges, or any other round object knows what I
mean.

Making this relationship clear on two dimensional surfaces is
"non-trival". :-) hmmm... maybe one should find some crystal lattice
models in a science hobbyist store. You could count the number of
connecting struts between point A and B to find the jump number. No trig
required. :-)

Say! You could also use different coloured struts for trade routes,
different coloured vertices for asteroid mainworlds, no fuel, hi pop.
etc. Those on tight budgets can use marshmallows and toothpicks.

Where did I leave that Jitterbug...

1. OK, I know what the Lifesupport costs of a High, Mid, and Low Passage
passenger are.  What are the costs of Lifesupport for the crew?  I\'m
looking for the Lifesupport overhead costs for running a ship, the part
of the Lifesupport that isn\'t paid for by a paying passenger. 
Obviously, you must have lifesupport for the control room, crew\'s living
space, engine room, etc.  Also, for most smaller tradeships, you must
run lifesupport in the cargo hold as well, because it is also the
passageway from forward to aft.

2. Obviously, part of the costs of running a ship include the fuel
costs.  But there should be other costs as well.  Docking fees.  Minor
repairs.  Cleaning costs.  Drinking water.

3. Seems to me that part of the duties of the Steward would be
purchasing the food and other consumables for the passengers and crew. 
How would these expenses be figured.  If the Steward can get a good deal
on supplies ("Heh, this tastes *nearly* as good, at half the cost!  The

Now that is true.  And Hinds are nasty choppers.  Nevertheless...the

   I was not so much Marine bashing as making a point about tactical
mentality.  The Marines by nature are infantry shock troops--walk right up
to the enemy, grab him by the nose, and kick his ass.  If his ass can\'t be
kicked, make him pay for every inch of ground he takes.

   The Army does things differently.  This in part stems from the fact that
the Army emphasizes mobile warfare, with mech units rolling through and
around the enemy as quickly as possible (Marine divisions would be
classified as light infantry in the Army--ground pounders--with perhaps some
cav units attached).

   That\'s because they were/are an elite infantry force fighting against
other infantry forces.  They could not and would not, for example, be
expected to take a piece of ground away from a Russian armored division and
defeat it in detail--for that job you want an Army mech division.

   Absolutely.

\'Fraid I must disagree.

The most efficient shape to fill 3d-space is the tetrahedron. Nature
uses a 60 degree coordinate system, not a 90 degree Cartesian coordinate
system.

Buckminster Fuller discovered that if we were to convert from a
cartesian coordinate system to a 60-degree coordinate system (12
vertices around one, which he called Vector Equilibrium), we would not
need to use all kinds of irrational constants such as pi...

Oh, one would never want to do that, now would one?!? :-)


Okay, I wanted to quip, but I feel obliged to start a new thread because I
don\'t want to be completely non-Trav (like those religious posts are
getting to be). So...

Belters and mining.

I have read numerous statements to the effect that refuelling at a gas
giant is a bad idea. I assume this is because it takes a lot of resources
to get to a gas giant, which in turn garners you more cost than just buying
the dang fuel at regular prices. Can the same argument be made about
belters? Especially those using those Type-S Seekers, the ones with the
laser drill?  First of all, doesn\'t it take more than just a laser drill to
get valuable raw materials from an asteroid? You have to process it,
correct? So if you just chop up a bunch of rock and load your hold, to take
it back to base to get it processed, isn\'t this going to be expensive?
Especially considering the ratio of junk rock to valuable ore? How do those
belters make money, anyway?

Oh, BTW. Hans, I enjoyed your post of passenger traffic levels. Good show.

And as for the poll taken a couple of days back:

MT/Rebellion.

Actually, I use the FUDGE rules for my games now, and I run pretty
cinematic games. The Rebellion is great for a Star Wars type of space opera
setting: lots of villians, big ships, and all sorts of hell breaking loose.

I don\'t want to start a flame war, but I have a sincere question:

Is it fair to say that the Marines would be the combat force meant to
"take possesion" of territory held by enemy forces and the Army is meant
to "keep" or hold a territory once taken?

The mission of the Army seems obscure to me now.  Maybe we should have
the Navy, Marines, and Air Force absorb the role of the Army in this day
and age.

As far as I see it 

A character with JOT 4 would have all skills
available to them at level 2. (JOT 4-2)
Therefore they would be

Pilot 2
Engineer 2
Naval Arch 2
Demolitions 2
BattleDress 2
Recon 2
Computer 2
Tactics 2
etc


Surely some skills would be harder for a well
rounded person to grasp and therefore would have
a futher minus.  Say a Pilot might be -4 and a
Demolitions expert might be -6 to the JOT skill.

Does anyone have any comments

I think the ancients just had an underwater world with grav generators

Actually Everclear is 200 proof, unless they sell a toned down version
where you live. 100% ethanol, which upon exposure to air rapidly drops to
97% due to ethanols hygroscopic nature. 

I think this is the clearest answer you\'ll ever get...No, ethanol won\'t
make a decent FAE. Otherwise you would risk a LOT more than singed
eyebrows doing this stunt.

It caused Japan to surrender in a matter of days.  I can\'t think of
any more suitable military objective.  Anything else is a matter
of semantics.  The fact is that the US was attacked and had
the right to defend itself with priority to saving its own
people.  The bombing of civilian targets was something that
all sides did and Japan helped set a precedent for.

Here\'s how I\'ve always pictured it.

The lone Belter, with his seeker, finds some ore. Using special equipment on
the seeker, he extracts a large sample of said ore. He ventures out in his vacc
suit and puts a beacon on the rock. The beacon identifies the ore as his. He
then installs a small 0.01G maneuver drive, with a couple of days fuel. This is
used to move the ore sample toward the nearest processing station. He doesn\'t
use his cargo hold for this because a believable sample will be too large to
fit there.

The Belter then zips off to that station and stakes a claim. The claim is
tentatively sold to a large mining firm, which has the necessary equipment to
completely mine out the asteroid. When the ore sample gets there, it is used as
proof of the validity of the claim.

Note that the maneuver drive on the rock just accelerates. It doesn\'t turn
around halfway and decelerate because that would be a waste of time and would
require a computer. The processing station will have a mass driver that can
decelerate the rock. Another way is to simply match velocities with the rock,
"board" it, and install a larger (say, 2G) maneuver drive, which will slow it
down.

The Belter doesn\'t mine the whole rock; he hasn\'t got the equipment for that.
He does, however, collect royalties from the mining company to whom he sold the
rock.

I like this scheme because:
a) it means the independent miner needs little more than a small spacecraft and
some rudimentary mining equipment to get going
b) it fits in with the Niven concept of a belter, which I\'m fond of

The problem with it is that the mining equipment on the seeker has really never
been detailed in any Traveller rules that I\'ve seen. Neither has the tiny
maneuver drive that is needed.

These scheme only works if there is already a processing station in the system
when the belter gets there. If he\'s the first one doing any mining, he needs
much more equipment.

Considering a Naval warship - even a Destroyer - has enough firepower 
to devastate an entire planet, it\'s vitally important that the CO is 
sane and following orders. OTOH it\'s also important to maintain 
discipline and respect the chain of command.

The Captain can be relieved under the following conditions:

1. He is medically incapable (either physically or mentally) of 
command, as certified by the Chief Medical Officer and agreed by at 
least 2/3 of the Command Staff.

2. He issues illegal orders. This must be agreed by the Executive 
Officer and at least 2/3 of the Command Staff.

Note that an unsuccessful challenge to the Captain\'s authority is 
mutiny, the normal punishment for which is death.

See Feintuch\'s Seafort Saga books for some discussion of this.

I think that you may have confused a growing Imperium with a stable Democracy.
Remember, an Imperial government is just a nice word for a dictatorship.  Even
if, and I think it unlikely in the early days of the Imperium, it was an
enlightened form of Monarchy (implied by the Moot of the latter Imperium),
ultimately power rested in the hands of Cleon.  He had just crowned himself, and
would still be consolidating power.  I seriously doubt that whatever security
arm he had empowered with internal security of his realm would allow for popular
dissent.

For a historical example, let us look at the Stalin purges of the late 30\'s.

As I interpreted the \'canon\' sources - the Imperium forced the \'Rules of War\' on
it\'s client members and free mercenary groups.  Imperial Forces, however, were
quite exempted from them.  As I currently run them, System Defense Forces are
armed with nuclear weaponry, but it requires the order of an Marquis to
interfere with a lawful planetary government (Cluster/SubSector Level
administration), and must be confirmed by the Duke (Sector Level), at least
after the fact...

Considering the potential for social advancement through the military (Marines
notwithstanding), I would tend to think that the Imperium is _very_ military
oriented!

The best explanation I\'ve heard for Noah\'s deluge related it to memories of the end of the last Ice Age. The Mediterranean Sea basin was nearly empty, and had been for thousands of years. The shallow valley at the west end (Gibraltar) was enough to keep the oceans out. With the rise of the world ocean levels (all that water not locked up in ice any more), sea level breached Gibraltar and created the largest waterfall in history. What was it like for the people living in the foothills of Mount Crete or Mount Cyprus? This waterfal was so far away that it wasn\'t even distant thunder, but that nearby sea suddenly began to rise at the rate of miles per day. Imagine how many people took refuge from this flood on the highest hill they knew of, and drowned as the water level took this as well?  Those who survived did so by running for their lives farther than they had ever travelled, with everything they knew vanishing forever behind them.

The Mediterranean Basin was one of the most highly populated areas of the world at that time. The stone age peoples affected by this catastrophe told the tale to their children, and the tale was handed down to become part of the legends of many peoples - even the peoples near the source of the Nile had heard of it.

Obtrav: Many worlds are at TL3 or less and lack long range communications. How do you inform the populace of a spaceborne plague, invasion or other disaster in a timely fashion? Imagine a Scout/Courier buzzing friendly native encampments with PA system blaring....

a small .01 G M-drive, fuel to feed it, a computer to control it, sensors to let
it track it progress and compare it to where it should be, etc...

I would also, as a DM, take issue with the lone miner just slapping this stuff on
a hunk of ore and having it fly with no calibration, testing, etc...

I like this idea - it makes a lot of sense.  But why is the mining company using
independant scouts?

Hope it doesn\'t miss the mass driver.  Hope the ore has enough ferrous material to
react to magnetic fields.  Hope nobody intercepts and \'fiddles\' with the controls
to turn it into one of those infamous \'near-C\' rocks, broadcasting the unfortunate
miner\'s transponder code all the way in...

A seeker has a fairly large hold - I think that it would be capable of taking a
suitable sample back without adding the complexity of sending the sample
unattended.  Also, if you consider the miner just smashing/cutting/reducing
asteroids to load up his holds, then taking the ore to a processing plant (and
paying the processors a percentage of what is extracted), it might make more
sense.  In that way, the mining corporation, or co-op, makes it\'s money on
processing, and perhaps in brokerage for the sale, without risking assets in
extraction or loss in exploration.

I can be terribly cheaper.  You only pay an independent scout if he
finds something.  A salaried scout would need a salary, life support, a
ship, fuel, etc.  Better to let an independent take the risks and pay
only for useful information.

I agree there is a lot of class distinction in the IMilitry, but too
much stratification will result in a military that will not work against
any major external threat.  Mid level technicians and line officers much
be competent and relatively motivated.

They certainly could not repulse the Solomani in the Rim War with
infighting between classes.  And there would be with that level of
strata.  

Now Captains and Admirals having to have SS to get commands is a

I hate to chime in on such an off-topic thread, but at least one of
the two cities had shipyards and both were industrial sites.  Winning
a war is just as much a matter of defeating enemy soldiers as it is
destroying the enemy\'s ability to produce weapons...

This is a misconception, but an easy one to make.  Jump-1 merchant
ships have two great advantages -- they\'re the least expensive to
buy, and they can carry the highest payload to fuel ratio, where 
payload is passengers, freight, cargo, and mail.  However, there\'s
also a problem.  Jump-1 ships have a very short range, which means
they have fewer systems to choose from when jumping from any world
in particular.  If you need to make two jump-1 hops to reach a 
world, you lose time (and time is money -- you could have sold a
cargo and started on to the next world).  It\'s also harder to make
one-jump connections to worlds where you can get a lot of freight
or make a lot of money on speculative cargo.  It\'s very difficult
to make a profit visiting some worlds; others are both great to
sell at and to buy at.

In THUDDD-8, there was a set of six worlds which each had to be
visited once before any could be visited twice.  By using a jump-3
ship, it turned out that a more profitable speculative trade route
could be followed.  This was despite the fact that the ship cost
50% more and carried 20% less cargo than a jump-2 ship of the same
displacement.  (On the other hand, it\'s very possible that jump-4
would be too expensive to be worth it in that cluster.)  

It all comes down to what the local worlds are like, and I suspect 
that the most profitable market for a world\'s goods will often be 
more than jump-1 away.

As an example, a jump-1 ship can reach six hexes; jump-2 can reach
eighteen; jump-3, thirty-six; and jump-4, sixty.  Each time we add
drive, the odds improve that a very profitable destination is in
range.  Of course, this is countered by a increase in expenses and 
loss in revenue with each improvement to the jump drive.  If there
is a great world at one parsec, the jump-1 ship wins, hands down.
But I\'d guess that for most normal sectors, there\'s going to be 
more profit potential for a reasonably higher-jump ship.  How much
higher would clearly depend on the worlds in question.

 I really and truely think that this thread has stepped over the bounds at this
point.  This is the TML, and I see absolutely nothing pertaining to TRAVELLER,
the science fiction GAME in this post.

The way I play JoT:

I mainly try to keep its use to the \'fuzzier\' skills, like academics, arts,
and skills of that type, because of the way that I \'picture\' JoT working.  The
character doesn\'t have training in everything, she just picks stuff up
quickly, and has lots of natural aptitude in a number of fields.  

She may not be able to write a computer program \'from scratch\' at a computer
terminal, but she did do a little programming back in college, and given
enough time, and access to the proper materials, she could probably slug her
way through it.  

He\'s not a licensed gravitics technician, he surely doesn\'t know enough to get
a certification...  but, his dad did tinker with speeders a bit when he was
younger, and he would watch intently.  Given enough time to sit down and look
at a couple of diagram\'s on the ship\'s computer, he might be able to \'patch
up\' the crew\'s Air/Raft, at least until they finish this prospecting job.

Maybe, instead of making a task harder when performed with JoT, make it more
time consuming.  Also, make sure that, if applicable, the use of the skill is
\'only temporary\' unless it is a spectacular success.  The woman referred to in
paragraph one might be called upon to write a virus that\'ll shut off the
security system in a lab the PCs are infiltrating.  She might be able to write
one, given enough time, but it\'ll only be able to \'spoof\' the system for a
couple of minutes.  The man referred to in the second paragraph may fix the
Air/Raft, only to have it break down a few days later, and require another
fixing job.

It might also help to slide failures further on up the scale, to illustrate
what I mean:

A rating 3 pilot has some time flying under her belt, and knows considerably
more about the way planes handle.  If she were bringing in a damaged plane for
a landing, a failure might indicate a crash landing, and a spectacular failure
might mean that the plane outright crashes...

Another pilot, with JoT-5 (functioning as pilot 3) played a lot of flight
sims, and maybe piloted a light commuter aircraft a couple of times when his
girlfriend (the pilot in the above example) let him.  He has never performed a
take off or a landing.  In an emergency, he\'s forced to take over.  A
spectacular success indicates that he has landed the plane, a success means he
has crash landed the plane, and failure (normal or spectacular) means that
he\'s crashed the plane.

Just some ideas.

    'body' => 'First bit is not directly Traveller related, but it leads up to a Traveller
question towards the end of the message:

Some of the previous talk about rebels and revolutionaries got me to start
thinking about the counter-culture movement of the 60s in the United States,
and its counterparts in other parts of the world (not the entirely
whitewashed, "love, flowers and LSD" romanticized version of history).  This
got me thinking further about how, at least in the 20th century, music,
literature and art are often tied in with political ideas and ideals.  The
variety of bands in the late 60s were intrinsically tied in with the
revolutionary elements of society (the terrorist organization "the Weathermen"
aka the "Weather Underground" took their name from a Bob Dylan song, a similar
organization "Up Against the Wall Motherf*****s" took their name from a
Jefferson Airplane song), a pattern which continues to this day (\'nazi\'/racist
skinheads in several countries tend to like the same bands, and rap groups are
tied in with the politics, and living conditions, on the streets).

In these counter-culture groups, there is a web of music, film and literature
that are all tied in together and mesh in a weird way.  And bands, or groups
of bands espouse certain beliefs that seem to hit a chord in certain people,
who already may like certain movies, books and lifestyles, or who may get
interested in these things by exposure to the bands and their fans...

Now, what I\'m basically getting at is this:  What is the state of
entertainment in the Traveller universe?  Are there movies or movie analogs?
Have \'holodecks\' taken the place of movies?  Does holodeck style entertainment
exist?  Is there television or a television analog?  Are there still shock-
style talkshows?  If so, are there Sayat or Spofulam types on every episode?
:^)  How are movies (or their analogs) distributed in the 3I?  What effects
does the J-Space lag have on the spread of such media (as an example, there
are those here on earth who are constantly into \'the newest thing\'.  It would
be tough to get into the newest trends, fashions, etc. from the Imperium\'s
core when you\'re in the Spinward Marches).  Would there be a certain amount of
ridicule or snubbing of \'older\' fashions as there is today among the style
conscious?

Is there still \'radio\'?  What kind of music do you think there is this far
into the future?  Music seems to be getting more and more extreme every year
here on earth, what heights (or depths, depending on your point of view) has
music reached?  Is \'interactive\' music a reality by the time of the 3rd
Imperium (what I mean by interactive music is, say, music that reacts to its
surroundings, creating a complex and intricate web of noise and music based on
a room rigged with sensors; sit in the chair, and there\'s a subtle shift in
the beat; answer the vid-phone, and the music switches to something mellow,
inoffensive, and quiet; temperature changes change the music subtly, or maybe
not so subtly depending upon the tastes of the purchasers)?

I don\'t want right or wrong type answers really, I mean, I guess I\'d like to
see different types of entertainment that everybody\'s come up with, and more
importantly, its impact on the society of the Imperium.  Granted, there are
thousands of individual mainworlds throughout the Imperium, with a wide
variety of tech levels...  But, I like to think that there is an \'Imperial\'
culture that will exist in \'startowns\', fuedal technocracies, and the like, a
culture that the PCs will constantly run into again and again...

What type of stuff is going on in everyone elses\' heads?

The US side also had their own problems, such as the USN thinking it had a
war-winning role, as opposed to the dull performance of just getting the US
Army to Europe.

Most of the reliable sources I\'ve seen also imply that NATO wasnt as
outnumbered as the NATO military argued, but it suited the corporate
interests of the various militaries to argue this, sometimes by
intellectual dishonesty like including spare tanks in the Warsaw Pact tank
figures but forgetting the tanks in the replacement pools when counting up
NATO tank numbers.

Bringing this ObTrav, I can see Admirals arguing for more funds and
claiming the Reserve Fleets shouldnt be counted in combat strength, and the
Imperial Finance Ministry needing to hire a small, discreet group who know
a Particle Accelerator from a Science Sensor to go to a base with an
appropriate paperwork and do an audit of the combat readiness of the
reserve ships. Or perhaps an agreement between the Admirality and the MoF,
where if a group of half-trained reservists can get a random destroyer
started, through a series of four jumps and a gas giant refuelling, and
then complete a complete weapons test, then the Admirality really doesnt
need another 100 gigacredits, and can get by with fifty.

Of course, to avoid the crew being got at, there are no observers on board
- - just the crew, and a set of sealed orders.

Geeez, it\'d be a real shit if they misjumped and had to get back across the
border in a ship that was in mothballs until last month ...

For what it\'s worth, my view is that you can only understand the
orginisation, doctrine and procurement of the 3 and a half US services
within the context of their main enemy, against whom their orginisation,
doctrine and procurement are designed, as being each other.

It isnt rational. It would have awful concequences in a real war. It leads
to many, many silly decisions.

But it\'s the simplest answer that answers the most facts. 

Bringing this back ObTrav, I believe that the Imperial armed forces would
have such conflicts, although the lack of a democratic government may make
them weaker. The Imperial Marines, for example, would want their own
Ortillery. The Navy would want to keep the Marines as a wholly-controlled
subsiduary. The various Planetary armed forces may well create
"Expiditionary Forces" which will only be released as a package - I am
thinking of the Australian demands for control of their own forces in WW1
and WW2 and the New Zealanders determination in WW2 not to be integrated
into ANZAC formations.

There may also be incidents of units refusing support from "unacceptable"
sources - "We are the Horse Guards. Our artillery is the Royal Horse
Artillery Sir".

Not bad, but a wee bit flagrant, if you\'ll pardon my saying so.  Subtlety,
subtlety, subtlety!  You guys have been spending too much time among the

fundamentalist Christians (and, potentially I supposed, Muslims and Jews)
to account for a literal interpretation of the flood myth of Genesis. It is
not based on known science. More of a religious exercise of faith. Like
saying that the mana God provided in the wilderness was, in fact, caused by
asteroid showers. (Someone who couldn\'t tell carbyhydrates from
hydrocarbons).

Anyway, although as commonly described it is scientifically impossible, if
you are looking for a similar situation there are some possibililties you
can use.

There are certain lakes in Africa which remain largely undisturbed for many
years. Chemical layers build up within them along strict vertical
stratifications. When something happens to destroy the equilibrium (a small
earth tremour or landslide) a catastrophic turbulent reaction can happen
which causes violent mixing of the layers. In one notable incident toxic
gases which were disolved in one layer rose to the surface where they
escaped into the air, "flooded" downhill, and engulphed a village causing
many deaths.
[From an article in New Scientist called "Africa\'s Deadly Lakes" I think.]
     Extrapolating from this, consider a planet with a dense atmosphere and
a similar situation. Different gasses that might otherwise react kept
separate by strict stratification. If the weather is normally boring there
won\'t be much to disturb it. If the dynamics are solid enough, things like
starships, and jets might not make much of an impression. But, say, there
was a volcanic eruption (unlike if it was stable enough to form), or an
asteroid strike, that might provide enough mixing for a chain reaction to
start. If there was, say, a hydrogen layer and an oxygen layer, you might
get a sudden ocean after one hell of a firestorm.

     One of the planet details in (I think) the Galactic dataset (by Rob
Dean?) described a planet where a genetically manipulated bean had the side
effect of producing a noxious gas. The plant was quite successful (it
gassed its competitors!) and spread at a geometric rate. Within 5 years the
low lying areas of the planet were uninhabitable.

My problem with the decision to use the nukes was that things had got to
the stage where there was no enormous need to rush such a decision,
especially when it was known that the nukes were a completely new phenomon.
I suspect the fact that the Soviets were about to get in on the act had
something to do with it, and giving them an object lesson quite a lot more.

Having just borrowed and read Melieu 0, I strongly agree with you. The IISS
and megacorps do so much meddling that there\'s bound to be quite a high
stuff-up rate, and guess who\'s going to be picking up the pieces? The whole
Imperial Drive relies on the military being there to back it up, and on
having lots of naive young men willing to go out and die for the profit of
others. It\'s John Bull Company & the Indian Army all over again.

I don\'t recall whether or not the Melieu 0 fans were those who found TNE
morally dubious, but I hope not because for all the looting and
decapitation raids the Coalition did, at least they honestly thought it was
for the good of the wilds populations, whereas in Cleon\'s New Galaxy Order
something is good if it profits the Imperium. Sure they talk about long
term good and leaving worlds to rule themselves, but that only applies when
they have joined the 3I (often because it\'s destroyed their economies
stability) and it would cost money to run them directly.

Sorry about the above diatribe, but I\'d always thought of the (later) 3I as
a bit grubby, but not too bad as powerful governments go, but now it\'s just
like the empire in Space Master - explictly evil, in its early years anyway
(maybe I can convince myself that the civil war did for the families
responsible).

At the very least an army defends a country, something an airforce and navy
can only do if the enemy can\'t get a their bases. If you are an island
nation like England then, like England historicaly you don\'t need much of
an army. However this policy (being followed fairly religously here in NZ)
can get you in a lot of trouble if the political scene changes quickly -
look at WWII.

David and others,

This was Truman\'s logic. Like I said, it was his call, and I wont call his
call wrong.

Firstly, if the bombings were against military targets, then why not Tokyo
? If they were a demonstration, then why not a mountainside ?

However ... was it the Bomb that caused Japan to surrender, or the entry of
the Soviet Union into the war, which (as the Japanese saw it) closed off
their last option for a negotiated, Conditional surrender, cause the
surrender ?

If the US had merely continued the blockade but not invaded, would the
peace party have had enough support to take over the government ?

Finally, had the US offered the deal that in the end went down (i.e. the
trial of the War government, and the surrender of the Emperors divinity but
not his trial, execution or imprisonment), would the War party have
survived, given a guarantee of the safety of the Imperial Person that the
US offer would have involved, and the risks to the Imperial Person in an
invasion ?

The Imperium seems to respect Honour and Right Behaviour. What I am
describing is not popular dissent per se ... it is a moral argument by
someone who most people, even most military, would respect as having the
right to make their points.

I think the view would be as long as the figure is arguing in Admirals
Meetings and at Ducal Dinners and the like, and not arguing against the
Imperium but against Imperial Policy, then the dissent would be permitted.

An Imperial government can also be a democracy, or have democratic elements
- - the British Empire is the most obvious example.

I think that doesnt really fit given the numbers kicked around for the
Imperial military expenditures, it\'s lack of aggressive wars after the
initial expansion ended, and the high relative cost of equipment vs
personell, especially in the Navy.

There just wont be that *many* people involoved in the Imperial forces.

I crunched out the numbers for a D starport TL8 world using Striker book 2,
and translated the US average income ($20 000) into the Cr income, and got
a number of about forty US dollars to one Imperial Credit.

Personally, I think the exchange rates would be more extreme ... a TL8
world has a wish list a mile long for TL12 goods, and not a hell of a lot
of exports.

It\'s not exact, but that\'s the essential way of it.

The Marine Corps doctrine of "a force in readiness" dictates that they be
able to respond to a threat anywhere in the world within 48 hours, bringing
everything needed to sustain operations for a minimum of 2 weeks.
Naturally, additional supplies and munitions can be provided for longer
stays, but that\'s what they bring initially.

The Army has the raw manpower needed for large scale follow on operations,
be it static defense, offence, etc. This is not to say that the Army hasn\'t
secured a "beachhead" or two in their day, but their response time is
generally slower, and their supply train takes a while to get moving.

an Aubani  Corporation was in league w/ the Aubani Merchant Marine/ Belt

hit the strike during character creation and w/ the rise of the Reformation
Coalition from the Dawn League, the AMM decided to liquidate the 80+ year old
ship and invest on new ones.  The corp kept their 40% gained about 10% due to
a contractual clause.  The rest reverted to the Belter (and indirectly through
contacts and "special adventures") to the other players.  I converted their
ship DMs into what % of the ship they owned. This way, the Belter didn\'t get
his own ship (but a large chunk of it) and all the other players own (about
4-5%) of the ship, giving them all an interest in it. Further there\'s a corp
that owns near half the ship and demands their hunk of the profits (and a
small freight operation). The players are hoping to get another strike or
something so they buy the rest.
    Ob the topic at hand.  Belters could both work for a corp or have worked
for one.  One thing to consider is the "mining" laser.  It\'s always been

I wouldn\'t bet on that. The Royal Navy was very good at fighting, if not
ship design, and it had a very stratified system, with discipline that was
brutal even by world naval standards along with enforced pressing. 

The old CT book (I forget the name) that detailed the Gazelles mentioned
the risk of mutiny and how the officers\' quarters and control areas are
seperate from the crew quarters. Besides what\'s the point of being a knight
or noble if it doesn\'t do you or your children some good.

Yes, it was funny the way the USAF used say how good their planes and
pilots were on one hand, and then say how many Soviet planes there were and
how the new Soviet planes were so dangerous on the other. All the while
(because airpower is the way, the light and the truth) downplaying the real
problem - that Soviet armoured divsions carried SAMs like a cat carries fleas.

And of course claiming that a newly contacted PE is a threar with no
evidence one way or the other, or that it naval tonnage is x Magatons and
TL11, neglecting to mantion that the TL11 ships only constitute 5% of the
fleet the rest being old TL9-10 ships that would be lucky to be called
spaceworthy in the 3I, let alone combatworthy.

Understandable of the Marines, afterall who wants their support to suddenly

Yes. This unit would need a minimal power plant (because that\'s where the M drive fuel
comes from). I\'m not sure that it would need a computer, since it doesn\'t need to
steer. It\'s basically an unguided missile under constant acceleration. By the same
reasoning, sensors aren\'t needed.

The Belter, once he\'s attached the unit to the rock, would link it to his seeker\'s
computer (there are a number of ways to do this). He then gets an approved vector from
the traffic control folks, aims his rock in the appropriate direction, and fires it
up.

These units should (must!) be cheap, and there fore plentiful. I was thinking of them
as akin to disposable lighters. If you buy one and it\'s broken, you just throw it away
and slap another one on. Of course, this may not be reasonable given the prices for
M-drives.

Because it\'s cheaper than paying employees to do it for you.  After all, if a belter
does it, you don\'t have to pay him unless he actually finds something and only then if
the find is worthwhile! For this reason, the belters are better motivated than
employees would be.

Missing the mass driver, or not having enough ferrous material to be handled by the
driver are problems that are solved by simply getting a faster ship to slow it down
using the other method I mentioned. The \'near-C\' rock danger issue is small, since
it\'s not going THAT fast, and everybody in the system will know where it is and where
it\'s headed.

That\'s true. However, it only works for small-volume rocks, which the processing plant
can\'t be bothered to go out and mine. For large (100,000 tons, say) asteroids, they
will send out their own large-scale mining teams. In those cases, the method I propose
makes more sense, since larger samples are better indicators of ore content.

Also, having the belter chop up his own samples (before putting them into his hold)
introduces the risk that the belter will salt the samples. Sending a large, untouched
rock directly to the plant minimizes the risk of salting.

Hmmm, 

I\'ve always considered this to be a difficult-to-accept assertion.  

Exactly what weapons does it have (the 33000 ton destroyer which
is about 155m long) have that can "devastate" anything.  Nuc missiles
yes (vs. planetary point defenses no).  750 MJ lasers?  No significant
effect.

Heck, even a type T spinal mount only has about a 0.869 kiloton yield.
(That\'s about 869 tons TNT equivalent.  Avery small nuclear scale
blast, smaller than most modern tac nukes.

OK, so divide these numbers by 1.05 to get
Jump-1       840
Jump-2      1425
Jump-3      1980
Jump-4      2580

Well, I am assuming that the person shipping would chart what jumps he
want to make and decide (assuming intermediate worlds are avialble)
whether to send it by more smaller jumps or fewer larger jumps.  He
could look at two jump-3\'s for 3960 vs one jump 6 for 4380 and decide
whether he wants it to take one week or two.  Now one jump 4 is cheaper
than two jump-2\'s.  Either jump-2 business would exist when jump 4
ships aren\'t avialble, or perhaps there might be a premium on higher
jump cargo to reflect the fact that it is not only going further, but
getting there fast.  The would meant that higher jump ships would have
more of a profit and explain why the magacorps dominated them.

I wouldn\'t go quite that far (after all, we have to disagree on
something :-)
I would say that anything shipped in large amounts (basically anything
you
can see filling a ship by itself or that you see filling train car after
train car, like grain, etc.) and most trade between high pop worlds
(where
the volume can fill something like that) would go that way.  I would
guess
80-90% in volume but perphaps only 30-50% in value.

Ortillery is not integral at the Task Force (Battalion) level, but each TF has
an attached Meson battery, so the grunts get plenty of fire support (one of my
favorite Dave Nilsen quotes is "When the Marines arrive, the party is over --
everybody outta the pool!"). If the Marines need Ortillery for a specific
mission, it is attached. Marine Task Forces are highly mission oriented, and
their organization reflects this.

On the other hand, the 4518th Lift Infantry Brigade (Duke of Regina\'s Own
Huscarls) has Ortillery (3 system defense boats) as an integral part of their
TO&E.

Hindsight is 20/20.  The comfort that 50 years of temporal separation gives us
from the actual events softens the emotions that were running at the time.
Remember, the war started with what was effectively a surprise attack.  Remember
the _huge_ prisoner attrition that we suffered in the Pacific theater.  Remember
the huge losses that we took on many of the islands, and the propensity toward
suicide attacks that we were facing.  Remember that the war had consumed
American lives for 3 years (more if you count the AVG operating in China).

Good points. I can\'t remember if the seeker is cheaper than the courier. I don\'t
have my stuff with me right now. Perhaps the extra cargo space on the seeker is
really used to store those M-drive contraptions?

As for the exact nature of the M-drive, it\'ll probably depend on what set of rules
one uses for the design of the beast. However, if it is a simple chemical rocket,
you then need to haul fuel (in the cargo hold of the seeker) but you don\'t need
the power plant hooked up to the M-drive.

I just thought of a reason why you\'d want the seeker. The seeker has more cargo
space than the courier, so it\'d be the choice of starship for prospectors who
venture into systems where there is no processing station. Those brave souls would
have to haul their ores back themselves, and across jump space, so they\'d need a
large hold.

For belters in a system with a processing station, though, seekers aren\'t the best
choice.

It may be less expensive to pay belters for claims then to go through 
the expense of buying the equipment and hiring the personel to search 
for high ore content asteroids.

Back in the CT days, I figured it at around US$2.00 is Cr1.00. That was
based on the costs of the vehicles and equipment in the little black
books.

Today, I\'m not as sure, but I still use that guideline.

Neat, but what about lower TLs when Meson Guns aren\'t really battlefield
mobile?

I think I\'d like to be with them rather than someone else, then. Attached
support is all very well, but it has a habit of coming \'unattached\' just
when you need it most. I can just imagine being told "Once the system space
defences have been suppressed your Battalion will have a DE and two
Gazelles as Ortillery support." Then after you\'ve just got yourself well
engaged by the locals and they\'re mounting a counter attack you get a
message over the lascomm "We\'re breaking orbit to engage news bogeys
reported incoming", as the enemy having some brains has ordered some
previously hidden SDBs to mount a diversion. On reminding the Navy
commander of his role as fire support you are told "That only applies AFTER
the space defences are suppressed, which they clearly are not."

Of course this depends on how good a relationship the Navy has with the
Marines, and just how much the Navy really belives that capturing planets
is, compared with destorying ships. It\'s like the arguments over the use of
air power in WWII, with the pro-bomber faction claiming that the Germans
would\'ve done better if they\'d put more effort into strategic bombing, and
others saying that the allies wasted a lot of resources and men with their
bombing campaign, and would\'ve better spent the effort on more support for
their armies.

Which leads back to one of my first posts since coming back onto the
list,
Religious Careers!  I\'m working on it, I\'m working on it.  I\'ve decided
to break
it up into two things.  First, the bares bones generic chargen tables
for
different types of religious orders - for use with whatever religion.
Second, a
Third Imperium Church on the scale proportional to the Roman Catholic
Church.
This second is whats taking up so much time.  But I have a question you
all might
be able to help me with.  I\'m going to strongly base this church on the
Roman
Catholic Church.  I am leaning very strongly to making it based on
Judeo-Christianity.  Question concerns Traveller canon, not the other
kind:

Is there any canon about the christianity from Terra?
(I have only T4 stuff)

I\'ve got no problem having christianity survive to 2099 or whenever
contact was
(-2422 Imperium Calender), but would it survive the collapse of the
First
Imperium?
Would it spread into the Rule of Man?  (I\'m not concerned about the Long
Night).

I notice that Vilani contact on Sylea extends back to 8000, so I should
probably
incorporate some Vilani beliefs into whatever religion survived on
Sylea.

Well, in fact both a jump 6 and a jump 1 ship take 1 weeks to
make a jump.  The jump 1 ship just makes more money at it.
Sure, there are worlds that aren\'t jump-1 accessible, so
those would be relegated to fringe, high jump,
carries.  When the magacorps move in, they will snap
up the more profitable business.  The background presents
jump 1 ships as just trying to eke out with the most 
unprofitable business when they are the most profitable
freighters out there.

I\'m not sure what speculative cargo has to do with the cost
of freight.  All that would mean that you have different
types of ships dominating different types of shipping, which
you also don\'t see....

Yeah, but still, the mega corps will take the trade from the
bottom up (taking the most profitable low jump trips) rather
than as presented in the background.

I totally disagree here.  We are not talking about a balanced hull that with an integral
drive onto a ballistic trajectory.  You are talking about slapping a drive unit on a
chunk of rock and having it guide itself into a mass driver.  Even at the height of the
drive debates (that I\'ve followed), there has always been agreement (I think) that the
drive _force_ comes from the M-drive itself, that it is not a field effect.  As an
example of what I am trying to say, go outside, get a chunk of rock.  Balance it on a
pencil (I\'ll even be nice and say use the eraser side) and walk across the room.  If you
can do it, you are either luckier or much more cooridinated than most people (and you
should consider a career as a rock jock!)

This does not even take into consideration trying to counter any residual spin that the
asteroid already has.

Considering how easy it is to turn a not-very-large asteroid into a orbital weapon, I
would think that _any_ attempts at placing drive units on asteroids would be
discouraged.  With predijuce.

.01 G may not sound like much, but give it enough time (i.e. the travel time from the
asteroid belt to the Habitable Zone) and you got a screaming rock...  For that matter,
tho\' - if the miner was annoyed with the mining company (a dispute over credit) and
\'missed\' the mass driver by \'just a bit\', as well as neglecting to sign his work (with
his transponder), the orbital facilities would be very vulnerable.  I\'m not just talking
about the mass driver control shack either...

If the miner only gets a percentage of what is extracted, salting won\'t do any good.
It\'s what comes out of the rock that counts.

Don\'t get me wrong.  I like you basic idea - I just have a problem with the sample size
and the way the sample is delivered.

Try this, the mining company uses a large ship with a \'spinal mount\' of a mass driver to
throw pre-processed slugs of asteroid to a central processing station (since it\'s a
ballistic trajectory, no in-flight guidence would be necessary, and the velocity would be
set by the \'throwing\' mass driver and not subject to change).  I can see the smaller
\'lone\' prospectors surveying asteroids for value, then selling their location to the
processing units - but being paid when they are processed.  And I can also see the \'lone\'
prospectors out breaking up their own ore and delivering it to the processing units - and
being paid spot cash for the value of the ore.

This way the smelters are kept busy (by both the \'company\' men and independant
contractors), the belters get paid both on the spot (drinking money) and over time as
their larger claims are processed.  A belter may even keep a \'large\' claim for himself to
mine out - I imagine they would get a much larger share of the ore they bring in
themselves, as opposed to what they sell off.

Yah, you could pair him with the NPC I described earlier.  He would go
around being haunted and the NPC would constantly be trying to figure ways
to help him get over it.

When the PC gets cornered on the incident (and unless it was covered up,
(s)he will), the NPC will be getting into all kinds of trouble "defending"
him.  I can just see it, the two of them will be getting into all kinds of
fights because the NPC just won\'t let it go.  The PC will have to work
doubly hard to avoid those kinds of situations, but, it won\'t do him any
good.

I love this idea.  Or the PC/NPC rolls could be reversed.  Shoot, they could
even both be PC\'s or even NPC crew members that constantly get the PC crew
members into trouble.

Before we start painting with too broad a brush, I know some archiologist

I thought we were talking about the dark ages, medieval question.  These

specifically deal with events in Europe.  In order to discuss the topic, you
must use a very \'western\' POV.  If we were speaking of the eastern Romans we

Well, the fact that there is not a problem with the calendar we have may
enter into the picture.  :-)

Our current calendar has an accuracy of 1.000000766583.  In fact, under the
calendar we currently use, there will be no need to adjust anything until
the year 3,571.  Although, if I were in charge, I\'d wait until the year
3,572.  Then the change would be a simple matter of skipping a leap year.

Many think that 01/01/2,000 will mark the beginning of the 20th century.
This just isn\'t the case.  Instead, it marks the beginning of the last year
of the 19th.  The new century and millennium will begin 01/01/2001.  The
best way to see what I\'m talking about is by comparing time measurement to
any other measurement system.  Mathematics is the language of such things.

Time measurement is like any other system of measurement.  0 is a point in
all other dimensional systems.  It is an imaginary construct, it doesn\'t do
anything except separate the preceding from the following.  In mathematics,
a point is defined as a dimensionless geometric object having no properties
except location.

The introduction of a year 0 will complicate things unnecessarily.  To find
the difference in any two dates weather they are B.C. or A.D. or one of each
is simple, just subtract the first date from the last date.  With the
introduction of a year 0, the situation is complicated by the need to add 1
year to this if one of the dates is B.C and the other is A.D.  That\'s why I
never could understand the addition of a year 0 in M4.

It doesn\'t matter.  The US was attacked and had a right to
do what it thought would save it\'s soldiers lives by bringing
the war to an end.  If it felt that both getting the USSR into
the war an using nukes was the most reliable way to do this.
It had every right.  It doesn\'t matter which one worked.
It also doesn\'t matter what other approaches "might"
have worked.  If the US didn\'t want to gamble on them,
then it doesn\'t have to.  The US didn\'t have bombs to
waste on demonstration explosions and I\'m not sure
how you embargo all of Japanese occupied China.

In anycase, the US can hardly be seperated out for
condemnation for using the tatics (bombing cities)
that their foe helped initiate and everyone in
the war did.  The fact that the use of nukes to do
it did have a reasonable expitation of ending the
war quickly only makes if more justifiable.

This, I belive is right for civilian ops. For military ops it makes
less sense than that. The canon idea (seems to me) is that an
attacking fleet would want to jump to the GG and refuel before
proceeding to attack the main world (or whatever tha target is).

Because the GG has strategic importance, it will be defended. So why
would a fleet jump in, lose any surprise attacking the mainworld,
and present itself for attack during the (dangerous?) fueling
operations. Basically it makes far more sense to just attack the
main target--if they choose to defend the GG, it is that much
easier. If you are concerned about not having fuel to jump out,
refuel J-1 from the target with tankers.

Based on a number of sources, I get roughly $3=1Cr.

This would flow from a per capita GDP of roughly 10KCr.

If you want a different value, fiddle with the PCGDP and the exchange rate
will follow.

We would have continued to bomb during a "blockade." 50k people dead
a week is a decent estimate based on the raids up to that point.

Why deal with somebody who started a war with a sneak attack? What
would be the political implications in the States? The President
would roundly loose the next election, no question, and likely take
his party with him. "Yeah, we had \'em licked, so we gave them better
terms than we did the Germans." People who all knew war dead would
really love that one.

Well, let\'s say that we didn\'t nuke Japan. And even that for
whatever reason other land battles stopped (not even slightly
likely, but for arguements sake..). We siege Japan--LeMay would keep
bombing without question.

Both cities would still be destroyed with huge loss of life (hell,
just look at the first firebombing raid on Tokyo). So would many
more smaller ones (as we ran out of bigger cites to flatten).

If the fire bombing raids killed 50k people per week, then it
would take less than 2 months to equal the total atomic deaths
attributed out to 1950 (~340,000). The first Tokyo raid killed at
least 100,000 (more than Nagasaki\'s immediate nuke damage) BTW. 

So in any serious discussion about "what if?" I think you need to
look at the baseline destruction that would have certainly
continued. Any Soviet occupation of the Japanese would have been at
least as bad for them as they dished out to China knowing Stalin\'s
way with people.

Yeah, no doubt this had a lot to do with it--none the less, the end
result was actually probably better for us *and* the Japanese.

Excellent logic. You\'ve convinced me. I\'m intrigued enough about this concept that, as soon
as I get my hands on the T4.1 vehicle design system, I\'m going to cobble together some
vehicles of this type.

That is the danger, true. However, it can be overcome. The drive would have a very low
acceleration (like the 0.01G I mentioned earlier). The Imperium, or maybe just the local star
system, may have a law that says if the rock gets above acceleration x, or speed y, it will
be considered hostile. This is one of two reasons why I suggested that low acceleration
factor (the other reason is that the processing facility must be able to catch up and grab
hold of it if things go wrong).

Don\'t forget that at that minimal acceleration, it gives the star system\'s defensive forces
plenty of time to react to it if it gets too close to a planet. The reaction time would be
measured in days or weeks!

The Imperium probably cares more about the velocity (speed and direction) of moving bodies
than about the mass. Which is not to say that mass isn\'t important, but it\'s not THE factor
in determining threats. So, the Imperium may just have a rule that says that unmanned ships
may not accelerate more than <insert number here> Gs. Unmanned ships with higher than the
permissible acceleration are treated as threats. If so, the 0.01G M drive poses no threat.

As a final (albeit weak) defense of this setup, rocks with drives are canon. Planetoid ships
are specified in High Guard, MT, and at least one adventure (Expedition to Zhodane).

I think I get why you\'re so concerned with the near-C rock threat now. You\'re picturing the
processing plant as being in orbit above a populated planet, maybe even the main world. I was
picturing it as being above/below the ecliptic plane, close to the mining activity in the
asteroid belt.

Why have it there? It\'s close to the action, so rocks don\'t need to travel very far (with
higher acceleration forces and greater potential for target error). You want to be refining
your rocks in zero-G anyway, so why not do it where there\'s lots of room to make a mess.

Every once in a while, a ship will transport finished goods from the processing plant to the
inhabited worlds of the system.

Unless a deposit or some kind of up-front payment is part of the equation. I keep thinking of
how people were duped over the Bre-X scandal last year. I see the potential for that kind of
thing to occur on a larger scale in an asteroid belt.

I\'m not offended. I wasn\'t claiming my idea was perfect (or even that it was "my" idea!) and
I like the fine-tuning process we\'ve been doing.

All very reasonable. In fact, the ballistic trajectory is much easier and cheaper (which is
important from the point of view of the processing company) than slapping a drive on the
rock.

For non-ferrous rocks, you\'d need another way of accelerating the beasties though. The spinal
mount ship should also be (or carry) a large "tugboat", so it can, using its own M -drive,
launch rocks (by pushing them). The processing company needs to have a couple of these tugs
around its end of the journey to decelerate them. You want a couple in case one fails.

All good points.

If nations must bear burdens eternally like this there will never be a

All I can say is this:  I have a friend who is in his mid 70\'s. 
A P-51 pilot during WWII, he was briefed that during Olympic he was
going to be flying strafing runs to soften up the landing grounds and
clear way for invasion forces.  He was directed to shoot anything that
moved, simply because the Japanese WOULD NOT SURRENDER.

He has told me they expected to have to kill most of the population.
True?  He was just a pilot and not a general, but the attitude was
there.  The bomb stopped that from happening.

Today the Japanese hold MacArthur in high respect because of the way
they were treated after the war.  So I ask y\'all:which should we be
judged by, our brutally effective way of stopping the war or the impact
we had on Japan to allow it one of the worlds great powers today?

What\'s the old line?  "Fighter pilots make movies, ground attack pilots
make history?"  Speaking as a grunt, I\'d rahter see one A-10 over the
battlefield than hear about thirty knights of the air, in glorious single

Great! So you wouldn\'t mind it when your local school allowed the following
religions to demostrate their beliefs to your children:  Santeria, Voodun,
Santanism, Dionysian Fertillity Rites, Paganism, Druidism, and a group of
Discordians praising Eris.

The role of the USMC is to put a foot in the door.  By getting to a trouble
spot quickly, the Marines provide a notable US presence on the ground.
Also, the Marines have their own air support (AV-8B jump jets and AH-1S Sea
Cobras) that interact closely with the troops on the ground.

What the Marines lack is the capability for sustained warfare.  The Army,
with massed divisions of M1A2s and field artillery, can locate, fix, and
destroy the enemy; then "plant the flag in his ass."

Heretic!   The main mission of the United States Army is to defend the US.
The Army isn\'t in the force-projection business.  That\'s the Navy/USMC\'s
job.  The Army is best utilized when deployed to a forward area, given time
to collect itself, and supported by the Air Force.

And that is all I ever wanted to do, fly a hog and do exactly what you
said.  Alas but 4 of 23 go to fighters in a typical UPT class, and I
missed an A-10 by 1 or 2.

However, one of my fondest memories was driving north during Khafji and
praying we would be diverted to hit the armored columns advancing from
the north on the Marines there.

Never hear of that?  Well, there is a good reason, even though I didn\'t
get MY wish.  A 3 ship did hit those columns of some 5000 Iraqis and
annihilated them.  Ground observers reported trucks were flying 50-100
feet in the air during the strike, which consisted of 150 750lb HE
bombs.  So the B-52 is sexy, especially to Marines.

it is easier to blend in (by not having to be obviously different). I think it
may come down to all American Jews disappearing, except for the 10% who are
Orthodox (and thus very similar to Fundemantal Christians and Muslims in their
outlook). In Traveller, I would think that religions (expecially Terran ones),
would have similar problems. The pressure to assimilate and fit in, would tend
to force religions to become militant and/or Orthodox to fight the "outside
influences". Another interesting point is local religion that is unacceptable
to the Imperium, or even the local\'s reaction to "outside" ie. Imperial
missionaries. A last point is the potential for Vilani vs. Solomani religious
bigotry. If you look at Northern Ireland, the Middle East, and India-Pakistan;
religious differences directly and/or indirectly influence politics. How would
this be modeled in the Imperium? (I won\'t even go to religious differences
among the Zhodani and the other major races).

If we are discussing the M:0 period, the 3I wasn\'t close to Solomani space.
 Since that period is only lightly covered in printed material, I can only
assume that something slowed Imperial expansion to rimward until Terra was
finally absorbed in 588.  Perhaps Solomani pocket empires, combined with
the ease of expansion to spinward, made the rim a backwater for centuries.

I have to question your statement about Terra being the "homeworld" for
many citizens.  I\'m a first generation American, my father is from
Stafferd, England.  I feel no sense of loyalty or connection to that far
off place, that I\'ve never seen.  That\'s with a seperation of forty years
and about 10,000 miles.  Imagine if your family had left Earth over a
thousand years ago, and dozens of light years behind!

The Imperium fought, and lost, a war with the Julians between 175-191.
This guarnteed their independance.

The Spinward Marches were a frontier that few in the Moot cared about.
There were always projects to occupy the attentions and funds of the
nobility; which proved disastorous when Olav haut-Plankwell drove from the
Marches like an avenging angel after the 1FW.

I don\'t really see the Imperium "incorporating" new members into a

Consider that the Vilanni brought their "bottom-line" mentality to warfare.
 Always looking for the greatest return on an investment of force.  The
Imperium could do worse for a model!

I prefer a setting that\'s honest to me as the Referee and to my players:
The Third Imperium is corrupt, it\'s methods are immoral; rather than the
whole mythology of the Star Vikings securing civilazation by acting like
visigoths.  I might have had an easier time with the RC setting if the
source material had been upfront about what the RCES was doing, and had a
sidebar about the PR campaign.

Funny.  I was in the 3/7th INF (M), and we have a battle streamer for
Chosin.  Seems we took the point during the withdrawl, since we still had a
couple of trucks to transport the dead and wounded.

By the way, running for the hills, or seizing the high ground, is a sound
military tactic.  :P

How to deflate Marines in three easy steps:

1>  How many Marines went ashore on D-Day, the largest amphibious landing
in history?

2>  What do Lee Harvey Oswald, James Earl Ray, and Charles Whitman have in

The most reliable figure I heard was a ready force that outnumbered us
4.7-1 in tanks.

IMTU, the Reserve Fleet for each Subsector is mostly support.  Tankers,
tenders, transports for the subsector Army...  This allows the "real" Navy
to keep all the sexy battlewagons to themselves.  The reserves get second
line vessels for escorts and rear area patrols, but rarely any muscle.

But then they would have had to absorb all those pesky, unethical, immoral

Easier by far just to keep the Imperium off-balance, nervous, and xenophobic,

How can a measly Destroyer devastate a planet?

The billions GDW killed off through attacks on civilian life-support

you.

Look how many planets support thousands or millions of people with no 
atmosphere or an unbreathable atmosphere.

"Captain, scanners have located three high-output power sources. They could 
be the colony\'s main oxygen-cracking facilities."
"Very good Commander. I want a close-approach orbit, we\'ll bombard the 
sites as we come over the horizon..."

One of the Traveller rules sets for Fleet actions had vacuum worlds 
surrender immediately when enemy warships appeared in orbit - they were 
just that vulnerable. Add that to the number of planets supporting 
populations with a local tech that can\'t produce necessary life support 
materials - anything that renegade Destroyer blows up  isn\'t going to be 
replaced by local manufacture. Blow enough of the right things up and there 
won\'t be a colony when the supply ship returns.

Granted, any high-population,.high tech world or world with strong SDB\'s 
won\'t have to worry about that kind of thing - but such worlds make up 
what, sixteen percent of inhabited worlds (by Traveller random world 
generation routines)? Nuclear surgical strikes targeted by TL-12 sensors 
will do the job just fine.

33ktons is more like a CL than a DD IMHO (based on CT Sup.9).

That said, it could use any old missiles. A 6g6 missile will hit the
planet at at least 100km/s. I don\'t wanna start the rock-throwing
thread, but if we assume that a ship so armed has decided to lay
waste (for whatever reasons) it can do it with pure KE. If they
drive (remootely piloted, of course) some ships\'s boats into the
world at higher velocities... yikes.

Only once it is detected.  And it could be given a trajectory that would be

Actually, I thought long and hard about Planetoid Monitors.  My thoughts on 
that would be that the monitor has it\'s drive installed in a shipyard, and 
I\'m sure that they would be balanced and trimmed against the size and shape 
of the ship.

Actually, for those types of rocks, I was envisioning either a metal rod

 Either would be recoverable and reusable.

You have a system to defend. All that really matters is the
mainworld(s). If you ignore defending your GG, then your mainworld
is protected by your entire fleet. Otherwise, you have a weaker
mainworld, but a defended GG.

OK, I attack you. I am trying to take your mainworld (taking just
the GG doesn\'t do any good as far as controlling the system is
concerned). I can either take the GG first, then take mainworld, or
I can just jump staright to mainworld.

Jump to GG:
1. Deal with enemy forces, if any.
2. Fuel up (why else would I bother with the GG if not to refuel?).
	-Post High Guard and hope there is nothing nasty to surprise
	me.
3. Jump or m-drive to mainworld--they know I am in system, so if I
jump they are on alert for a week, if they see me driving, my intent
is clear.

4. Attack mainworld with either full force (no GG defenders were
there) or reduced force (I had to fight and refuel).

Jump to Mainworld:
1. Jump in with surprise.
2. Deal with Mainworld forces (full or split with GG).
3. If mainworld had no ships at GG, then my attack is the same as
worse case above, but with surprise. If forces are split with GG,
mainworld is easier to take (GG forces to be dealt with later).

Of the 2, the latter option is a better bet. The only advantage to
going to the GG is refueling for a jump outsystem if the mainworld
attack is going badly. This is only a problem if you do a full jump
into the system, however. If you leave a jumps worth of fuel, there
is no advantage to GG attack--and if you have tankers around, then
GG attack is pointless.

YMMV, but this is pretty typical.

duFortier\'s Arboreal Hedgehog

 Geneered from Solomani origins, duFortier\'s Hedgehog (also known as
"FlySpineys" and a variety of unsavory terms) retains most of its
ancestral appearance, being a 3kg (at most) mammalian insectivore
with a thick coat of spines across its entire back. Important
differences include adaption of the claws and limbs from digging to
climbing, and the addition of a long fold of skin stretched between
the front and rear limbs. DuFortier\'s Hedgehog has lost the ability
to curl up entirely within its spiney coat for protection, though it
can still curl up enough to discourage most of the predators it is
likely to encounter. Another adaption is toward low-G or Zero-G
environmental function, making the FlySpiney quite at home in
space habitats.
 During the years of explosive expansion by the Solomani in the Nth
Interstellar Wars, one particular colony placed a panic call for
help against a ravening insectoid population. The genebanks of Terra\'s
Genassist sent an assault team equipped with the best of Terra\'s
insectivores and the ability to adapt their "troops" to changing
conditions. While the problem was eventually solved by other means,
several of the animals imported and adapted to the "war" were found
to have other applications. One of these is duFortier\'s Arboreal
Hedgehog, which quickly found a home among starship crews as a sort
of "ship\'s cat" alternative. While more common near Solomani space,
they have spread across and beyond the Imperium.
 One of the factors in their spread is the Flyspiney\'s prodigious
ability to reproduce. Combined with the adolescents tendency to treat
anything and anyone as a target during gliding practice, the need to
get the young "anywhere but this ship!" has guaranteed their spread.
 Adults are both territorial and possessive. If allowed to roam an
area freely, an adult will develop a routine of patroling the area
for edibles and other curiosities. They also tend to develop an
attachment to their owner/parent-figure if carefully raised, and
can be quite affectionate (assuming you like being snuggled by a
10-pound 5-O\'clock-shadow). For this reason many Zhodani are known
fans of the Flyspiney.
 Even some non-humans find them useful and charming (and occasionally
even tasty). While the Hivers dislike them strictly on an "I have
large feet and this animal is sharp and pointy and underfoot" basis,
the Ithklur find them amusing for precisely the same reason. The
Aslan are ambivalent, but never use them as shipboard pets. The Vargr
consider them (in a deeply atavistic way) to be a quick snack, and
most Flyspineys seem to recognize this instinctively, though there
are a few cases of friendly cohabitation. The K\'kree find it hard
to hate a lowly insectivore, but have no real interest (aside from
an instinctive interest similar to what a soccer team feels toward
a soccer ball...).

This also allows for all those traditional Sci-fi stories of the old miner

I very much doubt they cared, but I\'m pretty sure they knew, because the

Hell yes, but the air forces of the world seem to think that ground
attack/support missions are \'dirty\' and not worth while, probably because
SAMs don\'t play fair.

A nice thing about TW2000, as far as my freinds and I were concerned
(Infanry, one and all) - no b***dy aircraft.

I was talking about the period up to the 1st Frontier War, and the
following Civil War. Whilw it may not have been policy to expand into the
SM Melieu 0 does say that the Syleans were irritated by the slow Vilani
expansion, and they certainly didn\'t object to movement into and beyond the
SM, whereas there was an offical limit to rimward expansion, at least in
M:0. Maybe the rim was a backwater, but if so it caught up fast enough.

I take your point.

Why did it garantee independance, I don\'t think winning a war stopped the
3I before, they just came back later. They certainly didn\'t let a frontier
war or two stop them from continuing to pressure the Zhodani, though the 3I
seemed very bad at spotting cause and effect: they always seemed surprised
when the Zho\'s pushed back.

I tend to agree with you/them.

I guess it\'s just that by letting policy remain static for long periods of
time the 3I managed to paint itself into a corner. Then they started
telling themselves "It\'s alright, the SM has lots of potential, it\'s still
frontier really." with the result that like Feist\'s Kelwan (sp?) the 3I
looked vibrant and alive, but wasn\'t really going anywhere since probably
about 700-800.

All IMHO, of course (not that that\'ll do any good).

I see what you mean, but I found it fairly clear. I think a lot of them
were overly idealistic with all the risks that go with it. The first thing
I thought when it was clear what was going on was "I\'d hate to be one of
them, if it turn out that they are wrong." Also I don\'t think I could sell
the explict profiteering of M:0 to my players, whereas the ideals of the
Coalition would be easier. Then I could present them with the neat moral
questions of "Is it really worth the price that\'s being payed for it." some
of my players might\'ve even counted the zippers in the price. Once they\'d
got hold of M:0 (and they would have) there\'d be no way they\'d keep to any
sort of moral code - "If this sort of greed is good enough for Cleon, it\'s
good enough for us."

There was a general discussion about it and I believe that the general
consensus was approximately $3. I believe I\'ve seen it stated somewhere
that the credit started out equal to 1$ back in 1977.

What I posted wasn\'t really an analysis but a system where originally
the unit was equal to the hourly pay for an unskilled laborer. To my
delight this turned out to fit perfectly with the standard credit
being that unit (it also fits perfectly with the GURPS $; there\'s
serendipity for you!).

By this logic there is no such thing as a war crime, at least not if
you are attacked. Is that what you believe? Does the reverse apply too?
That any loss of life caused by any action of an agressor is a crime?

It seems to me that the whole concept of war crimes arise from the
idea that there are some things you\'re not entitled to do, even to
defend yourself. Terror-bombing to break the enemy\'s will, torture to
extract useful information, the use of hostages, execution of POWs,
use of defoilants and napalm, the whole shooting match.

Of course, some of the things I mention above are against the Geneva
Convention, but if using them would shorten the war and save friendly
casualties, wouldn\'t it be morally wrong to adhere to the convention?

The US may have been justified in dropping nuclear bombs on Japan. I
don\'t think so, but I admit that I don\'t have all the facts and that
I may be wrong. But if they were justified, then it must have been for
other reasons than a blanket absolution caused by the fact that the
Japanese were the original aggressors.

Whilst not being quite exactly what you\'re talking about, but 45 RM Commando
landed on Gold beach (well they are "Marines") :*>. And Overlord (D-Day as
it so oft and inaccurately called) was not the largest amphibious landing.
That distinction goes to the invasion of Sicily which involved 185,000
personnel as against Overlord\'s 181,000.

ObTrav: How intense are the interservice rivalries in the 3rd Imperium. We
know in M:0 the nobility have a tradition of duelling. Might we expect
"Three musketeer"  style duels and rivalries. Do regiments have friendly and
enemy regiments? Will a member of the 37th Martian Rifles (Cleon\'s Loyal
Greens) take an instant and intense dislike to members of the 9th Regiment
of Marine Infantry; challange a member of the 114th Deneb Cavalry to a duel
on sight; and shout a round of drinks for anyone from the 13th Frontier
Legion? Should we be digging out our copies of En Garde?

I don\'t know if the following is what you\'re after, but it may amuse you.
Back around 92 on the Great PBM game run by Mark Cook and Mike Metlay an
"in between" period was coming up. The ship we were on was to do a couple
of jumps to get us to where the action was, and Mark&Mike had decided to
fast-forward through it. All the players were encouraged to write
personal journals to cover the period and to come up with some frills
to develop our characters. I had already established that my character,
Rigo Edmondsen, was a closet romantic who carried a library of holo-
crystals with him. Some of the works were serious historical books and
reference works, but a LOT of them were adventure fiction and there were
also a lot of videos -- excuse me, I mean holo-dramas. So I decided that
he would arrange a showing of some of his favorite holodramas each evening
over the period and had a lot of fun making up what those favorites were.
Here\'s a copy of the announcement he posted on the ship\'s bulletin board:


- ----
Edmondsen Entertainment presents a selection of the best holodramas
from Behind the Claw to Daibei. Each evening at 20:00 hours in the
small lounge.

Following the main feature each night we\'ll show an episode of the
holoseries \'Sector Tango Libra\' that follows the fortunes of the men
and women on a Welfare Service fort on the edge of The Black Hole.

No, that\'s not it. What it costs you is time. Several days at least.
Instead of jumping directly to the mainworld where you can deliver
your freight and passengers and (hopefully) get a new load, you jump
to the Gas Giant. You then spend 10-20 hours moving from its 100
diameter limit to where you can refill your tanks. you then spend
whatever it takes to get from the Gas Giant to the mainworld. Say you
have a beat-up 40 year old Free Trader worth about MCr15. Assuming your
average earnings are about the same as your competitors\', you should be
able to earn about 110 credits per hour. You\'ve just saved 4000 credits
(because you\'ve gotten 40 tons of unrefined fuel for free instead of
paying 100 Cr/T at the starport). If you spend more than 36 hours extra
on the trip to the Gas Giant you\'re better off not doing it. If you are
still paying off an original purchase price of 60-65 MCr the figures get
four times as bad.

BTW. The people who think that Gas Giant refuelling makes sense believes
that you\'re using hours where you wouldn\'t earn money anyway (and then
making correspondingly more money the rest of the time).

2000, 2000, and 100, right?

Official? 2000. Except that there are some references in various CT
material that makes life support quite a lot less for private starships.
_Annic Nova_ makes it 1000 per jump. And there are some rules for
Belters that makes life support much cheaper for non-starships than for
starships...

It\'s all included in the blanket 2000 credits per jump. I guess that
you can survive indefinitely as long as you don\'t do any jumps... ;-)

Varies from port to port, but are most often Cr100 for six days plus 100
for each day more than that. (Far to little, IMO).

Included in the blanket 2000 credit/jump.

I play with sams and do ground attack all the time.  And they are nasty
as all hell.  Seen a few real ones too.

The real problem is twofold:  if an air force doesn\'t own the skies your
ground shooters get picked off and troopies blasted.(ask exhibit A:Irag)
Most of the USAF IS ground attack.  Only the F-15\'s and F-22\'s are pure
carnivores.  BUFFs and BONES are at best omnivorous.  

All I ever wanted was a hog, but most guys who do well in UPT go for the
pointy nosed aircraft, because even hogs are "lower class citizens."  
I just want to save grunt lives and be a flyboy.  Cant see what those
others do from the ground-but it is amazing how damn GOOD they are. 

 There are GIANTS in this world, ven from my point of view.

Not all that far fetched...some plants here on earth (thier fruits
especially) give off ethylene gas, which will kill other nearby plants.

BUt all I could think of when I read the description of the bean was \'Gad

   Look up the definition of \'cult\' and then compare it to the defintion of
\'religion\'.  Otherwise you would be correct--you would have to allow
everything from tree worshipers to ritual squirrel molesters to people who
took my Gabreelist writings a little too seriously...

P.S. I know what you are thinking: but Harold, didn\'t Christianity start off
as a Jewish cult?  Absolutely, and if this were 38 AD and not 1998 AD, I
wouldn\'t allow St. Paul to plant crosses on school property.

DON´T! The Third Imperium has no official church, there are as many
denominations as there are worlds (maybe even more). A unified,
hierarchial church can´t encompass this large a space. It wouldn´t (and
Shouldn´t) work!
Religion in the 3I is personal. Many worlds have state religions, many
have none, but the normal case is that everyone is free to live to the
standards he chooses. Religious practices are usually more personal, not
in a group.

The Terran influence is there, but it shouldn´t have had that high an
influence that people gave up their religion when the Terrans came.

It´s still exists on Terra itself, but not as many followers there as
today (new influences from the outside changed many peoples worldview,
making them turn their back on organized religion) and some
Solomani-Colonized worlds where people settled that did´t want to suffer
the loss of religion experienced elsewhere.

Survive: Yes!
Spread to other worlds: A Bit, ok!
Spread Imperiumwide: No Fucking way. Organized religion already is on
the way out on this here world IMHO!

Although you must admid, American Cities remained relatively
(relatively? Completely!) unbombed during the entire war. It wasn´t even
a "We must destroy them because otherwise they will destroy us", but
rather a "They are doing things that work against our interest, get them
away, the faster the better". I don´t say the US should have just
contained the Japanese, but Nuking two cities was a little over the top.
Just do the math: How many lives were saved by those nukes? Substract
the loss of life, direct and indirect, that was caused by the bombs. The
result is negative, thus the use of the bombs was an evil thing to do.
Yes Evil! It doesn´t matter that it was against "The Enemy!!", it was
directed against human life, against civilians. I see the use of the
nuke as one of the great atrocities of the 2nd WW, but since the Victors
commited it, it didn´t cout, in their eyes, for they were "justified". 
The Truth is always in the eyes of the beholder, history is written by
the winners, and this even proves these statements.

Well they keep secrets from each other, Army and Navy intelligence
sometimes work against each other (see: Signal GK). How far rivalry
goes, i don´t know, but i suppose it is rather peaceful, similar to the
situation between the branches today (jokes and devaluation yes, maybe
sometimes a barroom brawl, but no real fighting)

AFAIK they knew beforehand and even had time to prepare for the event
but didn´t because they needed the public outcry to mobilize the
population!

What an incredibly irresponsible answer to a basic question of what Traveller
materials are there out there. You\'ve just said none of he current T4 material
is any good, and that it basically doesn\'t exist anyway. Store have it.
Distributors have it. There are some gems in the pile, even if you think it is
all trash.

Let\'s tell this person about Emperor\'s Arsenal, or Pocket Empires. Let\'s tell
him there are 15 titles in the T4 line to pick and choose from.

Another nice point is that if you want to find all the stars within X
parsecs, you just check the ones that are within X parsecs on *both*
maps. That cuts down *significantly* on the stars you need to check.

I think you misunderstood. Assuming we were using a standard
*subsector* map as the XY map, the other map has to "attach" at the
"top" or the "bottom". It can\'t attach on either "side".

> What would you use? Cartesian coordinates or hex? (Hex looks cool
> while Cartesian coordinates are more accurate IMHO)

I\'d probably go with the hex coords, plus a vertical coord. That way
you measure the distance in hexes (HD) on the XY map, then figure the
"real" distance as RD = sqrt(HD^2 + VD^2).

Cheap lookup table (rounded to one decimal):
    VD
HD  0	1    2	  3    4    5    6 
0   0	1    2	  3    4    5    6
1   1	1.4  2.2  3.2  4.1  5.1  6.1
2   2	2.2  2.8  3.6  4.5  5.4  6.3
3   3	3.2  3.6  4.2  5    5.8  6.7
4   4	4.1  4.5  5    5.7  6.4  7.2
5   5	5.1  5.4  5.8  6.4  7.1  7.8
6   6	6.1  6.3  6.7  7.2  7.8  8.5

I think we could have some fun if we used subsectors that were hexes
the size of the "unexplored space" charts from the old Alien Modules
and 7 levels "high".

One of the scientists involved with the Manhattan District wrote an SF
story back in the 50s, set in a future where the Soviets got the upper
hand and the US had to surrender. The title was "My trial as a War
Criminal". He had the US commanders being tried for that sort of thing
as well as bombing of civilian targets (like Dresden). 

We may yet come to regret the precedents set in Nuremburg. But I do
feel that the idea that following orders may have consequences down the
road *is* a good one.

Sorry, but regular tetrahedrons will *not* "tile" a 3d space! Not even
*close*.  Neither will regular octahedrons. A *combination* of regular
tetrahedrons and regular octahedrons will tile space. And regular
hexahedrons (cubes) will tile space. 

A 60 degree co-ordinate system is interesting, but it doesn\'t "fill
space" with tetrahedrons.

Got you beat. Back in 67, a group of us got rather upset when one of us
discovered that the astronaut program required 20-20 *uncorrected*
vision. That killed it for *all* of us. 

Somewhat later (1974), I only half jokingly made made a bet with a
friend that was to be collected on at the Luna City gym in 2001. At
that time there was still a chance. One of these days I\'m going to have
to ask Bill how we should "settle up" in 3 years.

Flat cats are a nice pet. And far fewer players wiull have read "The
Rolling Stones" than have seen the Star Trek episodes about Tribbles.
And flat cats are amusing in their own right. Having evolved to hide in
terrain much like the Painted Desert on Earth, they are the most
*ghastly* colors, shocking pinks, oranges, bright yellows are all
*natural* colors on them. 

And since they only have litters every 64 days, it\'ll take the players
a while to realize just what sort of time bomb they have. But as with
tribbles, if you don\'t over feed you won\'t have problems.

The above stimulated a buried memory. It *is* possible to make jellied
alcohol. It\'s nowhere near as bad as napalm, but it\'s bad enough. It\'s
basicly "Sterno" if you\'ve ever encountered that.

Well, it all depends. For one thing, asteroids are going to be rsather
more homogenous than a planet. Most ore formimg processes just plain
don\'t work under the conditions they formed under. The only
"seperation" is that large enough bodies melted from internal
radioactivity in the early years of the system (billions of years back)
and then "settled" according to density under their own rather
miniscule gravities. Depending on details such as how big they were and
how close in they were, varying amounts of differentiation will have
occured and varying amounts of volatiles will have been lost. 

The laregest bodies in the outer system will have a shell of "ices"
over a shell of stony materials, over a shell of metals (mostly
nickel-iron, with varying amounts of anything that will dissolve in it).

Closer to the star, much of the ices are gone, and some will have been
converted to various CHON materials (Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen and
Nitrogen). Still closer, you have nothing but stony materials and metals.

Collisions will have broken off chunks of the outer layers, which can
result in "pure" chunks of ice, CHONdritic materials, stony materials,
or even metallic cores. And chunks can have stuff from adjacent layers,
giving you ice/CHON, CHON/stone, and stone/iron. 

Ice won\'t be found close in (say 5 AU minimum). CHON can survive much
closer (say .7 AU min). 

Ice is *very* valuable, because it\'s mostly water, methane and ammonia.
The water is valuable. The nitrogen is valuable. Even the carbon is
somewhat valuable. Water is valuable for drinking, for oxygen, and for
hydrogen fuel. Nitrogen and carbon are both needed for life support.

CHON is valauble because it\'s more concentrated source of carbon and
nitrogen as well as having some more complex organics. It\'s rather
lower in hydrogen and oxygen.

Stoney bodies aren\'t all that valuable. Unless you are willing to
process the whole thing to extract the "trace" materials, they are
mainly a source of silicon, aluminum, magnesium, and oxygen (the rock
is silicon/aluminum/magnesium oxides, much like rock here on Earth). 

The "trace" materials aren\'t to be sneered at. A cubic kilometer of
rock is 1e9 m^3. At around 4 tons per cubic meter, that means that
something that is one part per *billion* by weight will yield 4 tons
from that cubic kilometer. 4 tons of gold, or uranium isn\'t to be
sneered at. And they are actually likely to be more like one part per
*million*, which means you\'d get 4 *thousand* tons. 

And, of course, the nickel iron bodies are useful for the iron and
nickel content. 

That laser drill is mostly for drilling in for samples (to determine if
your "rock" has a metal core) and for attaching things to the "rock". 

For ice and CHON, you will move small bodies to a processing center or
a habitat using your ship. You\'ll want to stick close becayuse they are
too damn valuable. For larger bodies, you\'ll request a "tug" (basicly a
*huge* engine with a small "ship" attached. You don\'t *dare* leave the
body for fear someone will steal it.

For stoney bodies, you might nudge them towards a smelter, or put in a
call for a "portable" smelter. Depends on the size of the rock, the
size of your ship, the demand for the (rather common) materials
involved and what sort of deal you can cut. You\'ll likely leave a stony
body with a claim marker on it, if you think it\'s worth the trouble.
Unless you get lucky and find one that\'s conveniently positioned, you
won\'t even make expenses messing with a hunk of stone.

For nickel-iron, you can make some money as iron is still pretty
useful, and it\'s not as much trouble to refine out. Still, you won\'t
get rich off a nickel-iron body.

It\'s the close-in ice, and the rather rare CHON bodies that you make
your money from. Make enough money, and you can buy a small "smelting"
rig. Basicly a solar power array (hydrogen is expensive in the belt), a
backup fusion or fission plant) and some plasma arc torches and
magnetic plasma seperation gear.

With a smelter, you can process nickel-iron on your own and make a
small profit at it. You might even be able to make a little money by
processing the stony material attached to stony/iron bodies. Processing
pure stony bodies is a desperation move.

Depending on how close to the iron core it was, (or if it came from the
core of a body too small for the iron to settle out) you might do
better than breaking even. But you can\'t count on that. 

Get a bigger smelter, and you might be ab;e to make a profit on "rock"
(in this case you *can* "make it up on volume" :-). But that sort of
unit is *really* expensive, and you either need to be in the "thicker"
part of the belt, or have tiugs that can move big asteroids to you, or
move you to the big asteroids.

Get the picture?

Actually, it won\'t be all that hard to figure out where the rock\'s
center of gravity is. If your thrust is aimed through that point, the
rock will fly straight.

The spin on a rock a few km across is going to to require *incredible*
amounts of power to stop. I remember that from an old article,

Actually, it is very *hard* to do.

Actually, .01 g is an *incredible* lot.

Consider a one cubic kilometer chunk of "rock". Fairly light rock, it
only has a density of 4. That means that the rock masses 4e12 kg. Point
.01g is .1 m/s^2. F=mA.

F=4e12*1e-1
F=4e11 kg m/s^2

In other words, that engine has to have a thrust of 400 *billion*
Newtons! That\'s the thrust it\'d take to move a 67 million ton (mass)
ship at 6g.

This "tiny" engine is bigger than the Seeker!

You don\'t move asteroids except with *huge* engines, and very, very slowly.

All the above are irrelevant given the answer to A.

The only thing *remotely* like this that *might* be possible would be
to have a truly *enormous* amount of water vapor in the atmosphere. But
there are limits to how much water the air can hold, even if you
suspend it as microscopic droplets or ice crystals (ie "clouds"). 

Worse, water vapor is a "greenhouse gas". That means that the planet\'s
temp would go up. The extra light reflected by the cloud tops would
help, but likely not enough (the exact answer depends on exact figures
for things like "how much water").

But there\'s no way to keep this sort of enormous cloud cover from
turning into rain, except by having the surface of the planet too hot
for water to exist as a liquid. Which sort of defeats the purpose, and
reffectively gives you another Venus.

The idea was mapped to an entire planet in an Analog storiy about 5
years back. The planet had a cicrcular orbit and no axial tilt. It was
also close enough to the star that it never got to 4C even at the
poles. So the stuff that drained into deep oceans *stayed* there.

You see, 4C is the *densest* water gets, If the temp drops below that
the body of water "turns over", that is, the top layers will swap with
the bottonm layers.

When this doesn\'t happen, you get all the oxygen in the deep water
being used up, and bacteria using hydrogen sulfide take over. 

So in those lakes, and in the oceans of this hypothetical world, the
biundary between oxygenated water and H2S saturated water slowly works
it\'s way closer and closer to the surface. At some point, it gets close
enough for the mixing caused by wave action to reach to the H2S. When
that happens, the H2S gets access to the atmosphere and *boils* out of
the water. In the case of the lakes, it kills anything nearby as it
diffuses. It the case of the hypothetical *ocean*, it\'ll kill
much of the life on the planet.

Hydrogen won\'t work. If the surface is at habitable temps, the hydrogen
will have a significant fraction of the molecules moving above escape
velocity, and thus it\'ll vanish as fast as it forms.

Alas, while a nice idea, this doesn\'t work either. Whgile the bottom of
the Med *has* been dry in the past, the most recent time was long
before man was on the scene. Something like 600 thousand years ago. 

The Med was nicely filled with water during the more recent Ice Ages.

The explanation for the flood myth is pretty simple. They originated
with the Assyrians and Babylonians. Who just happened to live ion a
wide flat plain between a *pair* of rivers!

Other cultures with flood myths also lived in areas that flood.

Ah! That makes more sense. While I was having trouble with the idea
that a commander would *order* someone into a minefield to pick up a
comrade, I could almost see it happening.

What I was having a more trouble with was the idea of a *real* C.O.

That\'s not a problem. No fighter jock worth his wings would be messing

I was refering to USMC personel.  Our Marines tend to forget that all the
services have their role and believe their own press releases.  Reminding
them that the invasion of Fortress Europe was carried out without them helps.

If you count *all* the people involved, D-Day was bigger.

IMTU, rivalries are fairly common within each Subsector\'s Army.  This is
both planetary (Lunionites and Stroudenese hate each other), and Regimental
(the 243rd Frontier Rifles will never forgive the Adaman Cavalry for
failing to support them during a battle of the First Frontier War.)

These aren\'t overblown wars, but snubs, tricks, and the occasional duel do
result.

I\'m an immigrant, and my loyalty is to my chosen country.

But I\'ve met third-generation Canadians whose first loyalty is to a
country they\'ve never visited. I\'ve seen them fight with other
third-generation Canadians over issues from "home".

A former colleague considered Israel her real home, although she lived
here in Canada, her parents were from somewhere in Eastern Europe, and she
attended synagogue only for her kids\' bar mitzvas. 

I think that where loyalties are concerned, it\'s probably better to avoid
generalizations.

This is not a futuristic entertainment facility but rather a popular game
of chance especially popular among the Vargr (who originated it):

Dhe (six in Gvegh I think)
===
The gameboard consist of six squares where you can place your bets and a
croupier that handles the dice and bets.
The croupier rolls 2D6 inside an inverted cup so that nobody can see the result.
Each player bet on a number from 1 to 6.

a) If none of the dice shows your number you neither won nor lost. Your bet
remains on the table (some variants allow the withdrawal here or change of
number but generally this is not allowed).

b) If only one of the dice shows your number you lose.

c) If both dice show your number you win, collecting 9 times your bet.

The gamblers reasoning goes like this:
======================================
If none of the dice show my number I neither win nor lose so that\'s OK.
If one of the dice show my number there is a 1 in 6 chance the other one
will as well so if I get more than six times my money I\'ll gain on the
average.

Most Dhe tables generate quite a lot of cash so obviously the reasoning
above is flawed.
As any Traveller game will have 2D6 floating around (except perhaps the
heretical TNE bunch ;) so this game can easily be simulated during
sessions.

The two nuclear bombs droped on Hiroshim and Nagasaki did not kill as many
people as many of the firebombing raids against Tokyo.  They just happened
to be particularly dramatic.  The Japanese were going to fight to the
death... even after the first bomb dropped, they weren\'t going to surrender.

The US was not in the war because they thought the Japanese might
inconvenience them.  The US was trying to stay out of the war but the
Japanese bombed Pearl Harbot in an attempt to cripple the US presence
in the Pacific so that they could operate with impunity.  They were
attacking other nations in their region and making war  They were also
allied with the Germans and Italians who were in the process of trying
to conquer Europe.

About $2 for each Imperial credit is the figure I use as a guideline or
rather (10 SKr per 1 Credit). As pricing is so strange in Traveller (have
you ever managed your trader PCs to pay taxes for instance?) I tend to use
10 000 Cr as average income and fiddle my prices around that.

But we must NEVER forget that war IS hell....  Had a Marine friend from 
Vietnam...  Was in ANGLICO (ObTrav: they are the ones that drop to the 
planet surface and infiltrate to provide spotting/special prep before 
the main force arrives).  A car backfired while he was walking down the 
street.  He grabbed his wife and jumped into a dumpster for cover.  That 
stuff tends to stick with you a LONG time.

He was a SSgt....  Maybe another bit of character traits for the NPC/PC

Check history. In the 12800s new arrivals in places like India or other
"frontier" areas would be grilled about the latest style back in the
capital (Paris, London, Washington). And that was at a time when it may
have taken 3 to 6 months to travel the distance.

Heck, back in WWI (and even WWII) the DIs thought it was a pain dealing
with the recruits from "back in the hills" who\'d never *seen* a flush
toilet, and dfidn\'t bathe all that often.

Now consider the poor Imperial DI who has to deal with a batch of TL1
or even TL0 recruits!

Actually, no, as far as can be told from the historical record and
archives, we knew _something_ was up, but not any details. We had an
enormous amount of intercepted, undeciphered, deciphered, but
untranslated, and translated material on hand. They have found hints of
the attack in material we had, but this was only after the war as they
deciphered and translated some of the mass of untouched material.

As ong as you use a computer and allow rotation about all 5 axes, and
translation (ie forward/backward movement) along all 5 you can do ok.
After enough exposure some of the players will be able to "visualize"
the 5d relationships.

I\'m actually fairly serious in the above. There\'s a program that let\'s
you manipulate a hypercube in the manner described above (even has
support for using the red/green "3d" glasses) and it\'s reported that
many people *do* acquire the ability to "visualize" the manipluations
in "4d".

So I figure that at least *some* can do so in 5d. :-)

During the Biafran War there was a mercenary pilot who was essentially the
Biafran Air Force. At one stage he was running food and medical supplies
in, children out, in a light civilian plane. I believe he (and similar
mercenaries) were the inspiration for Forsythe\'s characters in "The Dogs
of War".  

I agree that being in the middle of a fleet action limits your options.
But there are plenty of adventures that don\'t involve that. Use something
like the abstract system from CT book 4 to resolve the conflict and just
tell the players a story of what they\'ve witnessed, then let them move on
helping people.

Mind you, I have (as you\'ve no doubt noticed) a bias towards humanitarian
adventurers. 

My players are heroes (admitted eccentric, troubled, and quarrelsome
heroes) who would (and did) fight an Aslan singlehanded to save someone
they never met (bitching all the time about the damn Impy diplomats who
don\'t do their ^&*^ homework and couldn\'t negotiate their way out of a wet
paper bag); warriors who find time in a firefight to tell a toddler a
story to stop the tears; quixotic nobles who take on the entire Imperium
to preserve the peace on a border world.

It\'s fun. And isn\'t that the whole point?

Depends on *which* "current calendar" you are talking about. The Greek
Orthodox Church (and, reportedly, the Soviet Union) adopted a modifiued
leap year rule. They agree that years evenly divisible by 100 normally
aren\'t leap years. Where they differ is in deciding which ones *should*
be.

The grogorian calendar say that only century years evenly divisible by
400 should be leap years. That\'s the one that\'ll have problems in 3571
or so. 

The Russian calendar says that only century years that when divided by
900, leave a remainder of 200 or 600 should be leap years. It\'ll be off
by a day somewhere around the year 45,000 AD.

You just shot yourself in the foot. *This* is the 20th century. What

*third* millenium.

You\'re right, but that\'s part of a larger issue -- how to defend against
untracked projectiles. That\'s not specific to belt mining. One can assume

On that we disagree, although there\'s probably room for both solutions in the
universe. The danger, as I see it, with a metal rod run through the rock is
that you risk splitting the rock or drilling into something that just won\'t
give. This method is expensive and time consuming.  The jacket idea is also
expensive because that\'s a lot of material to use.

Since densitometers are commonplace, it is a trivial exercise to determine the
center of mass of a rock and to have your tug grapple it in such a way that the
vector of thrust goes through that center.

Well, you can look at it like this. As the leaders of a massive empire,
there has got to be one or more planets whereby they are seen as deities.
Like in Sumeria where the head of the city, (the lugal) was considered
divine and married to the city patron god or goddess (depending on the
Lugal\'s gender). Also I believe there were a number of south sea islands
where Cooke was worshiped.
So, de facto, they are going to be part of a religion. Maybe not willingly,
or personally, but I don\'t think they would be that keen on denying the
opportunity to please a couple of planets by recording a few seasonal
announcements.
Now, in a M:0 context, there is no way that Cleon is worshiped in Sylea.
He\'s just an upstart merchant. It isn\'t unlikely, though, that all the
Nobles of Sylea have a common religion. Now, as they expand, there will be
lots of primitive worlds that are much more likely to join the Imperium if
Cleon is presented as a god.
As a parallel, Babylon, when it conquered places, would take their holy
statues and bring them to their roiyal court. The logic/propaganda was, if
their gods payed court to babylon, so should they. (Incidentally, that\'s
why they carted off the Ark of the Covenant when they captured Jerusalem,
it was the nearest the Jews had to a holy statue.)
So, similarly, I would suggest that in newly confronted worlds where
religion played a major part, you would get a lot of adoption of
Cleon-as-(a)-god as a successful strategy for Imperial acceptance. The
locals would probably except if they already have a pantheonic religion and
it would give them a structure for relating to the Empire.
Projecting this onward into later ages, the proportion of new worlds soon
vastly outnumbers the number of old Sylea ones, so you have a lot of places
where the God-Emporer idea is prevalent. I\'m sure that it would eventually
become adopted as state policy.

So, the way I play later milieu\'s, the official state religion is a mixture
of the old Sylean one (which strongly resemble Akkadian gods) with the
Emporer and Empress as deities within it. The state, though, is secular,
and religious freedom accepted. Sort of like Britain has a Constitutional
Monarchy, the Emporer is a Constitutional God.

PS: I actually have some Akkadian myths reworked into a 3rd Imperial
context somewhere...

You have a *huge* unstated assumption here. If there really *is*
religious tolerance (something our society does *not* have), then
"be[ing] obviously different" is *not* a problem. Heck, if your faith
accepts converts it may even *get* you converts.

Likewise, you are *assuming* a "pressure to assimilate and fit in". 


> Another interesting point is local religion that is unacceptable to

They\'d have to be rather "far out" for that to happen given the sort of
goverments the Imperium accepts, I can\'t see many religions being a
problem. It\'d take something like *involuntary* human sacrifice to get
the Imperium interested.

> or even the local\'s reaction to "outside" ie. Imperial missionaries.

Reactions to outside missionaries I can agree with. But said
missionaries won\'t be "Imperial" except in having Imperial citizenship.

I suspect that a common complaint from *many* faiths will be "Why won\'t
you let us stop those horrible people?" when said "horrible people" are
merely following a different religion.

Frankly, I prefer an Imperium where the goverment\'s *only* interest in
religion is in making sure that you aren\'t causing trouble for members
of *other* religions. 

Given that "Religious Dictatorship" is one of the *allowed* government
types, the Imperium *must* have a mostly "hands off" approach. You\'d be
allowed to enforce your religion on *your* world (give the right
government type), but you wouldn\'t be allowed to enforce it outside
your territory.

Well they keep secrets from each other, Army and Navy intelligence
sometimes work against each other (see: Signal GK). How far rivalry
goes, i don´t know, but i suppose it is rather peaceful, similar to the
situation between the branches today (jokes and devaluation yes, maybe
sometimes a barroom brawl, but no real fighting)
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

In the MT Adventure _Arrival Vengeance: the Final Oddysey_ , intra-service rivalries are mentioned - in the Imperial Navy, between the crews of different ships. Apparently it is quite traditional, including such things as what to shout during barroom brawls.

When throwing bottles: "Incoming"
Proper response to thrown bottles (if, I expect, you don\'t have a bottle on hand to throw): Hurl bar peanuts and ashtrays while shouting "Sandcasters!". 

I got the feeling the rivalry was rather good-natured - the situation described was between the player character\'s crew (the Arrival Vengeance) and that of a medium warship from Lucan\'s empire. Even though Lucan\'s empire was invovled in a civil war, and the players were from an unaligned faction, old Navy traditions were in force.

Though I imagine an Army trooper who good-naturedly pitched a bottle would get his head knocked in...

The opposite would be true in space ships with tanks of pressurized
hydrogen.  Most likely, the hydrogen is stored as a cryogenic liquid
and if the tank were breached, would boil off and let out a jet of
hydrogen gas.  This jet would act as a cold gas rocket and could
explode if mixed with oxygen, either stored (life support) or in
the ship\'s atmosphere.  A mostly empty tank is filled with less,
lower pressure hydrogen and wouldn\'t cause as many problems.

The reason that low tanks are a problem on Earth is that they fill up
with oxidizer (our atmosphere) as they empty, creating potential bombs.

Hmm, this one took me  while to figure out.  I\'m a combinatorics nut, but a little
rusty, so bear with me here on the logic...

2d6 generates 36 possible cominations.
1 combination wins 9x bet
5 have the number on die \'a\' but not on die \'b\', lose bet
5 have the number on die \'b\' but not on die \'a\', lose bet

so you basically have 1 in 10 chance of winning, so you need greater than 10x return
to win in the average (9x return is the highest a casino will go, btw, they want to
make money).  It\'s no wonder I don\'t gamble.

Now, this betting scheme is pretty simple.  Gamblers, however, are known for thier
creative betting.

How about letting them pick two numbers?  Any pair nets 9 for each 2 bet.  Gamblers
might think this a safe bet (net win, higher chance to win any given roll, smaller
each win)

logic:
2d6 generates 36 possible combinations:
4 combinations win ?x bet
16 combinations lose
chance to win is 1 in 4.


How about red/black bets (basically odd/even)?  Any pair nets 9 for each 4.
Gamblers might do this one for a safe rider.

logic:
2d6 generates 36 possible combintions:
9 combinations to win
18 chances to loose
chance to win is 1 in 2


What you\'ve created here is basically roulette with 2d6!  I like it!  This has a
place in my Spinward Marches campaign (aka, The Traveller Adventure!)

That was something I\'d wondered about. Which would cause more harm to a spaceship/starship, a weapon strike to an empty fuel tank or a strike to one full of hydrogen?  Does the hydrogen act as a damage buffer or is it explosive? Or would it matter what kind of weapon was doing the damage? I\'d always thought it odd that designs such as the CT 400-ton Dragon SDB put fuel tanks on the outside and called it "damage buffering", made me think of those WWII soviet AFV\'s with the gas tanks exposed on the rear decks...

In High Guard, one of the best ships to be in when under meson attack was a config-7 (dispersed structure) hull - all those modules strung together on an open framework, chances are the meson strike would go off in empty space.

But isn\'t an Azhanti High Lightning Jump-5 Frontier Cruiser almost 50% empty space when it\'s jump fuel tanks are dry?

I don\'t think the rules pay attention to this, but perhaps (especially with very high jump capable vessels) they should. And I imagine battle tactics would be very, very different if there was a risk factor to carrying around full tanks of fuel with you. The commander would get to choose: Does he preserve his capability to escape into jump space at the cost of increased vulnerability to critical hits?

lasers at you without actually being hit? Specifically, this is a question
when using sandcaster -- if you are in a potential combat situation
(emphasis on potential) do you immediately deploy the ablative sand, or do
you wait until they begin firing? If you deploy the sand and then make a
vector change, you lose the protection of the sand, right? So you are stuck
on the same vector if you want to keep it\'s protection. But if you don\'t
deploy it immediately, then you are toast if the other ship opens fire on
you with lasers, since there is no possible way to detect the accurate
incoming fire until it hits you.

Or is the sand so effective at ablating laser fire that you only need to
"leak" it out?

How *do* sandcasters work, anyway? Do you launch cannisters that manuever
away from the ship and then explosively deploy the sand? Do you spray it
around the ship like water from a firehose or sprinkler (another possible
use for unrefined fuel :-)? Would water work as well as "sand?"

Okay, this is a muddled question, so I\'ll break it down so that my simple
mind can understand it.

1) Can you detect incoming fire from lasers (or other energy weapons, for
that matter) without being hit? If so, how?

2) How does a sandcaster work?

3) What is the SOP for using sandcasters as defensive weaponry?

One caveat: I understand the grav-focus lasers involve a grav field
traveling with the em beam to keep it coherent, so if the first shot is a
miss, you might be able to detect it with a densitometer. Or would you? If
you could detect it, that would mean the field is losing energy because it
is radiating, and wouldn\'t that be bad for the focusing effect? Is the grav
focus beam "coherent"?

One more question: If the 3I has grav focus beams, why not repulsors?

Designed by Robert Prior

This vehicle was designed using the rules in the Central Supply Catalog,
with the following variations: realistic unloaded speed, realistic stress.

Summary:
     5.00 displacement ton open-topped box;  38.5 tonnes;  kCr 37.8
Chassis:
     70.0 kL open-topped box (6.4 m long x 3.3 m wide x 3.3 m high);  
Structure: 2.19 tonnes of crystaliron, rated for 2.0Gs, body 0.010 cm
thick, 1 armour rating
     
Performance:
     1.50 MW TL11 fusion plus generator; Fuel: 59.3 L of enriched water
(59.3 kg), 100 hours supply
     Propulsion System: 1.50 MW contragrav with 6 minutes emergency power; 
Maximum Speed: 70 km/h loaded, 401 km/h unloaded; 
Range: 7009 km loaded, 39960 km unloaded; Agility: +1DM (2.0G); 
     
Crew & Passengers:
     Crew roster: pilot;  1 crew station;  1 cramped passenger seat
Communications:
     Subcontinental Radio (100 W, TL11, SmVcl);  Range: 300 km

Sensors:
     No sensors installed.
Other:
     Construction Equipment: crane can lift 11.0 tonnes
     63.5 kL of cargo space (31.8 tonnes)

The Foriq Transporter is a bare-bones design intended for bulk transport
in remote regions. Lacking any creature comforts except a canvas roof, it
is simply an open box with a set of contragrav lifters. Unloved by its
drivers, Foriqs are usually found carrying ore between mineshaft and
smelter, servicing operations too small to warrant their own loading
cranes.

Huh? Like, er, the 3I is based on the Age of Colonisation, with far
flung regions kept together by infrequent ships. Where it could take
two years for a message to cross the Empire. It was an environment
various religious groups (the Jesuits come to mind) flourished in.
Think: the dominant religion in Latin and South America today is a
direct result of how successful they are.

Why not? They give up their rulership and their language, buy into
the Cultural Imperialism, religion is just one part of that.
  The Judeo-Christian tradition is probably the one most familiar to
Steve\'s players. It makes a good enough choice. (In my own variant
universe you have the Holy Terran Confederacy instead of the Solomani
where the religion is an evolved version of Judism, Christianity, and
Muslim.)

The fellow asked for canon. This sounds like a personal opinion. Can
you quote a reference.

>the way out on this here world IMHO!
  You betray your bias. I\'m not going to challange your personal beliefs.
But from a historical viewpoint, there has _always_ been organised
religion. Ever since the dawn of humanity. Some times of more direct
impact on day to day life, sometimes less so. If you look at the world
_as a whole_ the same is true.
  So, when projecting a future that is as far in advance as the 3I, I go
much more for historical models than perceived modern trends. In
the end the averages win.

I\'ve no doubt that Christianity will survive, in some form. Maybe not in a
recognisable way. After all, Christianity as practiced today would be
pretty much unrecognisable to any 1st century "christian". There
hasn\'t been a religion yet that has survived for more than a century or
two that wasn\'t based on a previous religion. You could consider
Zororasterism to be surviving today as represented by its influence
on the Christian Eucharist. If you accept that, then I think you can
safely assume that it will be.

Um.
I\'m not sure about this. If you\'re not careful, you could easily slip into the 
Star Trek "alien of the week" syndrome. Traditionally, Traveller has 
concentrated on a small number of sentient alien races, covering them in 
considerable detail. What I don\'t want to see is the Imperium suddenly filling 
up with thousands of sentient minor races (dumb aliens are fine).
Saying that, I\'d still like a copy!

According to an article I read a couple of years ago, the US military were 
seriously considering using chemical weapons on Japan if the atomic bombs didn\'t 
work. After their earlier experiences of attacking Japanese-held islands, they 
did *not* want to invade the mainland without softening them up as much as 
possible first.

O.K. Filed as \'typical internet rumor (TM)\'. That is one of the things I hate about
this whole newsgroup thing. Not only it isn\'t possible to determine whether something
posted is true, but it also isn\'t possible to determine who posts it. Thinking about that,
there are at least three people I know that could use my name and account for posting

heh. Of course you\'re right. I\'ve really got to re-read before hitting
the ol\' send button. :-) I was caught up in the fact that the
tetrahedron is the minimum regular solid, and defines the "unit volume"
in a 60-degree system. You need tetrahedrons and octahedrons in a 2:1
ratio to fill space.

FWIW, rhombic dodecahedra* fill space in a 60 degree coordinate system,
and each rhombic dodecahedron has a unit volume of 6 (rel. to tetra).

Dress Me Up

Based on toys from Vland and Terra, the "Dress Me Up" set is an electronic,
holographic version of a number of classic, age old childrens\' toys such as
Barbie, Kisyakae Dolls, Admii, and the countless dress up dolls that have
existed on many of the worlds humaniti exists on.  "Dress Me Up" is the
Imperial trademarked name for one such toy but a number of imitators have
sprung up.  "Dress Me Up" is the most popular of the bunch, and is made by
Delgado, both Ling-Standard and Makhidkarun have their own versions as well,
but, as stated, neither is as popular as "Dress Me Up".

The core system consists of a rather sturdy weighted base, with a holographic
projection grid set into the top under clear plastic.  It is broad flad disc,
35 centimeters in diameter and 20 centimeters in height.  A viewscreen covers
wraps around half of the side of the base.  There are nine slots at the back,
two larger ones and six smaller ones.  The larger slots are used for data
cartridges containing the dolls (two can be displayed on the unit at a given
time), the smaller slots are for data cartridges containing the outfits.
Several small sockets, including one for power and one to save the dressed up
dolls to an Imperial Standard computer or storage device, are arranged near
the slots.  The dolls are projected from the holographic projection grid at
the top of the unit, and the clothes that can be changed are pictured on the
viewscreen wrapped around the base.  The data cartridges themselves are
extremely durable, and have a built-in sheath that retracts when the cartridge
is inserted.  The unit comes with a rechargeable battery built into the base
that can work for up to 30 hours before needing a recharge.  The unit has no
external \'on/off\' switch, but inserting a cartridge into the base will turn
the unit on.

There are several popular "Dress Me Up" dolls that can be purchased for the
unit.  Different areas in the Imperium tend to have different tastes, although
the royal family are constant hot sellers throughout the Imperium.  "Dress Me
Up: Ciencia Iphegenia" is the current top-seller, and it broke all the records
set by "Dress Me Up: Laashi", which contained the doll of the late Vilani
model turned actress and singer, licensed by her estate.  The doll models are
carefully created to not offend the community standards in the areas they are
sold.  The dolls, when naked, are usually not anatomically correct.  However,
the "anatomically correct" versions are usually kept on the cartridges and can
be decoded by a special chip available in versions of the unit sold to those
cultures where anatomically incorrect dolls would be considered offensive.
These decoding chips have been pirated though, and are very hot \'black market\'
items in areas throughout the Imperium.  It seems that there are enough folks
out there who enjoy undressing the dolls and placing them in lewd positions to
make the trade in the chips popular.

The unit itself retails for Cr40, and individual doll data cartridges can be
as expensive as Cr20.  The add on clothing cartridges retail for anywhere from
Cr2 to Cr15, depending on how trendy the fashions are.  The unit is not only a
childrens\' toy, however, and they are very common throughout the Imperium.
Universities use them to clearly illustrate the clothing and uniforms of
bygone eras.  Development kits are sold to art schools and fashion design
houses, where the information is stored and loaded from Imperial Standard
computer media.  However, use of the "Dress Me Up" standard to release one\'s
own, unlicensed product is illegal, and the trademark is vigorously protected.
The pirated decoding chips are often as expensive as the base unit, and in
some oppresive religious dictatorships, can be more expensive.  There is an
active hobby industry that collects \'old\', discontinued dolls, and the prices
fluctuate as they do in an collectors\' market.

Search the web for a book called "Fingerprint of God" for an amusing and
semireasonable idea about these flood myths and also (of course) who built
the pyramids, who were the antlanteans, where was atlantis etc etc.

I read it like I read "Holy blood holy grail" as SF, and damned
entertaining SF at that.

I never said I wasn\'t :) The Air Force was in the habit, back when the
armed forces had a budget, of putting on a display for us grunts - very
impressive. It\'s a pity that the Skyhawks will probably wear out shortly
(they are our only combat aircraft, BTW), because they\'re unlikely to be
replaced, and they\'re very good for their role (and ours are the most
sophisticated in the world). What is more our Army only just gor some sams,
for the first time ever (the government seems to think that if we need this
sort of thing we could go buy it, during the war).

Artillery scares me more, though. You get that rumbling like a freight
train is flying through the sky ...

I was looking at this, and got cold feet.  The mis steps did not bother me;
more, the lack of a big heap of cash to tide me over for the first couple
of years.  I still like the idea, but I do need to make a living if I am
doing this full time, so for now, it is stolen moments and free production.

Remember, there was a fair amount of enthusiasm for IG in the early days,
and then they delivered spectacular screw up after spectacular screw up
early on.  This happened partially because the first few products had to be
finished before they got feedback on any of them, and some that came right
after had to be finalized as the comments on the first few came in.  The
results of that decision echoed throughout the system.  (Example - First
Survey, and the potential disastrous M0 campaign, which would not make any
purchaser of the old volumes real pleased.)

Eventually, they got their act together and produced such supplements as
M0, CSC, FF&S, NAH, PE, and other products that compare quite well with
other companies in the industry.  Unfortunately for them, the honeymoon
period was over for many customers.  This happens to all companies at some
point, and you have to have mustered customer goodwill before that happens.

Consider - I am willing to buy new Castle Falkenstein source books sight
unseen.  I was also willing to do this for IG products, until I received a
series of ones with near fatal flaws.  Of my players, one refused to buy
any more products from IG after they sent him FS.  M0 Campaign was the one
that made me drop the pre order plan, but I still buy products after
looking them over.  A third is waiting for the new T4 hardback before
trusting them again, but figures if the new rules are good, she will start
buying again.

So, were I to tell my play group that IG is dead, they would take it with
equanimity.  They all want Traveller to succeed, but they all have a great
mistrust of IG.  I also feel both ways in full measure.

If IG is doing fine, or if someone else is going to take it over, then I
wish them all the best, and I am willing to be convinced that they "get
it."  Since other companies in the industry do, it is possible.  They just
need a serious commitment to quality, and to communicate that to their
authors, playtesters, and buyers.

I did one late last year that was based on the standards of living
associated with each level of social standing that got a 3:1 ratio for the
present day US.  It also gave a fairly narrow range of incomes - memory
says roughly a factor of ten from bottom decile to top decile, but I will
have to find the original to be sure.

You can create a conversion, by noting what the PCGDP seems to be for such
a world, and noting the PCGDP of the US today.

Unfortunately, if you use the standard Traveller economic model, you get
some really silly numbers.  Trying to fix Traveller economically is very
difficult to do, and using the trade tables in the various books makes it
harder.

Let me back that up a bit:

According to Traveller\'s official trade rules, if I went to a TL 12 world
and bought the kind of goods I could get there, and then traded them on TL
8 earth, I could expect to get about 40% more for them.

Cheap, clean power is worth a hell of a lot more than 40% above TL12
retail, imo.  Consider - one 10,000MW fusion power plant replaces a big,
dangerous nuclear, coal, or gas plant, and uses so little fuel that it is a
break even proposition in an astonishingly short time.

It is not fixed easily by just making fusion plants cost more - then the
high tech culture will use fossil fuels preferentially, and we know that TL
12 is a very energy intensive society, thus fusion must be price
competitive at their level.

Replace the jet engines on an airplane with grav modules  - bang - the
biggest cost of an airplane, the fuel, just went away.  I know this is a
change introduced by T4, and I approve, but it means that any world that
cannot produce grav modules is going to get very cozy with ones that can.

Replace the workers of an auto plant with robots that can do a competent
job  - profits rise as the workers are fired.  The Luddites had a point,
but it is clear that there is benefit to someone for doing this kind of
automation.

Not all of these are good results, mind, but just try to imagine the real
cost of almost any technology, and you can see that the progression is a
bit small.

My current feeling is that a TL is worth some fairly large factor, such
that a factor of 2 takes between one and three tech levels to do.  Having a
tech level represent a factor of 2 seems to fit with my reading of average
salaries in the US over the post war period.  Given the heft of some of
those other tech levels, I think this understates these actual results.

As a fix for the benefits this gives high tech planets, I am also thinking
of coming up with a "labor factor" akin to the PE culture, which reduces
the real GDP of a world, representing the vacations, holidays, and hours
off that a high tech culture may have.

    History is written by the winners.  All of the quotes that make the
"mythology" (as people are want to do) are from the future (and there\'s always
quotes putting the very same doubts on the activities of the "Star Vikings."
And in the present, from the RCs point of view, uplifting the others and

getting the relics before the natives and/or time destroyed the technology.

  If a ship that has fueled up tanks takes a hit, it loses "X" amount of
fuel.  If it has enough fuel to take 10 such hits, then it will remain in
combat for at least 10 combat rounds.  However, a unit that is depleted
from Directly jumping in, is going to be a combat kill after only one such
hit, maybe two!  Definitely a bad thing in my book...
  IRCC, this situation is true for CT, HG, MT.  I don\'t recall enough to
say this of TNE nor have I even bothered to learn the T4 version of ship
combat (once I saw ablative armor, I said no way - forget it).

  In any case, when looking to change a rule in a game system (GURPS
specifically), I have learned to look around to see what other thing the
change affects.  Likewise, I suggest that before anyone make a blanket
statement against GG refueling as being unwise, that they look at the full
picture.  Likewise, it is possible that under T4\'s rules, GG combat really
is a bad thing.  I am coming to appreciate why some flame wars get started
here (aside from the fact that some people just never learned to be polite
<grin>) is that what applies to one set of rules, doesn\'t apply to other
sets...

  But, as a final comment - mass fleet combats aren\'t even the same when
using MT versus HG or CT combat...

The idea might be to stake your claim and get it registered first.  Then 
hire (or work out a deal with) a local asteroid processing ship, or mine 
it and process it yourself, or have a mining corporation appraise it and 
purchase it from you.  Lots of options are available for the imaginative 
GM.

I would imagine that the competition for an ore rich asteroid would be 
very fierce.   Belters vs belters vs local mining companies vs large 
corporations.  Sounds like fun to me! :^)

Possibly...that was also a great setback for the US in it\'s codebreaking
efforts, since that\'s when the Secretary of State, saying \'Gentlemen do
not read each other\'s mail\' dissolved the group that had successfully
broken the Japanese diplomatic code.

He also told the Japanese.

This had the dual effect of eliminating our ability to break military and
diplomatic ciphers in a very perilous time, and jolted the Japanese into
constructing the Purple cipher machines, which were _much_ harder to
break. 

The Naval Purple machines were not broken until after the war
started, and it was in intercepted transmission of _those_ ciphertexts
that contained the information regarding the attack on pearl. so we _had_
the information, but couldn\'t read it yet. We did have the Japanese
diplomatic ciphers, and through those the US intelligence community (such
as there was of one) knew something was brewing, but they thought it was
going to be an attack on the Phillipines.

Gamblers always prefer high returns on low propabilities. This has been
more or less proven in horseracing: The low oddser have higher odds than
their frequency of winning thus netting the player money while for the high
oddser the opposite is true, therefore one should play on horses with low
odds to maximize returns but where\'s the fun in that?

Each gameturn represents 30 minutes (or some such large number) and each
hit roll involves hudreds of shots. If a shot misses you do not need a
densitometer to detect it, just a optical sensor as the beam lobe may decay
(angularly) very fast but it\'s also VERY bright. IMTU I require the
sandcasting ship to track the shooter to use their sandcaster though.

The gravfocus handwave uses a gravsoliton wave travelling with the pulse
and focussing all the time, otherwise the field strengths for the focussing
would be strong enough to be a weapon in itself. A soliton meeting a beam
wouldn\'t affect it at all.

Actually, I found it pretty easy.  In one of the episodes we are playing
currently, the players are all nobles at court in Y20.  One of the other
scenarios had a different group of characters playing colonists in Y0.  The
nobles are war hero Knights working for Mr. Shoes of the BIA.  Mr. Shoes is
a Count, and has a whole lot of power.  He does not like anyone working
against the interests of the Imperium, as he understands them, and he
believes the universe would be abetter place with one unified Imperium.  He
is aware of some of the flaws of the current Imperium, but is convinced
that it is only the relics from the SF that are causing the problems.

He thinks the entire policy of bypassing high tech worlds is suicidal in
the long run, and uses his agents to "encourage" assimilation of high tech
worlds, and good treatment of low tech worlds.  He also is not above
engineering a war or two, if it will insure that the world stays allied to
the Imperium, but not homogenized.  He also thinks that a low tech planet
today should be a high tech planet within the century, and is strongly in
favor of technology grants.  The Emperor trusts him implicitly, as much as
he trusts anyone below the rank of Grand Duke, and is willing to overlook
his foibles.

Unbeknownst to the Count, the Emperor also has others working towards
different goals, with similar power.  IMTU, Cleon figured out early on that
he did not know how to quite run a large Empire so that it did not decay.
Every previous large body had, and he had no special feeling that his new
Imperium would be free of rot, thus he set a number of promising styles in
motion and at cross purposes, in hopes that the best one would win.  He
works very diligently to insure that the conflict does not cause them to
actually fail in their goals, but does keep them pushing.  As soon as Cleon
has a good plan for how to set the course of the future, he intends to make
it happen, and to make those who were either on the winning side or good
enough to adapt major players.

A number of factions that are out for the money oppose the Count, and they
seem to have the upper hand at the moment.  Without the Emperor\'s backing,
mercy would be unknown in M0.  With the Emperor\'s backing, the crusaders
are staying even, and civil rights for member planets are getting more
common.  Unfortunately, revenue in the short term is a hard argument to
answer, unless you read a lot of history.

I have not yet decided whether the abdication of Cleon the Weak for Lintuli
was actually planned, or not.  I have been toying with the idea that this
was actually "according to plan."  I have also been trying to figure out
who knows the plan, or if Cleon is just winging it.  (One idea I had was
Cleon using anagathics, and essentially coming back as a descendent.)

Currently, the Knights are trying to convince a planet to join, and have
just been presented with a copy of the Zhunatsu School of Contact policies
by the planet\'s chief politico.  They are all a bit vexed - the most
idealistic is horrified, and the most violent is ready to kill.  They have
theorized that this package of war crimes in the making is really a plant,
or a lie, or an old policy that got squelched when it hit the high levels.

The flurry when they get back to Sylea and report promises to be most
exciting.  They will then get the interesting task of deciding how they
want to influence the Baron in the group.  He does not want to fiddle with
Moot politics, but that may be the only way to help the Count\'s views on
right actions prevail.  It will also be very dangerous, and full of intrigue.

c)  They have no relevant skills.

I\'d say Marines have their own air support (attack speeders etc) and

When did we as a civilization (read that world) even begin to consider  
that there were "rules to war"?  I don\'t believe the Romans had any 
compunction about destroying peoples and lands.  Look what they did to 
Carthage.

ObTrav:  What are the rules for the Imperium, or at least how total is 
their warfare?  I can\'t imagine them crushing planets \'cause they would 
want to incorporate the peoples at some point and gain the technology.  
So how do they fight?

	Thats true for a world you want to attack. But I dont want to
	attack this backwater low pop world in the wilds, as Lord
	Lucan commanded me to nuke the HighPop-TL:16 world deep in
	Gushemege. So I\'ll perfer to tank at GG\'s, as most forces will

	System defense of the GG is not for the system with the GG but
	for the systems 1-4 parsecs deeper in friendly space.

ISTR French land-based nuclear missiles have (had?) a fairly short range - 
just about long enough to reach Germany! Bet you\'re glad they left NATO!

IIRC the Japanese were going to surrender after the first, but the country
was paralysed by the refugees, and they couldn\'t sort out what terms (if
any) they would try for and get in touch with the US before the second bomb
was dropped. IMO three days was too little time. How long would the US have
taken to make up its mind in similar circumstances?

Designed by Robert Prior

This vehicle was designed using the rules in the Central Supply Catalog,
with the following variations: realistic unloaded speed, realistic stress.

Summary:
     2.00 displacement ton box;  9.89 tonnes;  kCr 52.3
Chassis:
     28.0 kL box (4.7 m long x 2.4 m wide x 2.4 m high);  
Structure: 1.07 tonnes of soft steel, rated for 1.0Gs, body 0.03 cm thick,
1 armour rating
     
Performance:
     610 kW TL4 internal combustion engine; Fuel: 305 L of hydrocarbons
(305 kg), 5 hours supply
     Propulsion System: 600 kW wheels; 
Maximum Speed: 54 km/h loaded, 109 km/h unloaded; 
Range: 272 km loaded, 545 km unloaded; Agility: +3DM (0.1G); 
     
Crew & Passengers:
     Crew roster: driver;  1 crew station;  2 roomy passenger seats
     Hatches: 4 manual
Communications:
     Regional Radio (10 W, TL6, SmVcl);  Range: 30 km

Sensors:
     No sensors installed.
Other:
     Options: recreation space, kitchen for 20 simultaneous meals
     Safety Features: anti-theft system, fire suppression system
     9.90 kL of cargo space (4.95 tonnes)

Larger cities tend to have many occasional gatherings, at which people
naturally want food. When circumstances do not warrant building a
permanent facility, mobile kitchens like the Todd find a niche. 

Although it is too slow to travel outside a built-up area, the Todd is
ideal for urban events.  Almost ten cubic metres of pantry space can
supply the kitchen for most of a day while the two-cook kitchen can
prepare 20 meals at a time.

Yeah, that\'s what they *want* you to believe. The looting and murders were
looting and murder, and it was for the good of the people back in the RC,
and that\'s the way I saw it. That viewpoint was peeking out of the corners
of the TNE books and needs to be presented as an alternative opinion, if
for no other reason than to stimulate debate.

If it profited Cleon and his family, you mean. But Cleon WAS the

Imperium was good for the galaxy.

The RCEC were grubby little looters clawing to the top over the bodies of
all those Wilders they stole from and killed. Better to deal with honest
Reavers who admit what they are. The Third Imperium, in the final analysis,
wasn\'t any better...read the dirty details in Milieu 0.

I don\'t usually have a problem with other religions, hey whatever turns
your crank.  But as for my kids, no way.  Last poster has a point, I
would NOT welcome any of the above in my home for my kids.

For the record, I disagree with a great amount of \'christian\' doctrine
as well and see it as potentially harmful.  Let\'s not forget the
crusades and what started them.  Or the Catholic Church\'s old "Buy a
Salvation Certificate" that led to Martin Luther leaving the church.

Sigh.  Religion is some very screwed up stuff no matter how you look at
it.  H. Beam Piper wrote an incredibly CLEAR and enjoyable story about
this called "First Cycle" which I heartily recommend.  Two planet
system, one race on each world.  One pragmatic, open and logical; the
other devious, paranoid and religious.  :)

Ooops.  My apologies, I accidentally typed TWO 3\'s instead of ONE..

That should have read "3000 Ton" destroyer.

I buy the argument about non-terrestrials, but I think they would
be wayy too well defended for a destroyer to even get close.  Even
the heavies would get waxed.  I doubt that anyone out there can
proved to me that starships can win vs. defended planets.  Why?

Well, for most TLs, simple thermodynamics. Planets have really good
heat sinks, ships do NOT.  This implies more energy resources for most
average tech level (ie. 12) worlds.  Combines with better sensors and
greater personnel resources, ships die hard.

Any bites?

Being as all we TNEers do is combat and damage is dealt in D6s, I think

   There Army still uses more A1s than A2s and for a reason. The A2s aren\'t a
whole lot of an improvement.  IMO, the only aspects of the A2 that are wanted
are the CITV (Commanders Independant Thermal Viewer) and the GPS.  The rest is
a bunch of electronic junk.  Has a bad habit for failing and leaving them SOL.
We can fight an A1 say w/o power.  It\'s not easy, but it\'s all a matter of
being a good tanker.   The A2 u don\'t have that option (needless to say w/ the
CITV u can\'t fire the Tank Commanders .50 cal buttoned up.  Tisk tisk... i\'d
rather not have it...)

I\'d alter the conditions where a Captain may be relived of command to be:

1.  He is medically incapable (either physically or mentally) of command,
as certified by the Chief Medical Officer.  The First (or ranking) Officer,
takes command.  The decision is evaluated by a medical review board at the
earliest opportunity and if overturned the Captain is reinstated and CMO is
indicted for mutiny.

2. There is no 2.

Personnel are not authorized to obey illegal orders.  Any Officer or
crewman who performs illegal acts will be relieved of command (or duty) by
the ranking Officer present and held to be tried for their crimes.
Personnel may refuse to perform orders they judge to be illegal, however
their refusal may lead to immediate arrest, detention and subsequent court
martial on grounds of treason, mutiny, or insorbordination.

An Officer or crewman carrying out legal orders during battle or emergency
may take extreme measures to insure the completion of their duties.  Action
reports must detail and justify all measures undertaken by said Officers
and crewmen.  These reports will be evaluated for possible violations of
regulations or laws by commanding officers.

IAC (in any case), that\'s how I\'d do it. ;->

That depends on how we reduce the asteroid.  Personally, I think that the coarse
work will be done in space with tugs, men and explosives.  Maybe portable laser or
impact drills to create the holes to pack the explosives in.  I envision fairly
large pieces being the goal, without gravity it would be difficult if not
impossible to manage small pieces and/or dust.

The large chunks would be tugged to the processing ship, and run through a shaping
process (using lasers or exotic-metal bandsaws) akin to what a sawmill initially
does to a tree.  For rocks without the necessary magnetic signature condusive for
a mass driver, a laser \'cores\' it, and then a metal rod is inserted.  Chips and
other debris from the processing stages are dumped into metal cans for transport.

I hadn\'t either. Maybe it\'s like an ice ring, but because it\'s in the
habitable zone composed of liquid rather than ice...not that I think that\'s
remotely possible, but that\'s what it sounds like.

Really? I guess I have the dates wrong in my head. I thought the

I sort of thought it might have been an exaggeration of a more local event,
like a a tidalwave in the eastern Med or a huge flood along the Nile. OTOH,
it could have simply been alogorical. Or it could have been a world wide
flood (or at least a regional one).

Before we go into panic mode on as yet unsubstantiated rumours about IG\'s
demise (here we go again!) why don\'t we take a few seconds and *think about
it*?

What is Traveller? - Traveller is the SFRPG that Marc and co  originally
released back in 77. It is not Imperium Games.

What keeps Traveller alive? The fans, and the people who spend hours
creating material for use by the players. What is the state of this
material? IG material is freely available (even *if* the rumour is true
they\'re not going to pulp it). BITS/CORE have material available and is
active. Freelance Traveller, Signal GK and TraV Chronicle still exist. SJG
are still planning GURPS Traveller. Marc is working on T4.1 and there are
other works available. Think of the effort people go to to get old
Traveller material.

So before we all go into a frenzy (and Phil McGregor goes into ecstasy at
GT becoming the published system;-) ) remember that Traveller isn\'t going
to die even if this as yet unsubstantiated rumour is true. It has survived
4 editions and 2 main publishers so far.

    'body' => 'In Harold\'s CoE setting we\'ve had some great success roleplaying as Terran
Marines.
The campaign that we worked in, was set on lagash, as a Terran Marine
platoon.
I played the "ignorant newly knighted butterball" and another fellow played
the 
platoon sargeant. The terrain that we operated in was like the woodlands of
the
pacific northwest. Though the objective was simple (pacify the local
guerrilla
forces) the task was difficult [TWITCH TWITCH]). Also, even though it was
the military, the "platoon sgt." and I worked closely-very much on equal
footing.

The roleplaying was very good (IMO) because we had to deal with some unique
personalities of NPCs. So, interaction was interesting. Plus, there were
several 
instances of adventures beyond the usual "go out there and secure the hill,
then
report-in." Though the fighting was intense, and we had to re-invent
tactics and methodologies
to fit the situation (that was deffinitely "challenging"), it was a war of
counter-insurgency.
This left a lot of room for "creative" techniques to outwit the enemy!

If you have never been in the military, then do a little research to gather
some ideas.
In example: talk to some actual veterans/prior service; read a few books of
various 
exploits; and finally, talk to some other gamers/GMs about their military 
campaigns.

Overall, I\'d say that lagash was some of my most enjoyable gaming, with
lots of 
great adventuring! [TWITCH TWITCH]

Worst adventuring in this campaign: those pesky snipers! (though I was
careful
not to raise the "wrong" arm, Douglas<g>)

Best adventuring escapade: after much frustrating "hide-n-seek" games with
the baddies, we finally caught them in the act; oh what a joy it was to
call in
the arty and attack speeder strike!

Most exciting scenario (for pure "shoot\'em up"): we had to clear an enemy
headquarters of the baddies. This was some good MOUT adventuring
(MOUT= Miltary Operations in Urban Terrain; ie, "house-to-house fighting").
MOUT is exciting, but a real b**ch to control and execute. Instead of 
being concerned about security on a two dimensional level, now you have to 
worry about a three dimensional arena, plus it eats up beacoup ordnance, 
materials, troops and communication. And you still have to deal with those
"pesky" snipers!<g>

Interesting point, though. We rarily used miniatures. Thus preventing the
game from becoming a "wargame" in miniature (nothing against miniature
wargaming, it\'s just that we we\'re there to role play). We only used some
miniatures for the upclose-and-personal stuff-and that was fairly limited.
The best aid, was a note book (you still have to take some notes for the
"warning orders and operations orders") and a map. with terrain markings
as appropriate. One of the best aids, was an erasable/re-markable
marking board w/multiple color markers. This was a geat visual aid tool!

Well, that\'s my .25 cents worth (inflation). I hope that it is useful.

John

To our Marines fell the most difficult and dangerous portion of the defense
by reason of our proximity to the great city wall and the main city gate...
The Marines acquitted themselves nobly.

This is a very direct, unsupported statement that is currently the
subject of debate in the US and overseas.  It is absolutely NOT a
foregone conclusion that the number of deaths WITH the bombs would
have been LESS than had we (the US) NOT dropped them.  The truth of the
matter was simple.  WWII in the Pacific (no less than the Atlantic)
was a war that the US did not start (at least in a military sense).
The attack on Pearl was without prior warning despite the best,
honorable
intentions of the Japanese.  Many, many Americans would have died in the
landings on the Japanese mainland and the subsequent occupation.  We
as a nation were unwilling to make that sacrifice, even if it were an
illusory one. We won.  That doesn\'t make it right before God, but it
does make it final.

If any nation choses to wage war on the United States or its allies,
then
it had better damn well be ready to suffer the consequences.  I said
that
I was glad that we reached a rapproachement with Japan after the war as
well
as Germany and am extremely taht those nations have prospered peacefully
since 1945.

We have a saying over here, and maybe you have heard it...it goes like 
this:

	"All is fair in love and war."

it goes along with this saying:
	
	"War is Hell"

Despite Geneva, there is really NO SUCH THING as a WAR CRIME.  There is
only
unjuust retribution on the part of the part of the winner against the 
loser.  Realizing this, our government has historically erred in
fighting
our wars overseas, and not on our home soil when possible.  We are also
concerned with ensuring that we don\'t lose wars.  This is the very 
reason why we deploy our forces abroad.  Fight over THERE, not HERE.  
Had we done this in the 1930\'s, one might argue that there would have
been no WWII.  

You may perceive those two nukes as an atrocity.  I perceive them
as a necessity.  Pray (yes I suggest you pray) that this necessity
never arises again.  Because there won\'t be a world left if its the
US that is attacked.

Umm, why not?  Such a church could be a pocket empire unto itself.  Or, it
could be a useful technique to spread the Imperium\'s message.  Besides, what
self organizing organization existing today is older than the Roman Catholic
church and Judaism?  Lets see, pre-revolutionary China, fine, Islam has been
pretty strong since its inception and significantly effects the politics of
a large portion of Africa and the Middle East/Central Asia, don\'t know
enough about Hinduism to say.  Is there a political entity/state still
existing today with the same government over a similar period?  I can\'t
think of one.  The message is clear to me, and I\'m an aetheist, religion
perserveres even the most dramatic changes in civilization.  At least as
long as they progress.  I\'m willing to concede that in a time of digression,
e.g. the long night, its not so clear.

If canon supports this, fine.  But you\'ll have to show me first.  I\'m
limited to T4 materials.  IMHO, nothing supports this conclusion.  One of
the great things about Traveller is that it never covered every little
detail and left lots of lattitude for creativity.

Ok.  First, you don\'t have to play in my campaign.  (Just teasing you
:-)Second, this is where my lack of canon info hurts me.  Does canon say
there was no organized religion before contact with Terra?  If so, I find
that extremely hard to believe.  Sure, Terran christianity would not
necessarily spread and dominate.  But I\'m talking about its survival into
the Mileu 0.

Like I said above, my idea is that if it can survive into Mileiu 0, and if
it can be known to Sylea, then its availability as an organizing force for
the Third Imperium is plausible.

Based on some more thinking, and a suggestion from some private email on
this topic, I\'m considering having the organizing principle be worship of
the Grandfather.  The teachings of the Grandfather would be considered to be
revealed in the writings of such sophonts as Moses, Jesus, Mohammed, X of
Vilani, Y of Sylea, and perhaps Z of Zhodane.  (Side point, if any one has
any info or ideas on whatever creation myths existed for the Vilani,
Syleans, and Zhodani, I\'d be appreciative if you\'d share them).  The end
result would most likely be an open-minded utilitarian philosophy that might
have remnants of strict behavioral rules, which would be based on ancient
traditions derived from practices necessary for survival in low-tech
environments, e.g., prohibition on pork due to trichinosis, water
purification practices, circumsizion.etc.

Sure, individual systems might have different spins on this, but as long as
there is an agreed upon core of beliefs, the church I\'m talking about might
flourish.  Besides, it also provides the possibility of heretics and forced
enlightment.

Lastly, I ain\'t got diddly squat on the Grandfather, so any info is welcome.

In light of Bolie\'s remarks (that hydrogen in vacuum is not volatile) a
starship with even partially full jump tanks has an advantage over an SDB
which doesn\'t even carry 10% of its displacement as fuel.  The fuel makes
a good damage sink, and the ships need it to continue operating, so it\'s
better to have more than less.

Of course, if we\'re using HEPlaR, that SDB has a lot of fuel too, and the
starship is perhaps using up its jump fuel on tactical maneuvers, or
saving its maneuver fuel for an emergency jump.  SDB is in a much better
position here.

So in the end, I guess that it all "just depends".

I think you math is off here.  Roughly 140,000 directly in Hiroshima and
Nagasaki.  Indirectly, hard to say.  Double perhaps.  So, say, 500,000.  (Lot of
long term effects counteracted by dramatic change in such things as diet and
health care, which vastly improved in the late forties, resulting in much
extended life span and increased health - witness the dramatic increase in the
average height of Japanese citizens.  I think the shortest guy on their rugby
team is 6\'2").  Estimated US losses at land invasion, conservative numbers by
those who wanted to invade: 1.5 Million US losses.  Approx 1% of U.S. total
population at the time.

I would think that you as a German, would be talking about the approx. 140,000
(same as Hiroshima and Nagasaki together) that were killed at Dresden by
conventional bombs.

Even my Sensei, survivor of Hiroshima, would disagree with you.

I don\'t mean to get nasty, Volker, but how many Soviets and Jews died directly
in WWII?  About 26 Million all told.  Why you\'d want to even discuss this topic
is beyond me.  I apologize for even reading this thread and will have no more to
do with it.

No.  The US treatment of Japanese Americans, for example,
was wrong.  Executing prisoners of war was wrong.  I don\'t
say that _anything_ done was wrong.

However, what the US did was neither against international
law (which is the basis for a "war crime") nor different
in what either side had done before (except in how it
was carried out).  The nation of Japan attacked the US
and the US had a right to strike back.

Hard to say.  Agression is generally considered wrong and
so an agressor does have responsibility for the harm his wrong 
causes.  I don\'t know that this goes far enough to support
your statement however.

To summarize, a couple of the main conter arguements (and I
don\'t remember them all) is that this assumes that you
will always have your time fully scheduled with profitable
business and that you never pass through a system to refuel
to get someplace else....

Started, in my opinion, back in the days of expensive knights and cheap
peasants.  If you let the knights mow down the peasants, everybody starves.
 If you kill all the knights, the peasants become leaderless, and soon
unrulable.  Further, it takes a long time and a lot of resources to create
another knight, so you would rather leave them mostly alive.  As a result,
you need to limit the total destruction to a level where you can keep
control, but large enough that people would rather give you what you want
than go to war with you.

Once the distinctions between classes diminished on the battlefield,
warfare became more dangerous.  Indiscriminate weapons also made it harder
to target just the powerful.

Finally we came full circle, and discovered that there are uses to avoiding
genocide.  This is the precedent Nuremberg tried to set.  Time will tell
whether this set of precedents is a good idea.

The Imperium eventually developed a set of rules of war.  These were more
to keep them the top dogs - no major destruction, and no Imp-only weapons,
which mean that no megacorp fleet can stand against the impies.

IMTU, I have a different system for M0, based on trade.

Every four tech levels forms a band noted for trade.
0-4 - agricultural
5-8 - mechanized
9-12 - stellar
13-15 - high stellar

Trade is generally controlled between bands, with the degree of trade
depending on the status of a world.

Status:

Class I: Unrestricted - For whatever reason, any trade is allowed here
Class II: Restricted - All Imperial restrictions on tech level are followed.
	Otherwise, no major restrictions exist.  Most worlds are at this status
Class III: Colony - Further restrictions exist, and greater supervision exists
	to insure that under destruction of local life and habitat is prevented.
Class IV: Protectorate - Special restrictions exist, perhaps because of
	resitence to Imperial authorities
Class V: Interdicted - A red zone.

Worlds outside the borders follow the same scheme, though they are numbered
from 11-15 for allies, 21-25 for trade partners, 31-35 for neutrals, and
41-45 for hostiles.

In general, the higher the number within one of these categories, the less
that can be brought in by merchants, the more freedom the Navy has about
the world, and the less the Moot wants to hear about it.  The closer they
come to membership, the more the Imperium is careful about local customs
and destruction of infrastructure.

For example, a world that is rated 41 is one that the Imperium would
generally approve of highly, such as a high pop TL 12 industrial world.
Because it is hostile, forces are generally allowed to attack with great
vigor if they get feisty, but rules of engagement will try to prevent out
and out war.

A world that is a 45 would normally be interdicted if they were in the
Imperium, and thus is not considered worth a lot of effort, but virtually
any captain can decide to act against it.

The Romans did have rules, but they really only applied to other people -
the Romans found them a fine excuse to go to war with somebody. Like their

What does it matter if its tens of thousands of shots, if they are
undetectable? :-) But I understand your point.

And a beam lobe is ... ?

Is it "lost" light, stuff scattered from the laser at it\'s source because
the laser beam is not perfectly focused?

And a soliton is ... ?

Explain it to me like I\'m stupid (\'cuz I am). "-on" is particle, right?
What is solit? Or am I way off-base?

I understand the fact that you need the beam to handwave grav focussing,
because otherwise you would need just about a singularity at the source to
focus the light. What I was wondering, though, was that if you *can*
project a gravity wave, say of only 1G force (or less even), wouldn\'t that
make a good thing for nudging a laser det missile\'s focusing array (and
keeping it from hitting?) Isn\'t that the idea behind a repulsor?

I have an idea for how you might be able to model the sectors in 3D.
Someone else suggested using wire and beads, and that\'s what I suggesting as
well, but with a difference.  You would mount the wires between 2 folding
boards.  The ends could be set in such a way that they would swivel so that
the boards could be closed up and carried.

Let\'s see if I can show you what I mean.

I\'d be very careful what you lay claim to:*> You might want to read about
the US assaults on Omaha and Utah beaches, especially when compared with the
British and Canadians on Gold, Sword and Juno. Both US assaults came within
a hairs breadth of failure and compare *very* badly with the British and
Canadians. If Overlord was a classic USMC assault, all I can say is thank
heavens the Brits and Canadians followed there own lessons learnt at those
obscure places like Gallipoli, Dieppe, Sicily, Salerno etc. You may also
wish to compare the US Navy/Marine campaigns of Nimitz and Halsey in the
South and Central Pacific with the US Army campaigns of McAurthur in New
Guinea and the Phillipines. By virtually all measures McArthur\'s methods
were far more successful with much lower resources than those of Nimitz
and Halsey (and produced a much lower body count).

The moral of all this, things are rarely as they seem and the individual
fighting man and woman is little different regardless of which nation or
unit they are serving with (they all bleed red!).

However, since this has *absolutely nothing* to do with Traveller, I will
reply only to email.

entertainment in the Traveller universe.  As with the "Dress Me Up"

comments are welcome.

"InterAct Music System"

The InterAct System is based on a standard design proposed by Makhidkarun, but
released throughout the Imperium.  Many entertainment systems are fleshed out
with this option, and Makhidkarun\'s software is of the absolute highest
quality.  Lower quality systems can be purchased from other corporations,
however.  True fans of "kaadmukim" (a Vilani word roughly translated as
"interactive music") swear by Makhidkarun\'s systems.

Kaadmukim becomes possible around the time that houses, businesses and
spacecraft become "wired", with either one central computer, or several
dedicated control systems.  In a wired household, room temperatures are
adjusted to a (pre-set) comfortable level when the room is inhabited, lights
go when someone is about to enter a darkened room, and go off a few moments
after a room is left unoccupied.  Many household items are wired, so that they
can be found easily should they become lost or misplaced.  Doors can be
automatically closed or locked, depedning on the pre-sets, outside lights can
be turned on when it is dark, an outside pool can be heated from the living
room couch, if such a thing is desired.  Basically, the house is \'smart\' and
does a number of minor chores as needed, and can be interfaced with any number
of specially made devices and robots.

The InterAct Music System takes this to another level.  Speakers are placed
around the house for optimum listening enjoyment, and all of the signals that
go to and from the house\'s computer are turned into \'music\'.  Pre-recorded
sound and music tracks are recorded onto a kaadmukim cube, and are played
according to the digital signals that pump through the household.  Depending
on the kaadmukim band\'s (or performer\'s) skill, the effects can be amazing.
The cube is never heard the same way twice.  The tracks are played in fashion
that is apparently random, although is based on events that the house computer
is processing at the time.  As wired items are moved through the house, seats
are sat in, and appliances are used, the music will shift and change according
to the original band or performer\'s desires.  Kaadmukim writing is an intense
discipline in and of itself, because the performer has to surrender much of
the control and order to the \'chaotic\' demeanor of a modern household.  The
basic effect of many kaadmukim cubes is that of a movie soundtrack, or piece
of classical music.  Themes are repeated in variations, all aspects of the
music are changed by the literally countless tasks the house computer is
performing, while underlying elements stay the same.  Some fans of the medium
prefer performers who forego any attempt of masking the randomness with order,
and enjoy the chaotic sound of what has come to be known as "gushiimukim"
(roughly translated as "music from chaos"), the random patterns of a household
are transformed into sounds and snippets that are, in and of themselves,
random.  The effect can be very fascinating, but can also be very
disconcerting and sometimes frightening as well.

Kaadmukim of all forms is a very popular medium, especially at parties and get
togethers.  An "asha kaadmukim" (roughly translated as DJ, or disc jockey in
our crude 20th century english) will usually have a special deck with the
ability to hold more then one kaadmukim cube at a time and with the ability to
mix them and change them as desired.  A highly skilled "asha kaadmukim" will
be able to "smack the cubes" (manipulate a deck) with an ability and
efficiency that can be downright awe-inspiring.  A popular dance scene, with a
huge number of off-shoots and mutations, has sprung up.  One such offshoot,
similar to 20th century rap, has performers improvising rhymes over top of the
ever changing music.  But, the way that a master "asha kaadmukim" can move a
crowd should not be underestimated.

I\'m sorry, but I have to agree with Mr Summers. And, as far as I can tell, the
"rules" (such as they are) do to.

There was a "no first use" rule regarding Chemical Weapons in WW2 ... and the US
and UK were quite ready to use Chemical Weapons (and had both stockpiles of and
plans for the use of same) if the Axis used them *first*.

As I understand it, recent (misguided) international attempts notwithstanding,
this is the current situation regarding nuclear weapons as well. It is
technically illegal to use them *first*, but quite OK (in a legal sense) to use
them in response to someone else using them first.

This is entirely logical. Under Australian law (and, as I understand it, UK and
US law) the law of self-defence allows a person to respond with *equivalent*
force. If someone threatens you with their fist, then you may respond with your
fist, but not a gun etc. (yes, there are exceptions, a 90 lb female would be
perfectly justified in shooting an unarmed but intent on rape 270 lb male
martial artist ... similar exemptions could be inferred onto wartime practise).

Since, according to international convention, waging a war of aggression is a
war crime, I guess that a loose interpretation is that everything done during
that wart is a crime as well. However, believe it or not, the "I was just
following orders" defence is *still* an acceptable one, under more limited
circumstances than applied before 1944 (when the allies, or at least the UK,
changed the rules so they could "get" the Germans and Japanese) ... and this
would, by my understanding of it, allow the ordinary grunts (and even their
company and field grade officers) to defend themselves against war crime
charges, while still leaving the political leadership and military high command
open to such.

I would qualify the above ... there are some things you\'re not entitled to do
*unless the other side does it first*. I would further suggest that, in the face
of a *truly inimical* enemy, then there *are* no real rules, except those that
ensure the survival of the state. In other words, if the enemy does not play by
the same rules that you do, or they twist the rules in ways no-one ever
intended, then all bets should really be off ... to use an example, the Bugs in
Heinlein\'s "Starship Troopers" or Weber\'s "In Death Ground".

Professional soldiers usually make such decisions (except for Nukes), and they
tend to be more conservative than their political masters ... and realise the
consequences of using the weapons better. In general, I guess, saner heads have
tended to prevail in the past ... and we can hope that this will apply in the
future as well.

While I am sorry for the civilian casualties suffered by the Japanese at
Hiroshima and Nagasaki in an abstract sense, in that they were truly the victims
of their own leaders, I have absolutely no trouble with the two cities being
nuked. The Japanese started the war, and the US were entitled to use any legal
means of ending it.

If a large scale war started today, then the situation would be different,
different rules now apply to Atomic Weapons ... however, for example, if Mr
Hussein decided to use Chem and Bio weapons against Israel, then the Israelis
are perfectly entitled to Nuke Baghdad (and anywhere else in Iraq) till it
glows, in a legal sense, as all these weapons are classified as "weapons of mass
destruction" and the use of any one allows retaliation with any other.

Or are you suggesting that the Israelis, in such a situation, should sit back
and recoil in horror and say "Oh dear, we should never even consider retaliating
with atomic weapons, because they\'re illegal. We would rather see all the people
in Israel die by Gas or Plague."

Given the difficulties the coalition had in destroying Scud launchers during the
last unpleasantness in the Gulf (they evidently didn\'t get a single one), I
guess that sending an unequivocal message like a nuke is really the only way of
stopping a madman like Hussein. Or do you seriously suggest that the Israelis
(or anyone else) should sit back and recoil in horror at the thought of reacting
"inappropriately" in that set of circumstances, while their citizens are being
slaughtered?

Well, they\'re back "in", sort of.  They never really left the political
arm, just the military arm.  And now, they\'re kind of "back."

Add the fact that a destroyer has enough power to accelerate a reasonably
large rock at any planet, and to keep doing it if not challenged
by other spacecraft.

If the Vilani are anything like modern Earthlings, it sounds to me like
you\'ve got all the resources you need.  Consider some English names like
Carpenter, Cooper, Hunter, Smith.  Or here\'s a couple that I know from
German names like Eisenhower or Mueller.

Probably everyone knows what carpenters and smiths do.  A cooper was someone
who made barrels.  For you non-German speakers (like me), an eisenhower
mines iron and a muller mills grain.  My German classes are years behind me,
so I may not have remembered the first name correctly.  If I did, I hope
that one of our native German speaking list members will tell me what an
eisenhower does to or with that iron.  (As long as I have your attention,
did you know that most Americans think a stein is a large mug (especially
one used for drinking beer)?  Weird, no?)

My point is that if you can assign professions or just about anything else,
you can assign names.

Regarding the Purchase of IG Products***

   By now, everyone here has heard the reviews of the various products

situation or whether or not the stuff is in print is irrelevant.  I have
in the past recommended to people that they buy certain IG products.  I
stand by those recommendations.

Actually, there was still resistance to the idea of surrender on the
part of the militant Japanese wartime leaders.  Yes, evean after the 1st
bomb had been dropped.  I believe that they just didn\'t believe
the reports that they had received.  In any case, that bomb was already
out there in the Pac, just ticking away, waiting to be flown in.   

Anything less than immediate unconditional surrender was out of the
question at the time.

   Given that the Japanese government had already been given terms by
the US and its allies, and the Japanese government had access to more
than enough resources with which they could have contacted the Americans
to accept those terms, and that the American government had no way of
knowing *why* the Japanese weren\'t responding, three days was plenty of
time.

   The US would have probably never surrendered, just as the British
refused to surrender even though they were getting their butts kicked on
a daily basis by the Luftwaffe in 1940-41.  We got our mom\'s stubborn
streak.  :-)

None. There were no USMC ground units in the ETO except for a small force in
Iceland early on. FDR\'s orders. I don\'t know why, but they were restricted to
operations elsewhere, mostly the Pacific.

Yes, i know! Anyway the war would have worked out, we would have been
screwed had it come down to the use of nukes. Had it not, Germany would
still have been the main battleground, screwing us all the same. But
hey, at least the rest of the world remained free.
ObTrav: Somehow this reminds me of the later stages of the Rebellion
wars, when friendly worlds were devastated by both sides (Attacker and
defender) in either way not allowing the enemy not to get/keep control
over vital resources. This goes to show that alliances are best for
those at the center of it as these Countries/Worlds only loose those
resources they are willing to commit, while the frontiers get beaten up
and bombed back into stone-age (Wilds)!

I beg to differ.

Traveller is in trouble if IG demises. Without a publisher other than SJG,
it is not likely there will be an independent set of Traveller mechanics in
print. There will therefore be a lack of support.

I think you are being naive to the reality of the business world if you
believe Marc Miller can keep lining up investors for a game that has
repeatedly failed over the short term. Anyone who does their homework will
see that more established games have had much greater longevity than almost
any of the editions of Traveller.

This is not to say that some crazed fool won\'t ignore these facts and
finance a fifth edition of the game anyway. But it grows increasingly
unlikely with each failure of the game to stand on its own two feet.

Traveller hasn\'t failed because it isn\'t great. It wouldn\'t have such a
loyal following if it didn\'t. But most of the market isn\'t as patient,
forgiving or loyal as the members of the TML.

My guess is we\'ll have to be content with the materials published by SJG.
Not an entirely bad scenario especially when you consider that Loren
Wiseman is the editor. But a little piece of the game dies when it ceases
to have its own mechanics system.

It would be easy enough to make a rule using a ten-sided die:  for each
parsec\'s worth of jump fuel *not* on board the ship, a meson shot has a
10% chance of going off in an empty fuel tank.  When you get to the newer
tech archs that doesn\'t work so well, though.  It certainly poses some
interesting tactical questions.

OTOH, maybe the meson decay happens along a line segment, rather than at a
point in space.  If this is true, the line segment might completely
intersect the hull, including the sides of the fuel tanks and the
surrounding components.  In this case, the dispersed structure may have an
advantage because there is less average distance along an attacking meson
beam\'s path over which a particle decay will effect the target; i.e. the
ship is "thinner".  Put another way, 50% empty space in a volume that is
compact overal may not be much when compared to a dispersed structure,
which might be 95% empty space or more, really spread out.

> I don\'t think the rules pay attention to this, but perhaps (especially with very high jump capable vessels) they should. And I imagine battle tactics would be very, very different if there was a risk factor to carrying around full tanks of fuel with you. The commander would get to choose: Does he preserve his capability to escape into jump space at the cost of increased vulnerability to critical hits?

Again, an interesting tactical delimma.

Those commanding the attack didn´t know there had been no declaration
yet. The atack wasn´t intended as a sneak attack. Yes, the Japanese did
commit many atrocities and killed many men, it was right to defeat them,
BUT NOT AT THIS HIGH A COST IN *PURELY* CIVILIAN LIVES!
It is the mark of civilized man not to stoop down to the level of one´s
enemy. In war, your target is to defeat the enemies war effort.
Crippling his civilian population as a cause in itself isn´t right. If a
few civilians die because of mistakes of because they were near military
installations is undesirable, but can happen, but intentional
annihilation of two major cities by use of A-Bombs (considering the side
effects as well) is amoral and wrong, no matter how high the loss of
military life could possibly go. I believe in the honor principle. When
i was in the military, or if i were to be called to defend my country
now, i would go and even die fighting the invaders. I am, in uniform,
prepared to defend my ideals and my country, including it´s allies and
friends. I will not, never ever, kill a civilian intentionally. He
doesn´t endanger me directly. If i were a civilian i would bloody well
expect not to be killed intentionally, because there is no reason to
kill me, as i am no danger. Every person has a right to life. It´s the
most basic human right. 
The attack on Hiroshima and Nagasaki was an intentional hit against
CIVILIANS, not military installations. It isn´t 100% proven Japan
surrendered because of these attacks. When they were made, it couldn´t
be seen as certain thatJapan would surrender as a consquence, especially
after the first hit didn´t provoke a reaktion.

It´s the old scheme of us or them again, isn´t it? We´re all humans! We
are one, even if we have different nationalities (which I personally
would gladly give up). To kill millions of innocent enemies should be as
hard as sending thausands or tens of thousands of our own men
into battle and risk their death, even harder than that. It is one´s
duty as a human being to protect the innocent and to punish the bad, but
not at the expense of the innocent.

Wrong. Some things are never right, no matter how dire the consequences.
When faced with the 2-way scenario: Lose the war, and not commit
atrocities and win, but commit atrocities beyond redemption, the choice
should be hard to make, but clear to see.
And here you didn´t even stand to loose the war anymore, the outcome was
clear. 
You could have done what you did in Iraq: Rather than facing high human
loss or nuking Baghdad, they called off the attack, since Saddam Hussein
was no real threat anymore.
Japan´s war effort had already been crippled, with the attack of the SU,
it was over, no imminent danger was present anymore. An War Crime
remains a war crime, no matter what you call it

Oh WWII would have happened but differently. I am glad you americans

I hope you (Americans) are not as stupid as that..."Duh, we´re dead meat

country! Sorry, but that´s how i see an attitude like that!

Yes it does! in an environment like this, multiple little sects and
groups formed on earth, in an environment like the 3I, there would
already various religions present.
In Latin and South america, people were forced at swordtip to convert,
those that didn´t were killed. The 3I or RoM had no special focus on
religion, their eyes were set on economic or military conquest. 
Also note that religious fervor and fanatism was at a high point in
colonization period of earth history, whereas nowadays,
Judaism-Christianity are more docile. Project this forward to the RoM
and you will get some fanatical splinter groups (as exist today). Those
will go out and settle new worlds where they can do their thing
undisturbed (See Solomani and Aslan for Solomani Sphere colonization).
Christianity is far from the most prominent religion today, others still
have more numbers (Percentage of Hinduism is growing every day) Also, in
our western world, Atheism and Agnosticism are gaining rapidly.

The RoM was founded by all of earth Earth, not only the western world.
To assume, a wave of conversions can be made in outer space by
christianity is absurd. Vilani beliefs are fairly uniform, oppressed
cultures will revert to their own beliefs instead of adopting another
set of rules strange to them.
The Conquest of the Vilani Empire didn´t mean Vilani were now a
minority, only few humans in any given system were Solomani, and they
had other things to do than to bother with converting the "heathens" to
an earth religion.

No, i was just taking today´s situation as a given and extrapolating
from the current trends. Over here, in Europe, organized religion is on
the way out: Churches are loosing thousands of members every year, and
this trend has been unbroken for years. Buddism isn´t really a religion
per se, Hinduism isn´t that strictly organized, Islam is, but in one
hundred years i expect them to be where we are now.

No bias here, just what i see happening today already.
And, i admit, i believe that proof of extraterrestial life would mean
that even more people turn their back on religion (but this is a
personal bias, granted!)

As a religion in a pocket empire, no problem. I just don´t think it
possible to take over dominance in Imperial space, because i feel that
even during the RoM, it wouldn´t spread as much as you expected (see
arguments above)

>could be a useful technique to spread the Imperium\'s message. 
But the imperium isn´t interested in the internal affairs of it´s
worlds. You can see that in the variety of governments within imperial
space. Also, on many worlds it would have exactly the opposite effect,
as two opposing religions often cause friction! Tryig to impose a new
religion on people who already have a given belief is not good for the
imperial cause. The methods of imperial growth, tactics and coercion are
very well detailed in M:0.

Dulinor came from Dlan, a world with it´s own firm beliefs, nothing like
Christianity. In the Traveller Adventure there is another
planet-worshipping religion. There is a religious pocket empire in the
Diaspora Sector, militaristic and also very much different. Oh yes and
the Church of the Chosen ones, a Vargr church! Other worlds have various
other religions, that deveopled on these worlds in various publications,
but i can´t give an exact quote here now, you´ll just have to trust my
memory. But this are all solitary examples of the gret concept: Many
small beliefs, some confined to one person, some spread over multiple
worlds, no one religion professed by the 3I itself, no imperiumwide
Religious structure. Such a structure of organized imperiumwide religion
would be at par in influence and net worth with the megacorps.

It doesn´t say that. There will always be pockets of belief, some
larger, some smaller, but none imperiumwide, none as the religion of
State (Imperium). The Vilani might have had such a religion as they
forced everyone they conquered to adopt their culture. However that
would make a spreading of Terran religion even more difficult, if there
already is a large and established religion in place. But somehow i
rather believe Religion in Vilani Space was not as strictly organized
(though probably very formalized) as we know it from Terra!

Actually, it doesn\'t.  Those rocks are in orbit and in order to
alter their vectors you need to expend a lot of juice.  A friend
of mine did some research at Naval Postgrad school concerning
present day asteroid defense.  The verdict is available on the
web as the first listing under the "Asteroid Defense" subject (so he
says).  And what was that verdict you ask?  The verdict was:

We die.  All of us.

(If the rock is bigger than 100m across).  

All of the nukes humanity has ever made would stop a 1 km rock from
doing the nasty on the whole planet.  

Its a sad prospect.

In any case, I\'m open to calculations.

As I stated previously, I just don\'t see  apoint in continuing this

your feelings in this matter though I differ with you in almost
every point.  As a soldier, I do not have the luxury of extending
the benefit of the doubt lest I fail in my duty to protect my people
and our way of life (whatever that is).

I can only say that I am committed (as is the US military) to guarding
our freedoms and I believe completely that Truman\'s decision to end
WWII was the correct one.  There may come a day that this deterrant is
the key to Amrica\'s survival.  Let us all hope that it will never come.

The fact that people find these topics painful is a bit of evidence we
have grown up.  Personally I think there is nothing wrong with thinking
the bombing of Hiro was evil, but then everything about war is.

The Germans have lived with 50 years of the rest of the wolrd badgering
them.  It wasn\'t Volkers war but it is his responsibilty to prevent
another, as it is all of ours. One way to do that is respect other folks
right to live as they will as long as it doesn\'t hurt others.

I feel bad for what we did, but given circumstances I would personally
drop it.  And I have been in the "no shit" situation I had to make those
decisions.  Am I evil?  

Well, I love the potential the human race has but am less than satisfied
with the current status.  That is why I am going to such great lengths
to detail the Rebellion and military operations in it.  Don\'t like the
idea of obeying orders and killing millions for an "objective?"  Then
put your money where your mouth is and get hanged.  

There are never easy answers in a grey and painful world.

And yet despite this rationality, somehow it all worked out.  Or is
there a smoking glowing crater where Germany used to be.  One can
dream all they want, but the fact is that for now, the strategy of
the West worked and we won the Cold War without turning Europe into
a glass parking lot.

Amazing how these things turn out, more or less according to our 
intentions, that is.

My brother and I have both been to Germany, have roots in Germany,
and did not want THAT happen TO Germany, yet if it had to happen
somewhere, we would have rather it happened elsewhere other than our own
home.

This isn\'t cynical, it is practical.  The US stood by Europe
throuighout the Cold War where we could have turned isolationist.
Yes, the price of Europe\'s "freedom" was  its potential 
annihilation, a terrible cost.  Yet it was the only way.  
And it worked.

I think this is a great idea but unwieldy for mass production.  Kind of
like a pop up book, eh?  VEry interesting.

Did you see my post on the 3D glasses?  How does everyone think that
would work or is it cornball?

My personal goal is a rotating computer display in conjunction with a
printer, ultrahigh res isometric map showing the systems and data. 
Lightwave can do this but it takes time to build the models.  The result
would be a lot like chview but MUCH higher resolve, to the point that I
could build in planetary systems and surface the displayed world with
continents.

That is down the road aways, though.

Well, Stephen, sounds like you have a typical group of players.  As to the
fuel potential of alcohol, I\'ll tell you what my old University roommate, a
post graduate chemistry student, told me.  He said that the proof of alcohol
was comparable to the octane of petroleum fuels.  A 90 proof alcohol will
run your car just as well as 90 octane gasoline.  You can fly a prop plane
on it and a jet will fly on 110 without any problem.

Using pure (no petrochemicals) alcohol in an engine designed for petroleum
fuels will shorten the life of an engine by about 0.3%.  I believe that I
read here a while back that one of the French port towns are running their
ferries on cheap wine (probably 58 proof).

I don\'t know how to make fuel bombs, but as for the Molotov  cocktails, 80
or 90 proof alcohol will work just fine.  Stuff a rag in a bottle half full
and light it.  The burning cloth will heat the bottle.  The bottle will heat
the alcohol.  The alcohol will boil.  The steam will ignite explosively.
The explosion will spread the flaming alcohol everywhere.

Lots of nice pretty flames and much destruction.

I used to make my players do the research on anything they wanted to do that
was not in the rules.  They had to prove to me that what ever they wanted to
do was equivalent to something in the game.

Good luck.

And let\'s not forget that it can _easily_ suppress piracy out to the
100-diameter limit, while also serving as a host for Virus infection.
Furthermore, "destroyer" is spelled with seven different letters and
"Templar is also spelled with seven.  Ergo, destroyer-class warships are
fronts for Templar activities.  Finally, a destroyer could launch bacterial
aerosols into the atmosphere, against which non-Solomani populations would
have no resistance and succumb to in short order.

Igenerally try to stay out of the crying jags abot IG, but I must beg to
differ with YOU. Your statements make it seem that Trav has gone from
publisher to publisher like some rag-a-muffin. To the best of my knowledge,
spanning the 20 years of its existance, barring a couple of monthes,
Traveller has been put out by TWO, count \'em, Two publishing companies.
Digest Group WAS NOT the primary publisher, at that time Trav still carried
the GDW brand.

IMHO this is not such a bad record. Show me another GAME that has lasted for
20 years! (That atrocity with dwarves and elves not withstanding) that
HASN\'t changed hands!

Heck, if it comes to it I have a few connections to printers through my
wife\'s art business. How \'bout it Marc, if you need T4.1 printed I think it
can be arranged! ( However I place this whole thing as THE ANNUAL FEBUARY
IG"S GOING UNDER PANIC, that usually follows the annual Febuary Flame
Feast!)

Well, actually T$R is now owned by WOC.  Taking a quick look at my
collection the only other game I can think of to be around that long is
"Empire of the Petal Throne", it\'s had three different sets of rules, and I
won\'t even try to figure out how many publishers.

content of anger tinge my judgmenent and ability to respond to this
discussion and offering of opinion.  However, I let it pass.
  Having said that much above, let me state this for the record:

1.5 million service men were not "soldiers".  They are Human beings.  Of
those who survived, many of them fathered children that Japanese Soldiers
would have killed stillborn (without even had the chance of being
concieved of) had America continued to fight the war.  By this, I mean
that by killing the fathers, the Japanese soldiers were also guilty of
murdering "future civilians" yet unborn.

  I find it reprehensible that that anyone should find the chutzpah within
themselves to cast judgement upon anyone of that timeperiod who were faced
with the decision "how do I bring this to an end".  Ethically?  His job
was to protect the american Citizens - not some Island who initated a war
with his nation.  He owed nothing to the Japanese civilians, but
everything to his own people, and that my friend, is exactly what he did,
protected 1.5 million soldiers. 
  Even if President Truman didn\'t need to send in even one soldier, and
outwait the Japanese - do you think his obligation to even one soldier
would have been less to drop that bomb?

  Put this another way - if your birth had depended upon your father\'s
surviving the war, and it was such that only your father would have died
had President Truman decided to use your recommendations - would you feel
that your father did not deserve to live?  Would you feel that you do not
deserve to live?  And finally, assuming that you have a son or daughter -
would they not have deserved to live?  And that is only based upon *1*

I think he is reffering to the fortress US surrounded by oceans idea-if
the US is directly attacked the world will have been in a bad state for
a long time, as our carefully constructed alliance system will be gone
and we have nothing else to turn to.

Nevertheless, all the diplomacy in the world won\'t stop someone who is

now the US has a graduated response.  But the nasty nuke IS and WILL

IMTU, (told everybody I was going to steal it ;-) you couldn\'t build
jump ships that large...even warships...but if you *could* then you
should benefit from a number of economies of scale.

With liners that large, the cost of passage might be (should be)
considerably lower. If three times as many people use facilities while
the cost to provide those facilities only double, the line should be
able to cut ticket prices by a quarter and still earn a higher profit.

There would be a fixed cost associated with building/running/paying for
a ship *and* a number of variable costs that go up or down depending on
your passenger/cargo/freight loads. Large ships should be able to spread
these costs out across larger "loads" hence lowering unit costs and
still making the same profit as smaller ships. 

One of the things we don\'t do well in Traveller economic rules is handle
the curves. Supply, demand, cost, etc are all curves, not generally
straight lines, and have you ever heard a Traveller player/gm/poster
talk about elasticity? ;->

	Sending bitmaps is bad for response, compare the hexmap (an applet)

	about 16kb in size, doing the work of displaying. the protocol

	so the complete world does\'nt take an extra bit of space ;-)

	is of course faster than java, and fractals produce load) in the
	other, and wraping html around was important for speeding it up.

	If you are using Unix, drop me a note, I\'ll send you a lot of
	perl&awk stuff, e.g. a start of a game server, and you can ask

Actually, you don\'t need anything so complicated as a steam engine.  Just
design a small boiler close to the pilot flame that boils a small amount of
the fuel to create a back pressure.

I\'ve always thought that it was kinda weird that the army was the only
branch that didn\'t have any air presence, especially since the USAF used to
be the US Army Air Corps before they were separated off into their own
branch.  I believe that the army is actually prevented from have air units
by the same legal language that established the USAF.

This reminded me of a story I heard out of W.W.II.  It seems that some
Ghurkas were going to take part in an airborne assault.  When told that they
were going to be dropped from 500\', the leader apparently looked somewhat
embarrassed and explained that his men were not afraid, but he asked, would
it be possible to get them down to 200\' before the drop.  The coordinator
explained that from 200\' a parachute would not have time to deploy.  The
Ghurkas leader looked puzzled and asked what a parachute was.

The person relating this story to me said that the leader was worried that
some of his men might not survive a 500\' drop.  But that a drop from 200\'
was survivable for all of them.  It seems he didn\'t want to lose anyone
before they landed.  Once parachutes were explained, he seems a little
disappointed.  They however used them and were amazing in the air and even
more amazing on the ground.

I have used this idea in Traveller to good effect.  You should see the look
on a player\'s face when he figures out that the NPC\'s were planning to jump
without "visible means of support".

>>PS-I know the sneak attack wasn\'t intentional, but did anybody know
>>(or _care_) in 1945?

I\'d like to make a couple of points here.  First, the Japanese *did* want
their attack on Pearl Harbor to be a surprise attack, and calling it a
sneak attack isn\'t an insult.  Second, the Japanese also wanted their
declaration of war to precede the attack as a matter of form, and perhaps
honor, but not far enough in advance to allow the US to step up their
defenses before Pearl or the Philippines were hit.

>I very much doubt they cared, but I\'m pretty sure they knew, because the

>as fast as the Japanese Embassy.

There is considerable historical debate about what the US government knew
and when they knew it.  Yes, the diplomatic cipher had been broken, but
translation wasn\'t even close to an exact science.  IMO, it\'s unlikely the
US *knew* the attacks on Pearl or the Philippines were going to take place
on December 7th, I don\'t think that would have been transmitted to the
Embassy IAC, but it is virtually certain (based on subsequent study) that
the US expected a Japanese attack to take place against US assets
somewhere..in the next few weeks.

As far as reading "messages as fast as the Japanese Embassy" it\'s possible
the people at State were reading them even faster.  I understand the
Embassy couldn\'t use their normal translators or typists, so they took
*far* longer deciphering the messages on 12/7 than normal.

Although the message to the Embassy did tell the Ambassador to make an
ultimatum the US would reject and then break off relations in preparation
for war, the messages to the Embassy, didn\'t pin point the target or time
of attack.  Frankly, I don\'t know if this is fact or fiction but the image
I have is the Japanese Ambassador being kept waiting in the Secretary of
State\'s outer office with a declaration of war in his briefcase until the
attack on Pearl had taken place and news of it had been radioed back to the
US.  An act of gamesmanship.

Now, about the bomb.  I\'m sorry all those innocent people died, ALL the
innocents, whether from the A bombs, the conventional bombings (on all
sides), the submarine warfare, artillery, small arms fire, prison camps,
and all other ways.  I\'m glad the US didn\'t have to invade the japanese
islands, causing a million or more deaths.  What Roosevelt, Churchill and
Truman ordered was not evil, what Hitler and Tojo ordered was, and that\'s
all I have to say about it.


Eris,
    notice I didn\'t mention Stalin.  When the pantheon of evil in the
    20th century is recorded he\'ll make the top 10, along with Pol Pot,
    Mao Tse Tung, Saddam Hussan and whoever was behind the genocide of
    the Ibo and Tutsi/Hutu peoples...IMO.

I\'d say you are correct in *most* cases.  However, ships in transit through
a system, those that don\'t expect to visit the mainworld of a system for
whatever reason, *may* lower time in system and costs by refueling at a GG.

IMTU, a commercial ship jumping into a system comes in about midway between
the habital zone and the most likely GG orbits.  If the system has a
mainworld worth visiting the ship heads in-system, if it doesn\'t the ship
heads out-system.  M class stars, in particular, don\'t have much in the way
of habital mainworlds, but they might have thriving bases around a GG
providing fuel, resupply, recreation and repair.

Ah-hah!  I knew buying "Aliens Archive" would come in handy.  One race--
the Tekundu-- are of homo sapiens stock, and are said to have been
transplanted 100,000 years ago.  At least one other race shows no fossil
evidence of existing on their "native" planet beyond 500,000 years ago,
leading the speculation that the Ancients had *something* to do with their
existence.  There also at least two other races in Aliens Archive that
point the reader more in the direction of "geneering" than natural
evolution.

Maybe, but after the "Rape of Nanking", the "Bataan Death March", the
lesson of the Kamikaze, the discoveries earlier that year of the German run
death camps (with rumors of equally egregious Japanese atrocities in China,
Korea, and Indo-china), and the suicidal resistance of the Japanese on
Okinawa...maybe not.

Wrong, Volker. 

The Americans JCS didn\'t think the Japanese would surrender without
receiving a severe *shock* and believed that delivering those bombs could
be that shock.  We didn\'t know how devastating they would be when we used
them.  We absolutely didn\'t know about the long-term effects of radiation
exposure.  These were bombs, really big bombs, but until we actually *saw*
their effects on the ground after the war they were just big bombs.

As for lives lost, the two A bombs killed, directly, less that the
conventional bombing attacks on Tokyo, under one hundred thousand, and
indirectly, simply doesn\'t count.  If we\'d known about the long term
effects, yes, but we didn\'t.

IAC, the total deaths, direct and indirect, comes to less than ONE TENTH of
the expected casualties of the US invading the Japanese Home Islands. If
the Japanese had resisted in the *they*, and we, expected, Volker, a ground
assault was expected to cause up to a million US casualties, with Japanese
casualties much, much, MUCH higher.  We are seriously talking about an
additional four to five *million* deaths, Volker.  

OTOH, this number still smaller than the outright murders committed by the
Japanese and German empires on innocent non-combatants during the war.  So,
if you want to talk about evil let\'s talk about the conscious, considered,
knowing genocide practiced by the German and Japanese governments with the
complicity of their citizens.

No, on second thought, let\'s NOT talk about it.

Actually, there are a number of other flood myths from other cultures, but
the explanation is probably similar.

There was an interesting Analog serial a few years ago set in an alterverse
where the Med basin remained dry and Neanderthals survived as a sub-genus
to current times.  The plot revolved around a tour of the basin and an
attempt to plant a baby nuke against the Gibraltar plug, blowing it open
and flooding the basin.

I read an account of a member of a Japanese peace faction that
had trouble getting across the point that this meant Japan had
to surrender until the second bomb was dropped.

However, this is irrelevant.  The US wanted to make Japan think
that they had a lot of bombs to spare by dropping the second one
right away so that they would feel more pressure to surrender.
I don\'t see any reason why the US had to gamble that Japan would
realise that the US only had a few bombs and end up wasting them
and having to waste a large number of human lives to spare Japan
the kind of tatics (bombing civilian targets) that it had already
been willing to inflict on others in a war Japan initiated.

The US strategy was reasonable way to end the war with as few
US casualties as possible and without needlessly wasting even
enemy lives.   Sure other ways might have worked.  But they
might not have.  If the US put first its own interest in save US
GI\'s lives, that was only it\'s right as a victim of aggression.
The US was under no obligation to sacrifice itself to spare Japan
from the consequences of the war it chose to start.

I\'m sorry but every comment I\'ve seen has said that GURPS Traveller
will use GURPS character creation.  However, since there are
conversion notes there is nothing to stop you from making up
characters with any chargen system you want just converting them.

Or you could make up similar system for GURPS Taveller.  Heck you
could get a bunck of people togother to make it up and post it
to the semi-official archive.

The comments about how the Air Force doesn\'t like remarkably useful craft
  like the A-10 because it\'s not "sexy" are familiar to me (and I have to
  agree, we should revive the Army Air Corps for the all important close-
  support; that or merge the services, and wouldn\'t that put the brass in
  a tizzy?); but I got a chuckle out of the comment that our modern Knights
  of the Air were also quite put out by the number of SAMs in Soviet
  service, and how vulnerable their sleek multi-million-dollar fighters
  were to a thousand-dollar missile.

See, I have an SCA background, and I know from experience that, whenever
  possible, the heavy infantry ban the light infantry missile troops from
  the field.  They hate putting on their armor and tromping out onto the 
  war field for some good fun and head-bashing, only to get picked off 
  quickly by some "untrained", unarmored yokel with a javelin or bow.  
  Sound familiar?

(I gather this was also pretty much the attitude of the real knights, back
  when missile weapons that could be effective against an armored man
  started being carried by peasant levies...)

I guess it\'s universal... no doubt in the future, we\'ll have Imp BD troops
  grousing about "cheap" TL8 snipers with Crunch Guns.

    In a nuclear world, that\'s the only proper response.   That\'s the only

Most of the "looting and murdering" were done by the less scrupulous of the
RCES freelancers who are stated to be pirates for all intents and purposes.
It isn\'t my doubt that the RC would crack down on them if they become aware of
allegations.  If these aren\'t provable, it\'s not any more than Guild
propaganda, though i\'d bet an allegation is enough to warrant a covert
observation from the RCES.

Not all of em (or nearly a large fraction... scarceley a small fraction
according to canon) were Reavers.  Some were.  The Coalition was the people
that made it up.  Some bad, some good, some indifferent and some plain evil.
I\'d say the "evil and bad" aren\'t more than a small small minority.

They were told *before* either bomb was dropped to surrender. They
chose not to. Bad move.

BTW, they tried to get the Soviets to work with them for terms
(since they didn\'t want the only terms we would ever
accept--unconditional surrender) and the Soviets told them to take a
walk since they planned on getting a piece of the pie at that point.

As for what we would do--I guess we\'ll know when we are in that
position (remind the folks in hell to buy ice skates when this is
about to happen).

So we fight each other. That\'s clever of us.

And when we fight, we use our weapons. Whatever they may be, from sharp
rock to nuke or biotoxin, we use them to achieve whatever end we had in
mind when we started fighting - usually making the other lot stop fighting.

There are no clear-cut and simple answers. There is no moral right and
wrong. There is simply a big unholy mess in which we make our decisions and
try to do what we think is best for the little bit we are responsible for.
In an imperfect world that\'s all we can do - there\'s a limit to what I can
assume responsibility for. I can\'t stop the other side from killing my
friends and bombing my parents\' house without killing some of them. If I
hold a command position, I have to take responsibility for authorising
bombing raids or whatever, that might kill innocents. But I have to choose
between doing that or trying to take the city by infantry assualt (or
whatever). Which carries its own consequences.

There are no easy answers. I will be judged as both right and wrong by
history. But I must make a decision. Use nuclear weapons or face assaulting
an island chain defended by people willing to use Kamikazi and Sleeping
Dragon? No easy option.
 
There is no difference between firebombing Tokyo (or Dresden) and dropping
a nuclear device on Nagasaki. There is no difference between using phosgene
in the trenches and crushing men under the trreads of tanks or
machine-gunning survivors in the water after sinking a troopship. There is
no difference between torpeding an unarmed freighter without warning and
nursing an injured man back to health before shooting him as a spy.

None of these things are \'morally right\' - ever.

But we do them because they are sometimes necessary in our way of life.

Instead of wrangling about what\'s right and what\'s not, consider this:

We, as people, put others in charge over us. They lead us to war and we
carry out despicable acts in the name of freedom, justince or whatever -
some of these acts in my opinion ENTIRELY NECESSARY and I\'m bloody glad
someone carried them out, by the way, because my life is quite pleaseant as
a result.

The single answer is to realise this - the only morally right thing to do
about war is to forget the closed-cycle arguments about what\'s rigjht and
what\'s not, and understand that humanity is all one group. There\'s no
reason to fight. As a species, we need to grow up a little and make
warfarte obsolete. THAT is morally right. Not trying to decide if Dresden
or Hiroshima was right or wrong. Neither were. Both were results of our
grave Human stupidity, and were local solutions that seemed workable at the
time.

Until the day comes that we advance betyond out blinkered state, the use of
weapons will be a necessity in our world. They at least provide some sort
of solution to our problems

    'body' => 'I\'m ill, and this part is not the best, but here goes:

Organisation: The Ine Givar was originally an outgrowth of a political
movement and that heritage shows in its organisation. The movement is
directed by Central Committee, a group of thirteen individuals headed
by a President. In theory the Central Committee is the supreme body and
the President merely chairs the Central Committee and all decisions are
made collectively. However, in reality, the Ine Givar have never actually
conformed to this theoretical pattern. For the greater bulk of its
history, the real seat of power was the President, with the Central
Committee acting as a debating forum for the more powerful factions within
the organisation. Even during the so called "Committee Period" (1077 to
1114) the real power did not actually reside with the Central Committee
(at that time the Ine Givar were effectively controlled by the Zhodani
and Sword World\'s intelligence services).

Below the Central Committee are the Quadrants. Each Quadrant consists
roughly of four Imperial Subsectors and these are the basic organisational
unit of the Ine Givar. Each Quadrant is run by a Committee of seven
individuals. These are charged with carrying out the overall directions of
the Central Committee. Each Quadrant divides itself into a miltary and a
political arm, both completely independent of the other but answering to
the Quadrant Committee. For reasons of security, no person in the political
arm is supposed to have any knowledge of the personnel of the military arm
and vis versa, however, as might be expected this is not always possible.
Both the military and political arms then divide themselves into a number
of Districts (the actually size of an individual District is dependent on
a number of factors, but most cover between four and six worlds), though
the military and political districts do not neccessarily correspond.

The political arm is responsible for organising all forms of political
agitation, from student demonstrations to workers strikes; and is the most
"visible" face of Ine Givar. The military arm is divided into four distinct
types: Main force units (Guerilla Cadres), Direct action units (the classic
terrorist), Intelligence units (deep agents planted for intelligence
gathering), and Special operations groups (Agent Provectures). In order to
minimise the security risks, both the military and political arms are
organised along the classic "Cell structure". Under this organisation, each
"cell" is a completely independent unit with only the cell leader knowing
any outside contacts, and even then only one contact up (ie the cell leader
will know how to contact one cell in the organisation above them and any
cells subordinate to them). Thus if a cell leader is captured, whilst all
the cells below may be compromised, the cells above and across are far less
likely to be compromised. This "cell structure" has remained relatively
constant throughout the Ine Givar\'s existance (indeed it is the most common
organisational structure of such groups).

Aims and Philosphy: The driving aim of the Ine Givar has always been to
reform the Imperium into a democratic society. This philopshy unlies all of
the organisation\'s aims and demands. Its manifesto can be summed up quite
simply
They demand: an end to the nobility, that the Imperium remove all corrupt
and oppressive local governments, that the Imperium restrains the preditory
economic activities of Imperial corporations, and that the Imperial security
apperatus be replaced with a system not riddled with corruption and brutality.


If I\'ve missed out anything, or anyone can come up with more ideas, please
let me know. I\'m planning to put this up on my web site.

Reminds me of the game I and a few friends used to play. What got us
started was when a game store got in some 8-sided dice that were made
of the same "ivory" plastic as good six-sided ones. Rounded edges,
ddeep, *black* pips the whole bit. Yes, *pips*. Sionce they looked so
much like casino dice, we re-wrote the rules for craps to use them.

2 is still "snake-eyes".
3 is still 3 (i forget what special significance 3 has in craps)
9 takes the place of 7
15 takes the place of 11
16 is "boxcars" (actuallt "the rings" is more like it)

It\'s great fun to be playing this, and have someone who wasn\'t paying
attention suddenly jerk around when he hears "Ok, 14\'s your point..."

They are a disc shaped animal. Think of a furry frisbee with three eyes
and a mouth placed along the edge somewhere. They "purr" and like
cuddling up to warm blooded critters. They make nice, affectionate
pets. And, being desert critters, they are neat (ie droppings will be
bone dry pellets, with little odor). 

They are boneless, and travel by a sort of "inchworm" technique. They
apparently have *some* means of "gripping" rough surfaces for climbing.
And they may be able to use part of their body like a suction cup on
smoother surfaces.

They adapt well to zero-g. They like gliding on air currents. It has
been claimed that they can steer but this is not considered proven.

They have an unfortunate tendency to like to crawl onto the faces of
"special friends" while said friends are asleep. 

In cold conditions they "wrap up" into a small sphere to conserve body
heat, and they can hibernate (Martian winter is approx 10 earth months!)

Also, coming from such a harsh environment, they will reporoduce fairly
rapidly to the extent of the carrying capacity of the environment.
Litters of eight every 64 days are typical for well fed flat cats. The
young are quite small (coaster size flat, meatball sized when
"wrapped"). They mature rapidly. And by the time "mother" is ready for
her next litter, so are her kids. 

The sexuality of Martian aninmals is a bit weird. They tend to be "male"
as "children" and and "female" as adults. So isolating a flat cat
*doesn\'t* mean it can\'t reproduce.

In short, they are *tough*, but lovable. And a potential *disaster* if
overfed while on a long normal space flight. These are what David
Gerrold got the idea for tribbles from. When he later contacted
Heinlein to apologize, Heinlein told him not to worry. They weren\'t
*that* close, and besides they\'d *both* swiped the idea from "Pigs is
Pigs" (a story involving out of control guinea pigs)

This I think, has to be one of the best summaries of the whole stupid
situation/argument I\'ve seen.

Now can we please take the aruments as to wheither or not any warring
nation was justifed in doing anything to anyone to email and restict
ourselves to discussions as to how the 3rd Imperium et al handles the
question of morality in warfare. Are the Imperial rules of war a
genuine attempt to limit the brutality of war or just a cynical attempt
by the 3rd Imperium to limit any potential rivals? (my take is it\'s
both).

I don´t argue about using weapons in self defense, but in german law we
have something we call "excess of self-defense", when the attacked goes
beyond what is objectively necessary to ones own self defense.
Self-defense is not about beating the other party to a pulp, it´s about
ensuring one´s own safety.
When Japan was nuked, it´s military back had already been broken, sooner
or later, the peace party in Japan would have taken over, anyway, Japan
was no threat to the US anymore! Thus the nuking was taking things over
the top! 

> None of these things are \'morally right\' - ever.
I agree completely. The point i was making was just that with the event
of nuclear bombs, the insanity has reached a degree where no man should
remain silent. We now have the capability to not only destroy an enemy,
but to poison his land for years, even decades to come. We can destroy
our planet. This insanity has to end, but it won´t if nobody speaks his
mind. The nuke is a brainchild of the insanity of the 20th centure, now
with it ending soon, we should put the nuke to death with it.
 
> But we do them because they are sometimes necessary in our way of life.
But some of theose thing are not necessary. There should always be
alternatives to armed conflict, there is always an alternativeto nukingf
an enemy.

Use of force is never a solution. Violence breeds violence.

The Imperial Rules of War prohibit nations from using nuclear weapons.
I´d expect a strong and decisive Imperial Creackdown would follow such
an act. How this would look like in detail, i don´t know.

Quite right about that! I just felt the level of insanity reached

Exactly, that´s one lesson we had to learn the hard way. But that´s what
history is all about: Learning from it and not making the same mistakes
again. That´s the reason i object to defending the use of the bomb.
Justifying it makes it easier to justify it the next time round-only
that that world cannot afford a next time round!

I know that this is often the alternative. However in german military we
were taught that following orders is not an excuse. The individual is
asked to think for himself and disobey illegal orders, for obeying
illegal orders is a crime. If me not dropping the bomb will possibly
save thousands of lives, but cost my own, it will be hard, but as i
believe it´s the progress of humainity that matters, i think i´d chose
me as the one to go! Someone has to make a start somehow.

Quite right.

Sorry, but the result is overhelmingly *positive*. 

AT THE TIME THE DECISION WAS MADE, the *only* alternative seemed to be
invading the home islands, which would *certainly* have resulted in
casualties in the millions on *both* sides.

A demo blast was *not* an alternative. They had *three* bombs *total*.
One was used in the initial test at Alamagordo. That left *two*. One of
those (the one used on Nagasaki) was of an *untested* design. It would
be a minimum of three months (maybe six, I don\'t have that book handy)
before they had enough fissionables to assemble another.

That means that any "demonstration" would have used the *only* bomb
that they knew would work. Leaving them with one that *might* work. And
months before there\'d be any more.

Without a demonstration, your alternatives are "keep on bombing
conventionally, while preparing to invade the islands", don\'t do
*anything*, and "use the nuclear bombs". 

Someone else posted the casualty levels expected for continuing the
*conventional* bombing. And I\'ve just posted the casualty estimates for
an invasion. So *that* approach will result in more casualties than the
atomic bombs did. And it is *very* unlikely that this "more of the
same" approach would have gotten a surrender until *after* the
invasion. 

"Do nothing" is *not* a viable option. It certainly won\'t given the
other side any incentive to surrendeer, and it\'s quite likely to tempt
him into more attacks.

Also note that if the Japanese hadn\'t surrendered after Nagasaki, we\'d
have been in a *real* fix.

> Yes Evil! It doesn=B4t matter that it was against "The Enemy!!", it was

Sorry. Those cities *were* legitimate targets. The *only* reason that
they hadn\'t *already* been bombed flat was that they and a few others
had been set aside so that if the atomic bombs worked (something that
the military commanders weren\'t willing to believe until after the
Alamagordo test) they\'d be able to asses the effects without having
arguments about what had been damaged by earlier raids.

Those cities had both port facilities and factories making war
materials. That qualified them as legitimate targets.

So unless you have something that miraculously reduces the casualties
from the continued conventional bombing, and from the invasion, or
shows that the *Allies* had a reason to suspect that surrender was
likely soon your argument pretty much falls apart. 

And remember that as far as the people giving the orders knew, this was
just a "big bomb". In oyther words, just a way of getting the *same*
effect as a massive raid by using one bomb and one plane.

*Don\'t* try to argue based on things that you know and they didn\'t
know. And don\'t try to argue based on "facts" that aren\'t.

Using the bombs wasn\'t "nice". It wasn\'t meant to be. But given the
data available, I don\'t really see *how* any other decision could have
been made.

No, he\'s correct. We *were* reading the traffic for the Japanese
embasy. In fact, we were decoding it *faster* than they were. Trouble
is, all the embassy knew was that they were to deliver the declaration
of war at a precise time, not *why*. 

So we *knew* it was going to be war (but not until late on DEC 6th). We
didn\'t know *where* they were going to attack. That involved Naval
codes, and worse, there wasn\'t any comm traffic to intercept, as the
task force had not only sailed under radio silence, but their regular
radio operators were left back home so that the folks trying to keep
track of fleet deployments by recognizing the "fist" (unique rythym
patterns of an operator sending Morse code) of the operators would
think the units in question were still back at home.

Several books on cryptography (one of my long term hobbies) deal with
this.

Believe it or not, this already exists!

In Japan, computer programs that display characters (usually popular
Anime characters) in various outfits are quite popular. Though the
wardrobe options aren\'t as elaborate. 

Rather than be "anatomically incorrect", they just don\'t let you remove
the underwear.  Though some *will* if you are either persistent enough,
or know the "trick". 

I picked this up from the FAQ in one of the anime groups. :-)

So we are on the way!

The fact that it\'d be *very* obvious. Remember, that asteroid is in
"plain sight". And so is his approach. Asteroids are *not* close
together. You\'d consider it unusual to be close enough to another
asteroid to see it as a 6th magnitude point of light (ie very faint star).

That was part of the point I was trying to make. There *aren\'t* any
"good hunks". Aside for the settling into layers caused by gravity that
seperates the stony and metallic parts, the composition of an asteroid
is going to be *quite* homogenous.

It takes a planet with various sorts of "weathering" and especially
*water* flowing thru hot rock to create mineral "veins". 

Unless your find is at a layer boundary or has a "core" any given chunk
of it will be much like any other. If it includes a boundary, then one
side will be one material, the other side will be the other. But again
the two types will be pretty uniform. 

It takes a fairly large body to have a core (be it rock in an icy/CHON
body, or metal in a stony body. So the core is going to be a bit too
large to haul off in one chunk. It\'ll likely be hundreds of meters
across.

Make no mistake, the Army hs the largest air force of all the services.
They are called helocopters and are ultrabad.

However, there is an aggreement chopping all fixed wing air to the

Notice there is still an Air Force,and for a reason.  I got shot at by

are not the endall of air war and we have measures, called "wild

of 1 million dollars itself.

The military leaders of Japan had already attempted a coup to prevent
surrendering to the US after the first bomb went off. They did not
believe there was another bomb available and felt the first one was
all we had. Even after the second bomb went off the military leaders
were willing to fight to the end; only the Emperor\'s insistance that
enough was enough stopped them.

(I assume you mean \'right\' instead of \'wrong\', right?)

Anyway, that\'s the only point I wanted to make here. I happen to disagree
with you about the propiety of using weapons with that large a range for
collateral damage that close to civilians, but I don\'t think this is the
proper forum to go into that.

>However, what the US did was neither against international law (which is
>the basis for a "war crime")

Hmm... I may be wrong here, but don\'t international law have something
about not targeting civilians?

>			...nor different in what either side had done
>before (except in how it was carried out). 

Eh? What does that have to do with a purely philosophical debate about
right and wrong? If it\'s wrong then the fact that others have done it
too is a poor defense. If it\'s right it is irrelevant.

>The nation of Japan attacked the US and the US had a right to strike back.

Certainly the US had a right to strike back. That\'s not the question. The
question is whether they had the right to use nuclear weapons against two
major cities brim full of civilians to do so.

I would change that to "unless you have good reason to believe that the
enemy will do it again". I quite agree that a population should not
allow itself to be destroyed rather than to break some of its own rules.
That\'s why I\'m not sure that using nuclear bombs on Japan couldn\'t be
justified with a "lesser of two evils" argument. But I\'m convinced
that using then were "an evil". Maybe a lesser of two, but definitely
an evil. Just as the Allied terror-bombings of German cities that were
no longer military targets was an evil.

Basically my objections boils down to my belief in the concept of a
difference between civilians and military. If one dosen\'t believe in
such a difference, then I agree that Hiroshima and Nagasaki were
legitimate targets for nuclear bombardment. If one does believe in
such a difference, the question becomes more complicated.

I believe they should use whatever means necessary to kill Hussein that
involved the least civilian casualties. If the only means they had to
achieve that goal was a nuclear missile, then I believe they would be
justified in using one. But only if it was the only possible means. Not
if other reasonable alternatives existed. Whatever weapon that involved
the smallet possible colatteral damage.

I wonder if we have reached the point where we should take further
discussion to e-mail?

The firebombing of Dresden (which I think only involved RAF aircraft) 
was done *at the request of* the Soviets (the fleeing civilians would 
cause chaos behind German lines, making the Soviet advance easier).

This is getting a bit *too* hypothetical.

IMHO, Truman did what he did more for the sake of improving his own
political position than for any personal interest in protecting the lives
of US citizens.  He wanted to go down in history as a major player that
defeated the menacing Japanese.  The problem with doing things solely to be
remembered has its drawbacks, however, especially since opinions change
over time.  Just MHO.

Then there was the Ghurka who held a position all night against repeated

remember that after his right hand was blown off by a hand grenade (he\'d
been throwing them back), he got "very very angry" and counter-attacked.
The company retreated.

The Ghurkas, like the RM and SAS, go out of their way to create these

I recently read an article in New Scientist about the flooding of the
Black Sea.

Apparently sediment cores and so on indicate that the Black Sea was fresh
water fairly recently, and that when it was fresh it was a lot smaller.
The writer hypothesised that the flooding may have started some "big
flood" legends.

I knew I\'d regret that! I was referring to the population of the world, 
not the actual planet. Bear in mind that the average world has a 
population of half a million, not much of a starport, and TL lower than 
Earth today.

Yes, but it gives you an effectively infinite number of "nukes", which 
can be placed very accurately (if you can hit something the size of a 
Scout/Courier 10ls away, from orbit you put them virtually anywhere you 
like). And yes, the blasts are relatively small, but it would only take a 
couple to flatten a small town. How many 0.869Mt nukes would it take to 
destroy New York? And if you want a bigger blast, use the warhead from a 
det-laser.

Against a hostile world, all you have to do is puncture the domes, blow 
up the life-support system, etc.

Against a world that depends heavily on trade, you can disrupt this 
(shoot or turn away ships, nuke the starport, etc).

Against other worlds, you can sink any ship you want, shoot down any 
aircraft, destroy any power plant, flatten any population centre...and 
there\'s *nothing* most worlds can do to stop you.

There is no such thing as single combat in the air, BTW.  Most
engagements we practice for involve 60 strikers and about 8-10 dedicated
OCA.

OCA punches a hole the strikers push through, then CAPs while we do the
nasty(the other nasty.)  OPFOR is usually 6-10 redair, plus more sams
than you can shake a stick at.

Makes me wonder how Trav combat will actually occur with 3D.  Will there
be a wall of battle or will there be surgical ops like the
aforementioned.  I tend to beleive the former, simply because there is
nowhere for the strikers to hide.

And forces from all the contries on this list play in these games out in
Nevada.  No, I havent seen any UFO\'s....but I\'d like to:)

* The policy of only retalitating with nukes/CBW if first attacked that
way.


Works until you are losing. According to what I\'ve read of NATO battle
plans (and I\'m not an expert), using tactical nukes when conventional
methods didn\'t work was part of the plan.

Also causes problems when the original action is reprehensible. By a
straight tit-for-tat, if I gas your cities then you can gas mine. If I
napalm your villages then you can napalm mine. It may make great games
theory, but I have moral problems with the retaliation aspect.  (Also
makes riot control interesting: if I just throw rocks at you, can you
shoot me?)


Getting back to Traveller, when did the Imperial Rules of War evolve? 
When were they codified?  Where does biowar fit?  What is Imperial policy
to attacks?

Personally, I\'ve always favoured immediate massive retaliation by the
Imperials, because IMTU they are always outnumbered and can\'t trade
casualties one-for-one.  Note that I do note necessarily _support_ this
policy: my Imperium was always a bit darker than GDW\'s Imperium, and
tended to do questionable things. 

Could you military/legal types work up some standing policies for the M0
Imperium?

It might be interesting to have different policies for different branches
(eg. diplo/naval/scout) of Imperial service. That should really confuse
the natives!

Yes, that is pretty much where I got this idea.  They are an electronic form
of Kisyakae dolls (I hope I am spelling it right), and there\'s a strangely
fun, addictive quality to fooling around with the dolls.  The name has been
changed to KiSS dolls among American audiences.

But, I hope they haven\'t moved on to holographic images yet :^)

In the United States, christianity has been growing by leaps and bounds over
the last couple of years as well.  I don\'t think that we can really predict
that far into the future by looking at the religious trends in today\'s world
though.  Religion, on a base level, is explaining the unexplainable.  In
today\'s world, we place a lot of faith on science as having explained
everything.  Of course, there\'s always something that comes along screaming
down the road that is unexplainable...

Gravity and magnetism are two examples in today\'s world, and there are a lot
of things dealing with astronomy and space-time and all that jazz.  But, since
the understanding of gravity and magnetism only have to go so far for the
layman, it appears to be explained.  Things with less mass will be attracted
in some way to things with greater mass...  Magnets can stick to certain
metals and other magnets.

However, the Third Imperium has one very big something that the layman can
actually hear about, and possibly see, in action that completely circumvents
pretty much the rest of the universe.  J-Drive.  There\'s no explanation, it
just works.

In addition, you have the ancients.  Who are the ancients?  Why did they do
what they did?  Etc...

There are a lot of questions to be explained in the Traveller universe, and
religions are going to step in and answer these questions.  Personally, I
think religion would color a Traveller game most effectively, if used in the
right dosages.  After all, there is a religion behind every religious
dictatorship.  I think the dominant religion in the Imperium would be of
Vilani origin (unless some time in the Terra\'s conquest fueled mass
conversions, which is not entirely impossible).

I forget most of the details - it was a long time ago. 

His real name is Jonathan Prior - you might as well use that. The ship was
a CT merchant (far trader, I think), and I was setting him up for an
"infiltrate the pirates" adventure. I hadn\'t figured on his actions
because _I_ knew that the pirates wouldn\'t really kill the women and kids
(bad planning on my part).

The ship was modelled after the March Harrier (of Keith brothers fame). I
may have called it the March Hare - but that may have been a different
ship. (We had so many merchant ships then. After all, when you\'re scheming
to keep District 268 free from the Imperium you need a lot of money, and
trading was tfe best way of raising cash we could find.)

FromThe Civilization of Europe in the Renaissance

_from the fifteenth century the orderliness essential to civilization was
emphasized by the repeated definition of man as an animal endowed with
reason, and the distinction between irrational and disciplined behaviour.
\'Our Lord wishes people to conform to rule in external matters no less
than in their thoughts. Each must do what is right and proper for one of
his estate and order. If it is not done we shall become no better than
beasts and irrational animals.\' [Written in 1528 by Johann Agricola, the
German moralist.]

The most habitual threat to order was instinctive violence. That tempers
were short is clear from a multitude of criminal legal cases dealing with
peasant and artisan woundings and murders after a swift escalation from
words to deeds. The quick-tempered Paduan artist Niccolo Pizzolo was
murdered in 1452. Mantegna, that devout and scholarly painter, hired thugs
to beat up rival who filched his designs Michaelangelo\'s broken nose was
the result of an altercation with a fellow sculptor. Christopher Marlowe
was murdered. Ben Jonson killed the actor Gabriel Spencer in a tavern
brawl. 

Crude forms of self-help were commonplace, the punching of a debtor until
he agreed to pay up, the employment of assassins in family vendettas and
of armed bands to avenge real or fancied wrongs.

In his autobiography Bartholomew Sastrow describes _ life amidst the
inter-family and inter-city feuds_ It is a story of brutal parental
discipline, of schoolboy quarrels leading to the free use of knives, of
brawls in streets, of corrupt magistrates. It describes a society
unbending in its prejudices and animosities, utterly materialistic save
for its crude superstitions and its purient scrutiny of the private lives
of its Lutheran ministers. 

It was an age when standards of behaviour were set by the old and flouted
by the aggressive young. And these were in the majority. Half the
population, possibly more, was under twenty. Apart from free-lance
prostitutes and licensed market stall-holders, girls and young women,
whether married or not, were kept at home or went out with a chaperone or
in a group. The bulge in the population was most provocatively composed of
male adolescents, teenagers and young bachelors. Complaints about their
insubordination and peace-breaking were a Europe-wide commonplace. 

Peasant boys worked in the fields from the ages of eight or nine and urban
adolescents took up an apprenticeship at thirteen or fourteen, often far
from home. However loving and concerned parents were about the conduct of
their children, at an impressionable age the young were chiefly in the
company of one another. Social rank made little difference.

For most observers the concern for violence was on an everyday level, and
it was growing. this becomes apparent not just because more records
survived but because the level of violence increased, or at least was
perceived to increase by those who deplored it, as wealth flowed into
fewer hands and the proportion of the population who turned to violence
for gain or the release of resentment increased. Competition for jobs in
the swelling population at a time when guild memberships were frozen in
the interests of keeping profits high, led to a proliferation of
wage-earners who could hope for no promotion within the concern they
worked for.  While not in themselves an indication of increased violence,
something of social attitudes can be gleaned from off-hand remarks. The
poor \'are not so beautiful to look at as the higher groups,\' wrote the
Florentine Antonio Filarete in the early 1460s; to the military governors
of besieged towns who pushed them out to the enemies guns lest they ate
their betters\' dwindling stores of food, they were \'poor and useless\',
useless mouths\', useless people\'; for Thomas Nashe in 1599 - himself a
debt-ridden if talented scribbler - they were \'the rubbish meniality\'.
Mid-fifteenth-century plans for rationalizing the medieval clutter
surrounding St Peter\'s in Rome provided for three new streets, one for the
rich, one for the reasonably well-to-do, one for the service-rendering
poor. Leonardo\'s ideal town plan provided for upper walkways for the
\'gentlefolk\' to protect them from the infrastructure used by la
poveraglia, the plebs.

I\'m not sure if it is in the formal legal language, but since 1948 when the
USAAF became the USAF, there has been a kind of "gentleman\'s agreement": US
Army gets to use helicopters, USAF flies everything that\'s fixed wing. This
agreement has been strained several times (USAF is not happy that USA flies
fixed wing observation a/c, but allows it because they don\'t want the job),
but is generally holding. TAC air is something the Army wants very much, and
the USAF has shown great reluctance to let it go (even though they _hate_
doing it). I am told in 1948 that USAF tried to pry aircraft away from the US
Navy as well, but got nowhere. Rumor has it that shortly before the Gulf War,
USAF was going to phase A-10s out of service and transfer them to US Army
control, but changed their minds.

The dichotomy/rivalry between fighter and ground attack pilots also exists in
the US Navy, and between fighter and heavy bomber pilots in the USAF.

It is in the nature of the beast. Every arm/branch/service thinks their\'s is
the most important. 

And you know what? They\'re right -- every single one of them!

Actually it isn\'t (quite) 200 proof.  To attain that degree of purity
requires (at current TL) the use of some very toxic (and IIRC, expensive)
chemicals that not only leave the alcohol without a trace of water, but also
with a taste that is enough to warn you away from drinking it.  It is also
made even more poisonous due to the slight traces of the chemicals.

Last I checked it\'s impossible to get alcohol absolutely pure.

True, if the line segment begins at the emitter.  But what if it is about
a hundred meters long, beginning and ending in the vicinity of the target?
Which one more closely models the canonical meson effects?

What do you do if it\'s the CMO that\'s gone loopy/rogue/etc (but not enough to 
be noticed). He can declare the captain unfit, and nobody can argue 
(especially if it\'s a conspiracy with the XO). I wanted a safety net, hence

But if it\'s the CO who\'s committing them...?

So what *legally* can the command crew (say) do if the CO starts giving 
illegal orders?

If you catch it early enough, you may be able to nudge it just enough 
to make it miss. Breaking it into smaller bits *may* help. Yes, it 
means you get impacts over a larger area (which may do more damage), 
but if you\'re lucky many will be small enough to burn up in the 
atmosphere.

Yeah, that\'s pretty much how I see it. It\'s basically "my [service, regiment, 
ship (don\'t forget intraservice rivalry)] is better than yours." This can help 
to motivate troops - during the Falklands War, the (Royal) Marines and the 
Paras were basically racing each other across the island (on foot, carrying 
all their gear, fighting various battles along the way), both wanting to be 
the one to kick the Argentinians out of Port Stanley, and so prove

True. But would they be as effective if they were only as fast as the big
ships?

You see, the problem with using present-day analogies for Traveller
ships/fighters is that it\'s comparing apples and oranges. The similar
accelerations of Traveller fighters mean that we should really be
comparing battleships and frigates, or battleships and gunboats.

    'body' => 'I haven\'t seen the FFS2 stuff yet (I played CT and MT ... dropped out a while,
and just got some of the T4 material), but regarding devices attached to a
ship\'s hull and the ship\'s jump net, here\'s my "wave."

The grid would have to be installed in the hull during construction. Depending
on the Jump factor of the ship, certain algorithms would be used during the
design process to calculate the most efficient matrix distribution for that
ship\'s physical design (higher jump numbers imply a "tighter weave" to
jumpspace).  Use enough Lanthanum for the hull net, but not too much.  For
certain applications, say combat vessels and long-range scout designs, you\'d
probably over-design the net (so that the net continues to function in the
event the hull itself is damaged), but the goal is to install a net which uses
the least amount of Lantanum to get you a working jump drive.

I\'ve always thought that the higher the jump number of the ship, the "thicker"
the diameter of the installed Lantanum wiring matrix (to punch throught the
"tighter weave" of the jumpspace). Higher jump numbers require a more "robust"
net with a tighter weave, so a thicker diameter wire, installed more densely
on the hull, would be used to construct the net. However, even at Jump-6, the
wiring would be no thicker than perhaps a coaxial cable, and of course not all
of the netting material would be pure Lantanum (core matrix, Lantanum,
shielding, etc.).

The net would be installed on the vessel\'s surface, or very close to it, in
order to facilitate the dissapation of energy when the jump is activated.
There\'s a great deal of energy being fed to the net when the ship enters jump,
so there\'s probably some level of EM shielding associated with the net as well
(don\'t want to fry the vessel\'s occupant\'s when you go to jump).

Most of the time the vessel\'s turret and exterior configurations would be
known the time of construction (as well as the placement of "empty" turrets),
so the design of the net would take these "protrusions" to the installed jump
field into consideration. And most devices installed onto a Jump-capable
starship would have some level of Lanthanum installed during construction,
with the intention of augmenting the jump grid rather than just throwing "dead
weight" onto the exterior of the hull.  I don\'t think these devices would
necessarily be required to be "hard-wired" into the ship\'s jump net proper,
but the Lanthanum in these devices would be sympathetic to the jump activation
and share the field effect of the net\'s activation at jump ("glowing" along
with the remainder of the ship\'s architectural details, per SOM).

After construction, the trials of the ship would give the engineering staff
insight into the unique characteristics of the ship\'s net.  They would perform
a minumum of 2 jumps at every jump-level the ship is capable of, and determine
the exact characteristics of the ship\'s net.  These values would then be made
available to the ship\'s computer (most likely physically hard-wired into ROH
[Read-Only Holocrystals]) to assist the ship\'s navigator in final jump
performance of the ship.

(In fact, in one gaming session an adventurer decided to "aquire" the jump net
matrix calculations from a competing shipyard, delaying jump certification of
a starship\'s design.  They won the contract ... because there were
"unexplained delays" in the other ship\'s certification.)

Just some ideas,

I disagree. Supposing I killed you. That would solve the problem of our

More seriously: Sometimes armed conflict is the only way to resolve a
situation available to us. Once that conflict starts, then the search for
better weaponry begins. Escalation leads to the likes of nuclear weapons
and biotoxins. But where to draw the line? Is 1 10Kt warhead more repugnant
than 10 thousand tons of High Explosive? Same effect. 

Most people dread the fallout etc effects of nuclear explosives, and they
have a point. But we have nukes right now. And all the other tools of
warfare, too. They aren\'t going to go away unless we make them. Once we
don\'t need them any more they\'ll be thrown away. And not until.

You can read about this idea in my novel \'For The Greater Good\' (plug!)

I can\'t handle the idea that a weapon is vile and evil. Weapons are the
tools of men. They are lumps of metal and chemicals, nothing more. They

ourselves. 

Until we make weapons unnecessary, weapons will always be necessary.

Until then, I stand ready to defend myself by whatever means are necessary.

Yeah, but targetting cities, and their industrial base, is OK.
Otherwise every nation in WWII would guilty of war crimes.
However, while I disagree with that idea, it (and the position

The bombing of cities was accepted by all sides.  Even if one

Reminds me of "Trash Can Punch" from my University days.  To make it, you
take a 55 gallon trash can (washed well and disinfected and lined with a new
white can liner or 3).  In it, the night before, you put 5 gallons of
Everclear and half a bushel of pealed oranges.  Just before the party, add
20 cans of frozen grape juice concentrate, 20 liters of 7-up (or other clear
citrus soft drink), and as much water as is needed to make 50 gallons.

The reason you soaked the oranges the night before, was so they could soak
up lots of alcohol.  Many of the "respectable" types who wouldn\'t touch the
drink would eat the fruit.  The results were much the same.  Oddly, I
noticed that even if they woke up with a hangover the next day, they still
ate the oranges.  Go figure.

Actually, we had a trash can we used for nothing else, but it makes for some
mystery.

The decision has already been made for you.

Luckily things have been pretty boring for the last few years, but this
is just a lull. I wouldn\'t worry about global peace blossoming very
soon.  As soon as the American market/worldwide economy crashes ugly
heads will rear again.

Then somebody will again realize what militaries are for-because they\'ll
be scared shitless.  Believe it or not some folks just don\'t like the
West, but cant really say diddly about it...yet.

The 3I is a realistic government.  It fights for the percieved
betterment of its people thru its own prejudices and conceptions. It has
fought and will fight wars.

Don\'t forget the Vilani are 80% of the Imperial population, and thier
military tradition is one of no holds barred/no prisoners. Imperials
play for keeps, with any toys they have.

I think that after contact, all of these faiths will be struggling to adapt as
fast as they can and trying to keep as many in the fold as possible.  I\'m
particularly thinking of Stranger In A Strange Land by Robert Heinlein and the
impact that a new \'galactic\' religion might have upon the older, more established
religions.  The Contact context (apologies for alliteration) focuses the potential
for such a crisis.  To me, it says that the good ol\' religions will adapt or die,
thus adaption.  (For my own personal contemplation, a potential reconciliation of
Christianity, Judaism, and Islam is interesting to think about.  While I\'m no
religious scholar <shudder>,  I have heard some describe Jesus\' actions (not his
words mind you, but his actions), as those of a good Jew. And I am intrigued by
some subtle ideas in Simon Green\'s Deathstalker novels about an Imperial Church of
Christ the Warrior - members of this church are described as battle-dress wearing
clergy.  Somthing to think about.  That this setting of novels also incorporated
Psionics, leads me to conclude that it was, at the very least, heavily influenced
by Traveller.

  Luckily for me, I only play with my brother and a close friend of ours. Suffice
to say that the only religious seremonies any of us have attended have been under
duress from parents who were trying to make up for their own lack of faith.  Its
really hard to be an alter boy for mass when you think you\'re wasting your time.
And the Bishop doesn\'t appreciate religious commentary from a 9 year old.  Believe
me!  I\'ve learned my lesson.  Keep your head down and your mouth shut!

I hadn\'t considered Jeffersonian Deism, most probably because I haven\'t the
faintest clue what it is.  I vaguely understand what Deism is, but when I think of
Jefferson, I think of his Monticello and how he got the triglyphs and metopes
wrong (vague ancient Greek architectual reference - and he really did get them
wrong.)

Concerning the core philosphy of such a church as I contemplate:  in discussions
in private mail and with friends (yes, Face-to-Face), I\'ve realized that its going
to be very difficult to have a cohesive doctrine.  This supports what Volker has
said, but in a different way.  Here\'s the analysis:  to be effective, such a
church is going to have to be able to incorporate/subsume/assimilate the belief
systems of newly contacted worlds.  That means an opened ended system of belief
that is arguably more tolerant than any current earthbound large-scale religion.
This has two consequences:  first, it vastly limits the dramatic potential of
heresy, inquisitions, etc.  Second, it offers little in support of Imperial
expansion, because if a newly contacted world\'s belief system (assuming monolithic
religious systems  - which, after the Rule Of Man, is not an unreasonable
position) can be readily reconciled with official church dogma, no one is worse
off or even much better off in religious terms, so the whole issue seems to moot
out.

Fey!  Why bother in the first place.  Good question.  I have no answer other than
that I think that the idea of Battle-Dress wearing Battle-Chaplains of the
Imperial Church of Sylea (or Some Such) is just to cool a picture to dismiss.  Or
perhaps you might enjoy more the picture of an Inquisitor (the highest rank an NCO
in the Religious Military Orders can aspire to), investigating the theft of an
artefact of the Ancients from the Relicquary of the Church - battle scarred and
long trained in command, as well as intimidation, perception and interrogation,
Inquisitors make even devout aetheists wonder where there mommy is and if she can
make the bad man go away.  (there!  you see why I can\'t let this idea die?).

I guess my real problem is that I have no good reason for putting an intolerant,
powerful and independant organization into the Third Imperium (though I am very
mindful of someone\'s - forgoet whos - ideas about Cleon being perceived as a God
in very Lo-Tech cultures).

Ever get the feeling you\'ve bitten off more than you can chew?

Very strange feelimg for me and my above-average gut.

I think there is an "Imperial Culture" also, but the various worlds are
just plain anarchy. Every thing is there because the tech level varies
from drums to grav focussed e/m psedoholos.

The Imperial Culture IMTU(hehheh) is a culture directly descended by the
people who own the starlanes but not the worlds.  For instance,
Kaggushus may be a very Imperial world, wheras a nearby system may abhor 
Imperial standards.

I beleive "Imperial" culture cues directly from the nobility and hence
the Emperor.  Probably strong military(Naval) traditions there also. 
To be "Imperial" would be rather like us, the Traveller abroad.  The
characters from the old DGP books are classic Imperials, albeit backward
and from the Marches.  An example of a "non-Imperial" could be a citizen
of a world deeply emeshed in its own ancient culture.  They would look
at disgust on Imperials.  That would make Imps sort of like people of
the West, just more conservative.

I don\'t disagree with you there - some sams probably cost more than some of
the cheaper attack aircraft out there e.g. Su7s and MiG19s. And I certianly
don\'t think sams make air forces obselete, any more than ATGWs and LAWs
make tanks useless (more\'s the pity, I\'d make my old job so much easier).

Actually more recent studies show that the German cities (or rather the
industries in them) wern\'t affected that much by the bombing, so they were
still military targets. However given the lack of effect of the bombing and
enormous colateral damage done by it the continuation of it was still
wrong. What\'s more the British experience and analysis of recon, escaped
POW reprots, etc pointed to this during the war, and there was strong
opposition on both practical and moral grounds within the allies military
which was ignored.

I willingly admit that there\'s a place for fighters and fighter jocks, I
just wish that they didn\'t end up dominating air force policy. I don\'t know
about the Russian/Soviet air establishments (they had national air defence
in a seperate force from  the battlefield Frontal Aviation, anyway), but
elsewhere this always seems to be the case, blast it.

ObTrav: How much would the 3I\'s policy of owning the space between systems,
and leaving the internal affairs of a planet to its occupants (once they\'ve
all become good little consumers, anyway), and the shift that this would
bring in Navy ship design and tactical thinking towards ship-ship combat
have hurt the 3I\'s military efforts in the Pacification Campaigns?

In a supplement for the game _Space Opera_ there was a piece on this, in
which it was pointed out that the best analogy was with the MTBs of WWII.
Unfortunatly they then gave them special bonuses toevasion that nothing
else got that turned them back into the equivalents of aircraft.

Because there has to be a physics nullifier in place to make meson
weapons work as avertized, this is obviously a little up for grabs.

Decay times are half-lives. The beam will decay along its flight
path. The direct force control that is available when MGs pop up as
weapons must be what allows them to do what they do in traveller,
but I would say that there is definitely a volume of space along the
beam path where most of the action takes place.

That said, I\'ve always argued that there will be just enough gammas
emitted along the beam path that it is possible to use it to find at
least the line of flight of the beam. Get a few values and you can
nail the deep meson site. The gammas formed from decay will have a
preference to travel in the beam direction, I think, so being the
ship that takes this sensor data might be a dangerous job...

This is the key point to use modern naval units for comparison.

Ignore aircraft altogether and it models decently well to traveller.
"Fighters" launched in traveller might be like a CV that carried
Osas instead of aircraft.

I chimed in with a "me too" here because a lot of the
misunderstandings involving fighters in traveller revolve around
this issue.

a "grand voyaging" culture based on many islands (some similarities to
the polynesians with elements of arabic and some of my own ideas thrown
in for good measure). A strong tradition of hosptiality and honour, with
a warrior class. They received Jump drive from the Vilani, established
a number of colonies (no formal interstellar gov\'t more a loose coalition)
as an extension of their voyaging culture.

Prime difference from "standard" humans: Right brain dominant with language

than the classic speach centres.

As I recall (and my memory may be playing tricks on me), several German
officers were charged with the crime of waging \'unrestricted submarine 
warfare\', and successfully defended themselves from this charge, based
on the fact that the US Navy did exactly the same thing* to the Japanese.

* Unrestricted sumbarine warfare, that is: torpedoing merchant ships without
  warning.

I\'ve always felt that while most of the meson\'s would decay at the target
point some would decay a little earlier and a little later, in a bell
curve. This would give an ellipsoid blast pattern (given some beam
dispersion), enlongated along a line drawn between the gun and target. With
measurements of the beams shape and power, etc after a shot or two a would
be possible to locate the firer.

Herewith...

Much of Vilani culture was drastically affected by the conquest
of the Vilani empire by the Rule of Man.  Some traditions were
banned, others fell out of use, still others were preserved, but
only privately (cf the Jewish traditions of many Spanish and
Portuguese Christians - those who are called "hidden Jews",
"crypto-Jews", or "Marranos").  Vilani personal names fit into
the third category.

Normally, a Vilani name is given in two or occasionally three
parts: Eneri Lentuli, Ashi Kaagira Samiibukun, et cetera.  In
reality, there are five components to a Vilani name:

The first component is the personal name, corresponding to the
personal or given name in most Solomani traditions.  This name is
what is used in routine informal address, and may itself be
shortened or modified into what most Anglic-speakers would call a
"nickname" for use in extremely informal contexts.

The second component, if it exists, is also a personal name.
This name is generally derived either from the personal name
(first component) of an honored relative (usually, but not
invariably, deceased) or from some desirable quality of
personality, or from a person, an animal, or a thing that
possesses that quality.  This corresponds to the "middle name" in
most Solomani European traditions.  This component may be changed
at will by the bearer; it is also not unknown for a component of
this class to be bestowed on a person by companions (compare the
"earning" of a nickname, TAC-code, or "warname" in some military
and paramilitary organizations).  This component of the name is
traditionally Vilani, but need not be if the bearer wishes
otherwise.

The third component indicates what most Solomani would think of
as "ethnicity".  In reality, it is the name of the secure area
that the community lived in prior to the termination of the
Ancient war machines on Vland.  This name is generally associated
with identifiable physical characteristics (as when a Solomani
"looks Italian", for example), and is generally not used except
in those contexts of the utmost formality.  Assimilated Vilani
(those who do not trace their ancestry to Vland, but who have
adopted Vilani culture) generally use the name of their home
planet, transliterated according to Vilani practice, for this
component.

The fourth component is a family or clan name.  The distinction
between "family" and "clan" is not as clear-cut in Vilani
tradition as in Terran traditions; as a great deal of mutual
support was needed for survival on ancient Vland, extended
families staying together became the norm.  This is used in the
same context as a "family name" or "last name" in the most common
Solomani conventions.  Family/clan names are _never_
occupational; this usage is the fifth component.

The fifth component is derived from the caste that the person is
a member of.  In some senses, this corresponds to occupational
surnames in Solomani European traditions; in other ways, it
corresponds to a rank or title.  This component is not added to
the name until maturity, when the caste is selected; it is
lengthened or otherwise modified over time to show relative
experience or knowledge, although the root does not change.

In most contexts, a Vilani\'s name will be given as first-fourth
or first-second-fourth; friends and family will call him first or
a modification; comrades-in-arms will call him first or second.
In business, if the name is given in one of these forms, the
Vilani will generally be addressed as fourth, with an appropriate
title (e.g., "Mr", "Mrs", the Vilani equivalents, etc.) preceding
it.  On occasion, in a business context, the Vilani will give his
name as fourth-fifth; in such a case, it is proper to address him
in exactly that manner, with no additional titles.

If the Vilani is being created a peer of the Imperium, his full
name would be used and placed on the letters-patent.

Example:  The Vilani\'s full name is

	Eneri Wisdom Irkira Managudeli Shugilamar

His friends and family will generally call him "Eneri"

His ancestry is from the Vilani minor continent of Irka Ir, which
only had a single secure refuge.

When he served in the Navy, his shipmates gave him the name
"Lightning", and would call him that as often as they did
"Eneri".  He changed to "Wisdom" upon mustering out.

He would probably introduce himself to you as "Eneri Managudeli".

A (Solomani) business contact would call him "Mr Managudeli",
unless Eneri has given his name as "Manadugeli Shugilamar", in
which case he would be addressed in full in that manner.

He would probably give his name as "Manadugeli Shugilamar" to a
Vilani business associate, and would be called that way by them.

When his military record catches up with him, and it comes to the
Emperor\'s notice that he should be knighted for his actions in
saving an entire squadron of Imperial Navy ships from certain
destruction, the letters-patent would award the knighthood to
"Eneri Wisdom Irkira Managudeli Shugilamar".

Thoughts?  Quibbles?  Shrieks of agony?

Actually, *recent* (say last 10 years) studies show that bombing was *decisive*
in destroying German Industry ... mainly through forcing a dispersal and then
cutting the transport net to shreds so that the dispersed sites could not be
supplied and could not ship their products. They also show that Bombing of the
transport net closed down German industry around six weeks before the end of the
war, and that for the six or eight months before that had been increasingly
decisive in its course and conduct.

The problem was that it took such a long time to set up the long drop and short
rope that many people after the war (including those doing the Strategic Bombing
Survey) failed to fully appreciate exactly what happened.

Many still do not, but, increasingly, studies are showing the decisiveness of
the campaign.

Yeah. I was talking about this on trav-tech, and it was mentioned by
somebody on the TML a while back, but meson screen interactions
could be interesting.

The beam is decayed a little early by the screen, but even so, the

I was the fellow who brought up the effect of MG and M Screen
interaction.

The only way for the tech to operate as described is by using 
decay inhibiter (eletroweak force) bottle effect described in the 
SOM.

IMHO the canonical meson effects are more closely modeled by the point in space 
theory. Remember the first contact with the TL17 robots of Sabmiqys (my spelling is 
probably wrong). The planetary meson guns let the scout ships explode inside out 
without any sign of firing.

However, _real_ world meson guns (if they could be built) would would have their 
meson decay happen along a line segment, making any kind of deep meson gun 
completely unfeasable. This is because if you adjust the half time of the mesons by 
accelerating them to relativistic speeds, all you have done is to alter the probability 
curve for the decay, since half time means the time where half of the particles in 
question have decayed. There is no way of exactly knowing the _life_ time of an 
individual particle.

That-yes, but you would have to live with the consequences, go to jail,

Seriously, believing violence with stop violence just doesn´t cut it.
There will always be resentment in the long run, causing even greter
problems.
My countries history is a good example. When WW1 was lost, the terms
Germany had to fulfill were devastation, practacally ruining the
country, this opened the path for Hitler to take power. I truly believe
hat had the victors of WW1 been more civil in their demands, Hitler
would have stood no chance at all.
After WW2 the Allies helped us get back on our feet. This time around we
bacame you most faithful allies. Somehow shows that revenge and
retaliation are not always wise.
Same thing with violence to stop a problem. (Excepting of course
self-defense and stopping an agressor)

Not growing, the numbers remain the same. The CC and allies of them just

Which is one of many points which convinced me Religion is a hoax. When
thunder was unexplaned, there were thunder gods. The sun was a god at
times, as was the ocean, the trees. I think just because i can´t explain
something doesn´t mean i have to believe it to be divine. We just don´t
understand it yet, but at some point we will. The unexplainable today is
the explained of tomorrow. It´s a scientific approach, which totally
ruins religion for me ;-)

WE have no explanation for JD, who says people in the 3I don´t know how

No contest, religion is out there, but on a smaller scale than you
think:
No State Religion of the 3I, no officially endorsed religion, no
religion controlling most of the imperium, no single religion greater
than say 1% of the entire imperial population.

Here i disagree: The solomani didn´t even have enough people to
efficiently control all Vilani worlds, they depended on the Vilani
bureaucracy, which in time caused their downfall. Canon also states that
entire starsystems were often controlled by a single terran officer in
the beginning. Even if the 5% of the human population of earth today
went out to control Vilani space, each system would only have 25.000
Terrans to take control of one world (assuming the Vilani empire had
11.000 systems, as the 3I). 25.000 to take control of a world! Not many
spare men to convert heathens, and there wasn´t a focus on that, so
those people were rather used for their main purpose: Taking control,
and keeping it!

No they won´t. I replied to him privately and made my point clear.
Though both things (nuking japan and the holocaust) happened in the same
war, they do not have anything to do with each other. Both were evils of
the same war, but can´t be compared with each other. 
Anyway, most Germans have learned a lesson from this war, to watch what
is happening, form an own opinion and never let anything like this

Remember that in 1945 the stigma against nuclear weapons didn\'t exist
like it does now. We had firebombed so many Japanese cities there were
few left to attack, and killed hundreds of thousands of civilians in
the process. Poison gas was seriously considered if we had had to
invade the main islands, which would have killed hundreds of thousands
of Japanese as well. It was considered that the use of the atomic
bombs would hasten the end of the war, which would be beneficial to
both sides by this time.

All the warring parties felt that attacking civilian targets was a
legitimate use of strategic air power. The Germans did it, as did the
British and Americans. Douhet\'s philosophy was shown in WWII to be
incorrect, but that did not stop the strategic bomber generals from
doing it anyway.

A wonderful work. I will certainly use this in my games. Being a player new

The only shrieks of agony this will produce in my gaming group will come

Terra
Have you considered that we (Terrans c. 1998) are studying/enjoying music
that is as old as the recording systems we have designed to preserve it?  We
have "music" that is over 2600 years old, that I know of.

Even through the dark ages/middle ages/medieval period, we as a culture
managed to hold on to the music and drama of previous eras.  (Yes the
Byzantines helped.)  So, I would be surprised if revivals of various forms
and periods were uncommon.  Perhaps the highest form of music or drama in M0
would be what we call classical.

In _Morning Star_ (or was the _Evening Star_), they had a reproduction of
"The Globe Theatre" which put on the works of William Shakespeare.  I should
think that type of thing would be quite common.  Who knows what periods
between now and then would also be revived.

I can just see the Imperial Fleet cruising into battle with the intercom
blasting _Flight of The Valkyries_ (or maybe _Flight of the Bumble Bees_),
or a space opera with The Beetles playing the theme music.

>Getting back to Traveller, when did the Imperial Rules of War evolve? 

In Classic Traveller, the "Imperial Rules of War" were a set of guidelines 
for mercenaries operating in frontier and less-stable areas of the Imperium.  
It is well-known that the Imperium would intervene in conflicts where 
\'significant\' economic damage is being done.  

The "Rules of War" were guidelines for staying out of trouble.  Weapons of
Mass destruction (specifically nuclear weapons, but presumably other types
of weapons that can cause similar devastation, including deadfall attacks
and biowarfare) were virtually certain to trigger Imperial intervention.
Any significant damage to people or property of non-combatant worlds (or
nations, in the case of Balkanized planets) would also trigger an
intervention, as would "significant" damage to infrastructre or significant 
civilian casualties on the part of the combatant nations.

>When were they codified?  

They\'ve never been codified, and were not a part of Imperial law.  The
Imperium reserved the right to intervene whenever and wherever it felt
the need to, and therefore the Rules of War were never codified.

    True enough for troops from a modern Secular State, I don\'t think that
applies in the Iranian forces or other States where Religion is Seriously
Important. ;) Remember that the Secular State with seperation of church and
state is a fairly recent thing and Americans are pretty unusual in being so
secular.  The majority of the wars of history have been fought over, for or on
the pretext of religion after all. ;)

    "Slay them all, God will know his own." - Said by the Bishop with the
Crusaders relieving the Siege of the christian city of Acre under siege by
Muslim forces which had forced a breach and the Crusader commander complained
that his troops would be unable to tell Christian from Muslim if he attacked.
    History is filled with exactly this sort of insanity motivating troops.
Remember the curse?  "Bear my name into Hell so they know who will be coming
after you!"

    For modern, Western, Secular states and populations like our I\'m sure
you\'re right.  But we are not necessarily the wave of the future you know. ;)

    Problem is that for some societies/cultures you\'ll be unable to do that.
In others you\'ll have a soldiers religion or the troops will believe themselves
on a holy crusade/war for their Faith.  Remember this is TRAVELLER, it\'s not
going to all be generic late twentieth century secularism. ;)

    Not sublight drive actually.  The book in which she covers the initial
colonization attempt makes it clear they are using an FTL drive.  However the
distance from Pern to the main area of Human civilization is so great that it
took years of FTL flight just to reach Pern and that the initial colonists were
essentially on their own and wanted it that way!

    Hmmm!  Just had a thought actually.  The initial colonists of Pern were
leaving behind an Interstellar civilization that had just won a HUGE war.  They
were sick of the fighting and struggle and wanted to start again.  In the
Traveller Universe Pern could well have been settled by Terrans sick of the
wars that created the Second Imperium!  After all there have been an awful lot
of expeditions from Terra out towards the Rim so it\'s wouldn\'t be all that hard
for one of them to have been the one that created Pern. ;)

I guess that sends us back to the magical point decay, although Rupert\'s
short bell curve would do just as well to circumvent the possibility of
the thing going off inside an empty fuel tank (which was the original
source of this thread).  It would make for a nice light show if mesons
decayed along the length of the beam, though (a la cover of Brilliant
Lances).  If you could get the enemy to line up real nice, you could even
nail several of them with one shot.  8-)

I was thinking more along the lines of direct close support craft, like the

The Army is ever-so-slowly making the A2 the standard.  As I recall, the
Marine armor units in the Gulf still had M-60s!  If you add in the heavier
artillery component and our organic support, the Army is the force that
occupies the enemy\'s teretory and palnts the flag.  Marines are great at
that intial assult, but really lack the logistic depth to carry on through
a campaign.

Speaking as a good 11-Bullet Catcher (Warsaw Pact Ammunition Collection

Theoretically, we could.  The theory was that the various state militias
would join together to form the US Army.  During WWII, the majority of
combat troops were National Guardsmen called to Federal Service.  The
reality is that given the very technical nature of modern warfare, a
standing Army is a necessity.

For those of you who never served, being a modern infantryman (Army or
USMC) is much more than toting a rifle.  Over half the skill you learn in
Basic are technical in nature, and as you progress, your technical
knowledge expands.

Of course, since our manhood is at stake, we have to have the 82nd
Airborne, which utilizes a combat technique that was obsolete in 1945.

Actually, the album "Yellow Submarine" features music from the film, which

At the risk of reopening the C speed rocks debate, I\'ll offer some figures.

Take a small NiFe asteroid, say 100 m in diameter.  It would have a volume
of c.  523,600 cubic meters and a mass of c.  4,188,800 tons.  Let\'s call
that 4 MT for convenience.  Let\'s say you accelerate it at 1 m/s/s for just
1 hour (3,600 seconds).  It now has a velocity of 3.6 km/s (that\'s over
8,000 MPH).  At that speed, it will have a kinetic energy of 5.184e+10 kN.

Check my work.  Here are the formulas I used:

V = pi/6*d^3
m = V*8
v = a*t
Ek=m*v*v

I bet Deadeye could tell us the energy equivalent for a ton of TNT if you
don\'t know (I don\'t).

	Of course, as long as I consider complex rules like Brilliant Lances,
	and self defined ships ( yes I\'m still a gearhead ). Its difficult
	with FFS to build boats (100dt-), which are beyond imposible to lock,
	or average if the boat is a fighter (10dt-). "beyond imposible" in
	BL means that a task can not be attempted. Fine give\'em some short
	range KKMs, some large passive ems folding array drones, some radio
	beacon drones. Deply them in small groups, and you\'ll have a sniper
	(or as the germans say Wolfspack) squadron attached to a fleet, or
	operating as scouts.

	Back to the topic:

	This is of course horrorfull TNE handwaving, but it was Davids
	intension to offer some new ways, like the jump-torpedo or the
	xray laser, unusual in imperial design with its "null development"
	according to its vilani/sylean tradition.

	TNE showed some development like increased fuel efficiency with TL,
	or technologies unusual in imperial campains invented by virus or
	by pocket empires from scratch (the jump torpedos, cybercloning,
	xray lasers, non nuclear missiles, ...) Of course anytime you\'ve to
	ask for a story to explain. The jump torpedo is easy to explain.
	Viliani tradition was TL:10-J1 for traders and one level higher
	for military ships. The vilani have a standard proved to work
	over ?000 years, size of a socket or a bay or a container, anything
	has its standard. Without interstellar economie would\'nt work,
	and it wont be posible to repair a ship far from its homeport.
	The jump torpedo was of course a perfid virus idea, replace the
	crewstation with a 3rd computer and a jumpdrive. The xray laser
	only makes sense, if you uses non standard sockets. And its not
	as good for orbital bombardment. The KKM only works short range
	with suprise, and this suprise is only posible with the jump
	torpedo concept. And of course KKMs had been forbidden in the 3I.
	While the good nuke is ideal for devasting a planet, the small
	53cm KKM is a evil weapon able to kill a warship regardless of
	armor. No chance that system defense is allowed to use it.

Well, the body has to be large enough to have "significant" internal
gravity. That is, the material has to be able to "settle". And for that
mattter, it has to be large enough for internal heat to melt things. 

Both of those point towards bodies tens of kilometers across. The
smaller asteroids will either be undifferentiated ice & dust (if you
are way out from the star) or fragements from collisions between the
larger bodies.

Yes I can. Contrary to the opinion of far too many people, a thrown
rock is a deadly weapon. There\'s a *reason* why riot police wear those
helmets and carry those shields. Without them, rocks are *deadly*. With
them, the rocks are merely dangerous.

There\'s a case on record of a grizzly bear charging a railroad "track
walker". The track walker was an amateur softball pitcher. He *killed*
the grizzly by throwing rocks at it. Anything that can kill an adult
grizzly is equivalent to a bullet as far as "force" is concerned.

There\'s also a reason that "stoning" used to be a form of execution.

Cute.  I like the strategy.  So far I use nearly pure roleplaying, so
I\'m not a genius when it comes to fighting game ships.  Mostly I
simulate intense combat situation then make the players react.

Since I\'m interested in this more from an art /strategic standpoint, the
tac plotting is not useful--yet.

I would love to have a computer program that simulates a combat holotank
over a determined time period, complete with IFF tags.

Actually, you can remove the last of the water by adding a
zeolite (known as "molecular seives") to suck up the last.
You just then filter it away.

Hum, let\'s see...a quarter pound rock, about two inches in diameter thrown
at eighty miles per hour...that would be about 110 grams at about 36 meters
per second.  Using G^3, and rounding everything off, we get...

  J = 108 x (36)^2 / 2011 = 70

  DV = (70 x .735 / 5 )^.5 = 3

...at best we\'re talking about 1d3, at best.  That track walker must have
had some beaucoup good rolls on his throws. ;->

That *really* seems too low, though, doesn\'t it! You\'d *think* a rock
thrown hard would do more damage than that. Did I do the math wrong? 

Aside: I remember the story of how Bob Feller, the famous baseball pitcher,
was discovered by a scout. The scout was on his way to a see a game out in
the county and got lost.  When he saw a young man far out in a grain field
he stopped to ask directions, calling the boy over.  When the young man got
near the scout noticed that he was carrying a sack in each hand.  The scout
asked the man what was in the sacks.

"Well, sir, this one has dead rabbits for my supper." said the lad holding
up one sack.

"And this one has my rocks." he said holding up the other.

Bob Feller had been "stoning" rabbits in the field, one rock, one throw,
one dead rabbit...or so the story goes. ;->

With any rock of a "decent" size, "burning up" makes things *worse*,
because the *real* damage from a large strike is in the extra heat
energy pumped into the planetary weather system. It\'ll make El Nino
look tame.

With a "concentrated" strike, a lot of energy goes into earthquakes
(Iwhich still winds up as heat, but it takes longer), and if it\'s a
land strike much of the energy will be radiated back into space from
the crater. Note that with anything of 1 km or larger size, you\'ll have
exposed magma at the bottom of the crater, adding more heat.

A "break into pieces and burn up" strike lodges all the energy in the
atmosphere. 

A sea strike not only lodges the energy of the strike in the atmsphore,
but it also vaporizes cubic kilometers of seawater, and creates a lot
of dust (from seabed sediment picking up by the seawater rushing in to
fill the crater). And all the heat from the exposed magma goes into the
atmosphere as well. 

So "burning up" is somewhat better than a sea strike, but a lot worse
than a land strike.

In any case, the planetary weather system will be really messed up. As
in major storms, droughts, floods, all that fun stuff.
